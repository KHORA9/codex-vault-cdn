But his life was so\r\nessentially one of work, that a history of the man could not be written\r\nwithout following closely the career of the author. Thus it comes\r\nabout that the chief part of the book falls into chapters whose titles\r\ncorrespond to the names of his books.\r\n\r\nIn arranging the letters I have adhered as far as possible to\r\nchronological sequence, but the character and variety of his researches\r\nmake a strictly chronological order an impossibility. It was his habit\r\nto work more or less simultaneously at several subjects. Experimental\r\nwork was often carried on as a refreshment or variety, while books\r\nentailing reasoning and the marshalling of large bodies of facts were\r\nbeing written. Moreover, many of his researches were allowed to\r\ndrop, and only resumed after an interval of years. Thus a rigidly\r\nchronological series of letters would present a patchwork of subjects,\r\neach of which would be difficult to follow. The Table of Contents will\r\nshow in what way I have attempted to avoid this result.\r\n\r\nIn printing the letters I have followed (except in a few cases) the\r\nusual plan of indicating the existence of omissions or insertions. My\r\nfather's letters give frequent evidence of having been written when he\r\nwas tired or hurried, and they bear the marks of this circumstance. In\r\nwriting to a friend, or to one of his family, he frequently omitted the\r\narticles: these have been inserted without the usual indications, except\r\nin a few instances, where it is of special interest to preserve intact\r\nthe hurried character of the letter. Other small words, such as \"of\",\r\n\"to\", etc., have been inserted usually within brackets. I have not\r\nfollowed the originals as regards the spelling of names, the use of\r\ncapitals, or in the matter of punctuation. My father underlined many\r\nwords in his letters; these have not always been given in italics,--a\r\nrendering which would unfairly exaggerate their effect.\r\n\r\nThe Diary or Pocket-book, from which quotations occur in the following\r\npages, has been of value as supplying a frame-work of facts round which\r\nletters may be grouped. It is unfortunately written with great brevity,\r\nthe history of a year being compressed into a page or less; and contains\r\nlittle more than the dates of the principal events of his life, together\r\nwith entries as to his work, and as to the duration of his more serious\r\nillnesses. He rarely dated his letters, so that but for the Diary it\r\nwould have been all but impossible to unravel the history of his books.\r\nIt has also enabled me to assign dates to many letters which would\r\notherwise have been shorn of half their value.\r\n\r\nOf letters addressed to my father I have not made much use. It was his\r\ncustom to file all letters received, and when his slender stock of files\r\n(\"spits\" as he called them) was exhausted, he would burn the letters of\r\nseveral years, in order that he might make use of the liberated \"spits.\"\r\nThis process, carried on for years, destroyed nearly all letters\r\nreceived before 1862. After that date he was persuaded to keep the more\r\ninteresting letters, and these are preserved in an accessible form.\r\n\r\nI have attempted to give, in Chapter III., some account of his manner\r\nof working. During the last eight years of his life I acted as his\r\nassistant, and thus had an opportunity of knowing something of his\r\nhabits and methods.\r\n\r\nI have received much help from my friends in the course of my work.\r\nTo some I am indebted for reminiscences of my father, to others for\r\ninformation, criticisms, and advice. To all these kind coadjutors\r\nI gladly acknowledge my indebtedness. The names of some occur in\r\nconnection with their contributions, but I do not name those to whom I\r\nam indebted for criticisms or corrections, because I should wish to bear\r\nalone the load of my short-comings, rather than to let any of it fall on\r\nthose who have done their best to lighten it.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen how largely I am indebted to Sir Joseph Hooker for the\r\nmeans of illustrating my father's life. The readers of these pages\r\nwill, I think, be grateful to Sir Joseph for the care with which he has\r\npreserved his valuable collection of letters, and I should wish to add\r\nmy acknowledgment of the generosity with which he has placed it at my\r\ndisposal, and for the kindly encouragement given throughout my work.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Huxley I owe a debt of thanks, not only for much kind help, but\r\nfor his willing compliance with my request that he should contribute a\r\nchapter on the reception of the 'Origin of Species.'\r\n\r\nFinally, it is a pleasure to acknowledge the courtesy of the publishers\r\nof the 'Century Magazine' who have freely given me the use of their\r\nillustrations. To Messrs. Maull and Fox and Messrs. Elliott and Fry I am\r\nalso indebted for their kindness in allowing me the use of reproductions\r\nof their photographs.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS DARWIN.\r\n\r\nCambridge, October, 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\nVOLUME I.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.I.--The Darwin Family.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.II.--Autobiography.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.III.--Reminiscences.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.IV.--Cambridge Life--1828-1831.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.V.--The Appointment to the 'Beagle'--1831.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.VI.--The Voyage--1831-1836.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.VII.--London and Cambridge--1836-1842.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.VIII.--Religion.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.IX.--Life at Down--1842-1854.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.X.--The Growth of the 'Origin of Species.'\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.XI.--The Growth of the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies'--Letters--1843-1856.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.XII.--The Unfinished Book--May 1856-June 1858.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.XIII.--The Writing of the 'Origin of Species'--June 18,\r\n1858--November 1859.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.XIV.--Professor Huxley on the Reception of the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE AND LETTERS OF CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.I. -- THE DARWIN FAMILY.\r\n\r\nThe earliest records of the family show the Darwins to have been\r\nsubstantial yeomen residing on the northern borders of Lincolnshire,\r\nclose to Yorkshire. The name is now very unusual in England, but I\r\nbelieve that it is not unknown in the neighbourhood of Sheffield and in\r\nLancashire. Down to the year 1600 we find the name spelt in a variety\r\nof ways--Derwent, Darwen, Darwynne, etc. It is possible, therefore, that\r\nthe family migrated at some unknown date from Yorkshire, Cumberland, or\r\nDerbyshire, where Derwent occurs as the name of a river.\r\n\r\nThe first ancestor of whom we know was one William Darwin, who lived,\r\nabout the year 1500, at Marton, near Gainsborough. His great grandson,\r\nRichard Darwyn, inherited land at Marton and elsewhere, and in his will,\r\ndated 1584, \"bequeathed the sum of 3s. 4d. towards the settynge up of\r\nthe Queene's Majestie's armes over the quearie (choir) doore in the\r\nparishe churche of Marton.\" (We owe a knowledge of these earlier members\r\nof the family to researches amongst the wills at Lincoln, made by the\r\nwell-known genealogist, Colonel Chester.)\r\n\r\nThe son of this Richard, named William Darwin, and described as\r\n\"gentleman,\" appears to have been a successful man. Whilst retaining his\r\nancestral land at Marton, he acquired through his wife and by purchase\r\nan estate at Cleatham, in the parish of Manton, near Kirton Lindsey, and\r\nfixed his residence there. This estate remained in the family down\r\nto the year 1760. A cottage with thick walls, some fish-ponds and old\r\ntrees, now alone show where the \"Old Hall\" once stood, and a field is\r\nstill locally known as the \"Darwin Charity,\" from being subject to a\r\ncharge in favour of the poor of Marton. William Darwin must, at least in\r\npart, have owed his rise in station to his appointment in 1613 by James\r\nI. to the post of Yeoman of the Royal Armoury of Greenwich. The office\r\nappears to have been worth only 33 pounds a year, and the duties were\r\nprobably almost nominal; he held the post down to his death during the\r\nCivil Wars.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this William was a royal servant may explain why his\r\nson, also named William, served when almost a boy for the King, as\r\n\"Captain-Lieutenant\" in Sir William Pelham's troop of horse. On the\r\npartial dispersion of the royal armies, and the retreat of the remainder\r\nto Scotland, the boy's estates were sequestrated by the Parliament, but\r\nthey were redeemed on his signing the Solemn League and Covenant, and on\r\nhis paying a fine which must have struck his finances severely; for in\r\na petition to Charles II. he speaks of his almost utter ruin from having\r\nadhered to the royal cause.\r\n\r\nDuring the Commonwealth, William Darwin became a barrister of Lincoln's\r\nInn, and this circumstance probably led to his marriage with the\r\ndaughter of Erasmus Earle, serjeant-at-law; hence his great-grandson,\r\nErasmus Darwin, the Poet, derived his Christian name. He ultimately\r\nbecame Recorder of the city of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe eldest son of the Recorder, again called William, was born in\r\n1655, and married the heiress of Robert Waring, a member of a good\r\nStaffordshire family. This lady inherited from the family of Lassells,\r\nor Lascelles, the manor and hall of Elston, near Newark, which has\r\nremained ever since in the family. (Captain Lassells, or Lascelles, of\r\nElston was military secretary to Monk, Duke of Albemarle, during the\r\nCivil Wars. A large volume of account books, countersigned in many\r\nplaces by Monk, are now in the possession of my cousin Francis Darwin.\r\nThe accounts might possibly prove of interest to the antiquarian or\r\nhistorian. A portrait of Captain Lassells in armour, although used at\r\none time as an archery-target by some small boys of our name, was not\r\nirretrievably ruined.) A portrait of this William Darwin at Elston shows\r\nhim as a good-looking young man in a full-bottomed wig.\r\n\r\nThis third William had two sons, William, and Robert who was educated\r\nas a barrister. The Cleatham property was left to William, but on the\r\ntermination of his line in daughters reverted to the younger brother,\r\nwho had received Elston. On his mother's death Robert gave up his\r\nprofession and resided ever afterwards at Elston Hall. Of this Robert,\r\nCharles Darwin writes (What follows is quoted from Charles Darwin's\r\nbiography of his grandfather, forming the preliminary notice to Ernst\r\nKrause's interesting essay, 'Erasmus Darwin,' London, 1879, page 4.):--\r\n\r\n\"He seems to have had some taste for science, for he was an early\r\nmember of the well-known Spalding Club; and the celebrated antiquary\r\nDr. Stukeley, in 'An Account of the almost entire Sceleton of a large\r\nAnimal,' etc., published in the 'Philosophical Transactions,' April and\r\nMay 1719, begins the paper as follows: 'Having an account from my friend\r\nRobert Darwin, Esq., of Lincoln's Inn, a person of curiosity, of a human\r\nsceleton impressed in stone, found lately by the rector of Elston,' etc.\r\nStukeley then speaks of it as a great rarity, 'the like whereof has not\r\nbeen observed before in this island to my knowledge.' Judging from a\r\nsort of litany written by Robert, and handed down in the family, he\r\nwas a strong advocate of temperance, which his son ever afterwards so\r\nstrongly advocated:--\r\n\r\n     From a morning that doth shine,\r\n     From a boy that drinketh wine,\r\n     From a wife that talketh Latine,\r\n     Good Lord deliver me!\r\n\r\n\"It is suspected that the third line may be accounted for by his wife,\r\nthe mother of Erasmus, having been a very learned lady. The eldest son\r\nof Robert, christened Robert Waring, succeeded to the estate of Elston,\r\nand died there at the age of ninety-two, a bachelor. He had a strong\r\ntaste for poetry, like his youngest brother Erasmus. Robert also\r\ncultivated botany, and, when an oldish man, he published his 'Principia\r\nBotanica.' This book in MS. was beautifully written, and my father [Dr.\r\nR.W. Darwin] declared that he believed it was published because his old\r\nuncle could not endure that such fine caligraphy should be wasted.\r\nBut this was hardly just, as the work contains many curious notes on\r\nbiology--a subject wholly neglected in England in the last century. The\r\npublic, moreover, appreciated the book, as the copy in my possession is\r\nthe third edition.\"\r\n\r\nThe second son, William Alvey, inherited Elston, and transmitted it to\r\nhis granddaughter, the late Mrs. Darwin, of Elston and Creskeld. A third\r\nson, John, became rector of Elston, the living being in the gift of the\r\nfamily. The fourth son, the youngest child, was Erasmus Darwin, the poet\r\nand philosopher.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF RELATIONSHIP. (An incomplete list of family members.)\r\n\r\nROBERT DARWIN of Elston, 1682-1754, had three sons, William Alvey\r\nDarwin, 1726-1783, Robert Waring Darwin, 1724-1816, and Erasmus Darwin,\r\n1731-1802.\r\n\r\nWilliam Alvey Darwin, 1726-1783, had a son, William Brown Darwin, 1774-\r\n1841, and a daughter, Anne Darwin.\r\n\r\nWilliam Brown Darwin, 1774-1841, had two daughters, Charlotte Darwin and\r\nSarah Darwin.\r\n\r\nCharlotte Darwin married Francis Rhodes, now Francis Darwin of Creskeld\r\nand Elston.\r\n\r\nSarah Darwin married Edward Noel.\r\n\r\nAnne Darwin married Samuel Fox and had a son, William Darwin Fox.\r\n\r\nERASMUS DARWIN, 1731-1802, married (1) MARY HOWARD, 1740-1770, with whom\r\nhe had two sons, Charles Darwin, 1758-1778, and ROBERT WARING DARWIN,\r\nand (2) Eliz. Chandos-Pole, 1747-1832, with whom he had a daughter,\r\nVioletta Darwin, and a son, Francis Sacheverel Darwin.\r\n\r\nROBERT WARING DARWIN, 1767-1848, married SUSANNAH WEDGWOOD and had a\r\nson, CHARLES ROBERT DARWIN, b. February 12, 1809, d. April 19, 1882.\r\n\r\nVioletta Darwin married Samuel Tertius Galton and had a son, Francis\r\nGalton.\r\n\r\nFrancis Sacheverel Darwin, 1786-1859, had two sons, Reginald Darwin and\r\nEdward Darwin, \"High Elms.\"\r\n\r\nThe table above shows Charles Darwin's descent from Robert, and his\r\nrelationship to some other members of the family, whose names occur in\r\nhis correspondence. Among these are included William Darwin Fox, one of\r\nhis earliest correspondents, and Francis Galton, with whom he maintained\r\na warm friendship for many years. Here also occurs the name of Francis\r\nSacheverel Darwin, who inherited a love of natural history from Erasmus,\r\nand transmitted it to his son Edward Darwin, author (under the name of\r\n\"High Elms\") of a 'Gamekeeper's Manual' (4th Edition 1863), which shows\r\nkeen observation of the habits of various animals.\r\n\r\nIt is always interesting to see how far a man's personal characteristics\r\ncan be traced in his forefathers. Charles Darwin inherited the tall\r\nstature, but not the bulky figure of Erasmus; but in his features\r\nthere is no traceable resemblance to those of his grandfather. Nor,\r\nit appears, had Erasmus the love of exercise and of field-sports, so\r\ncharacteristic of Charles Darwin as a young man, though he had, like\r\nhis grandson, an indomitable love of hard mental work. Benevolence and\r\nsympathy with others, and a great personal charm of manner, were common\r\nto the two. Charles Darwin possessed, in the highest degree, that\r\n\"vividness of imagination\" of which he speaks as strongly characteristic\r\nof Erasmus, and as leading \"to his overpowering tendency to theorise\r\nand generalise.\" This tendency, in the case of Charles Darwin, was fully\r\nkept in check by the determination to test his theories to the utmost.\r\nErasmus had a strong love of all kinds of mechanism, for which Charles\r\nDarwin had no taste. Neither had Charles Darwin the literary temperament\r\nwhich made Erasmus a poet as well as a philosopher. He writes of Erasmus\r\n('Life of Erasmus Darwin,' page 68.): \"Throughout his letters I have\r\nbeen struck with his indifference to fame, and the complete absence of\r\nall signs of any over-estimation of his own abilities, or of the success\r\nof his works.\" These, indeed, seem indications of traits most strikingly\r\nprominent in his own character. Yet we get no evidence in Erasmus of\r\nthe intense modesty and simplicity that marked Charles Darwin's whole\r\nnature. But by the quick bursts of anger provoked in Erasmus, at the\r\nsight of any inhumanity or injustice, we are again reminded of him.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, it seems to me that we do not know enough of the\r\nessential personal tone of Erasmus Darwin's character to attempt more\r\nthan a superficial comparison; and I am left with an impression that, in\r\nspite of many resemblances, the two men were of a different type. It\r\nhas been shown that Miss Seward and Mrs. Schimmelpenninck have\r\nmisrepresented Erasmus Darwin's character. (Ibid., pages 77, 79, etc.)\r\nIt is, however, extremely probable that the faults which they exaggerate\r\nwere to some extent characteristic of the man; and this leads me to\r\nthink that Erasmus had a certain acerbity or severity of temper which\r\ndid not exist in his grandson.\r\n\r\nThe sons of Erasmus Darwin inherited in some degree his intellectual\r\ntastes, for Charles Darwin writes of them as follows:\r\n\r\n\"His eldest son, Charles (born September 3, 1758), was a young man of\r\nextraordinary promise, but died (May 15, 1778) before he was twenty-one\r\nyears old, from the effects of a wound received whilst dissecting\r\nthe brain of a child. He inherited from his father a strong taste for\r\nvarious branches of science, for writing verses, and for mechanics...He\r\nalso inherited stammering. With the hope of curing him, his father sent\r\nhim to France, when about eight years old (1766-'67), with a private\r\ntutor, thinking that if he was not allowed to speak English for a time,\r\nthe habit of stammering might be lost; and it is a curious fact, that in\r\nafter years, when speaking French, he never stammered. At a very early\r\nage he collected specimens of all kinds. When sixteen years old he\r\nwas sent for a year to [Christ Church] Oxford, but he did not like the\r\nplace, and thought (in the words of his father) that the 'vigour of his\r\nmind languished in the pursuit of classical elegance like Hercules at\r\nthe distaff, and sighed to be removed to the robuster exercise of\r\nthe medical school of Edinburgh.' He stayed three years at Edinburgh,\r\nworking hard at his medical studies, and attending 'with diligence all\r\nthe sick poor of the parish of Waterleith, and supplying them with the\r\nnecessary medicines.' The Aesculapian Society awarded him its first\r\ngold medal for an experimental inquiry on pus and mucus. Notices of\r\nhim appeared in various journals; and all the writers agree about his\r\nuncommon energy and abilities. He seems like his father to have\r\nexcited the warm affection of his friends. Professor Andrew Duncan...\r\nspoke...about him with the warmest affection forty-seven years after his\r\ndeath when I was a young medical student at Edinburgh...\r\n\r\n\"About the character of his second son, Erasmus (born 1759), I have\r\nlittle to say, for though he wrote poetry, he seems to have had none\r\nof the other tastes of his father. He had, however, his own peculiar\r\ntastes, viz., genealogy, the collecting of coins, and statistics. When\r\na boy he counted all the houses in the city of Lichfield, and found out\r\nthe number of inhabitants in as many as he could; he thus made a census,\r\nand when a real one was first made, his estimate was found to be nearly\r\naccurate. His disposition was quiet and retiring. My father had a very\r\nhigh opinion of his abilities, and this was probably just, for he would\r\nnot otherwise have been invited to travel with, and pay long visits to,\r\nmen so distinguished in different ways as Boulton the engineer, and Day\r\nthe moralist and novelist.\" His death by suicide, in 1799, seems to have\r\ntaken place in a state of incipient insanity.\r\n\r\nRobert Waring, the father of Charles Darwin, was born May 30, 1766, and\r\nentered the medical profession like his father. He studied for a few\r\nmonths at Leyden, and took his M.D. (I owe this information to the\r\nkindness of Professor Rauwenhoff, Director of the Archives at Leyden.\r\nHe quotes from the catalogue of doctors that \"Robertus Waring Darwin,\r\nAnglo-britannus,\" defended (February 26, 1785) in the Senate a\r\nDissertation on the coloured images seen after looking at a bright\r\nobject, and \"Medicinae Doctor creatus est a clar. Paradijs.\" The\r\narchives of Leyden University are so complete that Professor Rauwenhoff\r\nis able to tell me that my grandfather lived together with a certain\r\n\"Petrus Crompton, Anglus,\" in lodgings in the Apothekersdijk. Dr.\r\nDarwin's Leyden dissertation was published in the 'Philosophical\r\nTransactions,' and my father used to say that the work was in fact due\r\nto Erasmus Darwin.--F.D.) at that University on February 26, 1785. \"His\r\nfather\" (Erasmus) \"brought ('Life of Erasmus Darwin,' page 85.) him to\r\nShrewsbury before he was twenty-one years old (1787), and left him 20\r\npounds, saying, 'Let me know when you want more, and I will send it\r\nyou.' His uncle, the rector of Elston, afterwards also sent him\r\n20 pounds, and this was the sole pecuniary aid which he ever\r\nreceived...Erasmus tells Mr. Edgeworth that his son Robert, after being\r\nsettled in Shrewsbury for only six months, 'already had between forty\r\nand fifty patients.' By the second year he was in considerable, and ever\r\nafterwards in very large, practice.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Waring Darwin married (April 18, 1796) Susannah, the daughter\r\nof his father's friend, Josiah Wedgwood, of Etruria, then in her\r\nthirty-second year. We have a miniature of her, with a remarkably sweet\r\nand happy face, bearing some resemblance to the portrait by Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds of her father; a countenance expressive of the gentle and\r\nsympathetic nature which Miss Meteyard ascribes to her. ('A Group of\r\nEnglishmen,' by Miss Meteyard, 1871.) She died July 15, 1817, thirty-two\r\nyears before her husband, whose death occurred on November 13, 1848. Dr.\r\nDarwin lived before his marriage for two or three years on St. John's\r\nHill; afterwards at the Crescent, where his eldest daughter Marianne\r\nwas born; lastly at the \"Mount,\" in the part of Shrewsbury known as\r\nFrankwell, where the other children were born. This house was built\r\nby Dr. Darwin about 1800, it is now in the possession of Mr. Spencer\r\nPhillips, and has undergone but little alteration. It is a large, plain,\r\nsquare, red-brick house, of which the most attractive feature is the\r\npretty green-house, opening out of the morning-room.\r\n\r\nThe house is charmingly placed, on the top of a steep bank leading down\r\nto the Severn. The terraced bank is traversed by a long walk, leading\r\nfrom end to end, still called \"the Doctor's Walk.\" At one point in this\r\nwalk grows a Spanish chestnut, the branches of which bend back parallel\r\nto themselves in a curious manner, and this was Charles Darwin's\r\nfavourite tree as a boy, where he and his sister Catherine had each\r\ntheir special seat.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor took a great pleasure in his garden, planting it with\r\nornamental trees and shrubs, and being especially successful in\r\nfruit-trees; and this love of plants was, I think, the only taste\r\nkindred to natural history which he possessed. Of the \"Mount\r\npigeons,\" which Miss Meteyard describes as illustrating Dr. Darwin's\r\nnatural-history taste, I have not been able to hear from those most\r\ncapable of knowing. Miss Meteyard's account of him is not quite accurate\r\nin a few points. For instance, it is incorrect to describe Dr. Darwin as\r\nhaving a philosophical mind; his was a mind especially given to detail,\r\nand not to generalising. Again, those who knew him intimately describe\r\nhim as eating remarkably little, so that he was not \"a great feeder,\r\neating a goose for his dinner, as easily as other men do a partridge.\"\r\n('A Group of Englishmen,' page 263.) In the matter of dress he was\r\nconservative, and wore to the end of his life knee-breeches and drab\r\ngaiters, which, however, certainly did not, as Miss Meteyard says,\r\nbutton above the knee--a form of costume chiefly known to us in\r\ngrenadiers of Queen Anne's day, and in modern wood-cutters and\r\nploughboys.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin had the strongest feeling of love and respect for his\r\nfather's memory. His recollection of everything that was connected with\r\nhim was peculiarly distinct, and he spoke of him frequently; generally\r\nprefacing an anecdote with some such phrase as, \"My father, who was\r\nthe wisest man I ever knew, etc...\" It was astonishing how clearly he\r\nremembered his father's opinions, so that he was able to quote some\r\nmaxims or hint of his in most cases of illness. As a rule, he put small\r\nfaith in doctors, and thus his unlimited belief in Dr. Darwin's medical\r\ninstinct and methods of treatment was all the more striking.\r\n\r\nHis reverence for him was boundless and most touching. He would have\r\nwished to judge everything else in the world dispassionately, but\r\nanything his father had said was received with almost implicit faith.\r\nHis daughter Mrs. Litchfield remembers him saying that he hoped none\r\nof his sons would ever believe anything because he said it, unless they\r\nwere themselves convinced of its truth,--a feeling in striking contrast\r\nwith his own manner of faith.\r\n\r\nA visit which Charles Darwin made to Shrewsbury in 1869 left on the mind\r\nof his daughter who accompanied him a strong impression of his love for\r\nhis old home. The then tenant of the Mount showed them over the house,\r\netc., and with mistaken hospitality remained with the party during the\r\nwhole visit. As they were leaving, Charles Darwin said, with a pathetic\r\nlook of regret, \"If I could have been left alone in that green-house\r\nfor five minutes, I know I should have been able to see my father in his\r\nwheel-chair as vividly as if he had been there before me.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps this incident shows what I think is the truth, that the memory\r\nof his father he loved the best, was that of him as an old man. Mrs.\r\nLitchfield has noted down a few words which illustrate well his feeling\r\ntowards his father. She describes him as saying with the most tender\r\nrespect, \"I think my father was a little unjust to me when I was young,\r\nbut afterwards I am thankful to think I became a prime favourite with\r\nhim.\" She has a vivid recollection of the expression of happy reverie\r\nthat accompanied these words, as if he were reviewing the whole\r\nrelation, and the remembrance left a deep sense of peace and gratitude.\r\n\r\nWhat follows was added by Charles Darwin to his autobiographical\r\n'Recollections,' and was written about 1877 or 1878.\r\n\r\n\"I may here add a few pages about my father, who was in many ways a\r\nremarkable man.\r\n\r\n\"He was about 6 feet 2 inches in height, with broad shoulders, and very\r\ncorpulent, so that he was the largest man whom I ever saw. When he\r\nlast weighed himself, he was 24 stone, but afterwards increased much in\r\nweight. His chief mental characteristics were his powers of observation\r\nand his sympathy, neither of which have I ever seen exceeded or even\r\nequalled. His sympathy was not only with the distresses of others, but\r\nin a greater degree with the pleasures of all around him. This led him\r\nto be always scheming to give pleasure to others, and, though hating\r\nextravagance, to perform many generous actions. For instance, Mr. B--,\r\na small manufacturer in Shrewsbury, came to him one day, and said he\r\nshould be bankrupt unless he could at once borrow 10,000 pounds, but\r\nthat he was unable to give any legal security. My father heard his\r\nreasons for believing that he could ultimately repay the money, and\r\nfrom [his] intuitive perception of character felt sure that he was to\r\nbe trusted. So he advanced this sum, which was a very large one for him\r\nwhile young, and was after a time repaid.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that it was his sympathy which gave him unbounded power of\r\nwinning confidence, and as a consequence made him highly successful as a\r\nphysician. He began to practise before he was twenty-one years old, and\r\nhis fees during the first year paid for the keep of two horses and a\r\nservant. On the following year his practice was large, and so continued\r\nfor about sixty years, when he ceased to attend on any one. His great\r\nsuccess as a doctor was the more remarkable, as he told me that he\r\nat first hated his profession so much that if he had been sure of the\r\nsmallest pittance, or if his father had given him any choice, nothing\r\nshould have induced him to follow it. To the end of his life, the\r\nthought of an operation almost sickened him, and he could scarcely\r\nendure to see a person bled--a horror which he has transmitted to\r\nme--and I remember the horror which I felt as a schoolboy in reading\r\nabout Pliny (I think) bleeding to death in a warm bath...\r\n\r\n\"Owing to my father's power of winning confidence, many patients,\r\nespecially ladies, consulted him when suffering from any misery, as\r\na sort of Father-Confessor. He told me that they always began by\r\ncomplaining in a vague manner about their health, and by practice he\r\nsoon guessed what was really the matter. He then suggested that they\r\nhad been suffering in their minds, and now they would pour out their\r\ntroubles, and he heard nothing more about the body...Owing to\r\nmy father's skill in winning confidence he received many strange\r\nconfessions of misery and guilt. He often remarked how many miserable\r\nwives he had known. In several instances husbands and wives had gone on\r\npretty well together for between twenty and thirty years, and then hated\r\neach other bitterly; this he attributed to their having lost a common\r\nbond in their young children having grown up.\r\n\r\n\"But the most remarkable power which my father possessed was that of\r\nreading the characters, and even the thoughts of those whom he saw even\r\nfor a short time. We had many instances of the power, some of which\r\nseemed almost supernatural. It saved my father from ever making (with\r\none exception, and the character of this man was soon discovered) an\r\nunworthy friend. A strange clergyman came to Shrewsbury, and seemed\r\nto be a rich man; everybody called on him, and he was invited to many\r\nhouses. My father called, and on his return home told my sisters on no\r\naccount to invite him or his family to our house; for he felt sure that\r\nthe man was not to be trusted. After a few months he suddenly bolted,\r\nbeing heavily in debt, and was found out to be little better than an\r\nhabitual swindler. Here is a case of trustfulness which not many men\r\nwould have ventured on. An Irish gentleman, a complete stranger, called\r\non my father one day, and said that he had lost his purse, and that it\r\nwould be a serious inconvenience to him to wait in Shrewsbury until he\r\ncould receive a remittance from Ireland. He then asked my father to lend\r\nhim 20 pounds, which was immediately done, as my father felt certain\r\nthat the story was a true one. As soon as a letter could arrive from\r\nIreland, one came with the most profuse thanks, and enclosing, as he\r\nsaid, a 20 pound Bank of England note, but no note was enclosed. I asked\r\nmy father whether this did not stagger him, but he answered 'not in\r\nthe least.' On the next day another letter came with many apologies for\r\nhaving forgotten (like a true Irishman) to put the note into his letter\r\nof the day before...(A gentleman) brought his nephew, who was insane\r\nbut quite gentle, to my father; and the young man's insanity led him to\r\naccuse himself of all the crimes under heaven. When my father afterwards\r\ntalked over the matter with the uncle, he said, 'I am sure that your\r\nnephew is really guilty of...a heinous crime.' Whereupon [the gentleman]\r\nsaid, 'Good God, Dr. Darwin, who told you; we thought that no human\r\nbeing knew the fact except ourselves!' My father told me the story many\r\nyears after the event, and I asked him how he distinguished the true\r\nfrom the false self-accusations; and it was very characteristic of my\r\nfather that he said he could not explain how it was.\r\n\r\n\"The following story shows what good guesses my father could make. Lord\r\nShelburne, afterwards the first Marquis of Lansdowne, was famous (as\r\nMacaulay somewhere remarks) for his knowledge of the affairs of Europe,\r\non which he greatly prided himself. He consulted my father medically,\r\nand afterwards harangued him on the state of Holland. My father had\r\nstudied medicine at Leyden, and one day [while there] went a long walk\r\ninto the country with a friend who took him to the house of a clergyman\r\n(we will say the Rev. Mr. A--, for I have forgotten his name), who had\r\nmarried an Englishwoman. My father was very hungry, and there was little\r\nfor luncheon except cheese, which he could never eat. The old lady was\r\nsurprised and grieved at this, and assured my father that it was an\r\nexcellent cheese, and had been sent her from Bowood, the seat of Lord\r\nShelburne. My father wondered why a cheese should be sent her from\r\nBowood, but thought nothing more about it until it flashed across his\r\nmind many years afterwards, whilst Lord Shelburne was talking about\r\nHolland. So he answered, 'I should think from what I saw of the Rev. Mr.\r\nA--, that he was a very able man, and well acquainted with the state\r\nof Holland.' My father saw that the Earl, who immediately changed the\r\nconversation was much startled. On the next morning my father received a\r\nnote from the Earl, saying that he had delayed starting on his journey,\r\nand wished particularly to see my father. When he called, the Earl said,\r\n'Dr. Darwin, it is of the utmost importance to me and to the Rev.\r\nMr. A-- to learn how you have discovered that he is the source of my\r\ninformation about Holland.' So my father had to explain the state of\r\nthe case, and he supposed that Lord Shelburne was much struck with\r\nhis diplomatic skill in guessing, for during many years afterwards he\r\nreceived many kind messages from him through various friends. I think\r\nthat he must have told the story to his children; for Sir C. Lyell asked\r\nme many years ago why the Marquis of Lansdowne (the son or grand-son\r\nof the first marquis) felt so much interest about me, whom he had never\r\nseen, and my family. When forty new members (the forty thieves as they\r\nwere then called) were added to the Athenaeum Club, there was much\r\ncanvassing to be one of them; and without my having asked any one,\r\nLord Lansdowne proposed me and got me elected. If I am right in my\r\nsupposition, it was a queer concatenation of events that my father not\r\neating cheese half-a-century before in Holland led to my election as a\r\nmember of the Athenaeum.\r\n\r\n\"The sharpness of his observation led him to predict with remarkable\r\nskill the course of any illness, and he suggested endless small details\r\nof relief. I was told that a young doctor in Shrewsbury, who disliked my\r\nfather, used to say that he was wholly unscientific, but owned that his\r\npower of predicting the end of an illness was unparalleled. Formerly\r\nwhen he thought that I should be a doctor, he talked much to me about\r\nhis patients. In the old days the practice of bleeding largely was\r\nuniversal, but my father maintained that far more evil was thus caused\r\nthan good done; and he advised me if ever I was myself ill not to allow\r\nany doctor to take more than an extremely small quantity of blood. Long\r\nbefore typhoid fever was recognised as distinct, my father told me that\r\ntwo utterly distinct kinds of illness were confounded under the name\r\nof typhus fever. He was vehement against drinking, and was convinced of\r\nboth the direct and inherited evil effects of alcohol when habitually\r\ntaken even in moderate quantity in a very large majority of cases. But\r\nhe admitted and advanced instances of certain persons who could drink\r\nlargely during their whole lives without apparently suffering any evil\r\neffects, and he believed that he could often beforehand tell who would\r\nthus not suffer. He himself never drank a drop of any alcoholic fluid.\r\nThis remark reminds me of a case showing how a witness under the most\r\nfavourable circumstances may be utterly mistaken. A gentleman-farmer was\r\nstrongly urged by my father not to drink, and was encouraged by being\r\ntold that he himself never touched any spirituous liquor. Whereupon the\r\ngentleman said, 'Come, come, Doctor, this won't do--though it is very\r\nkind of you to say so for my sake--for I know that you take a very\r\nlarge glass of hot gin and water every evening after your dinner.' (This\r\nbelief still survives, and was mentioned to my brother in 1884 by an\r\nold inhabitant of Shrewsbury.--F.D.) So my father asked him how he knew\r\nthis. The man answered, 'My cook was your kitchen-maid for two or three\r\nyears, and she saw the butler every day prepare and take to you the\r\ngin and water.' The explanation was that my father had the odd habit of\r\ndrinking hot water in a very tall and large glass after his dinner; and\r\nthe butler used first to put some cold water in the glass, which the\r\ngirl mistook for gin, and then filled it up with boiling water from the\r\nkitchen boiler.\r\n\r\n\"My father used to tell me many little things which he had found useful\r\nin his medical practice. Thus ladies often cried much while telling him\r\ntheir troubles, and thus caused much loss of his precious time. He soon\r\nfound that begging them to command and restrain themselves, always made\r\nthem weep the more, so that afterwards he always encouraged them to go\r\non crying, saying that this would relieve them more than anything else,\r\nand with the invariable result that they soon ceased to cry, and he\r\ncould hear what they had to say and give his advice. When patients who\r\nwere very ill craved for some strange and unnatural food, my father\r\nasked them what had put such an idea into their heads; if they answered\r\nthat they did not know, he would allow them to try the food, and often\r\nwith success, as he trusted to their having a kind of instinctive\r\ndesire; but if they answered that they had heard that the food in\r\nquestion had done good to some one else, he firmly refused his assent.\r\n\r\n\"He gave one day an odd little specimen of human nature. When a very\r\nyoung man he was called in to consult with the family physician in the\r\ncase of a gentleman of much distinction in Shropshire. The old doctor\r\ntold the wife that the illness was of such a nature that it must\r\nend fatally. My father took a different view and maintained that the\r\ngentleman would recover: he was proved quite wrong in all respects (I\r\nthink by autopsy) and he owned his error. He was then convinced that he\r\nshould never again be consulted by this family; but after a few months\r\nthe widow sent for him, having dismissed the old family doctor. My\r\nfather was so much surprised at this, that he asked a friend of the\r\nwidow to find out why he was again consulted. The widow answered her\r\nfriend, that 'she would never again see the odious old doctor who said\r\nfrom the first that her husband would die, while Dr. Darwin always\r\nmaintained that he would recover!' In another case my father told a lady\r\nthat her husband would certainly die. Some months afterwards he saw\r\nthe widow, who was a very sensible woman, and she said, 'You are a very\r\nyoung man, and allow me to advise you always to give, as long as you\r\npossibly can, hope to any near relative nursing a patient. You made me\r\ndespair, and from that moment I lost strength.' My father said that\r\nhe had often since seen the paramount importance, for the sake of the\r\npatient, of keeping up the hope and with it the strength of the nurse in\r\ncharge. This he sometimes found difficult to do compatibly with truth.\r\nOne old gentleman, however, caused him no such perplexity. He was sent\r\nfor by Mr.P--, who said, 'From all that I have seen and heard of you I\r\nbelieve that you are the sort of man who will speak the truth, and if I\r\nask, you will tell me when I am dying. Now I much desire that you should\r\nattend me, if you will promise, whatever I may say, always to declare\r\nthat I am not going to die.' My father acquiesced on the understanding\r\nthat his words should in fact have no meaning.\r\n\r\n\"My father possessed an extraordinary memory, especially for dates, so\r\nthat he knew, when he was very old, the day of the birth, marriage, and\r\ndeath of a multitude of persons in Shropshire; and he once told me that\r\nthis power annoyed him; for if he once heard a date, he could not forget\r\nit; and thus the deaths of many friends were often recalled to his mind.\r\nOwing to his strong memory he knew an extraordinary number of curious\r\nstories, which he liked to tell, as he was a great talker. He was\r\ngenerally in high spirits, and laughed and joked with every one--often\r\nwith his servants--with the utmost freedom; yet he had the art of making\r\nevery one obey him to the letter. Many persons were much afraid of him.\r\nI remember my father telling us one day, with a laugh, that several\r\npersons had asked him whether Miss --, a grand old lady in Shropshire,\r\nhad called on him, so that at last he enquired why they asked him; and\r\nhe was told that Miss --, whom my father had somehow mortally offended,\r\nwas telling everybody that she would call and tell 'that fat old doctor\r\nvery plainly what she thought of him.' She had already called, but\r\nher courage had failed, and no one could have been more courteous and\r\nfriendly. As a boy, I went to stay at the house of --, whose wife was\r\ninsane; and the poor creature, as soon as she saw me, was in the most\r\nabject state of terror that I ever saw, weeping bitterly and asking me\r\nover and over again, 'Is your father coming?' but was soon pacified.\r\nOn my return home, I asked my father why she was so frightened, and\r\nhe answered he was very glad to hear it, as he had frightened her on\r\npurpose, feeling sure that she would be kept in safety and much happier\r\nwithout any restraint, if her husband could influence her, whenever she\r\nbecame at all violent, by proposing to send for Dr. Darwin; and these\r\nwords succeeded perfectly during the rest of her long life.\r\n\r\n\"My father was very sensitive, so that many small events annoyed him or\r\npained him much. I once asked him, when he was old and could not walk,\r\nwhy he did not drive out for exercise; and he answered, 'Every road out\r\nof Shrewsbury is associated in my mind with some painful event.' Yet he\r\nwas generally in high spirits. He was easily made very angry, but his\r\nkindness was unbounded. He was widely and deeply loved.\r\n\r\n\"He was a cautious and good man of business, so that he hardly ever lost\r\nmoney by an investment, and left to his children a very large property.\r\nI remember a story showing how easily utterly false beliefs originate\r\nand spread. Mr. E --, a squire of one of the oldest families in\r\nShropshire, and head partner in a bank, committed suicide. My father was\r\nsent for as a matter of form, and found him dead. I may mention, by the\r\nway, to show how matters were managed in those old days, that because\r\nMr. E -- was a rather great man, and universally respected, no inquest\r\nwas held over his body. My father, in returning home, thought it proper\r\nto call at the bank (where he had an account) to tell the managing\r\npartners of the event, as it was not improbable that it would cause a\r\nrun on the bank. Well, the story was spread far and wide, that my father\r\nwent into the bank, drew out all his money, left the bank, came back\r\nagain, and said, 'I may just tell you that Mr. E -- has killed himself,'\r\nand then departed. It seems that it was then a common belief that money\r\nwithdrawn from a bank was not safe until the person had passed out\r\nthrough the door of the bank. My father did not hear this story till\r\nsome little time afterwards, when the managing partner said that he had\r\ndeparted from his invariable rule of never allowing any one to see the\r\naccount of another man, by having shown the ledger with my father's\r\naccount to several persons, as this proved that my father had not drawn\r\nout a penny on that day. It would have been dishonourable in my father\r\nto have used his professional knowledge for his private advantage.\r\nNevertheless, the supposed act was greatly admired by some persons;\r\nand many years afterwards, a gentleman remarked, 'Ah, Doctor, what a\r\nsplendid man of business you were in so cleverly getting all your money\r\nsafe out of that bank!'\r\n\r\n\"My father's mind was not scientific, and he did not try to generalize\r\nhis knowledge under general laws; yet he formed a theory for almost\r\neverything which occurred. I do not think I gained much from him\r\nintellectually; but his example ought to have been of much moral service\r\nto all his children. One of his golden rules (a hard one to follow) was,\r\n'Never become the friend of any one whom you cannot respect.'\"\r\n\r\nDr. Darwin had six children (Of these Mrs. Wedgwood is now the sole\r\nsurvivor.): Marianne, married Dr. Henry Parker; Caroline, married\r\nJosiah Wedgwood; Erasmus Alvey; Susan, died unmarried; Charles Robert;\r\nCatherine, married Rev. Charles Langton.\r\n\r\nThe elder son, Erasmus, was born in 1804, and died unmarried at the age\r\nof seventy-seven.\r\n\r\nHe, like his brother, was educated at Shrewsbury School and at Christ's\r\nCollege, Cambridge. He studied medicine at Edinburgh and in London, and\r\ntook the degree of Bachelor of Medicine at Cambridge. He never made any\r\npretence of practising as a doctor, and, after leaving Cambridge, lived\r\na quiet life in London.\r\n\r\nThere was something pathetic in Charles Darwin's affection for his\r\nbrother Erasmus, as if he always recollected his solitary life, and the\r\ntouching patience and sweetness of his nature. He often spoke of him\r\nas \"Poor old Ras,\" or \"Poor dear old Philos\"--I imagine Philos\r\n(Philosopher) was a relic of the days when they worked at chemistry\r\nin the tool-house at Shrewsbury--a time of which he always preserved a\r\npleasant memory. Erasmus being rather more than four years older than\r\nCharles Darwin, they were not long together at Cambridge, but previously\r\nat Edinburgh they lived in the same lodgings, and after the Voyage they\r\nlived for a time together in Erasmus' house in Great Marlborough Street.\r\nAt this time also he often speaks with much affection of Erasmus in his\r\nletters to Fox, using words such as \"my dear good old brother.\" In later\r\nyears Erasmus Darwin came to Down occasionally, or joined his brother's\r\nfamily in a summer holiday. But gradually it came about that he could\r\nnot, through ill health, make up his mind to leave London, and then they\r\nonly saw each other when Charles Darwin went for a week at a time to his\r\nbrother's house in Queen Anne Street.\r\n\r\nThe following note on his brother's character was written by Charles\r\nDarwin at about the same time that the sketch of his father was added to\r\nthe 'Recollections.':--\r\n\r\n\"My brother Erasmus possessed a remarkably clear mind with extensive\r\nand diversified tastes and knowledge in literature, art, and even in\r\nscience. For a short time he collected and dried plants, and during\r\na somewhat longer time experimented in chemistry. He was extremely\r\nagreeable, and his wit often reminded me of that in the letters and\r\nworks of Charles Lamb. He was very kind-hearted...His health from his\r\nboyhood had been weak, and as a consequence he failed in energy. His\r\nspirits were not high, sometimes low, more especially during early\r\nand middle manhood. He read much, even whilst a boy, and at school\r\nencouraged me to read, lending me books. Our minds and tastes\r\nwere, however, so different, that I do not think I owe much to him\r\nintellectually. I am inclined to agree with Francis Galton in believing\r\nthat education and environment produce only a small effect on the mind\r\nof any one, and that most of our qualities are innate.\"\r\n\r\nErasmus Darwin's name, though not known to the general public, may\r\nbe remembered from the sketch of his character in Carlyle's\r\n'Reminiscences,' which I here reproduce in part:--\r\n\r\n\"Erasmus Darwin, a most diverse kind of mortal, came to seek us out very\r\nsoon ('had heard of Carlyle in Germany, etc.') and continues ever\r\nsince to be a quiet house-friend, honestly attached; though his visits\r\nlatterly have been rarer and rarer, health so poor, I so occupied, etc.,\r\netc. He had something of original and sarcastically ingenious in him,\r\none of the sincerest, naturally truest, and most modest of men; elder\r\nbrother of Charles Darwin (the famed Darwin on Species of these days) to\r\nwhom I rather prefer him for intellect, had not his health quite doomed\r\nhim to silence and patient idleness...My dear one had a great favour for\r\nthis honest Darwin always; many a road, to shops and the like, he drove\r\nher in his cab (Darwingium Cabbum comparable to Georgium Sidus) in those\r\nearly days when even the charge of omnibuses was a consideration, and\r\nhis sparse utterances, sardonic often, were a great amusement to her. 'A\r\nperfect gentleman,' she at once discerned him to be, and of sound worth\r\nand kindliness in the most unaffected form.\" (Carlyle's 'Reminiscences,'\r\nvol. ii. page 208.)\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin did not appreciate this sketch of his brother; he thought\r\nCarlyle had missed the essence of his most lovable nature.\r\n\r\nI am tempted by the wish of illustrating further the character of one\r\nso sincerely beloved by all Charles Darwin's children, to reproduce a\r\nletter to the \"Spectator\" (September 3, 1881) by his cousin Miss Julia\r\nWedgwood.\r\n\r\n\"A portrait from Mr. Carlyle's portfolio not regretted by any who loved\r\nthe original, surely confers sufficient distinction to warrant a few\r\nwords of notice, when the character it depicts is withdrawn from mortal\r\ngaze. Erasmus, the only brother of Charles Darwin, and the faithful\r\nand affectionate old friend of both the Carlyles, has left a circle of\r\nmourners who need no tribute from illustrious pen to embalm the memory\r\nso dear to their hearts; but a wider circle must have felt some interest\r\nexcited by that tribute, and may receive with a certain attention the\r\nrecord of a unique and indelible impression, even though it be made only\r\non the hearts of those who cannot bequeath it, and with whom, therefore,\r\nit must speedily pass away. They remember it with the same distinctness\r\nas they remember a creation of genius; it has in like manner enriched\r\nand sweetened life, formed a common meeting-point for those who had\r\nno other; and, in its strong fragrance of individuality, enforced that\r\nrespect for the idiosyncracies of human character without which moral\r\njudgment is always hard and shallow, and often unjust. Carlyle was one\r\nto find a peculiar enjoyment in the combination of liveliness and repose\r\nwhich gave his friend's society an influence at once stimulating and\r\nsoothing, and the warmth of his appreciation was not made known first\r\nin its posthumous expression; his letters of anxiety nearly thirty\r\nyears ago, when the frail life which has been prolonged to old age\r\nwas threatened by serious illness, are still fresh in my memory. The\r\nfriendship was equally warm with both husband and wife. I remember\r\nwell a pathetic little remonstrance from her elicited by an avowal from\r\nErasmus Darwin, that he preferred cats to dogs, which she felt a slur\r\non her little 'Nero;' and the tones in which she said, 'Oh, but you\r\nare fond of dogs! you are too kind not to be,' spoke of a long vista of\r\nsmall, gracious kindnesses, remembered with a tender gratitude. He was\r\nintimate also with a person whose friends, like those of Mr. Carlyle,\r\nhave not always had cause to congratulate themselves on their place in\r\nher gallery,--Harriet Martineau. I have heard him more than once call\r\nher a faithful friend, and it always seemed to me a curious tribute\r\nto something in the friendship that he alone supplied; but if she had\r\nwritten of him at all, I believe the mention, in its heartiness of\r\nappreciation, would have afforded a rare and curious meeting-point with\r\nthe other 'Reminiscences,' so like and yet so unlike. It is not possible\r\nto transfer the impression of a character; we can only suggest it by\r\nmeans of some resemblance; and it is a singular illustration of that\r\nirony which checks or directs our sympathies, that in trying to give\r\nsome notion of the man whom, among those who were not his kindred,\r\nCarlyle appears to have most loved, I can say nothing more descriptive\r\nthan that he seems to me to have had something in common with the man\r\nwhom Carlyle least appreciated. The society of Erasmus Darwin had, to my\r\nmind, much the same charm as the writings of Charles Lamb. There was\r\nthe same kind of playfulness, the same lightness of touch, the same\r\ntenderness, perhaps the same limitations. On another side of his nature,\r\nI have often been reminded of him by the quaint, delicate humour, the\r\nsuperficial intolerance, the deep springs of pity, the peculiar mixture\r\nof something pathetic with a sort of gay scorn, entirely remote from\r\ncontempt, which distinguish the Ellesmere of Sir Arthur Helps' earlier\r\ndialogues. Perhaps we recall such natures most distinctly, when such a\r\nresemblance is all that is left of them. The character is not merged\r\nin the creation; and what we lose in the power to communicate our\r\nimpression, we seem to gain in its vividness. Erasmus Darwin has\r\npassed away in old age, yet his memory retains something of a youthful\r\nfragrance; his influence gave much happiness, of a kind usually\r\nassociated with youth, to many lives besides the illustrious one whose\r\nrecords justify, though certainly they do not inspire, the wish to place\r\nthis fading chaplet on his grave.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing pages give, in a fragmentary manner, as much perhaps as\r\nneed be told of the family from which Charles Darwin came, and may serve\r\nas an introduction to the autobiographical chapter which follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.II. -- AUTOBIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n[My father's autobiographical recollections, given in the present\r\nchapter, were written for his children,--and written without any\r\nthought that they would ever be published. To many this may seem an\r\nimpossibility; but those who knew my father will understand how it was\r\nnot only possible, but natural. The autobiography bears the heading,\r\n'Recollections of the Development of my Mind and Character,' and end\r\nwith the following note:--\r\n\r\n\"Aug.3, 1876. This sketch of my life was begun about May 28th at\r\nHopedene (Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood's house in Surrey.), and since then I\r\nhave written for nearly an hour on most afternoons.\" It will easily be\r\nunderstood that, in a narrative of a personal and intimate kind written\r\nfor his wife and children, passages should occur which must here be\r\nomitted; and I have not thought it necessary to indicate where\r\nsuch omissions are made. It has been found necessary to make a few\r\ncorrections of obvious verbal slips, but the number of such alterations\r\nhas been kept down to the minimum.--F.D.]\r\n\r\nA German Editor having written to me for an account of the development\r\nof my mind and character with some sketch of my autobiography, I have\r\nthought that the attempt would amuse me, and might possibly interest\r\nmy children or their children. I know that it would have interested me\r\ngreatly to have read even so short and dull a sketch of the mind of my\r\ngrandfather, written by himself, and what he thought and did, and how he\r\nworked. I have attempted to write the following account of myself, as if\r\nI were a dead man in another world looking back at my own life. Nor have\r\nI found this difficult, for life is nearly over with me. I have taken no\r\npains about my style of writing.\r\n\r\nI was born at Shrewsbury on February 12th, 1809, and my earliest\r\nrecollection goes back only to when I was a few months over four years\r\nold, when we went to near Abergele for sea-bathing, and I recollect some\r\nevents and places there with some little distinctness.\r\n\r\nMy mother died in July 1817, when I was a little over eight years old,\r\nand it is odd that I can remember hardly anything about her except\r\nher death-bed, her black velvet gown, and her curiously constructed\r\nwork-table. In the spring of this same year I was sent to a day-school\r\nin Shrewsbury, where I stayed a year. I have been told that I was much\r\nslower in learning than my younger sister Catherine, and I believe that\r\nI was in many ways a naughty boy.\r\n\r\nBy the time I went to this day-school (Kept by Rev. G. Case, minister of\r\nthe Unitarian Chapel in the High Street. Mrs. Darwin was a Unitarian\r\nand attended Mr. Case's chapel, and my father as a little boy went there\r\nwith his elder sisters. But both he and his brother were christened and\r\nintended to belong to the Church of England; and after his early boyhood\r\nhe seems usually to have gone to church and not to Mr. Case's. It\r\nappears (\"St. James' Gazette\", Dec. 15, 1883) that a mural tablet has\r\nbeen erected to his memory in the chapel, which is now known as the\r\n'Free Christian Church.') my taste for natural history, and more\r\nespecially for collecting, was well developed. I tried to make out\r\nthe names of plants (Rev. W.A. Leighton, who was a schoolfellow of my\r\nfather's at Mr. Case's school, remembers his bringing a flower to school\r\nand saying that his mother had taught him how by looking at the inside\r\nof the blossom the name of the plant could be discovered. Mr. Leighton\r\ngoes on, \"This greatly roused my attention and curiosity, and I enquired\r\nof him repeatedly how this could be done?\"--but his lesson was naturally\r\nenough not transmissible.--F.D.), and collected all sorts of things,\r\nshells, seals, franks, coins, and minerals. The passion for collecting\r\nwhich leads a man to be a systematic naturalist, a virtuoso, or a miser,\r\nwas very strong in me, and was clearly innate, as none of my sisters or\r\nbrother ever had this taste.\r\n\r\nOne little event during this year has fixed itself very firmly in my\r\nmind, and I hope that it has done so from my conscience having been\r\nafterwards sorely troubled by it; it is curious as showing that\r\napparently I was interested at this early age in the variability of\r\nplants! I told another little boy (I believe it was Leighton, who\r\nafterwards became a well-known lichenologist and botanist), that I could\r\nproduce variously coloured polyanthuses and primroses by watering them\r\nwith certain coloured fluids, which was of course a monstrous fable, and\r\nhad never been tried by me. I may here also confess that as a little boy\r\nI was much given to inventing deliberate falsehoods, and this was always\r\ndone for the sake of causing excitement. For instance, I once gathered\r\nmuch valuable fruit from my father's trees and hid it in the shrubbery,\r\nand then ran in breathless haste to spread the news that I had\r\ndiscovered a hoard of stolen fruit.\r\n\r\nI must have been a very simple little fellow when I first went to the\r\nschool. A boy of the name of Garnett took me into a cake shop one day,\r\nand bought some cakes for which he did not pay, as the shopman trusted\r\nhim. When we came out I asked him why he did not pay for them, and he\r\ninstantly answered, \"Why, do you not know that my uncle left a great\r\nsum of money to the town on condition that every tradesman should give\r\nwhatever was wanted without payment to any one who wore his old hat and\r\nmoved [it] in a particular manner?\" and he then showed me how it was\r\nmoved. He then went into another shop where he was trusted, and asked\r\nfor some small article, moving his hat in the proper manner, and of\r\ncourse obtained it without payment. When we came out he said, \"Now if\r\nyou like to go by yourself into that cake-shop (how well I remember its\r\nexact position) I will lend you my hat, and you can get whatever you\r\nlike if you move the hat on your head properly.\" I gladly accepted the\r\ngenerous offer, and went in and asked for some cakes, moved the old hat\r\nand was walking out of the shop, when the shopman made a rush at me, so\r\nI dropped the cakes and ran for dear life, and was astonished by being\r\ngreeted with shouts of laughter by my false friend Garnett.\r\n\r\nI can say in my own favour that I was as a boy humane, but I owed this\r\nentirely to the instruction and example of my sisters. I doubt indeed\r\nwhether humanity is a natural or innate quality. I was very fond of\r\ncollecting eggs, but I never took more than a single egg out of a bird's\r\nnest, except on one single occasion, when I took all, not for their\r\nvalue, but from a sort of bravado.\r\n\r\nI had a strong taste for angling, and would sit for any number of hours\r\non the bank of a river or pond watching the float; when at Maer (The\r\nhouse of his uncle, Josiah Wedgwood.) I was told that I could kill the\r\nworms with salt and water, and from that day I never spitted a living\r\nworm, though at the expense probably of some loss of success.\r\n\r\nOnce as a very little boy whilst at the day school, or before that time,\r\nI acted cruelly, for I beat a puppy, I believe, simply from enjoying\r\nthe sense of power; but the beating could not have been severe, for\r\nthe puppy did not howl, of which I feel sure, as the spot was near\r\nthe house. This act lay heavily on my conscience, as is shown by my\r\nremembering the exact spot where the crime was committed. It probably\r\nlay all the heavier from my love of dogs being then, and for a long time\r\nafterwards, a passion. Dogs seemed to know this, for I was an adept in\r\nrobbing their love from their masters.\r\n\r\nI remember clearly only one other incident during this year whilst at\r\nMr. Case's daily school,--namely, the burial of a dragoon soldier; and\r\nit is surprising how clearly I can still see the horse with the man's\r\nempty boots and carbine suspended to the saddle, and the firing over the\r\ngrave. This scene deeply stirred whatever poetic fancy there was in me.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1818 I went to Dr. Butler's great school in Shrewsbury,\r\nand remained there for seven years still Midsummer 1825, when I was\r\nsixteen years old. I boarded at this school, so that I had the great\r\nadvantage of living the life of a true schoolboy; but as the distance\r\nwas hardly more than a mile to my home, I very often ran there in the\r\nlonger intervals between the callings over and before locking up at\r\nnight. This, I think, was in many ways advantageous to me by keeping up\r\nhome affections and interests. I remember in the early part of my school\r\nlife that I often had to run very quickly to be in time, and from being\r\na fleet runner was generally successful; but when in doubt I prayed\r\nearnestly to God to help me, and I well remember that I attributed my\r\nsuccess to the prayers and not to my quick running, and marvelled how\r\ngenerally I was aided.\r\n\r\nI have heard my father and elder sister say that I had, as a very young\r\nboy, a strong taste for long solitary walks; but what I thought about I\r\nknow not. I often became quite absorbed, and once, whilst returning to\r\nschool on the summit of the old fortifications round Shrewsbury, which\r\nhad been converted into a public foot-path with no parapet on one side,\r\nI walked off and fell to the ground, but the height was only seven or\r\neight feet. Nevertheless the number of thoughts which passed through my\r\nmind during this very short, but sudden and wholly unexpected fall, was\r\nastonishing, and seem hardly compatible with what physiologists have, I\r\nbelieve, proved about each thought requiring quite an appreciable amount\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been worse for the development of my mind than\r\nDr. Butler's school, as it was strictly classical, nothing else being\r\ntaught, except a little ancient geography and history. The school as a\r\nmeans of education to me was simply a blank. During my whole life I have\r\nbeen singularly incapable of mastering any language. Especial attention\r\nwas paid to verse-making, and this I could never do well. I had many\r\nfriends, and got together a good collection of old verses, which by\r\npatching together, sometimes aided by other boys, I could work into any\r\nsubject. Much attention was paid to learning by heart the lessons of the\r\nprevious day; this I could effect with great facility, learning forty or\r\nfifty lines of Virgil or Homer, whilst I was in morning chapel; but\r\nthis exercise was utterly useless, for every verse was forgotten\r\nin forty-eight hours. I was not idle, and with the exception of\r\nversification, generally worked conscientiously at my classics, not\r\nusing cribs. The sole pleasure I ever received from such studies, was\r\nfrom some of the odes of Horace, which I admired greatly.\r\n\r\nWhen I left the school I was for my age neither high nor low in it; and\r\nI believe that I was considered by all my masters and by my father as a\r\nvery ordinary boy, rather below the common standard in intellect. To my\r\ndeep mortification my father once said to me, \"You care for nothing but\r\nshooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to yourself\r\nand all your family.\" But my father, who was the kindest man I ever\r\nknew and whose memory I love with all my heart, must have been angry and\r\nsomewhat unjust when he used such words.\r\n\r\nLooking back as well as I can at my character during my school life, the\r\nonly qualities which at this period promised well for the future,\r\nwere, that I had strong and diversified tastes, much zeal for whatever\r\ninterested me, and a keen pleasure in understanding any complex subject\r\nor thing. I was taught Euclid by a private tutor, and I distinctly\r\nremember the intense satisfaction which the clear geometrical proofs\r\ngave me. I remember, with equal distinctness, the delight which my uncle\r\ngave me (the father of Francis Galton) by explaining the principle\r\nof the vernier of a barometer with respect to diversified tastes,\r\nindependently of science, I was fond of reading various books, and\r\nI used to sit for hours reading the historical plays of Shakespeare,\r\ngenerally in an old window in the thick walls of the school. I read also\r\nother poetry, such as Thomson's 'Seasons,' and the recently published\r\npoems of Byron and Scott. I mention this because later in life I\r\nwholly lost, to my great regret, all pleasure from poetry of any kind,\r\nincluding Shakespeare. In connection with pleasure from poetry, I may\r\nadd that in 1822 a vivid delight in scenery was first awakened in my\r\nmind, during a riding tour on the borders of Wales, and this has lasted\r\nlonger than any other aesthetic pleasure.\r\n\r\nEarly in my school days a boy had a copy of the 'Wonders of the World,'\r\nwhich I often read, and disputed with other boys about the veracity of\r\nsome of the statements; and I believe that this book first gave me a\r\nwish to travel in remote countries, which was ultimately fulfilled\r\nby the voyage of the \"Beagle\". In the latter part of my school life\r\nI became passionately fond of shooting; I do not believe that any\r\none could have shown more zeal for the most holy cause than I did for\r\nshooting birds. How well I remember killing my first snipe, and my\r\nexcitement was so great that I had much difficulty in reloading my gun\r\nfrom the trembling of my hands. This taste long continued, and I became\r\na very good shot. When at Cambridge I used to practise throwing up my\r\ngun to my shoulder before a looking-glass to see that I threw it up\r\nstraight. Another and better plan was to get a friend to wave about a\r\nlighted candle, and then to fire at it with a cap on the nipple, and if\r\nthe aim was accurate the little puff of air would blow out the candle.\r\nThe explosion of the cap caused a sharp crack, and I was told that the\r\ntutor of the college remarked, \"What an extraordinary thing it is, Mr.\r\nDarwin seems to spend hours in cracking a horse-whip in his room, for I\r\noften hear the crack when I pass under his windows.\"\r\n\r\nI had many friends amongst the schoolboys, whom I loved dearly, and I\r\nthink that my disposition was then very affectionate.\r\n\r\nWith respect to science, I continued collecting minerals with much\r\nzeal, but quite unscientifically--all that I cared about was a new-NAMED\r\nmineral, and I hardly attempted to classify them. I must have observed\r\ninsects with some little care, for when ten years old (1819) I went for\r\nthree weeks to Plas Edwards on the sea-coast in Wales, I was very much\r\ninterested and surprised at seeing a large black and scarlet Hemipterous\r\ninsect, many moths (Zygaena), and a Cicindela which are not found in\r\nShropshire. I almost made up my mind to begin collecting all the insects\r\nwhich I could find dead, for on consulting my sister I concluded that it\r\nwas not right to kill insects for the sake of making a collection. From\r\nreading White's 'Selborne,' I took much pleasure in watching the\r\nhabits of birds, and even made notes on the subject. In my simplicity I\r\nremember wondering why every gentleman did not become an ornithologist.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of my school life, my brother worked hard at\r\nchemistry, and made a fair laboratory with proper apparatus in the\r\ntool-house in the garden, and I was allowed to aid him as a servant in\r\nmost of his experiments. He made all the gases and many compounds, and\r\nI read with great care several books on chemistry, such as Henry and\r\nParkes' 'Chemical Catechism.' The subject interested me greatly, and we\r\noften used to go on working till rather late at night. This was the best\r\npart of my education at school, for it showed me practically the meaning\r\nof experimental science. The fact that we worked at chemistry somehow\r\ngot known at school, and as it was an unprecedented fact, I was\r\nnicknamed \"Gas.\" I was also once publicly rebuked by the head-master,\r\nDr. Butler, for thus wasting my time on such useless subjects; and he\r\ncalled me very unjustly a \"poco curante,\" and as I did not understand\r\nwhat he meant, it seemed to me a fearful reproach.\r\n\r\nAs I was doing no good at school, my father wisely took me away at a\r\nrather earlier age than usual, and sent me (Oct. 1825) to Edinburgh\r\nUniversity with my brother, where I stayed for two years or sessions. My\r\nbrother was completing his medical studies, though I do not believe he\r\never really intended to practise, and I was sent there to commence\r\nthem. But soon after this period I became convinced from various small\r\ncircumstances that my father would leave me property enough to subsist\r\non with some comfort, though I never imagined that I should be so rich a\r\nman as I am; but my belief was sufficient to check any strenuous efforts\r\nto learn medicine.\r\n\r\nThe instruction at Edinburgh was altogether by lectures, and these were\r\nintolerably dull, with the exception of those on chemistry by Hope; but\r\nto my mind there are no advantages and many disadvantages in lectures\r\ncompared with reading. Dr. Duncan's lectures on Materia Medica at 8\r\no'clock on a winter's morning are something fearful to remember. Dr.--\r\nmade his lectures on human anatomy as dull as he was himself, and the\r\nsubject disgusted me. It has proved one of the greatest evils in my life\r\nthat I was not urged to practise dissection, for I should soon have got\r\nover my disgust; and the practice would have been invaluable for all\r\nmy future work. This has been an irremediable evil, as well as my\r\nincapacity to draw. I also attended regularly the clinical wards in the\r\nhospital. Some of the cases distressed me a good deal, and I still have\r\nvivid pictures before me of some of them; but I was not so foolish as to\r\nallow this to lessen my attendance. I cannot understand why this part\r\nof my medical course did not interest me in a greater degree; for during\r\nthe summer before coming to Edinburgh I began attending some of the poor\r\npeople, chiefly children and women in Shrewsbury: I wrote down as full\r\nan account as I could of the case with all the symptoms, and read them\r\naloud to my father, who suggested further inquiries and advised me what\r\nmedicines to give, which I made up myself. At one time I had at least a\r\ndozen patients, and I felt a keen interest in the work. My father, who\r\nwas by far the best judge of character whom I ever knew, declared that\r\nI should make a successful physician,--meaning by this one who would\r\nget many patients. He maintained that the chief element of success was\r\nexciting confidence; but what he saw in me which convinced him that I\r\nshould create confidence I know not. I also attended on two occasions\r\nthe operating theatre in the hospital at Edinburgh, and saw two very\r\nbad operations, one on a child, but I rushed away before they were\r\ncompleted. Nor did I ever attend again, for hardly any inducement would\r\nhave been strong enough to make me do so; this being long before the\r\nblessed days of chloroform. The two cases fairly haunted me for many a\r\nlong year.\r\n\r\nMy brother stayed only one year at the University, so that during the\r\nsecond year I was left to my own resources; and this was an advantage,\r\nfor I became well acquainted with several young men fond of natural\r\nscience. One of these was Ainsworth, who afterwards published his\r\ntravels in Assyria; he was a Wernerian geologist, and knew a little\r\nabout many subjects. Dr. Coldstream was a very different young man,\r\nprim, formal, highly religious, and most kind-hearted; he afterwards\r\npublished some good zoological articles. A third young man was Hardie,\r\nwho would, I think, have made a good botanist, but died early in\r\nIndia. Lastly, Dr. Grant, my senior by several years, but how I became\r\nacquainted with him I cannot remember; he published some first-rate\r\nzoological papers, but after coming to London as Professor in University\r\nCollege, he did nothing more in science, a fact which has always been\r\ninexplicable to me. I knew him well; he was dry and formal in manner,\r\nwith much enthusiasm beneath this outer crust. He one day, when we were\r\nwalking together, burst forth in high admiration of Lamarck and his\r\nviews on evolution. I listened in silent astonishment, and as far as\r\nI can judge without any effect on my mind. I had previously read the\r\n'Zoonomia' of my grandfather, in which similar views are maintained, but\r\nwithout producing any effect on me. Nevertheless it is probable that the\r\nhearing rather early in life such views maintained and praised may\r\nhave favoured my upholding them under a different form in my 'Origin of\r\nSpecies.' At this time I admired greatly the 'Zoonomia;' but on reading\r\nit a second time after an interval of ten or fifteen years, I was much\r\ndisappointed; the proportion of speculation being so large to the facts\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nDrs. Grant and Coldstream attended much to marine Zoology, and I often\r\naccompanied the former to collect animals in the tidal pools, which I\r\ndissected as well as I could. I also became friends with some of the\r\nNewhaven fishermen, and sometimes accompanied them when they trawled\r\nfor oysters, and thus got many specimens. But from not having had any\r\nregular practice in dissection, and from possessing only a wretched\r\nmicroscope, my attempts were very poor. Nevertheless I made one\r\ninteresting little discovery, and read, about the beginning of the year\r\n1826, a short paper on the subject before the Plinian Society. This was\r\nthat the so-called ova of Flustra had the power of independent movement\r\nby means of cilia, and were in fact larvae. In another short paper I\r\nshowed that the little globular bodies which had been supposed to be\r\nthe young state of Fucus loreus were the egg-cases of the wormlike\r\nPontobdella muricata.\r\n\r\nThe Plinian Society was encouraged and, I believe, founded by Professor\r\nJameson: it consisted of students and met in an underground room in\r\nthe University for the sake of reading papers on natural science and\r\ndiscussing them. I used regularly to attend, and the meetings had a\r\ngood effect on me in stimulating my zeal and giving me new congenial\r\nacquaintances. One evening a poor young man got up, and after stammering\r\nfor a prodigious length of time, blushing crimson, he at last slowly\r\ngot out the words, \"Mr. President, I have forgotten what I was going to\r\nsay.\" The poor fellow looked quite overwhelmed, and all the members\r\nwere so surprised that no one could think of a word to say to cover his\r\nconfusion. The papers which were read to our little society were not\r\nprinted, so that I had not the satisfaction of seeing my paper in print;\r\nbut I believe Dr. Grant noticed my small discovery in his excellent\r\nmemoir on Flustra.\r\n\r\nI was also a member of the Royal Medical Society, and attended pretty\r\nregularly; but as the subjects were exclusively medical, I did not much\r\ncare about them. Much rubbish was talked there, but there were some good\r\nspeakers, of whom the best was the present Sir J. Kay-Shuttleworth. Dr.\r\nGrant took me occasionally to the meetings of the Wernerian Society,\r\nwhere various papers on natural history were read, discussed, and\r\nafterwards published in the 'Transactions.' I heard Audubon deliver\r\nthere some interesting discourses on the habits of N. American birds,\r\nsneering somewhat unjustly at Waterton. By the way, a negro lived in\r\nEdinburgh, who had travelled with Waterton, and gained his livelihood\r\nby stuffing birds, which he did excellently: he gave me lessons for\r\npayment, and I used often to sit with him, for he was a very pleasant\r\nand intelligent man.\r\n\r\nMr. Leonard Horner also took me once to a meeting of the Royal Society\r\nof Edinburgh, where I saw Sir Walter Scott in the chair as President,\r\nand he apologised to the meeting as not feeling fitted for such a\r\nposition. I looked at him and at the whole scene with some awe and\r\nreverence, and I think it was owing to this visit during my youth, and\r\nto my having attended the Royal Medical Society, that I felt the honour\r\nof being elected a few years ago an honorary member of both these\r\nSocieties, more than any other similar honour. If I had been told at\r\nthat time that I should one day have been thus honoured, I declare that\r\nI should have thought it as ridiculous and improbable, as if I had been\r\ntold that I should be elected King of England.\r\n\r\nDuring my second year at Edinburgh I attended --'s lectures on Geology\r\nand Zoology, but they were incredibly dull. The sole effect they\r\nproduced on me was the determination never as long as I lived to read\r\na book on Geology, or in any way to study the science. Yet I feel sure\r\nthat I was prepared for a philosophical treatment of the subject; for\r\nan old Mr. Cotton in Shropshire, who knew a good deal about rocks,\r\nhad pointed out to me two or three years previously a well-known large\r\nerratic boulder in the town of Shrewsbury, called the \"bell-stone\"; he\r\ntold me that there was no rock of the same kind nearer than Cumberland\r\nor Scotland, and he solemnly assured me that the world would come to an\r\nend before any one would be able to explain how this stone came where\r\nit now lay. This produced a deep impression on me, and I meditated over\r\nthis wonderful stone. So that I felt the keenest delight when I first\r\nread of the action of icebergs in transporting boulders, and I gloried\r\nin the progress of Geology. Equally striking is the fact that I, though\r\nnow only sixty-seven years old, heard the Professor, in a field lecture\r\nat Salisbury Craigs, discoursing on a trapdyke, with amygdaloidal\r\nmargins and the strata indurated on each side, with volcanic rocks all\r\naround us, say that it was a fissure filled with sediment from above,\r\nadding with a sneer that there were men who maintained that it had\r\nbeen injected from beneath in a molten condition. When I think of this\r\nlecture, I do not wonder that I determined never to attend to Geology.\r\n\r\nFrom attending --'s lectures, I became acquainted with the curator\r\nof the museum, Mr. Macgillivray, who afterwards published a large\r\nand excellent book on the birds of Scotland. I had much interesting\r\nnatural-history talk with him, and he was very kind to me. He gave me\r\nsome rare shells, for I at that time collected marine mollusca, but with\r\nno great zeal.\r\n\r\nMy summer vacations during these two years were wholly given up to\r\namusements, though I always had some book in hand, which I read with\r\ninterest. During the summer of 1826 I took a long walking tour with\r\ntwo friends with knapsacks on our backs through North wales. We walked\r\nthirty miles most days, including one day the ascent of Snowdon. I\r\nalso went with my sister a riding tour in North Wales, a servant with\r\nsaddle-bags carrying our clothes. The autumns were devoted to shooting\r\nchiefly at Mr. Owen's, at Woodhouse, and at my Uncle Jos's (Josiah\r\nWedgwood, the son of the founder of the Etruria Works.) at Maer. My zeal\r\nwas so great that I used to place my shooting-boots open by my bed-side\r\nwhen I went to bed, so as not to lose half a minute in putting them on\r\nin the morning; and on one occasion I reached a distant part of the Maer\r\nestate, on the 20th of August for black-game shooting, before I could\r\nsee: I then toiled on with the game-keeper the whole day through thick\r\nheath and young Scotch firs.\r\n\r\nI kept an exact record of every bird which I shot throughout the whole\r\nseason. One day when shooting at Woodhouse with Captain Owen, the eldest\r\nson, and Major Hill, his cousin, afterwards Lord Berwick, both of whom I\r\nliked very much, I thought myself shamefully used, for every time after\r\nI had fired and thought that I had killed a bird, one of the two acted\r\nas if loading his gun, and cried out, \"You must not count that bird,\r\nfor I fired at the same time,\" and the gamekeeper, perceiving the joke,\r\nbacked them up. After some hours they told me the joke, but it was no\r\njoke to me, for I had shot a large number of birds, but did not know how\r\nmany, and could not add them to my list, which I used to do by making a\r\nknot in a piece of string tied to a button-hole. This my wicked friends\r\nhad perceived.\r\n\r\nHow I did enjoy shooting! But I think that I must have been\r\nhalf-consciously ashamed of my zeal, for I tried to persuade myself\r\nthat shooting was almost an intellectual employment; it required so much\r\nskill to judge where to find most game and to hunt the dogs well.\r\n\r\nOne of my autumnal visits to Maer in 1827 was memorable from meeting\r\nthere Sir J. Mackintosh, who was the best converser I ever listened\r\nto. I heard afterwards with a glow of pride that he had said, \"There\r\nis something in that young man that interests me.\" This must have been\r\nchiefly due to his perceiving that I listened with much interest to\r\neverything which he said, for I was as ignorant as a pig about his\r\nsubjects of history, politics, and moral philosophy. To hear of praise\r\nfrom an eminent person, though no doubt apt or certain to excite vanity,\r\nis, I think, good for a young man, as it helps to keep him in the right\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nMy visits to Maer during these two or three succeeding years were quite\r\ndelightful, independently of the autumnal shooting. Life there was\r\nperfectly free; the country was very pleasant for walking or riding;\r\nand in the evening there was much very agreeable conversation, not\r\nso personal as it generally is in large family parties, together with\r\nmusic. In the summer the whole family used often to sit on the steps\r\nof the old portico, with the flower-garden in front, and with the steep\r\nwooded bank opposite the house reflected in the lake, with here and\r\nthere a fish rising or a water-bird paddling about. Nothing has left a\r\nmore vivid picture on my mind than these evenings at Maer. I was\r\nalso attached to and greatly revered my Uncle Jos; he was silent and\r\nreserved, so as to be a rather awful man; but he sometimes talked openly\r\nwith me. He was the very type of an upright man, with the clearest\r\njudgment. I do not believe that any power on earth could have made him\r\nswerve an inch from what he considered the right course. I used to apply\r\nto him in my mind the well-known ode of Horace, now forgotten by me, in\r\nwhich the words \"nec vultus tyranni, etc.,\" come in. (Justum et tenacem\r\npropositi virum Non civium ardor prava jubentium Non vultus instantis\r\ntyranni Mente quatit solida.)\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE 1828-1831.\r\n\r\nAfter having spent two sessions in Edinburgh, my father perceived, or\r\nhe heard from my sisters, that I did not like the thought of being a\r\nphysician, so he proposed that I should become a clergyman. He was very\r\nproperly vehement against my turning into an idle sporting man, which\r\nthen seemed my probable destination. I asked for some time to consider,\r\nas from what little I had heard or thought on the subject I had scruples\r\nabout declaring my belief in all the dogmas of the Church of England;\r\nthough otherwise I liked the thought of being a country clergyman.\r\nAccordingly I read with care 'Pearson on the Creed,' and a few other\r\nbooks on divinity; and as I did not then in the least doubt the strict\r\nand literal truth of every word in the Bible, I soon persuaded myself\r\nthat our Creed must be fully accepted.\r\n\r\nConsidering how fiercely I have been attacked by the orthodox, it seems\r\nludicrous that I once intended to be a clergyman. Nor was this intention\r\nand my father's wish ever formerly given up, but died a natural death\r\nwhen, on leaving Cambridge, I joined the \"Beagle\" as naturalist. If the\r\nphrenologists are to be trusted, I was well fitted in one respect to be\r\na clergyman. A few years ago the secretaries of a German psychological\r\nsociety asked me earnestly by letter for a photograph of myself; and\r\nsome time afterwards I received the proceedings of one of the meetings,\r\nin which it seemed that the shape of my head had been the subject of a\r\npublic discussion, and one of the speakers declared that I had the bump\r\nof reverence developed enough for ten priests.\r\n\r\nAs it was decided that I should be a clergyman, it was necessary that I\r\nshould go to one of the English universities and take a degree; but as\r\nI had never opened a classical book since leaving school, I found to\r\nmy dismay, that in the two intervening years I had actually forgotten,\r\nincredible as it may appear, almost everything which I had learnt,\r\neven to some few of the Greek letters. I did not therefore proceed to\r\nCambridge at the usual time in October, but worked with a private tutor\r\nin Shrewsbury, and went to Cambridge after the Christmas vacation, early\r\nin 1828. I soon recovered my school standard of knowledge, and could\r\ntranslate easy Greek books, such as Homer and the Greek Testament, with\r\nmoderate facility.\r\n\r\nDuring the three years which I spent at Cambridge my time was wasted,\r\nas far as the academical studies were concerned, as completely as at\r\nEdinburgh and at school. I attempted mathematics, and even went during\r\nthe summer of 1828 with a private tutor (a very dull man) to Barmouth,\r\nbut I got on very slowly. The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my\r\nnot being able to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This\r\nimpatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted\r\nthat I did not proceed far enough at least to understand something of\r\nthe great leading principles of mathematics, for men thus endowed seem\r\nto have an extra sense. But I do not believe that I should ever have\r\nsucceeded beyond a very low grade. With respect to Classics I did\r\nnothing except attend a few compulsory college lectures, and the\r\nattendance was almost nominal. In my second year I had to work for a\r\nmonth or two to pass the Little-Go, which I did easily. Again, in my\r\nlast year I worked with some earnestness for my final degree of B.A.,\r\nand brushed up my Classics, together with a little Algebra and Euclid,\r\nwhich latter gave me much pleasure, as it did at school. In order to\r\npass the B.A. examination, it was also necessary to get up Paley's\r\n'Evidences of Christianity,' and his 'Moral Philosophy.' This was done\r\nin a thorough manner, and I am convinced that I could have written out\r\nthe whole of the 'Evidences' with perfect correctness, but not of course\r\nin the clear language of Paley. The logic of this book and, as I may\r\nadd, of his 'Natural Theology,' gave me as much delight as did Euclid.\r\nThe careful study of these works, without attempting to learn any part\r\nby rote, was the only part of the academical course which, as I then\r\nfelt and as I still believe, was of the least use to me in the education\r\nof my mind. I did not at that time trouble myself about Paley's\r\npremises; and taking these on trust, I was charmed and convinced by the\r\nlong line of argumentation. By answering well the examination questions\r\nin Paley, by doing Euclid well, and by not failing miserably in\r\nClassics, I gained a good place among the oi polloi or crowd of men who\r\ndo not go in for honours. Oddly enough, I cannot remember how high I\r\nstood, and my memory fluctuates between the fifth, tenth, or twelfth,\r\nname on the list. (Tenth in the list of January 1831.)\r\n\r\nPublic lectures on several branches were given in the University,\r\nattendance being quite voluntary; but I was so sickened with lectures at\r\nEdinburgh that I did not even attend Sedgwick's eloquent and interesting\r\nlectures. Had I done so I should probably have become a geologist\r\nearlier than I did. I attended, however, Henslow's lectures on Botany,\r\nand liked them much for their extreme clearness, and the admirable\r\nillustrations; but I did not study botany. Henslow used to take his\r\npupils, including several of the older members of the University, field\r\nexcursions, on foot or in coaches, to distant places, or in a barge\r\ndown the river, and lectured on the rarer plants and animals which were\r\nobserved. These excursions were delightful.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as we shall presently see, there were some redeeming features\r\nin my life at Cambridge, my time was sadly wasted there, and worse than\r\nwasted. From my passion for shooting and for hunting, and, when this\r\nfailed, for riding across country, I got into a sporting set, including\r\nsome dissipated low-minded young men. We used often to dine together in\r\nthe evening, though these dinners often included men of a higher stamp,\r\nand we sometimes drank too much, with jolly singing and playing at cards\r\nafterwards. I know that I ought to feel ashamed of days and evenings\r\nthus spent, but as some of my friends were very pleasant, and we were\r\nall in the highest spirits, I cannot help looking back to these times\r\nwith much pleasure.\r\n\r\nBut I am glad to think that I had many other friends of a widely\r\ndifferent nature. I was very intimate with Whitley (Rev. C. Whitley,\r\nHon. Canon of Durham, formerly Reader in Natural Philosophy in\r\nDurham University.), who was afterwards Senior Wrangler, and we used\r\ncontinually to take long walks together. He inoculated me with a taste\r\nfor pictures and good engravings, of which I bought some. I frequently\r\nwent to the Fitzwilliam Gallery, and my taste must have been fairly\r\ngood, for I certainly admired the best pictures, which I discussed with\r\nthe old curator. I read also with much interest Sir Joshua Reynolds'\r\nbook. This taste, though not natural to me, lasted for several years,\r\nand many of the pictures in the National Gallery in London gave me\r\nmuch pleasure; that of Sebastian del Piombo exciting in me a sense of\r\nsublimity.\r\n\r\nI also got into a musical set, I believe by means of my warm-hearted\r\nfriend, Herbert (The late John Maurice Herbert, County Court Judge of\r\nCardiff and the Monmouth Circuit.), who took a high wrangler's degree.\r\nFrom associating with these men, and hearing them play, I acquired a\r\nstrong taste for music, and used very often to time my walks so as to\r\nhear on week days the anthem in King's College Chapel. This gave me\r\nintense pleasure, so that my backbone would sometimes shiver. I am sure\r\nthat there was no affectation or mere imitation in this taste, for I\r\nused generally to go by myself to King's College, and I sometimes hired\r\nthe chorister boys to sing in my rooms. Nevertheless I am so utterly\r\ndestitute of an ear, that I cannot perceive a discord, or keep time\r\nand hum a tune correctly; and it is a mystery how I could possibly have\r\nderived pleasure from music.\r\n\r\nMy musical friends soon perceived my state, and sometimes amused\r\nthemselves by making me pass an examination, which consisted in\r\nascertaining how many tunes I could recognise when they were played\r\nrather more quickly or slowly than usual. 'God save the King,' when thus\r\nplayed, was a sore puzzle. There was another man with almost as bad an\r\near as I had, and strange to say he played a little on the flute. Once I\r\nhad the triumph of beating him in one of our musical examinations.\r\n\r\nBut no pursuit at Cambridge was followed with nearly so much eagerness\r\nor gave me so much pleasure as collecting beetles. It was the mere\r\npassion for collecting, for I did not dissect them, and rarely compared\r\ntheir external characters with published descriptions, but got them\r\nnamed anyhow. I will give a proof of my zeal: one day, on tearing off\r\nsome old bark, I saw two rare beetles, and seized one in each hand; then\r\nI saw a third and new kind, which I could not bear to lose, so that I\r\npopped the one which I held in my right hand into my mouth. Alas! it\r\nejected some intensely acrid fluid, which burnt my tongue so that I was\r\nforced to spit the beetle out, which was lost, as was the third one.\r\n\r\nI was very successful in collecting, and invented two new methods; I\r\nemployed a labourer to scrape during the winter, moss off old trees\r\nand place it in a large bag, and likewise to collect the rubbish at the\r\nbottom of the barges in which reeds are brought from the fens, and thus\r\nI got some very rare species. No poet ever felt more delighted at\r\nseeing his first poem published than I did at seeing, in Stephens'\r\n'Illustrations of British Insects,' the magic words, \"captured by C.\r\nDarwin, Esq.\" I was introduced to entomology by my second cousin W.\r\nDarwin Fox, a clever and most pleasant man, who was then at Christ's\r\nCollege, and with whom I became extremely intimate. Afterwards I became\r\nwell acquainted, and went out collecting, with Albert Way of Trinity,\r\nwho in after years became a well-known archaeologist; also with H.\r\nThompson of the same College, afterwards a leading agriculturist,\r\nchairman of a great railway, and Member of Parliament. It seems\r\ntherefore that a taste for collecting beetles is some indication of\r\nfuture success in life!\r\n\r\nI am surprised what an indelible impression many of the beetles which\r\nI caught at Cambridge have left on my mind. I can remember the exact\r\nappearance of certain posts, old trees and banks where I made a good\r\ncapture. The pretty Panagaeus crux-major was a treasure in those days,\r\nand here at Down I saw a beetle running across a walk, and on picking it\r\nup instantly perceived that it differed slightly from P. crux-major,\r\nand it turned out to be P. quadripunctatus, which is only a variety or\r\nclosely allied species, differing from it very slightly in outline. I\r\nhad never seen in those old days Licinus alive, which to an uneducated\r\neye hardly differs from many of the black Carabidous beetles; but my\r\nsons found here a specimen, and I instantly recognised that it was new\r\nto me; yet I had not looked at a British beetle for the last twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nI have not as yet mentioned a circumstance which influenced my whole\r\ncareer more than any other. This was my friendship with Professor\r\nHenslow. Before coming up to Cambridge, I had heard of him from my\r\nbrother as a man who knew every branch of science, and I was accordingly\r\nprepared to reverence him. He kept open house once every week when\r\nall undergraduates, and some older members of the University, who were\r\nattached to science, used to meet in the evening. I soon got, through\r\nFox, an invitation, and went there regularly. Before long I became\r\nwell acquainted with Henslow, and during the latter half of my time at\r\nCambridge took long walks with him on most days; so that I was called by\r\nsome of the dons \"the man who walks with Henslow;\" and in the evening I\r\nwas very often asked to join his family dinner. His knowledge was great\r\nin botany, entomology, chemistry, mineralogy, and geology. His strongest\r\ntaste was to draw conclusions from long-continued minute observations.\r\nHis judgment was excellent, and his whole mind well balanced; but I\r\ndo not suppose that any one would say that he possessed much original\r\ngenius. He was deeply religious, and so orthodox that he told me one day\r\nhe should be grieved if a single word of the Thirty-nine Articles were\r\naltered. His moral qualities were in every way admirable. He was free\r\nfrom every tinge of vanity or other petty feeling; and I never saw a man\r\nwho thought so little about himself or his own concerns. His temper was\r\nimperturbably good, with the most winning and courteous manners; yet,\r\nas I have seen, he could be roused by any bad action to the warmest\r\nindignation and prompt action.\r\n\r\nI once saw in his company in the streets of Cambridge almost as horrid\r\na scene as could have been witnessed during the French Revolution. Two\r\nbody-snatchers had been arrested, and whilst being taken to prison had\r\nbeen torn from the constable by a crowd of the roughest men, who dragged\r\nthem by their legs along the muddy and stony road. They were covered\r\nfrom head to foot with mud, and their faces were bleeding either from\r\nhaving been kicked or from the stones; they looked like corpses, but\r\nthe crowd was so dense that I got only a few momentary glimpses of the\r\nwretched creatures. Never in my life have I seen such wrath painted on\r\na man's face as was shown by Henslow at this horrid scene. He tried\r\nrepeatedly to penetrate the mob; but it was simply impossible. He then\r\nrushed away to the mayor, telling me not to follow him, but to get more\r\npolicemen. I forget the issue, except that the two men were got into the\r\nprison without being killed.\r\n\r\nHenslow's benevolence was unbounded, as he proved by his many excellent\r\nschemes for his poor parishioners, when in after years he held the\r\nliving of Hitcham. My intimacy with such a man ought to have been, and I\r\nhope was, an inestimable benefit. I cannot resist mentioning a trifling\r\nincident, which showed his kind consideration. Whilst examining some\r\npollen-grains on a damp surface, I saw the tubes exserted, and instantly\r\nrushed off to communicate my surprising discovery to him. Now I do not\r\nsuppose any other professor of botany could have helped laughing at my\r\ncoming in such a hurry to make such a communication. But he agreed how\r\ninteresting the phenomenon was, and explained its meaning, but made me\r\nclearly understand how well it was known; so I left him not in the\r\nleast mortified, but well pleased at having discovered for myself so\r\nremarkable a fact, but determined not to be in such a hurry again to\r\ncommunicate my discoveries.\r\n\r\nDr. Whewell was one of the older and distinguished men who sometimes\r\nvisited Henslow, and on several occasions I walked home with him at\r\nnight. Next to Sir J. Mackintosh he was the best converser on grave\r\nsubjects to whom I ever listened. Leonard Jenyns (The well-known Soame\r\nJenyns was cousin to Mr. Jenyns' father.), who afterwards published some\r\ngood essays in Natural History (Mr. Jenyns (now Blomefield) described\r\nthe fish for the Zoology of the \"Beagle\"; and is author of a long series\r\nof papers, chiefly Zoological.), often stayed with Henslow, who was his\r\nbrother-in-law. I visited him at his parsonage on the borders of the\r\nFens [Swaffham Bulbeck], and had many a good walk and talk with him\r\nabout Natural History. I became also acquainted with several other men\r\nolder than me, who did not care much about science, but were friends of\r\nHenslow. One was a Scotchman, brother of Sir Alexander Ramsay, and tutor\r\nof Jesus College: he was a delightful man, but did not live for many\r\nyears. Another was Mr. Dawes, afterwards Dean of Hereford, and famous\r\nfor his success in the education of the poor. These men and others of\r\nthe same standing, together with Henslow, used sometimes to take distant\r\nexcursions into the country, which I was allowed to join, and they were\r\nmost agreeable.\r\n\r\nLooking back, I infer that there must have been something in me a little\r\nsuperior to the common run of youths, otherwise the above-mentioned men,\r\nso much older than me and higher in academical position, would never\r\nhave allowed me to associate with them. Certainly I was not aware of any\r\nsuch superiority, and I remember one of my sporting friends, Turner,\r\nwho saw me at work with my beetles, saying that I should some day be a\r\nFellow of the Royal Society, and the notion seemed to me preposterous.\r\n\r\nDuring my last year at Cambridge, I read with care and profound interest\r\nHumboldt's 'Personal Narrative.' This work, and Sir J. Herschel's\r\n'Introduction to the Study of Natural Philosophy,' stirred up in me\r\na burning zeal to add even the most humble contribution to the noble\r\nstructure of Natural Science. No one or a dozen other books influenced\r\nme nearly so much as these two. I copied out from Humboldt long passages\r\nabout Teneriffe, and read them aloud on one of the above-mentioned\r\nexcursions, to (I think) Henslow, Ramsay, and Dawes, for on a previous\r\noccasion I had talked about the glories of Teneriffe, and some of the\r\nparty declared they would endeavour to go there; but I think that they\r\nwere only half in earnest. I was, however, quite in earnest, and got\r\nan introduction to a merchant in London to enquire about ships; but\r\nthe scheme was, of course, knocked on the head by the voyage of the\r\n\"Beagle\".\r\n\r\nMy summer vacations were given up to collecting beetles, to some\r\nreading, and short tours. In the autumn my whole time was devoted to\r\nshooting, chiefly at Woodhouse and Maer, and sometimes with young Eyton\r\nof Eyton. Upon the whole the three years which I spent at Cambridge were\r\nthe most joyful in my happy life; for I was then in excellent health,\r\nand almost always in high spirits.\r\n\r\nAs I had at first come up to Cambridge at Christmas, I was forced to\r\nkeep two terms after passing my final examination, at the commencement\r\nof 1831; and Henslow then persuaded me to begin the study of geology.\r\nTherefore on my return to Shropshire I examined sections, and coloured\r\na map of parts round Shrewsbury. Professor Sedgwick intended to visit\r\nNorth Wales in the beginning of August to pursue his famous geological\r\ninvestigations amongst the older rocks, and Henslow asked him to allow\r\nme to accompany him. (In connection with this tour my father used\r\nto tell a story about Sedgwick: they had started from their inn one\r\nmorning, and had walked a mile or two, when Sedgwick suddenly stopped,\r\nand vowed that he would return, being certain \"that damned scoundrel\"\r\n(the waiter) had not given the chambermaid the sixpence intrusted to\r\nhim for the purpose. He was ultimately persuaded to give up the project,\r\nseeing that there was no reason for suspecting the waiter of especial\r\nperfidy.--F.D.) Accordingly he came and slept at my father's house.\r\n\r\nA short conversation with him during this evening produced a strong\r\nimpression on my mind. Whilst examining an old gravel-pit near\r\nShrewsbury, a labourer told me that he had found in it a large worn\r\ntropical Volute shell, such as may be seen on the chimney-pieces of\r\ncottages; and as he would not sell the shell, I was convinced that he\r\nhad really found it in the pit. I told Sedgwick of the fact, and he at\r\nonce said (no doubt truly) that it must have been thrown away by some\r\none into the pit; but then added, if really embedded there it would be\r\nthe greatest misfortune to geology, as it would overthrow all that\r\nwe know about the superficial deposits of the Midland Counties. These\r\ngravel-beds belong in fact to the glacial period, and in after years I\r\nfound in them broken arctic shells. But I was then utterly astonished at\r\nSedgwick not being delighted at so wonderful a fact as a tropical shell\r\nbeing found near the surface in the middle of England. Nothing\r\nbefore had ever made me thoroughly realise, though I had read various\r\nscientific books, that science consists in grouping facts so that\r\ngeneral laws or conclusions may be drawn from them.\r\n\r\nNext morning we started for Llangollen, Conway, Bangor, and Capel Curig.\r\nThis tour was of decided use in teaching me a little how to make out the\r\ngeology of a country. Sedgwick often sent me on a line parallel to\r\nhis, telling me to bring back specimens of the rocks and to mark the\r\nstratification on a map. I have little doubt that he did this for my\r\ngood, as I was too ignorant to have aided him. On this tour I had a\r\nstriking instance of how easy it is to overlook phenomena, however\r\nconspicuous, before they have been observed by any one. We spent many\r\nhours in Cwm Idwal, examining all the rocks with extreme care, as\r\nSedgwick was anxious to find fossils in them; but neither of us saw\r\na trace of the wonderful glacial phenomena all around us; we did not\r\nnotice the plainly scored rocks, the perched boulders, the lateral and\r\nterminal moraines. Yet these phenomena are so conspicuous that, as\r\nI declared in a paper published many years afterwards in the\r\n'Philosophical Magazine' ('Philosophical Magazine,' 1842.), a house\r\nburnt down by fire did not tell its story more plainly than did this\r\nvalley. If it had still been filled by a glacier, the phenomena would\r\nhave been less distinct than they now are.\r\n\r\nAt Capel Curig I left Sedgwick and went in a straight line by compass\r\nand map across the mountains to Barmouth, never following any track\r\nunless it coincided with my course. I thus came on some strange wild\r\nplaces, and enjoyed much this manner of travelling. I visited Barmouth\r\nto see some Cambridge friends who were reading there, and thence\r\nreturned to Shrewsbury and to Maer for shooting; for at that time\r\nI should have thought myself mad to give up the first days of\r\npartridge-shooting for geology or any other science.\r\n\r\n\"VOYAGE OF THE 'BEAGLE' FROM DECEMBER 27, 1831, TO OCTOBER 2, 1836.\"\r\n\r\nOn returning home from my short geological tour in North Wales, I found\r\na letter from Henslow, informing me that Captain Fitz-Roy was willing to\r\ngive up part of his own cabin to any young man who would volunteer to go\r\nwith him without pay as naturalist to the Voyage of the \"Beagle\". I\r\nhave given, as I believe, in my MS. Journal an account of all the\r\ncircumstances which then occurred; I will here only say that I was\r\ninstantly eager to accept the offer, but my father strongly objected,\r\nadding the words, fortunate for me, \"If you can find any man of common\r\nsense who advises you to go I will give my consent.\" So I wrote that\r\nevening and refused the offer. On the next morning I went to Maer to\r\nbe ready for September 1st, and, whilst out shooting, my uncle (Josiah\r\nWedgwood.) sent for me, offering to drive me over to Shrewsbury and talk\r\nwith my father, as my uncle thought it would be wise in me to accept the\r\noffer. My father always maintained that he was one of the most sensible\r\nmen in the world, and he at once consented in the kindest manner. I had\r\nbeen rather extravagant at Cambridge, and to console my father, said,\r\n\"that I should be deuced clever to spend more than my allowance whilst\r\non board the 'Beagle';\" but he answered with a smile, \"But they tell me\r\nyou are very clever.\"\r\n\r\nNext day I started for Cambridge to see Henslow, and thence to London\r\nto see Fitz-Roy, and all was soon arranged. Afterwards, on becoming very\r\nintimate with Fitz-Roy, I heard that I had run a very narrow risk of\r\nbeing rejected, on account of the shape of my nose! He was an ardent\r\ndisciple of Lavater, and was convinced that he could judge of a man's\r\ncharacter by the outline of his features; and he doubted whether any one\r\nwith my nose could possess sufficient energy and determination for the\r\nvoyage. But I think he was afterwards well satisfied that my nose had\r\nspoken falsely.\r\n\r\nFitz-Roy's character was a singular one, with very many noble features:\r\nhe was devoted to his duty, generous to a fault, bold, determined, and\r\nindomitably energetic, and an ardent friend to all under his sway. He\r\nwould undertake any sort of trouble to assist those whom he thought\r\ndeserved assistance. He was a handsome man, strikingly like a gentleman,\r\nwith highly courteous manners, which resembled those of his maternal\r\nuncle, the famous Lord Castlereagh, as I was told by the Minister at\r\nRio. Nevertheless he must have inherited much in his appearance from\r\nCharles II., for Dr. Wallich gave me a collection of photographs which\r\nhe had made, and I was struck with the resemblance of one to Fitz-Roy;\r\nand on looking at the name, I found it Ch. E. Sobieski Stuart, Count\r\nd'Albanie, a descendant of the same monarch.\r\n\r\nFitz-Roy's temper was a most unfortunate one. It was usually worst in\r\nthe early morning, and with his eagle eye he could generally detect\r\nsomething amiss about the ship, and was then unsparing in his blame. He\r\nwas very kind to me, but was a man very difficult to live with on the\r\nintimate terms which necessarily followed from our messing by ourselves\r\nin the same cabin. We had several quarrels; for instance, early in the\r\nvoyage at Bahia, in Brazil, he defended and praised slavery, which I\r\nabominated, and told me that he had just visited a great slave-owner,\r\nwho had called up many of his slaves and asked them whether they were\r\nhappy, and whether they wished to be free, and all answered \"No.\" I then\r\nasked him, perhaps with a sneer, whether he thought that the answer of\r\nslaves in the presence of their master was worth anything? This made him\r\nexcessively angry, and he said that as I doubted his word we could not\r\nlive any longer together. I thought that I should have been compelled to\r\nleave the ship; but as soon as the news spread, which it did quickly,\r\nas the captain sent for the first lieutenant to assuage his anger by\r\nabusing me, I was deeply gratified by receiving an invitation from all\r\nthe gun-room officers to mess with them. But after a few hours Fitz-Roy\r\nshowed his usual magnanimity by sending an officer to me with an apology\r\nand a request that I would continue to live with him.\r\n\r\nHis character was in several respects one of the most noble which I have\r\never known.\r\n\r\nThe voyage of the \"Beagle\" has been by far the most important event in\r\nmy life, and has determined my whole career; yet it depended on so\r\nsmall a circumstance as my uncle offering to drive me thirty miles to\r\nShrewsbury, which few uncles would have done, and on such a trifle as\r\nthe shape of my nose. I have always felt that I owe to the voyage the\r\nfirst real training or education of my mind; I was led to attend\r\nclosely to several branches of natural history, and thus my powers of\r\nobservation were improved, though they were always fairly developed.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the geology of all the places visited was far more\r\nimportant, as reasoning here comes into play. On first examining a new\r\ndistrict nothing can appear more hopeless than the chaos of rocks; but\r\nby recording the stratification and nature of the rocks and fossils\r\nat many points, always reasoning and predicting what will be found\r\nelsewhere, light soon begins to dawn on the district, and the structure\r\nof the whole becomes more or less intelligible. I had brought with me\r\nthe first volume of Lyell's 'Principles of Geology,' which I studied\r\nattentively; and the book was of the highest service to me in many ways.\r\nThe very first place which I examined, namely St. Jago in the Cape de\r\nVerde islands, showed me clearly the wonderful superiority of Lyell's\r\nmanner of treating geology, compared with that of any other author,\r\nwhose works I had with me or ever afterwards read.\r\n\r\nAnother of my occupations was collecting animals of all classes, briefly\r\ndescribing and roughly dissecting many of the marine ones; but from not\r\nbeing able to draw, and from not having sufficient anatomical knowledge,\r\na great pile of MS. which I made during the voyage has proved almost\r\nuseless. I thus lost much time, with the exception of that spent in\r\nacquiring some knowledge of the Crustaceans, as this was of service when\r\nin after years I undertook a monograph of the Cirripedia.\r\n\r\nDuring some part of the day I wrote my Journal, and took much pains in\r\ndescribing carefully and vividly all that I had seen; and this was good\r\npractice. My Journal served also, in part, as letters to my home, and\r\nportions were sent to England whenever there was an opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe above various special studies were, however, of no importance\r\ncompared with the habit of energetic industry and of concentrated\r\nattention to whatever I was engaged in, which I then acquired.\r\nEverything about which I thought or read was made to bear directly\r\non what I had seen or was likely to see; and this habit of mind was\r\ncontinued during the five years of the voyage. I feel sure that it\r\nwas this training which has enabled me to do whatever I have done in\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nLooking backwards, I can now perceive how my love for science gradually\r\npreponderated over every other taste. During the first two years my old\r\npassion for shooting survived in nearly full force, and I shot myself\r\nall the birds and animals for my collection; but gradually I gave up my\r\ngun more and more, and finally altogether, to my servant, as shooting\r\ninterfered with my work, more especially with making out the geological\r\nstructure of a country. I discovered, though unconsciously and\r\ninsensibly, that the pleasure of observing and reasoning was a much\r\nhigher one than that of skill and sport. That my mind became developed\r\nthrough my pursuits during the voyage is rendered probable by a remark\r\nmade by my father, who was the most acute observer whom I ever saw, of a\r\nsceptical disposition, and far from being a believer in phrenology; for\r\non first seeing me after the voyage, he turned round to my sisters, and\r\nexclaimed, \"Why, the shape of his head is quite altered.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to the voyage. On September 11th (1831), I paid a flying visit\r\nwith Fitz-Roy to the \"Beagle\" at Plymouth. Thence to Shrewsbury to wish\r\nmy father and sisters a long farewell. On October 24th I took up my\r\nresidence at Plymouth, and remained there until December 27th, when the\r\n\"Beagle\" finally left the shores of England for her circumnavigation of\r\nthe world. We made two earlier attempts to sail, but were driven back\r\neach time by heavy gales. These two months at Plymouth were the most\r\nmiserable which I ever spent, though I exerted myself in various ways.\r\nI was out of spirits at the thought of leaving all my family and friends\r\nfor so long a time, and the weather seemed to me inexpressibly gloomy.\r\nI was also troubled with palpitation and pain about the heart, and like\r\nmany a young ignorant man, especially one with a smattering of medical\r\nknowledge, was convinced that I had heart disease. I did not consult any\r\ndoctor, as I fully expected to hear the verdict that I was not fit for\r\nthe voyage, and I was resolved to go at all hazards.\r\n\r\nI need not here refer to the events of the voyage--where we went and\r\nwhat we did--as I have given a sufficiently full account in my published\r\nJournal. The glories of the vegetation of the Tropics rise before my\r\nmind at the present time more vividly than anything else; though\r\nthe sense of sublimity, which the great deserts of Patagonia and the\r\nforest-clad mountains of Tierra del Fuego excited in me, has left an\r\nindelible impression on my mind. The sight of a naked savage in his\r\nnative land is an event which can never be forgotten. Many of my\r\nexcursions on horseback through wild countries, or in the boats, some\r\nof which lasted several weeks, were deeply interesting: their discomfort\r\nand some degree of danger were at that time hardly a drawback, and none\r\nat all afterwards. I also reflect with high satisfaction on some of\r\nmy scientific work, such as solving the problem of coral islands, and\r\nmaking out the geological structure of certain islands, for instance,\r\nSt. Helena. Nor must I pass over the discovery of the singular relations\r\nof the animals and plants inhabiting the several islands of the\r\nGalapagos archipelago, and of all of them to the inhabitants of South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can judge of myself, I worked to the utmost during the\r\nvoyage from the mere pleasure of investigation, and from my strong\r\ndesire to add a few facts to the great mass of facts in Natural\r\nScience. But I was also ambitious to take a fair place among scientific\r\nmen,--whether more ambitious or less so than most of my fellow-workers,\r\nI can form no opinion.\r\n\r\nThe geology of St. Jago is very striking, yet simple: a stream of lava\r\nformerly flowed over the bed of the sea, formed of triturated recent\r\nshells and corals, which it has baked into a hard white rock. Since then\r\nthe whole island has been upheaved. But the line of white rock revealed\r\nto me a new and important fact, namely, that there had been afterwards\r\nsubsidence round the craters, which had since been in action, and had\r\npoured forth lava. It then first dawned on me that I might perhaps write\r\na book on the geology of the various countries visited, and this made me\r\nthrill with delight. That was a memorable hour to me, and how distinctly\r\nI can call to mind the low cliff of lava beneath which I rested, with\r\nthe sun glaring hot, a few strange desert plants growing near, and\r\nwith living corals in the tidal pools at my feet. Later in the voyage,\r\nFitz-Roy asked me to read some of my Journal, and declared it would be\r\nworth publishing; so here was a second book in prospect!\r\n\r\nTowards the close of our voyage I received a letter whilst at Ascension,\r\nin which my sisters told me that Sedgwick had called on my father, and\r\nsaid that I should take a place among the leading scientific men. I\r\ncould not at the time understand how he could have learnt anything of\r\nmy proceedings, but I heard (I believe afterwards) that Henslow had\r\nread some of the letters which I wrote to him before the Philosophical\r\nSociety of Cambridge (Read at the meeting held November 16, 1835, and\r\nprinted in a pamphlet of 31 pages for distribution among the members\r\nof the Society.), and had printed them for private distribution. My\r\ncollection of fossil bones, which had been sent to Henslow, also excited\r\nconsiderable attention amongst palaeontologists. After reading this\r\nletter, I clambered over the mountains of Ascension with a bounding\r\nstep, and made the volcanic rocks resound under my geological hammer.\r\nAll this shows how ambitious I was; but I think that I can say with\r\ntruth that in after years, though I cared in the highest degree for the\r\napprobation of such men as Lyell and Hooker, who were my friends, I\r\ndid not care much about the general public. I do not mean to say that a\r\nfavourable review or a large sale of my books did not please me greatly,\r\nbut the pleasure was a fleeting one, and I am sure that I have never\r\nturned one inch out of my course to gain fame.\r\n\r\nFROM MY RETURN TO ENGLAND (OCTOBER 2, 1836) TO MY MARRIAGE (JANUARY 29,\r\n1839.)\r\n\r\nThese two years and three months were the most active ones which I ever\r\nspent, though I was occasionally unwell, and so lost some time. After\r\ngoing backwards and forwards several times between Shrewsbury,\r\nMaer, Cambridge, and London, I settled in lodgings at Cambridge (In\r\nFitzwilliam Street.) on December 13th, where all my collections were\r\nunder the care of Henslow. I stayed here three months, and got my\r\nminerals and rocks examined by the aid of Professor Miller.\r\n\r\nI began preparing my 'Journal of Travels,' which was not hard work,\r\nas my MS. Journal had been written with care, and my chief labour was\r\nmaking an abstract of my more interesting scientific results. I sent\r\nalso, at the request of Lyell, a short account of my observations on\r\nthe elevation of the coast of Chile to the Geological Society. ('Geolog.\r\nSoc. Proc. ii. 1838, pages 446-449.)\r\n\r\nOn March 7th, 1837, I took lodgings in Great Marlborough Street in\r\nLondon, and remained there for nearly two years, until I was married.\r\nDuring these two years I finished my Journal, read several papers before\r\nthe Geological Society, began preparing the MS. for my 'Geological\r\nObservations,' and arranged for the publication of the 'Zoology of the\r\nVoyage of the \"Beagle\".' In July I opened my first note-book for facts\r\nin relation to the Origin of Species, about which I had long reflected,\r\nand never ceased working for the next twenty years.\r\n\r\nDuring these two years I also went a little into society, and acted as\r\none of the honorary secretaries of the Geological Society. I saw a great\r\ndeal of Lyell. One of his chief characteristics was his sympathy with\r\nthe work of others, and I was as much astonished as delighted at the\r\ninterest which he showed when, on my return to England, I explained to\r\nhim my views on coral reefs. This encouraged me greatly, and his advice\r\nand example had much influence on me. During this time I saw also a good\r\ndeal of Robert Brown; I used often to call and sit with him during his\r\nbreakfast on Sunday mornings, and he poured forth a rich treasure of\r\ncurious observations and acute remarks, but they almost always related\r\nto minute points, and he never with me discussed large or general\r\nquestions in science.\r\n\r\nDuring these two years I took several short excursions as a relaxation,\r\nand one longer one to the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, an account of\r\nwhich was published in the 'Philosophical Transactions.' (1839, pages\r\n39-82.) This paper was a great failure, and I am ashamed of it. Having\r\nbeen deeply impressed with what I had seen of the elevation of the land\r\nof South America, I attributed the parallel lines to the action of\r\nthe sea; but I had to give up this view when Agassiz propounded his\r\nglacier-lake theory. Because no other explanation was possible under our\r\nthen state of knowledge, I argued in favour of sea-action; and my error\r\nhas been a good lesson to me never to trust in science to the principle\r\nof exclusion.\r\n\r\nAs I was not able to work all day at science, I read a good deal during\r\nthese two years on various subjects, including some metaphysical books;\r\nbut I was not well fitted for such studies. About this time I took much\r\ndelight in Wordsworth's and Coleridge's poetry; and can boast that I\r\nread the 'Excursion' twice through. Formerly Milton's 'Paradise Lost'\r\nhad been my chief favourite, and in my excursions during the voyage of\r\nthe \"Beagle\", when I could take only a single volume, I always chose\r\nMilton.\r\n\r\nFROM MY MARRIAGE, JANUARY 29, 1839, AND RESIDENCE IN UPPER GOWER STREET,\r\nTO OUR LEAVING LONDON AND SETTLING AT DOWN, SEPTEMBER 14, 1842.\r\n\r\n(After speaking of his happy married life, and of his children, he\r\ncontinues:--)\r\n\r\nDuring the three years and eight months whilst we resided in London, I\r\ndid less scientific work, though I worked as hard as I possibly could,\r\nthan during any other equal length of time in my life. This was owing\r\nto frequently recurring unwellness, and to one long and serious illness.\r\nThe greater part of my time, when I could do anything, was devoted to\r\nmy work on 'Coral Reefs,' which I had begun before my marriage, and of\r\nwhich the last proof-sheet was corrected on May 6th, 1842. This book,\r\nthough a small one, cost me twenty months of hard work, as I had to read\r\nevery work on the islands of the Pacific and to consult many charts. It\r\nwas thought highly of by scientific men, and the theory therein given\r\nis, I think, now well established.\r\n\r\nNo other work of mine was begun in so deductive a spirit as this, for\r\nthe whole theory was thought out on the west coast of South America,\r\nbefore I had seen a true coral reef. I had therefore only to verify and\r\nextend my views by a careful examination of living reefs. But it should\r\nbe observed that I had during the two previous years been incessantly\r\nattending to the effects on the shores of South America of the\r\nintermittent elevation of the land, together with denudation and the\r\ndeposition of sediment. This necessarily led me to reflect much on the\r\neffects of subsidence, and it was easy to replace in imagination the\r\ncontinued deposition of sediment by the upward growth of corals. To do\r\nthis was to form my theory of the formation of barrier-reefs and atolls.\r\n\r\nBesides my work on coral-reefs, during my residence in London, I read\r\nbefore the Geological Society papers on the Erratic Boulders of South\r\nAmerica ('Geolog. Soc. Proc.' iii. 1842.), on Earthquakes ('Geolog.\r\nTrans. v. 1840.), and on the Formation by the Agency of Earth-worms of\r\nMould. ('Geolog. Soc. Proc. ii. 1838.) I also continued to superintend\r\nthe publication of the 'Zoology of the Voyage of the \"Beagle\".' Nor did\r\nI ever intermit collecting facts bearing on the origin of species; and I\r\ncould sometimes do this when I could do nothing else from illness.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1842 I was stronger than I had been for some time, and\r\ntook a little tour by myself in North Wales, for the sake of observing\r\nthe effects of the old glaciers which formerly filled all the larger\r\nvalleys. I published a short account of what I saw in the 'Philosophical\r\nMagazine.' ('Philosophical Magazine,' 1842.) This excursion interested\r\nme greatly, and it was the last time I was ever strong enough to climb\r\nmountains or to take long walks such as are necessary for geological\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of our life in London, I was strong enough to go\r\ninto general society, and saw a good deal of several scientific men, and\r\nother more or less distinguished men. I will give my impressions with\r\nrespect to some of them, though I have little to say worth saying.\r\n\r\nI saw more of Lyell than of any other man, both before and after\r\nmy marriage. His mind was characterised, as it appeared to me, by\r\nclearness, caution, sound judgment, and a good deal of originality. When\r\nI made any remark to him on Geology, he never rested until he saw the\r\nwhole case clearly, and often made me see it more clearly than I had\r\ndone before. He would advance all possible objections to my suggestion,\r\nand even after these were exhausted would long remain dubious. A second\r\ncharacteristic was his hearty sympathy with the work of other scientific\r\nmen. (The slight repetition here observable is accounted for by the\r\nnotes on Lyell, etc., having been added in April, 1881, a few years\r\nafter the rest of the 'Recollections' were written.)\r\n\r\nOn my return from the voyage of the \"Beagle\", I explained to him\r\nmy views on coral-reefs, which differed from his, and I was greatly\r\nsurprised and encouraged by the vivid interest which he showed. His\r\ndelight in science was ardent, and he felt the keenest interest in the\r\nfuture progress of mankind. He was very kind-hearted, and thoroughly\r\nliberal in his religious beliefs, or rather disbeliefs; but he was a\r\nstrong theist. His candour was highly remarkable. He exhibited this by\r\nbecoming a convert to the Descent theory, though he had gained much\r\nfame by opposing Lamarck's views, and this after he had grown old. He\r\nreminded me that I had many years before said to him, when discussing\r\nthe opposition of the old school of geologists to his new views, \"What\r\na good thing it would be if every scientific man was to die when sixty\r\nyears old, as afterwards he would be sure to oppose all new doctrines.\"\r\nBut he hoped that now he might be allowed to live.\r\n\r\nThe science of Geology is enormously indebted to Lyell--more so, as I\r\nbelieve, than to any other man who ever lived. When [I was] starting on\r\nthe voyage of the \"Beagle\", the sagacious Henslow, who, like all other\r\ngeologists, believed at that time in successive cataclysms, advised me\r\nto get and study the first volume of the 'Principles,' which had then\r\njust been published, but on no account to accept the views therein\r\nadvocated. How differently would any one now speak of the 'Principles'!\r\nI am proud to remember that the first place, namely, St. Jago, in the\r\nCape de Verde archipelago, in which I geologised, convinced me of the\r\ninfinite superiority of Lyell's views over those advocated in any other\r\nwork known to me.\r\n\r\nThe powerful effects of Lyell's works could formerly be plainly seen in\r\nthe different progress of the science in France and England. The present\r\ntotal oblivion of Elie de Beaumont's wild hypotheses, such as his\r\n'Craters of Elevation' and 'Lines of Elevation' (which latter hypothesis\r\nI heard Sedgwick at the Geological Society lauding to the skies), may be\r\nlargely attributed to Lyell.\r\n\r\nI saw a good deal of Robert Brown, \"facile Princeps Botanicorum,\" as he\r\nwas called by Humboldt. He seemed to me to be chiefly remarkable for\r\nthe minuteness of his observations, and their perfect accuracy. His\r\nknowledge was extraordinarily great, and much died with him, owing to\r\nhis excessive fear of ever making a mistake. He poured out his knowledge\r\nto me in the most unreserved manner, yet was strangely jealous on some\r\npoints. I called on him two or three times before the voyage of the\r\n\"Beagle\", and on one occasion he asked me to look through a microscope\r\nand describe what I saw. This I did, and believe now that it was the\r\nmarvellous currents of protoplasm in some vegetable cell. I then asked\r\nhim what I had seen; but he answered me, \"That is my little secret.\"\r\n\r\nHe was capable of the most generous actions. When old, much out of\r\nhealth, and quite unfit for any exertion, he daily visited (as Hooker\r\ntold me) an old man-servant, who lived at a distance (and whom he\r\nsupported), and read aloud to him. This is enough to make up for any\r\ndegree of scientific penuriousness or jealousy.\r\n\r\nI may here mention a few other eminent men, whom I have occasionally\r\nseen, but I have little to say about them worth saying. I felt a high\r\nreverence for Sir J. Herschel, and was delighted to dine with him at his\r\ncharming house at the Cape of Good Hope, and afterwards at his London\r\nhouse. I saw him, also, on a few other occasions. He never talked much,\r\nbut every word which he uttered was worth listening to.\r\n\r\nI once met at breakfast at Sir R. Murchison's house the illustrious\r\nHumboldt, who honoured me by expressing a wish to see me. I was a little\r\ndisappointed with the great man, but my anticipations probably were too\r\nhigh. I can remember nothing distinctly about our interview, except that\r\nHumboldt was very cheerful and talked much.\r\n\r\n--reminds me of Buckle whom I once met at Hensleigh Wedgwood's. I was\r\nvery glad to learn from him his system of collecting facts. He told me\r\nthat he bought all the books which he read, and made a full index, to\r\neach, of the facts which he thought might prove serviceable to him, and\r\nthat he could always remember in what book he had read anything, for his\r\nmemory was wonderful. I asked him how at first he could judge what facts\r\nwould be serviceable, and he answered that he did not know, but that a\r\nsort of instinct guided him. From this habit of making indices, he was\r\nenabled to give the astonishing number of references on all sorts of\r\nsubjects, which may be found in his 'History of Civilisation.' This book\r\nI thought most interesting, and read it twice, but I doubt whether his\r\ngeneralisations are worth anything. Buckle was a great talker, and I\r\nlistened to him saying hardly a word, nor indeed could I have done so\r\nfor he left no gaps. When Mrs. Farrer began to sing, I jumped up and\r\nsaid that I must listen to her; after I had moved away he turned around\r\nto a friend and said (as was overheard by my brother), \"Well, Mr.\r\nDarwin's books are much better than his conversation.\"\r\n\r\nOf other great literary men, I once met Sydney Smith at Dean Milman's\r\nhouse. There was something inexplicably amusing in every word which he\r\nuttered. Perhaps this was partly due to the expectation of being amused.\r\nHe was talking about Lady Cork, who was then extremely old. This was the\r\nlady who, as he said, was once so much affected by one of his charity\r\nsermons, that she BORROWED a guinea from a friend to put in the plate.\r\nHe now said \"It is generally believed that my dear old friend Lady Cork\r\nhas been overlooked,\" and he said this in such a manner that no one\r\ncould for a moment doubt that he meant that his dear old friend had been\r\noverlooked by the devil. How he managed to express this I know not.\r\n\r\nI likewise once met Macaulay at Lord Stanhope's (the historian's) house,\r\nand as there was only one other man at dinner, I had a grand opportunity\r\nof hearing him converse, and he was very agreeable. He did not talk at\r\nall too much; nor indeed could such a man talk too much, as long as he\r\nallowed others to turn the stream of his conversation, and this he did\r\nallow.\r\n\r\nLord Stanhope once gave me a curious little proof of the accuracy and\r\nfulness of Macaulay's memory: many historians used often to meet at\r\nLord Stanhope's house, and in discussing various subjects they would\r\nsometimes differ from Macaulay, and formerly they often referred to some\r\nbook to see who was right; but latterly, as Lord Stanhope noticed, no\r\nhistorian ever took this trouble, and whatever Macaulay said was final.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion I met at Lord Stanhope's house, one of his parties\r\nof historians and other literary men, and amongst them were Motley and\r\nGrote. After luncheon I walked about Chevening Park for nearly an hour\r\nwith Grote, and was much interested by his conversation and pleased by\r\nthe simplicity and absence of all pretension in his manners.\r\n\r\nLong ago I dined occasionally with the old Earl, the father of the\r\nhistorian; he was a strange man, but what little I knew of him I\r\nliked much. He was frank, genial, and pleasant. He had strongly marked\r\nfeatures, with a brown complexion, and his clothes, when I saw him,\r\nwere all brown. He seemed to believe in everything which was to others\r\nutterly incredible. He said one day to me, \"Why don't you give up your\r\nfiddle-faddle of geology and zoology, and turn to the occult sciences!\"\r\nThe historian, then Lord Mahon, seemed shocked at such a speech to me,\r\nand his charming wife much amused.\r\n\r\nThe last man whom I will mention is Carlyle, seen by me several times at\r\nmy brother's house, and two or three times at my own house. His talk was\r\nvery racy and interesting, just like his writings, but he sometimes\r\nwent on too long on the same subject. I remember a funny dinner at my\r\nbrother's, where, amongst a few others, were Babbage and Lyell, both of\r\nwhom liked to talk. Carlyle, however, silenced every one by haranguing\r\nduring the whole dinner on the advantages of silence. After dinner\r\nBabbage, in his grimmest manner, thanked Carlyle for his very\r\ninteresting lecture on silence.\r\n\r\nCarlyle sneered at almost every one: one day in my house he called\r\nGrote's 'History' \"a fetid quagmire, with nothing spiritual about it.\" I\r\nalways thought, until his 'Reminiscences' appeared, that his sneers were\r\npartly jokes, but this now seems rather doubtful. His expression was\r\nthat of a depressed, almost despondent yet benevolent man; and it is\r\nnotorious how heartily he laughed. I believe that his benevolence was\r\nreal, though stained by not a little jealousy. No one can doubt about\r\nhis extraordinary power of drawing pictures of things and men--far more\r\nvivid, as it appears to me, than any drawn by Macaulay. Whether his\r\npictures of men were true ones is another question.\r\n\r\nHe has been all-powerful in impressing some grand moral truths on the\r\nminds of men. On the other hand, his views about slavery were revolting.\r\nIn his eyes might was right. His mind seemed to me a very narrow one;\r\neven if all branches of science, which he despised, are excluded. It is\r\nastonishing to me that Kingsley should have spoken of him as a man\r\nwell fitted to advance science. He laughed to scorn the idea that a\r\nmathematician, such as Whewell, could judge, as I maintained he could,\r\nof Goethe's views on light. He thought it a most ridiculous thing that\r\nany one should care whether a glacier moved a little quicker or a little\r\nslower, or moved at all. As far as I could judge, I never met a man with\r\na mind so ill adapted for scientific research.\r\n\r\nWhilst living in London, I attended as regularly as I could the\r\nmeetings of several scientific societies, and acted as secretary to the\r\nGeological Society. But such attendance, and ordinary society, suited my\r\nhealth so badly that we resolved to live in the country, which we both\r\npreferred and have never repented of.\r\n\r\nRESIDENCE AT DOWN FROM SEPTEMBER 14, 1842, TO THE PRESENT TIME, 1876.\r\n\r\nAfter several fruitless searches in Surrey and elsewhere, we found this\r\nhouse and purchased it. I was pleased with the diversified appearance\r\nof vegetation proper to a chalk district, and so unlike what I had been\r\naccustomed to in the Midland counties; and still more pleased with the\r\nextreme quietness and rusticity of the place. It is not, however, quite\r\nso retired a place as a writer in a German periodical makes it, who\r\nsays that my house can be approached only by a mule-track! Our fixing\r\nourselves here has answered admirably in one way, which we did not\r\nanticipate, namely, by being very convenient for frequent visits from\r\nour children.\r\n\r\nFew persons can have lived a more retired life than we have done.\r\nBesides short visits to the houses of relations, and occasionally to the\r\nseaside or elsewhere, we have gone nowhere. During the first part of\r\nour residence we went a little into society, and received a few friends\r\nhere; but my health almost always suffered from the excitement, violent\r\nshivering and vomiting attacks being thus brought on. I have therefore\r\nbeen compelled for many years to give up all dinner-parties; and this\r\nhas been somewhat of a deprivation to me, as such parties always put me\r\ninto high spirits. From the same cause I have been able to invite here\r\nvery few scientific acquaintances.\r\n\r\nMy chief enjoyment and sole employment throughout life has been\r\nscientific work; and the excitement from such work makes me for the\r\ntime forget, or drives quite away, my daily discomfort. I have therefore\r\nnothing to record during the rest of my life, except the publication\r\nof my several books. Perhaps a few details how they arose may be worth\r\ngiving.\r\n\r\nMY SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1844, my observations on the volcanic islands\r\nvisited during the voyage of the \"Beagle\" were published. In 1845,\r\nI took much pains in correcting a new edition of my 'Journal of\r\nResearches,' which was originally published in 1839 as part of\r\nFitz-Roy's work. The success of this, my first literary child, always\r\ntickles my vanity more than that of any of my other books. Even to this\r\nday it sells steadily in England and the United States, and has been\r\ntranslated for the second time into German, and into French and other\r\nlanguages. This success of a book of travels, especially of a scientific\r\none, so many years after its first publication, is surprising. Ten\r\nthousand copies have been sold in England of the second edition. In 1846\r\nmy 'Geological Observations on South America' were published. I record\r\nin a little diary, which I have always kept, that my three geological\r\nbooks ('Coral Reefs' included) consumed four and a half years' steady\r\nwork; \"and now it is ten years since my return to England. How much time\r\nhave I lost by illness?\" I have nothing to say about these three books\r\nexcept that to my surprise new editions have lately been called for.\r\n('Geological Observations,' 2nd Edit.1876. 'Coral Reefs,' 2nd Edit.\r\n1874.)\r\n\r\nIn October, 1846, I began to work on 'Cirripedia.' When on the coast of\r\nChile, I found a most curious form, which burrowed into the shells of\r\nConcholepas, and which differed so much from all other Cirripedes that\r\nI had to form a new sub-order for its sole reception. Lately an allied\r\nburrowing genus has been found on the shores of Portugal. To understand\r\nthe structure of my new Cirripede I had to examine and dissect many\r\nof the common forms; and this gradually led me on to take up the whole\r\ngroup. I worked steadily on this subject for the next eight years, and\r\nultimately published two thick volumes (Published by the Ray Society.),\r\ndescribing all the known living species, and two thin quartos on the\r\nextinct species. I do not doubt that Sir E. Lytton Bulwer had me in his\r\nmind when he introduced in one of his novels a Professor Long, who had\r\nwritten two huge volumes on limpets.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was employed during eight years on this work, yet I record in\r\nmy diary that about two years out of this time was lost by illness. On\r\nthis account I went in 1848 for some months to Malvern for hydropathic\r\ntreatment, which did me much good, so that on my return home I was able\r\nto resume work. So much was I out of health that when my dear father\r\ndied on November 13th, 1848, I was unable to attend his funeral or to\r\nact as one of his executors.\r\n\r\nMy work on the Cirripedia possesses, I think, considerable value, as\r\nbesides describing several new and remarkable forms, I made out the\r\nhomologies of the various parts--I discovered the cementing apparatus,\r\nthough I blundered dreadfully about the cement glands--and lastly I\r\nproved the existence in certain genera of minute males complemental to\r\nand parasitic on the hermaphrodites. This latter discovery has at last\r\nbeen fully confirmed; though at one time a German writer was pleased to\r\nattribute the whole account to my fertile imagination. The Cirripedes\r\nform a highly varying and difficult group of species to class; and my\r\nwork was of considerable use to me, when I had to discuss in the 'Origin\r\nof Species' the principles of a natural classification. Nevertheless, I\r\ndoubt whether the work was worth the consumption of so much time.\r\n\r\nFrom September 1854 I devoted my whole time to arranging my huge pile\r\nof notes, to observing, and to experimenting in relation to the\r\ntransmutation of species. During the voyage of the \"Beagle\" I had been\r\ndeeply impressed by discovering in the Pampean formation great fossil\r\nanimals covered with armour like that on the existing armadillos;\r\nsecondly, by the manner in which closely allied animals replace one\r\nanother in proceeding southwards over the Continent; and thirdly, by\r\nthe South American character of most of the productions of the Galapagos\r\narchipelago, and more especially by the manner in which they differ\r\nslightly on each island of the group; none of the islands appearing to\r\nbe very ancient in a geological sense.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that such facts as these, as well as many others, could\r\nonly be explained on the supposition that species gradually become\r\nmodified; and the subject haunted me. But it was equally evident that\r\nneither the action of the surrounding conditions, nor the will of the\r\norganisms (especially in the case of plants) could account for the\r\ninnumerable cases in which organisms of every kind are beautifully\r\nadapted to their habits of life--for instance, a woodpecker or a\r\ntree-frog to climb trees, or a seed for dispersal by hooks or plumes. I\r\nhad always been much struck by such adaptations, and until these could\r\nbe explained it seemed to me almost useless to endeavour to prove by\r\nindirect evidence that species have been modified.\r\n\r\nAfter my return to England it appeared to me that by following the\r\nexample of Lyell in Geology, and by collecting all facts which bore in\r\nany way on the variation of animals and plants under domestication and\r\nnature, some light might perhaps be thrown on the whole subject. My\r\nfirst note-book was opened in July 1837. I worked on true Baconian\r\nprinciples, and without any theory collected facts on a wholesale scale,\r\nmore especially with respect to domesticated productions, by printed\r\nenquiries, by conversation with skilful breeders and gardeners, and by\r\nextensive reading. When I see the list of books of all kinds which\r\nI read and abstracted, including whole series of Journals and\r\nTransactions, I am surprised at my industry. I soon perceived that\r\nselection was the keystone of man's success in making useful races of\r\nanimals and plants. But how selection could be applied to organisms\r\nliving in a state of nature remained for some time a mystery to me.\r\n\r\nIn October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic\r\nenquiry, I happened to read for amusement 'Malthus on Population,'\r\nand being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which\r\neverywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of\r\nanimals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances\r\nfavourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable\r\nones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new\r\nspecies. Here then I had at last got a theory by which to work; but I\r\nwas so anxious to avoid prejudice, that I determined not for some time\r\nto write even the briefest sketch of it. In June 1842 I first allowed\r\nmyself the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my theory in\r\npencil in 35 pages; and this was enlarged during the summer of 1844 into\r\none of 230 pages, which I had fairly copied out and still possess.\r\n\r\nBut at that time I overlooked one problem of great importance; and it is\r\nastonishing to me, except on the principle of Columbus and his egg,\r\nhow I could have overlooked it and its solution. This problem is the\r\ntendency in organic beings descended from the same stock to diverge in\r\ncharacter as they become modified. That they have diverged greatly is\r\nobvious from the manner in which species of all kinds can be classed\r\nunder genera, genera under families, families under sub-orders and\r\nso forth; and I can remember the very spot in the road, whilst in my\r\ncarriage, when to my joy the solution occurred to me; and this was\r\nlong after I had come to Down. The solution, as I believe, is that the\r\nmodified offspring of all dominant and increasing forms tend to become\r\nadapted to many and highly diversified places in the economy of nature.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1856 Lyell advised me to write out my views pretty fully, and\r\nI began at once to do so on a scale three or four times as extensive as\r\nthat which was afterwards followed in my 'Origin of Species;' yet it\r\nwas only an abstract of the materials which I had collected, and I got\r\nthrough about half the work on this scale. But my plans were overthrown,\r\nfor early in the summer of 1858 Mr. Wallace, who was then in the Malay\r\narchipelago, sent me an essay \"On the Tendency of Varieties to depart\r\nindefinitely from the Original Type;\" and this essay contained exactly\r\nthe same theory as mine. Mr. Wallace expressed the wish that if I\r\nthought well of his essay, I should sent it to Lyell for perusal.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which I consented at the request of Lyell and\r\nHooker to allow of an abstract from my MS., together with a letter to\r\nAsa Gray, dated September 5, 1857, to be published at the same time with\r\nWallace's Essay, are given in the 'Journal of the Proceedings of the\r\nLinnean Society,' 1858, page 45. I was at first very unwilling\r\nto consent, as I thought Mr. Wallace might consider my doing so\r\nunjustifiable, for I did not then know how generous and noble was his\r\ndisposition. The extract from my MS. and the letter to Asa Gray had\r\nneither been intended for publication, and were badly written. Mr.\r\nWallace's essay, on the other hand, was admirably expressed and\r\nquite clear. Nevertheless, our joint productions excited very little\r\nattention, and the only published notice of them which I can remember\r\nwas by Professor Haughton of Dublin, whose verdict was that all that\r\nwas new in them was false, and what was true was old. This shows how\r\nnecessary it is that any new view should be explained at considerable\r\nlength in order to arouse public attention.\r\n\r\nIn September 1858 I set to work by the strong advice of Lyell and Hooker\r\nto prepare a volume on the transmutation of species, but was often\r\ninterrupted by ill-health, and short visits to Dr. Lane's delightful\r\nhydropathic establishment at Moor Park. I abstracted the MS. begun on a\r\nmuch larger scale in 1856, and completed the volume on the same reduced\r\nscale. It cost me thirteen months and ten days' hard labour. It was\r\npublished under the title of the 'Origin of Species,' in November 1859.\r\nThough considerably added to and corrected in the later editions, it has\r\nremained substantially the same book.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt the chief work of my life. It was from the first highly\r\nsuccessful. The first small edition of 1250 copies was sold on the day\r\nof publication, and a second edition of 3000 copies soon afterwards.\r\nSixteen thousand copies have now (1876) been sold in England; and\r\nconsidering how stiff a book it is, this is a large sale. It has been\r\ntranslated into almost every European tongue, even into such languages\r\nas Spanish, Bohemian, Polish, and Russian. It has also, according to\r\nMiss Bird, been translated into Japanese (Miss Bird is mistaken, as I\r\nlearn from Prof. Mitsukuri.--F.D.), and is there much studied. Even an\r\nessay in Hebrew has appeared on it, showing that the theory is contained\r\nin the Old Testament! The reviews were very numerous; for some time I\r\ncollected all that appeared on the 'Origin' and on my related books, and\r\nthese amount (excluding newspaper reviews) to 265; but after a time I\r\ngave up the attempt in despair. Many separate essays and books on the\r\nsubject have appeared; and in Germany a catalogue or bibliography on\r\n\"Darwinismus\" has appeared every year or two.\r\n\r\nThe success of the 'Origin' may, I think, be attributed in large part to\r\nmy having long before written two condensed sketches, and to my having\r\nfinally abstracted a much larger manuscript, which was itself an\r\nabstract. By this means I was enabled to select the more striking facts\r\nand conclusions. I had, also, during many years followed a golden rule,\r\nnamely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought\r\ncame across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a\r\nmemorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience\r\nthat such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory\r\nthan favourable ones. Owing to this habit, very few objections were\r\nraised against my views which I had not at least noticed and attempted\r\nto answer.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been said that the success of the 'Origin' proved \"that\r\nthe subject was in the air,\" or \"that men's minds were prepared for it.\"\r\nI do not think that this is strictly true, for I occasionally sounded\r\nnot a few naturalists, and never happened to come across a single one\r\nwho seemed to doubt about the permanence of species. Even Lyell and\r\nHooker, though they would listen with interest to me, never seemed to\r\nagree. I tried once or twice to explain to able men what I meant by\r\nNatural Selection, but signally failed. What I believe was strictly\r\ntrue is that innumerable well-observed facts were stored in the minds\r\nof naturalists ready to take their proper places as soon as any theory\r\nwhich would receive them was sufficiently explained. Another element\r\nin the success of the book was its moderate size; and this I owe to the\r\nappearance of Mr. Wallace's essay; had I published on the scale in which\r\nI began to write in 1856, the book would have been four or five times as\r\nlarge as the 'Origin,' and very few would have had the patience to read\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI gained much by my delay in publishing from about 1839, when the theory\r\nwas clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it, for I cared\r\nvery little whether men attributed most originality to me or Wallace;\r\nand his essay no doubt aided in the reception of the theory. I was\r\nforestalled in only one important point, which my vanity has always made\r\nme regret, namely, the explanation by means of the Glacial period of\r\nthe presence of the same species of plants and of some few animals on\r\ndistant mountain summits and in the arctic regions. This view pleased me\r\nso much that I wrote it out in extenso, and I believe that it was read\r\nby Hooker some years before E. Forbes published his celebrated memoir\r\n('Geolog. Survey Mem.,' 1846.) on the subject. In the very few points in\r\nwhich we differed, I still think that I was in the right. I have never,\r\nof course, alluded in print to my having independently worked out this\r\nview.\r\n\r\nHardly any point gave me so much satisfaction when I was at work on\r\nthe 'Origin,' as the explanation of the wide difference in many classes\r\nbetween the embryo and the adult animal, and of the close resemblance of\r\nthe embryos within the same class. No notice of this point was taken, as\r\nfar as I remember, in the early reviews of the 'Origin,' and I recollect\r\nexpressing my surprise on this head in a letter to Asa Gray. Within late\r\nyears several reviewers have given the whole credit to Fritz Muller and\r\nHackel, who undoubtedly have worked it out much more fully, and in some\r\nrespects more correctly than I did. I had materials for a whole chapter\r\non the subject, and I ought to have made the discussion longer; for it\r\nis clear that I failed to impress my readers; and he who succeeds in\r\ndoing so deserves, in my opinion, all the credit.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to remark that I have almost always been treated honestly\r\nby my reviewers, passing over those without scientific knowledge as\r\nnot worthy of notice. My views have often been grossly misrepresented,\r\nbitterly opposed and ridiculed, but this has been generally done, as I\r\nbelieve, in good faith. On the whole I do not doubt that my works have\r\nbeen over and over again greatly overpraised. I rejoice that I have\r\navoided controversies, and this I owe to Lyell, who many years ago,\r\nin reference to my geological works, strongly advised me never to get\r\nentangled in a controversy, as it rarely did any good and caused a\r\nmiserable loss of time and temper.\r\n\r\nWhenever I have found out that I have blundered, or that my work has\r\nbeen imperfect, and when I have been contemptuously criticised, and even\r\nwhen I have been overpraised, so that I have felt mortified, it has\r\nbeen my greatest comfort to say hundreds of times to myself that \"I\r\nhave worked as hard and as well as I could, and no man can do more\r\nthan this.\" I remember when in Good Success Bay, in Tierra del Fuego,\r\nthinking (and, I believe, that I wrote home to the effect) that I could\r\nnot employ my life better than in adding a little to Natural Science.\r\nThis I have done to the best of my abilities, and critics may say what\r\nthey like, but they cannot destroy this conviction.\r\n\r\nDuring the two last months of 1859 I was fully occupied in preparing a\r\nsecond edition of the 'Origin,' and by an enormous correspondence.\r\nOn January 1st, 1860, I began arranging my notes for my work on the\r\n'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication;' but it was not\r\npublished until the beginning of 1868; the delay having been caused\r\npartly by frequent illnesses, one of which lasted seven months, and\r\npartly by being tempted to publish on other subjects which at the time\r\ninterested me more.\r\n\r\nOn May 15th, 1862, my little book on the 'Fertilisation of Orchids,'\r\nwhich cost me ten months' work, was published: most of the facts had\r\nbeen slowly accumulated during several previous years. During the summer\r\nof 1839, and, I believe, during the previous summer, I was led to attend\r\nto the cross-fertilisation of flowers by the aid of insects, from having\r\ncome to the conclusion in my speculations on the origin of species, that\r\ncrossing played an important part in keeping specific forms constant. I\r\nattended to the subject more or less during every subsequent summer; and\r\nmy interest in it was greatly enhanced by having procured and read\r\nin November 1841, through the advice of Robert Brown, a copy of C.K.\r\nSprengel's wonderful book, 'Das entdeckte Geheimniss der Natur.' For\r\nsome years before 1862 I had specially attended to the fertilisation\r\nof our British orchids; and it seemed to me the best plan to prepare as\r\ncomplete a treatise on this group of plants as well as I could, rather\r\nthan to utilise the great mass of matter which I had slowly collected\r\nwith respect to other plants.\r\n\r\nMy resolve proved a wise one; for since the appearance of my book, a\r\nsurprising number of papers and separate works on the fertilisation of\r\nall kinds of flowers have appeared: and these are far better done than\r\nI could possibly have effected. The merits of poor old Sprengel, so long\r\noverlooked, are now fully recognised many years after his death.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year I published in the 'Journal of the Linnean Society'\r\na paper \"On the Two Forms, or Dimorphic Condition of Primula,\"\r\nand during the next five years, five other papers on dimorphic and\r\ntrimorphic plants. I do not think anything in my scientific life has\r\ngiven me so much satisfaction as making out the meaning of the structure\r\nof these plants. I had noticed in 1838 or 1839 the dimorphism of Linum\r\nflavum, and had at first thought that it was merely a case of unmeaning\r\nvariability. But on examining the common species of Primula I found that\r\nthe two forms were much too regular and constant to be thus viewed. I\r\ntherefore became almost convinced that the common cowslip and primrose\r\nwere on the high road to become dioecious;--that the short pistil in the\r\none form, and the short stamens in the other form were tending towards\r\nabortion. The plants were therefore subjected under this point of view\r\nto trial; but as soon as the flowers with short pistils fertilised with\r\npollen from the short stamens, were found to yield more seeds than any\r\nother of the four possible unions, the abortion-theory was knocked on\r\nthe head. After some additional experiment, it became evident that the\r\ntwo forms, though both were perfect hermaphrodites, bore almost the same\r\nrelation to one another as do the two sexes of an ordinary animal. With\r\nLythrum we have the still more wonderful case of three forms standing in\r\na similar relation to one another. I afterwards found that the offspring\r\nfrom the union of two plants belonging to the same forms presented a\r\nclose and curious analogy with hybrids from the union of two distinct\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1864 I finished a long paper on 'Climbing Plants,' and\r\nsent it to the Linnean Society. The writing of this paper cost me four\r\nmonths; but I was so unwell when I received the proof-sheets that I was\r\nforced to leave them very badly and often obscurely expressed. The paper\r\nwas little noticed, but when in 1875 it was corrected and published as a\r\nseparate book it sold well. I was led to take up this subject by reading\r\na short paper by Asa Gray, published in 1858. He sent me seeds, and\r\non raising some plants I was so much fascinated and perplexed by the\r\nrevolving movements of the tendrils and stems, which movements are\r\nreally very simple, though appearing at first sight very complex, that\r\nI procured various other kinds of climbing plants, and studied the\r\nwhole subject. I was all the more attracted to it, from not being at all\r\nsatisfied with the explanation which Henslow gave us in his lectures,\r\nabout twining plants, namely, that they had a natural tendency to grow\r\nup in a spire. This explanation proved quite erroneous. Some of the\r\nadaptations displayed by Climbing Plants are as beautiful as those of\r\nOrchids for ensuring cross-fertilisation.\r\n\r\nMy 'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication' was begun, as\r\nalready stated, in the beginning of 1860, but was not published until\r\nthe beginning of 1868. It was a big book, and cost me four years and two\r\nmonths' hard labour. It gives all my observations and an immense number\r\nof facts collected from various sources, about our domestic productions.\r\nIn the second volume the causes and laws of variation, inheritance,\r\netc., are discussed as far as our present state of knowledge permits.\r\nTowards the end of the work I give my well-abused hypothesis of\r\nPangenesis. An unverified hypothesis is of little or no value; but if\r\nany one should hereafter be led to make observations by which some such\r\nhypothesis could be established, I shall have done good service, as an\r\nastonishing number of isolated facts can be thus connected together and\r\nrendered intelligible. In 1875 a second and largely corrected edition,\r\nwhich cost me a good deal of labour, was brought out.\r\n\r\nMy 'Descent of Man' was published in February, 1871. As soon as I had\r\nbecome, in the year 1837 or 1838, convinced that species were mutable\r\nproductions, I could not avoid the belief that man must come under\r\nthe same law. Accordingly I collected notes on the subject for my own\r\nsatisfaction, and not for a long time with any intention of publishing.\r\nAlthough in the 'Origin of Species' the derivation of any particular\r\nspecies is never discussed, yet I thought it best, in order that no\r\nhonourable man should accuse me of concealing my views, to add that by\r\nthe work \"light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\"\r\nIt would have been useless and injurious to the success of the book to\r\nhave paraded, without giving any evidence, my conviction with respect to\r\nhis origin.\r\n\r\nBut when I found that many naturalists fully accepted the doctrine of\r\nthe evolution of species, it seemed to me advisable to work up such\r\nnotes as I possessed, and to publish a special treatise on the origin of\r\nman. I was the more glad to do so, as it gave me an opportunity of\r\nfully discussing sexual selection--a subject which had always greatly\r\ninterested me. This subject, and that of the variation of our\r\ndomestic productions, together with the causes and laws of variation,\r\ninheritance, and the intercrossing of plants, are the sole subjects\r\nwhich I have been able to write about in full, so as to use all the\r\nmaterials which I have collected. The 'Descent of Man' took me three\r\nyears to write, but then as usual some of this time was lost by ill\r\nhealth, and some was consumed by preparing new editions and other minor\r\nworks. A second and largely corrected edition of the 'Descent' appeared\r\nin 1874.\r\n\r\nMy book on the 'Expression of the Emotions in Men and Animals' was\r\npublished in the autumn of 1872. I had intended to give only a chapter\r\non the subject in the 'Descent of Man,' but as soon as I began to put my\r\nnotes together, I saw that it would require a separate treatise.\r\n\r\nMy first child was born on December 27th, 1839, and I at once commenced\r\nto make notes on the first dawn of the various expressions which he\r\nexhibited, for I felt convinced, even at this early period, that the\r\nmost complex and fine shades of expression must all have had a gradual\r\nand natural origin. During the summer of the following year, 1840,\r\nI read Sir C. Bell's admirable work on expression, and this greatly\r\nincreased the interest which I felt in the subject, though I could not\r\nat all agree with his belief that various muscles had been specially\r\ncreated for the sake of expression. From this time forward I\r\noccasionally attended to the subject, both with respect to man and our\r\ndomesticated animals. My book sold largely; 5267 copies having been\r\ndisposed of on the day of publication.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1860 I was idling and resting near Hartfield, where two\r\nspecies of Drosera abound; and I noticed that numerous insects had been\r\nentrapped by the leaves. I carried home some plants, and on giving them\r\ninsects saw the movements of the tentacles, and this made me think\r\nit probable that the insects were caught for some special purpose.\r\nFortunately a crucial test occurred to me, that of placing a large\r\nnumber of leaves in various nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous fluids of\r\nequal density; and as soon as I found that the former alone excited\r\nenergetic movements, it was obvious that here was a fine new field for\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nDuring subsequent years, whenever I had leisure, I pursued my\r\nexperiments, and my book on 'Insectivorous Plants' was published in July\r\n1875--that is, sixteen years after my first observations. The delay in\r\nthis case, as with all my other books, has been a great advantage to me;\r\nfor a man after a long interval can criticise his own work, almost as\r\nwell as if it were that of another person. The fact that a plant should\r\nsecrete, when properly excited, a fluid containing an acid and ferment,\r\nclosely analogous to the digestive fluid of an animal, was certainly a\r\nremarkable discovery.\r\n\r\nDuring this autumn of 1876 I shall publish on the 'Effects of Cross\r\nand Self-Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom.' This book will form a\r\ncomplement to that on the 'Fertilisation of Orchids,' in which I showed\r\nhow perfect were the means for cross-fertilisation, and here I shall\r\nshow how important are the results. I was led to make, during eleven\r\nyears, the numerous experiments recorded in this volume, by a mere\r\naccidental observation; and indeed it required the accident to be\r\nrepeated before my attention was thoroughly aroused to the remarkable\r\nfact that seedlings of self-fertilised parentage are inferior, even\r\nin the first generation, in height and vigour to seedlings of\r\ncross-fertilised parentage. I hope also to republish a revised edition\r\nof my book on Orchids, and hereafter my papers on dimorphic and\r\ntrimorphic plants, together with some additional observations on allied\r\npoints which I never have had time to arrange. My strength will then\r\nprobably be exhausted, and I shall be ready to exclaim \"Nunc dimittis.\"\r\n\r\nWRITTEN MAY 1ST, 1881.\r\n\r\n'The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilisation' was published in the\r\nautumn of 1876; and the results there arrived at explain, as I believe,\r\nthe endless and wonderful contrivances for the transportal of pollen\r\nfrom one plant to another of the same species. I now believe, however,\r\nchiefly from the observations of Hermann Muller, that I ought to\r\nhave insisted more strongly than I did on the many adaptations for\r\nself-fertilisation; though I was well aware of many such adaptations. A\r\nmuch enlarged edition of my 'Fertilisation of Orchids' was published in\r\n1877.\r\n\r\nIn this same year 'The Different Forms of Flowers, etc.,' appeared,\r\nand in 1880 a second edition. This book consists chiefly of the several\r\npapers on Heterostyled flowers originally published by the Linnean\r\nSociety, corrected, with much new matter added, together with\r\nobservations on some other cases in which the same plant bears two kinds\r\nof flowers. As before remarked, no little discovery of mine ever gave me\r\nso much pleasure as the making out the meaning of heterostyled flowers.\r\nThe results of crossing such flowers in an illegitimate manner, I\r\nbelieve to be very important, as bearing on the sterility of hybrids;\r\nalthough these results have been noticed by only a few persons.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, I had a translation of Dr. Ernst Krause's 'Life of Erasmus\r\nDarwin' published, and I added a sketch of his character and habits from\r\nmaterial in my possession. Many persons have been much interested by\r\nthis little life, and I am surprised that only 800 or 900 copies were\r\nsold.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 I published, with [my son] Frank's assistance, our 'Power of\r\nMovement in Plants.' This was a tough piece of work. The book bears\r\nsomewhat the same relation to my little book on 'Climbing Plants,' which\r\n'Cross-Fertilisation' did to the 'Fertilisation of Orchids;' for in\r\naccordance with the principle of evolution it was impossible to account\r\nfor climbing plants having been developed in so many widely different\r\ngroups unless all kinds of plants possess some slight power of movement\r\nof an analogous kind. This I proved to be the case; and I was further\r\nled to a rather wide generalisation, viz. that the great and important\r\nclasses of movements, excited by light, the attraction of gravity, etc.,\r\nare all modified forms of the fundamental movement of circumnutation. It\r\nhas always pleased me to exalt plants in the scale of organised beings;\r\nand I therefore felt an especial pleasure in showing how many and what\r\nadmirably well adapted movements the tip of a root possesses.\r\n\r\nI have now (May 1, 1881) sent to the printers the MS. of a little book\r\non 'The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Action of Worms.' This\r\nis a subject of but small importance; and I know not whether it will\r\ninterest any readers (Between November 1881 and February 1884, 8500\r\ncopies have been sold.), but it has interested me. It is the completion\r\nof a short paper read before the Geological Society more than forty\r\nyears ago, and has revived old geological thoughts.\r\n\r\nI have now mentioned all the books which I have published, and these\r\nhave been the milestones in my life, so that little remains to be said.\r\nI am not conscious of any change in my mind during the last thirty\r\nyears, excepting in one point presently to be mentioned; nor, indeed,\r\ncould any change have been expected unless one of general deterioration.\r\nBut my father lived to his eighty-third year with his mind as lively as\r\never it was, and all his faculties undimmed; and I hope that I may die\r\nbefore my mind fails to a sensible extent. I think that I have become\r\na little more skilful in guessing right explanations and in devising\r\nexperimental tests; but this may probably be the result of mere\r\npractice, and of a larger store of knowledge. I have as much difficulty\r\nas ever in expressing myself clearly and concisely; and this difficulty\r\nhas caused me a very great loss of time; but it has had the compensating\r\nadvantage of forcing me to think long and intently about every sentence,\r\nand thus I have been led to see errors in reasoning and in my own\r\nobservations or those of others.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a sort of fatality in my mind leading me to put at\r\nfirst my statement or proposition in a wrong or awkward form. Formerly\r\nI used to think about my sentences before writing them down; but for\r\nseveral years I have found that it saves time to scribble in a vile hand\r\nwhole pages as quickly as I possibly can, contracting half the words;\r\nand then correct deliberately. Sentences thus scribbled down are often\r\nbetter ones than I could have written deliberately.\r\n\r\nHaving said thus much about my manner of writing, I will add that with\r\nmy large books I spend a good deal of time over the general arrangement\r\nof the matter. I first make the rudest outline in two or three pages,\r\nand then a larger one in several pages, a few words or one word standing\r\nfor a whole discussion or series of facts. Each one of these headings is\r\nagain enlarged and often transferred before I begin to write in extenso.\r\nAs in several of my books facts observed by others have been very\r\nextensively used, and as I have always had several quite distinct\r\nsubjects in hand at the same time, I may mention that I keep from thirty\r\nto forty large portfolios, in cabinets with labelled shelves, into which\r\nI can at once put a detached reference or memorandum. I have bought many\r\nbooks, and at their ends I make an index of all the facts that concern\r\nmy work; or, if the book is not my own, write out a separate abstract,\r\nand of such abstracts I have a large drawer full. Before beginning\r\non any subject I look to all the short indexes and make a general and\r\nclassified index, and by taking the one or more proper portfolios I have\r\nall the information collected during my life ready for use.\r\n\r\nI have said that in one respect my mind has changed during the last\r\ntwenty or thirty years. Up to the age of thirty, or beyond it, poetry\r\nof many kinds, such as the works of Milton, Gray, Byron, Wordsworth,\r\nColeridge, and Shelley, gave me great pleasure, and even as a schoolboy\r\nI took intense delight in Shakespeare, especially in the historical\r\nplays. I have also said that formerly pictures gave me considerable, and\r\nmusic very great delight. But now for many years I cannot endure to read\r\na line of poetry: I have tried lately to read Shakespeare, and found\r\nit so intolerably dull that it nauseated me. I have also almost lost\r\nmy taste for pictures or music. Music generally sets me thinking too\r\nenergetically on what I have been at work on, instead of giving me\r\npleasure. I retain some taste for fine scenery, but it does not cause me\r\nthe exquisite delight which it formerly did. On the other hand, novels\r\nwhich are works of the imagination, though not of a very high order,\r\nhave been for years a wonderful relief and pleasure to me, and I often\r\nbless all novelists. A surprising number have been read aloud to me, and\r\nI like all if moderately good, and if they do not end unhappily--against\r\nwhich a law ought to be passed. A novel, according to my taste, does not\r\ncome into the first class unless it contains some person whom one can\r\nthoroughly love, and if a pretty woman all the better.\r\n\r\nThis curious and lamentable loss of the higher aesthetic tastes is all\r\nthe odder, as books on history, biographies, and travels (independently\r\nof any scientific facts which they may contain), and essays on all sorts\r\nof subjects interest me as much as ever they did. My mind seems to\r\nhave become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large\r\ncollections of facts, but why this should have caused the atrophy of\r\nthat part of the brain alone, on which the higher tastes depend, I\r\ncannot conceive. A man with a mind more highly organised or better\r\nconstituted than mine, would not, I suppose, have thus suffered; and\r\nif I had to live my life again, I would have made a rule to read some\r\npoetry and listen to some music at least once every week; for perhaps\r\nthe parts of my brain now atrophied would thus have been kept active\r\nthrough use. The loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness, and may\r\npossibly be injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral\r\ncharacter, by enfeebling the emotional part of our nature.\r\n\r\nMy books have sold largely in England, have been translated into many\r\nlanguages, and passed through several editions in foreign countries. I\r\nhave heard it said that the success of a work abroad is the best test\r\nof its enduring value. I doubt whether this is at all trustworthy; but\r\njudged by this standard my name ought to last for a few years. Therefore\r\nit may be worth while to try to analyse the mental qualities and the\r\nconditions on which my success has depended; though I am aware that no\r\nman can do this correctly.\r\n\r\nI have no great quickness of apprehension or wit which is so remarkable\r\nin some clever men, for instance, Huxley. I am therefore a poor critic:\r\na paper or book, when first read, generally excites my admiration,\r\nand it is only after considerable reflection that I perceive the weak\r\npoints. My power to follow a long and purely abstract train of thought\r\nis very limited; and therefore I could never have succeeded with\r\nmetaphysics or mathematics. My memory is extensive, yet hazy: it\r\nsuffices to make me cautious by vaguely telling me that I have observed\r\nor read something opposed to the conclusion which I am drawing, or\r\non the other hand in favour of it; and after a time I can generally\r\nrecollect where to search for my authority. So poor in one sense is my\r\nmemory, that I have never been able to remember for more than a few days\r\na single date or a line of poetry.\r\n\r\nSome of my critics have said, \"Oh, he is a good observer, but he has\r\nno power of reasoning!\" I do not think that this can be true, for the\r\n'Origin of Species' is one long argument from the beginning to the end,\r\nand it has convinced not a few able men. No one could have written\r\nit without having some power of reasoning. I have a fair share of\r\ninvention, and of common sense or judgment, such as every fairly\r\nsuccessful lawyer or doctor must have, but not, I believe, in any higher\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nOn the favourable side of the balance, I think that I am superior to the\r\ncommon run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention, and\r\nin observing them carefully. My industry has been nearly as great as it\r\ncould have been in the observation and collection of facts. What is far\r\nmore important, my love of natural science has been steady and ardent.\r\n\r\nThis pure love has, however, been much aided by the ambition to be\r\nesteemed by my fellow naturalists. From my early youth I have had the\r\nstrongest desire to understand or explain whatever I observed,--that is,\r\nto group all facts under some general laws. These causes combined have\r\ngiven me the patience to reflect or ponder for any number of years over\r\nany unexplained problem. As far as I can judge, I am not apt to follow\r\nblindly the lead of other men. I have steadily endeavoured to keep my\r\nmind free so as to give up any hypothesis, however much beloved (and I\r\ncannot resist forming one on every subject), as soon as facts are shown\r\nto be opposed to it. Indeed, I have had no choice but to act in this\r\nmanner, for with the exception of the Coral Reefs, I cannot remember a\r\nsingle first-formed hypothesis which had not after a time to be given\r\nup or greatly modified. This has naturally led me to distrust greatly\r\ndeductive reasoning in the mixed sciences. On the other hand, I am not\r\nvery sceptical,--a frame of mind which I believe to be injurious to the\r\nprogress of science. A good deal of scepticism in a scientific man is\r\nadvisable to avoid much loss of time, but I have met with not a few\r\nmen, who, I feel sure, have often thus been deterred from experiment\r\nor observations, which would have proved directly or indirectly\r\nserviceable.\r\n\r\nIn illustration, I will give the oddest case which I have known. A\r\ngentleman (who, as I afterwards heard, is a good local botanist) wrote\r\nto me from the Eastern counties that the seed or beans of the common\r\nfield-bean had this year everywhere grown on the wrong side of the pod.\r\nI wrote back, asking for further information, as I did not understand\r\nwhat was meant; but I did not receive any answer for a very long time.\r\nI then saw in two newspapers, one published in Kent and the other in\r\nYorkshire, paragraphs stating that it was a most remarkable fact that\r\n\"the beans this year had all grown on the wrong side.\" So I thought\r\nthere must be some foundation for so general a statement. Accordingly,\r\nI went to my gardener, an old Kentish man, and asked him whether he had\r\nheard anything about it, and he answered, \"Oh, no, sir, it must be a\r\nmistake, for the beans grow on the wrong side only on leap-year, and\r\nthis is not leap-year.\" I then asked him how they grew in common years\r\nand how on leap-years, but soon found that he knew absolutely nothing of\r\nhow they grew at any time, but he stuck to his belief.\r\n\r\nAfter a time I heard from my first informant, who, with many apologies,\r\nsaid that he should not have written to me had he not heard the\r\nstatement from several intelligent farmers; but that he had since spoken\r\nagain to every one of them, and not one knew in the least what he had\r\nhimself meant. So that here a belief--if indeed a statement with no\r\ndefinite idea attached to it can be called a belief--had spread over\r\nalmost the whole of England without any vestige of evidence.\r\n\r\nI have known in the course of my life only three intentionally falsified\r\nstatements, and one of these may have been a hoax (and there have\r\nbeen several scientific hoaxes) which, however, took in an American\r\nAgricultural Journal. It related to the formation in Holland of a new\r\nbreed of oxen by the crossing of distinct species of Bos (some of which\r\nI happen to know are sterile together), and the author had the impudence\r\nto state that he had corresponded with me, and that I had been deeply\r\nimpressed with the importance of his result. The article was sent to me\r\nby the editor of an English Agricultural Journal, asking for my opinion\r\nbefore republishing it.\r\n\r\nA second case was an account of several varieties, raised by the author\r\nfrom several species of Primula, which had spontaneously yielded a\r\nfull complement of seed, although the parent plants had been carefully\r\nprotected from the access of insects. This account was published before\r\nI had discovered the meaning of heterostylism, and the whole statement\r\nmust have been fraudulent, or there was neglect in excluding insects so\r\ngross as to be scarcely credible.\r\n\r\nThe third case was more curious: Mr. Huth published in his book on\r\n'Consanguineous Marriage' some long extracts from a Belgian author, who\r\nstated that he had interbred rabbits in the closest manner for very\r\nmany generations, without the least injurious effects. The account was\r\npublished in a most respectable Journal, that of the Royal Society of\r\nBelgium; but I could not avoid feeling doubts--I hardly know why, except\r\nthat there were no accidents of any kind, and my experience in breeding\r\nanimals made me think this very improbable.\r\n\r\nSo with much hesitation I wrote to Professor Van Beneden, asking him\r\nwhether the author was a trustworthy man. I soon heard in answer that\r\nthe Society had been greatly shocked by discovering that the whole\r\naccount was a fraud. (The falseness of the published statements on which\r\nMr. Huth relied has been pointed out by himself in a slip inserted in\r\nall the copies of his book which then remained unsold.) The writer had\r\nbeen publicly challenged in the Journal to say where he had resided and\r\nkept his large stock of rabbits while carrying on his experiments, which\r\nmust have consumed several years, and no answer could be extracted from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMy habits are methodical, and this has been of not a little use for\r\nmy particular line of work. Lastly, I have had ample leisure from not\r\nhaving to earn my own bread. Even ill-health, though it has annihilated\r\nseveral years of my life, has saved me from the distractions of society\r\nand amusement.\r\n\r\nTherefore my success as a man of science, whatever this may have\r\namounted to, has been determined, as far as I can judge, by complex\r\nand diversified mental qualities and conditions. Of these, the most\r\nimportant have been--the love of science--unbounded patience in long\r\nreflecting over any subject--industry in observing and collecting\r\nfacts--and a fair share of invention as well as of common sense. With\r\nsuch moderate abilities as I possess, it is truly surprising that I\r\nshould have influenced to a considerable extent the belief of scientific\r\nmen on some important points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.III. -- REMINISCENCES OF MY FATHER'S EVERYDAY LIFE.\r\n\r\nIt is my wish in the present chapter to give some idea of my father's\r\neveryday life. It has seemed to me that I might carry out this object\r\nin the form of a rough sketch of a day's life at Down, interspersed\r\nwith such recollections as are called up by the record. Many of these\r\nrecollections, which have a meaning for those who knew my father, will\r\nseem colourless or trifling to strangers. Nevertheless, I give them\r\nin the hope that they may help to preserve that impression of his\r\npersonality which remains on the minds of those who knew and loved\r\nhim--an impression at once so vivid and so untranslatable into words.\r\n\r\nOf his personal appearance (in these days of multiplied photographs) it\r\nis hardly necessary to say much. He was about six feet in height, but\r\nscarcely looked so tall, as he stooped a good deal; in later days he\r\nyielded to the stoop; but I can remember seeing him long ago swinging\r\nhis arms back to open out his chest, and holding himself upright with a\r\njerk. He gave one the idea that he had been active rather than strong;\r\nhis shoulders were not broad for his height, though certainly not\r\nnarrow. As a young man he must have had much endurance, for on one of\r\nthe shore excursions from the \"Beagle\", when all were suffering from\r\nwant of water, he was one of the two who were better able than the rest\r\nto struggle on in search of it. As a boy he was active, and could jump a\r\nbar placed at the height of the \"Adam's apple\" in his neck.\r\n\r\nHe walked with a swinging action, using a stick heavily shod with iron,\r\nwhich he struck loudly against the ground, producing as he went round\r\nthe \"Sand-walk\" at Down, a rhythmical click which is with all of us a\r\nvery distinct remembrance. As he returned from the midday walk, often\r\ncarrying the waterproof or cloak which had proved too hot, one could see\r\nthat the swinging step was kept up by something of an effort. Indoors\r\nhis step was often slow and laboured, and as he went upstairs in the\r\nafternoon he might be heard mounting the stairs with a heavy footfall,\r\nas if each step were an effort. When interested in his work he moved\r\nabout quickly and easily enough, and often in the middle of dictating\r\nhe went eagerly into the hall to get a pinch of snuff, leaving the study\r\ndoor open, and calling out the last words of his sentence as he went.\r\nIndoors he sometimes used an oak stick like a little alpenstock, and\r\nthis was a sign that he felt giddiness.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his strength and activity, I think he must always have had a\r\nclumsiness of movement. He was naturally awkward with his hands, and\r\nwas unable to draw at all well. (The figure representing the aggregated\r\ncell-contents in 'Insectivorous Plants' was drawn by him.) This he\r\nalways regretted much, and he frequently urged the paramount necessity\r\nof a young naturalist making himself a good draughtsman.\r\n\r\nHe could dissect well under the simple microscope, but I think it was by\r\ndint of his great patience and carefulness. It was characteristic of him\r\nthat he thought many little bits of skilful dissection something almost\r\nsuperhuman. He used to speak with admiration of the skill with which he\r\nsaw Newport dissect a humble bee, getting out the nervous system with\r\na few cuts of a fine pair of scissors, held, as my father used to show,\r\nwith the elbow raised, and in an attitude which certainly would render\r\ngreat steadiness necessary. He used to consider cutting sections a great\r\nfeat, and in the last year of his life, with wonderful energy, took the\r\npains to learn to cut sections of roots and leaves. His hand was not\r\nsteady enough to hold the object to be cut, and he employed a common\r\nmicrotome, in which the pith for holding the object was clamped, and the\r\nrazor slid on a glass surface in making the sections. He used to laugh\r\nat himself, and at his own skill in section-cutting, at which he would\r\nsay he was \"speechless with admiration.\" On the other hand, he must have\r\nhad accuracy of eye and power of co-ordinating his movements, since he\r\nwas a good shot with a gun as a young man, and as a boy was skilful\r\nin throwing. He once killed a hare sitting in the flower-garden at\r\nShrewsbury by throwing a marble at it, and, as a man, he once killed a\r\ncross-beak with a stone. He was so unhappy at having uselessly killed\r\nthe cross-beak that he did not mention it for years, and then explained\r\nthat he should never have thrown at it if he had not felt sure that his\r\nold skill had gone from him.\r\n\r\nWhen walking he had a fidgetting movement with his fingers, which he has\r\ndescribed in one of his books as the habit of an old man. When he sat\r\nstill he often took hold of one wrist with the other hand; he sat with\r\nhis legs crossed, and from being so thin they could be crossed very far,\r\nas may be seen in one of the photographs. He had his chair in the study\r\nand in the drawing-room raised so as to be much higher than ordinary\r\nchairs; this was done because sitting on a low or even an ordinary chair\r\ncaused him some discomfort. We used to laugh at him for making his tall\r\ndrawing-room chair still higher by putting footstools on it, and then\r\nneutralising the result by resting his feet on another chair.\r\n\r\nHis beard was full and almost untrimmed, the hair being grey and\r\nwhite, fine rather than coarse, and wavy or frizzled. His moustache was\r\nsomewhat disfigured by being cut short and square across. He became very\r\nbald, having only a fringe of dark hair behind.\r\n\r\nHis face was ruddy in colour, and this perhaps made people think him\r\nless of an invalid than he was. He wrote to Dr. Hooker (June 13, 1849),\r\n\"Every one tells me that I look quite blooming and beautiful; and most\r\nthink I am shamming, but you have never been one of those.\" And it must\r\nbe remembered that at this time he was miserably ill, far worse than\r\nin later years. His eyes were bluish grey under deep overhanging\r\nbrows, with thick bushy projecting eyebrows. His high forehead was\r\nmuch wrinkled, but otherwise his face was not much marked or lined. His\r\nexpression showed no signs of the continual discomfort he suffered.\r\n\r\nWhen he was excited with pleasant talk his whole manner was wonderfully\r\nbright and animated, and his face shared to the full in the general\r\nanimation. His laugh was a free and sounding peal, like that of a man\r\nwho gives himself sympathetically and with enjoyment to the person and\r\nthe thing which have amused him. He often used some sort of gesture\r\nwith his laugh, lifting up his hands or bringing one down with a slap.\r\nI think, generally speaking, he was given to gesture, and often used his\r\nhands in explaining anything (e.g. the fertilisation of a flower) in a\r\nway that seemed rather an aid to himself than to the listener. He did\r\nthis on occasions when most people would illustrate their explanations\r\nby means of a rough pencil sketch.\r\n\r\nHe wore dark clothes, of a loose and easy fit. Of late years he gave up\r\nthe tall hat even in London, and wore a soft black one in winter, and\r\na big straw hat in summer. His usual out-of-doors dress was the short\r\ncloak in which Elliot and Fry's photograph represents him leaning\r\nagainst the pillar of the verandah. Two peculiarities of his indoor\r\ndress were that he almost always wore a shawl over his shoulders, and\r\nthat he had great loose cloth boots lined with fur which he could slip\r\non over his indoor shoes. Like most delicate people he suffered from\r\nheat as well as from chilliness; it was as if he could not hit the\r\nbalance between too hot and too cold; often a mental cause would make\r\nhim too hot, so that he would take off his coat if anything went wrong\r\nin the course of his work.\r\n\r\nHe rose early, chiefly because he could not lie in bed, and I think he\r\nwould have liked to get up earlier than he did. He took a short turn\r\nbefore breakfast, a habit which began when he went for the first time to\r\na water-cure establishment. This habit he kept up till almost the end\r\nof his life. I used, as a little boy, to like going out with him, and I\r\nhave a vague sense of the red of the winter sunrise, and a recollection\r\nof the pleasant companionship, and a certain honour and glory in it. He\r\nused to delight me as a boy by telling me how, in still earlier walks,\r\non dark winter mornings, he had once or twice met foxes trotting home at\r\nthe dawning.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfasting alone about 7.45, he went to work at once,\r\nconsidering the 1 1/2 hour between 8 and 9.30 one of his best working\r\ntimes. At 9.30 he came into the drawing-room for his letters--rejoicing\r\nif the post was a light one and being sometimes much worried if it was\r\nnot. He would then hear any family letters read aloud as he lay on the\r\nsofa.\r\n\r\nThe reading aloud, which also included part of a novel, lasted till\r\nabout half-past ten, when he went back to work till twelve or a quarter\r\npast. By this time he considered his day's work over, and would often\r\nsay, in a satisfied voice, \"I'VE done a good day's work.\" He then went\r\nout of doors whether it was wet or fine; Polly, his white terrier,\r\nwent with him in fair weather, but in rain she refused or might be seen\r\nhesitating in the verandah, with a mixed expression of disgust and shame\r\nat her own want of courage; generally, however, her conscience carried\r\nthe day, and as soon as he was evidently gone she could not bear to stay\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nMy father was always fond of dogs, and as a young man had the power of\r\nstealing away the affections of his sister's pets; at Cambridge, he won\r\nthe love of his cousin W.D. Fox's dog, and this may perhaps have been\r\nthe little beast which used to creep down inside his bed and sleep at\r\nthe foot every night. My father had a surly dog, who was devoted to\r\nhim, but unfriendly to every one else, and when he came back from the\r\n\"Beagle\" voyage, the dog remembered him, but in a curious way, which my\r\nfather was fond of telling. He went into the yard and shouted in his old\r\nmanner; the dog rushed out and set off with him on his walk, showing no\r\nmore emotion or excitement than if the same thing had happened the day\r\nbefore, instead of five years ago. This story is made use of in the\r\n'Descent of Man,' 2nd Edition, page 74.\r\n\r\nIn my memory there were only two dogs which had much connection with my\r\nfather. One was a large black and white half-bred retriever, called Bob,\r\nto which we, as children, were much devoted. He was the dog of whom\r\nthe story of the \"hot-house face\" is told in the 'Expression of the\r\nEmotions.'\r\n\r\nBut the dog most closely associated with my father was the\r\nabove-mentioned Polly, a rough, white fox-terrier. She was a\r\nsharp-witted, affectionate dog; when her master was going away on a\r\njourney, she always discovered the fact by the signs of packing going on\r\nin the study, and became low-spirited accordingly. She began, too, to\r\nbe excited by seeing the study prepared for his return home. She was a\r\ncunning little creature, and used to tremble or put on an air of misery\r\nwhen my father passed, while she was waiting for dinner, just as if she\r\nknew that he would say (as he did often say) that \"she was famishing.\"\r\nMy father used to make her catch biscuits off her nose, and had an\r\naffectionate and mock-solemn way of explaining to her before-hand that\r\nshe must \"be a very good girl.\" She had a mark on her back where she had\r\nbeen burnt, and where the hair had re-grown red instead of white, and my\r\nfather used to commend her for this tuft of hair as being in accordance\r\nwith his theory of pangenesis; her father had been a red bull-terrier,\r\nthus the red hair appearing after the burn showed the presence of latent\r\nred gemmules. He was delightfully tender to Polly, and never showed any\r\nimpatience at the attentions she required, such as to be let in at the\r\ndoor, or out at the verandah window, to bark at \"naughty people,\"\r\na self-imposed duty she much enjoyed. She died, or rather had to be\r\nkilled, a few days after his death. (The basket in which she usually lay\r\ncurled up near the fire in his study is faithfully represented in Mr.\r\nParson's drawing, \"The Study at Down.\")\r\n\r\nMy father's midday walk generally began by a call at the greenhouse,\r\nwhere he looked at any germinating seeds or experimental plants which\r\nrequired a casual examination, but he hardly ever did any serious\r\nobserving at this time. Then he went on for his constitutional--either\r\nround the \"Sand-walk,\" or outside his own grounds in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the house. The \"Sand-walk\" was a narrow strip of land 1\r\n1/2 acres in extent, with a gravel-walk round it. On one side of it\r\nwas a broad old shaw with fair-sized oaks in it, which made a sheltered\r\nshady walk; the other side was separated from a neighbouring grass field\r\nby a low quickset hedge, over which you could look at what view there\r\nwas, a quiet little valley losing itself in the upland country towards\r\nthe edge of the Westerham hill, with hazel coppice and larch wood, the\r\nremnants of what was once a large wood, stretching away to the Westerham\r\nroad. I have heard my father say that the charm of this simple little\r\nvalley helped to make him settle at Down.\r\n\r\nThe Sand-walk was planted by my father with a variety of trees, such\r\nas hazel, alder, lime, hornbeam, birch, privet, and dogwood, and with a\r\nlong line of hollies all down the exposed side. In earlier times he took\r\na certain number of turns every day, and used to count them by means of\r\na heap of flints, one of which he kicked out on the path each time he\r\npassed. Of late years I think he did not keep to any fixed number of\r\nturns, but took as many as he felt strength for. The Sand-walk was our\r\nplay-ground as children, and here we continually saw my father as he\r\nwalked round. He liked to see what we were doing, and was ever ready\r\nto sympathize in any fun that was going on. It is curious to think how,\r\nwith regard to the Sand-walk in connection with my father, my earliest\r\nrecollections coincide with my latest; it shows how unvarying his habits\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\nSometimes when alone he stood still or walked stealthily to observe\r\nbirds or beasts. It was on one of these occasions that some young\r\nsquirrels ran up his back and legs, while their mother barked at them in\r\nan agony from the tree. He always found birds' nests even up to the last\r\nyears of his life, and we, as children, considered that he had a special\r\ngenius in this direction. In his quiet prowls he came across the less\r\ncommon birds, but I fancy he used to conceal it from me, as a little\r\nboy, because he observed the agony of mind which I endured at not having\r\nseen the siskin or goldfinch, or whatever it might have been. He used to\r\ntell us how, when he was creeping noiselessly along in the \"Big-Woods,\"\r\nhe came upon a fox asleep in the daytime, which was so much astonished\r\nthat it took a good stare at him before it ran off. A Spitz dog which\r\naccompanied him showed no sign of excitement at the fox, and he used to\r\nend the story by wondering how the dog could have been so faint-hearted.\r\n\r\nAnother favourite place was \"Orchis Bank,\" above the quiet Cudham\r\nvalley, where fly- and musk-orchis grew among the junipers, and\r\nCephalanthera and Neottia under the beech boughs; the little wood\r\n\"Hangrove,\" just above this, he was also fond of, and here I remember\r\nhis collecting grasses, when he took a fancy to make out the names of\r\nall the common kinds. He was fond of quoting the saying of one of his\r\nlittle boys, who, having found a grass that his father had not seen\r\nbefore, had it laid by his own plate during dinner, remarking, \"I are an\r\nextraordinary grass-finder!\"\r\n\r\nMy father much enjoyed wandering slowly in the garden with my mother or\r\nsome of his children, or making one of a party, sitting out on a bench\r\non the lawn; he generally sat, however, on the grass, and I remember him\r\noften lying under one of the big lime-trees, with his head on the green\r\nmound at its foot. In dry summer weather, when we often sat out, the\r\nbig fly-wheel of the well was commonly heard spinning round, and so the\r\nsound became associated with those pleasant days. He used to like to\r\nwatch us playing at lawn-tennis, and often knocked up a stray ball for\r\nus with the curved handle of his stick. === Though he took no personal\r\nshare in the management of the garden, he had great delight in the\r\nbeauty of flowers--for instance, in the mass of Azaleas which generally\r\nstood in the drawing-room. I think he sometimes fused together his\r\nadmiration of the structure of a flower and of its intrinsic beauty;\r\nfor instance, in the case of the big pendulous pink and white flowers\r\nof Dielytra. In the same way he had an affection, half-artistic,\r\nhalf-botanical, for the little blue Lobelia. In admiring flowers, he\r\nwould often laugh at the dingy high-art colours, and contrast them with\r\nthe bright tints of nature. I used to like to hear him admire the beauty\r\nof a flower; it was a kind of gratitude to the flower itself, and a\r\npersonal love for its delicate form and colour. I seem to remember\r\nhim gently touching a flower he delighted in; it was the same simple\r\nadmiration that a child might have.\r\n\r\nHe could not help personifying natural things. This feeling came out in\r\nabuse as well as in praise--e.g. of some seedlings--\"The little\r\nbeggars are doing just what I don't want them to.\" He would speak in a\r\nhalf-provoked, half-admiring way of the ingenuity of a Mimosa leaf in\r\nscrewing itself out of a basin of water in which he had tried to fix\r\nit. One must see the same spirit in his way of speaking of Sundew,\r\nearth-worms, etc. (Cf. Leslie Stephen's 'Swift,' 1882, page 200, where\r\nSwift's inspection of the manners and customs of servants are compared\r\nto my father's observations on worms, \"The difference is,\" says Mr.\r\nStephen, \"that Darwin had none but kindly feelings for worms.\")\r\n\r\nWithin my memory, his only outdoor recreation, besides walking, was\r\nriding, which he took to on the recommendation of Dr. Bence Jones, and\r\nwe had the luck to find for him the easiest and quietest cob in the\r\nworld, named \"Tommy.\" He enjoyed these rides extremely, and devised a\r\nnumber of short rounds which brought him home in time for lunch. Our\r\ncountry is good for this purpose, owing to the number of small valleys\r\nwhich give a variety to what in a flat country would be a dull loop of\r\nroad. He was not, I think, naturally fond of horses, nor had he a high\r\nopinion of their intelligence, and Tommy was often laughed at for\r\nthe alarm he showed at passing and repassing the same heap of\r\nhedge-clippings as he went round the field. I think he used to feel\r\nsurprised at himself, when he remembered how bold a rider he had been,\r\nand how utterly old age and bad health had taken away his nerve. He\r\nwould say that riding prevented him thinking much more effectually\r\nthan walking--that having to attend to the horse gave him occupation\r\nsufficient to prevent any really hard thinking. And the change of scene\r\nwhich it gave him was good for spirits and health.\r\n\r\nUnluckily, Tommy one day fell heavily with him on Keston common. This,\r\nand an accident with another horse, upset his nerves, and he was advised\r\nto give up riding.\r\n\r\nIf I go beyond my own experience, and recall what I have heard him say\r\nof his love for sport, etc., I can think of a good deal, but much of it\r\nwould be a repetition of what is contained in his 'Recollections.' At\r\nschool he was fond of bat-fives, and this was the only game at which he\r\nwas skilful. He was fond of his gun as quite a boy, and became a good\r\nshot; he used to tell how in South America he killed twenty-three snipe\r\nin twenty-four shots. In telling the story he was careful to add that he\r\nthought they were not quite so wild as English snipe.\r\n\r\nLuncheon at Down came after his midday walk; and here I may say a word\r\nor two about his meals generally. He had a boy-like love of sweets,\r\nunluckily for himself, since he was constantly forbidden to take them.\r\nHe was not particularly successful in keeping the \"vows,\" as he called\r\nthem, which he made against eating sweets, and never considered them\r\nbinding unless he made them aloud.\r\n\r\nHe drank very little wine, but enjoyed, and was revived by, the little\r\nhe did drink. He had a horror of drinking, and constantly warned his\r\nboys that any one might be led into drinking too much. I remember, in my\r\ninnocence as a small boy, asking him if he had been ever tipsy; and he\r\nanswered very gravely that he was ashamed to say he had once drunk too\r\nmuch at Cambridge. I was much impressed, so that I know now the place\r\nwhere the question was asked.\r\n\r\nAfter his lunch, he read the newspaper, lying on the sofa in the\r\ndrawing-room. I think the paper was the only non-scientific matter which\r\nhe read to himself. Everything else, novels, travels, history, was read\r\naloud to him. He took so wide an interest in life, that there was much\r\nto occupy him in newspapers, though he laughed at the wordiness of\r\nthe debates; reading them, I think, only in abstract. His interest in\r\npolitics was considerable, but his opinion on these matters was formed\r\nrather by the way than with any serious amount of thought.\r\n\r\nAfter he read his paper, came his time for writing letters. These, as\r\nwell as the MS. of his books, were written by him as he sat in a huge\r\nhorse-hair chair by the fire, his paper supported on a board resting\r\non the arms of the chair. When he had many or long letters to write, he\r\nwould dictate them from a rough copy; these rough copies were written on\r\nthe backs of manuscript or of proof-sheets, and were almost illegible,\r\nsometimes even to himself. He made a rule of keeping ALL letters that he\r\nreceived; this was a habit which he learnt from his father, and which he\r\nsaid had been of great use to him.\r\n\r\nHe received many letters from foolish, unscrupulous people, and all of\r\nthese received replies. He used to say that if he did not answer them,\r\nhe had it on his conscience afterwards, and no doubt it was in great\r\nmeasure the courtesy with which he answered every one, which produced\r\nthe universal and widespread sense of his kindness of nature, which was\r\nso evident on his death.\r\n\r\nHe was considerate to his correspondents in other and lesser things, for\r\ninstance when dictating a letter to a foreigner he hardly ever failed\r\nto say to me, \"You'd better try and write well, as it's to a foreigner.\"\r\nHis letters were generally written on the assumption that they would be\r\ncarelessly read; thus, when he was dictating, he was careful to tell me\r\nto make an important clause begin with an obvious paragraph \"to catch\r\nhis eye,\" as he often said. How much he thought of the trouble he gave\r\nothers by asking questions, will be well enough shown by his letters. It\r\nis difficult to say anything about the general tone of his letters,\r\nthey will speak for themselves. The unvarying courtesy of them is very\r\nstriking. I had a proof of this quality in the feeling with which Mr.\r\nHacon, his solicitor, regarded him. He had never seen my father, yet\r\nhad a sincere feeling of friendship for him, and spoke especially of\r\nhis letters as being such as a man seldom receives in the way of\r\nbusiness:--\"Everything I did was right, and everything was profusely\r\nthanked for.\"\r\n\r\nHe had a printed form to be used in replying to troublesome\r\ncorrespondents, but he hardly ever used it; I suppose he never found an\r\noccasion that seemed exactly suitable. I remember an occasion on which\r\nit might have been used with advantage. He received a letter from a\r\nstranger stating that the writer had undertaken to uphold Evolution at\r\na debating society, and that being a busy young man, without time for\r\nreading, he wished to have a sketch of my father's views. Even this\r\nwonderful young man got a civil answer, though I think he did not get\r\nmuch material for his speech. His rule was to thank the donors of books,\r\nbut not of pamphlets. He sometimes expressed surprise that so few people\r\nthanked him for his books which he gave away liberally; the letters that\r\nhe did receive gave him much pleasure, because he habitually formed so\r\nhumble an estimate of the value of all his works, that he was generally\r\nsurprised at the interest which they excited.\r\n\r\nIn money and business matters he was remarkably careful and exact. He\r\nkept accounts with great care, classifying them, and balancing at the\r\nend of the year like a merchant. I remember the quick way in which\r\nhe would reach out for his account-book to enter each cheque paid, as\r\nthough he were in a hurry to get it entered before he had forgotten it.\r\nHis father must have allowed him to believe that he would be poorer than\r\nhe really was, for some of the difficulty experienced in finding a house\r\nin the country must have arisen from the modest sum he felt prepared to\r\ngive. Yet he knew, of course, that he would be in easy circumstances,\r\nfor in his 'Recollections' he mentions this as one of the reasons for\r\nhis not having worked at medicine with so much zeal as he would have\r\ndone if he had been obliged to gain his living.\r\n\r\nHe had a pet economy in paper, but it was rather a hobby than a real\r\neconomy. All the blank sheets of letters received were kept in a\r\nportfolio to be used in making notes; it was his respect for paper that\r\nmade him write so much on the backs of his old MS., and in this way,\r\nunfortunately, he destroyed large parts of the original MS. of his\r\nbooks. His feeling about paper extended to waste paper, and he objected,\r\nhalf in fun, to the careless custom of throwing a spill into the fire\r\nafter it had been used for lighting a candle.\r\n\r\nMy father was wonderfully liberal and generous to all his children in\r\nthe matter of money, and I have special cause to remember his kindness\r\nwhen I think of the way in which he paid some Cambridge debts of\r\nmine--making it almost seem a virtue in me to have told him of them.\r\nIn his later years he had the kind and generous plan of dividing his\r\nsurplus at the year's end among his children.\r\n\r\nHe had a great respect for pure business capacity, and often spoke with\r\nadmiration of a relative who had doubled his fortune. And of himself\r\nwould often say in fun that what he really WAS proud of was the money he\r\nhad saved. He also felt satisfaction in the money he made by his books.\r\nHis anxiety to save came in a great measure from his fears that his\r\nchildren would not have health enough to earn their own livings, a\r\nforeboding which fairly haunted him for many years. And I have a dim\r\nrecollection of his saying, \"Thank God, you'll have bread and cheese,\"\r\nwhen I was so young that I was rather inclined to take it literally.\r\n\r\nWhen letters were finished, about three in the afternoon, he rested in\r\nhis bedroom, lying on the sofa and smoking a cigarette, and listening\r\nto a novel or other book not scientific. He only smoked when resting,\r\nwhereas snuff was a stimulant, and was taken during working hours.\r\nHe took snuff for many years of his life, having learnt the habit at\r\nEdinburgh as a student. He had a nice silver snuff-box given him by\r\nMrs. Wedgwood of Maer, which he valued much--but he rarely carried it,\r\nbecause it tempted him to take too many pinches. In one of his early\r\nletters he speaks of having given up snuff for a month, and describes\r\nhimself as feeling \"most lethargic, stupid, and melancholy.\" Our former\r\nneighbour and clergyman, Mr. Brodie Innes, tells me that at one time my\r\nfather made a resolve not to take snuff except away from home, \"a most\r\nsatisfactory arrangement for me,\" he adds, \"as I kept a box in my study\r\nto which there was access from the garden without summoning servants,\r\nand I had more frequently, than might have been otherwise the case,\r\nthe privilege of a few minutes' conversation with my dear friend.\" He\r\ngenerally took snuff from a jar on the hall table, because having to go\r\nthis distance for a pinch was a slight check; the clink of the lid of\r\nthe snuff jar was a very familiar sound. Sometimes when he was in the\r\ndrawing-room, it would occur to him that the study fire must be burning\r\nlow, and when some of us offered to see after it, it would turn out that\r\nhe also wished to get a pinch of snuff.\r\n\r\nSmoking he only took to permanently of late years, though on his Pampas\r\nrides he learned to smoke with the Gauchos, and I have heard him speak\r\nof the great comfort of a cup of mate and a cigarette when he halted\r\nafter a long ride and was unable to get food for some time.\r\n\r\nThe reading aloud often sent him to sleep, and he used to regret losing\r\nparts of a novel, for my mother went steadily on lest the cessation of\r\nthe sound might wake him. He came down at four o'clock to dress for\r\nhis walk, and he was so regular that one might be quite certain it was\r\nwithin a few minutes of four when his descending steps were heard.\r\n\r\nFrom about half-past four to half-past five he worked; then he came to\r\nthe drawing-room, and was idle till it was time (about six) to go up for\r\nanother rest with novel-reading and a cigarette.\r\n\r\nLatterly he gave up late dinner, and had a simple tea at half-past\r\nseven (while we had dinner), with an egg or a small piece of meat. After\r\ndinner he never stayed in the room, and used to apologise by saying he\r\nwas an old woman, who must be allowed to leave with the ladies. This\r\nwas one of the many signs and results of his constant weakness and\r\nill-health. Half an hour more or less conversation would make to him\r\nthe difference of a sleepless night, and of the loss perhaps of half the\r\nnext day's work.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner he played backgammon with my mother, two games being played\r\nevery night; for many years a score of the games which each won was\r\nkept, and in this score he took the greatest interest. He became\r\nextremely animated over these games, bitterly lamenting his bad luck and\r\nexploding with exaggerated mock-anger at my mother's good fortune.\r\n\r\nAfter backgammon he read some scientific book to himself, either in the\r\ndrawing-room, or, if much talking was going on, in the study.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, that is, after he had read as much as his strength would\r\nallow, and before the reading aloud began, he would often lie on the\r\nsofa and listen to my mother playing the piano. He had not a good ear,\r\nyet in spite of this he had a true love of fine music. He used to lament\r\nthat his enjoyment of music had become dulled with age, yet within my\r\nrecollection, his love of a good tune was strong. I never heard him hum\r\nmore than one tune, the Welsh song \"Ar hyd y nos,\" which he went through\r\ncorrectly; he used also, I believe, to hum a little Otaheitan song.\r\nFrom his want of ear he was unable to recognize a tune when he heard it\r\nagain, but he remained constant to what he liked, and would often say,\r\nwhen an old favourite was played, \"That's a fine thing; what is it?\" He\r\nliked especially parts of Beethoven's symphonies, and bits of Handel.\r\nHe made a little list of all the pieces which he especially liked among\r\nthose which my mother played--giving in a few words the impression that\r\neach one made on him--but these notes are unfortunately lost. He was\r\nsensitive to differences in style, and enjoyed the late Mrs. Vernon\r\nLushington's playing intensely, and in June 1881, when Hans Richter paid\r\na visit at Down, he was roused to strong enthusiasm by his magnificent\r\nperformance on the piano. He much enjoyed good singing, and was moved\r\nalmost to tears by grand or pathetic songs. His niece Lady Farrer's\r\nsinging of Sullivan's \"Will he come\" was a never-failing enjoyment\r\nto him. He was humble in the extreme about his own taste, and\r\ncorrespondingly pleased when he found that others agreed with him.\r\n\r\nHe became much tired in the evenings, especially of late years, when\r\nhe left the drawing-room about ten, going to bed at half-past ten. His\r\nnights were generally bad, and he often lay awake or sat up in bed\r\nfor hours, suffering much discomfort. He was troubled at night by the\r\nactivity of his thoughts, and would become exhausted by his mind working\r\nat some problem which he would willingly have dismissed. At night, too,\r\nanything which had vexed or troubled him in the day would haunt him,\r\nand I think it was then that he suffered if he had not answered some\r\ntroublesome person's letter.\r\n\r\nThe regular readings, which I have mentioned, continued for so many\r\nyears, enabled him to get through a great deal of lighter kinds of\r\nliterature. He was extremely fond of novels, and I remember well the way\r\nin which he would anticipate the pleasure of having a novel read to him,\r\nas he lay down, or lighted his cigarette. He took a vivid interest both\r\nin plot and characters, and would on no account know beforehand, how\r\na story finished; he considered looking at the end of a novel as a\r\nfeminine vice. He could not enjoy any story with a tragical end, for\r\nthis reason he did not keenly appreciate George Eliot, though he often\r\nspoke warmly in praise of 'Silas Marner.' Walter Scott, Miss Austen, and\r\nMrs. Gaskell, were read and re-read till they could be read no more. He\r\nhad two or three books in hand at the same time--a novel and perhaps a\r\nbiography and a book of travels. He did not often read out-of-the-way or\r\nold standard books, but generally kept to the books of the day obtained\r\nfrom a circulating library.\r\n\r\nI do not think that his literary tastes and opinions were on a level\r\nwith the rest of his mind. He himself, though he was clear as to what he\r\nthought good, considered that in matters of literary taste, he was\r\nquite outside the pale, and often spoke of what those within it liked or\r\ndisliked, as if they formed a class to which he had no claim to belong.\r\n\r\nIn all matters of art he was inclined to laugh at professed critics,\r\nand say that their opinions were formed by fashion. Thus in painting,\r\nhe would say how in his day every one admired masters who are now\r\nneglected. His love of pictures as a young man is almost a proof that he\r\nmust have had an appreciation of a portrait as a work of art, not as\r\na likeness. Yet he often talked laughingly of the small worth of\r\nportraits, and said that a photograph was worth any number of pictures,\r\nas if he were blind to the artistic quality in a painted portrait. But\r\nthis was generally said in his attempts to persuade us to give up the\r\nidea of having his portrait painted, an operation very irksome to him.\r\n\r\nThis way of looking at himself as an ignoramus in all matters of art,\r\nwas strengthened by the absence of pretence, which was part of his\r\ncharacter. With regard to questions of taste, as well as to more serious\r\nthings, he always had the courage of his opinions. I remember, however,\r\nan instance that sounds like a contradiction to this: when he was\r\nlooking at the Turners in Mr. Ruskin's bedroom, he did not confess, as\r\nhe did afterwards, that he could make out absolutely nothing of what Mr.\r\nRuskin saw in them. But this little pretence was not for his own sake,\r\nbut for the sake of courtesy to his host. He was pleased and amused\r\nwhen subsequently Mr. Ruskin brought him some photographs of pictures\r\n(I think Vandyke portraits), and courteously seemed to value my father's\r\nopinion about them.\r\n\r\nMuch of his scientific reading was in German, and this was a great\r\nlabour to him; in reading a book after him, I was often struck at\r\nseeing, from the pencil-marks made each day where he left off, how\r\nlittle he could read at a time. He used to call German the \"Verdammte,\"\r\npronounced as if in English. He was especially indignant with Germans,\r\nbecause he was convinced that they could write simply if they chose, and\r\noften praised Dr. F. Hildebrand for writing German which was as clear\r\nas French. He sometimes gave a German sentence to a friend, a patriotic\r\nGerman lady, and used to laugh at her if she did not translate it\r\nfluently. He himself learnt German simply by hammering away with a\r\ndictionary; he would say that his only way was to read a sentence a\r\ngreat many times over, and at last the meaning occurred to him. When he\r\nbegan German long ago, he boasted of the fact (as he used to tell) to\r\nSir J. Hooker, who replied, \"Ah, my dear fellow, that's nothing; I've\r\nbegun it many times.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of his want of grammar, he managed to get on wonderfully with\r\nGerman, and the sentences that he failed to make out were generally\r\nreally difficult ones. He never attempted to speak German correctly, but\r\npronounced the words as though they were English; and this made it not\r\na little difficult to help him, when he read out a German sentence and\r\nasked for a translation. He certainly had a bad ear for vocal sounds,\r\nso that he found it impossible to perceive small differences in\r\npronunciation.\r\n\r\nHis wide interest in branches of science that were not specially his own\r\nwas remarkable. In the biological sciences his doctrines make themselves\r\nfelt so widely that there was something interesting to him in most\r\ndepartments of it. He read a good deal of many quite special works, and\r\nlarge parts of text books, such as Huxley's 'Invertebrate Anatomy,' or\r\nsuch a book as Balfour's 'Embryology,' where the detail, at any rate,\r\nwas not specially in his own line. And in the case of elaborate books of\r\nthe monograph type, though he did not make a study of them, yet he felt\r\nthe strongest admiration for them.\r\n\r\nIn the non-biological sciences he felt keen sympathy with work of which\r\nhe could not really judge. For instance, he used to read nearly the\r\nwhole of 'Nature,' though so much of it deals with mathematics and\r\nphysics. I have often heard him say that he got a kind of satisfaction\r\nin reading articles which (according to himself) he could not\r\nunderstand. I wish I could reproduce the manner in which he would laugh\r\nat himself for it.\r\n\r\nIt was remarkable, too, how he kept up his interest in subjects at which\r\nhe had formerly worked. This was strikingly the case with geology. In\r\none of his letters to Mr. Judd he begs him to pay him a visit, saying\r\nthat since Lyell's death he hardly ever gets a geological talk. His\r\nobservations, made only a few years before his death, on the upright\r\npebbles in the drift at Southampton, and discussed in a letter to Mr.\r\nGeikie, afford another instance. Again, in the letters to Dr. Dohrn, he\r\nshows how his interest in barnacles remained alive. I think it was all\r\ndue to the vitality and persistence of his mind--a quality I have heard\r\nhim speak of as if he felt that he was strongly gifted in that respect.\r\nNot that he used any such phrases as these about himself, but he would\r\nsay that he had the power of keeping a subject or question more or less\r\nbefore him for a great many years. The extent to which he possessed this\r\npower appears when we consider the number of different problems which he\r\nsolved, and the early period at which some of them began to occupy him.\r\n\r\nIt was a sure sign that he was not well when he was idle at any times\r\nother than his regular resting hours; for, as long as he remained\r\nmoderately well, there was no break in the regularity of his life.\r\nWeek-days and Sundays passed by alike, each with their stated intervals\r\nof work and rest. It is almost impossible, except for those who watched\r\nhis daily life, to realise how essential to his well-being was the\r\nregular routine that I have sketched: and with what pain and difficulty\r\nanything beyond it was attempted. Any public appearance, even of the\r\nmost modest kind, was an effort to him. In 1871 he went to the little\r\nvillage church for the wedding of his elder daughter, but he could\r\nhardly bear the fatigue of being present through the short service. The\r\nsame may be said of the few other occasions on which he was present at\r\nsimilar ceremonies.\r\n\r\nI remember him many years ago at a christening; a memory which has\r\nremained with me, because to us children it seemed an extraordinary and\r\nabnormal occurrence. I remember his look most distinctly at his brother\r\nErasmus's funeral, as he stood in the scattering of snow, wrapped in a\r\nlong black funeral cloak, with a grave look of sad reverie.\r\n\r\nWhen, after an interval of many years, he again attended a meeting\r\nof the Linnean Society, it was felt to be, and was in fact, a serious\r\nundertaking; one not to be determined on without much sinking of\r\nheart, and hardly to be carried into effect without paying a penalty\r\nof subsequent suffering. In the same way a breakfast-party at Sir James\r\nPaget's, with some of the distinguished visitors to the Medical Congress\r\n(1881), was to him a severe exertion.\r\n\r\nThe early morning was the only time at which he could make any effort of\r\nthe kind, with comparative impunity. Thus it came about that the visits\r\nhe paid to his scientific friends in London were by preference made\r\nas early as ten in the morning. For the same reason he started on his\r\njourneys by the earliest possible train, and used to arrive at the\r\nhouses of relatives in London when they were beginning their day.\r\n\r\nHe kept an accurate journal of the days on which he worked and those\r\non which his ill health prevented him from working, so that it would\r\nbe possible to tell how many were idle days in any given year. In\r\nthis journal--a little yellow Lett's Diary, which lay open on his\r\nmantel-piece, piled on the diaries of previous years--he also entered\r\nthe day on which he started for a holiday and that of his return.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent holidays were visits of a week to London, either\r\nto his brother's house (6 Queen Anne Street), or to his daughter's (4\r\nBryanston Street). He was generally persuaded by my mother to take these\r\nshort holidays, when it became clear from the frequency of \"bad days,\"\r\nor from the swimming of his head, that he was being overworked. He\r\nwent unwillingly, and tried to drive hard bargains, stipulating, for\r\ninstance, that he should come home in five days instead of six. Even\r\nif he were leaving home for no more than a week, the packing had to be\r\nbegun early on the previous day, and the chief part of it he would do\r\nhimself. The discomfort of a journey to him was, at least latterly,\r\nchiefly in the anticipation, and in the miserable sinking feeling from\r\nwhich he suffered immediately before the start; even a fairly long\r\njourney, such as that to Coniston, tired him wonderfully little,\r\nconsidering how much an invalid he was; and he certainly enjoyed it in\r\nan almost boyish way, and to a curious extent.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as he has said, some of his aesthetic tastes had suffered a\r\ngradual decay, his love of scenery remained fresh and strong. Every walk\r\nat Coniston was a fresh delight, and he was never tired of praising the\r\nbeauty of the broken hilly country at the head of the lake.\r\n\r\nOne of the happy memories of this time [1879] is that of a delightful\r\nvisit to Grasmere: \"The perfect day,\" my sister writes, \"and my father's\r\nvivid enjoyment and flow of spirits, form a picture in my mind that I\r\nlike to think of. He could hardly sit still in the carriage for turning\r\nround and getting up to admire the view from each fresh point, and even\r\nin returning he was full of the beauty of Rydal Water, though he would\r\nnot allow that Grasmere at all equalled his beloved Coniston.\"\r\n\r\nBesides these longer holidays, there were shorter visits to various\r\nrelatives--to his brother-in-law's house, close to Leith Hill, and to\r\nhis son near Southampton. He always particularly enjoyed rambling over\r\nrough open country, such as the commons near Leith Hill and Southampton,\r\nthe heath-covered wastes of Ashdown Forest, or the delightful \"Rough\"\r\nnear the house of his friend Sir Thomas Farrer. He never was quite idle\r\neven on these holidays, and found things to observe. At Hartfield he\r\nwatched Drosera catching insects, etc.; at Torquay he observed the\r\nfertilisation of an orchid (Spiranthes), and also made out the relations\r\nof the sexes in Thyme.\r\n\r\nHe was always rejoiced to get home after his holidays; he used greatly\r\nto enjoy the welcome he got from his dog Polly, who would get wild with\r\nexcitement, panting, squeaking, rushing round the room, and jumping on\r\nand off the chairs; and he used to stoop down, pressing her face to\r\nhis, letting her lick him, and speaking to her with a peculiarly tender,\r\ncaressing voice.\r\n\r\nMy father had the power of giving to these summer holidays a charm which\r\nwas strongly felt by all his family. The pressure of his work at home\r\nkept him at the utmost stretch of his powers of endurance, and when\r\nreleased from it, he entered on a holiday with a youthfulness of\r\nenjoyment that made his companionship delightful; we felt that we saw\r\nmore of him in a week's holiday than in a month at home.\r\n\r\nSome of these absences from home, however, had a depressing effect on\r\nhim; when he had been previously much overworked it seemed as though\r\nthe absence of the customary strain allowed him to fall into a peculiar\r\ncondition of miserable health.\r\n\r\nBesides the holidays which I have mentioned, there were his visits\r\nto water-cure establishments. In 1849, when very ill, suffering from\r\nconstant sickness, he was urged by a friend to try the water-cure,\r\nand at last agreed to go to Dr. Gully's establishment at Malvern. His\r\nletters to Mr. Fox show how much good the treatment did him; he seems\r\nto have thought that he had found a cure for his troubles, but, like all\r\nother remedies, it had only a transient effect on him. However, he found\r\nit, at first, so good for him that when he came home he built himself a\r\ndouche-bath, and the butler learnt to be his bathman.\r\n\r\nHe paid many visits to Moor Park, Dr. Lane's water-cure establishment in\r\nSurrey, not far from Aldershot. These visits were pleasant ones, and\r\nhe always looked back to them with pleasure. Dr. Lane has given his\r\nrecollections of my father in Dr. Richardson's 'Lecture on Charles\r\nDarwin,' October 22, 1882, from which I quote:--\r\n\r\n\"In a public institution like mine, he was surrounded, of course, by\r\nmultifarious types of character, by persons of both sexes, mostly very\r\ndifferent from himself--commonplace people, in short, as the majority\r\nare everywhere, but like to him at least in this, that they were\r\nfellow-creatures and fellow-patients. And never was any one more genial,\r\nmore considerate, more friendly, more altogether charming than he\r\nuniversally was.\"...He \"never aimed, as too often happens with good\r\ntalkers, at monopolising the conversation. It was his pleasure rather\r\nto give and take, and he was as good a listener as a speaker. He never\r\npreached nor prosed, but his talk, whether grave or gay (and it was each\r\nby turns), was full of life and salt--racy, bright, and animated.\"\r\n\r\nSome idea of his relation to his family and his friends may be gathered\r\nfrom what has gone before; it would be impossible to attempt a complete\r\naccount of these relationships, but a slightly fuller outline may not be\r\nout of place. Of his married life I cannot speak, save in the\r\nbriefest manner. In his relationship towards my mother, his tender\r\nand sympathetic nature was shown in its most beautiful aspect. In her\r\npresence he found his happiness, and through her, his life,--which\r\nmight have been overshadowed by gloom,--became one of content and quiet\r\ngladness.\r\n\r\nThe 'Expression of the Emotions' shows how closely he watched his\r\nchildren; it was characteristic of him that (as I have heard him tell),\r\nalthough he was so anxious to observe accurately the expression of a\r\ncrying child, his sympathy with the grief spoiled his observation. His\r\nnote-book, in which are recorded sayings of his young children, shows\r\nhis pleasure in them. He seemed to retain a sort of regretful memory\r\nof the childhoods which had faded away, and thus he wrote in his\r\n'Recollections':--\"When you were very young it was my delight to play\r\nwith you all, and I think with a sigh that such days can never return.\"\r\n\r\nI may quote, as showing the tenderness of his nature, some sentences\r\nfrom an account of his little daughter Annie, written a few days after\r\nher death:--\r\n\r\n\"Our poor child, Annie, was born in Gower Street, on March 2, 1841, and\r\nexpired at Malvern at mid-day on the 23rd of April, 1851.\r\n\r\n\"I write these few pages, as I think in after years, if we live,\r\nthe impressions now put down will recall more vividly her chief\r\ncharacteristics. From whatever point I look back at her, the main\r\nfeature in her disposition which at once rises before me, is her\r\nbuoyant joyousness, tempered by two other characteristics, namely, her\r\nsensitiveness, which might easily have been overlooked by a stranger,\r\nand her strong affection. Her joyousness and animal spirits radiated\r\nfrom her whole countenance, and rendered every movement elastic and full\r\nof life and vigour. It was delightful and cheerful to behold her. Her\r\ndear face now rises before me, as she used sometimes to come running\r\ndownstairs with a stolen pinch of snuff for me her whole form radiant\r\nwith the pleasure of giving pleasure. Even when playing with her\r\ncousins, when her joyousness almost passed into boisterousness, a single\r\nglance of my eye, not of displeasure (for I thank God I hardly ever cast\r\none on her), but of want of sympathy, would for some minutes alter her\r\nwhole countenance.\r\n\r\n\"The other point in her character, which made her joyousness and spirits\r\nso delightful, was her strong affection, which was of a most clinging,\r\nfondling nature. When quite a baby, this showed itself in never being\r\neasy without touching her mother, when in bed with her; and quite\r\nlately she would, when poorly, fondle for any length of time one of her\r\nmother's arms. When very unwell, her mother lying down beside her seemed\r\nto soothe her in a manner quite different from what it would have done\r\nto any of our other children. So, again, she would at almost any time\r\nspend half an hour in arranging my hair, 'making it,' as she called\r\nit, 'beautiful,' or in smoothing, the poor dear darling, my collar or\r\ncuffs--in short, in fondling me.\r\n\r\n\"Beside her joyousness thus tempered, she was in her manners remarkably\r\ncordial, frank, open, straightforward, natural, and without any shade of\r\nreserve. Her whole mind was pure and transparent. One felt one knew her\r\nthoroughly and could trust her. I always thought, that come what might,\r\nwe should have had in our old age at least one loving soul which nothing\r\ncould have changed. All her movements were vigorous, active, and usually\r\ngraceful. When going round the Sand-walk with me, although I walked\r\nfast, yet she often used to go before, pirouetting in the most elegant\r\nway, her dear face bright all the time with the sweetest smiles.\r\nOccasionally she had a pretty coquettish manner towards me, the memory\r\nof which is charming. She often used exaggerated language, and when I\r\nquizzed her by exaggerating what she had said, how clearly can I now see\r\nthe little toss of the head, and exclamation of 'Oh, papa what a shame\r\nof you!' In the last short illness her conduct in simple truth was\r\nangelic. She never once complained; never became fretful; was ever\r\nconsiderate of others, and was thankful in the most gentle, pathetic\r\nmanner for everything done for her. When so exhausted that she could\r\nhardly speak, she praised everything that was given her, and said some\r\ntea 'was beautifully good.' When I gave her some water she said, 'I\r\nquite thank you;' and these, I believe, were the last precious words\r\never addressed by her dear lips to me.\r\n\r\n\"We have lost the joy of the household, and the solace of our old age.\r\nShe must have known how we loved her. Oh, that she could now know how\r\ndeeply, how tenderly, we do still and shall ever love her dear joyous\r\nface! Blessings on her!\r\n\r\n\"April 30, 1851.\"\r\n\r\nWe his children all took especial pleasure in the games he played at\r\nwith us, but I do not think he romped much with us; I suppose his health\r\nprevented any rough play. He used sometimes to tell us stories, which\r\nwere considered especially delightful, partly on account of their\r\nrarity.\r\n\r\nThe way he brought us up is shown by a little story about my brother\r\nLeonard, which my father was fond of telling. He came into the\r\ndrawing-room and found Leonard dancing about on the sofa, which was\r\nforbidden, for the sake of the springs, and said, \"Oh, Lenny, Lenny,\r\nthat's against all rules,\" and received for answer, \"Then I think you'd\r\nbetter go out of the room.\" I do not believe he ever spoke an angry\r\nword to any of his children in his life; but I am certain that it never\r\nentered our heads to disobey him. I well remember one occasion when my\r\nfather reproved me for a piece of carelessness; and I can still recall\r\nthe feeling of depression which came over me, and the care which he took\r\nto disperse it by speaking to me soon afterwards with especial kindness.\r\nHe kept up his delightful, affectionate manner towards us all his life.\r\nI sometimes wonder that he could do so, with such an undemonstrative\r\nrace as we are; but I hope he knew how much we delighted in his loving\r\nwords and manner. How often, when a man, I have wished when my father\r\nwas behind my chair, that he would pass his hand over my hair, as he\r\nused to do when I was a boy. He allowed his grown-up children to laugh\r\nwith and at him, and was, generally speaking, on terms of perfect\r\nequality with us.\r\n\r\nHe was always full of interest about each one's plans or successes. We\r\nused to laugh at him, and say he would not believe in his sons, because,\r\nfor instance, he would be a little doubtful about their taking some bit\r\nof work for which he did not feel sure that they had knowledge enough.\r\nOn the other hand, he was only too much inclined to take a favourable\r\nview of our work. When I thought he had set too high a value on anything\r\nthat I had done, he used to be indignant and inclined to explode in mock\r\nanger. His doubts were part of his humility concerning what was in any\r\nway connected with himself; his too favourable view of our work was due\r\nto his sympathetic nature, which made him lenient to every one.\r\n\r\nHe kept up towards his children his delightful manner of expressing his\r\nthanks; and I never wrote a letter, or read a page aloud to him, without\r\nreceiving a few kind words of recognition. His love and goodness towards\r\nhis little grandson Bernard were great; and he often spoke of the\r\npleasure it was to him to see \"his little face opposite to him\" at\r\nluncheon. He and Bernard used to compare their tastes; e.g., in liking\r\nbrown sugar better than white, etc.; the result being, \"We always agree,\r\ndon't we?\"\r\n\r\nMy sister writes:--\r\n\r\n\"My first remembrances of my father are of the delights of his playing\r\nwith us. He was passionately attached to his own children, although\r\nhe was not an indiscriminate child-lover. To all of us he was the most\r\ndelightful play-fellow, and the most perfect sympathiser. Indeed it is\r\nimpossible adequately to describe how delightful a relation his was to\r\nhis family, whether as children or in their later life.\r\n\r\n\"It is a proof of the terms on which we were, and also of how much he\r\nwas valued as a play-fellow, that one of his sons when about four years\r\nold tried to bribe him with sixpence to come and play in working hours.\r\nWe all knew the sacredness of working-time, but that any one should\r\nresist sixpence seemed an impossibility.\r\n\r\n\"He must have been the most patient and delightful of nurses. I remember\r\nthe haven of peace and comfort it seemed to me when I was unwell, to\r\nbe tucked up on the study sofa, idly considering the old geological map\r\nhung on the wall. This must have been in his working hours, for I always\r\npicture him sitting in the horsehair arm-chair by the corner of the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\"Another mark of his unbounded patience was the way in which we were\r\nsuffered to make raids into the study when we had an absolute need of\r\nsticking-plaster, string, pins, scissors, stamps, foot-rule, or hammer.\r\nThese and other such necessaries were always to be found in the study,\r\nand it was the only place where this was a certainty. We used to feel it\r\nwrong to go in during work-time; still, when the necessity was great we\r\ndid so. I remember his patient look when he said once, 'Don't you think\r\nyou could not come in again, I have been interrupted very often.' We\r\nused to dread going in for sticking-plaster, because he disliked to\r\nsee that we had cut ourselves, both for our sakes and on account of his\r\nacute sensitiveness to the sight of blood. I well remember lurking about\r\nthe passage till he was safe away, and then stealing in for the plaster.\r\n\r\n\"Life seems to me, as I look back upon it, to have been very regular in\r\nthose early days, and except relations (and a few intimate friends), I\r\ndo not think any one came to the house. After lessons, we were always\r\nfree to go where we would, and that was chiefly in the drawing-room\r\nand about the garden, so that we were very much with both my father and\r\nmother. We used to think it most delightful when he told us any stories\r\nabout the 'Beagle', or about early Shrewsbury days--little bits about\r\nschool-life and his boyish tastes. Sometimes too he read aloud to his\r\nchildren such books as Scott's novels, and I remember a few little\r\nlectures on the steam-engine.\r\n\r\n\"I was more or less ill during the five years between my thirteenth and\r\neighteenth years, and for a long time (years it seems to me) he used to\r\nplay a couple of games of backgammon with me every afternoon. He played\r\nthem with the greatest spirit, and I remember we used at one time to\r\nkeep account of the games, and as this record came out in favour of him,\r\nwe kept a list of the doublets thrown by each, as I was convinced that\r\nhe threw better than myself.\r\n\r\n\"His patience and sympathy were boundless during this weary illness, and\r\nsometimes when most miserable I felt his sympathy to be almost too keen.\r\nWhen at my worst, we went to my aunt's house at Hartfield, in Sussex,\r\nand as soon as we had made the move safely he went on to Moor Park for\r\na fortnight's water-cure. I can recall now how on his return I could\r\nhardly bear to have him in the room, the expression of tender sympathy\r\nand emotion in his face was too agitating, coming fresh upon me after\r\nhis little absence.\r\n\r\n\"He cared for all our pursuits and interests, and lived our lives with\r\nus in a way that very few fathers do. But I am certain that none of\r\nus felt that this intimacy interfered the least with our respect or\r\nobedience. Whatever he said was absolute truth and law to us. He always\r\nput his whole mind into answering any of our questions. One trifling\r\ninstance makes me feel how he cared for what we cared for. He had no\r\nspecial taste for cats, though he admired the pretty ways of a kitten.\r\nBut yet he knew and remembered the individualities of my many cats, and\r\nwould talk about the habits and characters of the more remarkable ones\r\nyears after they had died.\r\n\r\n\"Another characteristic of his treatment of his children was his respect\r\nfor their liberty, and for their personality. Even as quite a girl, I\r\nremember rejoicing in this sense of freedom. Our father and mother would\r\nnot even wish to know what we were doing or thinking unless we wished\r\nto tell. He always made us feel that we were each of us creatures whose\r\nopinions and thoughts were valuable to him, so that whatever there was\r\nbest in us came out in the sunshine of his presence.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think his exaggerated sense of our good qualities,\r\nintellectual or moral, made us conceited, as might perhaps have been\r\nexpected, but rather more humble and grateful to him. The reason being\r\nno doubt that the influence of his character, of his sincerity and\r\ngreatness of nature, had a much deeper and more lasting effect than any\r\nsmall exaltation which his praises or admiration may have caused to our\r\nvanity.\"\r\n\r\nAs head of a household he was much loved and respected; he always spoke\r\nto servants with politeness, using the expression, \"would you be\r\nso good,\" in asking for anything. He was hardly ever angry with his\r\nservants; it shows how seldom this occurred, that when, as a small boy,\r\nI overheard a servant being scolded, and my father speaking angrily,\r\nit impressed me as an appalling circumstance, and I remember running up\r\nstairs out of a general sense of awe. He did not trouble himself about\r\nthe management of the garden, cows, etc. He considered the horses so\r\nlittle his concern, that he used to ask doubtfully whether he might\r\nhave a horse and cart to send to Keston for Drosera, or to the Westerham\r\nnurseries for plants, or the like.\r\n\r\nAs a host my father had a peculiar charm: the presence of visitors\r\nexcited him, and made him appear to his best advantage. At Shrewsbury,\r\nhe used to say, it was his father's wish that the guests should be\r\nattended to constantly, and in one of the letters to Fox he speaks\r\nof the impossibility of writing a letter while the house was full\r\nof company. I think he always felt uneasy at not doing more for the\r\nentertainment of his guests, but the result was successful; and, to make\r\nup for any loss, there was the gain that the guests felt perfectly free\r\nto do as they liked. The most usual visitors were those who stayed\r\nfrom Saturday till Monday; those who remained longer were generally\r\nrelatives, and were considered to be rather more my mother's affair than\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nBesides these visitors, there were foreigners and other strangers,\r\nwho came down for luncheon and went away in the afternoon. He used\r\nconscientiously to represent to them the enormous distance of Down from\r\nLondon, and the labour it would be to come there, unconsciously taking\r\nfor granted that they would find the journey as toilsome as he did\r\nhimself. If, however, they were not deterred, he used to arrange their\r\njourneys for them, telling them when to come, and practically when to\r\ngo. It was pleasant to see the way in which he shook hands with a guest\r\nwho was being welcomed for the first time; his hand used to shoot out\r\nin a way that gave one the feeling that it was hastening to meet the\r\nguest's hands. With old friends his hand came down with a hearty swing\r\ninto the other hand in a way I always had satisfaction in seeing. His\r\ngood-bye was chiefly characterised by the pleasant way in which he\r\nthanked his guests, as he stood at the door, for having come to see him.\r\n\r\nThese luncheons were very successful entertainments, there was no drag\r\nor flagging about them, my father was bright and excited throughout the\r\nwhole visit. Professor De Candolle has described a visit to Down, in\r\nhis admirable and sympathetic sketch of my father. ('Darwin considere au\r\npoint de vue des causes de son succes.'--Geneva, 1882.) He speaks of\r\nhis manner as resembling that of a \"savant\" of Oxford or Cambridge.\r\nThis does not strike me as quite a good comparison; in his ease and\r\nnaturalness there was more of the manner of some soldiers; a manner\r\narising from total absence of pretence or affectation. It was this\r\nabsence of pose, and the natural and simple way in which he began\r\ntalking to his guests, so as to get them on their own lines, which made\r\nhim so charming a host to a stranger. His happy choice of matter for\r\ntalk seemed to flow out of his sympathetic nature, and humble, vivid\r\ninterest in other people's work.\r\n\r\nTo some, I think, he caused actual pain by his modesty; I have seen the\r\nlate Francis Balfour quite discomposed by having knowledge ascribed to\r\nhimself on a point about which my father claimed to be utterly ignorant.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to seize on the characteristics of my father's\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nHe had more dread than have most people of repeating his stories, and\r\ncontinually said, \"You must have heard me tell,\" or \"I dare say I've\r\ntold you.\" One peculiarity he had, which gave a curious effect to his\r\nconversation. The first few words of a sentence would often remind him\r\nof some exception to, or some reason against, what he was going to say;\r\nand this again brought up some other point, so that the sentence would\r\nbecome a system of parenthesis within parenthesis, and it was often\r\nimpossible to understand the drift of what he was saying until he came\r\nto the end of his sentence. He used to say of himself that he was not\r\nquick enough to hold an argument with any one, and I think this was\r\ntrue. Unless it was a subject on which he was just then at work, he\r\ncould not get the train of argument into working order quickly enough.\r\nThis is shown even in his letters; thus, in the case of two letters to\r\nProf. Semper about the effect of isolation, he did not recall the series\r\nof facts he wanted until some days after the first letter had been sent\r\noff.\r\n\r\nWhen puzzled in talking, he had a peculiar stammer on the first word of\r\na sentence. I only recall this occurring with words beginning with w;\r\npossibly he had a special difficulty with this letter, for I have heard\r\nhim say that as a boy he could not pronounce w, and that sixpence was\r\noffered him if he could say \"white wine,\" which he pronounced \"rite\r\nrine.\" Possibly he may have inherited this tendency from Erasmus\r\nDarwin, who stammered. (My father related a Johnsonian answer of Erasmus\r\nDarwin's: \"Don't you find it very inconvenient stammering, Dr. Darwin?\"\r\n\"No, sir, because I have time to think before I speak, and don't ask\r\nimpertinent questions.\")\r\n\r\nHe sometimes combined his metaphors in a curious way, using such a\r\nphrase as \"holding on like life,\"--a mixture of \"holding on for his\r\nlife,\" and \"holding on like grim death.\" It came from his eager way of\r\nputting emphasis into what he was saying. This sometimes gave an air of\r\nexaggeration where it was not intended; but it gave, too, a noble air\r\nof strong and generous conviction; as, for instance, when he gave his\r\nevidence before the Royal Commission on vivisection and came out with\r\nhis words about cruelty, \"It deserves detestation and abhorrence.\"\r\nWhen he felt strongly about any similar question, he could hardly trust\r\nhimself to speak, as he then easily became angry, a thing which he\r\ndisliked excessively. He was conscious that his anger had a tendency\r\nto multiply itself in the utterance, and for this reason dreaded (for\r\nexample) having to scold a servant.\r\n\r\nIt was a great proof of the modesty of his style of talking, that, when,\r\nfor instance, a number of visitors came over from Sir John Lubbock's for\r\na Sunday afternoon call he never seemed to be preaching or lecturing,\r\nalthough he had so much of the talk to himself. He was particularly\r\ncharming when \"chaffing\" any one, and in high spirits over it. His\r\nmanner at such times was light-hearted and boyish, and his refinement\r\nof nature came out most strongly. So, when he was talking to a lady who\r\npleased and amused him, the combination of raillery and deference in his\r\nmanner was delightful to see.\r\n\r\nWhen my father had several guests he managed them well, getting a talk\r\nwith each, or bringing two or three together round his chair. In\r\nthese conversations there was always a good deal of fun, and, speaking\r\ngenerally, there was either a humorous turn in his talk, or a sunny\r\ngeniality which served instead. Perhaps my recollection of a pervading\r\nelement of humour is the more vivid, because the best talks were with\r\nMr. Huxley, in whom there is the aptness which is akin to humour, even\r\nwhen humour itself is not there. My father enjoyed Mr. Huxley's humour\r\nexceedingly, and would often say, \"What splendid fun Huxley is!\" I think\r\nhe probably had more scientific argument (of the nature of a fight) with\r\nLyell and Sir Joseph Hooker.\r\n\r\nHe used to say that it grieved him to find that for the friends of his\r\nlater life he had not the warm affection of his youth. Certainly in his\r\nearly letters from Cambridge he gives proofs of very strong friendship\r\nfor Herbert and Fox; but no one except himself would have said that\r\nhis affection for his friends was not, throughout life, of the warmest\r\npossible kind. In serving a friend he would not spare himself, and\r\nprecious time and strength were willingly given. He undoubtedly had,\r\nto an unusual degree, the power of attaching his friends to him. He had\r\nmany warm friendships, but to Sir Joseph Hooker he was bound by ties\r\nof affection stronger than we often see among men. He wrote in his\r\n'Recollections,' \"I have known hardly any man more lovable than Hooker.\"\r\n\r\nHis relationship to the village people was a pleasant one; he treated\r\nthem, one and all, with courtesy, when he came in contact with them, and\r\ntook an interest in all relating to their welfare. Some time after he\r\ncame to live at Down he helped to found a Friendly Club, and served as\r\ntreasurer for thirty years. He took much trouble about the club, keeping\r\nits accounts with minute and scrupulous exactness, and taking pleasure\r\nin its prosperous condition. Every Whit-Monday the club used to march\r\nround with band and banner, and paraded on the lawn in front of the\r\nhouse. There he met them, and explained to them their financial position\r\nin a little speech seasoned with a few well worn jokes. He was often\r\nunwell enough to make even this little ceremony an exertion, but I think\r\nhe never failed to meet them.\r\n\r\nHe was also treasurer of the Coal Club, which gave him some work, and he\r\nacted for some years as a County Magistrate.\r\n\r\nWith regard to my father's interest in the affairs of the village, Mr.\r\nBrodie Innes has been so good as to give me his recollections:--\r\n\r\n\"On my becoming Vicar of Down in 1846, we became friends, and so\r\ncontinued till his death. His conduct towards me and my family was one\r\nof unvarying kindness, and we repaid it by warm affection.\r\n\r\n\"In all parish matters he was an active assistant; in matters\r\nconnected with the schools, charities, and other business, his liberal\r\ncontribution was ever ready, and in the differences which at times\r\noccurred in that, as in other parishes, I was always sure of his\r\nsupport. He held that where there was really no important objection,\r\nhis assistance should be given to the clergyman, who ought to know the\r\ncircumstances best, and was chiefly responsible.\"\r\n\r\nHis intercourse with strangers was marked with scrupulous and rather\r\nformal politeness, but in fact he had few opportunities of meeting\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nDr. Lane has described (Lecture by Dr. B.W. Richardson, in St. George's\r\nHall, October 22, 1882.) how, on the rare occasion of my father\r\nattending a lecture (Dr. Sanderson's) at the Royal Institution, \"the\r\nwhole assembly...rose to their feet to welcome him,\" while he seemed\r\n\"scarcely conscious that such an outburst of applause could possibly\r\nbe intended for himself.\" The quiet life he led at Down made him feel\r\nconfused in a large society; for instance, at the Royal Society's\r\nsoirees he felt oppressed by the numbers. The feeling that he ought\r\nto know people, and the difficulty he had in remembering faces in his\r\nlatter years, also added to his discomfort on such occasions. He did not\r\nrealise that he would be recognised from his photographs, and I remember\r\nhis being uneasy at being obviously recognised by a stranger at the\r\nCrystal Palace Aquarium.\r\n\r\nI must say something of his manner of working: one characteristic of it\r\nwas his respect for time; he never forgot how precious it was. This\r\nwas shown, for instance, in the way in which he tried to curtail his\r\nholidays; also, and more clearly, with respect to shorter periods. He\r\nwould often say, that saving the minutes was the way to get work done;\r\nhe showed his love of saving the minutes in the difference he felt\r\nbetween a quarter of an hour and ten minutes' work; he never wasted a\r\nfew spare minutes from thinking that it was not worth while to set to\r\nwork. I was often struck by his way of working up to the very limit of\r\nhis strength, so that he suddenly stopped in dictating, with the words,\r\n\"I believe I mustn't do any more.\" The same eager desire not to lose\r\ntime was seen in his quick movements when at work. I particularly\r\nremember noticing this when he was making an experiment on the roots of\r\nbeans, which required some care in manipulation; fastening the little\r\nbits of card upon the roots was done carefully and necessarily slowly,\r\nbut the intermediate movements were all quick; taking a fresh bean,\r\nseeing that the root was healthy, impaling it on a pin, fixing it on\r\na cork, and seeing that it was vertical, etc; all these processes were\r\nperformed with a kind of restrained eagerness. He always gave one the\r\nimpression of working with pleasure, and not with any drag. I have an\r\nimage, too, of him as he recorded the result of some experiment, looking\r\neagerly at each root, etc., and then writing with equal eagerness. I\r\nremember the quick movement of his head up and down as he looked from\r\nthe object to the notes.\r\n\r\nHe saved a great deal of time through not having to do things twice.\r\nAlthough he would patiently go on repeating experiments where there\r\nwas any good to be gained, he could not endure having to repeat an\r\nexperiment which ought, if complete care had been taken, to have\r\nsucceeded the first time--and this gave him a continual anxiety that the\r\nexperiment should not be wasted; he felt the experiment to be sacred,\r\nhowever slight a one it was. He wished to learn as much as possible\r\nfrom an experiment, so that he did not confine himself to observing\r\nthe single point to which the experiment was directed, and his power of\r\nseeing a number of other things was wonderful. I do not think he cared\r\nfor preliminary or rough observation intended to serve as guides and\r\nto be repeated. Any experiment done was to be of some use, and in this\r\nconnection I remember how strongly he urged the necessity of keeping the\r\nnotes of experiments which failed, and to this rule he always adhered.\r\n\r\nIn the literary part of his work he had the same horror of losing time,\r\nand the same zeal in what he was doing at the moment, and this made him\r\ncareful not to be obliged unnecessarily to read anything a second time.\r\n\r\nHis natural tendency was to use simple methods and few instruments. The\r\nuse of the compound microscope has much increased since his youth,\r\nand this at the expense of the simple one. It strikes us nowadays as\r\nextraordinary that he should have had no compound microscope when he\r\nwent his \"Beagle\" voyage; but in this he followed the advice of Robt.\r\nBrown, who was an authority in such matters. He always had a great\r\nliking for the simple microscope, and maintained that nowadays it was\r\ntoo much neglected, and that one ought always to see as much as possible\r\nwith the simple before taking to the compound microscope. In one of his\r\nletters he speaks on this point, and remarks that he always suspects the\r\nwork of a man who never uses the simple microscope.\r\n\r\nHis dissecting table was a thick board, let into a window of the study;\r\nit was lower than an ordinary table, so that he could not have worked at\r\nit standing; but this, from wishing to save his strength, he would not\r\nhave done in any case. He sat at his dissecting-table on a curious\r\nlow stool which had belonged to his father, with a seat revolving on a\r\nvertical spindle, and mounted on large castors, so that he could turn\r\neasily from side to side. His ordinary tools, etc., were lying about on\r\nthe table, but besides these a number of odds and ends were kept in a\r\nround table full of radiating drawers, and turning on a vertical axis,\r\nwhich stood close by his left side, as he sat at his microscope-table.\r\nThe drawers were labelled, \"best tools,\" \"rough tools,\" \"specimens,\"\r\n\"preparations for specimens,\" etc. The most marked peculiarity of the\r\ncontents of these drawers was the care with which little scraps and\r\nalmost useless things were preserved; he held the well-known belief,\r\nthat if you threw a thing away you were sure to want it directly--and so\r\nthings accumulated.\r\n\r\nIf any one had looked at his tools, etc., lying on the table, he would\r\nhave been struck by an air of simpleness, make-shift, and oddness.\r\n\r\nAt his right hand were shelves, with a number of other odds and ends,\r\nglasses, saucers, tin biscuit boxes for germinating seeds, zinc labels,\r\nsaucers full of sand, etc., etc. Considering how tidy and methodical\r\nhe was in essential things, it is curious that he bore with so many\r\nmake-shifts: for instance, instead of having a box made of a desired\r\nshape, and stained black inside, he would hunt up something like what he\r\nwanted and get it darkened inside with shoe-blacking; he did not care\r\nto have glass covers made for tumblers in which he germinated seeds,\r\nbut used broken bits of irregular shape, with perhaps a narrow angle\r\nsticking uselessly out on one side. But so much of his experimenting was\r\nof a simple kind, that he had no need for any elaboration, and I think\r\nhis habit in this respect was in great measure due to his desire to\r\nhusband his strength, and not waste it on inessential things.\r\n\r\nHis way of marking objects may here be mentioned. If he had a number of\r\nthings to distinguish, such as leaves, flowers, etc., he tied threads of\r\ndifferent colours round them. In particular he used this method when\r\nhe had only two classes of objects to distinguish; thus in the case of\r\ncrossed and self-fertilised flowers, one set would be marked with\r\nblack and one with white thread, tied round the stalk of the flower. I\r\nremember well the look of two sets of capsules, gathered and waiting to\r\nbe weighed, counted, etc., with pieces of black and of white thread to\r\ndistinguish the trays in which they lay. When he had to compare two sets\r\nof seedlings, sowed in the same pot, he separated them by a partition of\r\nzinc-plate; and the zinc label, which gave the necessary details about\r\nthe experiment, was always placed on a certain side, so that it became\r\ninstinctive with him to know without reading the label which were the\r\n\"crossed\" and which were the \"self-fertilised.\"\r\n\r\nHis love of each particular experiment, and his eager zeal not to lose\r\nthe fruit of it, came out markedly in these crossing experiments--in\r\nthe elaborate care he took not to make any confusion in putting capsules\r\ninto wrong trays, etc., etc. I can recall his appearance as he counted\r\nseeds under the simple microscope with an alertness not usually\r\ncharacterising such mechanical work as counting. I think he personified\r\neach seed as a small demon trying to elude him by getting into the\r\nwrong heap, or jumping away altogether; and this gave to the work the\r\nexcitement of a game. He had great faith in instruments, and I do not\r\nthink it naturally occurred to him to doubt the accuracy of a scale or\r\nmeasuring glass, etc. He was astonished when we found that one of\r\nhis micrometers differed from the other. He did not require any great\r\naccuracy in most of his measurements, and had not good scales; he had an\r\nold three-foot rule, which was the common property of the household,\r\nand was constantly being borrowed, because it was the only one which\r\nwas certain to be in its place--unless, indeed, the last borrower had\r\nforgotten to put it back. For measuring the height of plants he had a\r\nseven-foot deal rod, graduated by the village carpenter. Latterly he\r\ntook to using paper scales graduated to millimeters. For small\r\nobjects he used a pair of compasses and an ivory protractor. It\r\nwas characteristic of him that he took scrupulous pains in making\r\nmeasurements with his somewhat rough scales. A trifling example of his\r\nfaith in authority is that he took his \"inch in terms of millimeters\"\r\nfrom an old book, in which it turned out to be inaccurately given.\r\nHe had a chemical balance which dated from the days when he worked at\r\nchemistry with his brother Erasmus. Measurements of capacity were made\r\nwith an apothecary's measuring glass: I remember well its rough look\r\nand bad graduation. With this, too, I remember the great care he took\r\nin getting the fluid-line on to the graduation. I do not mean by this\r\naccount of his instruments that any of his experiments suffered from\r\nwant of accuracy in measurement, I give them as examples of his simple\r\nmethods and faith in others--faith at least in instrument-makers, whose\r\nwhole trade was a mystery to him.\r\n\r\nA few of his mental characteristics, bearing especially on his mode of\r\nworking, occur to me. There was one quality of mind which seemed to be\r\nof special and extreme advantage in leading him to make discoveries.\r\nIt was the power of never letting exceptions pass unnoticed. Everybody\r\nnotices a fact as an exception when it is striking or frequent, but he\r\nhad a special instinct for arresting an exception. A point apparently\r\nslight and unconnected with his present work is passed over by many a\r\nman almost unconsciously with some half-considered explanation, which\r\nis in fact no explanation. It was just these things that he seized on to\r\nmake a start from. In a certain sense there is nothing special in this\r\nprocedure, many discoveries being made by means of it. I only mention\r\nit because, as I watched him at work, the value of this power to an\r\nexperimenter was so strongly impressed upon me.\r\n\r\nAnother quality which was shown in his experimental works was his power\r\nof sticking to a subject; he used almost to apologise for his patience,\r\nsaying that he could not bear to be beaten, as if this were rather a\r\nsign of weakness on his part. He often quoted the saying, \"It's dogged\r\nas does it;\" and I think doggedness expresses his frame of mind almost\r\nbetter than perseverance. Perseverance seems hardly to express his\r\nalmost fierce desire to force the truth to reveal itself. He often said\r\nthat it was important that a man should know the right point at which to\r\ngive up an inquiry. And I think it was his tendency to pass this point\r\nthat inclined him to apologise for his perseverance, and gave the air of\r\ndoggedness to his work.\r\n\r\nHe often said that no one could be a good observer unless he was an\r\nactive theoriser. This brings me back to what I said about his instinct\r\nfor arresting exceptions: it was as though he were charged with\r\ntheorising power ready to flow into any channel on the slightest\r\ndisturbance, so that no fact, however small, could avoid releasing a\r\nstream of theory, and thus the fact became magnified into importance. In\r\nthis way it naturally happened that many untenable theories occurred\r\nto him; but fortunately his richness of imagination was equalled by his\r\npower of judging and condemning the thoughts that occurred to him. He\r\nwas just to his theories, and did not condemn them unheard; and so it\r\nhappened that he was willing to test what would seem to most people\r\nnot at all worth testing. These rather wild trials he called \"fool's\r\nexperiments,\" and enjoyed extremely. As an example I may mention that\r\nfinding the cotyledons of Biophytum to be highly sensitive to vibrations\r\nof the table, he fancied that they might perceive the vibrations of\r\nsound, and therefore made me play my bassoon close to a plant. (This is\r\nnot so much an example of superabundant theorising from a small cause,\r\nbut only of his wish to test the most improbable ideas.)\r\n\r\nThe love of experiment was very strong in him, and I can remember the\r\nway he would say, \"I shan't be easy till I have tried it,\" as if an\r\noutside force were driving him. He enjoyed experimenting much more than\r\nwork which only entailed reasoning, and when he was engaged on one of\r\nhis books which required argument and the marshalling of facts, he felt\r\nexperimental work to be a rest or holiday. Thus, while working upon\r\nthe 'Variations of Animals and Plants,' in 1860-61, he made out the\r\nfertilisation of Orchids, and thought himself idle for giving so much\r\ntime to them. It is interesting to think that so important a piece of\r\nresearch should have been undertaken and largely worked out as a pastime\r\nin place of more serious work. The letters to Hooker of this period\r\ncontain expressions such as, \"God forgive me for being so idle; I am\r\nquite sillily interested in this work.\" The intense pleasure he took\r\nin understanding the adaptations for fertilisation is strongly shown\r\nin these letters. He speaks in one of his letters of his intention of\r\nworking at Drosera as a rest from the 'Descent of Man.' He has described\r\nin his 'Recollections' the strong satisfaction he felt in solving the\r\nproblem of heterostylism. And I have heard him mention that the Geology\r\nof South America gave him almost more pleasure than anything else. It\r\nwas perhaps this delight in work requiring keen observation that\r\nmade him value praise given to his observing powers almost more than\r\nappreciation of his other qualities.\r\n\r\nFor books he had no respect, but merely considered them as tools to be\r\nworked with. Thus he did not bind them, and even when a paper book fell\r\nto pieces from use, as happened to Muller's 'Befruchtung,' he preserved\r\nit from complete dissolution by putting a metal clip over its back.\r\nIn the same way he would cut a heavy book in half, to make it more\r\nconvenient to hold. He used to boast that he made Lyell publish the\r\nsecond edition of one of his books in two volumes instead of one, by\r\ntelling him how he had been obliged to cut it in half. Pamphlets were\r\noften treated even more severely than books, for he would tear out, for\r\nthe sake of saving room, all the pages except the one that interested\r\nhim. The consequence of all this was, that his library was not\r\nornamental, but was striking from being so evidently a working\r\ncollection of books.\r\n\r\nHe was methodical in his manner of reading books and pamphlets bearing\r\non his own work. He had one shelf on which were piled up the books\r\nhe had not yet read, and another to which they were transferred after\r\nhaving been read, and before being catalogued. He would often groan over\r\nhis unread books, because there were so many which he knew he should\r\nnever read. Many a book was at once transferred to the other heap,\r\neither marked with a cypher at the end, to show that it contained no\r\nmarked passages, or inscribed, perhaps, \"not read,\" or \"only skimmed.\"\r\nThe books accumulated in the \"read\" heap until the shelves overflowed,\r\nand then, with much lamenting, a day was given up to the cataloguing. He\r\ndisliked this work, and as the necessity of undertaking the work became\r\nimperative, would often say, in a voice of despair, \"We really must do\r\nthese books soon.\"\r\n\r\nIn each book, as he read it, he marked passages bearing on his work. In\r\nreading a book or pamphlet, etc., he made pencil-lines at the side of\r\nthe page, often adding short remarks, and at the end made a list of\r\nthe pages marked. When it was to be catalogued and put away, the marked\r\npages were looked at, and so a rough abstract of the book was made.\r\nThis abstract would perhaps be written under three or four headings on\r\ndifferent sheets, the facts being sorted out and added to the previously\r\ncollected facts in different subjects. He had other sets of abstracts\r\narranged, not according to subject, but according to periodical. When\r\ncollecting facts on a large scale, in earlier years, he used to\r\nread through, and make abstracts, in this way, of whole series of\r\nperiodicals.\r\n\r\nIn some of his early letters he speaks of filling several note-books\r\nwith facts for his book on species; but it was certainly early that\r\nhe adopted his plan of using portfolios as described in the\r\n'Recollections.' (The racks on which the portfolios were placed are\r\nshown in the illustration, \"The Study at Down,\" in the recess at the\r\nright-hand side of the fire-place.) My father and M. de Candolle were\r\nmutually pleased to discover that they had adopted the same plan of\r\nclassifying facts. De Candolle describes the method in his 'Phytologie,'\r\nand in his sketch of my father mentions the satisfaction he felt in\r\nseeing it in action at Down.\r\n\r\nBesides these portfolios, of which there are some dozens full of notes,\r\nthere are large bundles of MS. marked \"used\" and put away. He felt the\r\nvalue of his notes, and had a horror of their destruction by fire. I\r\nremember, when some alarm of fire had happened, his begging me to be\r\nespecially careful, adding very earnestly, that the rest of his life\r\nwould be miserable if his notes and books were to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nHe shows the same feeling in writing about the loss of a manuscript,\r\nthe purport of his words being, \"I have a copy, or the loss would have\r\nkilled me.\" In writing a book he would spend much time and labour\r\nin making a skeleton or plan of the whole, and in enlarging and\r\nsub-classing each heading, as described in his 'Recollections.' I think\r\nthis careful arrangement of the plan was not at all essential to the\r\nbuilding up of his argument, but for its presentment, and for the\r\narrangement of his facts. In his 'Life of Erasmus Darwin,' as it was\r\nfirst printed in slips, the growth of the book from a skeleton was\r\nplainly visible. The arrangement was altered afterwards, because it\r\nwas too formal and categorical, and seemed to give the character of his\r\ngrandfather rather by means of a list of qualities than as a complete\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nIt was only within the last few years that he adopted a plan of writing\r\nwhich he was convinced suited him best, and which is described in the\r\n'Recollections;' namely, writing a rough copy straight off without the\r\nslightest attention to style. It was characteristic of him that he felt\r\nunable to write with sufficient want of care if he used his best paper,\r\nand thus it was that he wrote on the backs of old proofs or manuscript.\r\nThe rough copy was then reconsidered, and a fair copy was made. For this\r\npurpose he had foolscap paper ruled at wide intervals, the lines\r\nbeing needed to prevent him writing so closely that correction became\r\ndifficult. The fair copy was then corrected, and was recopied before\r\nbeing sent to the printers. The copying was done by Mr. E. Norman, who\r\nbegan this work many years ago when village schoolmaster at Down. My\r\nfather became so used to Mr. Norman's hand-writing, that he could\r\nnot correct manuscript, even when clearly written out by one of\r\nhis children, until it had been recopied by Mr. Norman. The MS., on\r\nreturning from Mr. Norman was once more corrected, and then sent off to\r\nthe printers. Then came the work of revising and correcting the proofs,\r\nwhich my father found especially wearisome.\r\n\r\nIt was at this stage that he first seriously considered the style of\r\nwhat he had written. When this was going on he usually started some\r\nother piece of work as a relief. The correction of slips consisted in\r\nfact of two processes, for the corrections were first written in pencil,\r\nand then re-considered and written in ink.\r\n\r\nWhen the book was passing through the \"slip\" stage he was glad to have\r\ncorrections and suggestions from others. Thus my mother looked over\r\nthe proofs of the 'Origin.' In some of the later works my sister, Mrs.\r\nLitchfield, did much of the correction. After my sister's marriage\r\nperhaps most of the work fell to my share.\r\n\r\nMy sister, Mrs. Litchfield, writes:--\r\n\r\n\"This work was very interesting in itself, and it was inexpressibly\r\nexhilarating to work for him. He was always so ready to be convinced\r\nthat any suggested alteration was an improvement, and so full of\r\ngratitude for the trouble taken. I do not think that he ever used to\r\nforget to tell me what improvement he thought that I had made, and he\r\nused almost to excuse himself if he did not agree with any correction. I\r\nthink I felt the singular modesty and graciousness of his nature through\r\nthus working for him in a way I never should otherwise have done.\r\n\r\n\"He did not write with ease, and was apt to invert his sentences both in\r\nwriting and speaking, putting the qualifying clause before it was clear\r\nwhat it was to qualify. He corrected a great deal, and was eager to\r\nexpress himself as well as he possibly could.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the commonest corrections needed were of obscurities due to the\r\nomission of a necessary link in the reasoning, something which he had\r\nevidently omitted through familiarity with the subject. Not that there\r\nwas any fault in the sequence of the thoughts, but that from familiarity\r\nwith his argument he did not notice when the words failed to reproduce\r\nhis thought. He also frequently put too much matter into one sentence,\r\nso that it had to be cut up into two.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I think the pains which my father took over the literary\r\npart of the work was very remarkable. He often laughed or grumbled at\r\nhimself for the difficulty which he found in writing English, saying,\r\nfor instance, that if a bad arrangement of a sentence was possible, he\r\nshould be sure to adopt it. He once got much amusement and satisfaction\r\nout of the difficulty which one of the family found in writing a short\r\ncircular. He had the pleasure of correcting and laughing at obscurities,\r\ninvolved sentences, and other defects, and thus took his revenge for\r\nall the criticism he had himself to bear with. He used to quote with\r\nastonishment Miss Martineau's advice to young authors, to write straight\r\noff and send the MS. to the printer without correction. But in some\r\ncases he acted in a somewhat similar manner. When a sentence got\r\nhopelessly involved, he would ask himself, \"now what DO you want\r\nto say?\" and his answer written down, would often disentangle the\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nHis style has been much praised; on the other hand, at least one good\r\njudge has remarked to me that it is not a good style. It is, above all\r\nthings, direct and clear; and it is characteristic of himself in its\r\nsimplicity, bordering on naivete, and in its absence of pretence. He had\r\nthe strongest disbelief in the common idea that a classical scholar must\r\nwrite good English; indeed, he thought that the contrary was the case.\r\nIn writing, he sometimes showed the same tendency to strong expressions\r\nas he did in conversation. Thus in the 'Origin,' page 440, there is\r\na description of a larval cirripede, \"with six pairs of beautifully\r\nconstructed natatory legs, a pair of magnificent compound eyes, and\r\nextremely complex antennae.\" We used to laugh at him for this sentence,\r\nwhich we compared to an advertisement. This tendency to give himself\r\nup to the enthusiastic turn of his thought, without fear of being\r\nludicrous, appears elsewhere in his writings.\r\n\r\nHis courteous and conciliatory tone towards his reader is remarkable,\r\nand it must be partly this quality which revealed his personal sweetness\r\nof character to so many who had never seen him. I have always felt it\r\nto be a curious fact, that he who had altered the face of Biological\r\nScience, and is in this respect the chief of the moderns, should have\r\nwritten and worked in so essentially a non-modern spirit and manner. In\r\nreading his books one is reminded of the older naturalists rather than\r\nof the modern school of writers. He was a Naturalist in the old sense of\r\nthe word, that is, a man who works at many branches of the science, not\r\nmerely a specialist in one. Thus it is, that, though he founded whole\r\nnew divisions of special subjects--such as the fertilisation of flowers,\r\ninsectivorous plants, dimorphism, etc.--yet even in treating these very\r\nsubjects he does not strike the reader as a specialist. The reader feels\r\nlike a friend who is being talked to by a courteous gentleman, not like\r\na pupil being lectured by a professor. The tone of such a book as the\r\n'Origin' is charming, and almost pathetic; it is the tone of a man who,\r\nconvinced of the truth of his own views, hardly expects to convince\r\nothers; it is just the reverse of the style of a fanatic, who wants to\r\nforce people to believe. The reader is never scorned for any amount of\r\ndoubt which he may be imagined to feel, and his scepticism is\r\ntreated with patient respect. A sceptical reader, or perhaps even\r\nan unreasonable reader, seems to have been generally present to his\r\nthoughts. It was in consequence of this feeling, perhaps, that he took\r\nmuch trouble over points which he imagined would strike the reader, or\r\nsave him trouble, and so tempt him to read.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason he took much interest in the illustrations of\r\nhis books, and I think rated rather too highly their value. The\r\nillustrations for his earlier books were drawn by professional artists.\r\nThis was the case in 'Animals and Plants,' the 'Descent of Man,' and\r\nthe 'Expression of the Emotions.' On the other hand, 'Climbing Plants,'\r\n'Insectivorous Plants,' the 'Movements of Plants,' and 'Forms\r\nof Flowers,' were, to a large extent, illustrated by some of his\r\nchildren--my brother George having drawn by far the most. It was\r\ndelightful to draw for him, as he was enthusiastic in his praise of very\r\nmoderate performances. I remember well his charming manner of receiving\r\nthe drawings of one of his daughters-in-law, and how he would finish his\r\nwords of praise by saying, \"Tell A--, Michael Angelo is nothing to\r\nit.\" Though he praised so generously, he always looked closely at the\r\ndrawing, and easily detected mistakes or carelessness.\r\n\r\nHe had a horror of being lengthy, and seems to have been really much\r\nannoyed and distressed when he found how the 'Variations of Animals and\r\nPlants' was growing under his hands. I remember his cordially agreeing\r\nwith 'Tristram Shandy's' words, \"Let no man say, 'Come, I'll write a\r\nduodecimo.'\"\r\n\r\nHis consideration for other authors was as marked a characteristic as\r\nhis tone towards his reader. He speaks of all other authors as persons\r\ndeserving of respect. In cases where, as in the case of --'s experiments\r\non Drosera, he thought lightly of the author, he speaks of him in such a\r\nway that no one would suspect it. In other cases he treats the confused\r\nwritings of ignorant persons as though the fault lay with himself for\r\nnot appreciating or understanding them. Besides this general tone of\r\nrespect, he had a pleasant way of expressing his opinion on the value of\r\na quoted work, or his obligation for a piece of private information.\r\n\r\nHis respectful feeling was not only morally beautiful, but was I\r\nthink of practical use in making him ready to consider the ideas and\r\nobservations of all manner of people. He used almost to apologise for\r\nthis, and would say that he was at first inclined to rate everything too\r\nhighly.\r\n\r\nIt was a great merit in his mind that, in spite of having so strong a\r\nrespectful feeling towards what he read, he had the keenest of instincts\r\nas to whether a man was trustworthy or not. He seemed to form a very\r\ndefinite opinion as to the accuracy of the men whose books he read; and\r\nmade use of this judgment in his choice of facts for use in argument\r\nor as illustrations. I gained the impression that he felt this power of\r\njudging of a man's trustworthiness to be of much value.\r\n\r\nHe had a keen feeling of the sense of honour that ought to reign among\r\nauthors, and had a horror of any kind of laxness in quoting. He had\r\na contempt for the love of honour and glory, and in his letters often\r\nblames himself for the pleasure he took in the success of his books,\r\nas though he were departing from his ideal--a love of truth and\r\ncarelessness about fame. Often, when writing to Sir J. Hooker what he\r\ncalls a boasting letter, he laughs at himself for his conceit and want\r\nof modesty. There is a wonderfully interesting letter which he wrote\r\nto my mother bequeathing to her, in case of his death, the care of\r\npublishing the manuscript of his first essay on evolution. This letter\r\nseems to me full of the intense desire that his theory should succeed\r\nas a contribution to knowledge, and apart from any desire for personal\r\nfame. He certainly had the healthy desire for success which a man of\r\nstrong feelings ought to have. But at the time of the publication of\r\nthe 'Origin' it is evident that he was overwhelmingly satisfied with the\r\nadherence of such men as Lyell, Hooker, Huxley, and Asa Gray, and did\r\nnot dream of or desire any such wide and general fame as he attained to.\r\n\r\nConnected with his contempt for the undue love of fame, was an equally\r\nstrong dislike of all questions of priority. The letters to Lyell, at\r\nthe time of the 'Origin,' show the anger he felt with himself for not\r\nbeing able to repress a feeling of disappointment at what he thought\r\nwas Mr. Wallace's forestalling of all his years of work. His sense of\r\nliterary honour comes out strongly in these letters; and his feeling\r\nabout priority is again shown in the admiration expressed in his\r\n'Recollections' of Mr. Wallace's self-annihilation.\r\n\r\nHis feeling about reclamations, including answers to attacks and all\r\nkinds of discussions, was strong. It is simply expressed in a letter to\r\nFalconer (1863?), \"If I ever felt angry towards you, for whom I have a\r\nsincere friendship, I should begin to suspect that I was a little mad. I\r\nwas very sorry about your reclamation, as I think it is in every case\r\na mistake and should be left to others. Whether I should so act myself\r\nunder provocation is a different question.\" It was a feeling partly\r\ndictated by instinctive delicacy, and partly by a strong sense of the\r\nwaste of time, energy, and temper thus caused. He said that he owed his\r\ndetermination not to get into discussions (He departed from his rule in\r\nhis \"Note on the Habits of the Pampas Woodpecker, Colaptes campestris,\"\r\n'Proc. Zool. Soc.,' 1870, page 705: also in a letter published in the\r\n'Athenaeum' (1863, page 554), in which case he afterwards regretted\r\nthat he had not remained silent. His replies to criticisms, in the later\r\neditions of the 'Origin,' can hardly be classed as infractions of his\r\nrule.) to the advice of Lyell,--advice which he transmitted to those\r\namong his friends who were given to paper warfare.\r\n\r\nIf the character of my father's working life is to be understood, the\r\nconditions of ill-health, under which he worked, must be constantly\r\nborne in mind. He bore his illness with such uncomplaining patience,\r\nthat even his children can hardly, I believe, realise the extent of his\r\nhabitual suffering. In their case the difficulty is heightened by the\r\nfact that, from the days of their earliest recollections, they saw him\r\nin constant ill-health,--and saw him, in spite of it, full of pleasure\r\nin what pleased them. Thus, in later life, their perception of what he\r\nendured had to be disentangled from the impression produced in childhood\r\nby constant genial kindness under conditions of unrecognised difficulty.\r\nNo one indeed, except my mother, knows the full amount of suffering\r\nhe endured, or the full amount of his wonderful patience. For all the\r\nlatter years of his life she never left him for a night; and her days\r\nwere so planned that all his resting hours might be shared with her. She\r\nshielded him from every avoidable annoyance, and omitted nothing that\r\nmight save him trouble, or prevent him becoming overtired, or that might\r\nalleviate the many discomforts of his ill-health. I hesitate to speak\r\nthus freely of a thing so sacred as the life-long devotion which\r\nprompted all this constant and tender care. But it is, I repeat, a\r\nprincipal feature of his life, that for nearly forty years he never knew\r\none day of the health of ordinary men, and that thus his life was one\r\nlong struggle against the weariness and strain of sickness. And this\r\ncannot be told without speaking of the one condition which enabled him\r\nto bear the strain and fight out the struggle to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS.\r\n\r\nThe earliest letters to which I have access are those written by my\r\nfather when an undergraduate at Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThe history of his life, as told in his correspondence, must therefore\r\nbegin with this period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.IV. -- CAMBRIDGE LIFE.\r\n\r\n[My father's Cambridge life comprises the time between the Lent Term,\r\n1828, when he came up as a Freshman, and the end of the May Term, 1831,\r\nwhen he took his degree and left the University.]\r\n\r\nIt appears from the College books, that my father \"admissus est\r\npensionarius minor sub Magistro Shaw\" on October 15, 1827. He did not\r\ncome into residence till the Lent Term, 1828, so that, although he\r\npassed his examination in due season, he was unable to take his degree\r\nat the usual time,--the beginning of the Lent Term, 1831. In such a case\r\na man usually took his degree before Ash-Wednesday, when he was called\r\n\"Baccalaureus ad Diem Cinerum,\" and ranked with the B.A.'s of the\r\nyear. My father's name, however, occurs in the list of Bachelors\r\n\"ad Baptistam,\" or those admitted between Ash-Wednesday and St. John\r\nBaptist's Day (June 24th); (\"On Tuesday last Charles Darwin, of Christ's\r\nCollege, was admitted B.A.\"--\"Cambridge Chronicle\", Friday, April 29,\r\n1831.) he therefore took rank among the Bachelors of 1832.\r\n\r\nHe \"kept\" for a term or two in lodgings, over Bacon the tobacconist's;\r\nnot, however, over the shop in the Market Place, now so well known to\r\nCambridge men, but in Sidney Street. For the rest of his time he had\r\npleasant rooms on the south side of the first court of Christ's. (The\r\nrooms are on the first floor, on the west side of the middle staircase.\r\nA medallion (given by my brother) has recently been let into the wall of\r\nthe sitting-room.)\r\n\r\nWhat determined the choice of this college for his brother Erasmus\r\nand himself I have no means of knowing. Erasmus the elder, their\r\ngrandfather, had been at St. John's, and this college might have been\r\nreasonably selected for them, being connected with Shrewsbury School.\r\nBut the life of an under-graduate at St. John's seems, in those days, to\r\nhave been a troubled one, if I may judge from the fact that a relative\r\nof mine migrated thence to Christ's to escape the harassing discipline\r\nof the place. A story told by Mr. Herbert illustrates the same state of\r\nthings:--\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning of the October Term of 1830, an incident occurred\r\nwhich was attended with somewhat disagreeable, though ludicrous\r\nconsequences to myself. Darwin asked me to take a long walk with him in\r\nthe Fens, to search for some natural objects he was desirous of having.\r\nAfter a very long, fatiguing day's work, we dined together, late in the\r\nevening, at his rooms in Christ's College; and as soon as our dinner was\r\nover we threw ourselves into easy chairs and fell sound asleep. I was\r\nfirst to awake, about three in the morning, when, having looked at my\r\nwatch, and knowing the strict rule of St. John's, which required men in\r\nstatu pupillari to come into college before midnight, I rushed homeward\r\nat the utmost speed, in fear of the consequences, but hoping that the\r\nDean would accept the excuse as sufficient when I told him the\r\nreal facts. He, however, was inexorable, and refused to receive my\r\nexplanations, or any evidence I could bring; and although during\r\nmy undergraduateship I had never been reported for coming late into\r\nCollege, now, when I was a hard-working B.A., and had five or six\r\npupils, he sentenced me to confinement to the College walls for the\r\nrest of the term. Darwin's indignation knew no bounds, and the stupid\r\ninjustice and tyranny of the Dean raised not only a perfect ferment\r\namong my friends, but was the subject of expostulation from some of the\r\nleading members of the University.\"\r\n\r\nMy father seems to have found no difficulty in living at peace with\r\nall men in and out of office at Lady Margaret's other foundation. The\r\nimpression of a contemporary of my father's is that Christ's in their\r\nday was a pleasant, fairly quiet college, with some tendency towards\r\n\"horsiness\"; many of the men made a custom of going to Newmarket during\r\nthe races, though betting was not a regular practice. In this they were\r\nby no means discouraged by the Senior Tutor, Mr. Shaw, who was himself\r\ngenerally to be seen on the Heath on these occasions. There was a\r\nsomewhat high proportion of Fellow-Commoners,--eight or nine, to sixty\r\nor seventy Pensioners, and this would indicate that it was not an\r\nunpleasant college for men with money to spend and with no great love of\r\nstrict discipline.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the service was conducted in chapel shows that the\r\nDean, at least, was not over zealous. I have heard my father tell how\r\nat evening chapel the Dean used to read alternate verses of the Psalms,\r\nwithout making even a pretence of waiting for the congregation to take\r\ntheir share. And when the Lesson was a lengthy one, he would rise and\r\ngo on with the Canticles after the scholar had read fifteen or twenty\r\nverses.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that my father often spoke of his Cambridge life as if it\r\nhad been so much time wasted, forgetting that, although the set studies\r\nof the place were barren enough for him, he yet gained in the highest\r\ndegree the best advantages of a University life--the contact with men\r\nand an opportunity for his mind to grow vigorously. It is true that he\r\nvalued at its highest the advantages which he gained from associating\r\nwith Professor Henslow and some others, but he seemed to consider this\r\nas a chance outcome of his life at Cambridge, not an advantage for which\r\nAlma Mater could claim any credit. One of my father's Cambridge friends\r\nwas the late Mr. J.M. Herbert, County Court Judge for South Wales, from\r\nwhom I was fortunate enough to obtain some notes which help us to gain\r\nan idea of how my father impressed his contemporaries. Mr. Herbert\r\nwrites: \"I think it was in the spring of 1828 that I first met Darwin,\r\neither at my cousin Whitley's rooms in St. John's, or at the rooms of\r\nsome other of his old Shrewsbury schoolfellows, with many of whom I was\r\non terms of great intimacy. But it certainly was in the summer of that\r\nyear that our acquaintance ripened into intimacy, when we happened to\r\nbe together at Barmouth, for the Long Vacation, reading with private\r\ntutors,--he with Batterton of St. John's, his Classical and Mathematical\r\nTutor, and I with Yate of St. John's.\"\r\n\r\nThe intercourse between them practically ceased in 1831, when my father\r\nsaid goodbye to Herbert at Cambridge, on starting on his \"Beagle\"\r\nvoyage. I once met Mr. Herbert, then almost an old man, and I was much\r\nstruck by the evident warmth and freshness of the affection with which\r\nhe remembered my father. The notes from which I quote end with this\r\nwarm-hearted eulogium: \"It would be idle for me to speak of his vast\r\nintellectual powers...but I cannot end this cursory and rambling sketch\r\nwithout testifying, and I doubt not all his surviving college friends\r\nwould concur with me, that he was the most genial, warm-hearted,\r\ngenerous, and affectionate of friends; that his sympathies were with all\r\nthat was good and true; and that he had a cordial hatred for everything\r\nfalse, or vile, or cruel, or mean, or dishonourable. He was not only\r\ngreat, but pre-eminently good, and just, and loveable.\"\r\n\r\nTwo anecdotes told by Mr. Herbert show that my father's feeling for\r\nsuffering, whether of man or beast, was as strong in him as a young man\r\nas it was in later years: \"Before he left Cambridge he told me that he\r\nhad made up his mind not to shoot any more; that he had had two days'\r\nshooting at his friend's, Mr. Owen of Woodhouse; and that on the second\r\nday, when going over some of the ground they had beaten on the day\r\nbefore, he picked up a bird not quite dead, but lingering from a shot it\r\nhad received on the previous day; and that it had made and left such a\r\npainful impression on his mind, that he could not reconcile it to his\r\nconscience to continue to derive pleasure from a sport which inflicted\r\nsuch cruel suffering.\"\r\n\r\nTo realise the strength of the feeling that led to this resolve, we must\r\nremember how passionate was his love of sport. We must recall the\r\nboy shooting his first snipe ('Recollections.'), and trembling with\r\nexcitement so that he could hardly reload his gun. Or think of such a\r\nsentence as, \"Upon my soul, it is only about a fortnight to the 'First,'\r\nthen if there is a bliss on earth that is it.\" (Letter from C. Darwin to\r\nW.D. Fox.)\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote told by Mr. Herbert illustrates again his tenderness of\r\nheart:--\r\n\r\n\"When at Barmouth he and I went to an exhibition of 'learned dogs.' In\r\nthe middle of the entertainment one of the dogs failed in performing the\r\ntrick his master told him to do. On the man reproving him, the dog put\r\non a most piteous expression, as if in fear of the whip. Darwin seeing\r\nit, asked me to leave with him, saying, 'Come along, I can't stand this\r\nany longer; how those poor dogs must have been licked.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is curious that the same feeling recurred to my father more\r\nthan fifty years afterwards, on seeing some performing dogs at the\r\nWestminster Aquarium; on this occasion he was reassured by the manager\r\ntelling him that the dogs were taught more by reward than by punishment.\r\nMr. Herbert goes on:--\"It stirred one's inmost depth of feeling to hear\r\nhim descant upon, and groan over, the horrors of the slave-trade, or the\r\ncruelties to which the suffering Poles were subjected at Warsaw...These,\r\nand other like proofs have left on my mind the conviction that a more\r\nhumane or tender-hearted man never lived.\"\r\n\r\nHis old college friends agree in speaking with affectionate warmth of\r\nhis pleasant, genial temper as a young man. From what they have been\r\nable to tell me, I gain the impression of a young man overflowing with\r\nanimal spirits--leading a varied healthy life--not over-industrious in\r\nthe set of studies of the place, but full of other pursuits, which were\r\nfollowed with a rejoicing enthusiasm. Entomology, riding, shooting in\r\nthe fens, suppers and card-playing, music at King's Chapel, engravings\r\nat the Fitzwilliam Museum, walks with Professor Henslow--all combined\r\nto fill up a happy life. He seems to have infected others with his\r\nenthusiasm. Mr. Herbert relates how, during the same Barmouth summer,\r\nhe was pressed into the service of \"the science\"--as my father called\r\ncollecting beetles. They took their daily walks together among the hills\r\nbehind Barmouth, or boated in the Mawddach estuary, or sailed to\r\nSarn Badrig to land there at low water, or went fly-fishing in the\r\nCors-y-gedol lakes. \"On these occasions Darwin entomologized most\r\nindustriously, picking up creatures as he walked along, and bagging\r\neverything which seemed worthy of being pursued, or of further\r\nexamination. And very soon he armed me with a bottle of alcohol, in\r\nwhich I had to drop any beetle which struck me as not of a common kind.\r\nI performed this duty with some diligence in my constitutional walks;\r\nbut alas! my powers of discrimination seldom enabled me to secure a\r\nprize--the usual result, on his examining the contents of my bottle,\r\nbeing an exclamation, 'Well, old Cherbury' (No doubt in allusion to the\r\ntitle of Lord Herbert of Cherbury.) (the nickname he gave me, and by\r\nwhich he usually addressed me), 'none of these will do.'\" Again, the\r\nRev. T. Butler, who was one of the Barmouth reading-party in 1828, says:\r\n\"He inoculated me with a taste for Botany which has stuck by me all my\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nArchdeacon Watkins, another old college friend of my father's,\r\nremembers him unearthing beetles in the willows between Cambridge and\r\nGrantchester, and speaks of a certain beetle the remembrance of whose\r\nname is \"Crux major.\" (Panagaeus crux-major.) How enthusiastically must\r\nmy father have exulted over this beetle to have impressed its name on\r\na companion so that he remembers it after half a century! Archdeacon\r\nWatkins goes on: \"I do not forget the long and very interesting\r\nconversations that we had about Brazilian scenery and tropical\r\nvegetation of all sorts. Nor do I forget the way and the vehemence\r\nwith which he rubbed his chin when he got excited on such subjects, and\r\ndiscoursed eloquently of lianas, orchids, etc.\"\r\n\r\nHe became intimate with Henslow, the Professor of Botany, and through\r\nhim with some other older members of the University. \"But,\" Mr. Herbert\r\nwrites, \"he always kept up the closest connection with the friends of\r\nhis own standing; and at our frequent social gatherings--at breakfast,\r\nwine or supper parties--he was ever one of the most cheerful, the most\r\npopular, and the most welcome.\"\r\n\r\nMy father formed one of a club for dining once a week, called the\r\nGourmet (Mr. Herbert mentions the name as 'The Glutton Club.') Club,\r\nthe members, besides himself and Mr. Herbert (from whom I quote), being\r\nWhitley of St. John's, now Honorary Canon of Durham (Formerly Reader\r\nin Natural Philosophy at Durham University.); Heaviside of Sidney, now\r\nCanon of Norwich; Lovett Cameron of Trinity, now vicar of Shoreham;\r\nBlane of Trinity, who held a high post during the Crimean war; H. Lowe\r\n(Brother of Lord Sherbrooke.) (Now Sherbrooke) of Trinity Hall; and\r\nWatkins of Emmanuel, now Archdeacon of York. The origin of the club's\r\nname seems already to have become involved in obscurity. Mr. Herbert\r\nsays that it was chosen in derision of another \"set of men who called\r\nthemselves by a long Greek name signifying 'fond of dainties,' but who\r\nfalsified their claim to such a designation by their weekly practice of\r\ndining at some roadside inn, six miles from Cambridge, on mutton chops\r\nor beans and bacon.\" Another old member of the club tells me that the\r\nname arose because the members were given to making experiments on\r\n\"birds and beasts which were before unknown to human palate.\" He says\r\nthat hawk and bittern were tried, and that their zeal broke down over\r\nan old brown owl, \"which was indescribable.\" At any rate, the meetings\r\nseemed to have been successful, and to have ended with \"a game of mild\r\nvingt-et-un.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert gives an amusing account of the musical examinations\r\ndescribed by my father in his \"Recollections.\" Mr. Herbert speaks\r\nstrongly of his love of music, and adds, \"What gave him the greatest\r\ndelight was some grand symphony or overture of Mozart's or Beethoven's,\r\nwith their full harmonies.\" On one occasion Herbert remembers\r\n\"accompanying him to the afternoon service at King's, when we heard\r\na very beautiful anthem. At the end of one of the parts, which was\r\nexceedingly impressive, he turned round to me and said, with a deep\r\nsigh, 'How's your backbone?'\" He often spoke of a feeling of coldness or\r\nshivering in his back on hearing beautiful music.\r\n\r\nBesides a love of music, he had certainly at this time a love of fine\r\nliterature; and Mr. Cameron tells me that he used to read Shakespeare\r\nto my father in his rooms at Christ's, who took much pleasure in it.\r\nHe also speaks of his \"great liking for first-class line engravings,\r\nespecially those of Raphael Morghen and Muller; and he spent hours in\r\nthe Fitzwilliam Museum in looking over the prints in that collection.\"\r\n\r\nMy father's letters to Fox show how sorely oppressed he felt by the\r\nreading of an examination: \"I am reading very hard, and have spirits for\r\nnothing. I actually have not stuck a beetle this term.\" His despair over\r\nmathematics must have been profound, when he expressed a hope that Fox's\r\nsilence is due to \"your being ten fathoms deep in the Mathematics; and\r\nif you are, God help you, for so am I, only with this difference, I\r\nstick fast in the mud at the bottom, and there I shall remain.\" Mr.\r\nHerbert says: \"He had, I imagine, no natural turn for mathematics, and\r\nhe gave up his mathematical reading before he had mastered the first\r\npart of Algebra, having had a special quarrel with Surds and the\r\nBinomial Theorem.\"\r\n\r\nWe get some evidence from his letters to Fox of my father's intention\r\nof going into the Church. \"I am glad,\" he writes (March 18, 1829.), \"to\r\nhear that you are reading divinity. I should like to know what books\r\nyou are reading, and your opinions about them; you need not be afraid\r\nof preaching to me prematurely.\" Mr. Herbert's sketch shows how doubts\r\narose in my father's mind as to the possibility of his taking Orders.\r\nHe writes, \"We had an earnest conversation about going into Holy Orders;\r\nand I remember his asking me, with reference to the question put by the\r\nBishop in the ordination service, 'Do you trust that you are inwardly\r\nmoved by the Holy Spirit, etc.,' whether I could answer in the\r\naffirmative, and on my saying I could not, he said, 'Neither can I,\r\nand therefore I cannot take orders.'\" This conversation appears to have\r\ntaken place in 1829, and if so, the doubts here expressed must have been\r\nquieted, for in May 1830, he speaks of having some thoughts of reading\r\ndivinity with Henslow.\r\n\r\n[The greater number of the following letters are addressed by my father\r\nto his cousin, William Darwin Fox. Mr. Fox's relationship to my father\r\nis shown in the pedigree given in Chapter I. The degree of kinship\r\nappears to have remained a problem to my father, as he signs himself in\r\none letter \"cousin/n to the power 2.\" Their friendship was, in fact, due\r\nto their being undergraduates together. My father's letters show clearly\r\nenough how genuine the friendship was. In after years, distance, large\r\nfamilies, and ill-health on both sides, checked the intercourse; but a\r\nwarm feeling of friendship remained. The correspondence was never quite\r\ndropped and continued till Mr. Fox's death in 1880. Mr. Fox took orders,\r\nand worked as a country clergyman until forced by ill-health to leave\r\nhis living in Delamare Forest. His love of natural history remained\r\nstrong, and he became a skilled fancier of many kinds of birds, etc.\r\nThe index to 'Animals and Plants,' and my father's later correspondence,\r\nshow how much help he received from his old College friend.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.M. HERBERT. Saturday Evening [September 14, 1828].\r\n(The postmark being Derby seems to show that the letter was written from\r\nhis cousin, W.D. Fox's house, Osmaston, near Derby.)\r\n\r\nMy dear old Cherbury,\r\n\r\nI am about to fulfil my promise of writing to you, but I am sorry to add\r\nthere is a very selfish motive at the bottom. I am going to ask you\r\na great favour, and you cannot imagine how much you will oblige me by\r\nprocuring some more specimens of some insects which I dare say I can\r\ndescribe. In the first place, I must inform you that I have taken\r\nsome of the rarest of the British Insects, and their being found near\r\nBarmouth, is quite unknown to the Entomological world: I think I shall\r\nwrite and inform some of the crack entomologists.\r\n\r\nBut now for business. SEVERAL more specimens, if you can procure them\r\nwithout much trouble, of the following insects:--The violet-black\r\ncoloured beetle, found on Craig Storm (The top of the hill immediately\r\nbehind Barmouth was called Craig-Storm, a hybrid Cambro-English word.),\r\nunder stones, also a large smooth black one very like it; a bluish\r\nmetallic-coloured dung-beetle, which is VERY common on the hill-sides;\r\nalso, if you WOULD be so very kind as to cross the ferry, and you\r\nwill find a great number under the stones on the waste land of a long,\r\nsmooth, jet-black beetle (a great many of these); also, in the same\r\nsituation, a very small pinkish insect, with black spots, with a curved\r\nthorax projecting beyond the head; also, upon the marshy land over the\r\nferry, near the sea, under old sea-weed, stones, etc., you will find a\r\nsmall yellowish transparent beetle, with two or four blackish marks on\r\nthe back. Under these stones there are two sorts, one much darker than\r\nthe other; the lighter-coloured is that which I want. These last two\r\ninsects are EXCESSIVELY RARE, and you will really EXTREMELY oblige me by\r\ntaking all this trouble pretty soon; remember me most kindly to Butler,\r\ntell him of my success, and I dare say both of you will easily recognise\r\nthese insects. I hope his caterpillars go on well. I think many of the\r\nChrysalises are well worth keeping. I really am quite ashamed [of] so\r\nlong a letter all about my own concerns; but do return good for evil,\r\nand send me a long account of all your proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn the first week I killed seventy-five head of game--a very\r\ncontemptible number--but there are very few birds. I killed, however, a\r\nbrace of black game. Since then I have been staying at the Fox's, near\r\nDerby; it is a very pleasant house, and the music meeting went off very\r\nwell. I want to hear how Yates likes his gun, and what use he has made\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nIf the bottle is not large you can buy another for me, and when you pass\r\nthrough Shrewsbury you can leave these treasures, and I hope, if you\r\npossibly can, you will stay a day or two with me, as I hope I need\r\nnot say how glad I shall be to see you again. Fox remarked what deuced\r\ngood-natured fellows your friends at Barmouth must be; and if I did not\r\nknow how you and Butler were so, I would not think of giving you so much\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Herbert, Yours, most sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\nRemember me to all friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the following January we find him looking forward with pleasure to\r\nthe beginning of another year of his Cambridge life: he writes to Fox--\r\n\r\n\"I waited till to-day for the chance of a letter, but I will wait no\r\nlonger. I must most sincerely and cordially congratulate you on\r\nhaving finished all your labours. I think your place a VERY GOOD one\r\nconsidering by how much you have beaten many men who had the start of\r\nyou in reading. I do so wish I were now in Cambridge (a very selfish\r\nwish, however, as I was not with you in all your troubles and misery),\r\nto join in all the glory and happiness, which dangers gone by can give.\r\nHow we would talk, walk, and entomologise! Sappho should be the best of\r\nbitches, and Dash, of dogs: then should be 'peace on earth, good will to\r\nmen,'--which, by the way, I always think the most perfect description of\r\nhappiness that words can give.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Cambridge, Thursday [February 26, 1829].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived here on Tuesday I found to my great grief and surprise, a\r\nletter on my table which I had written to you about a fortnight ago, the\r\nstupid porter never took the trouble of getting the letter forwarded. I\r\nsuppose you have been abusing me for a most ungrateful wretch; but I am\r\nsure you will pity me now, as nothing is so vexatious as having written\r\na letter in vain.\r\n\r\nLast Thursday I left Shrewsbury for London, and stayed there till\r\nTuesday, on which I came down here by the 'Times.' The first two days\r\nI spent entirely with Mr. Hope (Founder of the Chair of Zoology at\r\nOxford.), and did little else but talk about and look at insects; his\r\ncollection is most magnificent, and he himself is the most generous of\r\nentomologists; he has given me about 160 new species, and actually often\r\nwanted to give me the rarest insects of which he had only two specimens.\r\nHe made many civil speeches, and hoped you will call on him some\r\ntime with me, whenever we should happen to be in London. He greatly\r\ncompliments our exertions in Entomology, and says we have taken a\r\nwonderfully great number of good insects. On Sunday I spent the day with\r\nHolland, who lent me a horse to ride in the Park with.\r\n\r\nOn Monday evening I drank tea with Stephens (J.F. Stephens, author of 'A\r\nManual of British Coleoptera,' 1839, and other works.); his cabinet is\r\nmore magnificent than the most zealous entomologist could dream of; he\r\nappears to be a very good-humoured pleasant little man. Whilst in town I\r\nwent to the Royal Institution, Linnean Society, and Zoological Gardens,\r\nand many other places where naturalists are gregarious. If you had been\r\nwith me, I think London would be a very delightful place; as things\r\nwere, it was much pleasanter than I could have supposed such a dreary\r\nwilderness of houses to be.\r\n\r\nI shot whilst in Shrewsbury a Dundiver (female Goosander, as I suppose\r\nyou know). Shaw has stuffed it, and when I have an opportunity I will\r\nsend it to Osmaston. There have been shot also five Waxen Chatterers,\r\nthree of which Shaw has for sale; would you like to purchase a specimen?\r\nI have not yet thanked you for your last very long and agreeable letter.\r\nIt would have been still more agreeable had it contained the joyful\r\nintelligence that you were coming up here; my two solitary breakfasts\r\nhave already made me aware how very very much I shall miss you.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nBelieve me, My dear old Fox, Most sincerely yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Later on in the Lent term he writes to Fox:--\r\n\r\n\"I am leading a quiet everyday sort of a life; a little of Gibbon's\r\nHistory in the morning, and a good deal of \"Van John\" in the evening;\r\nthis, with an occasional ride with Simcox and constitutional with\r\nWhitley, makes up the regular routine of my days. I see a good deal both\r\nof Herbert and Whitley, and the more I see of them increases every day\r\nthe respect I have for their excellent understandings and dispositions.\r\nThey have been giving some very gay parties, nearly sixty men there both\r\nevenings.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Christ's College [Cambridge], April 1\r\n[1829].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nIn your letter to Holden you are pleased to observe \"that of all the\r\nblackguards you ever met with I am the greatest.\" Upon this observation\r\nI shall make no remarks, excepting that I must give you all due credit\r\nfor acting on it most rigidly. And now I should like to know in what one\r\nparticular are you less of a blackguard than I am? You idle old wretch,\r\nwhy have you not answered my last letter, which I am sure I forwarded to\r\nClifton nearly three weeks ago? If I was not really very anxious to hear\r\nwhat you are doing, I should have allowed you to remain till you thought\r\nit worth while to treat me like a gentleman. And now having vented my\r\nspleen in scolding you, and having told you, what you must know, how\r\nvery much and how anxiously I want to hear how you and your family are\r\ngetting on at Clifton, the purport of this letter is finished. If you\r\ndid but know how often I think of you, and how often I regret your\r\nabsence, I am sure I should have heard from you long enough ago.\r\n\r\nI find Cambridge rather stupid, and as I know scarcely any one that\r\nwalks, and this joined with my lips not being quite so well, has reduced\r\nme to a sort of hybernation... I have caught Mr. Harbour letting --\r\nhave the first pick of the beetles; accordingly we have made our final\r\nadieus, my part in the affecting scene consisted in telling him he was a\r\nd--d rascal, and signifying I should kick him down the stairs if ever\r\nhe appeared in my rooms again. It seemed altogether mightily to\r\nsurprise the young gentleman. I have no news to tell you; indeed, when\r\na correspondence has been broken off like ours has been, it is difficult\r\nto make the first start again. Last night there was a terrible fire at\r\nLinton, eleven miles from Cambridge. Seeing the reflection so plainly in\r\nthe sky, Hall, Woodyeare, Turner, and myself thought we would ride and\r\nsee it. We set out at half-past nine, and rode like incarnate devils\r\nthere, and did not return till two in the morning. Altogether it was a\r\nmost awful sight. I cannot conclude without telling you, that of all the\r\nblackguards I ever met with, you are the greatest and the best.\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. [Cambridge, Thursday, April 23, 1829.]\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nI have delayed answering your last letter for these few days, as I\r\nthought that under such melancholy circumstances my writing to you would\r\nbe probably only giving you trouble. This morning I received a letter\r\nfrom Catherine informing me of that event (The death of Fox's sister,\r\nMrs. Bristowe.), which, indeed, from your letter, I had hardly dared to\r\nhope would have happened otherwise. I feel most sincerely and deeply for\r\nyou and all your family; but at the same time, as far as any one can,\r\nby his own good principles and religion, be supported under such a\r\nmisfortune, you, I am assured, will know where to look for such support.\r\nAnd after so pure and holy a comfort as the Bible affords, I am equally\r\nassured how useless the sympathy of all friends must appear, although\r\nit be as heartfelt and sincere, as I hope you believe me capable of\r\nfeeling. At such a time of deep distress I will say nothing more,\r\nexcepting that I trust your father and Mrs. Fox bear this blow as well\r\nas, under such circumstances, can be hoped for.\r\n\r\nI am afraid it will be a long time, my dear Fox, before we meet; till\r\nthen, believe me at all times,\r\n\r\nYours most affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Shrewsbury, Friday [July 4, 1829].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nI should have written to you before only that whilst our expedition\r\nlasted I was too much engaged, and the conclusion was so unfortunate,\r\nthat I was too unhappy to write to you till this week's quiet at home.\r\nThe thoughts of Woodhouse next week has at last given me courage to\r\nrelate my unfortunate case.\r\n\r\nI started from this place about a fortnight ago to take an entomological\r\ntrip with Mr. Hope through all North Wales; and Barmouth was our first\r\ndestination. The two first days I went on pretty well, taking several\r\ngood insects; but for the rest of that week my lips became suddenly so\r\nbad (Probably with eczema, from which he often suffered.), and I myself\r\nnot very well, that I was unable to leave the room, and on the Monday I\r\nretreated with grief and sorrow back again to Shrewsbury. The first two\r\ndays I took some good insects...But the days that I was unable to go\r\nout, Mr. Hope did wonders...and to-day I have received another parcel\r\nof insects from him, such Colymbetes, such Carabi, and such magnificent\r\nElaters (two species of the bright scarlet sort). I am sure you will\r\nproperly sympathise with my unfortunate situation: I am determined I\r\nwill go over the same ground that he does before autumn comes, and if\r\nworking hard will procure insects I will bring home a glorious\r\nstock....\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox, Yours most sincerely, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Shrewsbury, July 18, 1829.\r\n\r\nI am going to Maer next week in order to entomologise, and shall\r\nstay there a week, and for the rest of this summer I intend to lead a\r\nperfectly idle and wandering life...You see I am much in the same state\r\nthat you are, with this difference, you make good resolutions and never\r\nkeep them; I never make them, so cannot keep them; it is all very well\r\nwriting in this manner, but I must read for my Little-go. Graham smiled\r\nand bowed so very civilly, when he told me that he was one of the\r\nsix appointed to make the examination stricter, and that they were\r\ndetermined this would make it a very different thing from any previous\r\nexamination, that from all this I am sure it will be the very devil to\r\npay amongst all idle men and entomologists. Erasmus, we expect home in\r\na few weeks' time: he intends passing next winter in Paris. Be sure you\r\norder the two lists of insects published by Stephens, one printed on\r\nboth sides, and the other only on one; you will find them very useful in\r\nmany points of view.\r\n\r\nDear old Fox, yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Christ's College, Thursday [October 16,\r\n1829].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nI am afraid you will be very angry with me for not having written during\r\nthe Music Meeting, but really I was worked so hard that I had no time; I\r\narrived here on Monday and found my rooms in dreadful confusion, as\r\nthey have been taking up the floor, and you may suppose that I have had\r\nplenty to do for these two days. The Music Meeting (At Birmingham.) was\r\nthe most glorious thing I ever experienced; and as for Malibran, words\r\ncannot praise her enough, she is quite the most charming person I\r\never saw. We had extracts out of several of the best operas, acted in\r\ncharacter, and you cannot imagine how very superior it made the concerts\r\nto any I ever heard before. J. de Begnis (De Begnis's Christian name\r\nwas Giuseppe.) acted 'Il Fanatico' in character; being dressed up an\r\nextraordinary figure gives a much greater effect to his acting. He kept\r\nthe whole theatre in roars of laughter. I liked Madame Blasis very much,\r\nbut nothing will do after Malibran, who sung some comic songs, and [a]\r\nperson's heart must have been made of stone not to have lost it to her.\r\nI lodged very near the Wedgwoods, and lived entirely with them, which\r\nwas very pleasant, and had you been there it would have been quite\r\nperfect. It knocked me up most dreadfully, and I will never attempt\r\nagain to do two things the same day.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. [Cambridge] Thursday [March, 1830].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nI am through my Little-Go!!! I am too much exalted to humble myself by\r\napologising for not having written before. But I assure you before I\r\nwent in, and when my nerves were in a shattered and weak condition,\r\nyour injured person often rose before my eyes and taunted me with my\r\nidleness. But I am through, through, through. I could write the whole\r\nsheet full with this delightful word. I went in yesterday, and have just\r\nheard the joyful news. I shall not know for a week which class I am in.\r\nThe whole examination is carried on in a different system. It has one\r\ngrand advantage--being over in one day. They are rather strict, and ask\r\na wonderful number of questions.\r\n\r\nAnd now I want to know something about your plans; of course you intend\r\ncoming up here: what fun we will have together; what beetles we will\r\ncatch; it will do my heart good to go once more together to some of our\r\nold haunts. I have two very promising pupils in Entomology, and we will\r\nmake regular campaigns into the Fens. Heaven protect the beetles and\r\nMr. Jenyns, for we won't leave him a pair in the whole country. My new\r\nCabinet is come down, and a gay little affair it is.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the time--I think I shall go for a few days to town to hear\r\nan opera and see Mr. Hope; not to mention my brother also, whom I should\r\nhave no objection to see. If I go pretty soon, you can come afterwards,\r\nbut if you will settle your plans definitely, I will arrange mine,\r\nso send me a letter by return of post. And I charge you let it be\r\nfavourable--that is to say, come directly. Holden has been ordained,\r\nand drove the Coach out on the Monday. I do not think he is looking very\r\nwell. Chapman wants you and myself to pay him a visit when you come up,\r\nand begs to be remembered to you. You must excuse this short letter,\r\nas I have no end more to send off by this day's post. I long to see you\r\nagain, and till then,\r\n\r\nMy dear good old Fox, Yours most sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In August he was in North Wales and wrote to Fox:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been intending to write every hour for the last fortnight, but\r\nREALLY have had no time. I left Shrewsbury this day fortnight ago, and\r\nhave since that time been working from morning to night in catching fish\r\nor beetles. This is literally the first idle day I have had to myself;\r\nfor on the rainy days I go fishing, on the good ones entomologising. You\r\nmay recollect that for the fortnight previous to all this, you told me\r\nnot to write, so that I hope I have made out some sort of defence for\r\nnot having sooner answered your two long and very agreeable letters.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. [Cambridge, November 5, 1830.]\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nI have so little time at present, and am so disgusted by reading that\r\nI have not the heart to write to anybody. I have only written once home\r\nsince I came up. This must excuse me for not having answered your three\r\nletters, for which I am really very much obliged...\r\n\r\nI have not stuck an insect this term, and scarcely opened a case. If\r\nI had time I would have sent you the insects which I have so long\r\npromised; but really I have not spirits or time to do anything. Reading\r\nmakes me quite desperate; the plague of getting up all my subjects is\r\nnext thing to intolerable. Henslow is my tutor, and a most ADMIRABLE one\r\nhe makes; the hour with him is the pleasantest in the whole day. I think\r\nhe is quite the most perfect man I ever met with. I have been to some\r\nvery pleasant parties there this term. His good-nature is unbounded.\r\n\r\nI am sure you will be sorry to hear poor old Whitley's father is dead.\r\nIn a worldly point of view it is of great consequence to him, as it will\r\nprevent him going to the Bar for some time.--(Be sure answer this:) What\r\ndid you pay for the iron hoop you had made in Shrewsbury? Because I\r\ndo not mean to pay the whole of the Cambridge man's bill. You need not\r\ntrouble yourself about the Phallus, as I have bought up both species. I\r\nhave heard men say that Henslow has some curious religious opinions. I\r\nnever perceived anything of it, have you? I am very glad to hear, after\r\nall your delays, you have heard of a curacy where you may read all the\r\ncommandments without endangering your throat. I am also still more glad\r\nto hear that your mother continues steadily to improve. I do trust that\r\nyou will have no further cause for uneasiness. With every wish for your\r\nhappiness, my dear old Fox,\r\n\r\nBelieve me yours most sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Cambridge, Sunday, January 23, 1831.\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nI do hope you will excuse my not writing before I took my degree. I felt\r\na quite inexplicable aversion to write to anybody. But now I do most\r\nheartily congratulate you upon passing your examination, and hope you\r\nfind your curacy comfortable. If it is my last shilling (I have not\r\nmany), I will come and pay you a visit.\r\n\r\nI do not know why the degree should make one so miserable, both before\r\nand afterwards. I recollect you were sufficiently wretched before, and\r\nI can assure [you] I am now, and what makes it the more ridiculous is, I\r\nknow not what about. I believe it is a beautiful provision of nature to\r\nmake one regret the less leaving so pleasant a place as Cambridge; and\r\namongst all its pleasures--I say it for once and for all--none so great\r\nas my friendship with you. I sent you a newspaper yesterday, in which\r\nyou will see what a good place [10th] I have got in the Poll. As for\r\nChrist's, did you ever see such a college for producing Captains and\r\nApostles? (The \"Captain\" is at the head of the \"Poll\": the \"Apostles\"\r\nare the last twelve in the Mathematical Tripos.) There are no men either\r\nat Emmanuel or Christ's plucked. Cameron is gulfed, together with other\r\nthree Trinity scholars! My plans are not at all settled. I think I shall\r\nkeep this term, and then go and economise at Shrewsbury, return and take\r\nmy degree.\r\n\r\nA man may be excused for writing so much about himself when he has\r\njust passed the examination; so you must excuse [me]. And on the same\r\nprinciple do you write a letter brimful of yourself and plans. I want to\r\nknow something about your examination. Tell me about the state of your\r\nnerves; what books you got up, and how perfect. I take an interest\r\nabout that sort of thing, as the time will come when I must suffer. Your\r\ntutor, Thompson, begged to be remembered to you, and so does Whitley.\r\nIf you will answer this, I will send as many stupid answers as you can\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, dear Fox, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.V. -- THE APPOINTMENT TO THE 'BEAGLE.'\r\n\r\n[In a letter addressed to Captain Fitz-Roy, before the \"Beagle\" sailed,\r\nmy father wrote, \"What a glorious day the 4th of November (The \"Beagle\"\r\ndid not however make her final and successful start until December 27.)\r\nwill be to me--my second life will then commence, and it shall be as a\r\nbirthday for the rest of my life.\"]\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which led to this second birth--so much more important\r\nthan my father then imagined--are connected with his Cambridge life, but\r\nmay be more appropriately told in the present chapter. Foremost in the\r\nchain of circumstances which lead to his appointment to the \"Beagle\",\r\nwas my father's friendship with Professor Henslow. He wrote in a\r\npocket-book or diary, which contain a brief record of dates, etc.,\r\nthroughout his life:--\r\n\r\n\"1831. CHRISTMAS.--Passed my examination for B.A. degree and kept the\r\ntwo following terms.\r\n\r\n\"During these months lived much with Professor Henslow, often dining\r\nwith him and walking with him; became slightly acquainted with several\r\nof the learned men in Cambridge, which much quickened the zeal which\r\ndinner parties and hunting had not destroyed.\r\n\r\n\"In the spring paid Mr. Dawes a visit with Ramsay and Kirby, and talked\r\nover an excursion to Teneriffe. In the spring Henslow persuaded me\r\nto think of Geology, and introduced me to Sedgwick. During Midsummer\r\ngeologised a little in Shropshire.\r\n\r\n\"AUGUST.--Went on Geological tour (Mentioned by Sedgwick in his preface\r\nto Salter's 'Catalogue of Cambrian and Silurian Fossils,' 1873.) by\r\nLlangollen, Ruthin, Conway, Bangor, and Capel Curig, where I left\r\nProfessor Sedgwick, and crossed the mountain to Barmouth.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Fox (May, 1831), my father writes:--\"I am very busy...and\r\nsee a great deal of Henslow, whom I do not know whether I love or\r\nrespect most.\" His feeling for this admirable man is finely expressed\r\nin a letter which he wrote to Rev. L. Blomefield (then Rev. L. Jenyns),\r\nwhen the latter was engaged in his 'Memoir of Professor Henslow'\r\n(published 1862). The passage ('Memoir of the Rev. John Stevens Henslow,\r\nM.A.,' by the Rev. Leonard Jenyns. 8vo. London, 1862, page 51.) has been\r\nmade use of in the first of the memorial notices written for 'Nature,'\r\nand Mr. Romanes points out that my father, \"while describing the\r\ncharacter of another, is unconsciously giving a most accurate\r\ndescription of his own\":--\r\n\r\n\"I went to Cambridge early in the year 1828, and soon became acquainted,\r\nthrough some of my brother entomologists, with Professor Henslow, for\r\nall who cared for any branch of natural history were equally encouraged\r\nby him. Nothing could be more simple, cordial, and unpretending than the\r\nencouragement which he afforded to all young naturalists. I soon became\r\nintimate with him, for he had a remarkable power of making the young\r\nfeel completely at ease with him; though we were all awe-struck with the\r\namount of his knowledge. Before I saw him, I heard one young man sum up\r\nhis attainments by simply saying that he knew everything. When I reflect\r\nhow immediately we felt at perfect ease with a man older, and in every\r\nway so immensely our superior, I think it was as much owing to the\r\ntransparent sincerity of his character as to his kindness of heart; and,\r\nperhaps, even still more, to a highly remarkable absence in him of all\r\nself-consciousness. One perceived at once that he never thought of his\r\nown varied knowledge or clear intellect, but solely on the subject in\r\nhand. Another charm, which must have struck every one, was that his\r\nmanner to old and distinguished persons and to the youngest student was\r\nexactly the same: and to all he showed the same winning courtesy. He\r\nwould receive with interest the most trifling observation in any branch\r\nof natural history; and however absurd a blunder one might make,\r\nhe pointed it out so clearly and kindly, that one left him no way\r\ndisheartened, but only determined to be more accurate the next time. In\r\nshort, no man could be better formed to win the entire confidence of the\r\nyoung, and to encourage them in their pursuits.\r\n\r\n\"His lectures on Botany were universally popular, and as clear as\r\ndaylight. So popular were they, that several of the older members of\r\nthe University attended successive courses. Once every week he kept open\r\nhouse in the evening, and all who cared for natural history attended\r\nthese parties, which, by thus favouring inter-communication, did the\r\nsame good in Cambridge, in a very pleasant manner, as the Scientific\r\nSocieties do in London. At these parties many of the most distinguished\r\nmembers of the University occasionally attended; and when only a few\r\nwere present, I have listened to the great men of those days, conversing\r\non all sorts of subjects, with the most varied and brilliant powers.\r\nThis was no small advantage to some of the younger men, as it stimulated\r\ntheir mental activity and ambition. Two or three times in each session\r\nhe took excursions with his botanical class; either a long walk to the\r\nhabitat of some rare plant, or in a barge down the river to the fens, or\r\nin coaches to some more distant place, as to Gamlingay, to see the wild\r\nlily of the valley, and to catch on the heath the rare natter-jack.\r\nThese excursions have left a delightful impression on my mind. He was,\r\non such occasions, in as good spirits as a boy, and laughed as\r\nheartily as a boy at the misadventures of those who chased the splendid\r\nswallow-tail butterflies across the broken and treacherous fens. He used\r\nto pause every now and then to lecture on some plant or other object;\r\nand something he could tell us on every insect, shell, or fossil\r\ncollected, for he had attended to every branch of natural history. After\r\nour day's work we used to dine at some inn or house, and most jovial we\r\nthen were. I believe all who joined these excursions will agree with me\r\nthat they have left an enduring impression of delight on our minds.\r\n\r\n\"As time passed on at Cambridge I became very intimate with Professor\r\nHenslow, and his kindness was unbounded; he continually asked me to his\r\nhouse, and allowed me to accompany him in his walks. He talked on all\r\nsubjects, including his deep sense of religion, and was entirely open. I\r\nown more than I can express to this excellent man...\r\n\r\n\"During the years when I associated so much with Professor Henslow, I\r\nnever once saw his temper even ruffled. He never took an ill-natured\r\nview of any one's character, though very far from blind to the foibles\r\nof others. It always struck me that his mind could not be even touched\r\nby any paltry feeling of vanity, envy, or jealousy. With all this\r\nequability of temper and remarkable benevolence, there was no insipidity\r\nof character. A man must have been blind not to have perceived that\r\nbeneath this placid exterior there was a vigorous and determined will.\r\nWhen principle came into play, no power on earth could have turned him\r\none hair's-breadth...\r\n\r\n\"Reflecting over his character with gratitude and reverence, his\r\nmoral attributes rise, as they should do in the highest character, in\r\npre-eminence over his intellect.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Rev. L. Blomefield (Jenyns), May 24, 1862, my father\r\nwrote with the same feelings that he had expressed in his letters thirty\r\nyears before:--\r\n\r\n\"I thank you most sincerely for your kind present of your Memoir of\r\nHenslow. I have read about half, and it has interested me much. I do not\r\nthink that I could have venerated him more than I did; but your book has\r\neven exalted his character in my eyes. From turning over the pages of\r\nthe latter half, I should think your account would be invaluable to any\r\nclergyman who wished to follow poor dear Henslow's noble example. What\r\nan admirable man he was.\"\r\n\r\nThe geological work mentioned in the quotation from my father's\r\npocket-book was doubtless of importance as giving him some practical\r\nexperience, and perhaps of more importance in helping to give him some\r\nconfidence in himself. In July of the same year, 1831, he was \"working\r\nlike a tiger\" at Geology, and trying to make a map of Shropshire, but\r\nnot finding it \"as easy as I expected.\"\r\n\r\nIn writing to Henslow about the same time, he gives some account of his\r\nwork:--\r\n\r\n\"I should have written to you some time ago, only I was determined\r\nto wait for the clinometer, and I am very glad to say I think it\r\nwill answer admirably. I put all the tables in my bedroom at every\r\nconceivable angle and direction. I will venture to say I have measured\r\nthem as accurately as any geologist going could do...I have been working\r\nat so many things that I have not got on much with geology. I suspect\r\nthe first expedition I take, clinometer and hammer in hand, will send me\r\nback very little wiser and a good deal more puzzled than when I started.\r\nAs yet I have only indulged in hypotheses, but they are such powerful\r\nones that I suppose, if they were put into action for but one day, the\r\nworld would come to an end.\"\r\n\r\nHe was evidently most keen to get to work with Sedgwick, for he wrote\r\nto Henslow: \"I have not heard from Professor Sedgwick, so I am afraid\r\nhe will not pay the Severn formations a visit. I hope and trust you did\r\nyour best to urge him.\"\r\n\r\nMy father has given in his Recollections some account of this Tour.\r\n\r\nThere too we read of the projected excursion to the Canaries, of which\r\nslight mention occurs in letters to Fox and Henslow.\r\n\r\nIn April 1831 he writes to Fox: \"At present I talk, think, and dream of\r\na scheme I have almost hatched of going to the Canary Islands. I\r\nhave long had a wish of seeing tropical scenery and vegetation, and,\r\naccording to Humboldt, Teneriffe is a very pretty specimen.\" And again\r\nin May: \"As for my Canary scheme, it is rash of you to ask questions;\r\nmy other friends most sincerely wish me there, I plague them so with\r\ntalking about tropical scenery, etc. Eyton will go next summer, and I am\r\nlearning Spanish.\"\r\n\r\nLater on in the summer the scheme took more definite form, and the date\r\nseems to have been fixed for June, 1832. He got information in London\r\nabout passage-money, and in July was working at Spanish and calling\r\nFox \"un grandisimo lebron,\" in proof of his knowledge of the language;\r\nwhich, however, he found \"intensely stupid.\" But even then he seems\r\nto have had some doubts about his companions' zeal, for he writes to\r\nHenslow (July 27, 1831): \"I hope you continue to fan your Canary ardour.\r\nI read and re-read Humboldt; do you do the same? I am sure nothing will\r\nprevent us seeing the Great Dragon Tree.\"\r\n\r\nGeological work and Teneriffe dreams carried him through the summer,\r\ntill on returning from Barmouth for the sacred 1st of September, he\r\nreceived the offer of appointment as Naturalist to the \"Beagle\".\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the pocket-book will be a help in reading the\r\nletters:--\r\n\r\n\"Returned to Shrewsbury at end of August. Refused offer of voyage.\r\n\r\n\"September.--Went to Maer, returned with Uncle Jos. to Shrewsbury,\r\nthence to Cambridge. London.\r\n\r\n\"11th.--Went with Captain Fitz-Roy in steamer to Plymouth to see the\r\n\"Beagle\".\r\n\r\n\"22nd.--Returned to Shrewsbury, passing through Cambridge.\r\n\r\n\"October 2nd.--Took leave of my home. Stayed in London.\r\n\r\n\"24th--Reached Plymouth.\r\n\r\n\"October and November.--These months very miserable.\r\n\r\n\"December 10th.--Sailed, but were obliged to put back.\r\n\r\n\"21st.--Put to sea again, and were driven back.\r\n\r\n\"27th.--Sailed from England on our Circumnavigation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE PEACOCK (Formerly Dean of Ely, and Lowndean Professor of\r\nAstronomy at Cambridge.) TO J.S. HENSLOW. 7 Suffolk Street, Pall Mall\r\nEast. [1831.]\r\n\r\nMy dear Henslow,\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitz-Roy is going out to survey the southern coast of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego, and afterwards to visit many of the South Sea Islands, and to\r\nreturn by the Indian Archipelago. The vessel is fitted out expressly\r\nfor scientific purposes, combined with the survey; it will furnish,\r\ntherefore, a rare opportunity for a naturalist, and it would be a great\r\nmisfortune that it should be lost.\r\n\r\nAn offer has been made to me to recommend a proper person to go out as\r\na naturalist with this expedition; he will be treated with every\r\nconsideration. The Captain is a young man of very pleasing manners (a\r\nnephew of the Duke of Grafton), of great zeal in his profession, and who\r\nis very highly spoken of; if Leonard Jenyns could go, what treasures he\r\nmight bring home with him, as the ship would be placed at his disposal\r\nwhenever his inquiries made it necessary or desirable. In the absence\r\nof so accomplished a naturalist, is there any person whom you could\r\nstrongly recommend? he must be such a person as would do credit to our\r\nrecommendation. Do think of this subject, it would be a serious loss to\r\nthe cause of natural science if this fine opportunity was lost....\r\n\r\nThe ship sails about the end of September.\r\n\r\nWrite immediately, and tell me what can be done.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, My dear Henslow, Most truly yours, GEORGE PEACOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ.S. HENSLOW TO C. DARWIN. Cambridge, August 24, 1831.\r\n\r\nMy dear Darwin,\r\n\r\nBefore I enter upon the immediate business of this letter, let us\r\ncondole together upon the loss of our inestimable friend poor Ramsay, of\r\nwhose death you have undoubtedly heard long before this.\r\n\r\nI will not now dwell upon this painful subject, as I shall hope to see\r\nyou shortly, fully expecting that you will eagerly catch at the offer\r\nwhich is likely to be made you of a trip to Tierra del Fuego, and home\r\nby the East Indies. I have been asked by Peacock, who will read and\r\nforward this to you from London, to recommend him a Naturalist as\r\ncompanion to Captain Fitz-Roy, employed by Government to survey the\r\nsouthern extremity of America. I have stated that I consider you to be\r\nthe best qualified person I know of who is likely to undertake such a\r\nsituation. I state this not in the supposition of your being a FINISHED\r\nnaturalist, but as amply qualified for collecting, observing, and\r\nnoting, anything worthy to be noted in Natural History. Peacock has the\r\nappointment at his disposal, and if he cannot find a man willing to\r\ntake the office, the opportunity will probably be lost. Captain Fitz-Roy\r\nwants a man (I understand) more as a companion than a mere collector,\r\nand would not take any one, however good a naturalist, who was not\r\nrecommended to him likewise as a GENTLEMAN. Particulars of salary, etc.,\r\nI know nothing. The voyage is to last two years, and if you take plenty\r\nof books with you, anything you please may be done. You will have ample\r\nopportunities at command. In short, I suppose there never was a finer\r\nchance for a man of zeal and spirit; Captain Fitz-Roy is a young man.\r\nWhat I wish you to do is instantly to come and consult with Peacock (at\r\nNo. 7 Suffolk Street, Pall Mall East, or else at the University Club),\r\nand learn further particulars. Don't put on any modest doubts or fears\r\nabout your disqualifications, for I assure you I think you are the very\r\nman they are in search of; so conceive yourself to be tapped on the\r\nshoulder by your bum-bailiff and affectionate friend,\r\n\r\nJ.S. HENSLOW.\r\n\r\nThe expedition is to sail on 25th September (at earliest), so there is\r\nno time to be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nG. PEACOCK TO C. DARWIN. [1831.]\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI received Henslow's letter last night too late to forward it to you by\r\nthe post; a circumstance which I do not regret, as it has given me\r\nan opportunity of seeing Captain Beaufort at the Admiralty (the\r\nHydrographer), and of stating to him the offer which I have to make to\r\nyou. He entirely approves of it, and you may consider the situation as\r\nat your absolute disposal. I trust that you will accept it, as it is\r\nan opportunity which should not be lost, and I look forward with great\r\ninterest to the benefit which our collections of Natural History may\r\nreceive from your labours.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances are these;--\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitz-Roy (a nephew of the Duke of Grafton) sails at the end of\r\nSeptember, in a ship to survey, in the first instance, the South Coast\r\nof Tierra del Fuego, afterwards to visit the South Sea Islands, and to\r\nreturn by the Indian Archipelago to England. The expedition is entirely\r\nfor scientific purposes, and the ship will generally wait your\r\nleisure for researches in Natural History, etc. Captain Fitz-Roy is a\r\npublic-spirited and zealous officer, of delightful manners, and greatly\r\nbeloved by all his brother officers. He went with Captain Beechey (For\r\n'Beechey' read 'King.' I do not find the name Fitz-Roy in the list of\r\nBeechey's officers. The Fuegians were brought back from Captain King's\r\nvoyage.), and spent 1500 pounds in bringing over and educating at his\r\nown charge three natives of Patagonia. He engages at his own expense an\r\nartist at 200 pounds a year to go with him. You may be sure, therefore,\r\nof having a very pleasant companion, who will enter heartily into all\r\nyour views.\r\n\r\nThe ship sails about the end of September, and you must lose no time\r\nin making known your acceptance to Captain Beaufort, Admiralty\r\nHydrographer. I have had a good deal of correspondence about this matter\r\n[with Henslow?], who feels, in common with myself, the greatest anxiety\r\nthat you should go. I hope that no other arrangements are likely to\r\ninterfere with it....\r\n\r\nThe Admiralty are not disposed to give a salary, though they will\r\nfurnish you with an official appointment, and every accommodation. If a\r\nsalary should be required, however, I am inclined to think that it would\r\nbe granted.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Sir, Very truly yours, GEORGE PEACOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Shrewsbury, Tuesday [August 30?, 1831].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nMr. Peacock's letter arrived on Saturday, and I received it late\r\nyesterday evening. As far as my own mind is concerned, I should, I think\r\nCERTAINLY, most gladly have accepted the opportunity which you so kindly\r\nhave offered me. But my father, although he does not decidedly refuse\r\nme, gives such strong advice against going, that I should not be\r\ncomfortable if I did not follow it.\r\n\r\nMy father's objections are these: the unfitting me to settle down as a\r\nClergyman, my little habit of seafaring, THE SHORTNESS OF THE TIME, and\r\nthe chance of my not suiting Captain Fitz-Roy. It is certainly a very\r\nserious objection, the very short time for all my preparations, as not\r\nonly body but mind wants making up for such an undertaking. But if it\r\nhad not been for my father I would have taken all risks. What was the\r\nreason that a Naturalist was not long ago fixed upon? I am very much\r\nobliged for the trouble you have had about it; there certainly could not\r\nhave been a better opportunity....\r\n\r\nMy trip with Sedgwick answered most perfectly. I did not hear of poor\r\nMr. Ramsay's loss till a few days before your letter. I have been\r\nlucky hitherto in never losing any person for whom I had any esteem or\r\naffection. My acquaintance, although very short, was sufficient to give\r\nme those feelings in a great degree. I can hardly make myself believe he\r\nis no more. He was the finest character I ever knew.\r\n\r\nYours most sincerely, My dear Sir, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI have written to Mr. Peacock, and I mentioned that I have asked you to\r\nsend one line in the chance of his not getting my letter. I have also\r\nasked him to communicate with Captain Fitz-Roy. Even if I was to go, my\r\nfather disliking would take away all energy, and I should want a good\r\nstock of that. Again I must thank you, it adds a little to the heavy but\r\npleasant load of gratitude which I owe to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO R.W. DARWIN. [Maer] August 31, [1831].\r\n\r\nMy dear Father,\r\n\r\nI am afraid I am going to make you again very uncomfortable. But,\r\nupon consideration, I think you will excuse me once again, stating\r\nmy opinions on the offer of the voyage. My excuse and reason is the\r\ndifferent way all the Wedgwoods view the subject from what you and my\r\nsisters do.\r\n\r\nI have given Uncle Jos (Josiah Wedgwood.) what I fervently trust is an\r\naccurate and full list of your objections, and he is kind enough to give\r\nhis opinions on all. The list and his answers will be enclosed. But may\r\nI beg of you one favour, it will be doing me the greatest kindness, if\r\nyou will send me a decided answer, yes or no? If the latter, I should be\r\nmost ungrateful if I did not implicitly yield to your better judgment,\r\nand to the kindest indulgence you have shown me all through my life;\r\nand you may rely upon it I will never mention the subject again. If\r\nyour answer should be yes; I will go directly to Henslow and consult\r\ndeliberately with him, and then come to Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\nThe danger appears to me and all the Wedgwoods not great. The expense\r\ncannot be serious, and the time I do not think, anyhow, would be more\r\nthrown away then if I stayed at home. But pray do not consider that I\r\nam so bent on going that I would for one SINGLE MOMENT hesitate, if you\r\nthought that after a short period you should continue uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nI must again state I cannot think it would unfit me hereafter for a\r\nsteady life. I do hope this letter will not give you much uneasiness. I\r\nsend it by the car to-morrow morning; if you make up your mind directly\r\nwill you send me an answer on the following day by the same means? If\r\nthis letter should not find you at home, I hope you will answer as soon\r\nas you conveniently can.\r\n\r\nI do not know what to say about Uncle Jos' kindness; I never can forget\r\nhow he interests himself about me.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear father, Your affectionate son, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Here follows the list of objections which are referred to in the\r\nfollowing letter:--\r\n\r\n1. Disreputable to my character as a Clergyman hereafter.\r\n\r\n2. A wild scheme.\r\n\r\n3. That they must have offered to many others before me the place of\r\nNaturalist.\r\n\r\n4. And from its not being accepted there must be some serious objection\r\nto the vessel or expedition.\r\n\r\n5. That I should never settle down to a steady life hereafter.\r\n\r\n6. That my accommodations would be most uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n7. That you [i.e. Dr. Darwin] should consider it as again changing my\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n8. That it would be a useless undertaking.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSIAH WEDGWOOD TO R.W. DARWIN. Maer, August 31, 1831. [Read this last.]\r\n(In C. Darwin's writing.)\r\n\r\nMy dear Doctor,\r\n\r\nI feel the responsibility of your application to me on the offer that\r\nhas been made to Charles as being weighty, but as you have desired\r\nCharles to consult me, I cannot refuse to give the result of such\r\nconsideration as I have been able to [give?] it.\r\n\r\nCharles has put down what he conceives to be your principal objections,\r\nand I think the best course I can take will be to state what occurs to\r\nme upon each of them.\r\n\r\n1. I should not think that it would be in any degree disreputable to\r\nhis character as a Clergyman. I should on the contrary think the offer\r\nhonourable to him; and the pursuit of Natural History, though certainly\r\nnot professional, is very suitable to a clergyman.\r\n\r\n2. I hardly know how to meet this objection, but he would have definite\r\nobjects upon which to employ himself, and might acquire and strengthen\r\nhabits of application, and I should think would be as likely to do so as\r\nin any way in which he is likely to pass the next two years at home.\r\n\r\n3. The notion did not occur to me in reading the letters; and on reading\r\nthem again with that object in my mind I see no ground for it.\r\n\r\n4. I cannot conceive that the Admiralty would send out a bad vessel on\r\nsuch a service. As to objections to the expedition, they will differ in\r\neach man's case, and nothing would, I think, be inferred in Charles's\r\ncase, if it were known that others had objected.\r\n\r\n5. You are a much better judge of Charles's character than I can be. If\r\non comparing this mode of spending the next two years with the way in\r\nwhich he will probably spend them, if he does not accept this offer, you\r\nthink him more likely to be rendered unsteady and unable to settle, it\r\nis undoubtedly a weighty objection. Is it not the case that sailors are\r\nprone to settle in domestic and quiet habits?\r\n\r\n6. I can form no opinion on this further than that if appointed by the\r\nAdmiralty he will have a claim to be as well accommodated as the vessel\r\nwill allow.\r\n\r\n7. If I saw Charles now absorbed in professional studies I should\r\nprobably think it would not be advisable to interrupt them; but this is\r\nnot, and, I think, will not be the case with him. His present pursuit\r\nof knowledge is in the same track as he would have to follow in the\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n8. The undertaking would be useless as regards his profession, but\r\nlooking upon him as a man of enlarged curiosity, it affords him such an\r\nopportunity of seeing men and things as happens to few.\r\n\r\nYou will bear in mind that I have had very little time for\r\nconsideration, and that you and Charles are the persons who must decide.\r\n\r\nI am, My dear Doctor, Affectionately yours, JOSIAH WEDGWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Cambridge, Red Lion [September 2], 1831.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am just arrived; you will guess the reason. My father has changed his\r\nmind. I trust the place is not given away.\r\n\r\nI am very much fatigued, and am going to bed.\r\n\r\nI dare say you have not yet got my second letter.\r\n\r\nHow soon shall I come to you in the morning? Send a verbal answer.\r\n\r\nGood-night, Yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MISS SUSAN DARWIN. Cambridge, Sunday Morning\r\n[September 4].\r\n\r\nMy dear Susan,\r\n\r\nAs a letter would not have gone yesterday, I put off writing till\r\nto-day. I had rather a wearisome journey, but got into Cambridge very\r\nfresh. The whole of yesterday I spent with Henslow, thinking of what is\r\nto be done, and that I find is a great deal. By great good luck I know\r\na man of the name of Wood, nephew of Lord Londonderry. He is a great\r\nfriend of Captain Fitz-Roy, and has written to him about me. I heard\r\na part of Captain Fitz-Roy's letter, dated some time ago, in which he\r\nsays: \"I have a right good set of officers, and most of my men have been\r\nthere before.\" It seems he has been there for the last few years; he was\r\nthen second in command with the same vessel that he has now chosen. He\r\nis only twenty-three years old, but [has] seen a deal of service, and\r\nwon the gold medal at Portsmouth. The Admiralty say his maps are most\r\nperfect. He had choice of two vessels, and he chose the smallest.\r\nHenslow will give me letters to all travellers in town whom he thinks\r\nmay assist me.\r\n\r\nPeacock has sole appointment of Naturalist. The first person offered\r\nwas Leonard Jenyns, who was so near accepting it that he packed up\r\nhis clothes. But having [a] living, he did not think it right to leave\r\nit--to the great regret of all his family. Henslow himself was not very\r\nfar from accepting it, for Mrs. Henslow most generously, and without\r\nbeing asked, gave her consent; but she looked so miserable that Henslow\r\nat once settled the point....\r\n\r\nI am afraid there will be a good deal of expense at first. Henslow\r\nis much against taking many things; it is [the] mistake all young\r\ntravellers fall into. I write as if it was settled, but Henslow tells me\r\nBY NO MEANS to make up my mind till I have had long conversations\r\nwith Captains Beaufort and Fitz-Roy. Good-bye. You will hear from me\r\nconstantly. Direct 17 Spring Gardens. TELL NOBODY in Shropshire yet. Be\r\nsure not.\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI was so tired that evening I was in Shrewsbury that I thanked none of\r\nyou for your kindness half so much as I felt.\r\n\r\nLove to my father.\r\n\r\nThe reason I don't want people told in Shropshire: in case I should not\r\ngo, it will make it more flat.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MISS S. DARWIN. 17 Spring Gardens, Monday [September\r\n5, 1831].\r\n\r\nI have so little time to spare that I have none to waste in re-writing\r\nletters, so that you must excuse my bringing up the other with me and\r\naltering it. The last letter was written in the morning. In [the] middle\r\nof [the] day, Wood received a letter from Captain Fitz-Roy, which I must\r\nsay was MOST straightforward and GENTLEMANLIKE, but so much against my\r\ngoing, that I immediately gave up the scheme; and Henslow did the same,\r\nsaying that he thought Peacock had acted VERY WRONG in misrepresenting\r\nthings so much.\r\n\r\nI scarcely thought of going to town, but here I am; and now for more\r\ndetails, and much more promising ones. Captain Fitz-Roy is [in] town,\r\nand I have seen him; it is no use attempting to praise him as much as\r\nI feel inclined to do, for you would not believe me. One thing I am\r\ncertain, nothing could be more open and kind than he was to me. It seems\r\nhe had promised to take a friend with him, who is in office and cannot\r\ngo, and he only received the letter five minutes before I came in;\r\nand this makes things much better for me, as want of room was one of\r\nFitz-Roy's greatest objections. He offers me to go share in everything\r\nin his cabin if I like to come, and every sort of accommodation that\r\nI can have, but they will not be numerous. He says nothing would be so\r\nmiserable for him as having me with him if I was uncomfortable, as in\r\na small vessel we must be thrown together, and thought it his duty\r\nto state everything in the worst point of view. I think I shall go on\r\nSunday to Plymouth to see the vessel.\r\n\r\nThere is something most extremely attractive in his manners and way of\r\ncoming straight to the point. If I live with him, he says I must live\r\npoorly--no wine, and the plainest dinners. The scheme is not certainly\r\nso good as Peacock describes. Captain Fitz-Roy advises me not [to] make\r\nup my mind quite yet, but that, seriously, he thinks it will have much\r\nmore pleasure than pain for me. The vessel does not sail till the 10th\r\nof October. It contains sixty men, five or six officers, etc., but is a\r\nsmall vessel. It will probably be out nearly three years. I shall pay\r\nto the mess the same as [the] Captain does himself, 30 pounds per annum;\r\nand Fitz-Roy says if I spend, including my outfitting, 500 pounds, it\r\nwill be beyond the extreme. But now for still worse news. The round the\r\nworld is not CERTAIN, but the chance most excellent. Till that point is\r\ndecided, I will not be so. And you may believe, after the many changes I\r\nhave made, that nothing but my reason shall decide me.\r\n\r\nFitz-Roy says the stormy sea is exaggerated; that if I do not choose to\r\nremain with them, I can at any time get home to England, so many vessels\r\nsail that way, and that during bad weather (probably two months), if\r\nI like I shall be left in some healthy, safe and nice country; that I\r\nshall always have assistance; that he has many books, all instruments,\r\nguns, at my service; that the fewer and cheaper clothes I take the\r\nbetter. The manner of proceeding will just suit me. They anchor the\r\nship, and then remain for a fortnight at a place. I have made Captain\r\nBeaufort perfectly understand me. He says if I start and do not go round\r\nthe world, I shall have good reason to think myself deceived. I am to\r\ncall the day after to-morrow, and, if possible, to receive more certain\r\ninstructions. The want of room is decidedly the most serious objection;\r\nbut Captain Fitz-Roy (probably owing to Wood's letter) seems determined\r\nto make me [as] comfortable as he possibly can. I like his manner of\r\nproceeding. He asked me at once, \"Shall you bear being told that I want\r\nthe cabin to myself--when I want to be alone? If we treat each other\r\nthis way, I hope we shall suit; if not, probably we should wish each\r\nother at the devil.\"\r\n\r\nWe stop a week at [the] Madeira Islands, and shall see most of [the]\r\nbig cities in South America. Captain Beaufort is drawing up the track\r\nthrough the South Sea. I am writing in [a] great hurry; I do not know\r\nwhether you take interest enough to excuse treble postage. I hope I am\r\njudging reasonably, and not through prejudice, about Captain Fitz-Roy;\r\nif so, I am sure we shall suit. I dine with him to-day. I could write\r\n[a] great deal more if I thought you liked it, and I had at present\r\ntime. There is indeed a tide in the affairs of man, and I have\r\nexperienced it, and I had ENTIRELY given it up till one to-day.\r\n\r\nLove to my father. Dearest Susan, good-bye.\r\n\r\nCH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. London, Monday, [September 5, 1831].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nGloria in excelsis is the most moderate beginning I can think of.\r\nThings are more prosperous than I should have thought possible. Captain\r\nFitz-Roy is everything that is delightful. If I was to praise half so\r\nmuch as I feel inclined, you would say it was absurd, only once seeing\r\nhim. I think he really wishes to have me. He offers me to mess with him,\r\nand he will take care I have such room as is possible. But about the\r\ncases he says I must limit myself; but then he thinks like a sailor\r\nabout size. Captain Beaufort says I shall be upon the Boards, and then\r\nit will only cost me like other officers. Ship sails 10th of October.\r\nSpends a week at Madeira Islands; and then Rio de Janeiro. They all\r\nthink most extremely probable, home by the Indian archipelago; but till\r\nthat is decided, I will not be so.\r\n\r\nWhat has induced Captain Fitz-Roy to take a better view of the case is,\r\nthat Mr. Chester, who was going as a friend, cannot go, so that I shall\r\nhave his place in every respect.\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitz-Roy has [a] good stock of books, many of which were in my\r\nlist, and rifles, etc., so that the outfit will be much less expensive\r\nthan I supposed.\r\n\r\nThe vessel will be out three years. I do not object so that my father\r\ndoes not. On Wednesday I have another interview with Captain Beaufort,\r\nand on Sunday most likely go with Captain Fitz-Roy to Plymouth. So I\r\nhope you will keep on thinking on the subject, and just keep memoranda\r\nof what may strike you. I will call most probably on Mr. Burchell and\r\nintroduce myself. I am in lodgings at 17 Spring Gardens. You cannot\r\nimagine anything more pleasant, kind, and open than Captain Fitz-Roy's\r\nmanners were to me. I am sure it will be my fault if we do not suit.\r\n\r\nWhat changes I have had. Till one to-day I was building castles in the\r\nair about hunting foxes the Shropshire, now llamas in South America.\r\n\r\nThere is indeed a tide in the affairs of men. If you see Mr. Wood,\r\nremember me very kindly to him.\r\n\r\nGood-bye. My dear Henslow, Your most sincere friend, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nExcuse this letter in such a hurry.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. 17 Spring Gardens, London, September 6,\r\n1831....\r\n\r\nYour letter gave me great pleasure. You cannot imagine how much your\r\nformer letter annoyed and hurt me. (He had misunderstood a letter of\r\nFox's as implying a charge of falsehood.) But, thank heaven, I firmly\r\nbelieve that it was my OWN ENTIRE fault in so interpreting your letter.\r\nI lost a friend the other day, and I doubt whether the moral death (as\r\nI then wickedly supposed) of our friendship did not grieve me as much as\r\nthe real and sudden death of poor Ramsay. We have known each other too\r\nlong to need, I trust, any more explanations. But I will mention just\r\none thing--that on my death-bed, I think I could say I never uttered one\r\ninsincere (which at the time I did not fully feel) expression about my\r\nregard for you. One thing more--the sending IMMEDIATELY the insects, on\r\nmy honour, was an unfortunate coincidence. I forgot how you naturally\r\nwould take them. When you look at them now, I hope no unkindly feelings\r\nwill rise in your mind, and that you will believe that you have always\r\nhad in me a sincere, and I will add, an obliged friend. The very many\r\npleasant minutes that we spent together in Cambridge rose like departed\r\nspirits in judgment against me. May we have many more such, will be one\r\nof my last wishes in leaving England. God bless you, dear old Fox. May\r\nyou always be happy.\r\n\r\nYours truly, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI have left your letter behind, so do not know whether I direct right.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MISS SUSAN DARWIN. 17 Spring Gardens, Tuesday,\r\n[September 6, 1831.]\r\n\r\nMy dear Susan,\r\n\r\nAgain I am going to trouble you. I suspect, if I keep on at this rate,\r\nyou will sincerely wish me at Tierra del Fuego, or any other Terra, but\r\nEngland. First I will give my commissions. Tell Nancy to make me\r\nsome twelve instead of eight shirts. Tell Edward to send me up in my\r\ncarpet-bag (he can slip the key in the bag tied to some string), my\r\nslippers, a pair of lightish walking-shoes, my Spanish books, my new\r\nmicroscope (about six inches long and three or four deep), which must\r\nhave cotton stuffed inside; my geological compass; my father knows\r\nthat; a little book, if I have got it in my bedroom--'Taxidermy.' Ask\r\nmy father if he thinks there would be any objection to my taking arsenic\r\nfor a little time, as my hands are not quite well, and I have always\r\nobserved that if I once get them well, and change my manner of living\r\nabout the same time, they will generally remain well. What is the dose?\r\nTell Edward my gun is dirty. What is Erasmus's direction? Tell me if you\r\nthink there is time to write and receive an answer before I start, as I\r\nshould like particularly to know what he thinks about it. I suppose you\r\ndo not know Sir J. Mackintosh's direction?\r\n\r\nI write all this as if it was settled, but it is not more than it was,\r\nexcepting that from Captain Fitz-Roy wishing me so much to go, and from\r\nhis kindness, I feel a predestination I shall start. I spent a very\r\npleasant evening with him yesterday. He must be more than twenty-three\r\nyears old; he is of a slight figure, and a dark but handsome edition of\r\nMr. Kynaston, and, according to my notions, pre-eminently good manners.\r\nHe is all for economy, excepting on one point--viz., fire-arms. He\r\nrecommends me strongly to get a case of pistols like his, which cost 60\r\npounds!! and never to go on shore anywhere without loaded ones, and he\r\nis doubting about a rifle; he says I cannot appreciate the luxury\r\nof fresh meat here. Of course I shall buy nothing till everything is\r\nsettled; but I work all day long at my lists, putting in and striking\r\nout articles. This is the first really cheerful day I have spent since\r\nI received the letter, and it all is owing to the sort of involuntary\r\nconfidence I place in my beau ideal of a Captain.\r\n\r\nWe stop at Teneriffe. His object is to stop at as many places as\r\npossible. He takes out twenty chronometers, and it will be a \"sin\" not\r\nto settle the longitude. He tells me to get it down in writing at the\r\nAdmiralty that I have the free choice to leave as soon and whenever I\r\nlike. I dare say you expect I shall turn back at the Madeira; if I have\r\na morsel of stomach left, I won't give up. Excuse my so often troubling\r\nand writing: the one is of great utility, the other a great amusement to\r\nme. Most likely I shall write to-morrow. Answer by return of post. Love\r\nto my father, dearest Susan.\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nAs my instruments want altering, send my things by the 'Oxonian' the\r\nsame night.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MISS SUSAN DARWIN. London, Friday Morning, September\r\n9, 1831.\r\n\r\nMy dear Susan,\r\n\r\nI have just received the parcel. I suppose it was not delivered\r\nyesterday owing to the Coronation. I am very much obliged to my father,\r\nand everybody else. Everything is done quite right. I suppose by this\r\ntime you have received my letter written next day, and I hope will send\r\noff the things. My affairs remain in statu quo. Captain Beaufort says I\r\nam on the books for victuals, and he thinks I shall have no difficulty\r\nabout my collections when I come home. But he is too deep a fish for me\r\nto make him out. The only thing that now prevents me finally making up\r\nmy mind, is the want of certainty about the South Sea Islands; although\r\nmorally I have no doubt we should go there whether or no it is put in\r\nthe instructions. Captain Fitz-Roy says I do good by plaguing Captain\r\nBeaufort, it stirs him up with a long pole. Captain Fitz-Roy says he is\r\nsure he has interest enough (particularly if this Administration is not\r\neverlasting--I shall soon turn Tory!), anyhow, even when out, to get\r\nthe ship ordered home by whatever track he likes. From what Wood says, I\r\npresume the Dukes of Grafton and Richmond interest themselves about him.\r\nBy the way, Wood has been of the greatest use to me; and I am sure his\r\npersonal introduction of me inclined Captain Fitz-Roy to have me.\r\n\r\nTo explain things from the very beginning: Captain Fitz-Roy first wished\r\nto have a Naturalist, and then he seems to have taken a sudden horror of\r\nthe chances of having somebody he should not like on board the vessel.\r\nHe confesses his letter to Cambridge was to throw cold water on the\r\nscheme. I don't think we shall quarrel about politics, although Wood (as\r\nmight be expected from a Londonderry) solemnly warned Fitz-Roy that I\r\nwas a Whig. Captain Fitz-Roy was before Uncle Jos., he said, \"now your\r\nfriends will tell you a sea-captain is the greatest brute on the face\r\nof the creation. I do not know how to help you in this case, except by\r\nhoping you will give me a trial.\" How one does change! I actually now\r\nwish the voyage was longer before we touch land. I feel my blood run\r\ncold at the quantity I have to do. Everybody seems ready to assist me.\r\nThe Zoological want to make me a corresponding member. All this I\r\ncan construct without crossing the Equator. But one friend is quite\r\ninvaluable, viz., a Mr. Yarrell, a stationer, and excellent naturalist.\r\n(William Yarrell, well-known for his 'History of British Birds' and\r\n'History of British Fishes,' was born in 1784. He inherited from his\r\nfather a newsagent's business, to which he steadily adhered up to his\r\ndeath, \"in his 73rd year.\" He was a man of a thoroughly amiable and\r\nhonourable character, and was a valued office-bearer of several of\r\nthe learned Societies.) He goes to the shops with me and bullies about\r\nprices (not that I yet buy): hang me if I give 60 pounds for pistols.\r\n\r\nYesterday all the shops were shut, so that I could do nothing; and I was\r\nchild enough to give 1 pound 1 shilling for an excellent seat to see the\r\nProcession. (The Coronation of William IV.) And it certainly was very\r\nwell worth seeing. I was surprised that any quantity of gold could make\r\na long row of people quite glitter. It was like only what one sees in\r\npicture-books of Eastern processions. The King looked very well, and\r\nseemed popular, but there was very little enthusiasm; so little that I\r\ncan hardly think there will be a coronation this time fifty years.\r\n\r\nThe Life Guards pleased me as much as anything--they are quite\r\nmagnificent; and it is beautiful to see them clear a crowd. You think\r\nthat they must kill a score at least, and apparently they really hurt\r\nnobody, but most deucedly frighten them. Whenever a crowd was so dense\r\nthat the people were forced off the causeway, one of these six-feet\r\ngentlemen, on a black horse, rode straight at the place, making his\r\nhorse rear very high, and fall on the thickest spot. You would suppose\r\nmen were made of sponge to see them shrink away.\r\n\r\nIn the evening there was an illumination, and much grander than the one\r\non the Reform Bill. All the principal streets were crowded just like a\r\nrace-ground. Carriages generally being six abreast, and I will venture\r\nto say not going one mile an hour. The Duke of Northumberland learnt a\r\nlesson last time, for his house was very grand; much more so than the\r\nother great nobility, and in much better taste; every window in his\r\nhouse was full of straight lines of brilliant lights, and from their\r\nextreme regularity and number had a beautiful effect. The paucity of\r\ninvention was very striking, crowns, anchors, and \"W.R.'s\" were repeated\r\nin endless succession. The prettiest were gas-pipes with small holes;\r\nthey were almost painfully brilliant. I have written so much about the\r\nCoronation, that I think you will have no occasion to read the \"Morning\r\nHerald\".\r\n\r\nFor about the first time in my life I find London very pleasant; hurry,\r\nbustle, and noise are all in unison with my feelings. And I have plenty\r\nto do in spare moments. I work at Astronomy, as I suppose it would\r\nastound a sailor if one did not know how to find Latitude and Longitude.\r\nI am now going to Captain Fitz-Roy, and will keep [this] letter open\r\ntill evening for anything that may occur. I will give you one proof of\r\nFitz-Roy being a good officer--all the officers are the same as before;\r\ntwo-thirds of his crew and [the] eight marines who went before all\r\noffered to come again, so the service cannot be so very bad. The\r\nAdmiralty have just issued orders for a large stock of canister-meat\r\nand lemon-juice, etc. etc. I have just returned from spending a long\r\nday with Captain Fitz-Roy, driving about in his gig, and shopping. This\r\nletter is too late for to-day's post. You may consider it settled that I\r\ngo. Yet there is room for change if any untoward accident should happen;\r\nthis I can see no reason to expect. I feel convinced nothing else will\r\nalter my wish of going. I have begun to order things. I have procured a\r\ncase of good strong pistols and an excellent rifle for 50 pounds, there\r\nis a saving; a good telescope, with compass, 5 pounds, and these are\r\nnearly the only expensive instruments I shall want. Captain Fitz-Roy has\r\neverything. I never saw so (what I should call, he says not) extravagant\r\na man, as regards himself, but as economical towards me. How he did\r\norder things! His fire-arms will cost 400 pounds at least. I found the\r\ncarpet bag when I arrived all right, and much obliged. I do not think\r\nI shall take any arsenic; shall send partridges to Mr. Yarrell; much\r\nobliged. Ask Edward to BARGAIN WITH Clemson to make for my gun--TWO\r\nSPARE hammers or cocks, two main-springs, two sere-springs, four nipples\r\nor plugs--I mean one for each barrel, except nipples, of which there\r\nmust be two for each, all of excellent quality, and set about them\r\nimmediately; tell Edward to make inquiries about prices. I go on Sunday\r\nper packet to Plymouth, shall stay one or two days, then return, and\r\nhope to find a letter from you; a few days in London; then Cambridge,\r\nShrewsbury, London, Plymouth, Madeira, is my route. It is a great bore\r\nmy writing so much about the Coronation; I could fill another sheet.\r\nI have just been with Captain King, Fitz-Roy's senior officer last\r\nexpedition; he thinks that the expedition will suit me. Unasked, he\r\nsaid Fitz-Roy's temper was perfect. He sends his own son with him\r\nas midshipman. The key of my microscope was forgotten; it is of no\r\nconsequence. Love to all.\r\n\r\nCHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. 17 Spring Gardens (and here I shall remain\r\ntill I start) [September 19, 1831].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nI returned from my expedition to see the \"Beagle\" at Plymouth on\r\nSaturday, and found your most welcome letter on my table. It is quite\r\nridiculous what a very long period these last twenty days have appeared\r\nto me, certainly much more than as many weeks on ordinary occasions;\r\nthis will account for my not recollecting how much I told you of my\r\nplans....\r\n\r\nBut on the whole it is a grand and fortunate opportunity; there will be\r\nso many things to interest me--fine scenery and an endless occupation\r\nand amusement in the different branches of Natural History; then again\r\nnavigation and meteorology will amuse me on the voyage, joined to the\r\ngrand requisite of there being a pleasant set of officers, and, as\r\nfar as I can judge, this is certain. On the other hand there is very\r\nconsiderable risk to one's life and health, and the leaving for so very\r\nlong a time so many people whom I dearly love, is oftentimes a feeling\r\nso painful that it requires all my resolution to overcome it. But\r\neverything is now settled, and before the 20th of October I trust to\r\nbe on the broad sea. My objection to the vessel is its smallness, which\r\ncramps one so for room for packing my own body and all my cases, etc.,\r\netc. As to its safety, I hope the Admiralty are the best judges; to a\r\nlandsman's eye she looks very small. She is a ten-gun three-masted brig,\r\nbut, I believe, an excellent vessel. So much for my future plans, and\r\nnow for my present. I go to-night by the mail to Cambridge, and from\r\nthence, after settling my affairs, proceed to Shrewsbury (most likely on\r\nFriday 23rd, or perhaps before); there I shall stay a few days, and be\r\nin London by the 1st of October, and start for Plymouth on the 9th.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the principal part of my letter. I do not know how to tell\r\nyou how very kind I feel your offer of coming to see me before I\r\nleave England. Indeed I should like it very much; but I must tell you\r\ndecidedly that I shall have very little time to spare, and that little\r\ntime will be almost spoilt by my having so much to think about; and\r\nsecondly, I can hardly think it worth your while to leave your parish\r\nfor such a cause. But I shall never forget such generous kindness. Now\r\nI know you will act just as you think right; but do not come up for my\r\nsake. Any time is the same for me. I think from this letter you will\r\nknow as much of my plans as I do myself, and will judge accordingly\r\nthe where and when to write to me. Every now and then I have moments of\r\nglorious enthusiasm, when I think of the date and cocoa-trees, the palms\r\nand ferns so lofty and beautiful, everything new, everything sublime.\r\nAnd if I live to see years in after life, how grand must such\r\nrecollections be! Do you know Humboldt? (If you don't, do so directly.)\r\nWith what intense pleasure he appears always to look back on the days\r\nspent in the tropical countries. I hope when you next write to Osmaston,\r\n[you will] tell them my scheme, and give them my kindest regards and\r\nfarewells.\r\n\r\nGood-bye, my dear Fox, Yours ever sincerely, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO R. FITZ-ROY. 17 Spring Gardens [October 17? 1831].\r\n\r\nDear Fitz-Roy,\r\n\r\nVery many thanks for your letter; it has made me most comfortable, for\r\nit would have been heart-breaking to have left anything quite behind,\r\nand I never should have thought of sending things by some other vessel.\r\nThis letter will, I trust, accompany some talc. I read your letter\r\nwithout attending to the name. But I have now procured some from Jones,\r\nwhich appears very good, and I will send it this evening by the mail.\r\nYou will be surprised at not seeing me propria persona instead of my\r\nhandwriting. But I had just found out that the large steam-packet did\r\nnot intend to sail on Sunday, and I was picturing to myself a small,\r\ndirty cabin, with the proportion of 39-40ths of the passengers very\r\nsick, when Mr. Earl came in and told me the \"Beagle\" would not sail till\r\nthe beginning of November. This, of course, settled the point; so that I\r\nremain in London one week more. I shall then send heavy goods by steamer\r\nand start myself by the coach on Sunday evening.\r\n\r\nHave you a good set of mountain barometers? Several great guns in the\r\nscientific world have told me some points in geology to ascertain which\r\nentirely depend on their relative height. If you have not a good stock,\r\nI will add one more to the list. I ought to be ashamed to trouble you so\r\nmuch, but will you SEND ONE LINE to inform me? I am daily becoming more\r\nanxious to be off, and, if I am so, you must be in a perfect fever. What\r\na glorious day the 4th of November will be to me! My second life will\r\nthen commence, and it shall be as a birthday for the rest of my life.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, dear Fitz-Roy, Yours most sincerely, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nMONDAY.--I hope I have not put you to much inconvenience by ordering the\r\nroom in readiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Devonport, November 15, 1831.\r\n\r\nMy dear Henslow,\r\n\r\nThe orders are come down from the Admiralty, and everything is finally\r\nsettled. We positively sail the last day of this month, and I think\r\nbefore that time the vessel will be ready. She looks most beautiful,\r\neven a landsman must admire her. WE all think her the most perfect\r\nvessel ever turned out of the Dockyard. One thing is certain, no vessel\r\nhas been fitted out so expensively, and with so much care. Everything\r\nthat can be made so is of mahogany, and nothing can exceed the neatness\r\nand beauty of all the accommodations. The instructions are very general,\r\nand leave a great deal to the Captain's discretion and judgment, paying\r\na substantial as well as a verbal compliment to him....\r\n\r\nNo vessel ever left England with such a set of Chronometers, viz.,\r\ntwenty-four, all very good ones. In short, everything is well, and I\r\nhave only now to pray for the sickness to moderate its fierceness, and\r\nI shall do very well. Yet I should not call it one of the very best\r\nopportunities for natural history that has ever occurred. The absolute\r\nwant of room is an evil that nothing can surmount. I think L. Jenyns did\r\nvery wisely in not coming, that is judging from my own feelings, for I\r\nam sure if I had left college some few years, or been those years older,\r\nI NEVER could have endured it. The officers (excepting the Captain) are\r\nlike the freshest freshmen, that is in their manners, in everything else\r\nwidely different. Remember me most kindly to him, and tell him if ever\r\nhe dreams in the night of palm-trees, he may in the morning comfort\r\nhimself with the assurance that the voyage would not have suited him.\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your advice, de Mathematicis. I suspect when I am\r\nstruggling with a triangle, I shall often wish myself in your room, and\r\nas for those wicked sulky surds, I do not know what I shall do without\r\nyou to conjure them. My time passes away very pleasantly. I know one\r\nor two pleasant people, foremost of whom is Mr. Thunder-and-lightning\r\nHarris (William Snow Harris, the Electrician.), whom I dare say you have\r\nheard of. My chief employment is to go on board the \"Beagle\", and try to\r\nlook as much like a sailor as I can. I have no evidence of having taken\r\nin man, woman or child.\r\n\r\nI am going to ask you to do one more commission, and I trust it will\r\nbe the last. When I was in Cambridge, I wrote to Mr. Ash, asking him to\r\nsend my College account to my father, after having subtracted about 30\r\npounds for my furniture. This he has forgotten to do, and my father has\r\npaid the bill, and I want to have the furniture-money transmitted to\r\nmy father. Perhaps you would be kind enough to speak to Mr. Ash. I have\r\ncost my father so much money, I am quite ashamed of myself.\r\n\r\nI will write once again before sailing, and perhaps you will write to me\r\nbefore then.\r\n\r\nRemember me to Professor Sedgwick and Mr. Peacock.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours affectionately, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Devonport, December 3, 1831.\r\n\r\nMy dear Henslow,\r\n\r\nIt is now late in the evening, and to-night I am going to sleep on\r\nboard. On Monday we most certainly sail, so you may guess what a\r\ndesperate state of confusion we are all in. If you were to hear the\r\nvarious exclamations of the officers, you would suppose we had scarcely\r\nhad a week's notice. I am just in the same way taken all ABACK, and in\r\nsuch a bustle I hardly know what to do. The number of things to be done\r\nis infinite. I look forward even to sea-sickness with something like\r\nsatisfaction, anything must be better than this state of anxiety. I am\r\nvery much obliged for your last kind and affectionate letter. I always\r\nlike advice from you, and no one whom I have the luck to know is more\r\ncapable of giving it than yourself. Recollect, when you write, that I am\r\na sort of protege of yours, and that it is your bounden duty to lecture\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI will now give you my direction; it is at first, Rio; but if you\r\nwill send me a letter on the first Tuesday (when the packet sails) in\r\nFebruary, directed to Monte Video, it will give me very great pleasure;\r\nI shall so much enjoy hearing a little Cambridge news. Poor dear old\r\nAlma Mater! I am a very worthy son in as far as affection goes. I have\r\nlittle more to write about...I cannot end this without telling you how\r\ncordially I feel grateful for the kindness you have shown me during\r\nmy Cambridge life. Much of the pleasure and utility which I may have\r\nderived from it is owing to you. I long for the time when we shall again\r\nmeet, and till then believe me, my dear Henslow,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate and obliged friend, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nRemember me most kindly to those who take any interest in me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.VI. -- THE VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n\"There is a natural good-humoured energy in his letters just like\r\nhimself.\"--From a letter of Dr. R.W. Darwin's to Prof. Henslow.\r\n\r\n[The object of the \"Beagle\" voyage is briefly described in my father's\r\n'Journal of Researches,' page 1, as being \"to complete the Survey of\r\nPatagonia and Tierra del Fuego, commenced under Captain King in 1826\r\nto 1830; to survey the shores of Chile, Peru, and some island in the\r\nPacific; and to carry a chain of chronometrical measurements round the\r\nworld.\"]\r\n\r\nThe \"Beagle\" is described as a well-built little vessel, of 235 tons,\r\nrigged as a barque, and carrying six guns. She belonged to the old class\r\nof ten-gun brigs, which were nicknamed \"coffins,\" from their liability\r\nto go down in severe weather. They were very \"deep-waisted,\" that is,\r\ntheir bulwarks were high in proportion to their size, so that a heavy\r\nsea breaking over them might be highly dangerous. Nevertheless, she\r\nlived through the five years' work, in the most stormy regions in the\r\nworld, under Commanders Stokes and Fitz-Roy, without a serious accident.\r\nWhen re-commissioned in 1831 for her second voyage, she was found (as\r\nI learn from Admiral Sir James Sulivan) to be so rotten that she had\r\npractically to be rebuilt, and it was this that caused the long delay\r\nin refitting. The upper deck was raised, making her much safer in heavy\r\nweather, and giving her far more comfortable accommodation below. By\r\nthese alterations and by the strong sheathing added to her bottom\r\nshe was brought up to 242 tons burthen. It is a proof of the splendid\r\nseamanship of Captain Fitz-Roy and his officers that she returned\r\nwithout having carried away a spar, and that in only one of the heavy\r\nstorms that she encountered was she in great danger.\r\n\r\nShe was fitted out for the expedition with all possible care, being\r\nsupplied with carefully chosen spars and ropes, six boats, and a\r\n\"dinghy;\" lightning conductors, \"invented by Mr. Harris, were fixed in\r\nall the masts, the bowsprits, and even in the flying jib-boom.\" To quote\r\nmy father's description, written from Devonport, November 17, 1831:\r\n\"Everybody, who can judge, says it is one of the grandest voyages\r\nthat has almost ever been sent out. Everything is on a grand scale.\r\nTwenty-four chronometers. The whole ship is fitted up with mahogany;\r\nshe is the admiration of the whole place. In short, everything is as\r\nprosperous as human means can make it.\"\r\n\r\nOwing to the smallness of the vessel, every one on board was cramped for\r\nroom, and my father's accommodation seems to have been small enough: \"I\r\nhave just room to turn round,\" he writes to Henslow, \"and that is all.\"\r\nAdmiral Sir James Sulivan writes to me: \"The narrow space at the end of\r\nthe chart-table was his only accommodation for working, dressing, and\r\nsleeping; the hammock being left hanging over his head by day, when the\r\nsea was at all rough, that he might lie on it with a book in his hand\r\nwhen he could not any longer sit at the table. His only stowage for\r\nclothes being several small drawers in the corner, reaching from deck to\r\ndeck; the top one being taken out when the hammock was hung up, without\r\nwhich there was not length for it, so then the foot-clews took the place\r\nof the top drawer. For specimens he had a very small cabin under the\r\nforecastle.\"\r\n\r\nYet of this narrow room he wrote enthusiastically, September 17, 1831:--\r\n\r\n\"When I wrote last I was in great alarm about my cabin. The cabins were\r\nnot then marked out, but when I left they were, and mine is a capital\r\none, certainly next best to the Captain's and remarkably light. My\r\ncompanion most luckily, I think, will turn out to be the officer whom I\r\nshall like best. Captain Fitz-Roy says he will take care that one corner\r\nis so fitted up that I shall be comfortable in it and shall consider\r\nit my home, but that also I shall have the run of his. My cabin is the\r\ndrawing one; and in the middle is a large table, on which we two sleep\r\nin hammocks. But for the first two months there will be no drawing to\r\nbe done, so that it will be quite a luxurious room, and good deal larger\r\nthan the Captain's cabin.\"\r\n\r\nMy father used to say that it was the absolute necessity of tidiness\r\nin the cramped space of the \"Beagle\" that helped 'to give him his\r\nmethodical habits of working.' On the \"Beagle\", too, he would say, that\r\nhe learned what he considered the golden rule for saving time; i.e.,\r\ntaking care of the minutes.\r\n\r\nSir James Sulivan tells me that the chief fault in the outfit of the\r\nexpedition was the want of a second smaller vessel to act as tender.\r\nThis want was so much felt by Captain Fitz-Roy that he hired two decked\r\nboats to survey the coast of Patagonia, at a cost of 1100 pounds, a sum\r\nwhich he had to supply, although the boats saved several thousand pounds\r\nto the country. He afterwards bought a schooner to act as a tender, thus\r\nsaving the country a further large amount. He was ultimately ordered to\r\nsell the schooner, and was compelled to bear the loss himself, and it\r\nwas only after his death that some inadequate compensation was made for\r\nall the losses which he suffered through his zeal.\r\n\r\nFor want of a proper tender, much of the work had to be done in small\r\nopen whale boats, which were sent away from the ship for weeks together,\r\nand this in a climate, where the crews were exposed to severe hardships\r\nfrom the almost constant rains, which sometimes continued for weeks\r\ntogether. The completeness of the equipment was also in other respects\r\nlargely due to the public spirit of Captain Fitz-Roy. He provided at\r\nhis own cost an artist, and a skilled instrument-maker to look after\r\nthe chronometers. (Either one or both were on the books for victuals.)\r\nCaptain Fitz-Roy's wish was to take \"some well-educated and scientific\r\nperson\" as his private guest, but this generous offer was only accepted\r\nby my father on condition of being allowed to pay a fair share of the\r\nexpense of the Captain's table; he was, moreover, on the ship's books\r\nfor victuals.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to his sister (July 1832) he writes contentedly of his\r\nmanner of life at sea:--\"I do not think I have ever given you an account\r\nof how the day passes. We breakfast at eight o'clock. The invariable\r\nmaxim is to throw away all politeness--that is, never to wait for each\r\nother, and bolt off the minute one has done eating, etc. At sea, when\r\nthe weather is calm, I work at marine animals, with which the whole\r\nocean abounds. If there is any sea up I am either sick or contrive to\r\nread some voyage or travels. At one we dine. You shore-going people are\r\nlamentably mistaken about the manner of living on board. We have never\r\nyet (nor shall we) dined off salt meat. Rice and peas and calavanses are\r\nexcellent vegetables, and, with good bread, who could want more? Judge\r\nAlderson could not be more temperate, as nothing but water comes on the\r\ntable. At five we have tea. The midshipmen's berth have all their meals\r\nan hour before us, and the gun-room an hour afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nThe crew of the \"Beagle\" consisted of Captain Fitz-Roy, \"Commander and\r\nSurveyor,\" two lieutenants, one of whom (the first lieutenant) was the\r\nlate Captain Wickham, Governor of Queensland; the present Admiral Sir\r\nJames Sulivan, K.C.B., was the second lieutenant. Besides the master\r\nand two mates, there was an assistant-surveyor, the present Admiral Lort\r\nStokes. There were also a surgeon, assistant-surgeon, two midshipmen,\r\nmaster's mate, a volunteer (1st class), purser, carpenter, clerk,\r\nboatswain, eight marines, thirty-four seamen, and six boys.\r\n\r\nThere are not now (1882) many survivors of my father's old ship-mates.\r\nAdmiral Mellersh, Mr. Hammond, and Mr. Philip King, of the Legislative\r\nCouncil of Sydney, and Mr. Usborne, are among the number. Admiral\r\nJohnson died almost at the same time as my father.\r\n\r\nHe retained to the last a most pleasant recollection of the voyage of\r\nthe \"Beagle\", and of the friends he made on board her. To his children\r\ntheir names were familiar, from his many stories of the voyage, and we\r\ncaught his feeling of friendship for many who were to us nothing more\r\nthan names.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to know how affectionately his old companions remembered\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSir James Sulivan remained, throughout my father's lifetime, one of\r\nhis best and truest friends. He writes:--\"I can confidently express my\r\nbelief that during the five years in the \"Beagle\", he was never known to\r\nbe out of temper, or to say one unkind or hasty word OF or TO any\r\none. You will therefore readily understand how this, combined with the\r\nadmiration of his energy and ability, led to our giving him the name of\r\n'the dear old Philosopher.'\" (His other nickname was \"The Flycatcher.\" I\r\nhave heard my father tell how he overheard the boatswain of the \"Beagle\"\r\nshowing another boatswain over the ship, and pointing out the\r\nofficers: \"That's our first lieutenant; that's our doctor; that's our\r\nflycatcher.\") Admiral Mellersh writes to me:--\"Your father is as vividly\r\nin my mind's eye as if it was only a week ago that I was in the \"Beagle\"\r\nwith him; his genial smile and conversation can never be forgotten by\r\nany who saw them and heard them. I was sent on two or three occasions\r\naway in a boat with him on some of his scientific excursions, and always\r\nlooked forward to these trips with great pleasure, an anticipation that,\r\nunlike many others, was always realised. I think he was the only man\r\nI ever knew against whom I never heard a word said; and as people when\r\nshut up in a ship for five years are apt to get cross with each other,\r\nthat is saying a good deal. Certainly we were always so hard at work, we\r\nhad no time to quarrel, but if we had done so, I feel sure your father\r\nwould have tried (and have been successful) to throw oil on the troubled\r\nwaters.\"\r\n\r\nAdmiral Stokes, Mr. King, Mr. Usborne, and Mr. Hamond, all speak of\r\ntheir friendship with him in the same warm-hearted way.\r\n\r\nOf the life on board and on shore his letters give some idea. Captain\r\nFitz-Roy was a strict officer, and made himself thoroughly respected\r\nboth by officers and men. The occasional severity of his manner was\r\nborne with because every one on board knew that his first thought was\r\nhis duty, and that he would sacrifice anything to the real welfare\r\nof the ship. My father writes, July 1834, \"We all jog on very well\r\ntogether, there is no quarrelling on board, which is something to say.\r\nThe Captain keeps all smooth by rowing every one in turn.\" The best\r\nproof that Fitz-Roy was valued as a commander is given by the fact that\r\nmany ('Voyage of the \"Adventure\" and \"Beagle\",' vol. ii. page 21.) of\r\nthe crew had sailed with him in the \"Beagle's\" former voyage, and there\r\nwere a few officers as well as seamen and marines, who had served in the\r\n\"Adventure\" or \"Beagle\" during the whole of that expedition.\r\n\r\nMy father speaks of the officers as a fine determined set of men, and\r\nespecially of Wickham, the first lieutenant, as a \"glorious fellow.\" The\r\nlatter being responsible for the smartness and appearance of the ship\r\nstrongly objected to his littering the decks, and spoke of specimens as\r\n\"d--d beastly devilment,\" and used to add, \"If I were skipper, I would\r\nsoon have you and all your d--d mess out of the place.\"\r\n\r\nA sort of halo of sanctity was given to my father by the fact of his\r\ndining in the Captain's cabin, so that the midshipmen used at first to\r\ncall him \"Sir,\" a formality, however, which did not prevent his becoming\r\nfast friends with the younger officers. He wrote about the year 1861\r\nor 1862 to Mr. P.G. King, M.L.C., Sydney, who, as before stated, was a\r\nmidshipman on board the \"Beagle\":--\"The remembrance of old days, when we\r\nused to sit and talk on the booms of the \"Beagle\", will always, to the\r\nday of my death, make me glad to hear of your happiness and prosperity.\"\r\nMr. King describes the pleasure my father seemed to take \"in pointing\r\nout to me as a youngster the delights of the tropical nights, with their\r\nbalmy breezes eddying out of the sails above us, and the sea lighted\r\nup by the passage of the ship through the never-ending streams of\r\nphosphorescent animalculae.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been assumed that his ill-health in later years was due to his\r\nhaving suffered so much from sea-sickness. This he did not himself\r\nbelieve, but rather ascribed his bad health to the hereditary fault\r\nwhich came out as gout in some of the past generations. I am not\r\nquite clear as to how much he actually suffered from sea-sickness; my\r\nimpression is distinct that, according to his own memory, he was not\r\nactually ill after the first three weeks, but constantly uncomfortable\r\nwhen the vessel pitched at all heavily. But, judging from his letters,\r\nand from the evidence of some of the officers, it would seem that\r\nin later years he forgot the extent of the discomfort from which he\r\nsuffered. Writing June 3, 1836, from the Cape of Good Hope, he says: \"It\r\nis a lucky thing for me that the voyage is drawing to its close, for\r\nI positively suffer more from sea-sickness now than three years ago.\"\r\nAdmiral Lort Stokes wrote to the \"Times\", April 25, 1883:--\r\n\r\n\"May I beg a corner for my feeble testimony to the marvellous\r\npersevering endurance in the cause of science of that great naturalist,\r\nmy old and lost friend, Mr. Charles Darwin, whose remains are so very\r\njustly to be honoured with a resting-place in Westminster Abbey?\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps no one can better testify to his early and most trying labours\r\nthan myself. We worked together for several years at the same table in\r\nthe poop cabin of the 'Beagle' during her celebrated voyage, he with his\r\nmicroscope and myself at the charts. It was often a very lively end of\r\nthe little craft, and distressingly so to my old friend, who suffered\r\ngreatly from sea-sickness. After perhaps an hour's work he would say to\r\nme, 'Old fellow, I must take the horizontal for it,' that being the best\r\nrelief position from ship motion; a stretch out on one side of the table\r\nfor some time would enable him to resume his labours for a while, when\r\nhe had again to lie down.\r\n\r\n\"It was distressing to witness this early sacrifice of Mr. Darwin's\r\nhealth, who ever afterwards seriously felt the ill-effects of the\r\n'Beagle's' voyage.\"\r\n\r\nMr. A.B. Usborne writes, \"He was a dreadful sufferer from sea-sickness,\r\nand at times, when I have been officer of the watch, and reduced the\r\nsails, making the ship more easy, and thus relieving him, I have been\r\npronounced by him to be 'a good officer,' and he would resume his\r\nmicroscopic observations in the poop cabin.\" The amount of work that he\r\ngot through on the \"Beagle\" shows that he was habitually in full vigour;\r\nhe had, however, one severe illness, in South America, when he was\r\nreceived into the house of an Englishman, Mr. Corfield, who tended him\r\nwith careful kindness. I have heard him say that in this illness every\r\nsecretion of the body was affected, and that when he described the\r\nsymptoms to his father Dr. Darwin could make no guess as to the nature\r\nof the disease. My father was sometimes inclined to think that the\r\nbreaking up of his health was to some extent due to this attack.\r\n\r\nThe \"Beagle\" letters give ample proof of his strong love of home, and\r\nall connected with it, from his father down to Nancy, his old nurse, to\r\nwhom he sometimes sends his love.\r\n\r\nHis delight in home-letters is shown in such passages as:--\"But if you\r\nknew the glowing, unspeakable delight, which I felt at being certain\r\nthat my father and all of you were well, only four months ago, you would\r\nnot grudge the labour lost in keeping up the regular series of letters.\"\r\n\r\nOr again--his longing to return in words like these:--\"It is too\r\ndelightful to think that I shall see the leaves fall and hear the robin\r\nsing next autumn at Shrewsbury. My feelings are those of a schoolboy to\r\nthe smallest point; I doubt whether ever boy longed for his holidays as\r\nmuch as I do to see you all again. I am at present, although nearly half\r\nthe world is between me and home, beginning to arrange what I shall do,\r\nwhere I shall go during the first week.\"\r\n\r\nAnother feature in his letters is the surprise and delight with which\r\nhe hears of his collections and observations being of some use. It seems\r\nonly to have gradually occurred to him that he would ever be more than\r\ncollector of specimens and facts, of which the great men were to make\r\nuse. And even as to the value of his collections he seems to have had\r\nmuch doubt, for he wrote to Henslow in 1834:--\"I really began to think\r\nthat my collections were so poor that you were puzzled what to say; the\r\ncase is now quite on the opposite tack, for you are guilty of exciting\r\nall my vain feelings to a most comfortable pitch; if hard work will\r\natone for these thoughts, I vow it shall not be spared.\"\r\n\r\nAfter his return and settlement in London, he began to realise the value\r\nof what he had done, and wrote to Captain Fitz-Roy--\"However others\r\nmay look back to the 'Beagle's' voyage, now that the small disagreeable\r\nparts are well-nigh forgotten, I think it far the MOST FORTUNATE\r\nCIRCUMSTANCE IN MY LIFE that the chance afforded by your offer of taking\r\na Naturalist fell on me. I often have the most vivid and delightful\r\npictures of what I saw on board the 'Beagle' pass before my eyes.\r\nThese recollections, and what I learnt on Natural History, I would not\r\nexchange for twice ten thousand a year.\"\r\n\r\n[In selecting the following series of letters, I have been guided by the\r\nwish to give as much personal detail as possible. I have given only a\r\nfew scientific letters, to illustrate the way in which he worked, and\r\nhow he regarded his own results. In his 'Journal of Researches' he gives\r\nincidentally some idea of his personal character; the letters given in\r\nthe present chapter serve to amplify in fresher and more spontaneous\r\nwords that impression of his personality which the 'Journal' has given\r\nto so many readers.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO R.W. DARWIN. Bahia, or San Salvador, Brazils [February\r\n8, 1832].\r\n\r\nI find after the first page I have been writing to my sisters.\r\n\r\nMy dear Father,\r\n\r\nI am writing this on the 8th of February, one day's sail past St.\r\nJago (Cape de Verd), and intend taking the chance of meeting with a\r\nhomeward-bound vessel somewhere about the equator. The date, however,\r\nwill tell this whenever the opportunity occurs. I will now begin from\r\nthe day of leaving England, and give a short account of our progress.\r\nWe sailed, as you know, on the 27th of December, and have been fortunate\r\nenough to have had from that time to the present a fair and moderate\r\nbreeze. It afterwards proved that we had escaped a heavy gale in the\r\nChannel, another at Madeira, and another on [the] Coast of Africa. But\r\nin escaping the gale, we felt its consequences--a heavy sea. In the\r\nBay of Biscay there was a long and continuous swell, and the misery\r\nI endured from sea-sickness is far beyond what I ever guessed at. I\r\nbelieve you are curious about it. I will give you all my dear-bought\r\nexperience. Nobody who has only been to sea for twenty-four hours has\r\na right to say that sea-sickness is even uncomfortable. The real misery\r\nonly begins when you are so exhausted that a little exertion makes a\r\nfeeling of faintness come on. I found nothing but lying in my hammock\r\ndid me any good. I must especially except your receipt of raisins, which\r\nis the only food that the stomach will bear.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of January we were not many miles from Madeira, but as there\r\nwas a heavy sea running, and the island lay to windward, it was not\r\nthought worth while to beat up to it. It afterwards has turned out it\r\nwas lucky we saved ourselves the trouble. I was much too sick even to\r\nget up to see the distant outline. On the 6th, in the evening, we sailed\r\ninto the harbour of Santa Cruz. I now first felt even moderately well,\r\nand I was picturing to myself all the delights of fresh fruits growing\r\nin beautiful valleys, and reading Humboldt's descriptions of the\r\nisland's glorious views, when perhaps you may nearly guess at our\r\ndisappointment, when a small pale man informed us we must perform a\r\nstrict quarantine of twelve days. There was a death-like stillness in\r\nthe ship till the Captain cried \"up jib,\" and we left this long-wished\r\nfor place.\r\n\r\nWe were becalmed for a day between Teneriffe and the Grand Canary, and\r\nhere I first experienced any enjoyment. The view was glorious. The Peak\r\nof Teneriffe was seen amongst the clouds like another world. Our only\r\ndrawback was the extreme wish of visiting this glorious island. TELL\r\nEYTON NEVER TO FORGET EITHER THE CANARY ISLANDS OR SOUTH AMERICA; that I\r\nam sure it will well repay the necessary trouble, but that he must make\r\nup his mind to find a good deal of the latter. I feel certain he will\r\nregret it if he does not make the attempt. From Teneriffe to St. Jago\r\nthe voyage was extremely pleasant. I had a net astern the vessel which\r\ncaught great numbers of curious animals, and fully occupied my time in\r\nmy cabin, and on deck the weather was so delightful and clear, that the\r\nsky and water together made a picture. On the 16th we arrived at\r\nPort Praya, the capital of the Cape de Verds, and there we remained\r\ntwenty-three days, viz., till yesterday, the 7th of February. The time\r\nhas flown away most delightfully, indeed nothing can be pleasanter;\r\nexceedingly busy, and that business both a duty and a great delight. I\r\ndo not believe I have spent one half-hour idly since leaving Teneriffe.\r\nSt. Jago has afforded me an exceedingly rich harvest in several branches\r\nof Natural History. I find the descriptions scarcely worth anything\r\nof many of the commoner animals that inhabit the Tropics. I allude, of\r\ncourse, to those of the lower classes.\r\n\r\nGeologising in a volcanic country is most delightful; besides the\r\ninterest attached to itself, it leads you into most beautiful and\r\nretired spots. Nobody but a person fond of Natural History can imagine\r\nthe pleasure of strolling under cocoa-nuts in a thicket of bananas and\r\ncoffee-plants, and an endless number of wild flowers. And this island,\r\nthat has given me so much instruction and delight, is reckoned the most\r\nuninteresting place that we perhaps shall touch at during our voyage. It\r\ncertainly is generally very barren, but the valleys are more exquisitely\r\nbeautiful, from the very contrast. It is utterly useless to say anything\r\nabout the scenery; it would be as profitable to explain to a blind\r\nman colours, as to a person who has not been out of Europe, the total\r\ndissimilarity of a tropical view. Whenever I enjoy anything, I always\r\neither look forward to writing it down, either in my log-book (which\r\nincreases in bulk), or in a letter; so you must excuse raptures, and\r\nthose raptures badly expressed. I find my collections are increasing\r\nwonderfully, and from Rio I think I shall be obliged to send a cargo\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nAll the endless delays which we experienced at Plymouth have been most\r\nfortunate, as I verily believe no person ever went out better provided\r\nfor collecting and observing in the different branches of Natural\r\nHistory. In a multitude of counsellors I certainly found good. I find to\r\nmy great surprise that a ship is singularly comfortable for all sorts\r\nof work. Everything is so close at hand, and being cramped makes one so\r\nmethodical, that in the end I have been a gainer. I already have got to\r\nlook at going to sea as a regular quiet place, like going back to home\r\nafter staying away from it. In short, I find a ship a very comfortable\r\nhouse, with everything you want, and if it was not for sea-sickness the\r\nwhole world would be sailors. I do not think there is much danger of\r\nErasmus setting the example, but in case there should be, he may rely\r\nupon it he does not know one-tenth of the sufferings of sea-sickness.\r\n\r\nI like the officers much more than I did at first, especially Wickham,\r\nand young King and Stokes, and indeed all of them. The Captain continues\r\nsteadily very kind, and does everything in his power to assist me. We\r\nsee very little of each other when in harbour, our pursuits lead us\r\nin such different tracks. I never in my life met with a man who could\r\nendure nearly so great a share of fatigue. He works incessantly, and\r\nwhen apparently not employed, he is thinking. If he does not kill\r\nhimself, he will during this voyage do a wonderful quantity of work.\r\nI find I am very well, and stand the little heat we have had as yet\r\nas well as anybody. We shall soon have it in real earnest. We are now\r\nsailing for Fernando Noronha, off the coast of Brazil, where we shall\r\nnot stay very long, and then examine the shoals between there and Rio,\r\ntouching perhaps at Bahia. I will finish this letter when an opportunity\r\nof sending it occurs.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 26TH.\r\n\r\nAbout 280 miles from Bahia. On the 10th we spoke the packet \"Lyra\", on\r\nher voyage to Rio. I sent a short letter by her, to be sent to England\r\non [the] first opportunity. We have been singularly unlucky in not\r\nmeeting with any homeward-bound vessels, but I suppose [at] Bahia we\r\ncertainly shall be able to write to England. Since writing the first\r\npart of [this] letter nothing has occurred except crossing the Equator,\r\nand being shaved. This most disagreeable operation consists in having\r\nyour face rubbed with paint and tar, which forms a lather for a saw\r\nwhich represents the razor, and then being half drowned in a sail filled\r\nwith salt water. About 50 miles north of the line we touched at the\r\nrocks of St. Paul; this little speck (about 1/4 of a mile across) in the\r\nAtlantic has seldom been visited. It is totally barren, but is covered\r\nby hosts of birds; they were so unused to men that we found we could\r\nkill plenty with stones and sticks. After remaining some hours on the\r\nisland, we returned on board with the boat loaded with our prey. From\r\nthis we went to Fernando Noronha, a small island where the [Brazilians]\r\nsend their exiles. The landing there was attended with so much\r\ndifficulty owing [to] a heavy surf that the Captain determined to\r\nsail the next day after arriving. My one day on shore was exceedingly\r\ninteresting, the whole island is one single wood so matted together by\r\ncreepers that it is very difficult to move out of the beaten path.\r\nI find the Natural History of all these unfrequented spots most\r\nexceedingly interesting, especially the geology. I have written this\r\nmuch in order to save time at Bahia.\r\n\r\nDecidedly the most striking thing in the Tropics is the novelty of the\r\nvegetable forms. Cocoa-nuts could well be imagined from drawings, if\r\nyou add to them a graceful lightness which no European tree partakes of.\r\nBananas and plantains are exactly the same as those in hothouses, the\r\nacacias or tamarinds are striking from the blueness of their foliage;\r\nbut of the glorious orange trees, no description, no drawings, will give\r\nany just idea; instead of the sickly green of our oranges, the native\r\nones exceed the Portugal laurel in the darkness of their tint, and\r\ninfinitely exceed it in beauty of form. Cocoa-nuts, papaws, the light\r\ngreen bananas, and oranges, loaded with fruit, generally surround the\r\nmore luxuriant villages. Whilst viewing such scenes, one feels the\r\nimpossibility that any description would come near the mark, much less\r\nbe overdrawn.\r\n\r\nMARCH 1ST.\r\n\r\nBahia, or San Salvador. I arrived at this place on the 28th of February,\r\nand am now writing this letter after having in real earnest strolled\r\nin the forests of the new world. No person could imagine anything so\r\nbeautiful as the ancient town of Bahia, it is fairly embosomed in a\r\nluxuriant wood of beautiful trees, and situated on a steep bank, and\r\noverlooks the calm waters of the great bay of All Saints. The houses\r\nare white and lofty, and, from the windows being narrow and long, have\r\na very light and elegant appearance. Convents, porticos, and public\r\nbuildings, vary the uniformity of the houses; the bay is scattered over\r\nwith large ships; in short, and what can be said more, it is one of\r\nthe finest views in the Brazils. But the exquisite glorious pleasure of\r\nwalking amongst such flowers, and such trees, cannot be comprehended\r\nbut by those who have experienced it. Although in so low a latitude the\r\nlocality is not disagreeably hot, but at present it is very damp, for it\r\nis the rainy season. I find the climate as yet agrees admirably with me;\r\nit makes me long to live quietly for some time in such a country. If\r\nyou really want to have [an idea] of tropical countries, study Humboldt.\r\nSkip the scientific parts, and commence after leaving Teneriffe. My\r\nfeelings amount to admiration the more I read him. Tell Eyton (I find I\r\nam writing to my sisters!) how exceedingly I enjoy America, and that I\r\nam sure it will be a great pity if he does not make a start.\r\n\r\nThis letter will go on the 5th, and I am afraid will be some time before\r\nit reaches you; it must be a warning how in other parts of the world you\r\nmay be a long time without hearing. A year might by accident thus pass.\r\nAbout the 12th we start for Rio, but we remain some time on the way in\r\nsounding the Albrolhos shoals. Tell Eyton as far as my experience goes\r\nlet him study Spanish, French, drawing, and Humboldt. I do sincerely\r\nhope to hear of (if not to see him) in South America. I look forward to\r\nthe letters in Rio--till each one is acknowledged, mention its date in\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\nWe have beat all the ships in manoeuvring, so much so that the\r\ncommanding officer says, we need not follow his example; because we do\r\neverything better than his great ship. I begin to take great interest in\r\nnaval points, more especially now, as I find they all say we are the No.\r\n1 in South America. I suppose the Captain is a most excellent officer.\r\nIt was quite glorious to-day how we beat the \"Samarang\" in furling\r\nsails. It is quite a new thing for a \"sounding ship\" to beat a regular\r\nman-of-war; and yet the \"Beagle\" is not at all a particular ship.\r\nErasmus will clearly perceive it when he hears that in the night I have\r\nactually sat down in the sacred precincts of the quarter deck. You must\r\nexcuse these queer letters, and recollect they are generally written in\r\nthe evening after my day's work. I take more pains over my log-book, so\r\nthat eventually you will have a good account of all the places I visit.\r\nHitherto the voyage has answered ADMIRABLY to me, and yet I am now more\r\nfully aware of your wisdom in throwing cold water on the whole scheme;\r\nthe chances are so numerous of turning out quite the reverse; to such\r\nan extent do I feel this, that if my advice was asked by any person on\r\na similar occasion, I should be very cautious in encouraging him. I have\r\nnot time to write to anybody else, so send to Maer to let them know,\r\nthat in the midst of the glorious tropical scenery, I do not forget how\r\ninstrumental they were in placing me there. I will not rapturise again,\r\nbut I give myself great credit in not being crazy out of pure delight.\r\n\r\nGive my love to every soul at home, and to the Owens.\r\n\r\nI think one's affections, like other good things, flourish and increase\r\nin these tropical regions.\r\n\r\nThe conviction that I am walking in the New World is even yet marvellous\r\nin my own eyes, and I dare say it is little less so to you, the\r\nreceiving a letter from a son of yours in such a quarter.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Father, Your most affectionate son, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Botofogo Bay, near Rio de Janeiro, May,\r\n1832.\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nI have delayed writing to you and all my other friends till I arrived\r\nhere and had some little spare time. My mind has been, since leaving\r\nEngland, in a perfect HURRICANE of delight and astonishment, and to this\r\nhour scarcely a minute has passed in idleness...\r\n\r\nAt St. Jago my natural history and most delightful labours commenced.\r\nDuring the three weeks I collected a host of marine animals, and enjoyed\r\nmany a good geological walk. Touching at some islands, we sailed to\r\nBahia, and from thence to Rio, where I have already been some weeks. My\r\ncollections go on admirably in almost every branch. As for insects, I\r\ntrust I shall send a host of undescribed species to England. I believe\r\nthey have no small ones in the collections, and here this morning I have\r\ntaken minute Hydropori, Noterus, Colymbetes, Hydrophilus, Hydrobius,\r\nGromius, etc., etc., as specimens of fresh-water beetles. I am entirely\r\noccupied with land animals, as the beach is only sand. Spiders and the\r\nadjoining tribes have perhaps given me, from their novelty, the most\r\npleasure. I think I have already taken several new genera.\r\n\r\nBut Geology carries the day: it is like the pleasure of gambling.\r\nSpeculating, on first arriving, what the rocks may be, I often mentally\r\ncry out 3 to 1 tertiary against primitive; but the latter have hitherto\r\nwon all the bets. So much for the grand end of my voyage; in other\r\nrespects things are equally flourishing. My life, when at sea, is\r\nso quiet, that to a person who can employ himself, nothing can be\r\npleasanter; the beauty of the sky and brilliancy of the ocean together\r\nmake a picture. But when on shore, and wandering in the sublime forests,\r\nsurrounded by views more gorgeous than even Claude ever imagined,\r\nI enjoy a delight which none but those who have experienced it can\r\nunderstand. If it is to be done, it must be by studying Humboldt. At our\r\nancient snug breakfasts, at Cambridge, I little thought that the wide\r\nAtlantic would ever separate us; but it is a rare privilege that with\r\nthe body, the feelings and memory are not divided. On the contrary, the\r\npleasantest scenes in my life, many of which have been in Cambridge,\r\nrise from the contrast of the present, the more vividly in my\r\nimagination. Do you think any diamond beetle will ever give me so much\r\npleasure as our old friend crux major?... It is one of my most constant\r\namusements to draw pictures of the past; and in them I often see you\r\nand poor little Fran. Oh, Lord, and then old Dash, poor thing! Do you\r\nrecollect how you all tormented me about his beautiful tail?\r\n\r\n...Think when you are picking insects off a hawthorn-hedge on a fine May\r\nday (wretchedly cold, I have no doubt), think of me collecting amongst\r\npine-apples and orange-trees; whilst staining your fingers with dirty\r\nblackberries, think and be envious of ripe oranges. This is a proper\r\npiece of bravado, for I would walk through many a mile of sleet, snow,\r\nor rain to shake you by the hand. My dear old Fox, God bless you.\r\nBelieve me,\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Rio de Janeiro, May 18, 1832.\r\n\r\nMy dear Henslow,...\r\n\r\nTill arriving at Teneriffe (we did not touch at Madeira) I was scarcely\r\nout of my hammock, and really suffered more than you can well imagine\r\nfrom such a cause. At Santa Cruz, whilst looking amongst the clouds for\r\nthe Peak, and repeating to myself Humboldt's sublime descriptions, it\r\nwas announced we must perform twelve days' strict quarantine. We had\r\nmade a short passage, so \"Up jib,\" and away for St. Jago. You will say\r\nall this sounds very bad, and so it was; but from that to the present\r\ntime it has been nearly one scene of continual enjoyment. A net over the\r\nstern kept me at full work till we arrived at St. Jago. Here we spent\r\nthree most delightful weeks. The geology was pre-eminently interesting,\r\nand I believe quite new; there are some facts on a large scale of\r\nupraised coast (which is an excellent epoch for all the volcanic rocks\r\nto date from), that would interest Mr. Lyell.\r\n\r\nOne great source of perplexity to me is an utter ignorance whether I\r\nnote the right facts, and whether they are of sufficient importance to\r\ninterest others. In the one thing collecting I cannot go wrong. St. Jago\r\nis singularly barren, and produces few plants or insects, so that my\r\nhammer was my usual companion, and in its company most delightful\r\nhours I spent. On the coast I collected many marine animals, chiefly\r\ngasteropodous (I think some new). I examined pretty accurately a\r\nCaryopyllia, and, if my eyes are not bewitched, former descriptions have\r\nnot the slightest resemblance to the animal. I took several specimens\r\nof an Octopus which possessed a most marvellous power of changing\r\nits colours, equalling any chameleon, and evidently accommodating the\r\nchanges to the colour of the ground which it passed over. Yellowish\r\ngreen, dark brown, and red, were the prevailing colours; this\r\nfact appears to be new, as far as I can find out. Geology and the\r\ninvertebrate animals will be my chief object of pursuit through the\r\nwhole voyage.\r\n\r\nWe then sailed for Bahia, and touched at the rock of St. Paul. This is a\r\nserpentine formation. Is it not the only island in the Atlantic which\r\nis not volcanic? We likewise stayed a few hours at Fernando Noronha; a\r\ntremendous surf was running so that a boat was swamped, and the Captain\r\nwould not wait. I find my life on board when we are on blue water most\r\ndelightful, so very comfortable and quiet--it is almost impossible to\r\nbe idle, and that for me is saying a good deal. Nobody could possibly be\r\nbetter fitted in every respect for collecting than I am; many cooks\r\nhave not spoiled the broth this time. Mr. Brown's little hints about\r\nmicroscopes, etc., have been invaluable. I am well off in books, the\r\n'Dictionnaire Classique' IS MOST USEFUL. If you should think of any\r\nthing or book that would be useful to me, if you would write one line,\r\nE. Darwin, Wyndham Club, St. James's Street, he will procure them, and\r\nsend them with some other things to Monte Video, which for the next year\r\nwill be my headquarters.\r\n\r\nTouching at the Abrolhos, we arrived here on April 4th, when amongst\r\nothers I received your most kind letter. You may rely on it during the\r\nevening I thought of the many most happy hours I have spent with you in\r\nCambridge. I am now living at Botofogo, a village about a league from\r\nthe city, and shall be able to remain a month longer. The \"Beagle\" has\r\ngone back to Bahia, and will pick me up on its return. There is a most\r\nimportant error in the longitude of South America, to settle which this\r\nsecond trip has been undertaken. Our chronometers, at least sixteen\r\nof them, are going superbly; none on record have ever gone at all like\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA few days after arriving I started on an expedition of 150 miles to Rio\r\nMacao, which lasted eighteen days. Here I first saw a tropical forest in\r\nall its sublime grander--nothing but the reality can give any idea how\r\nwonderful, how magnificent the scene is. If I was to specify any one\r\nthing I should give the pre-eminence to the host of parasitical plants.\r\nYour engraving is exactly true, but underrates rather than exaggerates\r\nthe luxuriance. I never experienced such intense delight. I formerly\r\nadmired Humboldt, I now almost adore him; he alone gives any notion of\r\nthe feelings which are raised in the mind on first entering the Tropics.\r\nI am now collecting fresh-water and land animals; if what was told me in\r\nLondon is true, viz., that there are no small insects in the collections\r\nfrom the Tropics, I tell Entomologists to look out and have their pens\r\nready for describing. I have taken as minute (if not more so) as in\r\nEngland, Hydropori, Hygroti, Hydrobii, Pselaphi, Staphylini, Curculio,\r\netc. etc. It is exceedingly interesting observing the difference of\r\ngenera and species from those which I know, it is however much less\r\nthan I had expected. I am at present red-hot with spiders; they are\r\nvery interesting, and if I am not mistaken I have already taken some\r\nnew genera. I shall have a large box to send very soon to Cambridge, and\r\nwith that I will mention some more natural history particulars.\r\n\r\nThe Captain does everything in his power to assist me, and we get on\r\nvery well, but I thank my better fortune he has not made me a renegade\r\nto Whig principles. I would not be a Tory, if it was merely on account\r\nof their cold hearts about that scandal to Christian nations--Slavery. I\r\nam very good friends with all the officers.\r\n\r\nI have just returned from a walk, and as a specimen, how little the\r\ninsects are known. Noterus, according to the 'Dictionary Classique,'\r\ncontains solely three European species. I in one haul of my net took\r\nfive distinct species; is this not quite extraordinary?...\r\n\r\nTell Professor Sedgwick he does not know how much I am indebted to him\r\nfor the Welsh Expedition; it has given me an interest in Geology which\r\nI would not give up for any consideration. I do not think I ever spent\r\na more delightful three weeks than pounding the North-west Mountains. I\r\nlook forward to the geology about Monte Video as I hear there are slates\r\nthere, so I presume in that district I shall find the junctions of the\r\nPampas, and the enormous granite formation of Brazils. At Bahia the\r\npegmatite and gneiss in beds had the same direction, as observed by\r\nHumboldt, prevailing over Columbia, distant 1300 miles--is it not\r\nwonderful? Monte Video will be for a long time my direction. I hope\r\nyou will write again to me, there is nobody from whom I like receiving\r\nadvice so much as from you...Excuse this almost unintelligible letter,\r\nand believe me, my dear Henslow, with the warmest feelings of respect\r\nand friendship,\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.M. HERBERT. Botofogo Bay, Rio de Janeiro, June 1832.\r\n\r\nMy dear old Herbert,\r\n\r\nYour letter arrived here when I had given up all hopes of receiving\r\nanother, it gave me, therefore, an additional degree of pleasure. At\r\nsuch an interval of time and space one does learn to feel truly obliged\r\nto those who do not forget one. The memory when recalling scenes past\r\nby, affords to us EXILES one of the greatest pleasures. Often and often\r\nwhilst wandering amongst these hills do I think of Barmouth, and, I may\r\nadd, as often wish for such a companion. What a contrast does a walk\r\nin these two places afford; here abrupt and stony peaks are to the very\r\nsummit enclosed by luxuriant woods; the whole surface of the country,\r\nexcepting where cleared by man, is one impenetrable forest. How\r\ndifferent from Wales, with its sloping hills covered with turf, and\r\nits open valleys. I was not previously aware how intimately what may be\r\ncalled the moral part is connected with the enjoyment of scenery. I mean\r\nsuch ideas, as the history of the country, the utility of the produce,\r\nand more especially the happiness of the people living with them. Change\r\nthe English labourer into a poor slave, working for another, and you\r\nwill hardly recognise the same view. I am sure you will be glad to hear\r\nhow very well every part (Heaven forefend, except sea-sickness) of the\r\nexpedition has answered. We have already seen Teneriffe and the Great\r\nCanary; St. Jago where I spent three most delightful weeks, revelling\r\nin the delights of first naturalising a tropical volcanic island, and\r\nbesides other islands, the two celebrated ports in the Brazils, viz.\r\nBahia and Rio.\r\n\r\nI was in my hammock till we arrived at the Canaries, and I shall never\r\nforget the sublime impression the first view of Teneriffe made on\r\nmy mind. The first arriving into warm weather was most luxuriously\r\npleasant; the clear blue sky of the Tropics was no common change after\r\nthose accursed south-west gales at Plymouth. About the Line it became\r\nweltering hot. We spent one day at St. Paul's, a little group of rocks\r\nabout a quarter of a mile in circumference, peeping up in the midst of\r\nthe Atlantic. There was such a scene here. Wickham (1st Lieutenant) and\r\nI were the only two who landed with guns and geological hammers, etc.\r\nThe birds by myriads were too close to shoot; we then tried stones, but\r\nat last, proh pudor! my geological hammer was the instrument of death.\r\nWe soon loaded the boat with birds and eggs. Whilst we were so engaged,\r\nthe men in the boat were fairly fighting with the sharks for such\r\nmagnificent fish as you could not see in the London market. Our boat\r\nwould have made a fine subject for Snyders, such a medley of game it\r\ncontained. We have been here ten weeks, and shall now start for Monte\r\nVideo, when I look forward to many a gallop over the Pampas. I am\r\nashamed of sending such a scrambling letter, but if you were to see the\r\nheap of letters on my table you would understand the reason...\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear music flourishes so well in Cambridge; but it [is] as\r\nbarbarous to talk to me of \"celestial concerts\" as to a person in Arabia\r\nof cold water. In a voyage of this sort, if one gains many new and great\r\npleasures, on the other side the loss is not inconsiderable. How should\r\nyou like to be suddenly debarred from seeing every person and place,\r\nwhich you have ever known and loved, for five years? I do assure you I\r\nam occasionally \"taken aback\" by this reflection; and then for man or\r\nship it is not so easy to right again. Remember me most sincerely to the\r\nremnant of most excellent fellows whom I have the good luck to know in\r\nCambridge--I mean Whitley and Watkins. Tell Lowe I am even beneath his\r\ncontempt. I can eat salt beef and musty biscuits for dinner. See what a\r\nfall man may come to!\r\n\r\nMy direction for the next year and a half will be Monte Video.\r\n\r\nGod bless you, my very dear old Herbert. May you always be happy and\r\nprosperous is my most cordial wish.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO F. WATKINS. Monte Video, River Plata, August 18, 1832.\r\n\r\nMy dear Watkins,\r\n\r\nI do not feel very sure you will think a letter from one so far distant\r\nwill be worth having; I write therefore on the selfish principle of\r\ngetting an answer. In the different countries we visit the entire\r\nnewness and difference from England only serves to make more keen the\r\nrecollection of its scenes and delights. In consequence the pleasure of\r\nthinking of, and hearing from one's former friends, does indeed become\r\ngreat. Recollect this, and some long winter's evening sit down and send\r\nme a long account of yourself and our friends; both what you have, and\r\nwhat [you] intend doing; otherwise in three or four more years when I\r\nreturn you will be all strangers to me. Considering how many months\r\nhave passed, we have not in the \"Beagle\" made much way round the world.\r\nHitherto everything has well repaid the necessary trouble and loss of\r\ncomfort. We stayed three weeks at the Cape de Verds; it was no ordinary\r\npleasure rambling over the plains of lava under a tropical sun, but when\r\nI first entered on and beheld the luxuriant vegetation in Brazil, it\r\nwas realizing the visions in the 'Arabian Nights.' The brilliancy of the\r\nscenery throws one into a delirium of delight, and a beetle hunter is\r\nnot likely soon to awaken from it, when whichever way he turns fresh\r\ntreasures meet his eye. At Rio de Janeiro three months passed away like\r\nso many weeks. I made a most delightful excursion during this time of\r\n150 miles into the country. I stayed at an estate which is the last of\r\nthe cleared ground, behind is one vast impenetrable forest. It is almost\r\nimpossible to imagine the quietude of such a life. Not a human being\r\nwithin some miles interrupts the solitude. To seat oneself amidst the\r\ngloom of such a forest on a decaying trunk, and then think of home, is a\r\npleasure worth taking some trouble for.\r\n\r\nWe are at present in a much less interesting country. One single walk\r\nover the undulatory turf plain shows everything which is to be seen.\r\nIt is not at all unlike Cambridgeshire, only that every hedge, tree and\r\nhill must be leveled, and arable land turned into pasture. All South\r\nAmerica is in such an unsettled state that we have not entered one port\r\nwithout some sort of disturbance. At Buenos Ayres a shot came whistling\r\nover our heads; it is a noise I had never before heard, but I found I\r\nhad an instinctive knowledge of what it meant. The other day we landed\r\nour men here, and took possession, at the request of the inhabitants, of\r\nthe central fort. We philosophers do not bargain for this sort of work,\r\nand I hope there will be no more. We sail in the course of a day or two\r\nto survey the coast of Patagonia; as it is entirely unknown, I expect a\r\ngood deal of interest. But already do I perceive the grievous difference\r\nbetween sailing on these seas and the Equinoctial ocean. In the \"Ladies'\r\nGulf,\" as the Spaniard's call it, it is so luxurious to sit on deck and\r\nenjoy the coolness of the night, and admire the new constellations of\r\nthe South...I wonder when we shall ever meet again; but be it when it\r\nmay, few things will give me greater pleasure than to see you again, and\r\ntalk over the long time we have passed together.\r\n\r\nIf you were to meet me at present I certainly should be looked at like a\r\nwild beast, a great grizzly beard and flushing jacket would disfigure\r\nan angel. Believe me, my dear Watkins, with the warmest feelings of\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nEver yours, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. April 11, 1833.\r\n\r\nMy dear Henslow,\r\n\r\nWe are now running up from the Falkland Islands to the Rio Negro (or\r\nColorado). The \"Beagle\" will proceed to Monte Video; but if it can be\r\nmanaged I intend staying at the former place. It is now some months\r\nsince we have been at a civilised port; nearly all this time has been\r\nspent in the most southern part of Tierra del Fuego. It is a detestable\r\nplace; gales succeed gales with such short intervals that it is\r\ndifficult to do anything. We were twenty-three days off Cape Horn, and\r\ncould by no means get to the westward. The last and final gale before we\r\ngave up the attempt was unusually severe. A sea stove one of the boats,\r\nand there was so much water on the decks that every place was afloat;\r\nnearly all the paper for drying plants is spoiled, and half of this\r\ncurious collection.\r\n\r\nWe at last ran into harbour, and in the boats got to the west by the\r\ninland channels. As I was one of this party I was very glad of it.\r\nWith two boats we went about 300 miles, and thus I had an excellent\r\nopportunity of geologising and seeing much of the savages. The Fuegians\r\nare in a more miserable state of barbarism than I had expected ever to\r\nhave seen a human being. In this inclement country they are absolutely\r\nnaked, and their temporary houses are like what children make in\r\nsummer with boughs of trees. I do not think any spectacle can be more\r\ninteresting than the first sight of man in his primitive wildness. It\r\nis an interest which cannot well be imagined until it is experienced.\r\nI shall never forget this when entering Good Success Bay--the yell with\r\nwhich a party received us. They were seated on a rocky point, surrounded\r\nby the dark forest of beech; as they threw their arms wildly round their\r\nheads, and their long hair streaming, they seemed the troubled spirits\r\nof another world. The climate in some respects is a curious mixture of\r\nseverity and mildness; as far as regards the animal kingdom, the\r\nformer character prevails; I have in consequence not added much to my\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nThe Geology of this part of Tierra del Fuego was, as indeed every place\r\nis, to me very interesting. The country is non-fossiliferous, and a\r\ncommon-place succession of granitic rocks and slates; attempting to\r\nmake out the relation of cleavage, strata, etc., etc., was my chief\r\namusement. The mineralogy, however, of some of the rocks will, I think,\r\nbe curious from their resemblance to those of volcanic origin....\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Tierra del Fuego we sailed to the Falklands. I forgot to\r\nmention the fate of the Fuegians whom we took back to their country.\r\nThey had become entirely European in their habits and wishes, so much\r\nso that the younger one had forgotten his own language, and their\r\ncountrymen paid but very little attention to them. We built houses for\r\nthem and planted gardens, but by the time we return again on our passage\r\nround the Horn, I think it will be very doubtful how much of their\r\nproperty will be left unstolen.\r\n\r\n...When I am sea-sick and miserable, it is one of my highest\r\nconsolations to picture the future when we again shall be pacing\r\ntogether the roads round Cambridge. That day is a weary long way off.\r\nWe have another cruise to make to Tierra del Fuego next summer, and then\r\nour voyage round the world will really commence. Captain Fitz-Roy has\r\npurchased a large schooner of 170 tons. In many respects it will be a\r\ngreat advantage having a consort--perhaps it may somewhat shorten our\r\ncruise, which I most cordially hope it may. I trust, however, that\r\nthe Coral Reefs and various animals of the Pacific may keep up my\r\nresolution. Remember me most kindly to Mrs. Henslow and all other\r\nfriends; I am a true lover of Alma Mater and all its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Henslow, Your affectionate and most obliged friend,\r\nCHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MISS C. DARWIN. Maldonado, Rio Plata, May 22, 1833.\r\n\r\n...The following business piece is to my father. Having a servant of\r\nmy own would be a really great addition to my comfort. For these two\r\nreasons: as at present the Captain has appointed one of the men always\r\nto be with me, but I do not think it just thus to take a seaman out of\r\nthe ship; and, secondly, when at sea I am rather badly off for any one\r\nto wait on me. The man is willing to be my servant, and all the expenses\r\nwould be under 60 pounds per annum. I have taught him to shoot and skin\r\nbirds, so that in my main object he is very useful. I have now left\r\nEngland nearly a year and a half, and I find my expenses are not above\r\n200 pounds per annum; so that, it being hopeless (from time) to write\r\nfor permission, I have come to the conclusion that you would allow me\r\nthis expense. But I have not yet resolved to ask the Captain, and the\r\nchances are even that he would not be willing to have an additional man\r\nin the ship. I have mentioned this because for a long time I have been\r\nthinking about it.\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\nI have just received a bundle more letters. I do not know how to thank\r\nyou all sufficiently. One from Catherine, February 8th, another from\r\nSusan, March 3rd, together with notes from Caroline and from my father;\r\ngive my best love to my father. I almost cried for pleasure at receiving\r\nit; it was very kind thinking of writing to me. My letters are both\r\nfew, short, and stupid in return for all yours; but I always ease my\r\nconscience by considering the Journal as a long letter. If I can\r\nmanage it, I will, before doubling the Horn, send the rest. I am quite\r\ndelighted to find the hide of the Megatherium has given you all some\r\nlittle interest in my employments. These fragments are not, however,\r\nby any means the most valuable of the geological relics. I trust and\r\nbelieve that the time spent in this voyage, if thrown away for all other\r\nrespects, will produce its full worth in Natural History; and it appears\r\nto me the doing what LITTLE we can to increase the general stock\r\nof knowledge is as respectable an object of life as one can in any\r\nlikelihood pursue. It is more the result of such reflections (as I have\r\nalready said) than much immediate pleasure which now makes me continue\r\nthe voyage, together with the glorious prospect of the future, when\r\npassing the Straits of Magellan, we have in truth the world before us.\r\nThink of the Andes, the luxuriant forest of Guayaquil, the islands\r\nof the South Sea, and New South Wales. How many magnificent and\r\ncharacteristic views, how many and curious tribes of men we shall see!\r\nWhat fine opportunities for geology and for studying the infinite host\r\nof living beings! Is not this a prospect to keep up the most flagging\r\nspirit? If I was to throw it away, I don't think I should ever rest\r\nquiet in my grave. I certainly should be a ghost and haunt the British\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nHow famously the Ministers appear to be going on. I always much enjoy\r\npolitical gossip and what you at home think will, etc., etc., take\r\nplace. I steadily read up the weekly paper, but it is not sufficient\r\nto guide one's opinion; and I find it a very painful state not to be as\r\nobstinate as a pig in politics. I have watched how steadily the general\r\nfeeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What\r\na proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which\r\nutterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after\r\nliving in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only\r\nalteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro\r\ncharacter. It is impossible to see a negro and not feel kindly towards\r\nhim; such cheerful, open, honest expressions and such fine muscular\r\nbodies. I never saw any of the diminutive Portuguese, with their\r\nmurderous countenances, without almost wishing for Brazil to follow the\r\nexample of Hayti; and, considering the enormous healthy-looking black\r\npopulation, it will be wonderful if, at some future day, it does not\r\ntake place. There is at Rio a man (I know not his title) who has a\r\nlarge salary to prevent (I believe) the landing of slaves; he lives\r\nat Botofogo, and yet that was the bay where, during my residence, the\r\ngreater number of smuggled slaves were landed. Some of the Anti-Slavery\r\npeople ought to question about his office; it was the subject of\r\nconversation at Rio amongst the lower English...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.M. HERBERT. Maldonado, Rio Plata, June 2, 1833.\r\n\r\nMy dear Herbert,\r\n\r\nI have been confined for the last three days to a miserable dark room,\r\nin an old Spanish house, from the torrents of rain; I am not, therefore,\r\nin very good trim for writing; but, defying the blue devils, I will send\r\nyou a few lines, if it is merely to thank you very sincerely for writing\r\nto me. I received your letter, dated December 1st, a short time since.\r\nWe are now passing part of the winter in the Rio Plata, after having\r\nhad a hard summer's work to the south. Tierra del Fuego is indeed a\r\nmiserable place; the ceaseless fury of the gales is quite tremendous.\r\nOne evening we saw old Cape Horn, and three weeks afterwards we were\r\nonly thirty miles to windward of it. It is a grand spectacle to see all\r\nnature thus raging; but Heaven knows every one in the \"Beagle\" has seen\r\nenough in this one summer to last them their natural lives.\r\n\r\nThe first place we landed at was Good Success Bay. It was here Banks\r\nand Solander met such disasters on ascending one of the mountains. The\r\nweather was tolerably fine, and I enjoyed some walks in a wild country,\r\nlike that behind Barmouth. The valleys are impenetrable from the\r\nentangled woods, but the higher parts, near the limits of perpetual\r\nsnow, are bare. From some of these hills the scenery, from its savage,\r\nsolitary character, was most sublime. The only inhabitant of these\r\nheights is the guanaco, and with its shrill neighing it often breaks the\r\nstillness. The consciousness that no European foot had ever trod much\r\nof this ground added to the delight of these rambles. How often and how\r\nvividly have many of the hours spent at Barmouth come before my mind! I\r\nlook back to that time with no common pleasure; at this moment I can see\r\nyou seated on the hill behind the inn, almost as plainly as if you were\r\nreally there. It is necessary to be separated from all which one\r\nhas been accustomed to, to know how properly to treasure up such\r\nrecollections, and at this distance, I may add, how properly to esteem\r\nsuch as yourself, my dear old Herbert. I wonder when I shall ever\r\nsee you again. I hope it may be, as you say, surrounded with heaps of\r\nparchment; but then there must be, sooner or later, a dear little lady\r\nto take care of you and your house. Such a delightful vision makes me\r\nquite envious. This is a curious life for a regular shore-going person\r\nsuch as myself; the worst part of it is its extreme length. There\r\nis certainly a great deal of high enjoyment, and on the contrary a\r\ntolerable share of vexation of spirit. Everything, however, shall bend\r\nto the pleasure of grubbing up old bones, and captivating new animals.\r\nBy the way, you rank my Natural History labours far too high. I am\r\nnothing more than a lions' provider: I do not feel at all sure that they\r\nwill not growl and finally destroy me.\r\n\r\nIt does one's heart good to hear how things are going on in England.\r\nHurrah for the honest Whigs! I trust they will soon attack that\r\nmonstrous stain on our boasted liberty, Colonial Slavery. I have seen\r\nenough of Slavery and the dispositions of the negroes, to be thoroughly\r\ndisgusted with the lies and nonsense one hears on the subject in\r\nEngland. Thank God, the cold-hearted Tories, who, as J. Mackintosh used\r\nto say, have no enthusiasm, except against enthusiasm, have for the\r\npresent run their race. I am sorry, by your letter, to hear you have not\r\nbeen well, and that you partly attribute it to want of exercise. I wish\r\nyou were here amongst the green plains; we would take walks which would\r\nrival the Dolgelly ones, and you should tell stories, which I would\r\nbelieve, even to a CUBIC FATHOM OF PUDDING. Instead I must take my\r\nsolitary ramble, think of Cambridge days, and pick up snakes, beetles\r\nand toads. Excuse this short letter (you know I never studied 'The\r\nComplete Letter-writer'), and believe me, my dear Herbert,\r\n\r\nYour affectionate friend, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. East Falkland Island, March, 1834.\r\n\r\n...I am quite charmed with Geology, but like the wise animal between\r\ntwo bundles of hay, I do not know which to like the best; the old\r\ncrystalline group of rocks, or the softer and fossiliferous beds. When\r\npuzzling about stratifications, etc., I feel inclined to cry \"a fig for\r\nyour big oysters, and your bigger megatheriums.\" But then when digging\r\nout some fine bones, I wonder how any man can tire his arms with\r\nhammering granite. By the way I have not one clear idea about cleavage,\r\nstratification, lines of upheaval. I have no books which tell me much,\r\nand what they do I cannot apply to what I see. In consequence I draw\r\nmy own conclusions, and most gloriously ridiculous ones they are, I\r\nsometimes fancy...Can you throw any light into my mind by telling me\r\nwhat relation cleavage and planes of deposition bear to each other?\r\n\r\nAnd now for my second SECTION, Zoology. I have chiefly been employed\r\nin preparing myself for the South Sea by examining the polypi of the\r\nsmaller Corallines in these latitudes. Many in themselves are very\r\ncurious, and I think are quite undescribed; there was one appalling one,\r\nallied to a Flustra, which I dare say I mentioned having found to the\r\nnorthward, where the cells have a movable organ (like a vulture's head,\r\nwith a dilatable beak), fixed on the edge. But what is of more general\r\ninterest is the unquestionable (as it appears to me) existence of\r\nanother species of ostrich, besides the Struthio rhea. All the Gauchos\r\nand Indians state it is the case, and I place the greatest faith in\r\ntheir observations. I have the head, neck, piece of skin, feathers, and\r\nlegs of one. The differences are chiefly in the colour of the feathers\r\nand scales on legs, being feathered below the knees, nidification, and\r\ngeographical distribution. So much for what I have lately done; the\r\nprospect before me is full of sunshine, fine weather, glorious scenery,\r\nthe geology of the Andes, plains abounding with organic remains (which\r\nperhaps I may have the good luck to catch in the very act of moving),\r\nand lastly, an ocean, its shores abounding with life, so that, if\r\nnothing unforeseen happens, I will stick to the voyage, although for\r\nwhat I can see this may last till we return a fine set of white-headed\r\nold gentlemen. I have to thank you most cordially for sending me the\r\nbooks. I am now reading the Oxford 'Report' (The second meeting of the\r\nBritish Association was held at Oxford in 1832, the following year\r\nit was at Cambridge.); the whole account of your proceedings is most\r\nglorious; you remaining in England cannot well imagine how excessively\r\ninteresting I find the reports. I am sure from my own thrilling\r\nsensations when reading them, that they cannot fail to have an excellent\r\neffect upon all those residing in distant colonies, and who have\r\nlittle opportunity of seeing the periodicals. My hammer has flown with\r\nredoubled force on the devoted blocks; as I thought over the eloquence\r\nof the Cambridge President, I hit harder and harder blows. I hope to\r\ngive my arms strength for the Cordilleras. You will send me through\r\nCapt. Beaufort a copy of the Cambridge 'Report.'\r\n\r\nI have forgotten to mention that for some time past, and for the future,\r\nI will put a pencil cross on the pill-boxes containing insects, as these\r\nalone will require being kept particularly dry; it may perhaps save you\r\nsome trouble. When this letter will go I do not know, as this little\r\nseat of discord has lately been embroiled by a dreadful scene of murder,\r\nand at present there are more prisoners than inhabitants. If a merchant\r\nvessel is chartered to take them to Rio, I will send some specimens\r\n(especially my few plants and seeds). Remember me to all my Cambridge\r\nfriends. I love and treasure up every recollection of dear old\r\nCambridge. I am much obliged to you for putting my name down to poor\r\nRamsay's monument; I never think of him without the warmest admiration.\r\nFarewell, my dear Henslow.\r\n\r\nBelieve me your most obliged and affectionate friend, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MISS C. DARWIN. East Falkland Island, April 6, 1834.\r\n\r\nMy dear Catherine,\r\n\r\nWhen this letter will reach you I know not, but probably some man-of-war\r\nwill call here before, in the common course of events, I should have\r\nanother opportunity of writing....\r\n\r\nAfter visiting some of the southern islands, we beat up through the\r\nmagnificent scenery of the Beagle Channel to Jemmy Button's country.\r\n(Jemmy Button, York Minster, and Fuegia Basket, were natives of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego, brought to England by Captain Fitz-Roy in his former voyage,\r\nand restored to their country by him in 1832.) We could hardly recognise\r\npoor Jemmy. Instead of the clean, well-dressed stout lad we left him,\r\nwe found him a naked, thin, squalid savage. York and Fuegia had moved to\r\ntheir own country some months ago, the former having stolen all Jemmy's\r\nclothes. Now he had nothing except a bit of blanket round his waist.\r\nPoor Jemmy was very glad to see us, and, with his usual good feeling,\r\nbrought several presents (otter-skins, which are most valuable to\r\nthemselves) for his old friends. The Captain offered to take him to\r\nEngland, but this, to our surprise, he at once refused. In the evening\r\nhis young wife came alongside and showed us the reason. He was quite\r\ncontented. Last year, in the height of his indignation, he said \"his\r\ncountry people no sabe nothing--damned fools\"--now they were very good\r\npeople, with TOO much to eat, and all the luxuries of life. Jemmy and\r\nhis wife paddled away in their canoe loaded with presents, and very\r\nhappy. The most curious thing is, that Jemmy, instead of recovering his\r\nown language, has taught all his friends a little English. \"J. Button's\r\ncanoe\" and \"Jemmy's wife come,\" \"Give me knife,\" etc., was said by\r\nseveral of them.\r\n\r\nWe then bore away for this island--this little miserable seat of\r\ndiscord. We found that the Gauchos, under pretence of a revolution, had\r\nmurdered and plundered all the Englishmen whom they could catch, and\r\nsome of their own countrymen. All the economy at home makes the foreign\r\nmovements of England most contemptible. How different from old Spain.\r\nHere we, dog-in-the-manger fashion, seize an island, and leave to\r\nprotect it a Union Jack; the possessor has, of course, been murdered;\r\nwe now send a lieutenant with four sailors, without authority or\r\ninstructions. A man-of-war, however, ventured to leave a party of\r\nmarines, and by their assistance, and the treachery of some of the\r\nparty, the murderers have all been taken, there being now as many\r\nprisoners as inhabitants. This island must some day become a very\r\nimportant halting-place in the most turbulent sea in the world. It is\r\nmid-way between Australia and the South Sea to England; between Chili,\r\nPeru, etc., and the Rio Plata and the Rio de Janeiro. There are fine\r\nharbours, plenty of fresh water, and good beef. It would doubtless\r\nproduce the coarser vegetables. In other respects it is a wretched\r\nplace. A little time since, I rode across the island, and returned in\r\nfour days. My excursion would have been longer, but during the whole\r\ntime it blew a gale of wind, with hail and snow. There is no firewood\r\nbigger than heath, and the whole country is, more or less an elastic\r\npeat-bog. Sleeping out at night was too miserable work to endure it for\r\nall the rocks in South America.\r\n\r\nWe shall leave this scene of iniquity in two or three days, and go to\r\nthe Rio de la Sta. Cruz. One of the objects is to look at the ship's\r\nbottom. We struck heavily on an unknown rock off Port Desire, and some\r\nof her copper is torn off. After this is repaired the Captain has a\r\nglorious scheme; it is to go to the very head of this river, that is\r\nprobably to the Andes. It is quite unknown; the Indians tell us it is\r\ntwo or three hundred yards broad, and horses can nowhere ford it. I\r\ncannot imagine anything more interesting. Our plans then are to go\r\nto Fort Famine, and there we meet the \"Adventure\", who is employed in\r\nmaking the Chart of the Falklands. This will be in the middle of winter,\r\nso I shall see Tierra del Fuego in her white drapery. We leave the\r\nstraits to enter the Pacific by the Barbara Channel, one very little\r\nknown, and which passes close to the foot of Mount Sarmiento (the\r\nhighest mountain in the south, excepting Mt.!! Darwin!!). We then shall\r\nscud away for Concepcion in Chili. I believe the ship must once again\r\nsteer southward, but if any one catches me there again, I will give him\r\nleave to hang me up as a scarecrow for all future naturalists. I long\r\nto be at work in the Cordilleras, the geology of this side, which\r\nI understand pretty well is so intimately connected with periods of\r\nviolence in that great chain of mountains. The future is, indeed, to\r\nme a brilliant prospect. You say its very brilliancy frightens you; but\r\nreally I am very careful; I may mention as a proof, in all my rambles I\r\nhave never had any one accident or scrape...Continue in your good custom\r\nof writing plenty of gossip; I much like hearing all about all things.\r\nRemember me most kindly to Uncle Jos, and to all the Wedgwoods. Tell\r\nCharlotte (their married names sound downright unnatural) I should like\r\nto have written to her, to have told her how well everything is going\r\non; but it would only have been a transcript of this letter, and I\r\nhave a host of animals at this minute surrounding me which all require\r\nembalming and numbering. I have not forgotten the comfort I received\r\nthat day at Maer, when my mind was like a swinging pendulum. Give my\r\nbest love to my father. I hope he will forgive all my extravagance, but\r\nnot as a Christian, for then I suppose he would send me no more money.\r\n\r\nGood-bye, dear, to you, and all your goodly sisterhood.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate brother, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nMy love to Nancy (His old nurse.); tell her, if she was now to see me\r\nwith my great beard, she would think I was some worthy Solomon, come to\r\nsell the trinkets.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. WHITLEY. Valparaiso, July 23, 1834.\r\n\r\nMy dear Whitley,\r\n\r\nI have long intended writing, just to put you in mind that there is a\r\ncertain hunter of beetles, and pounder of rocks still in existence. Why\r\nI have not done so before I know not, but it will serve me right if you\r\nhave quite forgotten me. It is a very long time since I have heard any\r\nCambridge news; I neither know where you are living or what you are\r\ndoing. I saw your name down as one of the indefatigable guardians of the\r\neighteen hundred philosophers. I was delighted to see this, for when\r\nwe last left Cambridge you were at sad variance with poor science; you\r\nseemed to think her a public prostitute working for popularity. If your\r\nopinions are the same as formerly, you would agree most admirably with\r\nCaptain Fitz-Roy,--the object of his most devout abhorrence is one of\r\nthe d--d scientific Whigs. As captains of men-of-war are the greatest\r\nmen going, far greater than kings or schoolmasters, I am obliged to tell\r\nhim everything in my own favour. I have often said I once had a very\r\ngood friend, an out-and-out Tory, and we managed to get on very well\r\ntogether. But he is very much inclined to doubt if ever I really was so\r\nmuch honoured; at present we hear scarcely anything about politics; this\r\nsaves a great deal of trouble, for we all stick to our former opinions\r\nrather more obstinately than before, and can give rather fewer reasons\r\nfor doing so.\r\n\r\nI do hope you will write to me: ('H.M.S. \"Beagle\", S. American Station'\r\nwill find me). I should much like to hear in what state you are both in\r\nbody and mind. ?Quien Sabe? as the people say here (and God knows they\r\nwell may, for they do know little enough), if you are not a married man,\r\nand may be nursing, as Miss Austen says, little olive branches, little\r\npledges of mutual affection. Eheu! Eheu! this puts me in mind of former\r\nvisions of glimpses into futurity, where I fancied I saw retirement,\r\ngreen cottages, and white petticoats. What will become of me hereafter\r\nI know not; I feel like a ruined man, who does not see or care how to\r\nextricate himself. That this voyage must come to a conclusion my\r\nreason tells me, but otherwise I see no end to it. It is impossible not\r\nbitterly to regret the friends and other sources of pleasure one leaves\r\nbehind in England; in place of it there is much solid enjoyment, some\r\npresent, but more in anticipation, when the ideas gained during the\r\nvoyage can be compared to fresh ones. I find in Geology a never-failing\r\ninterest, as it has been remarked, it creates the same grand ideas\r\nrespecting this world which Astronomy does for the universe. We have\r\nseen much fine scenery; that of the Tropics in its glory and luxuriance\r\nexceeds even the language of Humboldt to describe. A Persian writer\r\ncould alone do justice to it, and if he succeeded he would in England be\r\ncalled the 'Grandfather of all liars.'\r\n\r\nBut I have seen nothing which more completely astonished me than the\r\nfirst sight of a savage. It was a naked Fuegian, his long hair blowing\r\nabout, his face besmeared with paint. There is in their countenances\r\nan expression which I believe, to those who have not seen it, must\r\nbe inconceivably wild. Standing on a rock he uttered tones and made\r\ngesticulations, than which the cries of domestic animals are far more\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\nWhen I return to England, you must take me in hand with respect to the\r\nfine arts. I yet recollect there was a man called Raffaelle Sanctus. How\r\ndelightful it will be once again to see, in the Fitzwilliam, Titian's\r\nVenus. How much more than delightful to go to some good concert or fine\r\nopera. These recollections will not do. I shall not be able to-morrow\r\nto pick out the entrails of some small animal with half my usual\r\ngusto. Pray tell me some news about Cameron, Watkins, Marindin, the two\r\nThompsons of Trinity, Lowe, Heaviside, Matthew. Herbert I have heard\r\nfrom. How is Henslow getting on? and all other good friends of dear\r\nCambridge? Often and often do I think over those past hours, so many of\r\nwhich have been passed in your company. Such can never return, but their\r\nrecollection can never die away.\r\n\r\nGod bless you, my dear Whitley, Believe me, your most sincere friend,\r\nCHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MISS C. DARWIN. Valparaiso, November 8, 1834.\r\n\r\nMy dear Catherine,\r\n\r\nMy last letter was rather a gloomy one, for I was not very well when I\r\nwrote it. Now everything is as bright as sunshine. I am quite well again\r\nafter being a second time in bed for a fortnight. Captain Fitz-Roy very\r\ngenerously has delayed the ship ten days on my account, and without at\r\nthe time telling me for what reason.\r\n\r\nWe have had some strange proceedings on board the \"Beagle\", but which\r\nhave ended most capitally for all hands. Captain Fitz-Roy has for\r\nthe last two months been working EXTREMELY hard, and at the same time\r\nconstantly annoyed by interruptions from officers of other ships; the\r\nselling the schooner and its consequences were very vexatious; the\r\ncold manner the Admiralty (solely I believe because he is a Tory) have\r\ntreated him, and a thousand other, etc. etc.'s, has made him very thin\r\nand unwell. This was accompanied by a morbid depression of spirits, and\r\na loss of all decision and resolution... All that Bynoe [the Surgeon]\r\ncould say, that it was merely the effect of bodily health and exhaustion\r\nafter such application, would not do; he invalided, and Wickham was\r\nappointed to the command. By the instructions Wickham could only finish\r\nthe survey of the southern part, and would then have been obliged to\r\nreturn direct to England. The grief on board the \"Beagle\" about the\r\nCaptain's decision was universal and deeply felt; one great source\r\nof his annoyment was the feeling it impossible to fulfil the whole\r\ninstructions; from his state of mind it never occurred to him that the\r\nvery instructions ordered him to do as much of the West coast AS HE HAS\r\nTIME FOR, and then proceed across the Pacific.\r\n\r\nWickham (very disinterestedly giving up his own promotion) urged this\r\nmost strongly, stated that when he took the command nothing should\r\ninduce him to go to Tierra del Fuego again; and then asked the Captain\r\nwhat would be gained by his resignation? why not do the more useful\r\npart, and return as commanded by the Pacific. The Captain at last, to\r\nevery one's joy, consented, and the resignation was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nHurrah! hurrah! it is fixed the \"Beagle\" shall not go one mile south of\r\nCape Tres Montes (about 200 miles south of Chiloe), and from that point\r\nto Valparaiso will be finished in about five months. We shall examine\r\nthe Chonos Archipelago, entirely unknown, and the curious inland sea\r\nbehind Chiloe. For me it is glorious. Cape Tres Montes is the most\r\nsouthern point where there is much geological interest, as there the\r\nmodern beds end. The Captain then talks of crossing the Pacific; but\r\nI think we shall persuade him to finish the Coast of Peru, where the\r\nclimate is delightful, the country hideously sterile, but abounding with\r\nthe highest interest to a geologist. For the first time since leaving\r\nEngland I now see a clear and not so distant prospect of returning to\r\nyou all: crossing the Pacific, and from Sydney home, will not take much\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Captain invalided I at once determined to leave the\r\n\"Beagle\", but it was quite absurd what a revolution in five minutes was\r\neffected in all my feelings. I have long been grieved and most sorry\r\nat the interminable length of the voyage (although I never would have\r\nquitted it); but the minute it was all over, I could not make up my mind\r\nto return. I could not give up all the geological castles in the air\r\nwhich I had been building up for the last two years. One whole night\r\nI tried to think over the pleasure of seeing Shrewsbury again, but the\r\nbarren plains of Peru gained the day. I made the following scheme (I\r\nknow you will abuse me, and perhaps if I had put it in execution, my\r\nfather would have sent a mandamus after me); it was to examine the\r\nCordilleras of Chili during this summer, and in winter go from port\r\nto port on the coast of Peru to Lima, returning this time next year\r\nto Valparaiso, cross the Cordilleras to Buenos Ayres, and take ship\r\nto England. Would not this have been a fine excursion, and in sixteen\r\nmonths I should have been with you all? To have endured Tierra del Fuego\r\nand not seen the Pacific would have been miserable...\r\n\r\nI go on board to-morrow; I have been for the last six weeks in\r\nCorfield's house. You cannot imagine what a kind friend I have\r\nfound him. He is universally liked, and respected by the natives and\r\nforeigners. Several Chileno Signoritas are very obligingly anxious to\r\nbecome the signoras of this house. Tell my father I have kept my promise\r\nof being extravagant in Chili. I have drawn a bill of 100 pounds (had it\r\nnot better be notified to Messrs. Robarts & Co.); 50 pounds goes to the\r\nCaptain for the ensuing year, and 30 pounds I take to sea for the small\r\nports; so that bona fide I have not spent 180 pounds during these last\r\nfour months. I hope not to draw another bill for six months. All the\r\nforegoing particulars were only settled yesterday. It has done me more\r\ngood than a pint of medicine, and I have not been so happy for the last\r\nyear. If it had not been for my illness, these four months in Chili\r\nwould have been very pleasant. I have had ill luck, however, in only one\r\nlittle earthquake having happened. I was lying in bed when there was a\r\nparty at dinner in the house; on a sudden I heard such a hubbub in the\r\ndining-room; without a word being spoken, it was devil take the hindmost\r\nwho should get out first; at the same moment I felt my bed SLIGHTLY\r\nvibrate in a lateral direction. The party were old stagers, and heard\r\nthe noise which always precedes a shock; and no old stager looks at an\r\nearthquake with philosophical eyes...\r\n\r\nGood-bye to you all; you will not have another letter for some time.\r\n\r\nMy dear Catherine, Yours affectionately, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nMy best love to my father, and all of you. Love to Nancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MISS S. DARWIN. Valparaiso, April 23, 1835.\r\n\r\nMy dear Susan,\r\n\r\nI received, a few days since, your letter of November; the three letters\r\nwhich I before mentioned are yet missing, but I do not doubt they will\r\ncome to life. I returned a week ago from my excursion across the Andes\r\nto Mendoza. Since leaving England I have never made so successful a\r\njourney; it has, however, been very expensive. I am sure my father would\r\nnot regret it, if he could know how deeply I have enjoyed it: it was\r\nsomething more than enjoyment; I cannot express the delight which I\r\nfelt at such a famous winding-up of all my geology in South America. I\r\nliterally could hardly sleep at nights for thinking over my day's work.\r\nThe scenery was so new, and so majestic; everything at an elevation of\r\n12,000 feet bears so different an aspect from that in a lower country. I\r\nhave seen many views more beautiful, but none with so strongly marked\r\na character. To a geologist, also, there are such manifest proofs of\r\nexcessive violence; the strata of the highest pinnacles are tossed about\r\nlike the crust of a broken pie.\r\n\r\nI crossed by the Portillo Pass, which at this time of the year is apt to\r\nbe dangerous, so could not afford to delay there. After staying a day in\r\nthe stupid town of Mendoza, I began my return by Uspallate, which I did\r\nvery leisurely. My whole trip only took up twenty-two days. I travelled\r\nwith, for me, uncommon comfort, as I carried a BED! My party consisted\r\nof two Peons and ten mules, two of which were with baggage, or rather\r\nfood, in case of being snowed up. Everything, however, favoured me;\r\nnot even a speck of this year's snow had fallen on the road. I do not\r\nsuppose any of you can be much interested in geological details, but\r\nI will just mention my principal results:--Besides understanding to\r\na certain extent the description and manner of the force which has\r\nelevated this great line of mountains, I can clearly demonstrate that\r\none part of the double line is of an age long posterior to the other.\r\nIn the more ancient line, which is the true chain of the Andes, I can\r\ndescribe the sort and order of the rocks which compose it. These are\r\nchiefly remarkable by containing a bed of gypsum nearly 2000 feet\r\nthick--a quantity of this substance I should think unparalleled in\r\nthe world. What is of much greater consequence, I have procured fossil\r\nshells (from an elevation of 12,000 feet). I think an examination of\r\nthese will give an approximate age to these mountains, as compared to\r\nthe strata of Europe. In the other line of the Cordilleras there is a\r\nstrong presumption (in my own mind, conviction) that the enormous mass\r\nof mountains, the peaks of which rise to 13,000 and 14,000 feet, are so\r\nvery modern as to be contemporaneous with the plains of Patagonia (or\r\nabout with the UPPER strata of the Isle of Wight). If this result shall\r\nbe considered as proved (The importance of these results has been fully\r\nrecognised by geologists.), it is a very important fact in the theory\r\nof the formation of the world; because, if such wonderful changes have\r\ntaken place so recently in the crust of the globe, there can be no\r\nreason for supposing former epochs of excessive violence. These modern\r\nstrata are very remarkable by being threaded with metallic veins of\r\nsilver, gold, copper, etc.; hitherto these have been considered as\r\nappertaining to older formations. In these same beds, and close to a\r\ngoldmine, I found a clump of petrified trees, standing up right, with\r\nlayers of fine sandstone deposited round them, bearing the impression of\r\ntheir bark. These trees are covered by other sandstones and streams of\r\nlava to the thickness of several thousand feet. These rocks have been\r\ndeposited beneath water; yet it is clear the spot where the trees grew\r\nmust once have been above the level of the sea, so that it is certain\r\nthe land must have been depressed by at least as many thousand feet as\r\nthe superincumbent subaqueous deposits are thick. But I am afraid you\r\nwill tell me I am prosy with my geological descriptions and theories...\r\n\r\nYour account of Erasmus' visit to Cambridge has made me long to be back\r\nthere. I cannot fancy anything more delightful than his Sunday round of\r\nKing's, Trinity, and those talking giants, Whewell and Sedgwick; I hope\r\nyour musical tastes continue in due force. I shall be ravenous for the\r\npianoforte...\r\n\r\nI have not quite determined whether I will sleep at the 'Lion' the first\r\nnight when I arrive per 'Wonder,' or disturb you all in the dead of\r\nnight; everything short of that is absolutely planned. Everything about\r\nShrewsbury is growing in my mind bigger and more beautiful; I am certain\r\nthe acacia and copper beech are two superb trees; I shall know every\r\nbush, and I will trouble you young ladies, when each of you cut down\r\nyour tree, to spare a few. As for the view behind the house, I have seen\r\nnothing like it. It is the same with North Wales; Snowdon, to my\r\nmind, looks much higher and much more beautiful than any peak in the\r\nCordilleras. So you will say, with my benighted faculties, it is time to\r\nreturn, and so it is, and I long to be with you. Whatever the trees are,\r\nI know what I shall find all you. I am writing nonsense, so farewell. My\r\nmost affectionate love to all, and I pray forgiveness from my father.\r\n\r\nYours most affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Lima, July, 1835.\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nI have lately received two of your letters, one dated June and the other\r\nNovember, 1834 (they reached me, however, in an inverted order). I was\r\nvery glad to receive a history of this most important year in your life.\r\nPreviously I had only heard the plain fact that you were married. You\r\nare a true Christian and return good for evil, to send two such letters\r\nto so bad a correspondent as I have been. God bless you for writing\r\nso kindly and affectionately; if it is a pleasure to have friends in\r\nEngland, it is doubly so to think and know that one is not forgotten\r\nbecause absent. This voyage is terribly long. I do so earnestly desire\r\nto return, yet I dare hardly look forward to the future, for I do not\r\nknow what will become of me. Your situation is above envy: I do not\r\nventure even to frame such happy visions. To a person fit to take the\r\noffice, the life of a clergyman is a type of all that is respectable and\r\nhappy. You tempt me by talking of your fireside, whereas it is a sort\r\nof scene I never ought to think about. I saw the other day a vessel\r\nsail for England; it was quite dangerous to know how easily I might\r\nturn deserter. As for an English lady, I have almost forgotten what\r\nshe is--something very angelic and good. As for the women in these\r\ncountries, they wear caps and petticoats, and a very few have pretty\r\nfaces, and then all is said. But if we are not wrecked on some unlucky\r\nreef, I will sit by that same fireside in Vale Cottage and tell some of\r\nthe wonderful stories, which you seem to anticipate and, I presume, are\r\nnot very ready to believe. Gracias a dios, the prospect of such times is\r\nrather shorter than formerly.\r\n\r\nFrom this most wretched 'City of the Kings' we sail in a fortnight, from\r\nthence to Guayaquil, Galapagos, Marquesas, Society Islands, etc., etc. I\r\nlook forward to the Galapagos with more interest than any other part\r\nof the voyage. They abound with active volcanoes, and, I should hope,\r\ncontain Tertiary strata. I am glad to hear you have some thoughts of\r\nbeginning Geology. I hope you will; there is so much larger a field for\r\nthought than in the other branches of Natural History. I am become a\r\nzealous disciple of Mr. Lyell's views, as known in his admirable book.\r\nGeologising in South America, I am tempted to carry parts to a greater\r\nextent even than he does. Geology is a capital science to begin, as it\r\nrequires nothing but a little reading, thinking, and hammering. I have\r\na considerable body of notes together; but it is a constant subject of\r\nperplexity to me, whether they are of sufficient value for all the time\r\nI have spent about them, or whether animals would not have been of more\r\ncertain value.\r\n\r\nI shall indeed be glad once again to see you and tell you how grateful I\r\nfeel for your steady friendship. God bless you, my very dear Fox.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, Yours affectionately, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Sydney, January, 1836.\r\n\r\nMy dear Henslow,\r\n\r\nThis is the last opportunity of communicating with you before that\r\njoyful day when I shall reach Cambridge. I have very little to say:\r\nbut I must write if it is only to express my joy that the last year is\r\nconcluded, and that the present one, in which the \"Beagle\" will return,\r\nis gliding onwards. We have all been disappointed here in not finding\r\neven a single letter; we are, indeed, rather before our expected time,\r\notherwise, I dare say, I should have seen your handwriting. I must\r\nfeed upon the future, and it is beyond bounds delightful to feel the\r\ncertainty that within eight months I shall be residing once again most\r\nquietly in Cambridge. Certainly, I never was intended for a traveller;\r\nmy thoughts are always rambling over past or future scenes; I cannot\r\nenjoy the present happiness for anticipating the future, which is about\r\nas foolish as the dog who dropped the real bone for its shadow....\r\n\r\nIn our passage across the Pacific we only touched at Tahiti and New\r\nZealand; at neither of these places or at sea had I much opportunity\r\nof working. Tahiti is a most charming spot. Everything which former\r\nnavigators have written is true. 'A new Cytheraea has risen from the\r\nocean.' Delicious scenery, climate, manners of the people are all in\r\nharmony. It is, moreover, admirable to behold what the missionaries both\r\nhere and at New Zealand have effected. I firmly believe they are good\r\nmen working for the sake of a good cause. I much suspect that those who\r\nhave abused or sneered at the missionaries have generally been such as\r\nwere not very anxious to find the natives moral and intelligent beings.\r\nDuring the remainder of our voyage we shall only visit places generally\r\nacknowledged as civilised, and nearly all under the British flag. These\r\nwill be a poor field for Natural History, and without it I have lately\r\ndiscovered that the pleasure of seeing new places is as nothing. I must\r\nreturn to my old resource and think of the future, but that I may not\r\nbecome more prosy, I will say farewell till the day arrives, when I\r\nshall see my Master in Natural History, and can tell him how grateful I\r\nfeel for his kindness and friendship.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, dear Henslow, Ever yours, most faithfully, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MISS S. DARWIN. Bahia, Brazil, August 4 [1836].\r\n\r\nMy dear Susan,\r\n\r\nI will just write a few lines to explain the cause of this letter being\r\ndated on the coast of South America. Some singular disagreements in the\r\nlongitudes made Captain Fitz-Roy anxious to complete the circle in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, and then retrace our steps by our first line to\r\nEngland. This zigzag manner of proceeding is very grievous; it has put\r\nthe finishing stroke to my feelings. I loathe, I abhor the sea and all\r\nships which sail on it. But I yet believe we shall reach England in the\r\nlatter half of October. At Ascension I received Catherine's letter of\r\nOctober, and yours of November; the letter at the Cape was of a later\r\ndate, but letters of all sorts are inestimable treasures, and I\r\nthank you both for them. The desert, volcanic rocks, and wild sea of\r\nAscension, as soon as I knew there was news from home, suddenly wore a\r\npleasing aspect, and I set to work with a good-will at my old work of\r\nGeology. You would be surprised to know how entirely the pleasure in\r\narriving at a new place depends on letters. We only stayed four days at\r\nAscension, and then made a very good passage to Bahia.\r\n\r\nI little thought to have put my foot on South American coast again.\r\nIt has been almost painful to find how much good enthusiasm has been\r\nevaporated during the last four years. I can now walk soberly through\r\na Brazilian forest; not but what it is exquisitely beautiful, but now,\r\ninstead of seeking for splendid contrasts, I compare the stately mango\r\ntrees with the horse-chestnuts of England. Although this zigzag has lost\r\nus at least a fortnight, in some respects I am glad of it. I think I\r\nshall be able to carry away one vivid picture of inter-tropical scenery.\r\nWe go from hence to the Cape de Verds; that is, if the winds or the\r\nEquatorial calms will allow us. I have some faint hopes that a steady\r\nfoul wind might induce the Captain to proceed direct to the Azores. For\r\nwhich most untoward event I heartily pray.\r\n\r\nBoth your letters were full of good news; especially the expressions\r\nwhich you tell me Professor Sedgwick used about my collections. I\r\nconfess they are deeply gratifying--I trust one part at least will turn\r\nout true, and that I shall act as I now think--as a man who dares to\r\nwaste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life. Professor\r\nSedgwick mentioning my name at all gives me hopes that he will assist me\r\nwith his advice, of which, in my geological questions, I stand much in\r\nneed. It is useless to tell you from the shameful state of this scribble\r\nthat I am writing against time, having been out all morning, and now\r\nthere are some strangers on board to whom I must go down and talk\r\ncivility. Moreover, as this letter goes by a foreign ship, it is\r\ndoubtful whether it will ever arrive. Farewell, my very dear Susan and\r\nall of you. Good-bye.\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. St. Helena, July 9, 1836.\r\n\r\nMy dear Henslow,\r\n\r\nI am going to ask you to do me a favour. I am very anxious to belong to\r\nthe Geological Society. I do not know, but I suppose it is necessary to\r\nbe proposed some time before being ballotted for; if such is the case,\r\nwould you be good enough to take the proper preparatory steps? Professor\r\nSedgwick very kindly offered to propose me before leaving England, if he\r\nshould happen to be in London. I dare say he would yet do so.\r\n\r\nI have very little to write about. We have neither seen, done, or heard\r\nof anything particular for a long time past; and indeed if at present\r\nthe wonders of another planet could be displayed before us, I believe we\r\nshould unanimously exclaim, what a consummate plague. No schoolboys ever\r\nsung the half sentimental and half jovial strain of 'dulce domum' with\r\nmore fervour, than we all feel inclined to do. But the whole subject\r\nof 'dulce domum,' and the delight of seeing one's friends, is most\r\ndangerous, it must infallibly make one very prosy or very boisterous.\r\nOh, the degree to which I long to be once again living quietly with not\r\none single novel object near me! No one can imagine it till he has been\r\nwhirled round the world during five long years in a ten-gun-brig. I am\r\nat present living in a small house (amongst the clouds) in the centre of\r\nthe island, and within stone's throw of Napoleon's tomb. It is blowing\r\na gale of wind with heavy rain and wretchedly cold; if Napoleon's ghost\r\nhaunts his dreary place of confinement, this would be a most excellent\r\nnight for such wandering spirits. If the weather chooses to permit me,\r\nI hope to see a little of the Geology (so often partially described) of\r\nthe island. I suspect that differently from most volcanic islands its\r\nstructure is rather complicated. It seems strange that this little\r\ncentre of a distinct creation should, as is asserted, bear marks of\r\nrecent elevation.\r\n\r\nThe \"Beagle\" proceeds from this place to Ascension, then to the Cape de\r\nVerds (what miserable places!) to the Azores to Plymouth, and then\r\nto home. That most glorious of all days in my life will not, however,\r\narrive till the middle of October. Some time in that month you will see\r\nme at Cambridge, where I must directly come to report myself to you, as\r\nmy first Lord of the Admiralty. At the Cape of Good Hope we all on board\r\nsuffered a bitter disappointment in missing nine months' letters, which\r\nare chasing us from one side of the globe to the other. I dare say\r\namongst them there was a letter from you; it is long since I have\r\nseen your handwriting, but I shall soon see you yourself, which is\r\nfar better. As I am your pupil, you are bound to undertake the task of\r\ncriticising and scolding me for all the things ill done and not done at\r\nall, which I fear I shall need much; but I hope for the best, and I am\r\nsure I have a good if not too easy taskmaster.\r\n\r\nAt the Cape Captain Fitz-Roy and myself enjoyed a memorable piece of\r\ngood fortune in meeting Sir J. Herschel. We dined at his house and\r\nsaw him a few times besides. He was exceedingly good natured, but his\r\nmanners at first appeared to me rather awful. He is living in a very\r\ncomfortable country house, surrounded by fir and oak trees, which alone\r\nin so open a country, give a most charming air of seclusion and comfort.\r\nHe appears to find time for everything; he showed us a pretty garden\r\nfull of Cape bulbs of his own collecting, and I afterwards understood\r\nthat everything was the work of his own hands...I am very stupid, and I\r\nhave nothing more to say; the wind is whistling so mournfully over the\r\nbleak hills, that I shall go to bed and dream of England.\r\n\r\nGoodnight, my dear Henslow, Yours most truly obliged and affectionately,\r\nCHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. Shrewsbury, Thursday, October 6, [1836].\r\n\r\nMy dear Henslow,\r\n\r\nI am sure you will congratulate me on the delight of once again being\r\nhome. The \"Beagle\" arrived at Falmouth on Sunday evening, and I reached\r\nShrewsbury yesterday morning. I am exceedingly anxious to see you, and\r\nas it will be necessary in four or five days to return to London to get\r\nmy goods and chattels out of the \"Beagle\", it appears to me my best plan\r\nto pass through Cambridge. I want your advice on many points; indeed I\r\nam in the clouds, and neither know what to do or where to go. My chief\r\npuzzle is about the geological specimens--who will have the charity\r\nto help me in describing their mineralogical nature? Will you be kind\r\nenough to write to me one line by RETURN OF POST, saying whether you\r\nare now at Cambridge? I am doubtful till I hear from Captain Fitz-Roy\r\nwhether I shall not be obliged to start before the answer can arrive,\r\nbut pray try the chance. My dear Henslow, I do long to see you; you have\r\nbeen the kindest friend to me that ever man possessed. I can write no\r\nmore, for I am giddy with joy and confusion.\r\n\r\nFarewell for the present, Yours most truly obliged, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO R. FITZ-ROY. Shrewsbury, Thursday morning, October 6,\r\n[1836].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fitz-Roy,\r\n\r\nI arrived here yesterday morning at breakfast time, and, thank God,\r\nfound all my dear good sisters and father quite well. My father appears\r\nmore cheerful and very little older than when I left. My sisters assure\r\nme I do not look the least different, and I am able to return the\r\ncompliment. Indeed, all England appears changed excepting the good old\r\ntown of Shrewsbury and its inhabitants, which, for all I can see to\r\nthe contrary, may go on as they now are to Doomsday. I wish with all\r\nmy heart I was writing to you amongst your friends instead of at that\r\nhorrid Plymouth. But the day will soon come, and you will be as happy as\r\nI now am. I do assure you I am a very great man at home; the five years'\r\nvoyage has certainly raised me a hundred per cent. I fear such greatness\r\nmust experience a fall.\r\n\r\nI am thoroughly ashamed of myself in what a dead-and-half-alive state I\r\nspent the few last days on board; my only excuse is that certainly I was\r\nnot quite well. The first day in the mail tired me, but as I drew nearer\r\nto Shrewsbury everything looked more beautiful and cheerful. In passing\r\nGloucestershire and Worcestershire I wished much for you to admire the\r\nfields, woods, and orchards. The stupid people on the coach did not seem\r\nto think the fields one bit greener than usual; but I am sure we should\r\nhave thoroughly agreed that the wide world does not contain so happy a\r\nprospect as the rich cultivated land of England.\r\n\r\nI hope you will not forget to send me a note telling me how you go on.\r\nI do indeed hope all your vexations and trouble with respect to our\r\nvoyage, which we now know HAS an end, have come to a close. If you do\r\nnot receive much satisfaction for all the mental and bodily energy you\r\nhave expended in His Majesty's service, you will be most hardly treated.\r\nI put my radical sisters into an uproar at some of the prudent (if\r\nthey were not honest Whigs, I would say shabby) proceedings of our\r\nGovernment. By the way, I must tell you for the honour and glory of the\r\nfamily that my father has a large engraving of King George IV. put up\r\nin his sitting-room. But I am no renegade, and by the time we meet my\r\npolitics will be as firmly fixed and as wisely founded as ever they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nI thought when I began this letter I would convince you what a steady\r\nand sober frame of mind I was in. But I find I am writing most precious\r\nnonsense. Two or three of our labourers yesterday immediately set to\r\nwork and got most excessively drunk in honour of the arrival of Master\r\nCharles. Who then shall gainsay if Master Charles himself chooses to\r\nmake himself a fool. Good-bye. God bless you! I hope you are as happy,\r\nbut much wiser, than your most sincere but unworthy philosopher,\r\n\r\nCHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.VII. -- LONDON AND CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n1836-1842.\r\n\r\n[The period illustrated by the following letters includes the years\r\nbetween my father's return from the voyage of the \"Beagle\" and his\r\nsettling at Down. It is marked by the gradual appearance of that\r\nweakness of health which ultimately forced him to leave London and take\r\nup his abode for the rest of his life in a quiet country house.]\r\n\r\nIn June, 1841, he writes to Lyell: \"My father scarcely seems to expect\r\nthat I shall become strong for some years; it has been a bitter\r\nmortification for me to digest the conclusion that the 'race is for the\r\nstrong,' and that I shall probably do little more but be content to\r\nadmire the strides others make in science.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence of any intention of entering a profession after his\r\nreturn from the voyage, and early in 1840 he wrote to Fitz-Roy: \"I\r\nhave nothing to wish for, excepting stronger health to go on with the\r\nsubjects to which I have joyfully determined to devote my life.\"\r\n\r\nThese two conditions--permanent ill-health and a passionate love of\r\nscientific work for its own sake--determined thus early in his career,\r\nthe character of his whole future life. They impelled him to lead a\r\nretired life of constant labour, carried on to the utmost limits of his\r\nphysical power, a life which signally falsified his melancholy prophecy.\r\n\r\nThe end of the last chapter saw my father safely arrived at Shrewsbury\r\non October 4, 1836, \"after an absence of five years and two days.\" He\r\nwrote to Fox: \"You cannot imagine how gloriously delightful my first\r\nvisit was at home; it was worth the banishment.\" But it was a pleasure\r\nthat he could not long enjoy, for in the last days of October he was at\r\nGreenwich unpacking specimens from the \"Beagle\". As to the destination\r\nof the collections he writes, somewhat despondingly, to Henslow:--\r\n\r\n\"I have not made much progress with the great men. I find, as you told\r\nme, that they are all overwhelmed with their own business. Mr. Lyell\r\nhas entered, in the MOST good-natured manner, and almost without being\r\nasked, into all my plans. He tells me, however, the same story, that\r\nI must do all myself. Mr. Owen seems anxious to dissect some of the\r\nanimals in spirits, and, besides these two, I have scarcely met any\r\none who seems to wish to possess any of my specimens. I must except Dr.\r\nGrant, who is willing to examine some of the corallines. I see it is\r\nquite unreasonable to hope for a minute that any man will undertake\r\nthe examination of a whole order. It is clear the collectors so much\r\noutnumber the real naturalists that the latter have no time to spare.\r\n\r\n\"I do not even find that the Collections care for receiving the unnamed\r\nspecimens. The Zoological Museum (The Museum of the Zoological Society,\r\nthen at 33 Bruton Street. The collection was some years later broken\r\nup and dispersed.) is nearly full, and upwards of a thousand specimens\r\nremain unmounted. I dare say the British Museum would receive them, but\r\nI cannot feel, from all I hear, any great respect even for the present\r\nstate of that establishment. Your plan will be not only the best, but\r\nthe only one, namely, to come down to Cambridge, arrange and group\r\ntogether the different families, and then wait till people, who are\r\nalready working in different branches, may want specimens. But it\r\nappears to me [that] to do this it will be almost necessary to reside\r\nin London. As far as I can yet see my best plan will be to spend several\r\nmonths in Cambridge, and then when, by your assistance, I know on what\r\nground I stand, to emigrate to London, where I can complete my Geology\r\nand try to push on the Zoology. I assure you I grieve to find how many\r\nthings make me see the necessity of living for some time in this\r\ndirty, odious London. For even in Geology I suspect much assistance and\r\ncommunication will be necessary in this quarter, for instance, in fossil\r\nbones, of which none excepting the fragments of Megatherium have been\r\nlooked at, and I clearly see that without my presence they never would\r\nbe....\r\n\r\n\"I only wish I had known the Botanists cared so much for specimens (A\r\npassage in a subsequent letter shows that his plants also gave him some\r\nanxiety. \"I met Mr. Brown a few days after you had called on him; he\r\nasked me in rather an ominous manner what I meant to do with my plants.\r\nIn the course of conversation Mr. Broderip, who was present, remarked\r\nto him, 'You forget how long it is since Captain King's expedition.'\r\nHe answered, 'Indeed, I have something in the shape of Captain King's\r\nundescribed plants to make me recollect it.' Could a better reason be\r\ngiven, if I had been asked, by me, for not giving the plants to the\r\nBritish Museum?\") and the Zoologists so little; the proportional number\r\nof specimens in the two branches should have had a very different\r\nappearance. I am out of patience with the Zoologists, not because they\r\nare overworked, but for their mean, quarrelsome spirit. I went the other\r\nevening to the Zoological Society, where the speakers were snarling\r\nat each other in a manner anything but like that of gentlemen. Thank\r\nHeavens! as long as I remain in Cambridge there will not be any danger\r\nof falling into any such contemptible quarrels, whilst in London I do\r\nnot see how it is to be avoided. Of the Naturalists, F. Hope is out of\r\nLondon; Westwood I have not seen, so about my insects I know nothing.\r\nI have seen Mr. Yarrell twice, but he is so evidently oppressed with\r\nbusiness that it is too selfish to plague him with my concerns. He has\r\nasked me to dine with the Linnean on Tuesday, and on Wednesday I dine\r\nwith the Geological, so that I shall see all the great men. Mr. Bell,\r\nI hear, is so much occupied that there is no chance of his wishing for\r\nspecimens of reptiles. I have forgotten to mention Mr. Lonsdale (William\r\nLonsdale, 1794-1871, was originally in the army, and served at the\r\nbattles of Salamanca and Waterloo. After the war he left the service\r\nand gave himself up to science. He acted as assistant secretary to\r\nthe Geological Society from 1829-42, when he resigned, owing to ill\r\nhealth.), who gave me a most cordial reception, and with whom I had\r\nmuch most interesting conversation. If I was not much more inclined\r\nfor geology than the other branches of Natural History, I am sure Mr.\r\nLyell's and Lonsdale's kindness ought to fix me. You cannot conceive\r\nanything more thoroughly good-natured than the heart-and-soul manner in\r\nwhich he put himself in my place and thought what would be best to do.\r\nAt first he was all for London versus Cambridge, but at last I made him\r\nconfess that, for some time at least, the latter would be for me\r\nmuch the best. There is not another soul whom I could ask, excepting\r\nyourself, to wade through and criticise some of those papers which I\r\nhave left with you. Mr. Lyell owned that, second to London, there was no\r\nplace in England so good for a Naturalist as Cambridge. Upon my word\r\nI am ashamed of writing so many foolish details, no young lady ever\r\ndescribed her first ball with more particularity.\"\r\n\r\nA few days later he writes more cheerfully: \"I became acquainted with\r\nMr. Bell (T. Bell, F.R.S., formerly Prof. of Zoology in King's College,\r\nLondon, and some time secretary to the Royal Society. He afterwards\r\ndescribed the reptiles for the zoology of the voyage of the \"Beagle\".)\r\nwho to my surprise expressed a good deal of interest about my crustacea\r\nand reptiles, and seems willing to work at them. I also heard that Mr.\r\nBroderip would be glad to look over the South American shells, so that\r\nthings flourish well with me.\"\r\n\r\nAbout his plants he writes with characteristic openness as to his own\r\nignorance: \"You have made me known amongst the botanists, but I felt\r\nvery foolish when Mr. Don remarked on the beautiful appearance of some\r\nplant with an astounding long name, and asked me about its habitation.\r\nSome one else seemed quite surprised that I knew nothing about a Carex\r\nfrom I do not know where. I was at last forced to plead most entire\r\ninnocence, and that I knew no more about the plants which I had\r\ncollected than the man in the moon.\"\r\n\r\nAs to part of his Geological Collection he was soon able to write:\r\n\"I [have] disposed of the most important part [of] my collections, by\r\ngiving all the fossil bones to the College of Surgeons, casts of them\r\nwill be distributed, and descriptions published. They are very curious\r\nand valuable; one head belonged to some gnawing animal, but of the size\r\nof a Hippopotamus! Another to an ant-eater of the size of a horse!\"\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that at this time the only extinct mammalia from\r\nSouth America, which had been described, were Mastodon (three species)\r\nand Megatherium. The remains of the other extinct Edentata from Sir\r\nWoodbine Parish's collection had not been described. My father's\r\nspecimens included (besides the above-mentioned Toxodon and\r\nScelidotherium) the remains of Mylodon, Glossotherium, another gigantic\r\nanimal allied to the ant-eater, and Macrauchenia. His discovery of\r\nthese remains is a matter of interest in itself, but it has a special\r\nimportance as a point in his own life, since it was the vivid impression\r\nproduced by excavating them with his own hands (I have often heard\r\nhim speak of the despair with which he had to break off the projecting\r\nextremity of a huge, partly excavated bone, when the boat waiting for\r\nhim would wait no longer.) that formed one of the chief starting-points\r\nof his speculation on the origin of species. This is shown in the\r\nfollowing extract from his Pocket Book for this year (1837): \"In July\r\nopened first note-book on Transmutation of Species. Had been greatly\r\nstruck from about the month of previous March on character of South\r\nAmerican fossils, and species on Galapagos Archipelago. These facts\r\n(especially latter), origin of all my views.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n1836-1837.\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. 43 Great Marlborough Street, November 6th\r\n[1836].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nI have taken a shamefully long time in answering your letter. But the\r\nbusiest time of the whole voyage has been tranquillity itself to this\r\nlast month. After paying Henslow a short but very pleasant visit, I came\r\nup to town to wait for the \"Beagle's\" arrival. At last I have removed\r\nall my property from on board, and sent the specimens of Natural History\r\nto Cambridge, so that I am now a free man. My London visit has been\r\nquite idle as far as Natural History goes, but has been passed in\r\nmost exciting dissipation amongst the Dons in science. All my affairs,\r\nindeed, are most prosperous; I find there are plenty who will undertake\r\nthe description of whole tribes of animals, of which I know nothing. So\r\nthat about this day month I hope to set to work tooth and nail at the\r\nGeology, which I shall publish by itself.\r\n\r\nIt is quite ridiculous what an immensely long period it appears to me\r\nsince landing at Falmouth. The fact is I have talked and laughed enough\r\nfor years instead of weeks, so [that] my memory is quite confounded with\r\nthe noise. I am delighted to hear you are turned geologist: when I pay\r\nthe Isle of Wight a visit, which I am determined shall somehow come to\r\npass, you will be a capital cicerone to the famous line of dislocation.\r\nI really suppose there are few parts of the world more interesting to a\r\ngeologist than your island. Amongst the great scientific men, no one\r\nhas been nearly so friendly and kind as Lyell. I have seen him several\r\ntimes, and feel inclined to like him much. You cannot imagine how\r\ngood-naturedly he entered into all my plans. I speak now only of the\r\nLondon men, for Henslow was just like his former self, and therefore\r\na most cordial and affectionate friend. When you pay London a visit I\r\nshall be very proud to take you to the Geological Society, for be it\r\nknown, I was proposed to be a F.G.S. last Tuesday. It is, however, a\r\ngreat pity that these and the other letters, especially F.R.S., are so\r\nvery expensive.\r\n\r\nI do not scruple to ask you to write to me in a week's time in\r\nShrewsbury, for you are a good letter writer, and if people will have\r\nsuch good characters they must pay the penalty. Good-bye, dear Fox.\r\n\r\nYours, C.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n[His affairs being thus so far prosperously managed he was able to put\r\ninto execution his plan of living at Cambridge, where he settled on\r\nDecember 10th, 1836. He was at first a guest in the comfortable home of\r\nthe Henslows, but afterwards, for the sake of undisturbed work, he moved\r\ninto lodgings.]\r\n\r\nHe thus writes to Fox, March 13th, 1837, from London:--\r\n\r\n\"My residence at Cambridge was rather longer than I expected, owing to\r\na job which I determined to finish there, namely, looking over all my\r\ngeological specimens. Cambridge yet continues a very pleasant, but not\r\nhalf so merry a place as before. To walk through the courts of Christ's\r\nCollege, and not know an inhabitant of a single room, gave one a feeling\r\nhalf melancholy. The only evil I found in Cambridge was its being too\r\npleasant: there was some agreeable party or another every evening, and\r\none cannot say one is engaged with so much impunity there as in this\r\ngreat city.\"\r\n\r\nA trifling record of my father's presence in Cambridge occurs in the\r\nbook kept in Christ's College combination-room, where fines and bets\r\nwere recorded, the earlier entries giving a curious impression of the\r\nafter-dinner frame of mind of the fellows. The bets were not allowed to\r\nbe made in money, but were, like the fines, paid in wine. The bet which\r\nmy father made and lost is thus recorded:--\r\n\r\n\"FEBRUARY 23, 1837.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin v. Mr. Baines, that the combination-room measures from the\r\nceiling to the floor more than (x) feet. 1 Bottle paid same day.\r\n\r\n\"N.B. Mr. Darwin may measure at any part of the room he pleases.\"\r\n\r\nBesides arranging the geological and mineralogical specimens, he had\r\nhis 'Journal of Researches' to work at, which occupied his evenings at\r\nCambridge. He also read a short paper at the Zoological Society (\"Notes\r\nupon Rhea Americana,\" 'Zool. Soc. Proc.' v. 1837, pages 35, 36.), and\r\nanother at the Geological Society ('Geol. Soc. Proc.' ii. 1838, pages\r\n446- 449.), on the recent elevation of the coast of Chile.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1837 (March 6th) he left Cambridge for London,\r\nand a week later he was settled in lodgings at 36 Great Marlborough\r\nStreet; and except for a \"short visit to Shrewsbury\" in June, he worked\r\non till September, being almost entirely employed on his 'Journal.'\r\nHe found time, however, for two papers at the Geological Society. (\"A\r\nsketch of the deposits containing extinct mammalia in the neighbourhood\r\nof the Plata,\" 'Geol. Soc. Proc.' ii. 1838, pages 542-544; and \"On\r\ncertain areas of elevation and subsidence in the Pacific and Indian\r\noceans, as deduced from the study of coral formations.\" 'Geol. Soc.\r\nProc' ii. 1838, pages 552- 554.)\r\n\r\nHe writes of his work to Fox (March, 1837):--\r\n\r\n\"In your last letter you urge me to get ready THE book. I am now hard at\r\nwork and give up everything else for it. Our plan is as follows: Captain\r\nFitz-Roy writes two volumes out of the materials collected during\r\nthe last voyage under Capt. King to Tierra del Fuego, and during our\r\ncircumnavigation. I am to have the third volume, in which I intend\r\ngiving a kind of journal of a naturalist, not following, however, always\r\nthe order of time, but rather the order of position. The habits of\r\nanimals will occupy a large portion, sketches of the geology,\r\nthe appearance of the country, and personal details will make the\r\nhodge-podge complete. Afterwards I shall write an account of the geology\r\nin detail, and draw up some zoological papers. So that I have plenty of\r\nwork for the next year or two, and till that is finished I will have no\r\nholidays.\"\r\n\r\nAnother letter to Fox (July) gives an account of the progress of his\r\nwork:--\r\n\r\n\"I gave myself a holiday and a visit to Shrewsbury [in June], as I had\r\nfinished my Journal. I shall now be very busy in filling up gaps and\r\ngetting it quite ready for the press by the first of August. I shall\r\nalways feel respect for every one who has written a book, let it be what\r\nit may, for I had no idea of the trouble which trying to write common\r\nEnglish could cost one. And, alas, there yet remains the worst part of\r\nall, correcting the press. As soon as ever that is done I must put my\r\nshoulder to the wheel and commence at the Geology. I have read some\r\nshort papers to the Geological Society, and they were favourably\r\nreceived by the great guns, and this gives me much confidence, and I\r\nhope not a very great deal of vanity, though I confess I feel too often\r\nlike a peacock admiring his tail. I never expected that my Geology would\r\never have been worth the consideration of such men as Lyell, who has\r\nbeen to me, since my return, a most active friend. My life is a very\r\nbusy one at present, and I hope may ever remain so; though Heaven knows\r\nthere are many serious drawbacks to such a life, and chief amongst them\r\nis the little time it allows one for seeing one's natural friends. For\r\nthe last three years, I have been longing and longing to be living at\r\nShrewsbury, and after all now in the course of several months, I see\r\nmy dear good people at Shrewsbury for a week. Susan and Catherine have,\r\nhowever, been staying with my brother here for some weeks, but they had\r\nreturned home before my visit.\"\r\n\r\n[Besides the work already mentioned he had much to busy him in making\r\narrangements for the publication of the 'Zoology of the Voyage of the\r\n\"Beagle\".' The following letters illustrate this subject.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO L. JENYNS. (Now Rev L. Blomefield.) 36 Great\r\nMarlborough Street, April 10th, 1837.\r\n\r\nDear Jenyns,\r\n\r\nDuring the last week several of the zoologists of this place have been\r\nurging me to consider the possibility of publishing the 'Zoology of\r\nthe \"Beagle's\" Voyage' on some uniform plan. Mr. Macleay (William Sharp\r\nMacleay was the son of Alexander Macleay, formerly Colonial Secretary\r\nof New South Wales, and for many years Secretary of the Linnean Society.)\r\nThe son, who was a most zealous Naturalist, and had inherited from his\r\nfather a very large general collection of insects, made Entomology his\r\nchief study, and gained great notoriety by his now forgotten \"Quinary\r\nSystem\", set forth in the Second Part of his 'Horae Entomologicae,'\r\npublished in 1821.--[I am indebted to Rev. L. Blomefield for the\r\nforegoing note.] has taken a great deal of interest in the subject, and\r\nmaintains that such a publication is very desirable, because it keeps\r\ntogether a series of observations made respecting animals inhabiting the\r\nsame part of the world, and allows any future traveller taking them with\r\nhim. How far this facility of reference is of any consequence I am very\r\ndoubtful; but if such is the case, it would be more satisfactory to\r\nmyself to see the gleanings of my hands, after having passed through the\r\nbrains of other naturalists, collected together in one work. But such\r\nconsiderations ought not to have much weight. The whole scheme is at\r\npresent merely floating in the air; but I was determined to let you\r\nknow, as I should much like to know what you think about it, and whether\r\nyou would object to supply descriptions of the fish to such a\r\nwork instead of to 'Transactions.' I apprehend the whole will be\r\nimpracticable, without Government will aid in engraving the plates, and\r\nthis I fear is a mere chance, only I think I can put in a strong claim,\r\nand get myself well backed by the naturalists of this place, who nearly\r\nall take a good deal of interest in my collections. I mean to-morrow\r\nto see Mr. Yarrell; if he approves, I shall begin and take more active\r\nsteps; for I hear he is most prudent and most wise. It is scarcely any\r\nuse speculating about any plan, but I thought of getting subscribers and\r\npublishing the work in parts (as long as funds would last, for I myself\r\nwill not lose money by it). In such case, whoever had his own part ready\r\non any order might publish it separately (and ultimately the parts might\r\nbe sold separately), so that no one should be delayed by the other. The\r\nplan would resemble, on a humble scale, Ruppel's 'Atlas,' or Humboldt's\r\n'Zoologie,' where Latreille, Cuvier, etc., wrote different parts. I\r\nmyself should have little to do with it; excepting in some orders\r\nadding habits and ranges, etc., and geographical sketches, and perhaps\r\nafterwards some descriptions of invertebrate animals...\r\n\r\nI am working at my Journal; it gets on slowly, though I am not idle. I\r\nthought Cambridge a bad place from good dinners and other temptations,\r\nbut I find London no better, and I fear it may grow worse. I have a\r\ncapital friend in Lyell, and see a great deal of him, which is very\r\nadvantageous to me in discussing much South American geology. I miss a\r\nwalk in the country very much; this London is a vile smoky place, where\r\na man loses a great part of the best enjoyments in life. But I see no\r\nchance of escaping, even for a week, from this prison for a long time\r\nto come. I fear it will be some time before we shall meet; for I suppose\r\nyou will not come up here during the spring, and I do not think I shall\r\nbe able to go down to Cambridge. How I should like to have a good walk\r\nalong the Newmarket road to-morrow, but Oxford Street must do instead. I\r\ndo hate the streets of London. Will you tell Henslow to be careful with\r\nthe EDIBLE fungi from Tierra del Fuego, for I shall want some specimens\r\nfor Mr. Brown, who seems PARTICULARLY interested about them. Tell\r\nHenslow, I think my silicified wood has unflintified Mr. Brown's heart,\r\nfor he was very gracious to me, and talked about the Galapagos plants;\r\nbut before he never would say a word. It is just striking twelve\r\no'clock; so I will wish you a very good night.\r\n\r\nMy dear Jenyns, Yours most truly, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n[A few weeks later the plan seems to have been matured, and the idea of\r\nseeking Government aid to have been adopted.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. 36 Great Marlborough Street, [18th May,\r\n1837].\r\n\r\nMy dear Henslow,\r\n\r\nI was very glad to receive your letter. I wanted much to hear how you\r\nwere getting on with your manifold labours. Indeed I do not wonder your\r\nhead began to ache; it is almost a wonder you have any head left. Your\r\naccount of the Gamlingay expedition was cruelly tempting, but I cannot\r\nanyhow leave London. I wanted to pay my good, dear people at Shrewsbury\r\na visit of a few days, but I found I could not manage it; at present I\r\nam waiting for the signatures of the Duke of Somerset, as President of\r\nthe Linnean, and of Lord Derby and Whewell, to a statement of the value\r\nof my collection; the instant I get this I shall apply to Government for\r\nassistance in engraving, and so publish the 'Zoology' on some uniform\r\nplan. It is quite ridiculous the time any operation requires which\r\ndepends on many people.\r\n\r\nI have been working very steadily, but have only got two-thirds through\r\nthe Journal part alone. I find, though I remain daily many hours at\r\nwork, the progress is very slow: it is an awful thing to say to oneself,\r\nevery fool and every clever man in England, if he chooses, may make as\r\nmany ill-natured remarks as he likes on this unfortunate sentence....\r\n\r\n\r\nIn August he writes to Henslow to announce the success of the scheme\r\nfor the publication of the 'Zoology of the Voyage of the \"Beagle\",'\r\nthrough the promise of a grant of 1000 pounds from the Treasury: \"I\r\nhave delayed writing to you, to thank you most sincerely for having so\r\neffectually managed my affair. I waited till I had an interview with the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer (T. Spring Rice.). He appointed to see me\r\nthis morning, and I had a long conversation with him, Mr. Peacock being\r\npresent. Nothing could be more thoroughly obliging and kind than his\r\nwhole manner. He made no sort of restriction, but only told me to make\r\nthe most of [the] money, which of course I am right willing to do.\r\n\r\n\"I expected rather an awful interview, but I never found anything less\r\nso in my life. It will be my fault if I do not make a good work; but I\r\nsometimes take an awful fright that I have not materials enough. It will\r\nbe excessively satisfactory at the end of some two years to find all\r\nmaterials made the most they were capable of.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the autumn he wrote to Henslow: \"I have not been very well of\r\nlate, with an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart, and my doctors\r\nurge me STRONGLY to knock off all work, and go and live in the country\r\nfor a few weeks.\" He accordingly took a holiday of about a month at\r\nShrewsbury and Maer, and paid a visit in the Isle of Wight. It was, I\r\nbelieve, during this visit, at Mr. Wedgwood's house at Maer, that he\r\nmade his first observations on the work done by earthworms, and late\r\nin the autumn he read a paper on the subject at the Geological Society.\r\n(\"On the formation of mould,\" 'Geol. Soc. Proc.' ii. 1838, pages\r\n574-576.) During these two months he was also busy preparing the scheme\r\nof the 'Zoology of the Voyage of the \"Beagle\",' and in beginning to put\r\ntogether the Geological results of his travels.\r\n\r\nThe following letter refers to the proposal that he should take the\r\nSecretaryship of the Geological Society.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. October 14th, [1837].\r\n\r\nMy dear Henslow,\r\n\r\n...I am much obliged to you for your message about the Secretaryship. I\r\nam exceedingly anxious for you to hear my side of the question, and will\r\nyou be so kind as afterwards to give me your fair judgment. The subject\r\nhas haunted me all summer. I am unwilling to undertake the office for\r\nthe following reasons: First, my entire ignorance of English Geology, a\r\nknowledge of which would be almost necessary in order to shorten many\r\nof the papers before reading them before the Society, or rather to\r\nknow what parts to skip. Again, my ignorance of all languages, and\r\nnot knowing how to pronounce a SINGLE word of French--a language so\r\nperpetually quoted. It would be disgraceful to the Society to have a\r\nSecretary who could not read French. Secondly, the loss of time; pray\r\nconsider that I should have to look after the artists, superintend and\r\nfurnish materials for the Government work, which will come out in parts,\r\nand which must appear regularly. All my Geological notes are in a very\r\nrough state; none of my fossil shells worked up; and I have much to\r\nread. I have had hopes, by giving up society and not wasting an hour,\r\nthat I should finish my Geology in a year and a half, by which time the\r\ndescription of the higher animals by others would be completed, and my\r\nwhole time would then necessarily be required to complete myself\r\nthe description of the invertebrate ones. If this plan fails, as the\r\nGovernment work must go on, the Geology would necessarily be deferred\r\ntill probably at least three years from this time. In the present state\r\nof the science, a great part of the utility of the little I have done\r\nwould be lost, and all freshness and pleasure quite taken from me.\r\n\r\nI know from experience the time required to make abstracts EVEN of my\r\nown papers for the 'Proceedings.' If I was Secretary, and had to make\r\ndouble abstracts of each paper, studying them before reading, and\r\nattendance would AT LEAST cost me three days (and often more) in the\r\nfortnight. There are likewise other accidental and contingent losses of\r\ntime; I know Dr. Royle found the office consumed much of his time. If by\r\nmerely giving up any amusement, or by working harder than I have done,\r\nI could save time, I would undertake the Secretaryship; but I appeal to\r\nyou whether, with my slow manner of writing, with two works in hand, and\r\nwith the certainty, if I cannot complete the Geological part within\r\na fixed period, that its publication must be retarded for a very long\r\ntime,--whether any Society whatever has any claim on me for three days'\r\ndisagreeable work every fortnight. I cannot agree that it is a duty on\r\nmy part, as a follower of science, as long as I devote myself to the\r\ncompletion of the work I have in hand, to delay that, by undertaking\r\nwhat may be done by any person who happens to have more spare time than\r\nI have at present. Moreover, so early in my scientific life, with\r\nso very much as I have to learn, the office, though no doubt a great\r\nhonour, etc., for me, would be the more burdensome. Mr. Whewell (I know\r\nvery well), judging from himself, will think I exaggerate the time the\r\nSecretaryship would require; but I absolutely know the time which with\r\nme the simplest writing consumes. I do not at all like appearing so\r\nselfish as to refuse Mr. Whewell, more especially as he has always\r\nshown, in the kindest manner, an interest in my affairs. But I cannot\r\nlook forward with even tolerable comfort to undertaking an office\r\nwithout entering on it heart and soul, and that would be impossible with\r\nthe Government work and the Geology in hand.\r\n\r\nMy last objection is, that I doubt how far my health will stand the\r\nconfinement of what I have to do, without any additional work. I merely\r\nrepeat, that you may know I am not speaking idly, that when I consulted\r\nDr. Clark in town, he at first urged me to give up entirely all writing\r\nand even correcting press for some weeks. Of late anything which\r\nflurries me completely knocks me up afterwards, and brings on a violent\r\npalpitation of the heart. Now the Secretaryship would be a periodical\r\nsource of more annoying trouble to me than all the rest of the fortnight\r\nput together. In fact, till I return to town, and see how I get on, if\r\nI wished the office ever so much, I COULD not say I would positively\r\nundertake it. I beg of you to excuse this very long prose all about\r\nmyself, but the point is one of great interest. I can neither bear to\r\nthink myself very selfish and sulky, nor can I see the possibility of my\r\ntaking the Secretaryship without making a sacrifice of all my plans and\r\na good deal of comfort.\r\n\r\nIf you see Whewell, would you tell him the substance of this letter; or,\r\nif he will take the trouble, he may read it. My dear Henslow, I appeal\r\nto you in loco parentis. Pray tell me what you think? But do not judge\r\nme by the activity of mind which you and a few others possess, for in\r\nthat case the more difficult things in hand the pleasanter the work;\r\nbut, though I hope I never shall be idle, such is not the case with me.\r\n\r\nEver, dear Henslow, Yours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n[He ultimately accepted the post, and held it for three years--from\r\nFebruary 16, 1838, to February 19, 1841.\r\n\r\nAfter being assured of the Grant for the publication of the 'Zoology of\r\nthe Voyage of the \"Beagle\",' there was much to be done in arranging the\r\nscheme of publication, and this occupied him during part of October and\r\nNovember.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.S. HENSLOW. [4th November, 1837.]\r\n\r\nMy dear Henslow,\r\n\r\n...Pray tell Leonard (Rev. L. Jenyns.) that my Government work is\r\ngoing on smoothly, and I hope will be prosperous. He will see in the\r\nProspectus his name attached to the fish; I set my shoulders to the\r\nwork with a good heart. I am very much better than I was during the\r\nlast month before my Shrewsbury visit. I fear the Geology will take me\r\na great deal of time; I was looking over one set of notes, and the\r\nquantity I found I had to read, for that one place was frightful. If I\r\nlive till I am eighty years old I shall not cease to marvel at finding\r\nmyself an author; in the summer before I started, if any one had told me\r\nthat I should have been an angel by this time, I should have thought it\r\nan equal impossibility. This marvellous transformation is all owing to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to find that a good many errata are left in the part of my\r\nvolume, which is printed. During my absence Mr. Colburn employed some\r\ngoose to revise, and he has multiplied, instead of diminishing my\r\noversights; but for all that, the smooth paper and clear type has\r\na charming appearance, and I sat the other evening gazing in silent\r\nadmiration at the first page of my own volume, when I received it from\r\nthe printers!\r\n\r\nGood-bye, my dear Henslow, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1838.\r\n\r\n[From the beginning of this year to nearly the end of June, he was\r\nbusily employed on the zoological and geological results of his voyage.\r\nThis spell of work was interrupted only by a visit of three days to\r\nCambridge, in May; and even this short holiday was taken in consequence\r\nof failing health, as we may assume from the entry in his diary: \"May\r\n1st, unwell,\" and from a letter to his sister (May 16, 1838), when he\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n\"My trip of three days to Cambridge has done me such wonderful good, and\r\nfilled my limbs with such elasticity, that I must get a little work\r\nout of my body before another holiday.\" This holiday seems to have been\r\nthoroughly enjoyed; he wrote to his sister:--\r\n\r\n\"Now for Cambridge: I stayed at Henslow's house and enjoyed my visit\r\nextremely. My friends gave me a most cordial welcome. Indeed, I was\r\nquite a lion there. Mrs. Henslow unfortunately was obliged to go on\r\nFriday for a visit in the country. That evening we had at Henslow's a\r\nbrilliant party of all the geniuses in Cambridge, and a most remarkable\r\nset of men they most assuredly are. On Saturday I rode over to L.\r\nJenyns', and spent the morning with him. I found him very cheerful, but\r\nbitterly complaining of his solitude. On Saturday evening dined at one\r\nof the Colleges, played at bowls on the College Green after dinner,\r\nand was deafened with nightingales singing. Sunday, dined in Trinity;\r\ncapital dinner, and was very glad to sit by Professor Lee (Samuel\r\nLee, of Queens', was Professor of Arabic from 1819 to 1831, and Regius\r\nProfessor of Hebrew from 1831 to 1848.)...; I find him a very pleasant\r\nchatting man, and in high spirits like a boy, at having lately returned\r\nfrom a living or a curacy, for seven years in Somersetshire, to\r\ncivilised society and oriental manuscripts. He had exchanged his living\r\nto one within fourteen miles of Cambridge, and seemed perfectly happy.\r\nIn the evening attended Trinity Chapel, and heard 'The Heavens are\r\ntelling the Glory of God,' in magnificent style; the last chorus seemed\r\nto shake the very walls of the College. After chapel a large party in\r\nSedgwick's rooms. So much for my Annals.\"\r\n\r\nHe started, towards the end of June, on his expedition to Glen Roy, of\r\nwhich he writes to Fox: \"I have not been very well of late, which has\r\nsuddenly determined me to leave London earlier than I had anticipated. I\r\ngo by the steam-packet to Edinburgh,--take a solitary walk on Salisbury\r\nCraigs, and call up old thoughts of former times, then go on to Glasgow\r\nand the great valley of Inverness, near which I intend stopping a week\r\nto geologise the parallel roads of Glen Roy, thence to Shrewsbury, Maer\r\nfor one day, and London for smoke, ill-health and hard work.\"\r\n\r\nHe spent \"eight good days\" over the Parallel Roads. His Essay on this\r\nsubject was written out during the same summer, and published by the\r\nRoyal Society. ('Phil. Trans.' 1839, pages 39-82.) He wrote in his\r\nPocket Book: \"September 6 [1838]. Finished the paper on 'Glen Roy,' one\r\nof the most difficult and instructive tasks I was ever engaged on.\" It\r\nwill be remembered that in his 'Recollections' he speaks of this paper\r\nas a failure, of which he was ashamed.\r\n\r\nAt the time at which he wrote, the latest theory of the formation of\r\nthe Parallel Roads was that of Sir Lauder Dick and Dr. Macculloch, who\r\nbelieved that lakes had anciently existed in Glen Roy, caused by dams\r\nof rock or alluvium. In arguing against this theory he conceived that he\r\nhad disproved the admissibility of any lake theory, but in this point\r\nhe was mistaken. He wrote (Glen Roy paper, page 49) \"the conclusion is\r\ninevitable, that no hypothesis founded on the supposed existence of a\r\nsheet of water confined by BARRIERS, that is a lake, can be admitted as\r\nsolving the problematical origin of the parallel roads of Lochaber.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Archibald Geikie has been so good as to allow me to quote a passage\r\nfrom a letter addressed to me (November 19, 1884) in compliance with my\r\nrequest for his opinion on the character of my father's Glen Roy work:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Darwin's 'Glen Roy' paper, I need not say, is marked by all his\r\ncharacteristic acuteness of observation and determination to consider\r\nall possible objections. It is a curious example, however, of the danger\r\nof reasoning by a method of exclusion in Natural Science. Finding that\r\nthe waters which formed the terraces in the Glen Roy region could not\r\npossibly have been dammed back by barriers of rock or of detritus, he\r\nsaw no alternative but to regard them as the work of the sea. Had the\r\nidea of transient barriers of glacier-ice occurred to him, he would have\r\nfound the difficulties vanish from the lake-theory which he opposed,\r\nand he would not have been unconsciously led to minimise the altogether\r\noverwhelming objections to the supposition that the terraces are of\r\nmarine origin.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the idea of the barriers being formed by glaciers\r\ncould hardly have occurred to him, considering what was the state of\r\nknowledge at the time, and bearing in mind his want of opportunities of\r\nobserving glacial action on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe latter half of July was passed at Shrewsbury and Maer. The only\r\nentry of any interest is one of being \"very idle\" at Shrewsbury, and of\r\nopening \"a note-book connected with metaphysical inquiries.\" In August\r\nhe records that he read \"a good deal of various amusing books, and paid\r\nsome attention to metaphysical subjects.\"\r\n\r\nThe work done during the remainder of the year comprises the book\r\non coral reefs (begun in October), and some work on the phenomena of\r\nelevation in S. America.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. 36 Great Marlborough Street, August 9th\r\n[1838].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI do not write to you at Norwich, for I thought I should have more to\r\nsay, if I waited a few more days. Very many thanks for the present of\r\nyour 'Elements,' which I received (and I believe the VERY FIRST copy\r\ndistributed) together with your note. I have read it through every word,\r\nand am full of admiration of it, and, as I now see no geologist, I must\r\ntalk to you about it. There is no pleasure in reading a book if one\r\ncannot have a good talk over it; I repeat, I am full of admiration\r\nof it, it is as clear as daylight, in fact I felt in many parts some\r\nmortification at thinking how geologists have laboured and struggled at\r\nproving what seems, as you have put it, so evidently probable. I read\r\nwith much interest your sketch of the secondary deposits; you have\r\ncontrived to make it quite \"juicy,\" as we used to say as children of a\r\ngood story. There was also much new to me, and I have to copy out some\r\nfifty notes and references. It must do good, the heretics against common\r\nsense must yield...By the way, do you recollect my telling you how much\r\nI disliked the manner -- referred to his other works, as much as to say,\r\n\"You must, ought, and shall buy everything I have written.\" To my mind,\r\nyou have somehow quite avoided this; your references only seem to say,\r\n\"I can't tell you all in this work, else I would, so you must go to the\r\n'Principles'\"; and many a one, I trust, you will send there, and make\r\nthem, like me, adorers of the good science of rock-breaking. You will\r\nsee I am in a fit of enthusiasm, and good cause I have to be, when I\r\nfind you have made such infinitely more use of my Journal than I could\r\nhave anticipated. I will say no more about the book, for it is all\r\npraise. I must, however, admire the elaborate honesty with which you\r\nquote the words of all living and dead geologists.\r\n\r\nMy Scotch expedition answered brilliantly; my trip in the steam-packet\r\nwas absolutely pleasant, and I enjoyed the spectacle, wretch that I am,\r\nof two ladies, and some small children quite sea-sick, I being well.\r\nMoreover, on my return from Glasgow to Liverpool, I triumphed in a\r\nsimilar manner over some full-grown men. I stayed one whole day in\r\nEdinburgh, or more truly on Salisbury Craigs; I want to hear some day\r\nwhat you think about that classical ground,--the structure was to me new\r\nand rather curious,--that is, if I understand it right. I crossed from\r\nEdinburgh in gigs and carts (and carts without springs, as I never shall\r\nforget) to Loch Leven. I was disappointed in the scenery, and reached\r\nGlen Roy on Saturday evening, one week after leaving Marlborough Street.\r\nHere I enjoyed five [?] days of the most beautiful weather with gorgeous\r\nsunsets, and all nature looking as happy as I felt. I wandered over\r\nthe mountains in all directions, and examined that most extraordinary\r\ndistrict. I think, without any exceptions, not even the first volcanic\r\nisland, the first elevated beach, or the passage of the Cordillera, was\r\nso interesting to me as this week. It is far the most remarkable area\r\nI ever examined. I have fully convinced myself (after some doubting at\r\nfirst) that the shelves are sea-beaches, although I could not find a\r\ntrace of a shell; and I think I can explain away most, if not all, the\r\ndifficulties. I found a piece of a road in another valley, not hitherto\r\nobserved, which is important; and I have some curious facts about\r\nerratic blocks, one of which was perched up on a peak 2200 feet above\r\nthe sea. I am now employed in writing a paper on the subject, which I\r\nfind very amusing work, excepting that I cannot anyhow condense it into\r\nreasonable limits. At some future day I hope to talk over some of the\r\nconclusions with you, which the examination of Glen Roy has led me to.\r\nNow I have had my talk out, I am much easier, for I can assure you Glen\r\nRoy has astonished me.\r\n\r\nI am living very quietly, and therefore pleasantly, and am crawling on\r\nslowly but steadily with my work. I have come to one conclusion,\r\nwhich you will think proves me to be a very sensible man, namely, that\r\nwhatever you say proves right; and as a proof of this, I am coming into\r\nyour way of only working about two hours at a spell; I then go out and\r\ndo my business in the streets, return and set to work again, and thus\r\nmake two separate days out of one. The new plan answers capitally; after\r\nthe second half day is finished I go and dine at the Athenaeum like a\r\ngentleman, or rather like a lord, for I am sure the first evening I sat\r\nin that great drawing-room, all on a sofa by myself, I felt just like a\r\nduke. I am full of admiration at the Athenaeum, one meets so many people\r\nthere that one likes to see. The very first time I dined there (i.e.\r\nlast week) I met Dr. Fitton (W.H. Fitton (1780-1861) was a physician\r\nand geologist, and sometime president of the Geological Society. He\r\nestablished the 'Proceedings,' a mode of publication afterwards\r\nadopted by other societies.) at the door, and he got together quite a\r\nparty--Robert Brown, who is gone to Paris and Auvergne, Macleay [?] and\r\nDr. Boott. (Francis Boott (1792-1863) is chiefly known as a botanist\r\nthrough his work on the genus Carex. He was also well-known in\r\nconnection with the Linnean Society of which he was for many years an\r\noffice-bearer. He is described (in a biographical sketch published\r\nin the \"Gardener's Chronicle\", 1864) as having been one of the first\r\nphysicians in London who gave up the customary black coat, knee-breeches\r\nand silk stockings, and adopted the ordinary dress of the period, a\r\nblue coat with brass buttons, and a buff waiscoat, a costume which he\r\ncontinued to wear to the last. After giving up practice, which he\r\ndid early in life, he spent much of his time in acts of unpretending\r\nphilanthropy.) Your helping me into the Athenaeum has not been thrown\r\naway, and I enjoy it the more because I fully expected to detest it.\r\n\r\nI am writing you a most unmerciful letter, but I shall get Owen to take\r\nit to Newcastle. If you have a mind to be a very generous man you will\r\nwrite to me from Kinnordy (The house of Lyell's father.), and tell me\r\nsome Newcastle news, as well as about the Craig, and about yourself and\r\nMrs. Lyell, and everything else in the world. I will send by Hall the\r\n'Entomological Transactions,' which I have borrowed for you; you will be\r\ndisappointed in --'s papers, that is if you suppose my dear friend has\r\na single clear idea upon any one subject. He has so involved recent\r\ninsects and true fossil insects in one table that I fear you will not\r\nmake much out of it, though it is a subject which ought I should\r\nthink to come into the 'Principles.' You will be amused at some of the\r\nridiculo-sublime passages in the papers, and no doubt will feel acutely\r\na sneer there is at yourself. I have heard from more than one quarter\r\nthat quarrelling is expected at Newcastle (At the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation.); I am sorry to hear it. I met old -- this evening at the\r\nAthenaeum, and he muttered something about writing to you or some one on\r\nthe subject; I am however all in the dark. I suppose, however, I shall\r\nbe illuminated, for I am going to dine with him in a few days, as my\r\ninventive powers failed in making any excuse. A friend of mine dined\r\nwith him the other day, a party of four, and they finished ten bottles\r\nof wine--a pleasant prospect for me; but I am determined not even to\r\ntaste his wine, partly for the fun of seeing his infinite disgust and\r\nsurprise...\r\n\r\nI pity you the infliction of this most unmerciful letter. Pray remember\r\nme most kindly to Mrs. Lyell when you arrive at Kinnordy. I saw her name\r\nin the landlord's book of Inverorum. Tell Mrs. Lyell to read the\r\nsecond series of 'Mr. Slick of Slickville's Sayings.'...He almost beats\r\n\"Samivel,\" that prince of heroes. Goodnight, my dear Lyell; you will\r\nthink I have been drinking some strong drink to write so much nonsense,\r\nbut I did not even taste Minerva's small beer to-day.\r\n\r\nYours most sincerely, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Friday night, September 13th [1838].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI was astonished and delighted at your gloriously long letter, and I am\r\nsure I am very much obliged to Mrs. Lyell for having taken the trouble\r\nto write so much. (Lyell dictated much of his correspondence.) I mean to\r\nhave a good hour's enjoyment and scribble away to you, who have so much\r\ngeological sympathy that I do not care how egotistically I write...\r\n\r\nI have got so much to say about all sorts of trifling things that I\r\nhardly know what to begin about. I need not say how pleased I am to hear\r\nthat Mr. Lyell (Father of the geologist.) likes my Journal. To hear\r\nsuch tidings is a kind of resurrection, for I feel towards my first-born\r\nchild as if it had long since been dead, buried, and forgotten; but the\r\npast is nothing and the future everything to us geologists, as you show\r\nin your capital motto to the 'Elements.' By the way, have you read\r\nthe article, in the 'Edinburgh Review,' on M. Comte, 'Cours de la\r\nPhilosophie' (or some such title)? It is capital; there are some fine\r\nsentences about the very essence of science being prediction, which\r\nreminded me of \"its law being progress.\"\r\n\r\nI will now begin and go through your letter seriatim. I dare say your\r\nplan of putting the Elie de Beaumont's chapter separately and early will\r\nbe very good; anyhow, it is showing a bold front in the first edition\r\nwhich is to be translated into French. It will be a curious point to\r\ngeologists hereafter to note how long a man's name will support a theory\r\nso completely exposed as that of De Beaumont's has been by you; you\r\nsay you \"begin to hope that the great principles there insisted on will\r\nstand the test of time.\" BEGIN TO HOPE: why, the POSSIBILITY of a\r\ndoubt has never crossed my mind for many a day. This may be very\r\nunphilosophical, but my geological salvation is staked on it. After\r\nhaving just come back from Glen Roy, and found how difficulties smooth\r\naway under your principles, it makes me quite indignant that you should\r\ntalk of HOPING. With respect to the question, how far my coral theory\r\nbears on De Beaumont's theory, I think it would be prudent to quote me\r\nwith great caution until my whole account is published, and then\r\nyou (and others) can judge how far there is foundation for such\r\ngeneralisation. Mind, I do not doubt its truth; but the extension of\r\nany view over such large spaces, from comparatively few facts, must be\r\nreceived with much caution. I do not myself the least doubt that\r\nwithin the recent (or as you, much to my annoyment, would call it, \"New\r\nPliocene\") period, tortuous bands--not all the bands parallel to each\r\nother--have been elevated and corresponding ones subsided, though within\r\nthe same period some parts probably remained for a time stationary, or\r\neven subsided. I do not believe a more utterly false view could have\r\nbeen invented than great straight lines being suddenly thrown up.\r\n\r\nWhen my book on Volcanoes and Coral Reefs will be published I hardly\r\nknow; I fear it will be at least four or five months; though, mind,\r\nthe greater part is written. I find so much time is lost in correcting\r\ndetails and ascertaining their accuracy. The Government Zoological work\r\nis a millstone round my neck, and the Glen Roy paper has lost me six\r\nweeks. I will not, however, say lost; for, supposing I can prove to\r\nothers' satisfaction what I have convinced myself is the case, the\r\ninference I think you will allow to be important. I cannot doubt that\r\nthe molten matter beneath the earth's crust possesses a high degree of\r\nfluidity, almost like the sea beneath the block ice. By the way, I hope\r\nyou will give me some Swedish case to quote, of shells being preserved\r\non the surface, but not in contemporaneous beds of gravel...\r\n\r\nRemember what I have often heard you say: the country is very bad\r\nfor the intellects; the Scotch mists will put out some volcanic\r\nspeculations. You see I am affecting to become very Cockneyfied, and to\r\ndespise the poor country-folk, who breath fresh air instead of smoke,\r\nand see the goodly fields instead of the brick houses in Marlborough\r\nStreet, the very sight of which I confess I abhor. I am glad to hear\r\nwhat a favourable report you give of the British Association. I am the\r\nmore pleased because I have been fighting its battles with Basil Hall,\r\nStokes, and several others, having made up my mind, from the report in\r\nthe \"Athenaeum\", that it must have been an excellent meeting. I have\r\nbeen much amused with an account I have received of the wars of Don\r\nRoderick (Murchison.) and Babbage. What a grievous pity it is that the\r\nlatter should be so implacable...This is a most rigmarole letter, for\r\nafter each sentence I take breath, and you will have need of it in\r\nreading it...\r\n\r\nI wish with all my heart that my Geological book was out. I have every\r\nmotive to work hard, and will, following your steps, work just that\r\ndegree of hardness to keep well. I should like my volume to be out\r\nbefore your new edition of 'Principles' appears. Besides the Coral\r\ntheory, the volcanic chapters will, I think, contain some new facts.\r\nI have lately been sadly tempted to be idle--that is, as far as pure\r\ngeology is concerned--by the delightful number of new views which\r\nhave been coming in thickly and steadily,--on the classification and\r\naffinities and instincts of animals--bearing on the question of species.\r\nNote-book after note-book has been filled with facts which begin to\r\ngroup themselves CLEARLY under sub-laws.\r\n\r\nGood night, my dear Lyell. I have filled my letter and enjoyed my talk\r\nto you as much as I can without having you in propria persona. Think of\r\nthe bad effects of the country--so once more good night.\r\n\r\nEver yours, CHAS. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nPray again give my best thanks to Mrs. Lyell.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The record of what he wrote during the year does not give a true index\r\nof the most important work that was in progress,--the laying of the\r\nfoundation-stones of what was to be the achievement of his life. This is\r\nshown in the foregoing letter to Lyell, where he speaks of being \"idle,\"\r\nand the following extract from a letter to Fox, written in June, is of\r\ninterest in this point of view:\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to hear you are such a good man as not to have forgotten\r\nmy questions about the crossing of animals. It is my prime hobby, and\r\nI really think some day I shall be able to do something in that most\r\nintricate subject, species and varieties.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n1839-1841.\r\n\r\n[In the winter of 1839 (January 29) my father was married to his cousin,\r\nEmma Wedgwood. (Daughter of Josiah Wedgwood of Maer, and grand-daughter\r\nof the founder of the Etruria Pottery Works.) The house in which they\r\nlived for the first few years of their married life, No. 12 Upper Gower\r\nStreet, was a small common-place London house, with a drawing-room in\r\nfront, and a small room behind, in which they lived for the sake of\r\nquietness. In later years my father used to laugh over the surpassing\r\nugliness of the furniture, carpets, etc., of the Gower Street house. The\r\nonly redeeming feature was a better garden than most London houses have,\r\na strip as wide as the house, and thirty yards long. Even this small\r\nspace of dingy grass made their London house more tolerable to its two\r\ncountry-bred inhabitants.\r\n\r\nOf his life in London he writes to Fox (October 1839): \"We are living\r\na life of extreme quietness; Delamere itself, which you describe as so\r\nsecluded a spot, is, I will answer for it, quite dissipated compared\r\nwith Gower Street. We have given up all parties, for they agree with\r\nneither of us; and if one is quiet in London, there is nothing like\r\nits quietness--there is a grandeur about its smoky fogs, and the dull\r\ndistant sounds of cabs and coaches; in fact you may perceive I am\r\nbecoming a thorough-paced Cockney, and I glory in thoughts that I shall\r\nbe here for the next six months.\"\r\n\r\nThe entries of ill health in the Diary increase in number during\r\nthese years, and as a consequence the holidays become longer and more\r\nfrequent. From April 26 to May 13, 1839, he was at Maer and Shrewsbury.\r\nAgain, from August 23 to October 2 he was away from London at\r\nMaer, Shrewsbury, and at Birmingham for the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nThe entry under August 1839 is: \"During my visit to Maer, read a little,\r\nwas much unwell and scandalously idle. I have derived this much good,\r\nthat NOTHING is so intolerable as idleness.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1839 his eldest child was born, and it was then that he\r\nbegan his observations ultimately published in the 'Expression of the\r\nEmotions.' His book on this subject, and the short paper published in\r\n'Mind,' (July 1877.) show how closely he observed his child. He seems to\r\nhave been surprised at his own feelings for a young baby, for he wrote\r\nto Fox (July 1840): \"He [i.e. the baby] is so charming that I cannot\r\npretend to any modesty. I defy anybody to flatter us on our baby, for\r\nI defy any one to say anything in its praise of which we are not fully\r\nconscious...I had not the smallest conception there was so much in a\r\nfive-month baby. You will perceive by this that I have a fine degree of\r\npaternal fervour.\"\r\n\r\nDuring these years he worked intermittently at 'Coral Reefs,' being\r\nconstantly interrupted by ill health. Thus he speaks of \"recommencing\"\r\nthe subject in February 1839, and again in the October of the same year,\r\nand once more in July 1841, \"after more than thirteen months' interval.\"\r\nHis other scientific work consisted of a contribution to the Geological\r\nSociety ('Geol. Soc. Proc.' iii. 1842, and 'Geol. Soc. Trans.' vi), on\r\nthe boulders and \"till\" of South America, as well as a few other\r\nminor papers on geological subjects. He also worked busily at the\r\nornithological part of the Zoology of the \"Beagle\", i.e. the notice of\r\nthe habits and ranges of the birds which were described by Gould.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Wednesday morning [February 1840].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your kind note. I will send for the \"Scotsman\". Dr.\r\nHolland thinks he has found out what is the matter with me, and now\r\nhopes he shall be able to set me going again. Is it not mortifying, it\r\nis now nine weeks since I have done a whole day's work, and not more\r\nthan four half days. But I won't grumble any more, though it is hard\r\nwork to prevent doing so. Since receiving your note I have read over my\r\nchapter on Coral, and find I am prepared to stand by almost everything;\r\nit is much more cautiously and accurately written than I thought. I had\r\nset my heart upon having my volume completed before your new edition,\r\nbut not, you may believe me, for you to notice anything new in it (for\r\nthere is very little besides details), but you are the one man in Europe\r\nwhose opinion of the general truth of a toughish argument I should be\r\nalways most anxious to hear. My MS. is in such confusion, otherwise I\r\nam sure you should most willingly if it had been worth your while, have\r\nlooked at any part you choose....\r\n\r\n[In a letter to Fox (January 1841) he shows that his \"Species work\" was\r\nstill occupying his mind:--\r\n\r\n\"If you attend at all to Natural History I send you this P.S. as a\r\nmemento, that I continue to collect all kinds of facts about 'Varieties\r\nand Species,' for my some-day work to be so entitled; the smallest\r\ncontributions thankfully accepted; descriptions of offspring of all\r\ncrosses between all domestic birds and animals, dogs, cats, etc., etc.,\r\nvery valuable. Don't forget, if your half-bred African cat should die\r\nthat I should be very much obliged for its carcase sent up in a little\r\nhamper for the skeleton; it, or any cross-bred pigeons, fowl, duck,\r\netc., etc., will be more acceptable than the finest haunch of venison,\r\nor the finest turtle.\"\r\n\r\nLater in the year (September) he writes to Fox about his health, and\r\nalso with reference to his plan of moving into the country:--\r\n\r\n\"I have steadily been gaining ground, and really believe now I shall\r\nsome day be quite strong. I write daily for a couple of hours on my\r\nCoral volume, and take a little walk or ride every day. I grow very\r\ntired in the evenings, and am not able to go out at that time, or hardly\r\nto receive my nearest relations; but my life ceases to be burdensome now\r\nthat I can do something. We are taking steps to leave London, and live\r\nabout twenty miles from it on some railway.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n1842.\r\n\r\n[The record of work includes his volume on 'Coral Reefs' (A notice of\r\nthe Coral Reef work appeared in the Geograph. Soc. Journal, xii., page\r\n115.), the manuscript of which was at last sent to the printers in\r\nJanuary of this year, and the last proof corrected in May. He thus\r\nwrites of the work in his diary:--\r\n\r\n\"I commenced this work three years and seven months ago. Out of this\r\nperiod about twenty months (besides work during \"Beagle's\" voyage) has\r\nbeen spent on it, and besides it, I have only compiled the Bird part of\r\nZoology; Appendix to Journal, paper on Boulders, and corrected papers\r\non Glen Roy and earthquakes, reading on species, and rest all lost by\r\nillness.\"\r\n\r\nIn May and June he was at Shrewsbury and Maer, whence he went on to make\r\nthe little tour in Wales, of which he spoke in his 'Recollections,' and\r\nof which the results were published as \"Notes on the effects produced by\r\nthe ancient glaciers of Caernarvonshire, and on the Boulders transported\r\nby floating Ice.\" ('Philosophical Magazine,' 1842, page 352.)\r\n\r\nMr. Archibald Geikie speaks of this paper as standing \"almost at the\r\ntop of the long list of English contributions to the history of the Ice\r\nAge.\" (Charles Darwin, 'Nature' Series, page 23.)\r\n\r\nThe latter part of this year belongs to the period including the\r\nsettlement at Down, and is therefore dealt with in another chapter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.VIII. -- RELIGION.\r\n\r\n[The history of this part of my father's life may justly include some\r\nmention of his religious views. For although, as he points out, he did\r\nnot give continuous systematic thought to religious questions, yet we\r\nknow from his own words that about this time (1836-39) the subject was\r\nmuch before his mind.]\r\n\r\nIn his published works he was reticent on the matter of religion,\r\nand what he has left on the subject was not written with a view\r\nto publication. (As an exception may be mentioned, a few words of\r\nconcurrence with Dr. Abbot's 'Truths for the Times,' which my father\r\nallowed to be published in the \"Index\".)\r\n\r\nI believe that his reticence arose from several causes. He felt\r\nstrongly that a man's religion is an essentially private matter, and\r\none concerning himself alone. This is indicated by the following extract\r\nfrom a letter of 1879:--(Addressed to Mr. J. Fordyce, and published by\r\nhim in his 'Aspects of Scepticism,' 1883.)\r\n\r\n\"What my own views may be is a question of no consequence to any one\r\nbut myself. But, as you ask, I may state that my judgment often\r\nfluctuates...In my most extreme fluctuations I have never been an\r\nAtheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God. I think that\r\ngenerally (and more and more as I grow older), but not always, that an\r\nAgnostic would be the more correct description of my state of mind.\"\r\n\r\nHe naturally shrank from wounding the sensibilities of others in\r\nreligious matters, and he was also influenced by the consciousness\r\nthat a man ought not to publish on a subject to which he has not given\r\nspecial and continuous thought. That he felt this caution to apply\r\nto himself in the matter of religion is shown in a letter to Dr. F.E.\r\nAbbot, of Cambridge, U.S. (September 6, 1871). After explaining that the\r\nweakness arising from his bad health prevented him from feeling \"equal\r\nto deep reflection, on the deepest subject which can fill a man's mind,\"\r\nhe goes on to say: \"With respect to my former notes to you, I quite\r\nforget their contents. I have to write many letters, and can reflect but\r\nlittle on what I write; but I fully believe and hope that I have never\r\nwritten a word, which at the time I did not think; but I think you will\r\nagree with me, that anything which is to be given to the public ought to\r\nbe maturely weighed and cautiously put. It never occurred to me that you\r\nwould wish to print any extract from my notes: if it had, I would have\r\nkept a copy. I put 'private' from habit, only as yet partially acquired,\r\nfrom some hasty notes of mine having been printed, which were not in\r\nthe least degree worth printing, though otherwise unobjectionable. It is\r\nsimply ridiculous to suppose that my former note to you would be worth\r\nsending to me, with any part marked which you desire to print; but\r\nif you like to do so, I will at once say whether I should have any\r\nobjection. I feel in some degree unwilling to express myself publicly on\r\nreligious subjects, as I do not feel that I have thought deeply enough\r\nto justify any publicity.\"\r\n\r\nI may also quote from another letter to Dr. Abbot (November 16,\r\n1871), in which my father gives more fully his reasons for not feeling\r\ncompetent to write on religious and moral subjects:--\r\n\r\n\"I can say with entire truth that I feel honoured by your request that I\r\nshould become a contributor to the \"Index\", and am much obliged for the\r\ndraft. I fully, also, subscribe to the proposition that it is the duty\r\nof every one to spread what he believes to be the truth; and I honour\r\nyou for doing so, with so much devotion and zeal. But I cannot comply\r\nwith your request for the following reasons; and excuse me for giving\r\nthem in some detail, as I should be very sorry to appear in your eyes\r\nungracious. My health is very weak: I NEVER pass 24 hours without many\r\nhours of discomfort, when I can do nothing whatever. I have thus, also,\r\nlost two whole consecutive months this season. Owing to this weakness,\r\nand my head being often giddy, I am unable to master new subjects\r\nrequiring much thought, and can deal only with old materials. At no\r\ntime am I a quick thinker or writer: whatever I have done in science has\r\nsolely been by long pondering, patience and industry.\r\n\r\n\"Now I have never systematically thought much on religion in relation\r\nto science, or on morals in relation to society; and without steadily\r\nkeeping my mind on such subjects for a LONG period, I am really\r\nincapable of writing anything worth sending to the 'Index'.\"\r\n\r\nHe was more than once asked to give his views on religion, and he had,\r\nas a rule, no objection to doing so in a private letter. Thus in answer\r\nto a Dutch student he wrote (April 2, 1873):--\r\n\r\n\"I am sure you will excuse my writing at length, when I tell you that I\r\nhave long been much out of health, and am now staying away from my home\r\nfor rest.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to answer your question briefly; and I am not sure\r\nthat I could do so, even if I wrote at some length. But I may say that\r\nthe impossibility of conceiving that this grand and wondrous universe,\r\nwith our conscious selves, arose through chance, seems to me the chief\r\nargument for the existence of God; but whether this is an argument of\r\nreal value, I have never been able to decide. I am aware that if we\r\nadmit a first cause, the mind still craves to know whence it came, and\r\nhow it arose. Nor can I overlook the difficulty from the immense amount\r\nof suffering through the world. I am, also, induced to defer to a\r\ncertain extent to the judgment of the many able men who have fully\r\nbelieved in God; but here again I see how poor an argument this is. The\r\nsafest conclusion seems to me that the whole subject is beyond the scope\r\nof man's intellect; but man can do his duty.\"\r\n\r\nAgain in 1879 he was applied to by a German student, in a similar\r\nmanner. The letter was answered by a member of my father's family, who\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Darwin begs me to say that he receives so many letters, that he\r\ncannot answer them all.\r\n\r\n\"He considers that the theory of Evolution is quite compatible with the\r\nbelief in a God; but that you must remember that different persons have\r\ndifferent definitions of what they mean by God.\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, did not satisfy the German youth, who again wrote to my\r\nfather, and received from him the following reply:--\r\n\r\n\"I am much engaged, an old man, and out of health, and I cannot spare\r\ntime to answer your questions fully,--nor indeed can they be answered.\r\nScience has nothing to do with Christ, except in so far as the habit\r\nof scientific research makes a man cautious in admitting evidence. For\r\nmyself, I do not believe that there ever has been any revelation. As\r\nfor a future life, every man must judge for himself between conflicting\r\nvague probabilities.\"\r\n\r\nThe passages which here follow are extracts, somewhat abbreviated, from\r\na part of the Autobiography, written in 1876, in which my father gives\r\nthe history of his religious views:--\r\n\r\n\"During these two years (October 1836 to January 1839.) I was led to\r\nthink much about religion. Whilst on board the 'Beagle' I was quite\r\northodox, and I remember being heartily laughed at by several of the\r\nofficers (though themselves orthodox) for quoting the Bible as an\r\nunanswerable authority on some point of morality. I suppose it was the\r\nnovelty of the argument that amused them. But I had gradually come by\r\nthis time, i.e. 1836 to 1839, to see that the Old Testament was no more\r\nto be trusted than the sacred books of the Hindoos. The question then\r\ncontinually rose before my mind and would not be banished,--is it\r\ncredible that if God were now to make a revelation to the Hindoos, he\r\nwould permit it to be connected with the belief in Vishnu, Siva, etc.,\r\nas Christianity is connected with the Old Testament? This appeared to me\r\nutterly incredible.\r\n\r\n\"By further reflecting that the clearest evidence would be requisite\r\nto make any sane man believe in the miracles by which Christianity is\r\nsupported,--and that the more we know of the fixed laws of nature the\r\nmore incredible do miracles become,--that the men at that time were\r\nignorant and credulous to a degree almost incomprehensible by us,--that\r\nthe Gospels cannot be proved to have been written simultaneously\r\nwith the events,--that they differ in many important details, far too\r\nimportant, as it seemed to me, to be admitted as the usual inaccuracies\r\nof eye-witnesses;--by such reflections as these, which I give not\r\nas having the least novelty or value, but as they influenced me, I\r\ngradually came to disbelieve in Christianity as a divine revelation. The\r\nfact that many false religions have spread over large portions of the\r\nearth like wild-fire had some weight with me.\r\n\r\n\"But I was very unwilling to give up my belief; I feel sure of this, for\r\nI can well remember often and often inventing day-dreams of old letters\r\nbetween distinguished Romans, and manuscripts being discovered at\r\nPompeii or elsewhere, which confirmed in the most striking manner all\r\nthat was written in the Gospels. But I found it more and more difficult,\r\nwith free scope given to my imagination, to invent evidence which would\r\nsuffice to convince me. Thus disbelief crept over me at a very slow\r\nrate, but was at last complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n\"Although I did not think much about the existence of a personal God\r\nuntil a considerably later period of my life, I will here give the vague\r\nconclusions to which I have been driven. The old argument from design\r\nin Nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive,\r\nfails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered. We\r\ncan no longer argue that, for instance, the beautiful hinge of a bivalve\r\nshell must have been made by an intelligent being, like the hinge of\r\na door by man. There seems to be no more design in the variability of\r\norganic beings, and in the action of natural selection, than in the\r\ncourse which the wind blows. But I have discussed this subject at the\r\nend of my book on the 'Variations of Domesticated Animals and Plants'\r\n(My father asks whether we are to believe that the forms are preordained\r\nof the broken fragments of rock tumbled from a precipice which are\r\nfitted together by man to build his houses. If not, why should\r\nwe believe that the variations of domestic animals or plants are\r\npreordained for the sake of the breeder? \"But if we give up the\r\nprinciple in one case,... no shadow of reason can be assigned for the\r\nbelief that variations, alike in nature and the result of the same\r\ngeneral laws, which have been the groundwork through natural selection\r\nof the formation of the most perfectly adapted animals in the world, man\r\nincluded, were intentionally and specially guided.\"--'The Variation of\r\nAnimals and Plants,' 1st Edition volume ii. page 431.--F.D.), and the\r\nargument there given has never, as far as I can see, been answered.\r\n\r\n\"But passing over the endless beautiful adaptations which we everywhere\r\nmeet with, it may be asked how can the generally beneficent arrangement\r\nof the world be accounted for? Some writers indeed are so much impressed\r\nwith the amount of suffering in the world, that they doubt, if we look\r\nto all sentient beings, whether there is more of misery or of happiness;\r\nwhether the world as a whole is a good or bad one. According to my\r\njudgment happiness decidedly prevails, though this would be very\r\ndifficult to prove. If the truth of this conclusion be granted, it\r\nharmonises well with the effects which we might expect from natural\r\nselection. If all the individuals of any species were habitually to\r\nsuffer to an extreme degree, they would neglect to propagate their kind;\r\nbut we have no reason to believe that this has ever, or at least often\r\noccurred. Some other considerations, moreover, lead to the belief that\r\nall sentient beings have been formed so as to enjoy, as a general rule,\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\"Everyone who believes, as I do, that all the corporeal and\r\nmental organs (excepting those which are neither advantageous nor\r\ndisadvantageous to the possessor) of all beings have been developed\r\nthrough natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, together\r\nwith use or habit, will admit that these organs have been formed so that\r\ntheir possessors may compete successfully with other beings, and thus\r\nincrease in number. Now an animal may be led to pursue that course of\r\naction which is most beneficial to the species by suffering, such\r\nas pain, hunger, thirst, and fear; or by pleasure, as in eating and\r\ndrinking, and in the propagation of the species, etc.; or by both means\r\ncombined, as in the search for food. But pain or suffering of any kind,\r\nif long continued, causes depression and lessens the power of action,\r\nyet is well adapted to make a creature guard itself against any great\r\nor sudden evil. Pleasurable sensations, on the other hand, may be long\r\ncontinued without any depressing effect; on the contrary, they stimulate\r\nthe whole system to increased action. Hence it has come to pass that\r\nmost or all sentient beings have been developed in such a manner,\r\nthrough natural selection, that pleasurable sensations serve as their\r\nhabitual guides. We see this in the pleasure from exertion, even\r\noccasionally from great exertion of the body or mind,--in the pleasure\r\nof our daily meals, and especially in the pleasure derived from\r\nsociability, and from loving our families. The sum of such pleasures as\r\nthese, which are habitual or frequently recurrent, give, as I can hardly\r\ndoubt, to most sentient beings an excess of happiness over misery,\r\nalthough many occasionally suffer much. Such suffering is quite\r\ncompatible with the belief in Natural Selection, which is not perfect\r\nin its action, but tends only to render each species as successful\r\nas possible in the battle for life with other species, in wonderfully\r\ncomplex and changing circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"That there is much suffering in the world no one disputes. Some have\r\nattempted to explain this with reference to man by imagining that it\r\nserves for his moral improvement. But the number of men in the world\r\nis as nothing compared with that of all other sentient beings, and\r\nthey often suffer greatly without any moral improvement. This very old\r\nargument from the existence of suffering against the existence of an\r\nintelligent First Cause seems to me a strong one; whereas, as just\r\nremarked, the presence of much suffering agrees well with the view that\r\nall organic beings have been developed through variation and natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\n\"At the present day the most usual argument for the existence of an\r\nintelligent God is drawn from the deep inward conviction and feelings\r\nwhich are experienced by most persons.\r\n\r\n\"Formerly I was led by feelings such as those just referred to (although\r\nI do not think that the religious sentiment was ever strongly developed\r\nin me), to the firm conviction of the existence of God, and of the\r\nimmortality of the soul. In my Journal I wrote that whilst standing in\r\nthe midst of the grandeur of a Brazilian forest, \"it is not possible to\r\ngive an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder, admiration,\r\nand devotion, which fill and elevate the mind.\" I well remember my\r\nconviction that there is more in man than the mere breath of his body.\r\nBut now the grandest scenes would not cause any such convictions and\r\nfeelings to rise in my mind. It may be truly said that I am like a man\r\nwho has become colour-blind, and the universal belief by men of the\r\nexistence of redness makes my present loss of perception of not the\r\nleast value as evidence. This argument would be a valid one if all men\r\nof all races had the same inward conviction of the existence of one\r\nGod; but we know that this is very far from being the case. Therefore I\r\ncannot see that such inward convictions and feelings are of any weight\r\nas evidence of what really exists. The state of mind which grand scenes\r\nformerly excited in me, and which was intimately connected with a belief\r\nin God, did not essentially differ from that which is often called\r\nthe sense of sublimity; and however difficult it may be to explain the\r\ngenesis of this sense, it can hardly be advanced as an argument for the\r\nexistence of God, any more than the powerful though vague and similar\r\nfeelings excited by music.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to immortality, nothing shows me [so clearly] how strong\r\nand almost instinctive a belief it is, as the consideration of the view\r\nnow held by most physicists, namely, that the sun with all the planets\r\nwill in time grow too cold for life, unless indeed some great body\r\ndashes into the sun, and thus gives it fresh life. Believing as I do\r\nthat man in the distant future will be a far more perfect creature than\r\nhe now is, it is an intolerable thought that he and all other sentient\r\nbeings are doomed to complete annihilation after such long-continued\r\nslow progress. To those who fully admit the immortality of the human\r\nsoul, the destruction of our world will not appear so dreadful.\r\n\r\n\"Another source of conviction in the existence of God, connected with\r\nthe reason, and not with the feelings, impresses me as having much more\r\nweight. This follows from the extreme difficulty or rather impossibility\r\nof conceiving this immense and wonderful universe, including man with\r\nhis capacity of looking far backwards and far into futurity, as the\r\nresult of blind chance or necessity. When thus reflecting I feel\r\ncompelled to look to a First Cause having an intelligent mind in some\r\ndegree analogous to that of man; and I deserve to be called a Theist.\r\nThis conclusion was strong in my mind about the time, as far as I can\r\nremember, when I wrote the 'Origin of Species;' and it is since that\r\ntime that it has very gradually, with many fluctuations, become weaker.\r\nBut then arises the doubt, can the mind of man, which has, as I fully\r\nbelieve, been developed from a mind as low as that possessed by the\r\nlowest animals, be trusted when it draws such grand conclusions?\r\n\r\n\"I cannot pretend to throw the least light on such abstruse problems.\r\nThe mystery of the beginning of all things is insoluble by us; and I for\r\none must be content to remain an Agnostic.\"\r\n\r\n[The following letters repeat to some extent what has been given from\r\nthe Autobiography. The first one refers to 'The Boundaries of Science, a\r\nDialogue,' published in 'Macmillan's Magazine,' for July 1861.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MISS JULIA WEDGWOOD. July 11 [1861].\r\n\r\nSome one has sent us 'Macmillan'; and I must tell you how much I admire\r\nyour Article; though at the same time I must confess that I could not\r\nclearly follow you in some parts, which probably is in main part due\r\nto my not being at all accustomed to metaphysical trains of thought. I\r\nthink that you understand my book (The 'Origin of Species.') perfectly,\r\nand that I find a very rare event with my critics. The ideas in the\r\nlast page have several times vaguely crossed my mind. Owing to several\r\ncorrespondents I have been led lately to think, or rather to try to\r\nthink over some of the chief points discussed by you. But the result has\r\nbeen with me a maze--something like thinking on the origin of evil, to\r\nwhich you allude. The mind refuses to look at this universe, being what\r\nit is, without having been designed; yet, where one would most expect\r\ndesign, viz. in the structure of a sentient being, the more I think\r\non the subject, the less I can see proof of design. Asa Gray and some\r\nothers look at each variation, or at least at each beneficial variation\r\n(which A. Gray would compare with the rain drops (Dr. Gray's rain-drop\r\nmetaphor occurs in the Essay 'Darwin and his Reviewers' ('Darwiniana,'\r\npage 157): \"The whole animate life of a country depends absolutely upon\r\nthe vegetation, the vegetation upon the rain. The moisture is furnished\r\nby the ocean, is raised by the sun's heat from the ocean's surface, and\r\nis wafted inland by the winds. But what multitudes of rain-drops fall\r\nback into the ocean--are as much without a final cause as the incipient\r\nvarieties which come to nothing! Does it therefore follow that the rains\r\nwhich are bestowed upon the soil with such rule and average regularity\r\nwere not designed to support vegetable and animal life?\") which do not\r\nfall on the sea, but on to the land to fertilize it) as having been\r\nprovidentially designed. Yet when I ask him whether he looks at each\r\nvariation in the rock-pigeon, by which man has made by accumulation\r\na pouter or fantail pigeon, as providentially designed for man's\r\namusement, he does not know what to answer; and if he, or any one,\r\nadmits [that] these variations are accidental, as far as purpose is\r\nconcerned (of course not accidental as to their cause or origin); then I\r\ncan see no reason why he should rank the accumulated variations by which\r\nthe beautifully adapted woodpecker has been formed, as providentially\r\ndesigned. For it would be easy to imagine the enlarged crop of the\r\npouter, or tail of the fantail, as of some use to birds, in a state of\r\nnature, having peculiar habits of life. These are the considerations\r\nwhich perplex me about design; but whether you will care to hear them, I\r\nknow not....\r\n\r\n[On the subject of design, he wrote (July 1860) to Dr. Gray:\r\n\r\n\"One word more on 'designed laws' and 'undesigned results.' I see a bird\r\nwhich I want for food, take my gun and kill it, I do this DESIGNEDLY.\r\nAn innocent and good man stands under a tree and is killed by a flash\r\nof lightning. Do you believe (and I really should like to hear) that\r\nGod DESIGNEDLY killed this man? Many or most persons do believe this; I\r\ncan't and don't. If you believe so, do you believe that when a swallow\r\nsnaps up a gnat that God designed that that particular swallow should\r\nsnap up that particular gnat at that particular instant? I believe\r\nthat the man and the gnat are in the same predicament. If the death of\r\nneither man nor gnat are designed, I see no good reason to believe that\r\ntheir FIRST birth or production should be necessarily designed.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W. GRAHAM. Down, July 3rd, 1881.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI hope that you will not think it intrusive on my part to thank you\r\nheartily for the pleasure which I have derived from reading your\r\nadmirably written 'Creed of Science,' though I have not yet quite\r\nfinished it, as now that I am old I read very slowly. It is a very long\r\ntime since any other book has interested me so much. The work must have\r\ncost you several years and much hard labour with full leisure for work.\r\nYou would not probably expect any one fully to agree with you on so many\r\nabstruse subjects; and there are some points in your book which I cannot\r\ndigest. The chief one is that the existence of so-called natural laws\r\nimplies purpose. I cannot see this. Not to mention that many expect that\r\nthe several great laws will some day be found to follow inevitably from\r\nsome one single law, yet taking the laws as we now know them, and\r\nlook at the moon, where the law of gravitation--and no doubt of the\r\nconservation of energy--of the atomic theory, etc. etc., hold good, and\r\nI cannot see that there is then necessarily any purpose. Would there\r\nbe purpose if the lowest organisms alone, destitute of consciousness\r\nexisted in the moon? But I have had no practice in abstract reasoning,\r\nand I may be all astray. Nevertheless you have expressed my inward\r\nconviction, though far more vividly and clearly than I could have done,\r\nthat the Universe is not the result of chance. (The Duke of Argyll\r\n('Good Words,' Ap. 1885, page 244) has recorded a few words on this\r\nsubject, spoken by my father in the last year of his life. \"...in the\r\ncourse of that conversation I said to Mr. Darwin, with reference to some\r\nof his own remarkable works on the 'Fertilization of Orchids,' and\r\nupon 'The Earthworms,' and various other observations he made of the\r\nwonderful contrivances for certain purposes in nature--I said it was\r\nimpossible to look at these without seeing that they were the effect\r\nand the expression of mind. I shall never forget Mr. Darwin's answer.\r\nHe looked at me very hard and said, 'Well, that often comes over me with\r\noverwhelming force; but at other times,' and he shook his head vaguely,\r\nadding, 'it seems to go away.'\") But then with me the horrid doubt\r\nalways arises whether the convictions of man's mind, which has been\r\ndeveloped from the mind of the lower animals, are of any value or at all\r\ntrustworthy. Would any one trust in the convictions of a monkey's mind,\r\nif there are any convictions in such a mind? Secondly, I think that I\r\ncould make somewhat of a case against the enormous importance which you\r\nattribute to our greatest men; I have been accustomed to think, second,\r\nthird, and fourth rate men of very high importance, at least in the case\r\nof Science. Lastly, I could show fight on natural selection having done\r\nand doing more for the progress of civilization than you seem inclined\r\nto admit. Remember what risk the nations of Europe ran, not so many\r\ncenturies ago of being overwhelmed by the Turks, and how ridiculous such\r\nan idea now is! The more civilised so-called Caucasian races have beaten\r\nthe Turkish hollow in the struggle for existence. Looking to the world\r\nat no very distant date, what an endless number of the lower races will\r\nhave been eliminated by the higher civilized races throughout the world.\r\nBut I will write no more, and not even mention the many points in your\r\nwork which have much interested me. I have indeed cause to apologise for\r\ntroubling you with my impressions, and my sole excuse is the excitement\r\nin my mind which your book has aroused.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to remain, Dear Sir, Yours faithfully and obliged, CHARLES\r\nDARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[My father spoke little on these subjects, and I can contribute nothing\r\nfrom my own recollection of his conversation which can add to the\r\nimpression here given of his attitude towards Religion. Some further\r\nidea of his views may, however, be gathered from occasional remarks in\r\nhis letters.] (Dr. Aveling has published an account of a conversation\r\nwith my father. I think that the readers of this pamphlet ('The\r\nReligious Views of Charles Darwin,' Free Thought Publishing Company,\r\n1883) may be misled into seeing more resemblance than really existed\r\nbetween the positions of my father and Dr. Aveling: and I say this\r\nin spite of my conviction that Dr. Aveling gives quite fairly his\r\nimpressions of my father's views. Dr. Aveling tried to show that the\r\nterms \"Agnostic\" and \"Atheist\" were practically equivalent--that an\r\natheist is one who, without denying the existence of God, is without\r\nGod, inasmuch as he is unconvinced of the existence of a Deity. My\r\nfather's replies implied his preference for the unaggressive attitude\r\nof an Agnostic. Dr. Aveling seems (page 5) to regard the absence\r\nof aggressiveness in my father's views as distinguishing them in an\r\nunessential manner from his own. But, in my judgment, it is precisely\r\ndifferences of this kind which distinguish him so completely from the\r\nclass of thinkers to which Dr. Aveling belongs.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.IX. -- LIFE AT DOWN.\r\n\r\n1842-1854.\r\n\r\n\"My life goes on like clockwork, and I am fixed on the spot where I\r\nshall end it.\"\r\n\r\nLetter to Captain Fitz-Roy, October, 1846.\r\n\r\n[With the view of giving in the following chapters a connected account\r\nof the growth of the 'Origin of Species,' I have taken the more\r\nimportant letters bearing on that subject out of their proper\r\nchronological position here, and placed them with the rest of the\r\ncorrespondence bearing on the same subject; so that in the present group\r\nof letters we only get occasional hints of the growth of my father's\r\nviews, and we may suppose ourselves to be looking at his life, as it\r\nmight have been looked at by those who had no knowledge of the quiet\r\ndevelopment of his theory of evolution during this period.]\r\n\r\nOn September 14, 1842, my father left London with his family and settled\r\nat Down. (I must not omit to mention a member of the household who\r\naccompanied him. This was his butler, Joseph Parslow, who remained in\r\nthe family, a valued friend and servant, for forty years, and became as\r\nSir Joseph Hooker once remarked to me, \"an integral part of the\r\nfamily, and felt to be such by all visitors at the house.\") In the\r\nAutobiographical chapter, his motives for taking this step in the\r\ncountry are briefly given. He speaks of the attendance at scientific\r\nsocieties, and ordinary social duties, as suiting his health so \"badly\r\nthat we resolved to live in the country, which we both preferred and\r\nhave never repented of.\" His intention of keeping up with scientific\r\nlife in London is expressed in a letter to Fox (December, 1842):--\r\n\r\n\"I hope by going up to town for a night every fortnight or three weeks,\r\nto keep up my communication with scientific men and my own zeal, and so\r\nnot to turn into a complete Kentish hog.\"\r\n\r\nVisits to London of this kind were kept up for some years at the cost of\r\nmuch exertion on his part. I have often heard him speak of the wearisome\r\ndrives of ten miles to or from Croydon or Sydenham--the nearest\r\nstations--with an old gardener acting as coachman, who drove with great\r\ncaution and slowness up and down the many hills. In later years, all\r\nregular scientific intercourse with London became, as before mentioned,\r\nan impossibility.\r\n\r\nThe choice of Down was rather the result of despair than of actual\r\npreference; my father and mother were weary of house-hunting, and the\r\nattractive points about the place thus seemed to them to counterbalance\r\nits somewhat more obvious faults. It had at least one desideratum,\r\nnamely quietness. Indeed it would have been difficult to find a more\r\nretired place so near to London. In 1842 a coach drive of some twenty\r\nmiles was the only means of access to Down; and even now that railways\r\nhave crept closer to it, it is singularly out of the world, with nothing\r\nto suggest the neighbourhood of London, unless it be the dull haze of\r\nsmoke that sometimes clouds the sky. The village stands in an angle\r\nbetween two of the larger high-roads of the country, one leading to\r\nTunbridge and the other to Westerham and Edenbridge. It is cut off from\r\nthe Weald by a line of steep chalk hills on the south, and an abrupt\r\nhill, now smoothed down by a cutting and embankment, must formerly\r\nhave been something of a barrier against encroachments from the side\r\nof London. In such a situation, a village, communicating with the main\r\nlines of traffic, only by stony tortuous lanes, may well have been\r\nenabled to preserve its retired character. Nor is it hard to believe in\r\nthe smugglers and their strings of pack-horses making their way up from\r\nthe lawless old villages of the Weald, of which the memory still existed\r\nwhen my father settled in Down. The village stands on solitary upland\r\ncountry, 500 to 600 feet above the sea,-- a country with little natural\r\nbeauty, but possessing a certain charm in the shaws, or straggling\r\nstrips of wood, capping the chalky banks and looking down upon the quiet\r\nploughed lands of the valleys. The village, of three or four hundred\r\ninhabitants, consists of three small streets of cottages meeting in\r\nfront of the little flint-built church. It is a place where new-comers\r\nare seldom seen, and the names occurring far back in the old church\r\nregisters are still well-known in the village. The smock-frock is not\r\nyet quite extinct, though chiefly used as a ceremonial dress by the\r\n\"bearers\" at funerals: but as a boy I remember the purple or green\r\nsmocks of the men at church.\r\n\r\nThe house stands a quarter of a mile from the village, and is built,\r\nlike so many houses of the last century, as near as possible to the\r\nroad--a narrow lane winding away to the Westerham high-road. In 1842,\r\nit was dull and unattractive enough: a square brick building of three\r\nstoreys, covered with shabby whitewash and hanging tiles. The garden\r\nhad none of the shrubberies or walls that now give shelter; it was\r\noverlooked from the lane, and was open, bleak, and desolate. One of my\r\nfather's first undertakings was to lower the lane by about two feet, and\r\nto build a flint wall along that part of it which bordered the garden.\r\nThe earth thus excavated was used in making banks and mounds round the\r\nlawn: these were planted with evergreens, which now give to the garden\r\nits retired and sheltered character.\r\n\r\nThe house was made to look neater by being covered with stucco, but the\r\nchief improvement effected was the building of a large bow extending\r\nup through three storeys. This bow became covered with a tangle of\r\ncreepers, and pleasantly varied the south side of the house. The\r\ndrawing-room, with its verandah opening into the garden, as well as the\r\nstudy in which my father worked during the later years of his life, were\r\nadded at subsequent dates.\r\n\r\nEighteen acres of land were sold with the house, of which twelve acres\r\non the south side of the house formed a pleasant field, scattered with\r\nfair-sized oaks and ashes. From this field a strip was cut off and\r\nconverted into a kitchen garden, in which the experimental plot of\r\nground was situated, and where the greenhouses were ultimately put up.\r\n\r\nThe following letter to Mr. Fox (March 28th, 1843) gives among other\r\nthings my father's early impressions of Down:--\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you all the trifling particulars about myself that I can\r\nthink of. We are now exceedingly busy with the first brick laid down\r\nyesterday to an addition to our house; with this, with almost making a\r\nnew kitchen garden and sundry other projected schemes, my days are\r\nvery full. I find all this very bad for geology, but I am very slowly\r\nprogressing with a volume, or rather pamphlet, on the volcanic islands\r\nwhich we visited: I manage only a couple of hours per day and that not\r\nvery regularly. It is uphill work writing books, which cost money in\r\npublishing, and which are not read even by geologists. I forget whether\r\nI ever described this place: it is a good, very ugly house with 18\r\nacres, situated on a chalk flat, 560 feet above sea. There are peeps\r\nof far distant country and the scenery is moderately pretty: its chief\r\nmerit is its extreme rurality. I think I was never in a more perfectly\r\nquiet country. Three miles south of us the great chalk escarpment\r\nquite cuts us off from the low country of Kent, and between us and the\r\nescarpment there is not a village or gentleman's house, but only great\r\nwoods and arable fields (the latter in sadly preponderant numbers) so\r\nthat we are absolutely at the extreme verge of the world. The whole\r\ncountry is intersected by foot-paths; but the surface over the chalk\r\nis clayey and sticky, which is the worst feature in our purchase. The\r\ndingles and banks often remind me of Cambridgeshire and walks with you\r\nto Cherry Hinton, and other places, though the general aspect of the\r\ncountry is very different. I was looking over my arranged cabinet\r\n(the only remnant I have preserved of all my English insects), and was\r\nadmiring Panagaeus Crux-major: it is curious the vivid manner in\r\nwhich this insect calls up in my mind your appearance, with little Fan\r\ntrotting after, when I was first introduced to you. Those entomological\r\ndays were very pleasant ones. I am VERY much stronger corporeally,\r\nbut am little better in being able to stand mental fatigue, or rather\r\nexcitement, so that I cannot dine out or receive visitors, except\r\nrelations with whom I can pass some time after dinner in silence.\"\r\n\r\nI could have wished to give here some idea of the position which, at\r\nthis period of his life, my father occupied among scientific men and\r\nthe reading public generally. But contemporary notices are few and of\r\nno particular value for my purpose,--which therefore must, in spite of a\r\ngood deal of pains, remain unfulfilled.\r\n\r\nHis 'Journal of Researches' was then the only one of his books which had\r\nany chance of being commonly known. But the fact that it was published\r\nwith the 'Voyages' of Captains King and Fitz-Roy probably interfered\r\nwith its general popularity. Thus Lyell wrote to him in 1838 ('Lyell's\r\nLife,' ii. page 43), \"I assure you my father is quite enthusiastic about\r\nyour journal...and he agrees with me that it would have a large sale if\r\npublished separately. He was disappointed at hearing that it was to be\r\nfettered by the other volumes, for, although he should equally buy it,\r\nhe feared so many of the public would be checked from doing so.\" In\r\na notice of the three voyages in the 'Edinburgh Review' (July, 1839),\r\nthere is nothing leading a reader to believe that he would find it more\r\nattractive than its fellow-volumes. And, as a fact, it did not become\r\nwidely known until it was separately published in 1845. It may be\r\nnoted, however, that the 'Quarterly Review' (December, 1839) called the\r\nattention of its readers to the merits of the 'Journal' as a book of\r\ntravels. The reviewer speaks of the \"charm arising from the freshness of\r\nheart which is thrown over these virgin pages of a strong intellectual\r\nman and an acute and deep observer.\"\r\n\r\nThe German translation (1844) of the 'Journal' received a favourable\r\nnotice in No. 12 of the 'Heidelberger Jahrbucher der Literatur,'\r\n1847--where the Reviewer speaks of the author's \"varied canvas, on\r\nwhich he sketches in lively colours the strange customs of those\r\ndistant regions with their remarkable fauna, flora and geological\r\npeculiarities.\" Alluding to the translation, my father writes--\"Dr.\r\nDieffenbach...has translated my 'Journal' into German, and I must, with\r\nunpardonable vanity, boast that it was at the instigation of Liebig and\r\nHumboldt.\"\r\n\r\nThe geological work of which he speaks in the above letter to Mr. Fox\r\noccupied him for the whole of 1843, and was published in the spring\r\nof the following year. It was entitled 'Geological Observations on the\r\nVolcanic Islands, visited during the voyage of H.M.S. \"Beagle\", together\r\nwith some brief notices on the geology of Australia and the Cape of Good\r\nHope': it formed the second part of the 'Geology of the Voyage of the\r\n\"Beagle\",' published \"with the Approval of the Lords Commissioners of\r\nHer Majesty's Treasury.\" The volume on 'Coral Reefs' forms Part I. of\r\nthe series, and was published, as we have seen, in 1842. For the sake\r\nof the non-geological reader, I may here quote Professor Geikie's words\r\n(Charles Darwin, 'Nature' Series, 1882.) on these two volumes--which\r\nwere up to this time my father's chief geological works. Speaking of the\r\n'Coral Reefs,' he says:--page 17, \"This well-known treatise, the most\r\noriginal of all its author's geological memoirs, has become one of the\r\nclassics of geological literature. The origin of those remarkable rings\r\nof coral-rock in mid-ocean has given rise to much speculation, but no\r\nsatisfactory solution of the problem has been proposed. After visiting\r\nmany of them, and examining also coral reefs that fringe islands and\r\ncontinents, he offered a theory which for simplicity and grandeur\r\nstrikes every reader with astonishment. It is pleasant, after the lapse\r\nof many years, to recall the delight with which one first read the\r\n'Coral Reefs'; how one watched the facts being marshalled into their\r\nplaces, nothing being ignored or passed lightly over; and how, step by\r\nstep, one was led to the grand conclusion of wide oceanic subsidence. No\r\nmore admirable example of scientific method was ever given to the world,\r\nand even if he had written nothing else, the treatise alone would have\r\nplaced Darwin in the very front of investigators of nature.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to see in the following extract from one of Lyell's\r\nletters (To Sir John Herschel, May 24, 1837. 'Life of Sir Charles\r\nLyell,' vol. ii. page 12.) how warmly and readily he embraced the\r\ntheory. The extract also gives incidentally some idea of the theory\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"I am very full of Darwin's new theory of Coral Islands, and have urged\r\nWhewell to make him read it at our next meeting. I must give up my\r\nvolcanic crater theory for ever, though it cost me a pang at first,\r\nfor it accounted for so much, the annular form, the central lagoon, the\r\nsudden rising of an isolated mountain in a deep sea; all went so well\r\nwith the notion of submerged, crateriform, and conical volcanoes,... and\r\nthen the fact that in the South Pacific we had scarcely any rocks in the\r\nregions of coral islands, save two kinds, coral limestone and volcanic!\r\nYet spite of all this, the whole theory is knocked on the head, and the\r\nannular shape and central lagoon have nothing to do with volcanoes, nor\r\neven with a crateriform bottom. Perhaps Darwin told you when at the\r\nCape what he considers the true cause? Let any mountain be submerged\r\ngradually, and coral grow in the sea in which it is sinking, and there\r\nwill be a ring of coral, and finally only a lagoon in the centre. Why?\r\nFor the same reason that a barrier reef of coral grows along certain\r\ncoasts: Australia, etc. Coral islands are the last efforts of drowning\r\ncontinents to lift their heads above water. Regions of elevation and\r\nsubsidence in the ocean may be traced by the state of the coral reefs.\"\r\nThere is little to be said as to published contemporary criticism.\r\nThe book was not reviewed in the 'Quarterly Review' till 1847, when\r\na favourable notice was given. The reviewer speaks of the \"bold and\r\nstartling\" character of the work, but seems to recognize the fact that\r\nthe views are generally accepted by geologists. By that time the minds\r\nof men were becoming more ready to receive geology of this type. Even\r\nten years before, in 1837, Lyell ('Life of Sir Charles Lyell,' vol. ii.\r\npage 6.) says, \"people are now much better prepared to believe Darwin\r\nwhen he advances proofs of the slow rise of the Andes, than they were\r\nin 1830, when I first startled them with that doctrine.\" This sentence\r\nrefers to the theory elaborated in my father's geological observations\r\non South America (1846), but the gradual change in receptivity of the\r\ngeological mind must have been favourable to all his geological work.\r\nNevertheless, Lyell seems at first not to have expected any ready\r\nacceptance of the Coral theory; thus he wrote to my father in 1837:--\"I\r\ncould think of nothing for days after your lesson on coral reefs, but\r\nof the tops of submerged continents. It is all true, but do not flatter\r\nyourself that you will be believed till you are growing bald like me,\r\nwith hard work and vexation at the incredulity of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe second part of the 'Geology of the Voyage of the \"Beagle\",' i.e. the\r\nvolume on Volcanic Islands, which specially concerns us now, cannot\r\nbe better described than by again quoting from Professor Geikie (page\r\n18):--\r\n\r\n\"Full of detailed observations, this work still remains the best\r\nauthority on the general geological structure of most of the regions it\r\ndescribes. At the time it was written the 'crater of elevation theory,'\r\nthough opposed by Constant Prevost, Scrope, and Lyell, was generally\r\naccepted, at least on the Continent. Darwin, however, could not receive\r\nit as a valid explanation of the facts; and though he did not share the\r\nview of its chief opponents, but ventured to propose a hypothesis of\r\nhis own, the observations impartially made and described by him in this\r\nvolume must be regarded as having contributed towards the final solution\r\nof the difficulty.\" Professor Geikie continues (page 21): \"He is one\r\nof the earliest writers to recognize the magnitude of the denudation to\r\nwhich even recent geological accumulations have been subjected. One of\r\nthe most impressive lessons to be learnt from his account of 'Volcanic\r\nIslands' is the prodigious extent to which they have been denuded...He\r\nwas disposed to attribute more of this work to the sea than most\r\ngeologists would now admit; but he lived himself to modify his original\r\nviews, and on this subject his latest utterances are quite abreast of\r\nthe time.\"\r\n\r\nAn extract from a letter of my father's to Lyell shows his estimate\r\nof his own work. \"You have pleased me much by saying that you intend\r\nlooking through my 'Volcanic Islands': it cost me eighteen months!!! and\r\nI have heard of very few who have read it. Now I shall feel, whatever\r\nlittle (and little it is) there is confirmatory of old work, or new,\r\nwill work its effect and not be lost.\"\r\n\r\nThe third of his geological books, 'Geological Observations on South\r\nAmerica,' may be mentioned here, although it was not published until\r\n1846. \"In this work the author embodied all the materials collected by\r\nhim for the illustration of South American Geology, save some which have\r\nbeen published elsewhere. One of the most important features of the book\r\nwas the evidence which it brought forward to prove the slow interrupted\r\nelevation of the South American Continent during a recent geological\r\nperiod.\" (Geikie, loc. cit.)\r\n\r\nOf this book my father wrote to Lyell:--\"My volume will be about 240\r\npages, dreadfully dull, yet much condensed. I think whenever you have\r\ntime to look through it, you will think the collection of facts on the\r\nelevation of the land and on the formation of terraces pretty good.\"\r\n\r\nOf his special geological work as a whole, Professor Geikie, while\r\npointing out that it was not \"of the same epoch-making kind as his\r\nbiological researches,\" remarks that he \"gave a powerful impulse to\" the\r\ngeneral reception of Lyell's teaching \"by the way in which he gathered\r\nfrom all parts of the world facts in its support.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWORK OF THE PERIOD 1842 TO 1854.\r\n\r\nThe work of these years may be roughly divided into a period of geology\r\nfrom 1842 to 1846, and one of zoology from 1846 onwards.\r\n\r\nI extract from his diary notices of the time spent on his geological\r\nbooks and on his 'Journal.'\r\n\r\n'Volcanic Islands.'

His volumes on the\r\nFossil Cirripedes were published by the Palaeontographical Society in\r\n1851 and 1854.\r\n\r\nSome account of these volumes will be given later.\r\n\r\nThe minor works may be placed together, independently of subject matter.\r\n\r\n\"Observations on the Structure, etc., of the genus Sagitta,\" Ann.

It is chiefly to enquire in what paper he has described the Boulders\r\non Arthur's Seat. Mr. D. Milne in the last Edinburgh 'New Phil. Journal'\r\n[1847], has a long paper on it. He says: 'Some glacialists have ventured\r\nto explain the transportation of boulders even in the situation of those\r\nnow referred to, by imagining that they were transported on ice floes,'\r\netc. He treats this view, and the scratching of rocks by icebergs, as\r\nalmost absurd...he has finally stirred me up so, that (without you\r\nwould answer him) I think I will send a paper in opposition to the same\r\nJournal. I can thus introduce some old remarks of mine, and some new,\r\nand will insist on your capital observations in N. America. It is a bore\r\nto stop one's work, but he has made me quite wroth.\")\r\n\r\nThe article \"Geology,\" in the Admiralty Manual of Scientific Enquiry\r\n(1849), pages 156-195.

Proc.' ii., 1851, pages 17-18.\r\n\r\nProfessor Geikie has been so good as to give me (in a letter dated\r\nNovember 1885) his impressions of my father's article in the 'Admiralty\r\nManual.' He mentions the following points as characteristic of the\r\nwork:--\r\n\r\n\"1. Great breadth of view. No one who had not practically studied and\r\nprofoundly reflected on the questions discussed could have written it.\r\n\r\n\"2. The insight so remarkable in all that Mr. Darwin ever did. The way\r\nin which he points out lines of enquiry that would elucidate geological\r\nproblems is eminently typical of him. Some of these lines have never yet\r\nbeen adequately followed; so with regard to them he was in advance of\r\nhis time.\r\n\r\n\"3. Interesting and sympathetic treatment. The author at once puts his\r\nreaders into harmony with him. He gives them enough of information to\r\nshow how delightful the field is to which he invites them, and how much\r\nthey might accomplish in it. There is a broad sketch of the subject\r\nwhich everybody can follow, and there is enough of detail to instruct\r\nand guide a beginner and start him on the right track.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, geology has made great strides since 1849, and the article,\r\nif written now, would need to take notice of other branches of inquiry,\r\nand to modify statements which are not now quite accurate; but most of\r\nthe advice Mr. Darwin gives is as needful and valuable now as when it\r\nwas given. It is curious to see with what unerring instinct he seems to\r\nhave fastened on the principles that would stand the test of time.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Lyell (1853) my father wrote, \"I went up for a paper by\r\nthe Arctic Dr. Sutherland, on ice action, read only in abstract, but I\r\nshould think with much good matter. It was very pleasant to hear that it\r\nwas written owing to the Admiralty Manual.\"\r\n\r\nTo give some idea of the retired life which now began for my father at\r\nDown, I have noted from his diary the short periods during which he was\r\naway from home between the autumn of 1842, when he came to Down, and the\r\nend of 1854.\r\n\r\n  1843 July.--Week at Maer and Shrewsbury.\r\n         October.--Twelve days at Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n  1844 April.--Week at Maer and Shrewsbury.\r\n         July.--Twelve days at Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n  1845 September 15.--Six weeks, \"Shrewsbury, Lincolnshire, York,\r\n         the Dean of Manchester, Waterton, Chatsworth.\"\r\n\r\n  1846 February.--Eleven days at Shrewsbury.\r\n         July.--Ten days at Shrewsbury.\r\n         September.--Ten days at Southampton, etc., for the British\r\n         Association.\r\n\r\n  1847 February.--Twelve days at Shrewsbury.\r\n         June.--Ten days at Oxford, etc., for the British Association.\r\n         October.--Fortnight at Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n  1848 May.--Fortnight at Shrewsbury.\r\n         July.--Week at Swanage.\r\n         October.--Fortnight at Shrewsbury.\r\n         November.--Eleven days at Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n  1849 March to June.--Sixteen weeks at Malvern.\r\n         September.--Eleven days at Birmingham for the\r\n         British Association.\r\n\r\n  1850 June.--Week at Malvern.\r\n        August.--Week at Leith Hill, the house of a relative.\r\n        October.--Week at the house of another relative.\r\n\r\n 1851 March.--Week at Malvern.\r\n        April.--Nine days at Malvern.\r\n        July.--Twelve days in London.\r\n\r\n 1852 March.--Week at Rugby and Shrewsbury.\r\n        September.--Six days at the house of a relative.\r\n\r\n 1853 July.--Three weeks at Eastbourne.\r\n        August.--Five days at the military Camp at Chobham.\r\n\r\n 1854 March.--Five days at the house of a relative.\r\n        July.--Three days at the house of a relative.\r\n        October.--Six days at the house of a relative.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that he was absent from home sixty weeks in twelve\r\nyears. But it must be remembered that much of the remaining time spent\r\nat Down was lost through ill-health.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO R. FITZ-ROY. Down [March 31st, 1843].\r\n\r\nDear Fitz-Roy,\r\n\r\nI read yesterday with surprise and the greatest interest, your\r\nappointment as Governor of New Zealand. I do not know whether to\r\ncongratulate you on it, but I am sure I may the Colony, on possessing\r\nyour zeal and energy. I am most anxious to know whether the report is\r\ntrue, for I cannot bear the thoughts of your leaving the country without\r\nseeing you once again; the past is often in my memory, and I feel that\r\nI owe to you much bygone enjoyment, and the whole destiny of my\r\nlife, which (had my health been stronger) would have been one full of\r\nsatisfaction to me. During the last three months I have never once\r\ngone up to London without intending to call in the hopes of seeing Mrs.\r\nFitz-Roy and yourself; but I find, most unfortunately for myself,\r\nthat the little excitement of breaking out of my most quiet routine so\r\ngenerally knocks me up, that I am able to do scarcely anything when in\r\nLondon, and I have not even been able to attend one evening meeting of\r\nthe Geological Society. Otherwise, I am very well, as are, thank God, my\r\nwife and two children. The extreme retirement of this place suits us all\r\nvery well, and we enjoy our country life much. But I am writing trifles\r\nabout myself, when your mind and time must be fully occupied. My object\r\nin writing is to beg of you or Mrs. Fitz-Roy to have the kindness to\r\nsend me one line to say whether it is true, and whether you sail soon.\r\nI shall come up next week for one or two days; could you see me for even\r\nfive minutes, if I called early on Thursday morning, viz. at nine or ten\r\no'clock, or at whatever hour (if you keep early ship hours) you finish\r\nyour breakfast. Pray remember me very kindly to Mrs. Fitz-Roy, who I\r\ntrust is able to look at her long voyage with boldness.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, dear Fitz-Roy, Your ever truly obliged, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[A quotation from another letter (1846) to Fitz-Roy may be worth giving,\r\nas showing my father's affectionate remembrance of his old Captain.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, dear Fitz-Roy, I often think of your many acts of kindness\r\nto me, and not seldomest on the time, no doubt quite forgotten by you,\r\nwhen, before making Madeira, you came and arranged my hammock with\r\nyour own hands, and which, as I afterwards heard, brought tears into my\r\nfather's eyes.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. [Down, September 5, 1843.] Monday morning.\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nWhen I sent off the glacier paper, I was just going out and so had no\r\ntime to write. I hope your friend will enjoy (and I wish you were going\r\nthere with him) his tour as much as I did. It was a kind of geological\r\nnovel. But your friend must have patience, for he will not get a good\r\nGLACIAL EYE for a few days. Murchison and Count Keyserling RUSHED\r\nthrough North Wales the same autumn and could see nothing except the\r\neffects of rain trickling over the rocks! I cross-examined Murchison\r\na little, and evidently saw he had looked carefully at nothing. I feel\r\nCERTAIN about the glacier-effects in North Wales. Get up your steam,\r\nif this weather lasts, and have a ramble in Wales; its glorious scenery\r\nmust do every one's heart and body good. I wish I had energy to come to\r\nDelamere and go with you; but as you observe, you might as well ask\r\nSt. Paul's. Whenever I give myself a trip, it shall be, I think, to\r\nScotland, to hunt for more parallel roads. My marine theory for these\r\nroads was for a time knocked on the head by Agassiz ice-work, but it is\r\nnow reviving again...\r\n\r\nFarewell,--we are getting nearly finished--almost all the workmen gone,\r\nand the gravel laying down on the walks. Ave Maria! how the money does\r\ngo. There are twice as many temptations to extravagance in the country\r\ncompared with London. Adios.\r\n\r\nYours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1844?].\r\n\r\n...I have also read the 'Vestiges,' ('The Vestiges of the Natural\r\nHistory of Creation' was published anonymously in 1844, and is\r\nconfidently believed to have been written by the late Robert Chambers.\r\nMy father's copy gives signs of having been carefully read, a long list\r\nof marked passages being pinned in at the end. One useful lesson he\r\nseems to have learned from it. He writes: \"The idea of a fish passing\r\ninto a reptile, monstrous. I will not specify any genealogies--much too\r\nlittle known at present.\" He refers again to the book in a letter to\r\nFox, February, 1845: \"Have you read that strange, unphilosophical but\r\ncapitally-written book, the 'Vestiges': it has made more talk than any\r\nwork of late, and has been by some attributed to me--at which I ought to\r\nbe much flattered and unflattered.\"), but have been somewhat less amused\r\nat it than you appear to have been: the writing and arrangement are\r\ncertainly admirable, but his geology strikes me as bad, and his zoology\r\nfar worse. I should be very much obliged, if at any future or leisure\r\ntime you could tell me on what you ground your doubtful belief in\r\nimagination of a mother affecting her offspring. (This refers to the\r\ncase of a relative of Sir J. Hooker's, who insisted that a mole, which\r\nappeared on one of her children, was the effect of fright upon herself\r\non having, before the birth of the child, blotted with sepia a copy\r\nof Turner's 'Liber Studiorum' that had been lent to her with special\r\ninjunctions to be careful.) I have attended to the several statements\r\nscattered about, but do not believe in more than accidental\r\ncoincidences. W. Hunter told my father, then in a lying-in hospital,\r\nthat in many thousand cases, he had asked the mother, BEFORE HER\r\nCONFINEMENT, whether anything had affected her imagination, and recorded\r\nthe answers; and absolutely not one case came right, though, when the\r\nchild was anything remarkable, they afterwards made the cap to fit.\r\nReproduction seems governed by such similar laws in the whole animal\r\nkingdom, that I am most loth [to believe]...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.M. HERBERT. Down [1844 or 1845].\r\n\r\nMy dear Herbert,\r\n\r\nI was very glad to see your handwriting and hear a bit of news about\r\nyou. Though you cannot come here this autumn, I do hope you and Mrs.\r\nHerbert will come in the winter, and we will have lots of talk of old\r\ntimes, and lots of Beethoven.\r\n\r\nI have little or rather nothing to say about myself; we live like\r\nclock-work, and in what most people would consider the dullest\r\npossible manner. I have of late been slaving extra hard, to the great\r\ndiscomfiture of wretched digestive organs, at South America, and thank\r\nall the fates, I have done three-fourths of it. Writing plain English\r\ngrows with me more and more difficult, and never attainable. As for your\r\npretending that you will read anything so dull as my pure geological\r\ndescriptions, lay not such a flattering unction on my soul (On the same\r\nsubject he wrote to Fitz-Roy: \"I have sent my 'South American Geology'\r\nto Dover Street, and you will get it, no doubt, in the course of time.\r\nYou do not know what you threaten when you propose to read it--it is\r\npurely geological. I said to my brother, 'You will of course read it,'\r\nand his answer was, 'Upon my life, I would sooner even buy it.'\") for\r\nit is incredible. I have long discovered that geologists never read each\r\nother's works, and that the only object in writing a book is a proof of\r\nearnestness, and that you do not form your opinions without undergoing\r\nlabour of some kind. Geology is at present very oral, and what I here\r\nsay is to a great extent quite true. But I am giving you a discussion as\r\nlong as a chapter in the odious book itself.\r\n\r\nI have lately been to Shrewsbury, and found my father surprisingly well\r\nand cheerful.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear old friend, ever yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Monday [February 10th, 1845].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your very agreeable letter; it was very\r\ngood-natured, in the midst of your scientific and theatrical\r\ndissipation, to think of writing so long a letter to me. I am astonished\r\nat your news, and I must condole with you in your PRESENT view of the\r\nProfessorship (Sir J.D. Hooker was a candidate for the Professorship of\r\nBotany at Edinburgh University.), and most heartily deplore it on my\r\nown account. There is something so chilling in a separation of so many\r\nhundred miles, though we did not see much of each other when nearer.\r\nYou will hardly believe how deeply I regret for MYSELF your present\r\nprospects. I had looked forward to [our] seeing much of each other\r\nduring our lives. It is a heavy disappointment; and in a mere selfish\r\npoint of view, as aiding me in my work, your loss is indeed irreparable.\r\nBut, on the other hand, I cannot doubt that you take at present a\r\ndesponding, instead of bright, view of your prospects: surely there\r\nare great advantages, as well as disadvantages. The place is one of\r\neminence; and really it appears to me there are so many indifferent\r\nworkers, and so few readers, that it is a high advantage, in a purely\r\nscientific point of view, for a good worker to hold a position which\r\nleads others to attend to his work. I forget whether you attended\r\nEdinburgh, as a student, but in my time there was a knot of men who were\r\nfar from being the indifferent and dull listeners which you expect for\r\nyour audience. Reflect what a satisfaction and honour it would be to\r\nMAKE a good botanist--with your disposition you will be to many what\r\nHenslow was at Cambridge to me and others, a most kind friend and guide.\r\nThen what a fine garden, and how good a Public Library! why, Forbes\r\nalways regrets the advantages of Edinburgh for work: think of the\r\ninestimable advantage of getting within a short walk of those noble\r\nrocks and hills and sandy shores near Edinburgh! Indeed, I cannot\r\npity you much, though I pity myself exceedingly in your loss. Surely\r\nlecturing will, in a year or two, with your GREAT capacity for work\r\n(whatever you may be pleased to say to the contrary) become easy, and\r\nyou will have a fair time for your Antarctic Flora and general views of\r\ndistribution. If I thought your Professorship would stop your work, I\r\nshould wish it and all the good worldly consequences at el Diavolo. I\r\nknow I shall live to see you the first authority in Europe on that grand\r\nsubject, that almost keystone of the laws of creation, Geographical\r\nDistribution. Well, there is one comfort, you will be at Kew, no doubt,\r\nevery year, so I shall finish by forcing down your throat my sincere\r\ncongratulations. Thanks for all your news. I grieve to hear Humboldt is\r\nfailing; one cannot help feeling, though unrightly, that such an end is\r\nhumiliating: even when I saw him he talked beyond all reason. If you see\r\nhim again, pray give him my most respectful and kind compliments, and\r\nsay that I never forget that my whole course of life is due to having\r\nread and re-read as a youth his 'Personal Narrative.' How true\r\nand pleasing are all your remarks on his kindness; think how many\r\nopportunities you will have, in your new place, of being a Humboldt\r\nto others. Ask him about the river in N.E. Europe, with the Flora very\r\ndifferent on its opposite banks. I have got and read your Wilkes; what a\r\nfeeble book in matter and style, and how splendidly got up! Do write me\r\na line from Berlin. Also thanks for the proof-sheets. I do not,\r\nhowever, mean proof plates; I value them, as saving me copying extracts.\r\nFarewell, my dear Hooker, with a heavy heart I wish you joy of your\r\nprospects.\r\n\r\nYour sincere friend,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The second edition of the 'Journal,' to which the following letter\r\nrefers, was completed between April 25th and August 25th. It was\r\npublished by Mr. Murray in the 'Colonial and Home Library,' and in this\r\nmore accessible form soon had a large sale.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of his first negotiations with Mr. Murray for its\r\npublication in this form, he had received payment only in the form of a\r\nlarge number of presentation copies, and he seems to have been glad to\r\nsell the copyright of the second edition to Mr. Murray for 150 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe points of difference between it and the first edition are of\r\ninterest chiefly in connection with the growth of the author's views on\r\nevolution, and will be considered later.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down [July, 1845].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI send you the first part (No doubt proof-sheets.) of the new edition\r\n[of the 'Journal of Researches'], which I so entirely owe to you. You\r\nwill see that I have ventured to dedicate it to you (The dedication of\r\nthe second edition of the 'Journal of Researches,' is as follows:--\"To\r\nCharles Lyell, Esq., F.R.S., this second edition is dedicated with\r\ngrateful pleasure--as an acknowledgment that the chief part of whatever\r\nscientific merit this Journal and the other works of the Author may\r\npossess, has been derived from studying the well-known and admirable\r\n'Principles of Geology.'\"), and I trust that this cannot be\r\ndisagreeable. I have long wished, not so much for your sake, as for\r\nmy own feelings of honesty, to acknowledge more plainly than by mere\r\nreference, how much I geologically owe you. Those authors, however, who\r\nlike you, educate people's minds as well as teach them special facts,\r\ncan never, I should think, have full justice done them except by\r\nposterity, for the mind thus insensibly improved can hardly perceive its\r\nown upward ascent. I had intended putting in the present acknowledgment\r\nin the third part of my Geology, but its sale is so exceedingly small\r\nthat I should not have had the satisfaction of thinking that as far as\r\nlay in my power I had owned, though imperfectly, my debt. Pray do not\r\nthink that I am so silly, as to suppose that my dedication can any ways\r\ngratify you, except so far as I trust you will receive it, as a most\r\nsincere mark of my gratitude and friendship. I think I have improved\r\nthis edition, especially the second part, which I have just finished.\r\nI have added a good deal about the Fuegians, and cut down into half\r\nthe mercilessly long discussion on climate and glaciers, etc. I do not\r\nrecollect anything added to the first part, long enough to call your\r\nattention to; there is a page of description of a very curious breed of\r\noxen in Banda Oriental. I should like you to read the few last pages;\r\nthere is a little discussion on extinction, which will not perhaps\r\nstrike you as new, though it has so struck me, and has placed in my mind\r\nall the difficulties with respect to the causes of extinction, in the\r\nsame class with other difficulties which are generally quite overlooked\r\nand undervalued by naturalists; I ought, however, to have made my\r\ndiscussion longer and shewn by facts, as I easily could, how steadily\r\nevery species must be checked in its numbers.\r\n\r\nI received your Travels ('Travels in North America,' 2 volumes, 1845.)\r\nyesterday; and I like exceedingly its external and internal appearance;\r\nI read only about a dozen pages last night (for I was tired with\r\nhay-making), but I saw quite enough to perceive how VERY much it will\r\ninterest me, and how many passages will be scored. I am pleased to find\r\na good sprinkling of Natural History; I shall be astonished if it does\r\nnot sell very largely...\r\n\r\nHow sorry I am to think that we shall not see you here again for so\r\nlong; I wish you may knock yourself a little bit up before you start and\r\nrequire a day's fresh air, before the ocean breezes blow on you...\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, Saturday [August 1st, 1845].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI have been wishing to write to you for a week past, but every five\r\nminutes' worth of strength has been expended in getting out my second\r\npart. (Of the second edition of the 'Journal of Researches.') Your note\r\npleased me a good deal more I dare say than my dedication did you, and I\r\nthank you much for it. Your work has interested me much, and I will give\r\nyou my impressions, though, as I never thought you would care to hear\r\nwhat I thought of the non-scientific parts, I made no notes, nor took\r\npains to remember any particular impression of two-thirds of the first\r\nvolume. The first impression I should say would be with most (though I\r\nhave literally seen not one soul since reading it) regret at there not\r\nbeing more of the non-scientific [parts]. I am not a good judge, for\r\nI have read nothing, i.e. non-scientific about North America, but the\r\nwhole struck me as very new, fresh, and interesting. Your discussions\r\nbore to my mind the evident stamp of matured thought, and of conclusions\r\ndrawn from facts observed by yourself, and not from the opinions of the\r\npeople whom you met; and this I suspect is comparatively rare.\r\n\r\nYour slave discussion disturbed me much; but as you would care no more\r\nfor my opinion on this head than for the ashes of this letter, I will\r\nsay nothing except that it gave me some sleepless, most uncomfortable\r\nhours. Your account of the religious state of the States particularly\r\ninterested me; I am surprised throughout at your very proper boldness\r\nagainst the Clergy. In your University chapter the Clergy, and not the\r\nState of Education, are most severely and justly handled, and this I\r\nthink is very bold, for I conceive you might crush a leaden-headed old\r\nDon, as a Don, with more safety, than touch the finger of that Corporate\r\nAnimal, the Clergy. What a contrast in Education does England show\r\nitself! Your apology (using the term, like the old religionists who\r\nmeant anything but an apology) for lectures, struck me as very clever;\r\nbut all the arguments in the world on your side, are not equal to one\r\ncourse of Jamieson's Lectures on the other side, which I formerly for\r\nmy sins experienced. Although I had read about the 'Coalfields in North\r\nAmerica,' I never in the smallest degree really comprehended their area,\r\ntheir thickness and favourable position; nothing hardly astounded me\r\nmore in your book.\r\n\r\nSome few parts struck me as rather heterogeneous, but I do not know\r\nwhether to an extent that at all signified. I missed however, a good\r\ndeal, some general heading to the chapters, such as the two or three\r\nprincipal places visited. One has no right to expect an author to write\r\ndown to the zero of geographical ignorance of the reader; but I not\r\nknowing a single place, was occasionally rather plagued in tracing your\r\ncourse. Sometimes in the beginning of a chapter, in one paragraph your\r\ncourse was traced through a half dozen places; anyone, as ignorant as\r\nmyself, if he could be found, would prefer such a disturbing paragraph\r\nleft out. I cut your map loose, and I found that a great comfort; I\r\ncould not follow your engraved track. I think in a second edition,\r\ninterspaces here and there of one line open, would be an improvement. By\r\nthe way, I take credit to myself in giving my Journal a less scientific\r\nair in having printed all names of species and genera in Romans;\r\nthe printing looks, also, better. All the illustrations strike me\r\nas capital, and the map is an admirable volume in itself. If your\r\n'Principles' had not met with such universal admiration, I should have\r\nfeared there would have been too much geology in this for the general\r\nreader; certainly all that the most clear and light style could do,\r\nhas been done. To myself the geology was an excellent, well-condensed,\r\nwell-digested resume of all that has been made out in North America,\r\nand every geologist ought to be grateful to you. The summing up of the\r\nNiagara chapter appeared to me the grandest part; I was also deeply\r\ninterested by your discussion on the origin of the Silurian formations.\r\nI have made scores of SCORES marking passages hereafter useful to me.\r\n\r\nAll the coal theory appeared to me very good; but it is no use going on\r\nenumerating in this manner. I wish there had been more Natural History;\r\nI liked ALL the scattered fragments. I have now given you an exact\r\ntranscript of my thoughts, but they are hardly worth your reading...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, August 25th [1845].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nThis is literally the first day on which I have had any time to spare;\r\nand I will amuse myself by beginning a letter to you...\r\n\r\nI was delighted with your letter in which you touch on Slavery; I wish\r\nthe same feelings had been apparent in your published discussion. But\r\nI will not write on this subject, I should perhaps annoy you, and most\r\ncertainly myself. I have exhaled myself with a paragraph or two in my\r\nJournal on the sin of Brazilian slavery; you perhaps will think that\r\nit is in answer to you; but such is not the case. I have remarked on\r\nnothing which I did not hear on the coast of South America. My few\r\nsentences, however, are merely an explosion of feeling. How could you\r\nrelate so placidly that atrocious sentiment (In the passage referred\r\nto, Lyell does not give his own views, but those of a planter.) about\r\nseparating children from their parents; and in the next page speak of\r\nbeing distressed at the whites not having prospered; I assure you the\r\ncontrast made me exclaim out. But I have broken my intention, and so no\r\nmore on this odious deadly subject.\r\n\r\nThere is a favourable, but not strong enough review on you, in the\r\n\"Gardeners' Chronicle\". I am sorry to see that Lindley abides by the\r\ncarbonic acid gas theory. By the way, I was much pleased by Lindley\r\npicking out my extinction paragraphs and giving them uncurtailed. To\r\nmy mind, putting the comparative rarity of existing species in the same\r\ncategory with extinction has removed a great weight; though of course\r\nit does not explain anything, it shows that until we can explain\r\ncomparative rarity, we ought not to feel any surprise at not explaining\r\nextinction...\r\n\r\nI am much pleased to hear of the call for a new edition of the\r\n'Principles': what glorious good that work has done. I fear this time\r\nyou will not be amongst the old rocks; how I shall rejoice to live to\r\nsee you publish and discover another stage below the Silurian--it would\r\nbe the grandest step possible, I think. I am very glad to hear what\r\nprogress Bunbury is making in fossil Botany; there is a fine hiatus\r\nfor him to fill up in this country. I will certainly call on him this\r\nwinter...From what little I saw of him, I can quite believe everything\r\nwhich you say of his talents...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Shrewsbury [1845?].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have just received your note, which has astonished me, and has most\r\ntruly grieved me. I never for one minute doubted of your success, for I\r\nmost erroneously imagined, that merit was sure to gain the day. I feel\r\nmost sure that the day will come soon, when those who have voted against\r\nyou, if they have any shame or conscience in them, will be ashamed at\r\nhaving allowed politics to blind their eyes to your qualifications,\r\nand those qualifications vouched for by Humboldt and Brown! Well, those\r\ntestimonials must be a consolation to you. Proh pudor! I am vexed and\r\nindignant by turns. I cannot even take comfort in thinking that I shall\r\nsee more of you, and extract more knowledge from your well-arranged\r\nstock. I am pleased to think, that after having read a few of your\r\nletters, I never once doubted the position you will ultimately hold\r\namongst European Botanists. I can think about nothing else, otherwise\r\nI should like [to] discuss 'Cosmos' (A translation of Humboldt's\r\n'Kosmos.') with you. I trust you will pay me and my wife a visit this\r\nautumn at Down. I shall be at Down on the 24th, and till then moving\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker, allow me to call myself Your very true friend, C.\r\nDARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. October 8th [1845], Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n...I have lately been taking a little tour to see a farm I have\r\npurchased in Lincolnshire (He speaks of his Lincolnshire farm in a\r\nletter to Henslow (July 4th):--\"I have bought a farm in Lincolnshire,\r\nand when I go there this autumn, I mean to see what I can do in\r\nproviding any cottage on my small estate with gardens. It is a hopeless\r\nthing to look to, but I believe few things would do this country more\r\ngood in future ages than the destruction of primogeniture, so as to\r\nlessen the difference in land-wealth, and make more small freeholders.\r\nHow atrociously unjust are the stamp laws, which render it so expensive\r\nfor the poor man to buy his quarter of an acre; it makes one's blood\r\nburn with indignation.\") and then to York, where I visited the Dean of\r\nManchester (Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert. The visit is mentioned in a letter\r\nto Dr. Hooker:--\"I have been taking a little tour, partly on business,\r\nand visited the Dean of Manchester, and had very much interesting talk\r\nwith him on hybrids, sterility, and variation, etc., etc. He is full of\r\nself-gained knowledge, but knows surprisingly little what others have\r\ndone on the same subjects. He is very heterodox on 'species': not much\r\nbetter as most naturalists would esteem it, than poor Mr. Vestiges.\")\r\nthe great maker of Hybrids, who gave me much curious information. I also\r\nvisited Waterton at Walton Hall, and was extremely amused with my visit\r\nthere. He is an amusing strange fellow; at our early dinner, our party\r\nconsisted of two Catholic priests and two Mulattresses! He is past\r\nsixty years old, and the day before ran down and caught a leveret in\r\na turnip-field. It is a fine old house, and the lake swarms with\r\nwater-fowl. I then saw Chatsworth, and was in transport with the great\r\nhothouse; it is a perfect fragment of a tropical forest, and the sight\r\nmade me think with delight of old recollections. My little ten-day tour\r\nmade me feel wonderfully strong at the time, but the good effects did\r\nnot last. My wife, I am sorry to say, does not get very strong, and the\r\nchildren are the hope of the family, for they are all happy, life, and\r\nspirits. I have been much interested with Sedgwick's review (Sedgwick's\r\nreview of the 'Vestiges of Creation' in the 'Edinburgh Review,' July,\r\n1845.) though I find it far from popular with our scientific readers.\r\nI think some few passages savour of the dogmatism of the pulpit, rather\r\nthan of the philosophy of the Professor's Chair; and some of the wit\r\nstrikes me as only worthy of -- in the 'Quarterly.' Nevertheless, it is\r\na grand piece of argument against mutability of species, and I read it\r\nwith fear and trembling, but was well pleased to find that I had not\r\noverlooked any of the arguments, though I had put them to myself as\r\nfeebly as milk and water. Have you read 'Cosmos' yet? The English\r\ntranslation is wretched, and the semi-metaphysico-politico descriptions\r\nin the first part are barely intelligible; but I think the volcanic\r\ndiscussion well worth your attention, it has astonished me by its vigour\r\nand information. I grieve to find Humboldt an adorer of Von Buch, with\r\nhis classification of volcanos, craters of elevation, etc., etc., and\r\ncarbonic acid gas atmosphere. He is indeed a wonderful man.\r\n\r\nI hope to get home in a fortnight and stick to my wearyful South America\r\ntill I finish it. I shall be very anxious to hear how you get on from\r\nthe Horners, but you must not think of wasting your time by writing to\r\nme. We shall miss, indeed, your visits to Down, and I shall feel a lost\r\nman in London without my morning \"house of call\" at Hart Street...\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Lyell, ever yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Farnborough, Kent. Thursday,\r\nSeptember, 1846.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI hope this letter will catch you at Clifton, but I have been prevented\r\nwriting by being unwell, and having had the Horners here as visitors,\r\nwhich, with my abominable press-work, has fully occupied my time. It is,\r\nindeed, a long time since we wrote to each other; though, I beg to tell\r\nyou, that I wrote last, but what about I cannot remember, except,\r\nI know, it was after reading your last numbers (Sir J.D. Hooker's\r\nAntarctic Botany.), and I send you a uniquely laudatory epistle,\r\nconsidering it was from a man who hardly knows a Daisy from a Dandelion\r\nto a professed Botanist...\r\n\r\nI cannot remember what papers have given me the impression, but I have\r\nthat, which you state to be the case, firmly fixed on my mind, namely,\r\nthe little chemical importance of the soil to its vegetation. What a\r\nstrong fact it is, as R. Brown once remarked to me, of certain plants\r\nbeing calcareous ones here, which are not so under a more favourable\r\nclimate on the Continent, or the reverse, for I forget which; but you,\r\nno doubt, will know to what I refer. By-the-way, there are some such\r\ncases in Herbert's paper in the 'Horticultural Journal.' ('Journal of\r\nthe Horticultural Society,' 1846.) Have you read it: it struck me as\r\nextremely original, and bears DIRECTLY on your present researches. (Sir\r\nJ.D. Hooker was at this time attending to polymorphism, variability,\r\netc.) To a NON-BOTANIST the chalk has the most peculiar aspect of any\r\nflora in England; why will you not come here to make your observations?\r\nWE go to Southampton, if my courage and stomach do not fail, for the\r\nBrit. Assoc. (Do you not consider it your duty to be there?) And why\r\ncannot you come here afterward and WORK?...\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MONOGRAPH OF THE CIRRIPEDIA,\r\n\r\nOctober 1846 to October 1854.\r\n\r\n[Writing to Sir J.D. Hooker in 1845, my father says: \"I hope this next\r\nsummer to finish my South American Geology, then to get out a little\r\nZoology, and hurrah for my species work...\" This passage serves to show\r\nthat he had at this time no intention of making an exhaustive study of\r\nthe Cirripedes. Indeed it would seem that his original intention was,\r\nas I learn from Sir J.D. Hooker, merely to work out one special\r\nproblem. This is quite in keeping with the following passage in the\r\nAutobiography: \"When on the coast of Chile, I found a most curious form,\r\nwhich burrowed into the shells of Concholepas, and which differed so\r\nmuch from all other Cirripedes that I had to form a new sub-order for\r\nits sole reception...To understand the structure of my new Cirripede I\r\nhad to examine and dissect many of the common forms; and this gradually\r\nled me on to take up the whole group.\" In later years he seems to have\r\nfelt some doubt as to the value of these eight years of work,--for\r\ninstance when he wrote in his Autobiography--\"My work was of\r\nconsiderable use to me, when I had to discuss in the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies,' the principles of a natural classification. Nevertheless I\r\ndoubt whether the work was worth the consumption of so much time.\" Yet I\r\nlearn from Sir J.D. Hooker that he certainly recognised at the time its\r\nvalue to himself as systematic training. Sir Joseph writes to me: \"Your\r\nfather recognised three stages in his career as a biologist: the mere\r\ncollector at Cambridge; the collector and observer in the \"Beagle\", and\r\nfor some years afterwards; and the trained naturalist after, and only\r\nafter the Cirripede work. That he was a thinker all along is true\r\nenough, and there is a vast deal in his writings previous to the\r\nCirripedes that a trained naturalist could but emulate...He often\r\nalluded to it as a valued discipline, and added that even the 'hateful'\r\nwork of digging out synonyms, and of describing, not only improved his\r\nmethods but opened his eyes to the difficulties and merits of the works\r\nof the dullest of cataloguers. One result was that he would never allow\r\na depreciatory remark to pass unchallenged on the poorest class of\r\nscientific workers, provided that their work was honest, and good of\r\nits kind. I have always regarded it as one of the finest traits of his\r\ncharacter,--this generous appreciation of the hod-men of science, and\r\nof their labours...and it was monographing the Barnacles that brought it\r\nabout.\"]\r\n\r\nProfessor Huxley allows me to quote his opinion as to the value of the\r\neight years given to the Cirripedes:--\r\n\r\n\"In my opinion your sagacious father never did a wiser thing than when\r\nhe devoted himself to the years of patient toil which the Cirripede-book\r\ncost him.\r\n\r\n\"Like the rest of us, he had no proper training in biological science,\r\nand it has always struck me as a remarkable instance of his scientific\r\ninsight, that he saw the necessity of giving himself such training, and\r\nof his courage, that he did not shirk the labour of obtaining it.\r\n\r\n\"The great danger which besets all men of large speculative faculty, is\r\nthe temptation to deal with the accepted statements of facts in natural\r\nscience, as if they were not only correct, but exhaustive; as if they\r\nmight be dealt with deductively, in the same way as propositions in\r\nEuclid may be dealt with. In reality, every such statement, however true\r\nit may be, is true only relatively to the means of observation and the\r\npoint of view of those who have enunciated it. So far it may be depended\r\nupon. But whether it will bear every speculative conclusion that may be\r\nlogically deduced from it, is quite another question.\r\n\r\n\"Your father was building a vast superstructure upon the foundations\r\nfurnished by the recognised facts of geological and biological science.\r\nIn Physical Geography, in Geology proper, in Geographical Distribution,\r\nand in Palaeontology, he had acquired an extensive practical training\r\nduring the voyage of the \"Beagle\". He knew of his own knowledge the way\r\nin which the raw materials of these branches of science are acquired,\r\nand was therefore a most competent judge of the speculative strain they\r\nwould bear. That which he needed, after his return to England, was\r\na corresponding acquaintance with Anatomy and Development, and their\r\nrelation to Taxonomy--and he acquired this by his Cirripede work.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, in my apprehension, the value of the Cirripede monograph lies\r\nnot merely in the fact that it is a very admirable piece of work, and\r\nconstituted a great addition to positive knowledge, but still more in\r\nthe circumstance that it was a piece of critical self-discipline,\r\nthe effect of which manifested itself in everything your father wrote\r\nafterwards, and saved him from endless errors of detail.\r\n\r\n\"So far from such work being a loss of time, I believe it would have\r\nbeen well worth his while, had it been practicable, to have supplemented\r\nit by a special study of embryology and physiology. His hands would\r\nhave been greatly strengthened thereby when he came to write out sundry\r\nchapters of the 'Origin of Species.' But of course in those days it was\r\nalmost impossible for him to find facilities for such work.\"\r\n\r\nNo one can look a the two volumes on the recent Cirripedes, of 399\r\nand 684 pages respectively (not to speak of the volumes on the fossil\r\nspecies), without being struck by the immense amount of detailed work\r\nwhich they contain. The forty plates, some of them with thirty figures,\r\nand the fourteen pages of index in the two volumes together, give some\r\nrough idea of the labour spent on the work. (The reader unacquainted\r\nwith Zoology will find some account of the more interesting results in\r\nMr. Romanes' article on \"Charles Darwin\" ('Nature' Series, 1882).) The\r\nstate of knowledge, as regards the Cirripedes, was most unsatisfactory\r\nat the time that my father began to work at them. As an illustration\r\nof this fact, it may be mentioned that he had even to re-organise the\r\nnomenclature of the group, or, as he expressed it, he \"unwillingly found\r\nit indispensable to give names to several valves, and to some few of\r\nthe softer parts of Cirripedes.\" (Vol. i. page 3.) It is interesting\r\nto learn from his diary the amount of time which he gave to different\r\ngenera. Thus the genus Chthamalus, the description of which occupies\r\ntwenty-two pages, occupied him for thirty-six days; Coronula took\r\nnineteen days, and is described in twenty-seven pages. Writing to\r\nFitz-Roy, he speaks of being \"for the last half-month daily hard at work\r\nin dissecting a little animal about the size of a pin's head, from the\r\nChonos archipelago, and I could spend another month, and daily see more\r\nbeautiful structure.\"\r\n\r\nThough he became excessively weary of the work before the end of the\r\neight years, he had much keen enjoyment in the course of it. Thus\r\nhe wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker (1847?):--\"As you say, there is an\r\nextraordinary pleasure in pure observation; not but what I suspect the\r\npleasure in this case is rather derived from comparisons forming in\r\none's mind with allied structures. After having been so long employed\r\nin writing my old geological observations, it is delightful to use one's\r\neyes and fingers again.\" It was, in fact, a return to the work which\r\noccupied so much of his time when at sea during his voyage. His\r\nzoological notes of that period give an impression of vigorous work,\r\nhampered by ignorance and want of appliances. And his untiring industry\r\nin the dissection of marine animals, especially of Crustacea, must have\r\nbeen of value to him as training for his Cirripede work. Most of his\r\nwork was done with the simple dissecting microscope--but it was the need\r\nwhich he found for higher powers that induced him, in 1846, to buy a\r\ncompound microscope. He wrote to Hooker:--\"When I was drawing with L.,\r\nI was so delighted with the appearance of the objects, especially with\r\ntheir perspective, as seen through the weak powers of a good compound\r\nmicroscope, that I am going to order one; indeed, I often have\r\nstructures in which the 1/30 is not power enough.\"\r\n\r\nDuring part of the time covered by the present chapter, my father\r\nsuffered perhaps more from ill-health than at any other time of his\r\nlife. He felt severely the depressing influence of these long years of\r\nillness; thus as early as 1840 he wrote to Fox: \"I am grown a dull,\r\nold, spiritless dog to what I used to be. One gets stupider as one grows\r\nolder I think.\" It is not wonderful that he should so have written,\r\nit is rather to be wondered at that his spirit withstood so great and\r\nconstant a strain. He wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker in 1845: \"You are very\r\nkind in your enquiries about my health; I have nothing to say about it,\r\nbeing always much the same, some days better and some worse. I believe\r\nI have not had one whole day, or rather night, without my stomach having\r\nbeen greatly disordered, during the last three years, and most days\r\ngreat prostration of strength: thank you for your kindness; many of my\r\nfriends, I believe, think me a hypochondriac.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1849, he notes in his diary:--\"January 1st to March\r\n10th.--Health very bad, with much sickness and failure of power. Worked\r\non all well days.\" This was written just before his first visit to Dr.\r\nGully's Water-Cure Establishment at Malvern. In April of the same year\r\nhe wrote:--\"I believe I am going on very well, but I am rather weary of\r\nmy present inactive life, and the water-cure has the most extraordinary\r\neffect in producing indolence and stagnation of mind: till experiencing\r\nit, I could not have believed it possible. I now increase in weight,\r\nhave escaped sickness for thirty days.\" He returned in June, after\r\nsixteen weeks' absence, much improved in health, and, as already\r\ndescribed, continued the water-cure at home for some time.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [October, 1846].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have not heard from Sulivan (Admiral Sir B.J. Sulivan, formerly an\r\nofficer of the \"Beagle\".) lately; when he last wrote he named from 8th\r\nto 10th as the most likely time. Immediately that I hear, I will fly you\r\na line, for the chance of your being able to come. I forget whether you\r\nknow him, but I suppose so; he is a real good fellow. Anyhow, if you do\r\nnot come then, I am very glad that you propose coming soon after...\r\n\r\nI am going to begin some papers on the lower marine animals, which will\r\nlast me some months, perhaps a year, and then I shall begin looking over\r\nmy ten-year-long accumulation of notes on species and varieties,\r\nwhich, with writing, I dare say will take me five years, and then, when\r\npublished, I dare say I shall stand infinitely low in the opinion of all\r\nsound Naturalists--so this is my prospect for the future.\r\n\r\nAre you a good hand at inventing names. I have a quite new and curious\r\ngenus of Barnacle, which I want to name, and how to invent a name\r\ncompletely puzzles me.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I have told you nothing about Southampton. We enjoyed (wife\r\nand myself) our week beyond measure: the papers were all dull, but I met\r\nso many friends and made so many new acquaintances (especially some of\r\nthe Irish Naturalists), and took so many pleasant excursions. I wish you\r\nhad been there. On Sunday we had so pleasant an excursion to\r\nWinchester with Falconer (Hugh Falconer, 1809-1865. Chiefly known as a\r\npalaeontologist, although employed as a botanist during his whole career\r\nin India, where he was also a medical officer in the H.E.I.C. Service;\r\nhe was superintendent of the Company's garden, first at Saharunpore,\r\nand then at Calcutta. He was one of the first botanical explorers of\r\nKashmir. Falconer's discoveries of Miocene mammalian remains in the\r\nSewalik Hills, were, at the time, perhaps the greatest \"finds\" which had\r\nbeen made. His book on the subject, 'Fauna Antiqua Sivalensis,' remained\r\nunfinished at the time of his death.), Colonel Sabine (The late Sir\r\nEdward Sabine, formerly President of the Royal Society, and author of a\r\nlong series of memoirs on Terrestrial Magnetism.), and Dr. Robinson\r\n(The late Dr. Thomas Romney Robinson, of the Armagh Observatory.), and\r\nothers. I never enjoyed a day more in my life. I missed having a look\r\nat H. Watson. (The late Hewett Cottrell Watson, author of the 'Cybele\r\nBritannica,' one of a most valuable series of works on the topography\r\nand geographical distribution of the plants of the British Islands.)\r\nI suppose you heard that he met Forbes and told him he had a severe\r\narticle in the Press. I understood that Forbes explained to him that he\r\nhad no cause to complain, but as the article was printed, he would not\r\nwithdraw it, but offered it to Forbes for him to append notes to it,\r\nwhich Forbes naturally declined...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 7th [1847?].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI should have written before now, had I not been almost continually\r\nunwell, and at present I am suffering from four boils and swellings, one\r\nof which hardly allows me the use of my right arm, and has stopped all\r\nmy work, and damped all my spirits. I was much disappointed at missing\r\nmy trip to Kew, and the more so, as I had forgotten you would be away\r\nall this month; but I had no choice, and was in bed nearly all Friday\r\nand Saturday. I congratulate you over your improved prospects about\r\nIndia (Sir J. Hooker left England on November 11, 1847, for his\r\nHimalayan and Tibetan journey. The expedition was supported by a small\r\ngrant from the Treasury, and thus assumed the character of a Government\r\nmission.), but at the same time must sincerely groan over it. I shall\r\nfeel quite lost without you to discuss many points with, and to\r\npoint out (ill-luck to you) difficulties and objections to my species\r\nhypotheses. It will be a horrid shame if money stops your expedition;\r\nbut Government will surely help you to some extent...Your present trip,\r\nwith your new views, amongst the coal-plants, will be very interesting.\r\nIf you have spare time, BUT NOT WITHOUT, I should enjoy having some news\r\nof your progress. Your present trip will work well in, if you go to\r\nany of the coal districts in India. Would this not be a good object to\r\nparade before Government; the utilitarian souls would comprehend this.\r\nBy the way, I will get some work out of you, about the domestic races of\r\nanimals in India...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO L. JENYNS (BLOMEFIELD). Down [1847].\r\n\r\nDear Jenyns,\r\n\r\n(\"This letter relates to a small Almanack first published in 1843, under\r\nthe name of 'The Naturalists' Pocket Almanack,' by Mr. Van Voorst,\r\nand which I edited for him. It was intended especially for those who\r\ninterest themselves in the periodic phenomena of animals and plants, of\r\nwhich a select list was given under each month of the year.\r\n\r\n\"The Pocket Almanack contained, moreover, miscellaneous information\r\nrelating to Zoology and Botany; to Natural History and other scientific\r\nsocieties; to public Museums and Gardens, in addition to the ordinary\r\ncelestial phenomena found in most other Almanacks. It continued to be\r\nissued till 1847, after which year the publication was abandoned.\"--From\r\na letter from Rev. L. Blomefield to F. Darwin.)\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for the capital little Almanack; it so happened\r\nthat I was wishing for one to keep in my portfolio. I had never seen\r\nthis kind before, and shall certainly get one for the future. I think\r\nit is very amusing to have a list before one's eyes of the order of\r\nappearance of the plants and animals around one; it gives a fresh\r\ninterest to each fine day. There is one point I should like to see\r\na little improved, viz., the correction for the clock at shorter\r\nintervals. Most people, I suspect, who like myself have dials, will wish\r\nto be more precise than with a margin of three minutes. I always buy\r\na shilling almanack for this SOLE end. By the way, YOURS, i.e., Van\r\nVoorst's Almanack, is very dear; it ought, at least, to be advertised\r\npost-free for the shilling. Do you not think a table (not rules) of\r\nconversion of French into English measures, and perhaps weights, would\r\nbe exceedingly useful; also centigrade into Fahrenheit,--magnifying\r\npowers according to focal distances?--in fact you might make it the more\r\nuseful publication of the age. I know what I should like best of all,\r\nnamely, current meteorological remarks for each month, with statement\r\nof average course of winds and prediction of weather, in accordance with\r\nmovements of barometer. People, I think, are always amused at knowing\r\nthe extremes and means of temperature for corresponding times in other\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nI hope you will go on with it another year. With many thanks, my dear\r\nJenyns,\r\n\r\nYours very truly, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Sunday [April 18th, 1847].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI return with many thanks Watson's letter, which I have had copied. It\r\nis a capital one, and I am extremely obliged to you for obtaining me\r\nsuch valuable information. Surely he is rather in a hurry when he says\r\nintermediate varieties must almost be necessarily rare, otherwise they\r\nwould be taken as the types of the species; for he overlooks numerical\r\nfrequency as an element. Surely if A, B, C were three varieties, and\r\nif A were a good deal the commonest (therefore, also, first known),\r\nit would be taken as the type, without regarding whether B was quite\r\nintermediate or not, or whether it was rare or not. What capital\r\nessays W would write; but I suppose he has written a good deal in the\r\n'Phytologist.' You ought to encourage him to publish on variation; it\r\nis a shame that such facts as those in his letter should remain\r\nunpublished. I must get you to introduce me to him; would he be a good\r\nand sociable man for Dropmore? (A much enjoyed expedition made from\r\nOxford--when the British Association met there in 1847.) though if he\r\ncomes, Forbes must not (and I think you talked of inviting Forbes), or\r\nwe shall have a glorious battle. I should like to see sometime the war\r\ncorrespondence. Have you the 'Phytologist,' and could you sometime spare\r\nit? I would go through it quickly...I have read your last five numbers\r\n(Of the Botany of Hooker's 'Antarctic Voyage.'), and as usual have been\r\nmuch interested in several points, especially with your discussions\r\non the beech and potato. I see you have introduced several sentences\r\nagainst us Transmutationists. I have also been looking through the\r\nlatter volumes of the 'Annals of Natural History,' and have read two\r\nsuch soulless, pompous papers of --, quite worthy of the author...The\r\ncontrast of the papers in the \"Annals\" with those in the \"Annales\"\r\nis rather humiliating; so many papers in the former, with short\r\ndescriptions of species, without one word on their affinities, internal\r\nstructure, range or habits. I am now reading --, and I have picked\r\nout some things which have interested me; but he strikes me as rather\r\ndullish, and with all his Materia Medica smells of the doctor's shop. I\r\nshall ever hate the name of the Materia Medica, since hearing Duncan's\r\nlectures at eight o'clock on a winter's morning--a whole, cold\r\nbreakfastless hour on the properties of rhubarb!\r\n\r\nI hope your journey will be very prosperous. Believe me, my dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I think I have only made one new acquaintance of late, that is\r\nR. Chambers; and I have just received a presentation copy of the sixth\r\nedition of the 'Vestiges.' Somehow I now feel perfectly convinced he is\r\nthe author. He is in France, and has written to me thence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1847?].\r\n\r\n...I am delighted to hear that Brongniart thought Sigillaria aquatic,\r\nand that Binney considers coal a sort of submarine peat. I would bet\r\n5 to 1 that in twenty years this will be generally admitted (An\r\nunfulfilled prophecy.); and I do not care for whatever the botanical\r\ndifficulties or impossibilities may be. If I could but persuade myself\r\nthat Sigillaria and Co. had a good range of depth, i.e., could live from\r\n5 to 100 fathoms under water, all difficulties of nearly all kinds would\r\nbe removed (for the simple fact of muddy ordinary shallow sea implies\r\nproximity of land). [N.B.--I am chuckling to think how you are sneering\r\nall this time.] It is not much of a difficulty, there not being shells\r\nwith the coal, considering how unfavourable deep mud is for most\r\nMollusca, and that shells would probably decay from the humic acid, as\r\nseems to take place in peat and in the BLACK moulds (as Lyell tells me)\r\nof the Mississippi. So coal question settled--Q.E.D. Sneer away!\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your welcome note from Cambridge, and I am glad you like\r\nmy alma mater, which I despise heartily as a place of education, but\r\nlove from many most pleasant recollections...\r\n\r\nThanks for your offer of the 'Phytologist;' I shall be very much obliged\r\nfor it, for I do not suppose I should be able to borrow it from any\r\nother quarter. I will not be set up too much by your praise, but I do\r\nnot believe I ever lost a book or forgot to return it during a long\r\nlapse of time. Your 'Webb' is well wrapped up, and with your name in\r\nlarge letters OUTSIDE.\r\n\r\nMy new microscope is come home (a \"splendid plaything,\" as old R.\r\nBrown called it), and I am delighted with it; it really is a splendid\r\nplaything. I have been in London for three days, and saw many of our\r\nfriends. I was extremely sorry to hear a not very good account of\r\nSir William. Farewell, my dear Hooker, and be a good boy, and make\r\nSigillaria a submarine sea-weed.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [May 6th, 1847].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYou have made a savage onslaught, and I must try to defend myself.\r\nBut, first, let me say that I never write to you except for my own\r\ngood pleasure; now I fear that you answer me when busy and without\r\ninclination (and I am sure I should have none if I was as busy as you).\r\nPray do not do so, and if I thought my writing entailed an answer from\r\nyou nolens volens, it would destroy all my pleasure in writing. Firstly,\r\nI did not consider my letter as REASONING, or even as SPECULATION, but\r\nsimply as mental rioting; and as I was sending Binney's paper, I poured\r\nout to you the result of reading it. Secondly, you are right, indeed, in\r\nthinking me mad, if you suppose that I would class any ferns as marine\r\nplants; but surely there is a wide distinction between the plants found\r\nupright in the coal-beds and those not upright, and which might have\r\nbeen drifted. Is it not possible that the same circumstances which have\r\npreserved the vegetation in situ, should have preserved drifted plants?\r\nI know Calamites is found upright; but I fancied its affinities were\r\nvery obscure, like Sigillaria. As for Lepidodendron, I forgot its\r\nexistence, as happens when one goes riot, and now know neither what\r\nit is, or whether upright. If these plants, i.e. Calamites and\r\nLepidodendron, have VERY CLEAR RELATIONS to terrestrial vegetables, like\r\nthe ferns have, and are found upright in situ, of course I must give up\r\nthe ghost. But surely Sigillaria is the main upright plant, and on its\r\nobscure affinities I have heard you enlarge.\r\n\r\nThirdly, it never entered my head to undervalue botanical relatively to\r\nzoological evidence; except in so far as I thought it was admitted that\r\nthe vegetative structure seldom yielded any evidence of affinity nearer\r\nthan that of families, and not always so much. And is it not in plants,\r\nas certainly it is in animals, dangerous to judge of habits without\r\nvery near affinity. Could a Botanist tell from structure alone that the\r\nMangrove family, almost or quite alone in Dicotyledons, could live in\r\nthe sea, and the Zostera family almost alone among the Monocotyledons?\r\nIs it a safe argument, that because algae are almost the only, or the\r\nonly submerged sea-plants, that formerly other groups had not members\r\nwith such habits? With animals such an argument would not be conclusive,\r\nas I could illustrate by many examples; but I am forgetting myself; I\r\nwant only to some degree to defend myself, and not burn my fingers by\r\nattacking you. The foundation of my letter, and what is my deliberate\r\nopinion, though I dare say you will think it absurd, is that I would\r\nrather trust, caeteris paribus, pure geological evidence than either\r\nzoological or botanical evidence. I do not say that I would sooner trust\r\nPOOR geological evidence than GOOD organic. I think the basis of pure\r\ngeological reasoning is simpler (consisting chiefly of the action of\r\nwater on the crust of the earth, and its up and down movements) than a\r\nbasis drawn from the difficult subject of affinities and of structure in\r\nrelation to habits. I can hardly analyze the facts on which I have come\r\nto this conclusion; but I can illustrate it. Pallas's account would lead\r\nany one to suppose that the Siberian strata, with the frozen carcasses,\r\nhad been quickly deposited, and hence that the embedded animals had\r\nlived in the neighbourhood; but our zoological knowledge of thirty years\r\nago led every one falsely to reject this conclusion.\r\n\r\nTell me that an upright fern in situ occurs with Sigillaria and\r\nStigmaria, or that the affinities of Calamites and Lepidodendron\r\n(supposing that they are found in situ with Sigillaria) are so CLEAR,\r\nthat they could not have been marine, like, but in a greater degree,\r\nthan the mangrove and sea-wrack, and I will humbly apologise to you\r\nand all Botanists for having let my mind run riot on a subject on which\r\nassuredly I know nothing. But till I hear this, I shall keep privately\r\nto my own opinion with the same pertinacity and, as you will think,\r\nwith the same philosophical spirit with which Koenig maintains that\r\nCheirotherium-footsteps are fuci.\r\n\r\nWhether this letter will sink me lower in your opinion, or put me a\r\nlittle right, I know not, but hope the latter. Anyhow, I have revenged\r\nmyself with boring you with a very long epistle. Farewell, and be\r\nforgiving. Ever yours,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--When will you return to Kew? I have forgotten one main object of\r\nmy letter, to thank you MUCH for your offer of the 'Hort. Journal,' but\r\nI have ordered the two numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The two following extracts [1847] give the continuation and conclusion\r\nof the coal battle.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, as submarine coal made you so wrath, I thought I would\r\nexperimentise on Falconer and Bunbury (The late Sir C. Bunbury,\r\nwell-known as a palaeobotanist.) together, and it made [them] even more\r\nsavage; 'such infernal nonsense ought to be thrashed out of me.' Bunbury\r\nwas more polite and contemptuous. So I now know how to stir up and show\r\noff any Botanist. I wonder whether Zoologists and Geologists have got\r\ntheir tender points; I wish I could find out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot resist thanking you for your most kind note. Pray do not\r\nthink that I was annoyed by your letter: I perceived that you had been\r\nthinking with animation, and accordingly expressed yourself strongly,\r\nand so I understood it. Forfend me from a man who weighs every\r\nexpression with Scotch prudence. I heartily wish you all success in your\r\nnoble problem, and I shall be very curious to have some talk with you\r\nand hear your ultimatum.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. (Parts of two letters.) Down [October,\r\n1847].\r\n\r\nI congratulate you heartily on your arrangements being completed, with\r\nsome prospect for the future. It will be a noble voyage and journey,\r\nbut I wish it was over, I shall miss you selfishly and all ways to a\r\ndreadful extent ...I am in great perplexity how we are to meet...I can\r\nwell understand how dreadfully busy you must be. If you CANNOT come\r\nhere, you MUST let me come to you for a night; for I must have one more\r\nchat and one more quarrel with you over the coal.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I endeavoured to stir up Lyell (who has been staying\r\nhere some days with me) to theorise on the coal: his oolitic UPRIGHT\r\nEquisetums are dreadful for my submarine flora. I should die much easier\r\nif some one would solve me the coal question. I sometimes think it could\r\nnot have been formed at all. Old Sir Anthony Carlisle once said to me\r\ngravely, that he supposed Megatherium and such cattle were just sent\r\ndown from heaven to see whether the earth would support them; and I\r\nsuppose the coal was rained down to puzzle mortals. You must work the\r\ncoal well in India.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [November 6th, 1847.]\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have just received your note with sincere grief: there is no help for\r\nit. I shall always look at your intention of coming here, under such\r\ncircumstances, as the greatest proof of friendship I ever received from\r\nmortal man. My conscience would have upbraided me in not having come\r\nto you on Thursday, but, as it turned out, I could not, for I was quite\r\nunable to leave Shrewsbury before that day, and I reached home only\r\nlast night, much knocked up. Without I hear to-morrow (which is hardly\r\npossible), and if I am feeling pretty well, I will drive over to Kew on\r\nMonday morning, just to say farewell. I will stay only an hour...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [November, 1847.]\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI am very unwell, and incapable of doing anything. I do hope I have not\r\ninconvenienced you. I was so unwell all yesterday, that I was rejoicing\r\nyou were not here; for it would have been a bitter mortification to me\r\nto have had you here and not enjoyed your last day. I shall not now see\r\nyou. Farewell, and God bless you.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate friend, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI will write to you in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In 1847 appeared a paper by Mr. D. Milne (Now Mr. Milne Home. The\r\nessay was published in Transactions of the Edinburgh Royal Society, vol.\r\nxvi.), in which my father's Glen Roy work is criticised, and which is\r\nreferred to in the following characteristic extract from a letter to Sir\r\nJ. Hooker:] \"I have been bad enough for these few last days, having had\r\nto think and write too much about Glen Roy...Mr. Milne having attacked\r\nmy theory, which made me horribly sick.\" I have not been able to find\r\nany published reply to Mr. Milne, so that I imagine the \"writing\"\r\nmentioned was confined to letters. Mr. Milne's paper was not destructive\r\nto the Glen Roy paper, and this my father recognises in the following\r\nextract from a letter to Lyell (March, 1847). The reference to Chambers\r\nis explained by the fact that he accompanied Mr. Milne in his visit to\r\nGlen Roy. \"I got R. Chambers to give me a sketch of Milne's Glen Roy\r\nviews, and I have re-read my paper, and am, now that I have heard what\r\nis to be said, not even staggered. It is provoking and humiliating to\r\nfind that Chambers not only had not read with any care my paper on\r\nthis subject, or even looked at the coloured map, so that the new shelf\r\ndescribed by me had not been searched for, and my arguments and facts of\r\ndetail not in the least attended to. I entirely gave up the ghost, and\r\nwas quite chicken-hearted at the Geological Society, till you reassured\r\nand reminded me of the main facts in the whole case.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two following letters to Lyell, though of later date (June, 1848),\r\nbear on the same subject:--\r\n\r\n\"I was at the evening meeting [of the Geological Society], but did not\r\nget within hail of you. What a fool (though I must say a very amusing\r\none) -- did make of himself. Your speech was refreshing after it,\r\nand was well characterized by Fox (my cousin) in three words--'What a\r\ncontrast!' That struck me as a capital speculation about the Wealden\r\nContinent going down. I did not hear what you settled at the Council; I\r\nwas quite wearied out and bewildered. I find Smith, of Jordan Hill, has\r\na much worse opinion of R. Chambers's book than even I have. Chambers\r\nhas piqued me a little ('Ancient Sea Margins, 1848.' The words quoted by\r\nmy father should be \"the mobility of the land was an ascendant idea.\");\r\nhe says I 'propound' and 'profess my belief' that Glen Roy is marine,\r\nand that the idea was accepted because the 'mobility of the land was the\r\nascendant idea of the day.' He adds some very faint UPPER lines in Glen\r\nSpean (seen, by the way, by Agassiz), and has shown that Milne and Kemp\r\nare right in there being horizontal aqueous markings (NOT at coincident\r\nlevels with those of Glen Roy) in other parts of Scotland at great\r\nheights, and he adds several other cases. This is the whole of his\r\naddition to the data. He not only takes my line of argument from the\r\nbuttresses and terraces below the lower shelf and some other arguments\r\n(without acknowledgment), but he sneers at all his predecessors\r\nnot having perceived the importance of the short portions of lines\r\nintermediate between the chief ones in Glen Roy; whereas I commence the\r\ndescription of them with saying, that 'perceiving their importance,\r\nI examined them with scrupulous care,' and expatiate at considerable\r\nlength on them. I have indirectly told him I do not think he has quite\r\nclaims to consider that he alone (which he pretty directly asserts) has\r\nsolved the problem of Glen Roy. With respect to the terraces at lower\r\nlevels coincident in height all round Scotland and England, I am\r\ninclined to believe he shows some little probability of there being some\r\nleading ones coincident, but much more exact evidence is required. Would\r\nyou believe it credible? he advances as a probable solution to account\r\nfor the rise of Great Britain that in some great ocean one-twentieth\r\nof the bottom of the whole aqueous surface of the globe has sunk in (he\r\ndoes not say where he puts it) for a thickness of half a mile, and this\r\nhe has calculated would make an apparent rise of 130 feet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down [June, 1848].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nOut of justice to Chambers I must trouble you with one line to say, as\r\nfar as I am personally concerned in Glen Roy, he has made the amende\r\nhonorable, and pleads guilty through inadvertency of taking my two lines\r\nof arguments and facts without acknowledgment. He concluded by saying he\r\n\"came to the same point by an independent course of inquiry, which in a\r\nsmall degree excuses this inadvertency.\" His letter altogether shows a\r\nvery good disposition, and says he is \"much gratified with the MEASURED\r\napprobation which you bestow, etc.\" I am heartily glad I was able to\r\nsay in truth that I thought he had done good service in calling more\r\nattention to the subject of the terraces. He protests it is unfair to\r\ncall the sinking of the sea his theory, for that he with care always\r\nspeaks of mere change of level, and this is quite true; but the one\r\nsection in which he shows how he conceives the sea might sink is so\r\nastonishing, that I believe it will with others, as with me, more than\r\ncounterbalance his previous caution. I hope that you may think better of\r\nthe book than I do.\r\n\r\nYours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. October 6th, 1848.\r\n\r\n...I have lately been trying to get up an agitation (but I shall not\r\nsucceed, and indeed doubt whether I have time and strength to go on with\r\nit), against the practice of Naturalists appending for perpetuity the\r\nname of the FIRST describer to species. I look at this as a direct\r\npremium to hasty work, to NAMING instead of DESCRIBING. A species ought\r\nto have a name so well known that the addition of the author's name\r\nwould be superfluous, and a [piece] of empty vanity. (His contempt for\r\nthe self-regarding spirit in a naturalist is illustrated by an anecdote,\r\nfor which I am indebted to Rev. L. Blomefield. After speaking of my\r\nfather's love of Entomology at Cambridge, Mr. Blomefield continues:--\"He\r\noccasionally came over from Cambridge to my Vicarage at Swaffham\r\nBulbeck, and we went out together to collect insects in the woods at\r\nBottisham Hall, close at hand, or made longer excursions in the Fens.\r\nOn one occasion he captured in a large bag net, with which he used\r\nvigorously to sweep the weeds and long grass, a rare coleopterous\r\ninsect, one of the Lepturidae, which I myself had never taken in\r\nCambridgeshire. He was pleased with his capture, and of course carried\r\nit home in triumph. Some years afterwards, the voyage of the 'Beagle'\r\nhaving been made in the interim, talking over old times with him, I\r\nreverted to this circumstance, and asked if he remembered it. 'Oh, yes,'\r\n(he said,) 'I remember it well; and I was selfish enough to keep\r\nthe specimen, when you were collecting materials for a Fauna of\r\nCambridgeshire, and for a local museum in the Philosophical Society.' He\r\nfollowed this up with some remarks on the pettiness of collectors, who\r\naimed at nothing beyond filling their cabinets with rare things.\")\r\nAt present, it would not do to give mere specific names; but I think\r\nZoologists might open the road to the omission, by referring to good\r\nsystematic writers instead of to first describers. Botany, I fancy,\r\nhas not suffered so much as Zoology from mere NAMING; the characters,\r\nfortunately, are more obscure. Have you ever thought on this point?\r\nWhy should Naturalists append their own names to new species, when\r\nMineralogists and Chemists do not do so to new substances? When you\r\nwrite to Falconer pray remember me affectionately to him. I grieve most\r\nsincerely to hear that he has been ill, my dear Hooker, God bless you,\r\nand fare you well.\r\n\r\nYour sincere friend, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO HUGH STRICKLAND. (Hugh Edwin Strickland, M.A., F.R.S.,\r\nwas born 2nd of March, 1811, and educated at Rugby, under Arnold, and at\r\nOriel College, Oxford. In 1835 and 1836 he travelled through Europe to\r\nthe Levant with W.J. Hamilton, the geologist, wintering in Asia Minor.\r\nIn 1841 he brought the subject of Natural History Nomenclature before\r\nthe British Association, and prepared the Code of Rules for Zoological\r\nNomenclature, now known by his name--the principles of which are very\r\ngenerally adopted. In 1843 he was one of the founders (if not the\r\noriginal projector) of the Ray Society. In 1845 he married the second\r\ndaughter of Sir William Jardine, Bart. In 1850 he was appointed, in\r\nconsequence of Buckland's illness, Deputy Reader in Geology at Oxford.\r\nHis promising career was suddenly cut short on September 14, 1853, when,\r\nwhile geologizing in a railway cutting between Retford and Gainsborough,\r\nhe was run over by a train and instantly killed. A memoir of him and a\r\nreprint of his principal contributions to journals was published by Sir\r\nWilliam Jardine in 1858; but he was also the author of 'The Dodo and its\r\nKindred' (1848); 'Bibliographia Zoologiae' (the latter in conjunction\r\nwith Louis Agassiz, and issued by the Ray Society); 'Ornithological\r\nSynonyms' (one volume only published, and that posthumously). A\r\ncatalogue of his ornithological collection, given by his widow to the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge, was compiled by Mr. Salvin, and published in\r\n1882. (I am indebted to Prof. Newton for the above note.)) Down, January\r\n29th [1849].\r\n\r\n...What a labour you have undertaken; I do HONOUR your devoted zeal in\r\nthe good cause of Natural Science. Do you happen to have a SPARE copy\r\nof the Nomenclature rules published in the 'British Association\r\nTransactions?' if you have, and would give it to me, I should be truly\r\nobliged, for I grudge buying the volume for it. I have found the rules\r\nvery useful, it is quite a comfort to have something to rest on in the\r\nturbulent ocean of nomenclature (and am accordingly grateful to you),\r\nthough I find it very difficult to obey always. Here is a case (and I\r\nthink it should have been noticed in the rules), Coronula, Cineras and\r\nOtion, are names adopted by Cuvier, Lamarck, Owen, and almost EVERY\r\nwell-known writer, but I find that all three names were anticipated by\r\na German: now I believe if I were to follow the strict rule of priority,\r\nmore harm would be done than good, and more especially as I feel sure\r\nthat the newly fished-up names would not be adopted. I have almost made\r\nup my mind to reject the rule of priority in this case; would you grudge\r\nthe trouble to send me your opinion? I have been led of late to reflect\r\nmuch on the subject of naming, and I have come to a fixed opinion that\r\nthe plan of the first describer's name, being appended for perpetuity to\r\na species, had been the greatest curse to Natural History. Some months\r\nsince, I wrote out the enclosed badly drawn-up paper, thinking that\r\nperhaps I would agitate the subject; but the fit has passed, and I do\r\nnot suppose I ever shall; I send it you for the CHANCE of your caring\r\nto see my notions. I have been surprised to find in conversation that\r\nseveral naturalists were of nearly my way of thinking. I feel sure as\r\nlong as species-mongers have their vanity tickled by seeing their own\r\nnames appended to a species, because they miserably described it in two\r\nor three lines, we shall have the same VAST amount of bad work as at\r\npresent, and which is enough to dishearten any man who is willing to\r\nwork out any branch with care and time. I find every genus of Cirripedia\r\nhas half-a-dozen names, and not one careful description of any one\r\nspecies in any one genus. I do not believe that this would have been the\r\ncase if each man knew that the memory of his own name depended on his\r\ndoing his work well, and not upon merely appending a name with a few\r\nwretched lines indicating only a few prominent external characters. But\r\nI will not weary you with any longer tirade. Read my paper or NOT, just\r\nas you like, and return it whenever you please.\r\n\r\nYours most sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUGH STRICKLAND TO CHARLES DARWIN. The Lodge, Tewkesbury, January 31st,\r\n1849.\r\n\r\n...I have next to notice your second objection--that retaining the name\r\nof the FIRST describer in perpetuum along with that of the species, is\r\na premium on hasty and careless work. This is quite a different question\r\nfrom that of the law of priority itself, and it never occurred to me\r\nbefore, though it seems highly probable that the general recognition of\r\nthat law may produce such a result. We must try to counteract this evil\r\nin some other way.\r\n\r\nThe object of appending the name of a man to the name of a species is\r\nnot to gratify the vanity of the man, but to indicate more precisely\r\nthe species. Sometimes two men will, by accident, give the same name\r\n(independently) to two species of the same genus. More frequently a\r\nlater author will misapply the specific name of an older one. Thus the\r\nHelix putris of Montagu is not H. putris of Linnaeus, though Montague\r\nsupposed it to be so. In such a case we cannot define the species by\r\nHelix putris alone, but must append the name of the author whom we\r\nquote. But when a species has never borne but one name (as Corvus\r\nfrugilegus), and no other species of Corvus has borne the same name,\r\nit is, of course, unnecessary to add the author's name. Yet even here\r\nI like the form Corvus frugilegus, Linn., as it reminds us that this\r\nis one of the old species, long known, and to be found in the 'Systema\r\nNaturae,' etc. I fear, therefore, that (at least until our nomenclature\r\nis more definitely settled) it will be impossible to indicate species\r\nwith scientific accuracy, without adding the name of their first author.\r\nYou may, indeed, do it as you propose, by saying in Lam. An. Invert.,\r\netc., but then this would be incompatible with the law of priority, for\r\nwhere Lamarck has violated that low, one cannot adopt his name. It is,\r\nnevertheless, highly conducive to accurate indication to append to the\r\n(oldest) specific name ONE good reference to a standard work, especially\r\nto a FIGURE, with an accompanying synonym if necessary. This method may\r\nbe cumbrous, but cumbrousness is a far less evil than uncertainty.\r\n\r\nIt, moreover, seems hardly possible to carry out the PRIORITY principle,\r\nwithout the historical aid afforded by appending the author's name\r\nto the specific one. If I, a PRIORITY MAN, called a species C.D., it\r\nimplies that C.D. is the oldest name that I know of; but in order\r\nthat you and others may judge of the propriety of that name, you must\r\nascertain when, and by whom, the name was first coined. Now, if to the\r\nspecific name C.D., I append the name A.B., of its first describer, I at\r\nonce furnish you with the clue to the dates when, and the book in which,\r\nthis description was given, and I thus assist you in determining whether\r\nC.D. be really the oldest, and therefore the correct, designation.\r\n\r\nI do, however, admit that the priority principle (excellent as it is)\r\nhas a tendency, when the author's name is added, to encourage vanity and\r\nslovenly work. I think, however, that much might be done to discourage\r\nthose obscure and unsatisfactory definitions of which you so justly\r\ncomplain, by WRITING DOWN the practice. Let the better disposed\r\nnaturalists combine to make a formal protest against all vague, loose,\r\nand inadequate definitions of (supposed) new species. Let a committee\r\n(say of the British Association) be appointed to prepare a sort of CLASS\r\nLIST of the various modern works in which new species are described,\r\narranged in order of merit. The lowest class would contain the worst\r\nexamples of the kind, and their authors would thus be exposed to\r\nthe obloquy which they deserve, and be gibbeted in terrorem for the\r\nedification of those who may come after.\r\n\r\nI have thus candidly stated my views (I hope intelligibly) of what\r\nseems best to be done in the present transitional and dangerous state\r\nof systematic zoology. Innumerable labourers, many of them crotchety and\r\nhalf-educated, are rushing into the field, and it depends, I think, on\r\nthe present generation whether the science is to descend to posterity a\r\nchaotic mass, or possessed of some traces of law and organisation. If we\r\ncould only get a congress of deputies from the chief scientific bodies\r\nof Europe and America, something might be done, but, as the case stands,\r\nI confess I do not clearly see my way, beyond humbly endeavouring to\r\nreform NUMBER ONE.\r\n\r\nYours ever, H.E. STRICKLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO HUGH STRICKLAND. Down, Sunday [February 4th, 1849].\r\n\r\nMy dear Strickland,\r\n\r\nI am, in truth, GREATLY obliged to you for your long, most interesting,\r\nand clear letter, and the Report. I will consider your arguments, which\r\nare of the greatest weight, but I confess I cannot yet bring myself to\r\nreject very WELL-KNOWN names, not in ONE country, but over the world,\r\nfor obscure ones,--simply on the ground that I do not believe I should\r\nbe followed. Pray believe that I should break the law of priority only\r\nin rare cases; will you read the enclosed (and return it), and tell me\r\nwhether it does not stagger you? (N.B. I PROMISE that I will not give\r\nyou any more trouble.) I want simple answers, and not for you to waste\r\nyour time in reasons; I am curious for your answer in regard to Balanus.\r\nI put the case of Otion, etc., to W. Thompson, who is fierce for the\r\nlaw of priority, and he gave it up in such well-known names. I am in\r\na perfect maze of doubt on nomenclature. In not one large genus of\r\nCirripedia has ANY ONE species been correctly defined; it is pure\r\nguesswork (being guided by range and commonness and habits) to recognise\r\nany species: thus I can make out, from plates or descriptions, hardly\r\nany of the British sessile cirripedes. I cannot bear to give new names\r\nto all the species, and yet I shall perhaps do wrong to attach old names\r\nby little better than guess; I cannot at present tell the least which\r\nof two species all writers have meant by the common Anatifera laevis;\r\nI have, therefore, given that name to the one which is rather the\r\ncommonest. Literally, not one species is properly defined; not one\r\nnaturalist has ever taken the trouble to open the shell of any species\r\nto describe it scientifically, and yet all the genera have half-a-dozen\r\nsynonyms. For ARGUMENT'S sake, suppose I do my work thoroughly well,\r\nany one who happens to have the original specimens named, I will say by\r\nChenu, who has figured and named hundreds of species, will be able to\r\nupset all my names according to the law of priority (for he may maintain\r\nhis descriptions are sufficient), do you think it advantageous to\r\nscience that this should be done: I think not, and that convenience and\r\nhigh merit (here put as mere argument) had better come into some play.\r\nThe subject is heart-breaking.\r\n\r\nI hope you will occasionally turn in your mind my argument of the evil\r\ndone by the \"mihi\" attached to specific names; I can most clearly see\r\nthe EXCESSIVE evil it has caused; in mineralogy I have myself found\r\nthere is no rage to merely name; a person does not take up the subject\r\nwithout he intends to work it out, as he knows that his ONLY claim to\r\nmerit rests on his work being ably done, and has no relation whatever\r\nto NAMING. I give up one point, and grant that reference to first\r\ndescriber's name should be given in all systematic works, but I think\r\nsomething would be gained if a reference was given without the author's\r\nname being actually appended as part of the binomial name, and I think,\r\nexcept in systematic works, a reference, such as I propose, would\r\ndamp vanity much. I think a very wrong spirit runs through all Natural\r\nHistory, as if some merit was due to a man for merely naming and\r\ndefining a species; I think scarcely any, or none, is due; if he works\r\nout MINUTELY and anatomically any one species, or systematically a whole\r\ngroup, credit is due, but I must think the mere defining a species is\r\nnothing, and that no INJUSTICE is done him if it be overlooked, though\r\na great inconvenience to Natural History is thus caused. I do not think\r\nmore credit is due to a man for defining a species, than to a carpenter\r\nfor making a box. But I am foolish and rabid against species-mongers, or\r\nrather against their vanity; it is useful and necessary work which must\r\nbe done; but they act as if they had actually made the species, and it\r\nwas their own property.\r\n\r\nI use Agassiz's nomenclator; at least two-thirds of the dates in the\r\nCirripedia are grossly wrong.\r\n\r\nI shall do what I can in fossil Cirripedia, and should be very grateful\r\nfor specimens; but I do not believe that species (and hardly genera)\r\ncan be defined by single valves; as in every recent species yet examined\r\ntheir forms vary greatly: to describe a species by valves alone, is the\r\nsame as to describe a crab from SMALL portions of its carapace alone,\r\nthese portions being highly variable, and not, as in Crustacea, modelled\r\nover viscera. I sincerely apologise for the trouble which I have given\r\nyou, but indeed I will give no more.\r\n\r\nYours most sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--In conversation I found Owen and Andrew Smith much inclined to\r\nthrow over the practice of attaching authors' names; I believe if I\r\nagitated I could get a large party to join. W. Thompson agreed some way\r\nwith me, but was not prepared to go nearly as far as I am.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO HUGH STRICKLAND. Down, February 10th [1849].\r\n\r\nMy dear Strickland,\r\n\r\nI have again to thank you cordially for your letter. Your remarks shall\r\nfructify to some extent, and I will try to be more faithful to rigid\r\nvirtue and priority; but as for calling Balanus \"Lepas\" (which I did not\r\nthink of), I cannot do it, my pen won't write it--it is IMPOSSIBLE. I\r\nhave great hopes some of my difficulties will disappear, owing to wrong\r\ndates in Agassiz, and to my having to run several genera into one, for I\r\nhave as yet gone, in but few cases, to original sources. With respect to\r\nadopting my own notions in my Cirripedia book, I should not like to\r\ndo so without I found others approved, and in some public way,--nor,\r\nindeed, is it well adapted, as I can never recognise a species without I\r\nhave the original specimen, which, fortunately, I have in many cases in\r\nthe British Museum. Thus far I mean to adopt my notion, as never putting\r\nmihi or \"Darwin\" after my own species, and in the anatomical text giving\r\nno authors' names at all, as the systematic Part will serve for those\r\nwho want to know the History of a species as far as I can imperfectly\r\nwork it out...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [The Lodge, Malvern, March 28th, 1849.]\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 13th of October has remained unanswered till this\r\nday! What an ungrateful return for a letter which interested me so much,\r\nand which contained so much and curious information. But I have had a\r\nbad winter.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of November, my poor dear father died, and no one who did\r\nnot know him would believe that a man above eighty-three years old could\r\nhave retained so tender and affectionate a disposition, with all his\r\nsagacity unclouded to the last. I was at the time so unwell, that I was\r\nunable to travel, which added to my misery. Indeed, all this winter I\r\nhave been bad enough...and my nervous system began to be affected, so\r\nthat my hands trembled, and head was often swimming. I was not able to\r\ndo anything one day out of three, and was altogether too dispirited to\r\nwrite to you, or to do anything but what I was compelled. I thought I\r\nwas rapidly going the way of all flesh. Having heard, accidentally, of\r\ntwo persons who had received much benefit from the water-cure, I got Dr.\r\nGully's book, and made further enquiries, and at last started here,\r\nwith wife, children, and all our servants. We have taken a house for\r\ntwo months, and have been here a fortnight. I am already a little\r\nstronger...Dr. Gully feels pretty sure he can do me good, which most\r\ncertainly the regular doctors could not...I feel certain that the\r\nwater-cure is no quackery.\r\n\r\nHow I shall enjoy getting back to Down with renovated health, if such\r\nis to be my good fortune, and resuming the beloved Barnacles. Now I hope\r\nthat you will forgive me for my negligence in not having sooner answered\r\nyour letter. I was uncommonly interested by the sketch you give of\r\nyour intended grand expedition, from which I suppose you will soon\r\nbe returning. How earnestly I hope that it may prove in every way\r\nsuccessful...\r\n\r\n[When my father was at the Water-cure Establishment at Malvern he\r\nwas brought into contact with clairvoyance, of which he writes in the\r\nfollowing extract from a letter to Fox, September, 1850.\r\n\r\n\"You speak about Homoeopathy, which is a subject which makes me more\r\nwrath, even than does Clairvoyance. Clairvoyance so transcends belief,\r\nthat one's ordinary faculties are put out of the question, but in\r\nhomoeopathy common sense and common observation come into play, and both\r\nthese must go to the dogs, if the infinitesimal doses have any effect\r\nwhatever. How true is a remark I saw the other day by Quetelet, in\r\nrespect to evidence of curative processes, viz., that no one knows in\r\ndisease what is the simple result of nothing being done, as a standard\r\nwith which to compare homoeopathy, and all other such things. It is a\r\nsad flaw, I cannot but think, in my beloved Dr. Gully, that he believes\r\nin everything. When Miss -- was very ill, he had a clairvoyant girl\r\nto report on internal changes, a mesmerist to put her to sleep--an\r\nhomoeopathist, viz. Dr. --, and himself as hydropathist! and the girl\r\nrecovered.\"\r\n\r\nA passage out of an earlier letter to Fox (December, 1884) shows that\r\nhe was equally sceptical on the subject of mesmerism: \"With respect to\r\nmesmerism, the whole country resounds with wonderful facts or tales..I\r\nhave just heard of a child, three or four years old (whose parents and\r\nself I well knew) mesmerised by his father, which is the first fact\r\nwhich has staggered me. I shall not believe fully till I see or hear\r\nfrom good evidence of animals (as has been stated is possible) not\r\ndrugged, being put to stupor; of course the impossibility would not\r\nprove mesmerism false; but it is the only clear experimentum crucis, and\r\nI am astonished it has not been systematically tried. If mesmerism was\r\ninvestigated, like a science, this could not have been left till the\r\npresent day to be DONE SATISFACTORILY, as it has been I believe left.\r\nKeep some cats yourself, and do get some mesmeriser to attempt it. One\r\nman told me he had succeeded, but his experiments were most vague, and\r\nas was likely from a man who said cats were more easily done than other\r\nanimals, because they were so electrical!\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, December 4th [1849].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nThis letter requires no answer, and I write from exuberance of vanity.\r\nDana has sent me the Geology of the United States Expedition, and I have\r\njust read the Coral part. To begin with a modest speech, I AM ASTONISHED\r\nAT MY OWN ACCURACY!! If I were to rewrite now my Coral book there is\r\nhardly a sentence I should have to alter, except that I ought to have\r\nattributed more effect to recent volcanic action in checking growth of\r\ncoral. When I say all this I ought to add that the CONSEQUENCES of the\r\ntheory on areas of subsidence are treated in a separate chapter to which\r\nI have not come, and in this, I suspect, we shall differ more. Dana\r\ntalks of agreeing with my theory IN MOST POINTS; I can find out not one\r\nin which he differs. Considering how infinitely more he saw of Coral\r\nReefs than I did, this is wonderfully satisfactory to me. He treats me\r\nmost courteously. There now, my vanity is pretty well satisfied...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Malvern, April 9th, 1849.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nThe very next morning after posting my last letter (I think on 23rd\r\nof March), I received your two interesting gossipaceous and geological\r\nletters; and the latter I have since exchanged with Lyell for his. I\r\nwill write higglety-pigglety just as subjects occur. I saw the Review in\r\nthe 'Athenaeum,' it was written in an ill-natured spirit; but the whole\r\nvirus consisted in saying that there was not novelty enough in your\r\nremarks for publication. No one, nowadays, cares for reviews. I may\r\njust mention that my Journal got some REAL GOOD abuse, \"presumption,\"\r\netc.,--ended with saying that the volume appeared \"made up of the scraps\r\nand rubbish of the author's portfolio.\" I most truly enter into what\r\nyou say, and quite believe you that you care only for the review with\r\nrespect to your father; and that this ALONE would make you like to\r\nsee extracts from your letters more properly noticed in this same\r\nperiodical. I have considered to the very best of my judgment whether\r\nany portion of your present letters are adapted for the 'Athenaeum' (in\r\nwhich I have no interest; the beasts not having even NOTICED my three\r\ngeological volumes which I had sent to them), and I have come to the\r\nconclusion it is better not to send them. I feel sure, considering all\r\nthe circumstances, that without you took pains and wrote WITH CARE, a\r\ncondensed and finished sketch of some striking feature in your travels,\r\nit is better not to send anything. These two letters are, moreover,\r\nrather too geological for the 'Athenaeum,' and almost require woodcuts.\r\nOn the other hand, there are hardly enough details for a communication\r\nto the Geological Society. I have not the SMALLEST DOUBT that your\r\nfacts are of the highest interest with regard to glacial action in the\r\nHimalaya; but it struck both Lyell and myself that your evidence ought\r\nto have been given more distinctly...\r\n\r\nI have written so lately that I have nothing to say about myself; my\r\nhealth prevented me going on with a crusade against \"mihi\" and \"nobis,\"\r\nof which you warn me of the dangers. I showed my paper to three or\r\nfour Naturalists, and they all agreed with me to a certain extent: with\r\nhealth and vigour, I would not have shown a white feather, [and] with\r\naid of half-a-dozen really good Naturalists, I believe something might\r\nhave been done against the miserable and degrading passion of mere\r\nspecies naming. In your letter you wonder what \"Ornamental Poultry\" has\r\nto do with Barnacles; but do not flatter yourself that I shall not yet\r\nlive to finish the Barnacles, and then make a fool of myself on the\r\nsubject of species, under which head ornamental Poultry are very\r\ninteresting...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. The Lodge, Malvern [June, 1849].\r\n\r\n...I have got your book ('A Second Visit to the United States.'), and\r\nhave read all the first and a small part of the second volume (reading\r\nis the hardest work allowed here), and greatly I have been interested by\r\nit. It makes me long to be a Yankee. E. desires me to say that she\r\nquite \"gloated\" over the truth of your remarks on religious progress...I\r\ndelight to think how you will disgust some of the bigots and educational\r\ndons. As yet there has not been MUCH Geology or Natural History, for\r\nwhich I hope you feel a little ashamed. Your remarks on all social\r\nsubjects strike me as worthy of the author of the 'Principles.' And yet\r\n(I know it is prejudice and pride) if I had written the Principles, I\r\nnever would have written any travels; but I believe I am more jealous\r\nabout the honour and glory of the Principles than you are yourself...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. September 14th, 1849.\r\n\r\n...I go on with my aqueous processes, and very steadily but slowly gain\r\nhealth and strength. Against all rules, I dined at Chevening with Lord\r\nMahon, who did me the great honour of calling on me, and how he heard of\r\nme I can't guess. I was charmed with Lady Mahon, and any one might have\r\nbeen proud at the pieces of agreeableness which came from her beautiful\r\nlips with respect to you. I like old Lord Stanhope very much; though he\r\nabused Geology and Zoology heartily. \"To suppose that the Omnipotent\r\nGod made a world, found it a failure, and broke it up, and then made\r\nit again, and again broke it up, as the Geologists say, is all fiddle\r\nfaddle. Describing Species of birds and shells, etc., is all fiddle\r\nfaddle...\"\r\n\r\nI am heartily glad we shall meet at Birmingham, as I trust we shall, if\r\nmy health will but keep up. I work now every day at the Cirripedia for\r\n2 1/2 hours, and so get on a little, but very slowly. I sometimes,\r\nafter being a whole week employed and having described perhaps only\r\ntwo species, agree mentally with Lord Stanhope, that it is all fiddle\r\nfaddle; however, the other day I got a curious case of a unisexual,\r\ninstead of hermaphrodite cirripede, in which the female had the common\r\ncirripedial character, and in two valves of her shell had two little\r\npockets, in EACH of which she kept a little husband; I do not know of\r\nany other case where a female invariably has two husbands. I have one\r\nstill odder fact, common to several species, namely, that though they\r\nare hermaphrodite, they have small additional, or as I shall call them,\r\ncomplemental males, one specimen itself hermaphrodite had no less than\r\nSEVEN, of these complemental males attached to it. Truly the schemes and\r\nwonders of Nature are illimitable. But I am running on as badly about my\r\ncirripedia as about Geology; it makes me groan to think that probably\r\nI shall never again have the exquisite pleasure of making out some new\r\ndistrict, of evolving geological light out of some troubled dark region.\r\nSo I must make the best of my Cirripedia...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, October 12th, 1849.\r\n\r\n...By the way, one of the pleasantest parts of the British Association\r\nwas my journey down to Birmingham with Mrs. Sabine, Mrs. Reeve, and\r\nthe Colonel; also Col. Sykes and Porter. Mrs. Sabine and myself agreed\r\nwonderfully on many points, and in none more sincerely than about you.\r\nWe spoke about your letters from the Erebus; and she quite agreed\r\nwith me, that you and the AUTHOR (Sir J. Hooker wrote the spirited\r\ndescription of cattle hunting in Sir J. Ross's 'Voyage of Discovery in\r\nthe Southern Regions,' 1847, vol. ii., page 245.), of the description\r\nof the cattle hunting in the Falklands, would have made a capital book\r\ntogether! A very nice woman she is, and so is her sharp and sagacious\r\nmother...Birmingham was very flat compared to Oxford, though I had my\r\nwife with me. We saw a good deal of the Lyells and Horners and Robinsons\r\n(the President); but the place was dismal, and I was prevented, by being\r\nunwell, from going to Warwick, though that, i.e., the party, by all\r\naccounts, was wonderfully inferior to Blenheim, not to say anything of\r\nthat heavenly day at Dropmore. One gets weary of all the spouting...\r\n\r\nYou ask about my cold-water cure; I am going on very well, and am\r\ncertainly a little better every month, my nights mend much slower than\r\nmy days. I have built a douche, and am to go on through all the winter,\r\nfrost or no frost. My treatment now is lamp five times per week, and\r\nshallow bath for five minutes afterwards; douche daily for five minutes,\r\nand dripping sheet daily. The treatment is wonderfully tonic, and I\r\nhave had more better consecutive days this month than on any previous\r\nones...I am allowed to work now two and a half hours daily, and I find\r\nit as much as I can do, for the cold-water cure, together with three\r\nshort walks, is curiously exhausting; and I am actually FORCED to go to\r\nbed at eight o'clock completely tired. I steadily gain in weight, and\r\neat immensely, and am never oppressed with my food. I have lost the\r\ninvoluntary twitching of the muscle, and all the fainting feelings,\r\netc--black spots before eyes, etc. Dr. Gully thinks he shall quite cure\r\nme in six or nine months more.\r\n\r\nThe greatest bore, which I find in the water-cure, is the having been\r\ncompelled to give up all reading, except the newspapers; for my daily\r\ntwo and a half hours at the Barnacles is fully as much as I can do of\r\nanything which occupies the mind; I am consequently terribly behind\r\nin all scientific books. I have of late been at work at mere species\r\ndescribing, which is much more difficult than I expected, and has much\r\nthe same sort of interest as a puzzle has; but I confess I often feel\r\nwearied with the work, and cannot help sometimes asking myself what is\r\nthe good of spending a week or fortnight in ascertaining that certain\r\njust perceptible differences blend together and constitute varieties\r\nand not species. As long as I am on anatomy I never feel myself in that\r\ndisgusting, horrid, cui bono, inquiring, humour. What miserable work,\r\nagain, it is searching for priority of names. I have just finished two\r\nspecies, which possess seven generic, and twenty-four specific names! My\r\nchief comfort is, that the work must be sometime done, and I may as well\r\ndo it, as any one else.\r\n\r\nI have given up my agitation against mihi and nobis; my paper is too\r\nlong to send to you, so you must see it, if you care to do so, on your\r\nreturn. By-the-way, you say in your letter that you care more for my\r\nspecies work than for the Barnacles; now this is too bad of you, for I\r\ndeclare your decided approval of my plain Barnacle work over theoretic\r\nspecies work, had very great influence in deciding me to go on with the\r\nformer, and defer my species paper...\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter refers to the death of his little daughter, which\r\ntook place at Malvern on April 24, 1851:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, April 29th [1851].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nI do not suppose you will have heard of our bitter and cruel loss. Poor\r\ndear little Annie, when going on very well at Malvern, was taken with a\r\nvomiting attack, which was at first thought of the smallest importance;\r\nbut it rapidly assumed the form of a low and dreadful fever, which\r\ncarried her off in ten days. Thank God, she suffered hardly at all, and\r\nexpired as tranquilly as a little angel. Our only consolation is that\r\nshe passed a short, though joyous life. She was my favourite child; her\r\ncordiality, openness, buoyant joyousness and strong affections made her\r\nmost lovable. Poor dear little soul. Well it is all over...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, March 7th [1852].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nIt is indeed an age since we have had any communication, and very glad\r\nI was to receive your note. Our long silence occurred to me a few weeks\r\nsince, and I had then thought of writing, but was idle. I congratulate\r\nand condole with you on your TENTH child; but please to observe when I\r\nhave a tenth, send only condolences to me. We have now seven children,\r\nall well, thank God, as well as their mother; of these seven, five are\r\nboys; and my father used to say that it was certain that a boy gave\r\nas much trouble as three girls; so that bona fide we have seventeen\r\nchildren. It makes me sick whenever I think of professions; all seem\r\nhopelessly bad, and as yet I cannot see a ray of light. I should\r\nvery much like to talk over this (by the way, my three bugbears are\r\nCalifornian and Australian gold, beggaring me by making my money on\r\nmortgage worth nothing; the French coming by the Westerham and Sevenoaks\r\nroads, and therefore enclosing Down; and thirdly, professions for my\r\nboys), and I should like to talk about education, on which you ask me\r\nwhat we are doing. No one can more truly despise the old stereotyped\r\nstupid classical education than I do; but yet I have not had courage\r\nto break through the trammels. After many doubts we have just sent our\r\neldest boy to Rugby, where for his age he has been very well placed...I\r\nhonour, admire, and envy you for educating your boys at home. What on\r\nearth shall you do with your boys? Towards the end of this month we\r\ngo to see W. at Rugby, and thence for five or six days to Susan (His\r\nsister.) at Shrewsbury; I then return home to look after the babies,\r\nand E. goes to F. Wedgwood's of Etruria for a week. Very many thanks\r\nfor your most kind and large invitation to Delamere, but I fear we can\r\nhardly compass it. I dread going anywhere, on account of my stomach so\r\neasily failing under any excitement. I rarely even now go to London;\r\nnot that I am at all worse, perhaps rather better, and lead a very\r\ncomfortable life with my three hours of daily work, but it is the\r\nlife of a hermit. My nights are ALWAYS bad, and that stops my becoming\r\nvigorous. You ask about water-cure. I take at intervals of two or three\r\nmonths, five or six weeks of MODERATELY severe treatment, and always\r\nwith good effect. Do you come here, I pray and beg whenever you can find\r\ntime; you cannot tell how much pleasure it would give me and E. I have\r\nfinished the 1st volume for the Ray Society of Pedunculated Cirripedes,\r\nwhich, as I think you are a member, you will soon get. Read what I\r\ndescribe on the sexes of Ibla and Scalpellum. I am now at work on the\r\nSessile Cirripedes, and am wonderfully tired of my job: a man to be a\r\nsystematic naturalist ought to work at least eight hours per day. You\r\nsaw through me, when you said that I must have wished to have seen the\r\neffects of the [word illegible] Debacle, for I was saying a week ago to\r\nE., that had I been as I was in old days, I would have been certainly\r\noff that hour. You ask after Erasmus; he is much as usual, and\r\nconstantly more or less unwell. Susan (His sister.) is much better, and\r\nvery flourishing and happy. Catherine (Another sister.) is at Rome,\r\nand has enjoyed it in a degree that is quite astonishing to my dry old\r\nbones. And now I think I have told you enough, and more than enough\r\nabout the house of Darwin; so my dear old friend, farewell. What\r\npleasant times we had in drinking coffee in your rooms at Christ's\r\nCollege, and think of the glories of Crux major. (The beetle Panagaeus\r\ncrux-major.) Ah, in those days there were no professions for sons, no\r\nill-health to fear for them, no Californian gold, no French invasions.\r\nHow paramount the future is to the present when one is surrounded by\r\nchildren. My dread is hereditary ill-health. Even death is better for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox, your sincere friend, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Susan has lately been working in a way which I think truly heroic\r\nabout the scandalous violation of the Act against children climbing\r\nchimneys. We have set up a little Society in Shrewsbury to prosecute\r\nthose who break the law. It is all Susan's doing. She has had very nice\r\nletters from Lord Shaftesbury and the Duke of Sutherland, but the brutal\r\nShropshire squires are as hard as stones to move. The Act out of London\r\nseems most commonly violated. It makes one shudder to fancy one of\r\none's own children at seven years old being forced up a chimney--to say\r\nnothing of the consequent loathsome disease and ulcerated limbs, and\r\nutter moral degradation. If you think strongly on this subject, do make\r\nsome inquiries; add to your many good works, this other one, and try\r\nto stir up the magistrates. There are several people making a stir in\r\ndifferent parts of England on this subject. It is not very likely\r\nthat you would wish for such, but I could send you some essays and\r\ninformation if you so liked, either for yourself or to give away.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down [October 24th, 1852].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nI received your long and most welcome letter this morning, and will\r\nanswer it this evening, as I shall be very busy with an artist, drawing\r\nCirripedia, and much overworked for the next fortnight. But first you\r\ndeserve to be well abused--and pray consider yourself well abused--for\r\nthinking or writing that I could for one minute be bored by any amount\r\nof detail about yourself and belongings. It is just what I like hearing;\r\nbelieve me that I often think of old days spent with you, and sometimes\r\ncan hardly believe what a jolly careless individual one was in those\r\nold days. A bright autumn evening often brings to mind some shooting\r\nexcursion from Osmaston. I do indeed regret that we live so far off each\r\nother, and that I am so little locomotive. I have been unusually well\r\nof late (no water-cure), but I do not find that I can stand any change\r\nbetter than formerly...The other day I went to London and back, and\r\nthe fatigue, though so trifling, brought on my bad form of vomiting. I\r\ngrieve to hear that your chest has been ailing, and most sincerely do\r\nI hope that it is only the muscles; how frequently the voice fails with\r\nthe clergy. I can well understand your reluctance to break up your large\r\nand happy party and go abroad; but your life is very valuable, so you\r\nought to be very cautious in good time. You ask about all of us, now\r\nfive boys (oh! the professions; oh! the gold; and oh! the French--these\r\nthree oh's all rank as dreadful bugbears) and two girls...but another\r\nand the worst of my bugbears is hereditary weakness. All my sisters are\r\nwell except Mrs. Parker, who is much out of health; and so is Erasmus\r\nat his poor average: he has lately moved into Queen Anne Street. I had\r\nheard of the intended marriage (To the Rev. J. Hughes.) of your sister\r\nFrances. I believe I have seen her since, but my memory takes me back\r\nsome twenty-five years, when she was lying down. I remember well the\r\ndelightful expression of her countenance. I most sincerely wish her all\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nI see I have not answered half your queries. We like very well all that\r\nwe have seen and heard of Rugby, and have never repented of sending [W.]\r\nthere. I feel sure schools have greatly improved since our days; but I\r\nhate schools and the whole system of breaking through the affections of\r\nthe family by separating the boys so early in life; but I see no help,\r\nand dare not run the risk of a youth being exposed to the temptations of\r\nthe world without having undergone the milder ordeal of a great school.\r\n\r\nI see you even ask after our pears. We have lots of Beurrees d'Aremberg,\r\nWinter Nelis, Marie Louise, and \"Ne plus Ultra,\" but all off the wall;\r\nthe standard dwarfs have borne a few, but I have no room for more trees,\r\nso their names would be useless to me. You really must make a holiday\r\nand pay us a visit sometime; nowhere could you be more heartily welcome.\r\nI am at work at the second volume of the Cirripedia, of which creatures\r\nI am wonderfully tired. I hate a Barnacle as no man ever did before, not\r\neven a sailor in a slow-sailing ship. My first volume is out; the only\r\npart worth looking at is on the sexes of Ibla and Scalpellum. I hope\r\nby next summer to have done with my tedious work. Farewell,--do come\r\nwhenever you can possibly manage it.\r\n\r\nI cannot but hope that the carbuncle may possibly do you good: I have\r\nheard of all sorts of weaknesses disappearing after a carbuncle. I\r\nsuppose the pain is dreadful. I agree most entirely, what a blessed\r\ndiscovery is chloroform. When one thinks of one's children, it makes\r\nquite a little difference in one's happiness. The other day I had five\r\ngrinders (two by the elevator) out at a sitting under this wonderful\r\nsubstance, and felt hardly anything.\r\n\r\nMy dear old friend, yours very affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, January 29th [1853].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nYour last account some months ago was so little satisfactory that I have\r\noften been thinking of you, and should be really obliged if you would\r\ngive me a few lines, and tell me how your voice and chest are. I most\r\nsincerely hope that your report will be good...Our second lad has a\r\nstrong mechanical turn, and we think of making him an engineer. I shall\r\ntry and find out for him some less classical school, perhaps Bruce\r\nCastle. I certainly should like to see more diversity in education\r\nthan there is in any ordinary school--no exercising of the observing or\r\nreasoning faculties, no general knowledge acquired--I must think it a\r\nwretched system. On the other hand, a boy who has learnt to stick at\r\nLatin and conquer its difficulties, ought to be able to stick at any\r\nlabour. I should always be glad to hear anything about schools or\r\neducation from you. I am at my old, never-ending subject, but trust\r\nI shall really go to press in a few months with my second volume on\r\nCirripedes. I have been much pleased by finding some odd facts in my\r\nfirst volume believed by Owen and a few others, whose good opinion I\r\nregard as final...Do write pretty soon, and tell me all you can about\r\nyourself and family; and I trust your report of yourself may be much\r\nbetter than your last.\r\n\r\n...I have been very little in London of late, and have not seen Lyell\r\nsince his return from America; how lucky he was to exhume with his\r\nown hand parts of three skeletons of reptiles out of the CARBONIFEROUS\r\nstrata, and out of the inside of a fossil tree, which had been hollow\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my dear Fox, yours affectionately, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. 13 Sea Houses, Eastbourne, [July 15th?\r\n1853].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nHere we are in a state of profound idleness, which to me is a luxury;\r\nand we should all, I believe, have been in a state of high enjoyment,\r\nhad it not been for the detestable cold gales and much rain, which\r\nalways gives much ennui to children away from their homes. I received\r\nyour letter of 13th June, when working like a slave with Mr. Sowerby at\r\ndrawing for my second volume, and so put off answering it till when I\r\nknew I should be at leisure. I was extremely glad to get your letter. I\r\nhad intended a couple of months ago sending you a savage or supplicating\r\njobation to know how you were, when I met Sir P. Egerton, who told me\r\nyou were well, and, as usual, expressed his admiration of your doings,\r\nespecially your farming, and the number of animals, including children,\r\nwhich you kept on your land. Eleven children, ave Maria! it is a serious\r\nlook-out for you. Indeed, I look at my five boys as something awful, and\r\nhate the very thoughts of professions, etc. If one could insure moderate\r\nhealth for them it would not signify so much, for I cannot but hope,\r\nwith the enormous emigration, professions will somewhat improve. But my\r\nbugbear is hereditary weakness. I particularly like to hear all that you\r\ncan say about education, and you deserve to be scolded for saying \"you\r\ndid not mean to TORMENT me with a long yarn.\" You ask about Rugby.\r\nI like it very well, on the same principle as my neighbour, Sir J.\r\nLubbock, likes Eton, viz., that it is not worse than any other school;\r\nthe expense, WITH ALL ETC., ETC., including some clothes, travelling\r\nexpenses, etc., is from 110 pounds to 120 pounds per annum. I do not\r\nthink schools are so wicked as they were, and far more industrious. The\r\nboys, I think, live too secluded in their separate studies; and I doubt\r\nwhether they will get so much knowledge of character as boys used to do;\r\nand this, in my opinion, is the ONE good of public schools over small\r\nschools. I should think the only superiority of a small school over home\r\nwas forced regularity in their work, which your boys perhaps get at\r\nyour home, but which I do not believe my boys would get at my home.\r\nOtherwise, it is quite lamentable sending boys so early in life from\r\ntheir home.\r\n\r\n...To return to schools. My main objection to them, as places of\r\neducation, is the enormous proportion of time spent over classics. I\r\nfancy (though perhaps it is only fancy) that I can perceive the ill\r\nand contracting effect on my eldest boy's mind, in checking interest in\r\nanything in which reasoning and observation come into play. Mere memory\r\nseems to be worked. I shall certainly look out for some school with more\r\ndiversified studies for my younger boys. I was talking lately to the\r\nDean of Hereford, who takes most strongly this view; and he tells me\r\nthat there is a school at Hereford commencing on this plan; and that\r\nDr. Kennedy at Shrewsbury is going to begin vigorously to modify that\r\nschool...\r\n\r\nI am EXTREMELY glad to hear that you approved of my cirripedial volume.\r\nI have spent an almost ridiculous amount of labour on the subject, and\r\ncertainly would never have undertaken it had I foreseen what a job it\r\nwas. I hope to have finished by the end of the year. Do write again\r\nbefore a very long time; it is a real pleasure to me to hear from you.\r\nFarewell, with my wife's kindest remembrances to yourself and Mrs. Fox.\r\n\r\nMy dear old friend, yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, August 10th [1853].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for writing to me so soon after your most\r\nheavy misfortune. Your letter affected me so much. We both most truly\r\nsympathise with you and Mrs. Fox. We too lost, as you may remember, not\r\nso very long ago, a most dear child, of whom I can hardly yet bear\r\nto think tranquilly; yet, as you must know from your own most painful\r\nexperience, time softens and deadens, in a manner truly wonderful, one's\r\nfeelings and regrets. At first it is indeed bitter. I can only hope that\r\nyour health and that of poor Mrs. Fox may be preserved, and that time\r\nmay do its work softly, and bring you all together, once again, as the\r\nhappy family, which, as I can well believe, you so lately formed.\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox, your affectionate friend, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter refers to the Royal Society's Medal, which was\r\nawarded to him in November, 1853:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 5th [1853].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nAmongst my letters received this morning, I opened first one from\r\nColonel Sabine; the contents certainly surprised me very much, but,\r\nthough the letter was a VERY KIND ONE, somehow, I cared very little\r\nindeed for the announcement it contained. I then opened yours, and\r\nsuch is the effect of warmth, friendship, and kindness from one that is\r\nloved, that the very same fact, told as you told it, made me glow with\r\npleasure till my very heart throbbed. Believe me, I shall not soon\r\nforget the pleasure of your letter. Such hearty, affectionate sympathy\r\nis worth more than all the medals that ever were or will be coined.\r\nAgain, my dear Hooker, I thank you. I hope Lindley (John Lindley,\r\n1799-1865, was the son of a nurseryman near Norwich, through whose\r\nfailure in business he was thrown at the age of twenty on his own\r\nresources. He was befriended by Sir W. Hooker, and employed as assistant\r\nlibrarian by Sir J. Banks. He seems to have had enormous capacity of\r\nwork, and is said to have translated Richard's 'Analyse du Fruit' at one\r\nsitting of two days and three nights. He became Assistant-Secretary to\r\nthe Horticultural Society, and in 1829 was appointed Professor of Botany\r\nat University College, a post which he held for upwards of thirty years.\r\nHis writings are numerous: the best known being perhaps his 'Vegetable\r\nKingdom,' published in 1846. His influence in helping to introduce the\r\nnatural system of classification was considerable, and he brought \"all\r\nthe weight of his teaching and all the force of his controversial powers\r\nto support it,\" as against the Linnean system universally taught in the\r\nearlier part of his career. Sachs points out (Geschichte der Botanik,\r\n1875, page 161), that though Lindley adopted in the main a sound\r\nclassification of plants, he only did so by abandoning his own\r\ntheoretical principle that the physiological importance of an organ is\r\na measure of its classificatory value.) will never hear that he was a\r\ncompetitor against me; for really it is almost RIDICULOUS (of course you\r\nwould never repeat that I said this, for it would be thought by others,\r\nthough not, I believe, by you, to be affectation) his not having the\r\nmedal long before me; I must feel SURE that you did quite right to\r\npropose him; and what a good, dear, kind fellow you are, nevertheless,\r\nto rejoice in this honour being bestowed on me.\r\n\r\nWhat PLEASURE I have felt on the occasion, I owe almost entirely to you.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my dear Hooker, yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--You may believe what a surprise it was, for I had never heard that\r\nthe medals could be given except for papers in the 'Transactions.' All\r\nthis will make me work with better heart at finishing the second volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, February 18th [1854].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI should have written before, had it not seemed doubtful whether you\r\nwould go on to Teneriffe, but now I am extremely glad to hear your\r\nfurther progress is certain; not that I have much of any sort to say, as\r\nyou may well believe when you hear that I have only once been in London\r\nsince you started. I was particularly glad to see, two days since, your\r\nletter to Mr. Horner, with its geological news; how fortunate for you\r\nthat your knees are recovered. I am astonished at what you say of the\r\nbeauty, though I had fancied it great. It really makes me quite envious\r\nto think of your clambering up and down those steep valleys. And what\r\na pleasant party on your return from your expeditions. I often think\r\nof the delight which I felt when examining volcanic islands, and I can\r\nremember even particular rocks which I struck, and the smell of the hot,\r\nblack, scoriaceous cliffs; but of those HOT smells you do not seem to\r\nhave had much. I do quite envy you. How I should like to be with you,\r\nand speculate on the deep and narrow valleys.\r\n\r\nHow very singular the fact is which you mention about the inclination of\r\nthe strata being greater round the circumference than in the middle\r\nof the island; do you suppose the elevation has had the form of a flat\r\ndome? I remember in the Cordillera being OFTEN struck with the greater\r\nabruptness of the strata in the LOW EXTREME outermost ranges, compared\r\nwith the great mass of inner mountains. I dare say you will have thought\r\nof measuring exactly the width of any dikes at the top and bottom of any\r\ngreat cliff (which was done by Mr. Searle [?] at St. Helena), for it\r\nhas often struck me as VERY ODD that the cracks did not die out OFTENER\r\nupwards. I can think of hardly any news to tell you, as I have seen no\r\none since being in London, when I was delighted to see Forbes looking so\r\nwell, quite big and burly. I saw at the Museum some of the surprisingly\r\nrich gold ore from North Wales. Ramsay also told me that he has lately\r\nturned a good deal of New Red Sandstone into Permian, together with the\r\nLabyrinthodon. No doubt you see newspapers, and know that E. de Beaumont\r\nis perpetual Secretary, and will, I suppose, be more powerful than ever;\r\nand Le Verrier has Arago's place in the Observatory. There was a meeting\r\nlately at the Geological Society, at which Prestwich (judging from what\r\nR. Jones told me) brought forward your exact theory, viz. that the whole\r\nred clay and flints over the chalk plateau hereabouts is the residuum\r\nfrom the slow dissolution of the chalk!\r\n\r\nAs regards ourselves, we have no news, and are all well. The Hookers,\r\nsometime ago, stayed a fortnight with us, and, to our extreme delight,\r\nHenslow came down, and was most quiet and comfortable here. It does one\r\ngood to see so composed, benevolent, and intellectual a countenance.\r\nThere have been great fears that his heart is affected; but, I hope\r\nto God, without foundation. Hooker's book (Sir J. Hooker's 'Himalayan\r\nJournal.') is out, and MOST BEAUTIFULLY got up. He has honoured me\r\nbeyond measure by dedicating it to me! As for myself, I am got to the\r\npage 112 of the Barnacles, and that is the sum total of my history.\r\nBy-the-way, as you care so much about North America, I may mention that\r\nI had a long letter from a shipmate in Australia, who says the Colony is\r\ngetting decidedly republican from the influx of Americans, and that\r\nall the great and novel schemes for working the gold are planned and\r\nexecuted by these men. What a go-a-head nation it is! Give my kindest\r\nremembrances to Lady Lyell, and to Mrs. Bunbury, and to Bunbury. I\r\nmost heartily wish that the Canaries may be ten times as interesting as\r\nMadeira, and that everything may go on most prosperously with your whole\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell, Yours most truly and affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 1st [1854].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI finished yesterday evening the first volume, and I very sincerely\r\ncongratulate you on having produced a FIRST-CLASS book ('Himalayan\r\nJournal.')--a book which certainly will last. I cannot doubt that it\r\nwill take its place as a standard, not so much because it contains real\r\nsolid matter, but that it gives a picture of the whole country. One can\r\nfeel that one has seen it (and desperately uncomfortable I felt in going\r\nover some of the bridges and steep slopes), and one REALISES all the\r\ngreat Physical features. You have in truth reason to be proud; consider\r\nhow few travellers there have been with a profound knowledge of one\r\nsubject, and who could in addition make a map (which, by-the-way, is one\r\nof the most distinct ones I ever looked at, wherefore blessings alight\r\non your head), and study geology and meteorology! I thought I knew you\r\nvery well, but I had not the least idea that your Travels were your\r\nhobby; but I am heartily glad of it, for I feel sure that the time will\r\nnever come when you and Mrs. Hooker will not be proud to look back at\r\nthe labour bestowed on these beautiful volumes.\r\n\r\nYour letter, received this morning, has interested me EXTREMELY, and I\r\nthank you sincerely for telling me your old thoughts and aspirations.\r\nAll that you say makes me even more deeply gratified by the Dedication;\r\nbut you, bad man, do you remember asking me how I thought Lyell\r\nwould like the work to be dedicated to him? I remember how strongly I\r\nanswered, and I presume you wanted to know what I should feel; whoever\r\nwould have dreamed of your being so crafty? I am glad you have shown a\r\nlittle bit of ambition about your Journal, for you must know that I have\r\noften abused you for not caring more about fame, though, at the same\r\ntime, I must confess, I have envied and honoured you for being so free\r\n(too free, as I have always thought) of this \"last infirmity of, etc.\"\r\nDo not say, \"there never was a past hitherto to me--the phantom was\r\nalways in view,\" for you will soon find other phantoms in view. How well\r\nI know this feeling, and did formerly still more vividly; but I think\r\nmy stomach has much deadened my former pure enthusiasm for science and\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nI am writing an unconscionably long letter, but I must return to the\r\nJournals, about which I have hardly said anything in detail. Imprimis,\r\nthe illustrations and maps appear to me the best I have ever seen; the\r\nstyle seems to me everywhere perfectly clear (how rare a virtue), and\r\nsome passages really eloquent. How excellently you have described the\r\nupper valleys, and how detestable their climate; I felt quite anxious on\r\nthe slopes of Kinchin that dreadful snowy night. Nothing has astonished\r\nme more than your physical strength; and all those devilish bridges!\r\nWell, thank goodness! It is not VERY likely that I shall ever go to\r\nthe Himalaya. Much in a scientific point of view has interested me,\r\nespecially all about those wonderful moraines. I certainly think I quite\r\nrealise the valleys, more vividly perhaps from having seen the valleys\r\nof Tahiti. I cannot doubt that the Himalaya owe almost all their contour\r\nto running water, and that they have been subjected to such action\r\nlonger than any mountains (as yet described) in the world. What a\r\ncontrast with the Andes!\r\n\r\nPerhaps you would like to hear the very little that I can say per\r\ncontra, and this only applied to the beginning, in which (as it struck\r\nme) there was not FLOW enough till you get to Mirzapore on the Ganges\r\n(but the Thugs were MOST interesting), where the stream seemed to\r\ncarry you on more equably with longer sentences and longer facts and\r\ndiscussions, etc. In another edition (and I am delighted to hear that\r\nMurray has sold all off), I would consider whether this part could not\r\nbe condensed. Even if the meteorology was put in foot-notes, I think it\r\nwould be an improvement. All the world is against me, but it makes me\r\nvery unhappy to see the Latin names all in Italics, and all mingled with\r\nEnglish names in Roman type; but I must bear this burden, for all men of\r\nScience seem to think it would corrupt the Latin to dress it up in the\r\nsame type as poor old English. Well, I am very proud of MY book; but\r\nthere is one bore, that I do not much like asking people whether they\r\nhave seen it, and how they like it, for I feel so much identified with\r\nit, that such questions become rather personal. Hence, I cannot tell you\r\nthe opinion of others. You will have seen a fairly good review in the\r\n'Athenaeum.'\r\n\r\nWhat capital news from Tasmania: it really is a very remarkable and\r\ncreditable fact to the Colony. (This refers to an unsolicited grant by\r\nthe Colonial Government towards the expenses of Sir J. Hooker's 'Flora\r\nof Tasmania.') I am always building veritable castles in the air about\r\nemigrating, and Tasmania has been my head-quarters of late; so that I\r\nfeel very proud of my adopted country: is really a very singular and\r\ndelightful fact, contrasted with the slight appreciation of science in\r\nthe old country. I thank you heartily for your letter this morning, and\r\nfor all the gratification your Dedication has given me; I could not help\r\nthinking how much -- would despise you for not having dedicated it to\r\nsome great man, who would have done you and it some good in the eyes\r\nof the world. Ah, my dear Hooker, you were very soft on this head, and\r\njustify what I say about not caring enough for your own fame. I wish\r\nI was in every way more worthy of your good opinion. Farewell.\r\nHow pleasantly Mrs. Hooker and you must rest from one of your many\r\nlabours...\r\n\r\nAgain farewell: I have written a wonderfully long letter. Adios, and God\r\nbless you.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker, ever yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have just looked over my rambling letter; I see that I have not\r\nat all expressed my strong admiration at the amount of scientific work,\r\nin so many branches, which you have effected. It is really grand. You\r\nhave a right to rest on your oars; or even to say, if it so pleases you,\r\nthat \"your meridian is past;\" but well assured do I feel that the day of\r\nyour reputation and general recognition has only just begun to dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In September, 1854, his Cirripede work was practically finished, and he\r\nwrote to Dr. Hooker:\r\n\r\n\"I have been frittering away my time for the last several weeks in a\r\nwearisome manner, partly idleness, and odds and ends, and sending ten\r\nthousand Barnacles out of the house all over the world. But I shall now\r\nin a day or two begin to look over my old notes on species. What a deal\r\nI shall have to discuss with you; I shall have to look sharp that I do\r\nnot 'progress' into one of the greatest bores in life, to the few like\r\nyou with lots of knowledge.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.X. -- THE GROWTH OF THE 'ORIGIN OF SPECIES.'\r\n\r\n[The growth of the 'Origin of Species' has been briefly described in my\r\nfather's words (above). The letters given in the present and following\r\nchapters will illustrate and amplify the history thus sketched out.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear that in the early part of the voyage of the \"Beagle\" he did\r\nnot feel it inconsistent with his views to express himself in thoroughly\r\northodox language as to the genesis of new species. Thus in 1834 he\r\nwrote (MS. Journals, page 468.) at Valparaiso: \"I have already found\r\nbeds of recent shells yet retaining their colour at an elevation of 1300\r\nfeet, and beneath, the level country is strewn with them. It seems not a\r\nvery improbable conjecture that the want of animals may be owing to none\r\nhaving been created since this country was raised from the sea.\"\r\n\r\nThis passage does not occur in the published 'Journal,' the last proof\r\nof which was finished in 1837; and this fact harmonizes with the change\r\nwe know to have been proceeding in his views. But in the published\r\n'Journal' we find passages which show a point of view more in accordance\r\nwith orthodox theological natural history than with his later views.\r\nThus, in speaking of the birds Synallaxis and Scytalopus (1st edition\r\npage 353; 2nd edition page 289), he says: \"When finding, as in this\r\ncase, any animal which seems to play so insignificant a part in the\r\ngreat scheme of nature, one is apt to wonder why a distinct species\r\nshould have been created.\"\r\n\r\nA comparison of the two editions of the 'Journal' is instructive, as\r\ngiving some idea of the development of his views on evolution. It does\r\nnot give us a true index of the mass of conjecture which was taking\r\nshape in his mind, but it shows us that he felt sure enough of the truth\r\nof his belief to allow a stronger tinge of evolution to appear in the\r\nsecond edition. He has mentioned in the Autobiography that it was not\r\nuntil he read Malthus that he got a clear view of the potency of natural\r\nselection. This was in 1838--a year after he finished the first edition\r\n(it was not published until 1839), and five years before the second\r\nedition was written (1845). Thus the turning-point in the formation of\r\nhis theory took place between the writing of the two editions.\r\n\r\nI will first give a few passages which are practically the same in\r\nthe two editions, and which are, therefore, chiefly of interest as\r\nillustrating his frame of mind in 1837.\r\n\r\nThe case of the two species of Molothrus (1st edition page 61; 2nd\r\nedition page 53) must have been one of the earliest instances noticed\r\nby him of the existence of representative species--a phenomenon which we\r\nknow ('Autobiography,') struck him deeply. The discussion on introduced\r\nanimals (1st edition page 139; 2nd edition page 120) shows how much he\r\nwas impressed by the complicated interdependence of the inhabitants of a\r\ngiven area.\r\n\r\nAn analogous point of view is given in the discussion (1st edition\r\npage 98; 2nd edition page 85) of the mistaken belief that large animals\r\nrequire, for their support, a luxuriant vegetation; the incorrectness of\r\nthis view is illustrated by the comparison of the fauna of South\r\nAfrica and South America, and the vegetation of the two continents.\r\nThe interest of the discussion is that it shows clearly our a priori\r\nignorance of the conditions of life suitable to any organism.\r\n\r\nThere is a passage which has been more than once quoted as bearing\r\non the origin of his views. It is where he discusses the striking\r\ndifference between the species of mice on the east and west of the Andes\r\n(1st edition page 399): \"Unless we suppose the same species to have been\r\ncreated in two different countries, we ought not to expect any closer\r\nsimilarity between the organic beings on the opposite sides of the\r\nAndes than on shores separated by a broad strait of the sea.\" In the\r\n2nd edition page 327, the passage is almost verbally identical, and is\r\npractically the same.\r\n\r\nThere are other passages again which are more strongly evolutionary in\r\nthe 2nd edition, but otherwise are similar to the corresponding passages\r\nin the 1st edition. Thus, in describing the blind Tuco-tuco (1st edition\r\npage 60; 2nd edition page 52), in the first edition he makes no allusion\r\nto what Lamarck might have thought, nor is the instance used as an\r\nexample of modification, as in the edition of 1845.\r\n\r\nA striking passage occurs in the 2nd edition (page 173) on the\r\nrelationship between the \"extinct edentata and the living sloths,\r\nant-eaters, and armadillos.\"\r\n\r\n\"This wonderful relationship in the same continent between the dead\r\nand the living, will, I do not doubt, hereafter throw more light on the\r\nappearance of organic beings on our earth, and their disappearance from\r\nit, than any other class of facts.\"\r\n\r\nThis sentence does not occur in the 1st edition, but he was evidently\r\nprofoundly struck by the disappearance of the gigantic forerunners of\r\nthe present animals. The difference between the discussions in the two\r\neditions is most instructive. In both, our ignorance of the conditions\r\nof life is insisted on, but in the second edition, the discussion is\r\nmade to led up to a strong statement of the intensity of the struggle\r\nfor life. Then follows a comparison between rarity (In the second\r\nedition, page 146, the destruction of Niata cattle by droughts is\r\ngiven as a good example of our ignorance of the causes of rarity or\r\nextinction. The passage does not occur in the first edition.) and\r\nextinction, which introduces the idea that the preservation and\r\ndominance of existing species depend on the degree in which they are\r\nadapted to surrounding conditions. In the first edition, he is merely\r\n\"tempted to believe in such simple relations as variation of climate\r\nand food, or introduction of enemies, or the increased number of other\r\nspecies, as the cause of the succession of races.\" But finally (1st\r\nedition) he ends the chapter by comparing the extinction of a species to\r\nthe exhaustion and disappearance of varieties of fruit-trees: as if he\r\nthought that a mysterious term of life was impressed on each species at\r\nits creation.\r\n\r\nThe difference of treatment of the Galapagos problem is of some\r\ninterest. In the earlier book, the American type of the productions\r\nof the islands is noticed, as is the fact that the different islands\r\npossess forms specially their own, but the importance of the whole\r\nproblem is not so strongly put forward. Thus, in the first edition, he\r\nmerely says:--\r\n\r\n\"This similarity of type between distant islands and continents, while\r\nthe species are distinct, has scarcely been sufficiently noticed. The\r\ncircumstance would be explained, according to the views of some authors,\r\nby saying that the creative power had acted according to the same law\r\nover a wide area.\"--(1st edition page 474.)\r\n\r\nThis passage is not given in the second edition, and the generalisations\r\non geographical distribution are much wider and fuller. Thus he asks:--\r\n\r\n\"Why were their aboriginal inhabitants, associated...in different\r\nproportions both in kind and number from those on the Continent, and\r\ntherefore acting on each other in a different manner--why were they\r\ncreated on American types of organisation?\"--(2nd edition page 393.)\r\n\r\nThe same difference of treatment is shown elsewhere in this chapter.\r\nThus the gradation in the form of beak presented by the thirteen allied\r\nspecies of finch is described in the first edition (page 461) without\r\ncomment. Whereas in the second edition (page 380) he concludes:--\r\n\r\n\"One might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this\r\nArchipelago, one species has been taken and modified for different\r\nends.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole it seems to me remarkable that the difference between the\r\ntwo editions is not greater; it is another proof of the author's caution\r\nand self-restraint in the treatment of his theory. After reading the\r\nsecond edition of the 'Journal,' we find with a strong sense of surprise\r\nhow far developed were his views in 1837. We are enabled to form\r\nan opinion on this point from the note-books in which he wrote down\r\ndetached thoughts and queries. I shall quote from the first note-book,\r\ncompleted between July 1837 and February 1838: and this is the more\r\nworth doing, as it gives us an insight into the condition of his\r\nthoughts before the reading of Malthus. The notes are written in his\r\nmost hurried style, so many words being omitted, that it is often\r\ndifficult to arrive at the meaning. With a few exceptions (indicated by\r\nsquare brackets) (In the extracts from the note-book ordinary brackets\r\nrepresent my father's parentheses.) I have printed the extracts as\r\nwritten; the punctuation, however, has been altered, and a few obvious\r\nslips corrected where it seemed necessary. The extracts are not\r\nprinted in order, but are roughly classified. (On the first page of the\r\nnote-book, is written \"Zoonomia\"; this seems to refer to the first few\r\npages in which reproduction by gemmation is discussed, and where the\r\n\"Zoonomia\" is mentioned. Many pages have been cut out of the note-book,\r\nprobably for use in writing the Sketch of 1844, and these would have no\r\ndoubt contained the most interesting extracts.)\r\n\r\n\"Propagation explains why modern animals same type as extinct, which is\r\nlaw, almost proved.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can see why structure is common in certain countries when we can\r\nhardly believe necessary, but if it was necessary to one forefather,\r\nthe result would be as it is. Hence antelopes at Cape of Good Hope;\r\nmarsupials at Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Countries longest separated greatest differences--if separated\r\nfrom immersage, possibly two distinct types, but each having its\r\nrepresentatives--as in Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will this apply to whole organic kingdom when our planet first cooled?\"\r\n\r\nThe two following extracts show that he applied the theory of evolution\r\nto the \"whole organic kingdom\" from plants to man.\r\n\r\n\"If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow\r\nbrethren in pain, disease, death, suffering and famine--our slaves in\r\nthe most laborious works, our companions in our amusements--they may\r\npartake [of?] our origin in one common ancestor--we may be all melted\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"The different intellects of man and animals not so great as between\r\nliving things without thought (plants), and living things with thought\r\n(animals).\"\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are again concerned with an a priori view of\r\nthe probability of the origin of species by descent [\"propagation,\" he\r\ncalled it.].\r\n\r\n\"The tree of life should perhaps be called the coral of life, base of\r\nbranches dead; so that passages cannot be seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"There never may have been grade between pig and tapir, yet from some\r\ncommon progenitor. Now if the intermediate ranks had produced infinite\r\nspecies, probably the series would have been more perfect.\"\r\n\r\nAt another place, speaking of intermediate forms he says:--\r\n\r\n\"Cuvier objects to propagation of species by saying, why have not some\r\nintermediate forms been discovered between Palaeotherium, Megalonyx,\r\nMastodon, and the species now living? Now according to my view (in\r\nS. America) parent of all Armadilloes might be brother to\r\nMegatherium--uncle now dead.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking elsewhere of intermediate forms, he remarks:--\r\n\r\n\"Opponents will say--'show them me.' I will answer yes, if you will show\r\nme every step between bulldog and greyhound.\"\r\n\r\nHere we see that the case of domestic animals was already present in his\r\nmind as bearing on the production of natural species. The disappearance\r\nof intermediate forms naturally leads up to the subject of extinction,\r\nwith which the next extract begins.\r\n\r\n\"It is a wonderful fact, horse, elephant, and mastodon, dying out about\r\nsame time in such different quarters.\r\n\r\n\"Will Mr. Lyell say that some [same?] circumstance killed it over a\r\ntract from Spain to South America?--(Never).\r\n\r\n\"They die, without they change, like golden pippins; it is a GENERATION\r\nOF SPECIES like generation OF INDIVIDUALS.\r\n\r\n\"Why does individual die? To perpetuate certain peculiarities (therefore\r\nadaptation), and obliterate accidental varieties, and to accommodate\r\nitself to change (for, of course, change, even in varieties, is\r\naccommodation). Now this argument applies to species.\r\n\r\n\"If individual cannot propagate he has no issue--so with species.\r\n\r\n\"If SPECIES generate other SPECIES, their race is not utterly cut off:--\r\nlike golden pippins, if produced by seed, go on--otherwise all die.\r\n\r\n\"The fossil horse generated, in South Africa, zebra--and\r\ncontinued--perished in America.\r\n\r\n\"All animals of same species are bound together just like buds of\r\nplants, which die at one time, though produced either sooner or later.\r\nProve animals like plants--trace gradation between associated and\r\nnon-associated animals--and the story will be complete.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have the view already alluded to of a term of life impressed on\r\na species.\r\n\r\nBut in the following note we get extinction connected with unfavourable\r\nvariation, and thus a hint is given of natural selection:\r\n\r\n\"With respect to extinction, we can easily see that [a] variety of [the]\r\nostrich (Petise), may not be well adapted, and thus perish out; or, on\r\nthe other hand, like Orpheus [a Galapagos bird], being favourable, many\r\nmight be produced. This requires [the] principle that the permanent\r\nvariations produced by confined breeding and changing circumstances are\r\ncontinued and produced according to the adaptation of such circumstance,\r\nand therefore that death of species is a consequence (contrary to what\r\nwould appear from America) of non-adaptation of circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nThe first part of the next extract has a similar bearing. The end of the\r\npassage is of much interest, as showing that he had at this early date\r\nvisions of the far-reaching character of the theory of evolution:--\r\n\r\n\"With belief of transmutation and geographical grouping, we are lead to\r\nendeavour to discover CAUSES of change; the manner of adaptation (wish\r\nof parents??), instinct and structure becomes full of speculation and\r\nlines of observation. View of generation being condensation (I imagine\r\nhim to mean that each generation is \"condensed\" to a small number of\r\nthe best organized individuals.) test of highest organisation\r\nintelligible...My theory would give zest to recent and fossil\r\ncomparative anatomy; it would lead to the study of instincts, heredity,\r\nand mind-heredity, whole [of] metaphysics.\r\n\r\n\"It would lead to closest examination of hybridity and generation,\r\ncauses of change in order to know what we have come from and to what we\r\ntend--to what circumstances favour crossing and what prevents it--this,\r\nand direct examination of direct passages of structure in species, might\r\nlead to laws of change, which would then be [the] main object of study,\r\nto guide our speculations.\"\r\n\r\nThe following two extracts have a similar interest; the second is\r\nespecially interesting, as it contains the germ of concluding sentence\r\nof the 'Origin of Species': ('Origin of Species' (1st edition), page\r\n490:-- \"There is a grandeur in this view of life, with its several\r\npowers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one;\r\nand that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed\r\nlaw of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful\r\nand most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.\")--\r\n\r\n\"Before the attraction of gravity discovered it might have been said it\r\nwas as great a difficulty to account for the movement of all [planets]\r\nby one law, as to account for each separate one; so to say that all\r\nmammalia were born from one stock, and since distributed by such means\r\nas we can recognise, may be thought to explain nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Astronomers might formerly have said that God fore-ordered each planet\r\nto move in its particular destiny. In the same manner God orders each\r\nanimal created with certain forms in certain countries, but how much\r\nmore simple and sublime [a] power--let attraction act according to\r\ncertain law, such are inevitable consequences--let animals be created,\r\nthen by the fixed laws of generation, such will be their successors.\r\n\r\n\"Let the powers of transportal be such, and so will be the forms of one\r\ncountry to another--let geological changes go at such a rate, so will be\r\nthe number and distribution of the species!!\"\r\n\r\nThe three next extracts are of miscellaneous interest:--\r\n\r\n\"When one sees nipple on man's breast, one does not say some use, but\r\nsex not having been determined--so with useless wings under elytra of\r\nbeetles--born from beetles with wings, and modified--if simple creation\r\nmerely, would have been born without them.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a decreasing population at any one moment fewer closely related\r\n(few species of genera); ultimately few genera (for otherwise the\r\nrelationship would converge sooner), and lastly, perhaps, some one\r\nsingle one. Will not this account for the odd genera with few species\r\nwhich stand between great groups, which we are bound to consider the\r\nincreasing ones?\"\r\n\r\nThe last extract which I shall quote gives the germ of his theory of\r\nthe relation between alpine plants in various parts of the world, in the\r\npublication of which he was forestalled by E. Forbes (see volume i.\r\npage 72). He says, in the 1837 note-book, that alpine plants, \"formerly\r\ndescended lower, therefore [they are] species of lower genera altered,\r\nor northern plants.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the Sketch of his theory, written in 1844 (still\r\ntherefore before the second edition of the 'Journal' was completed), we\r\nfind an enormous advance made on the note-book of 1837. The Sketch is\r\nan fact a surprisingly complete presentation of the argument afterwards\r\nfamiliar to us in the 'Origin of Species.' There is some obscurity as to\r\nthe date of the short Sketch which formed the basis of the 1844 Essay.\r\nWe know from his own words (volume i., page 68), that it was in June\r\n1842 that he first wrote out a short sketch of his views. (This version\r\nI cannot find, and it was probably destroyed, like so much of his MS.,\r\nafter it had been enlarged and re-copied in 1844.) This statement is\r\ngiven with so much circumstance that it is almost impossible to suppose\r\nthat it contains an error of date. It agrees also with the following\r\nextract from his Diary.\r\n\r\n1842. May 18th. Went to Maer.\r\n\r\n\"June 15th to Shrewsbury, and on 18th to Capel Curig. During my stay at\r\nMaer and Shrewsbury (five years after commencement) wrote pencil-sketch\r\nof species theory.\"\r\n\r\nAgain in the introduction to the 'Origin,' page 1, he writes, \"after\r\nan interval of five years' work\" [from 1837, i.e. in 1842], \"I allowed\r\nmyself to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless in the letter signed by Sir C. Lyell and Sir J.D. Hooker,\r\nwhich serves as an introduction to the joint paper of Messrs. C. Darwin\r\nand A. Wallace on the 'Tendency of Species to form Varieties,' ('Linn.\r\nSoc. Journal,' 1858, page 45.) the essay of 1844 (extracts from which\r\nform part of the paper) is said to have been \"sketched in 1839, and\r\ncopied in 1844.\" This statement is obviously made on the authority of\r\na note written in my father's hand across the Table of Contents of the\r\n1844 Essay. It is to the following effect: \"This was sketched in 1839,\r\nand copied out in full, as here written and read by you in 1844.\" I\r\nconclude that this note was added in 1858, when the MS. was sent to Sir\r\nJ.D. Hooker (see Letter of June 29, 1858, page 476). There is also some\r\nfurther evidence on this side of the question. Writing to Mr. Wallace\r\n(January 25, 1859) my father says:-- \"Every one whom I have seen\r\nhas thought your paper very well written and interesting. It puts my\r\nextracts (written in 1839, now just twenty years ago!), which I must say\r\nin apology were never for an instant intended for publication; into the\r\nshade.\" The statement that the earliest sketch was written in 1839 has\r\nbeen frequently made in biographical notices of my father, no doubt\r\non the authority of the 'Linnean Journal,' but it must, I think, be\r\nconsidered as erroneous. The error may possibly have arisen in this way.\r\nIn writing on the Table of Contents of the 1844 MS. that it was sketched\r\nin 1839, I think my father may have intended to imply that the framework\r\nof the theory was clearly thought out by him at that date. In the\r\nAutobiography he speaks of the time, \"about 1839, when the theory was\r\nclearly conceived,\" meaning, no doubt, the end of 1838 and beginning of\r\n1839, when the reading of Malthus had given him the key to the idea of\r\nnatural selection. But this explanation does not apply to the letter to\r\nMr. Wallace; and with regard to the passage (My father certainly saw the\r\nproofs of the paper, for he added a foot-note apologising for the style\r\nof the extracts, on the ground that the \"work was never intended for\r\npublication.\") in the 'Linnean Journal' it is difficult to understand\r\nhow it should have been allowed to remain as it now stands, conveying,\r\nas it clearly does, the impression that 1839 was the date of his\r\nearliest written sketch.\r\n\r\nThe sketch of 1844 is written in a clerk's hand, in two hundred and\r\nthirty-one pages folio, blank leaves being alternated with the MS.\r\nwith a view to amplification. The text has been revised and corrected,\r\ncriticisms being pencilled by himself on the margin. It is divided into\r\ntwo parts: I. \"On the variation of Organic Beings under Domestication\r\nand in their Natural State.\" II. \"On the Evidence favourable and opposed\r\nto the view that Species are naturally formed races descended from\r\ncommon Stocks.\" The first part contains the main argument of the 'Origin\r\nof Species.' It is founded, as is the argument of that work, on the\r\nstudy of domestic animals, and both the Sketch and the 'Origin' open\r\nwith a chapter on variation under domestication and on artificial\r\nselection. This is followed, in both essays, by discussions on variation\r\nunder nature, on natural selection, and on the struggle for life. Here,\r\nany close resemblance between the two essays with regard to arrangement\r\nceases. Chapter III. of the Sketch, which concludes the first part,\r\ntreats of the variations which occur in the instincts and habits of\r\nanimals, and thus corresponds to some extent with Chapter VII. of the\r\n'Origin' (1st edition). It thus forms a complement to the chapters which\r\ndeal with variation in structure. It seems to have been placed thus\r\nearly in the Essay to prevent the hasty rejection of the whole theory by\r\na reader to whom the idea of natural selection acting on instincts might\r\nseem impossible. This is the more probable, as the Chapter on Instinct\r\nin the 'Origin' is specially mentioned (Introduction, page 5) as one of\r\nthe \"most apparent and gravest difficulties on the theory.\" Moreover the\r\nchapter in the Sketch ends with a discussion, \"whether any particular\r\ncorporeal structures...are so wonderful as to justify the rejection\r\nprima facie of our theory.\" Under this heading comes the discussion\r\nof the eye, which in the 'Origin' finds its place in Chapter VI. under\r\n\"Difficulties of the Theory.\" The second part seems to have been planned\r\nin accordance with his favourite point of view with regard to his\r\ntheory. This is briefly given in a letter to Dr. Asa Gray, November\r\n11th, 1859: \"I cannot possibly believe that a false theory would explain\r\nso many classes of facts, as I think it certainly does explain. On these\r\ngrounds I drop my anchor, and believe that the difficulties will slowly\r\ndisappear.\" On this principle, having stated the theory in the first\r\npart, he proceeds to show to what extent various wide series of facts\r\ncan be explained by its means.\r\n\r\nThus the second part of the Sketch corresponds roughly to the nine\r\nconcluding Chapters of the First Edition of the 'Origin.' But we must\r\nexclude Chapter VII. ('Origin') on Instinct, which forms a chapter in\r\nthe first part of the Sketch, and Chapter VIII. ('Origin') on Hybridism,\r\na subject treated in the Sketch with 'Variation under Nature' in the\r\nfirst part.\r\n\r\nThe following list of the chapters of the second part of the Sketch will\r\nillustrate their correspondence with the final chapters of the 'Origin.'\r\n\r\nChapter I. \"On the kind of intermediateness necessary, and the number\r\nof such intermediate forms.\" This includes a geological discussion, and\r\ncorresponds to parts of Chapters VI. and IX. of the 'Origin.'\r\n\r\nChapter II. \"The gradual appearance and disappearance of organic\r\nbeings.\" Corresponds to Chapter X. of the 'Origin.'\r\n\r\nChapter III. \"Geographical Distribution.\" Corresponds to Chapters XI.\r\nand XII. of the 'Origin.'\r\n\r\nChapter IV. \"Affinities and Classification of Organic beings.\"\r\n\r\nChapter V. \"Unity of Type,\" Morphology, Embryology.\r\n\r\nChapter VI. Rudimentary Organs.\r\n\r\nThese three chapters correspond to Chapter XII. of the 'Origin.'\r\n\r\nChapter VII. Recapitulation and Conclusion. The final sentence of the\r\nSketch, which we saw in its first rough form in the Note Book of 1837,\r\nclosely resembles the final sentence of the 'Origin,' much of it being\r\nidentical. The 'Origin' is not divided into two \"Parts,\" but we see\r\ntraces of such a division having been present in the writer's mind, in\r\nthis resemblance between the second part of the Sketch and the final\r\nchapters of the 'Origin.' That he should speak ('Origin,' Introduction,\r\npage 5.) of the chapters on transition, on instinct, on hybridism, and\r\non the geological record, as forming a group, may be due to the division\r\nof his early MS. into two parts.\r\n\r\nMr. Huxley, who was good enough to read the Sketch at my request, while\r\nremarking that the \"main lines of argument,\" and the illustrations\r\nemployed are the same, points out that in the 1844 Essay, \"much more\r\nweight is attached to the influence of external conditions in producing\r\nvariation, and to the inheritance of acquired habits than in the\r\nOrigin.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is extremely interesting to find in the Sketch the first mention of\r\nprinciples familiar to us in the 'Origin of Species.' Foremost among\r\nthese may be mentioned the principle of Sexual Selection, which\r\nis clearly enunciated. The important form of selection known as\r\n\"unconscious,\" is also given. Here also occurs a statement of the\r\nlaw that peculiarities tend to appear in the offspring at an age\r\ncorresponding to that at which they occurred in the parent.\r\n\r\nProfessor Newton, who was so kind as to look through the 1844\r\nSketch, tells me that my father's remarks on the migration of\r\nbirds, incidentally given in more than one passage, show that he had\r\nanticipated the views of some later writers.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the general style of the Sketch, it is not to be expected\r\nthat it should have all the characteristics of the 'Origin,' and we\r\ndo not, in fact, find that balance and control, that concentration and\r\ngrasp, which are so striking in the work of 1859.\r\n\r\nIn the Autobiography (page 68, volume 1) my father has stated what\r\nseemed to him the chief flaw of the 1844 Sketch; he had overlooked\r\n\"one problem of great importance,\" the problem of the divergence of\r\ncharacter. This point is discussed in the 'Origin of Species,' but, as\r\nit may not be familiar to all readers, I will give a short account\r\nof the difficulty and its solution. The author begins by stating that\r\nvarieties differ from each other less than species, and then goes on:\r\n\"Nevertheless, according to my view, varieties are species in process of\r\nformation...How then does the lesser difference between varieties become\r\naugmented into the greater difference between species?\" ('Origin,' 1st\r\nedition, page 111.) He shows how an analogous divergence takes place\r\nunder domestication where an originally uniform stock of horses has\r\nbeen split up into race-horses, dray-horses, etc., and then goes on to\r\nexplain how the same principle applies to natural species. \"From the\r\nsimple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any\r\none species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much\r\nwill they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified\r\nplaces in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in\r\nnumbers.\"\r\n\r\nThe principle is exemplified by the fact that if on one plot of ground\r\na single variety of wheat be sown, and on to another a mixture of\r\nvarieties, in the latter case the produce is greater. More individuals\r\nhave been able to exist because they were not all of the same variety.\r\nAn organism becomes more perfect and more fitted to survive when by\r\ndivision of labour the different functions of life are performed by\r\ndifferent organs. In the same way a species becomes more efficient\r\nand more able to survive when different sections of the species become\r\ndifferentiated so as to fill different stations.\r\n\r\nIn reading the Sketch of 1844, I have found it difficult to recognise\r\nthe absence of any definite statement of the principle of divergence as\r\na flaw in the Essay. Descent with modification implies divergence,\r\nand we become so habituated to a belief in descent, and therefore in\r\ndivergence, that we do not notice the absence of proof that divergence\r\nis in itself an advantage. As shown in the Autobiography, my father in\r\n1876 found it hardly credible that he should have overlooked the problem\r\nand its solution.\r\n\r\nThe following letter will be more in place here than its chronological\r\nposition, since it shows what was my father's feeling as to the value of\r\nthe Sketch at the time of its completion.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MRS. DARWIN. Down, July 5, 1844.\r\n\r\nI have just finished my sketch of my species theory. If, as I believe,\r\nmy theory in time be accepted even by one competent judge, it will be a\r\nconsiderable step in science.\r\n\r\nI therefore write this in case of my sudden death, as my most solemn and\r\nlast request, which I am sure you will consider the same as if legally\r\nentered in my will, that you will devote 400 pounds to its publication,\r\nand further, will yourself, or through Hensleigh (Mr. H. Wedgwood.),\r\ntake trouble in promoting it. I wish that my sketch be given to some\r\ncompetent person, with this sum to induce him to take trouble in its\r\nimprovement and enlargement. I give to him all my books on Natural\r\nHistory, which are either scored or have references at the end to the\r\npages, begging him carefully to look over and consider such passages as\r\nactually bearing, or by possibility bearing, on this subject. I wish you\r\nto make a list of all such books as some temptation to an editor. I\r\nalso request that you will hand over [to] him all those scraps roughly\r\ndivided in eight or ten brown paper portfolios. The scraps, with copied\r\nquotations from various works, are those which may aid my editor. I also\r\nrequest that you, or some amanuensis, will aid in deciphering any of\r\nthe scraps which the editor may think possibly of use. I leave to the\r\neditor's judgment whether to interpolate these facts in the text, or\r\nas notes, or under appendices. As the looking over the references and\r\nscraps will be a long labour, and as the CORRECTING and enlarging and\r\naltering my sketch will also take considerable time, I leave this sum\r\nof 400 pounds as some remuneration, and any profits from the work. I\r\nconsider that for this the editor is bound to get the sketch published\r\neither at a publisher's or his own risk. Many of the scrap in the\r\nportfolios contains mere rude suggestions and early views, now useless,\r\nand many of the facts will probably turn out as having no bearing on my\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nWith respect to editors, Mr. Lyell would be the best if he would\r\nundertake it; I believe he would find the work pleasant, and he would\r\nlearn some facts new to him. As the editor must be a geologist as well\r\nas a naturalist, the next best editor would be Professor Forbes of\r\nLondon. The next best (and quite best in many respects) would be\r\nProfessor Henslow. Dr. Hooker would be VERY good. The next, Mr.\r\nStrickland. (After Mr. Strickland's name comes the following sentence,\r\nwhich has been erased but remained legible. \"Professor Owen would be\r\nvery good; but I presume he would not undertake such a work.\" If none of\r\nthese would undertake it, I would request you to consult with Mr. Lyell,\r\nor some other capable man for some editor, a geologist and naturalist.\r\nShould one other hundred pounds make the difference of procuring a good\r\neditor, request earnestly that you will raise 500 pounds.)\r\n\r\nMy remaining collections in Natural History may be given to any one or\r\nany museum where it would be accepted...\r\n\r\n[The following note seems to have formed part of the original letter,\r\nbut may have been of later date:\r\n\r\n\"Lyell, especially with the aid of Hooker (and of any good zoological\r\naid), would be best of all. Without an editor will pledge himself to\r\ngive up time to it, it would be of no use paying such a sum.\r\n\r\n\"If there should be any difficulty in getting an editor who would go\r\nthoroughly into the subject, and think of the bearing of the passages\r\nmarked in the books and copied out of scraps of paper, then let my\r\nsketch be published as it is, stating that it was done several years ago\r\n(The words \"several years ago and,\" seem to have been added at a\r\nlater date.) and from memory without consulting any works, and with no\r\nintention of publication in its present form.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea that the Sketch of 1844 might remain, in the event of his\r\ndeath, as the only record of his work, seems to have been long in his\r\nmind, for in August 1854, when he had finished with the Cirripedes, and\r\nwas thinking of beginning his \"species work,\" he added on the back of\r\nthe above letter, \"Hooker by far best man to edit my species volume.\r\nAugust 1854.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.XI. -- THE GROWTH OF THE 'ORIGIN OF SPECIES.'\r\n\r\nLETTERS, 1843-1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The history of my father's life is told more completely in his\r\ncorrespondence with Sir J.D. Hooker than in any other series of letters;\r\nand this is especially true of the history of the growth of the 'Origin\r\nof Species.' This, therefore, seems an appropriate place for the\r\nfollowing notes, which Sir Joseph Hooker has kindly given me. They\r\ngive, moreover, an interesting picture of his early friendship with my\r\nfather:--\r\n\r\n\"My first meeting with Mr. Darwin was in 1839, in Trafalgar Square. I\r\nwas walking with an officer who had been his shipmate for a short time\r\nin the \"Beagle\" seven years before, but who had not, I believe, since\r\nmet him. I was introduced; the interview was of course brief, and the\r\nmemory of him that I carried away and still retain was that of a rather\r\ntall and rather broad-shouldered man, with a slight stoop, an agreeable\r\nand animated expression when talking, beetle brows, and a hollow\r\nbut mellow voice; and that his greeting of his old acquaintance was\r\nsailor-like--that is, delightfully frank and cordial. I observed him\r\nwell, for I was already aware of his attainments and labours, derived\r\nfrom having read various proof-sheets of his then unpublished 'Journal.'\r\nThese had been submitted to Mr. (afterwards Sir Charles) Lyell by Mr.\r\nDarwin, and by him sent to his father, Ch. Lyell, Esq., of Kinnordy, who\r\n(being a very old friend of my father and taking a kind interest in my\r\nprojected career as a naturalist) had allowed me to peruse them. At\r\nthis time I was hurrying on my studies, so as to take my degree before\r\nvolunteering to accompany Sir James Ross in the Antarctic Expedition,\r\nwhich had just been determined on by the Admiralty; and so pressed for\r\ntime was I, that I used to sleep with the sheets of the 'Journal'\r\nunder my pillow, that I might read them between waking and rising. They\r\nimpressed me profoundly, I might say despairingly, with the variety of\r\nacquirements, mental and physical, required in a naturalist who should\r\nfollow in Darwin's footsteps, whilst they stimulated me to enthusiasm in\r\nthe desire to travel and observe.\r\n\r\n\"It has been a permanent source of happiness to me that I knew so much\r\nof Mr. Darwin's scientific work so many years before that intimacy began\r\nwhich ripened into feelings as near to those of reverence for his life,\r\nworks, and character as is reasonable and proper. It only remains to\r\nadd to this little episode that I received a copy of the 'Journal'\r\ncomplete,--a gift from Mr. Lyell,--a few days before leaving England.\r\n\r\n\"Very soon after the return of the Antarctic Expedition my\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. Darwin began (December, 1843) by his sending me\r\na long letter, warmly congratulating me on my return to my family\r\nand friends, and expressing a wish to hear more of the results of the\r\nexpedition, of which he had derived some knowledge from private letters\r\nof my own (written to or communicated through Mr. Lyell). Then, plunging\r\nat once into scientific matters, he directed my attention to the\r\nimportance of correlating the Fuegian Flora with that of the Cordillera\r\nand of Europe, and invited me to study the botanical collections which\r\nhe had made in the Galapagos Islands, as well as his Patagonian and\r\nFuegian plants.\r\n\r\n\"This led to me sending him an outline of the conclusions I had formed\r\nregarding the distribution of plants in the southern regions, and the\r\nnecessity of assuming the destruction of considerable areas of land\r\nto account for the relations of the flora of the so-called Antarctic\r\nIslands. I do not suppose that any of these ideas were new to him, but\r\nthey led to an animated and lengthy correspondence full of instruction.\"\r\n\r\nHere follows the letter (1843) to Sir J.D. Hooker above referred to.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI had hoped before this time to have had the pleasure of seeing you\r\nand congratulating you on your safe return from your long and glorious\r\nvoyage. But as I seldom go to London, we may not yet meet for some\r\ntime--without you are led to attend the Geological Meetings.\r\n\r\nI am anxious to know what you intend doing with all your materials--I\r\nhad so much pleasure in reading parts of some of your letters, that I\r\nshall be very sorry if I, as one of the public, have no opportunity of\r\nreading a good deal more. I suppose you are very busy now and full of\r\nenjoyment: how well I remember the happiness of my first few months of\r\nEngland--it was worth all the discomforts of many a gale! But I have run\r\nfrom the subject, which made me write, of expressing my pleasure that\r\nHenslow (as he informed me a few days since by letter) has sent to you\r\nmy small collection of plants. You cannot think how much pleased I am,\r\nas I feared they would have been all lost, and few as they are, they\r\ncost me a good deal of trouble. There are a very few notes, which I\r\nbelieve Henslow has got, describing the habitats, etc., of some few of\r\nthe more remarkable plants. I paid particular attention to the Alpine\r\nflowers of Tierra del Fuego, and I am sure I got every plant which was\r\nin flower in Patagonia at the seasons when we were there. I have long\r\nthought that some general sketch of the Flora of the point of land,\r\nstretching so far into the southern seas, would be very curious. Do make\r\ncomparative remarks on the species allied to the European species, for\r\nthe advantage of botanical ignoramuses like myself. It has often struck\r\nme as a curious point to find out, whether there are many European\r\ngenera in Tierra del Fuego which are not found along the ridge of the\r\nCordillera; the separation in such case would be so enormous. Do\r\npoint out in any sketch you draw up, what genera are American and what\r\nEuropean, and how great the differences of the species are, when the\r\ngenera are European, for the sake of the ignoramuses.\r\n\r\nI hope Henslow will send you my Galapagos plants (about which Humboldt\r\neven expressed to me considerable curiosity)--I took much pains in\r\ncollecting all I could. A Flora of this archipelago would, I suspect,\r\noffer a nearly parallel case to that of St. Helena, which has so long\r\nexcited interest. Pray excuse this long rambling note, and believe me,\r\nmy dear sir, yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nWill you be so good as to present my respectful compliments to Sir W.\r\nHooker.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Referring to Sir J.D. Hooker's work on the Galapagos Flora, my father\r\nwrote in 1846:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you how delighted and astonished I am at the results\r\nof your examination; how wonderfully they support my assertion on the\r\ndifferences in the animals of the different islands, about which I have\r\nalways been fearful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain he wrote (1849):--\r\n\r\n\"I received a few weeks ago your Galapagos papers (These papers include\r\nthe results of Sir J.D. Hooker's examination of my father's Galapagos\r\nplants, and were published by the Linnean Society in 1849.), and I have\r\nread them since being here. I really cannot express too strongly my\r\nadmiration of the geographical discussion: to my judgment it is a\r\nperfect model of what such a paper should be; it took me four days to\r\nread and think over. How interesting the Flora of the Sandwich Islands\r\nappears to be, how I wish there were materials for you to treat its\r\nflora as you have done the Galapagos. In the Systematic paper I was\r\nrather disappointed in not finding general remarks on affinities,\r\nstructures, etc., such as you often give in conversation, and such as\r\nDe Candolle and St. Hilaire introduced in almost all their papers, and\r\nwhich make them interesting even to a non-Botanist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very soon afterwards [continues Sir J.D. Hooker] in a letter dated\r\nJanuary 1844, the subject of the 'Origin of Species' was brought forward\r\nby him, and I believe that I was the first to whom he communicated\r\nhis then new ideas on the subject, and which being of interest as\r\na contribution to the history of Evolution, I here copy from his\r\nletter\":--]\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [January 11th, 1844.]\r\n\r\nBesides a general interest about the southern lands, I have been now\r\never since my return engaged in a very presumptuous work, and I know\r\nno one individual who would not say a very foolish one. I was so struck\r\nwith the distribution of the Galapagos organisms, etc. etc., and with\r\nthe character of the American fossil mammifers, etc. etc., that I\r\ndetermined to collect blindly every sort of fact, which could bear\r\nany way on what are species. I have read heaps of agricultural and\r\nhorticultural books, and have never ceased collecting facts. At last\r\ngleams of light have come, and I am almost convinced (quite contrary to\r\nthe opinion I started with) that species are not (it is like confessing\r\na murder) immutable. Heaven forfend me from Lamarck nonsense of a\r\n\"tendency to progression,\" \"adaptations from the slow willing of\r\nanimals,\" etc.! But the conclusions I am led to are not widely different\r\nfrom his; though the means of change are wholly so. I think I have\r\nfound out (here's presumption!) the simple way by which species become\r\nexquisitely adapted to various ends. You will now groan, and think to\r\nyourself, \"on what a man have I been wasting my time and writing to.\" I\r\nshould, five years ago, have thought so...\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter written on February 23, 1844, shows that the\r\nacquaintanceship with Sir J.D. Hooker was then fast ripening into\r\nfriendship. The letter is chiefly of interest as showing the sort of\r\nproblems then occupying my father's mind:]\r\n\r\nDear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI hope you will excuse the freedom of my address, but I feel that as\r\nco-circum-wanderers and as fellow labourers (though myself a very weak\r\none) we may throw aside some of the old-world formality...I have just\r\nfinished a little volume on the volcanic islands which we visited. I do\r\nnot know how far you care for dry simple geology, but I hope you will\r\nlet me send you a copy. I suppose I can send it from London by common\r\ncoach conveyance.\r\n\r\n...I am going to ask you some MORE questions, though I daresay, without\r\nasking them, I shall see answers in your work, when published, which\r\nwill be quite time enough for my purposes. First for the Galapagos, you\r\nwill see in my Journal, that the Birds, though peculiar species, have a\r\nmost obvious S. American aspect: I have just ascertained the same thing\r\nholds good with the sea-shells. It is so with those plants which are\r\npeculiar to this archipelago; you state that their numerical proportions\r\nare continental (is not this a very curious fact?) but are they related\r\nin forms to S. America. Do you know of any other case of an archipelago,\r\nwith the separate islands possessing distinct representative species?\r\nI have always intended (but have not yet done so) to examine Webb\r\nand Berthelot on the Canary Islands for this object. Talking with\r\nMr. Bentham, he told me that the separate islands of the Sandwich\r\nArchipelago possessed distinct representative species of the same genera\r\nof Labiatae: would not this be worth your enquiry? How is it with the\r\nAzores; to be sure the heavy western gales would tend to diffuse the\r\nsame species over that group.\r\n\r\nI hope you will (I dare say my hope is quite superfluous) attend to this\r\ngeneral kind of affinity in isolated islands, though I suppose it is\r\nmore difficult to perceive this sort of relation in plants, than in\r\nbirds or quadrupeds, the groups of which are, I fancy, rather more\r\nconfined. Can St. Helena be classed, though remotely, either with Africa\r\nor S. America? From some facts, which I have collected, I have been led\r\nto conclude that the fauna of mountains are EITHER remarkably similar\r\n(sometimes in the presence of the same species and at other times\r\nof same genera), OR that they are remarkably dissimilar; and it has\r\noccurred to me that possibly part of this peculiarity of the St. Helena\r\nand Galapagos floras may be attributed to a great part of these two\r\nFloras being mountain Floras. I fear my notes will hardly serve to\r\ndistinguish much of the habitats of the Galapagos plants, but they may\r\nin some cases; most, if not all, of the green, leafy plants come from\r\nthe summits of the islands, and the thin brown leafless plants come from\r\nthe lower arid parts: would you be so kind as to bear this remark in\r\nmind, when examining my collection.\r\n\r\nI will trouble you with only one other question. In discussion with Mr.\r\nGould, I found that in most of the genera of birds which range over the\r\nwhole or greater part of the world, the individual species have wider\r\nranges, thus the Owl is mundane, and many of the species have very wide\r\nranges. So I believe it is with land and fresh-water shells--and I might\r\nadduce other cases. Is it not so with Cryptogamic plants; have not most\r\nof the species wide ranges, in those genera which are mundane? I do not\r\nsuppose that the converse holds, viz.--that when a species has a\r\nwide range, its genus also ranges wide. Will you so far oblige me by\r\noccasionally thinking over this? It would cost me vast trouble to get a\r\nlist of mundane phanerogamic genera and then search how far the species\r\nof these genera are apt to range wide in their several countries; but\r\nyou might occasionally, in the course of your pursuits, just bear this\r\nin mind, though perhaps the point may long since have occurred to you\r\nor other Botanists. Geology is bringing to light interesting facts,\r\nconcerning the ranges of shells; I think it is pretty well established,\r\nthat according as the geographical range of a species is wide, so is\r\nits persistence and duration in time. I hope you will try to grudge as\r\nlittle as you can the trouble of my letters, and pray believe me very\r\ntruly yours,\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S. I should feel extremely obliged for your kind offer of the sketch\r\nof Humboldt; I venerate him, and after having had the pleasure of\r\nconversing with him in London, I shall still more like to have any\r\nportrait of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n[What follows is quoted from Sir J. Hooker's notes. \"The next act in the\r\ndrama of our lives opens with personal intercourse. This began with an\r\ninvitation to breakfast with him at his brother's (Erasmus Darwin's)\r\nhouse in Park Street; which was shortly afterwards followed by an\r\ninvitation to Down to meet a few brother Naturalists. In the short\r\nintervals of good health that followed the long illnesses which\r\noftentimes rendered life a burthen to him, between 1844 and 1847, I had\r\nmany such invitations, and delightful they were. A more hospitable and\r\nmore attractive home under every point of view could not be imagined--of\r\nSociety there were most often Dr. Falconer, Edward Forbes, Professor\r\nBell, and Mr. Waterhouse--there were long walks, romps with the children\r\non hands and knees, music that haunts me still. Darwin's own hearty\r\nmanner, hollow laugh, and thorough enjoyment of home life with friends;\r\nstrolls with him all together, and interviews with us one by one in\r\nhis study, to discuss questions in any branch of biological or physical\r\nknowledge that we had followed; and which I at any rate always left with\r\nthe feeling that I had imparted nothing and carried away more than\r\nI could stagger under. Latterly, as his health became more seriously\r\naffected, I was for days and weeks the only visitor, bringing my work\r\nwith me and enjoying his society as opportunity offered. It was an\r\nestablished rule that he every day pumped me, as he called it, for half\r\nan hour or so after breakfast in his study, when he first brought out\r\na heap of slips with questions botanical, geographical, etc., for me to\r\nanswer, and concluded by telling me of the progress he had made in his\r\nown work, asking my opinion on various points. I saw no more of him till\r\nabout noon, when I heard his mellow ringing voice calling my name under\r\nmy window--this was to join him in his daily forenoon walk round the\r\nsand-walk. On joining him I found him in a rough grey shooting-coat in\r\nsummer, and thick cape over his shoulders in winter, and a stout staff\r\nin his hand; away we trudged through the garden, where there was always\r\nsome experiment to visit, and on to the sand-walk, round which a fixed\r\nnumber of turns were taken, during which our conversation usually ran\r\non foreign lands and seas, old friends, old books, and things far off to\r\nboth mind and eye.\r\n\r\n\"In the afternoon there was another such walk, after which he again\r\nretired till dinner if well enough to join the family; if not, he\r\ngenerally managed to appear in the drawing-room, where seated in his\r\nhigh chair, with his feet in enormous carpet shoes, supported on a high\r\nstool--he enjoyed the music or conversation of his family.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHere follows a series of letters illustrating the growth of my father's\r\nviews, and the nature of his work during this period.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1844].\r\n\r\n...The conclusion, which I have come at is, that those areas, in which\r\nspecies are most numerous, have oftenest been divided and isolated from\r\nother areas, united and again divided; a process implying antiquity and\r\nsome changes in the external conditions. This will justly sound very\r\nhypothetical. I cannot give my reasons in detail; but the most general\r\nconclusion, which the geographical distribution of all organic beings,\r\nappears to me to indicate, is that isolation is the chief concomitant or\r\ncause of the appearance of NEW forms (I well know there are some staring\r\nexceptions). Secondly, from seeing how often the plants and animals\r\nswarm in a country, when introduced into it, and from seeing what a vast\r\nnumber of plants will live, for instance in England, if kept FREE FROM\r\nWEEDS, AND NATIVE PLANTS, I have been led to consider that the spreading\r\nand number of the organic beings of any country depend less on its\r\nexternal features, than on the number of forms, which have been there\r\noriginally created or produced. I much doubt whether you will find it\r\npossible to explain the number of forms by proportional differences of\r\nexposure; and I cannot doubt if half the species in any country were\r\ndestroyed or had not been created, yet that country would appear to us\r\nfully peopled. With respect to original creation or production of new\r\nforms, I have said that isolation appears the chief element. Hence,\r\nwith respect to terrestrial productions, a tract of country, which had\r\noftenest within the late geological periods subsided and been converted\r\ninto islands, and reunited, I should expect to contain most forms.\r\n\r\nBut such speculations are amusing only to one self, and in this case\r\nuseless, as they do not show any direct line of observation: if I had\r\nseen how hypothetical [is] the little, which I have unclearly written, I\r\nwould not have troubled you with the reading of it. Believe me,--at last\r\nnot hypothetically,\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, 1844.\r\n\r\n...I forget my last letter, but it must have been a very silly one, as\r\nit seems I gave my notion of the number of species being in great degree\r\ngoverned by the degree to which the area had been often isolated and\r\ndivided; I must have been cracked to have written it, for I have no\r\nevidence, without a person be willing to admit all my views, and then\r\nit does follow; but in my most sanguine moments, all I expect, is that\r\nI shall be able to show even to sound Naturalists, that there are two\r\nsides to the question of the immutability of species;--that facts can be\r\nviewed and grouped under the notion of allied species having descended\r\nfrom common stocks. With respect to books on this subject, I do not know\r\nof any systematical ones, except Lamarck's, which is veritable rubbish;\r\nbut there are plenty, as Lyell, Pritchard, etc., on the view of the\r\nimmutability. Agassiz lately has brought the strongest argument in\r\nfavour of immutability. Isidore G. St. Hilaire has written some good\r\nEssays, tending towards the mutability-side, in the 'Suites a Buffon,'\r\nentitled \"Zoolog. Generale.\" Is it not strange that the author, of\r\nsuch a book as the 'Animaux sans Vertebres,' should have written that\r\ninsects, which never see their eggs, should WILL (and plants, their\r\nseeds) to be of particular forms, so as to become attached to particular\r\nobjects. The other, common (specially Germanic) notion is hardly less\r\nabsurd, viz. that climate, food, etc., should make a Pediculus formed to\r\nclimb hair, or wood-pecker, to climb trees. I believe all these absurd\r\nviews arise, from no one having, as far as I know, approached the\r\nsubject on the side of variation under domestication, and having studied\r\nall that is known about domestication. I was very glad to hear your\r\ncriticism on island-floras and on non-diffusion of plants: the subject\r\nis too long for a letter: I could defend myself to some considerable\r\nextent, but I doubt whether successfully in your eyes, or indeed in my\r\nown...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [July, 1844].\r\n\r\n...I am now reading a wonderful book for facts on variation--Bronn,\r\n'Geschichte der Natur.' It is stiff German: it forestalls me, sometimes\r\nI think delightfully, and sometimes cruelly. You will be ten times\r\nhereafter more horrified at me than at H. Watson. I hate arguments from\r\nresults, but on my views of descent, really Natural History becomes\r\na sublimely grand result-giving subject (now you may quiz me for so\r\nfoolish an escape of mouth)...I must leave this letter till to-morrow,\r\nfor I am tired; but I so enjoy writing to you, that I must inflict a\r\nlittle more on you.\r\n\r\nHave you any good evidence for absence of insects in small islands? I\r\nfound thirteen species in Keeling Atoll. Flies are good fertilizers,\r\nand I have seen a microscopic Thrips and a Cecidomya take flight from\r\na flower in the direction of another with pollen adhering to them. In\r\nArctic countries a bee seems to go as far N. as any flower...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Shrewsbury [September, 1845].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI write a line to say that Cosmos (A translation of Humboldt's\r\n'Kosmos.') arrived quite safely [N.B. One sheet came loose in Part I.],\r\nand to thank you for your nice note. I have just begun the introduction,\r\nand groan over the style, which in such parts is full half the battle.\r\nHow true many of the remarks are (i.e. as far as I can understand the\r\nwretched English) on the scenery; it is an exact expression of one's own\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nI wish I ever had any books to lend you in return for the many you have\r\nlent me...\r\n\r\nAll of what you kindly say about my species work does not alter one\r\niota my long self-acknowledged presumption in accumulating facts and\r\nspeculating on the subject of variation, without having worked out my\r\ndue share of species. But now for nine years it has been anyhow the\r\ngreatest amusement to me.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my dear Hooker, I grieve more than you can well believe, over\r\nour prospect of so seldom meeting.\r\n\r\nI have never perceived but one fault in you, and that you have\r\ngrievously, viz. modesty; you form an exception to Sydney Smith's\r\naphorism, that merit and modesty have no other connection, except in\r\ntheir first letter.\r\n\r\nFarewell, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO L. JENYNS (BLOMEFIELD). Down, October 12th, [1845].\r\n\r\nMy dear Jenyns,\r\n\r\nThanks for your note. I am sorry to say I have not even the tail-end\r\nof a fact in English Zoology to communicate. I have found that even\r\ntrifling observations require, in my case, some leisure and energy, both\r\nof which ingredients I have had none to spare, as writing my Geology\r\nthoroughly expends both. I had always thought that I would keep a\r\njournal and record everything, but in the way I now live I find I\r\nobserve nothing to record. Looking after my garden and trees, and\r\noccasionally a very little walk in an idle frame of mind, fills up every\r\nafternoon in the same manner. I am surprised that with all your parish\r\naffairs, you have had time to do all that which you have done. I shall\r\nbe very glad to see your little work (Mr. Jenyns' 'Observations in\r\nNatural History.' It is prefaced by an Introduction on \"Habits of\r\nobserving as connected with the study of Natural History,\" and followed\r\nby a \"Calendar of Periodic Phenomena in Natural History,\" with \"Remarks\r\non the importance of such Registers.\" My father seems to be alluding to\r\nthis Register in the P.S. to the letter dated October 17, 1846.) (and\r\nproud should I have been if I could have added a single fact to it).\r\nMy work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with\r\nthe importance of all such works as your intended one, containing what\r\npeople are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts\r\nwhich make one understand the working or economy of nature. There is\r\none subject, on which I am very curious, and which perhaps you may throw\r\nsome light on, if you have ever thought on it; namely, what are the\r\nchecks and what the periods of life,--by which the increase of any given\r\nspecies is limited. Just calculate the increase of any bird, if you\r\nassume that only half the young are reared, and these breed: within the\r\nNATURAL (i.e., if free from accidents) life of the parents the number\r\nof individuals will become enormous, and I have been much surprised to\r\nthink how great destruction MUST annually or occasionally be falling on\r\nevery species, yet the means and period of such destruction is scarcely\r\nperceived by us.\r\n\r\nI have continued steadily reading and collecting facts on variation of\r\ndomestic animals and plants, and on the question of what are species.\r\nI have a grand body of facts, and I think I can draw some sound\r\nconclusions. The general conclusions at which I have slowly been driven\r\nfrom a directly opposite conviction, is that species are mutable, and\r\nthat allied species are co-descendants from common stocks. I know how\r\nmuch I open myself to reproach for such a conclusion, but I have at\r\nleast honestly and deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on\r\nthis subject for several years. At present I am on the Geology of\r\nSouth America. I hope to pick up from your book some facts on\r\nslight variations in structure or instincts in the animals of your\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, ever yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO L. JENYNS (REV. L. BLOMEFIELD). Down, [1845?].\r\n\r\nMy dear Jenyns,\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken in having\r\nwritten me so long a note. The question of where, when, and how\r\nthe check to the increase of a given species falls appears to me\r\nparticularly interesting, and our difficulty in answering it shows how\r\nreally ignorant we are of the lives and habits of our most familiar\r\nspecies. I was aware of the bare fact of old birds driving away their\r\nyoung, but had never thought of the effect you so clearly point out, of\r\nlocal gaps in number being thus immediately filled up. But the original\r\ndifficulty remains; for if your farmers had not killed your sparrows\r\nand rooks, what would have become of those which now immigrate into your\r\nparish? in the middle of England one is too far distant from the natural\r\nlimits of the rook and sparrow to suppose that the young are thus far\r\nexpelled from Cambridgeshire. The check must fall heavily at some time\r\nof each species' life; for, if one calculates that only half the progeny\r\nare reared and bred, how enormous is the increase! One has, however, no\r\nbusiness to feel so much surprise at one's ignorance, when one knows how\r\nimpossible it is without statistics to conjecture the duration of life\r\nand percentage of deaths to births in mankind. If it could be shown that\r\napparently the birds of passage WHICH BREED HERE and increase, return in\r\nthe succeeding years in about the same number, whereas those that come\r\nhere for their winter and non-breeding season annually, come here with\r\nthe same numbers, but return with greatly decreased numbers, one\r\nwould know (as indeed seems probable) that the check fell chiefly on\r\nfull-grown birds in the winter season, and not on the eggs and very\r\nyoung birds, which has appeared to me often the most probable period. If\r\nat any time any remarks on this subject should occur to you, I should be\r\nmost grateful for the benefit of them.\r\n\r\nWith respect to my far distant work on species, I must have expressed\r\nmyself with singular inaccuracy if I led you to suppose that I meant\r\nto say that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after\r\nyears of weighing puzzles, to myself ALONE; but in my wildest day-dream,\r\nI never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides to\r\nthe question of the immutability of species, i.e. whether species are\r\nDIRECTLY created or by intermediate laws (as with the life and death\r\nof individuals). I did not approach the subject on the side of the\r\ndifficulty in determining what are species and what are varieties, but\r\n(though, why I should give you such a history of my doings it would be\r\nhard to say) from such facts as the relationship between the living\r\nand extinct mammifers in South America, and between those living on the\r\nContinent and on adjoining islands, such as the Galapagos. It occured\r\nto me that a collection of all such analogous facts would throw light\r\neither for or against the view of related species being co-descendants\r\nfrom a common stock. A long searching amongst agricultural and\r\nhorticultural books and people makes me believe (I well know how\r\nabsurdly presumptuous this must appear) that I see the way in which new\r\nvarieties become exquisitely adapted to the external conditions of life\r\nand to other surrounding beings. I am a bold man to lay myself open\r\nto being thought a complete fool, and a most deliberate one. From the\r\nnature of the grounds which make me believe that species are mutable in\r\nform, these grounds cannot be restricted to the closest-allied species;\r\nbut how far they extend I cannot tell, as my reasons fall away by\r\ndegrees, when applied to species more and more remote from each other.\r\nPray do not think that I am so blind as not to see that there are\r\nnumerous immense difficulties in my notions, but they appear to me less\r\nthan on the common view. I have drawn up a sketch and had it copied (in\r\n200 pages) of my conclusions; and if I thought at some future time that\r\nyou would think it worth reading, I should, of course, be most thankful\r\nto have the criticism of so competent a critic. Excuse this very long\r\nand egotistical and ill-written letter, which by your remarks you had\r\nled me into, and believe me,\r\n\r\nYours very truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO L. JENYNS (BLOMEFIELD). Down, October 17th, 1846.\r\n\r\nDear Jenyns,\r\n\r\nI have taken a most ungrateful length of time in thanking you for your\r\nvery kind present of your 'Observations.' But I happened to have had in\r\nhand several other books, and have finished yours only a few days ago.\r\nI found it very pleasant reading, and many of your facts interested me\r\nmuch. I think I was more interested, which is odd, with your notes on\r\nsome of the lower animals than on the higher ones. The introduction\r\nstruck me as very good; but this is what I expected, for I well remember\r\nbeing quite delighted with a preliminary essay to the first number of\r\nthe 'Annals of Natural History.' I missed one discussion, and think\r\nmyself ill-used, for I remember your saying you would make some remarks\r\non the weather and barometer, as a guide for the ignorant in prediction.\r\nI had also hoped to have perhaps met with some remarks on the amount of\r\nvariation in our common species. Andrew Smith once declared he would get\r\nsome hundreds of specimens of larks and sparrows from all parts of Great\r\nBritain, and see whether, with finest measurements, he could detect any\r\nproportional variations in beaks or limbs, etc. This point interests me\r\nfrom having lately been skimming over the absurdly opposite conclusions\r\nof Gloger and Brehm; the one making half-a-dozen species out of every\r\ncommon bird, and the other turning so many reputed species into one.\r\nHave you ever done anything of this kind, or have you ever studied\r\nGloger's or Brehm's works? I was interested in your account of the\r\nmartins, for I had just before been utterly perplexed by noticing just\r\nsuch a proceeding as you describe: I counted seven, one day lately,\r\nvisiting a single nest and sticking dirt on the adjoining wall. I may\r\nmention that I once saw some squirrels eagerly splitting those little\r\nsemi-transparent spherical galls on the back of oak-leaves for the\r\nmaggot within; so that they are insectivorous. A Cychrus rostratus once\r\nsquirted into my eyes and gave me extreme pain; and I must tell you what\r\nhappened to me on the banks of the Cam, in my early entomological days:\r\nunder a piece of bark I found two Carabi (I forget which), and caught\r\none in each hand, when lo and behold I saw a sacred Panagaeus crux\r\nmajor! I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi, and to lose\r\nPanagaeus was out of the question; so that in despair I gently seized\r\none of the Carabi between my teeth, when to my unspeakable disgust and\r\npain the little inconsiderate beast squirted his acid down my throat,\r\nand I lost both Carabi and Panagaeus! I was quite astonished to hear of\r\na terrestrial Planaria; for about a year or two ago I described in the\r\n'Annals of Natural History' several beautifully coloured terrestrial\r\nspecies of the Southern Hemisphere, and thought it quite a new fact.\r\nBy the way, you speak of a sheep with a broken leg not having flukes:\r\nI have heard my father aver that a fever, or any SERIOUS ACCIDENT, as\r\na broken limb, will cause in a man all the intestinal worms to be\r\nevacuated. Might not this possibly have been the case with the flukes in\r\ntheir early state?\r\n\r\nI hope you were none the worse for Southampton (The meeting of the\r\nBritish Association.); I wish I had seen you looking rather fatter. I\r\nenjoyed my week extremely, and it did me good. I missed you the last few\r\ndays, and we never managed to see much of each other; but there were so\r\nmany people there, that I for one hardly saw anything of any one. Once\r\nagain I thank you very cordially for your kind present, and the pleasure\r\nit has given me, and believe me,\r\n\r\nEver most truly yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have quite forgotten to say how greatly interested I was with\r\nyour discussion on the statistics of animals: when will Natural History\r\nbe so perfect that such points as you discuss will be perfectly known\r\nabout any one animal?\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Malvern, June 13 [1849].\r\n\r\n...At last I am going to press with a small poor first-fruit of my\r\nconfounded Cirripedia, viz. the fossil pedunculate cirripedia. You ask\r\nwhat effect studying species has had on my variation theories; I do not\r\nthink much--I have felt some difficulties more. On the other hand,\r\nI have been struck (and probably unfairly from the class) with the\r\nvariability of every part in some slight degree of every species. When\r\nthe same organ is RIGOROUSLY compared in many individuals, I always find\r\nsome slight variability, and consequently that the diagnosis of species\r\nfrom minute differences is always dangerous. I had thought the same\r\nparts of the same species more resemble (than they do anyhow in\r\nCirripedia) objects cast in the same mould. Systematic work would be\r\neasy were it not for this confounded variation, which, however, is\r\npleasant to me as a speculatist, though odious to me as a systematist.\r\nYour remarks on the distinctness (so unpleasant to me) of the Himalayan\r\nRubi, willows, etc., compared with those of northern [Europe?], etc.,\r\nare very interesting; if my rude species-sketch had any SMALL share in\r\nleading you to these observations, it has already done good and ample\r\nservice, and may lay its bones in the earth in peace. I never heard\r\nanything so strange as Falconer's neglect of your letters; I am\r\nextremely glad you are cordial with him again, though it must have cost\r\nyou an effort. Falconer is a man one must love...May you prosper in\r\nevery way, my dear Hooker.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate friend, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Wednesday [September, n.d.].\r\n\r\n...Many thanks for your letter received yesterday, which, as always,\r\nset me thinking: I laughed at your attack at my stinginess in changes of\r\nlevel towards Forbes (Edward Forbes, 1815-1854, born in the Isle of Man.\r\nHis best known work was his Report on the distribution of marine animals\r\nat different depths in the Mediterranean. An important memoir of his\r\nis referred to in my father's 'Autobiography.' He held successively the\r\nposts of Curator to the Geological Society's Museum, and Professor of\r\nNatural History in the Museum of Practical Geology; shortly before he\r\ndied he was appointed Professor of Natural History in the University\r\nof Edinburgh. He seems to have impressed his contemporaries as a man of\r\nstrikingly versatile and vigorous mind. The above allusion to changes of\r\nlevel refers to Forbes's tendency to explain the facts of geographical\r\ndistribution by means of an active geological imagination.), being so\r\nliberal towards myself; but I must maintain, that I have never let down\r\nor upheaved our mother-earth's surface, for the sake of explaining any\r\none phenomenon, and I trust I have very seldom done so without some\r\ndistinct evidence. So I must still think it a bold step (perhaps a\r\nvery true one) to sink into the depths of ocean, within the period of\r\nexisting species, so large a tract of surface. But there is no amount or\r\nextent of change of level, which I am not fully prepared to admit, but\r\nI must say I should like better evidence, than the identity of a few\r\nplants, which POSSIBLY (I do not say probably) might have been otherwise\r\ntransported. Particular thanks for your attempt to get me a copy of\r\n'L'Espece' (Probably Godron's essay, published by the Academy of Nancy\r\nin 1848-49, and afterwards as a separate book in 1859.), and almost\r\nequal thanks for your criticisms on him: I rather misdoubted him, and\r\nfelt not much inclined to take as gospel his facts. I find this one of\r\nmy greatest difficulties with foreign authors, viz. judging of their\r\ncredibility. How painfully (to me) true is your remark, that no one has\r\nhardly a right to examine the question of species who has not minutely\r\ndescribed many. I was, however, pleased to hear from Owen (who is\r\nvehemently opposed to any mutability in species), that he thought it was\r\na very fair subject, and that there was a mass of facts to be brought to\r\nbear on the question, not hitherto collected. My only comfort is (as I\r\nmean to attempt the subject), that I have dabbled in several branches\r\nof Natural History, and seen good specific men work out my species, and\r\nknow something of geology (an indispensable union); and though I shall\r\nget more kicks than half-pennies, I will, life serving, attempt my\r\nwork. Lamarck is the only exception, that I can think of, of an accurate\r\ndescriber of species at least in the Invertebrate Kingdom, who has\r\ndisbelieved in permanent species, but he in his absurd though clever\r\nwork has done the subject harm, as has Mr. Vestiges, and, as (some\r\nfuture loose naturalist attempting the same speculations will perhaps\r\nsay) has Mr. D...\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, September 25th [1853].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have read your paper with great interest; it seems all very clear, and\r\nwill form an admirable introduction to the New Zealand Flora, or to any\r\nFlora in the world. How few generalizers there are among systematists;\r\nI really suspect there is something absolutely opposed to each other\r\nand hostile in the two frames of mind required for systematising and\r\nreasoning on large collections of facts. Many of your arguments appear\r\nto me very well put, and, as far as my experience goes, the candid\r\nway in which you discuss the subject is unique. The whole will be very\r\nuseful to me whenever I undertake my volume, though parts take the wind\r\nvery completely out of my sails; it will be all nuts to me...for I have\r\nfor some time determined to give the arguments on BOTH sides (as far as\r\nI could), instead of arguing on the mutability side alone.\r\n\r\nIn my own Cirripedial work (by the way, thank you for the dose of soft\r\nsolder; it does one--or at least me--a great deal of good)--in my own\r\nwork I have not felt conscious that disbelieving in the mere PERMANENCE\r\nof species has made much difference one way or the other; in some few\r\ncases (if publishing avowedly on doctrine of non-permanence), I should\r\nNOT have affixed names, and in some few cases should have affixed\r\nnames to remarkable varieties. Certainly I have felt it humiliating,\r\ndiscussing and doubting, and examining over and over again, when in\r\nmy own mind the only doubt has been whether the form varied TO-DAY OR\r\nYESTERDAY (not to put too fine a point on it, as Snagsby (In 'Bleak\r\nHouse.') would say). After describing a set of forms as distinct\r\nspecies, tearing up my MS., and making them one species, tearing that\r\nup and making them separate, and then making them one again (which has\r\nhappened to me), I have gnashed my teeth, cursed species, and asked what\r\nsin I had committed to be so punished. But I must confess that perhaps\r\nnearly the same thing would have happened to me on any scheme of work.\r\n\r\nI am heartily glad to hear your Journal (Sir J.D. Hooker's 'Himalayan\r\nJournal.') is so much advanced; how magnificently it seems to be\r\nillustrated! An \"Oriental Naturalist,\" with lots of imagination and not\r\ntoo much regard to facts, is just the man to discuss species! I think\r\nyour title of 'A Journal of a Naturalist in the East' very good; but\r\nwhether \"in the Himalaya\" would not be better, I have doubted, for the\r\nEast sounds rather vague...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [1853].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have no remarks at all worth sending you, nor, indeed, was it likely\r\nthat I should, considering how perfect and elaborated an essay it is.\r\n('New Zealand Flora,' 1853.) As far as my judgment goes, it is the most\r\nimportant discussion on the points in question ever published. I can say\r\nno more. I agree with almost everything you say; but I require much time\r\nto digest an essay of such quality. It almost made me gloomy, partly\r\nfrom feeling I could not answer some points which theoretically I should\r\nhave liked to have been different, and partly from seeing SO FAR BETTER\r\nDONE than I COULD have done, discussions on some points which I had\r\nintended to have taken up...\r\n\r\nI much enjoyed the slaps you have given to the provincial\r\nspecies-mongers. I wish I could have been of the slightest use: I have\r\nbeen deeply interested by the whole essay, and congratulate you on\r\nhaving produced a memoir which I believe will be memorable. I was deep\r\nin it when your most considerate note arrived, begging me not to hurry.\r\nI thank Mrs. Hooker and yourself most sincerely for your wish to see me.\r\nI will not let another summer pass without seeing you at Kew, for indeed\r\nI should enjoy it much...\r\n\r\nYou do me really more honour than I have any claim to, putting me in\r\nafter Lyell on ups and downs. In a year or two's time, when I shall be\r\nat my species book (if I do not break down), I shall gnash my teeth and\r\nabuse you for having put so many hostile facts so confoundedly well.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 26th [1854].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI had hoped that you would have had a little breathing-time after your\r\nJournal, but this seems to be very far from the case; and I am the\r\nmore obliged (and somewhat contrite) for the long letter received this\r\nmorning, MOST juicy with news and MOST interesting to me in many ways. I\r\nam very glad indeed to hear of the reforms, etc., in the Royal Society.\r\nWith respect to the Club (The Philosophical Club, to which my father was\r\nelected (as Professor Bonney is good enough to inform me) on April 24,\r\n1854. He resigned his membership in 1864. The Club was founded in 1847.\r\nThe number of members being limited to 47, it was proposed to christen\r\nit \"the Club of 47,\" but the name was never adopted. The nature of the\r\nClub may be gathered from its first rule: \"The purpose of the Club is to\r\npromote as much as possible the scientific objects of the Royal Society;\r\nto facilitate intercourse between those Fellows who are actively engaged\r\nin cultivating the various branches of Natural Science, and who have\r\ncontributed to its progress; to increase the attendance at the evening\r\nmeetings, and to encourage the contribution and discussion of papers.\"\r\nThe Club met for dinner (at first) at 6, and the chair was to be quitted\r\nat 8.15, it being expected that members would go to the Royal Society.\r\nOf late years the dinner has been at 6.30, the Society meeting in the\r\nafternoon.), I am deeply interested; only two or three days ago, I\r\nwas regretting to my wife, how I was letting drop and being dropped by\r\nnearly all my acquaintances, and that I would endeavour to go oftener\r\nto London; I was not then thinking of the Club, which, as far as any one\r\nthing goes, would answer my exact object in keeping up old and making\r\nsome new acquaintances. I will therefore come up to London for every\r\n(with rare exceptions) Club-day, and then my head, I think, will allow\r\nme on an average to go to every other meeting. But it is grievous how\r\noften any change knocks me up. I will further pledge myself, as I told\r\nLyell, to resign after a year, if I did not attend pretty often, so\r\nthat I should AT WORST encumber the Club temporarily. If you can get me\r\nelected, I certainly shall be very much pleased. Very many thanks for\r\nanswers about Glaciers. I am very glad to hear of the second Edition (Of\r\nthe Himalayan Journal.) so very soon; but am not surprised, for I\r\nhave heard of several, in our small circle, reading it with very much\r\npleasure. I shall be curious to hear what Humboldt will say: it will, I\r\nshould think, delight him, and meet with more praise from him than any\r\nother book of Travels, for I cannot remember one, which has so many\r\nsubjects in common with him. What a wonderful old fellow he is...By the\r\nway, I hope, when you go to Hitcham, towards the end of May, you will be\r\nforced to have some rest. I am grieved to hear that all the bad symptoms\r\nhave not left Henslow; it is so strange and new to feel any uneasiness\r\nabout his health. I am particularly obliged to you for sending me\r\nAsa Gray's letter; how very pleasantly he writes. To see his and your\r\ncaution on the species-question ought to overwhelm me in confusion and\r\nshame; it does make me feel deuced uncomfortable...It is delightful\r\nto hear all that he says on Agassiz: how very singular it is that so\r\nEMINENTLY clever a man, with such IMMENSE knowledge on many branches of\r\nNatural History, should write as he does. Lyell told me that he was so\r\ndelighted with one of his (Agassiz) lectures on progressive development,\r\netc., etc., that he went to him afterwards and told him, \"that it was so\r\ndelightful, that he could not help all the time wishing it was true.\" I\r\nseldom see a Zoological paper from North America, without observing the\r\nimpress of Agassiz's doctrines--another proof, by the way, of how great\r\na man he is. I was pleased and surprised to see A. Gray's remarks on\r\ncrossing, obliterating varieties, on which, as you know, I have been\r\ncollecting facts for these dozen years. How awfully flat I shall feel,\r\nif when I get my notes together on species, etc., etc., the whole thing\r\nexplodes like an empty puff-ball. Do not work yourself to death.\r\n\r\nEver yours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 5th [1854].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI was delighted to get your note yesterday. I congratulate you very\r\nheartily (On the award to him of the Royal Society's Medal.), and\r\nwhether you care much or little, I rejoice to see the highest scientific\r\njudgment-court in Great Britain recognise your claims. I do hope Mrs.\r\nHooker is pleased, and E. desires me particularly to send her cordial\r\ncongratulations ...I pity you from the very bottom of my heart about\r\nyour after-dinner speech, which I fear I shall not hear. Without you\r\nhave a very much greater soul than I have (and I believe that you have),\r\nyou will find the medal a pleasant little stimulus, when work goes\r\nbadly, and one ruminates that all is vanity, it is pleasant to have some\r\ntangible proof, that others have thought something of one's labours.\r\n\r\nGood-bye my dear Hooker, I can assure [you] that we both most truly\r\nenjoyed your and Mrs. Hooker's visit here. Farewell.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker, your sincere friend, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. March 7 [1855].\r\n\r\n...I have just finished working well at Wollaston's (Thomas Vernon\r\nWollaston died (in his fifty-seventh year, as I believe) on January 4,\r\n1878. His health forcing him in early manhood to winter in the south,\r\nhe devoted himself to a study of the Coleoptera of Madeira, the Cape\r\nde Verdes, and St. Helena, whence he deduced evidence in support of the\r\nbelief in the submerged continent of 'Atlantis.' In an obituary notice\r\nby Mr. Rye ('Nature,' 1878) he is described as working persistently\r\n\"upon a broad conception of the science to which he was devoted,\" while\r\nbeing at the same time \"accurate, elaborate, and precise ad punctum, and\r\nnaturally of a minutely critical habit.\" His first scientific paper was\r\nwritten when he was an undergraduate at Jesus College, Cambridge. While\r\nat the University, he was an Associate and afterwards a Member of the\r\nRay Club: this is a small society which still meets once a week, and\r\nwhere the undergraduate members, or Associates, receive much kindly\r\nencouragement from their elders.) 'Insecta Maderensia': it is an\r\nADMIRABLE work. There is a very curious point in the astounding\r\nproportion of Coleoptera that are apterous; and I think I have guessed\r\nthe reason, viz., that powers of flight would be injurious to insects\r\ninhabiting a confined locality, and expose them to be blown to the sea:\r\nto test this, I find that the insects inhabiting the Dezerte Grande, a\r\nquite small islet, would be still more exposed to this danger, and here\r\nthe proportion of apterous insects is even considerably greater than on\r\nMadeira Proper. Wollaston speaks of Madeira and the other Archipelagoes\r\nas being \"sure and certain witnesses of Forbes' old continent,\" and of\r\ncourse the Entomological world implicitly follows this view. But to my\r\neyes it would be difficult to imagine facts more opposed to such a\r\nview. It is really disgusting and humiliating to see directly opposite\r\nconclusions drawn from the same facts.\r\n\r\nI have had some correspondence with Wollaston on this and other\r\nsubjects, and I find that he coolly assumes, (1) that formerly insects\r\npossessed greater migratory powers than now, (2) that the old land was\r\nSPECIALLY rich in centres of creation, (3) that the uniting land was\r\ndestroyed before the special creations had time to diffuse, and (4) that\r\nthe land was broken down before certain families and genera had time\r\nto reach from Europe or Africa the points of land in question. Are not\r\nthese a jolly lot of assumptions? and yet I shall see for the next dozen\r\nor score of years Wollaston quoted as proving the former existence of\r\npoor Forbes' Atlantis.\r\n\r\nI hope I have not wearied you, but I thought you would like to hear\r\nabout this book, which strikes me as EXCELLENT in its facts, and the\r\nauthor a most nice and modest man.\r\n\r\nMost truly yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, March 19th [1855].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nHow long it is since we have had any communication, and I really want to\r\nhear how the world goes with you; but my immediate object is to ask you\r\nto observe a point for me, and as I know now you are a very busy man\r\nwith too much to do, I shall have a good chance of your doing what I\r\nwant, as it would be hopeless to ask a quite idle man. As you have a\r\nNoah's Ark, I do not doubt that you have pigeons. (How I wish by any\r\nchance they were fantails!) Now what I want to know is, at what age\r\nnestling pigeons have their tail feathers sufficiently developed to be\r\ncounted. I do not think I ever saw a young pigeon. I am hard at work at\r\nmy notes collecting and comparing them, in order in some two or three\r\nyears to write a book with all the facts and arguments, which I can\r\ncollect, FOR AND VERSUS the immutability of species. I want to get the\r\nyoung of our domestic breeds, to see how young, and to what degree the\r\ndifferences appear. I must either breed myself (which is no amusement\r\nbut a horrid bore to me) the pigeons or buy their young; and before I go\r\nto a seller, whom I have heard of from Yarrell, I am really anxious\r\nto know something about their development, not to expose my excessive\r\nignorance, and therefore be excessively liable to be cheated and gulled.\r\nWith respect to the ONE point of the tail feathers, it is of course\r\nin relation to the wonderful development of tail feathers in the adult\r\nfantail. If you had any breed of poultry pure, I would beg a chicken\r\nwith exact age stated, about a week or fortnight old! To be sent in\r\na box by post, if you could have the heart to kill one; and secondly,\r\nwould let me pay postage...Indeed, I should be very glad to have a\r\nnestling common pigeon sent, for I mean to make skeletons, and have\r\nalready just begun comparing wild and tame ducks. And I think the\r\nresults rather curious (\"I have just been testing practically what\r\ndisuse does in reducing parts; I have made skeleton of wild and\r\ntame duck (oh, the smell of well-boiled, high duck!!) and I find the\r\ntame-duck wing ought, according to scale of wild prototype, to have its\r\ntwo wings 360 grains in weight, but it has it only 317.\"--A letter to\r\nSir J. Hooker, 1855.), for on weighing the several bones very carefully,\r\nwhen perfectly cleaned the proportional weights of the two have greatly\r\nvaried, the foot of the tame having largely increased. How I wish I\r\ncould get a little wild duck of a week old, but that I know is almost\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nWith respect to ourselves, I have not much to say; we have now a\r\nterribly noisy house with the whooping cough, but otherwise are all\r\nwell. Far the greatest fact about myself is that I have at last quite\r\ndone with the everlasting barnacles. At the end of the year we had two\r\nof our little boys very ill with fever and bronchitis, and all sorts of\r\nailments. Partly for amusement, and partly for change of air, we went to\r\nLondon and took a house for a month, but it turned out a great failure,\r\nfor that dreadful frost just set in when we went, and all our children\r\ngot unwell, and E. and I had coughs and colds and rheumatism nearly all\r\nthe time. We had put down first on our list of things to do, to go and\r\nsee Mrs. Fox, but literally after waiting some time to see whether the\r\nweather would not improve, we had not a day when we both could go out.\r\n\r\nI do hope before very long you will be able to manage to pay us a visit.\r\nTime is slipping away, and we are getting oldish. Do tell us about\r\nyourself and all your large family.\r\n\r\nI know you will help me IF YOU CAN with information about the young\r\npigeons; and anyhow do write before very long.\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox, your sincere old friend, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Amongst all sorts of odds and ends, with which I am amusing\r\nmyself, I am comparing the seeds of the variations of plants. I had\r\nformerly some wild cabbage seeds, which I gave to some one, was it to\r\nyou? It is a THOUSAND to one it was thrown away, if not I should be very\r\nglad of a pinch of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following extract from a letter to Mr. Fox (March 27th, 1855)\r\nrefers to the same subject as the last letter, and gives some account\r\nof the \"species work:\" \"The way I shall kill young things will be to put\r\nthem under a tumbler glass with a teaspoon of ether or chloroform, the\r\nglass being pressed down on some yielding surface, and leave them for an\r\nhour or two, young have such power of revivication. (I have thus killed\r\nmoths and butterflies.) The best way would be to send them as you\r\nprocure them, in pasteboard chip-box by post, on which you could write\r\nand just tie up with string; and you will REALLY make me happier by\r\nallowing me to keep an account of postage, etc. Upon my word I can\r\nhardly believe that ANY ONE could be so good-natured as to take such\r\ntrouble and do such a very disagreeable thing as kill babies; and I am\r\nvery sure I do not know one soul who, except yourself, would do so. I am\r\ngoing to ask one thing more; should old hens of any above poultry (not\r\nduck) die or become so old as to be USELESS, I wish you would send her\r\nto me per rail, addressed to C. Darwin, care of Mr. Acton, Post-office,\r\nBromley, Kent.\" Will you keep this address? as shortest way for parcels.\r\nBut I do not care so much for this, as I could buy the old birds dead at\r\nBaily to make skeletons. I should have written at once even if I had\r\nnot heard from you, to beg you not to take trouble about pigeons, for\r\nYarrell has persuaded me to attempt it, and I am now fitting up a place,\r\nand have written to Baily about prices, etc., etc. SOMETIME (when you\r\nare better) I should like very much to hear a little about your\r\n\"Little Call Duck\"; why so-called? And where you got it? and what it is\r\nlike?... I was so ignorant I do not even know there were three varieties\r\nof Dorking fowl: how do they differ?...\r\n\r\nI forget whether I ever told you what the object of my present work\r\nis,--it is to view all facts that I can master (eheu, eheu, how ignorant\r\nI find I am) in Natural History (as on geographical distribution,\r\npalaeontology, classification, hybridism, domestic animals and plants,\r\netc., etc., etc.) to see how far they favour or are opposed to the\r\nnotion that wild species are mutable or immutable: I mean with my utmost\r\npower to give all arguments and facts on both sides. I have a NUMBER of\r\npeople helping me in every way, and giving me most valuable assistance;\r\nbut I often doubt whether the subject will not quite overpower me.\r\n\r\nSo much for the quasi-business part of my letter. I am very very sorry\r\nto hear so indifferent account of your health: with your large family\r\nyour life is very precious, and I am sure with all your activity and\r\ngoodness it ought to be a happy one, or as happy as can reasonably be\r\nexpected with all the cares of futurity on one.\r\n\r\nOne cannot expect the present to be like the old Crux-major days at the\r\nfoot of those noble willow stumps, the memory of which I revere. I\r\nnow find my little entomology which I wholly owe to you, comes in very\r\nuseful. I am very glad to hear that you have given yourself a rest from\r\nSunday duties. How much illness you have had in your life! Farewell\r\nmy dear Fox. I assure you I thank you heartily for your proffered\r\nassistance.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, May 7th [1855].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nMy correspondence has cost you a deal of trouble, though this note will\r\nnot. I found yours on my return home on Saturday after a week's work\r\nin London. Whilst there I saw Yarrell, who told me he had carefully\r\nexamined all points in the Call Duck, and did not feel any doubt about\r\nit being specifically identical, and that it had crossed freely with\r\ncommon varieties in St. James's Park. I should therefore be very glad\r\nfor a seven-days' duckling and for one of the old birds, should one ever\r\ndie a natural death. Yarrell told me that Sabine had collected forty\r\nvarieties of the common duck!...Well, to return to business; nobody,\r\nI am sure, could fix better for me than you the characteristic age of\r\nlittle chickens; with respect to skeletons, I have feared it would be\r\nimpossible to make them, but I suppose I shall be able to measure limbs,\r\netc., by feeling the joints. What you say about old cocks just confirms\r\nwhat I thought, and I will make my skeletons of old cocks. Should an\r\nold wild turkey ever die, please remember me; I do not care for a baby\r\nturkey, nor for a mastiff. Very many thanks for your offer. I have\r\npuppies of bull-dogs and greyhound in salt, and I have had cart-horse\r\nand race-horse young colts carefully measured. Whether I shall do any\r\ngood I doubt. I am getting out of my depth.\r\n\r\nMost truly yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[An extract from a letter to Mr. Fox may find a place here, though of a\r\nlater date, viz. July, 1855]:\r\n\r\n\"Many thanks for the seven days' old white Dorking, and for the other\r\npromised ones. I am getting quite a 'chamber of horrors,' I appreciate\r\nyour kindness even more than before; for I have done the black deed and\r\nmurdered an angelic little fantail and pouter at ten days old. I tried\r\nchloroform and ether for the first, and though evidently a perfectly\r\neasy death, it was prolonged; and for the second I tried putting lumps\r\nof cyanide of potassium in a very large damp bottle, half an hour before\r\nputting in the pigeon, and the prussic acid gas thus generated was very\r\nquickly fatal.\"\r\n\r\nA letter to Mr. Fox (May 23rd, 1855) gives the first mention of my\r\nfather's laborious piece of work on the breeding of pigeons:\r\n\r\n\"I write now to say that I have been looking at some of our mongrel\r\nchickens, and I should say ONE WEEK OLD would do very well. The chief\r\npoints which I am, and have been for years, very curious about, is to\r\nascertain whether the YOUNG of our domestic breeds differ as much from\r\neach other as do their parents, and I have no faith in anything short\r\nof actual measurement and the Rule of Three. I hope and believe I am not\r\ngiving so much trouble without a motive of sufficient worth. I have got\r\nmy fantails and pouters (choice birds, I hope, as I paid 20 shillings\r\nfor each pair from Baily) in a grand cage and pigeon-house, and they are\r\na decided amusement to me, and delight to H.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of my father's pigeon-fancying enterprise he necessarily\r\nbecame acquainted with breeders, and was fond of relating his\r\nexperiences as a member of the Columbarian and Philoperistera Clubs,\r\nwhere he met the purest enthusiasts of the \"fancy,\" and learnt much\r\nof the mysteries of their art. In writing to Mr. Huxley some years\r\nafterwards, he quotes from a book on 'Pigeons' by Mr. J. Eaton, in\r\nillustration of the \"extreme attention and close observation\" necessary\r\nto be a good fancier.\r\n\r\n\"In his [Mr. Eaton's] treatise, devoted to the Almond Tumbler ALONE,\r\nwhich is a sub-variety of the short-faced variety, which is a variety of\r\nthe Tumbler, as that is of the Rock-pigeon, Mr. Eaton says: 'There are\r\nsome of the young fanciers who are over-covetous, who go for all the\r\nfive properties at once [i.e., the five characteristic points which are\r\nmainly attended to,--C.D.], they have their reward by getting nothing.'\r\nIn short, it is almost beyond the human intellect to attend to ALL the\r\nexcellencies of the Almond Tumbler!\r\n\r\n\"To be a good breeder, and to succeed in improving any breed, beyond\r\neverything enthusiasm is required. Mr. Eaton has gained lots of prizes,\r\nlisten to him.\r\n\r\n\"'If it was possible for noblemen and gentlemen to know the amazing\r\namount of solace and pleasure derived from the Almond Tumbler, when they\r\nbegin to understand their (i.e., the tumbler's) properties, I should\r\nthink that scarce any nobleman or gentleman would be without their\r\naviaries of Almond Tumblers.'\"\r\n\r\nMy father was fond of quoting this passage, and always with a tone of\r\nfellow-feeling for the author, though, no doubt, he had forgotten\r\nhis own wonderings as a child that \"every gentleman did not become an\r\nornithologist.\"--('Autobiography,' page 32.)\r\n\r\nTo Mr. W.B. Tegetmeier, the well-known writer on poultry, etc., he was\r\nindebted for constant advice and co-operation. Their correspondence\r\nbegan in 1855, and lasted to 1881, when my father wrote: \"I can assure\r\nyou that I often look back with pleasure to the old days when I attended\r\nto pigeons, fowls, etc., and when you gave me such valuable assistance.\r\nI not rarely regret that I have had so little strength that I have not\r\nbeen able to keep up old acquaintances and friendships.\" My father's\r\nletters to Mr. Tegetmeier consist almost entirely of series of questions\r\nrelating to the different breeds of fowls, pigeons, etc., and are not,\r\ntherefore interesting. In reading through the pile of letters, one is\r\nmuch struck by the diligence of the writer's search for facts, and it is\r\nmade clear that Mr. Tegetmeier's knowledge and judgment were completely\r\ntrusted and highly valued by him. Numerous phrases, such as \"your note\r\nis a mine of wealth to me,\" occur, expressing his sense of the value of\r\nMr. Tegetmeier's help, as well as words expressing his warm appreciation\r\nof Mr. Tegetmeier's unstinting zeal and kindness, or his \"pure and\r\ndisinterested love of science.\" On the subject of hive-bees and their\r\ncombs, Mr. Tegetmeier's help was also valued by my father, who wrote,\r\n\"your paper on 'Bees-cells,' read before the British Association, was\r\nhighly useful and suggestive to me.\"\r\n\r\nTo work out the problems on the Geographical Distributions of animals\r\nand plants on evolutionary principles, he had to study the means by\r\nwhich seeds, eggs, etc., can be transported across wide spaces of ocean.\r\nIt was this need which gave an interest to the class of experiment to\r\nwhich the following letters allude.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, May 17th [1855].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nYou will hate the very sight of my hand-writing; but after this time I\r\npromise I will ask for nothing more, at least for a long time. As you\r\nlive on sandy soil, have you lizards at all common? If you have, should\r\nyou think it too ridiculous to offer a reward for me for lizard's eggs\r\nto the boys in your school; a shilling for every half-dozen, or more if\r\nrare, till you got two or three dozen and send them to me? If snake's\r\neggs were brought in mistake it would be very well, for I want such\r\nalso; and we have neither lizards nor snakes about here. My object is\r\nto see whether such eggs will float on sea water, and whether they will\r\nkeep alive thus floating for a month or two in my cellar. I am trying\r\nexperiments on transportation of all organic beings that I can; and\r\nlizards are found on every island, and therefore I am very anxious to\r\nsee whether their eggs stand sea water. Of course this note need not be\r\nanswered, without, by a strange and favourable chance, you can some day\r\nanswer it with the eggs.\r\n\r\nYour most troublesome friend, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. April 13th [1855].\r\n\r\n...I have had one experiment some little time in progress, which will, I\r\nthink, be interesting, namely, seeds in salt water immersed in water of\r\n32-33 degrees, which I have and shall long have, as I filled a great\r\ntank with snow. When I wrote last I was going to triumph over you, for\r\nmy experiment had in a slight degree succeeded; but this, with infinite\r\nbaseness, I did not tell, in hopes that you would say that you would\r\neat all the plants which I could raise after immersion. It is very\r\naggravating that I cannot in the least remember what you did formerly\r\nsay that made me think you scoffed at the experiments vastly; for you\r\nnow seem to view the experiment like a good Christian. I have in small\r\nbottles out of doors, exposed to variation of temperature, cress,\r\nradish, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, and celery, and onion seed--four\r\ngreat families. These, after immersion for exactly one week, have all\r\ngerminated, which I did not in the least expect (and thought how you\r\nwould sneer at me); for the water of nearly all, and of the cress\r\nespecially, smelt very badly, and the cress seed emitted a wonderful\r\nquantity of mucus (the 'Vestiges' would have expected them to turn into\r\ntadpoles), so as to adhere in a mass; but these seeds germinated and\r\ngrew splendidly. The germination of all (especially cress and lettuces)\r\nhas been accelerated, except the cabbages, which have come up very\r\nirregularly, and a good many, I think, dead. One would have thought,\r\nfrom their native habitat, that the cabbage would have stood well. The\r\nUmbelliferae and onions seem to stand the salt well. I wash the seed\r\nbefore planting them. I have written to the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" (A\r\nfew words asking for information. The results were published in the\r\n'Gardeners' Chronicle,' May 26, November 24, 1855. In the same year\r\n(page 789) he sent a P.S. to his former paper, correcting a misprint and\r\nadding a few words on the seeds of the Leguminosae. A fuller paper on\r\nthe germination of seeds after treatment in salt water, appeared in the\r\n'Linnaean Soc. Journal,' 1857, page 130.), though I doubt whether it was\r\nworth while. If my success seems to make it worth while, I will send a\r\nseed list, to get you to mark some different classes of seeds. To-day I\r\nreplant the same seeds as above after fourteen days' immersion. As many\r\nsea-currents go a mile an hour, even in a week they might be transported\r\n168 miles; the Gulf Stream is said to go fifty and sixty miles a day. So\r\nmuch and too much on this head; but my geese are always swans...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [April 14th, 1855.]\r\n\r\n...You are a good man to confess that you expected the cress would be\r\nkilled in a week, for this gives me a nice little triumph. The children\r\nat first were tremendously eager, and asked me often, \"whether I should\r\nbeat Dr. Hooker!\" The cress and lettuce have just vegetated well after\r\ntwenty-one days' immersion. But I will write no more, which is a\r\ngreat virtue in me; for it is to me a very great pleasure telling you\r\neverything I do.\r\n\r\n...If you knew some of the experiments (if they may be so-called) which\r\nI am trying, you would have a good right to sneer, for they are so\r\nABSURD even in MY opinion that I dare not tell you.\r\n\r\nHave not some men a nice notion of experimentising? I have had a letter\r\ntelling me that seeds MUST have GREAT power of resisting salt water, for\r\notherwise how could they get to islands? This is the true way to solve a\r\nproblem!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [1855].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYou have been a very good man to exhale some of your satisfaction in\r\nwriting two notes to me; you could not have taken a better line in\r\nmy opinion; but as for showing your satisfaction in confounding my\r\nexperiments, I assure you I am quite enough confounded--those horrid\r\nseeds, which, as you truly observe, if they sink they won't float.\r\n\r\nI have written to Scoresby and have had a rather dry answer, but very\r\nmuch to the purpose, and giving me no hopes of any law unknown to me\r\nwhich might arrest their everlasting descent into the deepest depths of\r\nthe ocean. By the way it was very odd, but I talked to Col. Sabine for\r\nhalf an hour on the subject, and could not make him see with respect to\r\ntransportal the difficulty of the sinking question! The bore is, if\r\nthe confounded seeds will sink, I have been taking all this trouble in\r\nsalting the ungrateful rascals for nothing.\r\n\r\nEverything has been going wrong with me lately; the fish at the\r\nZoological Society ate up lots of soaked seeds, and in imagination\r\nthey had in my mind been swallowed, fish and all, by a heron, had been\r\ncarried a hundred miles, been voided on the banks of some other lake and\r\ngerminated splendidly, when lo and behold, the fish ejected vehemently,\r\nand with disgust equal to my own, ALL the seeds from their mouths. (In\r\ndescribing these troubles to Mr. Fox, my father wrote:--\"All nature is\r\nperverse and will not do as I wish it; and just at present I wish I had\r\nmy old barnacles to work at, and nothing new.\" The experiment ultimately\r\nsucceeded, and he wrote to Sir J. Hooker:--\"I find fish will greedily\r\neat seeds of aquatic grasses, and that millet-seed put into fish and\r\ngiven to a stork, and then voided, will germinate. So this is the\r\nnursery rhyme of 'this is the stick that beats the pig,' etc., etc.,\")\r\n\r\nBut I am not going to give up the floating yet: in first place I must\r\ntry fresh seeds, though of course it seems far more probable that they\r\nwill sink; and secondly, as a last resource, I must believe in the pod\r\nor even whole plant or branch being washed into the sea; with floods and\r\nslips and earthquakes; this must continually be happening, and if kept\r\nwet, I fancy the pods, etc. etc., would not open and shed their seeds.\r\nDo try your Mimosa seed at Kew.\r\n\r\nI had intended to have asked you whether the Mimosa scandens and\r\nGuilandina bonduc grows at Kew, to try fresh seeds. R. Brown tells me\r\nhe believes four W. Indian seeds have been washed on shores of Europe.\r\nI was assured at Keeling Island that seeds were not rarely washed\r\non shore: so float they must and shall! What a long yarn I have been\r\nspinning.\r\n\r\nIf you have several of the Loffoden seeds, do soak some in tepid water,\r\nand get planted with the utmost care: this is an experiment after my own\r\nheart, with chances 1000 to 1 against its success.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 11th [1855].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,--I have just received your note. I am most sincerely\r\nand heartily glad at the news (The appointment of Sir J.D. Hooker as\r\nAssistant Director of the Royal Gardens at Kew.) it contains, and so is\r\nmy wife. Though the income is but a poor one, yet the certainty, I hope,\r\nis satisfactory to yourself and Mrs. Hooker. As it must lead in future\r\nyears to the Directorship, I do hope you look at it, as a piece of good\r\nfortune. For my own taste I cannot fancy a pleasanter position, than\r\nthe Head of such a noble and splendid place; far better, I should\r\nthink, than a Professorship in a great town. The more I think of it, the\r\ngladder I am. But I will say no more; except that I hope Mrs. Hooker is\r\npretty well pleased...\r\n\r\nAs the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" put in my question, and took notice of it,\r\nI think I am bound to send, which I had thought of doing next week, my\r\nfirst report to Lindley to give him the option of inserting it; but I\r\nthink it likely that he may not think it fit for a Gardening periodical.\r\nWhen my experiments are ended (should the results appear worthy) and\r\nshould the 'Linnean Journal' not object to the previous publication of\r\nimperfect and provisional reports, I should be DELIGHTED to insert the\r\nfinal report there; for it has cost me so much trouble, that I should\r\nthink that probably the result was worthy of more permanent record than\r\na newspaper; but I think I am bound to send it first to Lindley.\r\n\r\nI begin to think the floating question more serious than the germinating\r\none; and am making all the inquiries which I can on the subject, and\r\nhope to get some little light on it...\r\n\r\nI hope you managed a good meeting at the Club. The Treasurership must be\r\na plague to you, and I hope you will not be Treasurer for long: I know I\r\nwould much sooner give up the Club than be its Treasurer.\r\n\r\nFarewell, Mr. Assistant Director and dear friend, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. June 5th, 1855.\r\n\r\n...Miss Thorley (A lady who was for many years a governess in the\r\nfamily.) and I are doing A LITTLE BOTANICAL WORK! for our amusement, and\r\nit does amuse me very much, viz., making a collection of all the plants,\r\nwhich grow in a field, which has been allowed to run waste for fifteen\r\nyears, but which before was cultivated from time immemorial; and we\r\nare also collecting all the plants in an adjoining and SIMILAR but\r\ncultivated field; just for the fun of seeing what plants have survived\r\nor died out. Hereafter we shall want a bit of help in naming puzzlers.\r\nHow dreadfully difficult it is to name plants.\r\n\r\nWhat a REMARKABLY nice and kind letter Dr. A. Gray has sent me in answer\r\nto my troublesome queries; I retained your copy of his 'Manual' till I\r\nheard from him, and when I have answered his letter, I will return it to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI thank you much for Hedysarum: I do hope it is not very precious,\r\nfor as I told you it is for probably a MOST foolish purpose. I read\r\nsomewhere that no plant closes its leaves so promptly in darkness, and I\r\nwant to cover it up daily for half an hour, and see if I can teach it\r\nto close by itself, or more easily than at first in darkness...I cannot\r\nmake out why you would prefer a continental transmission, as I think\r\nyou do, to carriage by sea. I should have thought you would have been\r\npleased at as many means of transmission as possible. For my own pet\r\ntheoretic notions, it is quite indifferent whether they are transmitted\r\nby sea or land, as long as some tolerably probable way is shown. But it\r\nshocks my philosophy to create land, without some other and independent\r\nevidence. Whenever we meet, by a very few words I should, I think, more\r\nclearly understand your views...\r\n\r\nI have just made out my first grass, hurrah! hurrah! I must confess that\r\nfortune favours the bold, for, as good luck would have it, it was the\r\neasy Anthoxanthum odoratum: nevertheless it is a great discovery; I\r\nnever expected to make out a grass in all my life, so hurrah! It has\r\ndone my stomach surprising good...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [June?] 15th, [1855].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI just write one line to say that the Hedysarum is come QUITE SAFELY,\r\nand thank you for it.\r\n\r\nYou cannot imagine what amusement you have given me by naming those\r\nthree grasses: I have just got paper to dry and collect all grasses. If\r\never you catch quite a beginner, and want to give him a taste of Botany,\r\ntell him to make a perfect list of some little field or wood. Both Miss\r\nThorley and I agree that it gives a really uncommon interest to the\r\nwork, having a nice little definite world to work on, instead of the\r\nawful abyss and immensity of all British Plants.\r\n\r\nAdios. I was really consummately impudent to express my opinion \"on the\r\nretrograde step\" (\"To imagine such enormous geological changes within\r\nthe period of the existence of now living beings, on no other ground but\r\nto account for their distribution, seems to me, in our present state\r\nof ignorance on the means of transportal, an almost retrograde step\r\nin science.\"--Extract from the paper on 'Salt Water and Seeds' in\r\n\"Gardeners' Chronicle\", May 26, 1855.), and I deserved a good snub,\r\nand upon reflection I am very glad you did not answer me in \"Gardeners'\r\nChronicle\".\r\n\r\nI have been VERY MUCH interested with the Florula. (Godron's 'Florula\r\nJuvenalis,' which gives an interesting account of plants introduced in\r\nimported wool.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Writing on June 5th to Sir J.D. Hooker, my father mentions a letter\r\nfrom Dr. Asa Gray. The letter referred to was an answer to the\r\nfollowing:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. (The well-known American Botanist. My\r\nfather's friendship with Dr. Gray began with the correspondence of which\r\nthe present is the first letter. An extract from a letter to Sir J.\r\nHooker, 1857, shows that my father's strong personal regard for Dr. Gray\r\nhad an early origin: \"I have been glad to see A. Gray's letters; there\r\nis always something in them that shows that he is a very lovable man.\")\r\nDown, April 25th [1855].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI hope that you will remember that I had the pleasure of being\r\nintroduced to you at Kew. I want to beg a great favour of you, for which\r\nI well know I can offer no apology. But the favour will not, I think,\r\ncause you much trouble, and will greatly oblige me. As I am no botanist,\r\nit will seem so absurd to you my asking botanical questions; that I\r\nmay premise that I have for several years been collecting facts on\r\n\"variation,\" and when I find that any general remark seems to hold good\r\namongst animals, I try to test it in Plants. [Here follows a request for\r\ninformation on American Alpine plants, and a suggestion as to publishing\r\non the subject.] I can assure you that I perceive how presumptuous it is\r\nin me, not a botanist, to make even the most trifling suggestion to such\r\na botanist as yourself; but from what I saw and have heard of you from\r\nour dear and kind friend Hooker, I hope and think you will forgive me,\r\nand believe me, with much respect,\r\n\r\nDear sir, yours very faithfully, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, June 8th [1855].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you cordially for your remarkably kind letter of the 22d. ult.,\r\nand for the extremely pleasant and obliging manner in which you have\r\ntaken my rather troublesome questions. I can hardly tell you how much\r\nyour list of Alpine plants has interested me, and I can now in some\r\ndegree picture to myself the plants of your Alpine summits. The new\r\nedition of your Manual is CAPITAL news for me. I know from your preface\r\nhow pressed you are for room, but it would take no space to append (Eu)\r\nin brackets to any European plant, and, as far as I am concerned,\r\nthis would answer every purpose. (This suggestion Dr. Gray adopted in\r\nsubsequent editions.) From my own experience, whilst making out English\r\nplants in our manuals, it has often struck me how much interest it would\r\ngive if some notion of their range had been given; and so, I cannot\r\ndoubt, your American inquirers and beginners would much like to know\r\nwhich of their plants were indigenous and which European. Would it not\r\nbe well in the Alpine plants to append the very same addition which you\r\nhave now sent me in MS.? though here, owing to your kindness, I do not\r\nspeak selfishly, but merely pro bono Americano publico. I presume it\r\nwould be too troublesome to give in your manual the habitats of those\r\nplants found west of the Rocky Mountains, and likewise those found\r\nin Eastern Asia, taking the Yenesei (?),--which, if I remember right,\r\naccording to Gmelin, is the main partition line of Siberia. Perhaps\r\nSiberia more concerns the northern Flora of North America. The ranges of\r\nplants to the east and west, viz., whether most found are in Greenland\r\nand Western Europe, or in E. Asia, appears to me a very interesting\r\npoint as tending to show whether the migration has been eastward or\r\nwestward. Pray believe me that I am most entirely conscious that\r\nthe ONLY USE of these remarks is to show a botanist what points a\r\nnon-botanist is curious to learn; for I think every one who studies\r\nprofoundly a subject often becomes unaware [on] what points the ignorant\r\nrequire information. I am so very glad that you think of drawing up\r\nsome notice on your geographical distribution, for the air of the Manual\r\nstrikes me as in some points better adapted for comparison with Europe\r\nthan that of the whole of North America. You ask me to state definitely\r\nsome of the points on which I much wish for information; but I really\r\nhardly can, for they are so vague; and I rather wish to see what results\r\nwill come out from comparisons, than have as yet defined objects. I\r\npresume that, like other botanists, you would give, for your area, the\r\nproportion (leaving out introduced plants) to the whole of the great\r\nleading families: this is one point I had intended (and, indeed, have\r\ndone roughly) to tabulate from your book, but of course I could\r\nhave done it only VERY IMPERFECTLY. I should also, of course, have\r\nascertained the proportion, to the whole Flora, of the European plants\r\n(leaving out introduced) AND OF THE SEPARATE GREAT FAMILIES, in order to\r\nspeculate on means of transportal. By the way, I ventured to send a few\r\ndays ago a copy of the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" with a short report by me\r\nof some trifling experiments which I have been trying on the power of\r\nseeds to withstand sea water. I do not know whether it has struck you,\r\nbut it has me, that it would be advisable for botanists to give in WHOLE\r\nNUMBERS, as well as in the lowest fraction, the proportional numbers of\r\nthe families, thus I make out from your Manual that of the INDIGENOUS\r\nplants the proportion of the Umbelliferae are 36/1798 = 1/49; for,\r\nwithout one knows the WHOLE numbers, one cannot judge how really\r\nclose the numbers of the plants of the same family are in two distant\r\ncountries; but very likely you may think this superfluous. Mentioning\r\nthese proportional numbers, I may give you an instance of the sort of\r\npoints, and how vague and futile they often are, which I ATTEMPT to work\r\nout...; reflecting on R. Brown's and Hooker's remark, that near identity\r\nof proportional numbers of the great families in two countries, shows\r\nprobably that they were once continuously united, I thought I would\r\ncalculate the proportions of, for instance, the INTRODUCED Compositae in\r\nGreat Britain to all the introduced plants, and the result was, 10/92 =\r\n1/9.2. In our ABORIGINAL or indigenous flora the proportion is 1/10; and\r\nin many other cases I found an equally striking correspondence. I then\r\ntook your Manual, and worked out the same question; here I find in the\r\nCompositae an almost equally striking correspondence, viz. 24/206 = 1/8\r\nin the introduced plants, and 223/1798 = 1/8 in the indigenous; but when\r\nI came to the other families I found the proportion entirely different,\r\nshowing that the coincidences in the British Flora were probably\r\naccidental!\r\n\r\nYou will, I presume, give the proportion of the species to the genera,\r\ni.e., show on an average how many species each genus contains; though I\r\nhave done this for myself.\r\n\r\nIf it would not be too troublesome, do you not think it would be very\r\ninteresting, and give a very good idea of your Flora, to divide the\r\nspecies into three groups, viz., (a) species common to the old world,\r\nstating numbers common to Europe and Asia; (b) indigenous species, but\r\nbelonging to genera found in the old world; and (c) species belonging\r\nto genera confined to America or the New World. To make (according to my\r\nideas) perfection perfect, one ought to be told whether there are other\r\ncases, like Erica, of genera common in Europe or in Old World not found\r\nin your area. But honestly I feel that it is quite ridiculous my writing\r\nto you at such length on the subject; but, as you have asked me, I do it\r\ngratefully, and write to you as I should to Hooker, who often laughs at\r\nme unmercifully, and I am sure you have better reason to do so.\r\n\r\nThere is one point on which I am MOST anxious for information, and I\r\nmention it with the greatest hesitation, and only in the FULL BELIEF\r\nthat you will believe me that I have not the folly and presumption\r\nto hope for a second that you will give it, without you can with very\r\nlittle trouble. The point can at present interest no one but myself,\r\nwhich makes the case wholly different from geographical distribution.\r\nThe only way in which, I think, you possibly could do it with little\r\ntrouble would be to bear in mind, whilst correcting your proof-sheets\r\nof the Manual, my question and put a cross or mark to the species, and\r\nwhenever sending a parcel to Hooker to let me have such old sheets. But\r\nthis would give you the trouble of remembering my question, and I can\r\nhardly hope or expect that you will do it. But I will just mention what\r\nI want; it is to have marked the \"close species\" in a Flora, so as\r\nto compare in DIFFERENT Floras whether the same genera have \"close\r\nspecies,\" and for other purposes too vague to enumerate. I have\r\nattempted, by Hooker's help, to ascertain in a similar way whether the\r\ndifferent species of the same genera in distant quarters of the globe\r\nare variable or present varieties. The definition I should give of a\r\n\"CLOSE SPECIES\" was one that YOU thought specifically distinct, but\r\nwhich you could conceive some other GOOD botanist might think only\r\na race or variety; or, again, a species that you had trouble, though\r\nhaving opportunities of knowing it well, in discriminating from some\r\nother species. Supposing that you were inclined to be so very kind as\r\nto do this, and could (which I do not expect) spare the time, as I have\r\nsaid, a mere cross to each such species in any useless proof-sheets\r\nwould give me the information desired, which, I may add, I know must be\r\nvague.\r\n\r\nHow can I apologise enough for all my presumption and the extreme length\r\nof this letter? The great good nature of your letter to me has been\r\npartly the cause, so that, as is too often the case in this world, you\r\nare punished for your good deeds. With hearty thanks, believe me,\r\n\r\nYours very truly and gratefully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, 18th [July, 1855].\r\n\r\n...I think I am getting a MILD case about Charlock seed (In the\r\n\"Gardeners' Chronicle\", 1855, page 758, appeared a notice (half a column\r\nin length) by my father on the \"Vitality of Seeds.\" The facts related\r\nrefer to the \"Sand-walk\"; the wood was planted in 1846 on a piece of\r\npasture land laid down as grass in 1840. In 1855, on the soil being dug\r\nin several places, Charlock (Brassica sinapistrum) sprang up freely.\r\nThe subject continued to interest him, and I find a note dated July\r\n2nd, 1874, in which my father recorded that forty-six plants of Charlock\r\nsprang up in that year over a space (14 x 7 feet) which had been dug\r\nto a considerable depth.); but just as about salting, ill-luck to it, I\r\ncannot remember how many years you would allow that Charlock seed might\r\nlive in the ground. Next time you write, show a bold face, and say in\r\nhow many years, you think, Charlock seed would probably all be dead. A\r\nman told me the other day of, as I thought, a splendid instance,--and\r\nSPLENDID it was, for according to his evidence the seed came up alive\r\nout of the LOWER PART of the LONDON CLAY!! I disgusted him by telling\r\nhim that Palms ought to have come up.\r\n\r\nYou ask how far I go in attributing organisms to a common descent; I\r\nanswer I know not; the way in which I intend treating the subject, is\r\nto show (AS FAR AS I CAN) the facts and arguments for and against the\r\ncommon descent of the species of the same genus; and then show how\r\nfar the same arguments tell for or against forms, more and more widely\r\ndifferent: and when we come to forms of different orders and classes,\r\nthere remain only some such arguments as those which can perhaps be\r\ndeduced from similar rudimentary structures, and very soon not an\r\nargument is left.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following extract from a letter to Mr. Fox [October, 1855 (In this\r\nyear he published ('Phil. Mag.' x.) a paper 'On the power of icebergs\r\nto make rectilinear uniformly-directed grooves across a submarine\r\nundulatory surface.'\") gives a brief mention of the last meeting of the\r\nBritish Association which he attended:] \"I really have no news: the\r\nonly thing we have done for a long time, was to go to Glasgow; but the\r\nfatigue was to me more than it was worth, and E. caught a bad cold. On\r\nour return we stayed a single day at Shrewsbury, and enjoyed seeing the\r\nold place. I saw a little of Sir Philip (Sir P. Egerton was a neighbour\r\nof Mr. Fox.) (whom I liked much), and he asked me \"why on earth I\r\ninstigated you to rob his poultry-yard?' The meeting was a good one, and\r\nthe Duke of Argyll spoke excellently.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.XII. -- THE UNFINISHED BOOK.\r\n\r\nMAY 1856 TO JUNE 1858.\r\n\r\n[In the Autobiographical chapter (page 69,) my father wrote:--\"Early in\r\n1856 Lyell advised me to write out my views pretty fully, and I began at\r\nonce to do so on a scale three or four times as extensive as that which\r\nwas afterwards followed in my 'Origin of Species;' yet it was only an\r\nabstract of the materials which I had collected.\" The letters in the\r\npresent chapter are chiefly concerned with the preparation of this\r\nunfinished book.\r\n\r\nThe work was begun on May 14th, and steadily continued up to June 1858,\r\nwhen it was interrupted by the arrival of Mr. Wallace's MS. During the\r\ntwo years which we are now considering he wrote ten chapters (that is\r\nabout one-half) of the projected book. He remained for the most part at\r\nhome, but paid several visits to Dr. Lane's Water-Cure Establishment\r\nat Moor Park, during one of which he made a pilgrimage to the shrine of\r\nGilbert White at Selborne.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL May 3 [1856].\r\n\r\n...With respect to your suggestion of a sketch of my views, I hardly\r\nknow what to think, but will reflect on it, but it goes against my\r\nprejudices. To give a fair sketch would be absolutely impossible, for\r\nevery proposition requires such an array of facts. If I were\r\nto do anything, it could only refer to the main agency of\r\nchange--selection--and perhaps point out a very few of the leading\r\nfeatures, which countenance such a view, and some few of the main\r\ndifficulties. But I do not know what to think; I rather hate the idea of\r\nwriting for priority, yet I certainly should be vexed if any one were\r\nto publish my doctrines before me. Anyhow, I thank you heartily for\r\nyour sympathy. I shall be in London next week, and I will call on you on\r\nThursday morning for one hour precisely, so as not to lose much of\r\nyour time and my own; but will you let me this time come as early as 9\r\no'clock, for I have much which I must do in the morning in my strongest\r\ntime? Farewell, my dear old patron.\r\n\r\nYours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nBy the way, THREE plants have come up out of the earth, perfectly\r\nenclosed in the roots of the trees. And twenty-nine plants in the\r\ntable-spoonful of mud, out of the little pond; Hooker was surprised at\r\nthis, and struck with it, when I showed him how much mud I had scraped\r\noff one duck's feet.\r\n\r\nIf I did publish a short sketch, where on earth should I publish it?\r\n\r\nIf I do NOT hear, I shall understand that I may come from 9 to 10 on\r\nThursday.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. May 9th, [1856].\r\n\r\n...I very much want advice and TRUTHFUL consolation if you can give\r\nit. I had a good talk with Lyell about my species work, and he urges\r\nme strongly to publish something. I am fixed against any periodical\r\nor Journal, as I positively will NOT expose myself to an Editor or a\r\nCouncil, allowing a publication for which they might be abused. If I\r\npublish anything it must be a VERY THIN and little volume, giving\r\na sketch of my views and difficulties; but it is really dreadfully\r\nunphilosophical to give a resume, without exact references, of an\r\nunpublished work. But Lyell seemed to think I might do this, at the\r\nsuggestion of friends, and on the ground, which I might state, that I\r\nhad been at work for eighteen (The interval of eighteen years, from 1837\r\nwhen he began to collect facts, would bring the date of this letter to\r\n1855, not 1856, nevertheless the latter seems the more probable date.)\r\nyears, and yet could not publish for several years, and especially as\r\nI could point out difficulties which seemed to me to require especial\r\ninvestigation. Now what think you? I should be really grateful for\r\nadvice. I thought of giving up a couple of months and writing such a\r\nsketch, and trying to keep my judgment open whether or no to publish\r\nit when completed. It will be simply impossible for me to give exact\r\nreferences; anything important I should state on the authority of the\r\nauthor generally; and instead of giving all the facts on which I ground\r\nmy opinion, I could give by memory only one or two. In the Preface I\r\nwould state that the work could not be considered strictly scientific,\r\nbut a mere sketch or outline of a future work in which full references,\r\netc. should be given. Eheu, eheu, I believe I should sneer at any one\r\nelse doing this, and my only comfort is, that I TRULY never dreamed\r\nof it, till Lyell suggested it, and seems deliberately to think it\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\nI am in a peck of troubles and do pray forgive me for troubling you.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. May 11th [1856].\r\n\r\n...Now for a MORE IMPORTANT! subject, viz., my own self: I am extremely\r\nglad you think well of a separate \"Preliminary Essay\" (i.e., if anything\r\nwhatever is published; for Lyell seemed rather to doubt on this head)\r\n(The meaning of the sentence in parentheses is obscure.); but I cannot\r\nbear the idea of BEGGING some Editor and Council to publish, and then\r\nperhaps to have to APOLOGISE humbly for having led them into a scrape.\r\nIn this one respect I am in the state which, according to a very wise\r\nsaying of my father's, is the only fit state for asking advice, viz.,\r\nwith my mind firmly made up, and then, as my father used to say, GOOD\r\nadvice was very comfortable, and it was easy to reject BAD advice. But\r\nHeaven knows I am not in this state with respect to publishing at all\r\nany preliminary essay. It yet strikes me as quite unphilosophical\r\nto publish results without the full details which have lead to such\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy, and I hope not quite true view of yours that facts\r\nwill prove anything, and are therefore superfluous! But I have rather\r\nexaggerated, I see, your doctrine. I do not fear being tied down\r\nto error, i.e., I feel pretty sure I should give up anything false\r\npublished in the preliminary essay, in my larger work; but I may thus,\r\nit is very true, do mischief by spreading error, which as I have often\r\nheard you say is much easier spread than corrected. I confess I lean\r\nmore and more to at least making the attempt and drawing up a sketch\r\nand trying to keep my judgment, whether to publish, open. But I always\r\nreturn to my fixed idea that it is dreadfully unphilosophical to publish\r\nwithout full details. I certainly think my future work in full would\r\nprofit by hearing what my friends or critics (if reviewed) thought of\r\nthe outline.\r\n\r\nTo any one but you I should apologise for such long discussion on so\r\npersonal an affair; but I believe, and indeed you have proved it by the\r\ntrouble you have taken, that this would be superfluous.\r\n\r\nYours truly obliged, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S. What you say (for I have just re-read your letter) that the Essay\r\nmight supersede and take away all novelty and value from any future\r\nlarger Book, is very true; and that would grieve me beyond everything.\r\nOn the other hand (again from Lyell's urgent advice), I published a\r\npreliminary sketch of the Coral Theory, and this did neither good nor\r\nharm. I begin MOST HEARTILY to wish that Lyell had never put this idea\r\nof an Essay into my head.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM A LETTER TO SIR C. LYELL [July, 1856].\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted that I may say (with absolute truth) that my essay\r\nis published at your suggestion, but I hope it will not need so much\r\napology as I at first thought; for I have resolved to make it nearly as\r\ncomplete as my present materials allow. I cannot put in all which you\r\nsuggest, for it would appear too conceited.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM A LETTER TO W.D. FOX. Down, June 14th [1856].\r\n\r\n\"...What you say about my Essay, I dare say is very true; and it gave me\r\nanother fit of the wibber-gibbers: I hope that I shall succeed in making\r\nit modest. One great motive is to get information on the many points\r\non which I want it. But I tremble about it, which I should not do, if\r\nI allowed some three or four more years to elapse before publishing\r\nanything...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following extracts from letters to Mr. Fox are worth giving, as\r\nshowing how great was the accumulation of material which now had to be\r\ndealt with.\r\n\r\nJune 14th [1856].\r\n\r\n\"Very many thanks for the capital information on cats; I see I had\r\nblundered greatly, but I know I had somewhere your original notes; but\r\nmy notes are so numerous during nineteen years' collection, that it\r\nwould take me at least a year to go over and classify them.\"\r\n\r\nNovember 1856.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I fear I shall break down, for my subject gets bigger and\r\nbigger with each month's work.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL Down, 16th [June, 1856].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI am going to do the most impudent thing in the world. But my blood gets\r\nhot with passion and turns cold alternately at the geological strides,\r\nwhich many of your disciples are taking.\r\n\r\nHere, poor Forbes made a continent to [i.e., extending to] North America\r\nand another (or the same) to the Gulf weed; Hooker makes one from New\r\nZealand to South America and round the World to Kerguelen Land. Here\r\nis Wollaston speaking of Madeira and P. Santo \"as the sure and certain\r\nwitnesses of a former continent.\" Here is Woodward writes to me, if you\r\ngrant a continent over 200 or 300 miles of ocean depths (as if that was\r\nnothing), why not extend a continent to every island in the Pacific and\r\nAtlantic Oceans? And all this within the existence of recent species! If\r\nyou do not stop this, if there be a lower region for the punishment of\r\ngeologists, I believe, my great master, you will go there. Why, your\r\ndisciples in a slow and creeping manner beat all the old Catastrophists\r\nwho ever lived. You will live to be the great chief of the\r\nCatastrophists.\r\n\r\nThere, I have done myself a great deal of good, and have exploded my\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nSo my master, forgive me, and believe me, ever yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S. Don't answer this, I did it to ease myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down [June] 17th, 1856.\r\n\r\n...I have been very deeply interested by Wollaston's book ('The\r\nVariation of Species,' 1856.), though I differ GREATLY from many of his\r\ndoctrines. Did you ever read anything so rich, considering how very\r\nfar he goes, as his denunciations against those who go further: \"Most\r\nmischievous,\" \"absurd,\" \"unsound.\" Theology is at the bottom of some\r\nof this. I told him he was like Calvin burning a heretic. It is a very\r\nvaluable and clever book in my opinion. He has evidently read very\r\nlittle out of his own line. I urged him to read the New Zealand essay.\r\nHis Geology also is rather eocene, as I told him. In fact I wrote most\r\nfrankly; he says he is sure that ultra-honesty is my characteristic:\r\nI do not know whether he meant it as a sneer; I hope not. Talking\r\nof eocene geology, I got so wrath about the Atlantic continent, more\r\nespecially from a note from Woodward (who has published a capital book\r\non shells), who does not seem to doubt that every island in the Pacific\r\nand Atlantic are the remains of continents, submerged within period of\r\nexisting species, that I fairly exploded, and wrote to Lyell to protest,\r\nand summed up all the continents created of late years by Forbes (the\r\nhead sinner!) YOURSELF, Wollaston, and Woodward, and a pretty nice\r\nlittle extension of land they make altogether! I am fairly rabid on the\r\nquestion and therefore, if not wrong already, am pretty sure to become\r\nso...\r\n\r\nI have enjoyed your note much. Adios, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S. [June] 18th. Lyell has written me a CAPITAL letter on your side,\r\nwhich ought to upset me entirely, but I cannot say it does quite.\r\n\r\nThough I must try and cease being rabid and try to feel humble, and\r\nallow you all to make continents, as easily as a cook does pancakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, June 25th [1856].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI will have the following tremendous letter copied to make the reading\r\neasier, and as I want to keep a copy.\r\n\r\nAs you say you would like to hear my reasons for being most unwilling\r\nto believe in the continental extensions of late authors, I gladly write\r\nthem, as, without I am convinced of my error, I shall have to give them\r\ncondensed in my essay, when I discuss single and multiple creation; I\r\nshall therefore be particularly glad to have your general opinion on\r\nthem. I may QUITE LIKELY have persuaded myself in my wrath that there\r\nis more in them than there is. If there was much more reason to admit a\r\ncontinental extension in any one or two instances (as in Madeira) than\r\nin other cases, I should feel no difficulty whatever. But if on account\r\nof European plants, and littoral sea shells, it is thought necessary to\r\njoin Madeira to the mainland, Hooker is quite right to join New Holland\r\nto New Zealand, and Auckland Island (and Raoul Island to N.E.), and\r\nthese to S. America and the Falklands, and these to Tristan d'Acunha,\r\nand these to Kerguelen Land; thus making, either strictly at the same\r\ntime, or at different periods, but all within the life of recent\r\nbeings, an almost circumpolar belt of land. So again Galapagos and Juan\r\nFernandez must be joined to America; and if we trust to littoral see\r\nshells, the Galapagos must have been joined to the Pacific Islands (2400\r\nmiles distant) as well as to America, and as Woodward seems to think\r\nall the islands in the Pacific into a magnificent continent; also\r\nthe islands in the Southern Indian Ocean into another continent, with\r\nMadagascar and Africa, and perhaps India. In the North Atlantic, Europe\r\nwill stretch half-way across the ocean to the Azores, and further north\r\nright across. In short, we must suppose probably, half the present ocean\r\nwas land within the period of living organisms. The Globe within this\r\nperiod must have had a quite different aspect. Now the only way to\r\ntest this, that I can see, is to consider whether the continents have\r\nundergone within this same period such wonderful permutations. In all\r\nNorth and South and Central America, we have both recent and miocene (or\r\neocene) shells, quite distinct on the opposite sides, and hence I cannot\r\ndoubt that FUNDAMENTALLY America has held its place since at least, the\r\nmiocene period. In Africa almost all the living shells are distinct on\r\nthe opposite sides of the inter-tropical regions, short as the distance\r\nis compared to the range of marine mollusca, in uninterrupted seas;\r\nhence I infer that Africa has existed since our present species were\r\ncreated. Even the isthmus of Suez and the Aralo-Caspian basin have had a\r\ngreat antiquity. So I imagine, from the tertiary deposits, has India.\r\nIn Australia the great fauna of extinct marsupials shows that before the\r\npresent mammals appeared, Australia was a separate continent. I do not\r\nfor one second doubt that very large portions of all these continents\r\nhave undergone GREAT changes of level within this period, but yet I\r\nconclude that fundamentally they stood as barriers in the sea, where\r\nthey now stand; and therefore I should require the weightiest evidence\r\nto make me believe in such immense changes within the period of living\r\norganisms in our oceans, where, moreover, from the great depths, the\r\nchanges must have been vaster in a vertical sense.\r\n\r\nSECONDLY.\r\n\r\nSubmerge our present continents, leaving a few mountain peaks as\r\nislands, and what will the character of the islands be,--Consider\r\nthat the Pyrenees, Sierra Nevada, Apennines, Alps, Carpathians, are\r\nnon-volcanic, Etna and Caucasus, volcanic. In Asia, Altai and Himalaya,\r\nI believe non-volcanic. In North Africa the non-volcanic, as I imagine,\r\nAlps of Abyssinia and of the Atlas. In South Africa, the Snow Mountains.\r\nIn Australia, the non-volcanic Alps. In North America, the White\r\nMountains, Alleghanies and Rocky Mountains--some of the latter alone,\r\nI believe, volcanic. In South America to the east, the non-volcanic\r\n[Silla?] of Caracas, and Itacolumi of Brazil, further south the Sierra\r\nVentanas, and in the Cordilleras, many volcanic but not all. Now compare\r\nthese peaks with the oceanic islands; as far as known all are volcanic,\r\nexcept St. Paul's (a strange bedevilled rock), and the Seychelles,\r\nif this latter can be called oceanic, in the line of Madagascar; the\r\nFalklands, only 500 miles off, are only a shallow bank; New Caledonia,\r\nhardly oceanic, is another exception. This argument has to me great\r\nweight. Compare on a Geographical map, islands which, we have SEVERAL\r\nreasons to suppose, were connected with mainland, as Sardinia, and how\r\ndifferent it appears. Believing, as I am inclined, that continents as\r\ncontinents, and oceans as oceans, are of immense antiquity--I should\r\nsay that if any of the existing oceanic islands have any relation of any\r\nkind to continents, they are forming continents; and that by the time\r\nthey could form a continent, the volcanoes would be denuded to their\r\ncores, leaving peaks of syenite, diorite, or porphyry. But have we\r\nnowhere any last wreck of a continent, in the midst of the ocean? St.\r\nPaul's Rock, and such old battered volcanic islands, as St. Helena, may\r\nbe; but I think we can see some reason why we should have less evidence\r\nof sinking than of rising continents (if my view in my Coral volume has\r\nany truth in it, viz.: that volcanic outbursts accompany rising areas),\r\nfor during subsidence there will be no compensating agent at work, in\r\nrising areas there will be the ADDITIONAL element of outpoured volcanic\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nTHIRDLY.\r\n\r\nConsidering the depth of the ocean, I was, before I got your letter,\r\ninclined vehemently to dispute the vast amount of subsidence, but I\r\nmust strike my colours. With respect to coral reefs, I carefully guarded\r\nagainst its being supposed that a continent was indicated by the groups\r\nof atolls. It is difficult to guess, as it seems to me, the amount of\r\nsubsidence indicated by coral reefs; but in such large areas as the Lowe\r\nArchipelago, the Marshall Archipelago, and Laccadive group, it would,\r\njudging, from the heights of existing oceanic archipelagoes, be odd, if\r\nsome peaks of from 8000 to 10,000 feet had not been buried. Even after\r\nyour letter a suspicion crossed me whether it would be fair to argue\r\nfrom subsidences in the middle of the greatest oceans to continents; but\r\nrefreshing my memory by talking with Ramsay in regard to the probable\r\nthickness in one vertical line of the Silurian and carboniferous\r\nformation, it seems there must have been AT LEAST 10,000 feet of\r\nsubsidence during these formations in Europe and North America, and\r\ntherefore during the continuance of nearly the same set of organic\r\nbeings. But even 12,000 feet would not be enough for the Azores, or\r\nfor Hooker's continent; I believe Hooker does not infer a continuous\r\ncontinent, but approximate groups of islands, with, if we may judge\r\nfrom existing continents, not PROFOUNDLY deep sea between them; but\r\nthe argument from the volcanic nature of nearly every existing oceanic\r\nisland tell against such supposed groups of islands,--for I presume he\r\ndoes not suppose a mere chain of volcanic islands belting the southern\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nFOURTHLY.\r\n\r\nThe supposed continental extensions do not seem to me, perfectly to\r\naccount for all the phenomena of distribution on islands; as the absence\r\nof mammals and Batrachians; the absence of certain great groups of\r\ninsects on Madeira, and of Acaciae and Banksias, etc., in New Zealand;\r\nthe paucity of plants in some cases, etc. Not that those who believe in\r\nvarious accidental means of dispersal, can explain most of these cases;\r\nbut they may at least say that these facts seem hardly compatible with\r\nformer continuous land.\r\n\r\nFINALLY.\r\n\r\nFor these several reasons, and especially considering it certain\r\n(in which you will agree) that we are extremely ignorant of means of\r\ndispersal, I cannot avoid thinking that Forbes' 'Atlantis,' was\r\nan ill-service to science, as checking a close study of means of\r\ndissemination. I shall be really grateful to hear, as briefly as you\r\nlike, whether these arguments have any weight with you, putting yourself\r\nin the position of an honest judge. I told Hooker that I was going to\r\nwrite to you on this subject; and I should like him to read this; but\r\nwhether he or you will think it worth time and postage remains to be\r\nproved.\r\n\r\nYours most truly, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[On July 8th he wrote to Sir Charles Lyell.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry you cannot give any verdict on Continental extensions; and\r\nI infer that you think my argument of not much weight against such\r\nextensions. I know I wish I could believe so.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, July 20th [1856].\r\n\r\n...It is not a little egotistical, but I should like to tell you (and\r\nI do not THINK I have) how I view my work. Nineteen years (!) ago it\r\noccurred to me that whilst otherwise employed on Natural History,\r\nI might perhaps do good if I noted any sort of facts bearing on the\r\nquestion of the origin of species, and this I have since been doing.\r\nEither species have been independently created, or they have descended\r\nfrom other species, like varieties from one species. I think it can\r\nbe shown to be probable that man gets his most distinct varieties by\r\npreserving such as arise best worth keeping and destroying the others,\r\nbut I should fill a quire if I were to go on. To be brief, I ASSUME that\r\nspecies arise like our domestic varieties with MUCH extinction; and\r\nthen test this hypothesis by comparison with as many general and pretty\r\nwell-established propositions as I can find made out,--in geographical\r\ndistribution, geological history, affinities, etc., etc. And it seems\r\nto me that, SUPPOSING that such hypothesis were to explain such general\r\npropositions, we ought, in accordance with the common way of following\r\nall sciences, to admit it till some better hypothesis be found out. For\r\nto my mind to say that species were created so and so is no scientific\r\nexplanation, only a reverent way of saying it is so and so. But it is\r\nnonsensical trying to show how I try to proceed in the compass of a\r\nnote. But as an honest man, I must tell you that I have come to the\r\nheterodox conclusion that there are no such things as independently\r\ncreated species--that species are only strongly defined varieties. I\r\nknow that this will make you despise me. I do not much underrate the\r\nmany HUGE difficulties on this view, but yet it seems to me to explain\r\ntoo much, otherwise inexplicable, to be false. Just to allude to one\r\npoint in your last note, viz., about species of the same genus\r\nGENERALLY having a common or continuous area; if they are actual lineal\r\ndescendants of one species, this of course would be the case; and the\r\nsadly too many exceptions (for me) have to be explained by climatal\r\nand geological changes. A fortiori on this view (but on exactly\r\nsame grounds), all the individuals of the same species should have a\r\ncontinuous distribution. On this latter branch of the subject I have\r\nput a chapter together, and Hooker kindly read it over. I thought the\r\nexceptions and difficulties were so great that on the whole the balance\r\nweighed against my notions, but I was much pleased to find that it\r\nseemed to have considerable weight with Hooker, who said he had never\r\nbeen so much staggered about the permanence of species.\r\n\r\nI must say one word more in justification (for I feel sure that your\r\ntendency will be to despise me and my crotchets), that all my notions\r\nabout HOW species change are derived from long continued study of the\r\nworks of (and converse with) agriculturists and horticulturists; and\r\nI believe I see my way pretty clearly on the means used by nature\r\nto change her species and ADAPT them to the wondrous and exquisitely\r\nbeautiful contingencies to which every living being is exposed...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, July 30th 1856.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYour letter is of MUCH value to me. I was not able to get a definite\r\nanswer from Lyell (On the continental extensions of Forbes and others.),\r\nas you will see in the enclosed letters, though I inferred that\r\nhe thought nothing of my arguments. Had it not been for this\r\ncorrespondence, I should have written sadly too strongly. You may\r\nrely on it I shall put my doubts moderately. There never was such a\r\npredicament as mine: here you continental extensionists would remove\r\nenormous difficulties opposed to me, and yet I cannot honestly admit the\r\ndoctrine, and must therefore say so. I cannot get over the fact that not\r\na fragment of secondary or palaeozoic rock has been found on any island\r\nabove 500 or 600 miles from a mainland. You rather misunderstand me\r\nwhen you think I doubt the POSSIBILITY of subsidence of 20,000 or 30,000\r\nfeet; it is only probability, considering such evidence as we have\r\nindependently of distribution. I have not yet worked out in full detail\r\nthe distribution of mammalia, both IDENTICAL and allied, with respect\r\nto the ONE ELEMENT OF DEPTH OF THE SEA; but as far as I have gone, the\r\nresults are to me surprisingly accordant with my very most troublesome\r\nbelief in not such great geographical changes as you believe; and in\r\nmammalia we certainly know more of MEANS of distribution than in any\r\nother class. Nothing is so vexatious to me, as so constantly finding\r\nmyself drawing different conclusions from better judges than myself,\r\nfrom the same facts.\r\n\r\nI fancy I have lately removed many (not geographical) great difficulties\r\nopposed to my notions, but God knows it may be all hallucination.\r\n\r\nPlease return Lyell's letters.\r\n\r\nWhat a capital letter of Lyell's that to you is, and what a wonderful\r\nman he is. I differ from him greatly in thinking that those who believe\r\nthat species are NOT fixed will multiply specific names: I know in my\r\nown case my most frequent source of doubt was whether others would not\r\nthink this or that was a God-created Barnacle, and surely deserved\r\na name. Otherwise I should only have thought whether the amount of\r\ndifference and permanence was sufficient to justify a name: I am, also,\r\nsurprised at his thinking it immaterial whether species are absolute or\r\nnot: whenever it is proved that all species are produced by generation,\r\nby laws of change, what good evidence we shall have of the gaps in\r\nformations. And what a science Natural History will be, when we are\r\nin our graves, when all the laws of change are thought one of the most\r\nimportant parts of Natural History.\r\n\r\nI cannot conceive why Lyell thinks such notions as mine or of\r\n'Vestiges,' will invalidate specific centres. But I must not run on\r\nand take up your time. My MS. will not, I fear, be copied before you go\r\nabroad. With hearty thanks.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--After giving much condensed, my argument versus continental\r\nextensions, I shall append some such sentence, as that two better judges\r\nthan myself have considered these arguments, and attach no weight to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, August 5th [1856].\r\n\r\n...I quite agree about Lyell's letters to me, which, though to me\r\ninteresting, have afforded me no new light. Your letters, under the\r\nGEOLOGICAL point of view, have been more valuable to me. You cannot\r\nimagine how earnestly I wish I could swallow continental extension,\r\nbut I cannot; the more I think (and I cannot get the subject out of my\r\nhead), the more difficult I find it. If there were only some half-dozen\r\ncases, I should not feel the least difficulty; but the generality of the\r\nfacts of all islands (except one or two) having a considerable part of\r\ntheir productions in common with one or more mainlands utterly staggers\r\nme. What a wonderful case of the Epacridae! It is most vexatious, also\r\nhumiliating, to me that I cannot follow and subscribe to the way in\r\nwhich you strikingly put your view of the case. I look at your facts\r\n(about Eucalyptus, etc.) as DAMNING against continental extension, and\r\nif you like also damning against migration, or at least of ENORMOUS\r\ndifficulty. I see the ground of our difference (in a letter I must put\r\nmyself on an equality in arguing) lies, in my opinion, that scarcely\r\nanything is known of means of distribution. I quite agree with A. De\r\nCandolle's (and I dare say your) opinion that it is poor work putting\r\ntogether the merely POSSIBLE means of distribution; but I see no\r\nother way in which the subject can be attacked, for I think that A. De\r\nCandolle's argument, that no plants have been introduced into England\r\nexcept by man's agency, [is] of no weight. I cannot but think that the\r\ntheory of continental extension does do some little harm as stopping\r\ninvestigation of the means of dispersal, which, whether NEGATIVE or\r\npositive, seems to me of value; when negatived, then every one who\r\nbelieves in single centres will have to admit continental extensions.\r\n\r\n...I see from your remarks that you do not understand my notions\r\n(whether or no worth anything) about modification; I attribute very\r\nlittle to the direct action of climate, etc. I suppose, in regard to\r\nspecific centres, we are at cross purposes; I should call the kitchen\r\ngarden in which the red cabbage was produced, or the farm in which\r\nBakewell made the Shorthorn cattle, the specific centre of these\r\nSPECIES! And surely this is centralisation enough!\r\n\r\nI thank you most sincerely for all your assistance; and whether or no my\r\nbook may be wretched, you have done your best to make it less wretched.\r\nSometimes I am in very good spirits and sometimes very low about it. My\r\nown mind is decided on the question of the origin of species; but, good\r\nheavens, how little that is worth!...\r\n\r\n[With regard to \"specific centres,\" a passage from a letter dated July\r\n25, 1856, by Sir Charles Lyell to Sir J.D. Hooker ('Life' ii. page 216)\r\nis of interest:\r\n\r\n\"I fear much that if Darwin argues that species are phantoms, he will\r\nalso have to admit that single centres of dispersion are phantoms also,\r\nand that would deprive me of much of the value which I ascribe to the\r\npresent provinces of animals and plants, as illustrating modern and\r\ntertiary changes in physical geography.\"\r\n\r\nHe seems to have recognised, however, that the phantom doctrine would\r\nsoon have to be faced, for he wrote in the same letter: \"Whether Darwin\r\npersuades you and me to renounce our faith in species (when geological\r\nepochs are considered) or not, I foresee that many will go over to the\r\nindefinite modifiability doctrine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn my father was still working at geographical distribution,\r\nand again sought the aid of Sir J.D. Hooker.\r\n\r\nA LETTER TO SIR J.D. HOOKER [September, 1856].\r\n\r\n\"In the course of some weeks, you unfortunate wretch, you will have my\r\nMS. on one point of Geographical Distribution. I will however, never ask\r\nsuch a favour again; but in regard to this one piece of MS., it is of\r\ninfinite importance to me for you to see it; for never in my life have\r\nI felt such difficulty what to do, and I heartily wish I could slur the\r\nwhole subject over.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Sir J.D. Hooker (June, 1856), the following\r\ncharacteristic passage occurs, suggested, no doubt, by the kind of work\r\nwhich his chapter on Geographical Distribution entailed:\r\n\r\n\"There is wonderful ill logic in his [E. Forbes'] famous and admirable\r\nmemoir on distribution, as it appears to me, now that I have got it up\r\nso as to give the heads in a page. Depend on it, my saying is a true\r\none, viz., that a compiler is a GREAT man, and an original man a\r\ncommonplace man. Any fool can generalise and speculate; but, oh, my\r\nheavens! To get up AT SECOND HAND a New Zealand Flora, that is work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. October 3 [1856].\r\n\r\n...I remember you protested against Lyell's advice of writing a\r\nSKETCH of my species doctrines. Well, when I began I found it such\r\nunsatisfactory work that I have desisted, and am now drawing up my work\r\nas perfect as my materials of nineteen years' collecting suffice, but do\r\nnot intend to stop to perfect any line of investigation beyond current\r\nwork. Thus far and no farther I shall follow Lyell's urgent advice. Your\r\nremarks weighed with me considerably. I find to my sorrow it will run\r\nto quite a big book. I have found my careful work at pigeons really\r\ninvaluable, as enlightening me on many points on variation under\r\ndomestication. The copious old literature, by which I can trace the\r\ngradual changes in the breeds of pigeons has been extraordinarily useful\r\nto me. I have just had pigeons and fowls ALIVE from the Gambia! Rabbits\r\nand ducks I am attending to pretty carefully, but less so than pigeons.\r\nI find most remarkable differences in the skeletons of rabbits. Have you\r\never kept any odd breeds of rabbits, and can you give me any details?\r\nOne other question: You used to keep hawks; do you at all know, after\r\neating a bird, how soon after they throw up the pellet?\r\n\r\nNo subject gives me so much trouble and doubt and difficulty as the\r\nmeans of dispersal of the same species of terrestrial productions on\r\nthe oceanic islands. Land mollusca drive me mad, and I cannot anyhow get\r\ntheir eggs to experimentise their power of floating and resistance to\r\nthe injurious action of salt water. I will not apologise for writing\r\nso much about my own doings, as I believe you will like to hear. Do\r\nsometime, I beg you, let me hear how you get on in health; and IF SO\r\nINCLINED, let me have some words on call-ducks.\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox, yours affectionately, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[With regard to his book he wrote (November 10th) to Sir Charles Lyell]:\r\n\r\n\"I am working very steadily at my big book; I have found it quite\r\nimpossible to publish any preliminary essay or sketch; but am doing\r\nmy work as completely as my present materials allow without waiting to\r\nperfect them. And this much acceleration I owe to you.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Sunday [October 1856].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nThe seeds are come all safe, many thanks for them. I was very sorry to\r\nrun away so soon and miss any part of my MOST pleasant evening; and I\r\nran away like a Goth and Vandal without wishing Mrs. Hooker good-bye;\r\nbut I was only just in time, as I got on the platform the train had\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nI was particularly glad of our discussion after dinner, fighting a\r\nbattle with you always clears my mind wonderfully. I groan to hear that\r\nA. Gray agrees with you about the condition of Botanical Geography.\r\nAll I know is that if you had had to search for light in Zoological\r\nGeography you would by contrast, respect your own subject a vast deal\r\nmore than you now do. The hawks have behaved like gentlemen, and have\r\ncast up pellets with lots of seeds in them; and I have just had a parcel\r\nof partridge's feet well caked with mud!!! (The mud in such cases often\r\ncontains seeds, so that plants are thus transported.) Adios.\r\n\r\nYour insane and perverse friend, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 4th [1856].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI thank you more CORDIALLY than you will think probable, for your note.\r\nYour verdict (On the MS. relating to geographical distribution.) has\r\nbeen a great relief. On my honour I had no idea whether or not you would\r\nsay it was (and I knew you would say it very kindly) so bad, that you\r\nwould have begged me to have burnt the whole. To my own mind my MS.\r\nrelieved me of some few difficulties, and the difficulties seemed to me\r\npretty fairly stated, but I had become so bewildered with conflicting\r\nfacts, evidence, reasoning and opinions, that I felt to myself that\r\nI had lost all judgment. Your general verdict is INCOMPARABLY more\r\nfavourable than I had anticipated...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, November 23rd [1856].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI fear I shall weary you with letters, but do not answer this, for in\r\ntruth and without flattery, I so value your letters, that after a heavy\r\nbatch, as of late, I feel that I have been extravagant and have drawn\r\ntoo much money, and shall therefore have to stint myself on another\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nWhen I sent my MS. I felt strongly that some preliminary questions on\r\nthe causes of variation ought to have been sent you. Whether I am\r\nright or wrong in these points is quite a separate question, but the\r\nconclusion which I have come to, quite independently of geographical\r\ndistribution, is that external conditions (to which naturalists so often\r\nappeal) do by themselves VERY LITTLE. How much they do is the point of\r\nall others on which I feel myself very weak. I judge from the facts\r\nof variation under domestication, and I may yet get more light. But at\r\npresent, after drawing up a rough copy on this subject, my conclusion\r\nis that external conditions do EXTREMELY little, except in causing mere\r\nvariability. This mere variability (causing the child NOT closely to\r\nresemble its parent) I look at as VERY different from the formation of a\r\nmarked variety or new species. (No doubt the variability is governed\r\nby laws, some of which I am endeavouring very obscurely to trace.) The\r\nformation of a strong variety or species I look a as almost wholly due\r\nto the selection of what may be incorrectly called CHANCE variations or\r\nvariability. This power of selection stands in the most direct relation\r\nto time, and in the state of nature can be only excessively slow. Again,\r\nthe slight differences selected, by which a race or species is at last\r\nformed, stands, as I think can be shown (even with plants, and obviously\r\nwith animals), in a far more important relation to its associates than\r\nto external conditions. Therefore, according to my principles, whether\r\nright or wrong, I cannot agree with your proposition that time, and\r\naltered conditions, and altered associates, are 'convertible terms.'\r\nI look at the first and the last as FAR more important: time being\r\nimportant only so far as giving scope to selection. God knows whether\r\nyou will perceive at what I am driving. I shall have to discuss and\r\nthink more about your difficulty of the temperate and sub-arctic forms\r\nin the S. hemisphere than I have yet done. But I am inclined to think\r\nthat I am right (if my general principles are right), that there would\r\nbe little tendency to the formation of a new species, during the period\r\nof migration, whether shorter or longer, though considerable variability\r\nmay have supervened...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. December 24th [1856].\r\n\r\n...How I do wish I lived near you to discuss matters with. I have\r\njust been comparing definitions of species, and stating briefly how\r\nsystematic naturalists work out their subjects. Aquilegia in the Flora\r\nIndica was a capital example for me. It is really laughable to see what\r\ndifferent ideas are prominent in various naturalists' minds, when they\r\nspeak of \"species;\" in some, resemblance is everything and descent\r\nof little weight--in some, resemblance seems to go for nothing, and\r\nCreation the reigning idea--in some, descent is the key,--in some,\r\nsterility an unfailing test, with others it is not worth a farthing. It\r\nall comes, I believe, from trying to define the undefinable. I\r\nsuppose you have lost the odd black seed from the birds' dung, which\r\ngerminated,--anyhow, it is not worth taking trouble over. I have now got\r\nabout a dozen seeds out of small birds' dung. Adios,\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker, ever yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, January 1st [1857?].\r\n\r\nMy dear Dr Gray,\r\n\r\nI have received the second part of your paper ('Statistics of the Flora\r\nof the Northern United States.' \"Silliman's Journal\", 1857.), and though\r\nI have nothing particular to say, I must send you my thanks and hearty\r\nadmiration. The whole paper strikes me as quite exhausting the subject,\r\nand I quite fancy and flatter myself I now appreciate the character\r\nof your Flora. What a difference in regard to Europe your remark in\r\nrelation to the genera makes! I have been eminently glad to see your\r\nconclusion in regard to the species of large genera widely ranging; it\r\nis in strict conformity with the results I have worked out in several\r\nways. It is of great importance to my notions. By the way you have\r\npaid me a GREAT compliment (\"From some investigations of his own, this\r\nsagacious naturalist inclines to think that [the species of] large\r\ngenera range over a larger area than the species of small genera\r\ndo.\"--Asa Gray, loc. cit.): to be SIMPLY mentioned even in such a paper\r\nI consider a very great honour. One of your conclusions makes me groan,\r\nviz., that the line of connection of the strictly alpine plants is\r\nthrough Greenland. I should EXTREMELY like to see your reasons published\r\nin detail, for it \"riles\" me (this is a proper expression, is it not?)\r\ndreadfully. Lyell told me, that Agassiz having a theory about when\r\nSaurians were first created, on hearing some careful observations\r\nopposed to this, said he did not believe it, \"for Nature never lied.\"\r\nI am just in this predicament, and repeat to you that, \"Nature never\r\nlies,\" ergo, theorisers are always right...\r\n\r\nOverworked as you are, I dare say you will say that I am an odious\r\nplague; but here is another suggestion! I was led by one of my wild\r\nspeculations to conclude (though it has nothing to do with geographical\r\ndistribution, yet it has with your statistics) that trees would have a\r\nstrong tendency to have flowers with dioecious, monoecious or polygamous\r\nstructure. Seeing that this seemed so in Persoon, I took one little\r\nBritish Flora, and discriminating trees from bushes according to Loudon,\r\nI have found that the result was in species, genera and families, as I\r\nanticipated. So I sent my notions to Hooker to ask him to tabulate the\r\nNew Zealand Flora for this end, and he thought my result sufficiently\r\ncurious, to do so; and the accordance with Britain is very striking, and\r\nthe more so, as he made three classes of trees, bushes, and herbaceous\r\nplants. (He says further he shall work the Tasmanian Flora on the same\r\nprinciple.) The bushes hold an intermediate position between the other\r\ntwo classes. It seems to me a curious relation in itself, and is very\r\nmuch so, if my theory and explanation are correct. (See 'Origin,'\r\nEdition i., page 100.)\r\n\r\nWith hearty thanks, your most troublesome friend, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 12th [1857].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYour letter has pleased me much, for I never can get it out of my head,\r\nthat I take unfair advantage of your kindness, as I receive all and give\r\nnothing. What a splendid discussion you could write on the whole subject\r\nof variation! The cases discussed in your last note are valuable to me\r\n(though odious and damnable), as showing how profoundly ignorant we are\r\non the causes of variation. I shall just allude to these cases, as a\r\nsort of sub-division of polymorphism a little more definite, I fancy,\r\nthan the variation of, for instance, the Rubi, and equally or more\r\nperplexing.\r\n\r\nI have just been putting my notes together on variations APPARENTLY due\r\nto the immediate and direct action of external causes; and I have been\r\nstruck with one result. The most firm sticklers for independent creation\r\nadmit, that the fur of the SAME species is thinner towards the south of\r\nthe range of the same species than to the north--that the SAME shells\r\nare brighter-coloured to the south than north; that the same [shell]\r\nis paler-coloured in deep water--that insects are smaller and darker on\r\nmountains--more livid and testaceous near sea--that plants are smaller\r\nand more hairy and with brighter flowers on mountains: now in all such,\r\nand other cases, distinct species in the two zones follow the same rule,\r\nwhich seems to me to be most simply explained by species, being only\r\nstrongly marked varieties, and therefore following the same laws as\r\nrecognised and admitted varieties. I mention all this on account of the\r\nvariation of plants in ascending mountains; I have quoted the foregoing\r\nremark only generally with no examples, for I add, there is so much\r\ndoubt and dispute what to call varieties; but yet I have stumbled on\r\nso many casual remarks on VARIETIES of plants on mountains being so\r\ncharacterised, that I presume there is some truth in it. What think\r\nyou? Do you believe there is ANY tendency in VARIETIES, as GENERALLY\r\nso-called, of plants to become more hairy and with proportionally larger\r\nand brighter-coloured flowers in ascending a mountain?\r\n\r\nI have been interested in my \"weed garden,\" of 3 x 2 feet square: I mark\r\neach seedling as it appears, and I am astonished at the number that come\r\nup, and still more at the number killed by slugs, etc. Already 59 have\r\nbeen so killed; I expected a good many, but I had fancied that this\r\nwas a less potent check than it seems to be, and I attributed almost\r\nexclusively to mere choking, the destruction of the seedlings.\r\nGrass-seedlings seem to suffer much less than exogens...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Moor Park, Farnham [April (?) 1857].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYour letter has been forwarded to me here, where I am undergoing\r\nhydropathy for a fortnight, having been here a week, and having already\r\nreceived an amount of good which is quite incredible to myself and quite\r\nunaccountable. I can walk and eat like a hearty Christian, and even my\r\nnights are good. I cannot in the least understand how hydropathy can act\r\nas it certainly does on me. It dulls one's brain splendidly; I have not\r\nthought about a single species of any kind since leaving home. Your note\r\nhas taken me aback; I thought the hairiness, etc., of Alpine SPECIES\r\nwas generally admitted; I am sure I have seen it alluded to a score of\r\ntimes. Falconer was haranguing on it the other day to me. Meyen or Gay,\r\nor some such fellow (whom you would despise), I remember, makes some\r\nremark on Chilian Cordillera plants. Wimmer has written a little book on\r\nthe same lines, and on VARIETIES being so characterised in the Alps.\r\nBut after writing to you, I confess I was staggered by finding one\r\nman (Moquin-Tandon, I think) saying that Alpine flowers are strongly\r\ninclined to be white, and Linnaeus saying that cold makes plants\r\nAPETALOUS, even the same species! Are Arctic plants often apetalous? My\r\ngeneral belief from my compiling work is quite to agree with what\r\nyou say about the little direct influence of climate; and I have\r\njust alluded to the hairiness of Alpine plants as an EXCEPTION. The\r\nodoriferousness would be a good case for me if I knew of VARIETIES being\r\nmore odoriferous in dry habitats.\r\n\r\nI fear that I have looked at the hairiness of Alpine plants as so\r\ngenerally acknowledged that I have not marked passages, so as at all\r\nto see what kind of evidence authors advance. I must confess, the other\r\nday, when I asked Falconer, whether he knew of INDIVIDUAL plants losing\r\nor acquiring hairiness when transported, he did not. But now THIS\r\nSECOND, my memory flashes on me, and I am certain I have somewhere\r\ngot marked a case of hairy plants from the Pyrenees losing hairs when\r\ncultivated at Montpellier. Shall you think me very impudent if I tell\r\nyou that I have sometimes thought that (quite independently of the\r\npresent case), you are a little too hard on bad observers; that a remark\r\nmade by a bad observer CANNOT be right; an observer who deserves to be\r\ndamned you would utterly damn. I feel entire deference to any remark you\r\nmake out of your own head; but when in opposition to some poor devil, I\r\nsomehow involuntarily feel not quite so much, but yet much deference for\r\nyour opinion. I do not know in the least whether there is any truth in\r\nthis my criticism against you, but I have often thought I would tell you\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI am really very much obliged for your letter, for, though I intended to\r\nput only one sentence and that vaguely, I should probably have put that\r\nmuch too strongly.\r\n\r\nEver, my dear Hooker, yours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S. This note, as you see, has not anything requiring an answer.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of fresh-water molluscs has been a horrid incubus to\r\nme, but I think I know my way now; when first hatched they are very\r\nactive, and I have had thirty or forty crawl on a dead duck's foot; and\r\nthey cannot be jerked off, and will live fifteen and even twenty-four\r\nhours out of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter refers to the expedition of the Austrian frigate\r\n\"Novara\"; Lyell had asked my father for suggestions.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, February 11th [1857].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI was glad to see in the newspapers about the Austrian Expedition. I\r\nhave nothing to add geologically to my notes in the Manual. (The article\r\n\"Geology\" in the Admiralty Manual of Scientific Enquiry.) I do not know\r\nwhether the Expedition is tied down to call at only fixed spots. But\r\nif there be any choice or power in the scientific men to influence\r\nthe places--this would be most desirable. It is my most deliberate\r\nconviction that nothing would aid more, Natural History, than careful\r\ncollecting and investigating ALL THE PRODUCTIONS of the most isolated\r\nislands, especially of the southern hemisphere. Except Tristan d'Acunha\r\nand Kerguelen Land, they are very imperfectly known; and even at\r\nKerguelen Land, how much there is to make out about the lignite beds,\r\nand whether there are signs of old Glacial action. Every sea shell and\r\ninsect and plant is of value from such spots. Some one in the Expedition\r\nespecially ought to have Hooker's New Zealand Essay. What grand work to\r\nexplore Rodriguez, with its fossil birds, and little known productions\r\nof every kind. Again the Seychelles, which, with the Cocos so near, must\r\nbe a remnant of some older land. The outer island of Juan Fernandez\r\nis little known. The investigation of these little spots by a band of\r\nnaturalists would be grand; St. Paul's and Amsterdam would be glorious,\r\nbotanically, and geologically. Can you not recommend them to get my\r\n'Journal' and 'Volcanic Islands' on account of the Galapagos. If they\r\ncome from the north it will be a shame and a sin if they do not call\r\nat Cocos Islet, one of the Galapagos. I always regretted that I was\r\nnot able to examine the great craters on Albemarle Island, one of the\r\nGalapagos. In New Zealand urge on them to look out for erratic boulders\r\nand marks of old glaciers.\r\n\r\nUrge the use of the dredge in the Tropics; how little or nothing we know\r\nof the limit of life downward in the hot seas?\r\n\r\nMy present work leads me to perceive how much the domestic animals have\r\nbeen neglected in out of the way countries.\r\n\r\nThe Revillagigedo Island off Mexico, I believe, has never been trodden\r\nby foot of naturalist.\r\n\r\nIf the expedition sticks to such places as Rio, Cape of Good Hope,\r\nCeylon and Australia, etc., it will not do much.\r\n\r\nEver yours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following passage occurs in a letter to Mr. Fox, February 22, 1857,\r\nand has reference to the book on Evolution on which he was still at\r\nwork. The remainder of the letter is made up in details of no interest:\r\n\r\n\"I am got most deeply interested in my subject; though I wish I could\r\nset less value on the bauble fame, either present or posthumous, than\r\nI do, but not I think, to any extreme degree: yet, if I know myself, I\r\nwould work just as hard, though with less gusto, if I knew that my book\r\nwould be published for ever anonymously.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Moor Park, May 1st, 1857.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your letter of October 10th, from Celebes,\r\nreceived a few days ago; in a laborious undertaking, sympathy is a\r\nvaluable and real encouragement. By your letter and even still more\r\nby your paper ('On the law that has regulated the introduction of new\r\nspecies.'--Ann. Nat. Hist., 1855.) in the Annals, a year or more ago, I\r\ncan plainly see that we have thought much alike and to a certain extent\r\nhave come to similar conclusions. In regard to the Paper in the Annals,\r\nI agree to the truth of almost every word of your paper; and I dare\r\nsay that you will agree with me that it is very rare to find oneself\r\nagreeing pretty closely with any theoretical paper; for it is lamentable\r\nhow each man draws his own different conclusions from the very same\r\nfacts. This summer will make the 20th year (!) since I opened my first\r\nnote-book, on the question how and in what way do species and varieties\r\ndiffer from each other. I am now preparing my work for publication,\r\nbut I find the subject so very large, that though I have written many\r\nchapters, I do not suppose I shall go to press for two years. I have\r\nnever heard how long you intend staying in the Malay Archipelago; I wish\r\nI might profit by the publication of your Travels there before my work\r\nappears, for no doubt you will reap a large harvest of facts. I have\r\nacted already in accordance with your advice of keeping domestic\r\nvarieties, and those appearing in a state of nature, distinct; but I\r\nhave sometimes doubted of the wisdom of this, and therefore I am glad to\r\nbe backed by your opinion. I must confess, however, I rather doubt the\r\ntruth of the now very prevalent doctrine of all our domestic animals\r\nhaving descended from several wild stocks; though I do not doubt that\r\nit is so in some cases. I think there is rather better evidence on the\r\nsterility of hybrid animals than you seem to admit: and in regard to\r\nplants the collection of carefully recorded facts by Kolreuter and\r\nGaertner (and Herbert,) is ENORMOUS. I most entirely agree with you on\r\nthe little effects of \"climatal conditions,\" which one sees referred\r\nto ad nauseam in all books: I suppose some very little effect must be\r\nattributed to such influences, but I fully believe that they are very\r\nslight. It is really IMPOSSIBLE to explain my views (in the compass of a\r\nletter), on the causes and means of variation in a state of nature; but\r\nI have slowly adopted a distinct and tangible idea,--whether true or\r\nfalse others must judge; for the firmest conviction of the truth of a\r\ndoctrine by its author, seems, alas, not to be the slightest guarantee\r\nof truth!...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Moor Park, Saturday [May 2nd, 1857].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYou have shaved the hair off the Alpine plants pretty effectually.\r\nThe case of the Anthyllis will make a \"tie\" with the believed case of\r\nPyrenees plants becoming glabrous at low levels. If I DO find that I\r\nhave marked such facts, I will lay the evidence before you. I wonder how\r\nthe belief could have originated! Was it through final causes to keep\r\nthe plants warm? Falconer in talk coupled the two facts of woolly Alpine\r\nplants and mammals. How candidly and meekly you took my Jeremiad on your\r\nseverity to second-class men. After I had sent it off, an ugly little\r\nvoice asked me, once or twice, how much of my noble defence of the\r\npoor in spirit and in fact, was owing to your having not seldom smashed\r\nfavourite notions of my own. I silenced the ugly little voice with\r\ncontempt, but it would whisper again and again. I sometimes despise\r\nmyself as a poor compiler as heartily as you could do, though I do\r\nNOT despise my whole work, as I think there is enough known to lay a\r\nfoundation for the discussion on the origin of species. I have been led\r\nto despise and laugh at myself as a compiler, for having put down that\r\n\"Alpine plants have large flowers,\" and now perhaps I may write over\r\nthese very words, \"Alpine plants have small or apetalous flowers!\"...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [May] 16th [1857].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYou said--I hope honestly--that you did not dislike my asking questions\r\non general points, you of course answering or not as time or inclination\r\nmight serve. I find in the animal kingdom that the proposition that any\r\npart or organ developed normally (i.e., not a monstrosity) in a species\r\nin any HIGH or UNUSUAL degree, compared with the same part or organ in\r\nallied species, tends to be HIGHLY VARIABLE. I cannot doubt this from\r\nmy mass of collected facts. To give an instance, the Cross-bill is\r\nvery abnormal in the structure of its bill compared with other allied\r\nFringillidae, and the beak is EMINENTLY VARIABLE. The Himantopus,\r\nremarkable from the wonderful length of its legs, is VERY variable in\r\nthe length of its legs. I could give MANY most striking and curious\r\nillustrations in all classes; so many that I think it cannot be chance.\r\nBut I have NONE in the vegetable kingdom, owing, as I believe, to my\r\nignorance. If Nepenthes consisted of ONE or two species in a group with\r\na pitcher developed, then I should have expected it to have been very\r\nvariable; but I do not consider Nepenthes a case in point, for when a\r\nwhole genus or group has an organ, however anomalous, I do not expect\r\nit to be variable,--it is only when one or few species differ greatly in\r\nsome one part or organ from the forms CLOSELY ALLIED to it in all other\r\nrespects, that I believe such part or organ to be highly variable. Will\r\nyou turn this in your mind? It is an important apparent LAW (!) for me.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I do not know how far you will care to hear, but I find\r\nMoquin-Tandon treats in his 'Teratologie' on villosity of plants, and\r\nseems to attribute more to dryness than altitude; but seems to think\r\nthat it must be admitted that mountain plants are villose, and that this\r\nvillosity is only in part explained by De Candolle's remark that the\r\ndwarfed condition of mountain plants would condense the hairs, and\r\nso give them the APPEARANCE of being more hairy. He quotes Senebier,\r\n'Physiologie Vegetale,' as authority--I suppose the first authority, for\r\nmountain plants being hairy.\r\n\r\nIf I could show positively that the endemic species were more hairy in\r\ndry districts, then the case of the varieties becoming more hairy in dry\r\nground would be a fact for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, June 3rd [1857].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI am going to enjoy myself by having a prose on my own subjects to you,\r\nand this is a greater enjoyment to me than you will readily understand,\r\nas I for months together do not open my mouth on Natural History.\r\nYour letter is of great value to me, and staggers me in regard to my\r\nproposition. I dare say the absence of botanical facts may in part be\r\naccounted for by the difficulty of measuring slight variations. Indeed,\r\nafter writing, this occurred to me; for I have Crucianella stylosa\r\ncoming into flower, and the pistil ought to be very variable in length,\r\nand thinking of this I at once felt how could one judge whether it was\r\nvariable in any high degree. How different, for instance, from the\r\nbeak of a bird! But I am not satisfied with this explanation, and am\r\nstaggered. Yet I think there is something in the law; I have had so\r\nmany instances, as the following: I wrote to Wollaston to ask him to\r\nrun through the Madeira Beetles and tell me whether any one presented\r\nanything very anomalous in relation to its allies. He gave me a unique\r\ncase of an enormous head in a female, and then I found in his book,\r\nalready stated, that the size of the head was ASTONISHINGLY variable.\r\nPart of the difference with plants may be accounted for by many of\r\nmy cases being secondary male or FEMALE characters, but then I have\r\nstriking cases with hermaphrodite Cirripedes. The cases seem to me\r\nfar too numerous for accidental coincidences, of great variability and\r\nabnormal development. I presume that you will not object to my putting a\r\nnote saying that you had reflected over the case, and though one or\r\ntwo cases seemed to support, quite as many or more seemed wholly\r\ncontradictory. This want of evidence is the more surprising to me, as\r\ngenerally I find any proposition more easily tested by observations in\r\nbotanical works, which I have picked up, than in zoological works. I\r\nnever dreamed that you had kept the subject at all before your\r\nmind. Altogether the case is one more of my MANY horrid puzzles. My\r\nobservations, though on so infinitely a small scale, on the struggle for\r\nexistence, begin to make me see a little clearer how the fight goes on.\r\nOut of sixteen kinds of seed sown on my meadow, fifteen have germinated,\r\nbut now they are perishing at such a rate that I doubt whether more than\r\none will flower. Here we have choking which has taken place likewise on\r\na great scale, with plants not seedlings, in a bit of my lawn allowed\r\nto grow up. On the other hand, in a bit of ground, 2 by 3 feet, I have\r\ndaily marked each seedling weed as it has appeared during March, April\r\nand May, and 357 have come up, and of these 277 have ALREADY been killed\r\nchiefly by slugs. By the way, at Moor Park, I saw rather a pretty case\r\nof the effects of animals on vegetation: there are enormous commons with\r\nclumps of old Scotch firs on the hills, and about eight or ten years ago\r\nsome of these commons were enclosed, and all round the clumps nice young\r\ntrees are springing up by the million, looking exactly as if planted,\r\nso many are of the same age. In other parts of the common, not yet\r\nenclosed, I looked for miles and not ONE young tree could be seen.\r\nI then went near (within quarter of a mile of the clumps) and looked\r\nclosely in the heather, and there I found tens of thousands of young\r\nScotch firs (thirty in one square yard) with their tops nibbled off by\r\nthe few cattle which occasionally roam over these wretched heaths. One\r\nlittle tree, three inches high, by the rings appeared to be twenty-six\r\nyears old, with a short stem about as thick as a stick of sealing-wax.\r\nWhat a wondrous problem it is, what a play of forces, determining the\r\nkind and proportion of each plant in a square yard of turf! It is to my\r\nmind truly wonderful. And yet we are pleased to wonder when some animal\r\nor plant becomes extinct.\r\n\r\nI am so sorry that you will not be at the Club. I see Mrs. Hooker is\r\ngoing to Yarmouth; I trust that the health of your children is not the\r\nmotive. Good-bye.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker, ever yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I believe you are afraid to send me a ripe Edwardsia pod, for fear\r\nI should float it from New Zealand to Chile!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, June 5 [1857].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI honour your conscientious care about the medals. (The Royal Society's\r\nmedals.) Thank God! I am only an amateur (but a much interested one) on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nIt is an old notion of mine that more good is done by giving medals to\r\nyounger men in the early part of their career, than as a mere reward to\r\nmen whose scientific career is nearly finished. Whether medals ever do\r\nany good is a question which does not concern us, as there the medals\r\nare. I am almost inclined to think that I would rather lower the\r\nstandard, and give medals to young workers than to old ones with\r\nno ESPECIAL claims. With regard to especial claims, I think it just\r\ndeserving your attention, that if general claims are once admitted, it\r\nopens the door to great laxity in giving them. Think of the case of\r\na very rich man, who aided SOLELY with his money, but to a grand\r\nextent--or such an inconceivable prodigy as a minister of the Crown who\r\nreally cared for science. Would you give such men medals? Perhaps medals\r\ncould not be better applied than EXCLUSIVELY to such men. I confess at\r\npresent I incline to stick to especial claims which can be put down on\r\npaper...\r\n\r\nI am much confounded by your showing that there are not obvious\r\ninstances of my (or rather Waterhouse's) law of abnormal developments\r\nbeing highly variable. I have been thinking more of your remark about\r\nthe difficulty of judging or comparing variability in plants from the\r\ngreat general variability of parts. I should look at the law as more\r\ncompletely smashed if you would turn in your mind for a little while\r\nfor cases of great variability of an organ, and tell me whether it is\r\nmoderately easy to pick out such cases; For IF THEY CAN BE PICKED\r\nOUT, and, notwithstanding, do not coincide with great or abnormal\r\ndevelopment, it would be a complete smasher. It is only beginning in\r\nyour mind at the variability end of the question instead of at the\r\nabnormality end. PERHAPS cases in which a part is highly variable in all\r\nthe species of a group should be excluded, as possibly being something\r\ndistinct, and connected with the perplexing subject of polymorphism.\r\nWill you perfect your assistance by further considering, for a little,\r\nthe subject this way?\r\n\r\nI have been so much interested this morning in comparing all my notes on\r\nthe variation of the several species of the genus Equus and the results\r\nof their crossing. Taking most strictly analogous facts amongst the\r\nblessed pigeons for my guide, I believe I can plainly see the colouring\r\nand marks of the grandfather of the Ass, Horse, Quagga, Hemionus and\r\nZebra, some millions of generations ago! Should not I [have] sneer[ed]\r\nat any one who made such a remark to me a few years ago; but my evidence\r\nseems to me so good that I shall publish my vision at the end of my\r\nlittle discussion on this genus.\r\n\r\nI have of late inundated you with my notions, you best of friends and\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\nAdios, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Moor Park, Farnham, June 25th [1857].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nThis requires no answer, but I will ask you whenever we meet. Look at\r\nenclosed seedling gorses, especially one with the top knocked off. The\r\nleaves succeeding the cotyledons being almost clover-like in shape,\r\nseems to me feebly analogous to embryonic resemblances in young animals,\r\nas, for instance, the young lion being striped. I shall ask you whether\r\nthis is so...(See 'Power of Movement in Plants,' page 414.)\r\n\r\nDr. Lane (The physician at Moor Park.) and wife, and mother-in-law, Lady\r\nDrysdale, are some of the nicest people I ever met.\r\n\r\nI return home on the 30th. Good-bye, my dear Hooker.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Here follows a group of letters, of various dates, bearing on the\r\nquestion of large genera varying.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. March 11th [1858].\r\n\r\nI was led to all this work by a remark of Fries, that the species in\r\nlarge genera were more closely related to each other than in small\r\ngenera; and if this were so, seeing that varieties and species are so\r\nhardly distinguishable, I concluded that I should find more varieties\r\nin the large genera than in the small...Some day I hope you will read\r\nmy short discussion on the whole subject. You have done me infinite\r\nservice, whatever opinion I come to, in drawing my attention to at least\r\nthe possibility or the probability of botanists recording more varieties\r\nin the large than in the small genera. It will be hard work for me to be\r\ncandid in coming to my conclusion.\r\n\r\nEver yours, most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I shall be several weeks at my present job. The work has been\r\nturning out badly for me this morning, and I am sick at heart; and, oh!\r\nhow I do hate species and varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. July 14th [1857?].\r\n\r\n...I write now to supplicate most earnestly a favour, viz., the loan of\r\n\"Boreau, Flore du centre de la France\", either 1st or 2nd edition,\r\nlast best; also \"Flora Ratisbonensis,\" by Dr. Furnrohr, in 'Naturhist.\r\nTopographie von Regensburg, 1839.' If you can POSSIBLY spare them, will\r\nyou send them at once to the enclosed address. If you have not them,\r\nwill you send one line by return of post: as I must try whether\r\nKippist (The late Mr. Kippist was at this time in charge of the Linnean\r\nSociety's Library.) can anyhow find them, which I fear will be nearly\r\nimpossible in the Linnean Library, in which I know they are.\r\n\r\nI have been making some calculations about varieties, etc., and talking\r\nyesterday with Lubbock, he has pointed out to me the grossest blunder\r\nwhich I have made in principle, and which entails two or three weeks'\r\nlost work; and I am at a dead-lock till I have these books to go over\r\nagain, and see what the result of calculation on the right principle is.\r\nI am the most miserable, bemuddled, stupid dog in all England, and am\r\nready to cry with vexation at my blindness and presumption.\r\n\r\nEver yours, most miserably, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO JOHN LUBBOCK. Down, [July] 14th [1857].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lubbock,\r\n\r\nYou have done me the greatest possible service in helping me to clarify\r\nmy brains. If I am as muzzy on all subjects as I am on proportion and\r\nchance,--what a book I shall produce!\r\n\r\nI have divided the New Zealand Flora as you suggested, there are 329\r\nspecies in genera of 4 and upwards, and 323 in genera of 3 and less.\r\n\r\nThe 339 species have 51 species presenting one or more varieties. The\r\n323 species have only 37. Proportionately (339: 323:: 51: 48.5) they\r\nought to have had 48 1/2 species presenting vars. So that the case goes\r\nas I want it, but not strong enough, without it be general, for me to\r\nhave much confidence in. I am quite convinced yours is the right way; I\r\nhad thought of it, but should never have done it had it not been for my\r\nmost fortunate conversation with you.\r\n\r\nUn quite shocked to find how easily I am muddled, for I had before\r\nthought over the subject much, and concluded my way was fair. It is\r\ndreadfully erroneous.\r\n\r\nWhat a disgraceful blunder you have saved me from. I heartily thank you.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--It is enough to make me tear up all my MS. and give up in despair.\r\n\r\nIt will take me several weeks to go over all my materials. But oh, if\r\nyou knew how thankful I am to you!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, August [1857].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nIt is a horrid bore you cannot come soon, and I reproach myself that\r\nI did not write sooner. How busy you must be! with such a heap of\r\nbotanists at Kew. Only think, I have just had a letter from Henslow,\r\nsaying he will come here between 11th and 15th! Is not that grand? Many\r\nthanks about Furnrohr. I must humbly supplicate Kippist to search for\r\nit: he most kindly got Boreau for me.\r\n\r\nI am got extremely interested in tabulating, according to mere size\r\nof genera, the species having any varieties marked by Greek letters or\r\notherwise: the result (as far as I have yet gone) seems to me one of the\r\nmost important arguments I have yet met with, that varieties are only\r\nsmall species--or species only strongly marked varieties. The subject\r\nis in many ways so very important for me; I wish much you would think of\r\nany well-worked Floras with from 1000-2000 species, with the varieties\r\nmarked. It is good to have hair-splitters and lumpers. (Those who\r\nmake many species are the \"splitters,\" and those who make few are the\r\n\"lumpers.\") I have done, or am doing:--\r\n\r\n  Babington.......................\r\n  Henslow.........................\r\n  British Flora. London Catalogue. H.C. Watson...\r\n\r\n  Boreau.......................... France.\r\n\r\n  Miquel.......................... Holland.\r\n\r\n  Asa Gray........................ N.U. States.\r\n\r\n  Hooker.......................... New Zealand.\r\n                                    Fragment of Indian Flora.\r\n\r\n  Wollaston....................... Madeira insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nHas not Koch published a good German Flora? Does he mark varieties?\r\nCould you send it me? Is there not some grand Russian Flora, which\r\nperhaps has varieties marked? The Floras ought to be well known.\r\n\r\nI am in no hurry for a few weeks. Will you turn this in your head when,\r\nif ever, you have leisure? The subject is very important for my work,\r\nthough I clearly see MANY causes of error...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, February 21st [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nMy last letter begged no favour, this one does: but it will really cost\r\nyou very little trouble to answer to me, and it will be of very GREAT\r\nservice to me, owing to a remark made to me by Hooker, which I cannot\r\ncredit, and which was suggested to him by one of my letters. He\r\nsuggested my asking you, and I told him I would not give the least\r\nhint what he thought. I generally believe Hooker implicitly, but he is\r\nsometimes, I think, and he confesses it, rather over critical, and\r\nhis ingenuity in discovering flaws seems to me admirable. Here is my\r\nquestion:--\"Do you think that good botanists in drawing up a local\r\nFlora, whether small or large, or in making a Prodromus like De\r\nCandolle's, would almost universally, but unintentionally and\r\nunconsciously, tend to record (i.e., marking with Greek letters and\r\ngiving short characters) varieties in the large or in the small genera?\r\nOr would the tendency be to record the varieties about equally in genera\r\nof all sizes? Are you yourself conscious on reflection that you have\r\nattended to, and recorded more carefully the varieties in large or\r\nsmall, or very small genera?\"\r\n\r\nI know what fleeting and trifling things varieties very often are;\r\nbut my query applies to such as have been thought worth marking and\r\nrecording. If you could screw time to send me ever so brief an answer to\r\nthis, pretty soon, it would be a great service to me.\r\n\r\nYours most truly obliged, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Do you know whether any one has ever published any remarks on the\r\ngeographical range of varieties of plants in comparison with the species\r\nto which they are supposed to belong? I have in vain tried to get some\r\nvague idea, and with the exception of a little information on this head\r\ngiven me by Mr. Watson in a paper on Land Shells in United States, I\r\nhave quite failed; but perhaps it would be difficult for you to give me\r\neven a brief answer on this head, and if so I am not so unreasonable, I\r\nASSURE YOU, as to expect it.\r\n\r\nIf you are writing to England soon, you could enclose other letters\r\n[for] me to forward.\r\n\r\nPlease observe the question is not whether there are more or fewer\r\nvarieties in larger or smaller genera, but whether there is a stronger\r\nor weaker tendency in the minds of botanists to RECORD such in large or\r\nsmall genera.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 6th [1858].\r\n\r\n...I send by this post my MS. on the \"commonness,\" \"range,\" and\r\n\"variation\" of species in large and small genera. You have undertaken\r\na horrid job in so very kindly offering to read it, and I thank you\r\nwarmly. I have just corrected the copy, and am disappointed in finding\r\nhow tough and obscure it is; I cannot make it clearer, and at present\r\nI loathe the very sight of it. The style of course requires further\r\ncorrection, and if published I must try, but as yet see not how, to make\r\nit clearer.\r\n\r\nIf you have much to say and can have patience to consider the whole\r\nsubject, I would meet you in London on the Phil. Club day, so as to save\r\nyou the trouble of writing. For Heaven's sake, you stern and awful judge\r\nand sceptic, remember that my conclusions may be true, notwithstanding\r\nthat Botanists may have recorded more varieties in large than in small\r\ngenera. It seems to me a mere balancing of probabilities. Again I thank\r\nyou most sincerely, but I fear you will find it a horrid job.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--As usual, Hydropathy has made a man of me for a short time: I hope\r\nthe sea will do Mrs. Hooker much good.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, December 22nd, 1857.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI thank you for your letter of September 27th. I am extremely glad\r\nto hear how you are attending to distribution in accordance with\r\ntheoretical ideas. I am a firm believer that without speculation there\r\nis no good and original observation. Few travellers have attended to\r\nsuch points as you are now at work on; and, indeed, the whole subject\r\nof distribution of animals is dreadfully behind that of plants. You say\r\nthat you have been somewhat surprised at no notice having been taken\r\nof your paper in the Annals. ('On the law that has regulated the\r\nintroduction of New Species.' Ann. Nat. Hist., 1855.) I cannot say that\r\nI am, for so very few naturalists care for anything beyond the mere\r\ndescription of species. But you must not suppose that your paper has not\r\nbeen attended to: two very good men, Sir C. Lyell, and Mr. E. Blyth at\r\nCalcutta, specially called my attention to it. Though agreeing with you\r\non your conclusions in that paper, I believe I go much further than you;\r\nbut it is too long a subject to enter on my speculative notions. I\r\nhave not yet seen your paper on the distribution of animals in the Aru\r\nIslands. I shall read it with the utmost interest; for I think that the\r\nmost interesting quarter of the whole globe in respect to distribution,\r\nand I have long been very imperfectly trying to collect data for the\r\nMalay Archipelago. I shall be quite prepared to subscribe to your\r\ndoctrine of subsidence; indeed, from the quite independent evidence of\r\nthe Coral Reefs I coloured my original map (in my Coral volume) of\r\nthe Aru Islands as one of subsidence, but got frightened and left it\r\nuncoloured. But I can see that you are inclined to go much further\r\nthan I am in regard to the former connection of oceanic islands with\r\ncontinents. Ever since poor E. Forbes propounded this doctrine it has\r\nbeen eagerly followed; and Hooker elaborately discusses the former\r\nconnection of all the Antarctic Islands and New Zealand and South\r\nAmerica. About a year ago I discussed this subject much with Lyell and\r\nHooker (for I shall have to treat of it), and wrote out my arguments in\r\nopposition; but you will be glad to hear that neither Lyell nor Hooker\r\nthought much of my arguments. Nevertheless, for once in my life, I dare\r\nwithstand the almost preternatural sagacity of Lyell.\r\n\r\nYou ask about land-shells on islands far distant from continents:\r\nMadeira has a few identical with those of Europe, and here the evidence\r\nis really good, as some of them are sub-fossil. In the Pacific Islands\r\nthere are cases of identity, which I cannot at present persuade myself\r\nto account for by introduction through man's agency; although Dr.\r\nAug. Gould has conclusively shown that many land-shells have thus\r\nbeen distributed over the Pacific by man's agency. These cases of\r\nintroduction are most plaguing. Have you not found it so in the Malay\r\nArchipelago? It has seemed to me in the lists of mammals of Timor and\r\nother islands, that SEVERAL in all probability have been naturalised...\r\n\r\nYou ask whether I shall discuss \"man.\" I think I shall avoid the whole\r\nsubject, as so surrounded with prejudices; though I fully admit that it\r\nis the highest and most interesting problem for the naturalist. My work,\r\non which I have now been at work more or less for twenty years, will\r\nnot fix or settle anything; but I hope it will aid by giving a large\r\ncollection of facts, with one definite end. I get on very slowly, partly\r\nfrom ill-health, partly from being a very slow worker. I have got about\r\nhalf written; but I do not suppose I shall publish under a couple of\r\nyears. I have now been three whole months on one chapter on Hybridism!\r\n\r\nI am astonished to see that you expect to remain out three or four years\r\nmore. What a wonderful deal you will have seen, and what interesting\r\nareas--the grand Malay Archipelago and the richest parts of South\r\nAmerica! I infinitely admire and honour your zeal and courage in the\r\ngood cause of Natural Science; and you have my very sincere and cordial\r\ngood wishes for success of all kinds, and may all your theories succeed,\r\nexcept that on Oceanic Islands, on which subject I will do battle to the\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nPray believe me, my dear sir, yours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. February 8th [1858].\r\n\r\n...I am working very hard at my book, perhaps too hard. It will be very\r\nbig, and I am become most deeply interested in the way facts fall into\r\ngroups. I am like Croesus overwhelmed with my riches in facts, and I\r\nmean to make my book as perfect as ever I can. I shall not go to press\r\nat soonest for a couple of years...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. February 23rd [1858].\r\n\r\n...I was not much struck with the great Buckle, and I admired the way\r\nyou stuck up about deduction and induction. I am reading his book ('The\r\nHistory of Civilisation.'), which, with much sophistry, as it seems to\r\nme, is WONDERFULLY clever and original, and with astounding knowledge.\r\n\r\nI saw that you admired Mrs. Farrer's 'Questa tomba' of Beethoven\r\nthoroughly; there is something grand in her sweet tones.\r\n\r\nFarewell. I have partly written this note to drive bee's-cells out of\r\nmy head; for I am half-mad on the subject to try to make out some\r\nsimple steps from which all the wondrous angles may result. (He had\r\nmuch correspondence on this subject with the late Professor Miller of\r\nCambridge.)\r\n\r\nI was very glad to see Mrs. Hooker on Friday; how well she appears to be\r\nand looks.\r\n\r\nForgive your intolerable but affectionate friend, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, April 16th [1858].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nI want you to observe one point for me, on which I am extremely much\r\ninterested, and which will give you no trouble beyond keeping your eyes\r\nopen, and that is a habit I know full well that you have.\r\n\r\nI find horses of various colours often have a spinal band or stripe of\r\ndifferent and darker tint than the rest of the body; rarely transverse\r\nbars on the legs, generally on the under-side of the front legs, still\r\nmore rarely a very faint transverse shoulder-stripe like an ass.\r\n\r\nIs there any breed of Delamere forest ponies? I have found out little\r\nabout ponies in these respects. Sir P. Egerton has, I believe, some\r\nquite thoroughbred chestnut horses; have any of them the spinal stripe?\r\nMouse-coloured ponies, or rather small horses, often have spinal and leg\r\nbars. So have dun horses (by dun I mean real colour of cream mixed with\r\nbrown, bay, or chestnut). So have sometimes chestnuts, but I have not\r\nyet got a case of spinal stripe in chestnut, race horse, or in quite\r\nheavy cart-horse. Any fact of this nature of such stripes in horses\r\nwould be MOST useful to me. There is a parallel case in the legs of\r\nthe donkey, and I have collected some most curious cases of stripes\r\nappearing in various crossed equine animals. I have also a large mass of\r\nparallel facts in the breeds of pigeons about the wing bars. I SUSPECT\r\nit will throw light on the colour of the primeval horse. So do help me\r\nif occasion turns up...My health has been lately very bad from\r\noverwork, and on Tuesday I go for a fortnight's hydropathy. My work is\r\neverlasting. Farewell.\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox, I trust you are well. Farewell, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Moor Park, Farnham [April 26th, 1858].\r\n\r\n...I have just had the innermost cockles of my heart rejoiced by a\r\nletter from Lyell. I said to him (or he to me) that I believed from\r\nthe character of the flora of the Azores, that icebergs must have been\r\nstranded there; and that I expected erratic boulders would be detected\r\nembedded between the upheaved lava-beds; and I got Lyell to write to\r\nHartung to ask, and now H. says my question explains what had astounded\r\nhim, viz., large boulders (and some polished) of mica-schist, quartz,\r\nsandstone, etc., some embedded, and some 40 and 50 feet above the level\r\nof the sea, so that he had inferred that they had not been brought as\r\nballast. Is this not beautiful?\r\n\r\nThe water-cure has done me some good, but I [am] nothing to boast of\r\nto-day, so good-bye.\r\n\r\nMy dear friend, yours, C.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Moor Park, Farnham, April 26th [1858].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI have come here for a fortnight's hydropathy, as my stomach had got,\r\nfrom steady work, into a horrid state. I am extremely much obliged to\r\nyou for sending me Hartung's interesting letter. The erratic boulders\r\nare splendid. It is a grand case of floating ice versus glaciers. He\r\nought to have compared the northern and southern shores of the islands.\r\nIt is eminently interesting to me, for I have written a very long\r\nchapter on the subject, collecting briefly all the geological evidence\r\nof glacial action in different parts of the world, and then at great\r\nlength (on the theory of species changing) I have discussed the\r\nmigration and modification of plants and animals, in sea and land, over\r\na large part of the world. To my mind, it throws a flood of light on\r\nthe whole subject of distribution, if combined with the modification of\r\nspecies. Indeed, I venture to speak with some little confidence on this,\r\nfor Hooker, about a year ago, kindly read over my chapter, and though he\r\nthen demurred gravely to the general conclusion, I was delighted to hear\r\na week or two ago that he was inclined to come round pretty strongly to\r\nmy views of distribution and change during the glacial period. I had a\r\nletter from Thompson, of Calcutta, the other day, which helps me much,\r\nas he is making out for me what heat our temperate plants can endure.\r\nBut it is too long a subject for a note; and I have written thus only\r\nbecause Hartung's note has set the whole subject afloat in my mind\r\nagain. But I will write no more, for my object here is to think\r\nabout nothing, bathe much, walk much, eat much, and read much novels.\r\nFarewell, with many thanks, and very kind remembrance to Lady Lyell.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO MRS. DARWIN. Moor Park, Wednesday, April [1858].\r\n\r\nThe weather is quite delicious. Yesterday, after writing to you, I\r\nstrolled a little beyond the glade for an hour and a half, and enjoyed\r\nmyself--the fresh yet dark-green of the grand Scotch firs, the brown of\r\nthe catkins of the old birches, with their white stems, and a fringe of\r\ndistant green from the larches made an excessively pretty view. At\r\nlast I fell fast asleep on the grass, and awoke with a chorus of\r\nbirds singing around me, and squirrels running up the trees, and some\r\nwoodpeckers laughing, and it was as pleasant and rural a scene as ever\r\nI saw, and I did not care one penny how any of the beasts or birds had\r\nbeen formed. I sat in the drawing-room till after eight, and then went\r\nand read the Chief Justice's summing up, and thought Bernard (Simon\r\nBernard was tried in April 1858 as an accessory to Orsini's attempt on\r\nthe life of the Emperor of the French. The verdict was \"not guilty.\")\r\nguilty, and then read a bit of my novel, which is feminine, virtuous,\r\nclerical, philanthropical, and all that sort of thing, but very\r\ndecidedly flat. I say feminine, for the author is ignorant about money\r\nmatters, and not much of a lady--for she makes her men say, \"My Lady.\"\r\nI like Miss Craik very much, though we have some battles, and differ on\r\nevery subject. I like also the Hungarian; a thorough gentleman, formerly\r\nattache at Paris, and then in the Austrian cavalry, and now a pardoned\r\nexile, with broken health. He does not seem to like Kossuth, but says,\r\nhe is certain [he is] a sincere patriot, most clever and eloquent, but\r\nweak, with no determination of character...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. XIII. -- THE WRITING OF THE 'ORIGIN OF SPECIES.'\r\n\r\nJUNE 18, 1858, TO NOVEMBER, 1859.\r\n\r\n[The letters given in the present chapter tell their story with\r\nsufficient clearness, and need but a few words of explanation. Mr.\r\nWallace's Essay, referred to in the first letter, bore the sub-title,\r\n'On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely from the Original\r\nType,' was published in the Linnean Society's Journal (1858, volume\r\niii. page 53) as part of the joint paper of \"Messrs. C. Darwin and A.\r\nWallace,\" of which the full title was 'On the Tendency of Species to\r\nform Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by\r\nNatural Means of Selection.'\r\n\r\nMy father's contribution to the paper consisted of (1) Extracts from\r\nthe sketch of 1844; (2) part of a letter addressed to Dr Asa Gray,\r\ndated September 5, 1857, and which is given above. The paper was\r\n\"communicated\" to the Society by Sir Charles Lyell and Sir Joseph\r\nHooker, in whose prefatory letter, a clear account of the circumstances\r\nof the case is given.\r\n\r\nReferring to Mr. Wallace's Essay, they wrote:\r\n\r\n\"So highly did Mr. Darwin appreciate the value of the views therein set\r\nforth, that he proposed, in a letter to Sir Charles Lyell, to obtain\r\nMr. Wallace's consent to allow the Essay to be published as soon as\r\npossible. Of this step we highly approved, provided Mr. Darwin did not\r\nwithhold from the public, as he was strongly inclined to do (in favour\r\nof Mr. Wallace), the memoir which he had himself written on the same\r\nsubject, and which, as before stated, one of us had perused in 1844, and\r\nthe contents of which we had both of us been privy to for many years. On\r\nrepresenting this to Mr. Darwin, he gave us permission to make what\r\nuse we thought proper of his memoir, etc.; and in adopting our present\r\ncourse, of presenting it to the Linnean Society, we have explained to\r\nhim that we are not solely considering the relative claims to priority\r\nof himself and his friend, but the interests of science generally.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, 18th [June 1858].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nSome year or so ago you recommended me to read a paper by Wallace in the\r\n'Annals' ('Annals and Magazine of Natural History', 1855.), which had\r\ninterested you, and, as I was writing to him, I knew this would please\r\nhim much, so I told him. He has to-day sent me the enclosed, and asked\r\nme to forward it to you. It seems to me well worth reading. Your words\r\nhave come true with a vengeance--that I should be forestalled. You said\r\nthis, when I explained to you here very briefly my views of 'Natural\r\nSelection' depending on the struggle for existence. I never saw a more\r\nstriking coincidence; if Wallace had my MS. sketch written out in 1842,\r\nhe could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand\r\nas heads of my chapters. Please return me the MS., which he does not say\r\nhe wishes me to publish, but I shall of course, at once write and offer\r\nto send to any journal. So all my originality, whatever it may amount\r\nto, will be smashed, though my book, if it will ever have any value,\r\nwill not be deteriorated; as all the labour consists in the application\r\nof the theory.\r\n\r\nI hope you will approve of Wallace's sketch, that I may tell him what\r\nyou say.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell, yours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, Friday [June 25, 1858].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to trouble you, busy as you are, in so merely a personal\r\nan affair; but if you will give me your deliberate opinion, you will do\r\nme as great a service as ever man did, for I have entire confidence in\r\nyour judgment and honour...\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in Wallace's sketch which is not written out much\r\nfuller in my sketch, copied out in 1844, and read by Hooker some dozen\r\nyears ago. About a year ago I sent a short sketch, of which I have a\r\ncopy, of my views (owing to correspondence on several points) to Asa\r\nGray, so that I could most truly say and prove that I take nothing\r\nfrom Wallace. I should be extremely glad now to publish a sketch of my\r\ngeneral views in about a dozen pages or so; but I cannot persuade myself\r\nthat I can do so honourably. Wallace says nothing about publication, and\r\nI enclose his letter. But as I had not intended to publish any sketch,\r\ncan I do so honourably, because Wallace has sent me an outline of his\r\ndoctrine? I would far rather burn my whole book, than that he or any\r\nother man should think that I had behaved in a paltry spirit. Do you\r\nnot think his having sent me this sketch ties my hands?... If I could\r\nhonourably publish, I would state that I was induced now to publish a\r\nsketch (and I should be very glad to be permitted to say, to follow\r\nyour advice long ago given) from Wallace having sent me an outline of\r\nmy general conclusions. We differ only, [in] that I was led to my views\r\nfrom what artificial selection has done for domestic animals. I would\r\nsend Wallace a copy of my letter to Asa Gray, to show him that I had not\r\nstolen his doctrine. But I cannot tell whether to publish now would\r\nnot be base and paltry. This was my first impression, and I should have\r\ncertainly acted on it had it not been for your letter.\r\n\r\nThis is a trumpery affair to trouble you with, but you cannot tell how\r\nmuch obliged I should be for your advice.\r\n\r\nBy the way, would you object to send this and your answer to Hooker to\r\nbe forwarded to me, for then I shall have the opinion of my two best and\r\nkindest friends. This letter is miserably written, and I write it now,\r\nthat I may for a time banish the whole subject; and I am worn out with\r\nmusing...\r\n\r\nMy good dear friend forgive me. This is a trumpery letter, influenced by\r\ntrumpery feelings.\r\n\r\nYours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nI will never trouble you or Hooker on the subject again.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, 26th [June, 1858].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nForgive me for adding a P.S. to make the case as strong as possible\r\nagainst myself.\r\n\r\nWallace might say, \"You did not intend publishing an abstract of your\r\nviews till you received my communication. Is it fair to take advantage\r\nof my having freely, though unasked, communicated to you my ideas, and\r\nthus prevent me forestalling you?\" The advantage which I should take\r\nbeing that I am induced to publish from privately knowing that Wallace\r\nis in the field. It seems hard on me that I should be thus compelled to\r\nlose my priority of many years' standing, but I cannot feel at all\r\nsure that this alters the justice of the case. First impressions are\r\ngenerally right, and I at first thought it would be dishonourable in me\r\nnow to publish.\r\n\r\nYours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have always thought you would make a first-rate Lord Chancellor;\r\nand I now appeal to you as a Lord Chancellor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, Tuesday [June 29, 1858].\r\n\r\n...I have received your letters. I cannot think now (So soon after the\r\ndeath, from scarlet fever, of his infant child.) on the subject, but\r\nsoon will. But I can see that you have acted with more kindness, and so\r\nhas Lyell, even than I could have expected from you both, most kind as\r\nyou are.\r\n\r\nI can easily get my letter to Asa Gray copied, but it is too short.\r\n\r\n...God bless you. You shall hear soon, as soon as I can think.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Tuesday night [June 29, 1858].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have just read your letter, and see you want the papers at once. I\r\nam quite prostrated, and can do nothing, but I send Wallace, and the\r\nabstract (\"Abstract\" is here used in the sense of \"extract;\" in this\r\nsense also it occurs in the 'Linnean Journal,' where the sources of my\r\nfather's paper are described.) of my letter to Asa Gray, which gives\r\nmost imperfectly only the means of change, and does not touch on reasons\r\nfor believing that species do change. I dare say all is too late. I\r\nhardly care about it. But you are too generous to sacrifice so much time\r\nand kindness. It is most generous, most kind. I send my sketch of 1844\r\nsolely that you may see by your own handwriting that you did read it.\r\nI really cannot bear to look at it. Do not waste much time. It is\r\nmiserable in me to care at all about priority.\r\n\r\nThe table of contents will show what it is.\r\n\r\nI would make a similar, but shorter and more accurate sketch for the\r\n'Linnean Journal.'\r\n\r\nI will do anything. God bless you, my dear kind friend.\r\n\r\nI can write no more. I send this by my servant to Kew.\r\n\r\nYours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter is that already referred to as forming part of the\r\njoint paper published in the Linnean Society's 'Journal,' 1858]:--\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. Down, September 5th [1857]. (The date is\r\ngiven as October in the 'Linnean Journal.' The extracts were printed\r\nfrom a duplicate undated copy in my father's possession, on which he had\r\nwritten, \"This was sent to Asa Gray 8 or 9 months ago, I think October\r\n1857.\")\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nI forget the exact words which I used in my former letter, but I dare\r\nsay I said that I thought you would utterly despise me when I told you\r\nwhat views I had arrived at, which I did because I thought I was bound\r\nas an honest man to do so. I should have been a strange mortal, seeing\r\nhow much I owe to your quite extraordinary kindness, if in saying this\r\nI had meant to attribute the least bad feeling to you. Permit me to tell\r\nyou that, before I had ever corresponded with you, Hooker had shown me\r\nseveral of your letters (not of a private nature), and these gave me the\r\nwarmest feeling of respect to you; and I should indeed be ungrateful\r\nif your letters to me, and all I have heard of you, had not strongly\r\nenhanced this feeling. But I did not feel in the least sure that when\r\nyou knew whither I was tending, that you might not think me so wild and\r\nfoolish in my views (God knows, arrived at slowly enough, and I hope\r\nconscientiously), that you would think me worth no more notice or\r\nassistance. To give one example: the last time I saw my dear old friend\r\nFalconer, he attacked me most vigorously, but quite kindly, and told me,\r\n\"You will do more harm than any ten Naturalists will do good. I can see\r\nthat you have already CORRUPTED and half-spoiled Hooker!!\" Now when I\r\nsee such strong feeling in my oldest friends, you need not wonder that I\r\nalways expect my views to be received with contempt. But enough and too\r\nmuch of this.\r\n\r\nI thank you most truly for the kind spirit of your last letter. I agree\r\nto every word in it, and think I go as far as almost any one in seeing\r\nthe grave difficulties against my doctrine. With respect to the extent\r\nto which I go, all the arguments in favour of my notions fall RAPIDLY\r\naway, the greater the scope of forms considered. But in animals,\r\nembryology leads me to an enormous and frightful range. The facts which\r\nkept me longest scientifically orthodox are those of adaptation--the\r\npollen-masses in asclepias--the mistletoe, with its pollen carried by\r\ninsects, and seed by birds--the woodpecker, with its feet and tail, beak\r\nand tongue, to climb the tree and secure insects. To talk of climate or\r\nLamarckian habit producing such adaptations to other organic beings\r\nis futile. This difficulty I believe I have surmounted. As you seem\r\ninterested in the subject, and as it is an IMMENSE advantage to me\r\nto write to you and to hear, ever so briefly, what you think, I will\r\nenclose (copied, so as to save you trouble in reading) the briefest\r\nabstract of my notions on the means by which Nature makes her species.\r\nWhy I think that species have really changed, depends on general facts\r\nin the affinities, embryology, rudimentary organs, geological history,\r\nand geographical distribution of organic beings. In regard to my\r\nAbstract, you must take immensely on trust, each paragraph occupying one\r\nor two chapters in my book. You will, perhaps, think it paltry in me,\r\nwhen I ask you not to mention my doctrine; the reason is, if any one,\r\nlike the author of the 'Vestiges,' were to hear of them, he might\r\neasily work them in, and then I should have to quote from a work perhaps\r\ndespised by naturalists, and this would greatly injure any chance of\r\nmy views being received by those alone whose opinions I value. [Here\r\nfollows a discussion on \"large genera varying,\" which has no direct\r\nconnection with the remainder of the letter.]\r\n\r\nI. It is wonderful what the principle of Selection by Man, that is the\r\npicking out of individuals with any desired quality, and breeding from\r\nthem, and again picking out, can do. Even breeders have been astonished\r\nat their own results. They can act on differences inappreciable to an\r\nuneducated eye. Selection has been METHODICALLY followed in Europe for\r\nonly the last half century. But it has occasionally, and even in some\r\ndegree methodically, been followed in the most ancient times. There must\r\nhave been also a kind of unconscious selection from the most ancient\r\ntimes, namely, in the preservation of the individual animals (without\r\nany thought of their offspring) most useful to each race of man in\r\nhis particular circumstances. The \"roguing,\" as nursery-men call the\r\ndestroying of varieties, which depart from their type, is a kind of\r\nselection. I am convinced that intentional and occasional selection has\r\nbeen the main agent in making our domestic races. But, however this may\r\nbe, its great power of modification has been indisputedly shown in late\r\ntimes. Selection acts only by the accumulation of very slight or greater\r\nvariations, caused by external conditions, or by the mere fact that in\r\ngeneration the child is not absolutely similar to its parent. Man,\r\nby this power of accumulating variations, adapts living beings to his\r\nwants--he MAY BE SAID to make the wool of one sheep good for carpets,\r\nand another for cloth, etc.\r\n\r\nII. Now, suppose there was a being, who did not judge by mere external\r\nappearance, but could study the whole internal organisation--who never\r\nwas capricious--who should go on selecting for one end during millions\r\nof generations, who will say what he might not effect! In nature we have\r\nsome SLIGHT variations, occasionally in all parts: and I think it can be\r\nshown that a change in the conditions of existence is the main cause\r\nof the child not exactly resembling its parents; and in nature, geology\r\nshows us what changes have taken place, and are taking place. We have\r\nalmost unlimited time: no one but a practical geologist can fully\r\nappreciate this: think of the Glacial period, during the whole of which\r\nthe same species of shells at least have existed; there must have been\r\nduring this period, millions on millions of generations.\r\n\r\nIII. I think it can be shown that there is such an unerring power\r\nat work, or NATURAL SELECTION (the title of my book), which selects\r\nexclusively for the good of each organic being. The elder De Candolle,\r\nW. Herbert, and Lyell, have written strongly on the struggle for life;\r\nbut even they have not written strongly enough. Reflect that every being\r\n(even the elephant) breeds at such a rate that, in a few years, or at\r\nmost a few centuries or thousands of years, the surface of the earth\r\nwould not hold the progeny of any one species. I have found it hard\r\nconstantly to bear in mind that the increase of every single species is\r\nchecked during some part of its life, or during some shortly recurrent\r\ngeneration. Only a few of those annually born can live to propagate\r\ntheir kind. What a trifling difference must often determine which shall\r\nsurvive and which perish.\r\n\r\nIV. Now take the case of a country undergoing some change; this will\r\ntend to cause some of its inhabitants to vary slightly; not but what I\r\nbelieve most beings vary at all times enough for selection to act on.\r\nSome of its inhabitants will be exterminated, and the remainder will be\r\nexposed to the mutual action of a different set of inhabitants, which\r\nI believe to be more important to the life of each being than mere\r\nclimate. Considering the infinitely various ways beings have to obtain\r\nfood by struggling with other beings, to escape danger at various times\r\nof life, to have their eggs or seeds disseminated, etc., etc., I cannot\r\ndoubt that during millions of generations individuals of a species\r\nwill be born with some slight variation profitable to some part of its\r\neconomy; such will have a better chance of surviving, propagating this\r\nvariation, which again will be slowly increased by the accumulative\r\naction of natural selection; and the variety thus formed will either\r\ncoexist with, or more commonly will exterminate its parent form. An\r\norganic being like the woodpecker, or the mistletoe, may thus come to\r\nbe adapted to a score of contingencies; natural selection, accumulating\r\nthose slight variations in all parts of its structure which are in any\r\nway useful to it, during any part of its life.\r\n\r\nV. Multiform difficulties will occur to every one on this theory. Most\r\ncan, I think, be satisfactorily answered.--\"Natura non facit saltum\"\r\nanswer some of the most obvious. The slowness of the change, and only a\r\nvery few undergoing change at any one time answers others. The extreme\r\nimperfections of our geological records answers others.\r\n\r\nVI. One other principle, which may be called the principle of\r\ndivergence, plays, I believe, an important part in the origin of\r\nspecies. The same spot will support more life if occupied by very\r\ndiverse forms: we see this in the many generic forms in a square yard of\r\nturf (I have counted twenty species belonging to eighteen genera), or in\r\nthe plants and insects, on any little uniform islet, belonging to almost\r\nas many genera and families as to species. We can understand this with\r\nthe higher animals, whose habits we best understand. We know that it\r\nhas been experimentally shown that a plot of land will yield a greater\r\nweight, if cropped with several species of grasses, than with two or\r\nthree species. Now every single organic being, by propagating rapidly,\r\nmay be said to be striving its utmost to increase in numbers. So it will\r\nbe with the offspring of any species after it has broken into varieties,\r\nor sub-species, or true species. And it follows, I think, from the\r\nforegoing facts, that the varying offspring of each species will try\r\n(only a few will succeed) to seize on as many and as diverse places\r\nin the economy of nature as possible. Each new variety or species when\r\nformed will generally take the place of, and so exterminate its\r\nless well-fitted parent. This, I believe, to be the origin of the\r\nclassification or arrangement of all organic beings at all times. These\r\nalways SEEM to branch and sub-branch like a tree from a common trunk;\r\nthe flourishing twigs destroying the less vigorous--the dead and lost\r\nbranches rudely representing extinct genera and families.\r\n\r\nThis sketch is MOST imperfect; but in so short a space I cannot make\r\nit better. Your imagination must fill up many wide blanks. Without some\r\nreflection, it will appear all rubbish; perhaps it will appear so after\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nC.D.\r\n\r\nP.S.--This little abstract touches only the accumulative power of\r\nnatural selection, which I look at as by far the most important element\r\nin the production of new forms. The laws governing the incipient or\r\nprimordial variation (unimportant except as the groundwork for selection\r\nto act on, in which respect it is all important), I shall discuss under\r\nseveral heads, but I can come, as you may well believe, only to very\r\npartial and imperfect conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The joint paper of Mr. Wallace and my father was read at the Linnean\r\nSociety on the evening of July 1st. Sir Charles Lyell and Sir J.D.\r\nHooker were present, and both, I believe, made a few remarks, chiefly\r\nwith a view of impressing on those present the necessity of giving the\r\nmost careful consideration to what they had heard. There was, however,\r\nno semblance of a discussion. Sir Joseph Hooker writes to me: \"The\r\ninterest excited was intense, but the subject was too novel and too\r\nominous for the old school to enter the lists, before armouring. After\r\nthe meeting it was talked over with bated breath: Lyell's approval, and\r\nperhaps in a small way mine, as his lieutenant in the affair, rather\r\noverawed the Fellows, who would otherwise have flown out against the\r\ndoctrine. We had, too, the vantage ground of being familiar with the\r\nauthors and their theme.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, July 5th [1858].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nWe are become more happy and less panic-struck, now that we have sent\r\nout of the house every child, and shall remove H.,as soon as she can\r\nmove. The first nurse became ill with ulcerated throat and quinsey,\r\nand the second is now ill with the scarlet fever, but, thank God, is\r\nrecovering. You may imagine how frightened we have been. It has been a\r\nmost miserable fortnight. Thank you much for your note, telling me that\r\nall had gone on prosperously at the Linnean Society. You must let me\r\nonce again tell you how deeply I feel your generous kindness and Lyell's\r\non this occasion. But in truth it shames me that you should have lost\r\ntime on a mere point of priority. I shall be curious to see the proofs.\r\nI do not in the least understand whether my letter to A. Gray is to be\r\nprinted; I suppose not, only your note; but I am quite indifferent, and\r\nplace myself absolutely in your and Lyell's hands.\r\n\r\nI can easily prepare an abstract of my whole work, but I can hardly see\r\nhow it can be made scientific for a Journal, without giving facts, which\r\nwould be impossible. Indeed, a mere abstract cannot be very short. Could\r\nyou give me any idea how many pages of the Journal could probably be\r\nspared me?\r\n\r\nDirectly after my return home, I would begin and cut my cloth to my\r\nmeasure. If the Referees were to reject it as not strictly scientific, I\r\ncould, perhaps publish it as a pamphlet.\r\n\r\nWith respect to my big interleaved abstract (The Sketch of 1844.), would\r\nyou send it any time before you leave England, to the enclosed address?\r\nIf you do not go till August 7th-10th, I should prefer it left with\r\nyou. I hope you have jotted criticisms on my MS. on big Genera, etc.,\r\nsufficient to make you remember your remarks, as I should be infinitely\r\nsorry to lose them. And I see no chance of our meeting if you go soon\r\nabroad. We thank you heartily for your invitation to join you: I can\r\nfancy nothing which I should enjoy more; but our children are too\r\ndelicate for us to leave; I should be mere living lumber.\r\n\r\nLastly, you said you would write to Wallace; I certainly should much\r\nlike this, as it would quite exonerate me: if you would send me your\r\nnote, sealed up, I would forward it with my own, as I know the address,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nWill you answer me sometime about your notions of the length of my\r\nabstract.\r\n\r\nIf you see Lyell, will you tell him how truly grateful I feel for his\r\nkind interest in this affair of mine. You must know that I look at it,\r\nas very important, for the reception of the view of species not being\r\nimmutable, the fact of the greatest Geologist and Botanist in England\r\ntaking ANY SORT OF INTEREST in the subject: I am sure it will do much to\r\nbreak down prejudices.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Miss Wedgwood's, Hartfield, Tunbridge\r\nWells, [July 13th, 1858].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYour letter to Wallace seems to me perfect, quite clear and most\r\ncourteous. I do not think it could possibly be improved, and I have\r\nto day forwarded it with a letter of my own. I always thought it very\r\npossible that I might be forestalled, but I fancied that I had a grand\r\nenough soul not to care; but I found myself mistaken and punished; I\r\nhad, however, quite resigned myself, and had written half a letter to\r\nWallace to give up all priority to him, and should certainly not\r\nhave changed had it not been for Lyell's and your quite extraordinary\r\nkindness. I assure you I feel it, and shall not forget it. I am MORE\r\nthan satisfied at what took place at the Linnean Society. I had thought\r\nthat your letter and mine to Asa Gray were to be only an appendix to\r\nWallace's paper.\r\n\r\nWe go from here in a few days to the sea-side, probably to the Isle of\r\nWight, and on my return (after a battle with pigeon skeletons) I will\r\nset to work at the abstract, though how on earth I shall make anything\r\nof an abstract in thirty pages of the Journal, I know not, but will try\r\nmy best. I shall order Bentham; is it not a pity that you should waste\r\ntime in tabulating varieties? for I can get the Down schoolmaster to do\r\nit on my return, and can tell you all the results.\r\n\r\nI must try and see you before your journey; but do not think I am\r\nfishing to ask you to come to Down, for you will have no time for that.\r\n\r\nYou cannot imagine how pleased I am that the notion of Natural Selection\r\nhas acted as a purgative on your bowels of immutability. Whenever\r\nnaturalists can look at species changing as certain, what a magnificent\r\nfield will be open,--on all the laws of variation,--on the genealogy of\r\nall living beings,--on their lines of migration, etc., etc. Pray thank\r\nMrs. Hooker for her very kind little note, and pray, say how truly\r\nobliged I am, and in truth ashamed to think that she should have had\r\nthe trouble of copying my ugly MS. It was extraordinarily kind in her.\r\nFarewell, my dear kind friend.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have had some fun here in watching a slave-making ant; for I\r\ncould not help rather doubting the wonderful stories, but I have now\r\nseen a defeated marauding party, and I have seen a migration from one\r\nnest to another of the slave-makers, carrying their slaves (who are\r\nHOUSE, and not field niggers) in their mouths!\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that it is a true generalisation that, when honey\r\nis secreted at one point of the circle of the corolla, if the pistil\r\nbends, it always bends into the line of the gangway to the honey. The\r\nLarkspur is a good instance, in contrast to Columbine,--if you think of\r\nit, just attend to this little point.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. King's Head Hotel, Sandown, Isle of Wight,\r\nJuly 18th [1858].\r\n\r\n...We are established here for ten days, and then go on to Shanklin,\r\nwhich seems more amusing to one, like myself, who cannot walk. We hope\r\nmuch that the sea may do H. and L. good. And if it does, our expedition\r\nwill answer, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have never half thanked you for all the extraordinary trouble and\r\nkindness you showed me about Wallace's affair. Hooker told me what was\r\ndone at the Linnean Society, and I am far more than satisfied, and I do\r\nnot think that Wallace can think my conduct unfair in allowing you and\r\nHooker to do whatever you thought fair. I certainly was a little annoyed\r\nto lose all priority, but had resigned myself to my fate. I am going to\r\nprepare a longer abstract; but it is really impossible to do justice\r\nto the subject, except by giving the facts on which each conclusion is\r\ngrounded, and that will, of course, be absolutely impossible. Your name\r\nand Hooker's name appearing as in any way the least interested in my\r\nwork will, I am certain, have the most important bearing in leading\r\npeople to consider the subject without prejudice. I look at this as so\r\nvery important, that I am almost glad of Wallace's paper for having led\r\nto this.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell, yours most gratefully, CH. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letter refers to the proof-sheets of the Linnean paper.\r\nThe 'introduction' means the prefatory letter signed by Sir C. Lyell and\r\nSir J.D. Hooker.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. King's Head Hotel, Sandown, Isle of\r\nWight, July 21st [1858].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI received only yesterday the proof-sheets, which I now return. I think\r\nyour introduction cannot be improved.\r\n\r\nI am disgusted with my bad writing. I could not improve it, without\r\nrewriting all, which would not be fair or worth while, as I have begun\r\non a better abstract for the Linnean Society. My excuse is that it NEVER\r\nwas intended for publication. I have made only a few corrections in the\r\nstyle; but I cannot make it decent, but I hope moderately intelligible.\r\nI suppose some one will correct the revise. (Shall I?)\r\n\r\nCould I have a clean proof to send to Wallace?\r\n\r\nI have not yet fully considered your remarks on big genera (but your\r\ngeneral concurrence is of the HIGHEST POSSIBLE interest to me); nor\r\nshall I be able till I re-read my MS.; but you may rely on it that\r\nyou never make a remark to me which is lost from INATTENTION. I am\r\nparticularly glad you do not object to my stating your objections in\r\na modified form, for they always struck me as very important, and as\r\nhaving much inherent value, whether or no they were fatal to my notions.\r\nI will consider and reconsider all your remarks...\r\n\r\nI have ordered Bentham, for, as -- says, it will be very curious to see\r\na Flora written by a man who knows nothing of British plants!!\r\n\r\nI am very glad at what you say about my Abstract, but you may rely on\r\nit that I will condense to the utmost. I would aid in money if it is\r\ntoo long. (That is to say, he would help to pay for the printing, if\r\nit should prove too long for the Linnean Society.) In how many ways you\r\nhave aided me!\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n[The 'Abstract' mentioned in the last sentence of the preceding letter\r\nwas in fact the 'Origin of Species,' on which he now set to work. In his\r\n'Autobiography' he speaks of beginning to write in September, but in\r\nhis Diary he wrote, \"July 20 to August 12, at Sandown, began Abstract of\r\nSpecies book.\" \"September 16, Recommenced Abstract.\" The book was\r\nbegun with the idea that it would be published as a paper, or series of\r\npapers, by the Linnean Society, and it was only in the late autumn that\r\nit became clear that it must take the form of an independent volume.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Norfolk House, Shanklin, Isle of Wight,\r\nFriday [July] 30th [1858].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nWill you give the enclosed scrap to Sir William to thank him for his\r\nkindness; and this gives me an excuse to amuse myself by writing to you\r\na note, which requires no answer.\r\n\r\nThis is a very charming place, and we have got a very comfortable house.\r\nBut, alas, I cannot say that the sea has done H. or L. much good. Nor\r\nhas my stomach recovered from all our troubles. I am very glad we left\r\nhome, for six children have now died of scarlet fever in Down. We return\r\non the 14th of August.\r\n\r\nI have got Bentham ('British Flora.'), and am charmed with it, and\r\nWilliam (who has just started for a tour abroad) has been making out all\r\nsorts of new (to me) plants capitally. The little scraps of information\r\nare so capital...The English names in the analytical keys drive us mad:\r\ngive them by all means, but why on earth [not] make them subordinate to\r\nthe Latin; it puts me in a passion. W. charged into the Compositae and\r\nUmbelliferae like a hero, and demolished ever so many in grand style.\r\n\r\nI pass my time by doing daily a couple of hours of my Abstract, and I\r\nfind it amusing and improving work. I am now most heartily obliged to\r\nyou and Lyell for having set me on this; for I shall, when it is done,\r\nbe able to finish my work with greater ease and leisure. I confess I\r\nhated the thought of the job; and now I find it very unsatisfactory in\r\nnot being able to give my reasons for each conclusion.\r\n\r\nI will be longer than I expected; it will take thirty-five of my MS.\r\nfolio pages to give an abstract on variation under domestication alone;\r\nbut I will try to put in nothing which does not seem to me of some\r\ninterest, and which was once new to me. It seems a queer plan to give an\r\nabstract of an unpublished work; nevertheless, I repeat, I am extremely\r\nglad I have begun in earnest on it.\r\n\r\nI hope you and Mrs. Hooker will have a very very pleasant tour.\r\nFarewell, my dear Hooker.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Norfolk House, Shanklin, Isle of Wight,\r\nThursday [August 5, 1858].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI should think the note apologetical about the style of the abstract was\r\nbest as a note...But I write now to ask you to send me by return of post\r\nthe MS. on big genera, that I may make an abstract of a couple of pages\r\nin length. I presume that you have quite done with it, otherwise I would\r\nnot for anything have it back. If you tie it with string, and mark it\r\nMS. for printing, it will not cost, I should think, more than 4 pence.\r\nI shall wish much to say that you have read this MS. and concur; but you\r\nshall, before I read it to the Society, hear the sentence.\r\n\r\nWhat you tell me after speaking with Busk about the length of the\r\nAbstract is an IMMENSE relief to me; it will make the labour far less,\r\nnot having to shorten so much every single subject; but I will try not\r\nto be too diffusive. I fear it will spoil all interest in my book (The\r\nlarger book begun in 1856.), whenever published. The Abstract will\r\ndo very well to divide into several parts: thus I have just finished\r\n\"Variation under Domestication,\" in forty-four MS. pages, and that would\r\ndo for one evening; but I should be extremely sorry if all could not be\r\npublished together.\r\n\r\nWhat else you say about my Abstract pleases me highly, but frightens me,\r\nfor I fear I shall never be able to make it good enough. But how I do\r\nrun on about my own affairs to you!\r\n\r\nI was astonished to see Sir W. Hooker's card here two or three days\r\nago: I was unfortunately out walking. Henslow, also, has written to me,\r\nproposing to come to Down on the 9th, but alas, I do not return till the\r\n13th, and my wife not till a week later; so that I am also most sorry to\r\nthink I shall not see you, for I should not like to leave home so soon.\r\nI had thought of going to London and running down for an hour or two to\r\nKew...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Norfolk House, Shanklin, Isle of Wight,\r\n[August] [1858].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI write merely to say that the MS. came safely two or three days ago.\r\nI am much obliged for the correction of style: I find it unutterably\r\ndifficult to write clearly. When we meet I must talk over a few points\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nYou speak of going to the sea-side somewhere; we think this the nicest\r\nseaside place which we have ever seen, and we like Shanklin better than\r\nother spots on the south coast of the island, though many are charming\r\nand prettier, so that I would suggest your thinking of this place. We\r\nare on the actual coast; but tastes differ so much about places.\r\n\r\nIf you go to Broadstairs, when there is a strong wind from the coast of\r\nFrance and in fine, dry, warm weather, look out, and you will PROBABLY\r\n(!) see thistle-seeds blown across the Channel. The other day I saw one\r\nblown right inland, and then in a few minutes a second one and then a\r\nthird; and I said to myself, God bless me, how many thistles there must\r\nbe in France; and I wrote a letter in imagination to you. But I then\r\nlooked at the LOW clouds, and noticed that they were not coming inland,\r\nso I feared a screw was loose. I then walked beyond a headland, and\r\nfound the wind parallel to the coast, and on this very headland a noble\r\nbed of thistles, which by every wide eddy were blown far out to sea, and\r\nthen came right in at right angles to the shore! One day such a number\r\nof insects were washed up by the tide, and I brought to life thirteen\r\nspecies of Coleoptera; not that I suppose these came from France. But do\r\nyou watch for thistle-seed as you saunter along the coast...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. August 11th [1858].\r\n\r\nMy dear Gray,\r\n\r\nYour note of July 27th has just reached me in the Isle of Wight. It is a\r\nreal and great pleasure to me to write to you about my notions; and\r\neven if it were not so, I should be a most ungrateful dog, after all\r\nthe invaluable assistance you have rendered me, if I did not do anything\r\nwhich you asked.\r\n\r\nI have discussed in my long MS. the later changes of climate and the\r\neffect on migration, and I will here give you an ABSTRACT of an ABSTRACT\r\n(which latter I am preparing of my whole work for the Linnean Society).\r\nI cannot give you facts, and I must write dogmatically, though I do not\r\nfeel so on any point. I may just mention, in order that you may believe\r\nthat I have SOME foundation for my views, that Hooker has read my MS.,\r\nand though he at first demurred to my main point, he has since told me\r\nthat further reflection and new facts have made him a convert.\r\n\r\nIn the older, or perhaps newer, Pliocene age (a little BEFORE the\r\nGlacial epoch) the temperature was higher; of this there can be little\r\ndoubt; the land, on a LARGE SCALE, held much its present disposition:\r\nthe species were mainly, judging from shells, what they are now. At this\r\nperiod when all animals and plants ranged 10 or 15 degrees nearer the\r\npoles, I believe the northern part of Siberia and of North America being\r\nalmost CONTINUOUS, were peopled (it is quite possible, considering\r\nthe shallow water, that Behring Straits were united, perhaps a little\r\nsouthward) by a nearly uniform fauna and flora, just as the Arctic\r\nregions now are. The climate then became gradually colder till it became\r\nwhat it now is; and then the temperate parts of Europe and America would\r\nbe separated, as far as migration is concerned, just as they now are.\r\nThen came on the Glacial period, driving far south all living things;\r\nmiddle or even southern Europe being peopled with Arctic productions;\r\nas the warmth returned, the Arctic productions slowly crawled up the\r\nmountains as they became denuded of snow; and we now see on their\r\nsummits the remnants of a once continuous flora and fauna. This is E.\r\nForbes' theory, which, however, I may add, I had written out four years\r\nbefore he published.\r\n\r\nSome facts have made me vaguely SUSPECT that between the glacial and\r\nthe present temperature there was a period of SLIGHTLY greater warmth.\r\nAccording to my modification-doctrines, I look at many of the species of\r\nNorth America which CLOSELY represent those of Europe, as having become\r\nmodified since the Pliocene period, when in the northern part of the\r\nworld there was nearly free communication between the old and new\r\nworlds. But now comes a more important consideration; there is a\r\nconsiderable body of geological evidence that during the Glacial epoch\r\nthe whole world was colder; I inferred that, many years ago, from\r\nerratic boulder phenomena carefully observed by me on both the east and\r\nwest coast of South America. Now I am so bold as to believe that at the\r\nheight of the Glacial epoch, AND WHEN ALL TROPICAL PRODUCTIONS MUST\r\nHAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY DISTRESSED, that several temperate forms slowly\r\ntravelled into the heart of the Tropics, and even reached the southern\r\nhemisphere; and some few southern forms penetrated in a reverse\r\ndirection northward. (Heights of Borneo with Australian forms, Abyssinia\r\nwith Cape forms.) Wherever there was nearly continuous HIGH land, this\r\nmigration would have been immensely facilitated; hence the European\r\ncharacter of the plants of Tierra del Fuego and summits of Cordilleras;\r\nhence ditto on Himalaya. As the temperature rose, all the temperate\r\nintruders would crawl up the mountains. Hence the European forms on\r\nNilgherries, Ceylon, summit of Java, Organ Mountains of Brazil. But\r\nthese intruders being surrounded with new forms would be very liable to\r\nbe improved or modified by natural selection, to adapt them to the new\r\nforms with which they had to compete; hence most of the forms on the\r\nmountains of the Tropics are not identical, but REPRESENTATIVE forms of\r\nNorth temperate plants.\r\n\r\nThere are similar classes of facts in marine productions. All this will\r\nappear very rash to you, and rash it may be; but I am sure not so rash\r\nas it will at first appear to you: Hooker could not stomach it at all at\r\nfirst, but has become largely a convert. From mammalia and shallow sea,\r\nI believe Japan to have been joined to main land of China within no\r\nremote period; and then the migration north and south before, during,\r\nand after the Glacial epoch would act on Japan, as on the corresponding\r\nlatitude of China and the United States.\r\n\r\nI should beyond anything like to know whether you have any Alpine\r\ncollections from Japan, and what is their character. This letter is\r\nmiserably expressed, but perhaps it will suffice to show what I believe\r\nhave been the later main migrations and changes of temperature...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [Down] October 6th, 1858.\r\n\r\n...If you have or can make leisure, I should very much like to hear news\r\nof Mrs. Hooker, yourself, and the children. Where did you go, and what\r\ndid you do and are doing? There is a comprehensive text.\r\n\r\nYou cannot tell how I enjoyed your little visit here, it did me much\r\ngood. If Harvey is still with you, pray remember me very kindly to him.\r\n\r\n...I am working most steadily at my Abstract, but it grows to an\r\ninordinate length; yet fully to make my view clear (and never giving\r\nbriefly more than a fact or two, and slurring over difficulties), I\r\ncannot make it shorter. It will yet take me three or four months; so\r\nslow do I work, though never idle. You cannot imagine what a service you\r\nhave done me in making me make this Abstract; for though I thought I had\r\ngot all clear, it has clarified my brains very much, by making me weigh\r\nthe relative importance of the several elements.\r\n\r\nI have been reading with much interest your (as I believe it to be)\r\ncapital memoir of R. Brown in the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\"...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, October 12th, [1858].\r\n\r\n...I have sent eight copies (Of the joint paper by C. Darwin and A.R.\r\nWallace.) by post to Wallace, and will keep the others for him, for I\r\ncould not think of any one to send any to.\r\n\r\nI pray you not to pronounce too strongly against Natural Selection, till\r\nyou have read my abstract, for though I dare say you will strike out\r\nMANY difficulties, which have never occurred to me; yet you cannot have\r\nthought so fully on the subject as I have.\r\n\r\nI expect my Abstract will run into a small volume, which will have to be\r\npublished separately...\r\n\r\nWhat a splendid lot of work you have in hand.\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, October 13th [1858].\r\n\r\n...I have been a little vexed at myself at having asked you not \"to\r\npronounce too strongly against Natural Selection.\" I am sorry to have\r\nbothered you, though I have been much interested by your note in answer.\r\nI wrote the sentence without reflection. But the truth is, that I have\r\nso accustomed myself, partly from being quizzed by my non-naturalist\r\nrelations, to expect opposition and even contempt, that I forgot for\r\nthe moment that you are the one living soul from whom I have constantly\r\nreceived sympathy. Believe [me] that I never forget for even a minute\r\nhow much assistance I have received from you. You are quite correct that\r\nI never even suspected that my speculations were a \"jam-pot\" to you;\r\nindeed, I thought, until quite lately, that my MS. had produced no\r\neffect on you, and this has often staggered me. Nor did I know that you\r\nhad spoken in general terms about my work to our friends, excepting to\r\ndear old Falconer, who some few years ago once told me that I should do\r\nmore mischief than any ten other naturalists would do good, [and] that I\r\nhad half spoiled you already! All this is stupid egotistical stuff,\r\nand I write it only because you may think me ungrateful for not having\r\nvalued and understood your sympathy; which God knows is not the case. It\r\nis an accursed evil to a man to become so absorbed in any subject as I\r\nam in mine.\r\n\r\nI was in London yesterday for a few hours with Falconer, and he gave\r\nme a magnificent lecture on the age of man. We are not upstarts; we can\r\nboast of a pedigree going far back in time coeval with extinct species.\r\nHe has a grand fact of some large molar tooth in the Trias.\r\n\r\nI am quite knocked up, and am going next Monday to revive under\r\nWater-cure at Moor Park.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker, yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. November 1858.\r\n\r\n...I had vowed not to mention my everlasting Abstract to you again, for\r\nI am sure I have bothered you far more than enough about it; but, as you\r\nallude to its previous publication, I may say that I have the chapters\r\non Instinct and Hybridism to abstract, which may take a fortnight each;\r\nand my materials for Palaeontology, Geographical Distribution, and\r\nAffinities, being less worked up, I dare say each of these will take me\r\nthree weeks, so that I shall not have done at soonest till April, and\r\nthen my Abstract will in bulk make a small volume. I never give more\r\nthan one or two instances, and I pass over briefly all difficulties, and\r\nyet I cannot make my Abstract shorter, to be satisfactory, than I am now\r\ndoing, and yet it will expand to a small volume...\r\n\r\n\r\n[About this time my father revived his old knowledge of beetles in\r\nhelping his boys in their collecting. He sent a short notice to the\r\n'Entomologist's Weekly Intelligencer,' June 25th, 1859, recording the\r\ncapture of Licinus silphoides, Clytus mysticus, Panagaeus 4-pustulatus.\r\nThe notice begins with the words, \"We three very young collectors having\r\nlately taken in the parish of Down,\" etc., and is signed by three of his\r\nboys, but was clearly not written by them. I have a vivid recollection\r\nof the pleasure of turning out my bottle of dead beetles for my father\r\nto name, and the excitement, in which he fully shared, when any of them\r\nproved to be uncommon ones. The following letters to Mr. Fox (November\r\n13, 1858), and to Sir John Lubbock, illustrate this point:]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, November 13th [1858].\r\n\r\n...W., my son, is now at Christ's College, in the rooms above yours.\r\nMy old Gyp, Impey, was astounded to hear that he was my son, and very\r\nsimply asked, \"Why, has he been long married?\" What pleasant hours those\r\nwere when I used to come and drink coffee with you daily! I am reminded\r\nof old days by my third boy having just begun collecting beetles, and\r\nhe caught the other day Brachinus crepitans, of immortal Whittlesea\r\nMere memory. My blood boiled with old ardour when he caught a Licinus--a\r\nprize unknown to me...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO JOHN LUBBOCK. Thursday [before 1857].\r\n\r\nDear Lubbock,\r\n\r\nI do not know whether you care about beetles, but for the chance I\r\nsend this in a bottle, which I never remember having seen; though it\r\nis excessively rash to speak from a twenty-five-year old remembrance.\r\nWhenever we meet you can tell me whether you know it...\r\n\r\nI feel like an old war-horse at the sound of the trumpet, when I read\r\nabout the capturing of rare beetles--is not this a magnanimous simile\r\nfor a decayed entomologist?--It really almost makes me long to begin\r\ncollecting again. Adios.\r\n\r\n\"Floreat Entomologia\"!--to which toast at Cambridge I have drunk many a\r\nglass of wine. So again, \"Floreat Entomologia.\" N.B. I have NOT now been\r\ndrinking any glasses full of wine.\r\n\r\nYours, C.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO HERBERT SPENCER. Down, November 25th [1858].\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI beg permission to thank you sincerely for your very kind present\r\nof your Essays. ('Essays, Scientific, Political, and Speculative,' by\r\nHerbert Spencer, 1858-74.) I have already read several of them with\r\nmuch interest. Your remarks on the general argument of the so-called\r\ndevelopment theory seems to me admirable. I am at present preparing an\r\nAbstract of a larger work on the changes of species; but I treat the\r\nsubject simply as a naturalist, and not from a general point of view,\r\notherwise, in my opinion, your argument could not have been improved on,\r\nand might have been quoted by me with great advantage. Your article\r\non Music has also interested me much, for I had often thought on the\r\nsubject, and had come to nearly the same conclusion with you, though\r\nunable to support the notion in any detail. Furthermore, by a curious\r\ncoincidence, expression has been for years a persistent subject with\r\nme for LOOSE speculation, and I must entirely agree with you that\r\nall expression has some biological meaning. I hope to profit by your\r\ncriticism on style, and with very best thanks, I beg leave to remain,\r\ndear Sir,\r\n\r\nYours truly obliged, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, December 24th [1858].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYour news about your unsolicited salary and house is jolly, and\r\ncreditable to the Government. My room (28 x 19), with divided room\r\nabove, with ALL FIXTURES (and painted), not furniture, and plastered\r\noutside, cost about 500 pounds. I am heartily glad of this news.\r\n\r\nYour facts about distribution are, indeed, very striking. I remember\r\nwell that none of your many wonderful facts in your several works,\r\nperplexed me, for years, more than the migration having been mainly from\r\nnorth to south, and not in the reverse direction. I have now at last\r\nsatisfied MYSELF (but that is very different from satisfying others) on\r\nthis head; but it would take a little volume to fully explain myself.\r\nI did not for long see the bearing of a conclusion, at which I had\r\narrived, with respect to this subject. It is, that species inhabiting a\r\nvery large area, and therefore existing in large numbers, and which have\r\nbeen subjected to the severest competition with many other forms, will\r\nhave arrived, through natural selection, at a higher stage of perfection\r\nthan the inhabitants of a small area. Thus I explain the fact of so many\r\nanomalies, or what may be called \"living fossils,\" inhabiting now only\r\nfresh water, having been beaten out, and exterminated in the sea, by\r\nmore improved forms; thus all existing Ganoid fishes are fresh water,\r\nas [are] Lepidosiren and Ornithorhynchus, etc. The plants of Europe and\r\nAsia, as being the largest territory, I look at as the most \"improved,\"\r\nand therefore as being able to withstand the less-perfected Australian\r\nplants; [whilst] these could not resist the Indian. See how all the\r\nproductions of New Zealand yield to those of Europe. I dare say you will\r\nthink all this utter bosh, but I believe it to be solid truth.\r\n\r\nYou will, I think, admit that Australian plants, flourishing so in\r\nIndia, is no argument that they could hold their own against the ten\r\nthousand natural contingencies of other plants, insects, animals, etc.,\r\netc. With respect to South West Australia and the Cape, I am shut up,\r\nand can only d--n the whole case.\r\n\r\n...You say you should like to see my MS., but you did read and approve\r\nof my long Glacial chapter, and I have not yet written my Abstract on\r\nthe whole of the Geographical Distribution, nor shall I begin it for two\r\nor three weeks. But either Abstract or the old MS. I should be DELIGHTED\r\nto send you, especially the Abstract chapter...\r\n\r\nI have now written 330 folio pages of my abstract, and it will require\r\n150-200 [more]; so that it will make a printed volume of 400 pages,\r\nand must be printed separately, which I think will be better in many\r\nrespects. The subject really seems to me too large for discussion at any\r\nSociety, and I believe religion would be brought in by men whom I know.\r\n\r\nI am thinking of a 12mo volume, like Lyell's fourth or fifth edition of\r\nthe 'Principles.'...\r\n\r\nI have written you a scandalously long note. So now good-bye, my dear\r\nHooker,\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, January 20th, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI should very much like to borrow Heer at some future time, for I want\r\nto read nothing perplexing at present till my Abstract is done.\r\nYour last very instructive letter shall make me very cautious on the\r\nhyper-speculative points we have been discussing.\r\n\r\nWhen you say you cannot master the train of thoughts, I know well enough\r\nthat they are too doubtful and obscure to be mastered. I have often\r\nexperienced what you call the humiliating feeling of getting more and\r\nmore involved in doubt the more one thinks of the facts and reasoning\r\non doubtful points. But I always comfort myself with thinking of the\r\nfuture, and in the full belief that the problems which we are just\r\nentering on, will some day be solved; and if we just break the ground we\r\nshall have done some service, even if we reap no harvest.\r\n\r\nI quite agree that we only differ in DEGREE about the means of\r\ndispersal, and that I think a satisfactory amount of accordance. You put\r\nin a very striking manner the mutation of our continents, and I quite\r\nagree; I doubt only about our oceans.\r\n\r\nI also agree (I am in a very agreeing frame of mind) with your\r\nargumentum ad hominem, about the highness of the Australian Flora\r\nfrom the number of species and genera; but here comes in a superlative\r\nbothering element of doubt, viz., the effect of isolation.\r\n\r\nThe only point in which I PRESUMPTUOUSLY rather demur is about the\r\nstatus of the naturalised plants in Australia. I think Muller speaks of\r\ntheir having spread largely beyond cultivated ground; and I can hardly\r\nbelieve that our European plants would occupy stations so barren that\r\nthe native plants could not live there. I should require much evidence\r\nto make me believe this. I have written this note merely to thank you,\r\nas you will see it requires no answer.\r\n\r\nI have heard to my amazement this morning from Phillips that the\r\nGeological Council have given me the Wollaston Medal!!!\r\n\r\nEver yours, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, January 23d, 1859.\r\n\r\n...I enclose letters to you and me from Wallace. I admire extremely the\r\nspirit in which they are written. I never felt very sure what he would\r\nsay. He must be an amiable man. Please return that to me, and Lyell\r\nought to be told how well satisfied he is. These letters have vividly\r\nbrought before me how much I owe to your and Lyell's most kind and\r\ngenerous conduct in all this affair.\r\n\r\n...How glad I shall be when the Abstract is finished, and I can rest!...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, January 25th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI was extremely much pleased at receiving three days ago your letter to\r\nme and that to Dr. Hooker. Permit me to say how heartily I admire\r\nthe spirit in which they are written. Though I had absolutely nothing\r\nwhatever to do in leading Lyell and Hooker to what they thought a fair\r\ncourse of action, yet I naturally could not but feel anxious to hear\r\nwhat your impression would be. I owe indirectly much to you and them;\r\nfor I almost think that Lyell would have proved right, and I should\r\nnever have completed my larger work, for I have found my Abstract hard\r\nenough with my poor health, but now, thank God, I am in my last chapter\r\nbut one. My Abstract will make a small volume of 400 or 500 pages.\r\nWhenever published, I will, of course, send you a copy, and then you\r\nwill see what I mean about the part which I believe selection has played\r\nwith domestic productions. It is a very different part, as you suppose,\r\nfrom that played by \"Natural Selection.\" I sent off, by the same address\r\nas this note, a copy of the 'Journal of the Linnean Society,' and\r\nsubsequently I have sent some half-dozen copies of the paper. I have\r\nmany other copies at your disposal...\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear that you have been attending to birds' nests. I have\r\ndone so, though almost exclusively under one point of view, viz., to\r\nshow that instincts vary, so that selection could work on and improve\r\nthem. Few other instincts, so to speak, can be preserved in a Museum.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your offer to look after horses' stripes; If there\r\nare any donkeys, pray add them. I am delighted to hear that you have\r\ncollected bees' combs...This is an especial hobby of mine, and I think\r\nI can throw a light on the subject. If you can collect duplicates, at no\r\nvery great expense, I should be glad of some specimens for myself with\r\nsome bees of each kind. Young, growing, and irregular combs, and\r\nthose which have not had pupae, are most valuable for measurements and\r\nexamination. Their edges should be well protected against abrasion.\r\n\r\nEvery one whom I have seen has thought your paper very well written and\r\ninteresting. It puts my extracts (written in 1839, now just twenty years\r\nago!), which I must say in apology were never for an instant intended\r\nfor publication, into the shade.\r\n\r\nYou ask about Lyell's frame of mind. I think he is somewhat staggered,\r\nbut does not give in, and speaks with horror, often to me, of what a\r\nthing it would be, and what a job it would be for the next edition of\r\n'The Principles,' if he were \"PERverted.\" But he is most candid and\r\nhonest, and I think will end by being PERverted. Dr. Hooker has become\r\nalmost as heterodox as you or I, and I look at Hooker as BY FAR the most\r\ncapable judge in Europe.\r\n\r\nMost cordially do I wish you health and entire success in all your\r\npursuits, and, God knows, if admirable zeal and energy deserve success,\r\nmost amply do you deserve it. I look at my own career as nearly run out.\r\nIf I can publish my Abstract and perhaps my greater work on the same\r\nsubject, I shall look at my course as done.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear sir, yours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 2nd [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nHere is an odd, though very little, fact. I think it would be hardly\r\npossible to name a bird which apparently could have less to do with\r\ndistribution than a Petrel. Sir W. Milner, at St. Kilda, cut open some\r\nyoung nestling Petrels, and he found large, curious nuts in their crops;\r\nI suspect picked up by parent birds from the Gulf stream. He seems to\r\nvalue these nuts excessively. I have asked him (but I doubt whether\r\nhe will) to send a nut to Sir William Hooker (I gave this address for\r\ngrandeur sake) to see if any of you can name it and its native country.\r\nWill you PLEASE MENTION this to Sir William Hooker, and if the nut does\r\narrive, will you oblige me by returning it to \"Sir W. Milner, Bart.,\r\nNunappleton, Tadcaster,\" in a registered letter, and I will repay you\r\npostage. Enclose slip of paper with the name and country if you can, and\r\nlet me hereafter know. Forgive me asking you to take this much trouble;\r\nfor it is a funny little fact after my own heart.\r\n\r\nNow for another subject. I have finished my Abstract of the chapter on\r\nGeographical Distribution, as bearing on my subject. I should like you\r\nmuch to read it; but I say this, believing that you will not do so, if,\r\nas I believe to be the case, you are extra busy. On my honour, I shall\r\nnot be mortified, and I earnestly beg you not to do it, if it will\r\nbother you. I want it, because I here feel especially unsafe, and errors\r\nmay have crept in. Also, I should much like to know what parts you will\r\nMOST VEHEMENTLY object to. I know we do, and must, differ widely on\r\nseveral heads. Lastly, I should like particularly to know whether I\r\nhave taken anything from you, which you would like to retain for first\r\npublication; but I think I have chiefly taken from your published\r\nworks, and, though I have several times, in this chapter and elsewhere,\r\nacknowledged your assistance, I am aware that it is not possible for\r\nme in the Abstract to do it sufficiently. (\"I never did pick any one's\r\npocket, but whilst writing my present chapter I keep on feeling (even\r\nwhen differing most from you) just as if I were stealing from you, so\r\nmuch do I owe to your writings and conversation, so much more than mere\r\nacknowledgments show.\"--Letter to Sir J.D. Hooker, 1859.) But again\r\nlet me say that you must not offer to read it if very irksome. It is\r\nlong--about ninety pages, I expect, when fully copied out.\r\n\r\nI hope you are all well. Moor Park has done me some good.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Heaven forgive me, here is another question: How far am I right\r\nin supposing that with plants, the most important characters for main\r\ndivisions are Embryological? The seed itself cannot be considered as\r\nsuch, I suppose, nor the albumens, etc. But I suppose the Cotyledons and\r\ntheir position, and the position of the plumule and the radicle, and the\r\nposition and form of the whole embryo in the seed are embryological, and\r\nhow far are these very important? I wish to instance plants as a case\r\nof high importance of embryological characters in classification. In the\r\nAnimal Kingdom there is, of course, no doubt of this.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 5th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nMany thanks about the seed...it is curious. Petrels at St. Kilda\r\napparently being fed by seeds raised in the West Indies. It should be\r\nnoted whether it is a nut ever imported into England. I am VERY glad\r\nyou will read my Geographical MS.; it is now copying, and it will (I\r\npresume) take ten days or so in being finished; it shall be sent as soon\r\nas done...\r\n\r\nI shall be very glad to see your embryological ideas on plants; by the\r\nsentence which I sent you, you will see that I only want one sentence;\r\nif facts are at all, as I suppose, and I shall see this from your note,\r\nfor sending which very many thanks.\r\n\r\nI have been so poorly, the last three days, that I sometimes doubt\r\nwhether I shall ever get my little volume done, though so nearly\r\ncompleted...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, March 15th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI am PLEASED at what you say of my chapter. You have not attacked it\r\nnearly so much as I feared you would. You do not seem to have detected\r\nMANY errors. It was nearly all written from memory, and hence I was\r\nparticularly fearful; it would have been better if the whole had first\r\nbeen carefully written out, and abstracted afterwards. I look at it as\r\nmorally certain that it must include much error in some of its general\r\nviews. I will just run over a few points in your note, but do not\r\ntrouble yourself to reply without you have something important to say...\r\n\r\n...I should like to know whether the case of Endemic bats in islands\r\nstruck you; it has me especially; perhaps too strongly.\r\n\r\nWith hearty thanks, ever yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S. You cannot tell what a relief it has been to me your looking over\r\nthis chapter, as I felt very shaky on it.\r\n\r\nI shall to-morrow finish my last chapter (except a recapitulation) on\r\nAffinities, Homologies, Embryology, etc., and the facts seem to me to\r\ncome out VERY strong for mutability of species.\r\n\r\nI have been much interested in working out the chapter.\r\n\r\nI shall now, thank God, begin looking over the old first chapters for\r\npress.\r\n\r\nBut my health is now so very poor, that even this will take me long.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down [March] 24th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nIt was very good of you to write to me in the midst of all your\r\ntroubles, though you seem to have got over some of them, in the recovery\r\nof your wife's and your own health. I had not heard lately of your\r\nmother's health, and am sorry to hear so poor an account. But as she\r\ndoes not suffer much, that is the great thing; for mere life I do not\r\nthink is much valued by the old. What a time you must have had of it,\r\nwhen you had to go backwards and forwards.\r\n\r\nWe are all pretty well, and our eldest daughter is improving. I can see\r\ndaylight through my work, and am now finally correcting my chapters for\r\nthe press; and I hope in a month or six weeks to have proof-sheets. I am\r\nweary of my work. It is a very odd thing that I have no sensation that\r\nI overwork my brain; but facts compel me to conclude that my brain was\r\nnever formed for much thinking. We are resolved to go for two or three\r\nmonths, when I have finished, to Ilkley, or some such place, to see if\r\nI can anyhow give my health a good start, for it certainly has been\r\nwretched of late, and has incapacitated me for everything. You do me\r\ninjustice when you think that I work for fame; I value it to a certain\r\nextent; but, if I know myself, I work from a sort of instinct to try to\r\nmake out truth. How glad I should be if you could sometime come to Down;\r\nespecially when I get a little better, as I still hope to be. We have\r\nset up a billiard table, and I find it does me a deal of good, and\r\ndrives the horrid species out of my head. Farewell, my dear old friend.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, March 28th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nIf I keep decently well, I hope to be able to go to press with my volume\r\nearly in May. This being so, I want much to beg a little advice from\r\nyou. From an expression in Lady Lyell's note, I fancy that you have\r\nspoken to Murray. Is it so? And is he willing to publish my Abstract?\r\nIf you will tell me whether anything, and what has passed, I will then\r\nwrite to him. Does he know at all of the subject of the book? Secondly,\r\ncan you advise me, whether I had better state what terms of publication\r\nI should prefer, or first ask him to propose terms? And what do you\r\nthink would be fair terms for an edition? Share profits, or what?\r\n\r\nLastly, will you be so very kind as to look at the enclosed title and\r\ngive me your opinion and any criticisms; you must remember that, if I\r\nhave health and it appears worth doing, I have a much larger and full\r\nbook on the same subject nearly ready.\r\n\r\nMy Abstract will be about five hundred pages of the size of your first\r\nedition of the 'Elements of Geology.'\r\n\r\nPray forgive me troubling you with the above queries; and you shall have\r\nno more trouble on the subject. I hope the world goes well with you, and\r\nthat you are getting on with your various works.\r\n\r\nI am working very hard for me, and long to finish and be free and try to\r\nrecover some health.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell, ever yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nVery sincere thanks to you for standing my proxy for the Wollaston\r\nMedal.\r\n\r\nP.S. Would you advise me to tell Murray that my book is not more\r\nUN-orthodox than the subject makes inevitable. That I do not discuss the\r\norigin of man. That I do not bring in any discussion about Genesis,\r\netc., etc., and only give facts, and such conclusions from them as seem\r\nto me fair.\r\n\r\nOr had I better say NOTHING to Murray, and assume that he cannot object\r\nto this much unorthodoxy, which in fact is not more than any Geological\r\nTreatise which runs slap counter to Genesis.\r\n\r\nINCLOSURE.\r\n\r\nAN ABSTRACT OF AN ESSAY\r\n\r\nON THE\r\n\r\nORIGIN\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nSPECIES AND VARIETIES\r\n\r\nTHROUGH NATURAL SELECTION\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN, M.A.\r\n\r\nFellow of the Royal Geological and Linnean Societies...\r\n\r\nLONDON:\r\n\r\netc., etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, March 30th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nYou have been uncommonly kind in all you have done. You not only have\r\nsaved me much trouble and some anxiety, but have done all incomparably\r\nbetter than I could have done it. I am much pleased at all you say about\r\nMurray. I will write either to-day or to-morrow to him, and will send\r\nshortly a large bundle of MS., but unfortunately I cannot for a week, as\r\nthe first three chapters are in the copyists' hands.\r\n\r\nI am sorry about Murray objecting to the term Abstract, as I look at\r\nit as the only possible apology for NOT giving references and facts in\r\nfull, but I will defer to him and you. I am also sorry about the term\r\n\"natural selection.\" I hope to retain it with explanation somewhat as\r\nthus--\r\n\r\n\"Through natural selection, or the preservation of favoured Races.\"\r\n\r\nWhy I like the term is that it is constantly used in all works on\r\nbreeding, and I am surprised that it is not familiar to Murray; but I\r\nhave so long studied such works that I have ceased to be a competent\r\njudge.\r\n\r\nI again most truly and cordially thank you for your really valuable\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nYours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 2nd [1859].\r\n\r\n...I wrote to him [Mr. Murray] and gave him the headings of the\r\nchapters, and told him he could not have the MS. for ten days or so;\r\nand this morning I received a letter, offering me handsome terms, and\r\nagreeing to publish without seeing the MS.! So he is eager enough; I\r\nthink I should have been cautious, anyhow, but, owing to your letter,\r\nI told him most EXPLICITLY that I accept his offer solely on condition\r\nthat, after he has seen part or all the MS., he has full power of\r\nretracting. You will think me presumptuous, but I think my book will\r\nbe popular to a certain extent (enough to ensure [against] heavy loss)\r\namongst scientific and semi-scientific men; why I think so is, because\r\nI have found in conversation so great and surprising an interest amongst\r\nsuch men, and some o-scientific [non-scientific] men on this subject,\r\nand all my chapters are not NEARLY so dry and dull as that which you\r\nhave read on geographical distribution. Anyhow, Murray ought to be the\r\nbest judge, and if he chooses to publish it, I think I may wash my hands\r\nof all responsibility. I am sure my friends, i.e., Lyell and you, have\r\nbeen EXTRAORDINARILY kind in troubling yourselves on the matter.\r\n\r\nI shall be delighted to see you the day before Good Friday; there would\r\nbe one advantage for you in any other day--as I believe both my boys\r\ncome home on that day--and it would be almost impossible that I could\r\nsend the carriage for you. There will, I believe, be some relations in\r\nthe house--but I hope you will not care for that, as we shall easily get\r\nas much talking as my IMBECILE STATE allows. I shall deeply enjoy seeing\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n...I am tired, so no more.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker, your affectionate, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Please to send, well TIED UP with strong string, my Geographical\r\nMS., towards the latter half of next week--i.e., 7th or 8th--that I may\r\nsend it with more to Murray; and God help him if he tries to read it.\r\n\r\n...I cannot help a little doubting whether Lyell would take much pains\r\nto induce Murray to publish my book; this was not done at my request,\r\nand it rather grates against my pride.\r\n\r\nI know that Lyell has been INFINITELY kind about my affair, but your\r\ndashed (i.e., underlined) \"INDUCE\" gives the idea that Lyell had\r\nunfairly urged Murray.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO ASA GRAY. April 4th [1859].\r\n\r\n...You ask to see my sheets as printed off; I assure you that it will be\r\nthe HIGHEST satisfaction to me to do so: I look at the request as a high\r\ncompliment. I shall not, you may depend, forget a request which I look\r\nat as a favour. But (and it is a heavy \"but\" to me) it will be long\r\nbefore I go to press; I can truly say I am NEVER idle; indeed, I work\r\ntoo hard for my much weakened health; yet I can do only three hours of\r\nwork daily, and I cannot at all see when I shall have finished: I have\r\ndone eleven long chapters, but I have got some other very difficult\r\nones: as palaeontology, classifications, and embryology, etc., and I\r\nhave to correct and add largely to all those done. I find, alas! each\r\nchapter takes me on an average three months, so slow I am. There is\r\nno end to the necessary digressions. I have just finished a chapter on\r\nInstinct, and here I found grappling with such a subject as bees'\r\ncells, and comparing all my notes made during twenty years, took up a\r\ndespairing length of time.\r\n\r\nBut I am running on about myself in a most egotistical style. Yet I must\r\njust say how useful I have again and again found your letters, which I\r\nhave lately been looking over and quoting! but you need not fear that I\r\nshall quote anything you would dislike, for I try to be very cautious\r\non this head. I most heartily hope you may succeed in getting your\r\n\"incubus\" of old work off your hands, and be in some degree a free\r\nman...\r\n\r\nAgain let me say that I do indeed feel grateful to you...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J. MURRAY. Down, April 5th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI send by this post, the Title (with some remarks on a separate page),\r\nand the first three chapters. If you have patience to read all Chapter\r\nI., I honestly think you will have a fair notion of the interest of the\r\nwhole book. It may be conceit, but I believe the subject will interest\r\nthe public, and I am sure that the views are original. If you think\r\notherwise, I must repeat my request that you will freely reject my\r\nwork; and though I shall be a little disappointed, I shall be in no way\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to read Chapters II. and III., you will have a dull and\r\nrather abstruse chapter, and a plain and interesting one, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you have done with the MS., please to send it by CAREFUL\r\nMESSENGER, AND PLAINLY DIRECTED, to Miss G. Tollett, 14, Queen Anne\r\nStreet, Cavendish Square.\r\n\r\nThis lady, being an excellent judge of style, is going to look out for\r\nerrors for me.\r\n\r\nYou must take your own time, but the sooner you finish, the sooner she\r\nwill, and the sooner I shall get to press, which I so earnestly wish.\r\n\r\nI presume you will wish to see Chapter IV., the key-stone of my arch,\r\nand Chapters X. and XI., but please to inform me on this head.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, yours sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, April 11th [1859].\r\n\r\n...I write one line to say that I heard from Murray yesterday, and he\r\nsays he has read the first three chapters of one MS.(and this includes a\r\nvery dull one), and he abides by his offer. Hence he does not want more\r\nMS., and you can send my Geographical chapter when it pleases you...\r\n\r\n\r\n[Part of the MS. seems to have been lost on its way back to my father;\r\nhe wrote (April 14) to Sir J.D. Hooker:]\r\n\r\n\"I have the old MS., otherwise, the loss would have killed me! The worst\r\nis now that it will cause delay in getting to press, and FAR WORST of\r\nall, lose all advantage of your having looked over my chapter, except\r\nthe third part returned. I am very sorry Mrs. Hooker took the trouble of\r\ncopying the two pages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. [April or May, 1859].\r\n\r\n...Please do not say to any one that I thought my book on Species would\r\nbe fairly popular, and have a fairly remunerative sale (which was the\r\nheight of my ambition), for if it prove a dead failure, it would make me\r\nthe more ridiculous.\r\n\r\nI enclose a criticism, a taste of the future--\r\n\r\nREV. S. HAUGHTON'S ADDRESS TO THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY, DUBLIN. (February\r\n9, 1859.)\r\n\r\n\"This speculation of Messrs. Darwin and Wallace would not be worthy\r\nof notice were it not for the weight of authority of the names (i.e.\r\nLyell's and yours), under whose auspices it has been brought forward. If\r\nit means what it says, it is a truism; if it means anything more, it is\r\ncontrary to fact.\"\r\n\r\nQ.E.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 11th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nThank you for telling me about obscurity of style. But on my life no\r\nnigger with lash over him could have worked harder at clearness than\r\nI have done. But the very difficulty to me, of itself leads to the\r\nprobability that I fail. Yet one lady who has read all my MS. has found\r\nonly two or three obscure sentences, but Mrs. Hooker having so found\r\nit, makes me tremble. I will do my best in proofs. You are a good man to\r\ntake the trouble to write about it.\r\n\r\nWith respect to our mutual muddle (\"When I go over the chapter I will\r\nsee what I can do, but I hardly know how I am obscure, and I think we\r\nare somehow in a mutual muddle with respect to each other, from starting\r\nfrom some fundamentally different notions.\"--Letter of May 6, 1859.),\r\nI never for a moment thought we could not make our ideas clear to each\r\nother by talk, or if either of us had time to write in extenso.\r\n\r\nI imagine from some expressions (but if you ask me what, I could not\r\nanswer) that you look at variability as some necessary contingency with\r\norganisms, and further that there is some necessary tendency in the\r\nvariability to go on diverging in character or degree. IF YOU DO, I do\r\nnot agree. \"Reversion\" again (a form of inheritance), I look at as in no\r\nway directly connected with Variation, though of course inheritance is\r\nof fundamental importance to us, for if a variation be not inherited,\r\nit is of no significance to us. It was on such points as these I FANCIED\r\nthat we perhaps started differently.\r\n\r\nI fear that my book will not deserve at all the pleasant things you say\r\nabout it; and Good Lord, how I do long to have done with it!\r\n\r\nSince the above was written, I have received and have been MUCH\r\nINTERESTED by A. Gray. I am delighted at his note about my and Wallace's\r\npaper. He will go round, for it is futile to give up very many species,\r\nand stop at an arbitrary line at others. It is what my grandfather\r\ncalled Unitarianism, \"a feather bed to catch a falling Christian.\"...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, May 18th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nMy health has quite failed. I am off to-morrow for a week of Hydropathy.\r\nI am very very sorry to say that I cannot look over any proofs (Of Sir\r\nJ. Hooker's Introduction to the 'Flora of Australia.') in the week,\r\nas my object is to drive the subject out of my head. I shall return\r\nto-morrow week. If it be worth while, which probably it is not, you\r\ncould keep back any proofs till my return home.\r\n\r\nIn haste, ever yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Ten days later he wrote to Sir J.D. Hooker:\r\n\r\n\"...I write one word to say that I shall return on Saturday, and if you\r\nhave any proof-sheets to send, I shall be glad to do my best in any\r\ncriticisms. I had... great prostration of mind and body, but entire\r\nrest, and the douche, and 'Adam Bede,' have together done me a world of\r\ngood.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J. MURRAY. Down, June 14th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nThe diagram will do very well, and I will send it shortly to Mr. West to\r\nhave a few trifling corrections made.\r\n\r\nI get on very slowly with proofs. I remember writing to you that I\r\nthought there would not be much correction. I honestly wrote what I\r\nthought, but was most grievously mistaken. I find the style incredibly\r\nbad, and most difficult to make clear and smooth. I am extremely\r\nsorry to say, on account of expense, and loss of time for me, that\r\nthe corrections are very heavy, as heavy as possible. But from casual\r\nglances, I still hope that later chapters are not so badly written. How\r\nI could have written so badly is quite inconceivable, but I suppose\r\nit was owing to my whole attention being fixed on the general line of\r\nargument, and not on details. All I can say is, that I am very sorry.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S. I have been looking at the corrections, and considering them.\r\nIt seems to me that I shall put you to a quite unfair expense. If\r\nyou please I should like to enter into some such arrangement as the\r\nfollowing: when work completed, you to allow in the account a fairly\r\nmoderately heavy charge for corrections, and all excess over that to be\r\ndeducted from my profits, or paid by me individually.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, June 21st [1859].\r\n\r\nI am working very hard, but get on slowly, for I find that my\r\ncorrections are terrifically heavy, and the work most difficult to me. I\r\nhave corrected 130 pages, and the volume will be about 500. I have tried\r\nmy best to make it clear and striking, but very much fear that I have\r\nfailed--so many discussions are and must be very perplexing. I have done\r\nmy best. If you had all my materials, I am sure you would have made a\r\nsplendid book. I long to finish, for I am nearly worn out.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell, ever yours most truly, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, 22nd [June, 1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI did not answer your pleasant note, with a good deal of news to me,\r\nof May 30th, as I have been expecting proofs from you. But now, having\r\nnothing particular to do, I will fly a note, though I have nothing\r\nparticular to say or ask. Indeed, how can a man have anything to say,\r\nwho spends every day in correcting accursed proofs; and such proofs! I\r\nhave fairly to blacken them, and fasten slips of paper on, so miserable\r\nhave I found the style. You say that you dreamt that my book was\r\nENTERTAINING; that dream is pretty well over with me, and I begin to\r\nfear that the public will find it intolerably dry and perplexing. But I\r\nwill never give up that a better man could have made a splendid book\r\nout of the materials. I was glad to hear about Prestwich's paper. (Mr.\r\nPrestwich wrote on the occurrence of flint instruments associated with\r\nthe remains of extinct animals in France.--(Proc. R. Soc., 1859.))\r\nMy doubt has been (and I see Wright has inserted the same in the\r\n'Athenaeum') whether the pieces of flint are really tools; their\r\nnumbers make me doubt, and when I formerly looked at Boucher de Perthe's\r\ndrawings, I came to the conclusion that they were angular fragments\r\nbroken by ice action.\r\n\r\nDid crossing the Acacia do any good? I am so hard worked, that I can\r\nmake no experiments. I have got only to 150 pages in first proof.\r\n\r\nAdios, my dear Hooker, ever yours, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J. MURRAY. Down, July 25th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI write to say that five sheets are returned to the printers ready to\r\nstrike off, and two more sheets require only a revise; so that I presume\r\nyou will soon have to decide what number of copies to print off.\r\n\r\nI am quite incapable of forming an opinion. I think I have got the style\r\nFAIRLY good and clear, with infinite trouble. But whether the book will\r\nbe successful to a degree to satisfy you, I really cannot conjecture. I\r\nheartily hope it may.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, yours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO A.R. WALLACE. Down, August 9th, 1859.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Wallace,\r\n\r\nI received your letter and memoir (This seems to refer to Mr. Wallace's\r\npaper, \"On the Zoological Geography of the Malay Archipelago,\" 'Linn.\r\nSoc. Journ,' 1860.) on the 7th, and will forward it to-morrow to the\r\nLinnean Society. But you will be aware that there is no meeting till\r\nthe beginning of November. Your paper seems to me ADMIRABLE in matter,\r\nstyle, and reasoning; and I thank you for allowing me to read it. Had I\r\nread it some months ago, I should have profited by it for my forthcoming\r\nvolume. But my two chapters on this subject are in type, and, though not\r\nyet corrected, I am so wearied out and weak in health, that I am fully\r\nresolved not to add one word, and merely improve the style. So you will\r\nsee that my views are nearly the same with yours, and you may rely on it\r\nthat not one word shall be altered owing to my having read your\r\nideas. Are you aware that Mr. W. Earl (Probably Mr. W. Earle's paper,\r\nGeographical Soc. Journal, 1845.) published several years ago the view\r\nof distribution of animals in the Malay Archipelago, in relation to the\r\ndepth of the sea between the islands? I was much struck with this,\r\nand have been in the habit of noting all facts in distribution in\r\nthat archipelago, and elsewhere, in this relation. I have been led\r\nto conclude that there has been a good deal of naturalisation in the\r\ndifferent Malay islands, and which I have thought, to a certain extent,\r\nwould account for anomalies. Timor has been my greatest puzzle. What do\r\nyou say to the peculiar Felis there? I wish that you had visited Timor;\r\nit has been asserted that a fossil mastodon's or elephant's tooth (I\r\nforget which) has been found there, which would be a grand fact. I was\r\naware that Celebes was very peculiar; but the relation to Africa is\r\nquite new to me, and marvellous, and almost passes belief. It is as\r\nanomalous as the relation of PLANTS in S.W. Australia to the Cape of\r\nGood Hope. I differ WHOLLY from you on the colonisation of oceanic\r\nislands, but you will have EVERY ONE else on your side. I quite agree\r\nwith respect to all islands not situated far in the ocean. I quite agree\r\non the little occasional intermigration between lands [islands?] when\r\nonce pretty well stocked with inhabitants, but think this does not apply\r\nto rising and ill-stocked islands. Are you aware that ANNUALLY birds are\r\nblown to Madeira, the Azores (and to Bermuda from America). I wish I had\r\ngiven a fuller abstract of my reasons for not believing in Forbes' great\r\ncontinental extensions; but it is too late, for I will alter nothing--I\r\nam worn out, and must have rest. Owen, I do not doubt, will bitterly\r\noppose us...Hooker is publishing a grand introduction to the Flora of\r\nAustralia, and goes the whole length. I have seen proofs of about half.\r\nWith every good wish.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours very sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, September 1st [1859].\r\n\r\n...I am not surprised at your finding your Introduction very difficult.\r\nBut do not grudge the labour, and do not say you \"have burnt your\r\nfingers,\" and are \"deep in the mud\"; for I feel sure that the result\r\nwill be well worth the labour. Unless I am a fool, I must be a judge\r\nto some extent of the value of such general essays, and I am fully\r\nconvinced that yours are the must valuable ever published.\r\n\r\nI have corrected all but the last two chapters of my book, and hope to\r\nhave done revises and all in about three weeks, and then I (or we all)\r\nshall start for some months' hydropathy; my health has been very bad,\r\nand I am becoming as weak as a child, and incapable of doing anything\r\nwhatever, except my three hours daily work at proof-sheets. God knows\r\nwhether I shall ever be good at anything again, perhaps a long rest and\r\nhydropathy may do something.\r\n\r\nI have not had A. Gray's Essay, and should not feel up to criticise it,\r\neven if I had the impertinence and courage. You will believe me that\r\nI speak strictly the truth when I say that your Australian Essay is\r\nEXTREMELY interesting to me, rather too much so. I enjoy reading it\r\nover, and if you think my criticisms are worth anything to you, I beg\r\nyou to send the sheets (if you can give me time for good days); but\r\nunless I can render you any little, however little assistance, I would\r\nrather read the essay when published. Pray understand that I should be\r\nTRULY vexed not to read them, if you wish it for your own sake.\r\n\r\nI had a terribly long fit of sickness yesterday, which makes the world\r\nrather extra gloomy to-day, and I have an insanely strong wish to finish\r\nmy accursed book, such corrections every page has required as I never\r\nsaw before. It is so weariful, killing the whole afternoon, after 12\r\no'clock doing nothing whatever. But I will grumble no more. So farewell,\r\nwe shall meet in the winter I trust.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my dear Hooker, your affectionate friend, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, September 2nd [1859].\r\n\r\n...I am very glad you wish to see my clean sheets: I should have offered\r\nthem, but did not know whether it would bore you; I wrote by this\r\nmorning's post to Murray to send them. Unfortunately I have not got to\r\nthe part which will interest you, I think most, and which tells most\r\nin favour of the view, viz., Geological Succession, Geographical\r\nDistribution, and especially Morphology, Embryology and Rudimentary\r\nOrgans. I will see that the remaining sheets, when printed off, are sent\r\nto you. But would you like for me to send the last and perfect revises\r\nof the sheets as I correct them? if so, send me your address in a blank\r\nenvelope. I hope that you will read all, whether dull (especially latter\r\npart of Chapter II.) or not, for I am convinced there is not a sentence\r\nwhich has not a bearing on the whole argument. You will find Chapter\r\nIV. perplexing and unintelligible, without the aid of the enclosed queer\r\ndiagram (The diagram illustrates descent with divergence.), of which\r\nI send an old and useless proof. I have, as Murray says, corrected so\r\nheavily, as almost to have re-written it; but yet I fear it is poorly\r\nwritten. Parts are intricate; and I do not think that even you could\r\nmake them quite clear. Do not, I beg, be in a hurry in committing\r\nyourself (like so many naturalists) to go a certain length and no\r\nfurther; for I am deeply convinced that it is absolutely necessary to\r\ngo the whole vast length, or stick to the creation of each separate\r\nspecies; I argue this point briefly in the last chapter. Remember that\r\nyour verdict will probably have more influence than my book in deciding\r\nwhether such views as I hold will be admitted or rejected at present; in\r\nthe future I cannot doubt about their admittance, and our posterity will\r\nmarvel as much about the current belief as we do about fossils shells\r\nhaving been thought to have been created as we now see them. But forgive\r\nme for running on about my hobby-horse...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Down, [September] 11th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI corrected the last proof yesterday, and I have now my revises, index,\r\netc., which will take me near to the end of the month. So that the neck\r\nof my work, thank God, is broken.\r\n\r\nI write now to say that I am uneasy in my conscience about hesitating to\r\nlook over your proofs, but I was feeling miserably unwell and shattered\r\nwhen I wrote. I do not suppose I could be of hardly any use, but if I\r\ncould, pray send me any proofs. I should be (and fear I was) the most\r\nungrateful man to hesitate to do anything for you after some fifteen or\r\nmore years' help from you.\r\n\r\nAs soon as ever I have fairly finished I shall be off to Ilkley, or some\r\nother Hydropathic establishment. But I shall be some time yet, as my\r\nproofs have been so utterly obscured with corrections, that I have to\r\ncorrect heavily on revises.\r\n\r\nMurray proposes to publish the first week in November. Oh, good heavens,\r\nthe relief to my head and body to banish the whole subject from my mind!\r\n\r\nI hope to God, you do not think me a brute about your proof-sheets.\r\n\r\nFarewell, yours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, September 20th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nYou once gave me intense pleasure, or rather delight, by the way you\r\nwere interested, in a manner I never expected, in my Coral Reef notions,\r\nand now you have again given me similar pleasure by the manner you have\r\nnoticed my species work. (Sir Charles was President of the Geological\r\nsection at the meeting of the British Association at Aberdeen in 1859.\r\nThe following passage occurs in the address: \"On this difficult and\r\nmysterious subject a work will very shortly appear by Mr. Charles\r\nDarwin, the result of twenty years of observations and experiments in\r\nZoology, Botany, and Geology, by which he had been led to the conclusion\r\nthat those powers of nature which give rise to races and permanent\r\nvarieties in animals and plants, are the same as those which in much\r\nlonger periods produce species, and in a still longer series of ages\r\ngive rise to differences of generic rank. He appears to me to have\r\nsucceeded by his investigations and reasonings in throwing a flood\r\nof light on many classes of phenomena connected with the affinities,\r\ngeographical distribution, and geological succession of organic beings,\r\nfor which no other hypothesis has been able, or has even attempted to\r\naccount.\") Nothing could be more satisfactory to me, and I thank you for\r\nmyself, and even more for the subject's sake, as I know well that\r\nthe sentence will make many fairly consider the subject, instead of\r\nridiculing it. Although your previously felt doubts on the immutability\r\nof species, may have more influence in converting you (if you be\r\nconverted) than my book; yet as I regard your verdict as far more\r\nimportant in my own eyes, and I believe in the eyes of the world than of\r\nany other dozen men, I am naturally very anxious about it. Therefore\r\nlet me beg you to keep your mind open till you receive (in perhaps a\r\nfortnight's time) my latter chapters, which are the most important of\r\nall on the favourable side. The last chapter, which sums up and balances\r\nin a mass all the arguments contra and pro, will, I think, be useful to\r\nyou. I cannot too strongly express my conviction of the general truth\r\nof my doctrines, and God knows I have never shirked a difficulty. I am\r\nfoolishly anxious for your verdict, not that I shall be disappointed if\r\nyou are not converted; for I remember the long years it took me to\r\ncome round; but I shall be most deeply delighted if you do come round,\r\nespecially if I have a fair share in the conversion, I shall then\r\nfeel that my career is run, and care little whether I ever am good for\r\nanything again in this life.\r\n\r\nThank you much for allowing me to put in the sentence about your grave\r\ndoubt. (As to the immutability of species, 'Origin,' Edition i., page\r\n310.) So much and too much about myself.\r\n\r\nI have read with extreme interest in the Aberdeen paper about the flint\r\ntools; you have made the whole case far clearer to me; I suppose that\r\nyou did not think the evidence sufficient about the Glacial period.\r\n\r\nWith cordial thanks for your splendid notice of my book.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Lyell, your affectionate disciple, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO W.D. FOX. Down, September 23rd [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Fox,\r\n\r\nI was very glad to get your letter a few days ago. I was wishing to hear\r\nabout you, but have been in such an absorbed, slavish, overworked\r\nstate, that I had not heart without compulsion to write to any one or\r\ndo anything beyond my daily work. Though your account of yourself is\r\nbetter, I cannot think it at all satisfactory, and I wish you would soon\r\ngo to Malvern again. My father used to believe largely in an old saying\r\nthat, if a man grew thinner between fifty and sixty years of age, his\r\nchance of long life was poor, and that on the contrary it was a very\r\ngood sign if he grew fatter; so that your stoutness, I look at as a\r\nvery good omen. My health has been as bad as it well could be all this\r\nsummer; and I have kept on my legs, only by going at short intervals to\r\nMoor Park; but I have been better lately, and, thank Heaven, I have at\r\nlast as good as done my book, having only the index and two or three\r\nrevises to do. It will be published in the first week in November, and a\r\ncopy shall be sent you. Remember it is only an Abstract (but has cost\r\nme above thirteen months to write!!), and facts and authorities are far\r\nfrom given in full. I shall be curious to hear what you think of it, but\r\nI am not so silly as to expect to convert you. Lyell has read about\r\nhalf of the volume in clean sheets, and gives me very great kudos. He\r\nis wavering so much about the immutability of species, that I expect\r\nhe will come round. Hooker has come round, and will publish his belief\r\nsoon. So much for my abominable volume, which has cost me so much labour\r\nthat I almost hate it. On October 3rd I start for Ilkley, but shall\r\ntake three days for the journey! It is so late that we shall not take\r\na house; but I go there alone for three or four weeks, then return home\r\nfor a week and go to Moor Park for three or four weeks, and then I shall\r\nget a moderate spell of hydropathy: and I intend, if I can keep to my\r\nresolution, of being idle this winter. But I fear ennui will be as bad\r\nas a bad stomach...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, September 25th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI send by this post four corrected sheets. I have altered the sentence\r\nabout the Eocene fauna being beaten by recent, thanks to your remark.\r\nBut I imagined that it would have been clear that I supposed the climate\r\nto be nearly similar; you do not doubt, I imagine, that the climate of\r\nthe eocene and recent periods in DIFFERENT parts of the world could\r\nbe matched. Not that I think climate nearly so important as most\r\nnaturalists seem to think. In my opinion no error is more mischievous\r\nthan this.\r\n\r\nI was very glad to find that Hooker, who read over, in MS., my\r\nGeographical chapters, quite agreed in the view of the greater\r\nimportance of organic relations. I should like you to consider page 77\r\nand reflect on the case of any organism in the midst of its range.\r\n\r\nI shall be curious hereafter to hear what you think of distribution\r\nduring the glacial and preceding warmer periods. I am so glad you do\r\nnot think the Chapter on the Imperfection of the Geological Record\r\nexaggerated; I was more fearful about this chapter than about any part.\r\n\r\nEmbryology in Chapter VIII. is one of my strongest points I think. But\r\nI must not bore you by running on. My mind is so wearisomely full of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nI do thank you for your eulogy at Aberdeen. I have been so wearied and\r\nexhausted of late that I have for months doubted whether I have not been\r\nthrowing away time and labour for nothing. But now I care not what the\r\nuniversal world says; I have always found you right, and certainly on\r\nthis occasion I am not going to doubt for the first time. Whether you go\r\nfar, or but a very short way with me and others who believe as I do, I\r\nam contented, for my work cannot be in vain. You would laugh if you knew\r\nhow often I have read your paragraph, and it has acted like a little\r\ndram...\r\n\r\nFarewell, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Down, September 30th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI sent off this morning the last sheets, but without index, which is not\r\nin type. I look at you as my Lord High Chancellor in Natural Science,\r\nand therefore I request you, after you have finished, just to RERUN over\r\nthe heads in the Recapitulation-part of last chapter. I shall be deeply\r\nanxious to hear what you decide (if you are able to decide) on the\r\nbalance of the pros and contras given in my volume, and of such other\r\npros and contras as may occur to you. I hope that you will think that I\r\nhave given the difficulties fairly. I feel an entire conviction that if\r\nyou are now staggered to any moderate extent, that you will come more\r\nand more round, the longer you keep the subject at all before your mind.\r\nI remember well how many long years it was before I could look into the\r\nfaces of some of the difficulties and not feel quite abashed. I fairly\r\nstruck my colours before the case of neuter insects.\r\n\r\nI suppose that I am a very slow thinker, for you would be surprised at\r\nthe number of years it took me to see clearly what some of the problems\r\nwere which had to be solved, such as the necessity of the principle of\r\ndivergence of character, the extinction of intermediate varieties, on\r\na continuous area, with graduated conditions; the double problem of\r\nsterile first crosses and sterile hybrids, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nLooking back, I think it was more difficult to see what the problems\r\nwere than to solve them, so far as I have succeeded in doing, and this\r\nseems to me rather curious. Well, good or bad, my work, thank God, is\r\nover; and hard work, I can assure you, I have had, and much work which\r\nhas never borne fruit. You can see, by the way I am scribbling, that\r\nI have an idle and rainy afternoon. I was not able to start for Ilkley\r\nyesterday as I was too unwell; but I hope to get there on Tuesday or\r\nWednesday. Do, I beg you, when you have finished my book and thought a\r\nlittle over it, let me hear from you. Never mind and pitch into me, if\r\nyou think it requisite; some future day, in London possibly, you may\r\ngive me a few criticisms in detail, that is, if you have scribbled any\r\nremarks on the margin, for the chance of a second edition.\r\n\r\nMurray has printed 1250 copies, which seems to me rather too large an\r\nedition, but I hope he will not lose.\r\n\r\nI make as much fuss about my book as if it were my first. Forgive me,\r\nand believe me, my dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nYours most sincerely, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Ilkley, Yorkshire, October 15th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nBe a good man and screw out time enough to write me a note and tell me a\r\nlittle about yourself, your doings, and belongings.\r\n\r\nIs your Introduction fairly finished? I know you will abuse it, and I\r\nknow well how much I shall like it. I have been here nearly a fortnight,\r\nand it has done me very much good, though I sprained my ankle last\r\nSunday, which has quite stopped walking. All my family come here on\r\nMonday to stop three or four weeks, and then I shall go back to the\r\ngreat establishment, and stay a fortnight; so that if I can keep my\r\nspirits, I shall stay eight weeks here, and thus give hydropathy a\r\nfair chance. Before starting here I was in an awful state of stomach,\r\nstrength, temper, and spirits. My book has been completely finished some\r\nlittle time; as soon as copies are ready, of course one will be sent\r\nyou. I hope you will mark your copy with scores, so that I may profit\r\nby any criticisms. I should like to hear your general impression. From\r\nLyell's letters, he thinks favourably of it, but seems staggered by\r\nthe lengths to which I go. But if you go any considerable length in the\r\nadmission of modification, I can see no possible means of drawing the\r\nline, and saying here you must stop. Lyell is going to reread my book,\r\nand I yet entertain hopes that he will be converted, or perverted, as he\r\ncalls it. Lyell has been EXTREMELY kind in writing me three volume-like\r\nletters; but he says nothing about dispersal during the glacial period.\r\nI should like to know what he thinks on this head. I have one question\r\nto ask: Would it be any good to send a copy of my book to Decaisne?\r\nand do you know any philosophical botanists on the Continent, who read\r\nEnglish and care for such subjects? if so, give their addresses. How\r\nabout Andersson in Sweden? You cannot think how refreshing it is to\r\nidle away the whole day, and hardly ever think in the least about my\r\nconfounded book which half-killed me. I much wish I could hear of your\r\ntaking a real rest. I know how very strong you are, mentally, but I\r\nnever will believe you can go on working as you have worked of late with\r\nimpunity. You will some day stretch the string too tight. Farewell, my\r\ngood, and kind, and dear friend,\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO T.H. HUXLEY. Ilkley, Otley, Yorkshire, October 15th\r\n[1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Huxley,\r\n\r\nI am here hydropathising and coming to life again, after having finished\r\nmy accursed book, which would have been easy work to any one else, but\r\nhalf-killed me. I have thought you would give me one bit of information,\r\nand I know not to whom else to apply; viz., the addresses of Barrande,\r\nVon Siebold, Keyserling (I dare say Sir Roderick would know the latter).\r\n\r\nCan you tell me of any good and SPECULATIVE foreigners to whom it would\r\nbe worth while to send copies of my book, on the 'Origin of Species'?\r\nI doubt whether it is worth sending to Siebold. I should like to send a\r\nfew copies about, but how many I can afford I know not yet till I hear\r\nwhat price Murray affixes.\r\n\r\nI need not say that I will send, of course, one to you, in the first\r\nweek of November. I hope to send copies abroad immediately. I shall be\r\nINTENSELY curious to hear what effect the book produces on you. I know\r\nthat there will be much in it which you will object to, and I do not\r\ndoubt many errors. I am very far from expecting to convert you to many\r\nof my heresies; but if, on the whole, you and two or three others think\r\nI am on the right road, I shall not care what the mob of naturalists\r\nthink. The penultimate chapter (Chapter XIII. is on Classification,\r\nMorphology, Embryology, and Rudimentary Organs.), though I believe it\r\nincludes the truth, will, I much fear, make you savage. Do not act and\r\nsay, like Macleay versus Fleming, \"I write with aqua fortis to bite into\r\nbrass.\"\r\n\r\nEver yours, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Ilkley, Yorkshire, October 20th [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Lyell,\r\n\r\nI have been reading over all your letters consecutively, and I do not\r\nfeel that I have thanked you half enough for the extreme pleasure which\r\nthey have given me, and for their utility. I see in them evidence of\r\nfluctuation in the degree of credence you give to the theory; nor am\r\nI at all surprised at this, for many and many fluctuations I have\r\nundergone.\r\n\r\nThere is one point in your letter which I did not notice, about the\r\nanimals (and many plants) naturalised in Australia, which you think\r\ncould not endure without man's aid. I cannot see how man does aid the\r\nferal cattle. But, letting that pass, you seem to think, that because\r\nthey suffer prodigious destruction during droughts, that they would all\r\nbe destroyed. In the \"gran secos\" of La Plata, the indigenous animals,\r\nsuch as the American deer, die by thousands, and suffer apparently as\r\nmuch as the cattle. In parts of India, after a drought, it takes ten\r\nor more years before the indigenous mammals get up to their full number\r\nagain. Your argument would, I think, apply to the aborigines as well as\r\nto the feral.\r\n\r\nAn animal or plant which becomes feral in one small territory might be\r\ndestroyed by climate, but I can hardly believe so, when once feral over\r\nseveral large territories. Again, I feel inclined to swear at climate:\r\ndo not think me impudent for attacking you about climate. You say you\r\ndoubt whether man could have existed under the Eocene climate, but man\r\ncan now withstand the climate of Esquimaux-land and West Equatorial\r\nAfrica; and surely you do not think the Eocene climate differed from the\r\npresent throughout all Europe, as much as the Arctic regions differ from\r\nEquatorial Africa?\r\n\r\nWith respect to organisms being created on the American type in America,\r\nit might, I think, be said that they were so created to prevent them\r\nbeing too well created, so as to beat the aborigines; but this seems to\r\nme, somehow, a monstrous doctrine.\r\n\r\nI have reflected a good deal on what you say on the necessity of\r\ncontinued intervention of creative power. I cannot see this necessity;\r\nand its admission, I think, would make the theory of Natural Selection\r\nvalueless. Grant a simple Archetypal creature, like the Mud-fish or\r\nLepidosiren, with the five senses and some vestige of mind, and I\r\nbelieve natural selection will account for the production of every\r\nvertebrate animal.\r\n\r\nFarewell; forgive me for indulging in this prose, and believe me, with\r\ncordial thanks,\r\n\r\nYour ever attached disciple, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--When, and if, you reread, I supplicate you to write on the margin\r\nthe word \"expand,\" when too condensed, or \"not clear.\" or \"?.\" Such\r\nmarks would cost you little trouble, and I could copy them and reflect\r\non them, and their value would be infinite to me.\r\n\r\nMy larger book will have to be wholly re-written, and not merely the\r\npresent volume expanded; so that I want to waste as little time over\r\nthis volume as possible, if another edition be called for; but I fear\r\nthe subject will be too perplexing, as I have treated it, for general\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J.D. HOOKER. Ilkley, Yorkshire, Sunday [October 23rd,\r\n1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on your 'Introduction' (\"Australian Flora\".) being in\r\nfact finished. I am sure from what I read of it (and deeply I shall be\r\ninterested in reading it straight through), that it must have cost you\r\na prodigious amount of labour and thought. I shall like very much to\r\nsee the sheet, which you wish me to look at. Now I am so completely a\r\ngentleman, that I have sometimes a little difficulty to pass the day;\r\nbut it is astonishing how idle a three weeks I have passed. If it is any\r\ncomfort to you, pray delude yourself by saying that you intend \"sticking\r\nto humdrum science.\" But I believe it just as much as if a plant were\r\nto say that, \"I have been growing all my life, and, by Jove, I will stop\r\ngrowing.\" You cannot help yourself; you are not clever enough for that.\r\nYou could not even remain idle, as I have done, for three weeks! What\r\nyou say about Lyell pleases me exceedingly; I had not at all inferred\r\nfrom his letters that he had come so much round. I remember thinking,\r\nabove a year ago, that if ever I lived to see Lyell, yourself,\r\nand Huxley come round, partly by my book, and partly by their own\r\nreflections, I should feel that the subject is safe, and all the world\r\nmight rail, but that ultimately the theory of Natural Selection (though,\r\nno doubt, imperfect in its present condition, and embracing many errors)\r\nwould prevail. Nothing will ever convince me that three such men, with\r\nso much diversified knowledge, and so well accustomed to search for\r\ntruth, could err greatly. I have spoken of you here as a convert made\r\nby me; but I know well how much larger the share has been of your own\r\nself-thought. I am intensely curious to hear Huxley's opinion of my\r\nbook. I fear my long discussion on Classification will disgust him; for\r\nit is much opposed to what he once said to me.\r\n\r\nBut, how I am running on. You see how idle I am; but I have so enjoyed\r\nyour letter that you must forgive me. With respect to migration during\r\nthe glacial period: I think Lyell quite comprehends, for he has given me\r\na supporting fact. But, perhaps, he unconsciously hates (do not say so\r\nto him) the view as slightly staggering him on his favourite theory of\r\nall changes of climate being due to changes in the relative position of\r\nland and water.\r\n\r\nI will send copies of my book to all the men specified by you;... you\r\nwould be so kind as to add title, as Doctor, or Professor, or Monsieur,\r\nor Von, and initials (when wanted), and addresses to the names on the\r\nenclosed list, and let me have it pretty SOON, as towards the close\r\nof this week Murray says the copies to go abroad will be ready. I am\r\nanxious to get my view generally known, and not, I hope and think, for\r\nmere personal conceit...\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO C. LYELL. Ilkley, Yorkshire, October 25th [1859].\r\n\r\n...Our difference on \"principle of improvement\" and \"power of\r\nadaptation\" is too profound for discussion by letter. If I am wrong, I\r\nam quite blind to my error. If I am right, our difference will be got\r\nover only by your re-reading carefully and reflecting on my first four\r\nchapters. I supplicate you to read these again carefully. The so-called\r\nimprovement of our Shorthorn cattle, pigeons, etc., does not presuppose\r\nor require any aboriginal \"power of adaptation,\" or \"principle of\r\nimprovement;\" it requires only diversified variability, and man to\r\nselect or take advantage of those modifications which are useful to him;\r\nso under nature any slight modification which CHANCES to arise, and is\r\nuseful to any creature, is selected or preserved in the struggle for\r\nlife; any modification which is injurious is destroyed or rejected;\r\nany which is neither useful nor injurious will be left a fluctuating\r\nelement. When you contrast natural selection and \"improvement,\" you seem\r\nalways to overlook (for I do not see how you can deny) that every step\r\nin the natural selection of each species implies improvement in that\r\nspecies in relation to its conditions of life. No modification can be\r\nselected without it be an improvement or advantage. Improvement implies,\r\nI suppose, each form obtaining many parts or organs, all excellently\r\nadapted for their functions. As each species is improved, and as the\r\nnumber of forms will have increased, if we look to the whole course of\r\ntime, the organic condition of life for other forms will become more\r\ncomplex, and there will be a necessity for other forms to become\r\nimproved, or they will be exterminated; and I can see no limit to this\r\nprocess of improvement, without the intervention of any other and direct\r\nprinciple of improvement. All this seems to me quite compatible with\r\ncertain forms fitted for simple conditions, remaining unaltered, or\r\nbeing degraded.\r\n\r\nIf I have a second edition, I will reiterate \"Natural Selection,\" and,\r\nas a general consequence, \"Natural Improvement.\"\r\n\r\nAs you go, as far as you do, I begin strongly to think, judging from\r\nmyself, that you will go much further. How slowly the older geologists\r\nadmitted your grand views on existing geological causes of change!\r\n\r\nIf at any time you think I can answer any question, it is a real\r\npleasure to me to write.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately, C. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN TO J. MURRAY. Ilkley, Yorkshire [1859].\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have received your kind note and the copy; I am infinitely pleased and\r\nproud at the appearance of my child.\r\n\r\nI quite agree to all you propose about price. But you are really too\r\ngenerous about the, to me, scandalously heavy corrections. Are you not\r\nacting unfairly towards yourself? Would it not be better at least to\r\nshare the 72 pounds 8 shillings? I shall be fully satisfied, for I had\r\nno business to send, though quite unintentionally and unexpectedly, such\r\nbadly composed MS. to the printers.\r\n\r\nThank you for your kind offer to distribute the copies to my friends and\r\nassistors as soon as possible. Do not trouble yourself much about the\r\nforeigners, as Messrs. Williams and Norgate have most kindly offered\r\nto do their best, and they are accustomed to send to all parts of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nI will pay for my copies whenever you like. I am so glad that you were\r\nso good as to undertake the publication of my book.\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, yours very sincerely, CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Please do not forget to let me hear about two days before the\r\ncopies are distributed.\r\n\r\nI do not know when I shall leave this place, certainly not for several\r\nweeks. Whenever I am in London I will call on you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.XIV. -- BY PROFESSOR HUXLEY.\r\n\r\nON THE RECEPTION OF THE 'ORIGIN OF SPECIES.'\r\n\r\nTo the present generation, that is to say, the people a few years on\r\nthe hither and thither side of thirty, the name of Charles Darwin stands\r\nalongside of those of Isaac Newton and Michael Faraday; and, like them,\r\ncalls up the grand ideal of a searcher after truth and interpreter of\r\nNature. They think of him who bore it as a rare combination of genius,\r\nindustry, and unswerving veracity, who earned his place among the most\r\nfamous men of the age by sheer native power, in the teeth of a gale of\r\npopular prejudice, and uncheered by a sign of favour or appreciation\r\nfrom the official fountains of honour; as one who in spite of an acute\r\nsensitiveness to praise and blame, and notwithstanding provocations\r\nwhich might have excused any outbreak, kept himself clear of all envy,\r\nhatred, and malice, nor dealt otherwise than fairly and justly with the\r\nunfairness and injustice which was showered upon him; while, to the end\r\nof his days, he was ready to listen with patience and respect to the\r\nmost insignificant of reasonable objectors.\r\n\r\nAnd with respect to that theory of the origin of the forms of life\r\npeopling our globe, with which Darwin's name is bound up as closely\r\nas that of Newton with the theory of gravitation, nothing seems to be\r\nfurther from the mind of the present generation than any attempt to\r\nsmother it with ridicule or to crush it by vehemence of denunciation.\r\n\"The struggle for existence,\" and \"Natural selection,\" have become\r\nhousehold words and every-day conceptions. The reality and the\r\nimportance of the natural processes on which Darwin founds his\r\ndeductions are no more doubted than those of growth and multiplication;\r\nand, whether the full potency attributed to them is admitted or not,\r\nno one doubts their vast and far-reaching significance. Wherever the\r\nbiological sciences are studied, the 'Origin of Species' lights the\r\npaths of the investigator; wherever they are taught it permeates the\r\ncourse of instruction. Nor has the influence of Darwinian ideas\r\nbeen less profound, beyond the realms of Biology. The oldest of all\r\nphilosophies, that of Evolution, was bound hand and foot and cast into\r\nutter darkness during the millennium of theological scholasticism. But\r\nDarwin poured new life-blood into the ancient frame; the bonds burst,\r\nand the revivified thought of ancient Greece has proved itself to be a\r\nmore adequate expression of the universal order of things than any of\r\nthe schemes which have been accepted by the credulity and welcomed by\r\nthe superstition of seventy later generations of men.\r\n\r\nTo any one who studies the signs of the times, the emergence of the\r\nphilosophy of Evolution, in the attitude of claimant to the throne\r\nof the world of thought, from the limbo of hated and, as many hoped,\r\nforgotten things, is the most portentous event of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. But the most effective weapons of the modern champions of\r\nEvolution were fabricated by Darwin; and the 'Origin of Species' has\r\nenlisted a formidable body of combatants, trained in the severe school\r\nof Physical Science, whose ears might have long remained deaf to the\r\nspeculations of a priori philosophers.\r\n\r\nI do not think any candid or instructed person will deny the truth\r\nof that which has just been asserted. He may hate the very name of\r\nEvolution, and may deny its pretensions as vehemently as a Jacobite\r\ndenied those of George the Second. But there it is--not only as\r\nsolidly seated as the Hanoverian dynasty, but happily independent of\r\nParliamentary sanction--and the dullest antagonists have come to see\r\nthat they have to deal with an adversary whose bones are to be broken by\r\nno amount of bad words.\r\n\r\nEven the theologians have almost ceased to pit the plain meaning of\r\nGenesis against the no less plain meaning of Nature. Their more candid,\r\nor more cautious, representatives have given up dealing with Evolution\r\nas if it were a damnable heresy, and have taken refuge in one of two\r\ncourses. Either they deny that Genesis was meant to teach scientific\r\ntruth, and thus save the veracity of the record at the expense of\r\nits authority; or they expend their energies in devising the cruel\r\ningenuities of the reconciler, and torture texts in the vain hope of\r\nmaking them confess the creed of Science. But when the peine forte et\r\ndure is over, the antique sincerity of the venerable sufferer always\r\nreasserts itself. Genesis is honest to the core, and professes to be no\r\nmore than it is, a repository of venerable traditions of unknown origin,\r\nclaiming no scientific authority and possessing none.\r\n\r\nAs my pen finishes these passages, I can but be amused to think what\r\na terrible hubbub would have been made (in truth was made) about any\r\nsimilar expressions of opinion a quarter of a century ago. In fact,\r\nthe contrast between the present condition of public opinion upon the\r\nDarwinian question; between the estimation in which Darwin's views are\r\nnow held in the scientific world; between the acquiescence, or at least\r\nquiescence, of the theologians of the self-respecting order at the\r\npresent day and the outburst of antagonism on all sides in 1858-9, when\r\nthe new theory respecting the origin of species first became known to\r\nthe older generation to which I belong, is so startling that, except\r\nfor documentary evidence, I should be sometimes inclined to think my\r\nmemories dreams. I have a great respect for the younger generation\r\nmyself (they can write our lives, and ravel out all our follies, if\r\nthey choose to take the trouble, by and by), and I should be glad to be\r\nassured that the feeling is reciprocal; but I am afraid that the\r\nstory of our dealings with Darwin may prove a great hindrance to that\r\nveneration for our wisdom which I should like them to display. We have\r\nnot even the excuse that, thirty years ago, Mr. Darwin was an obscure\r\nnovice, who had no claims on our attention. On the contrary, his\r\nremarkable zoological and geological investigations had long given him\r\nan assured position among the most eminent and original investigators of\r\nthe day; while his charming 'Voyage of a Naturalist' had justly earned\r\nhim a wide-spread reputation among the general public. I doubt if there\r\nwas any man then living who had a better right to expect that anything\r\nhe might choose to say on such a question as the Origin of Species would\r\nbe listened to with profound attention, and discussed with respect; and\r\nthere was certainly no man whose personal character should have afforded\r\na better safeguard against attacks, instinct with malignity and spiced\r\nwith shameless impertinences.\r\n\r\nYet such was the portion of one of the kindest and truest men that it\r\nwas ever my good fortune to know; and years had to pass away before\r\nmisrepresentation, ridicule, and denunciation, ceased to be the most\r\nnotable constituents of the majority of the multitudinous criticisms\r\nof his work which poured from the press. I am loth to rake any of these\r\nancient scandals from their well-deserved oblivion; but I must make good\r\na statement which may seem overcharged to the present generation, and\r\nthere is no piece justificative more apt for the purpose, or more worthy\r\nof such dishonour, than the article in the 'Quarterly Review' for July,\r\n1860. (I was not aware when I wrote these passages that the authorship\r\nof the article had been publicly acknowledged. Confession unaccompanied\r\nby penitence, however, affords no ground for mitigation of judgment;\r\nand the kindliness with which Mr. Darwin speaks of his assailant, Bishop\r\nWilberforce (vol. ii.), is so striking an exemplification of his singular\r\ngentleness and modesty, that it rather increases one's indignation\r\nagainst the presumption of his critic.) Since Lord Brougham assailed Dr.\r\nYoung, the world has seen no such specimen of the insolence of a shallow\r\npretender to a Master in Science as this remarkable production, in which\r\none of the most exact of observers, most cautious of reasoners, and most\r\ncandid of expositors, of this or any other age, is held up to scorn as\r\na \"flighty\" person, who endeavours \"to prop up his utterly rotten fabric\r\nof guess and speculation,\" and whose \"mode of dealing with nature\" is\r\nreprobated as \"utterly dishonourable to Natural Science.\" And all this\r\nhigh and mighty talk, which would have been indecent in one of Mr.\r\nDarwin's equals, proceeds from a writer whose want of intelligence, or\r\nof conscience, or of both, is so great, that, by way of an objection\r\nto Mr. Darwin's views, he can ask, \"Is it credible that all favourable\r\nvarieties of turnips are tending to become men;\" who is so ignorant of\r\npaleontology, that he can talk of the \"flowers and fruits\" of the plants\r\nof the carboniferous epoch; of comparative anatomy, that he can gravely\r\naffirm the poison apparatus of the venomous snakes to be \"entirely\r\nseparate from the ordinary laws of animal life, and peculiar to\r\nthemselves;\" of the rudiments of physiology, that he can ask, \"what\r\nadvantage of life could alter the shape of the corpuscles into which\r\nthe blood can be evaporated?\" Nor does the reviewer fail to flavour this\r\noutpouring of preposterous incapacity with a little stimulation of the\r\nodium theologicum. Some inkling of the history of the conflicts between\r\nAstronomy, Geology, and Theology, leads him to keep a retreat open by\r\nthe proviso that he cannot \"consent to test the truth of Natural Science\r\nby the word of Revelation;\" but, for all that, he devotes pages to the\r\nexposition of his conviction that Mr. Darwin's theory \"contradicts the\r\nrevealed relation of the creation to its Creator,\" and is \"inconsistent\r\nwith the fulness of his glory.\"\r\n\r\nIf I confine my retrospect of the reception of the 'Origin of Species'\r\nto a twelvemonth, or thereabouts, from the time of its publication, I do\r\nnot recollect anything quite so foolish and unmannerly as the 'Quarterly\r\nReview' article, unless, perhaps, the address of a Reverend Professor to\r\nthe Dublin Geological Society might enter into competition with it. But\r\na large proportion of Mr. Darwin's critics had a lamentable resemblance\r\nto the 'Quarterly' reviewer, in so far as they lacked either the will,\r\nor the wit, to make themselves masters of his doctrine; hardly any\r\npossessed the knowledge required to follow him through the immense range\r\nof biological and geological science which the 'Origin' covered; while,\r\ntoo commonly, they had prejudiced the case on theological grounds, and,\r\nas seems to be inevitable when this happens, eked out lack of reason by\r\nsuperfluity of railing.\r\n\r\nBut it will be more pleasant and more profitable to consider those\r\ncriticisms, which were acknowledged by writers of scientific authority,\r\nor which bore internal evidence of the greater or less competency and,\r\noften, of the good faith, of their authors. Restricting my survey to a\r\ntwelvemonth, or thereabouts, after the publication of the 'Origin,'\r\nI find among such critics Louis Agassiz (\"The arguments presented by\r\nDarwin in favor of a universal derivation from one primary form of all\r\nthe peculiarities existing now among living beings have not made the\r\nslightest impression on my mind.\")\r\n\r\n\"Until the facts of Nature are shown to have been mistaken by those who\r\nhave collected them, and that they have a different meaning from\r\nthat now generally assigned to them, I shall therefore consider the\r\ntransmutation theory as a scientific mistake, untrue in its\r\nfacts, unscientific in its method, and mischievous in its\r\ntendency.\"--Silliman's 'Journal,' July, 1860, pages 143, 154. Extract\r\nfrom the 3rd volume of 'Contributions to the Natural History of the\r\nUnited States.'); Murray, an excellent entomologist; Harvey, a botanist\r\nof considerable repute; and the author of an article in the 'Edinburgh\r\nReview,' all strongly adverse to Darwin. Pictet, the distinguished and\r\nwidely learned paleontogist of Geneva, treats Mr. Darwin with a respect\r\nwhich forms a grateful contrast to the tone of some of the preceding\r\nwriters, but consents to go with him only a very little way. (\"I see no\r\nserious objections to the formation of varieties by natural selection\r\nin the existing world, and that, so far as earlier epochs are concerned,\r\nthis law may be assumed to explain the origin of closely allied species,\r\nsupposing for this purpose a very long period of time.\"\r\n\r\n\"With regard to simple varieties and closely allied species, I believe\r\nthat Mr. Darwin's theory may explain many things, and throw a great\r\nlight upon numerous questions.\"--'Sur l'Origine de l'Espece. Par Charles\r\nDarwin.' ('Archives des Sc. de la Bibliotheque Universelle de Geneve,'\r\npages 242, 243, Mars 1860.) On the other hand, Lyell, up to that time a\r\npillar of the anti-transmutationists (who regarded him, ever afterwards,\r\nas Pallas Athene may have looked at Dian, after the Endymion affair),\r\ndeclared himself a Darwinian, though not without putting in a serious\r\ncaveat. Nevertheless, he was a tower of strength, and his courageous\r\nstand for truth as against consistency, did him infinite honour. As\r\nevolutionists, sans phrase, I do not call to mind among the biologists\r\nmore than Asa Gray, who fought the battle splendidly in the United\r\nStates; Hooker, who was no less vigorous here; the present Sir John\r\nLubbock and myself. Wallace was far away in the Malay Archipelago; but,\r\napart from his direct share in the promulgation of the theory of natural\r\nselection, no enumeration of the influences at work, at the time I am\r\nspeaking of, would be complete without the mention of his powerful essay\r\n'On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species,' which\r\nwas published in 1855. On reading it afresh, I have been astonished to\r\nrecollect how small was the impression it made.\r\n\r\nIn France, the influence of Elie de Beaumont and of Flourens--the\r\nformer of whom is said to have \"damned himself to everlasting fame\" by\r\ninventing the nickname of \"la science moussante\" for Evolutionism\r\n(One is reminded of the effect of another small academic epigram. The\r\nso-called vertebral theory of the skull is said to have been nipped in\r\nthe bud in France by the whisper of an academician to his neighbour,\r\nthat, in that case, one's head was a \"vertebre pensante.\"),--to say\r\nnothing of the ill-will of other powerful members of the Institut,\r\nproduced for a long time the effect of a conspiracy of silence; and many\r\nyears passed before the Academy redeemed itself from the reproach that\r\nthe name of Darwin was not to be found on the list of its members.\r\nHowever, an accomplished writer, out of the range of academical\r\ninfluences, M. Laugel, gave an excellent and appreciative notice of the\r\n'Origin' in the 'Revue des Deux Mondes.' Germany took time to consider;\r\nBronn produced a slightly Bowdlerized translation of the 'Origin'; and\r\n'Kladderadatsch' cut his jokes upon the ape origin of man; but I do not\r\ncall to mind that any scientific notability declared himself publicly\r\nin 1860. (However, the man who stands next to Darwin in his influence\r\non modern biologists, K.E. von Baer, wrote to me, in August 1860,\r\nexpressing his general assent to evolutionist views. His phrase, \"J'ai\r\nenonce les memes idees...que M. Darwin\" (volume ii.) is shown by his\r\nsubsequent writings to mean no more than this.) None of us dreamed that,\r\nin the course of a few years, the strength (and perhaps I may add\r\nthe weakness) of \"Darwinismus\" would have its most extensive and most\r\nbrilliant illustrations in the land of learning. If a foreigner may\r\npresume to speculate on the cause of this curious interval of silence,\r\nI fancy it was that one moiety of the German biologists were orthodox at\r\nany price, and the other moiety as distinctly heterodox. The latter were\r\nevolutionists, a priori, already, and they must have felt the disgust\r\nnatural to deductive philosophers at being offered an inductive and\r\nexperimental foundation for a conviction which they had reached by\r\na shorter cut. It is undoubtedly trying to learn that, though your\r\nconclusions may be all right, your reasons for them are all wrong, or,\r\nat any rate, insufficient.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, the supporters of Mr. Darwin's views in 1860 were\r\nnumerically extremely insignificant. There is not the slightest doubt\r\nthat, if a general council of the Church scientific had been held at\r\nthat time, we should have been condemned by an overwhelming majority.\r\nAnd there is as little doubt that, if such a council gathered now, the\r\ndecree would be of an exactly contrary nature. It would indicate a\r\nlack of sense, as well as of modesty, to ascribe to the men of that\r\ngeneration less capacity or less honesty than their successors possess.\r\nWhat, then, are the causes which led instructed and fair-judging men of\r\nthat day to arrive at a judgment so different from that which seems\r\njust and fair to those who follow them? That is really one of the most\r\ninteresting of all questions connected with the history of science, and\r\nI shall try to answer it. I am afraid that in order to do so I must run\r\nthe risk of appearing egotistical. However, if I tell my own story it is\r\nonly because I know it better than that of other people.\r\n\r\nI think I must have read the 'Vestiges' before I left England in 1846;\r\nbut, if I did, the book made very little impression upon me, and I was\r\nnot brought into serious contact with the 'Species' question until after\r\n1850. At that time, I had long done with the Pentateuchal cosmogony,\r\nwhich had been impressed upon my childish understanding as Divine truth,\r\nwith all the authority of parents and instructors, and from which it\r\nhad cost me many a struggle to get free. But my mind was unbiassed in\r\nrespect of any doctrine which presented itself, if it professed to be\r\nbased on purely philosophical and scientific reasoning. It seemed to\r\nme then (as it does now) that \"creation,\" in the ordinary sense of the\r\nword, is perfectly conceivable. I find no difficulty in imagining that,\r\nat some former period, this universe was not in existence; and that\r\nit made its appearance in six days (or instantaneously, if that is\r\npreferred), in consequence of the volition of some pre-existent Being.\r\nThen, as now, the so-called a priori arguments against Theism; and,\r\ngiven a Deity, against the possibility of creative acts, appeared to me\r\nto be devoid of reasonable foundation. I had not then, and I have not\r\nnow, the smallest a priori objection to raise to the account of the\r\ncreation of animals and plants given in 'Paradise Lost,' in which Milton\r\nso vividly embodies the natural sense of Genesis. Far be it from me to\r\nsay that it is untrue because it is impossible. I confine myself to what\r\nmust be regarded as a modest and reasonable request for some particle of\r\nevidence that the existing species of animals and plants did originate\r\nin that way, as a condition of my belief in a statement which appears to\r\nme to be highly improbable.\r\n\r\nAnd, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the same answer to\r\ngive to the evolutionists of 1851-8. Within the ranks of the biologists,\r\nat that time, I met with nobody, except Dr. Grant, of University\r\nCollege, who had a word to say for Evolution--and his advocacy was not\r\ncalculated to advance the cause. Outside these ranks, the only person\r\nknown to me whose knowledge and capacity compelled respect, and who\r\nwas, at the same time, a thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in 1852, and then entered\r\ninto the bonds of a friendship which, I am happy to think, has known\r\nno interruption. Many and prolonged were the battles we fought on this\r\ntopic. But even my friend's rare dialectic skill and copiousness of apt\r\nillustration could not drive me from my agnostic position. I took my\r\nstand upon two grounds: firstly, that up to that time, the evidence in\r\nfavour of transmutation was wholly insufficient; and secondly, that no\r\nsuggestion respecting the causes of the transmutation assumed, which\r\nhad been made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. Looking\r\nback at the state of knowledge at that time, I really do not see that\r\nany other conclusion was justifiable.\r\n\r\nIn those days I had never even heard of Treviranus' 'Biologie.' However,\r\nI had studied Lamarck attentively and I had read the 'Vestiges' with due\r\ncare; but neither of them afforded me any good ground for changing my\r\nnegative and critical attitude. As for the 'Vestiges,' I confess that\r\nthe book simply irritated me by the prodigious ignorance and thoroughly\r\nunscientific habit of mind manifested by the writer. If it had any\r\ninfluence on me at all, it set me against Evolution; and the only\r\nreview I ever have qualms of conscience about, on the ground of needless\r\nsavagery, is one I wrote on the 'Vestiges' while under that influence.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the 'Philosophie Zoologique,' it is no reproach to\r\nLamarck to say that the discussion of the Species question in that work,\r\nwhatever might be said for it in 1809, was miserably below the level\r\nof the knowledge of half a century later. In that interval of time the\r\nelucidation of the structure of the lower animals and plants had\r\ngiven rise to wholly new conceptions of their relations; histology and\r\nembryology, in the modern sense, had been created; physiology had been\r\nreconstituted; the facts of distribution, geological and geographical,\r\nhad been prodigiously multiplied and reduced to order. To any biologist\r\nwhose studies had carried him beyond mere species-mongering in 1850,\r\none-half of Lamarck's arguments were obsolete and the other half\r\nerroneous, or defective, in virtue of omitting to deal with the various\r\nclasses of evidence which had been brought to light since his time.\r\nMoreover his one suggestion as to the cause of the gradual modification\r\nof species--effort excited by change of conditions--was, on the face of\r\nit, inapplicable to the whole vegetable world. I do not think that any\r\nimpartial judge who reads the 'Philosophie Zoologique' now, and who\r\nafterwards takes up Lyell's trenchant and effectual criticism (published\r\nas far back as 1830), will be disposed to allot to Lamarck a much higher\r\nplace in the establishment of biological evolution than that which\r\nBacon assigns to himself in relation to physical science\r\ngenerally,--buccinator tantum. (Erasmus Darwin first promulgated\r\nLamarck's fundamental conceptions, and, with greater logical\r\nconsistency, he had applied them to plants. But the advocates of his\r\nclaims have failed to show that he, in any respect, anticipated the\r\ncentral idea of the 'Origin of Species.')\r\n\r\nBut, by a curious irony of fate, the same influence which led me to\r\nput as little faith in modern speculations on this subject, as in the\r\nvenerable traditions recorded in the first two chapters of Genesis,\r\nwas perhaps more potent than any other in keeping alive a sort of\r\npious conviction that Evolution, after all, would turn out true. I have\r\nrecently read afresh the first edition of the 'Principles of Geology';\r\nand when I consider that this remarkable book had been nearly thirty\r\nyears in everybody's hands, and that it brings home to any reader of\r\nordinary intelligence a great principle and a great fact--the principle,\r\nthat the past must be explained by the present, unless good cause be\r\nshown to the contrary; and the fact, that, so far as our knowledge of\r\nthe past history of life on our globe goes, no such cause can be shown\r\n(The same principle and the same fact guide the result from all sound\r\nhistorical investigation. Grote's 'History of Greece' is a product of\r\nthe same intellectual movement as Lyell's 'Principles.')--I cannot but\r\nbelieve that Lyell, for others, as for myself, was the chief agent\r\nfor smoothing the road for Darwin. For consistent uniformitarianism\r\npostulates evolution as much in the organic as in the inorganic world.\r\nThe origin of a new species by other than ordinary agencies would be a\r\nvastly greater \"catastrophe\" than any of those which Lyell successfully\r\neliminated from sober geological speculation.\r\n\r\nIn fact, no one was better aware of this than Lyell himself. (Lyell,\r\nwith perfect right, claims this position for himself. He speaks of\r\nhaving \"advocated a law of continuity even in the organic world, so far\r\nas possible without adopting Lamarck's theory of transmutation\"...)\r\n\r\n\"But while I taught that as often as certain forms of animals and plants\r\ndisappeared, for reasons quite intelligible to us, others took their\r\nplace by virtue of a causation which was beyond our comprehension; it\r\nremained for Darwin to accumulate proof that there is no break between\r\nthe incoming and the outgoing species, that they are the work of\r\nevolution, and not of special creation...\r\n\r\n\"I had certainly prepared the way in this country, in six editions of my\r\nwork before the 'Vestiges of Creation' appeared in 1842 [1844], for\r\nthe reception of Darwin's gradual and insensible evolution of\r\nspecies.\"--('Life and Letters,' Letter to Haeckel, volume ii. page 436.\r\nNovember 23, 1868.) If one reads any of the earlier editions of the\r\n'Principles' carefully (especially by the light of the interesting\r\nseries of letters recently published by Sir Charles Lyell's biographer),\r\nit is easy to see that, with all his energetic opposition to Lamarck, on\r\nthe one hand, and to the ideal quasi-progressionism of Agassiz, on the\r\nother, Lyell, in his own mind, was strongly disposed to account for the\r\norigination of all past and present species of living things by natural\r\ncauses. But he would have liked, at the same time, to keep the name of\r\ncreation for a natural process which he imagined to be incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nIn a letter addressed to Mantell (dated March 2, 1827), Lyell speaks\r\nof having just read Lamarck; he expresses his delight at Lamarck's\r\ntheories, and his personal freedom from any objection based on\r\ntheological grounds. And though he is evidently alarmed at the pithecoid\r\norigin of man involved in Lamarck's doctrine, he observes:--\r\n\r\n\"But, after all, what changes species may really undergo! How impossible\r\nwill it be to distinguish and lay down a line, beyond which some of the\r\nso-called extinct species have never passed into recent ones.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, the following remarkable passage occurs in the postscript of a\r\nletter addressed to Sir John Herschel in 1836:--\r\n\r\n\"In regard to the origination of new species, I am very glad to find\r\nthat you think it probable that it may be carried on through the\r\nintervention of intermediate causes. I left this rather to be inferred,\r\nnot thinking it worth while to offend a certain class of persons by\r\nembodying in words what would only be a speculation.\" (In the same\r\nsense, see the letter to Whewell, March 7, 1837, volume ii., page 5):--\r\n\r\n\"In regard to this last subject [the changes from one set of animal and\r\nvegetable species to another]...you remember what Herschel said in his\r\nletter to me. If I had stated as plainly as he has done the possibility\r\nof the introduction or origination of fresh species being a natural, in\r\ncontradistinction to a miraculous process, I should have raised a host\r\nof prejudices against me, which are unfortunately opposed at every\r\nstep to any philosopher who attempts to address the public on these\r\nmysterious subjects.\" See also letter to Sedgwick, January 12, 1838 ii.\r\npage 35.) He goes on to refer to the criticisms which have been directed\r\nagainst him on the ground that, by leaving species to be originated by\r\nmiracle, he is inconsistent with his own doctrine of uniformitarianism;\r\nand he leaves it to be understood that he had not replied, on the ground\r\nof his general objection to controversy.\r\n\r\nLyell's contemporaries were not without some inkling of his esoteric\r\ndoctrine. Whewell's 'History of the Inductive Sciences,' whatever its\r\nphilosophical value, is always worth reading and always interesting, if\r\nunder no other aspect than that of an evidence of the speculative limits\r\nwithin which a highly-placed divine might, at that time, safely range\r\nat will. In the course of his discussion of uniformitarianism, the\r\nencyclopaedic Master of Trinity observes:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lyell, indeed, has spoken of an hypothesis that 'the successive\r\ncreation of species may constitute a regular part of the economy of\r\nnature,' but he has nowhere, I think, so described this process as\r\nto make it appear in what department of science we are to place the\r\nhypothesis. Are these new species created by the production, at long\r\nintervals, of an offspring different in species from the parents? Or\r\nare the species so created produced without parents? Are they gradually\r\nevolved from some embryo substance? Or do they suddenly start from the\r\nground, as in the creation of the poet?...\r\n\r\n\"Some selection of one of these forms of the hypothesis, rather than the\r\nothers, with evidence for the selection, is requisite to entitle us to\r\nplace it among the known causes of change, which in this chapter we are\r\nconsidering. The bare conviction that a creation of species has taken\r\nplace, whether once or many times, so long as it is unconnected with\r\nour organical sciences, is a tenet of Natural Theology rather than of\r\nPhysical Philosophy.\" (Whewell's 'History,' volume iii. page 639-640\r\n(Edition 2, 1847.))\r\n\r\nThe earlier part of this criticism appears perfectly just and\r\nappropriate; but, from the concluding paragraph, Whewell evidently\r\nimagines that by \"creation\" Lyell means a preternatural intervention of\r\nthe Deity; whereas the letter to Herschel shows that, in his own\r\nmind, Lyell meant natural causation; and I see no reason to doubt (The\r\nfollowing passages in Lyell's letters appear to me decisive on this\r\npoint):--\r\n\r\nTo Darwin, October 3, 1859 (ii, 325), on first reading the 'Origin.'\r\n\r\n\"I have long seen most clearly that if any concession is made, all that\r\nyou claim in your concluding pages will follow.\r\n\r\n\"It is this which has made me so long hesitate, always feeling that the\r\ncase of Man and his Races, and of other animals, and that of plants, is\r\none and the same, and that if a vera causa be admitted for one instant,\r\n[instead] of a purely unknown and imaginary one, such as the word\r\n'creation,' all the consequences must follow.\"\r\n\r\nTo Darwin, March 15, 1863 (volume ii. page 365).\r\n\r\n\"I remember that it was the conclusion he [Lamarck] came to about man\r\nthat fortified me thirty years ago against the great impression which\r\nhis arguments at first made on my mind, all the greater because Constant\r\nPrevost, a pupil of Cuvier's forty years ago, told me his conviction\r\n'that Cuvier thought species not real, but that science could not\r\nadvance without assuming that they were so.'\"\r\n\r\nTo Hooker, March 9, 1863 (volume ii. page 361), in reference to Darwin's\r\nfeeling about the 'Antiquity of Man.'\r\n\r\n\"He [Darwin] seems much disappointed that I do not go farther with him,\r\nor do not speak out more. I can only say that I have spoken out to\r\nthe full extent of my present convictions, and even beyond my state of\r\nFEELING as to man's unbroken descent from the brutes, and I find I am\r\nhalf converting not a few who were in arms against Darwin, and are even\r\nnow against Huxley.\" He speaks of having had to abandon \"old and long\r\ncherished ideas, which constituted the charm to me of the theoretical\r\npart of the science in my earlier day, when I believed with Pascal in\r\nthe theory, as Hallam terms it, of 'the arch-angel ruined.'\"\r\n\r\nSee the same sentiment in the letter to Darwin, March 11, 1863, page\r\n363:--\r\n\r\n\"I think the old 'creation' is almost as much required as ever, but\r\nof course it takes a new form if Lamarck's views improved by yours\r\nare adopted.\" that, if Sir Charles could have avoided the inevitable\r\ncorollary of the pithecoid origin of man--for which, to the end of his\r\nlife, he entertained a profound antipathy--he would have advocated the\r\nefficiency of causes now in operation to bring about the condition\r\nof the organic world, as stoutly as he championed that doctrine in\r\nreference to inorganic nature.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that a discerning eye might have seen that some form or\r\nother of the doctrine of transmutation was inevitable, from the time\r\nwhen the truth enunciated by William Smith that successive strata are\r\ncharacterised by different kinds of fossil remains, became a firmly\r\nestablished law of nature. No one has set forth the speculative\r\nconsequences of this generalisation better than the historian of the\r\n'Inductive Sciences':--\r\n\r\n\"But the study of geology opens to us the spectacle of many groups of\r\nspecies which have, in the course of the earth's history, succeeded\r\neach other at vast intervals of time; one set of animals and plants\r\ndisappearing, as it would seem, from the face of our planet, and others,\r\nwhich did not before exist, becoming the only occupants of the globe.\r\nAnd the dilemma then presents itself to us anew:--either we must accept\r\nthe doctrine of the transmutation of species, and must suppose that the\r\norganized species of one geological epoch were transmuted into those\r\nof another by some long-continued agency of natural causes; or else,\r\nwe must believe in many successive acts of creation and extinction of\r\nspecies, out of the common course of nature; acts which, therefore,\r\nwe may properly call miraculous.\" (Whewell's 'History of the Inductive\r\nSciences.' Edition ii., 1847, volume iii. pages 624-625. See for the\r\nauthor's verdict, pages 638- 39.)\r\n\r\nDr. Whewell decides in favour of the latter conclusion. And if any one\r\nhad plied him with the four questions which he puts to Lyell in the\r\npassage already cited, all that can be said now is that he would\r\ncertainly have rejected the first. But would he really have had the\r\ncourage to say that a Rhinoceros tichorhinus, for instance, \"was\r\nproduced without parents;\" or was \"evolved from some embryo substance;\"\r\nor that it suddenly started from the ground like Milton's lion \"pawing\r\nto get free his hinder parts.\" I permit myself to doubt whether even\r\nthe Master of Trinity's well-tried courage--physical, intellectual,\r\nand moral--would have been equal to this feat. No doubt the sudden\r\nconcurrence of half-a-ton of inorganic molecules into a live rhinoceros\r\nis conceivable, and therefore may be possible. But does such an event\r\nlie sufficiently within the bounds of probability to justify the\r\nbelief in its occurrence on the strength of any attainable, or, indeed,\r\nimaginable, evidence?\r\n\r\nIn view of the assertion (often repeated in the early days of the\r\nopposition to Darwin) that he had added nothing to Lamarck, it is very\r\ninteresting to observe that the possibility of a fifth alternative, in\r\naddition to the four he has stated, has not dawned upon Dr. Whewell's\r\nmind. The suggestion that new species may result from the selective\r\naction of external conditions upon the variations from their specific\r\ntype which individuals present--and which we call \"spontaneous,\"\r\nbecause we are ignorant of their causation--is as wholly unknown to the\r\nhistorian of scientific ideas as it was to biological specialists\r\nbefore 1858. But that suggestion is the central idea of the 'Origin of\r\nSpecies,' and contains the quintessence of Darwinism.\r\n\r\nThus, looking back into the past, it seems to me that my own position\r\nof critical expectancy was just and reasonable, and must have been taken\r\nup, on the same grounds, by many other persons. If Agassiz told me that\r\nthe forms of life which had successively tenanted the globe were the\r\nincarnations of successive thoughts of the Deity; and that he had wiped\r\nout one set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe\r\nas soon as His ideas took a more advanced shape, I found myself not\r\nonly unable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the facts of\r\npaleontology, upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I\r\nhad to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness of his\r\nexplanation of them. And besides that, I could by no means see what the\r\nexplanation explained. Neither did it help me to be told by an eminent\r\nanatomist that species had succeeded one another in time, in virtue of\r\n\"a continuously operative creational law.\" That seemed to me to be no\r\nmore than saying that species had succeeded one another, in the form of\r\na vote-catching resolution, with \"law\" to please the man of science,\r\nand \"creational\" to draw the orthodox. So I took refuge in that \"thatige\r\nSkepsis\" which Goethe has so well defined; and, reversing the apostolic\r\nprecept to be all things to all men, I usually defended the tenability\r\nof the received doctrines, when I had to do with the transmutationists;\r\nand stood up for the possibility of transmutation among the\r\northodox--thereby, no doubt, increasing an already current, but quite\r\nundeserved, reputation for needless combativeness.\r\n\r\nI remember, in the course of my first interview with Mr. Darwin,\r\nexpressing my belief in the sharpness of the lines of demarcation\r\nbetween natural groups and in the absence of transitional forms, with\r\nall the confidence of youth and imperfect knowledge. I was not aware,\r\nat that time, that he had then been many years brooding over the\r\nspecies-question; and the humorous smile which accompanied his gentle\r\nanswer, that such was not altogether his view, long haunted and puzzled\r\nme. But it would seem that four or five years' hard work had enabled me\r\nto understand what it meant; for Lyell ('Life and Letters,' volume ii.\r\npage 212.), writing to Sir Charles Bunbury (under date of April 30,\r\n1856), says:--\r\n\r\n\"When Huxley, Hooker, and Wollaston were at Darwin's last week they (all\r\nfour of them) ran a tilt against species--further, I believe, than they\r\nare prepared to go.\"\r\n\r\nI recollect nothing of this beyond the fact of meeting Mr. Wollaston;\r\nand except for Sir Charles' distinct assurance as to \"all four,\" I\r\nshould have thought my \"outrecuidance\" was probably a counterblast to\r\nWollaston's conservatism. With regard to Hooker, he was already,\r\nlike Voltaire's Habbakuk, \"capable du tout\" in the way of advocating\r\nEvolution.\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, I imagine that most of those of my\r\ncontemporaries who thought seriously about the matter, were very much\r\nin my own state of mind--inclined to say to both Mosaists and\r\nEvolutionists, \"a plague on both your houses!\" and disposed to turn\r\naside from an interminable and apparently fruitless discussion,\r\nto labour in the fertile fields of ascertainable fact. And I may,\r\ntherefore, further suppose that the publication of the Darwin and\r\nWallace papers in 1858, and still more that of the 'Origin' in 1859, had\r\nthe effect upon them of the flash of light, which to a man who has lost\r\nhimself in a dark night, suddenly reveals a road which, whether it takes\r\nhim straight home or not, certainly goes his way. That which we were\r\nlooking for, and could not find, was a hypothesis respecting the origin\r\nof known organic forms, which assumed the operation of no causes but\r\nsuch as could be proved to be actually at work. We wanted, not to pin\r\nour faith to that or any other speculation, but to get hold of clear and\r\ndefinite conceptions which could be brought face to face with facts and\r\nhave their validity tested. The 'Origin' provided us with the working\r\nhypothesis we sought. Moreover, it did the immense service of freeing us\r\nfor ever from the dilemma--refuse to accept the creation hypothesis, and\r\nwhat have you to propose that can be accepted by any cautious reasoner?\r\nIn 1857, I had no answer ready, and I do not think that any one else\r\nhad. A year later, we reproached ourselves with dullness for being\r\nperplexed by such an inquiry. My reflection, when I first made myself\r\nmaster of the central idea of the 'Origin,' was, \"How extremely stupid\r\nnot to have thought of that!\" I suppose that Columbus' companions\r\nsaid much the same when he made the egg stand on end. The facts of\r\nvariability, of the struggle for existence, of adaptation to conditions,\r\nwere notorious enough; but none of us had suspected that the road to the\r\nheart of the species problem lay through them, until Darwin and Wallace\r\ndispelled the darkness, and the beacon-fire of the 'Origin' guided the\r\nbenighted.\r\n\r\nWhether the particular shape which the doctrine of evolution, as applied\r\nto the organic world, took in Darwin's hands, would prove to be final or\r\nnot, was, to me, a matter of indifference. In my earliest criticisms\r\nof the 'Origin' I ventured to point out that its logical foundation was\r\ninsecure so long as experiments in selective breeding had not produced\r\nvarieties which were more or less infertile; and that insecurity remains\r\nup to the present time. But, with any and every critical doubt which\r\nmy sceptical ingenuity could suggest, the Darwinian hypothesis remained\r\nincomparably more probable than the creation hypothesis. And if we had\r\nnone of us been able to discern the paramount significance of some of\r\nthe most patent and notorious of natural facts, until they were, so\r\nto speak, thrust under our noses, what force remained in the\r\ndilemma--creation or nothing? It was obvious that, hereafter, the\r\nprobability would be immensely greater, that the links of natural\r\ncausation were hidden from our purblind eyes, than that natural\r\ncausation should be incompetent to produce all the phenomena of nature.\r\nThe only rational course for those who had no other object than the\r\nattainment of truth, was to accept \"Darwinism\" as a working hypothesis,\r\nand see what could be made of it. Either it would prove its capacity to\r\nelucidate the facts of organic life, or it would break down under the\r\nstrain. This was surely the dictate of common sense; and, for once,\r\ncommon sense carried the day. The result has been that complete\r\nvolte-face of the whole scientific world, which must seem so surprising\r\nto the present generation. I do not mean to say that all the leaders of\r\nbiological science have avowed themselves Darwinians; but I do not think\r\nthat there is a single zoologist, or botanist, or palaeontologist, among\r\nthe multitude of active workers of this generation, who is other than an\r\nevolutionist, profoundly influenced by Darwin's views. Whatever may\r\nbe the ultimate fate of the particular theory put forth by Darwin, I\r\nventure to affirm that, so far as my knowledge goes, all the ingenuity\r\nand all the learning of hostile critics have not enabled them to adduce\r\na solitary fact, of which it can be said, this is irreconcilable with\r\nthe Darwinian theory. In the prodigious variety and complexity of\r\norganic nature, there are multitudes of phenomena which are not\r\ndeducible from any generalisations we have yet reached. But the same\r\nmay be said of every other class of natural objects. I believe that\r\nastronomers cannot yet get the moon's motions into perfect accordance\r\nwith the theory of gravitation.\r\n\r\nIt would be inappropriate, even if it were possible, to discuss the\r\ndifficulties and unresolved problems which have hitherto met the\r\nevolutionist, and which will probably continue to puzzle him for\r\ngenerations to come, in the course of this brief history of the\r\nreception of Mr. Darwin's great work. But there are two or three\r\nobjections of a more general character, based, or supposed to be based,\r\nupon philosophical and theological foundations, which were loudly\r\nexpressed in the early days of the Darwinian controversy, and which,\r\nthough they have been answered over and over again, crop up now and then\r\nto the present day.\r\n\r\nThe most singular of these, perhaps immortal, fallacies, which live on,\r\nTithonus-like, when sense and force have long deserted them, is that\r\nwhich charges Mr. Darwin with having attempted to reinstate the old\r\npagan goddess, Chance. It is said that he supposes variations to come\r\nabout \"by chance,\" and that the fittest survive the \"chances\" of\r\nthe struggle for existence, and thus \"chance\" is substituted for\r\nprovidential design.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little wonderful that such an accusation as this should\r\nbe brought against a writer who has, over and over again, warned his\r\nreaders that when he uses the word \"spontaneous,\" he merely means that\r\nhe is ignorant of the cause of that which is so termed; and whose whole\r\ntheory crumbles to pieces if the uniformity and regularity of natural\r\ncausation for illimitable past ages is denied. But probably the best\r\nanswer to those who talk of Darwinism meaning the reign of \"chance,\" is\r\nto ask them what they themselves understand by \"chance\"? Do they believe\r\nthat anything in this universe happens without reason or without a\r\ncause? Do they really conceive that any event has no cause, and could\r\nnot have been predicted by any one who had a sufficient insight into\r\nthe order of Nature? If they do, it is they who are the inheritors of\r\nantique superstition and ignorance, and whose minds have never been\r\nillumined by a ray of scientific thought. The one act of faith in the\r\nconvert to science, is the confession of the universality of order and\r\nof the absolute validity in all times and under all circumstances, of\r\nthe law of causation. This confession is an act of faith, because,\r\nby the nature of the case, the truth of such propositions is not\r\nsusceptible of proof. But such faith is not blind, but reasonable;\r\nbecause it is invariably confirmed by experience, and constitutes the\r\nsole trustworthy foundation for all action.\r\n\r\nIf one of these people, in whom the chance-worship of our remoter\r\nancestors thus strangely survives, should be within reach of the sea\r\nwhen a heavy gale is blowing, let him betake himself to the shore and\r\nwatch the scene. Let him note the infinite variety of form and size of\r\nthe tossing waves out at sea; or of the curves of their foam-crested\r\nbreakers, as they dash against the rocks; let him listen to the roar and\r\nscream of the shingle as it is cast up and torn down the beach; or look\r\nat the flakes of foam as they drive hither and thither before the wind;\r\nor note the play of colours, which answers a gleam of sunshine as it\r\nfalls upon the myriad bubbles. Surely here, if anywhere, he will say\r\nthat chance is supreme, and bend the knee as one who has entered the\r\nvery penetralia of his divinity. But the man of science knows that here,\r\nas everywhere, perfect order is manifested; that there is not a curve\r\nof the waves, not a note in the howling chorus, not a rainbow-glint on\r\na bubble, which is other than a necessary consequence of the ascertained\r\nlaws of nature; and that with a sufficient knowledge of the conditions,\r\ncompetent physico-mathematical skill could account for, and indeed\r\npredict, every one of these \"chance\" events.\r\n\r\nA second very common objection to Mr. Darwin's views was (and is), that\r\nthey abolish Teleology, and eviscerate the argument from design. It\r\nis nearly twenty years since I ventured to offer some remarks on this\r\nsubject, and as my arguments have as yet received no refutation, I hope\r\nI may be excused for reproducing them. I observed, \"that the doctrine\r\nof Evolution is the most formidable opponent of all the commoner and\r\ncoarser forms of Teleology. But perhaps the most remarkable service to\r\nthe Philosophy of Biology rendered by Mr. Darwin is the reconciliation\r\nof Teleology and Morphology, and the explanation of the facts of both,\r\nwhich his views offer. The teleology which supposes that the eye, such\r\nas we see it in man, or one of the higher vertebrata, was made with the\r\nprecise structure it exhibits, for the purpose of enabling the animal\r\nwhich possesses it to see, has undoubtedly received its death-blow.\r\nNevertheless, it is necessary to remember that there is a wider\r\nteleology which is not touched by the doctrine of Evolution, but is\r\nactually based upon the fundamental proposition of Evolution. This\r\nproposition is that the whole world, living and not living, is the\r\nresult of the mutual interaction, according to definite laws, of the\r\nforces (I should now like to substitute the word powers for \"forces.\")\r\npossessed by the molecules of which the primitive nebulosity of the\r\nuniverse was composed. If this be true, it is no less certain that\r\nthe existing world lay potentially in the cosmic vapour, and that a\r\nsufficient intelligence could, from a knowledge of the properties of the\r\nmolecules of that vapour, have predicted, say the state of the fauna of\r\nBritain in 1869, with as much certainty as one can say what will happen\r\nto the vapour of the breath on a cold winter's day...\r\n\r\n...The teleological and the mechanical views of nature are not,\r\nnecessarily, mutually exclusive. On the contrary, the more purely a\r\nmechanist the speculator is, the more firmly does he assume a primordial\r\nmolecular arrangement of which all the phenomena of the universe are the\r\nconsequences, and the more completely is he thereby at the mercy of the\r\nteleologist, who can always defy him to disprove that this primordial\r\nmolecular arrangement was not intended to evolve the phenomena of the\r\nuniverse.\" (The \"Genealogy of Animals\" ('The Academy,' 1869), reprinted\r\nin 'Critiques and Addresses.')\r\n\r\nThe acute champion of Teleology, Paley, saw no difficulty in admitting\r\nthat the \"production of things\" may be the result of trains of\r\nmechanical dispositions fixed beforehand by intelligent appointment and\r\nkept in action by a power at the centre ('Natural Theology,' chapter\r\nxxiii.), that is to say, he proleptically accepted the modern doctrine\r\nof Evolution; and his successors might do well to follow their leader,\r\nor at any rate to attend to his weighty reasonings, before rushing into\r\nan antagonism which has no reasonable foundation.\r\n\r\nHaving got rid of the belief in chance and the disbelief in design,\r\nas in no sense appurtenances of Evolution, the third libel upon that\r\ndoctrine, that it is anti-theistic, might perhaps be left to shift for\r\nitself. But the persistence with which many people refuse to draw the\r\nplainest consequences from the propositions they profess to accept,\r\nrenders it advisable to remark that the doctrine of Evolution is neither\r\nAnti-theistic nor Theistic. It simply has no more to do with Theism\r\nthan the first book of Euclid has. It is quite certain that a normal\r\nfresh-laid egg contains neither cock nor hen; and it is also as certain\r\nas any proposition in physics or morals, that if such an egg is kept\r\nunder proper conditions for three weeks, a cock or hen chicken will be\r\nfound in it. It is also quite certain that if the shell were transparent\r\nwe should be able to watch the formation of the young fowl, day by day,\r\nby a process of evolution, from a microscopic cellular germ to its\r\nfull size and complication of structure. Therefore Evolution, in the\r\nstrictest sense, is actually going on in this and analogous millions and\r\nmillions of instances, wherever living creatures exist. Therefore,\r\nto borrow an argument from Butler, as that which now happens must be\r\nconsistent with the attributes of the Deity, if such a Being exists,\r\nEvolution must be consistent with those attributes. And, if so, the\r\nevolution of the universe, which is neither more nor less explicable\r\nthan that of a chicken, must also be consistent with them. The doctrine\r\nof Evolution, therefore, does not even come into contact with Theism,\r\nconsidered as a philosophical doctrine. That with which it does collide,\r\nand with which it is absolutely inconsistent, is the conception of\r\ncreation, which theological speculators have based upon the history\r\nnarrated in the opening of the book of Genesis.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of talk and not a little lamentation about the\r\nso-called religious difficulties which physical science has created.\r\nIn theological science, as a matter of fact, it has created none. Not\r\na solitary problem presents itself to the philosophical Theist, at the\r\npresent day, which has not existed from the time that philosophers began\r\nto think out the logical grounds and the logical consequences of Theism.\r\nAll the real or imaginary perplexities which flow from the conception\r\nof the universe as a determinate mechanism, are equally involved in\r\nthe assumption of an Eternal, Omnipotent and Omniscient Deity. The\r\ntheological equivalent of the scientific conception of order is\r\nProvidence; and the doctrine of determinism follows as surely from\r\nthe attributes of foreknowledge assumed by the theologian, as from the\r\nuniversality of natural causation assumed by the man of science. The\r\nangels in 'Paradise Lost' would have found the task of enlightening Adam\r\nupon the mysteries of \"Fate, Foreknowledge, and Free-will,\" not a whit\r\nmore difficult, if their pupil had been educated in a \"Real-schule\" and\r\ntrained in every laboratory of a modern university. In respect of the\r\ngreat problems of Philosophy, the post-Darwinian generation is, in one\r\nsense, exactly where the prae-Darwinian generations were. They remain\r\ninsoluble. But the present generation has the advantage of being better\r\nprovided with the means of freeing itself from the tyranny of certain\r\nsham solutions.\r\n\r\nThe known is finite, the unknown infinite; intellectually we stand on\r\nan islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean of inexplicability. Our\r\nbusiness in every generation is to reclaim a little more land, to add\r\nsomething to the extent and the solidity of our possessions. And even a\r\ncursory glance at the history of the biological sciences during the last\r\nquarter of a century is sufficient to justify the assertion, that\r\nthe most potent instrument for the extension of the realm of natural\r\nknowledge which has come into men's hands, since the publication of\r\nNewton's 'Principia,' is Darwin's 'Origin of Species.'\r\n\r\nIt was badly received by the generation to which it was first addressed,\r\nand the outpouring of angry nonsense to which it gave rise is sad to\r\nthink upon. But the present generation will probably behave just as\r\nbadly if another Darwin should arise, and inflict upon them that which\r\nthe generality of mankind most hate--the necessity of revising their\r\nconvictions. Let them, then, be charitable to us ancients; and if they\r\nbehave no better than the men of my day to some new benefactor, let them\r\nrecollect that, after all, our wrath did not come to much, and vented\r\nitself chiefly in the bad language of sanctimonious scolds. Let them\r\nas speedily perform a strategic right-about-face, and follow the truth\r\nwherever it leads. The opponents of the new truth will discover, as\r\nthose of Darwin are doing, that, after all, theories do not alter facts,\r\nand that the universe remains unaffected even though texts crumble. Or,\r\nit may be, that, as history repeats itself, their happy ingenuity will\r\nalso discover that the new wine is exactly of the same vintage as\r\nthe old, and that (rightly viewed) the old bottles prove to have been\r\nexpressly made for holding it.",
