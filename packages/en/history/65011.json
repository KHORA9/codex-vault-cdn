Americans\r\neverywhere remember the Marine Corps’ combat readiness, courage, and\r\nmilitary skills that were largely responsible for the success of these\r\nearly operations in 1950–1951. Not as dramatic or well-known are the\r\nimportant accomplishments of the Marines during the latter part of the\r\nKorean War.\r\n\r\nIn March 1952 the 1st Marine Division redeployed from the East-Central\r\nfront to West Korea. This new sector, nearly 35 miles in length,\r\nanchored the far western end of I Corps and was one of the most\r\ncritical of the entire Eighth Army line. Here the Marines blocked\r\nthe enemy’s goal of penetrating to Seoul, the South Korean capital.\r\nNorthwest of the Marine Main Line of Resistance, less than five miles\r\ndistant, lay Panmunjom, site of the sporadic truce negotiations.\r\n\r\nDefense of their strategic area exposed the Marines to continuous and\r\ndeadly Communist probes and limited objective attacks. These bitter and\r\ncostly contests for key outposts bore such names as Bunker Hill, the\r\nHook, the Nevadas (Carson-Reno-Vegas), and Boulder City. For the ground\r\nMarines, supported by 1st Marine Aircraft Wing squadrons, the fighting\r\ncontinued until the last day of the war, 27 July 1953.\r\n\r\nThe Korean War marked the first real test of Free World solidarity in\r\nthe face of Communist force. In repulsing this attempted Communist\r\naggression, the United Nations, led by the United States, served notice\r\nthat it would not hesitate to aid those nations whose freedom and\r\nindependence were under attack.\r\n\r\nAs events have subsequently proven, holding the line against Communist\r\nencroachment is a battle whose end is not yet in sight. Enemy\r\naggression may explode brazenly upon the world scene, with an overt\r\nact of invasion, as it did in Korea in June 1950, or it may take the\r\nform of a murderous guerrilla war as it has more recently, for over a\r\ndecade, in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nWhatever guise the enemy of the United States chooses or wherever he\r\ndraws his battleline, he will find the Marines with their age-old\r\nanswer. Today, as in the Korean era, Marine Corps readiness and\r\nprofessionalism are prepared to apply the cutting edge against any\r\nthreat to American security.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (signature)]\r\n\r\n                                    L. F. CHAPMAN, JR.\r\n                               _General, U.S. Marine Corps,_\r\n                             _Commandant of the Marine Corps_\r\n\r\nReviewed and approved: 12 May 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the concluding volume of a five-part series dealing with\r\noperations of United States Marines in Korea between 2 August 1950 and\r\n27 July 1953. Volume V provides a definitive account of operations\r\nof the 1st Marine Division and the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing during\r\n1952–1953, the final phase of the Korean War. At this time the division\r\noperated under Eighth U.S. Army in Korea (EUSAK) control in the\r\nfar western sector of I Corps, while Marine aviators and squadrons\r\nfunctioned as a component of the Fifth Air Force (FAF).\r\n\r\nThe period covered by this history begins in March 1952, when the\r\nMarine division moved west to occupy positions defending the approaches\r\nto Seoul, the South Korean capital. As it had for most of the war the\r\n1st Marine Aircraft Wing, operating under FAF, flew close support\r\nmissions not only for the Marines but for as many as 19 other Allied\r\nfrontline divisions. Included in the narrative is a detailed account of\r\nMarine POWs, a discussion of the new defense mission of Marine units\r\nin the immediate postwar period, and an evaluation of Marine Corps\r\ncontributions to the Korean War.\r\n\r\nMarines, both ground and aviation, comprised an integral part of the\r\nUnited Nations Command in Korea. Since this is primarily a Marine Corps\r\nhistory, actions of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force are presented\r\nonly in sufficient detail to place Marine operations in their proper\r\nperspective.\r\n\r\nOfficial Marine Corps combat records form the basis for the book. This\r\nprimary source material has been further supplemented by comments and\r\ninterviews from key participants in the action described. More than\r\n180 persons reviewed the draft chapters. Their technical knowledge\r\nand advice have been invaluable. Although the full details of these\r\ncomments could not be used in the text, this material has been placed\r\nin Marine Corps archives for possible use by future historians.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript of this volume was prepared during the tenure of Colonel\r\nFrank C. Caldwell, Director of Marine Corps History, Historical\r\nDivision, Headquarters Marine Corps. Production was accomplished\r\nunder the direction of Mr. Henry I. Shaw, Jr., Deputy Director and\r\nChief Historian, who also outlined the volume. Preliminary drafts\r\nwere written by the late Lynn Montross, prime author of this series,\r\nand Major Hubard D. Kuokka. Major James M. Yingling researched and\r\nwrote chapters 1–6 and compiled the Command and Staff List. Lieutenant\r\nColonel Pat Meid researched and wrote chapters 7–12, prepared\r\nappendices, processed photographs and maps, and did the final editing\r\nof the book.\r\n\r\nHistorical Division staff members, past or present, who freely lent\r\nsuggestions or provided information include Lieutenant Colonel John J.\r\nCahill, Captain Charles B. Collins, Mr. Ralph W. Donnelly, Mr. Benis\r\nM. Frank, Mr. George W. Garand, Mr. Rowland P. Gill, Captain Robert J.\r\nKane, Major Jack K. Ringler, and Major Lloyd E. Tatem. Warrant Officer\r\nDennis Egan was Administrative Officer during the final stages of\r\npreparation and production of this book.\r\n\r\nThe many exacting administrative duties involved in processing the\r\nvolume from first draft manuscripts through the final printed form,\r\nincluding the formidable task of indexing the book, were handled\r\nexpertly and cheerfully by Miss Kay P. Sue. Mrs. Frances J. Rubright\r\nalso furnished gracious and speedy assistance in obtaining the tomes\r\nof official Marine Corps records. The maps were prepared by Sergeants\r\nKenneth W. White and Ernest L. Wilson. Official Department of Defense\r\nphotographs illustrate the book.\r\n\r\nA major contribution to the history was made by the Office of the\r\nChief of Military History, Department of the Army; the Naval History\r\nDivision, Department of the Navy; and the Office of Air Force History,\r\nDepartment of the Air Force. Military history offices of England,\r\nCanada, and South Korea provided additional details that add to the\r\naccuracy and interest of this concluding volume of the Korean series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (signature)]\r\n\r\n                                         F. C.

There the\r\nMarines took over the EUSAK left flank, guarding the most likely enemy\r\napproaches to the South Korean capital city, Seoul, and improving the\r\nground defense in their sector to comply with the strict requirements\r\nwhich the division commander, Major General John T. Selden, had set\r\ndown. Except for a brief period in reserve, the Marine division would\r\nremain in the Korean front lines until a cease-fire agreement in July\r\n1953 ended active hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe division CG, Major General Selden,[2] had assumed command of the\r\n25,000-man 1st Marine Division two months earlier, on 11 January, from\r\nMajor General Gerald C. Thomas while the Marines were still in the\r\neastern X Corps sector. The new Marine commander was a 37-year veteran\r\nof Marine Corps service, having enlisted as a private in 1915, serving\r\nshortly thereafter in Haiti. During World War I he was commissioned a\r\nsecond lieutenant, in 1918, while on convoy duty. Between the two world\r\nwars, his overseas service had included a second assignment to Haiti,\r\ntwo China tours, and sea duty. When the United States entered World\r\nWar II, Lieutenant Colonel Selden was an intelligence officer aboard\r\nthe carrier _Lexington_. Later in the war Colonel Selden led the 5th\r\nMarines in the New Britain fighting and was Chief of Staff of the 1st\r\nMarine Division in the Peleliu campaign. He was promoted to brigadier\r\ngeneral in 1948 and received his second star in 1951, prior to his\r\ncombat assignment in Korea.\r\n\r\n      [2] DivInfo, HQMC, Biography of MajGen John T. Selden, Mar 54.\r\n\r\nAmerican concern in the 1950s for South Korea’s struggle to preserve\r\nits independence stemmed from a World War II agreement between the\r\nUnited States, the United Kingdom, and China. In December 1943, the\r\nthree powers had signed the Cairo Declaration and bound themselves to\r\nensure the freedom of the Korean people, then under the yoke of the\r\nJapanese Empire. At the Potsdam Conference, held on the outskirts of\r\nBerlin, Germany in July 1945, the United States, China,[3] and Britain\r\nrenewed their Cairo promise.\r\n\r\n      [3] China did not attend. Instead, it received an advance\r\n          copy of the proposed text. President Chiang Kai-shek\r\n          signified Chinese approval on 26 July. A few hours\r\n          later, the Potsdam Declaration was made public. _Foreign\r\n          Relations of the United States: The Conferences at Cairo\r\n          and Teheran, 1943_ (Department of State publication\r\n          7187), pp. 448–449; _The Conference of Berlin (The\r\n          Potsdam Conference)_, 1945, v. II (Department of State\r\n          publication 7163), pp. 1278, 1282–1283, 1474–1476.\r\n\r\nWhen the Soviet Union agreed to join forces against Japan, on 8 August,\r\nthe USSR also became a party to the Cairo Declaration. According to\r\nterms of the Japanese capitulation on 11 August, the Soviets were to\r\naccept surrender of the defeated forces north of the 38th Parallel in\r\nKorea. South of that line, the commander of the American occupation\r\nforces would receive the surrender. The Russians wasted no time and on\r\n12 August had their troops in northern Korea. American combat units,\r\ndeployed throughout the Pacific, did not enter Korea until 8 September.\r\nThen they found the Soviet soldiers so firmly established they even\r\nrefused to permit U.S. occupation officials from the south to cross\r\nover into the Russian sector. A December conference in Moscow led to a\r\nRusso-American commission to work out the postwar problems of Korean\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nMeeting for the first time in March 1946, the commission was\r\nshort-lived. Its failure, due to lack of Russian cooperation, paved\r\nthe way for politico-military factions within the country that set up\r\ntwo separate Koreas. In the north the Communists, under Kim Il Sung,\r\nand in the south the Korean nationalists, led by Dr. Syngman Rhee,\r\norganized independent governments early in 1947. In May of that year,\r\na second joint commission failed to unify the country. As a result\r\nthe Korean problem was presented to the United Nations (UN). This\r\npostwar international agency was no more successful in resolving the\r\ndifferences between the disputing factions. It did, however, recognize\r\nthe Rhee government in December 1948 as the representative one of the\r\ntwo dissident groups.\r\n\r\nIn June 1950, the North Koreans attempted to force unification of\r\nKorea under Communist control by crossing the 38th Parallel with seven\r\ninfantry divisions heavily supported by artillery and tanks. Acting\r\non a resolution presented by the United States, the United Nations\r\nresponded by declaring the North Korean action a “breach of the peace”\r\nand called upon its members to assist the South Koreans in ousting the\r\ninvaders. Many free countries around the globe offered their aid. In\r\nthe United States, President Harry S. Truman authorized the use of U.S.\r\nair and naval units and, shortly thereafter, ground forces to evict the\r\naggressors and restore the status quo. Under the command of General of\r\nthe Army Douglas MacArthur, then Far East Commander, U.S. Eighth Army\r\noccupation troops in Japan embarked to South Korea.\r\n\r\nThe first combat unit sent from America to Korea was a Marine\r\nair-ground team, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, formed at Camp\r\nPendleton, California on 7 July 1950, under Brigadier General Edward\r\nA. Craig. The same day the UN Security Council passed a resolution\r\ncreating the United Nations Command (UNC) which was to exercise\r\noperational control over the international military forces rallying\r\nto the defense of South Korea. The Council asked the United States to\r\nappoint a commander of the UN forces; on the 8th, President Truman\r\nnamed his Far East Commander, General MacArthur, as Commander in Chief,\r\nUnited Nations Command (CinCUNC).\r\n\r\nIn Korea the Marines soon became known as the firemen of the Pusan\r\nPerimeter, for they were shifted from one trouble spot to the next\r\nall along the defensive ring around Pusan, the last United Nations\r\nstronghold in southeastern Korea during the early days of the fighting.\r\nA bold tactical stroke planned for mid-September was designed to\r\nrelieve enemy pressure on Pusan and weaken the strength of the North\r\nKorean People’s Army (NKPA). As envisioned by General MacArthur, an\r\namphibious landing at Inchon on the west coast, far to the enemy rear,\r\nwould threaten the entire North Korean position south of the 38th\r\nParallel. To help effect this coup, the UN Commander directed that the\r\nMarine brigade be pulled out of the Pusan area to take part in the\r\nlanding at Inchon.\r\n\r\nMacArthur’s assault force consisted of the 1st Marine Division, less\r\none of its three regiments,[4] but including the 1st Korean Marine\r\nCorps (KMC) Regiment. Marine ground and aviation units were to assist\r\nin retaking Seoul, the South Korean capital, and to cut the supply line\r\nsustaining the NKPA divisions.\r\n\r\n      [4] The 7th Marines was on its way to Korea at the time of\r\n          the Inchon landing. The brigade, however, joined the 1st\r\n          Division at sea en route to the objective to provide\r\n          elements of the 5th Regimental Combat Team (RCT).\r\n\r\nOn 15 September, Marines stormed ashore on three Inchon beaches.\r\nDespite difficulties inherent in effecting a landing there,[5] it\r\nwas an outstandingly successful amphibious assault. The 1st and 5th\r\nMarines, with 1st Marine Aircraft Wing (1st MAW) assault squadrons\r\nproviding close air support, quickly captured the port city of Inchon,\r\nAscom City[6] to the east, and Kimpo Airfield. Advancing eastward the\r\nMarines approached the Han River that separates Kimpo Peninsula from\r\nthe Korean mainland. Crossing this obstacle in amphibian vehicles,\r\n1st Division Marines converged on Seoul from three directions. By\r\n27 September, the Marines had captured the South Korean government\r\ncomplex and, together with the U.S. Army 7th Infantry Division, had\r\nsevered the enemy’s main supply route (MSR) to Pusan. In heavy, close\r\nfighting near the city, other United Nations troops pursued and cut off\r\nmajor units of the NKPA.\r\n\r\n      [5] For a discussion of the hardships facing the\r\n          landing force, see Montross and Canzona, _USMC Ops\r\n          Korea--Inchon_, v. II, _op. cit._, pp. 41–42, 59–60,\r\n          62–64.\r\n\r\n      [6] In World War II, the Japanese developed a logistical base\r\n          east of Inchon. When the Japanese surrendered, the Army\r\n          Service Command temporarily took over the installation,\r\n          naming it Ascom City. Maj Robert K. Sawyer, _Military\r\n          Advisers in Korea: KMAG in Peace and War_ (Washington:\r\n          OCMH, DA, 1962), p. 43_n_.\r\n\r\nOrdered back to East Korea, the Marine division re-embarked at Inchon\r\nin October and made an administrative landing at Wonsan on the\r\nNorth Korean coast 75 miles above the 38th Parallel. As part of the\r\nU.S. X Corps, the 1st Marine Division was to move the 5th and 7th\r\nMarines (Reinforced) to the vicinity of the Chosin Reservoir, from\r\nwhere they were to continue the advance northward toward the North\r\nKorean-Manchurian border. The 1st Marines and support troops were to\r\nremain in the Wonsan area.\r\n\r\nWhile the bulk of the division moved northward, an unforeseen\r\ndevelopment was in the making that was to change materially the\r\nmilitary situation in Korea overnight. Aware that the North Koreans\r\nwere on the brink of military disaster, Communist China had decided\r\nto enter the fighting. Nine Chinese divisions had been dispatched\r\ninto the area with the specific mission of destroying the 1st Marine\r\nDivision.[7] Without prior warning, on the night of 27 November, hordes\r\nof Chinese Communist Forces (CCF, or “Chinese People’s Volunteers” as\r\nthey called themselves) assaulted the unsuspecting Marines and nearly\r\nsucceeding in trapping the two Marine regiments. The enemy’s failure\r\nto do so was due to the military discipline and courage displayed by\r\nable-bodied and wounded Marines alike, as well as effective support\r\nfurnished by Marine aviation. Under conditions of great hardship, the\r\ndivision fought its way out over 78 miles of frozen ground from Chosin\r\nto the port of Hungnam, where transports stood by to evacuate the weary\r\nmen and the equipment they had salvaged.\r\n\r\n      [7] Montross and Canzona, _USMC Ops Korea--Chosin_, v. III,\r\n          p. 161.\r\n\r\nThis Chinese offensive had wrested victory from the grasp of General\r\nMacArthur just as the successful completion of the campaign seemed\r\nassured. In the west, the bulk of the Eighth Army paced its withdrawal\r\nwith that of the X Corps. The UNC established a major line of defense\r\nacross the country generally following the 38th Parallel. On Christmas\r\nDay, massed Chinese forces crossed the parallel, and within a week the\r\nUN positions were bearing the full brunt of the enemy assault. Driving\r\nsouthward, the Communists recaptured Seoul, but by mid-February 1951\r\nthe advance had been slowed down, the result of determined Eighth Army\r\nstands from a series of successive defensive lines.[8]\r\n\r\n      [8] On 9 January 1951, General MacArthur was “directed to\r\n          defend himself in successive positions, inflicting\r\n          maximum damage to hostile forces in Korea subject to the\r\n          primary consideration of the safety of his troops and his\r\n          basic mission of protecting Japan.” Carl Berger, _The\r\n          Korea Knot--A Military-Political History_ (Philadelphia:\r\n          University of Pennsylvania Press, 1957), pp. 131–132,\r\n          hereafter Berger, _Korea Knot_, quoted with permission of\r\n          the publisher.\r\n\r\nFollowing its evacuation from Hungnam, the 1st Marine Division early\r\nin 1951 underwent a brief period of rehabilitation and training in\r\nthe vicinity of Masan, west of Pusan. From there, the division moved\r\nnortheast to an area beyond Pohang on the east coast. Under operational\r\ncontrol of Eighth Army, the Marines, with the 1st Korean Marine Corps\r\nRegiment attached for most of the period, protected 75 miles of a\r\nvital supply route from attack by bands of guerrillas. In addition,\r\nthe Marines conducted patrols to locate, trap, and destroy the enemy.\r\nThe Pohang guerrilla hunt also provided valuable training for several\r\nthousand recently arrived Marine division replacements.\r\n\r\nIn mid-February the 1st Marine Division was assigned to the U.S. IX\r\nCorps, then operating in east-central Korea near Wonju. Initially\r\nwithout the KMCs,[9] the Marine division helped push the corps line\r\nacross the 38th Parallel into North Korea. On 22 April, the Chinese\r\nunleashed a gigantic offensive, which again forced UN troops back into\r\nSouth Korea. By the end of the month, however, the Allies had halted\r\nthe 40-mile-wide enemy spring offensive.\r\n\r\n      [9] The 1st KMC Regiment was again attached to the Marine\r\n          Division on 17 March 1951 and remained under its\r\n          operational control for the remainder of the war.\r\n          CinCPacFlt Interim Evaluation Rpt No. 4, Chap 9, p. 9-53,\r\n          hereafter _PacFlt EvalRpt_ with number and chapter.\r\n\r\nOnce again, in May, the Marine division was assigned to the U.S. X\r\nCorps, east of the IX Corps sector. Shortly thereafter the Communists\r\nlaunched another major offensive. Heavy casualties inflicted by UNC\r\nforces slowed this new enemy drive. Marine, Army, and Korean troops\r\nnot only repelled the Chinese onslaught but immediately launched a\r\ncounteroffensive, routing the enemy back into North Korea until the\r\nrough, mountainous terrain and stiffening resistance conspired to slow\r\nthe Allied advance.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these combat difficulties, the Marine division began\r\nto encounter increasing trouble in obtaining what it considered\r\nsufficient and timely close air support (CAS). Most attack and fighter\r\naircraft of the 1st MAW, commanded by Major General Field Harris[10]\r\nand operating since the Chosin Reservoir days under Fifth Air Force\r\n(FAF), had been employed primarily in a program of interdicting North\r\nKorean supply routes. Due to this diversion of Marine air from its\r\nprimary CAS mission, both the division and wing suffered--the latter\r\nby its pilots’ limited experience in performing precision CAS sorties.\r\nDespite the difficulties, the Marine division drove northward reaching,\r\nby 20 June, a grotesque scooped-out terrain feature on the east-central\r\nfront appropriately dubbed the Punchbowl.\r\n\r\n     [10] Command responsibility of 1st MAW changed on 29 May\r\n          51 when Brigadier General Thomas J. Cushman succeeded\r\n          General Harris.\r\n\r\nEighth Army advances into North Korea had caused the enemy to\r\nreappraise his military situation. On 23 June, the Russian delegate to\r\nthe United Nations, Jacob Malik, hinted that the Korean differences\r\nmight be settled at the conference table. Subsequently, United Nations\r\nCommand and Communist leaders agreed that truce negotiations would\r\nbegin on 7 July at Kaesong, located in West Korea immediately south of\r\nthe 38th Parallel, but under Communist control. The Communists broke\r\noff the talks on 22 August. Without offering any credible evidence,\r\nthey declared that UNC aircraft had violated the neutrality zone\r\nsurrounding the conference area.[11] Military and political observers\r\nthen realized that the enemy’s overture to peace negotiations had\r\nserved its intended purpose of permitting him to slow his retreat,\r\nregroup his forces, and prepare his ground defenses for a new\r\ndetermined stand.\r\n\r\n     [11] The Senior Delegate and Chief of the United Nations\r\n          Command Delegation to the Korean Armistice Commission,\r\n          Vice Admiral C. Turner Joy, USN, has described how the\r\n          Communists in Korea concocted incidents “calculated to\r\n          provide advantage for their negotiating efforts or for\r\n          their basic propaganda objectives, or for both.” Examples\r\n          of such duplicity are given in Chapter IV of his book,\r\n          _How Communists Negotiate_ (New York: The MacMillan\r\n          Company, 1955), hereafter Joy, _Truce Negotiations_,\r\n          quoted with permission of the publisher. The quote above\r\n          appears on p. 30.\r\n\r\nThe lull in military offensive activity during the mid-1951 truce talks\r\npresaged the kind of warfare that would soon typify the final phase\r\nof the Korean conflict. Before the fighting settled into positional\r\ntrench warfare reminiscent of World War I, the Marines participated\r\nin the final UN offensive. In a bitter struggle, the division hacked\r\nits way northward through, over, and around the Punchbowl, and in\r\nSeptember 1951 occupied a series of commanding terrain positions that\r\nbecame part of the MINNESOTA Line, the Eighth Army main defensive line.\r\nBeginning on the 20th of that month, it became the primary mission of\r\nfrontline units to organize, construct, and defend positions they held\r\non MINNESOTA. To show good faith at the peace table, the UNC outlawed\r\nlarge-scale attacks against the enemy. Intent upon not appearing\r\nthe aggressor and determined to keep the door open for future truce\r\nnegotiations, the United Nations Command in late 1951 decreed a new\r\nmilitary policy of limited offensives and an aggressive defense of\r\nits line. This change in Allied strategy, due to politico-military\r\nconsiderations, from a moving battle situation to stabilized warfare\r\nwould affect both the tactics and future of the Korean War.\r\n\r\nEven as Allied major tactical offensive operations and the era\r\nof fire and maneuver in Korea was passing into oblivion, several\r\ninnovations were coming into use. One was the Marine Corps employment\r\nof helicopters. First used for evacuation of casualties from Pusan\r\nin August 1950, the versatile aircraft had also been adopted by the\r\nMarine brigade commander, General Craig, as an airborne jeep. On\r\n13 September 1951, Marines made a significant contribution to the\r\nmilitary profession when they introduced helicopters for large-scale\r\nresupply combat operations. This mission was followed one week later\r\nby the first use of helicopters for a combat zone troop lift. These\r\nrevolutionary air tactics were contemporary with two new Marine Corps\r\ndevelopments in ground equipment--body armor and insulated combat\r\nboots, which underwent extensive combat testing that summer and fall.\r\nThe latter were to be especially welcomed for field use during the\r\n1951–1952 winter.\r\n\r\nAlong the MINNESOTA Line, neither the freezing cold of a Korean winter\r\nnor blazing summer heat altered the daily routine. Ground defense\r\noperations consisted of dispatching patrols and raiding parties,\r\nlaying ambushes, and improving the physical defenses. The enemy seemed\r\nreluctant to engage UN forces, and on one occasion to draw him into\r\nthe open, EUSAK ordered Operation CLAM-UP across the entire UN front,\r\nbeginning 10 February. Under cover of darkness, reserve battalions\r\nmoved forward; then, during daylight, they pulled back, simulating a\r\nwithdrawal of the main defenses. At the same time, frontline troops had\r\nexplicit orders not to fire or even show themselves.[12]\r\n\r\n     [12] Col Franklin B. Nihart comments on draft MS, Sep 66,\r\n          hereafter _Nihart comments_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 1      K. WHITE\r\n\r\nEUSAK DISPOSITIONS\r\n\r\n15 MARCH 1952]\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that the rearward movement of units from the front line\r\nand the subsequent inactivity there would cause the enemy to come out\r\nof his trenches to investigate the apparent large-scale withdrawal of\r\nUNC troops. Then Marine and other EUSAK troops could open fire and\r\ninflict maximum casualties from covered positions. On the fifth day of\r\nthe operation, CLAM-UP was ended. The North Koreans were lured out of\r\ntheir defenses, but not in the numbers expected. CLAM-UP was the last\r\naction in the X Corps sector for the 1st Marine Division, which would\r\nbegin its cross-country relocation the following month. (See Map 1.)\r\n\r\nCode-named Operation MIXMASTER, the transfer of the 1st Marine Division\r\nbegan on 17 March when major infantry units began to move out of their\r\neastern X Corps positions, after their relief on line by the 8th\r\nRepublic of Korea (ROK) Division. Regiments of the Marine division\r\nrelocated in the following order: the 1st KMCs, 1st, 7th, and 5th\r\nMarines. The division’s artillery regiment, the 11th Marines, made\r\nthe shift by battalions at two-day intervals. In the motor march to\r\nWest Korea, Marine units traveled approximately 140 miles over narrow,\r\nmountainous, and frequently mud-clogged primitive roads. Day and night,\r\ndivision transport augmented by a motor transport battalion attached\r\nfrom Fleet Marine Force, Pacific (FMFPac) and one company from the\r\n1st Combat Service Group (CSG) rolled through rain, snow, sleet, and\r\noccasional good weather.\r\n\r\nMarines employed 5,800 truck and DUKW (amphibious truck) loads to move\r\nmost of the division personnel, gear, and supplies. Sixty-three flatbed\r\ntrailers, 83 railroad cars, 14 landing ships, 2 transport aircraft, the\r\nvehicles of 4 Army truck companies, as well as hundreds of smaller jeep\r\ntrailers and jeeps were utilized. The division estimated that these\r\ncarriers moved about 50,000 tons of equipment and vehicles,[13] with\r\nsome of the support units making as many as a dozen round trips. The\r\nMIXMASTER move was made primarily by truck and by ship[14] or rail for\r\nunits with heavy vehicles.\r\n\r\n     [13] Marine commanders and staff officers involved in the\r\n          planning and execution of the division move were alarmed\r\n          at the amount of additional equipment that infantry units\r\n          had acquired during the static battle situation. Many\r\n          had become overburdened with “nice-to-have” items in\r\n          excess of actual T/E (Table of Equipment) allowances. Col\r\n          William P. Pala comments on draft MS, 5 Sep 66, hereafter\r\n          _Pala comments_.\r\n\r\n     [14] Heavy equipment and tracked vehicles were loaded aboard\r\n          LSDs and LSTs which sailed from Sokcho-ri to Inchon.\r\n\r\nImpressive as these figures are, they almost pall in significance\r\ncompared with the meticulous planning and precision logistics required\r\nby the week-long move. It was made, without mishap, over main routes\r\nthat supplied nearly a dozen other divisions on the EUSAK line and\r\nthus had to be executed so as not to interfere with combat support.\r\nAlthough the transfer of the 1st Marine Division from the eastern to\r\nwestern front was the longest transplacement of any EUSAK division,\r\nMIXMASTER was a complicated tactical maneuver that involved realignment\r\nof UNC divisions across the entire Korean front. Some 200,000 men and\r\ntheir combat equipment had to be relocated as part of a master plan to\r\nstrengthen the Allied front and deploy more troops on line.\r\n\r\nUpon its arrival in West Korea, the 1st Marine Division was under\r\norders to relieve the 1st ROK Division and take over a sector at the\r\nextreme left of the Eighth Army line, under I Corps control, where the\r\nweaknesses of Kimpo Peninsula defenses had been of considerable concern\r\nto EUSAK and its commander, General James A. Van Fleet. As division\r\nunits reached their new sector, they moved to locations pre-selected\r\nin accordance with their assigned mission. First Marine unit into\r\nthe I Corps main defensive position, the JAMESTOWN Line, was the 1st\r\nKMC Regiment attached to the division, with its organic artillery\r\nbattalion. The KMCs, as well as 1/11, began to move into their new\r\npositions on 18 March. At 1400 on 20 March, the Korean Marines\r\ncompleted the relief of the 15th Republic of Korea Regiment in the left\r\nsector of the MLR (main line of resistance). Next into the division\r\nline, occupying the right regimental sector adjacent to the 1st\r\nCommonwealth Division, was Colonel Sidney S. Wade’s 1st Marines with\r\nthree battalions forward and 2/5 attached as the regimental reserve.\r\nRelief of the 1st ROK Division was completed on the night of 24–25\r\nMarch. At 0400 on 25 March the Commanding General, 1st Marine Division\r\nassumed responsibility for the defense of 32 miles of the JAMESTOWN\r\nLine. That same date the remainder of the Marine artillery battalions\r\nalso relocated in their new positions.\r\n\r\nAs the division took over its new I Corps mission on 25 March, the\r\nMarine commander had one regiment of the 1st ROK Division attached\r\nas division reserve while his 5th Marines was still in the east.\r\nOperational plans originally had called for the 5th Marines, less\r\na battalion, to locate in the Kimpo Peninsula area where it was\r\nanticipated Marine reserve units would be able to conduct extensive\r\namphibious training. So overextended was the assigned battlefront\r\nposition that General Selden realized this regiment would also be\r\nneeded to man the line. He quickly alerted the 5th Marines commanding\r\nofficer, Colonel Thomas A. Culhane, Jr., to deploy his regiment, then\r\nen route to western Korea, to take over a section of the JAMESTOWN\r\nfront line instead of assuming reserve positions at Kimpo as originally\r\nassigned. General Selden believed that putting another regiment on the\r\nmain line was essential to carrying out the division’s mission, to\r\naggressively _defend_ JAMESTOWN Line, not merely to _delay_ a Communist\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nOnly a few hours after the 5th Marines had begun its trans-Korea move,\r\nhelicopters picked up Colonel Culhane, his battalion commanders, and\r\nkey regimental staff officers and flew them to the relocated division\r\ncommand post (CP) in the west. Here, on 26 March, the regimental\r\ncommander officially received the change in the 5th Marines mission.\r\nFollowing this briefing, 5th Marines officers reconnoitered the newly\r\nassigned area[15] while awaiting the arrival of their units. When\r\nthe regiment arrived on the 28th, plans had been completed for it\r\nto relieve a part of the thinly-held 1st Marines line. On 29 March,\r\nthe 5th Marines took over the center regimental sector while the 1st\r\nMarines, on the right regimental flank, compressed its ranks for a more\r\nsolid defense.\r\n\r\n     [15] Col Thomas A. Culhane, Jr. ltr to Hd, HistBr, G-3 Div,\r\n          HQMC, dtd 16 Sep 59, hereafter _Culhane ltr_.\r\n\r\nFrontline units, from the west, were the 1st KMCs, the 5th, and\r\n1st Marines. To the rear, the 7th Marines, designated as division\r\nreserve, together with organic and attached units of the division,\r\nhad established an extensive support and supply area. As a temporary\r\nmeasure, a battalion of the division reserve, 2/7, was detached for\r\ndefense of the Kimpo Peninsula pending a reorganization of forces in\r\nthis area. Major logistical facilities were the division airhead,\r\nlocated at K-16 airfield, just southwest of Seoul, and the railhead at\r\nMunsan-ni, 25 miles northwest of the capital city and about five miles\r\nto the rear of the division sector at its nearest point. Forward of\r\nthe 1st Marine Division line, outposts were established to enhance the\r\ndivision’s security. In the rear area the support facilities, secondary\r\ndefense lines, and unit command posts kept pace with development of\r\ndefensive installations on the MLR. Throughout the 1st Marine Division\r\nsector outpost security, field fortifications, and the ground defense\r\nnet were thorough and intended to deny the enemy access to Seoul.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marines’ Home in Western Korea_[16]\r\n\r\n     [16] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdD, Mar 52; CIA, _NIS\r\n          41B_, South Korea, Chap I, Brief, Section 21, Military\r\n          Geographic Regions, Section 24, Topography (Washington:\r\n          1957–1962); Map, Korea, 1:50,000, AMS Series L 751,\r\n          Sheets 6526 I and IV, 6527 I, II, III, and IV, 6528 II\r\n          and III, 6627 III and IV, and 6628 III (prepared by the\r\n          Engineer, HQ, AFFE, and AFFE/8A, 1952–1954).\r\n\r\nIn western Korea, the home of the 1st Marine Division lay in a\r\nparticularly significant area. (See Map 2.) Within the Marine\r\nboundaries ran the route that invaders through the ages had used in\r\ntheir drive south to Seoul. It was the 1st Marine Division’s mission\r\nto block any such future attempts. One of the reasons for moving the\r\nMarines to the west[17] was that the terrain there had to be held at\r\nall costs; land in the east, mountainous and less valuable, could\r\nbetter be sacrificed if a partial withdrawal in Korea became necessary.\r\nAt the end of March 1952, the division main line of resistance\r\nstretched across difficult terrain for more than 30 miles, from Kimpo\r\nto the British Commonwealth sector on the east, a frontage far in\r\nexcess of the textbook concept.\r\n\r\n     [17] The two other reasons were the weakness of the Kimpo\r\n          defenses and abandonment of plans for an amphibious\r\n          strike along the east coast. Montross, Kuokka, and\r\n          Hicks, _USMC Ops Korea_, v. IV, p. 253. Planning for\r\n          a Marine-led assault had been directed by the EUSAK\r\n          commander, General Van Fleet, early in 1952. The Marine\r\n          division CG, General Selden, had given the task to his\r\n          intelligence and operations deputies, Colonel James H.\r\n          Tinsley and Lieutenant Colonel Gordon D. Gayle. On 12\r\n          March General Van Fleet came to the Marine Division CP\r\n          for a briefing on the proposed amphibious assault. At the\r\n          conclusion of the meeting the EUSAK commander revealed\r\n          his concern for a possible enemy attack down the Korean\r\n          west coast and told the Marine commander to prepare, in\r\n          utmost secrecy, to move his division to the west coast.\r\n          Lynn Montross, draft MS.\r\n\r\nAlthough Seoul was not actually within the area of Marine Corps\r\nresponsibility, the capital city was only 33 air miles south of the\r\nright limiting point of the division MLR and 26 miles southeast of the\r\nleft. The port of Inchon lay but 19 air miles south of the western\r\nend of the division sector. Kaesong, the original site of the truce\r\nnegotiations, was 13 miles northwest of the nearest part of the 1st\r\nMarine Division frontline while Panmunjom was less than 5 miles away\r\nand within the area of Marine forward outpost security. From the far\r\nnortheastern end of the JAMESTOWN Line, which roughly paralleled the\r\nImjin River, distances were correspondingly lengthened: Inchon, thus\r\nbeing 39 miles southwest and Kaesong, about 17 miles west.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 2      K. WHITE\r\n\r\nWESTERN KOREA\r\n\r\nI CORPS SECTOR 1952–1953]\r\n\r\nThe area to which the Marines had moved was situated in the western\r\ncoastal lowlands and highlands area of northwestern South Korea. On the\r\nleft flank, the division MLR hooked around the northwest tip of the\r\nKimpo Peninsula, moved east across the high ground overlooking the Han\r\nRiver, and bent around the northeast cap of the peninsula. At a point\r\nopposite the mouth of the Kongnung River, the MLR traversed the Han to\r\nthe mainland, proceeding north alongside that river to its confluence\r\nwith the Imjin. Crossing north over the Imjin, JAMESTOWN followed the\r\nhigh ground on the east bank of the Sachon River for nearly two miles\r\nto where the river valley widened. There the MLR turned abruptly to\r\nthe northeast and generally pursued that direction to the end of the\r\nMarine sector, meandering frequently, however, to take advantage of key\r\nterrain. Approximately 2½ miles west of the 1st Commonwealth Division\r\nboundary, the JAMESTOWN Line intersected the 38th Parallel near the\r\ntiny village of Madam-ni.\r\n\r\nWithin the Marine division sector to the north of Seoul lay the\r\njunction of two major rivers, the Imjin and the Han, and a portion of\r\nthe broad fertile valley fed by the latter. Flowing into the division\r\narea from the east, the Imjin River snaked its way southwestward to the\r\nrear of JAMESTOWN. At the northeastern tip of the Kimpo Peninsula, the\r\nImjin joined the Han. The latter there changed its course from south to\r\nwest, flowed past Kimpo and neighboring Kanghwa-do Island, and emptied\r\neventually into the Yellow Sea. At the far western end of the division\r\nsector the Yom River formed a natural boundary, separating Kanghwa and\r\nKimpo, as it ran into the Han River and south to the Yellow Sea. To\r\nthe east, the Sachon River streamed into the Imjin, while the Kongnung\r\nemptied into the Han where the MLR crossed from the mainland to Kimpo.\r\n\r\nIn addition, two north-south oriented rivers flanked enemy positions\r\nopposite the Marines and emptied into major rivers in the Marine\r\nsector. Northwest of Kimpo, the Yesong River ran south to the Han; far\r\nto the northeast, just beyond the March 1952 division right boundary,\r\nthe Samichon River flowed into the Imjin.\r\n\r\nAlthough the rivers in the Marine division were navigable, they were\r\nlittle used for supply or transportation. The railroads, too, were\r\nconsidered secondary ways, for there was but one line, which ran north\r\nout of Seoul to Munsan-ni and then continued towards Kaesong. Below the\r\ndivision railhead, located at Munsan-ni, a spur cut off to Ascom City.\r\nRoads, the chief means of surface transport, were numerous but lacked\r\nsufficient width and durability for supporting heavy military traffic.\r\nWithin the sector occupied by the Marines, the main route generally\r\nparalleled the railroad. Most of the existing roads south of JAMESTOWN\r\neventually found their way to the logistic center at Munsan-ni.\r\nImmediately across the Imjin, the road net was more dense but not of\r\nany better construction.\r\n\r\nFrom the logistical point of view, the Imjin River was a critical\r\nfactor. Spanning it and connecting the division forward and rear\r\nsupport areas in March 1952 were only three bridges, which were\r\nvulnerable to river flooding conditions and possible enemy attack.\r\nBesides intersecting the Marine sector, the Imjin formed a barrier to\r\nthe rear of much of the division MLR, thereby increasing the difficulty\r\nof normal defense and resupply operations.\r\n\r\nWhen the Marines moved to the west, the winter was just ending. It had\r\nbegun in November and was characterized by frequent light snowfalls\r\nbut otherwise generally clear skies. Snow and wind storms seldom\r\noccurred in western Korea. From November to March the mean daily\r\nminimum Fahrenheit readings ranged from 15° to 30° above zero. The\r\nmean daily maximums during the summer were between the upper 70s and\r\nmid-80s. Extensive cloud cover, fog, and heavy rains were frequent\r\nduring the summer season. Hot weather periods were also characterized\r\nby occasional severe winds. Spring and fall were moderate transitional\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nSteep-sided hills and mountains, which sloped abruptly into narrow\r\nvalleys pierced by many of the rivers and larger streams, predominated\r\nthe terrain in the I Corps sector where the Marines located. The\r\nmost rugged terrain was to the rear of the JAMESTOWN Line; six miles\r\nnortheast of the Munsan-ni railhead was a 1,948-foot mountain, far\r\nhigher than any other elevation on the Marine or Chinese MLR but lower\r\nthan the rear area peaks supporting the Communist defenses. Ground\r\ncover in the division sector consisted of grass, scrub brush, and,\r\noccasionally, small trees. Rice fields crowded the valley floors.\r\nMud flats were prevalent in many areas immediately adjacent to the\r\nlarger rivers which intersected the division territory or virtually\r\nparalleled the east and western boundaries of the Marine sector.\r\n\r\nThe transfer from the Punchbowl in the east to western Korea thus\r\nresulted in a distinct change of scene for the Marines, who went from\r\na rugged mountainous area to comparatively level terrain. Instead of\r\nfacing a line held by predominantly North Korean forces the division\r\nwas now confronted by the Chinese Communists. The Marines also went\r\nfrom a front that had been characterized by lively patrol action to one\r\nthat in March 1952 was relatively dormant. With the arrival of the 1st\r\nMarine Division, this critical I Corps sector would witness sharply\r\nrenewed activity and become a focal point of action in the UNC line.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Organization of the 1st Marine Division Area_[18]\r\n\r\n     [18] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, Chap. 9; 1stMarDiv,\r\n          1stMar, 5thMar, 7thMar, 11thMar ComdDs, Mar 52; 1st KMC\r\n          RCT Daily Intelligence and Operations Rpts, hereafter KMC\r\n          Regt UnitRpts, Mar 52; Kimpo ProvRegt ComdDs, hereafter\r\n          KPR ComdDs, Mar-Apr 52.\r\n\r\n“To defend” were the key words in the 1st Marine Division mission--“to\r\norganize, occupy, and actively defend its sector of Line JAMESTOWN”--in\r\nWest Korea. General Selden’s force to prevent enemy penetration of\r\nJAMESTOWN numbered 1,364 Marine officers, 24,846 enlisted Marines,\r\n1,100 naval personnel, and 4,400 Koreans of the attached 1st KMC\r\nRegiment. The division also had operational control of several I Corps\r\nreinforcing artillery units in its sector. On 31 March, another major\r\ninfantry unit, the Kimpo Provisional Regiment (KPR) was organized. The\r\ndivision then assumed responsibility for the Kimpo Peninsula defense on\r\nthe west flank with this Marine-Korean force.\r\n\r\nA major reason for transfer of the 1st Marine Division to the west,\r\nit will be remembered, had been the weakness of the Kimpo defense.\r\nSeveral units, the 5th KMC Battalion, the Marine 1st Armored Amphibian\r\nBattalion, and the 13th ROK Security Battalion (less one company), had\r\nbeen charged with the protection of the peninsula. Their operations,\r\nalthough coordinated by I Corps, were conducted independently. The\r\nfixed nature of the Kimpo defenses provided for neither a reserve\r\nmaneuver element to help repel any enemy action that might develop nor\r\na single commander to coordinate the operations of the defending units.\r\n\r\nThese weaknesses become more critical in consideration of the type of\r\nfacilities at Kimpo and their proximity to the South Korean Capital.\r\nSeoul lay just east of the base of Kimpo Peninsula, separated from it\r\nonly by the Han River. Located on Kimpo was the key port of Inchon and\r\ntwo other vital installations, the logistical complex at Ascom City and\r\nthe Kimpo Airfield (K-14). All of these facilities were indispensable\r\nto the United Nations Command.\r\n\r\nTo improve the security of Kimpo and provide a cohesive, integrated\r\ndefense line, CG, 1st Marine Division formed the independent commands\r\ninto the Kimpo Provisional Regiment. Colonel Edward M. Staab, Jr.,\r\nwas named the first KPR commander. His small headquarters functioned\r\nin a tactical capacity only without major administrative duties. The\r\ndetachments that comprised the KPR upon its formation were:\r\n\r\n  Headquarters and Service Company, with regimental and company\r\n    headquarters and a communication platoon;\r\n\r\n  1st Armored Amphibian Battalion, as supporting artillery;\r\n\r\n  5th KMC Battalion;\r\n\r\n  13th ROK Security Battalion (-);\r\n\r\n  One battalion from the reserve regiment of the 1st Marine\r\n    Division (2/7), as the maneuver element;\r\n\r\n  Company A, 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion;\r\n\r\n  Company B, 1st Shore Party Battalion, as engineers;\r\n\r\n  Company D, 1st Medical Battalion;\r\n\r\n  Reconnaissance Company (-), 1st Marine Division;\r\n\r\n  Detachment, Air and Naval Gunfire Liaison Company (ANGLICO), 1st\r\n    Signal Battalion;\r\n\r\n  Detachment, 181st Counterintelligence Corps Unit, USA;\r\n\r\n  Detachment, 61st Engineer Searchlight Company, USA; and the\r\n\r\n  163rd Military Intelligence Service Detachment, USA.\r\n\r\nThe Kimpo Regiment, in addition to maintaining security of the division\r\nleft flank, was assigned the mission to “protect supporting and\r\ncommunication installations in that sector against airborne or ground\r\nattack.”[19] Within the division, both the artillery regiment and\r\nthe motor transport battalion were to be prepared to support tactical\r\noperations of Colonel Staab’s organization.\r\n\r\n     [19] KPR ComdD, Mar 52, p. 13.\r\n\r\nFor defense purposes, the KPR commander divided the peninsula into\r\nthree sectors. The northern one was manned by the KMC battalion,\r\nwhich occupied commanding terrain and organized the area for defense.\r\nThe southern part was defended by the ROK Army battalion, charged\r\nspecifically with protection of the Kimpo Airfield and containment of\r\nany attempted enemy attack from the north. Both forces provided for\r\nthe security of supply and communication installations within their\r\nareas. The western sector, held by the amphibian tractor company, less\r\ntwo platoons, had the mission of screening traffic along the east bank\r\nof the Yom River, that flanked the western part of the peninsula.\r\nProviding flexibility to the defense plan was the maneuver unit, the\r\nbattalion assigned from the 1st Marine Division reserve.\r\n\r\nThe unit adjacent to the KPR[20] in the division line in late March\r\nwas the 1st Korean Marine Corps Regiment, which had been the first\r\ndivision unit to deploy along JAMESTOWN. The KMC Regiment, command by\r\nColonel Kim Dong Ha,[21] had assumed responsibility for its portion of\r\nJAMESTOWN at 0400 on 20 March with orders to organize and defend its\r\nsector. The regiment placed two battalions, the 3d and 1st, on the MLR\r\nand the 2d in the rear. Holding down the regimental right of the sector\r\nwas the 1st Battalion, which had shared its eastern boundary with that\r\nof Colonel Wade’s 1st Marines until 29 March when the 5th Marines was\r\nemplaced on the MLR between the 1st KMC and 1st Marines.\r\n\r\n     [20] The following month the 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion\r\n          would be added to the four regiments on line, making a\r\n          total of five major units manning the 1stMarDiv front. It\r\n          was inserted between the Kimpo and 1st KMC regiments.\r\n\r\n     [21] Commandant, Korean Marine Corps ltr to CMC, dtd 20 Sep\r\n          66, hereafter _CKMC ltr_.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Marines regimental right boundary, which on the MLR was 1,100\r\nyards north of the 38th Parallel, separated the 1st Marine Division\r\narea from the western end of the 1st Commonwealth Division, then held\r\nby the 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade. In late March, Colonel Wade’s\r\n2/1 (Lieutenant Colonel Thell H. Fisher) and 3/1 (Lieutenant Colonel\r\nSpencer H. Pratt) manned the frontline positions while 1/1 (Lieutenant\r\nColonel John H. Papurca), less Company A, was in reserve. The regiment\r\nwas committed to the defense of its part of the division area and\r\nimprovement of its ground positions. In the division center sector\r\nColonel Culhane’s 1/5 (Lieutenant Colonel Franklin B. Nihart) and\r\n3/5 (Lieutenant Colonel William S. McLaughlin) manned the left and\r\nright battalion MLR positions, with 2/5 (Lieutenant Colonel William\r\nH. Cushing) in reserve. The latter unit was to be prepared either to\r\nrelieve the MLR battalions or for use as a counterattack force.\r\n\r\nIt did not take the Marines long to discover the existence of serious\r\nflaws in the area defense which made it questionable whether the Allied\r\nline here could have successfully withstood an enemy attack. While\r\nhis Marine units were effecting their relief of JAMESTOWN, Colonel\r\nWade noted that “field fortifications were practically nonexistent in\r\nsome sections.”[22] General Selden later pointed out that “populated\r\nvillages existed between opposing lines. Farmers were cultivating\r\ntheir fields in full view of both forces. Traffic across the river was\r\nbrisk.”[23] A member of the division staff reported that there was\r\n“even a school operating in one area ahead of the Marine lines.”[24]\r\nIn addition to these indications of sector weakness, there was still\r\nanother. Although the ROK division had placed three regiments in the\r\nline, when the two Marine regiments relieved them there were then more\r\nmen on JAMESTOWN due to the greater personnel strength of a Marine\r\nregiment. Nevertheless, the division commander was still appalled at\r\nthe width of the defense sector assigned to so few Marines.\r\n\r\n     [22] 1stMar ComdD, Mar 52, p. 2.\r\n\r\n     [23] 1stMarDiv ComdD, Jun 52, App IX, p. 1.\r\n\r\n     [24] LtCol Harry W. Edwards comments on preliminary draft MS,\r\n          _ca._ Sep 59.\r\n\r\nAt division level, the reserve mission was filled by Colonel Russell\r\nE. Honsowetz’, 7th Marines, minus 2/7 (Lieutenant Colonel Noel C.\r\nGregory), which on 30 March became the maneuver force for the Kimpo\r\nRegiment. As the division reserve, the regiment was to be prepared\r\nto assume at any time either a defensive or offensive mission of any\r\nof the frontline regiments. In addition, the reserve regiment was\r\nto draw up counterattack plans, protect the division rear, improve\r\nsecondary line defenses, and conduct training, including tank-infantry\r\ncoordination, for units in reserve. The 7th Marines, with 3/7\r\n(Lieutenant Colonel Houston Stiff) on the left and 1/7 (Lieutenant\r\nColonel George W. E. Daughtry) on the right, was emplaced in the\r\nvicinity of the secondary defense lines, WYOMING and KANSAS, to the\r\nrear of the 5th and 1st Marines.\r\n\r\nAnother regiment located in the rear area was the 11th Marines. Its\r\nartillery battalions had begun displacement on 17 March and completed\r\ntheir move by 25 March. Early on the 26th, the 11th Marines resumed\r\nsupport of the 1st Marine Division. While the Marine artillery had been\r\nen route, U.S. Army artillery from I Corps supported the division. With\r\nthe arrival on the 29th of the administrative rear echelon, the Marine\r\nartillery regiment was fully positioned in the west.\r\n\r\nFor Colonel Frederick P. Henderson, who became the division artillery\r\ncommander on 27 March, operational problems in western Korea differed\r\nsomewhat from those experienced in the east by his predecessor,\r\nColonel Bruce T. Hemphill. The most critical difficulty, however, was\r\nthe same situation that confronted General Selden--the vast amount\r\nof ground to be covered and defended, and the insufficient number of\r\nunits to accomplish this mission. To the artillery, the wide division\r\nfront resulted in spreading the available fire support dangerously\r\nthin. Placement of 11th Marines units to best support the MLR\r\nregiments created wide gaps between each artillery battalion, caused\r\ncommunication and resupply difficulties, prevented a maximum massing of\r\nfires, and made redeployment difficult.[25]\r\n\r\n     [25] Col Frederick P. Henderson ltr to Hd, HistBr, G-3 Div,\r\n          HQMC, dtd 25 Aug 59, hereafter _Henderson ltr I_.\r\n\r\nIn making use of all available fire support, the artillery regiment\r\nhad to guard not only against the duplication of effort in planning\r\nor delivery of fires, but also against firing in the Panmunjom peace\r\ncorridor restricted areas, located near the sector held by the Marine\r\ndivision’s center regiment. Moreover, the artillerymen had to maintain\r\na flexibility sufficient to place the weight of available fire support\r\non call into any zone of action.\r\n\r\nOther difficulties were more directly associated with the nature of\r\nthe sector rather than with its broad expanse. The positioning of the\r\ndivision in the west, although close to the coast, put the Marines\r\nbeyond the range of protective naval gunfire. The sparse and inadequate\r\nroad net further aggravated the tactical and logistical problems caused\r\nby wide separation of units. Finally, the cannoneers had exceptionally\r\nheavy demands placed on them due to the restricted amount of close air\r\nsupport allocated to frontline troops under operational procedures\r\nemployed by Fifth Air Force. This command had jurisdiction over the\r\nentire Korean air defense system, including Marine squadrons.\r\n\r\nManning the main line of resistance also frequently presented\r\nperplexing situations to the infantry. There had been little time for\r\na thorough reconnaissance and selection of positions by any of the\r\nfrontline regiments. When the 1st Marines moved into its assigned\r\nposition on the MLR, the troops soon discovered many minefields, “some\r\nmarked, some poorly marked, and some not marked at all.”[26] Uncharted\r\nmines caused the regiment to suffer “some casualties the first night\r\nof our move and more the second and third days.”[27] As it was to turn\r\nout, during the first weeks in the I Corps sector, mines of all types\r\ncaused 50 percent of total Marine casualties.\r\n\r\n     [26] Col Sidney S. Wade ltr to Deputy AsstCofS, G-3, HQMC, dtd\r\n          25 Aug 59.\r\n\r\n     [27] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nA heavy drain on the limited manpower of Marine infantry regiments\r\ndefending JAMESTOWN was caused by the need to occupy an additional\r\nposition, an outpost line of resistance (OPLR). This defensive line to\r\nthe front of the Marine MLR provided additional security against the\r\nenemy, but decreased the strength of the regimental reserve battalion,\r\nwhich furnished the OPLR troops. The outposts manned by the Marines\r\nconsisted of a series of strongpoints built largely around commanding\r\nterrain features that screened the 1st Marine Division area. The OPLR\r\nacross the division front was, on the average, about 2,500 yards\r\nforward of the MLR. (See Map 3.)\r\n\r\nTo the rear of the main line were two secondary defensive lines,\r\nWYOMING and KANSAS. Both had been established before the Marines\r\narrived and both required considerable work, primarily construction\r\nof bunkers and weapons emplacements, to meet General Selden’s strict\r\nrequirement for a strong defensive sector. Work in improving the lines,\r\nexercises in rapid battalion tactical deployment by helicopter, and\r\nactual manning of the lines were among the many tasks assigned to the\r\ndivision reserve regiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 3      K. White\r\n\r\n1st MARINE DIVISION SECTOR\r\n\r\n30 APRIL 1952]\r\n\r\nRear and frontline units alike found that new regulations affected\r\ncombat operations with the enemy in West Korea. These restrictions were\r\na result of the truce talks that had taken place first at Kaesong and,\r\nlater, at Panmunjom. In line with agreements reached in October 1951:\r\n\r\n  Panmunjom was designated as the center of a circular neutral zone\r\n  of a 1,000 yard radius, and a three mile radius around Munsan and\r\n  Kaesong was also neutralized, as well as two hundred meters on\r\n  either side of the Kaesong-Munsan road.[28]\r\n\r\n     [28] Rees, _Korea_, p. 295.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the occurrence of any hostile act within this sanctuary,\r\nLieutenant General John W. O’Daniel, I Corps commander, ordered\r\nthat an additional area, forward of the OPLR, be set aside. This\r\nmegaphone-shaped zone “could not be fired into, out of, or over.”[29]\r\nIt was adjacent to the OPLR in the division center regimental sector,\r\nnear its left boundary, and took a generally northwest course.\r\nMarines reported that the Communists knew of this restricted zone and\r\nfrequently used it for assembly areas and artillery emplacements.\r\n\r\n     [29] 1stMarDiv ComdD, Mar 52, p. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The 1st Marine Aircraft Wing_[30]\r\n\r\n     [30] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, Chap. 10; 1stMarDiv\r\n          ComdD, Mar 52; 1st MAW ComdDs, Mar-Apr 52.\r\n\r\nWhen the 1st Marine Division moved to western Korea in March 1952, the\r\ntwo 1st Marine Aircraft Wing units that had been in direct support\r\nof the ground Marines also relocated. Marine Observation Squadron\r\n6 (VMO-6) and Marine Helicopter Transport Squadron 161 (HMR-161)\r\ncompleted their displacements by 24 March from their eastern airfield\r\n(X-83) to sites in the vicinity of the new division CP. HMR-161, headed\r\nby Colonel Keith B. McCutcheon, set up headquarters at A-17,[31] on a\r\nhillside 3½ miles southeast of Munsan-ni, the division railhead, “using\r\na couple of rice paddies as our L. Z. (Landing Zone).”[32] The squadron\r\nrear echelon, including the machine shops, was maintained at A-33, near\r\nAscom City. About 2½ miles south of the helicopter forward site was an\r\nold landing strip, A-9, which Lieutenant Colonel William T. Herring’s\r\nobservation squadron used as home field for its fixed and rotary wing\r\naircraft. (For location of 1st MAW units see Map 4.) In West Korea,\r\nVMO-6 and HMR-161 continued to provide air transport for tactical and\r\nlogistical missions. Both squadrons were under operational control of\r\nthe division, but administered by the wing.\r\n\r\n     [31] In Korea, fields near U.S. Army installations were known\r\n          as “A”; major airfields carried a “K” designation; and\r\n          auxiliary strips were the “X” category.\r\n\r\n     [32] MajGen Keith B.

Entering the\r\nMarine Corps in June 1917, he had served as an enlisted man with the\r\n1st Marine Aeronautical Company in the Azores during World War I.\r\nCommissioned in 1919, he served in a variety of training and overseas\r\nnaval air assignments. As a first lieutenant in Nicaragua, he had\r\nbeen awarded the Medal of Honor in 1928 for his bravery and “almost\r\nsuperhuman skill” in flying out Marines wounded at Quilali.[34] During\r\nWorld War II, General Schilt had served as 1st MAW Assistant Chief of\r\nStaff, at Guadalcanal, was later CO of Marine Aircraft Group 11, and\r\nparticipated in the consolidation of the Southern Solomons and air\r\ndefense of Peleliu and Okinawa.\r\n\r\n     [33] DivInfo, HQMC, Biography of General Christian F.

WILSON\r\n\r\n1ST MARINE AIRCRAFT WING DISPOSITIONS\r\n\r\n30 APRIL 1952]\r\n\r\nAs in past months, the majority of General Schilt’s Marine aircraft\r\nin Korea during March 1952 continued to be under operational control\r\nof Fifth Air Force. In turn, FAF was the largest subordinate command\r\nof Far East Air Forces (FEAF), headquartered at Tokyo. The latter was\r\nthe U.S. Air Force component of the Far East Command and encompassed\r\nall USAF installations in the Far East. The FAF-EUSAK Joint Operations\r\nCenter (JOC) at Seoul coordinated and controlled all Allied air\r\noperations in Korea. Marine fighter and attack squadrons were employed\r\nby FAF to:\r\n\r\n  Maintain air superiority.\r\n\r\n  Furnish close support for ground units.\r\n\r\n  Provide escort [for attack aircraft].\r\n\r\n  Conduct day and night reconnaissance and fulfill requests.\r\n\r\n  Effect the complete interdiction of North Korean and Chinese\r\n  Communist forces and other military targets that have an\r\n  immediate effect upon the current tactical situation.[35]\r\n\r\n     [35] 1st MAW ComdD, Mar 52, p. 2.\r\n\r\nSquadrons carrying out these assignments were attached to Marine\r\nAircraft Groups (MAGs) 12 and 33. Commanded by Colonel Luther S.\r\nMoore, MAG-12 and its two day attack squadrons (VMF-212 and VMF-323)\r\nin March 1952 was still located in eastern Korea (K-18, Kangnung).\r\nThe Marine night-fighters of VMF(N)-513 were also here as part of\r\nthe MAG-12 group. Farther removed from the immediate battlefront was\r\nColonel Martin A. Severson’s MAG-33, located at K-3 (Pohang), with its\r\ntwo powerful jet fighter squadrons (VMFs-115 and -311) and an attack\r\nsquadron (VMA-121). A new MAG-33 unit was Marine Photographic Squadron\r\n1 (VMJ-1), just formed in February 1952 and commanded by Major Robert\r\nR. Read.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its land-based squadrons, one 1st MAW unit was assigned\r\nto Commander, West Coast Blockading and Patrol Group, designated\r\nCommander, Task Group 95.1 (CTG 95.1). He in turn assigned this\r\nMarine unit to Commander, Task Element 95.11 (CTE 95.11), whose ships\r\ncomprised the West Coast Carrier Element. Marine Attack Squadron\r\n312 (VMA-312) was at this time assigned to CTE 95.11. In late March\r\nsquadron aircraft were based on the escort carrier USS _Bairoko_ but\r\ntransferred on 21 April to the light carrier _Bataan_.[36] Operating\r\nnormally with a complement of 21 F4U-4 propeller-driven Corsair\r\naircraft, VMA-312 had the following missions:\r\n\r\n  To conduct armed air reconnaissance of the West Coast of Korea\r\n  from the United Nations front lines northward to latitude 39°/15´\r\n  N.\r\n\r\n  Attack enemy shipping and destroy mines.\r\n\r\n  Maintain surveillance of enemy airfields in the Haeju-Chinnampo\r\n  region.[37]\r\n\r\n  Provide air spot services to naval units on request.\r\n\r\n  Provide close air support and armed air reconnaissance services\r\n  as requested by Joint Operations Center, Korea (JOC KOREA).\r\n\r\n  Conduct air strikes against coastal and inland targets of\r\n  opportunity at discretion.\r\n\r\n  Be prepared to provide combat air patrol to friendly naval forces\r\n  operating off the West Coast of Korea.\r\n\r\n  Render SAR [search and rescue] assistance.\r\n\r\n     [36] Unit commanders also changed about this time. Lieutenant\r\n          Colonel Robert E. Smith, Jr. assumed command of the\r\n          Checkerboard squadron from Lieutenant Colonel Joe H.\r\n          McGlothlin, on 9 April.\r\n\r\n     [37] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, p. 10-75. The Haeju-Chinnampo\r\n          region, noted in the surveillance mission, is a coastal\r\n          area in southwestern North Korea between the 38th and\r\n          39th Parallels.\r\n\r\nBecause they were under operational control of Fifth Air Force, 1st\r\nMAW flying squadrons, except those assigned to CTG 95.1 and 1st Marine\r\nDivision control, did not change their dispositions in March. Plans\r\nwere under way at this time, however, to relocate one of the aircraft\r\ngroups, MAG-12, to the west.\r\n\r\nOn 30 March the ground element of the night-fighters redeployed from\r\nits east coast home field to K-8 (Kunsan), on the west coast, 105\r\nmiles south of Seoul. Lieutenant Colonel John R. Burnett’s VMF (N)-513\r\ncompleted this relocation by 11 April without loss of a single day of\r\nflight operations. On 20 April the rest of MAG-12,[38] newly commanded\r\nsince the first of the month by Colonel Elmer T. Dorsey, moved to\r\nK-6 (Pyongtaek), located 30 miles directly south of the South Korean\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n     [38] VMFs-212 (LtCol Robert L. Bryson) and -323 (LtCol\r\n          Richard L. Blume) left an east coast field for a flight\r\n          mission over North Korea and landed at K-6 thereafter,\r\n          also completing the move without closing down combat\r\n          operations. The relocation in airfields was designed to\r\n          keep several squadrons of support aircraft close to the\r\n          1st Marine Division. Col E. T. Dorsey ltr to Hd, HistBr,\r\n          G-3 Div, HQMC, dtd 7 Sep 66.\r\n\r\nMarine aircraft support units were also located at K-3 and at Itami\r\nAir Force Base, on Honshu, Japan. Under direct 1st MAW control were\r\nfour ground-type logistical support units with MAG-33, a Provisional\r\nAutomatic Weapons Battery from Marine Air Control Group 2 (MACG-2),\r\nand most of wing headquarters. This last unit, commanded by Colonel\r\nFrederick R. Payne, Jr., included the 1st 90mm AAA Gun Battalion (based\r\nat Pusan and led by Colonel Max C. Chapman), and a detachment of Marine\r\nTransport Squadron 152 (VMR-152), which had seven Douglas four-engine\r\nR5D transports. This element and the wing service squadron were based\r\nat Itami.\r\n\r\nMarines, and others flying in western Korea, found themselves\r\nrestricted much as Marines on the ground were. One limitation resulted\r\nfrom a FAF-EUSAK agreement in November 1951 limiting the number of\r\ndaily close air support sorties across the entire Eighth Army line.\r\nThis policy had restricted air activity along the 155-mile Korean front\r\nto 96 sorties per day. The curtailment seriously interfered with the\r\nMarine type of close air support teamwork evolved during World War II,\r\nand its execution had an adverse effect on Marine ground operations as\r\nwell. A second restriction, also detrimental to Marine division and\r\nwing efficiency, was the prohibitive cushion Fifth Air Force had placed\r\naround the United Nations peace corridor area north of the Marine\r\nMLR. This buffer no-fly, no-fire zone which had been added to prevent\r\nviolation of the UN sanctuary by stray hits did not apply, of course,\r\nto the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Enemy_[39]\r\n\r\n     [39] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, Chaps. 9, 10;\r\n          1stMarDiv ComdD, Mar 52.\r\n\r\nDirectly beyond the 1st Marine Division sector, to the west and north,\r\nwere two first-rate units of the Chinese Communist Forces, the 65th and\r\n63d CCF Armies. Together, they totaled approximately 49,800 troops in\r\nlate March 1952. Opposite the west and center of the Marine division\r\nfront was the 65th CCF Army, with elements of the 193d Division across\r\nfrom the KPR and the 194th Division holding positions opposing the\r\nKMC regiment. Across from the Marine line in the center was the 195th\r\nDivision of the 65th CCF Army, which had placed two regiments forward.\r\nNorth of the division right sector lay the 188th Division, 63d CCF\r\nArmy, also with two regiments forward. The estimated 15 infantry\r\nbattalions facing the Marine division were supported by 10 organic\r\nartillery battalions, numbering 106 guns, and varying in caliber from\r\n75 to 155mm.[40] In addition, intelligence reported that the 1st CCF\r\nArmored Division and an unidentified airborne brigade were located near\r\nenough to aid enemy operations.\r\n\r\n     [40] The Korean Marine Corps placed the artillery count at 240\r\n          weapons ranging from 57 to 122mm. _CKMC ltr._\r\n\r\nChinese infantry units were not only solidly entrenched across their\r\nfront line opposite the Marine division but were also in depth. Their\r\nsuccessive defensive lines, protected by minefields, wire, and other\r\nobstacles, were supported by artillery and had been, as a result\r\nof activities in recent months, supplied sufficiently to conduct\r\ncontinuous operations. Not only were enemy ground units well-supplied,\r\nbut their CCF soldiers were well disciplined and well led. Their morale\r\nwas officially evaluated as ranging from good to excellent. In all,\r\nthe CCF was a determined adversary of considerable ability, with their\r\ngreatest strength being in plentiful combat manpower.\r\n\r\nAir opposition to Marine pilots in Korea was of unknown quantity\r\nand only on occasion did the caliber of enemy pilots approach that\r\nof the Americans. Pilots reported that their Chinese counterparts\r\ngenerally lacked overall combat proficiency, but that at times their\r\n“aggressiveness, sheer weight of numbers, and utter disregard for\r\nlosses have counterbalanced any apparent deficiencies.”[41] The\r\nCommunists had built their offensive potential around the Russian\r\nMIG-15 jet fighter-interceptor. Use of this aircraft for ground support\r\nor ground attack was believed to be in the training stage only. The\r\nChinese had also based their air defense on the same MIG plus various\r\ntypes of ground antiaircraft (AA) weapons, particularly the mobile 37mm\r\nautomatic weapons and machine guns that protected their main supply\r\nroutes. In use of these ground AA weapons, enemy forces north of the\r\n38th Parallel had become most proficient. Their defense system against\r\nUNC planes had been steadily built up and improved since stabilization\r\nof the battle lines in 1951, and by March 1952 was reaching a\r\nformidable state.\r\n\r\n     [41] _PacFlt EvalRpt_, No. 4, p. 10-38.\r\n\r\nAs the more favorable weather for ground combat approached toward the\r\nend of March, the CCF was well prepared to continue and expand its\r\noperations. Enemy soldiers were considered able to defend their sector\r\neasily with infantry and support units. Division intelligence also\r\nreported that Chinese ground troops had the capability for launching\r\nlimited objective attacks to improve their observation of Marine MLR\r\nrear areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Initial CCF Attack_[42]\r\n\r\n     [42] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdDs, Mar-Apr 52; KMC Regt\r\n          UnitRpt 31, dtd 2 Apr 52.\r\n\r\nWhether by intent or default, the Chinese infantry occupying the enemy\r\nforward positions did not interfere with the Marine relief. With\r\nassumption of sector responsibility by the division early on 25 March,\r\nthe initial enemy contact came from Chinese supporting weapons. Later\r\nthat day the two division frontline regiments, the 1st and 5th Marines,\r\nreceived 189 mortar and artillery shells in their sectors which wounded\r\n10 Marines. One man in the 1st Marines was killed by sniper fire on 25\r\nMarch; in the same regiment, another Marine was fatally wounded the\r\nfollowing day. Forward of the lines, the day after the division took\r\nover, there was no ground action by either side.\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of the month, the tempo of activities on both sides\r\nincreased. Marines began regular patrol actions to probe and ambush the\r\nenemy. Division artillery increased its number of observed missions by\r\nthe end of the month. By this time the CCF had also begun to probe\r\nthe lines of the Marine regimental sectors. In these ground actions to\r\nreconnoiter and test division defenses, the Chinese became increasingly\r\nbold, with the most activity on 28 March. Between 25–31 March, the\r\nfirst week on JAMESTOWN, some 100 Chinese engaged in 5 different\r\nprobing actions. Most of these were against the 1st KMC Regiment on the\r\nleft flank of the division MLR.\r\n\r\nIt was no wonder that the Chinese concentrated their effort against\r\nthe Korean Marines, for they held the area containing Freedom Gate,\r\nthe best of the three bridges spanning the Imjin. Both of the other\r\ntwo, X-Ray and Widgeon, were further east in the division sector. If\r\nthe enemy could exploit a weak point in the KMC lines, he could attack\r\nin strength, capture the bridge, and turn the division left flank,\r\nafter which he would have a direct route to Seoul.[43] Without the\r\nbridge in the KMC sector, the division would be hard pressed, even with\r\nhelicopter lift, to maneuver or maintain the regiments north of the\r\nImjin.\r\n\r\n     [43] _Henderson ltr I._\r\n\r\nOn 1 April, at about 2130, the CCF began pounding the frontline\r\ncompanies in the KMC area with an artillery preparation. A half hour\r\nlater, the enemy attacked an outpost and the main line. First to engage\r\nthe Chinese were the OPLR troops of the KMC 1st Company; 1st Battalion,\r\non the regimental right. There, a Chinese company forced an opening\r\nbetween friendly outposts and reached a point about 200 yards short of\r\nthe MLR and just north of a road leading to the main bridge over the\r\nImjin. While this attack was in progress, another CCF company hit the\r\noutpost line further south. This attack, less successful, ended far\r\nshort of the MLR and about a half-mile south of the bridge road. Both\r\nenemy companies withdrew at about 2345.\r\n\r\nTo the left of the 1st Battalion, the 3d was receiving the brunt of\r\nthis initial CCF attack. The 9th, 11th, and 10th Companies (deployed in\r\nthat order from west to east, in the left battalion sector), had been\r\nengaged by the same preliminary 30-minute shelling. At 2200, when four\r\nCCF squads attacked the two companies on the left, an enemy company hit\r\nthe left end of the 10th Company, occupied by the 2d Platoon. About\r\nmidnight the South Koreans, under fire from both flanks and under heavy\r\nfrontal assault, were forced to withdraw. In the rear, the company\r\ncommander pulled the 1st Platoon from the line, ordered the 3d to\r\nextend left to cover both sectors, and led a counterattack with the 1st\r\nPlatoon and elements of the 2d. Positions were quickly restored by the\r\nKMC action.\r\n\r\nSoon after it had hurled the Chinese back across the OPLR, the 1st\r\nBattalion was subjected to a second attack. An enemy unit, estimated\r\nto be a company, engaged a 1st Company platoon briefly. When the KMCs\r\nreturned heavy defensive fires, the Communists pulled back but struck\r\nagain at 0300. After a 20-minute fire fight, the Chinese company\r\nretreated.\r\n\r\nThis action on 1–2 April cost the attackers 2 killed, 34 estimated\r\nkilled, and 10 estimated wounded. For the KMC, casualties were 2\r\nkilled, 10 wounded. To all 1st Division Marines, the successful defense\r\nby the 1st KMC regimental Marines was heartening. It had preserved not\r\nonly the division western flank but also the vital link over the Imjin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Subsequent CCF Attacks_[44]\r\n\r\n     [44] Unless otherwise noted, the material for this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv, 1stMar, 5thMar, KPR ComdDs, Apr\r\n          52; KMC Regt UnitRpt 35, dtd 16 Apr 52.\r\n\r\nFollowing his attempted assault against the KMC regiment, the enemy\r\nopposite the 1st Marine Division reverted to a passive defense. Except\r\nfor a probe late on 2 April of the far eastern line held by Lieutenant\r\nColonel Pratt’s 3/1 and two patrols that scouted MLR positions in the\r\nwestern Korean Marine area that same date, Communist offensive measures\r\nconsisted largely of artillery and mortar fire. Chinese line units\r\nappeared to concentrate on improving their dugouts and trench systems.\r\nMarines reported frequent sightings of enemy groups working in and\r\naround their forward trenches.\r\n\r\nMarine division troops, too, were busy fortifying their defensive\r\npositions. On the Kimpo Peninsula they dug gun emplacements and erected\r\ncamp facilities for the newly activated Kimpo Provisional Regiment.\r\nNorth of the Han, mine clearance and construction of trenchworks and\r\nfortifications was the order of the day for most Marines. Other Marines\r\npatrolled forward of the lines as a major aspect of the division’s\r\ncontinuous active defense. During daylight hours, MLR regiments\r\ndispatched reconnaissance and combat patrols and sent out snipers,\r\narmed with telescope-equipped M-1 rifles. Division tanks firing from\r\ntemporary gun slots on the main line and artillery batteries emplaced\r\nin rear area dugouts hammered away at enemy positions and disposed of\r\nhis patrols. At night, harassing and interdicting (H&I) artillery fires\r\nand infantry raids continued to keep the Communists off-balance.\r\n\r\nA combat raid on 5 April typified the extensive Marine division night\r\nactivities forward of the line. Conducted by three platoons, less a\r\nsquad, of the KMC 10th Company, the raiding party had the mission of\r\ncapturing prisoners. Departing the MLR at 2300, the Korean Marines\r\nworked their way over the low ground and then crossed the Sachon River.\r\nImmediately thereafter the raid leader, who was the 10th Company\r\ncommander (First Lieutenant No Won Keun) dispatched two squad-sized\r\nambushes along the patrol route. The raiders then continued northwest\r\ntoward their objective, an area near the village of Tonggang-ni, a\r\nhalf mile beyond the river. When about 50 yards from its objective,\r\nthe patrol ran into tactical wire and an enemy sentry, who alerted his\r\nunit by rifle fire. The KMC raiders opened up and called in pre-planned\r\nmortar and artillery support. The CCF defenders replied immediately\r\nwith rifles and machine gun fire.\r\n\r\nTo complete the maneuver, the patrol leader positioned his machine guns\r\nto fire on the Communist flanks and directed one platoon to prepare\r\nfor a frontal assault on the defenders. At 0148, the 1st Platoon\r\nattacked from the right. A minute later the 2d Platoon charged headlong\r\nat the defenders. Hand-to-hand fighting followed until the Chinese\r\nbroke contact and disappeared into bunkers within the trenchline.\r\nFrom inside, the CCF soldiers continued the battle, firing through\r\ngun revetments and wounding several KMC pursuers in the legs. After\r\n30 minutes had passed, the South Korean assault troops observed enemy\r\nreinforcements moving in from the northwest. At 0230, the Marine patrol\r\nwithdrew under the cover of artillery, reaching its battalion MLR at\r\n0400. The raiders brought back seven civilians found in the area and\r\nseveral Russian-made carbines. At the cost of 2 killed and 18 wounded,\r\nthe KMCs inflicted casualties totaling 12 counted killed and 25\r\nestimated wounded.\r\n\r\nOther division patrols similarly took into custody civilians living\r\nbetween the MLR and OPLR. It was also the job of these patrols to\r\ndestroy buildings that the enemy had used. On the night of 5 April, 5th\r\nMarines patrols apprehended 34 civilians, and a wounded enemy soldier.\r\nThe day before, a patrol from 2/1 had also captured a Chinese soldier.\r\n\r\nOn 12 and 13 April, the enemy stepped up his ground actions. He\r\nlaunched two probes against the 5th Marines occupying the center\r\nregimental sector. Both attempts were beaten back. The 1st Marines on\r\nthe extreme right flank encountered little hostile activity, but in\r\nthe western KMC sector, Chinese shelling increased noticeably. The\r\nfollowing day the artillery picked up again, accompanied by several\r\ninfantry probes directed against the two KMC frontline battalions. To\r\nthe right, the Chinese also tested 5th Marines lines again. On the far\r\nright, in the area held by the 1st Marines, an air alert was sounded\r\nfrom 0410 to 0726, but no enemy aircraft appeared. By mid-month, the\r\nChinese were dispatching fewer infantry probes but firing a greater\r\nnumber of artillery and mortar shells toward the division line. The\r\nenemy even sent 25 rounds to Kimpo, where a total of only 4 had fallen\r\nduring the first two weeks in April.\r\n\r\nUshering in the second half of April was another Communist attack,\r\nthis one on 15–16 April and to be the last that month against the\r\ncentral part of the Marine Division sector. This attempt to breach the\r\nMarine lines was directed against Company E of 2/5, manning an outpost\r\nposition on the OPLR. The rest of the battalion was now holding the\r\nleft sector of the center regimental front, having assumed its new\r\nmission on line three days earlier in relief of 1/5, which reverted\r\nto the role of regimental reserve. Northwest of the 5th Marines MLR,\r\nthe Company E commander, Captain Charles C. Matthews, had placed a\r\nreinforced rifle platoon. His Marines had occupied several dug-in\r\npositions near the top of a 400-foot hill, known as Outpost 3 (OP 3).\r\n(See Map 5.) The platoon had been improving this outpost area and\r\nfortifications so that the bunkers could be employed for living and\r\nfighting.[45] During the afternoon and again at dusk on 15 April the\r\nCommunists had shelled this location. One Marine was wounded in the\r\nsecond firing.\r\n\r\n     [45] Chapter III discusses in detail the construction of\r\n          bunkers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 5      K. WHITE\r\n\r\n2/5 SECTOR\r\n\r\n15–16 APRIL 1952]\r\n\r\nAt 2330 on 15 April, Company E reported that a green flare cluster had\r\njust burst over Hill 67, approximately 1,900 yards southwest of OP\r\n3 and just beyond the OPLR. This signal triggered a 20-minute heavy\r\nenemy preparation of 76mm artillery and 120mm mortars on the friendly\r\noutpost and its supporting mortar position. Ten minutes before\r\nmidnight, another green flare exploded over the same height, and the\r\nshelling stopped. After five minutes the signal reappeared. Immediately\r\nthereafter, the Chinese shifted their artillery and mortar fire to an\r\narea west of the OP 3 mortar site and north of a Company F observation\r\npost. At the same time, the enemy attacked Outpost 3.\r\n\r\nInitially, the Chinese struck the Marine defenses in a frontal\r\nassault, but as the fighting progressed enemy forces quickly enveloped\r\nthe outpost and charged it simultaneously from three sides. The\r\nvastly outnumbered Marine defenders withdrew into a tight perimeter\r\nat the southeastern corner of the outpost where their defending\r\nfirepower prevented the enemy from seizing the position. Within 15\r\nminutes the enemy had surrounded the Marines and severed the outpost\r\ncommunications, but could not take the outpost. The CCF soldiers then\r\npulled back and let their artillery soften OP 3 while they regrouped\r\nfor another assault. The Chinese soon stormed the outpost a second\r\ntime, but were again unsuccessful. Moreover, they lost three of their\r\nmen who were captured by the tenacious 2/5 defenders.\r\n\r\nThe fighting continued until 0315, reaching a hand-to-hand clash at one\r\nstage. In addition to mortar and artillery fire, the enemy employed\r\nsmall arms, automatic weapons, hand and stick-type grenades, bangalore\r\ntorpedoes, and 57mm recoilless rifles. During the attack, patrols were\r\nsent out from the MLR and OP 2, to the west, to reestablish contact and\r\nhelp with casualty evacuation.\r\n\r\nWell to the rear of the outpost and unknown to its occupants,\r\nintelligence personnel intercepted a Chinese message ordering the\r\nCommunists to withdraw. Immediately, friendly artillery fired on\r\nall known escape routes available to the attackers. Despite this\r\ninterdicting fire, the enemy soldiers managed to withdraw without\r\nfurther loss. Their unsuccessful thrust against the 2/5 OPLR cost the\r\nChinese 25 known killed, 25 estimated killed, 45 known wounded, and 3\r\nprisoners. Marine casualties were 6 killed, 5 missing, and 25 wounded\r\nand evacuated.[46]\r\n\r\n     [46] One of those wounded was Corporal Duane E. Dewey, a\r\n          machine gunner. He was wounded twice, in fact, the\r\n          second time from an exploding enemy grenade which he had\r\n          rolled upon to shield two nearby comrades. Dewey somehow\r\n          survived, and the following March, after release from\r\n          the Marine Corps, he went to the White House where he\r\n          received the Medal of Honor, the first to be presented by\r\n          the new President, Dwight D. Eisenhower. (Duane E. Dewey\r\n          Biog. File)\r\n\r\nWhy the Chinese had selected OP 3 for their mid-April attack is not\r\nknown. Several theories, however, have been advanced by those involved\r\nin the action. Colonel Culhane, the regimental commander, believed that\r\nthe enemy incursion “was the direct result of the aggressive patrols\r\nthat frequently used the outpost as a point of departure....”[47]\r\nBrigadier General Merrill B. Twining, the assistant division commander\r\nsince 22 March, declared that the position was too large for a\r\nreinforced platoon to hold.[48] Perhaps the Chinese had harbored the\r\nsame thoughts before the night of 15–16 April.\r\n\r\n     [47] _Culhane ltr._\r\n\r\n     [48] LtGen Merrill B. Twining ltr to Deputy Asst CofS, G-3,\r\n          HQMC, dtd 19 Aug 54.\r\n\r\nJust before its OPLR was withdrawn in favor of an observation line, the\r\n1st Korean Regiment was struck by the Chinese in the area immediately\r\nnorth of the 1–2 April clash. Beginning at 0100 on 17 April, the\r\nenemy placed a 15-minute preparatory fire on the left flank of the\r\n3d Battalion, occupying the regimental right sector. The CCF then\r\nprobed friendly lines in and around the area pounded during the\r\npreliminary fires. Three separate attacks took place before 0400, when\r\nthe Communists withdrew. In these probes, the Chinese made free use\r\nof automatic weapons; the enemy’s well-coordinated action attested\r\nto their training and discipline. Confirmed casualties were 36 CCF\r\nand 2 Koreans killed. The KMCs suffered 5 wounded and estimated that\r\n70 Chinese had been wounded. Although the South Koreans frequently\r\ncalled down artillery support during the attack, most of the casualties\r\ninflicted on the enemy were from rifle and machine gun fire. The 17\r\nApril probe was to mark the last major infantry action for the 1st\r\nMarine Division during its second month on JAMESTOWN.\r\n\r\nThroughout the month a total of 5,000 rounds of artillery fire and\r\n3,786 rounds of mortar fire fell in the division sector. On 2 April\r\nthe greatest volume for any single day was received: 3,000 artillery\r\nand 118 mortar rounds. An average day’s incoming, during April, was\r\napproximately 167 artillery and 125 mortar rounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Strengthening the Line_[49]\r\n\r\n     [49] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, Chap. 9; 1stMarDiv\r\n          ComdD, Apr 52; KMC Regt UnitRpt 46, dtd 17 Apr 52.\r\n\r\nEven before the Communists had launched their mid-April attacks\r\nagainst JAMESTOWN, the 1st Marine Division had implemented plans to\r\nstrengthen its line in western Korea. Besides the digging, timbering,\r\nand sandbagging to accomplish a major improvement of the physical\r\ndefenses, General Selden required Marine infantry regiments to conduct\r\nan aggressive defense of their sector of responsibility. He ordered\r\nMLR units to employ snipers all along JAMESTOWN and to dispatch daily\r\npatrols forward of the line to ambush, raid, kill, or capture Chinese\r\nand their positions. The division commander further directed that\r\nsupporting arms such as artillery, tank, and air, when available, be\r\nused to destroy hostile defenses, harass the enemy, and break up his\r\nassemblies as well as to protect Marine positions.\r\n\r\nAs a result of an I Corps directive, the 1st Marine Division assumed\r\nresponsibility for an additional 6,800 yards of front on 14 April from\r\nthe 1st Commonwealth Division sector to the right of the division.\r\nIn preparation, the 5th Marines had taken over the western end of\r\nthe 1st Marines sector, held by 2/1, two days earlier. On the 14th\r\nthe 1st Marines, newly commanded by Colonel Walter N. Flournoy,[50]\r\nextended its line eastward to assume new limiting points and part of\r\nthe MLR in the western part of the Canadian Brigade sector. Relief of\r\nthe Commonwealth unit was completed without any difficulty or enemy\r\ninterference. This additional yardage, plus the Kimpo Peninsula front,\r\nnow stretched the Marine division MLR to 35½ miles.\r\n\r\n     [50] Colonel Flournoy became regimental CO on 10 April,\r\n          succeeding Colonel Wade.\r\n\r\nAs a result, General Selden found it necessary to withdraw the division\r\ngeneral outpost line in order to build up his main line of resistance.\r\nOn 17 April, the 1st KMC Regiment reduced its OPLR to an OPLO (outpost\r\nline of observation) and the left battalion pulled its MLR back to\r\nmore defensible ground. The Marine division center and right regiments\r\nwithdrew their outpost lines on 23 and 24 April. Both regiments then\r\nestablished forward outposts and listening posts which, in many cases,\r\nutilized former OPLR positions. Many of these posts were manned during\r\ndaylight hours only.\r\n\r\nAbandonment of the forward OPLR added strength to the main line, but it\r\nalso meant that frontline battalions had to commit all their companies\r\non line, thus losing their reserve. To prevent Chinese occupation of\r\ndesirable terrain features on the former OPLR, the division dispatched\r\ncombat and reconnaissance patrols forward of its line. In the KMC\r\nsector, the only Marine area favorable for tank operations forward of\r\nJAMESTOWN, tank-infantry patrols were periodically employed.\r\n\r\nTo the west of the KMC sector, the Marine 1st Amphibian Tractor\r\nBattalion (Lieutenant Colonel Michiel Dobervich) was assigned a\r\nsection of the KANSAS Line to defend, beginning 16 April. Reinforced\r\nby attachment of the Division Reconnaissance Company (Major Ephraim\r\nKirby-Smith) that same day, Lieutenant Colonel Dobervich employed\r\nCompany C (two platoons), the headquarters LVT platoon, and the\r\nreconnaissance unit to man 30 defensive positions from the Han River\r\neastward to the KMC western boundary.[51]\r\n\r\n     [51] Company A, 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion had been\r\n          attached to the Kimpo Provisional Regiment since 31 March\r\n          and Company B was supporting MAG-33 at Pohang.\r\n\r\nTwo other measures to strengthen his sector of JAMESTOWN were utilized\r\nby the Marine division commander. On 18 April, he asked General\r\nO’Daniel to reconsider the no-fire zone recently established by the\r\ncorps commander. General Selden, who had received reports of Chinese\r\nuse of the sanctuary located within Marine Corps territory--for firing\r\npositions and assembly areas primarily--recommended, after I Corps\r\nhad refused him permission to fire into the haven, a redrawing of the\r\nO’Daniel line to coincide more closely with the boundaries established\r\nby the UN. Approval along the lines submitted by the division was\r\ngiven by I Corps that same day. The second measure employed by General\r\nSelden was use of an additional defensive line, WYOMING FORWARD. This\r\nposition, closely paralleling JAMESTOWN in the KMC and 5th Marines\r\nsectors, added depth to the sector defenses.\r\n\r\nA unique rescue and recovery operation also came into existence about\r\nthis time. On 19 April the division ordered the 5th Marines, occupying\r\nthe center regimental sector, to organize a tank-infantry force for\r\nrescue of the United Nations Truce Team, should such action become\r\nnecessary. The regimental plan, published on 22 April, utilized a\r\nreinforced rifle company-tank company organization directly supported\r\nby organic 5th Marines 4.2-inch mortars and 1/11. The Everready Rescue\r\nForce, from the regimental reserve, occupied the high ground (OP 2)\r\neast of and dominating Panmunjom.\r\n\r\nIn addition to setting forth organizational details of the task unit,\r\nthe 5th Marines Operational Plan 6-52 specified the method of operation\r\nfor the rescue force. Taking advantage of the peace corridor in the\r\nwestern end of the center sector, a Forward Covering Force would\r\nspeed tank-riding infantry to the high ground one-half mile beyond\r\nthe objective, Panmunjon. Following would be the Pick-Up Force, from\r\nthe 1st Tank Battalion Headquarters Platoon, which would retrieve the\r\nprincipal UN delegates and take them quickly to the assembly area\r\ntwo miles to the rear of the MLR. A Rear Covering Force, composed of\r\na tank-infantry element, would follow the Pick-Up force both on its\r\nway towards the objective and on the return trip. Withdrawal of both\r\ncovering forces was regulated by a series of phase lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marine Air Operations_[52]\r\n\r\n     [52] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, Chaps. 9, 10;\r\n          1st MAW, HMR-161, VMO-6 ComdDs, Apr 52; Lynn Montross,\r\n          _Cavalry of the Sky--The Story of U. S. Marine Combat\r\n          Helicopters_ (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1954),\r\n          hereafter Montross, _SkyCav_, quoted with permission of\r\n          the publishers.\r\n\r\nEven though the Marine air-ground team had been shorn of much of its\r\ntactical aviation, what remained was well utilized. Helicopter troop\r\noperations had become commonplace by the end of April 1952. That month\r\nthere were three exercises to further evaluate tactical concepts of\r\nhelicopter employment. Operation PRONTO, conducted on 5 April, was the\r\nfirst major troop lift in the new I Corps sector. In this maneuver\r\napproximately 670 troops of 2/7 and 10,000 pounds of rations were\r\ntransported by helicopter and truck from the Munsan-ni vicinity across\r\nthe Han River to the Kimpo Peninsula. Here the reserve battalion\r\nserved as a counterattack force in a hypothetical enemy landing. Due\r\nto the necessity for avoiding the neutrality zone in the Munsan area,\r\nround-trip flights averaged about 57 miles.\r\n\r\nThe exercise combined the shortest notice and longest distance of any\r\nlarge-scale helicopter troop movement conducted by HMR-161. It pointed\r\nto the fact that a helicopter unit could successfully lift a troop\r\norganization virtually as an “on call” tactical tool and without the\r\nbenefit of previous liaison.\r\n\r\nOperation LEAPFROG, on 18–19 April, transported one KMC battalion\r\nacross the Han to the peninsula and lifted out another the following\r\nday. The purpose of this test was to determine the feasibility of a\r\nreplacement movement conducted over water, with “consideration given to\r\nthe language barrier existing between the troops and the transporting\r\nfacility.”[53] The six-mile round trip was the shortest troop haul yet\r\nmade by the transport chopper squadron. Consequently, it took the 12\r\nHRS-1 single-engine Sikorsky aircraft only 3 hours and 26 minutes to\r\ncomplete the exchange of the 1,702 KMC troops.\r\n\r\n     [53] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, 10-73.\r\n\r\nColonel McCutcheon’s HMR-161 pilots found that their helicopters could\r\ncarry six combat-equipped Korean Marines instead of five American\r\nMarines, due to the smaller size and weight of the average Korean.\r\nSince the U.S. and KMC Marine battalions were the same size, the larger\r\nload factor for the Korean Marines enabled their unit to be moved\r\nfaster. In LEAPFROG the language difference proved to be no handicap,\r\nsince there were sufficient interpreters on hand and the troops were\r\ncooperative. Helicopter pilots could use landing sites close together\r\nbecause the terrain was open and the area of operations beyond the\r\nreach of Chinese artillery.\r\n\r\nClose on the heels of LEAPFROG came a third airlift. Operation CIRCUS,\r\nconducted on 23 April, provided for the air deployment of the 7th\r\nMarines reserve regiment, minus two battalions, across the Imjin to\r\nlanding sites just to the rear of the secondary defensive line, WYOMING\r\nFORWARD. Ten helicopters carried 1,185 Marines over the river barrier\r\nto blocking positions in 90 minutes. The CIRCUS exercise illustrated\r\nthat a minimum distance should be maintained between loading and\r\nunloading sites for a safe and efficient transport operation. It also\r\npointed up that “consideration must be given to the number of aircraft\r\nassigned to each traffic pattern during short hops over a river.”[54]\r\nThis successful maneuver came three days before all HRS-1 aircraft were\r\ngrounded due to a defect in the tail rotors. By mid-May the problem had\r\nbeen corrected and the aircraft returned to flying status.\r\n\r\n     [54] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, p. 9-50.\r\n\r\nDuring April, Lieutenant Colonel Herring’s VMO-6 employed its 11\r\nsingle-engine OE-1 observation planes for a total of 508 fixed-wing\r\ncombat flights. More than half of these, 275, were for artillery\r\nspotting; of the remainder, 166 were flown for reconnaissance and 67\r\nrepresented photo, weather, liaison, and area check-out maneuvers.\r\nCombat flights by the squadron helicopters[55] during the month were\r\n110 liaison, 45 reconnaissance, and 93 evacuations. Of the total 756\r\ncombat flights performed by both fixed-wing and rotary craft, 511 were\r\nover enemy territory.\r\n\r\n     [55] Rotary wing aircraft assigned were two types, HTL-4 and\r\n          H03S-1. The former is a two-place, plastic-dome Bell\r\n          product; the latter, the first helicopter operated by the\r\n          Marine Corps, is an observation-utility, three-passenger\r\n          Sikorsky-made craft. HistBr, G-3 Div, HQMC, _Marine Corps\r\n          Aircraft, 1913–1965_, Marine Corps Historical Reference\r\n          Pamphlet (Washington: 1967 ed.) pp. 34, 38.\r\n\r\nDuring that same month, Marine squadrons operating under the Fifth Air\r\nForce put a total of 2,708 planes into the air despite restrictive or\r\nprohibitive weather on 20 days. Continuing its emphasis on attacking\r\nthe North Korean transportation system, the Air Force command\r\ndispatched 1,397 Marine planes on interdiction missions. Marine-piloted\r\nclose air support sorties flown to assist the 1st Marine Division\r\nnumbered only 56 throughout April; those piloted by Marines for 16\r\nother UN divisions totaled 547.\r\n\r\nNot all the air sortie records were made by land-based Marine\r\nsquadrons. On 18 April, VMA-312, the CTE 95.11 squadron provided by\r\nthe 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, flew 80 sorties, a Korean record for a\r\ncarrier-based squadron to that date and twice the daily average for the\r\ninitial six months of 1952.\r\n\r\nBy 20 April the three tactical squadrons of MAG-12--VMF(N)-513,\r\nVMF-212, and VMF-323--had completed their relocations on the Korean\r\nwest coast. Two days later, combined MAG-12 attack and -33 jet aircraft\r\nparticipated in what was a Fifth Air Force one-day combat record: 1,049\r\nsorties.\r\n\r\nOne MAG-33 unit, the newly-formed Marine Photographic Squadron 1,\r\nwas already flying a large number of aerial reconnaissance missions\r\ndirected by Fifth Air Force. It provided almost one-third of the\r\ndaylight photo effort required by FAF with but one-quarter of the\r\naircraft.[56] VMJ-1’s complement of a dozen 550 mph McDonnell twin-jet\r\nBanshee F2H-2P aircraft mounted three cameras and were capable both of\r\nhigh altitude work and good speed. Introduction of this single-seat jet\r\nwas considered the “first important development in aerial photography\r\nin the Korean War,”[57] since the Banshee could outproduce any photo\r\nplane in Korea.\r\n\r\n     [56] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, pp. 10-2, 10-108. This record was\r\n          established despite the fact that the Marine squadron,\r\n          with 10 jets, flying out of K-3 (Pohang) was more than\r\n          150 miles further from most targets than the other major\r\n          photo unit, the 15th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron\r\n          of the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, based at K-14\r\n          (Kimpo).\r\n\r\n     [57] _Ibid._, p. 10-59.\r\n\r\nThe month of April also marked change of command ceremonies for the\r\n1st Marine Aircraft Wing. On 11 April at K-3, General Schilt turned\r\nover wing responsibility to Brigadier General Clayton C. Jerome. Among\r\nthe numerous civilian and military dignitaries attending the ceremony\r\nat the Pohang 1st MAW headquarters were the Honorable John J. Muccio,\r\nU.S. Ambassador to Korea; Air Force Lieutenant Generals Otto P. Weyland\r\nand Frank F. Everest, commanders of FEAF and FAF respectively; and the\r\nMarine division CG, Major General Selden.\r\n\r\nThe new wing commander, General Jerome, like his predecessor, had a\r\ndistinguished flight career. A 1922 graduate of the Naval Academy,\r\nhe had served in various foreign and U.S. aviation billets and was\r\na veteran of five World War II campaigns. In 1943 Colonel Jerome\r\nwas operations officer for Commander, Aircraft, Solomon Islands.\r\nLater he was named Chief of Staff, Commander, Aircraft, Northern\r\nSolomons and Commander, Aircraft and Island Commander, Emirau, in the\r\nnorthern Solomons. Before returning to the States, Colonel Jerome had\r\nparticipated in the recapture of the Philippines, commanding MAG-32\r\nand directing all Marine air support in the Luzon fighting. Brigadier\r\nGeneral Jerome became Director of Aviation and Assistant Commandant of\r\nthe Marine Corps for Air in September 1950 and served in this capacity\r\nuntil taking command of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing in Korea.[58]\r\n\r\n     [58] DivInfo, HQMC, Biography of LtGen Clayton C. Jerome, Jul\r\n          58, rev.\r\n\r\nDuring the command ceremonies the outgoing 1st MAW commander, General\r\nSchilt, was presented the Distinguished Service Medal for his\r\noutstanding leadership of the wing. The award was made by Lieutenant\r\nGeneral Weyland. Shortly before his Korean tour ended, General Schilt\r\nhad also received from ROK President Syngman Rhee the Order of Military\r\nMerit Taiguk, for his contribution to the military defense of South\r\nKorea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Supporting the Division and the Wing_[59]\r\n\r\n     [59] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, Chaps. 9, 10;\r\n          1stMarDiv, 1st MAW, 1st CSG, 11thMar, 1st TkBn ComdDs,\r\n          Mar-Apr 52; 1st CSG UnitRpts, Apr 52.\r\n\r\nBecause of the command relationships existing in Korea, with all\r\nground units under operational control of CG, EUSAK, the majority of\r\nthe logistical support to the Marines was handled by the Army. Eighth\r\nArmy, 2d Logistical Command (2d LogCom) provided for resupply of items\r\nused commonly by both Marine and Army personnel; the Marine Corps\r\n(Commanding General, FMFPac) furnished those supplies and equipment\r\nused by Marine units only.\r\n\r\nWhen the division moved to the west, the 1st Shore Party Battalion\r\nopened a rear service area at Ascom City. Here the division established\r\nand maintained Class II (organizational equipment) and IV (special\r\nequipment) dumps for its units, as well as Class I (rations) and III\r\n(petroleum products) facilities for both the Kimpo regiment and the\r\nservice units stationed at Ascom. Class I shipments were forwarded\r\nto the Munsan-ni railhead and stored there. Fuels and lubricants and\r\nClass V items (ordnance) were received from the U.S. Army. A forward\r\nammunition supply point (ASP) was located north of the Imjin to assure\r\na steady flow of ammunition to frontline combat units in the event that\r\neither an enemy attack or emergency flooding conditions of the river\r\nprevented use of the bridges. For the same reason a truck company was\r\npositioned near this supply point each night.\r\n\r\nReinforcing the division logistic effort was the 1st Combat Service\r\nGroup. Commanded by Colonel Russell N. Jordahl, the 1st CSG in late\r\nApril had nearly 1,400 Marines and Navy medical personnel stationed at\r\nvarious points between Japan and Korea. At Kobe, Japan, the Support\r\nCompany processed Marine drafts arriving and departing Korea. At Masan,\r\nthe Supply Company, 1st CSG, requisitioned for the division those\r\nClass II and IV items peculiar to the Marine Corps needs and forwarded\r\nthem upon request. Heavy maintenance of all technical equipment\r\nwas performed by the Maintenance Company. Supporting the 1st Motor\r\nTransport Battalion operation was the Motor Transport Company, 1st\r\nCSG. Most of the group, including Headquarters Company, was based at\r\nMasan.[60] Splinter detachments from the group also operated transport\r\nfacilities at other locations in Korea.\r\n\r\n     [60] The Support Company moved to Ascom City on 14 Jun 52.\r\n\r\nIn western Korea, good rail transport into Munsan-ni and an adequate\r\nbut not all-weather road system improved the division’s logistical\r\nsituation. Greater storage facilities also existed in the JAMESTOWN\r\nrear supply areas than in the X Corps sector just vacated by the\r\nMarines. Division motor equipment did not suffer any appreciable damage\r\ndue to the rigors of the MIXMASTER transplacement. Vehicle maintenance\r\nalso presented a favorable outlook, due to the expected decreased use\r\nduring the period of positional warfare. On the other hand, an unduly\r\nlarge number of tanks developed engine troubles in March, which were\r\ntraced back to defective oil cooling fans. This condition was corrected\r\nin April and May by installation of new fan assemblies.\r\n\r\nGuns of the 1st Tank Battalion immediately began to render valuable\r\nsupport to Marine frontline regiments with the division’s new\r\nassignment in the west. Companies A, B, and C were placed in direct\r\nsupport of the three forward infantry regiments. Company D drew the\r\nreserve mission, which included tank-infantry training with the 7th\r\nMarines and preparation for reinforcing division artillery fires. Tank\r\ncompanies were used almost daily in the forward sectors for destruction\r\nby direct fire of the Chinese MLR fortifications. For such missions the\r\nM-46 tanks, equipped with high-velocity 90mm guns, lumbered forward\r\nfrom secure assembly areas to the rear of JAMESTOWN to temporary firing\r\npositions on the line.\r\n\r\nAfter pouring direct fire on preselected targets and completion of the\r\nfire mission, the armored vehicles then returned to the rear. Less\r\nfrequently, a five-vehicle tank platoon accompanied a reinforced rifle\r\nplatoon and conducted daylight reconnaissance missions of forward areas\r\nto engage the Chinese and to gain intelligence about enemy positions\r\nand terrain. During April six such tank-infantry patrols, all in the\r\nKMC regimental area, failed to establish direct contact with the enemy\r\nbut did draw mortar and artillery fire.\r\n\r\nMarine artillery, which had been receiving its share of attention\r\nfrom Communist field guns,[61] was faced by problems in two other\r\nrespects. Although the enemy held only four more artillery weapons\r\nthan did the Marines, General Seiden still lacked the ability to\r\nmass artillery fires to the same degree as did the Chinese.[62] This\r\nlimitation stemmed directly from the wide physical separation of 11th\r\nMarines batteries and the frontline infantry regiments being supported.\r\nA second problem, the loss of qualified forward observers--reserve\r\nofficers due to return to the States for release from active\r\nservice--forced the 11th Marines to begin a school to train infantry\r\nofficers for this function. To make the course realistic, all firing\r\nwas done at live targets.[63]\r\n\r\n     [61] One artillery weapon, in particular, as well as the\r\n          Marine tanks habitually drew the fury of Chinese\r\n          counterfire. The heavy destructive power of the U.S. Army\r\n          8-inch, self-propelled howitzers firing on tough Chinese\r\n          defensive positions, generally brought down on their own\r\n          emplacements a rain of enemy shells, so sensitive were\r\n          enemy commanders to these hard-hitting weapons. _Pala\r\n          comments._\r\n\r\n     [62] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, Chap. 9, p. 9-39.\r\n\r\n     [63] BGen Frederick P. Henderson ltr to CMC, dtd 6 Sep 66,\r\n          hereafter _Henderson ltr II_.\r\n\r\nIn April 1952, the 11th Marines organization had three light 105mm\r\nhowitzer battalions (54 guns), one medium 155mm howitzer battalion (12\r\nguns), the KMC 105mm howitzer battalion (18 pieces), and a 4.5-inch\r\nrocket battery (6 launchers). Attached to the 1st Marine Division and\r\nlocated in its sector were one battalion and one battery of the I Corps\r\nfield artillery. The mission of the Marine artillery regiment was to\r\nprovide accurate and timely fires in support of both the MLR and OPLR\r\ndefenses, until withdrawal of the latter late in April. Batteries\r\nof the 11th Marines also fired on known and suspected Chinese gun\r\nemplacements and on targets of opportunity. The regiment also provided\r\nintelligence on enemy artillery.\r\n\r\nThroughout April, Colonel Henderson’s units continued to improve\r\ntheir tactical and administrative areas, concentrating on field\r\nfortifications, wire communications, and road trafficability. In the\r\nlast category, the artillery dozers and dump trucks not only did\r\nnearly all of this work for the 11th Marines but also provided “a fair\r\namount of ‘direct support’ bulldozing to the infantry regiments and\r\noccasionally loaned dozers and operators to the engineers.”[64]\r\n\r\n     [64] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nWithin a Marine aircraft wing, personnel and equipment for logistic\r\nsupport are purposely limited to carrying out the wing primary\r\nmission--providing air support during an amphibious operation. The wing\r\nT/O (Table of Organization) provides a streamlined organization with\r\nlight, transportable organic equipment. Additional logistical support\r\npersonnel and equipment are not included since this would result in (1)\r\na duplication of support effort between the wing and landing force\r\nand (2) a great increase in wing transport shipping requirements. When\r\nthe wing moves ashore, organic units render support necessary for\r\noperations on the airfield only. Responsibility for activities beyond\r\nthis basic mission--airfield construction, maintenance of runways,\r\nand movement of supplies to the airfield--must come from more senior\r\ncommands. Usually such assistance is obtained by attaching elements of\r\na naval construction battalion and other logistical support units.\r\n\r\nIn April 1952, Naval Construction Battalion Unit 1804 assisted in\r\nthe construction and maintenance received by MAG-33 at K-3. Here at\r\nthe port of Pohang, a detachment from the 1st Combat Service Group\r\ncontrolled the movement of fuels, oils, lubricants, and ordnance to\r\nwing dumps. Amphibian tractors (LVTs) of Company B, 1st Amphibian\r\nTractor Battalion, provided most of the transportation required for\r\nthese supplies excepting ordnance. Assistance in the form of amphibious\r\ntrucks (DUKWs) was furnished by a platoon from the 1st Amphibian Truck\r\nCompany. When required, Marines of these two companies manhandled the\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nLogistical support for the Marine wing was governed by the same general\r\nprocedures that applied to the division; 1st MAW supply requirements\r\nbeyond its augmented capability became the responsibility of Eighth\r\nArmy (2d LogCom) which furnished items common to both Marine and Army\r\nunits. If this EUSAK agency did not stock the requisitioned item,\r\nit provided a substitute. Responsibility for resupply of aviation\r\nitems rested with the U.S. Navy. Commander, Naval Forces, Far East\r\n(ComNavFE) replaced unserviceable aviation technical equipment such as\r\naircraft parts and special maintenance tools. Commander, Service Force,\r\nPacific (ComServPac) replenished aviation ordnance. Responsibility for\r\nsupplying items peculiar to the Marine Corps rested with CG, FMFPac.\r\n\r\nThe repair and maintenance of 1st MAW equipment posed far less of a\r\nproblem than the construction and upkeep of airfields. Major repair\r\nwork on aircraft was satisfactorily performed in Japan by the wing\r\nsupport squadron at Itami, and by the U.S. Navy Fleet Air Service\r\nSquadron 11 (FASRon-11), located at the Naval Air Station, Atsugi.\r\nThe establishment in Japan of the wing heavy maintenance facility\r\ndepended, in part, upon its proximity to the wing flying squadrons.\r\nOther considerations were the availability to the wing commander of\r\nadequate air transport for continuous resupply of both routine and\r\nemergency items and reliable communications between the users and the\r\nmaintenance unit. Because these conditions favoring removal of the\r\nheavy maintenance facility from the immediate combat area existed\r\nthroughout Korean hostilities, it was possible for the maintenance\r\nunits to operate successfully in Japan away from the combat zone.\r\n\r\nAir base construction and maintenance of airfield runways and taxiways\r\nhad plagued wing operations since the early days of the Korean War.\r\nDuring the first winter these problems had appeared repeatedly at those\r\ninstallations where Marine air was either not properly supported or\r\ninsufficiently augmented by the operational commander. Shortly after\r\nMAG-33 had moved to K-3 in early 1951, the wing commander requested\r\nemergency repairs for the runway and a permanent solution to the\r\nairfield maintenance difficulties. Assistance was made available, but\r\nit was insufficient. The repair force had to be augmented by Marines\r\npulled away from their own vital jobs and by native laborers. Later, in\r\nthe spring of 1952, when the Air Force assigned some of its engineers\r\nto assist, the maintenance problem almost disappeared.\r\n\r\nMotor transport within the wing was a continuing source of logistical\r\nproblems. Vehicles for handling the heavier aviation ordnance were\r\nunsatisfactory because their configuration, of World War II vintage,\r\ndid not permit them to service the newer aircraft. Other trucks lacked\r\nengine power or rigidity to withstand sustained use under primitive\r\nairfield conditions. World War II vehicles that had been preserved and\r\nplaced in open storage required reconditioning before their use in\r\nKorea. Mechanics’ general and special tools had a high replacement rate\r\nthroughout the entire period of wing operations in Korea.\r\n\r\nAircraft fuel handling in April 1952 followed outmoded World War\r\nII methods. For K-3, amphibian vehicles received drummed fuel from\r\nships and landed it at the beach. There MAG-33 personnel transferred\r\nthe gasoline to 1,200-gallon fuel trucks, which then moved it to the\r\nairfield servicing area, where other Marines transferred it again,\r\nthis time to 3,200-gallon stationary refuelers for dispensing into\r\nthe aircraft. Although this method became highly developed, it was\r\nextremely slow and wasteful of manpower and vehicles in comparison to\r\nthe tank farm system, which was soon to reach K-3.\r\n\r\nTwo areas of logistics continued to remain almost trouble free for\r\ndivision and wing Marines. Medical problems existed but were not\r\nextensive. During a five-day period in late March, Marine Air Control\r\nGroup 2 experienced 13 cases of scarlet fever but no fatalities. That\r\nsame month, the Pacific Fleet Medical Officer noted that MAG-12 sick\r\nbays were in excellent condition and that medical “personnel have shown\r\ngreat ingenuity in fabricating various items of medical equipment from\r\nscrap metal and lumber.”[65]\r\n\r\n     [65] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, Chap. 12, p. 12-8. The medical\r\n          officer’s report to CinCPac noted that a vast improvement\r\n          “in the spaces allocated for the care of the sick and\r\n          wounded” had been made.\r\n\r\nEvacuation of casualties and the utilization of air vehicles for\r\ntransport of passengers and cargo proved to be the second asset in\r\nlogistical operations. The Itami-based detachment of VMR-152 moved\r\n7,757 personnel from the division and wing and 738.7 tons of cargo\r\nduring April 1952. In addition, the R5D craft hauled a total of 325.2\r\ntons of U.S. mail that month for the two Marine organizations. Speedy\r\nremoval of patients to better equipped facilities in the rear by\r\nVMO-6 and HMR-161 helicopters was a giant step forward in life-saving\r\ntechniques. VMO-6 usually provided this service, but early in April,\r\nColonel McCutcheon’s squadron was assigned emergency medical evacuation\r\nduties to augment the observation squadron.[66] Pilots flew these\r\nevacuation missions with almost total disregard for adverse weather or\r\ndarkness, and without radar control or adequate instrumentation for\r\nall-weather operations.[67]\r\n\r\n     [66] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, p. 10-69, p. 10-73.\r\n\r\n     [67] _Ibid._, p. 10-68. Flights were not made in heavy fog.\r\n          Test use by the Marine Corps Equipment Board of some of\r\n          the equipment needed to navigate under conditions of\r\n          reduced visibility was nearing the end of its development\r\n          cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Different Area, Different Problem_[68]\r\n\r\n     [68] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: CG, 1stMarDiv ltr to CMC, dtd 23 Jul 53,\r\n          Subj: Type “C” Rpt: “Civilian Affairs and the Korean\r\n          Service Corps, Mar 52-May 53,” hereafter CG, 1stMarDiv\r\n          ltr, _Civ Afrs and KSC_; 1stMarDiv ComdDs, Mar-Apr 52;\r\n          HqBn, 1stMarDiv ComdDs, Mar-Apr 52.\r\n\r\nAn additional responsibility the 1st Marine Division inherited\r\nwhen it moved to western Korea was control of civilians within the\r\ndivision boundary. In eastern Korea, all nonmilitary personnel had\r\nbeen evacuated from the vicinity of the MINNESOTA Line in the division\r\nsector; they had not been removed from the JAMESTOWN area. Prior to\r\nthe arrival of the division in the west, the STAYBACK Line, averaging\r\nseven miles to the rear of the Imjin River and running in a generally\r\nnortheast-southwest direction, had been established to limit the\r\nmovement of civilian personnel in the forward areas. The Marines soon\r\nfound that their predecessors must have been lax, however, in requiring\r\nthat Korean civilians remain behind STAYBACK. What seemed equally\r\nunsuitable to the division was the poor military-civilian relationship\r\nthat had apparently existed for some time.\r\n\r\nTo correct the situation, General Selden cautioned his units to avoid\r\nunnecessary damage or destruction to the civilian economy. He directed\r\nhis commanding officers to keep unauthorized Koreans away from Marine\r\ninstallations. Military police set up check points and instituted\r\nroving patrols to enforce division controls. Civil violators were\r\nturned over to Korean authorities or held for investigation before\r\nrelease. Civilians who lived in the forward areas were removed to the\r\nrear. They were prevented from going beyond STAYBACK until August 1952,\r\nwhen a controlled passage system was instituted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nDefending the Line\r\n\r\n_UN Command Activities--Defense of West and East Coast Korean\r\nIslands--Marine Air Operations--Spring 1952 on_ JAMESTOWN--_End\r\nof the Second Year of War--A Long Fourth of July--Changes in the\r\nLineup--Replacement and Rotation--Logistical Operations, Summer 1952_\r\n\r\n\r\n_UN Command Activities_[69]\r\n\r\n     [69] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: Cdr Malcolm W.

The tactical realignment in the spring\r\nof 1952 put more South Korean infantry units on the main line of\r\nresistance and buttressed the fighting front with five corps sectors\r\ninstead of four. In the far west, the I Corps positions were newly\r\nmanned (left to right) by the 1st Marine, 1st Commonwealth, 1st ROK,\r\nand the U.S. 45th Infantry Divisions. Next in line was IX Corps, whose\r\nleft boundary General Van Fleet[70] had shifted further west, which now\r\nhad a divisional line up of the ROK 9th on the left, the U.S. 7th in\r\nthe center, and the U.S. 40th on the right.\r\n\r\n     [70] General Van Fleet, CG, EUSAK since April 1951, had\r\n          advocated a program in which South Korean troops would be\r\n          rigorously trained to take over an increasingly greater\r\n          part of the UNC defense efforts in Korea. See Mark W.\r\n          Clark, _From the Danube to the Yalu_ (New York: Harper\r\n          & Brothers, 1954), p. 185, hereafter Clark, _Danube to\r\n          Yalu_, quoted with permission of the publishers.\r\n\r\nTo fill in the central part of the EUSAK front where the change of\r\nIX Corps boundary had created a gap in the line, the UN commander\r\ninserted the ROK II Corps with three divisions (ROK 6th, ROK Capital,\r\nand ROK 3d) forward. Immediately to the right of this new ROK corps\r\nsector, the X Corps continued in approximately its same position on\r\nthe east-central front. Its ROK 7th and U.S. 25th Divisions remained\r\non line, while the ROK 8th had advanced to the former sector of the\r\nMarine division in the wild Punchbowl country. At the far right of the\r\nUN line, the ROK I Corps front was held by the ROK 11th Division at the\r\nX Corps boundary and the ROK 5th along the Sea of Japan. By 1 May 1952,\r\nnine Republic of Korea divisions had been emplaced on the UNC main\r\ndefense line, three more than had been there in mid-March.\r\n\r\nThroughout Korea in March and April there had been a general stagnation\r\nof offensive action on both sides because of fog, rain, and mud. In\r\nMay, however, the Chinese launched no less than 30 probing attacks\r\nagainst the ROK 1st Division in the I Corps sector, without gaining\r\nany significant advantage. To the right, the enemy and the U.S. 45th\r\nDivision traded blows in several patrol actions. In June, major\r\nEUSAK combat action was still centered in the 45th’s sector, but the\r\nfollowing month was marked by sharp battlefront clashes in nearly all\r\nEighth Army division areas. For a two-week period in July and August,\r\nheavy seasonal rains limited both ground and air action. With the\r\nreturn of normal weather, heavy fighting again broke out, this time\r\nconcentrated in the I Corps sector. This action did not abate until\r\nlate August, when the onset of the heaviest rains of the season again\r\ndrastically reduced military operations.\r\n\r\nCommunist ground activity in the spring of 1952 was marked by increased\r\nartillery support which resulted in telling damage to UN infantry and\r\nartillery positions. Thus, during May, the enemy expended approximately\r\n102,000 artillery and mortar rounds against the Allied front, roughly\r\n12 times the number fired the previous July, just prior to the\r\nperiod of stabilized battlelines in Korea. The artillery buildup was\r\naccompanied by a sharp decrease in hostile air support activities.\r\nWhile the Chinese had flown 3,700 jet sorties during the first month of\r\n1952, by June the monthly total had dropped to 308.\r\n\r\nAs part of the balanced military forces, Allied air and sea units\r\ncontinued their active defense in support of UN ground units. Beginning\r\nin late May, Fifth Air Force shifted the emphasis of its destructive\r\neffort from interdiction of communication routes to the bombing of\r\nselected industrial targets. Naval air was committed to support the\r\nFAF programs. At sea, ships steamed almost at will to sustain the\r\nU.S. lifeline. Underscoring the complete UN control of Korean waters,\r\nlarge naval vessels offshore fired their big guns in support of\r\nground troops. Off both the west and east coasts, Task Force (TF) 95\r\nmaintained its blockade of North Korean ports and reduced the extent of\r\nwater travel that enemy craft could safely undertake. This same naval\r\nforce was responsible for the Allied defense of islands located off the\r\neast and west coasts of Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Defense of West and East Coast Korean Islands_[71]\r\n\r\n     [71] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpts_ No. 4, Chap. 9; No.\r\n          5, Chap. 8; West Coast Island Defense Element ComdDs,\r\n          Feb-Oct 52, hereafter _WCIDE ComdD_, with date; East\r\n          Coast Island Defense ComdDs, Jan-Oct 52, hereafter _ECIDE\r\n          ComdD_, with date; Col William K.

Most of these islands are tiny and are located south of\r\nthe 38th Parallel. Only a few lie off the east coast, and these are\r\nclustered primarily in the North Korean harbor of Wonsan. By early\r\n1951, UN forces exercised control over most of the Korean islands.\r\nTheir tactical importance is shown from their diverse use as sites for\r\nUN Command intelligence activities, USAF radar installations, locations\r\nfor the emergency landing strips used by Allied planes, bases for U.S.\r\nsearch and rescue operations, and as springboards for possible thrusts\r\ninto enemy rear areas.[72]\r\n\r\n     [72] Evidence of Chinese concern about such rear area attacks\r\n          is apparent in the countermeasures taken: “Order of\r\n          Battle reports indicated that a total of three North\r\n          Korean Corps and three Chinese Communist Armies were\r\n          engaged in coastal defense operations on the east and\r\n          west coasts of North Korea.” _PacFlt EvalRpt_, No. 5, p.\r\n          8-79.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for holding some of the islands had come to light\r\nduring truce negotiations in December 1951. At that time, in an\r\nattempt to expedite the successful conclusion of the truce meetings,\r\nUN representatives had offered the Communists all the islands north of\r\nthe 38th Parallel. Brushing aside the tactical value of the proposal,\r\nthe enemy boasted that he could capture the islands at any time.\r\nIn November 1951 the Communists had, in fact, seized two western\r\nislands near the mouth of the Yalu. The 1,000 defending guerrillas\r\nthere--former North Koreans working for the UNC--had been unable to\r\nstem the assault. The UN Command promptly reviewed the island situation\r\nand on 6 January 1952 gave TF 95, the United Nations Blockading and\r\nEscort Force, responsibility for both overall defense and local ground\r\ndefense for the 11 coastal islands north of the 38th Parallel and the\r\n4 islands immediately south of this boundary. Two subordinate blockade\r\ntask groups, one in the west and another in the east, were responsible\r\nfor the defense of these islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 6      K. White\r\n\r\nWEST COAST ISLAND DEFENSE ELEMENT\r\n\r\nSUMMER 1952]\r\n\r\nIn the west, Task Group (TG) 95.1 was charged with the defense of six\r\nislands. (See Map 6.) Two of these, Sok-to and Cho-do, lie between the\r\n38th and 39th Parallels; the four remaining islands, Paengyong-do,\r\nTaechong-do, Yongpyong-do, and Tokchok-to, are above the 37th Parallel.\r\nIn the east, TG 95.2 was responsible for keeping nine islands north\r\nof the 38th Parallel in friendly hands. Situated in Wonsan harbor\r\nare Mo-do, Sin-do, So-do, Tae-do, Hwangto-do, Ung-do, and Yo-do, the\r\nlargest. (See Map 7.) Another island, Yang-do, actually a two-island\r\ngroup further north in the area of the 41 st Parallel, is 18 miles\r\nnortheast of the coastal city of Songjin. The southernmost island,\r\ntiny Nan-do, is below Wonsan and the 39th Parallel and lies 10 miles\r\nnortheast of Kojo, another coastal city.\r\n\r\nGround defense of the islands had been, at best, a haphazard\r\narrangement before TF 95 took over the responsibility. Many of the\r\nislands, especially those inhabited by friendly guerrillas, had neither\r\nplans for a proper defense nor commanders experienced in organizing\r\nresistance to enemy attack. Soon after the two islands near the mouth\r\nof the Yalu were taken, ROK Marines were rushed to those islands\r\nconsidered most strategic for South Korean defense. Late in 1951, U.S.\r\nMarines had been assigned to the area in an advisory capacity. By early\r\n1952, Marine Corps detachments were in command of the island defense\r\nactivities for both task groups. Korean Marines provided a majority of\r\nthe actual defending forces.\r\n\r\nAlthough the 1st Marine Division initially had supplied the officers\r\nand men for the island security missions, in January 1952 FMFPac took\r\non direct responsibility for furnishing personnel and providing for\r\ntheir administrative and logistical support through the 1st Provisional\r\nCasual Company, FMFPac. Located at Otsu, Japan, the company was the\r\nadministrative headquarters for seriously wounded Marine division and\r\nwing personnel recuperating in service hospitals in Japan. Recovered\r\npatients who volunteered for duty with the offshore commands provided\r\nthe bulk of the Marines used in this defense. Major responsibilities\r\nwere to plan, organize, and conduct the defense of these islands off\r\nthe Korean west and east coasts. A task element under each task group\r\nwas created for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWith its headquarters at Paengyang-do, Task Element (TE) 95.15, the\r\nWest Coast Island Defense Element (WCIDE), was organized early in\r\nJanuary 1952. The following month, the initial complement of U.S.\r\nMarines arrived. Colonel William K. Davenport, Jr., element commander,\r\nassigned his 5 officers and 29 enlisted men to the 4 most critical\r\nislands and to his staff. Those islands garrisoned were Cho-do and\r\nSok-to, north of the Parallel and both within range of enemy mainland\r\nguns, and Paengyang-do and Yongpyong-do, to the south. Taechong-do,\r\nnear the command island, and Tokchok-to, southwest of Inchon, were both\r\nconsidered secure and not provided with U.S. Marine commanders. At each\r\nof the four occupied islands, Marines reconnoitered the terrain, drew\r\nup plans for preparation of defensive positions, organized and trained\r\nthe troops available, and began the laborious task of constructing\r\nthe defense. Protection against long-range hostile artillery fire was\r\nemphasized for the northern Sok-to and Cho-do garrisons.\r\n\r\nOff the other long coast of Korea, TE 95.23, the East Coast Island\r\nDefense Element (ECIDE), commanded until early May 1952 by Colonel\r\nFrank M. Reinecke, had an almost entirely different situation. Eight of\r\nthe nine islands in the vicinity of Wonsan Harbor or north of Songjin\r\nthat ECIDE was responsible for were within range of Communist shore\r\nbatteries and thus frequently fired upon. Even before the January\r\n1952 decision, the U.S. Navy had been charged with the security of\r\nthese east coast islands north of the 38th Parallel. For these reasons\r\nECIDE defenses had to maintain a greater state of readiness and were\r\nmore advanced than in the west. Fire support ships and land based\r\nU.S. Marine naval gunfire spotting teams from 1st ANGLICO (Air and\r\nNaval Gunfire Liaison Company), FMF, which also provided forward air\r\ncontrollers for the KMC regiment, stood by at all times to silence\r\nunfriendly artillery fire emanating from the mainland. The Marines had\r\nalso trained Korean Marines to handle the spotting missions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 7      K. WHITE\r\n\r\nEAST COAST DEFENSE ELEMENT\r\n\r\nSUMMER 1952]\r\n\r\nA number of events of major interest occurred during those first\r\ndifficult weeks following organization of the two offshore island\r\ncommands. On 19 and 20 February, elements of two North Korean infantry\r\nbattalions launched an unsuccessful assault against the two Yang-do\r\nislands. The combined “action of the island garrison and UN surface\r\nforces”[73] repulsed the enemy attempt, which had been planned to gain\r\nintelligence and kill as many of the defenders as possible.[74] On the\r\nheels of this action, with the first enemy effort to take an east coast\r\nisland, came an unexpected bonus in the form of a defector. Brigadier\r\nGeneral Lee Il, NKPA, came ashore on 21 February at Tae-do “in a stolen\r\nsampan with a briefcase full of top secret papers, a head full of top\r\nsecret plans, and a strong desire to make himself useful.”[75] He was\r\nrushed immediately to Eighth Army intelligence officers.\r\n\r\n     [73] CinPac Weekly Intel Digest No. 23-52, dtd 6 Jun 52,\r\n          included as App. 17 to _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, p. 9-110.\r\n\r\n     [74] First Lieutenant Joseph S. Bartos, Jr., a former\r\n          All-American football great, also distinguished himself\r\n          during the Yang-do action. His cool, resourceful, and\r\n          valiant leadership during the two-day defense earned him\r\n          the Silver Star Medal. BGen Frank M. Reinecke comments on\r\n          draft MS, dtd 25 Aug 66.\r\n\r\n     [75] Field, _NavOps, Korea_, p. 426.\r\n\r\nThe next day command personnel of the west coast TE 95.15 were treated\r\nto a surprise, though not so pleasant as the unforeseen defection of\r\nthe NKPA general. Rear Admiral George C. Dyer, Commander Task Force\r\n(CTF) 95, and his staff were engaged in an inspection of the WCIDE\r\nislands. While the party was looking over the antiaircraft defenses at\r\nPaengyong-do:\r\n\r\n  ... an aircraft of VMA-312 made a pass at the CP, followed\r\n  closely by a second plane. The second aircraft made a message\r\n  drop and accidentally released a 500-pound bomb, which landed\r\n  from 75–100 feet west of the CP, shattering all windows and\r\n  blowing all the doors off their hinges. Personnel harbored\r\n  within the CP were thrown to the floor by the concussion, a\r\n  few sustaining minor cuts and bruises, but no fatalities were\r\n  incurred.... Commanding Officer, USS _Bairoko_ [the carrier to\r\n  which VMA-312 was assigned], sent a note of apology to CTE 95.15\r\n  and later followed up with material to repair the CP.[76]\r\n\r\n     [76] CTE 95.15 ComdD, 1 Feb-31 May 52, p. 8.\r\n\r\nIn March, CTG 95.1 directed the occupation of Ho-do, barely more than\r\na speck of dirt 4,000 yards south of Sok-to and within 400 yards\r\nof the Communist mainland. Despite Colonel Davenport’s objection\r\nthat the proposed action was beyond the defensive mission of his\r\ncommand and that the proximity of Ho-do to the enemy shore made the\r\nisland untenable,[77] the task group commander would not rescind the\r\ndirective. After a detailed reconnaissance by First Lieutenant Wallace\r\nE. Jobusch, Colonel Davenport ordered a reinforced Korean Marine Corps\r\nplatoon to occupy the island. This order was carried out, but during\r\nthe night of 25–26 March the platoon lost its newly gained objective to\r\na well-coordinated enemy amphibious attack. Not a single Korean Marine\r\nsurvivor could be accounted for at daylight. On 2 April, however,\r\nafter the enemy force had departed Ho-do, six of the platoon turned\r\nup on Sok-to. They had survived by hiding out at Ho-do. None of the\r\nothers were ever seen again. After the island was overrun, it was not\r\nreoccupied by Allied forces.\r\n\r\n     [77] Colonel Davenport later pointed out that the enemy\r\n          could easily employ high-powered rifles against Ho-do\r\n          occupants, that resupply posed problems to his command,\r\n          and that at times the enemy could even walk to Ho-do\r\n          over the winter ice.

Davenport ltr to Hd,\r\n          HistBr, G-3 Div, HQMC, dtd 7 Sep 66.\r\n\r\nAfter this latest offensive action in the west, the Communists\r\nmade no further attempts to seize any of the islands. U.S. and ROK\r\nMarines enjoyed a period of relative freedom from enemy harassment,\r\nexcept for frequent shore battery shelling directed against the east\r\ncoast islands. For WCIDE command members the quiet island duty was\r\ninterrupted only occasionally by hostile artillery fire although rumors\r\nof imminent enemy landings abounded. On 13 October, however, the enemy\r\nbombed Cho-do in the first air attack made against an island garrison\r\nsince the U.S. Marines had been assigned the west coast island command\r\nresponsibility. No casualties resulted from this raid. The lull in\r\nenemy activity that then ensued enabled island personnel to devote\r\nincreased efforts towards improvement of their defenses.\r\n\r\nMarines instructed, drilled, and conducted tactical exercises for\r\nthe island forces. Island commanders supervised the construction and\r\nimprovement of gun pits and other defense installations. At the ECIDE\r\ncommand island, Yo-do, a 2,700-foot airstrip (Briscoe Field) for\r\nemergency landings and intelligence flights had been completed by June.\r\nSince much of the labor was performed by Koreans, the language barrier\r\nsometimes created difficulties. In all these activities the Marines\r\nfound that they were hampered but not unduly burdened by this problem.\r\n\r\nOne condition, however, did handicap operations of the island Marines.\r\nThis was the supply situation which was prevented from becoming\r\ndesperate only because the Marines were able to borrow and obtain\r\nnecessities from other service activities. The inability of the island\r\nMarines to draw needed supplies from the responsible U.S. Army agency\r\ndeveloped as a result of the slowness of the Marines in approving the\r\ntask element tables of equipment (T/E),[78] and from insistence of\r\nthe supplying activity that it would deal only with those units that\r\nhad approved tables of equipment. The urgency of the situation was\r\nalleviated in May when weekly supply flights were begun by the 1st MAW.\r\nEven when surface ships did arrive with provisions, Marines frequently\r\ndiscovered that items which had been invoiced were missing.[79]\r\nConsumables, especially, had a high rate of disappearance.\r\n\r\n     [78] A T/E is a listing of equipment that a unit needs to\r\n          accomplish its mission. Tables vary according to type of\r\n          unit and its mission.\r\n\r\n     [79] Commenting on logistical matters, Colonel Kenneth A.\r\n          King, who during 1952 commanded first the WCIDE and then\r\n          1st CSG, was of the opinion that the main difficulty\r\n          lay “not in getting requisitions filled, but in getting\r\n          delivery of what was approved” due to the fact Marines\r\n          were not assigned to processing of requisitions and\r\n          delivery of supplies. He had high praise for the concern\r\n          and assistance of 1st MAW units as well as Captain G. L.\r\n          G. Evans (RN) of HMS _Ocean_ and various other United\r\n          Kingdom ship captains. Colonel King further commented\r\n          that “for the benefit of Marines who may have to serve\r\n          in isolated areas, and I imagine this often prevails in\r\n          Vietnam today, it cannot be emphasized too strongly that\r\n          the Marine Corps should be very reluctant to leave the\r\n          support of any of its elements, no matter how small, to\r\n          other services or nationalities.” Col Kenneth A.

When planes were allotted for\r\nclose support, both their customary late arrival over the target\r\narea and pilot inefficiency left Marine ground commanders less than\r\nsatisfied.[81] The particular concern of General Jerome, the new\r\n1st MAW commander, was the continuing limited opportunity for his\r\nMarines to execute their normal primary mission--close air support of\r\nfrontline troops. Although FAF assigned Marine pilots to support the\r\n1st Marine Division whenever possible, the infrequent number of close\r\nair support missions performed under the existing sortie limit was\r\nbeginning to detract from the quality of delivery. General Jerome set\r\nout to remedy this unfavorable situation.\r\n\r\n     [81] 1st MAW ComdD, Feb 52, quoted in _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4,\r\n          p. 10-45.\r\n\r\nWorking with General Selden, the Marine wing commander prevailed upon\r\nthe Air Force to permit close air support training of wing pilots and\r\nof forward air controllers with the Marine division. On 19 May, CG,\r\nFAF lifted the close air support restriction that he had imposed in\r\nfront of General Selden’s MLR. By agreement between the FAF and the\r\ntwo Marine commanders, Fifth Air Force would permit the scheduling of\r\n12 close air support sorties daily for a one-month period, MAG-12 was\r\ngiven this training mission, to begin on 21 May.[82]\r\n\r\n     [82] Two months earlier, FAF had begun “a program for training\r\n          pilots in close air support techniques.... Initially,\r\n          all training missions for this division were flown by\r\n          Air Force aircraft.” The flights, not in response to\r\n          specific requests, were assigned by the G-3, I Corps.

These flights ceased just before the ones\r\n          from MAG-12 began. 1st MarDiv ComdD, May 53, p. 4. A 1st\r\n          MarDiv staff officer, who had observed the frequency of\r\n          General Jerome’s visits to the division CP to discuss the\r\n          new close air support training program, has credited the\r\n          two Marine CGs for their “great amount of coordinated\r\n          personal aggressiveness in bringing this about.” Col\r\n          Robert A. McGill comments on draft MS, Sep 66, hereafter\r\n          _McGill comments_.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the CAS program, in addition to providing operational\r\ntraining and practice for Marine ground officers, air controllers,\r\nand pilots, was to inflict maximum casualties on Chinese troops and\r\nto increase the destruction and damage to their positions. Before\r\nassigning a pilot to the actual training flights, MAG-12 sent him\r\non a tour of the front lines to become better familiarized with the\r\ntopography, the restricted (“no-fly”) areas, and probable enemy\r\ntargets. Air strikes requested by the division went directly to MAG-12.\r\nInitially, a limitation of 12 sorties per day was established, but on\r\n17 July--the program having already been extended beyond its original\r\n30-day limit--a new ceiling of 20 daily sorties went into effect. The\r\ndivision was also allowed additional flights above this prescribed\r\ndaily sortie number when air support was needed to repel a large-scale\r\nenemy attack or to assist in a major Marine ground assault.\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as the Marines began to derive the benefit of the\r\ntraining program, the flights were terminated by FAF. On 3 August\r\n1952, following a complaint by CG, Eighth Army that Marines were\r\ngetting a disproportionate share of the close air support sorties,\r\nthe Fifth Air Force notified General Jerome that the special program\r\nwould end the next day. General Selden was instructed to request air\r\nsupport “in the same manner as other divisions on the Army front.”[83]\r\nDespite the abrupt termination of the training program, the division\r\nhad derived substantial benefits from the 12 weeks of Marine-type close\r\nair support. “Air attacks were the most useful weapon for dealing with\r\nenemy dug-in on the reverse slopes,”[84] according to an official\r\nanalysis. One regimental commander reported that the 1,000-pound\r\nbombs were effective in destroying enemy bunkers and further noted\r\nthat the strikes had produced good results in the “destruction or\r\ndamaging of enemy artillery and mortar pieces.”[85] Another senior\r\nofficer commented that air overhead kept the Communists “buttoned up,”\r\nwhich permitted Marines greater freedom of movement for tactical and\r\nlogistical operations.[86]\r\n\r\n     [83] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, p. 8-54.\r\n\r\n     [84] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, p. 9-36.\r\n\r\n     [85] 1st MarDiv ComdD, Jun 52, p. 2.\r\n\r\n     [86] Col Russell E.

This was\r\ncontrolled radar bombing, which permitted delivery of aviation ordnance\r\nat night or under other conditions of limited or poor visibility. The\r\nAir Force had introduced the concept into Korea in January 1951, had\r\ntested and evaluated it in combat, and shortly thereafter had put it\r\nto good use against the Communist spring offensives that year. Based\r\non a concept oriented towards deep support of troops in extended land\r\ncampaigns, the Air Force system made use of 20-ton vans to house its\r\nground components.[87]\r\n\r\n     [87] As an Air Force spokesman noted, “... the AN/MPQ-2 radars\r\n          introduced into Korea in January 1951 were Strategic Air\r\n          Command bomb scoring radars and not tactical equipment.\r\n          This would explain the large vans.” Robert C. Futrell,\r\n          Historian, Hist Studies Br USAF Hist Div, comments\r\n          on draft MS, dtd 12 Oct 66. Dr. Futrell authored the\r\n          definitive unclassified history of Air Force operations\r\n          in Korea, previously cited as _USAF, Korea_.\r\n\r\nThe Marine equipment, on the other hand, was more mobile since it was\r\nto be employed close to friendly lines. Referred to as the MPQ-14,[88]\r\nthe Marine radar bombing system was designed so that the largest\r\npiece could be put into a one-ton trailer. Major ground items were a\r\ngenerator power supply, a tracking radar, and a computer; the last\r\nessential component, an automatic bombing control, was mounted in the\r\naircraft.\r\n\r\n     [88] These letters indicate first, the type of installation;\r\n          next, the kind of electronic equipment; and finally, its\r\n          purpose. In this case, M-mobile ground installation,\r\n          P-radar, and Q-intended for a combination of purposes.\r\n          The figure indicates the model number in the\r\n          developmental history of the equipment.\r\n\r\nDeveloped and hand built after World War II by Marines under Major\r\nMarion C. Dalby at the Naval Air Materiel Test Center, Point Mugu,\r\nCalifornia, the MPQ-14 was first used in Korea in September 1951.\r\nInitially, considerable mechanical difficulty was experienced with\r\nradar bombing, which affected the accuracy of the bombs, but later the\r\nsystem became sufficiently reliable to permit bomb drops within one\r\nmile of friendly lines. Subsequent use confirmed the tactical precision\r\nof the MPQ-14. By the middle of summer 1952, the Marines had obtained\r\nFifth Air Force permission to use radar bombing, controlled by a\r\nforward observer on the ground, in a close support role.\r\n\r\nBefore this policy change took place another one, at a still higher\r\ncommand level, had occurred. On 23 June, FAF planes struck at eight\r\nNorth Korean hydroelectric plants in the central and northwestern part\r\nof the country. The attack represented a departure from the intense\r\ninterdiction of enemy lines of communication (Operation STRANGLE)\r\nwhich, since May 1951, had characterized FAF support operations. The\r\nshift came about after a Far East Air Forces study on the effectiveness\r\nof the interdiction campaign had concluded, in part, that the program\r\nhad been indecisive.[89]\r\n\r\n     [89] HistDiv; Air Univ, USAF, _United States Air Force\r\n          Operations in the Korean Conflict, 1 November 1950–30\r\n          June 1952_, USAF Hist Study No. 72 (Washington, 1955),\r\n          p. 159, hereafter USAF, _Ops in Korea_, with appropriate\r\n          number. The Air Force operations were published in three\r\n          books, numbered 72, 73, and 127.\r\n\r\nFor more than a year preceding the 23 June attack, the Fifth Air Force\r\nhad concentrated its ground support efforts on the disruption of\r\nCommunist communication lines so that the enemy would be unable “to\r\ncontain a determined offensive ... or to mount a sustained offensive\r\nhimself.”[90] During the lifetime of the doctrine, no major offensive\r\nhad been launched by the enemy, and on this fact was based the claim\r\nfor success of the interdiction program. Opponents, however, pointed\r\nout that despite this maximum FAF air effort, the Communists had built\r\nup their strength, including support areas immediately to the rear\r\nof their front lines and resupply installations. As the recent UN\r\ncommander, General Matthew B. Ridgway,[91] told members of the Senate\r\nCommittee on Armed Services on 21 May 1952, the same month that FAF had\r\nbegun to shift its air effort away from interdiction, “I think that the\r\nhostile forces opposing the Eighth Army ... have a substantially greater\r\noffensive potential than at any time in the past....”[92]\r\n\r\n     [90] Futrell, _USAF, Korea_, pp. 435–436.\r\n\r\n     [91] General Mark W. Clark had succeeded Ridgway as UN\r\n          Commander on 12 May 1952. Ridgway was to take over as the\r\n          new Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, 1 June, replacing\r\n          General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was\r\n          returning to the United States.\r\n\r\n     [92] Cited in Futrell, _USAF, Korea_, p. 435.\r\n\r\nA number of factors contributed to the reduced emphasis on the\r\ninterdiction strategy. Three, however, appear to have most influenced\r\nthe inauguration of Operation PRESSURE, the name given the new policy\r\nof concentrating aerial attacks on major industrial targets considered\r\nof greatest value to the North Korean economy. Mounting FAF aircraft\r\nlosses due to enemy flak (fire from ground-based antiaircraft weapons)\r\nand an insufficient number of replacements helped shape the new\r\nprogram. By April 1952 FEAF had received “only 131 replacement aircraft\r\nof the types engaged in rail interdiction against the 243 it had lost\r\nand the 290 major-damaged aircraft on interdiction sorties.”[93] These\r\nheavy losses had resulted from the increasing accuracy of Communist\r\nantiaircraft ground weapons, a capability Air Force planners had failed\r\nto consider sufficiently.[94]\r\n\r\n     [93] USAF, _Ops in Korea_, No. 72, p. 156.\r\n\r\n     [94] Futrell, _USAF, Korea_, pp. 436–437.\r\n\r\nAlthough significant, this loss factor was not the final consideration\r\nin executing PRESSURE attacks against the power plants. More directly\r\nresponsible were two other recent developments. These were the decision\r\nof the new UN commander, General Mark W. Clark, to take forceful\r\naction to bring the Communists around to an armistice agreement and a\r\ntop-level Defense Department change of policy that had removed a major\r\nNorth Korean hydroelectric facility from the restricted bombing list.\r\nThis was the Suiho plant, fourth largest in the world. Adjacent to\r\nthe Yalu River, about 75 miles northeast of its mouth, Suiho supplied\r\napproximately 25 percent of the electrical power used in nearby\r\nnortheast China.[95]\r\n\r\n     [95] _Ibid._, pp. 452–453 and Cagle and Manson, _Sea War,\r\n          Korea_, pp. 443–445.\r\n\r\nResults of the PRESSURE strikes, carried on from 23–27 June, were\r\nhighly successful. Marine, Navy, and Air Force planes flew 1,654 attack\r\nand escort sorties in these raids. Of the 13 target plants attacked\r\nduring this period, 11 were put out of commission and 2 others were\r\npresumably destroyed. North Korea was almost blacked out for two weeks.\r\nChinese and Russian experts were rushed to North Korea to lend a hand\r\nin restoration. The hydroelectric strikes marked the first time that\r\nMarine, Navy, and Air Force pilots had flown a combined mission in\r\nKorea. The 23 June strike, moreover, was of particular significance\r\nto 1st MAW since it was also the first time that MAGs-12 and -33 were\r\nassigned group strikes at specific adjacent targets at the same time.\r\n\r\nLed by Colonel Robert E. Galer, the new MAG-12 commander since 25 May,\r\ngroup pilots struck and leveled the single power complex, Chosin 3, in\r\nthe 23–24 June runs. Colonel John P. Condon, who had taken over MAG-33\r\non 24 May, put 43 jets from VMFs-311 and -115 into the air during the\r\ntwo-day mission. The first time that its F9Fs had ever been massed for\r\na strike of this type, the MAG-33 jets similarly destroyed the Chosin 4\r\nplant, 11 miles northwest of Hamhung.\r\n\r\nAlthough the jets carried a smaller payload than the Corsairs and ADs\r\nof MAG-12 (approximately 37 gross tons to more than 150 tons), the\r\nextremely precise bombing record made by the Grumman Panther jet pilots\r\nforever put to rest the doubts about jet accuracy that had been held by\r\nsome in 1st MAW. As the group commander later recalled, “The capability\r\nof jet strike aircraft for extremely accurate bombing, an item of\r\nopen discussion prior to this time, was never questioned in the 1st\r\nMarine Aircraft Wing after this mission.”[96] Another gratifying result\r\nwas that flight personnel on all of the 150 Marine aircraft returned\r\nsafely. In fact, of the total 1,645 FAF sorties, only 2 aircraft were\r\ndowned; rescue aircraft successfully picked up these two pilots, both\r\nU.S. Navy officers.\r\n\r\n     [96] MajGen John P. Condon ltr to Hd, HistBr, G-3 Div, HQMC,\r\n          dtd 1 Oct 66.\r\n\r\nIt was the high probability of being rescued, if forced to abandon\r\ntheir aircraft, that not only eased the minds of pilots on missions\r\nnorth of the 38th Parallel but also permitted the fliers a greater\r\ndegree of success. As the MAG-12 commander, Colonel Galer, who was\r\nshortly to escape imminent capture by the enemy, later declared, “I do\r\nknow that every pilot flying in this theatre should have the highest\r\npossible morale with the knowledge that so many are ready and willing\r\nto risk so much to get them.”[97]\r\n\r\n     [97] MAG-12 ComdD, Aug 52, p. D-4.\r\n\r\nA Medal of Honor holder from World War II, Colonel Galer was leading\r\na flight of 31 aircraft on 5 August. His objective was the supply area\r\nand tungsten mines in the mountainous northeastern part of North Korea,\r\njust below the 39th Parallel and 35 miles southwest of Wonsan. After\r\nseveral hits had killed his engine, the MAG-12 commander, preparing\r\nto parachute, climbed out over the side of his plane, but found that\r\nhe had one foot stuck inside the cockpit, probably on the shoulder\r\nstraps or the loop of the belt. He then pulled himself partially back\r\ntowards the cockpit, freed his foot with a vigorous kick, cleared the\r\nplane, and headed in spread-eagle fashion towards the ground. Almost\r\nimmediately the plane, falling in a nose dive, caught the descending\r\npilot on the shoulder and pulled him into a spin. Colonel Galer\r\nrecovered in time, however, to pull the ripcord and thus ease his\r\nimpact onto enemy terrain. He landed within ten feet of his crashed\r\nAU.[98]\r\n\r\n     [98] The AU is the attack version of the Marines’ famed World\r\n          War II fighter, the F4U Corsair.\r\n\r\n“Immediately upon getting free of the chute, I ran as rapidly as\r\npossible, staying low, down through a corn field.”[99] At the end of\r\nthe field, the Marine aviator paused momentarily to survey the terrain\r\nfor an escape route. Spotting a dry stream bed nearby, Colonel Galer\r\ndashed toward it and quickly but cautiously moved up it some 100\r\nyards. Then he halted to put into operation a small survivor radio to\r\nreport his position. The message was received by the rescue air patrol\r\norbiting overhead which relayed the information to pickup aircraft. The\r\npatrol advised the downed pilot that a rescue helicopter had already\r\ndeparted for the crash area.\r\n\r\n     [99] MAG-12, ComdD, Aug 52, p. D-2.\r\n\r\nBefore breaking radio contact, Colonel Galer told the air patrol his\r\nplanned movements in order to facilitate pickup. He then quickly left\r\nthe area which was located too near the crashed aircraft for a rescue\r\nattempt. Evading detection by enemy soldiers and curious teenagers\r\nmoving towards the wreckage, the Marine worked his way to higher\r\nground, keeping the air patrol advised of his changing position. By\r\n1845, a search of the area was underway. Of the events that followed:\r\nColonel Galer wrote:\r\n\r\n  At 1908 I heard the helicopter go down the next valley and saw it\r\n  disappear. I called, told them to make a 180-degree turn since\r\n  I was in the valley to the southwest and on the north slope. I\r\n  did not get an answer but soon the helicopter came through a\r\n  saddle in the ridge.... I immediately let the red smoke (day\r\n  flare) go, and came out of the bushes ... calling the helicopter\r\n  on the radio also. They apparently saw me immediately and came\r\n  over and hovered. The mechanic leaned out and swung the hoisting\r\n  sling back and forth.... Finally, I grabbed it and got in ... and\r\n  the pilot took off.... The mechanic pulled me up and into the\r\n  helicopter as we crossed the valley.[100]\r\n\r\n    [100] _Ibid._, p. D-3.\r\n\r\nThe colonel was not yet out of the woods. The trip to a rescue ship at\r\nWonsan was marked by intermittent bursts of enemy antiaircraft fire.\r\nOn one occasion the chopper was hit hard enough to spin it completely\r\naround. As the rescue craft neared the coast patches of fog added\r\nto the hazards of night flying. About this time the warning light\r\nindicating low fuel supply came on but “the pilot gambled on making the\r\nsea at the risk of having to autorotate through the overcast into the\r\nmountains.”[101] It was a correct decision. The fuel lasted until the\r\nhelicopter landed on the rescue vessel. It was then 2100.\r\n\r\n    [101] _Ibid._, p. D-4.\r\n\r\nQuite naturally the episode brought forth high praise for the\r\nrescue system, and particularly for those individuals whose skills,\r\ninitiative, and courage made downed crew rescues of this type possible.\r\nBut Colonel Galer also saw some weaknesses. He pointed out that rescue\r\nhelicopter pilots should be kept up to date on changing enemy flak\r\npositions. The Marine group commander also stressed the need for rescue\r\nhelicopters to establish and maintain a minimum safe fuel level which\r\nwould depend largely upon the position of the downed aircraft. One\r\nfinal suggestion, not about the system but the aircraft itself, was\r\nthat fixed-wing aircraft have ejection-type seats. Remembering his\r\nown difficulties, the MAG-12 commander further cautioned pilots to be\r\ncertain they were free of all straps and cords before bailing out.\r\n\r\nIn addition to attack missions by tactical aircraft and rescue work by\r\nits helicopters, the Marine wing was also responsible for providing\r\nantiaircraft defense. It was not until July 1951, 13 months after\r\nthe NKPA invasion of South Korea, that a formal air defense had been\r\nestablished for the country. Fifth Air Force was given the command\r\nresponsibility of coordinating the aerial defense net for South Korea\r\nand its adjacent sea frontiers. In mid-November 1951, the FAF commander\r\nhad revised the defensive system, dividing his area into a northern\r\nand southern sector, at a point exactly halfway between the 36th and\r\n37th Parallels.\r\n\r\nFAF commanded the northern air defense sector while the southern sector\r\nbecame the responsibility of CG, 1st MAW. In turn, these two sectors\r\nwere further divided into subsectors. Each of these, through a tactical\r\nair direction center (TADC), maintained radar surveillance of its\r\nassigned area and performed plotting and identification functions. Each\r\nsubsector was charged with being “directly responsible for sector air\r\ndefense.”[102]\r\n\r\n    [102] Futrell, _USAF, Korea_, p. 616.\r\n\r\nAlthough the 1st MAW commander had been designated as the Air Defense\r\nCommander, Southern Sector, Korea, he was not actually given the means\r\nto carry out this responsibility. He still did not have command over\r\nhis tactical squadrons, nor could he exercise control over operations\r\nof his tactical air coordination center (TACC) or TADC.[103] Moreover,\r\nhis southern sector could not originate practice air warning messages.\r\nThe wing commander had to obtain permission from JOC before he could\r\nbegin practice intercepts for training his radar intercept controllers.\r\n\r\n    [103] TACC is the senior agency for controlling all tactical\r\n          aircraft and air warning functions; the TADC performs\r\n          similar functions in an area controlled by the TACC. JCS,\r\n          _Dictionary of United States Military Terms for Joint\r\n          Usage_ (Short title: JD). JCS Pub. 1 (Washington, 1964),\r\n          p. 141, hereafter _JCS, JD_.\r\n\r\nSeveral other deficiencies existed in the air defense system that\r\nthe 1st Marine Aircraft Wing had inherited. There were no ground\r\nantiaircraft weapons at the Marine fields until a .50 caliber automatic\r\nweapons battery was detached from the 1st 90mm Antiaircraft Artillery\r\nBattalion, FMF, early in 1952 and sent to K-3, the home field of\r\nMAG-33. Other inadequacies were deficient equipment--a search radar\r\nlimited to 30 miles out and 20,000 feet up--and lack of an interceptor\r\naircraft capable of rising to meet the faster swept-wing jets the\r\nenemy was employing. Airfields housing Marine air groups did not have\r\nrevetments for either aircraft parking areas or ordnance dumps.\r\n\r\nNot all of these weaknesses were acquired with assumption of the air\r\ndefense mission. There had been a general lack of concern about air\r\ndefense throughout South Korea. This attitude had resulted from the air\r\nsupremacy which the Fifth Air Force had quickly established. Camouflage\r\nwas seldom practiced. Dispersal of aircraft, supply dumps, and\r\nservicing facilities was employed only rarely. In fact, at K-6, there\r\nwas not sufficient land to properly scatter installations and aircraft.\r\n\r\nDefense of the southern sector was commanded from K-3 (Pohang),\r\nthe site of the TACC (Major Fred A. Steel). Marine Ground Control\r\nIntercept Squadron 1 (MGCIS-1) was set up on the west coast at K-8 and\r\nMGCIS-3 (Lieutenant Colonel Owen M. Hines), on the east coast, near\r\nPohang. Each of these intercept units had an early warning detachment\r\noperating off the mainland. Antiaircraft artillery was provided by the\r\n90mm AAA battalion, which was controlled, however, by EUSAK. The 1st\r\nMAW commander specified a ready alert status for two aircraft during\r\ndaylight hours. Just before sunrise and sunset, four planes were put on\r\nstrip alert. Aircraft for night alert were provided by VMF(N)-513 until\r\nApril, when the requirement was withdrawn. By 30 June 1952, 1st MAW\r\nair defense operations had destroyed a total of five enemy planes. The\r\nF7F night fighters flown by VMF(N)-513, moreover, had frequently been\r\nscrambled to intercept hostile night intruders that had penetrated into\r\nthe Seoul area, or northern sector.\r\n\r\nThis low kill rate did little to atone for the steadily increasing\r\nnumber of Marine aircraft lost to enemy flak. Although the number\r\nof friendly planes destroyed or damaged in air-to-air combat during\r\nthe latter half of Korean hostilities diminished sharply compared to\r\nthe early period, losses due to ground fire were reaching alarming\r\nproportions in early and mid-1952. In May 1952 Navy and Marine air\r\nlosses to enemy action were twice the total for April, and the June\r\nfigure was even higher. By June, the Communists had massed more than\r\nhalf of their antiaircraft artillery along communication routes that\r\nFAF struck nearly every day.\r\n\r\nRemedial action was soon taken. Stress on flak evasion was emphasized\r\nin pilot briefings and debriefings. The MAG-33 intelligence section\r\ncame up with a program that attempted to reduce losses by a detailed\r\nanalysis of flak information. The originator of this system, First\r\nLieutenant Kenneth S. Foley, based his method on:\r\n\r\n  ... photo interpretation of an up-to-date flak map, scale\r\n  1:50,000, and an intelligent utilization of flak reports\r\n  disseminated by the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron of the\r\n  5th Air Force. Frequent briefings were given to each squadron\r\n  on the enemy AA capabilities. Elaborate overlays were drawn up\r\n  and displayed. Target maps, clearly showing AA positions and\r\n  flak clocks [danger areas], were given to flight leaders to aid\r\n  them in evading known AA guns in their target area. Through flak\r\n  analysis, the safest route to the target area was determined\r\n  and an actual attack and retirement route was suggested. These\r\n  recommendations appeared in a flak summary presented at each\r\n  combat briefing.[104]\r\n\r\n    [104] VMF(N)-513 ComdD, Jun 52, App II, p. 5. Mention of a flak\r\n          analysis program first appeared in the March 1952 records\r\n          of MAG-33. Aircraft losses on interdiction strikes (the\r\n          program was not applicable to CAS missions) dropped\r\n          for the next several months. When Lieutenant Foley\r\n          transferred to the night squadron, he took his system\r\n          with him and had it put into operation there. LtCol\r\n          Kenneth S. Foley interv by HistBr, G-3 Div, HQMC, dtd 24\r\n          Mar 66.\r\n\r\nOther measures attempted to reduce mounting losses of personnel\r\nand aircraft. In all Marine air units, evasion and escape tactics\r\nwere stressed. In addition to the FAF de-emphasis on interdiction\r\nof communication routes that had come about, in part, due to heavy\r\naircraft losses, Fifth Air Force decreed that beginning 3 June, “with\r\nthe exception of the AD and F4U aircraft [1st MAW types] only one run\r\nwill be made for each type of external ordnance carried and no strafing\r\nruns will be made.”[105] CTF 77 ordered that in all attack runs,\r\naircraft would pull out by the 3,000-foot altitude level. The Marines,\r\ncombining their air and ground efforts, came up with a positive program\r\nof their own. It was to become the first known instance of Marine\r\nground in support of Marine air.\r\n\r\n    [105] FAF CbtOps Notam No. 6-10.1 cited in App. 9, _PacFlt\r\n          EvalRpt_ No. 4, Chap. 10, p. 10-199.\r\n\r\nAlthough the originator of the idea cannot be positively identified,\r\nthe time that artillery flak suppression firing was first employed\r\ncan be traced back to late 1951, when the division was still in East\r\nKorea.[106] It was not until June 1952, however, that a published\r\nprocedure for conducting flak suppression firing appeared in Marine\r\ndivision records. That same month another type of flak suppression,\r\nthis by an aircraft, was utilized by the 1st Marines, commanded at the\r\ntime by Colonel Walter N. Flournoy. The procedure called for the FAC\r\n[forward air controller] to relay gun positions to friendly strike\r\nplanes which temporarily diverted their attack to silence the located\r\ngun. Although the method “worked with good results,”[107] it was not\r\ndestined to become the system adopted by the Marines.\r\n\r\n    [106] _Paid comments_; _Nihart comments_. Both of these\r\n          officers, the former artillery, the latter infantry,\r\n          recall flak suppression firing late in 1951 or early in\r\n          1952 when the division was on the eastern front. Colonel\r\n          Nihart pointed out, in addition, that “such expedients\r\n          and new tactics went on for some time before getting into\r\n          the regimental commander’s reports.”\r\n\r\n    [107] 1stMar ComdD, Jun 52, p. 2.\r\n\r\nThe more frequently used flak suppression called for artillery to fire\r\non hostile gun positions that could impede the success of a friendly\r\nclose air support strike. Several Marine officers appear to have had\r\na major role in the development and employment of this technique.\r\nAmong them were Brigadier General Frank H. Lamson-Scribner, Assistant\r\nCommanding General, 1st MAW; Colonel Henderson, the 11th Marines\r\ncommander; and Lieutenant Colonel Gerald T. Armitage, 3/1 commander.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Marines battalion commander explained how the system operated\r\nin late spring 1952:\r\n\r\n  I was in an outpost watching an air strike. I asked Captain\r\n  Shoden [John C., the battalion forward air controller] to work\r\n  out some idea of flak suppression. Shoden, G-2, and others worked\r\n  two or three weeks to complete the first plot of antiaircraft\r\n  positions. My idea was to have a plane start a run and then pull\r\n  up before finishing the dive. The enemy antiaircraft gunners\r\n  could not tell that the pilot was pulling out at an extremely\r\n  high level. The batteries would fire and Marine observers would\r\n  plot their positions from their fires. Then, the Marine artillery\r\n  would lay a heavy barrage on these positions.[108]\r\n\r\n    [108] LtCol Gerald T. Armitage interv by HistBr, G-3 Div, HQMC,\r\n          dtd 15 Aug 61.\r\n\r\nWhile observing an air strike from the Marine division sector,\r\nGeneral Lamson-Scribner noted that prior to the strike there had been\r\nno preparatory firing on enemy antiaircraft artillery positions.\r\nAfter the strike he discussed this matter with General Selden, who\r\n“directed me to discuss with his chief of staff what I had observed\r\nand my suggestions that division firepower for ‘flak suppression’ be\r\ncoordinated with air strikes.”[109] The upshot of this was that the\r\ndivision chief of staff suggested that the 11th Marines regimental\r\ncommander and his staff members develop an SOP[110] for using artillery\r\nflak suppression fires in support of close air support strikes. It was\r\nbelieved that proper utilization of these fires would reduce aircraft\r\nlosses and further increase the opportunity for a successful close air\r\nsupport mission by destruction of enemy antiaircraft weapons.[111]\r\n\r\n    [109] MajGen Frank H. Lamson-Scribner ltr to Hd, HistBr, G-3\r\n          Div, HQMC, dtd 12 Oct 66.\r\n\r\n    [110] An SOP, standing operating procedure, is a set of\r\n          instructions for conducting operations that lend\r\n          themselves to established procedures. _JCS, JD_, p. 133.\r\n\r\n    [111] With respect to the effect of enemy fire on attack\r\n          aircraft, the CO, MAG-33 later commented that\r\n          “Antiaircraft artillery has a direct deterioration effect\r\n          on pilot accuracy, particularly with regard to care in\r\n          getting on target and doing a precise job.” CO, MAG-33\r\n          ltr to CG, 1st MAW, dtd 25 Jul 52, quoted in _PacFlt\r\n          EvalRpt_ No. 5, p. 9-76.\r\n\r\nOn 30 June 1952, the 11th Marines published the SOP. Since the\r\nobjective was to prevent enemy fire from interfering with friendly\r\nstrike planes, the key to the entire procedure was the precise\r\ncoordination of artillery fire with the delivery of aircraft ordnance.\r\nAs Colonel Henderson described the system:\r\n\r\n  When the infantry regiment received word of an air strike, the\r\n  air liaison officer plotted on the map ... the target of the\r\n  strike, the orbit point, the direction of approach, and the\r\n  altitude ... and direction of pullout. Then the artillery liaison\r\n  officer, by looking at the map, could determine which of the\r\n  Chinese positions could bring effective fire on the strike\r\n  aircraft. The artillery battalion had prearranged code names\r\n  and numbers for every antiaircraft position. All the artillery\r\n  liaison officer had to do was pick up the phone and tell the\r\n  F.D.C. [fire direction center] ‘flak suppression’ and read off\r\n  what targets he wanted covered.\r\n\r\n  These fires were then delivered on the request of a forward\r\n  observer who was with the forward air controller.... When there\r\n  was a forward air controller up in the front lines controlling\r\n  the strike, we would put a forward observer with him. When the\r\n  planes were ... ready to go, the F.O. [forward observer] got the\r\n  word ‘Batteries laid and loaded,’ and he would tell them to fire.\r\n  The minute the FO would get the word, ‘On the way,’ the forward\r\n  air controller would tell the planes to start their run. As a\r\n  result, we had cases where the planes were in their bombing run\r\n  within 30 seconds after the flak suppression was fired, which\r\n  meant that they were in on the target while the positions were\r\n  still neutralized. The question of control and split second\r\n  timing is of exceeding importance because the aircraft are going\r\n  300 to 400 miles an hour....[112]\r\n\r\n    [112] _Henderson ltr II._\r\n\r\nEarly in the program the MAG-12 commander reported that although the\r\nflak suppression procedure was not flawless, it was proving “very\r\ncapable and workable.”[113] An indication of the success of 1st Marine\r\nDivision pioneering efforts in flak suppression is seen in the fact\r\nthat shortly after it was put into operation “there was a steady stream\r\nof visitors to the 11th Marines CP to find out what [it was] and how\r\nwe were doing it and to get copies of our SOP.”[114] The procedure was\r\neventually adopted by other Eighth Army units.\r\n\r\n    [113] CO, MAG-12 Spdltr to CG, 1st MAW, dtd 2 Jul 52, Subj:\r\n          Comments on 11th Mar Flak Suppression SOP, cited in\r\n          _PacFlt EvalRpt_, No. 5, Chap. 9, p. 9-78.\r\n\r\n    [114] _Henderson ltr II._\r\n\r\nMarine air losses from hostile ground fire during CAS strikes\r\nimmediately began to drop from the June peak and never again reached\r\nthis level. In 124 close support sorties flown by 1st MAW on 13 August,\r\nnot one plane was shot down and only four received minor damage from\r\nenemy flak. Although there were some complaints as to execution of the\r\nflak suppression program these would be corrected, in the main, by a\r\nrevised procedure which the 11th Marines would undertake in the winter\r\nof 1952.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spring 1952 on_ JAMESTOWN[115]\r\n\r\n    [115] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpts_ No. 4, Chap. 9, No. 5,\r\n          Chap. 8; 1stMarDiv ComdDs, Apr-Jun 52; 5thMar ComdDs,\r\n          Apr-Jun 52; 7thMar ComdD, Jun 52; 11thMar ComdDs, Apr-May\r\n          52; 1/5 ComdD May 52; 1/7, 2/7 ComdDs, May 52.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the year the Marines had revised their estimate of enemy\r\ncapabilities after the lengthening of the division MLR by I Corps and\r\nthe subsequent heavy enemy attack. The re-evaluation placed the most\r\nlikely course of Chinese action as defending their present positions\r\nwith the 21 infantry battalions assigned and also cautioned that the\r\nCommunists could mount a limited objective attack at any time of their\r\nchoosing. Division intelligence estimated that the Chinese could muster\r\nup to “57 infantry battalions supported by 12 artillery battalions\r\nand 40 tanks and/or self-propelled guns” for a thrust into the Marine\r\nsector.[116]\r\n\r\n    [116] 1stMarDiv ComdD, Apr 52, p. 1.\r\n\r\nThe enemy, however, showed little disposition for any concerted ground\r\nattack during the remainder of April. But before the month ended,\r\nMarines, in conjunction with other I Corps divisions, had deluged the\r\nenemy with artillery and tank fire in Operation CLOBBER. The purpose of\r\nthis shoot was to inflict maximum casualties and damage by employment\r\nof the element of tactical surprise. The reinforced 11th Marines,\r\naugmented for this occasion by Company D, 1st Tank Battalion and nine\r\nof the battalion’s 105mm howitzer and flame tanks, blasted Chinese CPs,\r\nbivouac areas, artillery and mortar positions, and observation posts.\r\nMarine frontline regiments joined in with their organic mortars. Since\r\nmost of the firing took place at night when results were unobserved, no\r\nestimate could be made as to the effect of the operation on the enemy.\r\n\r\nA new Marine artillery tactic about this time was the\r\ncounter-counterbattery program instituted by the 11th Marines. The\r\nregiment had developed this technique to counter superior enemy\r\nartillery strength. This situation, as well as the fact that I Corps\r\nartillery available to the division was considered inadequate for\r\ncounterbattery support, led the Marine division to adopt the new\r\nprogram in May 1952. One provision required a battery in each battalion\r\nto select counter-counterbattery positions and occupy them for 24\r\nconsecutive hours each week. Another proviso of the program was the\r\nselection by each battalion of 10 roving gun positions that were to\r\nbe occupied by a single weapon rotated to each place at least once\r\nweekly. By these tactics, the artillery regiment hoped not only to\r\nmislead the Chinese in their estimate of the strength and location of\r\nMarine artillery but also to dilute enemy counterbattery intelligence\r\nby causing him to fire into areas just vacated by friendly guns. “The\r\neffectiveness of the program was demonstrated on numerous occasions\r\nwhen the enemy fired counterbattery into unoccupied positions.”[117] An\r\nadded advantage was that of providing deeper supporting fires on target\r\nareas.[118]\r\n\r\n    [117] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, p. 8-51.\r\n\r\n    [118] LtCol Bruce F. Hillam comments on draft MS, dtd 31 Aug 66.\r\n\r\nStill another concept regarding the employment of artillery developed\r\nduring the early days of the JAMESTOWN defense. The 11th Marines had\r\nadvised the infantry regiments that it could effectively fire on\r\nenemy troops attacking friendly positions if the Marines had overhead\r\ncover. The idea was to use variable time (VT) fuzes[119] with the\r\nstandard high explosive (HE) shells. Artillery battalions supporting\r\nthe frontline regiments registered on positions occupied frequently by\r\npatrols going forward from JAMESTOWN.\r\n\r\n    [119] A type of proximity fuze, the V.T. depends upon an\r\n          external source, such as an electronic signal, rather\r\n          than the force of ground impact, to detonate the shell at\r\n          a predetermined height over the target.\r\n\r\nAccording to the recollections of veteran artillery and infantrymen in\r\nthe division, the first occasion that pre-planned artillery fire was\r\nplaced on friendly positions occurred in May 1952.[120] The episode\r\ninvolved a 2/7 platoon patrol that late on 18 May was ordered to return\r\nto the MLR from an outpost on the former OPLR. Operating forward of the\r\ncenter regimental sector,[121] the platoon commander, Second Lieutenant\r\nTheodore H. Watson, directed that two of the three Marine squads return\r\nto the MLR. The remaining unit, surrounded by about 50 Chinese, engaged\r\nthem in a brisk fire fight.\r\n\r\n    [120] 1stMarDiv ComdD, May 52, p. 4.\r\n\r\n    [121] The 7th Marines advanced to the line to relieve the 5th\r\n          Marines in the center sector on 11 May.\r\n\r\nWhen the artillery fired to seal off the enemy and box-in the defensive\r\nposition failed to discourage the hostile force, Lieutenant Watson\r\nordered his men into the shelter of two nearby bunkers. He then\r\nrequested the artillery to place VT directly over his positions.[122]\r\nThe volleys of overhead fire and effective Marine small arms fire then\r\nforced the enemy to call off his assault. Although the exact number\r\nof Chinese casualties could not be determined, the new fire technique\r\nfully accomplished its purpose--repelling the enemy force.\r\n\r\n    [122] The artillery regiment had earlier developed the\r\n          “box-me-in” fires for outpost defense. If under heavy\r\n          attack the outpost could call for these pre-planned\r\n          close-in fires that completely surrounded the position.\r\n          In event of radio or wire communication failures, the\r\n          outpost could call for “box-me-in” or “Fire VT on my\r\n          position” by signal flare or other pyrotechnic device.\r\n          _Henderson ltr II._\r\n\r\nInitiating the infantry action in May was the 1st KMC Regiment, holding\r\nthe division left flank, with its 2d and 1st Battalions on line. At\r\ndusk on 3 May a platoon-size raiding party, under Second Lieutenant\r\nKim Young Ha, left an outpost forward of the 1st Battalion line on a\r\nprisoner-taking mission and headed for the objective, Hill 34, adjacent\r\nto the rail line to Kaesong and about a half-mile west of the Sachon\r\nRiver. When the platoon was within approximately 1,000 yards of its\r\ngoal, a support squad was detached near a trail and stream juncture to\r\nambush any enemy attempting to attack the raiders from the rear.[123]\r\nThe remainder of the platoon, two assault squads, then continued\r\ntowards the objective, moving cautiously and halting for an hour\r\nbecause of the bright moonlight.\r\n\r\n    [123] This support squad itself was later ambushed. The\r\n          heavy casualties it received prevented its further\r\n          participation in the raid. KMC Regt UnitRpt 53, dtd 4 May\r\n          52.\r\n\r\nAfter midnight the moon disappeared behind the clouds, and the Koreans\r\nagain emerged. They advanced towards a village immediately south of\r\nthe objective. After searching a few houses and not finding any enemy,\r\nthe KMCs started on the last leg to Hill 34. As soon as the objective\r\ncame into view the raiders deployed for the assault. At 0410 the two\r\nsquads of Korean Marines charged the knoll, immediately drawing heavy\r\nChinese small arms fire. When the raiders continued their assault, the\r\nenemy retreated to his trenchworks and bunkers where he continued to\r\nfire on the KMCs. Since it now appeared to the patrol leader that the\r\nprobability of taking a prisoner was unlikely, he prepared to return to\r\nfriendly lines. He first arranged for artillery to cover the withdrawal\r\nof the patrol, and then broke off the 18-minute fire fight, taking his\r\nonly casualty, a wounded rifleman, with him. The KMCs counted 12 enemy\r\ndead. No prisoners were taken. In the preliminary action, the support\r\nsquad had also suffered three killed and seven wounded.\r\n\r\nAs the KMC raiders were making their way back to the MLR, a combat\r\npatrol from 1/5, the reserve battalion of the 5th Marines, prepared\r\nto move out. This patrol was one of many dispatched by the battalion\r\nduring the first week of May in accordance with its mission of\r\npatrolling in front of the OPLR, between the MLR and the OPLR, and\r\nthroughout the regimental sector. On this occasion, the patrol was to\r\noccupy the high ground south of former Outpost 3, which had become the\r\nfocal point of activity in the center sector.[124] When used as a base\r\nof fire, this ground provided a position from which automatic weapons\r\ncould readily cover enemy lines or tie in with adjacent friendly\r\ndefenses. In addition, the 1/5 patrol was to drop off friendly snipers\r\nto cover the former OPLR position, to maintain surveillance, and to\r\nascertain to what extent the Chinese were developing the outpost. The\r\ntask went to a Company A platoon, which the unit commander, First\r\nLieutenant Ernest S. Lee, reinforced with light and heavy machine guns.\r\n\r\n    [124] This position, the site of the mid-April battle, along\r\n          with several others had been abandoned when the division\r\n          withdrew its OPLR late in April. Infantry regiments\r\n          dispatched frequent patrols in an attempt to discourage\r\n          the enemy’s incorporating the hill into his own OPLR.\r\n\r\nAt sunup the Marines crossed line JAMESTOWN and before 0900 had reached\r\nthe high ground they were to occupy. Here the patrol leader set up his\r\nbase of fire, then pushed on with the rest of his men to the outpost,\r\nreceiving occasional mortar fire before reaching the old position.\r\nWhile organizing his men at the objective, Lieutenant Lee received word\r\nby radio that the Chinese were preparing to attack. Almost immediately,\r\nintense shelling struck the forward slope of the hill. A Marine aerial\r\nobserver (AO) detected 60–70 Chinese advancing from the next hill, some\r\n800 yards to the front of the Marines. The AO also reported that the\r\nenemy was firing mortars towards OP 3.\r\n\r\nShortly thereafter the Chinese fire ceased. Moments before it lifted,\r\nthe patrol received a second warning that an enemy attack was imminent.\r\nEven as this message was being received, about 30 Chinese rushed the\r\npatrol. The Marines immediately took the hostile assault force under\r\nfire, killing 14 CCF with well-placed small arms fire. Overhead, four\r\n1947-vintage Marine Corsair fighters (F4U-4Bs) struck at troublesome\r\nmortar positions previously located by the AO. At 1330 another aerial\r\nstrike against Chinese mortars and enemy positions on the hill north of\r\nOP 3 was executed. These two air missions were credited with destroying\r\nsix mortars, damaging two others, and wrecking seven personnel bunkers.\r\nDuring the second strike the 1/5 patrol began its withdrawal.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions during the patrol’s return to its base the enemy\r\nattempted to ambush it. Each time the attempt was thwarted, once by the\r\npatrol itself and the second time, with the help of friendly artillery.\r\nOn the way back several loud explosions suddenly halted the patrol.\r\nInvestigation revealed that the Marines, carrying their casualties\r\nof one dead and four wounded, had inadvertently stumbled onto a path\r\nnot cleared of mines. Two members of the stretcher bearer detail were\r\nkilled and three others wounded by the AP (anti-personnel) mines that\r\nhad not been charted on friendly maps by the Marines’ predecessors in\r\nthe defense sector. A mine clearance team promptly disposed of the\r\ndanger. With the aid of fires from a 2/5 patrol on the nose of a nearby\r\nhill, the 1/5 platoon was able to break contact. After pulling back\r\nseveral hundred yards, the patrol reached a forward medical aid station\r\nwhere jeeps picked up the more seriously wounded and took them to\r\nhelicopters, which completed the evacuation. Patrol members reported 27\r\nknown enemy dead, including one that had been propelled into the air by\r\na direct hit from an artillery round.\r\n\r\nThe next major Marine ground action soon involved the same Company A\r\nplatoon, but this time as part of a larger force. Colonel Culhane, the\r\nregimental commander, directed his 1st Battalion to launch a new raid\r\non the Outpost 3 area in an attempt to oust the Chinese and thereby\r\ndeny the enemy use of the critical terrain. Inflicting casualties and\r\ncapturing prisoners were additional tasks assigned. On 8 May Lieutenant\r\nColonel Nihart issued Operation Order 12-52, calling for 1/5 to seize a\r\nseries of three intermediate objectives (S, V and X) en route to OP 3\r\n(Y). (See Map 8.) The combat patrol, reinforced by regimental elements,\r\nless Company B, was to be prepared to move north of OP 3 to occupy the\r\nnext hill mass (Z), if necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 8      K. White\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES FOR 1/5 ATTACK\r\n\r\n9 MAY 1952]\r\n\r\nOperational plans called for Lieutenant Lee’s Company A to do most of\r\nthe leg work as the assault unit. Captain Leland Graham’s Company C,\r\nthe diversionary force, was to make a feint against Hill 67, an enemy\r\nposition southwest of OP 3, and to neutralize it by fire. Weapons\r\nCompany, under First Lieutenant Ross L. Tipps, in support of the\r\nCompany A force, was to set up a base of fire at a designated position\r\n(T), southeast of OP 3. Artillery support was to be furnished by 1/11,\r\n4/11, and the attached 4.5-inch Rocket Battery. A section of regimental\r\n4.2-inch mortars was also assigned. One platoon of Company B tanks was\r\nto assist the assault force by firing both on designated positions and\r\ntargets of opportunity. Close air support flights were to be on station\r\nat two periods during the 9 May daylight operation.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning hours, under cover of darkness, all units moved\r\ninto position. At 0430 the 1st Platoon of Company A crossed the line\r\nof departure heading for Objective S, a small ridge south and west of\r\nOP 3. The 2d Platoon followed and moved out on the right, while the\r\n3d Platoon covered the rear. This hill, lightly defended, was quickly\r\noverrun by the Marines. The 1st Platoon then turned northeast towards\r\nthe four peaks (designated as V, X, Y, and Z), its main objectives.\r\nThese four positions were all situated at approximately the same\r\nelevation, 450 feet. A distance of some 1,300 yards separated the first\r\nand fourth hills in the north-south ridgeline.\r\n\r\nAs the 1/5 platoon neared Objective V, friendly rockets lashed the\r\ncrest of the hill, which was held by a reinforced enemy platoon in\r\nmutually supporting fighting holes. Assisted by this fire, Marine\r\ntwo-man teams with rifles and grenades assaulted the fighting holes\r\noccupied by the Chinese. As the Marines proceeded to clear the\r\nobjective, half of the Chinese were forced to retreat to safer ground.\r\nMarines estimated that 15 enemy were killed and a like number wounded.\r\nBy this time, three hours after setting out on the raid, the platoon\r\nhad seized one prisoner and sustained five wounded.\r\n\r\nWhile reorganizing for the attack against Objectives X and Y, the 5th\r\nMarines patrol came under a heavy artillery and mortar barrage that\r\nkilled one Marine and wounded three others. As the main body of the\r\nassault force advanced towards Objective X to support the attack, the\r\nlead elements of the company headed for OP 3. Throughout this maneuver,\r\nthe company remained under heavy artillery fire.\r\n\r\nProceeding along the eastern slope of the ridgeline to assault knobs\r\nX and Y, the platoon had a good view of the effectiveness of their\r\nfriendly supporting artillery fire. In fact, the combined rocket,\r\nhowitzer, mortar, tank, and machine gun fire threw up so much dust\r\nthat at times it restricted the vision of the Marine assault team. As\r\nplatoon members neared the summit of Objective X they encountered a\r\nheavy stream of defending fire. A strong counterattack from the front\r\nand left flank assailed the 1st Platoon, but the Marines repulsed the\r\nenemy with accurate small arms fire, killing six CCF. Infiltrators then\r\nattempted to envelop the Marine platoon and isolate it from the rest of\r\nthe Company A assault force. Successive waves of Chinese, employing a\r\nwedge formation, tried to overrun the main body of the assault force.\r\nIn repulsing this latest counterattack, Company A killed 12 and wounded\r\n5 enemy.\r\n\r\nQuickly sizing up the situation, the company commander ordered the\r\n1st Platoon to rejoin the rest of the assault force. As the platoon\r\nbegan to pull back at 1435 the Chinese blanketed the route with a\r\nheavy barrage, firing “over four hundred rounds in a five minute\r\nperiod.”[125] This intense shelling took the lives of three Marines,\r\nwounded a number of others, and halted the assault force just short of\r\nits final goal. Even though the Chinese had been driven from the three\r\nintermediate objectives, the devastating enemy mortar and artillery\r\nfire made the Marine position untenable. A third of the platoon moved\r\nback to Objective V; the rest worked their way along a route east\r\nof that objective. While the rest of Company A and Weapons Company\r\nelements occupied Hill T, the diversionary force, Company C, reinforced\r\nby other Weapons Company personnel, had remained at a strongpoint not\r\nfar from Objective S. All supporting ground weapons assisted in the\r\nwithdrawal. In addition to lending direct fire support, Marine tanks\r\nbrought forward emergency supplies and evacuated casualties. By 1730,\r\nthe assault force had returned to friendly lines, followed shortly by\r\nthe rest of the battalion.\r\n\r\n    [125] 1/5 ComdD, May 52, p. 10.\r\n\r\nAlthough the battalion failed to seize and hold all of its objectives,\r\nthat part of the mission calling for inflicting casualties and taking\r\nprisoners had been successfully executed.[126] Marines counted 35\r\nenemy dead, 53 wounded, and 1 POW, and estimated that an additional\r\n70 CCF had been killed and 105 wounded. Seven Marines were killed\r\nand 66 wounded in the action described by some observers as “the\r\nlargest offensive effort the 1st Marine Division [has] made since last\r\nSeptember.”[127] The battalion fire support was well controlled and\r\ncoordinated from an observation post on the MLR. Five air strikes,\r\nincluding one MPQ-14 mission, were credited with destroying three\r\nartillery pieces and an equal number of mortars, damaging two other\r\nmortars, and demolishing six personnel bunkers.\r\n\r\n    [126] Lieutenant Colonel Nihart believed that the heavy enemy\r\n          shelling, which had caused the early retirement of his\r\n          battalion, had been possible either because Chinese\r\n          mortar and artillery positions were so well camouflaged\r\n          that intelligence had not located them or else so well\r\n          protected that UNC counterbattery fire had failed to\r\n          destroy them. _Nihart comments._\r\n\r\n    [127] 5thMar ComdD, May 52, p. 9.\r\n\r\nAs the regiment noted, the earlier withdrawal of the OPLR had “altered\r\nto a considerable extent the tactics employed in this area. This is\r\nespecially apparent in the number of patrol contacts close to the MLR\r\nand displayed the eagerness of the enemy to move in on any ground not\r\nheld by friendly forces.”[128] At the same time the increased number\r\nof troops made available for the MLR defense considerably strengthened\r\nthe JAMESTOWN Line itself. Sector responsibility changed on 11 May.\r\nColonel Russell E. Honsowetz’ 7th Marines relieved the 5th Marines in\r\nthe center regimental sector, with 2/7 and 1/7 occupying the left and\r\nright battalion positions, respectively.\r\n\r\n    [128] _Ibid._, p. 1.\r\n\r\nWhen it took over the peace corridor sector the 7th Marines also\r\nassumed the responsibility for emergency rescue of the Allied truce\r\ndelegates at Panmunjom.[129] The regiment advanced a mile nearer the\r\nobjective when it moved the pick-up force’s assembly area to within\r\n400 yards of the line of departure. The 7th Marines also replaced the\r\ntanks in the force with M-39 personnel carriers, a U.S. Army-developed\r\ntracked vehicle similar in appearance to the Marine amphibian tractor.\r\nAnother vehicle the 7th Marines retained in its task force was a medium\r\ntank equipped with additional radios. This armored communication and\r\ncontrol vehicle was used as a radio relay station on the MLR to assist\r\nin liaison between moving infantry and tank units. Marine riflemen\r\ndubbed this command tank the porcupine, to describe the effect of many\r\nbristling antennas sticking out from its top. While the Marine division\r\nright sector, occupied by the 1st Marines, remained relatively quiet\r\nduring the spring months on JAMESTOWN, the 7th Marines in the center\r\nMLR would shortly be involved in the division’s major ground action in\r\nlate May.\r\n\r\n    [129] This force and its mission at various times were known as\r\n          “Task Force Jig” or “Operation Snatch.”\r\n\r\nAs part of the active defense of its JAMESTOWN line, Lieutenant Colonel\r\nDaughtry, commanding 1/7, issued a directive on 26 May intended to\r\ndeny to the enemy key terrain remaining on the old OPLR. Operation\r\nPlan 16-52 called for an attack to seize two parcels of high ground\r\nto the regiment’s right front. At the same time, the battalion was to\r\nneutralize two Chinese positions west of the main objectives, Hill 104\r\n(Objective 1) and the Tumae-ri Ridge (Objective 2), approximately a\r\nhalf-mile further north. The designated attack force, Captain Earl W.\r\nThompson’s Company A, was heavily reinforced. While Company A pursued\r\nits mission to the right, a Company C reinforced platoon under Second\r\nLieutenant Howard L. Siers would conduct a feint on a pair of enemy\r\npositions to the left. Support for the operation would come from 2/11,\r\ntwo tank platoons, and from air, which was to be on call.\r\n\r\nH-Hour was set for 0300 on 28 May. Attack and diversionary forces on\r\nschedule crossed the line of departure, a half-mile north of the MLR.\r\nCaptain Thompson’s main force advanced nearly to the base of Hill 104\r\nbefore the Chinese, in estimated reinforced platoon strength, began to\r\ncounterattack. The fight came to an abrupt end when Second Lieutenant\r\nJohn J. Donahue led his platoon to the top with bayonets fixed.[130] As\r\nthe Marines dug in they came under heavy mortar and artillery fire from\r\nCCF strongholds to the north. On the left, meanwhile, Lieutenant Siers\r\nhad received orders to seize the closer of his two objectives, former\r\nOPLR 5, instead of merely placing suppressive fire on it.\r\n\r\n    [130] Maj Kenneth A. Seal comments on draft MS, dtd Oct 66. At\r\n          the time of this attack, Lieutenant Seal commanded the 2d\r\n          Platoon, A/1/7.\r\n\r\nMoving forward from its base of fire, the platoon soon established\r\ncontact with the enemy. At 0554 the platoon began its attack on the\r\nobjective. Despite the close-in, hand-to-hand fighting, when it became\r\napparent the assault could not be stopped the enemy gave way to Marine\r\npersistence in seizing the hill. By 0700 the Company C, 7th Marines\r\nplatoon had secured its objectives and begun preparations for defense\r\nof the positions as well as continued support of the main attack force.\r\nHeavy casualties, however, forced Lieutenant Colonel Daughtry to recall\r\nthe platoon and it returned to the lines by 0930.\r\n\r\nUp on Hill 104, Company A, 1/7 faced practically the same situation.\r\nTaking Objective 1 had been costly and the advance through withering\r\nenemy fire was adding to the casualties. A reinforcing platoon was\r\nsent from the MLR to help the company disengage and return to friendly\r\nlines. Contact with the enemy was broken shortly after noon. With the\r\naid of air and artillery, the company was able to make its way to the\r\nMLR by 1405.\r\n\r\nAdvancing only as far as it did, the attack, like the one earlier that\r\nmonth, failed to take all the designated objectives. Casualties to the\r\n1/7 Marines were placed at 9 killed[131] and 107 wounded. Most of the\r\nlatter were evacuated for further treatment. Forty-five of the enemy\r\nwere counted dead and three wounded. Marines estimated another 40 enemy\r\nkilled and 40 more wounded.[132] The action resulted in a casualty toll\r\nthat was the highest to date for any Marine company in western Korea.\r\nAll three Company A rifle platoon leaders--Second Lieutenants Donahue,\r\nJules E. Gerding, and Kenneth A. Seal--were wounded. This battle also\r\nbecame the occasion for another unwelcomed record--4,053 rounds of\r\nenemy incoming, during a 24-hour period.\r\n\r\n    [131] Two Marines killed in the action were later posthumously\r\n          awarded the Medal of Honor. Corporal David B. Champagne,\r\n          A/1/7, was responsible for saving the lives of the\r\n          three other members of his fire team. When a grenade\r\n          fell in their midst, Champagne grabbed it to hurl back\r\n          to CCF positions. Just as it cleared his hand, the\r\n          grenade exploded, showering lethal shrapnel into the\r\n          body of the 19-year-old Rhode Islander. One of the C/1/7\r\n          reinforcement Marines, Private First Class John D. Kelly,\r\n          had conducted a one-man assault against a dug-in Chinese\r\n          machine gun crew. Though painfully wounded during this\r\n          encounter, he disposed of the enemy, then reduced a\r\n          second weapons bunker. While firing point-blank into a\r\n          third position the brave Marine was fatally wounded. This\r\n          1/7 action was the first in the western Korea defense to\r\n          result in multiple Medal of Honor awards.\r\n\r\n    [132] 1/7 ComdD, May 52, pp. 17–18.\r\n\r\nFollowing this late May offensive, a brief period of relative calm\r\nsettled over the MLR. Marine and Chinese units continued the active\r\ndefense of their respective sectors, with generally only a limited\r\nnumber of contacts. Fire fights between Marine patrols and CCF\r\ndefenders lasted only a short time and usually ended when artillery\r\nfire caused the patrol to pull back. Even though this state of affairs\r\nremained essentially unchanged through June, several other events that\r\nmonth would affect Marine defense of the westernmost sector in I Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n_End of the Second Year of War_[133]\r\n\r\n    [133] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpts_ No. 4, Chap. 9, No. 5,\r\n          Chap. 8; 1stMarDiv ComdD, Jun 52; 5th Mar ComdDs, Apr,\r\n          Jun 52; 7thMar ComdDs, May-Jun 52; 1/7 ComdD, May 52; KMC\r\n          Regt Unit Rpt 120, dtd 30 Jun 52.\r\n\r\nA second realignment of the Marine-Commonwealth boundary along Line\r\nJAMESTOWN was made on 1 June. Part of the rear of the MLR was moved\r\neastward to enable the Marine division to assume full responsibility\r\nfor a key ridgetop. Prior to this date the hill mass had been divided\r\nalong its crest, a factor that made it a potential trouble spot for\r\nboth divisions. On 23 and 24 June, the 7th Marines MLR battalions\r\nrelocated their positions towards the enemy along JAMESTOWN. This\r\nreadjustment of the line varied from 1,300 yards in the center of the\r\nregimental sector to 400 yards near its right. The additional terrain\r\nstrengthened the division front by placing the center regiment on\r\nimproved and more defensible ground.\r\n\r\nA week before this MLR change took place, there had been a shift in\r\noccupants in its far right sector. Colonel Culhane’s 5th Marines\r\nreplaced the 1st on line, which then went into division reserve.\r\nManning the MLR were 2/5 on the left and 1/5 to the right.\r\n\r\nIn early June the recently appointed UN commander, General Clark, made\r\nhis first visit to the 1st Marine Division front. During his briefing,\r\nGeneral Selden reviewed the unusual combat difficulties confronting his\r\nMarines. In addition to the unfavorable terrain, the division commander\r\nnoted the special operational restrictions caused by proximity to the\r\ntruce talk site. Presence of a large number of uncharted minefields\r\ncreated another obstacle. Herculean efforts were required of the\r\nMarines to simultaneously man and construct defenses over 35 miles of\r\nJAMESTOWN. Adding to Marine problems were the facts that ground units\r\nwere not receiving sufficient close air support and the capabilities\r\nof the Chinese were constantly increasing.\r\n\r\nChinese order of battle (OOB) information was fed into the division\r\nintelligence network by higher commands, I Corps and EUSAK, and\r\nadjacent units, but a large part of the data about Communist forces\r\nwas produced by the division itself. Frontline units in contact with\r\nthe enemy, by observation of his activities, supplied the bulk of\r\nintelligence about enemy defense tactics, employment of weapons, and\r\ncombat characteristics. Supporting Marine division units, particularly\r\nartillery and armor, fed more facts into the system, mostly through\r\nidentification of the caliber of enemy shells fired at the Marines. As\r\na result of its missions forward of the line and actions in defense\r\nof it, the division reconnaissance company also contributed to the\r\nintelligence network. Individual Marines, performing as tactical air\r\nobservers and artillery air observers, as well as the VMO and HMR\r\npilots, were other important sources readily available to the 1st\r\nMarine Division.\r\n\r\nG-2 directed the division intelligence effort, including processing of\r\nraw material and supplying of updated reports to 1st Division units.\r\nThe G-2 section also maintained OOB and target identification data\r\non Chinese units and their commanders. Members of the G-2 staff also\r\nassisted in interrogation of prisoners of war (POWs), screened the\r\ncivilians apprehended in unauthorized areas, debriefed Marines exposed\r\nto enemy intelligence, and conducted inspections of division internal\r\nsecurity. In areas where the 1st Marine Division had only a limited\r\nintelligence capability it turned to EUSAK for assistance.\r\n\r\nEighth Army teams augmented the division counterintelligence efforts\r\nand provided most of the translation service. In addition, three radio\r\nintercept units furnished information to the Marines. The critical\r\nimportance of this service had been proven during several combat\r\npatrols in May when additional information was instantly radioed to a\r\nfriendly unit under fire.\r\n\r\nOther intelligence activities were less beneficial to the Marines.\r\nThese operations were conducted by Tactical Liaison Officers (TLOs,\r\nfriendly Koreans trained by U.S. intelligence teams), and members of\r\na Higher Intelligence Detachment (HID), a Korean unit assigned from\r\nEUSAK. Both the TLO and HID proved of limited value to the division,\r\ndue to the generally poor educational background of the agents, their\r\ninadequate training, and frequent failure to return from assignments\r\nbehind enemy lines. Some Marines believed the basic fault in these\r\noperatives lay in “an exaggerated opinion of their importance.”[134]\r\n\r\n    [134] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, p. 9-33.\r\n\r\nSeveral division intelligence Marines, in conjunction with training\r\nand shore party personnel, took part in an informational activity of a\r\ndifferent type. These Marines reconnoitered several friendly islands\r\noff western Korea to determine their suitability for division landing\r\nexercises. The second one inspected, Tokchok-to, 30 miles southwest\r\nof Inchon, was selected. By early June planning had progressed to\r\nthe point where a program had been developed for bimonthly battalion\r\nlanding team exercises. The KPR maneuver force, appropriately\r\nreinforced, was designated as a participating unit. Landings were to\r\nemploy boat teams, amphibian tractors, and helicopters. The entire\r\nprogram was designed to provide refresher training for Marines in\r\ncarrying out their primary mission of amphibious assault. By the end of\r\nJune, 3/5 and 3/1, in turn, had captured Tokchok-to.\r\n\r\nOther training concentrated more on the task at hand. Division units\r\nin reserve rehearsed tactics for offensive and defensive warfare. Most\r\nground units conducted extensive schooling in both mine and booby\r\ntrap detection and clearance. Recognizing that patrolling was an\r\nimportant part of a Marine’s life on the MLR, the division included\r\nin its Noncommissioned Officers’ (NCO) Leadership School a thorough\r\nindoctrination in patrolling tactics.[135] More than 50 percent of\r\nthe training at all levels was at night. In addition, an extensive\r\norientation was conducted for newly arrived combat replacements,\r\nwho could not be committed to action for 72 hours after joining the\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n    [135] BGen Austin R. Brunelli ltr to Hd, HistBr, G-3 Div, HQMC,\r\n          dtd 13 Sep 66, hereafter _Brunelli ltr_. The division\r\n          chief of staff during more than half of 1952, Colonel\r\n          Brunelli later observed that the “school produced more\r\n          effective patrolling and ... contributed to reducing our\r\n          casualties.”\r\n\r\nA week after the division’s June replacements landed at Inchon, General\r\nSelden’s headquarters received a directive that would affect a number\r\nof these new Marines. On 10 June CG, EUSAK ordered his corps commanders\r\nto make continuous efforts to secure the identification and changes in\r\nthe enemy order of battle. Two days later I Corps followed the Eighth\r\nArmy order with a letter of instruction which called for each I Corps\r\ndivision to “prepare plans for launching swift, vigorous, and violent\r\nlarge-scale raids to capture prisoners, to gain intelligence, to\r\ndestroy enemy positions and material and/or strong limited objective\r\nattacks to improve and strengthen Line JAMESTOWN.”[136] Large scale\r\nwas defined as an “attacking force limited to battalion or regimental\r\n(brigade) size with appropriate armor and artillery support.”[137]\r\nDivisions were required to submit detailed proposals for future action\r\nby 21 June. Marine division plans for limited objective attacks during\r\nJuly by units of the 7th Marines and KMCs were subsequently prepared\r\nand forwarded to I Corps.\r\n\r\n    [136] 1stMarDiv ComdD, Jun 52, App. I, p. 8.\r\n\r\n    [137] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nOne operation conducted north of the 2/5 left battalion sector early\r\non 22 June was not, however, in response to this enemy identification\r\nmission. Late the previous day, Company G had sent out a 16-man\r\nambush. Before the Marines reached their destination, a small enemy\r\nforce, itself lying in wait, began to pour a heavy volume of fire on\r\nthe Marines. At this point the patrol was ordered to pull back. One\r\ngroup of 10 made it back to the MLR; the remaining Marines headed for\r\na nearby combat outpost in friendly hands. Reports to the company\r\nrevealed one Marine not accounted for. The outpost commander was\r\ndirected to search the area for the missing Marine. This reconnaissance\r\nby a fire team failed, but a reinforced squad sent out later brought\r\nback the body of the Marine who had been killed by Chinese artillery.\r\n\r\nWhile this rescue effort was in progress, another similar action was\r\nunder way. Not long after its arrival on the MLR, Company E, 2/5 had\r\nspotted in the No-Man’s-Land between the two main defensive lines a\r\nfigure that appeared to be the body of a Marine. Since one man had been\r\nreported missing from an earlier 1st Marines patrol, recovery of the\r\nbody, which had been propped up against a mound of dirt in the open,\r\nwas undertaken. A special Company E patrol left the main line shortly\r\nbefore dawn on the 22d and reached the recovery area at daybreak. After\r\nartillery had laid down smoke, the patrol moved in, quickly recovered\r\nthe body, and set out for friendly territory. Before the Marines had\r\nadvanced very far on their return trip, the Chinese interdicted their\r\nroute with heavy mortar fire, which killed one member of the patrol and\r\nwounded another. When the 5th Marines patrol returned to JAMESTOWN\r\nshortly after 0700, it carried not only the body it had recovered but\r\nalso that of the Marine who had been killed on the recovery mission.\r\n\r\nBy the end of June, major command changes had taken place within the\r\n1st Marine Division as well as in several other UNC components. On\r\n13 June, Brigadier General Robert O. Bare took over the second spot\r\nfrom Brigadier General Twining. Both ADCs were graduates of the Naval\r\nAcademy and both were native mid-Westerners (General Bare--Iowa,\r\nGeneral Twining--Wisconsin). Before joining the 1st Marine Division in\r\nKorea General Bare had served at Camp Pendleton, California where most\r\nrecently he had been commanding general of the Training and Replacement\r\nCommand. His World War II experience included participation in both\r\nEuropean and Pacific campaigns. He was the Staff Officer, Plans,\r\nin the U.S. Naval Section for the Allied naval group that planned\r\nthe amphibious assault at Normandy, France. Later he served in the\r\nPeleliu and Okinawa campaigns and, with the ending of hostilities, had\r\nparticipated in the surrender and repatriation of the Japanese in north\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nThe outgoing ADC, General Twining, was being reassigned to the Office\r\nof the Commandant, HQMC. For his outstanding service as assistant\r\ndivision commander from March through May 1952, he received a Gold Star\r\nin lieu of his second Legion of Merit with Combat “V.”\r\n\r\nOther high-level changes in command that had also recently taken place\r\nhad included the UNC commander himself, General Ridgway, who had been\r\nsucceeded in mid-May by General Clark. Major General Glenn O. Barcus,\r\nUSAF, had assumed command of Fifth Air Force, replacing Lieutenant\r\nGeneral Everest on 30 May. On 4 June, Vice Admiral Robert P. Briscoe\r\nhad been named the new Commander, Naval Forces Far East to succeed Vice\r\nAdmiral C. Turner Joy who had held the position since August 1949. And\r\nin I Corps, Major General Paul W. Kendall, USA, took over as corps\r\ncommander on 29 June from Lieutenant General O’Daniel.\r\n\r\nThe end of the second year of the Korean fighting and the beginning of\r\nthe third was observed by the Chinese with an attack against the 2d\r\nBattalion, 5th Marines, manning JAMESTOWN positions to the left of the\r\nregimental sector. Commanded at that time by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas\r\nJ. Cross, 2/5 was new on line, having relieved 2/1 during the night of\r\n15–16 June.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon of 24 June, the enemy began registering his\r\nmortars and artillery on MLR company positions of 2/5 and a portion of\r\nthe rear area occupied by the battalion 81mm mortars. Chinese incoming,\r\nsometimes intense, sometimes sporadic, continued until shortly after\r\n2130. By this time the CCF were moving down their trenches toward a\r\nkey outpost, Yoke, known also as Hill 159, which was still occupied\r\non daytime basis by the Marines and lay north of the Company F Sector\r\n(Captain Harold C. Fuson). Moments later, the 34 men temporarily\r\noutposting Yoke saw the Chinese and opened with small arms fire,\r\nbut the Marine positions were quickly enveloped by the Chinese. The\r\nAmericans occupying the forward slopes of Yoke suffered many casualties\r\nfrom the intense fires supporting the enemy rush.\r\n\r\nWhile the initial attack was in progress, the Chinese were able to\r\nposition and fire machine guns from behind the outpost and in trenches\r\non the forward slopes. Communist mortars interdicted the Marine supply\r\nroutes to make normal withdrawal and reinforcement measures difficult.\r\nThe Marines moved into bunkers, called down pre-planned fires, and\r\ncontinued the defense. Although the Chinese had overrun Yoke, they\r\ncould not evict the Marines. At about 0300, the enemy withdrew. When\r\nthe 2/5 troops followed to reoccupy the forward slopes of Yoke, the\r\nenemy renewed his attack and struck again. As before, the Marines took\r\nto bunkers and called in defensive artillery fires. These boxing fires\r\nfell around the outpost perimeter until first light when the attackers\r\nwithdrew for the second time.\r\n\r\nFour other outposts in the battalion area were involved in the\r\nanniversary attack, but the action around Yoke was by far the heaviest.\r\nIt resulted in 10 Marines of 2/5 killed and 36 wounded. At Yoke alone,\r\n9 were killed and 23 wounded. Enemy dead were 12 known and 50 estimated\r\nkilled. Chinese wounded were estimated at 100. At one point during the\r\nattack on Yoke, the outpost commander reported that the enemy were\r\nwearing gas masks and using tear-gas grenades. Investigation revealed\r\nthat the Chinese had carried and even worn the masks, but that they had\r\nemployed white phosphorus grenades rather than tear gas. This was the\r\nfirst instance Marine division personnel had ever encountered of CCF\r\nsoldiers carrying gas masks in an attack and it was “believed part of\r\nthe enemy’s hate campaign to impress their troops with the possible\r\nuse by the UN Forces of CBR (Chemical, Biological and Radiological)\r\nwarfare.”[138]\r\n\r\n    [138] Selden, _Div Staff Rpt_, p. 16.\r\n\r\nThis violent eruption of enemy activity on the night of 24 June was\r\nfollowed by a brief period of greatly reduced ground action. Late on\r\nthe 29th, however, the battlefront lull was broken when the 1st KMC\r\nRegiment sent out a raiding party to capture Chinese soldiers and their\r\nweapons and equipment, to inflict casualties, and to destroy positions.\r\nSecond Lieutenant Kwak Sang In had his reinforced platoon from the 3d\r\nCompany, 1st Battalion, equipped with rifles, carbines, machine guns,\r\nflamethrowers, and explosives. Target for the attack was an enemy\r\noutpost four miles south of Panmunjom that overlooked the Sachon River.\r\n\r\nThe patrol followed the general pattern of previous raids. It made\r\nuse of supporting elements positioned on high ground in front of the\r\nobjective. In this action the patrol struck from the rear, using\r\nartillery fire for both the assault and the withdrawal. Another\r\nsimilarity existed in that the results were nearly the same--no\r\nprisoners taken but fewer casualties to the attackers. One difference\r\nfrom earlier operations was that this patrol employed flamethrowers\r\nand TNT for destroying bunkers and inflicting casualties. Both weapons\r\nwere credited in the killing of 12 and the wounding of 6 Chinese, in\r\ndestroying 1 mortar and 7 bunkers, and in burning 3 other bunkers and\r\nnumerous automatic weapons and rifles. Because of the heavy weight of a\r\nloaded flamethrower and the small size of the Korean Marines carrying\r\nthese weapons, the flamethrower operators were fairly well exhausted by\r\nthe end of the patrol.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Long Fourth of July_[139]\r\n\r\n    [139] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, Chap. 8; and\r\n          1stMarDiv, 5thMar, 7thMar, 11thMar, 1/5, 2/5, 1/7, 3/7,\r\n          1st TkBn ComdDs, Jul 52.\r\n\r\nThe approach of the American Fourth of July holiday marking an earlier\r\nstruggle for freedom was appropriately accompanied by ground action\r\ninitiated by all of the mainland MLR regiments. In the KMC area, a 3\r\nJuly raiding party struck at forward enemy positions before dawn,\r\nkilling nine Chinese. In the center regimental sector Colonel Thomas\r\nC. Moore’s[140] 7th Marines were also engaged in an active sector\r\ndefense. In the left battalion spot 3/7, which had replaced 2/7 on\r\nline, dispatched raids on each of the first three nights of the month.\r\nIts Company G patrol on the night of 2–3 July was to be involved in one\r\nof the most costly small unit actions in the western Korea tour of duty\r\nfor the Marine division.\r\n\r\n    [140] Colonel Moore took over regimental command on 11 June.\r\n          The former CO, Colonel Honsowetz, had been named\r\n          Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3 of the 1st Marine Division.\r\n\r\nOperational plans called for the platoon night raid on the 2d to be\r\nfollowed by a dawn attack the next morning. In both actions, the\r\nprisoner-taking aspect of the mission was considered a primary one.\r\nThe early part of the operation was uneventful. One platoon moved\r\nforward toward the objective, Hill 159 (Yoke), 1,200 yards beyond\r\ncombat outpost (COP) White, to the regimental left, without making\r\ncontact with the enemy. The platoon then established a base of fire on\r\nfavorable terrain from which the attack by the second platoon could be\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\nThe second platoon passed through the forward position of the first\r\nshortly before 0630 and moved out into enemy terrain. It advanced less\r\nthan 300 yards before its progress was halted by a Chinese force of\r\nbattalion strength occupying the objective, Hill 159. Heavy enemy rifle\r\nand machine gun fire, hand grenades, mortar and artillery deluged the\r\nadvancing Marines. Many of them quickly became casualties, but the\r\noperation continued, due in part to the determination and initiative\r\nof the NCOs. One of these was Staff Sergeant William E. Shuck, Jr.,\r\nin charge of a machine gun squad. When the leader of one of the rifle\r\nsquads became a casualty, Sergeant Shuck assumed command of that squad\r\nin addition to his own. Although wounded, he organized the two units\r\nand led them against the objective. Nearing the summit of the hill, the\r\nsergeant was hit a second time. Still he refused evacuation, remaining\r\nwell forward in the lines to direct his assault force.\r\n\r\nIt was not until he had received orders to break contact with the enemy\r\nthat the sergeant pulled back from the attack. During the withdrawal\r\nhe looked after the other Marine casualties, making certain that all\r\ndead and wounded had been evacuated from the zone of action. While\r\ndirecting the last of the evacuation, Sergeant Shuck was struck by a\r\nsniper’s bullet and killed by this third hit.[141] He was one of four\r\nMarines killed in the engagement. Forty others were wounded. Although\r\nno Chinese were captured, Marines estimated the enemy suffered losses\r\nof 50 killed and an additional 150 wounded.\r\n\r\n    [141] The leadership, bravery, and unselfish devotion to duty\r\n          earned for Sergeant Shuck the Medal of Honor, an award\r\n          made to 14 Marines during the fighting in West Korea.\r\n          During the earlier part of the war, 28 Marines had\r\n          received the Medal of Honor. Of these, 17 were awarded\r\n          posthumously. Five Navy hospital corpsmen, all attached\r\n          to the 1st Marine Division, also earned the MOH. These\r\n          awards, with one exception, were for heroism under combat\r\n          conditions during the 1952–1953 period of the Korean War.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the 7th Marines, the 5th Marines in the right MLR sector\r\nordered a company-size patrol, also on the night of 2–3 July. Company\r\nA, 1/5 was directed to attack successively three outposts in the\r\nvicinity of the village of Samichon along the river bearing the same\r\nname and two miles beyond the point where the MLR crossed the river.\r\nAfter the reinforced company had taken the first two objectives, which\r\nwere unoccupied, it received orders from division to return to the\r\nbattalion area. Despite the fact the patrol had ventured far beyond the\r\nMarine lines, it did not come into contact with any Chinese forces.\r\n\r\nA 2/5 combat patrol leaving the MLR just after dawn was successful in\r\ninflicting casualties on the enemy, taking prisoners, and destroying\r\nenemy field fortifications. The patrol made good progress until a\r\nMarine inadvertently set off an enemy mine. This mishap gave away the\r\npatrol’s location and prompted reprisal by the Chinese. A one-hour fire\r\nfight followed. Then the patrol called in smoke and returned under its\r\ncover to JAMESTOWN. Marine casualties were 1 killed and 11 wounded.\r\nThe second 2/5 patrol that same date was a successful ambush completed\r\n10 minutes before midnight. In the brief clash that developed, Marine\r\nambushers killed 6 enemy and wounded 8 more. The Marine force suffered\r\nno casualties.\r\n\r\nThe ambush patrol returned 15 minutes after midnight on 4 July.\r\nEven at that early hour division artillerymen had already initiated\r\nan appropriate ceremony to mark the Fourth. On 2 July, I Corps had\r\ndirected the massing of fires on 4 July on the most remunerative\r\ntargets in each division area. All objectives in the corps sector were\r\nto be attacked simultaneously at specified times for a one-minute\r\nperiod by employing a firing technique known as time on target\r\n(TOT).[142] Normal daily fires were also to be carried out. Designated\r\nas Operation FIRECRACKER, the shoot expended 3,202 rounds in the\r\ndivision sector. Light and medium battalions of the 11th Marines, plus\r\nits 4.5-inch Rocket Battery destroyed some enemy trenches, bunkers,\r\nmortar and artillery positions, and damaged others. The division\r\nreported that the special fires on 4 July had also resulted in 44 known\r\nCCF casualties, including 21 dead, and 12 more who were estimated to\r\nhave been injured.\r\n\r\n    [142] In the TOT technique, participating units time their\r\n          initial volleys to ensure that their shells arrive on the\r\n          target at the same time.\r\n\r\nMore casualties, however, resulted from the issuing of another I\r\nCorps directive, this one dealing with the conduct of raids to seize\r\nprisoners, obtain information about the enemy, and to destroy his\r\npositions, supplies, and equipment. Back in June, the EUSAK commander\r\nhad first stressed to his corps commanders the increased importance of\r\ncombat raids to obtain additional intelligence during this period of\r\nstabilized conflict.\r\n\r\nAlthough General Selden had submitted two division plans, he strongly\r\nbelieved that smaller patrols could accomplish the objective with fewer\r\ncasualties and loss of life.[143] In particular, the division commander\r\npointed out to I Corps that adequate defense of the 35-mile-long\r\nMarine division front did not permit the withdrawal of a sizable force\r\nfor patrol missions without endangering the security of the entire\r\nCorps sector. The attack order was issued, however, on 3 July for\r\nthe first large-scale raid to be conducted prior to 7 July. The code\r\nname BUCKSHOT 2B was assigned for this particular raid. As soon as he\r\nreceived the date of execution for the proposed operation, the Marine\r\ndivision commander advised I Corps that designation of 7 July as the\r\ncut-off date for the raid precluded proper rehearsal of attack plans.\r\nThe operation would also conflict with rotation to the States of 2,651\r\nMarines, whose replacements would not be available until 11 July. Corps\r\nturned a deaf ear; division then ordered a battalion-size attack for\r\nthe night of 6–7 July.\r\n\r\n    [143] Among division commanders in the I Corps area, General\r\n          Selden was not alone in his grave misgivings of this\r\n          method of gaining information about the Chinese. Major\r\n          General A. J. H. Cassels, 1st Commonwealth Division,\r\n          shared with the Marine commander the belief that such\r\n          operations were too costly for the intended purpose.\r\n          _McGill comments_ and Brigadier C. N. Barclay, _The first\r\n          Commonwealth Division: The Story of British Commonwealth\r\n          Land Forces in Korea, 1950–1953_ (Aldershot, England:\r\n          Gale and Polden Ltd., 1954), p. 127, hereafter Barclay,\r\n          _Commonwealth_.\r\n\r\nBefore dusk on 6 July, Lieutenant Colonel Daughtry’s reinforced\r\n1st Battalion, 7th Marines moved into position--on the left, a\r\ntank-infantry force, A/1/7 (still under Captain Thompson), to create a\r\ndiversion; in the center, the main assault force, Company C (Captain\r\nRobert A. Owens); and on the right, a reinforced platoon from Company\r\nB (Captain Lyle S. Whitmore, Jr.) to support the attack by fire from\r\npositions close to the objective, Yoke. Earlier, three reinforced\r\nsquads from Captain Thompson’s unit had occupied combat outposts in the\r\narea of operations to deny the use of key terrain to the enemy and to\r\nprovide additional fire support in the attack. At 2200, Captain Owens’\r\nCompany C crossed the line of departure and set its course for Yoke,\r\nthree-quarters of a mile northeast. Five minutes later the Company B\r\nsupport unit moved out to occupy the intermediate objective, COP Green,\r\none-half mile southeast of Yoke. As it took up positions on COP Green,\r\nCaptain Whitmore’s Company B platoon discovered that no Chinese were\r\nin its vicinity; in fact, the platoon was not to encounter any enemy\r\nforces during BUCKSHOT.\r\n\r\nEven though Company B failed to engage any Chinese, the remainder\r\nof the battalion encountered more than its share. About 450 yards\r\nsouthwest of the objective the Company C attack force was hit by an\r\nenemy ambush, which cut off Captain Owens’ lead element. Although the\r\nChinese directed strong efforts at halting the Marine advance, they\r\nwere unsuccessful in this attempt. The Marines pressed the attack and\r\nseized Yoke 20 minutes after midnight.\r\n\r\nOn the left, the diversionary attack unit, Company A supported by the\r\nfive tanks of the 2d Platoon, Company D, 1st Tank Battalion, and by a\r\nsection of flame tanks from the armored battalion headquarters, began\r\nits mission at 2355. In three-quarters of an hour, the tank-infantry\r\nunit reached its objective, the first high ground southwest of Yoke.\r\nTanks turned their 90mm guns on known Chinese positions on the hill to\r\nthe north. During the next hour, the big guns of the M-46 medium tanks\r\nsent 49 rounds into enemy emplacements. The Marine tanks ceased fire at\r\n0113 when Captain Thompson was alerted to assist Company C. He left one\r\nrifle platoon with the tanks.\r\n\r\nOver on the high ground to the north and east, the attack force was\r\nunder heavy fire from Communist mortars and artillery and was also\r\nreceiving a number of enemy small-unit probes. At 0200, Company A made\r\ncontact with Company C. Captain Thompson found the main force somewhat\r\ndisorganized as a result of the wounding of the company commander,\r\nCaptain Owens, the loss of several key officers and NCOs, and the\r\neffects of the lead element of Company C being ambushed and cut off.\r\nAfter being briefed on the situation by Captain Owens and conducting a\r\nreconnaissance, Captain Thompson recommended to the battalion commander\r\nthat the entire force be recalled before daylight. At 0310 the two\r\ncompanies at Yoke began to disengage, returning to the MLR by 0636 on\r\nthe 7th, without further casualties.\r\n\r\nThe one platoon of Company A and seven tanks of the diversion unit were\r\nstill in their forward positions on the left and had prepared to resume\r\nfiring. At dawn the M-46s relaid their guns on targets that had become\r\nvisible. Tank gunners destroyed two observation posts and three machine\r\ngun positions and damaged many feet of trenchlines. At one point in\r\nthe firing, the tank platoon commander, Second Lieutenant Terry K.\r\nDonk, using a power scope, observed “... two officers in forest green\r\nuniforms without equipment. They were definitely giving orders to\r\nmachine gunners and infantry.”[144] These 2 were among the 19 counted\r\ncasualties (10 wounded) that the tankers inflicted during BUCKSHOT.\r\n\r\n    [144] 1st TkBn ComdD, Jul 52.\r\n\r\nWith the return at 0645 of the tank-infantry diversion force, the\r\nspecial operation for obtaining prisoners and information ended.\r\nNo Chinese had been captured and no data gleaned from Communist\r\ncasualties, listed as the 19 reported by the tankers and an estimated\r\n20 more wounded or killed. Marine casualties from the operation were\r\nout of proportion to the results achieved--12 dead, 85 wounded, and 5\r\nmissing. It had been a high price to pay for a venture of this type,\r\nparticularly when the primary objectives went unaccomplished.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire 4–7 July period, 22 Marines had lost their lives in\r\ncombat operations. Division reported that 268 Marines had been wounded\r\nduring the long Fourth of July. These figures were the highest since\r\nSeptember 1951 when large scale attacks by UN forces had first been\r\nabolished in line with the new tactic of positional warfare that would\r\nbe waged until the truce talks resulted in an armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Changes in the Lineup_[145]\r\n\r\n    [145] The material in this section is derived from the\r\n          1stMarDiv ComdD, Jul 52.\r\n\r\nDivision casualties were considerably higher during the first week in\r\nJuly than they were for the rest of the month. Once the pace of combat\r\nslowed, following the initial flurry of activity, the front again\r\nsettled down to the patrol, raid, and ambush routine that had marked\r\nthe static period of the Korean fighting. In accordance with the orders\r\npreviously issued by higher authority the division placed continued\r\nemphasis on gathering all information it could about the enemy, his\r\ndispositions, and tactics. To assist in this effort, General Selden\r\nin July removed his reconnaissance company from defense of its small\r\nsector of JAMESTOWN and directed the unit to conduct training for its\r\nprimary mission, obtaining intelligence about the enemy. Its place on\r\nthe MLR was assumed by the two amphibian tractor companies then on line.\r\n\r\nAnother change of lineup took place on 14 July. At this time a\r\nbattalion from the 15th Regiment, U.S. 3d Infantry Division took over\r\nthe role of the maneuver element in the Kimpo Provisional Regiment,\r\nthen held by 1/1, thereby releasing that battalion to its parent unit.\r\nWith this change, the 1st Marine Division had a full regiment in\r\nreserve for the first time since its arrival in western Korea. A later\r\nshift in units occurred on 26 July when the 7th and 1st Marines traded\r\nplaces and missions. At that time the MLR, from west to east, was\r\nmanned by the KPR, 1st AmTrac Bn, KMC, 1st Marines, and 5th Marines.\r\n\r\nOpposing them in mid-July were an estimated 27 infantry battalions,\r\nwhose primary missions were to defend the sectors assigned. The\r\ndivision credited these units with the capability of launching limited\r\nobjective attacks at any time or of taking part in a major attack with\r\na force of up to 57 infantry and 16 artillery battalions, augmented\r\nby 40 tanks or self-propelled guns. It was estimated also that the\r\nenemy could cross the Han in battalion strength in the vicinity of\r\nthe northern shore of Kimpo Peninsula at any time and that Communist\r\naircraft could attack anywhere in the division sector. Enemy forces\r\nidentified at the end of July, from west to east, were the 193d, 195th,\r\nand 194th Divisions of the 65th CCF Army; the 189th Division of the 63d\r\nCCF Army; and the 118th Division, 40th CCF Army, which had recently\r\nmoved from a position opposite the Commonwealth and U.S. 3d Infantry\r\nDivisions. Infantry strength of the Communists was established at\r\n28,328.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Replacement and Rotation_[146]\r\n\r\n    [146] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from _PacFlt EvalRpts_ No. 4, Chaps. 9, 10; No.\r\n          5, Chaps. 8, 9.\r\n\r\nMarine infantry strength at the end of July 1952 was little more\r\nthan half of the Chinese total. The division personnel strength was\r\nmaintained by the monthly replacement and rotation program of Marines\r\nto fill vacancies created by the return of Marine combat personnel to\r\nCONUS (Continental United States) and combat losses. In the second\r\nquarter of 1952, the division rotated 433 officers and 6,280 enlisted\r\nmen from Korea. In exchange, 506 officers and 7,359 enlisted men\r\narrived from the States in replacement drafts. A new arrival could\r\nexpect to stay with the division about 10½ months.\r\n\r\nIn the late spring of 1952 many of the division’s new replacements were\r\n“dental cripples”--Marines requiring dental treatment, even emergency\r\ncare in some cases.[147] General Selden directed that contact teams be\r\nformed to meet the replacement drafts in Japan. During the last leg of\r\nthe trip to Korea dental personnel screened the new combat Marines on\r\nshipboard. By the time the division area had been reached, the dentists\r\nknew what remedial work would be required by incoming troops. At the\r\nend of the summer the problem was well under control.\r\n\r\n    [147] _Brunelli ltr._\r\n\r\nEven though the 1st Marine Division in July continued to be somewhat\r\nin excess of its authorized strength in total personnel, it had\r\ncertain imbalances and was in rather short supply of certain ranks and\r\nspecialists. While the normal tour for most infantry officers ranged\r\nfrom 9 to 12 months, an excess of company grade officers, particularly\r\nlieutenants, had resulted in a reduction of the Korean tour for them\r\nto just six months. This brief period of duty plus an intra-division\r\nrotation policy that caused a mass shifting of duty assignments every\r\nthree-to-five months tended to reduce unit combat efficiency. On the\r\nother hand the change of assignments had a favorable effect in that\r\nit broadened the experience of individual Marines. Beginning in the\r\nsummer of 1952, however, the division modified this policy to reduce\r\nits number of intra-division transfers.\r\n\r\nPersonnel shortages existed in both the artillery and tank MOSs\r\n(Military Occupational Speciality). Mass rotation of reservist company\r\ngrade artillery officers had necessitated the transfer of infantry\r\nofficers to the 11th Marines for training and reassignment within the\r\nregiment. During the time when the supply of artillery officers was\r\nlimited, however, the quality of support rendered remained high.[148]\r\nThe other major shortage in the division was that of qualified\r\ncrewmen--both drivers and gunners--for the M-46 tanks. Neither tank\r\ndriving nor gunnery for the M-46 was taught in the tank crewmen’s\r\ncourse conducted at Camp Pendleton, California. General Selden\r\nrequested of Lieutenant General Franklin A. Hart (CG, FMFPac) that\r\n“tank crewmen be thoroughly trained prior to leaving the U.S.”[149]\r\n\r\n    [148] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, p. 9-27.\r\n\r\n    [149] 1stMarDiv ComdD, July 52, p. 4.\r\n\r\nFundamental to the tank problem was a shortage of the M-46 itself.\r\nAt the training facility, Training and Replacement Command, Camp\r\nPendleton, M-46 engines had been available for maintenance instruction\r\nbut no tanks for the training of gunners and drivers.[150] General\r\nHart pointed out this deficiency to the Commandant, General Lemuel C.\r\nShepherd, Jr. On 13 August the Commandant directed the transfer of five\r\ntanks to the training installation from the 7th Tank Battalion,[151]\r\nalso located at Camp Pendleton. At the same time General Shepherd\r\nordered an increase in the school quota for tank crewmen. The first\r\ngraduates would not reach the division in Korea, however, until the\r\nNovember draft.\r\n\r\n    [150] FMFPac ComdD, Jul 52, App VIII, Encl (7), Anx (E).\r\n\r\n    [151] FMFPac ComdD, Aug 52, App I, Encl (35).\r\n\r\nThe presence of not fully trained personnel in a combat zone was not\r\nlimited to the division. In the summer and fall of 1952, a large\r\nnumber of volunteer reservists, both pilots and enlisted replacements\r\nwith little experience since the end of World War II, joined the 1st\r\nMAW. It had not been possible for the Stateside training and tactical\r\nsquadrons, themselves short of personnel and aircraft, to qualify all\r\npilots as combat ready. It fell upon the wing in Korea, therefore,\r\nto take the needed corrective action. The more experienced 1st MAW\r\npilots, after completing their combat missions, flew instructional\r\nflights to help prepare the rusty fliers. Some reserve pilots, away\r\nfrom regular daily flying since 1945, found the adjustment too\r\ndifficult and turned in their wings. MACG-2 operated “Pohang U,” a\r\ntraining course for forward air controllers. In practically every\r\nsquadron, there were shortages of electronics personnel. Jet squadrons\r\nfound mechanics hard to come by. There were never enough motor\r\ntransport replacements. For unqualified enlisted Marines, squadrons\r\noperated on-the-job training programs.\r\n\r\nTo maintain a reasonable degree of unit proficiency, the wing limited\r\nthe monthly turnover of pilots to 25 percent. Like the division,\r\nthe wing employed split tours between an officer’s primary duty and\r\nstaff work to broaden his experience. In some cases the amount of\r\ntime required by administrative work as compared to a pilot’s actual\r\nflying time reduced his proficiency in the air. In June, Task Force 95\r\nreported that the proportionately large number of take-off and landing\r\naccidents on the carrier _Bataan_ was caused by the rapid turnover of\r\npilots and their need for frequent carrier qualification.[152]\r\n\r\n    [152] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, p. 10-198.\r\n\r\nA Marine pilot joining the wing could expect his assignment to last for\r\n6 to 9 months. Personnel in a nonflight status had longer tours of 10\r\nmonths to a year. Wing replacements were made on an individual basis,\r\nalthough there were plans that by mid-1953 a new policy of at least\r\npartial squadron replacement would be in effect. That 1st MAW squadrons\r\nwere able to operate effectively on an individual replacement system\r\nwas attributable to the peculiarity of combat conditions in Korea.\r\nAbsence of real enemy aerial opposition permitted the use of basic,\r\nparade-type flight formations and non-tactical approaches and attacks.\r\nAn unusually high-level of experienced pilots in each of the two wing\r\ngroups helped in the establishment of training programs and operational\r\ndoctrine. The FAF limitation of four aircraft per flight eliminated\r\nthe problem of large-scale, precombat squadron training as well as the\r\ndifficulty of controlling and coordinating a large number of planes in\r\na strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Logistical Operations, Summer 1952_[153]\r\n\r\n    [153] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: Selden, _Div Staff Rpt_; _PacFlt EvalRpts_\r\n          No. 4, Chap. 9, No. 5, Chap. 8; 1stMarDiv, 1st EngrBn\r\n          ComdDs, Jun-Jul 52.\r\n\r\nLogistical support of the division and wing remained largely unchanged\r\nthrough July. Several modifications did take place, however, and these\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n  (1) The change of responsibility for logistical support\r\n  of ground-based units in Korea from Commanding General,\r\n  2d Logistical Command to the Commanding General, Korean\r\n  Communication Zone (CG, KComZ).\r\n\r\n  (2) The opening of a pipeline system for resupply of aviation\r\n  fuel at K-3, beginning in May.\r\n\r\n  (3) The beginning of increased support for airbase maintenance at\r\n  those airfields housing Marine squadrons.\r\n\r\nResupply of common items used by both Marine and Army units was still\r\nbeing hampered by the Marines’ limited knowledge of the Army supply\r\nsystem in effect and by their inability to obtain the catalogues,\r\norders, and directives essential for requisitioning.\r\n\r\nTwo logistical operations, both of an engineering nature, took\r\nplace between May and July 1952 in western Korea. One was Operation\r\nTIMBER, undertaken to provide lumber required to complete the bunker\r\nconstruction on the JAMESTOWN, WYOMING, and KANSAS lines. The division\r\nhad estimated that three million linear feet of 4 x 8-inch timbers\r\nwould be needed. Since lumber in this amount was not available\r\nthrough supply channels or standing timber in the division sector,\r\nCorps assigned the Marines a wooded area 50 miles to the east in the\r\nU.S. 45th Infantry Division sector. On 12 May a reinforced engineer\r\nplatoon, under Second Lieutenant Roger E. Galliher, a truck platoon,\r\nand 500 Korean Service Corps (KSC) laborers,[154] began the cutting,\r\nprocessing, and hauling of timbers which were then trucked to the\r\nrailhead. Between 500 and 1,000 logs were cut daily. When the operation\r\nended in July a total of 35,194 sections of timber had been cut. This\r\nwas still not enough lumber to complete the required construction.\r\nEighth Army then made up the difference, mostly with 12 x 12-inch\r\ntimbers 30 feet long; these the Marine engineers cut to 4 x 8s for\r\nstandard bunker construction.[155]\r\n\r\n    [154] The KSC was a ROK quasi-military organization for\r\n          logistical support of the UNC. Personnel were drafted\r\n          from those rejected for Army service. Each KSC unit had\r\n          a cadre of ROK officers and enlisted. All types of labor\r\n          except personal services were performed by these Koreans.\r\n          During its period in western Korea, the 1st Marine\r\n          Division was supported by the 103d KSC Regiment of 5,222\r\n          men.

One reason for the\r\nprecautionary efforts taken to insure bridge security during the\r\nflood season was the potential damage the Chinese could cause. Since\r\nthey controlled the upriver area of the Imjin, before it entered the\r\ndivision sector, they could introduce floatable debris or explosives\r\ninto the swift running flood waters. Another major concern was the\r\nlogistical problem that would be faced by forward MLR units in event\r\nthe bridges became impassable and the enormous strain that would thus\r\nbe placed on helicopter resupply operations.\r\n\r\nThe I Corps directive specified that its divisions maintain a transport\r\ncapability that would enable medium tanks to pass safely over bridges\r\nspanning the major rivers in their I Corps sector. The order also\r\ncalled for the removal of debris that could cause damage to bridges.\r\nRemoval of those bridges vulnerable to flood conditions and the\r\nerection of emergency river spans were also to take place on corps\r\norder.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the I Corps operational order, General Seiden put the\r\ndivision’s own AMAZON plan into effect on 1 July. On this date\r\nCompanies A, B, and D of Lieutenant Colonel Harry D. Clarke’s 1st\r\nEngineer Battalion began extensive preparations for debris removal from\r\nthe four bridge sites in the division sector. Even before this, Marine\r\nengineers and shore party personnel had been trained at special schools\r\nto handle U.S. Army equipment provided for the AMAZON operation.[156]\r\n\r\n    [156] This included employment of the 60-inch searchlight\r\n          for night illumination, maintenance of boats for\r\n          debris removal, and operation of the M-4 ferry. Other\r\n          preparations by the division, of a non-engineer nature,\r\n          included positioning of 13,000 life-saving floatation\r\n          devices for use by frontline troops should they become\r\n          shut off from planned evacuation.\r\n\r\nBeginning 1 June, division engineers began blasting away at objects\r\nthat flood waters could loosen and carry into the bridge supports.\r\nBridge approaches were improved and their supports strengthened.\r\nEach company had a detail living at the bridge site for which it was\r\nresponsible. With the advent of heavy rains, these Marines were to\r\noperate 24-hour boat patrols to keep the river free of debris. The\r\nengineers were also to maintain a round-the-clock debris watch at the\r\nfour division bridges--Freedom Gate, or the Munsan-ni Railroad Bridge\r\nin the left regimental sector; Honker and X-Ray in the center; and\r\nfinally, Widgeon, very close to the Commonwealth boundary.\r\n\r\nHeavy rains began on 27 July and continued until the 30th. On the first\r\nday the decking of Widgeon Bridge was completely submerged and Honker\r\nwas removed to prevent its being carried away. Precipitation increased\r\non 28 July and reached its peak on 29 July when 3.66 inches of rainfall\r\nwere recorded. By the 30th, the rains had subsided but not before the\r\noverflowing Imjin had collapsed the X-Ray bridge. During the height of\r\nthe four flood days, engineers fought the rains, flooding waters, and\r\nfloating debris. The major effort took place downstream to save the\r\nFreedom Gate Bridge.\r\n\r\nAssigned personnel removed debris from the bridge supports, guided\r\nlarge, dangerous pieces away with poles, while upriver the boat teams\r\nblasted still larger sections into manageable chunks that would pass\r\nbetween the bridge supports. These engineer efforts, in addition to\r\nregular repair and maintenance of the large road net, constituted the\r\nmajor ground activity in the 1st Marine Division sector in late July.\r\nAugust would bring more rains and emergency demands on the engineers,\r\nbut the critical ground activity at that time would be directed against\r\nthe Communists in the area around Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Bunker Hill\r\n\r\n_The Participants and the Battlefield--Preliminary Action on\r\nSiberia--The Attack on Bunker Hill--Consolidating the Defense of Bunker\r\nHill--Company B Returns to Bunker Hill--Supporting Arms at Bunker\r\nHill--In Retrospect_\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Participants and the Battlefield_[157]\r\n\r\n    [157] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, Chap. 8; 1stMarDiv\r\n          ComdDs, Jul-Aug 52; 1stMar, 2/1, 3/1 ComdDs, Aug 52; 1st\r\n          MAW ComdD, Aug 52.\r\n\r\nThe torrential rains that had fallen just before the end of July\r\ncontinued to affect ground operations into early August. Contacts\r\nbetween opposing forces were few and brief, and casualties remained\r\ncorrespondingly low. On 1 August, General Selden assigned the reserve\r\nregiment, the 7th Marines, the task of developing the secondary defense\r\nline, KANSAS, at the extreme right of the division sector. The 5th\r\nMarines, manning this regimental area and originally responsible for\r\nthe construction, had been unable to reach the second line because\r\nbridging across the Imjin to the rear of the sector was washed out. By\r\n3 July the division put a ferry service into operation at the site of\r\nthe inoperable Honker Bridge for the purpose of feeding ammunition to\r\ncombat units north of the Imjin. The critical resupply problem began\r\nto ease the next day when the waters overflowing the Widgeon Bridge\r\nfurther upstream receded sufficiently to permit restoration of normal\r\nvehicular crossings there.\r\n\r\nTraffic in the air had, quite naturally, been less affected by the\r\nheavy rains and by the flooded, mucky terrain that was slowing ground\r\nmovement throughout the entire division area. Flight operations during\r\nthe first week of August produced a daily sortie rate that would\r\napproximate the monthly average. In fact, the month of August was to\r\nbecome the record one for 1st MAW attack and fighter pilots during\r\n1952, with a total of 5,869 sorties flown.\r\n\r\nWhile the air people in August were maintaining a good weather pace\r\nagainst the enemy following the July downpours, the Communist ground\r\ntroops apparently found the going too difficult to mount any sustained\r\nattack. The enemy merely continued his active defense, with an average\r\nof two contacts daily, while busily engaged in advancing his OPLR\r\nby creeping tactics. Even the usually assiduous Chinese artillery\r\nwas strangely quiet. With respect to the enemy’s excellent artillery\r\ncapability, the 1st Marine Division in July learned that the Chinese\r\nhad introduced a 132mm Russian rocket in their combat operations. The\r\npresence of this truck-mounted launcher, the _Katusha_, which could\r\nfire 16 rockets simultaneously, was indicated by a POW who had been\r\ninformed by “his platoon leader that there were two _Katusha_ regiments\r\nin the CCF.”[158] In addition to this new enemy weapon, the Marine\r\ndivision reported the same month that positive sightings had been\r\nmade of self-propelled guns emplaced well forward, and that there was\r\nan “indication that these guns were being used to fire direct fire\r\nmissions from frontline revetments.”[159]\r\n\r\n    [158] 1stMarDiv ComdD, Jul 52, p. 2.\r\n\r\n    [159] _Ibid._, p. 1.\r\n\r\nCommunist forward positions were gradually encroaching on JAMESTOWN.\r\nSince April 1952 the division had noted every month that the enemy\r\nwas continuing to extend his trenches in the direction of the Marine\r\nMLR. The Chinese technique was to occupy key, high terrain at night,\r\nprepare the ground during darkness by digging trenches and constructing\r\nbunkers, and then vacate the area before daybreak. After nightly\r\nrepetitions of this process had produced a tenable position, the\r\nenemy moved in and occupied it. By means of these creeping tactics,\r\nthe Chinese hoped to acquire the dominating terrain necessary for\r\ncontrolling access to Seoul. The ultimate goal of the Communist forces\r\nwas believed to be the 750-foot-high Paekhak Hill,[160] the Marine high\r\nground position also known as Hill 229, just over a mile east of the\r\nroad leading to Panmunjom and Kaesong.\r\n\r\n    [160] CG, I Corps msg to CG, 1stMarDiv, dtd 18 Jun 52, in\r\n          1stMarDiv ComdD, Jun 52, App. I, p. 5.\r\n\r\nDuring the four months that the 1st Marine Division’s mission had been\r\nto conduct an aggressive defense of the EUSAK left flank, Marines\r\nhad become familiar with a number of Chinese small unit infantry\r\ntactics. Shortly after assignment of the division to western Korea,\r\nGeneral Twining, the ADC, had observed that the Chinese first made a\r\ndiversionary frontal assault while the main force maneuvered around\r\nUNC defenders to attack from the rear. Almost invariably the Chinese\r\nemployed this envelopment technique. Occasionally the enemy also used\r\nmore passive measures, such as attempting to demoralize Marines in the\r\nfront lines and subvert their allegiance by English language propaganda\r\nbroadcasts. These attempts represented wasted effort. Not one Marine\r\nwas swayed.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the Chinese were imaginative in changing their tactics or\r\nimprovising new ones. This tendency had been noted as early as May by a\r\n5th Marines battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Nihart, after 1/5\r\nhad engaged the enemy in a limited, objective attack:\r\n\r\n  ... when friendlies marked targets with WP [white phosphorus],\r\n  the enemy would immediately drop rounds of WP between the target\r\n  and friendly troops to conceal the target and to confuse friendly\r\n  FOs [artillery forward observers]; the enemy tried very hard\r\n  to take prisoners (rather than shoot a friendly, they would\r\n  often attempt to knock him out with a concussion type grenade);\r\n  counterattacks were made in waves of four to seven men deployed\r\n  in a formation somewhat similar to the Marine Corps wedge;\r\n  snipers were deployed in holes that were mutually supporting;\r\n  concerted efforts were made to knock out automatic weapons; ...\r\n  for close-in fighting, the enemy used PPSH [Soviet-made 7.62mm\r\n  submachine gun] guns and grenades rather than bayonets; the enemy\r\n  attacked behind well coordinated mortar fire; some enemy snipers\r\n  were observed to have bushes tied to their backs....[161]\r\n\r\n    [161] 1/5 ComdD, May 52, p. 12.\r\n\r\nOn occasion 1st Division Marines found evidence that the enemy\r\nhad infiltrated their lines. It appeared the most likely spot for\r\nline-crossers to make their way into the Marine rear area was from the\r\nfar bank of the Imjin between the Sachon and Han Rivers where the enemy\r\nMLR was only a short distance from the sector held by the 1st Amphibian\r\nTractor Battalion. Two enemy agents “armed with pistols of German\r\nmanufacture, six hand grenades, and one set of field glasses”[162] had\r\nbeen apprehended here by a Marine reconnaissance company patrol. The\r\nprisoners had stated they were “part of a force of one thousand men\r\nwho were infiltrating to form a guerrilla force somewhere in South\r\nKorea.”[163] Six days later, after a brief fire fight between a small\r\ngroup of Chinese and a Marine outpost in the center of the division\r\nsector, the defenders discovered that two of the three enemy dead wore\r\nunder their own clothing various articles of Marine uniforms. Neither\r\nof the Chinese had identification or any papers whatsoever. It was\r\nbelieved that both were enemy agents and that the attack on the outpost\r\nwas a diversion “for the express purpose of detracting attention from\r\ninfiltrators.”[164]\r\n\r\n    [162] HqBn, 1stMarDiv ComdD, May 52, p. 27.\r\n\r\n    [163] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n    [164] 1stMarDiv ComdD, Jun 52, p. 5.\r\n\r\nEven though enemy tactics and attempts to penetrate Marine positions\r\ndemonstrated a good deal of soldierly skills, his conduct of defensive\r\noperations was nothing short of masterful. This was especially true of\r\nChinese construction of underground earthworks. It appeared that the\r\nChinese had no single pattern for this type of field fortification.\r\nLike the Japanese in World War II, the Chinese Communists were experts\r\nin organizing the ground thoroughly and in utilizing a seemingly\r\ninexhaustible supply of manpower to hollow out tunnels, air-raid\r\nshelters, living quarters, storage spaces, and mess halls. Americans\r\ndescribed the Chinese as industrious diggers,[165] who excavated\r\nquickly and deeply for protection against UN bombardments. From\r\nnumerous reports of ground clashes in the 1st Marine Division sector\r\nand from observations made by Marine pilots, it became known that the\r\nenemy was quick to seek cover whenever he was exposed to sustained\r\nartillery bombardment or air attack.\r\n\r\n    [165] “The Chinese attack by ‘shovel’ proved effective and\r\n          difficult to combat. They burrowed forward almost\r\n          continuously, even under direct observation. Every foot\r\n          of advance provided added opportunity to attack Marine\r\n          COPs with greater impunity. While this activity possibly\r\n          provided Marines with target practice in both small arms\r\n          and mortars, these CCF working parties in a narrow trench\r\n          7 to 10-feet deep probably took very few casualties.” Col\r\n          William R. Watson, Jr. ltr to Hd, HistBr, G-3 Div, HQMC,\r\n          dtd 18 July 67.\r\n\r\nWhat was not known, however, was the extent of these subterranean\r\nshelters. One Chinese account, allegedly written by a reconnaissance\r\nstaff officer named Li Yo-Yang, described the protection of a CCF\r\nshelter to a recently captured UN prisoner as they were under Allied\r\nartillery bombardment. While shells exploded all around the position\r\nthe enemy boasted: “There’s no danger of being killed on a position\r\nfortified by the Chinese People’s Volunteers.... Don’t you know it’s\r\nimpossible for your shells to penetrate our air-raid shelters?”[166] An\r\nAmerican report on enemy field fortifications estimated that the amount\r\nof earth cover in Chinese air-raid shelters was as high as 20 feet, and\r\nin frontline defensive positions, up to 33 feet.[167]\r\n\r\n    [166] _A Volunteer Soldier’s Day: Recollections by Men of the\r\n          Chinese People’s Volunteers in the War to Resist U.S.\r\n          Aggression and Aid Korea_ (Peking: Foreign Languages\r\n          Press, 1961), p. 193, hereafter CPV, _Recollections_.\r\n\r\n    [167] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, p. 8-90.\r\n\r\nMarine defensive installations carved out of the ground were not so\r\nextensive as those of the enemy opposing JAMESTOWN. “In spite of\r\norders, instructions, and inspections many bunkers were only half dug\r\nin, then built up above the ground with sandbags,” observed one Marine\r\nbattalion commander.[168] Back in April, just after the Marine division\r\nhad settled in the west, its 1st Engineer Battalion, using U.S. Army\r\ndrawings, had published bunker construction plans. Express instructions\r\nto frontline units were to “construct bunkers to provide simultaneously\r\nliving and fighting space. Overhead cover on all bunkers will be such\r\nas to withstand direct hit from 105mm and to allow friendly VT fire\r\nover position.”[169]\r\n\r\n    [168] LtCol Roy J. Batterton, Jr., “Random Notes on Korea,”\r\n          _Marine Corps Gazette_, v. 39, no. 11 (Nov 55), p. 29,\r\n          hereafter Batterton, _Korea Notes_.\r\n\r\n    [169] CO 5thMar msg to 5thMar units, dtd 20 Apr 52, in 5thMar\r\n          ComdD, Apr 52, #2, App. II, p. 6.\r\n\r\nSome officers felt it was, perhaps, the work-during-light,\r\npatrol-at-night routine that resulted in the shallow draft Marine\r\nbunkers. Others suggested that the relatively limited defensive\r\ntraining received by the more offensive-minded Marines created a\r\nnatural apathy to digging elaborate fighting positions.\r\n\r\nIt took a hole 12 feet square and 7 feet deep to house the Army,\r\nLincoln-logs-type bunker the Marines first used in the spring of 1952.\r\nThe fortification, using tree trunks up to eight inches in diameter,\r\nhad a cover of seven to eight feet. This consisted of four feet of\r\nlogs, and three-to-four more feet of rocks, sandbags, and earth fill.\r\nBy the summer of 1952, the division developed its own style of bunker,\r\na prefabricated timber structure designed to fit into a hole eight feet\r\nsquare and somewhat less than seven feet deep. This size fortification\r\ncould accommodate a .50 caliber machine gun, crew members, or several\r\nriflemen. Provision was also made for the inclusion of a sleeping shelf\r\nin the rear of the bunker. Its construction required no saws, hammers,\r\nor nails, only shovels to excavate. The major drawback to erection of\r\nthe prefab was the difficulty in manhandling the heavy roofing timbers,\r\n11 feet long, 12 inches wide, and 4 inches thick. On top of this was\r\nplaced a two-foot layer of sandbags, tarpaper covering, and a four feet\r\nhigh layer of earth that completed the structure and partly camouflaged\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBattlefield construction was carried out by the infantry regiments to\r\nthe limit of unit capabilities. The division engineers, one company per\r\nfrontline regiment, augmented at times by shore party units, supplied\r\nthe technical know-how and engineering materials and equipment. These\r\ncombat support troops processed the lumber for bunker construction and\r\nbuilt fortifications for forward medical treatment and one bunker for\r\nobservation of battle action by civilian and military dignitaries,\r\nirreverently called VIPs (Very Important Persons), who frequently\r\nvisited the division. Engineers also erected some of the barbed wire\r\nbarriers in the forward areas and, when necessary, cleared firing lanes\r\nfor weapons housed in bunkers.\r\n\r\nThe processing of timbers for easier and faster bunker-construction had\r\nbegun on 28 July, but this was hardly in time for the most difficult\r\nfighting the division had faced thus far in western Korea. Given the\r\nname Bunker Hill,[170] this battle would take place in the center\r\nsector of the division line manned since 27 July by Colonel Walter F.\r\nLayer’s 1st Marines.[171] On that date Lieutenant Colonel Armitage’s\r\nbattalion, 3/1, took over from the 3d Battalion, 7th Marines on the\r\nleft, and 2/1 (Lieutenant Colonel Roy J. Batterton, Jr.) relieved the\r\n2d Battalion of the 7th Marines on the right.[172]\r\n\r\n    [170] Since bunkers were in everyone’s mind and frontline units\r\n          were heavily involved in the bunker-construction program,\r\n          it is felt likely “someone in G-2 arbitrarily assigned\r\n          the name.” Col Gerald T. Armitage ltr to Hd, HistBr, G-3\r\n          Div, HQMC, dtd 6 July 67, hereafter _Armitage ltr._\r\n\r\n    [171] Two days earlier Colonel Layer had taken over the command\r\n          from Colonel Flournoy.\r\n\r\n    [172] Lieutenant Colonels Gerald F. Russell and Anthony Caputo,\r\n          respectively, commanded 3/7 and 2/7 at this time.\r\n\r\nAcross No-Man’s-Land, units of two Chinese divisions faced the\r\n3,603 men of the 1st Marines. From west to east opposite the Marine\r\nregiment’s frontline battalions were elements of the 580th Regiment,\r\n194th Division, 65th CCF Army and of both the 352d and 354th Regiments,\r\n118th Division, 40th CCF Army. The 352d Regiment held most of the area\r\non which the battle would be fought.[173] Enemy combat efficiency\r\nwas rated as excellent and his forward units were well-supplied. The\r\nChinese conducted an active defense, using limited objective attacks,\r\nnumerous small-size probes, and creeping tactics to extend their\r\nOPLR line. Communist soldiers offered well-coordinated and tenacious\r\nresistance to Marine patrols, raids, and attacks. Within enemy lines a\r\n775-foot elevation, known as Taedok-san, was situated directly north of\r\nthe Marine division center and commanded the entire Bunker Hill area.\r\n\r\n    [173] 1stMarDiv PIR 657, dtd 13 Aug 52.\r\n\r\nOn JAMESTOWN, the dominating height was Hill 201, 660 feet high[174]\r\nand immediately to the rear of the MLR in the left battalion sector.\r\nSouthwest of this elevation was the Marine stronghold, Hill 229, just\r\n23 feet lower than Taedok, and believed by the Marines to have been the\r\nobjective of the August battle. Directly north of Hill 201 was Hill\r\n122, adjacent to the enemy OPLR, and called Bunker Hill by the Marines.\r\nIt was shortly to become the scene of bitter fighting. The crest of\r\nHill 122 was about 350 yards long. At a distance of about 700 yards, it\r\ngenerally paralleled the northeast-southwest direction of JAMESTOWN in\r\nthe left of the 2/1 sector and adjoining 3/1 sector.\r\n\r\n    [174] Frequently cartographers use elevations for names of\r\n          hills. Heights on the Korean maps are in meters, and\r\n          many of these hills derive their name (i.e., number)\r\n          from their elevation. For changing meters to feet, the\r\n          conversion factor 3.28 is used.\r\n\r\nSouthwest of Bunker and a little more than 200 yards from the Marine\r\nMLR was Hill 124. This Hill 124–122 axis, for tactical purposes, was\r\nknown as the Bunker Ridge. The ridgeline, roughly “cashew” in shape\r\nalmost anchored back into the MLR on the forward slopes of Hill 229.\r\nTo the northeast of Bunker Hill and separated from it by a wide\r\nsaddle[175] was another enemy position, Hill 120. (See Map 9, for\r\noutposts and key hill positions in the 1st Marines center regimental\r\narea in early August.)\r\n\r\n    [175] A saddle, the low point in the crest line of a ridge, is\r\n          much in appearance like the side view of a riding saddle.\r\n\r\nApproximately one mile east of Hill 124 was Hill 56A, or Samoa, the\r\nright flank limit of the immediate battlefield. It guarded the best\r\navenue of approach into the Bunker Hill area, the Changdan Road.\r\nAnother Marine position west of Samoa was Hill 58A, or Siberia, a\r\nsentinel overlooking a long draw running down the east sides of Hills\r\n122 and 120. Both Samoa and Siberia were outposted by squads. Another\r\n1st Marines squad occupied Hill 52, on the other side of Changdan Road\r\nand not quite a half-mile east of Samoa. The entire battlefield was cut\r\nup by numerous gullies and draws, most of which paralleled Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 9      K. White\r\n\r\n1ST MARINES SECTOR OF JAMESTOWN\r\n\r\n(Division Center)\r\n\r\n8 AUGUST 1952]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preliminary Action on Siberia_[176]\r\n\r\n    [176] Unless otherwise noted, the material for this section\r\n          is derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdD, Aug 52; 1stMarDiv G-3\r\n          Jnls, 9–11 Aug 52; 1stMar, 1/1, 2/1, 3/1 ComdDs, Aug 52.\r\n\r\nThe first round in the battle of Bunker Hill began as the fight for\r\nSiberia, Hill 58A. Just slightly more than a quarter of a mile from\r\nJAMESTOWN, this squad-size outpost, the most western in the right\r\nbattalion sector, had been occupied in June when the division moved\r\nits MLR forward. Since Siberia was located halfway between the Marine\r\nMLR and the Communist OPLR, the Marine seizure of Siberia prevented\r\nthe Chinese from holding terrain suitable for employing 60mm mortars\r\nagainst Marine frontline troops.[177] Strong enemy outposts on Hills\r\n120 to the north and 110 to the northeast constantly threatened the\r\nsquad on 58A. From these two forward positions, Chinese troops early on\r\n9 August 1952 streamed down to Siberia, launching in the process the\r\nBunker Hill battle.\r\n\r\n    [177] 1stMarDiv ComdD, Aug 52, App. VII, p. 1.\r\n\r\nJust before 0100 an estimated four enemy squads fell upon Hill 58A,\r\noutposted by Company E Marines. Using assorted infantry weapons, the\r\nraiding party forced the outnumbered Siberia occupants to withdraw.\r\nBy 0145 the outpost Marines returned to the MLR. At this time the\r\nJAMESTOWN sector south of the outpost, also held by Captain Jesse F.\r\nThorpe’s Company E, was under attack by approximately 50 Chinese.\r\n\r\nAfter breaking up the enemy assault by well placed friendly mortar\r\nfire, the Marines enjoyed a brief respite from Chinese pressure and\r\nformulated plans to recapture Siberia. It was decided that a reinforced\r\nCompany E platoon would counterattack to regain the outpost. At 0355,\r\nthe 11th Marines fired a five-minute preparation against the objective.\r\nOn schedule, the platoon crossed JAMESTOWN at 0400 and in the darkness\r\nheaded towards the outpost. Advancing carefully to avoid detection as\r\nlong as possible, the Marines reached the area near the base of the\r\nhill by 0525. Heavy enemy artillery and mortar fire again forced the\r\nMarines to withdraw, and the platoon returned to its company CP at\r\n0545. So far, the 58A action had resulted in the wounding of 32 Marines\r\nand the killing of another.\r\n\r\nIt became evident that more preparation, by Marine air and artillery,\r\nwould be required for the recapture of Siberia. At 0650, four Marine\r\nF9F jet fighters worked the hill over with napalm and 500-pound\r\nbombs. Three hours later, a flight of Air Force F-80 “Shooting Star”\r\njets dropped eight 1,000-pound bombs on the same target. With the\r\naerial attack complete, Marine artillery opened fire. Five minutes\r\nlater another Marine reinforced platoon launched a second ground\r\nattack. This was made by a unit from Company A (Captain Robert W.\r\nJudson) of the regimental reserve battalion, supported by a Company E\r\nplatoon. Again the Marines advanced to the open sector south of the\r\nhill before the enemy reacted. As before, the Chinese response was\r\na devastating barrage from their supporting weapons. The stubborn\r\nMarine assault against Siberia brought down the full weight of Chinese\r\nfirepower--rifle, machine gun, and hand grenades--but the attack force\r\nwould not be beaten off. At 1103 the Siberia hill again belonged to the\r\nMarines. Quickly the Company A platoon began to organize a defense to\r\nrepulse the Chinese counterattack, which was certain to come.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of a prompt and violent retaliation by the Chinese,\r\nand to help the speedily improvised defense efforts, the 2/1\r\nbattalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Batterton, had sent forward\r\nthe supporting platoon from Company E. This reinforcing unit reached\r\nSiberia within seven minutes after the Marine attackers had gained\r\npossession of the objective. The new arrivals scarcely had time to dig\r\nin before a hail of mortar and artillery shells forced all the Marines\r\nto seek cover in a defiladed position on the southern side of the\r\nslope. From here, the 2/1 force directed counter mortar and artillery\r\nfire onto the top and far side of Siberia and unleashed their own\r\nassault weapons against the Chinese soldiers pressing for possession of\r\nSiberia. By midafternoon, with heavy enemy counterfire on the position\r\nand their casualties reaching nearly 75 percent, the Marines were\r\nforced to withdraw and return to their own lines. The hill had changed\r\nhands twice and the enemy had employed 5,000 rounds of artillery in the\r\ncontested ownership.\r\n\r\nBadly mauled by two actions against Hill 58A, Company E came off the\r\nlines to reorganize, exchanging positions with Company A, of Lieutenant\r\nColonel Louis N. King’s 1st Battalion. About this time Company C, less\r\none platoon, had moved from the 1/1 rear area forward to an assembly\r\npoint behind 2/1 in preparation for a night counterattack to retake\r\nthe now battle-scarred outpost. Without the customary artillery\r\npreparation, the attacking force at 2245 crossed the MLR at a point\r\ndirectly south of the former outpost Samoa, which had been abandoned\r\nearlier when Siberia fell. Working their way northwest towards Siberia,\r\nthe Company C Marines, commanded by Captain Casimir C. Ksycewski,\r\ncautiously approached the assault line. Reaching it at 0105 on 10\r\nAugust the force deployed immediately and rushed the objective.\r\n\r\nAt about this time the Chinese defenders opened fire but could not halt\r\nthe assaulting Marines. The struggle to regain the Siberia objective\r\nwas fierce; some of the Chinese refused to yield and fought to their\r\ndeath. Most, however, held their defense positions only briefly before\r\nretiring to the refuge offered by the reverse slope of the hill.\r\nGaining the crest of Hill 58A at 0116, the Company C commander ordered\r\na platoon to the other side of the objective to dispatch remaining\r\nelements of the enemy force. The resulting fire fight lasted nearly\r\nfour hours. At daybreak, however, the enemy, in estimated company\r\nstrength, strenuously renewed his counterfire and, for a third time,\r\nforced the 1st Marines to retire from the disputed hill and return to\r\nthe main line.\r\n\r\nLater that day, at the regimental CP, Colonel Layer called a staff\r\nconference to decide on the best course of action. Successive Marine\r\nwithdrawals had been caused by the intense enemy shelling. The key to\r\nits effectiveness was the observation provided the Chinese from Hills\r\n122 and 110. Heavy enemy fire had also caused most of the casualties,\r\n17 killed and 243 wounded, in 1st Marine ranks. It was decided to\r\nshift the battle area to better restrict this enemy capability not\r\nonly to observe Marine troop movements but also to call down accurate\r\nfire on friendly attacking units. Bunker Hill, an enemy outpost west\r\nof Siberia, was selected. In the eyes of 1st Marines tacticians,\r\npossession of Hill 122 instead of Hill 58A presented three major\r\nadvantages:\r\n\r\n  Hill 122 offered excellent observation into the rear of enemy\r\n  outposts;\r\n\r\n  Possession of Hill 122 would greatly strengthen the MLR in the\r\n  regimental sector, effectively neutralize Siberia, provide\r\n  dominating terrain that was more defensible than 58A; and\r\n\r\n  Bunker offered an excellent opportunity for an attack employing\r\n  the element of surprise against the enemy.\r\n\r\nTo help preserve this tactical surprise, the plan for the Bunker Hill\r\nattack included a diversionary attack against Siberia. Making this\r\nsecondary effort would be a reinforced rifle platoon and a composite\r\nunit of gun and flame tanks. For the main attack, Lieutenant Colonel\r\nBatterton’s 2d Battalion would employ a reinforced rifle company with\r\nsupporting artillery and armor, if needed. The operation was to be\r\nconducted at night, to further ensure the opportunity for tactical\r\nsurprise. For the same reason, the attack was not to be preceded by\r\nartillery preparation on either objective. To the right of the 1st\r\nMarines, however, Colonel Culhane’s 5th Marines would support the\r\ndiversion by artillery and tank fire placed on enemy strongpoints in\r\nthe Ungok area, about 1¼ miles northeast of Siberia. During daylight,\r\nair, artillery, and tanks attacked targets on both 122 and 58A.\r\nPriority of effort in the 1st Marines area went to units preparing for\r\nthe Siberia-Bunker offensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Attack on Bunker Hill_[178]\r\n\r\n    [178] Unless otherwise noted, the material for this section is\r\n          derived from: Encl (1) to CG, FMFPac ltr 0762/161 over A9\r\n          to CMC, dtd 25 Nov 52, Subj: “Summary of 1stMarDiv Sit\r\n          from 20 July-20 Oct 52,” hereafter FMFPac, _1stMarDiv\r\n          Sum, Jul-Oct 52_; 1stMarDiv, 1stMar, 2/1, 1st TkBn\r\n          ComdDs, Aug 52.\r\n\r\nAt dusk on 11 August, 1,000 yards behind the MLR in the western sector\r\nof the 2/1 line, the eight Company C tanks that were to provide much\r\nof the diversionary effort at Hill 58A moved out of their assembly\r\narea. Leading the column east of the MSR, Changdan Road, were four M-46\r\nmediums, mounting 90mm guns. They were followed by an equal number\r\nof flame vehicles. Each M-46 was specially equipped with an 18-inch\r\nfighting light, actually a searchlight with a shutter over the lens, to\r\nbe used for battlefield illumination. The flame vehicles, World War II\r\nM4A3E8 mediums, mounted a 105mm howitzer in addition to the flame tube.\r\nAs the tanks reached the Changdan Road, they turned north, crossed the\r\nMLR, and proceeded to preselected positions. (See Map 10.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 10      K. WHITE\r\n\r\n2/1 SECTOR\r\n\r\n9–11 AUGUST 1952]\r\n\r\nWhen the M-46 gun tanks were in position to fire on Siberia and its\r\nflanks, their powerful 90s opened up on the objective. At this time,\r\n2110, the first section of flames (two tanks) made its way along the\r\nstream bed between the MLR and Hill 56A (Samoa). Lighting their way\r\nwith very short bursts of flame, the two tanks advanced in this manner\r\nto the base of Hill 58A. There the vehicles paused momentarily, then\r\nbegan to move up the near slope, using longer spurts of flame to sear\r\nthe ground and sparse vegetation to the crest of the position. The gun\r\ntanks, in the meantime, had shifted their fire from Siberia northeast\r\nto neutralize Hill 110. When the flame vehicles reached the top of\r\nSiberia, they lumbered down the far slope, firing then in shorter\r\nbursts and sweeping the area with machine guns to discourage any enemy\r\ninfantry interference.\r\n\r\nWith some fuel reserved to light their way on the return trip, the\r\nflame section reversed its course from the far side of the objective,\r\nmounted the crest, and clanked back to the Changdan Road. When the\r\nfirst section had returned, the second departed, completing its mission\r\nin much the same manner. Tank personnel of both groups observed that\r\nthe enemy artillery and mortar fire was medium to heavy on Siberia.\r\nSome rifle fire was also received. Gun tanks, firing from Changdan Road\r\neast of Siberia, experienced less fire from the Chinese.\r\n\r\nAlthough the flame vehicles had completed their mission and were on\r\ntheir way home, the M-46s remained on position in support of the 3d\r\nPlatoon, Company D which, at 2230, was advancing from the MLR to\r\ncomplete the infantry part of the diversion. Staying out of the low\r\nground that the tanks had used, the platoon swept over Hill 56A at 2255\r\nand immediately struck out for the further objective, Hill 58A. Gun\r\ntanks firing their 90s on the Chinese OPLR on Hill 110 and on Siberia\r\nilluminated the target area with their fighting lights, the shutter\r\nof which the tankers flicked open and closed during each five-second\r\ninterval that the light remained on.\r\n\r\nLess than an hour after crossing JAMESTOWN, the platoon from Captain\r\nGeorge W. Campbell’s Company D reported the capture of Siberia. The\r\nenemy quickly made his presence felt at the objective; a half hour\r\nbefore midnight, he assaulted the hill in reinforced platoon strength.\r\nTen minutes later the Chinese withdrew and the Company D Marines, in\r\naccordance with their battle plan, did likewise. At about the same\r\ntime the 5th Marines, having completed its part in the diversion, also\r\nsecured from the operation.\r\n\r\nTen minutes after the diversionary infantry had cleared Samoa while\r\nenroute to Siberia, the main attack force, Company B, which had come\r\nunder operational control of 2/1 at 1800, crossed the MLR, the line of\r\ndeparture. Moving at a fast pace to preserve the element of anticipated\r\nsurprise, the attack force, commanded by Captain Sereno S. Scranton,\r\nJr., soon deployed two squads of the lead platoon against the near side\r\nof the hill. By 2318 on 11 August the squads were moving up Bunker Hill\r\nand, 10 minutes later, one platoon had gained the top of the objective\r\nand one was at the base of the hill, both moving northward along the\r\nforward slope. As the advancing units neared the end of their sweep\r\nforward, they began to come under small amounts of rifle fire from\r\nthe front and left flank of the position.[179] The Company B platoons\r\ncontinued to advance, returning well-placed small arms fire.\r\n\r\n    [179] Recalling the Marine seizure of Bunker, the G-3,\r\n          1stMarDiv at that time expressed the view that “taking\r\n          these places was easy but holding them under heavy\r\n          Chinese artillery and mortar fire was extremely costly.\r\n          Our counterbattery fire was ineffective because we were\r\n          limited to from one to eight rounds per tube per day,\r\n          depending on the weapon, by Army order, because of\r\n          an ammunition shortage.” Col Russell E. Honsowetz MS\r\n          comments, dtd 15 Jun 67, hereafter _Honsowetz ltr II_.\r\n\r\nSoon the intensity of Chinese small arms fire increased; at the same\r\ntime enemy mortars and artillery opened up on the company. Marines\r\nattempting to assault the top of Hill 122 also came under a hail of\r\nhand grenades hurled by the staunch Chinese defenders. After a brief\r\nbut vicious fight at point-blank range, the Chinese gave ground on the\r\neastern side, heading uphill. Several Marines pursued the fleeing enemy\r\nto the summit, then joined the rest of the assault units of Company B\r\nin organizing a defense. By 0300, 12 August the battle had quieted down\r\nand for a short while all firing ceased. Then, as the Marines began to\r\ndig in, a bypassed pocket of enemy resistance came to life. Two fire\r\nteams in the 1st Platoon took these Chinese Communists under fire.\r\n\r\nEven as the fighting continued, Marines and KSC personnel were hauling\r\nfortification materials towards Bunker to consolidate the precarious\r\nfoothold. For a while, enemy mortars unleashed a heavy fire against\r\nthe newly won position, but by 0230 Company B was able to report that\r\nenemy shelling had stopped and that the objective was in friendly\r\nhands. A new fire fight broke out at 0345 between a small force of\r\nenemy soldiers occupying a draw forward of Bunker Hill and Marines\r\nnearby. The exchange of fire continued for nearly two hours, but short\r\nof harassing the Marines on Bunker Hill the enemy did not launch\r\na counterattack. Dawn on 12 August revealed that thus far in the\r\nBunker Hill fighting 1 Marine of Company B had been killed and 22 were\r\nwounded. The earlier diversionary attack on Siberia had resulted in\r\nonly one Marine casualty, the wounding of the platoon commander, Second\r\nLieutenant James W. Dion.\r\n\r\nPersonnel losses were kept to a minimum by the well-organized medical\r\nsupport and the efficient service of medical and evacuation personnel.\r\nA forward aid station was established in the vicinity of the Company\r\nE CP. Casualties that were not ambulatory arrived at this two-bunker\r\ninstallation usually by hand litter, other wounded men were transported\r\nin armored personnel carriers, U.S. Army tracked vehicles similar in\r\nappearance to the Marine LVT, that had accompanied the diversionary\r\nunit and were part of the Panmunjom rescue force stationed in the\r\narea of COP 2 on the 3/1 left flank. Wounded Marines were examined\r\nimmediately. Minor injury cases were treated and discharged; more\r\nseriously injured personnel were given emergency treatment and\r\nevacuated. Movement to the rear was accomplished by ambulance jeeps.\r\nHelicopters, landing only 30 yards from the station, flew out the\r\ncritically wounded. A sandbag-protected squad tent was used to house\r\ncasualties waiting to be examined. This emergency aid station closed\r\ndown on 13 August, when action in the right battalion sector diminished.\r\n\r\nEven though the remainder of the morning of 12 August was practically\r\nfree of any retaliatory attempts by the Chinese against Bunker Hill,\r\nthe Marines occupying the new position were not idle, for they\r\nanticipated an immediate and severe reaction for capturing the hill.\r\nQuickly, but methodically, the company dug in. At noon, regiment\r\npassed to 3/1[180] the responsibility for Bunker Hill and operational\r\ncontrol of Company B. Consolidation of Hill 122 continued until about\r\n1500, when the Marines were forced to put down their entrenching tools\r\nand grab their rifles instead. The Chinese had suddenly launched an\r\nintense mortar and artillery attack against the hill. Defending Marines\r\nexpected to see enemy soldiers start up the western slopes at any\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n    [180] Initially the diversionary attack against Siberia and\r\n          subsequent assault against Bunker had been made by\r\n          Marines of 2/1 since Siberia was in the 2/1 sector. On\r\n          12 August operational control was transferred to 3/1\r\n          as the fighting continued at Bunker, in the area of\r\n          responsibility of the left battalion sector.\r\n\r\nActually, more than an hour elapsed before the Communists initiated\r\ntheir first main ground attack to regain Bunker. By that time, heavy\r\ncasualties from the continued shelling had forced Company B to pull\r\nback from the ridge and take up positions on the reverse (eastern)\r\nslope of Bunker Hill. At this point, with reduced Company B forces\r\nand with no radio communication between Captain Scranton’s unit and\r\n3/1, Lieutenant Colonel Armitage sent I/3/1,[181] under Captain Howard\r\nJ. Connolly, forward from the MLR. Shortly before 1600, a force of\r\nmore than 350 Chinese lunged out of the low ground of Hill 123, west\r\nof Bunker, to attack defensive positions along the ridge between\r\nHills 124–122. Striking in rapid succession first the west side and\r\nthen the northern end of the Company B position to find a weak spot\r\nin the defense, the enemy counterattack finally concentrated on the\r\nsouthwestern part of the hill.\r\n\r\n    [181] From the division reserve, Captain Anthony J. Skotnicki’s\r\n          company, I/3/7, was en route to take over the I/3/1\r\n          sector. As an interim measure, Captain Byron J.\r\n          Melancon’s Company H extended its MLR positions to the\r\n          right to cover the Company I area.\r\n\r\nAn intense exchange of fire raged here until 1715, when the defending\r\nfire of Company B plus the added weight of the Company I reinforcements\r\ncombined to stall the enemy advance. Having failed to gain their\r\nobjective, the Communists abruptly broke off their artillery and mortar\r\nfire and ordered their infantry to withdraw. They pulled back only to\r\nthe far side of the hill, however. By 1740 the enemy was occupying his\r\nnew post on the northern slope, while the Marines continued to hold\r\ntheir positions on the reverse slope of Bunker Ridge. Enemy supporting\r\nfires had lifted and a lull ensued in the fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Consolidating the Defense of Bunker Hill_[182]\r\n\r\n    [182] Unless otherwise noted, the material for this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdD, Aug 52; 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl,\r\n          12–13 Aug 52; 1stMar, 1/1, 3/1 ComdDs, Aug 52.\r\n\r\nEven before the Chinese had made their coordinated attack against Hill\r\n122 in the midafternoon of the 12th, the 1st Marines had implemented\r\na plan of action to assure that the critical position would remain\r\nin Marine hands. In addition to the movement of Company I/3/1 to\r\nreinforce Bunker Hill and of Company I/3/7 as its relief on the MLR,\r\na precautionary displacement was also made of the 3/1 reconnaissance\r\nplatoon to Hill 124 to tie in that terrain feature with both Bunker\r\nand JAMESTOWN and thus consolidate the defense north of the MLR and\r\nwest of Bunker. (See Map 11.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 11      K. WHITE\r\n\r\nBUNKER HILL AREA\r\n\r\n2300, 12 AUGUST 1952]\r\n\r\nOther activities behind the line aimed at making the Marine position\r\non the newly seized hill more tenable. As one step in this direction,\r\nGeneral Selden shifted most of his reserve into the zone of action.\r\nBefore the end of the day remaining units of 3/7 were placed under\r\noperational control of 3/1, and 2/7 was attached to Colonel Layer’s\r\nreserve. The 7th Marines was directed to place its 4.2-inch mortars\r\non call to the 1st Marines. Priority of artillery support went to the\r\nBunker Hill regiment. Within the 1st Marines, the regimental commander\r\nmoved two provisional platoons (118 Marines) of the reserve 1st\r\nBattalion to the 3d Battalion sector. All 81mm mortars in 1/1 were sent\r\nto the left battalion. The fire plan also called for employment of all\r\nthe 60mm mortars that could bear on the crest of 124–122, with 81mm and\r\nartillery box-me-in barrage fires on the ridge and flanks.\r\n\r\nMachine guns from the MLR were assigned missions on the crest of Bunker\r\nRidge and 4.5-inch ripples were planned on the deep enemy approaches.\r\nGun and flame tanks were to protect the right flank of Hill 122 where\r\nthe steep draw between Bunker and the MLR offered the most dangerous\r\napproach into Bunker Hill. Supplies and fortification materials,\r\nmeanwhile, were being carried forward and casualties taken to the rear\r\nby the relief party. Although 3/1 initially reported that the Bunker\r\nHill fighting had resulted in 58 killed or wounded Marines, a later\r\nbattalion count showed this number to be 34--5 killed and 29 wounded.\r\n\r\nMost of the casualties had been caused by hostile shelling. Although\r\nthe Hill 122 reverse slope afforded some cover from the Chinese\r\nartillery and mortars, the positions on the crest did not offer any\r\nprotection, so Marines continued their trenchworks and other defensive\r\npreparations at a rapid pace and supporting fires were registered by\r\n1900. The approach of night was certain to bring renewed Communist\r\nattempts to capture Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\nAt 2000, Lieutenant Colonel Armitage reported to division that his\r\nforce on Hill 122 occupied the entire reverse slope and that the Marine\r\nof I/3/1 and B/1/1 were digging in and consolidating their scant\r\ndefenses. Enemy shells were still falling on both Bunker and Hill 124.\r\nCompany commanders forward of the MLR estimated that as many as 400\r\nChinese occupied the ridge on the other side of the slope from the\r\nMarines. Since the crest of the long Hill 124–122 ridgeline was fairly\r\nlevel, the gentle incline of the Bunker rear slope permitted defending\r\nMarine units excellent fields of fire to the ridge crest, a major\r\nconsideration in the 3/1 battalion commander’s decision to adopt a\r\nrear slope defense. Moreover, the top of the ridge could be swept with\r\ndirect fire from the MLR as well as supporting weapons from the two\r\nnearest companies on JAMESTOWN. Opposing Marine and Chinese forces were\r\nthus lined up for a continuation of the battle for Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that the Chinese wished to attempt a diversionary tactic\r\nof their own. To draw attention away from Hill 122 they engaged a\r\nMarine outpost east of Bunker and a KMC ambush far to the left before\r\nattacking Bunker again. In the KMC sector, shortly after 2300, an enemy\r\ninfantry platoon walked into a trap near the eastern edge of the Sachon\r\nand 500 yards south of the Munsan-ni-Kaesong rail line. The brief fire\r\nfight lasted only 10 minutes before the Chinese broke contact.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the ambush was incidental to the forthcoming attack against\r\nthe Bunker complex, but this same reasoning cannot be applied to\r\nthe Communist-inspired action which broke out shortly at Hill 48A,\r\nStromboli, another friendly outpost far to the east of Hill 122.\r\nNear the right limiting point of Colonel Layer’s 1st Marines and the\r\n5th Marines boundary, Stromboli was another Marine fire-team-by-day,\r\nsquad-by-night position. It occupied a small rise 250 yards forward\r\nof the MLR and commanded the immediate sector in all directions. The\r\nentire MLR in the regimental right was dominated by the enemy-held Hill\r\n104, a half-mile north of 48A.\r\n\r\nCommunist infantry opened the attack without benefit of any supporting\r\narms preparation and rushed to seize Hill 48A early on the morning of\r\n13 August, a few minutes after midnight. Defending Marines immediately\r\nresponded with small arms and automatic weapons fire. By the time the\r\noutpost commander had informed battalion of the attack by radio, the\r\nfar right sector of the 1st Marines line, held by Captain Clarence G.\r\nMoody, Jr.’s Company F, had also come under attack. Firing rifles and\r\nsubmachine guns and hurling hand grenades as they assaulted the main\r\nposition, the Chinese attempted to penetrate the JAMESTOWN defenses.\r\nIn spite of the enemy’s concerted efforts, the Marine line remained\r\nstaunch.\r\n\r\nAt Stromboli, the Communists met with no greater success, although\r\nthey did cause enough casualties to warrant the dispatch of a Company F\r\nreinforcing squad. When this unit left the MLR, at 0106 on 13 August,\r\nthe Marine line was still under a heavy attack not only from Chinese\r\ninfantry but from hostile artillery and mortars as well. Out at Hill\r\n48A the outpost remained in comparative quiet until the approach of the\r\nreinforcing party. As the Company F squad neared the base of the hill,\r\nChinese infantry that earlier had been assaulting the Marine MLR turned\r\ntheir rifle and machine gun fire from positions on the JAMESTOWN side\r\nof the outpost. A heavy rain of devastating mortar fire engulfed the\r\nreinforcing Marines. On order, they broke off the approach march and\r\nreturned to the company rear area.\r\n\r\nOn the main line, meanwhile, Company F positions were still being\r\nbombarded by Chinese artillery and assaulted by their infantry.\r\nCasualties along the entire line forced Lieutenant Colonel Batterton to\r\norder his 1st Provisional Platoon, Headquarters and Service Company,\r\n2/1, to the Company F command post. After the clutch unit departed the\r\nbattalion area, at 0210, and approached Captain Moody’s CP, enemy fires\r\nimmediately intensified. A violent fight erupted to the left of the\r\nCompany F sector, but the Marines there held. The Chinese then tried to\r\npunch holes in other parts of the company line, moving eastward along\r\nJAMESTOWN. Each failure to breach the line seemed to signal a decrease\r\nin the intensity of Chinese shelling.\r\n\r\nThis easing of Communist pressure against the main line enabled\r\nthe Company F commander to put into operation a new attempt at the\r\nreinforcement and rescue of Stromboli. After the initial enemy assault\r\nin the early hours of 13 August had ended in failure, the Chinese made\r\nrepeated attempts to capture the outpost. At one time it appeared\r\nthat a company of Chinese had overrun the hill. Later, however, the\r\nStromboli stronghold radioed that the enemy force, subsequently\r\nidentified as only a platoon, had encircled the Marine position. To\r\nrelieve enemy pressure at Hill 48A, Captain Moody employed a rifle\r\nplatoon which set out for the outpost at 0325.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, as if their intelligence had advance knowledge of the\r\n1st Marines recovery plan, the Chinese stepped up the tempo of their\r\nattack at Stromboli. A fresh assault by the enemy was stymied by Marine\r\nsuperiority in hand-to-hand combat. Thereafter, close-in defensive\r\nfires continued to ring the outpost and to discourage future assaults.\r\nThe approach of the second Marine rescue party eliminated much of\r\nthe pressure that Communist foot soldiers had maintained around the\r\nhill position. After a 90-minute exchange of fire with the enemy, the\r\nfriendly platoon penetrated the encirclement and rushed to the besieged\r\noutpost at the hill crest. At this point the Chinese disengaged and\r\nwithdrew towards the north.\r\n\r\nAfter their diversion against Stromboli had approached the proportions\r\nof a full-scale attack, with the enemy having reinforced from platoon\r\nto company size, the Chinese then initiated their main thrust, an\r\nattempt to retake Bunker. Captain Connolly (I/3/1) had reported\r\nthat shortly before 0100 Communist mortar fire had begun falling on\r\nhis positions on the southern slope of Bunker Hill. Simultaneously,\r\nChinese artillery stepped up the rate of its barrage fires as did the\r\nassaulting close-in enemy infantry. Captain Connolly then requested\r\nthe 11th Marines to place box-me-in fires around the Marine company\r\npositions on Hill 122. Artillery furnished these defensive fires almost\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nShortly after 0130, the Marines in the center and right of the I/3/1\r\nposition observed a large number of Chinese, deployed into a skirmish\r\nline, headed directly for their part of the hill. The attack was\r\naccompanied by intense machine gun and rifle fire. It was countered by\r\nan equally heavy reply from Marines on Bunker. For nearly four hours\r\nthe battle raged at Hill 122. Unsuccessful enemy frontal assaults were\r\nfollowed by attempts to dislodge the defenders from the rear. In their\r\ncontinuing thrust against the hill, the Chinese were repulsed by Marine\r\ncoordinated support fires--tank, rocket, artillery, and mortar.\r\n\r\nBy firing on known or suspected assembly areas and Chinese infantry\r\nunits advancing up the draws towards Hill 122, these Marine\r\nsupporting weapons helped to preserve the status quo at Bunker.\r\nRepeated box-me-ins were also fired by the 11th Marines during the\r\nearly-morning Communist attacks on 13 August. Exploding friendly mortar\r\nshells increased the effectiveness of the hill defense; nine rocket\r\nripples[183] fired by the artillery regiment further supported Marines\r\nat the critical terrain position. Tanks unleashed their deadly fire on\r\nnearby enemy outposts to neutralize them; their 90mm guns, aided by the\r\nbattlefield illumination from tank fighting lights, helped eliminate\r\nChinese foot soldiers attempting to envelop Marine positions on Bunker.\r\n\r\n    [183] A characteristic of 4.5-inch rocket launcher is the\r\n          discharge of 24 rounds in quick succession, called a\r\n          ripple. A battery of six launchers can fire 144 rounds on\r\n          target in less than a minute.\r\n\r\nIt was in this direction that an enemy force, estimated at reinforced\r\nbattalion strength, headed during the early morning fighting on Hill\r\n122. At 0330, the struggle for possession of the height had reached\r\nthe climax. For an hour the issue remained in doubt. Then, as the\r\nChinese small arms fire decreased, the tempo of the enemy’s artillery\r\nshelling increased. This, the division correctly deduced, announced the\r\nbeginning of a temporary Communist withdrawal from Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\nAlthough the immediate danger of the enemy onslaught had ended for\r\nthe time being, Marines to the rear of the JAMESTOWN Line stepped up\r\ntheir defensive preparations. Division, regimental, and battalion\r\noperational plans were put into effect to prevent a Chinese victory.\r\nThe seriousness of the situation on the 1st Marines right flank at\r\nStromboli early on 13 August had resulted in the movement of one\r\ncompany of 5th Marines into blocking positions behind the MLR near\r\nthe left regimental boundary. To the south of Bunker Hill, relief\r\nand replacement units from the division reserve, ordered into action\r\nlate the previous day, maneuvered into position to strengthen the\r\nregimental front. One of these relief units, G/3/7, under command of\r\nCaptain William M. Vanzuyen, had just deployed from its assembly area\r\nto pass through the ranks of an MLR company and take over the Bunker\r\nHill positions. The Marines’ situation on Hill 122 had deteriorated so\r\nrapidly, however, that the 3/1 commander rushed two reinforced squads\r\nforward from I/3/7, the nearest MLR unit.\r\n\r\nThe Company G reinforcement unit jumped off from JAMESTOWN and arrived\r\nat Bunker shortly after sunup, where it reinforced Captain Connolly’s\r\npositions during the height of the battle for possession of Hill 122.\r\nNot long after, the Chinese initiated their withdrawal under cover of\r\nincreased artillery and mortar barrages. As they left, the Communists\r\npoliced the battlefield in their typically thorough manner. A Marine\r\nplatoon that swept the northern slope of Bunker failed to find any\r\nenemy bodies in this area so recently abandoned by the Chinese, but did\r\ntake under fire and kill seven enemy that had remained on Hill 122.\r\n\r\nBefore I/3/1 had sent one of its platoons to reconnoiter the far side\r\nof Bunker Hill, Lieutenant Colonel Armitage ordered H/3/7, under\r\nCaptain John G. Demas, forward to relieve friendly forces at the\r\ncontested height. The exchange of units was completed before noon\r\nof the 13th. By late afternoon, except for Company H, all 2d and 3d\r\nBattalions, 7th Marines units that had moved up to reinforce the 1st\r\nMarines were on their way back to the regimental reserve area. At this\r\ntime the 1st Marines CO, Colonel Layer, reported to General Selden\r\nthat the Bunker Hill action during 12–13 August had resulted in 24\r\nMarines killed and 214 wounded. On the right, in the 2d Battalion\r\nsector, an additional 40 Marines were listed as casualties, including\r\n7 killed in the Stromboli defense. Chinese known dead numbered 210,\r\nplus an estimated 470 killed and 625 wounded.[184] Artillery and aerial\r\nobservers reported that between 1500 on the 12th and 0600 the following\r\nmorning an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 rounds of enemy fire had fallen\r\non 1st Marines positions, the “heaviest incoming fires received by the\r\nDivision since coming into the present sector.”[185]\r\n\r\n    [184] 1stMarDiv PIR 658, dtd 14 Aug 52.\r\n\r\n    [185] Selden, _Div Staff Rpt_, p. 19.\r\n\r\nThe number of casualties from the Bunker Hill action was to increase\r\nfurther that same day with a renewed attack on the outpost. Before\r\nthe Chinese again engaged Hill 122, however, they made a diversionary\r\nattack on the western flank at the extreme left of the 3/1 sector.\r\nAt dusk on 13 August, the enemy shelled the Company G Marines at COP\r\n2, the critical height overlooking the Panmunjom peace corridor. The\r\nshelling caused several casualties and lasted 90 minutes. Towards the\r\nend, Communist infantrymen moved forward and fired on the outpost.\r\nAt about the same time, Company H personnel emplaced on the MLR to\r\nthe rear of COP 2 began to receive artillery rounds in preassault\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nA ground attack in this western end of the 3/1 sector did not\r\nmaterialize, however. Instead, the Chinese resumed their attack on\r\nBunker Hill. Since their temporary withdrawal early on the 13th, the\r\nCCF had repeatedly sent mortar and artillery barrages against the\r\nbastion to harass its new occupants. On occasion these well-aimed\r\nmortar rounds found their mark. Mortars interdicting a trail used for\r\nresupply of the Hill 122 defenders did inflict some casualties on two\r\ngroups rushing emergency supplies forward from the MLR.\r\n\r\nAt 2100, while continuing his shelling of the left end of the 3/1\r\nsector, the enemy lifted his preparation on Hill 122 to permit a CCF\r\nreinforced company to make a new assault there on the Marine defenders.\r\nCaptain Demas called for box-me-ins to seal off his positions and\r\nillumination shells to help locate the enemy force. Utilizing the draw\r\nto the east of Hill 58A, the Chinese proceeded west to Bunker where\r\nthey pitted one platoon against the center of the Company H, 3/7 line\r\nand another against the right flank. Defensive fires momentarily held\r\noff the intruders, although some were able to break through to the\r\nMarines’ fighting positions.\r\n\r\nThose enemy troops who penetrated the Marine defenses were quickly\r\neliminated by grenades and small arms fire. Unable to weaken the Marine\r\ndefenses any further and by now sustaining sizable casualties from\r\nunrelenting Marine artillery and mortar concentrations, the Communists\r\nwithdrew at 2215. Marine defenders estimated they had killed 175 enemy\r\nduring this latest encounter; a firm count of 20 bodies were found on\r\nthe shell-torn slopes. Company H casualties, all from enemy mortar and\r\nartillery fire, were 7 killed and 21 wounded.[186] Enemy incoming was\r\nagain heavy during this period, with a reported 3,000 rounds falling in\r\nthe sector.\r\n\r\n    [186] During the fighting on the 13th, Hospitalman John E.\r\n          Kilmer was mortally wounded while “administering aid to\r\n          the wounded and expediting their evacuation.” Though\r\n          wounded by enemy mortars, he continued his life-saving\r\n          efforts until another barrage took his life. He had\r\n          died shielding a wounded Marine undergoing emergency\r\n          treatment. Hospitalman Kilmer, a distant cousin of poet\r\n          Joyce Kilmer, became the first of four corpsmen serving\r\n          with the 1st Marine Division to be awarded the Medal of\r\n          Honor during the trench warfare in western Korea.\r\n\r\nIn the 3d Battalion sector, Marine and KSC stretcher bearers brought\r\ncasualties to the I/3/1 CP, several hundred yards to the rear of the\r\nfront line. At the command post, the critically wounded were airlifted\r\nby helicopter to the rear. Less seriously wounded casualties were\r\nplaced in jeep ambulances and carried to the battalion forward aid\r\nstation, about two miles away. Here a team of doctors and corpsmen\r\nexamined and treated patients, discharged a few, but prepared most for\r\nfurther evacuation. At the 1st Marines forward aid station, patients\r\nwere reexamined and their wounds redressed when required; discharge or\r\nfurther evacuation was also accomplished. Most of the Marines brought\r\nto this forward facility had become exhausted from vigorous activity\r\nin the high temperature and humidity which characterized the South\r\nKorean summer. The regimental aid station treated these heat cases and\r\nthen released them to their units.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Company B Returns to Bunker Hill_[187]\r\n\r\n    [187] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv, 1stMar, 3/1, 1st TkBn ComdDs,\r\n          Aug 52.\r\n\r\nDivision intelligence subsequently reported that the 2100 attack on 13\r\nAugust had been made by an enemy battalion with a reinforced company\r\nin assault. This same unit again sent a small band of Chinese soldiers\r\nagainst Hill 122 at 0225 the following morning. This clash was to be\r\nthe briefest of all offensives for control of Bunker Hill during the\r\n11–17 August period. Prior to launching this four-minute fire fight,\r\nan enemy machine gun at Siberia had attempted to harass the Marines at\r\nBunker Hill. In retaliation, Marine tanks illuminated this enemy weapon\r\nwith their searchlights and immediately took it under fire with their\r\n90mm guns, knocking it out of action. At the same time, enemy artillery\r\nattempted to shell friendly tanks. During this brief fire exchange,\r\none tanker was wounded slightly and the lens of one fighting light was\r\nsplintered by fragments from enemy shells bursting around the tanks.\r\nThe inconsequential probe was made, Marines believed, not so much to\r\nseriously challenge Marines holding Hill 122 as it was to retrieve CCF\r\ndead and wounded from the major attack a few hours earlier that night.\r\n\r\nAnticipating that a much heavier ground attack was close at hand,\r\nthe 1st Marines ordered a reinforcement of the Bunker Hill position.\r\nEven before the heavy action on the 13th, this machinery had been set\r\nin motion. To this end, the 3d Battalion was to reinforce the Bunker\r\ndefense by sending a 1/1 platoon to the hill and the 2d Battalion was\r\ninstructed to return Company A (minus this platoon) to the reserve\r\nbattalion. At 0415 on the 14th, Company E/2/1, led since 10 August\r\nby Captain Stanley T. Moak, took over from A/1/1 the responsibility\r\nfor the 2d Battalion’s MLR “Siberia sector,” adjacent to the Bunker\r\nHill area held by the 3d Battalion. The Company A reinforcing platoon\r\narrived at Hill 122 just before dusk, preceding another CCF company\r\nattack by only a few hours.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the 1st Marines front was suspiciously quiet for a few\r\nminutes. Forward on Hill 122, there was no apparent enemy activity.\r\nCaptain Demas sent out a two fire-team patrol from Bunker to\r\nreconnoiter northwest of Bunker towards the Chinese lines. Shortly\r\nafter the eight Marines returned with a negative report of contact with\r\nthe enemy, the regiment received a report about the outbreak of a small\r\narms clash between defenders on the left flank of Bunker and an enemy\r\nunit farther west. At 0118 on 15 August what had initially appeared to\r\nbe a minor contest suddenly erupted into a heated fire fight all along\r\nthe 124–122 Bunker Ridge complex. At the request of Captain Dumas,\r\nMarine artillery fired protective boxes around the Bunker positions.\r\nThis defensive maneuver held the attackers in check.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Chinese infantrymen in the draw running alongside the\r\n124–122–120 ridge system were massed for an assault on Bunker from the\r\nnortheast. The plan might have been successful had not a fighting light\r\nfrom a tank on the main line intercepted the Communists in this state\r\nof their preparations. In a matter of moments, friendly artillery,\r\nmortar, and tank fire struck the Chinese and scattered the formation.\r\n\r\nAfter discovering he could not successfully pull a sneak attack,\r\nthe enemy reverted to his usual procedure, employing a preassault\r\nbombardment prior to his infantry assault. This preparation began at\r\n0206; it reached the rate of approximately 100 rounds of 82 and 122mm\r\nmortar shells per minute. While supporting weapons pounded the Marines,\r\nthe Chinese assault commander reorganized his attack force that the\r\nMarine shelling had scattered. Communist infantry then moved forward\r\nand fired on the Bunker Marines, who replied with rifles and machine\r\nguns and box-me-in fires. Unable to penetrate this protective mask\r\naround the positions, the Chinese gradually decreased their small arms\r\nand artillery fire until, at 0315, the rate of exploding shells at Hill\r\n122 had dropped to only four or five per minute. Soon thereafter the\r\nsmall arms fire slacked off entirely and by 0400 even the mortars had\r\nstopped. Across the entire 1st Marines front, all was quiet again.\r\n\r\nDuring the Company H defense of the hill, enemy losses, caused mostly\r\nby friendly artillery and mortar fire, were placed at 350, including 40\r\ncounted dead. Captain Demas’ Marines suffered 35 casualties, of whom\r\n7 were killed. En route to the MLR after relief by B/3/1, the company\r\nsuffered four more casualties, including two KIAs, all the victims of\r\nChinese mortars.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before these weapons inflicted casualties on Company B,\r\nwhich had six of its men wounded even before the H/3/7 unit had reached\r\nJAMESTOWN. Another Marine at Bunker was wounded by enemy mortars later\r\nthat morning. At 1640 the Communists again probed Bunker Hill, this\r\ntime in company strength. Striking in daylight during a thunderstorm\r\nand without any preparatory fires, the Chinese attackers failed to\r\nachieve any tactical surprise. The defenders fired both infantry and\r\nsupporting weapons; some threw grenades at the few Communists who did\r\nmanage to get close to the fighting positions. At 1750, the Chinese\r\nwithdrew, this time leaving 35 of their dead in the attack area. Four\r\nMarines had been wounded; five others suffering from battle fatigue\r\nwere later evacuated.\r\n\r\nExactly when the enemy would strike next at Bunker Hill was not known\r\nby the Marines. Most believed that the Communists would return but only\r\nspeculated as to when. Although the battalion felt that “the enemy was\r\nnot expected to attack again for some time,”[188] events were to prove\r\notherwise. In any case, the battalion was prepared, having an adequate\r\nforce on Bunker and sufficient local reserves to absorb an attack up\r\nto the strength of any received so far. Division supporting arms were\r\nreadily available for commitment at critical points.\r\n\r\n    [188] 3/1 ComdD, Aug 52, p. 4.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese soon put an end to the conjecture about the next attack.\r\nAt 0040, 16 August, an enemy force, later estimated as a battalion,\r\ncame out of positions to the west and north of Hill 122. Supported\r\nby mortars at first, and later on by artillery, the battalion sent\r\none company against the Marine outpost. Several attacking elements\r\nwere able to penetrate the defensive fires. These Chinese reached the\r\ncrest of the hill and began using their rifles, automatic weapons,\r\nand hand grenades against the defenders. Captain Scranton called for\r\nreinforcements. A platoon from I/3/7 was dispatched promptly from the\r\n3/1 sector. The reinforcements departed JAMESTOWN just as the fire\r\nfight on Bunker began to subside. By 0315, the enemy had begun his\r\nwithdrawal, and another reinforcing element, I/3/1, had moved forward,\r\nthis time from regiment to Lieutenant Colonel Armitage’s CP.\r\n\r\nAbout two hours later a brief fire fight flared up in the Company B\r\nsector. No ground assault was made on Marine positions. The enemy\r\nforce, of undetermined strength, never closed with the Marines and\r\nwithin 10 minutes, the firing stopped. No casualties to the Marines\r\nresulted during this exchange. The earlier clash had resulted in the\r\ndeath of 3 Marines and the wounding of 27. Enemy losses were estimated\r\nat 40 killed and 30 wounded.\r\n\r\nBefore it came off the hill, Company B was engaged by enemy fire three\r\nmore times. At 1945, Chinese mortars (82mm) wounded two Marines.\r\nLater, heavier mortars placed 20 rounds on Hill 122, but these caused\r\nno casualties. There were some losses, however, early on the morning\r\nof the 17th when C/1/1 was relieving the Bunker defenders. Captain\r\nScranton’s Marines sustained five more wounded from automatic weapons,\r\nfive during the relief.\r\n\r\nThe second relief of Company B on Bunker brought to a close the battle\r\nthat had been waged for possession of the vital hill complex. During\r\nthe Hill 122 tours of Company C and other 1st Marines units that\r\nfollowed in August, seven more ground actions tested the Bunker Hill\r\ndefenses. Only one of them, during the night of 25–26 August, was of\r\nsignificant size. This attack also failed to dislodge the Marines from\r\nthe hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Supporting Arms at Bunker Hill_[189]\r\n\r\n    [189] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, Chaps. 8, 9;\r\n          1stMarDiv ComdD, Aug 52; 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnls, 4–16 Aug 52;\r\n          1st Mar, 1st TkBn ComdDs, Aug 52; MAGs-12, -33 ComdDs,\r\n          Aug 52.\r\n\r\nIt was quite natural that the flurry of ground activity during the\r\nbattle of Bunker Hill created a need for increased participation from\r\nMarine supporting arms. The magnitude of infantry action during the\r\ncontest for Hill 122 resulted in a monthly record to date in 1952\r\nfor the amount of air support received as well as the volume of both\r\nartillery and tank fires supporting the division. During this critical\r\n9–16 August period, the 11th Marines played a part in every ground\r\naction except the feint attack on Siberia and the seizure of Bunker\r\nHill, both of which were purposely executed without an artillery\r\npreparation. Medium tanks fired day and night missions during most of\r\nthe infantry action. Close air support at times amounted to a strike\r\nevery 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nDuring the ground action around Bunker, Siberia, and Stromboli, the\r\ndivision received close air support in amounts unparalleled for\r\nJAMESTOWN Marines to that time. Marine and U.S. Air Force pilots flew\r\na total of 458 missions (including 27 ground controlled MPQ-14 radar\r\nbombing attacks) during five of the most critical days, 9–13 August.\r\nOn two of them, the 1st Marine Division received priority of close air\r\nsupport along the whole EUSAK front. Fifth Air Force assigned 1st MAW\r\naircraft to Marine requests for close air support as long as Marine\r\naircraft were available.\r\n\r\nThe initial air strike by Marines in the Bunker fighting was on 9\r\nAugust in support of counterattack plans for Siberia. MAG-33 provided\r\na morning and evening flight of four F9F jet fighters to destroy enemy\r\nforces and defensive works on 58A (Siberia). USAF fighter-bombers\r\nattacked Siberia and other outposts nearby and enemy artillery\r\npositions supporting the Chinese forward line. On the next day, air\r\noperations, concentrating on Siberia, were stepped up considerably\r\nagainst enemy outposts. Thirty-five aircraft in nine missions attacked\r\n58A with bombs, rockets, and napalm. These strikes were carried out by\r\nMAG-12 and U.S. Air Force pilots at irregular intervals during daylight\r\nhours. Air controllers reported good results. Other aircraft hit known\r\nmortar locations capable of supporting the Chinese. During the morning,\r\nMarine Attack Squadron 121 (Lieutenant Colonel Philip “L” Crawford)\r\nbombed and burned Bunker Hill. Just before sunset, F-80 and -84 jets\r\nof the U.S. Air Force dropped 15 tons of bombs on mortar positions and\r\ntroops on and around Hill 120. Four F-80s also participated with eight\r\nMarine AD-2 propeller-driven attack aircraft in the morning attack on\r\nBunker.\r\n\r\nAir activity in support of the 1st Marines continued unabated on 11\r\nAugust. Before the diversionary ground attack just after dusk that day,\r\nMarine and Fifth Air Force fliers repeated the treatment that Hills\r\n58A and 122 had received the previous day. During daylight, supporting\r\nweapons positions were hit by FAF fighter planes. At night, MAG-12 air\r\nattacks guided by the MPQ-14 radar bombing system destroyed hostile\r\nartillery and mortars. Also during the dark, the medium bombers of\r\nthe FEAF Bomber Command struck deeper in the rear at heavy weapons\r\nlocations.\r\n\r\nThese Air Force bombers conducted four more controlled-bombing attacks\r\nagainst Chinese artillery during the early hours of 12 August, when\r\nCompany B was consolidating its positions and hastily organizing the\r\ndefense of Bunker Hill. After daylight and until dusk, MAGs-12 and -33\r\nand USAF squadrons provided four-plane flights to strike troop assembly\r\nareas, supporting weapons positions, and observation posts close to\r\nHill 122. In late afternoon, Marine pilots in four F9F Panther jets\r\nand three ADs bombed and burned the enemy side of Bunker Hill during\r\nthe shelling and subsequent ground attack against the Marines on the\r\neastern slope.\r\n\r\nMarines flew, on 13 August, all of the daylight close air support\r\nmissions in support of the actions on both Bunker in the center and\r\nStromboli in the right of the 1st Marines sector. On 13 August, a total\r\nof 94 aircraft were committed over the regimental sector to conduct\r\nstrikes in support of ground operations. Enemy Hill 104, commanding\r\nthe 2/1 outpost on 48A (Stromboli), received four attacks. Fighter\r\nbombers (F4U propeller-driven Corsairs) carrying napalm, rockets, and\r\n1,000-pound bombs, raided the hill mass at 0535. The other strikes\r\nagainst this key terrain-feature were made by attack and fighter\r\naircraft during the afternoon. Other targets on the regimental right\r\nwere weapons positions beyond Hill 104 and an enemy outpost one\r\nthousand yards west of Stromboli.\r\n\r\nMost of the air support received by the 1st Marines on the 13th was\r\ndirected against targets that were participating--or that were capable\r\nof taking part--in the battle on Bunker Hill. Against the enemy on the\r\nheight itself, the Marines directed only three strikes, and these came\r\nlate in the morning. A majority of the air attacks were dispatched\r\nagainst observation and command posts and the firing positions of both\r\nautomatic and large caliber weapons. Chinese artillery and mortar\r\nfire had inflicted more casualties and punishment on the Marines than\r\nthe enemy infantry assaults. As a consequence, the main effort of the\r\nclose air support strikes was directed against these hostile supporting\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nAfter dark on the 13th, VMF(N)-513 commanded by Colonel Peter D.\r\nLambrecht,[190] took up the air offensive against the heavy firing\r\npositions in the rear of the enemy line. The squadron conducted four\r\nattacks with its night fighters. Two of its attacks were made just\r\nbefore sunrise.\r\n\r\n    [190] Two days later, Colonel Lambrecht, flying a F3D twin jet\r\n          night fighter with his radar operator, Second Lieutenant\r\n          James M. Brown, disappeared while on a night flight. The\r\n          last known position of the plane was over the Yellow\r\n          Sea, 50 air miles west of Pyongyang. At about that point\r\n          the aircraft faded from the radar screen. Efforts to\r\n          reestablish communications failed. It was reported that\r\n          observers at sea sighted a crash and explosion at about\r\n          this same time. Extensive search failed to uncover any\r\n          trace of the Marines or their aircraft.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the battle of Bunker Hill, the ground fighting\r\nsubsided and the requirement for close air support abated accordingly.\r\nOn the 14th, only four daylight strikes were flown in the 1st Marines\r\narea. These, all by Marine squadrons, were against active artillery and\r\nmortars in the defilade of Hill 120 and others to the west on the far\r\nslope of Hill 123, and Chinese outpost positions, west of 48A, which\r\nhad been pestering the Stromboli garrison. There were no flights after\r\ndark on the 14th, but on the following night, two MPQ missions were\r\nflown by VMF(N)-513. Each was a single plane flight against a reported\r\nartillery location. This was the final night air action in the battle\r\nfor Bunker Hill. Daylight missions in support of Hill 122 defense after\r\nthe sharp decrease of attacks on the 14th numbered only seven attacks,\r\neach by four planes. These, flown by Marines, continued to emphasize\r\nthe destruction of enemy artillery.\r\n\r\nMarine artillery continued its support of ground troops and air\r\nstrikes. Cannoneers of the 11th Marines fired 21 flak suppression\r\nmissions during the five days beginning on 11 August. This type of\r\nclose coordination between Marine supporting arms further reduced\r\ncombat losses of aircraft providing CAS to the division. The Marine\r\nartillerymen had played a vital part in the defense of the besieged\r\noutposts. Lieutenant Colonel Armitage credited the box-me-in fires with\r\nan important role in thwarting each enemy attack on Bunker.[191]\r\n\r\n    [191] 3/1 ComdD, Aug 52, pp. 3–4.\r\n\r\nIn the 24-hour period beginning at 1800 on 12 August, Marine artillery\r\ndirectly supporting the 1st Marines fired 10,652 rounds. Most of the\r\nammunition was expended in support of the Bunker Hill defense; some\r\nwas used in behalf of the Marines outposting Stromboli during the\r\nCommunists’ early morning diversion that day. On the 9th, the direct\r\nsupport battalion, 3/11 (Lieutenant Colonel Charles O. Rogers), had\r\nfired about one-fourth of the 12–13 August total. Many of the shells\r\nthat first day of the Bunker battle were preparatory to counterattacks\r\nfor regaining Siberia.\r\n\r\nWhen the retaking of Hill 58A was discarded in favor of the surprise\r\nattack on 122, the amount of artillery support was reduced, during\r\nthe 1st Marines infantry preparations on the 10th and 11th, in keeping\r\nwith the fire support plan. Upon seizure of Bunker, Lieutenant Colonel\r\nRogers’ business immediately picked up and quickly reached a crescendo\r\nthe following day, when the 10,652 shells fired became a Marine one-day\r\nbattalion record for western Korea until the last stages of fighting\r\nin 1953. Other Marine artillery battalions fired reinforcing missions\r\nduring the critical period as did the 4.5-inch Rocket Battery which\r\nfired a large number of on-call ripples. The regimental commander\r\nlater recalled that “during some of the crises every gun that could\r\nbear on Bunker in the 11th Marines and reinforcing units was shooting\r\nthere.”[192]\r\n\r\n    [192] BGen Frederick P. Henderson ltr to Hd, HistBr, G-3 Div,\r\n          HQMC and MS comments, dtd 20 Jun 67, hereafter _Henderson\r\n          ltr III_.\r\n\r\nAfter a sharp drop on the 14th, the artillery support gradually\r\ndecreased in proportion to the amount and strength of the enemy’s\r\naction against Hill 122. By 20 August, 3/11 was firing only 244 rounds\r\na day. Only on the 26th, during a serious Chinese attempt to retake\r\nBunker, did the number of artillery rounds match the intensity of the\r\nfire support rendered during the earlier part of the month.\r\n\r\nIt was not only the quantity of 11th Marines support that the infantry\r\ncalled for during the battle of Bunker Hill; quality was equally\r\nimportant. A majority of the more than 28,000 rounds that 3/11 fired\r\nduring the eight days of Bunker Hill fell around the besieged outposts.\r\nMany rounds were fired in defense of MLR positions. In both of these\r\ntypes of protective fires, extreme accuracy and precision were required\r\ndue to the proximity of enemy and friendly lines in order to prevent\r\nany “short” rounds from falling among Marine positions. Lieutenant\r\nColonel Armitage recalled that during the height of the battle on the\r\nnight of 12 August, “we did have a bad scare ... when Captain Connolly\r\nreported that friendly mortar fire was falling short.”[193] The\r\nbattalion immediately ceased fire with its 60mms, 81mms, and 4.2s and\r\neach piece was checked; the culprit was quickly located and within 5–10\r\nminutes 3/1 resumed fire.\r\n\r\n    [193] _Armitage ltr_ and comments, p. 12.\r\n\r\nDuring the August battle, artillery in general support of the entire\r\ndivision and I Corps artillery reinforcing the fires of Colonel\r\nHenderson’s regiment, stepped up their efforts to destroy the distant\r\nand more difficult targets, including mortars and artillery. These\r\ncontinued to be the main cause of Marine casualties. Some of the labors\r\nof the 11th Marines gun crews did silence enemy heavy weapons, but\r\npersonnel losses from enemy shellings still mounted, especially in the\r\ninfantry units. To assist in the location and destruction of the enemy\r\nartillery, aerial observers spent considerable time in spotting and\r\nfixing Chinese weapons positions.\r\n\r\nBesides these counterbattery efforts, the 11th Marines employed\r\nother artillery means to provide the additional support the 1st\r\nMarine Division requested during Bunker Hill. Two of these were the\r\ncounter-counterbattery and the countermortar programs, the former being\r\na passive defense-deception program to minimize Chinese counterbattery\r\nfires against 11th Marines weapons. Nearly every day C Battery, 17th\r\nField Artillery Battalion, fired special request missions.[194] Another\r\ntype of fire, flak suppression, aided the cause of close air support\r\npilots delivering ordnance against those Chinese positions taking\r\nBunker Hill and Stromboli under fire. At night, illumination shells\r\nhelped outpost and frontline Marines in locating groups of enemy\r\nmassing for assault on Hill 122.\r\n\r\n    [194] Many of these targets were CCF choke points, dumps,\r\n          and weapons emplacements. Targets were identified and\r\n          confirmed by a highly developed system that employed air\r\n          spotting, aerial photographic interpretation, artillery\r\n          evaluation, and POW interrogation.\r\n\r\nMortars (4.2-inch) of the 1st Marines contributed heavily to the\r\ndefense of the outposts. Operations reached a peak on 12–13 August\r\nwhen, in a 24-hour period, Captain Carl H. Benson’s mortar company\r\nfired 5,952 rounds--4,084 high explosive and 1,868 illuminating. In\r\naddition to their defensive fires, these hard-hitting weapons attacked\r\nChinese mortars, automatic weapons, defensive positions, and troop\r\nformations with deadly accuracy.\r\n\r\nNo less precise and lethal were the fires of Captain Gene M. McCain’s\r\ngun tanks (Company C, 1st Tank Battalion), and the battalion flame\r\ntanks. Three of the latter had fired their 105s in support of the KMC\r\non the morning of the 9th before the vehicles received orders to move\r\neast to join Company C temporarily. On the next day, 90s fired on enemy\r\nbunkers, observation posts, and trenches in the vicinity of Siberia\r\nand Stromboli. During 11 August, two gun tanks blasted at targets\r\nimmediately beyond Siberia and others to the west of that outpost.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the 11th, the critical part of Bunker battle began\r\nfor the tankers also. Those elements of Lieutenant Colonel John I.\r\nWilliamson’s battalion supporting the diversion and the subsequent\r\nmain attack pulled into positions south of Hill 122 on the MLR and to\r\nthe right in the Company F sector. It was not until the next day that\r\nthe tanks operating with the 1st Marines reached a peak in gun support\r\nfor the Bunker fight. Beginning with the defense of Hill 122 from 1600\r\nthat day, and for the next 26 hours, the tankers placed 817 shells\r\non targets effecting the Chinese capability of capturing Bunker and\r\nStromboli. In addition to the heavy ammunition, the Company C tanks,\r\naugmented by the 1st Marines antitank platoon and five tanks from the\r\ndivision tank reserve, fired 32,000 rounds of .30 caliber machine gun\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\nExcept on the 11th, most of the tank firing in the fight for Bunker\r\nHill through 14 August was accomplished during the hours of darkness.\r\nOn the latter date, the cannons and machine guns of the mediums blasted\r\ndirectly at Chinese outposts opposite Colonel Layer’s regiment. The\r\nnumber of rounds that day fell off considerably from the high on the\r\n13th; on the 15th the tanks in the 1st Marines area did not fire at\r\nall. Heavy rain that had accompanied the late afternoon thundershower\r\nthat day made movement forward to firing positions impractical. By\r\nthe next day, however, the ground was solid enough to permit some\r\nmaneuvering by the tracked vehicles. They fired 52 rounds of 90mm\r\nshells and 14,750 machine gun rounds at automatic weapons positions and\r\nbunkers on the western slope of Hill 122. This marked the final tank\r\nmission in support of the 1st Marines in the battle for Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the August fighting, tanks of the\r\ndivision were able to get the first real test of a technique of\r\nnight support,[195] and at the same time experiment with a towing\r\ndevice to permit retrieval of disabled vehicles under fire without\r\ngetting outside the tank. The use of the lights to support both the\r\ndiversionary force and the defense of Hill 122 showed the value of\r\nthese instruments. Lieutenant Colonel Williamson recommended that\r\ntanks be employed in pairs, one to spot and adjust fire and the other\r\nto fire. With respect to the towing device, he considered the new\r\npiece of equipment an improvement over the manual hook-up method, but\r\nnoted that the device limited tank maneuverability and had a tendency\r\nwhen bouncing up and down over rough terrain to dig into the ground,\r\nimpeding the forward progress of the vehicle.\r\n\r\n    [195] The use of fighting lights to illuminate targets for tank\r\n          gunners had been undertaken in July, but the results were\r\n          inconclusive, owing to failure of one of the bulbs of the\r\n          two lights tested. 1st TkBn ComdD, Aug 52, App. VI, Encl.\r\n          2. Declared the G-3, 1stMarDiv: “The diversion on Siberia\r\n          was 100 percent effective, due largely to the new tank\r\n          battle lights which we were using for the first time.”\r\n          _Honsowetz ltr II._\r\n\r\n\r\n_In Retrospect_[196]\r\n\r\n    [196] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: FMFPac, _1stMarDiv Sum, Jul-Oct 52_;\r\n          _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, Chaps. 8, 9; 1stMarDiv, 1stMar\r\n          ComdDs, Aug 52.\r\n\r\nWhether the sacrifice of Siberia in favor of the seizure of Bunker\r\njustified the outcome can be determined, in part, by looking back\r\nto the division commander’s reasons for this decision. He had cited\r\nthree advantages in seizing and occupying Hill 122 instead of 58A.\r\nOne, tactical surprise achieved by an attack on the former, was an\r\nunqualified success. That Bunker Hill would provide more defensible\r\nterrain and at the same time add strength to the main line were two\r\nsound judgments that the test of time would bear out. The third point,\r\nthat observation into the enemy’s outpost line would be increased from\r\nthe higher hill, also proved to be correct.\r\n\r\nOnly the inability to neutralize Hill 58A effectively from Bunker\r\ncast any doubt on the considerations. At night the enemy could occupy\r\nSiberia both for firing positions and flank security to attack friendly\r\nforces moving down the corridor east of Hill 122. Action to counter\r\nthese two enemy actions came mainly from MLR forces.\r\n\r\nOne measure of the results of the Bunker Hill fighting is seen in the\r\nprice paid. Chinese losses were estimated by the 1st Marine Division\r\nat approximately 3,200, including more than 400 known dead. Marine\r\ncasualties in the action were 48 killed and 313 seriously wounded.\r\nSeveral hundred additional wounded were treated at 1st Marines medical\r\nfacilities and returned to duty shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nTo replace combat losses in the infantry regiment, General Selden on\r\n12 August directed that rear area service and support units fill the\r\nvacancies. Two hundred Marines, nearly all of them volunteers, were\r\nprovided to Colonel Layer by the 14th. To offset other losses within\r\nthe division, its commander similarly had requested on 12 August\r\nthat the Commandant, General Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr., authorize an\r\nair-lifting of 500 enlisted Marine infantrymen to the 1st Marine\r\nDivision as soon as possible. Pointing out that mounting battle\r\ncasualties had reduced the effective strength of the division, General\r\nSelden also urged that each of the next two monthly replacement drafts\r\nscheduled for the division be increased by 500 more enlisted men. After\r\nsome debate at the next senior administrative headquarters,[197] the\r\nrequest was granted by General Shepherd, and the emergency replacements\r\nwere made available from the 3d Marine Division at Camp Pendleton,\r\nCalifornia. The initial replacement of 500 Marines arrived on 21 August.\r\n\r\n    [197] CG, FMFPac, Lieutenant General Hart, requested the\r\n          Commandant to delay decision until FMFPac could\r\n          survey the combat replacement situation and aircraft\r\n          availability. After a quick evaluation of both these\r\n          factors, General Hart on the 14th recommended approval.\r\n          FMFPac ComdD, Aug 52, App. I, Encl. (6). The air lift\r\n          of 500 replacements to Korea was an “all out effort for\r\n          Marine Aviation Transport based on the West Coast. This\r\n          general support of Korean based forces demonstrated the\r\n          total capability of Marine Aviation in support of ground\r\n          forces.” MajGen Samuel S. Jack to Hd, HistBr, G-3 Div,\r\n          HQMC, dtd 27 Jun 67, hereafter _Jack ltr_.\r\n\r\nMore men to replace divisional combat losses might have been required\r\nhad not the medical support been such an efficient operation. After\r\nthe battle, the regimental surgeon, Lieutenant Robert E. Murto,\r\ncalled for a review of the medical facilities in effect during the\r\nBunker, Siberia, and Stromboli fighting. In attendance were the\r\nbattalion doctors and the division surgeon, Captain Lawrence E.\r\nBach. Participants discussed both the major difficulties and routine\r\nprocedures involved in medical care of the wounded. Problem areas\r\nwere the high incidence of heat exhaustion, ground transportation of\r\nthe wounded, enemy artillery fire that interfered with helicopter\r\nevacuations, and the need for increased medical support under battle\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nRegarding the last category, the surgeons noted that medical supplies\r\nduring the heavy fighting of 9–16 August were never at a dangerously\r\nlow level. The only shortage that had developed was in stretchers, due\r\nto the normal delay in transfer of stretchers from medical stations\r\nalong the evacuation route to the company forward medical facilities.\r\nTo help combat the Chinese artillery problem, medical officers had\r\nplaced aid stations on the reverse slopes of hills. There was no\r\navailable or known solution to hastening and easing the movement of\r\nbattlefield casualties over the ground. The armored personnel carrier\r\noffered some protection from ground fire and a ride less painful than\r\none in a truck, but the wheeled vehicles remained the most widely used.\r\n\r\nThere was little that could be done about the number of heat exhaustion\r\ncases. High temperature and humidity, vigorous activity, and the\r\nwearing of the armored vest (and to some degree, the steel helmet),\r\ncombined to produce the casualties. All the surgeons agreed that\r\nregardless of the number of heat casualties, the wearing of these two\r\nitems must continue. Regimental doctors credited the armored vest with\r\nsaving the lives of 17 Marines. Several other Marines, they noted, had\r\nreceived only slight head wounds from bullets that had spent most of\r\ntheir velocity penetrating the steel helmet.\r\n\r\nHelicopter evacuation saved the lives of other Marines. The doctors\r\ncredited the flying skills and bravery of the evacuation pilots\r\nfor these rescues. Immediate response to day and night calls was\r\ninstrumental in the recovery of numerous Marines. Rear Admiral Lamont\r\nPugh, Surgeon General of the U.S. Navy, commented upon the value of the\r\nhelicopter and on other reasons for success of medical support. After\r\na Far East inspection trip, which included a visit to the 1st Marine\r\nDivision during the battle of Bunker Hill, Admiral Pugh expressed the\r\nfollowing opinion:\r\n\r\n  ... [I] attributed the new low record “2% mortality” of\r\n  those men wounded in action to the bullet resistant vest, to\r\n  skillful frontline surgery with availability of whole blood,\r\n  the utilization of helicopters for casualty evacuation direct\r\n  to hospital ships and rear area hospitals, and the efficient\r\n  manner in which the Hospital Corpsmen of the Navy fulfilled their\r\n  mission with the Marines.[198]\r\n\r\n    [198] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, Chap. 12. p. 12-8.\r\n\r\nIn another logistical area, the performance was not quite\r\nas satisfactory, for the level of supply of one important\r\nitem--illuminating shells--fell dangerously low during the Bunker\r\nfighting. On 16 August, 3/1 reported early in the morning that\r\n“artillery illumination was exhausted and 81mm mortar illumination\r\nwas fast diminishing.”[199] To replace the shell-produced light, the\r\nregiment used a flare plane.[200]\r\n\r\n    [199] 3/1 ComdD, Aug 52, p. 4.\r\n\r\n    [200] Earlier, on 13 August, a flare drop requested by the 1st\r\n          Marines went awry when the aircraft got off course and\r\n          dropped the flares forward of the 5th Marines main line.\r\n          1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl, 13 Aug 52.\r\n\r\nAmmunition supply appeared to be no problem to the Chinese. The rate\r\nand frequency of mortar and artillery fire proved that the enemy had\r\na vast store of these shells. During the heavy fighting, the division\r\nobserved that the enemy expended approximately 17,000 mortar and\r\nartillery rounds in the 11–16 August period of the battle. It was\r\nnoted for the first time that the Chinese used mortars primarily in\r\nsupport of limited attacks.\r\n\r\nAbout the enemy’s reliance on mortars and the technique of their\r\nemployment, the 1st Marine Division reported:\r\n\r\n  This was particularly true of his 60 and 82mm mortars, which are\r\n  easily displaced forward and shifted to alternate positions.\r\n  These light mortars were difficult to locate by our observers\r\n  mainly because of the small size and limited development of\r\n  their positions, and the fact that they are moved frequently. A\r\n  large number of enemy mortars were fired from bunkers deep in\r\n  the ground with only a narrow aperture at the top through which\r\n  to fire. There were some instances, during the Battle of Bunker\r\n  Hill, when the enemy brought his 60mm mortars out from cover on\r\n  the forward slope and set them up in the open near the crest of\r\n  the ridge. After delivering several rounds, the mortars would\r\n  then displace quickly back to a covered position. During August,\r\n  mortar fire averaged between 50 and 60 percent of the total\r\n  incoming received by the 1st Marine Division.[201]\r\n\r\n    [201] 1stMarDiv ComdD, Aug 52, p. 2.\r\n\r\nFurther information about the Chinese was also derived at this time,\r\nalthough not always directly associated with the battle. Deserters\r\npicked up in the left sectors of the 1st and 5th Marines on 12 and\r\n13 August and papers taken from enemy dead on the 13th confirmed\r\nearlier-reported dispositions of Chinese units. One prisoner, from\r\nthe artillery regiment of the 118th Division, the unit facing the\r\nmajor part of the 1st Marines line, indicated that another artillery\r\nregiment had been assigned to support his division. If true, this extra\r\nunit would account for both the increased Chinese fires in the Bunker\r\narea and the additional artillery emplacements that photo planes had\r\nspotted in the 118th Division sector. Infantry units of this division,\r\nthe Marines observed, introduced no new techniques or equipment during\r\nthe battle. Prior intelligence had provided the 1st Marines with\r\ntypical enemy ground attack tactics. Neither the Chinese envelopment\r\nof Siberia, Stromboli, and Bunker nor the diversion against Hill 48A\r\nbefore the main attack on Hill 122 represented a departure from normal\r\nCCF practice.\r\n\r\nNor was the earlier Marine diversion new, but unlike the Chinese\r\nattempt, the 1st Marines tactic was successful. Just before the\r\nmaneuver, the division pulled off another strategem, described by\r\nGeneral Selden in a letter to General Shepherd:\r\n\r\n  I worked a ruse that morning which proved to be very profitable.\r\n  Throughout the Eighth Army front, it had been routine to put on\r\n  a strike, this to be followed by smoke, then a good artillery\r\n  barrage, with troops following for the assault. This was done\r\n  with the exception that there were no troops. The enemy,\r\n  thinking that there were troops, opened up with everything. The\r\n  only damage inflicted was on their own forces.... While they\r\n  were firing on their own troops, we again opened fire with our\r\n  artillery, just to help the situation along.[202]\r\n\r\n    [202] MajGen John T. Selden ltr to Gen Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr.,\r\n          dtd 14 Aug 52.\r\n\r\nOne technique the Marines employed in the Bunker Hill battle was\r\ndefense of the reverse (protected) side of the hill. Although counter\r\nto the usual American military practice, the reverse slope defense was\r\nrequired by the intense artillery and mortar fire massed upon the front\r\nslope defenders. As the 3/1 battalion commander later commented:\r\n\r\n  It’s true, we suffered from the heavy incoming--but had we had to\r\n  work replacements, casualties, and supplies all the way up to the\r\n  (forward) military crest of Bunker--the losses would have been\r\n  prohibitive. With the weight of the incoming and our inability\r\n  to get greater infantry mass onto the battlefield at one time, a\r\n  conventional defense would have been far more costly ... [after]\r\n  the damage done to Baker Company in the [12 August] afternoon\r\n  attack ... had we not gone into a reverse slope defense, we could\r\n  not [have held] with the strength at hand.[203]\r\n\r\n    [203] _Armitage ltr_ and draft MS comments, p. 7. For further\r\n          details of the Bunker Hill action, see _Armitage ltr_ in\r\n          v. V, Korean comment file.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a tactical weakness of the reverse slope defense,\r\nthat “plagued us until the end of the battle,”[204] was the fact that\r\nthe 1st Marines initial gain was not more fully exploited. As the\r\nbattalion commander explained:\r\n\r\n    [204] _Ibid._, p. 8.\r\n\r\n  To be successful, in a reverse slope defense, the defender\r\n  must immediately counterattack, retake and reoccupy the\r\n  _forward_ slope of the position as soon as enemy pressure\r\n  diminishes. Because of the incoming and primarily because of\r\n  our overextension in regiment, we ... [employed] piecemeal\r\n  commitment ... and fed units into the battle by company, where we\r\n  should have employed our entire battalion in counterattacks to\r\n  punish the withdrawing force and restore the forward slope. To\r\n  the very end, lack of decisive strength prevented this. We stayed\r\n  on the reverse slope all the way, except for brief forays to the\r\n  forward slope.[205]\r\n\r\n    [205] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nSome officers felt, in retrospect, that a more feasible solution during\r\nthe August battle might have been to move all three battalions on\r\nline--3/1, 1/1, and 2/1, with the reserve battalion (1/1) deployed on\r\na narrow front. This would have provided decisive strength on Bunker\r\nand the MLR behind it to give greater depth counterattack capability,\r\nand better control at the point where needed.[206] Departure from\r\nstandard doctrine by employment of the reverse slope defense furthered\r\nthe existing controversy as to the best method of ground organization\r\nin the division sector. But it was to be some months before a change\r\nwould be effected.[207]\r\n\r\n    [206] _Ibid._, p. 9.\r\n\r\n    [207] As the military situation changed in Korea to become\r\n          increasingly one of a battle of position and attrition,\r\n          the Marine Corps Basic School, Quantico, Va. curriculum\r\n          was revised to give greater emphasis to tactics of\r\n          positional warfare. Close attention was paid to terrain\r\n          evaluation, employment of infantry units, offensive and\r\n          defensive use of automatic and supporting weapons, night\r\n          counterattacks, field problems of reverse slope defense,\r\n          and even tasks of “research into WW I--and the American\r\n          Civil and Revolutionary Wars for the tactic of Reverse\r\n          Slope defense.” _Armitage ltr._\r\n\r\nTank, artillery, air, and ground Marines participating in the battle\r\nof Bunker Hill gave up one outpost but took another, one that added\r\nstrength not only to the outpost defense but also to the main line. A\r\nwell thought-out plan and its skillful execution permitted Marines to\r\ntake the critical terrain quickly without crippling casualties. Defense\r\nof the position on Hill 122 was complicated not so much by the Chinese\r\ninfantry action but by the intensive mortar and artillery shelling.\r\nThe Marines’ capability to defend was enhanced by close coordination\r\namong artillery, air, and tank units. Chinese casualties, by estimate,\r\nwere 500 percent more than the losses actually suffered by the Marines.\r\nThe battle of Bunker Hill resulted in the first major Marine action\r\nand victory in West Korea. It ushered in two straight months of hard\r\nfighting, the most difficult ones yet for Marines on the western\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nOutpost Fighting Expanded\r\n\r\n_From the Center Sector to the Right--Early September Outpost\r\nClashes--Korean COPs Hit Again--More Enemy Assaults in Late\r\nSeptember--Chinese Intensify Their Outpost Attacks--More PRESSURE, More\r\nCAS, More Accomplishments--Rockets, Resupply, and Radios_\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Center Sector to the Right_[208]\r\n\r\n    [208] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdD, Aug 52; 1stMarDiv PIRs\r\n          661–675, dtd 18–31 Aug 52; 1stMar, 5thMar, 2/1, 3/1\r\n          ComdDs, Aug 52.\r\n\r\nFollowing the progressively faltering Chinese attacks against Bunker\r\nHill in mid-August, the 1st Marines in the center MLR sector witnessed\r\na period of decreased enemy activity. By sunup on the 17th, Captain\r\nKsycewski’s Company C, from Lieutenant Colonel King’s 1st Battalion had\r\nrelieved B/1/1, marking the second complete tour of duty at Hill 122\r\nfor Company B that month. In two days on the shell-torn crest, Company\r\nC received only a single enemy probe and only a few rounds of artillery\r\nand mortar fire. In the early morning hours of the 19th, D/2/1 assumed\r\nresponsibility for Bunker and Hill 124. These new occupants of the\r\ndisputed property almost immediately were subjected to larger and more\r\nfrequent Chinese probes as well as increased fire from CCF supporting\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nEnemy ground action was directed against the Marine flank, especially\r\nthe right. Four Chinese infantrymen attempted to infiltrate this corner\r\nof the Bunker Hill defenses just before sunrise on 23 August. One even\r\nmade his way to the top of Hill 122 where he fired downhill at several\r\nMarine defenders, wounding one. A moment later this lone Chinese’s\r\nreconnaissance efforts was rewarded by a fatal hit from a Marine\r\nsniper’s rifle.\r\n\r\nCaptain Moody’s Company F next took over the two-hill complex. That\r\nnight, the 24th, the Chinese shelled the two hills and probed their\r\ndefenses but again showed no inclination to press an attack. On the\r\nfollowing night, however, the Chinese became more aggressive. At dusk,\r\ntwo squads charged the right flank of Bunker Hill, threw hand grenades,\r\nand fired their submachine guns briefly at the Marines. The enemy then\r\nretired, but about an hour afterwards, a force estimated at two-company\r\nstrength assaulted the outpost defenses from the center to the right.\r\nAt the same time, enemy shells began exploding around these Marine\r\npositions. Captain Moody called for artillery and tank fire on the\r\nattackers. Pushing forward, the Communist infantrymen forced a small\r\nopening in the defense perimeter; by this time, a standby platoon on\r\nthe MLR was moving forward to strengthen the Bunker garrison. Upon\r\narrival of the Marine reinforcements, at midnight, the Chinese soldiers\r\nwithdrew. Simultaneously, the incoming artillery and mortar fire\r\ndiminished, and in less than a half hour all firing had ceased.\r\n\r\nAfter the enemy had pulled back, Company F sent its platoon out to\r\nreoccupy a forward listening position temporarily abandoned during the\r\nsecond attack. Chinese soldiers immediately contested this advance\r\nand, after a local fire fight, caused the Marines to retire once more.\r\nThat action ended the significant Bunker Hill action in August. In the\r\nspirited infantry fighting and artillery dueling during the night of\r\n25–26 August, Marines suffered 65 casualties, including 8 killed. The\r\nChinese losses were estimated at 100 killed and 170 wounded. Supporting\r\narms fire had contributed largely to the high casualty figures on both\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nDuring August, whenever a lull had occurred in Colonel Layer’s 1st\r\nMarines embattled sector, it almost invariably signaled a step-up\r\nof Chinese action elsewhere along the 1st Marine Division MLR. When\r\nfrustrated in their attacks against the positions held by the 1st\r\nMarines, the enemy invariably turned his attention to the right of the\r\nline, manned since June by the 5th Marines. During August the Chinese\r\nseized three outposts forward of the 2/5[209] right battalion line,\r\nwhich it had been the Marine practice to man during daylight hours\r\nonly. The trio, forming a diagonal line southwest to northeast, in\r\nfront of the battalion sector were Elmer, Hilda, and Irene.\r\n\r\n    [209] Command responsibility for this sector changed on 20\r\n          August, when Lieutenant Colonel William S. McLaughlin\r\n          took over the battalion from Lieutenant Colonel Cross.\r\n\r\nAfter dusk on 6 August the enemy had advanced to COP Elmer, on the\r\nfar southwest end, and by skillful coordination of their infantry and\r\nsupporting fires denied the position to the Marines approaching to\r\nreoccupy the outpost early the next morning. An hour before midnight\r\non 11 August, another 2/5 patrol had attempted to temporarily occupy\r\nHilda, in the center, during the diversionary fires supporting the\r\nBunker Hill attack. As the Marines neared the outpost, however, they\r\ndiscovered the Chinese had already occupied it. Enemy mortar and\r\nartillery fire drove the patrol back to its own lines.\r\n\r\nA similar situation occurred at dawn on 17 August, when the Marine\r\noutpost detail moved forward to occupy Irene during daylight hours\r\nand found the Chinese already on the position. Enemy troops fired at\r\nthe Marines, pinning them down.[210] Although two rescue units were\r\ndispatched to support the Marines, CCF fire interdicted their route of\r\napproach. When it became evident the second reinforcement party could\r\nnot reach its objective, the outpost detail was ordered to pull back to\r\nthe MLR. The Chinese continued to occupy Irene, the last outpost lost\r\nin August, for the remainder of the 2/5 tour on line.\r\n\r\n    [210] To escape the murderous hostile fire, the Marines\r\n          sought shelter in a trench nearby. During the ensuing\r\n          clash, a Chinese grenade landed in the midst of the\r\n          Marines. Private First Class Robert E. Simanek, E/2/5,\r\n          unhesitatingly threw himself upon the deadly missile an\r\n          instant before it exploded. Although gravely wounded, his\r\n          courageous action prevented injury or death to fellow\r\n          patrol members. The following year, President Dwight D.\r\n          Eisenhower presented the Medal of Honor to the Detroit,\r\n          Michigan Marine for his “daring initiative and great\r\n          personal valor.”\r\n\r\nFor the remainder of August the Chinese were apparently content to hold\r\nwhat they had gained without immediately seeking additional positions.\r\nAs a result, operations along the front were mostly limited to patrol\r\naction. Chinese infantry units, usually no larger than a squad,\r\nregularly fired on Marine patrols, engaging them for a short period\r\nfrom afar, and then quickly breaking off the contact. Seldom was this\r\nsmall unit action supported by artillery or mortars.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions late in the month, however, the Chinese showed more\r\nspirit. Both encounters took place during the early evening hours of 22\r\nAugust when Chinese patrols came upon two different Company F ambushes\r\noperating forward of the 2/5 sector. Heavy casualties were suffered by\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\nThe next day a brief but heavy period of rainfall began with nine\r\ninches recorded between 23–25 August. Although the flooding conditions\r\nin the division sector were not so extensive as the July rains, they\r\ncurtailed ground activity considerably and air action to a lesser\r\ndegree. Division roads were badly damaged but not trenches and bunkers,\r\nstrengthened as a result of the experience with the July floods. High\r\nwaters made the ferry inoperable at the Honker Bridge site and also\r\nwashed out Widgeon Bridge, where the Imjin crested to 42.5 feet. If\r\nthe sudden flash floods wreaked havoc with some of the Marine division\r\ninstallations, the Chinese were the recipients of similar disfavors;\r\nintelligence indicated that damage to the CCF frontline positions was\r\neven more severe than to the JAMESTOWN defenses.[211]\r\n\r\n    [211] 1stMarDiv PIR 669, dtd 25 Aug 52.\r\n\r\nThe end of August saw the relief of General Selden as Commanding\r\nGeneral, 1st Marine Division. He was succeeded on the 29th by Major\r\nGeneral Edwin A. Pollock. A brief ceremony at division headquarters,\r\nattended by senior officers of EUSAK and KMC, marked the event. Earlier\r\nthat month, in recognition of his services to the Korean defense,\r\nPresident of the Republic of Korea, Syngman Rhee, had awarded General\r\nSelden the Order of Military Merit, Taiguk, the highest Korean award.\r\n\r\nThe new division commander, General Pollock[212] had commanded the\r\n2d Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina just prior to his\r\nKorean tour. He had more than 30 years of military experience. During\r\nWorld War II, he had participated in no fewer than five major campaigns\r\nin the Pacific, including the first at Guadalcanal, where he earned\r\na Navy Cross, and one of the war’s most costly battles, Iwo Jima.\r\nFollowing the war, he had served at Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, in\r\ncommand and staff assignments, and later at Headquarters Marine Corps\r\nwhere in July 1949, he had received his first star.\r\n\r\n    [212] DivInfo, HQMC, Biography of MajGen Edwin A. Pollock, Jan\r\n          56, rev.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Early September Outpost Clashes_[213]\r\n\r\n    [213] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv, 1stMar, 5thMar, 2/1, 3/1, 2/5,\r\n          3/5 ComdDs, Sep 52; KMC Regt UnitRpts 188–189, dtd 6–7\r\n          Sep 52.\r\n\r\nThe new division commander shortly received a first-hand demonstration\r\nof the ferocity and persistence of the Chinese Communists opposite his\r\ndivision. On 4 September, the enemy suddenly stepped up his activities\r\nwhich had recently been limited to sporadic probes and occasional\r\nartillery fire against Bunker Hill. At 2030 that date Captain Moak,\r\nE/2/1, commanding officer at the Bunker outpost, reported that an\r\nartillery preparation was falling on his positions. Ten minutes later\r\nhe radioed 3/1[214] that an enemy platoon was vigorously probing his\r\nright flank. When Company E Marines returned a heavy volume of small\r\narms fire, the enemy retired.\r\n\r\n    [214] Normally a component of the 2d Battalion, Company E\r\n          had been attached to the 3d Battalion on 1 September\r\n          when the company took over the Bunker Hill outpost. The\r\n          relieved Company H was then attached to 2/1, the reserve\r\n          battalion, from 1–3 September.\r\n\r\nThis Chinese withdrawal was only temporary, for the initial probe\r\nproved the forerunner of more serious activity. Again at 0100 on\r\n5 September a heavy deluge of Chinese mortar and artillery began\r\nraining on Hill 122. The intense preparation had apparently convinced\r\nthe Chinese attacking force that they had eliminated resistance at\r\nthe Marine outpost, for their soldiers walked upright toward Marine\r\npositions, without bothering to make any attempts at concealment. After\r\ndiscovering that a stout defense was still being maintained at Bunker,\r\nthe Chinese again withdrew and reorganized.\r\n\r\nWhen they resumed the attack, the Chinese used considerably greater\r\ncaution. This time, in addition to small arms, automatic weapons fire,\r\nand a hail of grenades, their assault was supported by artillery and\r\nmortars. The results of this concerted effort were not too rewarding,\r\nhowever. Assaults on the center of Hill 122 were repulsed and attempts\r\nto crack the left perimeter of Company E’s defenses were even more\r\nspeedily beaten back. A number of Chinese attempting to outflank the\r\nE/2/1 defenders inadvertently strayed too far to the right of the\r\noutpost and found themselves advancing against the MLR south of Hill\r\n122.\r\n\r\nWhen JAMESTOWN forces engaged these wanderers by fire, the latter\r\nquickly realized their mistake and wheeled left for a hasty retreat.\r\nThey immediately came under fire of their own troops, some of whom\r\nhad meanwhile penetrated 60 yards into the extreme right of the\r\nBunker positions. At this point, Captain Moak’s Company E launched\r\na counterattack and restored its positions on the right. This\r\naction forced a general withdrawal of the Chinese force, which the\r\nMarines estimated at battalion strength. Lieutenant Colonel Sidney\r\nJ. Altman[215] subsequently advised division headquarters that his\r\nmen had killed 30 enemy soldiers and estimated that as many as 305\r\nwere probably wounded. This high rate of casualties was attributed,\r\nin part, to the enemy’s mistaken sense of direction, their direct\r\nwalking approach which had made them easy standing targets, and to\r\nthe box-me-in artillery fires supporting the defenders. Marine losses\r\nwere 12 killed and 40 wounded, caused mostly by Chinese mortars and\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\n    [215] On 20 August Lieutenant Colonel Altman became the\r\n          commander of 3/1 in relief of Lieutenant Colonel Armitage.\r\n\r\nAlthough the left battalion area was the center of attention in the\r\n1st Marines line early on 5 September, the far right sector was not\r\nentirely neglected either. Five minutes after their initial attack\r\non Bunker, other Chinese units also lunged at the Hill 48A outpost,\r\nStromboli. An estimated reinforced platoon, supported by three active\r\nmachine guns on Hill 104, 850 yards to the north, employed submachine\r\nguns, rifles, and grenades in their attack. This battle lasted for\r\nnearly two hours, until the Chinese soldiers withdrew at 0240. There\r\nwere no Marine losses. No tally or estimate was made on the number\r\nof enemy KIA or WIA. It was presumed that some of the Communists did\r\nbecome casualties since the three machine guns that had been chattering\r\naway to support the attacker’s ground action suddenly went silent after\r\nMarines called down mortar and artillery fire on the Hill 104 positions.\r\n\r\nThe probes of 1st Marines positions at Bunker Hill and, to a lesser\r\ndegree, at Stromboli were repeated in the 5th Marines right regimental\r\nsector. At almost exactly the same time Colonel Eustace R. Smoak’s\r\nregiment[216] was struck at five of its forward outposts. In the case\r\nof OP Gary, on the right, the enemy merely shelled the position for\r\n40 minutes. Against the four other outposts, known as Allen, Bruce,\r\nClarence, and Felix, the Chinese employed both fire and assault\r\ntroops. (See Map 12.) At Felix the action had begun at 0130, a half\r\nhour later than at the adjacent outposts. The difference was probably\r\ndue to a C/1/5 ambush[217] which had engaged an enemy force operating\r\nbetween Donald and Felix. After a brief five minute fire fight the\r\nMarines broke off the action, pulling back to Felix. The other three\r\noutposts, clustered to the left of the 3/5 sector, received the brunt\r\nof the enemy thrust which lasted for an hour and 20 minutes before the\r\nCommunists withdrew.\r\n\r\n    [216] Colonel Smoak had relieved Colonel Culhane on 15 August.\r\n\r\n    [217] Although 1/5 (Lieutenant Colonel Alexander W. Gentleman)\r\n          was the regimental reserve at this time, the regiment had\r\n          assigned one company to 2/5, manning the right sector.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 12      K. WHITE\r\n\r\nCOMBAT OUTPOSTS AND AMBUSH SITES\r\n\r\n5TH MARINES SECTOR\r\n\r\n(Division Right)\r\n\r\nEarly September 1952]\r\n\r\nEmploying a squad against both Allen and Clarence, and sending a\r\nreinforced company against Bruce, the enemy alternately assaulted and\r\nshelled the positions until 0420, after which the Communist units\r\npoliced the battlefield for casualties and withdrew to the north.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was no official estimate of enemy losses, one Marine at\r\noutpost Bruce was credited with inflicting approximately 200 casualties\r\nby fire from two machine guns, a carbine, and grenades. He was Private\r\nFirst Class Alford L. McLaughlin, of I/3/5, who was later to receive\r\nthe Medal of Honor for “conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity.” Another\r\nMarine from the same company was posthumously awarded the medal.\r\nPrivate First Class Fernando L. Garcia, although gravely wounded, had\r\nthrown himself on a hostile grenade to save the life of his platoon\r\nsergeant during the Chinese rush to take OP Bruce.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak the I/3/5 defenders at Bruce, commanded by Captain\r\nEdward Y. Holt, Jr., were confronted by an almost unbelievable\r\nscene of destruction. All of the bunkers on the forward side of the\r\nhill had been destroyed by Chinese mortar and artillery; on the\r\nreverse slope, only two had escaped ruination. Marine losses were 32\r\ndead and wounded.[218] To restore the position the 3/5 commander,\r\nLieutenant Colonel Oscar T. Jensen, Jr., directed replacements forward\r\nimmediately. Carrying emergency supplies, including building materials,\r\nthe relief element reached Bruce about 1000. Evacuation of casualties\r\nwas the first task and at 1045 the relieved detail was on its way back\r\nto the MLR. Later that day a supply party reached the outpost, having\r\nbeen temporarily delayed by Chinese interdicting fire.\r\n\r\n    [218] Still another award of the Medal of Honor was to come\r\n          out of the action that ended on 5 September. Hospitalman\r\n          Third Class Edward C. Benfold had ministered aid to\r\n          several wounded Marines and was searching for others\r\n          who needed medical attention when he saw two wounded\r\n          Marines in a shell crater. Just as he neared its edge two\r\n          grenades fell into it and two Chinese prepared to assault\r\n          the Marines. “Picking up a grenade in each hand, Benfold\r\n          leaped out of the crater and hurled himself against the\r\n          onrushing hostile soldiers, pushing the grenades against\r\n          their chests and killing both.... He gallantly gave his\r\n          life for his country.” Medal of Honor citation, case of\r\n          Hospital Corpsman Third Class Edward C. Benfold, USN,\r\n          4168234.\r\n\r\nReinforcement of Bruce and the repair of its defenses were considerably\r\nslowed by the continuous rain of enemy projectiles during daylight.\r\nMarine and USAF pilots bombed and napalmed enemy bunkers and troops\r\nnorth of JAMESTOWN in the 5th Marines sector. Ten air strikes were\r\nexecuted in support of the 5th Marines that day.\r\n\r\nEarly on 6 September, 10 minutes after midnight, long-range machine gun\r\nfire, buttressed by artillery and mortars, hit outpost Bruce. After 35\r\nminutes the firing subsided, but again at 0305 the outpost experienced\r\na heavy rate of incoming. At about this time, the Communist soldiers\r\nmassed for an assault on the battered position. Marine defenders called\r\ndown the artillery box, and the Chinese dispersed.\r\n\r\nThat evening, at 1915, the outpost commander reported that the Chinese\r\nhad again resumed a steady shelling of the position. The bombardment\r\ncontinued for an hour. After these heavy preparatory fires, a wave of\r\nenemy infantry began scrambling up the sides of Bruce. At the same\r\ntime, outpost Allen to the left came under long-range fire from enemy\r\nstrongholds to the west and north. After the Chinese made their initial\r\nrush against Bruce, a second and third attack fared no better. Each was\r\nmet and repulsed by the 5th Marines.\r\n\r\nAfter the third abortive attack, a period of deathly stillness\r\ndescended upon the contested hill. Occasionally, an enemy mortar round\r\nfound its mark among the scattered, splintered bunker timbers and the\r\ncaved-in trenches, which connected the sandbag and lumber positions.\r\nAt 0145 on the 7th, the Chinese interrupted the uneasy peace that had\r\nsettled upon Bruce with a brief, heavy preparatory fire.\r\n\r\nExactly an hour later, an estimated two Chinese companies advanced up\r\nthe forward slopes, using demolitions to destroy any friendly bunkers\r\ntheir artillery and mortar had not earlier completely wrecked. By the\r\ntime this newest assault had raged for 30 minutes, nearly every 3/5\r\ndefender had become a casualty. Still the Marines refused to give\r\nground, dealing first with the forward slope assault by the Chinese and\r\nlater with those who attempted to envelop the Marines on the reverse\r\nside. On the MLR Marines first observed enemy flares falling between\r\noutpost Bruce and Line JAMESTOWN. Soon thereafter the Chinese policed\r\nthe battlefield. By 0400 the Communists retired, and the fight for this\r\nkey outpost had ended in failure.\r\n\r\nDuring the 51-hour siege of Outpost Bruce, 19 Marines had been killed\r\nand 38 wounded. At the adjacent 5th Marines outposts, additional losses\r\nwere 5 killed and 32 wounded. More than 200 enemy dead were counted.\r\nDuring the last eight hours of the vicious, close-in fighting at Bruce,\r\nit was estimated that another 200 Chinese had been wounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 13      K. White\r\n\r\nCOMBAT OUTPOSTS\r\n\r\nKMC SECTOR\r\n\r\n(Division Left)\r\n\r\n5–7 September 1952]\r\n\r\nThe Korean Marines, holding down the western flank of the three\r\nmainland regimental sectors in the 1st Marine Division line, also\r\nreceived a share of the enemy’s attention. At dusk on 5 September,\r\nChinese barrages began to smash Outpost 37,[219] the first of a trio\r\nof positions that would merit hostile attention for the next 22 hours.\r\nThroughout the following day the Chinese continued their mortar\r\nand artillery fire against Outposts 37 and 36, and the regimental\r\nobservation post located on Hill 155 (also called Hill 167) to the rear\r\nof the MLR. (See Map 13.) The heaviest enemy fire was directed against\r\nOP 36, a small rise in the low land terrain midway between the Sachon\r\nRiver, on the west and the Munsan-ni-Kaesong rail line, 600 yards to\r\nthe east.\r\n\r\n    [219] Contemporary records of the 1st KMC Regiment for\r\n          1952–1953 identify this as Outpost 37. Current reviewer\r\n          comments refer to this hill as OP 67. LtCol Kim Yong Kyu,\r\n          ROKMC, ltr to CMC, HQMC, dtd 5 Jul 67.\r\n\r\nAt 1605 a 50-round barrage struck OP 36. After this harassing fire\r\nthere was a lull until 1810 when Chinese artillery and mortars again\r\nresumed a steady pounding of the three positions. One hour later enemy\r\nsoldiers hit both outposts. Twice the attacking company assaulted OP 37\r\nbut neither effort represented, in the view of the defenders, a serious\r\nattempt at capture. Less than a mile south at OP 36, however, the enemy\r\nmotive appeared to be quite different.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Sachon just north of the Freedom Gate Bridge (also known\r\nas the highway bridge), the Communist infantry moved to assault\r\npositions on the west, north, and northeast sides of the outpost. At\r\n1910, the Chinese began their first rush. It was repulsed, as was a\r\nsecond one. Another artillery barrage, joined this time by tank fire,\r\npreceded the third attempt. At this point communications went out at\r\nthe besieged outpost. At 2150, a squad leader from OP 36 reached the\r\n10th Company CP to report that his position had fallen. In 30 minutes a\r\ncommunications link was reestablished with the outpost. The defending\r\nKoreans reported that although enemy troops had overrun much of the\r\nhill, they had subsequently withdrawn, apparently because their losses\r\nhad been so heavy.\r\n\r\nCasualties and damage were severe. The Korean regiment estimated\r\nthat 110 enemy had been killed or wounded. An early morning KMC\r\nreconnaissance patrol counted 33 dead Chinese in the vicinity of OP 36.\r\nThe attacking force had also left behind much equipment, including more\r\nthan 100 grenades and several automatic weapons. No papers were found\r\non the dead Communist soldiers, but many propaganda leaflets had been\r\ndropped around the outpost. Korean Marine losses at OP 36 were nine\r\nkilled and seven wounded. At OP 37 there were four casualties; at the\r\nregimental CP, one Korean and two U.S. Marines had been killed by enemy\r\nartillery. Chinese incoming, estimated at 2,500 rounds during the two\r\nactions, had also caused major damage to part of the OP 36 defenses,\r\nbut inflicted less harm to the other two positions. Repairs were begun\r\nbefore daylight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Korean COPS Hit Again_[220]\r\n\r\n    [220] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdD, Sep 52; KMC Regt UnitRpts\r\n          195–202, dtd 13–20 Sep 52.\r\n\r\nAfter the stepped-up enemy ground activity in early September, both\r\nChinese and Marine frontline units resumed their earlier pattern\r\nof combat patrols, probes, and ambushes. Possession of Bunker Hill\r\nremained the immediate objective of the enemy and his activities in\r\nthe middle of the Marine line were directed to this goal. Once again\r\non 9 September a marauding Chinese platoon, employing grenades and\r\nsubmachine guns, sounded out the Bunker defenses, now manned by G/3/1\r\n(Captain William F. Whitbeck, Jr.). After a tentative investigation,\r\nthe enemy withdrew. That same day, expanded patrol and raiding\r\nactivities were undertaken by Marine line battalions.\r\n\r\nThese sharply increased offensive measures resulted, in part, from the\r\nCommunist interest, as evinced during the summer truce negotiations, in\r\ncertain forward positions held by UNC units. On 7 September, the CG, I\r\nCorps had alerted his division commanders to the fact that the enemy\r\n“may attempt to seize and hold certain key terrain features ... over\r\nwhich there was extensive disagreement during [the 1952 summer truce]\r\nnegotiations for the present line of demarcation.”[221] Since much of\r\nthe critical land was in his sector, Major General Kendall further\r\nwarned his division commanders “to take the necessary action within\r\nyour means to hold all terrain now occupied by your divisions.”[222]\r\nCritical terrain features in the 1st Marine Division area of\r\nresponsibility were Bunker Hill and the height on which COP Bruce had\r\nbeen established (Hill 148), in the center and right regimental sectors\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n    [221] 1stMarDiv ComdD, Sep 52, App. I, # 8.\r\n\r\n    [222] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nTwo days later, General Pollock amplified this directive by\r\nunderscoring the necessity for holding these two positions, plus eight\r\nmore he considered vital for sound tactical defense. These additional\r\npositions, from west to east, were Hills 86 and 37 in the KMC sector;\r\nHills 56 and 48A in the center sector; and the outposts then known as\r\nAllen, Clarence, Felix, and Jill, all the responsibility of the right\r\nregiment.[223]\r\n\r\n    [223] When the 7th Marines took over this sector from the 5th\r\n          in early September, the names changed to Carson, Vegas,\r\n          Detroit, and Seattle respectively. COP Bruce was also\r\n          redesignated as Reno. Since the old names of the outposts\r\n          were well known to the enemy, for purposes of security\r\n          it was decided to identify them differently. U.S. cities\r\n          were selected.\r\n\r\nAlthough the eastern part of the division main line thus contained\r\nat this time more key hills than any other Marine sector, much of\r\nthe increase in Marine patrol and ambush activity took place in\r\nNo-Man’s-Land forward of the middle frontline regiment. Of the two\r\nJAMESTOWN sectors manned by U.S. Marines, the one in the center of the\r\ndivision area offered better ground for infantry operations.\r\n\r\nOn the divisional western flank, the Korean Marines conducted frequent\r\ninfantry-tank patrols during the second and third weeks of September,\r\nbut the enemy opposite the KMCs initiated little ground activity.\r\nInstead, the Chinese relied upon their supporting weapons to provide\r\nthe contact. For a seven-day period ending 19 September, a total of\r\n2,375 enemy rounds had fallen in that regimental sector, an average of\r\n339 per day. Nearly a third had been in the vicinity of Hill 36.\r\n\r\nBefore sunrise on the 19th, a Chinese infantry company had crossed the\r\nSachon in the vicinity of the railroad bridge. Once on the east side,\r\nthe enemy soldiers concealed themselves in caves and holes, remaining\r\nthere until dusk. Then, when they came out of hiding, the Communists\r\nheld a briefing and organized themselves into three attack groups. As\r\nthese advance infantry elements approached their objective, OP 36,\r\nother reinforcing units were prepared to seize OP 37, to the east, and\r\nOPs 33 and 31, to the south. Artillery and mortar preparation supported\r\nthese diversionary attacks.\r\n\r\nThe main assault was accompanied by even heavier shelling. As the three\r\nassault units reached the bottom of the hill at OP 36, artillery,\r\nmortars, and tanks had fired more than 400 rounds. Approaching from\r\nthe north, east, and west, the Chinese scrambled up the hill, gaining\r\ncontrol of the wrecked defenses by 2000. Sporadic exchanges of fire\r\nlasted until nearly midnight. At 0115 the Korean Marines attempted\r\nto retake the hill. The counterattack was cut short, however, upon\r\ndiscovery of another enemy unit moving towards the outpost and then\r\nonly one-half mile away. Three hours later the enemy came back in\r\nstrength when a CCF platoon successfully overthrew the outpost at\r\n0520. This new assault occurred without any warning and was so swiftly\r\nexecuted that a number of the KMC defenders found themselves encircled\r\nand trapped at their posts. Most managed to escape, but several were\r\ncaptured and later evacuated when the Chinese removed their own battle\r\ncasualties.\r\n\r\nAnother attempt to regain the outpost was made by the Koreans at 1400,\r\nfollowing artillery preparation and two air strikes. Three Marine\r\nattack squadrons, VMAs-323, -121, and -212 blasted the Chinese on the\r\nfront slope of OP 36. The contour of the far side of the hill had\r\nprovided the enemy a defiladed position and safety from 1st Marine\r\nDivision organic weapons. But the MAG-12 air sorties, destroying\r\nmany CCF automatic weapons and mortars and breaking up a company\r\nstrongpoint, helped the Koreans counterattack and overrun the dazed\r\ndefenders. Two KMC platoons, supported by artillery, mortar, and tank\r\nfire, then carried the OP after overcoming token Chinese resistance.\r\nAfter the enemy vacated OP 36, he still continued to remain in the low\r\narea to the northwest, close to the east side of the Sachon River. No\r\nserious attempt was made by the enemy to occupy the position for the\r\nrest of the month.\r\n\r\nThe 20-hour clash for control of OP 36 was believed to have developed\r\nfrom the Chinese ambition to occupy the position and thereby eliminate\r\nthe harassing fires from Hill 36 that had struck CCF mainline troops.\r\nThe 19–20 September attempts to wrest the outpost from Korean control\r\nresulted in an estimated 150 Chinese casualties, including 20 counted\r\ndead. KMC losses were placed at 16 killed, 47 wounded, and 6 missing.\r\n\r\nOn the day that the second September battle for OP 36 had ended, the\r\nCommandant of the Marine Corps had also just concluded his three-day\r\nvisit and inspection of General Pollock’s troops. Visiting every\r\nbattalion in the division, General Shepherd was impressed by the\r\nmorale and proficiency of the Marines, including the attached 1st KMC\r\nRegiment. During his visit to Korea, the Marine Corps Commandant was\r\nalso presented the Order of Military Merit, Taiguk, by President Rhee.\r\nGeneral Shepherd ended his Korean battlefront visit after a two-day\r\ninspection of 1st Marine Aircraft Wing units commanded by Major General\r\nJerome (he had received his second star on 6 August).\r\n\r\n\r\n_More Enemy Assaults in Late September_[224]\r\n\r\n    [224] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv, 1stMar, 7thMar, 2/1 ComdDs, Sep\r\n          52.\r\n\r\nEven though the enemy had concentrated his strongest infantry attack\r\nin late September against the Korean Marines, his most frequent probes\r\nwere launched against center regimental positions held by Colonel\r\nLayer’s 1st Marines. Here the enemy was more consistent in conducting\r\nhis defense. Chinese troops doggedly held on to the northern slopes\r\nof several Marine outposts, notably Hills 124 and 122. In this center\r\nregimental sector, the enemy initiated several attacks, the most\r\nsignificant of these occurring on the 20th.\r\n\r\nThis action against the left sector manned by 2/1 centered about Hill\r\n124, where Lieutenant Colonel Batterton’s battalion had established a\r\n24-hour, squad-size outpost three days earlier. At 0345, Marines on\r\nHill 124 observed two green flares fired from a hill about 1,100 yards\r\nto their front. At the same time the men of 2/1 observed numerous\r\nfigures moving about downhill from their own position. It soon became\r\nevident that four enemy groups were converging on Hill 124 and\r\npreparing to assault the Marine defenses which shortly came under fire\r\nfrom enemy submachine guns and rifles. The main probe was a frontal\r\nassault against Batterton’s men; it was made by about 20 Chinese and\r\nlasted only five minutes. Afterwards, all four assault groups withdrew\r\nbut continued firing intermittently at the Marine squad. Nearly every\r\nMarine on the hill suffered wounds, most of these minor. Enemy losses\r\nfor the action were placed at 22.\r\n\r\nIn this same sector Marines in late September attacked the northern\r\nslope of Hill 122, where the enemy still maintained a foothold. The\r\nproximity of Marine defenses at Bunker Hill to enemy positions,\r\nseparated in some places by as little as 30 yards, was the cause of\r\nfrequent contact and clashes. Marines raided the enemy side of Bunker,\r\nusing demolitions and portable flamethrowers to destroy trenches and\r\nbunkers, and their occupants. Tanks and artillery assisted in these\r\nbrief offensive actions, usually undertaken at night. Flares were used\r\nfrequently to aid in identifying and striking targets and in assessing\r\nthe results.\r\n\r\nIt became routine during the last days of September for the Chinese\r\nto probe the Marine defenses at the Hills 124–122 axis. There did not\r\nappear to be a serious or determined assault to take either outpost,\r\nhowever. The Marines considered the infantry probes as just another\r\nform of harassment, although perhaps more personal and direct than\r\nthe Chinese shelling, which inflicted daily losses. On the division\r\nright, Colonel Moore’s 7th Marines, which had moved into this sector on\r\n7 September, found enemy activities about the same. Artillery rounds\r\ncaused the greatest number of casualties, although these attacks were\r\nnot particularly spirited. Many enemy contacts occurred during the\r\nMarine combat patrols that largely characterized frontline operations\r\nat the end of September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chinese Intensify Their Outpost Attacks_[225]\r\n\r\n    [225] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: FMFPac, _1stMarDiv Sum, Jul-Oct 52_;\r\n          1stMarDiv ComdD, Oct 52; 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnls, 1–7 Oct 52;\r\n          1stMarDiv PIRS 706–713, dtd 1–8 Oct 52; 1stMar, 5thMar,\r\n          7thMar, 11thMar, 3/1, 1/7, 2/7, 3/7 ComdDs, Oct 52; KMC\r\n          Regt UnitRpts 214–220, dtd 2–8 Oct. 52.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of October, the 1st Marine Division became aware of\r\ncertain changes that were occurring to its front. In the center sector,\r\nfor the first time in two weeks there was no significant enemy ground\r\nactivity, yet across the entire Marine front there was a build-up of\r\nenemy shelling. Part of the increased bombardment was directed at Hill\r\n86 in the KMC sector, one of the positions recently cited as integral\r\nto the defense line in this area. Beginning at 2000 on 1 October, the\r\nChinese broadcast a warning that they would knock down the outpost\r\nbunkers there unless the Korean Marines surrendered. When the KMCs\r\nmanning the position did not, of course, surrender in reaction to\r\nthis blatant propaganda tactic, the Chinese began showering Hill 86\r\nwith artillery rounds. During the next 20 hours, 145 rounds fell on\r\nand around the outpost. This incident marked the first time that the\r\nChinese mainline forces had carried out an announced threat.\r\n\r\nThis type of operational tactic--first to warn, then to carry out\r\nthe threat--was not, however, the reason for the increased Chinese\r\nshelling. Rather, as it turned out, the enemy was about to embark on\r\na series of limited objective attacks against the division flanks,\r\nstarting first with major outposts guarding the most critical terrain\r\non the MLR. The artillery and mortar fire of the 1st had been but an\r\ninitial step. At 1830 on 2 October, Communist direct fire weapons\r\nopened up from an area 2,800 yards northwest of OP 36, lashing all the\r\nKMC outposts within range. A tank platoon, dispatched to counter the\r\nfire, returned at 1915 without having located the hostile emplacements.\r\nShortly after the tanks returned, an extremely heavy artillery barrage\r\nagain fell upon all of the KMC regimental outposts. Ten minutes later,\r\nseemingly on the signal of one red and one green flare, the enemy guns\r\nlifted their preparatory fires to permit an infantry attack. The ground\r\naction simultaneously struck OPs 37, 36, and 86, the forward positions\r\nclosest to the Sachon River.\r\n\r\nAt OP 37, the defending Korean Marine platoon fought valiantly for more\r\nthan an hour against the assault of two enemy platoons, each of which\r\nrequired a company-size reinforcement before the Korean Marines were\r\nfinally ousted. Although temporarily dislodged, they reorganized at the\r\nbase of the position for a counterattack. Two counterattacks were made\r\nthe next day, the second one carrying the Koreans to the top of the\r\nhill. Fierce enemy mortar and artillery shelling forced them to seek\r\nthe shelter of the reverse slope before again renewing their assault.\r\nOn 4–5 October, the outpost changed hands four times. At 1340 on the\r\nlatter date, a heavy enemy artillery and ground attack compelled the\r\nKMCs to abandon their ravaged outpost; this withdrawal ended friendly\r\ncontrol of OP 37 for the rest of the month.\r\n\r\nNearby OP 36 was also lost. In the course of the night the Korean\r\nMarines on OP 36 turned back two Communist assaults, but fell under\r\nthe weight of the third. By sunup on 3 October, the exhausted Korean\r\nMarines were forced to give ground; the Chinese immediately occupied OP\r\n36 and held it.\r\n\r\nOne more KMC outpost was to fall during the first week. OP 86 guarded\r\nthe southwestern two-thirds of the regimental sector and frequently was\r\nthe target of artillery shelling and ground attacks. This position was\r\nalso the most distant from the main line and the closest to the Sachon\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nThe heaviest Communist attack on 2 October was against the KMC platoons\r\ndefending Hill 86. Nearly a battalion of Chinese took part in this\r\naction, finally overpowering the outpost just before midnight. The\r\ndefenders withdrew south to the bottom of the hill, where they were\r\ncomparatively safe from enemy fire. Resting, receiving reinforcements,\r\nand regrouping during the early morning hours of the 3d, the Korean\r\nMarine force observed friendly artillery and air pound the outpost\r\npreparatory to their counterattack. It was made at 1015 and succeeded,\r\nafter two hours fighting, in routing the Chinese from the outpost.\r\n\r\nWhile the enemy was counteracting the ground loss with artillery and\r\nmortars, Marine air flushed out the Chinese, who had retreated only a\r\nshort distance from the outpost. From atop the hill, Korean Marines\r\nwitnessed many of the enemy hurriedly leaving the area under attack.\r\nThis scattering of the enemy force prevented the Chinese from launching\r\nan immediate counterattack for control of OP 86 and gave the Korean\r\nMarines additional time in which to prepare their defenses. At 2200 on\r\n6 October, an enemy force of undetermined size assaulted the position\r\nand wrested it from the Koreans before the end of the day. Early the\r\nnext morning a KMC counterattack was successful, but at 0640 the\r\nKoreans were again compelled to withdraw, due to devastating blows from\r\nChinese artillery. Loss of the third key outpost during the first week\r\nof October, ended for a time the flare-up of outpost fighting in the\r\nleft regimental sector of the division front.\r\n\r\nThe middle part of the MLR, held in early October by the 1st Marines,\r\nreceived the least enemy attention in this period. Although frequent\r\ncontacts were made with the enemy during the first part of the month,\r\nno outposts were lost. Most of the action was minor, _i.e._, patrol\r\nengagements and Communist probes centered around Bunker Hill and Hill\r\n124. Late on 5 October, a combat patrol from H/3/1 became involved in\r\nthe most important ground action in Colonel Layer’s area during early\r\nOctober. These Marines were surprised by a larger Chinese force lying\r\nin wait. The ambushers held their fire until the Marine combat patrol\r\nhad cleared a small hilltop. At 2230, after a 20-minute fire fight, the\r\npatrol withdrew to the reverse slope of the rise, called in 81mm mortar\r\nfire, then broke contact, and returned to the MLR. There were 4 Marine\r\ncasualties, and by count, 13 dead Chinese.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest number of personal losses at this time occurred\r\nin the right area held by the 7th Marines, where the Chinese began\r\na series of limited objective attacks against outposts guarding the\r\ndivision right flank. These offensives to obtain critical terrain\r\nin this sector, and others manned by the 1st Marine Division, would\r\ncontinue intermittently right up to the brink of the cease-fire, in\r\nJuly 1953.\r\n\r\nIn early October, Colonel Moore’s troops manned nine permanent combat\r\noutposts. (See Map 14.) Seven of these had been taken over when\r\nthe regiment relieved the 5th Marines in September. Two additional\r\nones--Frisco and Verdun--had been established by the 7th Marines on\r\nthe 14th and 26th, respectively. Of these nine forward positions, the\r\nCommunists chose to concentrate on four, which formed a diagonal line\r\nroughly paralleling the center sector of the MLR at an average distance\r\nof about 450 yards. This quartet--Detroit, Frisco, Seattle, and\r\nWarsaw--together with Verdun,[226] at the 1st Commonwealth boundary,\r\ncomprised the easternmost permanent outposts of the division. The first\r\nfour positions were, on the average, slightly lower in elevation than\r\nthe COPs in the regimental area to the west.\r\n\r\n    [226] The outpost at the extreme right flank was given the name\r\n          “Verdun” because of its World War I connotation of “They\r\n          shall not pass.” Col. Leo J. Dulacki ltr to Hd, HistBr,\r\n          G-3 Div, HQMC, dtd 2 Jun 67, hereafter _Dulacki ltr_.\r\n\r\nThe frontline contest began with little forewarning other than a\r\nslight increase in enemy artillery and machine gun fire against\r\nFrisco and a light probe against Detroit. At 1836 on 2 October, the\r\nCommunists launched a heavy artillery and mortar barrage against\r\nSeattle and Warsaw, and that part of the MLR nearest Seattle. Exactly\r\none hour later, the preparation on the outposts lifted, permitting the\r\nenemy attack force to strike. Not less than a company assaulted the\r\nreinforced platoon on Warsaw, while a squad moved against the Seattle\r\ndefenders. Warsaw fell in about 45 minutes,[227] Seattle held out five\r\nminutes longer.\r\n\r\n    [227] During the latter stage of the fight for Warsaw, a\r\n          Chinese soldier tossed a grenade into a bunker shared by\r\n          five Marines. Private Jack W. Kelso, of I/3/7, quickly\r\n          picked up the missile and ran outside with it. As he was\r\n          throwing the grenade back to the Chinese, it went off in\r\n          his hand. Disregarding his wounds, the Marine moved back\r\n          inside the shelter, directed the other four to return to\r\n          the MLR and went outside to cover their exit. As he was\r\n          firing at the advancing Chinese soldiers, Private Kelso\r\n          was hit several times by enemy bullets. His “conspicuous\r\n          gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life” was\r\n          later recognized in the posthumous award of the Medal of\r\n          Honor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 14      K. WHITE\r\n\r\n7TH MARINES SECTOR\r\n\r\n(Division Right)\r\n\r\nEARLY OCTOBER 1952]\r\n\r\nImmediately, plans for the recapture of both were made. At 2047,\r\nCaptain John H. Thomas dispatched a platoon from his company, I/3/7,\r\nfrom the MLR to counterattack Warsaw. The platoon quickly took the\r\nposition, for the enemy had withdrawn. At Seattle, the result was\r\ndifferent. On 3 October, two squads from Company I departed JAMESTOWN\r\nat 0340, but came under enemy artillery fire en route to the objective.\r\nThe squads worked their way forward nevertheless, but were unable\r\nto take the outpost. Captain Thomas then recalled the force, which\r\nreached JAMESTOWN at dawn. Later that day, just before dusk, air and\r\nartillery placed a smoke screen on Seattle while two squads advanced\r\ntoward the outpost. When the counterattack met stiff resistance, a\r\nsquad-size reinforcement[228] was sent from the MLR. Together the\r\nthree units attempted to retake the position, but were forced to pull\r\nback because of heavy casualties. As the infantry again regrouped,\r\nLieutenant Colonel Bert Davis, Jr.’s 2/11 fired preparatory barrages\r\non the Chinese occupying Seattle. At 2225 the Marines assaulted the\r\noutpost again; as before, overpowering Chinese artillery and grenades\r\ninflicted such high casualties that the counterattackers were compelled\r\nto withdraw.\r\n\r\n    [228] This squad was from Company A (Captain Frederick C.\r\n          McLaughlin), which came under the operational control of\r\n          3/7 at 1130 on 3 October, relieving Company C (Captain\r\n          Paul B. Byrum). The latter company had reported to the 3d\r\n          Battalion from regimental reserve at 2130 the previous\r\n          day. Company D was sent immediately to reinforce the\r\n          hard-pressed Company I.\r\n\r\nBy this time, action at the two outposts had resulted in 101 Marine\r\ncasualties, including 13 killed. By sundown on 3 October, the regiment\r\nhad been forced off the two COPs and had been able to retake only one\r\nof them. Against Warsaw, the one that the Marines had recaptured, the\r\nChinese immediately launched a counterattack. At 0145 on 4 October\r\na platoon struck the position. This time the Warsaw garrison held,\r\ninflicting losses on the CCF and receiving none. The Chinese made an\r\nunsuccessful attempt against Frisco at 2300 on 5 October, when a squad\r\nattempted to drive the Marines from the outpost.\r\n\r\nThe enemy’s repeated attacks and apparent determination to seize\r\ncommanding terrain, plus the heavy casualties suffered by 3/7, led the\r\n7th Marines to reinforce its MLR at 1200 on 5 October. At this time the\r\nright battalion sector then held by 3/7, was split into two sectors and\r\nthe regimental reserve, 1/7 (Lieutenant Colonel Leo J. Dulacki) took\r\nover the far right of the 3/7 line, assuming responsibility for Warsaw\r\nand Verdun.[229] The 7th Marines thus had all three of its battalions\r\non line with the regimental front manned, from the left, by 2/7, 3/7,\r\nand 1/7.\r\n\r\n    [229] At the same time one company, I/3/7, became the\r\n          regimental reserve, having been relieved on the MLR at\r\n          1500 the previous day by A/1/7.\r\n\r\nDuring the next 30 hours, the Communists launched a series of strong\r\nprobing actions against the regimental outposts of the 7th Marines.\r\nAlthough the numerical strength used in these widespread limited\r\nobjective attacks did not exceed that employed in previous large-scale\r\noutpost offensives, the scope of the operation on 6 and 7 October and\r\nthe well-coordinated attacks indicated careful and detailed planning.\r\nEach move against the five outposts and two MLR positions attacked\r\nwas preceded by unusually close attention to artillery and mortar\r\npreparation. This was to a degree unprecedented even when measured\r\nagainst those massive concentrations that had characterized Communist\r\noperations since the Chinese intervention in the war late in 1950.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Communist general attack, the Marines made another attempt\r\nto retake Seattle. Leaving JAMESTOWN at 0600 on 6 October, a C/1/7\r\nreinforced platoon was halted by solid resistance in the form of\r\nexploding artillery and mortar rounds. The forces returned to the MLR,\r\nreorganized, and jumped off again. At 0815, a two-squad reinforcement\r\nwas dispatched from the main line. Meanwhile, the enemy, estimated\r\nat platoon reinforced strength, doubled his garrison, using troops\r\nfrom his outpost line. By 0900, a heavy fire fight was in progress,\r\nsupported by artillery and mortars on both sides. Marines called on\r\nair in support of the attack, but the combined air and infantry action\r\nwas unable to penetrate enemy defenses. Finally, at 1100, after five\r\nhours of close heavy fighting, the Marines broke contact and retired,\r\nbringing with them 12 dead and 44 wounded. Estimates of enemy losses\r\ntotaled 71.\r\n\r\nThat evening, at dusk, artillery and mortar fire began falling on\r\noutpost positions across the entire regimental front and at two\r\nlocations on the MLR. At the same time an estimated Chinese reinforced\r\nbattalion in a coordinated effort advanced toward the Marine line\r\nand at 1930 assaulted the seven positions that had just been under\r\nartillery preparation. By midnight an estimated 4,300 rounds of\r\nartillery fire and 104 rounds of counterbattery fire had fallen on\r\nMarine positions. In the regimental left manned by 2/7 (Lieutenant\r\nColonel Caputo) the attacks appeared to be more of a diversion--merely\r\nprobes by small units, which showed little inclination to press the\r\nattack. Carson, the most western COP held by the regiment, reported\r\nthat the enemy soldiers withdrew at 2050. Two hours later Reno, the\r\nnext outpost to the east, radioed to the MLR that the Chinese had just\r\nceased their attacks at that forward post. A total of 12 Marines were\r\nwounded in these two actions.\r\n\r\nOn the far right, in Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki’s sector, a reinforced\r\nCCF platoon poured over the Warsaw defenses at 1930. Immediately\r\nthe outpost Marines called for the friendly artillery box. As these\r\nprotective fires were being delivered all communication at the outpost\r\nwas severed by hostile fire. Enemy artillery continued at a heavy rate.\r\nBy 2000, however, communication was reestablished between the COP and\r\nMLR. The first message from the besieged outpost was a request for more\r\nartillery. With additional fire support and continued stiff outpost\r\nresistance, the Chinese at 2055 relinquished their quest to regain\r\nWarsaw.\r\n\r\nThe enemy’s most determined assaults on the night of 6–7 October were\r\nmade upon a pair of outposts, Detroit and Frisco, manned by the middle\r\nbattalion, 3/7 (Lieutenant Colonel Gerald F. Russell). Two JAMESTOWN\r\nareas in this sector were also attacked, but only briefly. The assault\r\nagainst the outposts was executed by a Chinese battalion which sent one\r\ncompany against Detroit and another against Frisco, east of Detroit.\r\nBoth outposts were manned by two squads of Marines.\r\n\r\nAt Detroit, the Company G Marines reported that the initial attack\r\nmade at 1940 on 6 October by a Chinese company had been rebuffed. The\r\nenemy did succeed, however, in advancing to the outpost trenchline.\r\nStrong defensive fires prevented him from exploiting this initial gain\r\nby occupying any of the bunkers, and the attackers were forced to pull\r\nback. After regrouping, the Chinese returned at 2100 and again were\r\nable to secure a foothold at the main trench.\r\n\r\nMarine artillery assisted the outpost defenders in repulsing this\r\nnew attack, but not before Chinese interdictory fires had disrupted\r\nall communications between the COP and its MLR support company. Some\r\nChinese had also moved south in the vicinity of the MLR, but these\r\nattacks were neither persistent nor heavily supported. At 2115 the last\r\nof the enemy intruders had withdrawn from the MLR. At about this same\r\ntime, 3/7 heard Detroit request overhead VT fires, but shortly after\r\nthis the battalion again lost contact with the outpost.\r\n\r\nTwo squads were then sent out to reinforce the position. They were\r\nstopped, however, by heavy Chinese artillery barrages. At the outpost,\r\nMarine artillery fires had forced the Chinese to retreat, but at 0015\r\nthe enemy reappeared at the trenchline. The artillery regiment once\r\nagain applied the overhead fire remedy, but with less success--the\r\nChinese, neither retreating nor advancing, took cover in the trenches.\r\nDuring the long night, attempts to reestablish communications with\r\nDetroit had proved fruitless, although battalion radio operators\r\nreported that they had heard Chinese language coming over one of the\r\nMarine radio nets used by the COP. A six-man reconnaissance detail was\r\nsent forward to investigate. It returned at 0355 with the information\r\nthat Detroit was now held by the enemy. Two wounded Marines had\r\nescaped; the rest of the Detroit garrison had fallen to the enemy. At\r\n0630 the Marines withdrew after heavy fighting that had lasted more\r\nthan 10 hours.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier part of the night, while the battle for outpost\r\ncontrol raged at Detroit, reinforcements had also been dispatched to\r\nFrisco to help stabilize the situation at this adjacent Company H/3/7\r\noutpost. Like Detroit, it had been attacked by a Chinese company,\r\nbeginning about 2000. An hour and a half later some of the enemy had\r\nmade their way into the trenchline, but were repulsed with the help of\r\nfriendly artillery VT. Shortly after midnight the enemy again probed\r\nFrisco and reached the trenchline. At 0115, two squads jumped off from\r\nJAMESTOWN, but a rain of Chinese artillery interrupted their progress.\r\nThroughout the early morning hours of 7 October, Company H and I units\r\nwere sent out from the MLR to buttress the Frisco defense and stem the\r\nenemy attack. At 0510, a reinforced platoon from the reserve company\r\nwas sent to renew the counterattack. It was this Company I unit that\r\nfinally restored control of the COP to the Marines.[230] Another\r\nreinforcing platoon arrived at the outpost just as the Marines there\r\nhad evicted the remaining Chinese assault forces. At 0715, 7 October,\r\nFrisco was declared secure.\r\n\r\n    [230] During the predawn attempt to retake Frisco on 7 October,\r\n          Staff Sergeant Lewis G. Watkins, I/3/7, although already\r\n          wounded, led his rifle platoon in the assault against\r\n          Frisco. When an enemy machine gun impeded their progress,\r\n          Staff Sergeant Watkins grabbed a wounded man’s automatic\r\n          rifle to help get the assault moving forward again. At\r\n          that instant, an enemy grenade landed in the midst of the\r\n          Marines. Staff Sergeant Watkins immediately seized it.\r\n          Just as he was about to hurl it away it exploded in his\r\n          hand. The grenade took the sergeant’s life but he had\r\n          saved his fellow Marines. For his bravery Staff Sergeant\r\n          Watkins was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.\r\n\r\nIts precarious position, however, demanded either an investment of more\r\noutpost troops to retain possession of it or else its abandonment, in\r\nconjunction with other measures to neutralize loss of the position.\r\nAt 1804 that day the latter course was instituted. The 7th Marines\r\nreported that the enemy had suffered an estimated 200 KIA and unknown\r\nWIA as a result of the bitterly contested outpost attacks on 6–7\r\nOctober. Marine casualties were listed as 10 killed, 22 missing, 105\r\nwounded and evacuated, and 23 not-seriously wounded.\r\n\r\nIn all, during the first week in October, the 1st Marine Division gave\r\nup six outposts, or forward positions, that had been sited on some of\r\nthe commanding ground in the Marine area. On the division left, COPs\r\n37, 36, and 86 were the ones most removed from the Korean MLR and thus\r\neasily susceptible to being overrun by the enemy at will and to his\r\nearly reinforcement.[231] The division theorized that near winter and\r\nthe subsequent freezing of the Sachon would facilitate the movement\r\nof Chinese troops and supplies across the river to new positions.\r\nThe enemy was now able to operate patrols east of the river without\r\ninterference. At the opposite side of the division MLR, on its right\r\nflank, Detroit, Frisco, and Seattle had been lost. By gaining this\r\nstring of outposts, the enemy was better able to exert pressure against\r\nother Marine positions forward of the line and the critical ground on\r\nJAMESTOWN.\r\n\r\n    [231] FMFPac, _1stMarDiv Sum, Jul-Oct 52_.\r\n\r\nTo counter this threat, General Pollock strengthened the outposts close\r\nto the MLR and increased his patrolling requirements. It was decided\r\nthat in some cases the mission of the COP--that of providing early\r\nwarning of impending attack and slowing it down--could be accomplished\r\nas effectively by using patrols and listening posts at night.\r\n\r\nBy these activities, the Marines hoped to minimize the Chinese gains\r\nand prevent the launching of new attacks against either division COPs\r\nor JAMESTOWN. The serious situation on the outposts was compounded by\r\nexisting political considerations, which prevented the Marines from\r\ninitiating any real offensive campaigns. Moreover, any hill taken was\r\ninvariably backed up by a still higher one, controlled by the enemy.\r\nThe key factor was not so much holding an individual outpost as it was\r\nto insure that the enemy was unable to penetrate the JAMESTOWN line.\r\n\r\n\r\n_More_ PRESSURE, _More CAS, More Accomplishments_[232]\r\n\r\n    [232] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, Chap. 9; 1st MAW\r\n          ComdDs, Jun-Oct 52; MAG-12 ComdDs, Jun, Sep 52; MAG-33\r\n          ComdD, Aug 52; MACG-2 ComdD, Sep 52; VMA-312 ComdDs,\r\n          Sep-Oct 52; VMA-323 ComdDs, Jun-Jul, Sep 52; VMF(N)-513\r\n          ComdDs, Jun-Jul 52; VMJ-1 ComdD, Jul 52; Cagle and\r\n          Manson, _Sea War, Korea_; Clark, _Danube to Yalu_; Field,\r\n          _NavOps, Korea_; Futrell, _USAF, Korea_; Rees, _Korea_.\r\n\r\nSome of the enemy ground pressure against the outposts in September\r\nand October had been relieved by the increase in the number of air\r\nstrikes received by the 1st Marine Division. De-emphasis of the Air\r\nForce interdiction strategy in favor of striking the enemy wherever\r\n(and whenever) it hurt him most had made available more aircraft for\r\nclose support of ground operations.[233] The UN commander, General\r\nClark, who had given the green light to the shift in USAF policy and\r\ntargets, followed the giant hydroelectric strike in June with a mass\r\nattack the next month on 30 military targets located near the North\r\nKorean Capital. During a year’s freedom from air attack (July 1951-July\r\n1952) Pyongyang had become not only the major logistics center for\r\ncombat equipment and personnel but also the focal point for command and\r\ncontrol of Communist ground and air defense efforts.\r\n\r\n    [233] The 1st MAW chief of staff during this period, then\r\n          Colonel Samuel S. Jack, offered the opinion that “the\r\n          Fifth Air Force was most sympathetic to Division\r\n          requirements for close air support from Wing sources. The\r\n          Eighth Army in the Joint Operations Center proved to be\r\n          the principal limiting factor in the assignment of air\r\n          in accordance with these requests. Also, requirements\r\n          that Division CAS requests filter through I Corps and JOC\r\n          constituted a major factor in Wing response.” _Jack ltr._\r\n\r\nDesignated Operation PRESSURE PUMP, the 11 July strike against\r\nPyongyang called for three separate attacks during daylight and a\r\nfourth at night. This extended time over the target would give enemy\r\nfighters more than ample time to take to the skies in defense of the\r\nCapital. Because Pyongyang “was defended by 48 guns and more than\r\n100 automatic weapons, making it one of the worst ‘flak traps’ in\r\nKorea,”[234] there was considerable hazard in the operation. Added\r\ndanger to the pilots resulted from the decision to forewarn the North\r\nKorean civilian population of the air assault. General Clark explained\r\nthe reason for dropping warning leaflets prior to the attack on\r\nPyongyang:\r\n\r\n    [234] Futrell, _USAF, Korea_, p. 482.\r\n\r\n  The objective was in part humanitarian and in part practical. We\r\n  had to hit Pyongyang because the Communists had made it a major\r\n  military headquarters and stockpile area. We wanted to warn the\r\n  people away from danger areas. By warning them away we disrupted\r\n  their daily lives and made it difficult for the Communists to\r\n  maintain any kind of schedules in their work in the city.[235]\r\n\r\n    [235] Clark, _Danube to Yalu_, pp. 208–209.\r\n\r\nResults indicated that both the destructive and the psychological\r\naspects of the mission were successful. American, British, and ROK\r\nplanes completely destroyed 3 of the 30 military targets attacked. Of\r\nthe rest, only two escaped major damage:\r\n\r\n  According to ... reports, the North Korean Ministry of Industry’s\r\n  underground offices were destroyed and a direct hit on another\r\n  shelter was said to have killed 400 to 500 Communist officials.\r\n  Off the air for two days, Radio Pyongyang finally announced\r\n  that the ‘brutal’ strikes had destroyed 1,500 buildings and had\r\n  inflicted 7,000 casualties.[236]\r\n\r\n    [236] Futrell, _USAF, Korea_, p. 482.\r\n\r\nOf the far-reaching effect of the leaflets, the UN commander later\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n  The warning leaflets, coupled with the bombing, hurt North Korean\r\n  civilian morale badly. The very audacity of the United Nations\r\n  in warning the Communists where bombers would strike hurt morale\r\n  because it emphasized to the North Koreans just how complete was\r\n  UN mastery of the air. Contrarily, it made them see even more\r\n  clearly that the Communists were ineffectual in their efforts to\r\n  ward off our air blows....\r\n\r\n  As a result of the warnings, the bombings, the failure of\r\n  the Communists to provide protection, and the refusal of the\r\n  Communists to permit evacuation of the clearly defined target\r\n  areas, civilian resentment was channeled away from the UNC\r\n  bombers and towards the Communist rulers.[237]\r\n\r\n    [237] Clark, _Danube to Yalu_, p. 209. “I told you so” leaflets\r\n          were dropped after the raid to impress the inhabitants\r\n          with the importance of believing the warning leaflets.\r\n          USAF, _Ops in Korea_, No. 127, pp. 36, 37.\r\n\r\nThe record set by the 1,254 sorties flown in this 11 July operation was\r\nto last only seven weeks. On 29 August, 1,403 sorties were employed in\r\na new strike against the Capital. The massed raids against military\r\ntargets in Pyongyang, known as the “All United Nations Air Effort”\r\nturned out to be the largest one-day air assault during the entire\r\nthree years of the Korean War. Again attacking at four-hour intervals\r\nthree times during daylight, Allied aircraft blasted a list of targets\r\nthat “read like a guide to public offices in Pyongyang and included\r\nsuch points of interest as the Ministry of Rail Transportation, the\r\nMunitions Bureau, Radio Pyongyang, plus many factories, warehouses,\r\nand troop billets.”[238] Of the 45 military targets in the city, 31\r\nreceived moderate-to-severe damage according to post-strike photographs.\r\n\r\n    [238] Futrell, _USAF, Korea_, p. 489.\r\n\r\nSubstitution of the previous interdiction strategy by PRESSURE attacks\r\nbrought increased close air support to frontline troops. As a result\r\nof this expanded number of CAS sorties, wing pilots and ground forward\r\nair controllers greatly increased their operational proficiency.[239]\r\nThe Marines were still not satisfied with the close support picture,\r\nhowever, and neither were a number of U.S. Army commanders. Some of the\r\nlatter regarded General Clark as the champion of more extensive close\r\nair support missions for frontline units, but he quickly dispelled\r\nthis view. Instead, he cautioned these supporters of Marine-type close\r\nair support to accept the existing procedures, which were derived from\r\nthe “vast reservoir of experience ... [representing] the composite view\r\nof senior members of the Armed Forces [with] the longest and most\r\nresponsible experience in close support during World War II.”[240] At\r\nthe same time the UN commander, on 11 August 1952, had advised his\r\nforce commanders to study the factors affecting the close air support\r\nsituation in Korea and comment on certain UNC proposals for improving\r\nthe CAS system.\r\n\r\n    [239] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, p. 9-53.\r\n\r\n    [240] _Ibid._, p. 9-143.\r\n\r\nIn the close air support picture for the Marines, October was a bright\r\nmonth. In the outpost battles of early October, the 1st MAW put 319\r\nsorties in the air during both day and night to strike, strafe, bomb,\r\nand burn enemy positions and troops facing General Pollock’s division.\r\nA new level of achievement had been reached during the Bunker Hill\r\nbattle in August. That month nearly 1,000 aircraft, predominantly\r\nMarine, loosed ordnance at targets on and near the Chinese MLR and OPLR.\r\n\r\nDuring the first six months of Marine ground operations in defense of\r\nJAMESTOWN, wing squadrons and pilots had made major contributions to\r\nthe U.S. air effort in Korea. On 7 June 1952, First Lieutenant John W.\r\nAndre, VMF(N)-513, piloting a World War II model Corsair on a night\r\narmed reconnaissance mission over the west coast of North Korea, shot\r\ndown an enemy piston-driven Yak fighter. It was the first time that a\r\nRussian-built plane of that model had been knocked out of the skies at\r\nnight by another plane. This aircraft was also the fifth kill for the\r\nlieutenant, making him the first Marine nightfighter ace in Korea.[241]\r\n\r\n    [241] The first Marine night ace was Captain Robert Baird, who\r\n          shot down six Japanese planes between 9 June and 14 July\r\n          1945. Sherrod, _Marine Aviation_, p. 404. Lieutenant\r\n          Andre’s first four planes were also downed during World\r\n          War II. See Appendix F for Marine air kills during the\r\n          Korean War.\r\n\r\nNearly three months after that record, another one emerged: the first\r\nMarine to down an enemy jet with a propeller-driven aircraft. Late\r\non the afternoon of 10 September, Captain Jesse G. Folmar and First\r\nLieutenant Willie L. Daniels, both of VMA-312, had taken off from the\r\n_Sicily_ to attack an enemy troop concentration reported to be south\r\nof Chinnampo, on the west coast just below the 39th Parallel. Shortly\r\nafter reaching the vicinity of the target, the Marine Corsairs were\r\njumped by a pair of MIG-15s. Two more Russian-made jets tore into the\r\nfight. During a fast exchange of cannon and machine gun fire, the\r\nMarine captain was able to score lethal hits on one of the MIGs. When\r\nfour more of them picked up the chase, the vastly outnumbered Marines\r\nbroke for home, heading westward in a diving turn.\r\n\r\nCaptain Folmar’s return to the _Sicily_ was delayed almost immediately:\r\n\r\n  I had just started picking up good diving speed when I saw balls\r\n  of tracer ammo passing on my left and at the same instant felt a\r\n  severe explosion in my left wing ... I saw that the left aileron\r\n  and four feet of my left wing were gone.[242]\r\n\r\n    [242] VMA-312 ComdD, Sep 52.\r\n\r\nThis damage caused the plane to rapidly go out of control. While still\r\nable to maneuver, the Marine aviator headed for the sea and as he\r\nneared it, bailed out of his Corsair and parachuted into the ocean.\r\nA rescue plane out of Cho-do picked him up and returned the captain,\r\nwho had sustained a slight shoulder injury, to the carrier. Lieutenant\r\nDaniels, who had alerted the rescue force, circled his descending\r\nflight leader until he hit the water. After ascertaining that the\r\nwaterborne flier’s condition was satisfactory, the lieutenant turned\r\nhis plane towards the _Sicily_. In a short while he was safely home.\r\n\r\nIn late September, Major Alexander J. Gillis, VMF-311, assigned earlier\r\nthat summer to the Air Force’s 335th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron,\r\n4th Fighter Group, as an exchange pilot.[243] distinguished himself\r\nby becoming not only the first naval aviator to destroy three enemy\r\naircraft in Korea but also the second one to get a multiple killing\r\nin a single day.[244] Flying in a four-plane Sabrejet formation near\r\nthe vicinity of the mouth of the Yalu on 28 September, Major Gillis\r\nled another plane after two MIG-15s. By superior pilot technique and\r\naggressive tactics, he forced one of the enemy to crash during a low\r\naltitude chase. Later on during the sortie, the Marine initiated an\r\nattack on a solo MIG, closing on it and scoring hits that caused the\r\nplane to become uncontrollable and the pilot to eject. Major Gillis\r\nalso had to eject from his F-86 after it became disabled by the MIG.\r\nThe incident had occurred on the Marine aviator’s 50th combat mission\r\nwith the Air Force. He spent nearly four hours in the Yellow Sea before\r\na rescue helicopter picked him up.\r\n\r\n    [243] The exchange program “appears to have originated with the\r\n          participation--at Tactical Air Command’s invitation--of\r\n          two Marine Corps and two Navy pilots ... in the fall\r\n          of 1947.” Within two years, the program designed to\r\n          “indoctrinate selected Air Force and Navy pilots in the\r\n          air operational and air training activities of each\r\n          other’s service, had received Department of Defense\r\n          approval.” On 1 October 1949 the program went into\r\n          effect. Initially the exchange period was one year,\r\n          but after the Korean fighting broke out, the period\r\n          was reduced to approximately three months. Marine\r\n          participation began late in 1951. Atch 1 to Hq, USAF\r\n          (AFCHO) memo to Maj J. M. Yingling, HQMC, dtd 16 Jan 67\r\n          in v. V, Korean comment file.\r\n\r\n    [244] On 15 September, Major Gillis had shot down a solo MIG-15.\r\n\r\nAnother feat, this one a study in determination and perseverance,\r\nhad occurred early in the summer. On 22 July, the VMJ-1 commander,\r\nLieutenant Colonel Vernon O. Ullman, had taken to the air for a photo\r\nmission over North Korea in the vicinity of Sinanju, located near\r\nthe Yellow Sea 40 miles above Pyongyang. During the first of seven\r\nscheduled flights, he encountered heavy flak but nevertheless completed\r\nhis first mapping run in the area. Further, the Marine flier decided\r\nthat the antiaircraft menace was not going to force him to abandon the\r\nremaining part of his task. He continued. On the second of his seven\r\nruns, some 40 enemy jets (MIG-15s) appeared on the scene. These were\r\ndissuaded from close-in interference, however, by the photo escort of\r\n24 USAF single-engine Sabrejet fighters. Thereafter, the Russian-made\r\naircraft disappeared; Lieutenant Colonel Ullman continued, despite\r\nthe intense, accurate enemy antiaircraft fire, until he concluded his\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nThe type of determination displayed by Lieutenant Colonel Ullman\r\nhelped Marine tactical squadrons achieve some kind of distinction\r\nnearly every month from late spring to the fall of 1952. In May,\r\nVMF-323 (“the Death Rattlers”), then commanded by Major William A.\r\nWeir, established a squadron one-month record for number of combat\r\nsorties, 1,160, and total combat hours, 2,362.7. A high percentage of\r\naircraft availability, 95.6, helped make this mark possible. On 1 June,\r\nVMA-312 received the congratulations of CTF 95 for its “outstanding\r\nperformance under difficult conditions” during the spring months.\r\nDuring this period the squadron, based on board the USS _Bataan_,\r\nhad been particularly hampered by excessive turnover of key squadron\r\nofficers and flight leaders. This continual squadron rotation resulted\r\nin considerable variation in pilot indoctrination and need for field\r\ncarrier landing qualification, due to the “close tolerances in pilot\r\nskill required by carrier operations.”[245] Despite these difficulties,\r\nVMA-312 had scored an impressive 80-sortie mission, flown by 24\r\naircraft, on 18 April.\r\n\r\n    [245] _PacFlt EvalRpt_, No. 4, Chap. 10, p. 10-77.\r\n\r\nAdditional recognition of professional excellence was conferred upon\r\nMarine squadrons in July. On the 17th, the senior advisor to the\r\nROK I Corps expressed the gratitude of the corps commander for the\r\nmagnificent support the 1st MAW pilots had provided during the second\r\nweek of the month. All four attack squadrons in MAG-12 and both fighter\r\nunits in MAG-33 had taken part in these CAS missions. A week later,\r\neight planes from Lieutenant Colonel Henry S. Miller’s VMA-323, (which,\r\nalong with Lieutenant Colonel Graham H. Benson’s VMA-212, had been\r\nredesignated from fighter to attack squadrons the previous month),\r\ncompleted an unusually successful interdiction mission at Hago.\r\n\r\nLocated 25 miles northwest of Kaesong, the village reportedly was\r\nthe site of heavy troop concentrations, active mortar positions, and\r\nantitank weapons. Leaving K-6 at 1725, the eight Marine VMA-323 pilots\r\nwere soon over the target. Comprising the Death Rattler’s flight were\r\nMajors John M. Dufford, Raymond C. Holben, William H. Irvin, Jr., and\r\nCurtis E. Knudson; Captain John Church, Jr.; First Lieutenant William\r\nA. Poe, Jr.; and Second Lieutenants Stuart L. Spurlock and James S.\r\nThompson. At 1810 their attacks were launched, using 1,000-pound bombs,\r\nnapalm, rockets, and 20mm ammunition. The strike was over almost as\r\nsoon as it had started, and when the Marines departed, not one building\r\nremained in useful condition. But it was not until several days later\r\nthat the final results of the strike were known. Intelligence sources\r\nreported that the raid had caught the enemy troops at the evening meal;\r\nmore than 500 had been killed by the Corsairs, aptly called “Whistling\r\nDeath” by the Japanese in World War II.\r\n\r\nFor the remainder of the summer and into the fall Marine groups and\r\nsquadrons continued their record-breaking and efficient support of\r\nground troops and naval forces. With four squadrons (two day, one\r\nnight-fighter, and one photo), MAG-33 sent 141 sorties against the\r\nenemy on 6 August. This one-day group record occurred just before\r\nthe departure of Colonel Condon, who turned over the reins of the\r\norganization to Colonel Herbert H. Williamson on the 11th, and then\r\ntook command of MAG-12.\r\n\r\nShortly before Colonel Condon relinquished command, he was particularly\r\npleased by the success of a four-plane strike by VMF-311 (Major William\r\nJ. Sims) in support of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division commanded by\r\nBrigadier General Samuel T. Williams. Major Johnnie C. Vance, Jr.,\r\nstrike leader, was accompanied in this flight by Captain George R.\r\nBrier and Second Lieutenants Charles E. Pangburn and Whitlock N.\r\nSharpe. Up until this time the infantry had been particularly harassed\r\nby several enemy frontline fortifications and supporting artillery. The\r\nfour pilots destroyed three bunkers and two heavy guns and also caved\r\nin approximately 50 feet of trenchline on the 7 August strike. Upon\r\nlearning of the success of the Marine pilots and the conditions under\r\nwhich the attacks were carried out--dangerous terrain and constant\r\nground fire directed towards the planes--the general dispatched a\r\nletter, commending the “skill, courage, and determination displayed by\r\nthese pilots....”[246]\r\n\r\n    [246] MAG-33 ComdD, Aug 52, p. 16.\r\n\r\nAnother congratulatory message was received in September, this one\r\nfrom General Pollock for the excellent support given by MAG-12 on the\r\n20th. With three attack squadrons participating, Colonel Condon’s group\r\nhad neutralized Chinese weapons and troops at OP 36 to help prevent\r\na takeover of the Korean position. The pilots reported well over\r\n100 Chinese casualties. Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth R. Chamberlain’s\r\nVMA-323 contributed most of the 23 Marine sorties. The other attacking\r\nsquadrons were VMA-121 (Lieutenant Colonel Wayne M. Cargill, who 10\r\ndays earlier had relieved Lieutenant Colonel Crawford), and VMA-212,\r\ncommanded by Lieutenant Colonel Maurice W. Fletcher.\r\n\r\nSeptember was a month of mixed fortunes in the air war over Korea.\r\nThe successful CAS strikes of the 20th followed only a few days after\r\nanother high point set on 14 September, when Lieutenant Colonel\r\nCargill’s attack squadron flew its 5,000th combat sortie since\r\narrival in the Korean theater in October 1951. Then on 15 September,\r\nGeneral Jerome commissioned a new kind of unit in the wing, Marine\r\nComposite Squadron 1 (VMC-1), whose mission was to provide electronic\r\ncounter-measures (ECM) for UN aircraft. Lieutenant Colonel Lawrence F.\r\nFox headed the squadron, the only one in the naval service with an ECM\r\nprimary mission in Korea.\r\n\r\nThree days after the commissioning, a strange incident transpired.\r\nNorth of the UN line and at an altitude of 9,500 feet, a F-84\r\nThunderjet fighter, with U.S. Air Force markings and insignia, attacked\r\na propeller-driven Air Force trainer. The slower plane immediately\r\nbegan defensive maneuvering, flying in tight circles. After making five\r\nturns, the trainer pilot saw the supposedly friendly jet fly off.\r\n\r\nIt was believed that such a paradoxical occurrence was due to\r\nthe substantial number of F-84 losses and the enemy’s ability to\r\npiece together and fly an aircraft of that model. A few similar\r\nepisodes--attacks by apparently friendly aircraft on UN planes--had\r\npreviously taken place. In each case, the impostor was a model of U.S.\r\naircraft that had suffered particularly heavy losses.\r\n\r\nAnother incident in September had dire consequences. On the 10th,\r\nMAG-33 dispatched 22 fighter aircraft from VMF-115 (Lieutenant Colonel\r\nRoyce W. Coln) to attack reported troop concentrations near Sariwon, 35\r\nmiles directly south of Pyongyang. The F9F Panther jets had completed\r\nthe strike and were returning to their K-3 base when they were diverted\r\nto land at K-2, Taegu, where the weather was better. Fog had suddenly\r\nswept over the field at K-3, reducing visibility to zero. Sixteen\r\nPanthers landed safely at K-2, 45 miles southwest of the Marine field\r\nat Pohang. The remaining six, piloted by Majors Raymond E. Demers and\r\nDonald F. Givens, First Lieutenant Alvin R. Bourgeois, and by Second\r\nLieutenants John W. Hill, Jr., Carl R. Lafleur, and Richard L. Roth,\r\nflying in formation in poor weather, crashed into the side of a\r\n3,000-foot mountain while descending.[247] They would have required\r\nonly an additional 600 feet of altitude to clear the summit.\r\n\r\n    [247] Although not definitely proven, there were “some\r\n          indications of false radio beacons being used by the\r\n          enemy in clandestine operations in the K-2 area.” _Jack\r\n          ltr._\r\n\r\nLosses of Marine pilots and aircraft had been of growing concern to the\r\nwing command. The initial success of the flak suppression fires had\r\neliminated the one successful Communist source of air defense, accurate\r\nantiaircraft firing. One result was that noncombat accidents for a\r\nwhile during the summer became the principal cause of pilot and plane\r\nattrition. To help reduce these operational accidents as well as the\r\ncombat losses, the two Marine air groups instituted squadron training\r\nprograms and also directed the adoption of several new corrective\r\nprocedures. In MAG-12, for example, a study of results from the FAF\r\npolicy that limited bombing runs to one for interdiction and two for\r\nCAS targets revealed a sharp reduction in hits from flak. Tactical\r\nsquadron commanders in MAG-12 drew up a syllabus during September to\r\ntest proposed defensive tactics for their propeller aircraft to employ\r\nagainst enemy jets. The carrier squadron, VMA-312, began that same\r\nmonth the additional practice of field carrier landing qualification at\r\nK-6 for new pilots before permitting them to operate from the carriers.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these efforts, pilot losses spiralled alarmingly in\r\nOctober. For the rest of 1952, the monthly totals remained near that\r\nmonth’s level. On the other hand, aircraft losses during October\r\ndropped sharply to 10 from the September total of 22. This lower figure\r\nwas not to be exceeded until May 1953. These remedial procedures were\r\nconsidered at least partially responsible for the substantial decrease\r\nin aircraft losses.\r\n\r\nIn another area, a mid-October landing at Kojo, on the east coast\r\nimmediately south of the 39th Parallel, did not work out as planned.\r\nThe amphibious operation was in reality a feint intended to draw troops\r\naway from frontline positions and expose them to naval air and gunfire\r\nas they rushed in reinforcements. The enemy failed to rise to the bait,\r\nand actually only a few Communist troops were sighted. VMA-312 provided\r\narmed reconnaissance, tactical air operation, and naval gunfire\r\nspotting during the feint. Although they made little enemy contact, the\r\nMarine “Checkerboard” pilots operating off the _Sicily_ gained much\r\nexperience in landings and take-offs under the adverse conditions of\r\nrough seas and high winds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rockets, Resupply, and Radios_[248]\r\n\r\n    [248] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, Chaps. 8, 9; 1st\r\n          MAW ComdD, Oct 52; HMR-161 ComdDs Aug-Sep 52.\r\n\r\nThrough October 1952, operational control of Korean based Marine\r\nfighter and attack squadrons was still vested in commanders other than\r\nGeneral Jerome. Tactical squadrons continued to be directed by the FAF\r\nor Navy in their missions; the observation and helicopter squadrons\r\nwere under operational control of the 1st Marine Division and utilized,\r\nas before, at its discretion.\r\n\r\nHMR-161, commanded since 8 August by Lieutenant Colonel John F. Carey,\r\ncontinued its primary mission of evaluating rotary wing aircraft\r\nand their methods of employment. One tactical innovation, movement\r\nof elements of the 4.5-inch Rocket Battery, was undertaken during\r\nAugust soon after the Bunker Hill battle. With ground-fired rockets,\r\nthe problem of a tell-tale cloud of dust and brilliant flash of the\r\nrockets after each salvo had always plagued the artillerymen. This\r\nseldom went unnoticed by the enemy, who often showered the marked area\r\nwith counterbattery fire. On 19 and 20 August, in Operation RIPPLE,\r\nHMR-161 and the rocket battery proved that these two units could\r\nsuccessfully shoot and scoot to a new location and fire effectively\r\nagain without drawing an enemy reprisal. This Marine Corps innovation\r\nin air mobility--the first displacement of field artillery under combat\r\nconditions--offered a major time-saving advantage. Whereas previously\r\nit took approximately a half-hour for rocket launchers to move from\r\ntheir bivouac area to firing position,[249] deployment by helicopter\r\ncould be made in a matter of minutes, a time factor that could be\r\ncritical in event of an enemy attempted breakthrough.\r\n\r\n    [249] _Henderson ltr III._\r\n\r\nThe operation demonstrated that helicopters not only could transport\r\nrocket crews with weapons and ammunition to firing areas far more\r\nrapidly than conventional wheeled vehicles, but that the rotary craft\r\ncould airlift these weapons into places inaccessible by road. The\r\nnature of the mountainous terrain proved advantageous in that hills\r\nand valleys provided defiladed areas for loading and firing the weapons\r\nas well as protected routes for helicopter movements. An observation\r\nmade by pilots for operations in other types of environment, not\r\noffering as much cover and concealment, was that the shiny blue paint\r\non their birds would make detection easy in most surroundings and that\r\ncamouflage paint would lessen the risk from enemy AA.\r\n\r\nTransport helicopters of HMR-161 continued to augment those of VMO-6 in\r\ncasualty evacuation and ferrying Marines and other frontline troops.\r\nThe observation squadron maintained its policy and outstanding record\r\nof emergency flights of the wounded under any weather conditions except\r\ndense fog (electronic navigational aids still were not available). In\r\nAugust, various mechanical failures developed among the newly received\r\nHO5S-1 Sikorsky helicopters. These three-place observation aircraft\r\nwere underpowered but superior in many flight characteristics to the\r\nHTL-4 helicopters then in the squadron. Mechanical difficulties with\r\nthe newer aircraft increased until it became necessary to ground them\r\nlate in October until replacement parts became available in the supply\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nEmployment of transport helicopters for logistical support continued\r\nto be a principal use of such rotary wing aircraft as the end of\r\n1952 approached. Tests earlier in the year had proved the theory\r\nthat this versatile aircraft could resupply a battalion manning the\r\nMLR. The next step was to determine if the logistical support for an\r\nentire combat regiment could be accomplished by helicopter. Operation\r\nHAYLIFT, conducted during 22–26 September, the last of five operations\r\nthat month for HMR-161, was to test and evaluate helicopter resupply\r\nof Colonel Moore’s 7th Marines. Plans called for delivering all\r\nClass I, III, and V items and such Class II and IV items as could be\r\naccommodated. Two loading and four unloading sites were prescribed.\r\nAll but extremely valuable cargo, such as mail, was to be carried\r\nexternally in slings or wire baskets.\r\n\r\nHAYLIFT did show that at least for a short period of time--five days--a\r\nhelicopter squadron, utilizing 40 percent of its aircraft, could\r\nsustain a MLR regiment. Following the general procedures employed\r\npreviously with the battalion, HMR-161 found that no great changes were\r\nnecessary for resupply of the regiment. Two recommendations emerged\r\nfrom an evaluation of HAYLIFT. One stressed the need for establishment\r\nof an operations center manned by representatives of each unit\r\nparticipating in the exercise. The second called for development of\r\na more flexible loading system, one that would permit rapid weight\r\nincreases or decreases of 50 pound increments, as the situation\r\ndemanded. Such a method would make possible a more efficient payload\r\nfor each lift.[250]\r\n\r\n    [250] For example, on 25 September, rain soaked the cardboard\r\n          cover of the rations, adding extra weight to each\r\n          preloaded lift of these Class I supplies. On the other\r\n          hand, a heavier load could have been used at times. As\r\n          the helicopter used up its fuel, a commensurate increase\r\n          in cargo could have been carried.\r\n\r\nTransport on a larger scale in the 1st MAW was accomplished by General\r\nJerome’s few transport aircraft reinforced by the eight R5Ds from the\r\nVMR-152 detachment. In June, the passenger-carrying operations reached\r\nthe peak for the entire Korean War; that month, 17,490 troops and\r\nmilitary-associated civilians utilized the reinforced wing transport\r\naircraft. June 1952 was also the second busiest month in freight\r\ntransportation (7,397,824 pounds, nearly double the figure for June\r\n1951).\r\n\r\nSquadrons that were unable to better their performance records in some\r\ncases could trace their trouble to the inability to get all of their\r\nplanes off the ground. Several models were subject to spare parts\r\nshortages.[251] New aircraft, the F3D-2s and the AU-1s received in\r\nJune by VMF(N)-513 and VMA-212, respectively, had preceded an adequate\r\nstocking of normal replacements for worn out or defective parts. The\r\nnight fighter squadron was handicapped also by introduction into the\r\nsupply system of inadequate radio tubes, which burned out rapidly. The\r\nmost critical shortage, however, was parts for starter units of jet\r\nengines. This deficiency was not corrected until summer. One problem\r\nnever quite eliminated was the confusion of supply orders intended for\r\nthe helicopters in HMR-161 and VMO-6. It was believed that the close\r\nresemblance of Sikorsky HRS and HO5S part numbers and nomenclatures had\r\ncaused the improperly-marked requisitions and mix-up.\r\n\r\n    [251] Spare parts shortages are “inherent in the introduction\r\n          of new equipment into the field and prior to the\r\n          development of usage data.” a major effort was made at\r\n          this time by 1st MAW to improve its critical spare parts\r\n          support by improved stock control procedures and complete\r\n          inventory. _Jack ltr._\r\n\r\nThe 1st Marine Division logistical situation during the summer and fall\r\nof 1952 was generally excellent. General Pollock’s units did not suffer\r\nfrom the shortage of spare parts experienced by the 1st MAW whose\r\naircraft sometimes had to be grounded because of a missing spare part.\r\nU.S. Army support in the replacement of worn-out Marine vehicles for\r\nnew Army ones proved satisfactory. No major problems arose in engineer\r\nsupport. Medical evacuation and treatment and the level of supplies in\r\nthe five companies of the 1st Medical Battalion remained excellent.\r\n\r\nThere were two significant changes in the logistical support provided\r\nthe Marine division early in the fall. One dealt with employment of\r\nthe division’s 1st and 7th Motor Transport Battalions, located in\r\nthe rear support areas. Beginning in September, the companies were\r\nplaced in direct support of the four infantry regiments, with liaison\r\nby Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth E. Martin, division motor transport\r\nofficer. It was believed this decentralization would have the following\r\nadvantages:\r\n\r\n  1. Decreased vehicle mileage and therefore less driver fatigue\r\n  and prolonged vehicle life.\r\n\r\n  2. Increased dispersal as a safeguard against loss of wheeled\r\n  vehicle support in event of an unexpected and successful enemy\r\n  attack.\r\n\r\nThe other change was a shift in the emphasis of support rendered by\r\nthe Korean Service Corps. During October, each of the three frontline\r\nregiments received 300 more laborers, raising the total to 800. Rear\r\narea units paid for the increase, since the KSCs were detached from\r\nsupport units and sent forward to the MLR.\r\n\r\nLogistical support from the 1st Signal Battalion left little to be\r\ndesired. Commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John E. Morris[252] when the\r\nMarines moved to western Korea, the signalmen helped establish and\r\nmaintain an extensive communications net, with 5,200 miles of wire\r\nwithin the division and several vital links to adjacent and higher\r\ncommands.[253] Wiremen worked around the clock to lay and maintain the\r\ntelephone lines, which suffered considerable damage from the artillery\r\nand mortar barrages. When possible, the signalmen raised the wires off\r\nthe ground. The battalion set in more than 1,400 telephone poles. After\r\nthe system had been installed and was working efficiently, the July\r\nfloods washed away part of the major communications. By improvising\r\nand by setting up emergency equipment, the battalion was able to\r\nmaintain the flow of communications traffic at a satisfactory level.\r\nReplacement items were provided by the U.S. Army on a reimbursable\r\nbasis in accordance with existing directives.\r\n\r\n    [252] On 4 April Lieutenant Colonel Alton L. Hicks assumed\r\n          command of the battalion; Lieutenant Colonel Jacob E.\r\n          Glick relieved him on 3 August.\r\n\r\n    [253] Communication with General Kendall’s I Corps consisted of\r\n          radio-teletype, telephone, radio relay, courier plane,\r\n          and motor messenger. _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, p. 8-68.\r\n          The 11th Marines also had an additional 1,100 miles of\r\n          communication wire. _Henderson ltr III._\r\n\r\nIn September it became apparent that the signal equipment used to\r\nmaintain division communications was no longer equal to the demands\r\nplaced upon it. The extensive ground area plus the number and size of\r\nreinforcing units had not only put a heavy burden on radio, telephone,\r\nand teletype equipment but also caused the depletion of reserve stocks.\r\nWith the spare equipment in use, there was no pool to draw upon when\r\nunits turned in defective equipment for repair. Neither were there\r\navailable replacements for materiel destroyed by enemy action. Items\r\nmost urgently needed were flown in from the States. Other critical\r\nparts came from Army sources in Japan and Korea. By the end of October,\r\nthe communication resupply had returned to a more normal condition.\r\n\r\nBefore the month ended a different type of critical situation was to\r\nconfront the division. It appeared that the enemy’s success in seizing\r\na half-dozen outposts earlier in October had only whetted his appetite\r\nfor more. Chinese eyes were turned towards positions that held still\r\nmore potential value than the stepping-stones just acquired. The\r\nextreme right battalion in the division front held by the 7th Marines\r\nwas the focal point of the new effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThe Hook\r\n\r\n_Before the Battle--Preparations for Attack and Defense--Attack on the\r\nHook--Reno Demonstration--Counterattack--Overview_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Before the Battle_[254]\r\n\r\n    [254] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: CG, 1stMarDiv, _Info for CG, FMFPac_;\r\n          1stMarDiv ComdD, Oct 52; 1stMarDiv PIRs 706–736, dtd 1–31\r\n          Oct 52; 7thMar ComdD, Oct 52; LtCol Robert D. Heinl, Jr.\r\n          memo to Dir, MarCorHist, HQMC, dtd 28 Oct 52, Subj: Notes\r\n          on 7th Marines’ Action (Defense of “The Hook”), 26–27 Oct\r\n          52, hereafter Heinl, _memo_.\r\n\r\nAfter the heavy fighting in early October, there was a change in the\r\n1st Marine Division dispositions. On the 12th, the 5th Marines relieved\r\nthe 1st in the center sector and the latter regiment went into reserve.\r\nFor the next two weeks the lull that prevailed across the regimental\r\nfront was in sharp contrast to the intense fighting there earlier\r\nin the month. On the division left, the Korean Marines, not engaged\r\nin any sizable Communist action, conducted frequent tank-infantry\r\nreconnaissance patrols and ambushes forward of their MLR. In the\r\ncenter of the division line the 5th Marines, too, found their Chinese\r\nopponent seemingly reluctant to pursue any combat offensives, though\r\nhis harassment of the Bunker Hill area represented the strongest action\r\nagainst the Marine division at this time. The 7th Marines, holding\r\ndown the right sector, similarly encountered the enemy for only brief\r\nperiods, these contacts during patrol actions lasting no more than 15\r\nto 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nUpon its relief from the MLR, the 1st Marines took over the division\r\nrear area. There the regiment continued the improvement of the\r\nsecondary defensive lines, conducted extensive training, and dispatched\r\nnumerous security patrols throughout the regimental area. These\r\nroutine reserve roles were in addition to the primary mission of\r\naugmenting units on the Marine MLR in order to counterattack and defeat\r\nany attempted penetration of JAMESTOWN in the division area. As part\r\nof its counterattack mission, the divisional reserve regiment was to\r\nbe prepared for employment anywhere in the I Corps sector to block an\r\nenemy advance.\r\n\r\nOn the division right, the 7th Marines remained on position in defense\r\nof JAMESTOWN. Following the bitter outpost contests on 6 October,\r\nColonel Moore continued to retain all three battalions on line: 2/7\r\non the left, 3/7 in the center, and 1/7 on the right. The regimental\r\ncommander had found it necessary to commit his three battalions on line\r\ndue to the vastly overextended six-mile front, the rugged terrain,\r\nand the very real possibility of a major Communist attack anywhere\r\nalong the MLR. With all battalions forward, Colonel Moore was left\r\nwith a very small reserve, one company from 3/7. This battalion had to\r\nuse as its reserve what had become known as “clutch platoons”--units\r\ncomposed of cooks, bakers, clerks, motor transport, and other\r\nMarine headquarters personnel. These local reserves, and even the\r\nreserve company from 3/7, could be employed only with the regimental\r\ncommander’s approval.\r\n\r\nLine JAMESTOWN, in the 7th Marines area, meandered from the vicinity\r\nof the burned-out village of Toryom, on the left, to the Hook salient\r\nin the right battalion sector and from there southeast to the Samichon\r\nRiver, the boundary with the 1st Commonwealth Division. From the left\r\nbattalion sector to the right, the terrain gradually grew more rugged\r\nuntil the hills finally spilled over into the Samichon Valley. To the\r\nrear of the MLR, the ground was less jagged; forward of the line, the\r\nhills were more precipitous in character. The steepest heights were\r\nin the right battalion sector. Highest terrain feature along Colonel\r\nMoore’s MLR was Hill 146, located not far from the Hook. Throughout\r\nthe 7th Marines sector rice paddies covered the narrow valley floors\r\nbetween the hills. Vegetation was sparse. A series of dirt roads and\r\ntrails served the regimental area.\r\n\r\nCombat outposts varied greatly as to their distance from JAMESTOWN.\r\nFarthest from the line were the three in the left battalion sector,\r\nmanned by Lieutenant Colonel Caputo’s 2/7. This trio, Carson, Reno, and\r\nVegas, were approximately 1,000 yards forward of the MLR. Berlin and\r\nEast Berlin (a new outpost established on 13 October) were the forward\r\npositions in the center line outposted by Lieutenant Colonel Charles D.\r\nBarrett’s[255] Marines. To the right Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki’s 1/7\r\nsector held three--COPs Ronson, Warsaw, and Verdun, the latter near the\r\nCommonwealth border.\r\n\r\n    [255] Responsibility for this part of the 7th Marines line\r\n          changed on 13 October, when Lieutenant Colonel Barrett\r\n          took command of 3/7 from Lieutenant Colonel Russell.\r\n          The latter then was assigned as division senior liaison\r\n          officer to the KMC regiment.\r\n\r\nRonson was the outpost nearest to the Hook, a major defensive position\r\nof the regiment. The importance of this part of the MLR, in the extreme\r\neastern sector, lay not in its strength but rather in its weakness.\r\nJutting as it did towards the Communist lines, the salient formed a\r\nJ-shaped bulge in the main line, which not only gave the Hook its\r\nnickname but also established the vulnerability of the position. Its\r\nsusceptibility to capture derived both from violation of a defensive\r\naxiom that the “MLR should not have sharp angles and salients”[256] and\r\nto the fact that the ridgeline on which the Hook was located continued\r\nnorthwest into Communist-held territory. Seattle, which the Chinese had\r\nseized on 2 October, lay only about 500 yards northwest of the Hook.\r\n\r\n    [256] Heinl, _memo_. The originator of this memo, Lieutenant\r\n          Colonel Robert D. Heinl, Jr., was an experienced Marine\r\n          officer and military historian who had just been assigned\r\n          to the division for duty. Temporarily attached to the 7th\r\n          Marines as an observer, his brief visit there happened to\r\n          coincide with the beginning of the Hook battle.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its vulnerability, the Hook could not be abandoned. There\r\nwas no other terrain feature held by the Marines that could command the\r\ncritical Samichon Valley, a major avenue of approach from the northeast\r\ndirectly to Seoul. The salient also dominated the entire nearby area\r\nof the Imjin River to the south. Possession of the Hook and adjoining\r\nridge would give the Communists observation of a substantial portion\r\nof the Marine rear areas beyond the Imjin, as well as the vital river\r\ncrossings. In the opinion of Major General M. M. Austin-Roberts-West,\r\nwhose 1st Commonwealth Division was soon to take over the Hook sector,\r\nhad the salient been lost, “a withdrawal of 4,000 yards would have been\r\nnecessary.”[257]\r\n\r\n    [257] Quoted in LtCol Herbert F. Wood, _Strange Battleground:\r\n          The Operations in Korea and Their Effects on the Defense\r\n          Policy of Canada_ (Ottawa: The Army Historical Section,\r\n          Canadian Forces Headquarters, 1966), p. 213.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of October, this vital area had been protected by COPs\r\nSeattle and Warsaw. When the former was overrun, it became necessary\r\nto establish a new position. This was directed by Lieutenant Colonel\r\nDulacki, and on 16 October Ronson was established 200 yards southeast\r\nof Seattle and 275 yards west of the Hook. About 600 yards northeast of\r\nthe salient the remaining position, COP Warsaw, commanded the lowlands\r\nto the east and the narrow, east-west oriented valley of a Samichon\r\ntributary immediately to the front.\r\n\r\nOpposite the three MLR battalions of the 7th Marines were the 356th\r\nand 357th Regiments of the 119th Division, 40th CCF Army. In addition\r\nto these infantry units, numbering close to 7,000, an estimated 10\r\nbattalions (120 guns) of Chinese artillery[258] were facing Colonel\r\nMoore’s regiment. Personnel strength of the American unit consisted\r\nof 3,844 Marines, 11 medical officers and 133 corpsmen, 3 U.S. Army\r\ncommunicators, and 764 Koreans (746 KSCs and 18 interpreters).\r\n\r\n    [258] The Marine division artillery regiment reported that\r\n          in late October nine battalions of Chinese artillery,\r\n          ranging from 75 or 76mm guns or howitzers to 122mm\r\n          howitzers, opposed the 7th Marines. It was estimated\r\n          that one other 122mm battalion was also emplaced north\r\n          of the right division sector. In addition to these CCF\r\n          units, elements of a 152mm self-propelled howitzer unit\r\n          were also believed to be in the area. Late in November\r\n          two batteries of 152mm howitzers were tentatively located\r\n          about 4,000 yards west northwest of the Hook. Disposition\r\n          had been determined “as a result of crater analysis,\r\n          shell reports, sound plots, and capabilities of the\r\n          weapon.” 11thMar ComdD, Nov 52, “Enemy Artillery Activity\r\n          Rpts,” Nos. 21, 23, dtd 1, 21 Nov. 52.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer and early fall, the 7th Marines had amassed\r\nconsiderable information about the enemy, including Chinese strength\r\nand composition of forces and many of their combat characteristics.\r\nEncroachment on Marine ground positions by steadily creeping the CCF\r\ntrenchline forward continued to be the enemy’s major ground-gaining\r\ntactic. In fact, the Chinese units facing the Marine division\r\nconcentrated their digging during the fall of 1952 in the sector north\r\nof the 7th Marines MLR. (See Map 15.) Other intelligence, however,\r\nseemed open to question. For example, there was the reported frontline\r\npresence of women among the 90 Chinese who had engaged a 2/1 patrol\r\non 5 October as well as the sighting in the KMC sector on the 17th of\r\nenemy “super soldiers” far taller than the ordinary Chinese. Many in\r\nthe division found it difficult to believe the statements of enemy\r\nprisoners. During interrogation they invariably maintained that the\r\nmission of Chinese Communist Forces in Korea was a “defensive” one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 15      K. WHITE\r\n\r\n“CCF CREEPING TACTICS”\r\n\r\nMARCH-OCTOBER 1952]\r\n\r\nThe static battle situation encouraged the use of psychological\r\nwarfare. In attempting to influence the minds of their opponents and\r\nweaken morale, the Chinese depended upon loudspeakers to carry their\r\npropaganda barrage across No-Man’s-Land. Enemy employment of this\r\ntechnique was especially heavy during October. To Marines, for example,\r\nChinese directed pleas of “Go home and have peace,” “Surrender, we\r\ntreat POWs well,” “Leave Korea,” “Marines, come and get your buddies’\r\nbodies,” and the like, often to the accompaniment of music. On\r\noccasion, Chinese patrols left propaganda pamphlets behind them in the\r\nKMC sector. Infrequently, the enemy displayed signs along patrol routes\r\nurging Marines to surrender. Most of the Chinese psychological efforts\r\nwere directed against the Korean Marines.\r\n\r\nIn enemy employment of artillery, Marine frontline units and division\r\nintelligence had become well aware of the vast improvements the\r\nCommunists had made in recent months. Aided by a plentiful supply\r\nof ammunition, enemy guns and howitzers, including the heavy 152mm\r\nweapon, frequently delivered concentrated fires on critical positions\r\nin the division area. Marines felt the effects of how well the Chinese\r\nhad learned to mass their fires against a single target for maximum\r\ndestructive power. From the Marines, moreover, the enemy had picked\r\nup the artillery box tactic, employing it for the first time in their\r\nsector opposite Colonel Moore’s regiment during the early October\r\noutpost battles.\r\n\r\nDuring those same clashes, the 11th Marines had observed how the\r\nChinese displaced some of their batteries well forward for more\r\neffective artillery support of their attacking infantry. One enemy\r\nartillery innovation had been noted the previous month by a Marine AO;\r\non 19 September a Chinese artillery piece was detected firing in the\r\nopen. Previous observations had indicated that the Chinese generally\r\nused wooded areas or extensive bunker-type positions to conceal their\r\nsupporting weapons.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of October, 62.5 percent of the Chinese artillery\r\nopposing General Pollock’s division was located in positions north\r\nof the 7th Marines. The importance the enemy put on the principle of\r\nmassed artillery fire and the improvement of their ammunition supply\r\ncan be seen in a remark attributed to a Chinese division commander:\r\n\r\n  The enemy had organized an attack of two-battalion strength on\r\n  our first-line platoon. As the enemy were getting into their\r\n  assembly area I directed several volleys of rapid fire against\r\n  them with a total expenditure of about 120 rounds. That very\r\n  evening the army commander rang me up and said disapprovingly,\r\n  ‘You’ve expended a bit too much ammunition today!’ It seemed as\r\n  though the army commander had detected precisely what was in my\r\n  mind. There was an instant change in his voice as he said: ‘Oh,\r\n  comrade, it really could not be accounted as waste, but you must\r\n  know we are short of supplies.’\r\n\r\n  Scarcely two years had passed but the situation was completely\r\n  altered. In the present we had emplaced 120 guns to each\r\n  kilometre of front line so that in a rapid-fire bombardment of\r\n  25 minutes more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition could be hurled\r\n  against the enemy positions. If the fire used in supporting\r\n  attacks and in repulsing enemy counterattacks were taken into\r\n  account the total would reach 70,000 rounds.[259]\r\n\r\n    [259] _CPV, Recollections_, p. 360.\r\n\r\nExaggerated as the numbers of guns and rounds may be, the basic massing\r\ntechnique was in line with U.S. intelligence estimates at the time. The\r\nremark also pointed to the importance the Chinese had learned to place\r\non employment of artillery, a shift in emphasis that Colonel Moore’s\r\nregiment was soon to experience in unprecedented volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparations for Attack and Defense_[260]\r\n\r\n    [260] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdD, Oct 52; 1stMarDiv G-3\r\n          Jnls, 24–26 Oct 52; 1stMarDiv PIRs 729–732, dtd 24–27 Oct\r\n          52; 7th Mar, 1/7, VMA-323 ComdDs, Oct 52; Heinl, _memo_.\r\n\r\nBefore the Hook battle erupted, the defensive fires that the 7th\r\nMarines could draw upon were not overpowering in terms of numbers of\r\nunits available. Only one battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Bert Davis’\r\n2/11, was in direct support of Colonel Moore’s regiment. In this\r\nmission, the 2/11 fires were reinforced by those of 1/11 (Lieutenant\r\nColonel David S. Randall). In addition to these organic units, the\r\nbatteries of the 623d Field Artillery Battalion (155mm howitzers)\r\nand one platoon of C Battery, 17th Field Artillery Battalion (8-inch\r\nself-propelled howitzers) were readily available to the 7th Marines.\r\nIn all, 38 light, medium, and heavy pieces constituted the artillery\r\nsupport of the right sector.[261] General support was available from\r\nLieutenant Colonel Raymond D. Wright’s 4/11 and from the 4.2-inch\r\nRocket Battery (Captain Donald G. Frier). The 159th Field Artillery\r\nBattalion (155mm howitzers) and B Battery, 204th Field Artillery\r\nBattalion (155mm guns), like the other Army units positioned in the\r\nMarine Division sector, reinforced the fires of division artillery.\r\nFire support from 1st Commonwealth Division weapons within range of the\r\nHook area could also be depended upon.\r\n\r\n    [261] 11thMar ComdD, Oct 52, App III, Sheet 3. Eighteen of the\r\n          weapons (the 623d Field Artillery Battalion) had just\r\n          moved into the Marine sector and begun operating on 14\r\n          October. The unit remained under I Corps operational\r\n          control, with the mission of providing general support\r\n          reinforcing fire.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Army artillery units satisfied the heavy punch requirement\r\nof the 11th Marines, commanded since 21 September by Colonel Harry N.\r\nShea, there was one basic element the regiment lacked. This missing\r\ningredient was a sufficient amount of ammunition for the howitzers.\r\nDefense of outposts and mainline positions along the EUSAK front in\r\nearly and mid-October 1952 consumed a great deal of this type of\r\nammunition. This heavy expenditure was brought to the attention of the\r\ncorps commanders by Eighth Army. General Van Fleet pointed out that\r\nammunition consumption rates for both the 105mm and 155mm howitzers\r\nduring these two critical weeks in October not only exceeded the\r\nexpenditures of the massive Communist spring offensive in 1951 but also\r\nthe UN counterstroke that followed.[262]\r\n\r\n    [262] Later in 1951, during the UN Summer-Fall offensive,\r\n          ammunition consumption had again risen sharply, creating\r\n          concern among corps commanders and occasioning one of\r\n          them to remark to a subordinate, “We have the distinct\r\n          impression that two of your battalions are trying to\r\n          compete for a world’s record.” Capt Edward C. Williamson,\r\n          _et al._, “Bloody Ridge,” ms OCMH, 1951, cited in\r\n          James A. Huston, _The Sinews of War: Army Logistics,\r\n          1775–1953--The Army Historical Series_ (Washington: OCMH,\r\n          1966), v. II, p. 632.\r\n\r\nTo help remedy the situation, the EUSAK commander urged “continuous\r\ncommand supervision to insure the maximum return for all ammunition\r\nexpended.”[263] The general made it plain that he was not changing his\r\npolicy of exacting a heavy toll whenever the enemy began an attack.\r\nThis course had been followed by the 1st Marine Division, but the\r\nMarines’ ability to both restrict the enemy’s creeping tactics and\r\nsimultaneously fight a siege-type war was noticeably impeded.[264]\r\n\r\n    [263] 1stMarDiv ComdD, Oct 52, App I, No. 19.\r\n\r\n    [264] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, Chap. 8, p. 8-71.\r\n\r\nAs the end of October approached, the shortage of ammunition was\r\nbecoming a subject of increased concern to the frontline Marine units.\r\nDaily allowances established for the last 11 days of the month were\r\n20 rounds of 105mm high explosive (HE) and 4.3 rounds of 155mm high\r\nexplosive for each tube.[265] With such small quantities to fire\r\nand further restricted by an equally critical shortage of both hand\r\ngrenades and 81mm mortar rounds, Colonel Moore was almost powerless to\r\nspike the Chinese preparations for assault of the Hook.[266] Artillery\r\nfires were reserved for only the most urgent situations or for large\r\nbodies of troops. It was one observer’s opinion that the “enemy could\r\nshow himself almost at will without receiving fire, and that it was\r\nimpossible either to harass or neutralize his continual fortification\r\nactivity, let alone embark upon systematic destructive fires of the\r\nkind he was carrying out.”[267]\r\n\r\n    [265] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n    [266] For example, during the latter part of the month each\r\n          rifle company in the Hook battalion was limited to 150\r\n          hand grenades. The total 11-day allowance for Lieutenant\r\n          Colonel Dulacki’s 81mm mortars was 475 rounds. 1/7 ComdD,\r\n          Oct 52, App. III.\r\n\r\n    [267] Heinl, _memo_.\r\n\r\nAs a means of compensating for the shortage of 81mm mortar and 105mm\r\nhowitzer ammunition, the Marines reverted to a former method of using\r\nmachine guns. This technique, employed during the trench warfare days\r\nof World War I but seldom thereafter, was considered a useful expedient\r\nto discourage enemy defensive creeping tactics as well as to deter his\r\npreparations for objective attacks. The system required emplacing heavy\r\nmachine guns both on and to the rear of the MLR to fire into areas that\r\ntroops used for assembly or as check points. If the target was visible\r\nto the machine gunner, he could take it under direct fire. At night,\r\nwhen the enemy operated under cover of darkness, the machine guns fired\r\ninto zones which had already been registered in the daytime. Colonel\r\nMoore directed his units on 23 October to resort to this expedient.\r\n\r\nA 1st Marine Division daily intelligence report covering the 24-hour\r\nperiod beginning at 1800 on 24 October noted that there was “a\r\nmarked increase in enemy artillery and mortar fire with an estimated\r\ntwelve hundred rounds falling in the CT 1010 area of the 7th Marines\r\nsector.”[268] According to the division PIR there was also an increased\r\nnumber of enemy troops observed that same day in locations west and\r\nnorthwest of the Hook. Most of the fire was directed against the Hook\r\narea of the MLR and on the two sentinels, Ronson and Warsaw. Efforts by\r\nMarines and some 250 KSCs to repair the damaged or destroyed bunkers,\r\ntrenches, communications lines, and tactical wire, during brief\r\nperiods of relief from the artillery deluges, were wiped out again by\r\nsubsequent shellings.\r\n\r\n    [268] 1stMarDiv PIR 729, dtd 24 Oct 52, p. 2. Ronson, the Hook,\r\n          and Warsaw are within the 1,000-meter square, CT 1010.\r\n\r\nIt would not be correct to say that 1/7 remained entirely passive at\r\nthis time. Battalion weapons replied, though in faint voices barely\r\naudible in the din created by Chinese firing. Regimental mortars chimed\r\nin and so did 2/11, which fired 416 rounds in the 24 hours ending at\r\n1800 on the 24th. For that same period, tanks expended 137 rounds at\r\nactive weapon positions firing on the Hook. One air strike was directed\r\nagainst the enemy opposing the Hook battalion. This attack by a quartet\r\nof Marine F9Fs from VMF-311 (Lieutenant Colonel Arthur H. Adams) bombed\r\nand napalmed a troublesome group of Chinese entrenched on the enemy MLR\r\n750 yards east of the Hook.\r\n\r\nDuring the next 48 hours, the enemy continued his preparations for an\r\nattack, concentrating his artillery fire on the Hook area. Colonel\r\nMoore’s battalions received approximately 2,850 artillery and mortar\r\nrounds, most of which rained down on 1/7 to the right. There, the heavy\r\nand continuous fire slowed Marine efforts to restore their wrecked\r\nbunkers and trenches. Late on the 25th there was some relief from the\r\nartillery bombardment, but by that time many of the prophets on the\r\nline and in the rear area were uncertain only as to the precise time of\r\nthe unexpected Chinese attack.\r\n\r\nColonel Clarence A. Barninger, the division intelligence officer,\r\nhad himself alerted General Pollock to the implications of “the\r\nintensification and character of enemy fires”[269] being received in\r\nthe 1/7 sector. The intelligence evaluation was not based only on\r\nrecent events. A detailed study of Chinese capabilities and possible\r\ncourses of action had just been completed by the G-2 and his staff. In\r\nits discussion of the early October outpost attacks in the division\r\nright, the report concluded that Chinese interests lay in gaining the\r\n“terrain dominating the Samichon Valley....”[270]\r\n\r\n    [269] Heinl, _memo_.\r\n\r\n    [270] 1stMarDiv Intell. Est., dtd 19 Oct 52, p. 8, filed with\r\n          the divisions PIRs for that month.\r\n\r\nSince 5 October when 1/7 had been moved into the line as the regiment’s\r\nthird MLR battalion, the enemy had begun a regular shelling of 1/7\r\npositions adjacent to the Hook. Incoming rounds had increased almost\r\ndaily. “Troops, vehicles, and tanks moving in daylight even behind the\r\nMLR almost invariably brought down enemy artillery or mortars upon\r\nthem. It was apparent that the enemy was making preparation for a\r\nlarge scale assault in this portion of the MLR,”[271] the battalion\r\ncommander, Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki, later recalled. Matters took\r\nan even more ominous turn about 23 October when the Chinese “began a\r\ndeliberate, deadly accurate precision fire aimed at destruction of the\r\nmajor fortifications in the Hook’s system of dug-in defense.”[272]\r\nAs the tempo of this fire stepped up daily, the destruction of the\r\nbattalion’s carefully prepared defenses exceeded the Marines’ ability\r\nto repair the damage. The artillery build-up was believed preparatory\r\nto an attempt to either seize or breach the MLR.\r\n\r\n    [271] _Dulacki ltr._\r\n\r\n    [272] Heinl, _memo_.\r\n\r\nIn late October, Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki had two companies on the\r\nMLR to protect this important area. On the 23d, Captain Frederick C.\r\nMcLaughlin’s Company A was assigned the left part of the battalion\r\nsector, which included the Hook. A squad outposted Ronson and a\r\nreinforced platoon was stationed at Warsaw. At 0200 on the 26th,\r\nCompany C (Captain Paul B. Byrum) departed the battalion reserve area\r\nto take over responsibility as the left MLR company. Relief of Company\r\nA was completed at 0410.[273] Holding down the right flank of the main\r\nline during this time was Company B (Captain Dexter E. Evans). This\r\narea was larger but somewhat less rugged than the western part of the\r\n1/7 sector.\r\n\r\n    [273] Due to the width of the Hook sector, it was necessary to\r\n          keep all three rifle platoons in the line. A reinforced\r\n          platoon from the battalion reserve outposted Warsaw.\r\n          While Company A was on line, a Company C platoon manned\r\n          the outpost; when Company C was relieved on 26 October,\r\n          a Company A platoon was sent to Warsaw. Maj Frederick\r\n          C. McLaughlin ltr to Dir, MCHist, HQMC, dtd 27 Jan 70,\r\n          hereafter _McLaughlin ltr_.\r\n\r\nIn the two days immediately preceding the Chinese attack of 26\r\nOctober, 1/7 received a limited amount of support intended to harass\r\nthe enemy and throw him off balance, if possible. Tanks fired their\r\n90s at bunkers, caves, trenches, and direct fire weapons in the enemy\r\nsector. On the 25th, Company A of the 1st Tank Battalion blasted away\r\n54 times at these targets; on the next day, Captain Clyde W. Hunter’s\r\ngunners more than tripled their previous day’s output, firing 173 high\r\nexplosive shells. Artillery, in the meantime, stepped up its rate\r\nof fire on the 25th, when Lieutenant Colonel Davis’ 2/11 fired 575\r\nrounds, followed by 506 more the next day. The division general support\r\nbattalion, 4/11, fired a total of 195 rounds on these two days.[274]\r\nNearly half were to assist the 7th Marines. On both days the regiment\r\nreceived the benefit of 4.5-inch rocket ripples.\r\n\r\n    [274] On 24 October, Battery M of the battalion was temporarily\r\n          relaid to provide additional support to Colonel Moore’s\r\n          regiment.\r\n\r\nAir support just prior to the attack was increased slightly, but only\r\ntwo strikes were flown for the Hook battalion. At 1535 on the 25th,\r\ntwo Corsair fighters and a pair of AUs, the attack version of the\r\nCorsair, dive-bombed a section of Chinese trench that housed a number\r\nof weapons bothersome to the Marines nearby.[275] The four VMA-323\r\naircraft claimed destruction of 40 yards of trench and damage to 35\r\nyards more. The target was 1,000 yards southwest of the Hook. Next\r\nmorning the squadron sent three of its famed fighters against bunker\r\npositions on a hill 900 yards west of the 1/7 salient. This mission had\r\nbeen prebriefed to attack enemy artillery positions opposite the KMC\r\nline. Instead, the flight was diverted to take on the bunkers, which\r\nrepresented, at that time, more of a menace to the division. The attack\r\ndestroyed one bunker, damaged another, and produced an estimated seven\r\ncasualties.\r\n\r\n    [275] The flight had been scheduled to attack active artillery\r\n          positions 3½ miles north of the Carson-Reno-Vegas area.\r\n          When some of their ordnance was unexpended after putting\r\n          these guns out of action, the planes, were ordered to\r\n          take on the trench target.\r\n\r\nHidden nearby the area of this air strike in the early morning hours\r\nof 26 October was the Chinese infantry unit which later that same\r\nday would attack the Hook. Before daybreak the 3d Battalion, 357th\r\nRegiment, had moved from an area nearly two miles west of the Hook. The\r\nforward elements, two companies, with two day’s rations for each man,\r\nhalted about a mile from their objective. There the Chinese remained\r\nthroughout most of the 26th, carefully concealing themselves from\r\nobservation by friendly forces.[276] While the enemy troops were lying\r\nlow, their mortars and artillery began the final preparatory fires.\r\n\r\n    [276] Within the division there were no reports of sightings\r\n          of unusually large groups of enemy soldiers in this\r\n          area. In fact, there were fewer enemy seen on the 26th\r\n          than any other day since 18 October. During the 23d and\r\n          24th, about 100 enemy had been observed almost a half\r\n          mile closer to the Hook than the hideout area used on the\r\n          26th. 11thMar ComdD, Oct. 52, p. 12; 1stMarDiv PIR 729,\r\n          dtd 24 Oct 52, p. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Attack on the Hook_[277]\r\n\r\n    [277] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdD, Oct 52; 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl,\r\n          26 Oct 52; 1stMarDiv PIRs 723, 734, dtd 27, 29 Oct 52;\r\n          7thMar, 11th Mar, 1/7, 4/11, 1st TkBn, VMF(N)-513 ComdDs,\r\n          Oct 52; Heinl, _memo_.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 26 October, Chinese artillery and mortar fire\r\nstriking the MLR slackened a bit but was still sufficiently heavy in\r\nthe vicinity of the Hook to prevent visitors in the area any direct\r\nobservation from the salient. During his inspection of Hook defenses\r\nthat morning, Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki was knocked to the ground by\r\nthe concussion of an enemy artillery round exploding nearby.[278] In\r\nthe afternoon, enemy shelling continued at a steady pace, but towards\r\nthe end of the day intense mixed artillery and mortar fire increased\r\nto preattack proportions. Dusk brought no relief from the enemy’s\r\nsupporting weapons.\r\n\r\n    [278] The 1/7 commander, who was uninjured by the blast,\r\n          might have become a believer that day in the military\r\n          cliche, “Rank hath its privileges,” for Brigadier A.\r\n          H. G. Ricketts (29th British Infantry Brigade, 1st\r\n          Commonwealth Division), who was standing near Lieutenant\r\n          Colonel Dulacki, was untouched. The British division was\r\n          scheduled to take over responsibility for the Hook sector\r\n          in early November.\r\n\r\nOut at the flanking positions, Ronson and Warsaw, there was little\r\nchange in the intensity of the enemy shelling for the remainder of the\r\nafternoon. Bunkers and trenches were caved in, just as they were on the\r\nHook[279] from the preparatory fires that had been building up over a\r\nperiod of days. (For a sketch of the Hook battle area on 26 October,\r\nsee Map 16.) Enemy shelling had also produced a number of casualties.\r\nMarines at Ronson were the first to experience the enemy’s ground\r\nassault. At 1810 the outpost reported an increased rate of mortar\r\nand artillery rounds exploding on the position. Two groups of enemy\r\nsoldiers were seen moving towards the outpost, one from the east and\r\nthe other from the west. Ronson Marines took these advancing soldiers\r\nunder fire immediately.\r\n\r\n    [279] Prior to the enemy’s steady shelling of the Hook, the\r\n          trenches were six feet deep. The preparatory fires of the\r\n          past several days had been so intense that in nearly all\r\n          areas the trenchline had been leveled by the time of the\r\n          Chinese attack. “I am convinced that the Chinese didn’t\r\n          realize that they had penetrated our MLR or they would\r\n          have exploited the penetration.” Col Russell E. Honsowetz\r\n          ltr to Dir, MCHist, HQMC, dtd 26 Jan 70.\r\n\r\nInitially, the radio messages from Ronson reported that the attacking\r\nforce was a company, but a later estimate of approximately 50 Chinese\r\nappeared to be more nearly correct. Communist infantry made their way\r\nthrough the defensive artillery barrages requested by the COP garrison\r\nand into the rifle and machine gun fire of the Marines. By 1838 the\r\nenemy had overrun the squad of Marines and was in possession of Ronson.\r\nNo one had escaped from the outpost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 16      K. White\r\n\r\nHOOK SECTOR OF MLR\r\n\r\n1800, 26 October 1952]\r\n\r\nAt this time, 800 yards northeast, the 9th Company, 357th Battalion\r\nwas working its way towards Warsaw. Striking at the COP from both east\r\nand west, the enemy company was momentarily halted by extremely heavy\r\nMarine mortar and artillery fire. By 1820, the platoon at Warsaw had\r\nrequested the protective box around its position; this fire the 11th\r\nMarines delivered promptly. Still the Chinese continued to besiege\r\nthe position and Company A defending Marines, under outpost commander\r\nSecond Lieutenant John Babson, Jr., were locked in a hand-to-hand\r\nstruggle. As a platoon was being readied to reinforce Warsaw the\r\noutpost reported, at 1907, that enemy soldiers had reached the Marine\r\nbunkers and that the defenders were using bayonets, pistols, hand\r\ngrenades, and both ends of their rifles to repel the Communist invaders.\r\n\r\nThree minutes later came the word, “We’re being overrun.” With this\r\nmessage all communication from the outpost temporarily ceased, but\r\nat 1944, Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki’s CP heard Warsaw report heavy\r\nfighting still in progress there. The outpost first stated that enemy\r\nsoldiers were on top of the bunkers; then called for “VT on own\r\nposition” which the 11th Marines furnished.\r\n\r\nThe seriousness of the situation was immediately apparent at higher\r\ncommands. One outpost had been lost; a second was in jeopardy. At about\r\nthis time, a veritable avalanche of enemy artillery and mortar fire\r\nbegan to blanket the Hook. Colonel Moore released Captain McLaughlin’s\r\ncompany to 1/7. The 7th Marines commander also ordered regimental\r\nammunition supplies be allotted to Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki’s area.\r\nShortly after that, division lifted ammunition restrictions on 1/7.\r\n\r\nTo counter the impending ground attack, at 1859 Lieutenant Colonel\r\nDulacki ordered Captain McLaughlin’s Company A forward to reinforce the\r\nHook sector and to assist Company C in containing the enemy attack. One\r\nplatoon, the 1st, departed immediately for the MLR. As the remainder\r\nof the company prepared to move out, the enemy struck in estimated\r\nbattalion strength. By 1938 some of the CCF infantry had advanced to\r\nthe main trenches immediately south of the Hook. Within a few minutes,\r\na second wave of Communist soldiers, following closely the preparatory\r\nbarrages, hit JAMESTOWN just east of the 1/7 salient and frontally at\r\nthe Hook itself. It appeared that the Communists had come to stay, for\r\nmany cargo carriers--Chinese with construction materials for bunkers\r\nand trenches--accompanied the attacking infantry.\r\n\r\nFire fights raged during the early phase of the struggle, with\r\ncontinuous support furnished the assault troops by Chinese artillery\r\nand mortars. The momentum of the enemy’s three-pronged attack, aided\r\nby heavy rear area fire support, enabled the Chinese to overrun the\r\ntrenches and push on along the crest of the ridge, its slope near the\r\nspine, and across the segments formed by the spurs that jutted south\r\nfrom the crest. Marine defenders pulled back while a small rear guard\r\ncovered their movement with fire. Along the MLR, about 400 yards south\r\nof the Hook, the Chinese had slipped around the flanks of the COP and\r\nat 2030 forced a penetration in the C/1/7 line. Second Lieutenant\r\nJohn W. Meikle (1st Platoon, Company C) organized the Marines into a\r\nperimeter defense adjacent to the MLR. At 2130, remaining elements of\r\nthe company formed another defense blocking area 550 yards east of the\r\nHook near the crest of the ridge.\r\n\r\nBetween these two positions small groups of Marines continued the heavy\r\nclose fight to repulse the enemy while inching their way forward to\r\ntie-in with the rest of the unit. (See Map 17 for penetration limits\r\nduring the Hook battle.) To the northeast, the platoon at Warsaw had\r\nnot been heard from since 1945, and at 2330, Colonel Moore reluctantly\r\ndeclared the outpost to be in enemy hands.\r\n\r\nAt the time the loss of Warsaw was announced, counter-measures designed\r\nto halt the enemy assault were in various stages of preparation or\r\ncompletion. The initial reinforcing element sent forward to strengthen\r\nthe main line had linked up with Lieutenant Meikle’s 1st Platoon,\r\nCompany C, in the perimeter near the 3d Battalion boundary. The\r\nremainder of Company A was en route to the crest of the east-west ridge\r\nto thwart what appeared to be the main enemy drive. Colonel Moore had\r\nreleased his meager reserve, H/3/7, at 0300 on the 27th, and General\r\nPollock had ordered one of the division reserve battalions, 3/1, to the\r\n7th Marines area, although still retaining operational control of the\r\nunit.\r\n\r\nAs the forward battalion of the division reserve, 3/1 (Lieutenant\r\nColonel Altman) had prepared counterattack plans for critical\r\nlocations in the division sector and had previously made a\r\nreconnaissance of the Hook area. The battalion immediately displaced\r\nfrom its bivouac site north of the Imjin (Camp Rose) to an assembly\r\narea behind the 7th Marines on the MLR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 17      K. White\r\n\r\nHOOK PENETRATIONS\r\n\r\n26–27 October 1952]\r\n\r\nAll possible support for 1/7 was made available, since the critical\r\nsituation resulting from the major enemy assault automatically\r\nsuspended previous restrictions on use of artillery and mortar\r\nallowances. At Warsaw, 2/11 blanketed the position with a continuous\r\nbarrage in order to limit the enemy’s ability to effectively hold and\r\nconsolidate the captured COP. Lieutenant Colonel Davis’ cannoneers also\r\nblasted enemy formations in response to fire missions from forward\r\nobservers. Artillery rounds fell on Chinese outposts supporting the\r\nattack, on approach routes to the battleground, on assembly areas, and\r\non known and suspected Chinese artillery locations.\r\n\r\nMarine aviation and tanks were employed as part of the plan to first\r\nlimit the penetration made by the enemy before the counterattack to\r\nexpel him. A section of tanks had been firing since 1930 against the\r\nenemy main line; a second section joined the direct fire assault a\r\nhalf hour later. At 2113, one F7F, with 1,300 pounds of bombs, hit\r\na portion of the enemy’s MSR. At 2306, another twin-engine Grumman\r\nTigercat blasted the same area, about three-quarters of a mile west of\r\nthe Hook. These initial one-plane strikes in support of the defense of\r\nthe salient were flown by Captain Leon C. Cheek, Jr. and Major Laurel\r\nM. Mickelson, respectively, of VMF(N)-513.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reno Demonstration_[280]\r\n\r\n    [280] The material in this section has been derived from\r\n          7thMar, “Summary of Action, 26 Oct-1 Nov 52, Hook, Reno,\r\n          Ronson”; 2/7 ComdD, Oct 52.\r\n\r\nAt 0030 on the 27th, Major Mickelson, returning from his MPQ attack,\r\ntouched his Tigercat down at K-8 (Kunsan). At the very moment that\r\nthe plane set down on the Kunsan runway, the Chinese launched another\r\nassault against the 7th Marines, the second in less than six hours.\r\nThis later action, in Lieutenant Colonel Caputo’s 2/7 sector, nearly\r\ntwo miles west of the Hook, was not a surprise move either. In fact, an\r\nattack against the Carson-Reno-Vegas area had been anticipated for some\r\ntime, and it was this state of preparedness that throttled the enemy’s\r\nattempt to seize an outpost here.\r\n\r\nDivision intelligence had accumulated considerable evidence that the\r\nChinese buildup in late October was intended to ultimately clear the\r\nway to the 2/7 outposts rather than those of 1/7 in the eastern Hook\r\narea. A majority of the Marine supporting arms effort immediately prior\r\nto 1800 on the 26th had gone to the left battalion of Colonel Moore’s\r\nregiment. Aware of the interest the enemy had shown in the outposts\r\nearlier in the month, the battalion commander had strengthened the\r\ndefense of this key area. One measure, increasing the size of the\r\nambush force maintained at night near Reno from a squad to a platoon,\r\nwas to pay handsome dividends before October was over.\r\n\r\nJust after dark on the 26th, a reinforced platoon from Captain James\r\nR. Flores’ Company E departed the MLR on a combat patrol and ambush\r\nmission. After reaching its assigned area, about 300 yards short of\r\nthe hill that housed COP Reno, the ambush platoon disappeared into\r\ncamouflaged dug-in positions and waited. At midnight, the Marines were\r\nalerted by faint noises to the front. There, elements of two Chinese\r\ncompanies, which had stealthily maneuvered into the ambush area, were\r\norganizing for a sneak assault by an envelopment on Reno from the rear.\r\n(See Map 18.) The waiting platoon apprised the outpost of the enemy’s\r\npresence in the area; then when it appeared that the Chinese were about\r\nto launch their assault, the ambushers opened fire.\r\n\r\nAs the surprised Chinese turned to take on the hidden ambush\r\nplatoon, the two defending squads at Reno began firing. It took 10\r\nminutes before the Chinese were sufficiently recovered to organize\r\na withdrawal. At 0040, enemy elements quickly began to pull back\r\ntowards the north. The outpost had been spared a major action, but its\r\noccupants were to be again engaged by the Chinese before daybreak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 18      K. White\r\n\r\nOUTPOST RENO ATTACKS\r\n\r\n27 October 1952]\r\n\r\nAt 0400, one platoon from a third CCF company, approaching from an\r\nenemy hill to the northeast, hit Reno. The attack was conducted in a\r\nfashion not previously experienced by the 1st Marine Division in West\r\nKorea--platoons echeloned in depth, assaulting in successive waves.\r\nThe first unit to reach Reno was composed of grenade throwers and\r\nsupporting riflemen. This advance element was followed immediately\r\nby the rest of the platoon, infantry armed with submachine guns and\r\nrifles. Marines on Reno were not troubled by the initial platoon\r\nassault, but the second one made some inroads before the defenders’\r\nfires forced the enemy to pull back. A third two-phased attack\r\nsucceeded, however, in cracking the defenses at the northeast section\r\nof the position. The outpost commander then ordered his Marines into\r\nthe bunkers and called for overhead artillery fire. Caught in the open,\r\nthe Chinese were forced to withdraw at 0440 and did not return.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Counterattack_[281]\r\n\r\n    [281] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdD, Oct 52; 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl,\r\n          dtd 27–28 Oct 52; 7thMar, 11thMar, 1/7, 4/11, 1st TkBn,\r\n          VMAs-121, -212, -323 ComdDs, Oct. 52.\r\n\r\nAfter the Marines in Lieutenant Colonel Caputo’s 2/7 sector had dealt\r\nwith the demonstration force, the action shifted back to the Hook.\r\nEarly on the morning of the 27th, Captain McLaughlin’s unit, sent\r\nto the Hook-Hill 146 crest to block the penetration of the MLR, had\r\nestablished contact with Captain Byrum’s Company C, passed through\r\nits lines, and pressed on to the Hook. Suddenly, enemy small arms and\r\nmachine guns opened up on lead elements of Company A. Artillery and\r\nmortar fire then began to hit the company. The Marines continued their\r\nadvance and made some progress in arresting the Chinese thrust at the\r\nridge. Shortly thereafter the enemy called in heavy supporting fires,\r\nforcing Company A to halt its attack temporarily. When the company\r\ncommander ordered his men to resume the advance, overwhelming enemy\r\nfire again slowed the movement. McLaughlin then ordered his men to hold\r\nand dig in.\r\n\r\nWhen report of the Company A situation reached the regimental CP,\r\nColonel Moore ordered into action his last reserve unit, Captain\r\nBernard B. Belant’s Company H.[282] He was directed to report to 1/7,\r\nthen to pass through the depleted ranks of Company A, and take up the\r\nattack downridge towards the salient. At 0340 the regiment attached\r\nH/3/7 to 1/7 for operational control; at 0505 the company arrived at\r\nthe 1st Battalion CP. Forty minutes later, Company H reached Captain\r\nMcLaughlin’s area, where it regrouped and then deployed toward the\r\nridgeline for the counterattack.\r\n\r\n    [282] At 0545 on the 25th, Company I (Captain John Thomas),\r\n          then the regimental reserve, and Captain Belant’s Company\r\n          H, responsible for the right sector of 3/7, had exchanged\r\n          roles.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Belant led his Marines towards the Hook to oust the\r\nChinese, the enemy drive had reached the point of its deepest\r\npenetration. By this time the Chinese had seized control of slightly\r\nmore than a mile of the meandering MLR. Most of the captured main\r\ndefense line extended from the Hook east along the ridge towards Hill\r\n146. (One-third of the Communist advance was from the Hook southwest,\r\nin the direction of the 3d Battalion boundary.) Between 0545 and 0800,\r\nH/3/7 worked its way towards the Hook-Hill 146 crest. After two hours\r\nthe company was at the ridgeline, and at 0800 Captain Belant was ready\r\nto move forward towards the salient, a straight-line distance of about\r\na half-mile. On the hour, the push downridge started. After having\r\nadvanced about 200 yards, the H/3/7 Marines were assailed by small\r\narms fire and the rain of heavy caliber rounds supporting the enemy’s\r\nthrust. Captain Belant signalled his Marines to attack.\r\n\r\nImmediately, Second Lieutenant George H. O’Brien, Jr. leaped up from\r\nhis position and shouted for his platoon to follow. On the run, he\r\nzigzagged across the exposed ridge and continued down the front slope\r\ntowards the main trench. Before reaching this objective, the platoon\r\ncommander was knocked to the ground by the impact of a single bullet.\r\nScrambling quickly to his feet he motioned for his men to follow\r\nand took off on the run for the enemy-occupied trenchline. Again he\r\nstopped, this time to assist an injured Marine.\r\n\r\nAs he neared the trenchline, Lieutenant O’Brien started to throw a\r\nhand grenade into the enemy-occupied bunkers, but was stopped by\r\nthe Chinese. With his carbine, the officer methodically eliminated\r\nthis resistance, then hurled the grenades. Overcoming this position,\r\nthe Texas Marine and his platoon advanced towards the Hook, but the\r\nenemy, now partly recovered, was able to slow and ultimately stop the\r\ncounterattack. A profusion of artillery and mortar fire was primarily\r\nresponsible for halting the advance, which had carried Company H very\r\nclose to the Hook bunkers.\r\n\r\nSpurred on by the leadership of Lieutenant O’Brien, who later received\r\nthe Medal of Honor,[283] the company was able to execute a limited\r\nadvance. Despite the heavy artillery and mortar fire, the company drove\r\na wedge into the Communist position, thereby retaking the initiative\r\nfrom the enemy. Company H also took three prisoners in the southeast\r\nend of the Hook before being forced by a deadly enemy mortar and\r\nartillery barrage to withdraw upridge.\r\n\r\n    [283] Another Medal of Honor resulting from the Hook action\r\n          was awarded posthumously to Second Lieutenant Sherrod E.\r\n          Skinner, Jr. for “conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity.”\r\n          Lieutenant Skinner, whose twin brother was also a Marine\r\n          officer, had been assigned as an artillery forward\r\n          observer with F/2/11. When the Chinese attack hit the\r\n          MLR, Lieutenant Skinner organized the surviving Marines\r\n          in defense of their observation post. Fighting off the\r\n          enemy and calling down defensive artillery fire on the\r\n          assaulting Chinese, he delayed capture of the position.\r\n          Twice he left the bunker to direct fire on the enemy and\r\n          get more ammunition.\r\n\r\n    When the Communists finally overran the bunker, Lieutenant\r\n          Skinner instructed his fellow Marines to pretend\r\n          they were dead; during the next three hours several\r\n          different enemy groups frisked the inert Marines without\r\n          discovering their ruse. Later, when a skeptical enemy\r\n          soldier hurled a grenade into the bunker, Lieutenant\r\n          Skinner unhesitatingly rolled on top of the missile,\r\n          shielding the two surviving Marines. By thus absorbing\r\n          the full force of the explosion, he sacrificed his life\r\n          for theirs. (2dLt Sherrod E. Skinner, Jr. Biog. File)\r\n\r\nThe attack by Company H had been well supported from the air. At\r\n0840, a flight of four ADs from Lieutenant Colonel Cargill’s VMA-121\r\nassaulted the former Marine COP Seattle, where enemy reinforcements\r\nwere being funneled through on the way to the Hook. Bombs and napalm\r\ntook a heavy toll of the troops, bunkers, and weapons pouring fire on\r\nthe counterattacking Marines. One hour later, a division (four planes)\r\nfrom VMA-323 struck another trouble spot, a former Marine outpost known\r\nas Irene (later, Rome). Aircraft of Lieutenant Colonel Chamberlain’s\r\nsquadron hit this objective with three tons of bombs and more than\r\n4,000 pounds of burning napalm. Thirty minutes later, another foursome,\r\nthese from VMA-212, (Lieutenant Colonel Charles E. Dobson, Jr.),[284]\r\ndelivered bombs, napalm, and 20mm shells on enemy soldiers moving on\r\nthe MSR towards JAMESTOWN.\r\n\r\n    [284] The new squadron commander had relieved Lieutenant\r\n          Colonel Maurice Fletcher two days earlier. This flight\r\n          was the first of two CAS attacks in behalf of the Hook\r\n          forces that the new commanding officer participated in\r\n          that day.\r\n\r\nWhile these three squadrons were bombing enemy strongpoints and other\r\ntargets of opportunity, division artillery and tanks continued their\r\ndestructive fire missions. Between 0930 and 1300, two tanks from\r\nCompany A, 1st Tank Battalion, blasted away at Chinese bunkers and\r\ntrenches, at an enemy 76mm gun on Seattle, and at positions southwest\r\nof the Hook. Artillery--2/11, 4/11, and the rocket battery--contributed\r\nthe weight of its support. The 11th Marines, in an effort to stop the\r\nheavy hostile shelling of the Hook sector, fired 60 counterbattery\r\nmissions on Chinese gun emplacements during the first 24 hours of the\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nIn the early afternoon of the 27th, 1st MAW attack squadrons continued\r\ntheir bombing and strafing of enemy troops engaged in the assault\r\nagainst the Hook. Before sundown, 30 aircraft had taken part in 8\r\nadditional strikes in support of Marine counterattacks along the ridge.\r\nThe number of aircraft involved in close air support sorties for the\r\nHook was approximately half the number received by the division all\r\nday. Of the 72 aircraft flying CAS strikes during the first 24 hours of\r\nthe Hook action, 67 were Marine planes, all from MAG-12.\r\n\r\nAs in the morning’s close air support flights, Lieutenant Colonel\r\nCargill’s ADs provided the bulk of air support for ground action\r\nthat afternoon. Striking first a command post southeast of the 1/7\r\nsalient, at 1410, VMA-121 came back a half-hour later with four more\r\nSkyraiders against CCF troops pressing to envelop the right flank of\r\nthe counterattack force. At 1635, two squadron aircraft flew in quickly\r\nin response to a sighting of troops moving forward in the Samichon\r\ntributary 1,000 yards north of the Hook. Twenty minutes after this\r\nsuccessful attack, four more Skyraiders attacked bunkers opposite the\r\nleft flank of Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki’s sector. The final daylight\r\nstrike for 1/7 was again made by four ADs from -121. These planes took\r\nunder attack a target that had been bombarded just 25 minutes earlier\r\nby Corsairs from VMA-323.\r\n\r\nAnother Marine attack squadron, VMA-212, participated in the Hook\r\nsupport that afternoon. At 1344, a four-plane flight assaulted troops\r\nmoving through Frisco to reinforce the Chinese drive on the Hook. Two\r\nof the planes dropped three 1,000-pound bombs and two 250-pounders\r\non the enemy soldiers. The other pair of attack Corsairs released\r\nsix 780-pound napalm tanks over the position. It was estimated that\r\n25 Chinese casualties resulted from this air attack. Wrapping up the\r\nVMA-212 CAS for the Hook sector on the 27th was a strike, at 1440, on\r\ncamouflaged positions and another at 1520 against caves and bunkers.\r\nEach of these air assaults took place about 950 yards from the Hook.\r\nThe earlier one was a napalm attack from 50 feet above the ground. One\r\nof the six tanks would not release and three did not ignite. Four caves\r\nwere destroyed and one bunker was damaged in the latter strikes.\r\n\r\nBetween the morning and afternoon air strikes, the ground commanders\r\nput together the final plans for recapture and defense of the Hook.\r\nWhen General Pollock had released I/3/1 to the regiment during an\r\ninspection trip to the 1/7 area that morning, the company was already\r\nen route to the ridge to make the counterattack. The ground commanders\r\nagreed that after I/3/1 regained the salient, H/3/1 would take over the\r\nright sector of 1/7 and the relieved company, B/1/7, would then occupy\r\nboth the critical MLR sector and Warsaw. Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki’s\r\nscheme to recapture the positions and ground lost on 26 October was a\r\ncontinuation of the attack from atop the ridge directly towards the\r\nobjective. It was to be a hard-nosed, frontal assault, but the only\r\nmaneuver deemed advisable.\r\n\r\nClearing the Company C command post about noon, the lead elements of\r\nCaptain Murray V. Harlan, Jr.’s Company I, the 1st Platoon, continued\r\nits route to the ridge. After the 40 Marines had gained the crest,\r\nthey quickly reoriented themselves to the new direction, and at 1350,\r\nled the I/3/1 assault. Artillery preparation by the 11th Marines had\r\npreceded the crossing of the line of departure, and these supporting\r\nfires were partially responsible for the substantial initial advance\r\nmade by the counterattacking Marines. But Chinese artillery was not\r\nidle at this time either, and the volume of enemy fire matched that of\r\nthe Marines. The I/3/1 movement forward was also slowed by Communist\r\nsoldiers, estimated at about a company, who fired from protected\r\npositions along the perimeter of the Hook.\r\n\r\nInch by inch the company crawled forward. The vicious Chinese\r\nsupporting barrages were exacting many casualties among Captain\r\nHarlan’s troops,[285] yet they crept on, and ultimately reached the\r\nartillery forward observer bunker atop the ridge but 150 yards short of\r\nthe Hook trenches. At this time, 1635, the enemy supporting fires were\r\ndirected not only on the advancing Marines and the MLR defenses but\r\nextended as far back as the regimental CP.[286] Chinese soldiers still\r\nclung to some of the Hook positions and trenches of the MLR just below\r\nthe crest on the northern sides. Marines closest to the Hook could see\r\nthe virtual ruination caused by enemy artillery and mortar shells to\r\nthe trench system within the salient.\r\n\r\n    [285] During this action, the company suffered 15 killed, 71\r\n          seriously wounded, and 6 slightly wounded. 3/1 ComdD,\r\n          Oct. 52, p. 3.\r\n\r\n    [286] 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl, dtd 27 Oct 52.\r\n\r\nNearing their objective, elements of Company I pressed on with even\r\nmore determination. By 1700 a few had made it to the shell-torn\r\nditches, where they sought momentary refuge to reorganize. Several more\r\njoined, and together they reconnoitered the trenches and bunkers for\r\nenemy soldiers. Just then the Communists reacted with an even heavier\r\nsupporting arms assault, which forced these few Marines to pull back\r\nwith their platoon to the reverse slope of the ridge. To the right,\r\nabout 250 yards away, the main body of Company I Marines occupied the\r\nreverse side of the hill, riding out the onslaught of artillery and\r\nmortar rounds while they waited for a lull before making the final dash\r\nto recapture the lost area of JAMESTOWN.\r\n\r\nWhile Captain Harlan’s company was exposed to this extremely heavy\r\nenemy artillery fire, another unit, B/1/7, was on the move from\r\nLieutenant Colonel Dulacki’s command post to the ridge to strike what\r\nwas intended as a lethal blow to the Communist invaders. At 1932,\r\nCompany B began its march forward. By midnight, the 1st Platoon was\r\nnearing its assault position close to the left flank of Company I of\r\n3/1. Simultaneously, the 3d Platoon closed in on its jump-off point.\r\nThe going was extremely difficult, complicated by a moonless night and\r\nthe many shell craters that pockmarked the terrain. But at 0019, 28\r\nOctober, the platoons mounted their assault, firing their rifles and\r\nmachine guns, and hurling grenades to silence enemy automatic weapons\r\nand to reach dug-in Communist soldiers occupying the trenchline.\r\n\r\nThe Marine charge was met by a burst of small arms fire and a shower\r\nof grenades. Weapons supporting the Chinese defense were still very\r\nactive. After a standoff of 90 minutes the Marines pulled back, calling\r\non their mortars and artillery to lay precise fire concentrations on\r\nthe trouble spots. The weapons also fired on enemy approach routes\r\nthrough Ronson and Warsaw. After this preparation, Company B again\r\nmade an assault against the enemy, at 0340. This advance was contested\r\nvigorously by the Chinese, but their resistance this time was not\r\nlasting. Quickly B/1/7 Marines deployed throughout the entire area, and\r\nby 0600 the Hook was again in Marine hands.\r\n\r\nBefore the victors could permit themselves the luxury of a breathing\r\nspell, there were a number of critical tasks that demanded immediate\r\nattention. Defense of the MLR had to be quickly and securely shored\r\nup for a possible enemy counterattack. The newly rewon area had to be\r\nsearched for Marines, both casualties and holdouts, and for Chinese\r\ndiehards or wounded. The company had to be reorganized. In addition to\r\nthese missions, there were two others, regaining Ronson and Warsaw. As\r\nit turned out, the duties were discharged nearly at the same time. COPs\r\nRonson and Warsaw were reoccupied by the 7th Marines at 0630 and 0845,\r\nrespectively, on 28 October.\r\n\r\nIn organizing the recaptured position, the Marines were hampered to\r\nsome extent by a dense ground fog. Nevertheless, work still went ahead\r\non these necessary tasks. Most of the Hook area was held by Company B;\r\nthe western part of the 1/7 line, south of the Hook, was still manned\r\nby the platoon from Company A and one from Company C. The 1st Platoon\r\nof Company B quickly searched the retaken area of the MLR (except the\r\ncaved in parts of the trenchline and bunkers, which were investigated\r\nlater), but found no enemy soldiers. During the day, as Company B\r\nexpanded its responsibility along the Marine main line, the platoons\r\nfrom A/1/7 and C/1/7 were relieved to rejoin their companies.[287]\r\nSupplies began to move in, once the permanency of the defense had been\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n    [287] As a part of the reorganization, H/3/1 remained in the\r\n          right sector, and Company C, of the Hook battalion,\r\n          filled in the middle. Company A was in position on the\r\n          friendly side of that part of the ridge held by Captain\r\n          Byrum’s Company C. During the afternoon of the 28th,\r\n          I/3/1 and H/3/7 also left Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki’s\r\n          area to rejoin their parent organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Overview_[288]\r\n\r\n    [288] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdD, Oct 52; 1stMarDiv PIRs\r\n          734–735, 741, dtd 29–30 Oct 52, 5 Nov. 52.\r\n\r\nIn evaluating the battle for the Hook, it would appear that the Chinese\r\nassault against Reno was merely a demonstration or feint. By making a\r\nsizable effort near the primary objective after the attack there was\r\nwell under way, the Communists expected not to obscure the real target\r\nbut rather to cause the Marines to hesitate in moving higher echelon\r\nreserves to influence the action at the Hook. It was to the credit of\r\nthe ambush force that the Chinese ruse was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIncluding losses from the Reno ambush, Marines estimated that the\r\nChinese actions against that outpost cost the enemy 38 killed and 51\r\nwounded. The COP defenders and the platoon that had surprised the enemy\r\ncounted 22 dead Communist soldiers during and after the Reno action.\r\nTogether with the Hook casualties, confirmed at 274 killed and 73\r\nwounded and estimated at 494 killed and 370 wounded,[289] the figure\r\nrepresented more than a third of an enemy battalion permanently lost in\r\naddition to about a battalion and a half put out of action temporarily.\r\nDistributed among the number of battalions that participated in the two\r\nactions, the total number of casualties lost some impact. What remains\r\nsignificant, however, are the cost and results--369 counted and 953\r\nestimated casualties for not one inch of ground.\r\n\r\n    [289] The CCF casualty figures were derived from a comparison\r\n          of reports of participating Marine battalions, the 7th\r\n          Marines, and division. In addition to these losses caused\r\n          by Marine infantry units were enemy casualties listed\r\n          by the artillery and tank battalion command diaries and\r\n          records of participating air squadrons; these supporting\r\n          arms figures amount to 468 casualties, more than\r\n          one-third the total number.\r\n\r\nMarine losses in the Hook battle were 70 killed, 386 wounded (286\r\nevacuated), and 39 missing, of whom 27 were later definitely known\r\nto have been captured. This was the second highest number of Marines\r\ntaken prisoner in any single action during the Korean fighting.[290]\r\nSuch a large number was attributed to the tactics of the Chinese\r\ninfantry, which followed the preparatory barrages so closely--at times\r\neven advancing into the rolling barrages--that the enemy was able to\r\nsurprise and capture a considerable number of Marine outpost defenders.\r\nNearly all of the 27 were captured in the enemy’s first rushes against\r\nthe two outposts and MLR. In the diversion on Reno, an additional 9\r\nMarines were killed and 49 wounded (29 evacuated).\r\n\r\n    [290] During the Task Force Drysdale operation, in November\r\n          1950, more than 40 Marines had been seized by the enemy.\r\n          Maj James Angus MacDonald, Jr., “The Problems of U.S.\r\n          Marine Corps Prisoners of War in Korea” (M.A. thesis,\r\n          Univ. of Maryland, 1961), App. G, pp. 261–262, hereafter\r\n          MacDonald, _POW_.\r\n\r\nPerhaps as significant as any result of the Hook fighting is the amount\r\nof supporting fires the Chinese provided their infantry. Calculations\r\nof total incoming ran from 15,500 to 34,000 rounds during the 36-hour\r\nengagement. The 1st Marine Division reported conservatively that the\r\nenemy expended between 15,500–16,000 artillery and mortar rounds;\r\nestimates by supporting arms units put the total at the higher level.\r\nIn any event, the 12,500 rounds the 7th Marines received during the\r\nfirst 24 hours represented the heaviest bombardment any Marine regiment\r\nhad been subjected to up to that time. Moreover, it had now become\r\nclearly evident that the enemy could stockpile a plentiful supply of\r\nammunition, despite attempts of UN aircraft to interfere with the\r\nenemy’s flow of supplies to the frontline.[291]\r\n\r\n    [291] Comments by Dr. Robert F.

Defensive concentrations of apparently unlimited quantity\r\ntypified Communist artillery support for their attacking forces.\r\nMeticulous policing of the battlefield, an established Chinese\r\npractice, was also apparent during the Hook battle. In order to prevent\r\nidentification of his combat units, the enemy also took pains to ensure\r\nthat assault troops remove all papers and unit insignia before going\r\nforward of their own lines.\r\n\r\nTwo other previously reported tactics were corroborated during the late\r\nOctober battle for the Hook. One was the presence of cargo carriers\r\nwith the attacking force. These soldiers, estimated by the division\r\nto comprise as high as 75 percent of the total number of Chinese\r\ntroops committed, carried shovels, lumber, extra rations, medical aid\r\nequipment, and stocks of ammunition. One Marine evacuated from a bunker\r\nreported on a method of bunker searching by the Chinese. “English\r\nspeaking Chinese were yelling into bunkers for Marines to ‘Come out\r\nand surrender.’ When there was no evidence of surrender, the Chinese\r\nwould use bangalore torpedoes and satchel charges to destroy and seal\r\nbunkers.”[292]\r\n\r\n    [292] 1stMarDiv PIR 738, dtd 2 Nov 52, p. 3. The Chinese also\r\n          used hand grenades in searching the bunkers. All of these\r\n          explosives had been widely employed during World War II.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the enemy deviated from his usual tactics. During the\r\nbattle for the Hook Marines who took prisoners made the discovery that\r\nthe Chinese employed close-up relief forces. Prior to an offensive\r\naction, the enemy positioned a reserve just to the rear of the assault\r\nunit. After the attack had started, and at the appropriate time, the\r\ncommander would signal the fresh force forward to take over the mission\r\nof the old unit. In this manner, the enemy hoped to sustain his drive\r\nor to retain a newly-won position.\r\n\r\nThough the foresight appeared appropriate, the result was not always\r\nwhat had been anticipated. In the earlier part of the month, during a\r\nfight in another I Corps sector, the Communists had rushed a reserve\r\nforce forward to consolidate the defense of an outpost immediately\r\nafter its capture. In the Hook fighting, a fresh unit, which had been\r\nplaced immediately to the rear of the assault troops, was ordered\r\nforward to keep the attack alive. Both attempts failed. Marines\r\nattributed this lack of success to the Communists’ apparent inability\r\nto organize or reorganize quickly, a difficulty which was believed to\r\nhave resulted from the scarcity of officers in forward areas.[293]\r\n\r\n    [293] 1stMarDiv PIR 741, dtd 5 Nov 52, Encl. 2, p. 2.\r\n\r\nDiscussing the defense of the Hook area, Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki\r\ncommented shortly after the battle ended:\r\n\r\n  The Chinese seemed to gain their greatest tactical advantage\r\n  during action on “The Hook” by assaulting friendly positions\r\n  directly under their own artillery and mortar barrages. The\r\n  effects on defending Marines were two-fold: heavy incoming either\r\n  physically trapped them in their bunkers, or the Chinese, having\r\n  overrun our positions through their own barrages, took the\r\n  defenders by surprise as they left their bunkers to man their\r\n  fighting holes. It is therefore considered imperative that in\r\n  future instances of heavy enemy supporting fires, all Marines\r\n  physically occupy an individual shelter from which their fighting\r\n  positions are readily accessible.\r\n\r\n  Marines gained a false sense of security by taking cover, in\r\n  groups, inside bunkers. In some cases, groups of three or four\r\n  Marines were killed when a bunker caved in on top of them. Had\r\n  they been spread out along the trenchline, but under individual\r\n  cover, it is believed that far fewer casualties would have\r\n  resulted, and also the position would have been better prepared\r\n  for defense. The false sense of security gained by being with\r\n  comrades inside a bunker must be overcome.[294]\r\n\r\n    [294] 1/7 ComdD, Nov 52, App. VI.\r\n\r\nAnother factor bothered the 1/7 commander. He directed unit leaders to\r\nexercise closer control over the care and cleaning of weapons under\r\ntheir custody. During the Hook fighting, the malfunctioning of weapons\r\ndue to improper cleaning and loss of some rifles “in the excitement to\r\ngain cover” caused the Marines to take casualties that might otherwise\r\nhave been prevented.\r\n\r\nThese same deficiencies were also observed by General Pollock, and\r\nhe ordered their immediate correction. Lieutenant General Hart, CG\r\nFMFPac, whose inspection of the division coincided with the Hook battle\r\nand who saw the trenches after they had been leveled, noted that\r\nshallow trenches and bunkers built above the ground did not offer\r\nsufficient protection from intensive enemy shelling. He directed that\r\nmore emphasis be placed on the digging of field fortifications and\r\nbunkers.[295]\r\n\r\n    [295] CG, FMFPac ComdD, Nov 52, App IV, Encl (8), Anx G, p. 4.\r\n          During the Hook fighting, General Hart also witnessed\r\n          the helicopter deployment of the 4.5-inch rockets. He\r\n          was impressed with the progress that had been made in\r\n          this helicopter-ground team performance, particularly the\r\n          speed and efficiency with which these weapons could be\r\n          set up to fire and then displaced to a new position.\r\n\r\nIn considering not only how the fight was conducted but why, one has\r\nonly to go back to the first part of October and recall the situation\r\nthat existed along the 1st Marine Division line. During the hotly\r\ncontested outpost battles early in the month, the Chinese had attempted\r\nto outflank the division by seizing key terrain in the left and right\r\nsectors. Where the enemy had been unsuccessful, he returned later in\r\nthe month for another major assault. On the night of the 26th the\r\nendeavor was in the division right. A new blow against the left was not\r\nfar off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPositional Warfare\r\n\r\n_A Successful Korean Defense--Six Months on the UNC Line--Events on the\r\nDiplomatic Front--The Marine Commands During the Third Winter--1st MAW\r\nOperations 1952–1953 Behind the Lines--The Quiet Sectors--Changes in\r\nthe Concept of Ground Defense--Before the Nevadas Battle_\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Successful Korean Defense_[296]\r\n\r\n    [296] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdDs Oct-Nov 52; 1stMarDiv PIRs\r\n          737–738, dtd 31 Oct-1 Nov 52; KMC Regt UnitRpts 238–244,\r\n          dtd 24–30 Oct 52.\r\n\r\nIn both the early and late October outpost battles the Chinese had\r\nattempted to seize critical terrain on the flanks of the 1st Marine\r\nDivision. Although the majority of these attacks failed, the enemy had\r\nacquired six outposts early in the month--three in the western Korean\r\nMarine Corps sector and three north of the right regimental line. On\r\nthe last day of October, two hours before midnight, the CCF again\r\nstruck the Marine left flank. This time their efforts were directed\r\nagainst four outposts that screened Hill 155, the most prominent\r\nterrain feature in the entire KMC regimental zone. The fighting that\r\ndeveloped was brief but very sharp and would be the most costly of all\r\nKMC clashes during this third winter of the war.\r\n\r\nThe latest enemy attack came as no real surprise to Korean Marines\r\nof the 5th Battalion, occupying COPs 39, 33, and 31 in the northern\r\nregimental sector, or 2d Battalion personnel at COP 51 in the southern\r\n(western) half of the MLR. (Map 19.) The four outposts assisted in\r\ndefense of the MLR (particularly Hill 155 just inside the MLR),\r\nafforded observation of CCF approach routes, and served as a base\r\nfor friendly raids and offensive operations. Hill 155 overlooked both\r\nthe wide Sachon Valley and Chinese frontline positions to the west.\r\nThis critical Korean hill also commanded a view of the Panmunjom peace\r\ncorridor, Freedom Gate Bridge, and the Marine division area east\r\nof Line JAMESTOWN in the KMC sector. Hill 155 had further tactical\r\nimportance in that it protected the left flank of Paekhak Hill, the key\r\nground in the entire 34-mile expanse of JAMESTOWN within 1st Marine\r\nDivision territory.\r\n\r\nActually, the probability of a determined enemy attack against the four\r\noutposts had been anticipated since early October following CCF seizure\r\nof three positions (former COPs 37, 36, and 86) in their strike against\r\nthe KMC regimental OPLR. The enemy had then proceeded to organize an\r\nOPLR of his own with the two northern outposts, COPs 37 and 36, and\r\ninformally occupied another position to the south and one toward the\r\nnorth in the vicinity of COP 39. “With this OPLR once firmly organized,\r\nthe enemy will have an excellent jump-off point towards our OPs 39 and\r\n33, his next probable objectives,” KMC officers reasoned.[297]\r\n\r\n    [297] KMC Regt UnitRpt 216, dtd 4 Oct 52, p. 2.\r\n\r\nSporadic probes throughout the month in the COP 39 and 33 areas\r\nindicated continued enemy interest in the positions. COP 51, to the\r\nsouth, was considered another likely target because of its location\r\nimmediately east of COP 86, previously annexed by the CCF.\r\n\r\nPrior to attacking the four outposts on 31 October, the Chinese had\r\nsignaled their intentions by sharply stepping up artillery and tank\r\nfire against the sector. During the 24-hour period ending 1800 on 30\r\nOctober, a total of 1,881 rounds crashed on KMC positions, most of\r\nthese against the two northern outposts, COPs 39 and 33. Nearly 1,500\r\nrounds fell the next day. More than 50 sightings of enemy troops and\r\nweapons in the forward area were also reported. By contrast, during the\r\nprevious week less than 15 observations of enemy activity had been made\r\ndaily and, on the average, only about 200–340 rounds of fire had fallen\r\nin the entire sector. Despite this comparatively moderate rate of\r\nhostile fire, at least one Korean Marine was killed and three wounded\r\nin late October from well-placed Chinese mortar or artillery rounds\r\nstriking the outposts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 19      K. White\r\n\r\nCCF ATTACK AGAINST KMC SECTOR\r\n\r\n(Division Left)\r\n\r\n31 October 1952]\r\n\r\nAfter the two days of heavy shelling, the regiment warned in its daily\r\nreport issued only two hours before the full-scale attack began:\r\n\r\n  The enemy has made a consistent two-day effort to destroy\r\n  friendly outpost positions. Last night, at 1830, two enemy\r\n  companies were observed in an apparent attempt to attack OPs 39\r\n  and 33. Artillery fire broke up the attempt, but continued enemy\r\n  artillery today indicates further attack is probable tonight.\r\n  If enemy artillery preparation is indicative, a simultaneous\r\n  attack against outposts 39, 51, 33, and 31 can be considered\r\n  probable....[298]\r\n\r\n    [298] KMC Regt UnitRpt 243, dtd 31 Oct 52, pp. 5–6.\r\n\r\nThese earlier observations and predictions as to the enemy’s action\r\nwere shortly confirmed when the CCF launched its new ground attack.\r\n\r\nBeginning at 2200,[299] the enemy delivered an intensive eight-minute\r\n76mm and 122mm artillery preparation against the four outposts. Chinese\r\nassault forces from four different infantry regiments then launched a\r\nsimultaneous attack on the positions. Moving in from the north, west,\r\nand south, two CCF companies (3d Company, 1st Battalion, 581st Regiment\r\nand 2d Company, 1st Battalion, 582d Regiment) virtually enveloped the\r\nnorthern outpost, COP 39. Two more CCF companies (unidentified) lunged\r\nagainst the two central outposts, COPs 33 and 31, a company at each\r\nposition.[300] The southern and most-heavily defended post, COP 51,\r\nwhere a company of Korean Marines was on duty, was assailed by four\r\nChinese companies (4th Company, 2d Battalion, 584th Regiment; 4th and\r\n6th Companies, 2d Battalion, 585th Regiment; and 1st Company, 1st\r\nBattalion, 585th Regiment). Even though the enemy exerted his strongest\r\npressure against COP 51, the position held and the Chinese broke off\r\nthe attack there earlier than at the other outposts.\r\n\r\n    [299] The attack on the 31st took place after the KMC 5th\r\n          Battalion had taken over the right regimental sector,\r\n          at 1700, from the 3d Battalion. The Chinese often\r\n          deliberately timed their outpost attacks to coincide with\r\n          a relief of lines. Company personnel of both the 5th and\r\n          3d Battalions were on line during the fighting.

A different\r\n          account as to size of attacking units is given in Maj\r\n          Kang Shin Ho, ROKMC ltr to Dir, MCHist, HQMC, dtd 30 Apr\r\n          70, which states two reinforced enemy companies assaulted\r\n          COP 33 and an estimated enemy battalion struck COP 31.\r\n\r\nAt COP 31 a heavy fire fight raged until 0155, when the defending\r\nKMC platoon halted the Chinese and forced them to make a partial\r\nwithdrawal. To the northwest, at COP 33, the enemy encountered less\r\nresistance from the two squads manning the outpost. The Chinese\r\nachieved some success in penetrating the defenses and occupied several\r\npositions. After heavy close fighting and friendly artillery support,\r\nthe Koreans expelled the invaders at 0515.\r\n\r\nThe enemy’s efforts appeared to have been most successful, temporarily,\r\nat COP 39, the northern post and one nearest to Hill 155. Although\r\nthe Chinese wrested some ground from the KMC platoon, artillery fires\r\ncontinued to punish the enemy and by 0410 had forced him to pull back.\r\nA small hostile force returned at 0600 but after a 15-minute exchange\r\nof small arms it left, this time for good. At about this same time the\r\nlast of the Chinese had also withdrawn from the two central outposts,\r\n33 and 31.\r\n\r\nIn terms of sheer numbers, the enemy’s strongest effort was made\r\nagainst COP 51. This was the most isolated of the Korean positions and,\r\nat 2,625 yards, the one farthest from the MLR. Ironically, in the week\r\npreceding the attack COP 51 was least harassed by hostile artillery\r\nalthough it had received 20 rounds of 90mm. tank fire, more than any\r\nother position. On the 31st, elements of three companies struck the\r\nsouthwestern trenches and defenses, while a fourth attempted to break\r\nthrough from the north. As it turned out the action here was the least\r\nintense of the outpost clashes. After initial heavy fighting the\r\nChinese seemed reluctant to press the assault even though they vastly\r\noutnumbered the Korean company deployed at the outpost. In the early\r\nmorning hours the enemy broke contact and by 0330 had withdrawn from\r\nCOP 51.\r\n\r\nDuring the night approximately 2,500 rounds of CCF artillery and\r\nmortar fire lashed the positions. Korean Marines, aided by friendly\r\nartillery, repelled the assault and inflicted heavy casualties on the\r\nenemy. Supporting fires included more than 1,200 rounds of HE shells\r\nfrom the KMC 4.2-inch Mortar Company. Chinese casualties were listed\r\nas 295 known killed, 461 estimated wounded, and 9 POWs. Korean Marine\r\nlosses were 50 killed, 86 wounded, and 18 missing.[301] By first light\r\nthe Korean outposts had thrown back the enemy’s latest well-coordinated\r\nattack. This ended the last significant action of October in the 1st\r\nMarine Division sector.\r\n\r\n    [301] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Six Months on the UNC Line_[302]\r\n\r\n    [302] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: Barclay, _Commonwealth_; Cagle and\r\n          Manson, _Sea War, Korea_; Clark, _Danube to Yalu_;\r\n          Field, _NavOps, Korea_; Futrell, _USAF, Korea_; Walter\r\n          G.

October had witnessed the\r\nmost intense combat in more than a year. As the third Korean winter\r\napproached outpost clashes and small unit actions along the rest of the\r\nUNC frontline began to slacken. During November and December, neither\r\nside appeared eager to pursue the offensive. Chinese aggressiveness\r\ndeclined noticeably.\r\n\r\nDespite other action initiated by the enemy, the I Corps sector\r\nremained the chief Communist target. On 19 November, the British 1st\r\nCommonwealth Division successfully withstood what was initially a\r\ncompany-size attempt to capture the Hook. In sharp fighting between\r\n1900 and 0430, Black Watch and reinforcing Canadian units repulsed\r\na determined battalion-strength CCF assault, killing more than\r\n100 Chinese.[303] Marine and I Corps artillery units fired almost\r\ncontinuously throughout the night in support of the Hook defenders.\r\nFighting flared again, briefly, in December in the I Corps sector when\r\nChinese soldiers attempted to overrun outposts on the Imjin River line,\r\nbut were thrown back by the ROK 1st Division. The enemy then tried\r\nto seize key terrain forward of the U.S. 2nd Division, but was again\r\nhalted.\r\n\r\n    [303] For details of this action see Canadian Department of\r\n          National Defence ltr to Dir, MCHist, HQMC, dtd 8 Jan 70\r\n          in v. V, Korean comment file.\r\n\r\nElsewhere before the end of the year, the CCF captured one outpost in\r\nthe IX Corps area, to the right of I Corps, but suffered a telling\r\ndefeat at the hands of the Ethiopian battalion during an attempt to\r\ncrack this sector of the U.S. 7th Division line. After a brief fire\r\nfight the Chinese were forced to withdraw, leaving 131 CCF dead in the\r\nEthiopian positions. North Korean efforts to seize critical ground in\r\nthe X and ROK I Corps sectors, at the far eastern end of the EUSAK\r\nline, was similarly broken up by the U.S. 40th and ROK 5th Divisions.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1952 General Van Fleet had not only revitalized his\r\ndefenses with recent rotation of frontline units but had also\r\nstrengthened his line by inserting another division in the critical\r\nand long-troublesome Chorwon-Kumhwa sector of IX Corps, on the I Corps\r\nright flank. With these changes by late December there were 16 EUSAK\r\ndivisions on line--11 Korean, 3 U.S. Army, 1 Marine, and 1 British\r\nCommonwealth--plus 4 divisions in reserve (1 Korean and 3 U.S. Army).\r\nNearly 75 percent of the UNC line had been entrusted to Republic of\r\nKorea units. Their performance was a tribute to growing ROK military\r\nproficiency and justified the EUSAK decision to assign to ROK troops a\r\ngreater role in the Allied ground defense.\r\n\r\nThe slow pace of infantry action during the last two months of 1952\r\ncontinued into the new year. Raids by small UNC units highlighted the\r\nlimited combat during January and February. During the following month\r\nthe battlefront tempo accelerated, due in part to expanded patrol\r\nactivities. A number of sharp clashes in No-Man’s-Land resulted in\r\nseveral Communist setbacks but led the enemy to make an increased use\r\nof ambushes. These traps initially caught the UNC troops by surprise,\r\ninflicting heavy casualties on them. But by far the most severe\r\nfighting of the new year resulted when the Chinese renewed their fierce\r\noutpost and main line of resistance attacks in March.\r\n\r\nAgain, the western I Corps sector was the major combat area as enemy\r\npressure mounted along the front. This was believed due, in part, to\r\nthe “growing Chinese sensitivity to the I Corps raids”[304] as well as\r\nan attempt by the CCF to regain the initiative as they began to send\r\nout larger forces to probe and assault UNC positions. On 17 March,\r\nthe Chinese launched a battalion-size attack against Hill 355 (Little\r\nGibraltar). This MLR position was defended by elements of the U.S. 2d\r\nInfantry Division, on line immediately east of the Marine division, in\r\nthe sector customarily occupied by the 1st Commonwealth Division. (The\r\nArmy unit had relieved the British division on 30 January.) A second\r\nlarge-scale assault on the hill that month was also turned back.\r\n\r\n    [304] Hermes, _Truce Tent_, p. 392.\r\n\r\nOn 23 March, a Chinese Communist regiment attempted to capture three\r\noutposts manned by the U.S. 7th Division, at the far right of the\r\nI Corps line. Hills 225 (Pork Chop Hill) and 191 held. The enemy’s\r\nmain effort was against Hill 266 (Old Baldy), defended by units of\r\nthe division’s Colombian battalion. One attack carried the position,\r\ndespite company strength reinforcements of the original defenders. Two\r\nstrong UN counterattacks the next day to retake the outpost failed,\r\nand the Chinese retained the crest of Old Baldy. Although the CCF had\r\ngained their objective in Hill 266, the battles on the three hillocks\r\nhad cost the enemy 750 casualties, according to 7th Division records.\r\n\r\nIn one respect, the nature and extent of ground operations affected the\r\ntype of air activity over North and South Korea during the winter of\r\n1952–1953. Introduction of PRESSURE strategy, which had embodied the\r\npolicy of the Far East Air Forces since mid-1952, brought more aircraft\r\nin close support of Eighth Army ground troops, a change that pleased\r\nthe corps commanders. When the heavy outpost fighting throughout\r\nOctober diminished to only occasional skirmishes in November, there\r\nwas temporarily a decreased need for large numbers of CAS sorties.\r\nAs a result more planes became available for PRESSURE attacks. These\r\nstrikes at first appeared to be reverting to the previous STRANGLE\r\nstrategy since railroads were often the targets. But interdiction\r\nof the transportation system was only part of the PRESSURE aerial\r\nconcept which also called for striking enemy production, repair, and\r\nstorage facilities. The Allied strategy in conducting its air offensive\r\nremained the same: to make the bombing hurt the Communists so that they\r\nwould end their deliberate delaying tactics in the truce sessions and\r\njoin the UNC in effecting a Korean settlement.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter FEAF maintained a steady air pressure against the\r\nCommunists. Major raids were made from time to time, but the number of\r\nstrategic targets was gradually disappearing due to repeated UNC air\r\nattacks. Further, much of the enemy logistical net had gone so deeply\r\nunderground during the prolonged stalemate that UN bombing and rocket\r\nattacks were having only a limited destructive effect. The U.S. B-29s,\r\nwhich had carried the fight to the enemy since the first week of the\r\nKorean conflict, found their last worthwhile objectives in stockpiles\r\nhidden in North Korean towns and villages. For the Fifth Air Force\r\nfighters there was little opportunity to increase their skill in\r\nair-to-air combat, since the Communist fliers continued to take evasive\r\naction and avoid “dogfights.”\r\n\r\nNaval aviation contributed importantly to UNC air operations from\r\nSeptember 1952 to March 1953. On the first day of this period, three\r\ncarriers staged the largest all-Navy Korean air strike to date, which\r\nsimultaneously attacked an oil refinery at Aoji and other targets\r\nin the northeastern corner of Korea. Less than two weeks later, two\r\ncarriers launched another assault in the same part of the country.\r\nThe significance of these September strikes stemmed from the almost\r\ncomplete lack of enemy response. Apparently the Communists in this\r\narea had felt secure and protected, their territory being next to the\r\nChinese border. In fact, their location close to the sanctuary had\r\nruled out bombings proposed earlier. Strikes in this part of Korea\r\nwere particularly suited to carrier planes of the Seventh Fleet, whose\r\nmobile airfields brought the targets within easy striking range along\r\napproaches that would not violate the Manchurian haven.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest naval contribution to the air war were the\r\nCherokee strikes, so named after the commander of the Seventh Fleet,\r\nVice Admiral Joseph J. Clark, because of his Indian ancestry. This\r\nnew type of deep air support attack, which came into use in October\r\n1952, employed the maxim of mass delivery of ordnance. Usually,\r\ntargets were immediately behind the enemy MLR but beyond the range of\r\nfriendly artillery. In May 1952, when the rail interdiction program\r\nwas being phased out and Admiral Clark’s pilots were faced with a\r\ndecreasing number of prime industrial targets, the fleet commander had\r\ntheorized that he could most effectually damage the enemy by bombing\r\nsupply dumps, artillery positions, and reserve forces immediately to\r\nthe rear of the Chinese MLR. As the admiral reasoned, the enemy could\r\nnot fight the kind of war he was waging “and still have _all_ his\r\nforces, supplies, and equipment underground. _Some_ of his stocks of\r\nsupplies had to be above ground, out of sight and out of range of our\r\nartillery.”[305]\r\n\r\n    [305] Quoted in Cagle and Manson, _Sea War, Korea_, p. 461.\r\n\r\nEighth Army welcomed the increased support that would result from\r\nthe strikes, but FEAF expressed concern about the lack of top-level\r\ncoordination. Admiral Clark had proposed that a EUSAK corps commander\r\nbe allowed to authorize the attacks, which employed 24 to 36 aircraft.\r\nThe Fifth Air Force initially maintained that it should control\r\nCherokee strikes, just as it did the CAS missions. The matter was\r\nfinally resolved in November.\r\n\r\nFollowing a high-level conference it was decided that attacks inside\r\nthe bombline would be subjected to FAF coordination and that a minimal\r\namount of tactical control would be exercised by the corps commander.\r\nEighth Army gave a big assist to the Navy by moving the bombline to\r\nwithin 3,000 meters (nearly two miles) of the outpost line. A line was\r\nalso drawn approximately 25 miles beyond the bombline, separating the\r\narea of “general support” from “interdiction.” Thereafter, the Cherokee\r\nstrikes were effectively conducted against enemy installations outside\r\nthe 3,000-meter line but within 20,000 meters of the ground front.\r\nGeneral Clark, CinCUNC, had high praise for the strikes, which the\r\nSeventh Fleet employed until the end of the war.\r\n\r\nSurface ships of the fleet were in much the same static warfare\r\nsituation as the ground and air components of the United Nations\r\nCommand. Aside from the Kojo demonstration in mid-October, the\r\nfleet had little diversification in its daily routine other than\r\nto maintain the siege around Wonsan. This operation had started in\r\nmid-February 1951 and had grown from the original plan to seize certain\r\nstrategically-placed islands on both coasts into an attempt to isolate\r\nthe entire port and city of Wonsan. Each day Allied minesweepers\r\ncleared the harbor; at night the enemy sampan fleet resowed the fields.\r\nDaily, usually during mine-clearing operations, ships of Task Force\r\n95 fired on batteries in the mountains beyond the city and at other\r\nmilitary targets in and around Wonsan. From time to time heavy units\r\nof the Seventh Fleet bombarded the area to keep the enemy off-balance\r\nand to partially deter the solid buildup of Communist arms and defenses\r\njust north of the 39th Parallel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Events on the Diplomatic Front_[306]\r\n\r\n    [306] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdD, Dec 52; Berger, _Korea\r\n          Knot_; Clark, _Danube to Yalu_; Hermes, _Truce Tent_;\r\n          Robert Leckie, _Conflict--The History of the Korean\r\n          War, 1950–1953_ (New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1962),\r\n          hereafter Leckie, _Conflict_; Rees, _Korea_.\r\n\r\nFor many of the UNC military personnel, the stalemated combat situation\r\nin Korea had become a depressing, no-win daily routine by the end of\r\n1952. Back in the States, the Korean War was not only unpopular and\r\nill-supported, but the slow progress of the conflict had also dulled\r\npublic interest. In the course of the Presidential election campaign\r\nthe question of Korea had become increasingly a matter of widespread\r\nnational concern. Two weeks before election day the Republican\r\ncandidate, former General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower,[307] had\r\nvowed to bring the Korean fighting to an end. As a first step toward\r\naccomplishing this he had pledged, if elected, to visit the battlefront.\r\n\r\n    [307] Eisenhower had resigned his commission, following his\r\n          return to the States in April to seek election.\r\n\r\nSome had labeled Eisenhower’s statement, “I will go to Korea” as a mere\r\npre-election gesture. The general intended to act on this pledge and,\r\nfollowing his election, began a four-day visit to Korea on 2 December\r\n1952. Part of the President-elect’s brief tour in Korea was spent\r\nat General Pollock’s command post. Here, on 3 December, the Marine\r\nground chief briefed his future Commander in Chief on current Marine\r\ndivision operations. Generals Clark, Van Fleet, and Kendall accompanied\r\nEisenhower and his party. This included General of the Army Omar\r\nBradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as Charles E.\r\nWilson and Herbert Brownell, Jr., the new designates for Secretary of\r\nDefense and Attorney General, respectively.\r\n\r\nThough General Eisenhower’s promise to visit Korea personally to see\r\nthe situation first-hand and his subsequent election had renewed\r\nAmerican hopes for an early peace in Korea, negotiations there had been\r\ndeadlocked since 1951 on the exchange of prisoners. Disagreement on\r\nthis issue thus became the major obstacle which was not overcome until\r\nthe truce was signed nearly 20 months later. The Communists insisted on\r\nrepatriation to their native land of all NKPA and CCF prisoners held\r\nby the United Nations Command. More than 60,000 of the 132,000 enemy\r\ncaptives held by the UNC in South Korean POW camps did not wish to\r\nreturn to Communism, a fact which had been borne out by a UN survey.\r\n\r\nTo draw attention from this unpopular position the Communists, through\r\nthe civil and military links existing in the POW camps, had staged a\r\nseries of riots in the spring of 1952. The worst, at Koje Island (just\r\noff the coast of Pusan) lasted six days, largely because the Communist\r\nprisoners planned for, and successfully carried out, the capture of the\r\nUN camp commander. His release, on 12 May, was effected only after the\r\nnew commander signed, under duress, a statement which the Communists\r\nimmediately exploited in an effort to discredit the validity of the\r\nprisoner survey.\r\n\r\nThe propaganda gains had enabled the Communists to occupy a commanding\r\nposition at the truce talks. In the meantime, the UN had offered\r\nseveral plans until, on 28 April, Admiral Joy presented “what we called\r\nour final package proposal.”[308] By instituting the tactic of calling\r\na recess whenever the Communists had nothing constructive to offer, a\r\nrecommendation of Admiral Joy’s, the UN regained the advantage of the\r\nconference table. The talks continued but with no appreciable progress.\r\nOn 8 October 1952, after continued Communist intransigence, Brigadier\r\nGeneral William K. Harrison, who had become the senior UN delegate\r\nin late May, took the initiative in recessing the truce talks. This\r\nunexpected action, which caught the enemy off-guard, followed three\r\nseparate proposals made by Harrison for ending the POW controversy.\r\nAll had been promptly rejected by the Communist delegation. As General\r\nHarrison had informed one of its spokesmen, the North Korean General\r\nNam Il:\r\n\r\n    [308] Joy, _Truce Negotiations_, p. 156. The proposal was a\r\n          “complete armistice agreement,” not merely another offer\r\n          to solve the prisoner question.\r\n\r\n  We are not terminating the armistice negotiations, we are merely\r\n  recessing them. We are willing to meet with you at any time\r\n  that you are ready to accept one of our proposals or to make a\r\n  constructive proposal of your own, in writing, which could lead\r\n  to an honorable armistice ... Since you have offered nothing\r\n  constructive, we stand in recess.[309]\r\n\r\n    [309] Quoted in Berger, _Korea Knot_, p. 153.\r\n\r\nAfter October, while the truce negotiations were in a period of\r\nindefinite recess, liaison officers at Panmunjom kept the channels\r\nof communication open between the Communist and UNC sides. Several\r\ndevelopments along other diplomatic lines about this time were to prove\r\nmore fruitful and lead the way to solution of the POW dispute and, in\r\nfact, to the end of the war.\r\n\r\nIn mid-November, an attempt was made to end the prisoner exchange\r\nimpasse through a resolution introduced by India at the United Nations\r\nsession. The compromise measure recognized the United States position,\r\nnamely, that force should not be used in returning prisoners to\r\ntheir homeland. This principle was to become known as the concept of\r\nvoluntary repatriation.\r\n\r\nTo reconcile the widely conflicting Communist and UNC views on\r\nhandling of prisoners, the Indian proposal suggested that a\r\nrepatriation commission be established. This body was to be composed\r\nof representatives of two Communist and two Allied nations. It would\r\nfunction within a designated demilitarized zone in Korea through which\r\nall prisoners would be received and processed. Each prisoner was to be\r\ngiven a choice of being returned to his homeland or not. Both sides\r\nwould have the opportunity of explaining to reluctant nationals “their\r\nrights” of repatriation. If these persuasive efforts failed and a man\r\nstill chose not to return to his country, he would then be referred to\r\na special political conference established by the armistice agreement.\r\n\r\nShould this four-member repatriation commission still not agree on\r\nsettlement of the nonrepatriates, a final determination was then to be\r\nmade by an official named by the commission or UN General Assembly.\r\nMany UNC nations favored the Indian proposal. U.S. official reaction\r\nwas frankly skeptical and critical, well aware that the many vague\r\naspects of the proposal could easily be exploited by the Communists to\r\nthe disadvantage of the individual POW. Despite the promise of a good\r\nmany headaches in its implementation, the UN adopted the compromise\r\nIndian resolution in December 1952 by a vote of 54 to 5.\r\n\r\nLater that same month the Executive Committee of the League of Red\r\nCross Societies, meeting in Geneva, adopted another feature of the\r\nIndian resolution proposing an exchange of sick and wounded POWs in\r\nadvance of a truce. As General Clark observed, “It was hardly an\r\nauspicious omen for an armistice, yet it was the action which set in\r\nmotion a chain of events which finally resulted in cease-fire.”[310]\r\n\r\n    [310] Clark, _Danube to Yalu_, p. 240.\r\n\r\nOn another front, State Department officials advised the Joint\r\nChiefs of Staff that a resolution similar to that of the Red Cross\r\nwould probably be introduced when the UN reconvened on 24 February.\r\nFollowing a JCS suggestion that a “feeler” proposition be first made\r\nto the Communists, General Clark wrote the NKPA and CCF leaders on\r\n22 February. His letter was addressed to North Korean Premier Kim Il\r\nSung and General Peng Teh-huai, the CCF military commander. Delivered\r\nthrough the Panmunjom liaison officers, it requested the immediate\r\nexchange of sick and wounded POWs. As both diplomatic and military\r\nleaders doubtfully awaited the results, a totally unexpected and\r\nfar-reaching event, the death of the Russian leader, Premier Joseph\r\nStalin, jolted the Communist world. Its repercussions soon extended to\r\nthe truce tent at Panmunjom and decisively affected the progress of\r\nnegotiations there.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Marine Commands During the Third Winter_[311]\r\n\r\n    [311] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdDs, Nov 52-Jan 53; 1stMar\r\n          ComdDs, Nov 52-Feb 53; 5thMar ComdD, Dec 52; 7thMar\r\n          ComdDs, Nov 52, Jan 53; 11th Mar ComdDs, Jan-Feb 53; 2/1\r\n          ComdD, Nov 52; 1st MAW ComdD, Jan 53; MAG-12 ComdD, Jan\r\n          53; MAG-33 ComdD, Oct 52; MACG-2 ComdD, Feb 53.\r\n\r\nAlthough renewed negotiations to bring the war to a close were\r\nunder way with the enemy in late 1952 and early 1953, action on the\r\nbattlefield continued the tedious routine of the war. An exception\r\nto the general lethargy across the front occurred on 22 November in\r\nthe right regimental sector. A predawn raid was conducted by the 1st\r\nMarines, which had advanced to the front upon relief of the 7th Marines\r\nafter their battle of the Hook. With the left and right battalion\r\nsectors manned by 1/1 and 3/1, respectively, Lieutenant Colonel Charles\r\nE. Warren’s 2/1, in regimental reserve, had been ordered to provide\r\na company to raid Chinese positions across from COPs Reno and Vegas.\r\nDrawing the assignment was Company D (Captain Jay V. Poage).\r\n\r\nCode-named WAKEUP, the raid was conducted in a manner typical of many\r\nearlier forays against Chinese strongpoints. Its results, too, in most\r\nrespects were similar to the outcome of previous raids. Artillery\r\npreparation of the objective area was accomplished, the infantry\r\nassaults were somewhat short of the targets due to heavy CCF defensive\r\nfires, and the prisoner-taking part of the mission was unfulfilled.\r\nCounterbalancing this, and what made the raid of value to the regiment,\r\nwas the information gained about enemy defenses and Chinese reaction to\r\nthe raid. It was one of the rare occasions during which the CCF did not\r\nemploy artillery fire while their positions were under attack, using\r\ninstead mortars and automatic weapons against Marine assault forces.\r\n\r\nRaids such as WAKEUP, patrols, and ambushes became the pattern of\r\naction in late November and in December. Earlier in November some\r\nchanges in the MLR dispositions had taken place. On 3 November,\r\nat 2345, the 1st Battalion of the Black Watch, 29th Infantry\r\nBrigade, 1st Commonwealth Division, had relieved 1/7 of the Hook\r\nsector responsibility, ending Marine occupation of that part of\r\nJAMESTOWN.[312] And, on 16 November, the 7th Marines itself had been\r\nreplaced in line by the 1st Marines. In between these changes of\r\ncommand on the frontlines, Generals Pollock and Jerome had received\r\nmany congratulations and well wishes from combat commands and from\r\ngovernment officials in the States. The occasion was the 177th birthday\r\nof the Marine Corps. Both of these senior commanders passed on to their\r\nMarines not only the Commandant’s Anniversary message but also the\r\ncongratulations of the UNC commander, General Clark.\r\n\r\n    [312] At this time a new limiting point between the division\r\n          and British division was also established. This slightly\r\n          reduced Marine division frontage to 33 miles and allowed\r\n          the two MLR regiments to shorten their lines and maintain\r\n          somewhat larger reserve units. _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5,\r\n          Chap. 8, p. 8-23.\r\n\r\nThough the Commonwealth division had taken over the Hook area from\r\nthe infantry Marines, the division’s participation in defense of\r\nthe British sector had not completely ended. On 18–19 November,\r\nthe 11th Marines expended more than 2,000 rounds to repel Chinese\r\nattacks on the Hook. This firing by the artillery regiment helped to\r\nrepay the British for their “cooperation and outstanding artillery\r\nand tank support during the engagements of 26–28 October....”[313]\r\nAnd as the Commonwealth division commander, Major General M. M.\r\nAustin-Roberts-West, had himself reported to General Pollock the day\r\nfollowing the Hook attack, “All hands on the Hook much appreciated the\r\nprompt and effective support given last night. Grateful if you would\r\npass on their thanks to all concerned.”[314]\r\n\r\n    [313] CG, 1stMarDiv msg to GOC, 1stComWelDiv, dtd 29 Oct 52, in\r\n          1stMarDiv ComdD, Oct 52, App. II, p. 6.\r\n\r\n    [314] GOC, 1stComWelDiv msg to CG, 1stMarDiv, dtd 19 Nov 52, in\r\n          1stMarDiv ComdD, Nov 52, App. I, p. 3.\r\n\r\nThroughout December 1952 and January 1953, the lull in ground fighting\r\ncontinued. Mass Cherokee strikes by Admiral Clark’s Navy and Marine\r\nfliers had begun for the Marine division on 17 December, when the\r\nbombline was moved in nearer to the MLR for expanded operations. In\r\nnoncombat activities, later that month Francis Cardinal Spellman,\r\nArchbishop of New York and Vicar for Catholic Chaplains of the Armed\r\nForces, conducted a Christmas Mass at the division CP. On the 31st,\r\nHis Eminence visited the 1st MAW at K-3 (Pohang). There he delivered\r\nan address to about 1,000 Marines, shook hands with nearly all of\r\nthem, and later heard confessions for many. Another special guest, not\r\nlong afterward, was Episcopal Bishop Austin Pardue, of the Pittsburgh\r\nDiocese, who held Holy Communion at the division chapel.\r\n\r\nThe passing of 1952 and the arrival of the new year was not marked by\r\nany special observance on the battlefield. For that matter there was,\r\nit seemed, no change to note; the Marines, like the rest of the Eighth\r\nArmy troops, maintained much the same regular, reduced, wintertime\r\nschedule. Activity of Marine infantry units consisted of aggressive\r\npatrolling and raids, and improvement of the secondary defenses of\r\nLines WYOMING and KANSAS. Units in division reserve, during January,\r\nalso participated in MARLEX (Marine Landing Exercise) operations.\r\n\r\nNo major ground action had taken place in December, although Marine\r\npatrols, on a half dozen occasions, had engaged as many as 50 enemy\r\nfor brief clashes and fire fights. January was a different story,\r\nhowever. On 8 January, a 7th Marines raiding party, reinforced by\r\nair, artillery, and tank support, skirmished with 85 Chinese in the\r\nHill 134 area not far from COP 2, overlooking Panmunjom. Ten days\r\nlater, the 1st and 7th Marines, together with the artillery regiment,\r\ntook part in Operation BIMBO. This was another attempt, by combined\r\ninfantry-artillery-tank-air action, to create the impression that CCF\r\nobjective areas were under attack.\r\n\r\nBIMBO began with heavy preparatory fires by the 11th Marines, including\r\nthe 155mm projectiles hurled by 4/11, that inflicted early damage\r\nto CCF personnel and materiel. At 0630, on 18 January, frontline\r\nbattalions of the two participating infantry regiments opened\r\nfire; reserve battalions assisted with indirect machine gun fire.\r\nArmored vehicles added to the effect of the ruse by shelling Chinese\r\nemplacements from prepared MLR positions. Marine attack planes streaked\r\nin to unload flaming napalm. In response to the BIMBO mock attack, the\r\nChinese directed mortar fire into suspected Marine avenues of approach\r\nand assembly areas. Forward observers on JAMESTOWN could detect some\r\nenemy troop movement. (Marine artillery took these formations under\r\nintensive fire), but as in similar feint operations in the past,\r\nthe enemy again failed to pick up the bait. The operation lasted\r\napproximately an hour and a half.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months, a number of command changes had occurred in\r\nthe Marines’ combat organizations in Korea. In the 1st Marine Aircraft\r\nWing, the rotation of commanders began at the very top when, on 8\r\nJanuary, General Jerome handed over the wing colors to Major General\r\nVernon E. Megee. During a ceremony at wing headquarters that day, Air\r\nForce Generals Weyland and Barcus paid tribute to General Jerome’s\r\n“exceptionally meritorious service” as 1st MAW CG since April 1952 by\r\npresenting him with the Distinguished Service Medal.\r\n\r\nThe incoming wing commander, General Megee, had been a Marine flyer for\r\n20 years, having received his wings in 1932. His Marine Corps career\r\nbegan more than a decade earlier, with enlistment in 1919. Commissioned\r\nin 1922, he served in infantry, artillery, and expeditionary billets\r\nbefore undergoing pilot training in 1931. Following school, staff, and\r\ncommand assignments, Major Megee was named advisor to the Peruvian\r\nMinister of Aviation from 1940–1943. During World War II, Colonel Megee\r\nwas sent overseas as 3d MAW Chief of Staff in early 1944. As Commander,\r\nControl Unit One, he participated in the Iwo Jima campaign, earning\r\nthe Legion of Merit. Later, at Okinawa, he commanded all Marine Corps\r\nLanding Force Air Support Control Units. After promotion to brigadier\r\ngeneral in 1949, General Megee was named Chief of Staff, FMFLant.\r\nReceiving his second star in 1951, he served as Commanding General\r\nat Cherry Point, El Toro, and Air FMFPac prior to his assignment in\r\nKorea.[315]\r\n\r\n    [315] DivInfo, HQMC, Biography of LtGen Vernon E.

That month Marine pilots\r\nlogged their greatest number of sorties--3,897--since June 1951.[317]\r\nAs a result of the intense infantry action in the 1st Marine Division\r\nsector another air record was established--365 casualty evacuations\r\nby HMR-161 during October. This was a peak number to that time for\r\nthe helicopter transport squadron for which med evac was a secondary\r\nmission. These “mercy missions” were not limited only to wounded Marine\r\ninfantrymen or downed aviators.\r\n\r\n    [317] A total of 1,362 CAS sorties were flown, with 443\r\n          for the 1st Marine Division. Interdiction missions\r\n          numbered 1,842, plus additional miscellaneous and air\r\n          reconnaissance flights. 1st MAW ComdD, Oct. 52.\r\n\r\nWhenever and wherever immediate air rescue was needed, the choppers\r\nwere sent. In July 1952, HMR-161 evacuated “650 Army and Air Force\r\ntroops as well as 150 Koreans”[318] from a flooded river island. On the\r\nnight of 18 January 1953, a helicopter retrieved five Marines from an\r\nuncharted minefield after one of the group had accidentally stepped on\r\na mine. On 13 March, HMR-161 sent three helicopters aloft in an attempt\r\nto save five men from the 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion who had\r\nbecome trapped in mud near the edge of the Imjin, and later that month\r\nthe squadron dispatched a chopper to rescue a hunter marooned in the\r\nmiddle of the Han River.\r\n\r\n    [318] Montross, _SkyCav_, p. 189.\r\n\r\nAlmost obscured in the magnificent record of the mercy missions,\r\nespecially the hazardous casualty evacuations by the VMO-6 pilots, were\r\nthe problems encountered by the observation and helicopter squadrons.\r\nUnder operational control of the division and administrative control of\r\nthe wing, the squadrons found themselves exposed to overlapping command\r\nauthority which sometimes resulted in conflicting directives from\r\nhigher headquarters. Some squadron personnel felt that establishment\r\nof a helicopter group under the 1st MAW might have solved many of the\r\norganizational problems, but such a unit was never established in\r\nKorea, partly because only one helicopter squadron (plus half of the\r\nobservation squadron) existed.\r\n\r\nAnother organizational difficulty beset VMO-6. With two types of\r\naircraft and two unrelated missions (med evac for the HTL and HO5S\r\ncopters; observation and artillery spotting for its little OYs and,\r\nlater, OE-1s), the squadron found supply and maintenance problems\r\ndoubled and operational control of its rotary and fixed wing sections\r\nextremely complex. Attachment of the VMO-6 choppers (for evacuation,\r\nadministrative, and liaison missions) to HMR-161 was suggested as a\r\npossible solution to these difficulties, but was never done.\r\n\r\nOther problem areas became apparent during the winter of 1952–1953.\r\nAccompanying the freezing weather were difficulties in starting and,\r\nfor a brief time, in flying the helicopters. In order to overcome the\r\nengine starting problem on emergency evacuation missions, HMR-161\r\npreheated its number one standby aircraft every two hours during the\r\nextreme cold. Dilution of engine oil with gasoline and use of warming\r\nhuts (the latter, a scarcity) were also employed to cut down cold\r\nweather starting time.\r\n\r\nNot related to freezing Korean temperatures were two additional\r\nproblems, one navigational and the other mechanical. In January, the\r\nhelicopter squadron put into use a jeep-mounted homing device for\r\noperations in reduced visibility. It proved unsatisfactory due to\r\ninterference from other radio transmitters in the area, a difficulty\r\nnever resolved during the rest of the war. The mechanical problem\r\nlay with the rotary winged aircraft in HMR-161. On 27 March, all of\r\nits HRS-2 choppers with more than 200 hours on the main rotor blades\r\nwere grounded. Discovery in the States that minute .002-inch cuts on\r\nthe blade surface had occurred during fabrication resulted in the\r\ngrounding. New blades were promptly flown to Korea from both Japan and\r\nthe United States, and the squadron again became fully operational on 2\r\nApril.\r\n\r\nEvaluation of transport helicopter techniques continued during the\r\nperiod despite ever-present minor difficulties. At least one new\r\nHMR-161 tactical maneuver was scheduled each month to evaluate existing\r\nprocedures and determine full operational capabilities of the aircraft.\r\nDuring these landing exercises both the infantry and helicopter\r\ncommanders and their staffs had the opportunity to further develop\r\nvertical envelopment techniques that would soon be the new trademark of\r\nU.S. Marine Corps operations.\r\n\r\nMost of the time HMR-161 operations drew more attention than those of\r\nVMO-6, but pilots in the latter unit had a host of division Marines who\r\ncould attest to the skills and critical role performed by helicopter\r\nfliers in the composite observation squadron. VMO-6 had pioneered the\r\nnight casualty evacuation service, and during the active fighting in\r\nKorea, had flown out more than 1,000 Marines from frontline medical\r\nfacilities to better-equipped ones in the rear areas. These flights\r\nwere made in all kinds of weather and without the benefit of adequate\r\ninstrumentation or a homing device. No other Eighth Army helicopter\r\nunit made regularly scheduled night frontline evacuations.[319]\r\n\r\n    [319] A relatively small number of night med evac flights was\r\n          also being flown by HMR-161. During March 1953, for\r\n          example, in transferring 283 casualties to the hospital\r\n          ships, squadron helicopters made only 15 flights at night.\r\n\r\nThe courage of these VMO-6 pilots was recalled nearly 15 years later by\r\na former executive officer of the 1st Marines:\r\n\r\n  The flying of the evacuation helicopters from the jury-rigged\r\n  and inadequate landing sites was nothing short of miraculous.\r\n  I’ve always contended those pilots of the observation squadron\r\n  received far less credit than they deserved. They used to fly\r\n  at night, to frontline landing strips, where I had difficulty\r\n  walking without barking my shins.[320]\r\n\r\n    [320] Col Glenn R. Long ltr to Hd, HistBr, G-3 Div, HQMC, dtd\r\n          11 Jun 67.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of 1952 and the first months of 1953, 1st\r\nMarine Aircraft Wing command relationships underwent a significant\r\nchange. On 26 January 1953, General Megee forwarded a memorandum\r\nrequest to General Barcus. The paper outlined specific recommendations\r\nfor restoring 1st MAW tactical elements to wing operational control,\r\neven though the Marine wing would continue as a tactical component\r\nof Fifth Air Force. In the proposal, CG, 1st MAW pointed out (as had\r\nhis predecessors) that the existing command structure, in effect,\r\ncompletely bypassed the Marine wing commander. It had prevented him\r\nfrom exercising normal tactical command functions, even though he was\r\nfully responsible for the performance of his air groups and squadrons\r\nto FEAF/FAF orders. The 1st MAW commander’s proposal was intended\r\nto counter previous Air Force objections and demonstrate that more\r\nnormal command relations would “enhance, rather than reduce [1st MAW]\r\noperational efficiency and effectiveness.”[321]\r\n\r\n    [321] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, p. 10-76.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, having been informally advised in an earlier\r\nconversation that CG, FAF would approve at least some of the requests\r\nmade, General Megee implemented changes in his G-2 and G-3 staff\r\nsections. This reorganization was aimed at carrying out the increased\r\nfunctions which would result from approval of the request. Operational\r\ncontrol of Marine tactical squadrons by FAF since 1951 had “relegated\r\n1st MAW to the status of an administrative headquarters, forcing its\r\nG-2 and G-3 sections partially to atrophy.”[322] To effect the changes\r\nin command relationships and establish the wing on an operational\r\nbasis, the G-2 and G-3 sections were expanded. By the nature of\r\ntheir organization these were not capable of either targeting or\r\ntactical planning. In the intelligence section, a Target Information\r\nSub-section was established to compile data on the mission targets (and\r\naccompanying photographs) received from FAF and to evaluate the desired\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\n    [322] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of this information, the G-3 planning group accomplished\r\nthe target solution, prepared general tactics for conducting the\r\nstrike, (number of planes, amount and kind of ordnance, approach routes\r\nto be used) and provided post-strike target evaluation. The chiefs\r\nof these sections jointly presented the completed information to the\r\nwing commander each afternoon. He selected the targets and forwarded\r\nvia teletype and air courier to the wing G-3 representative at FAF\r\nheadquarters a report of intended operations, providing a lead time of\r\n36–48 hours.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the OP INTENT (Operations Intentions Report) was on its way\r\nto General Barcus for approval, the 1st MAW intelligence section began\r\nto prepare the target dossiers (including photographs, flak analysis,\r\nand related identification information) on each of the approved\r\ntargets. The compiled dossiers were then sent to the appropriate\r\ntactical squadron. At this point, still perhaps a half-day before\r\nissuance of the FAF orders, the squadrons received two major advantages\r\nover the previous system:\r\n\r\n  (1) Adequate photo intelligence employed for the first time since\r\n  FAF had assumed operational control of 1st MAW; and\r\n\r\n  (2) A substantial lead time advantage for proper briefing of\r\n  pilots and arming of aircraft.\r\n\r\nAfter the strike, and usually within an hour, Marine planes\r\nphotographed the targets for damage assessment. These photos were\r\nannotated and an assessment report prepared. This information was\r\nthen presented by the G-2 and G-3 to the wing commander. Immediately\r\nthereafter, prints of the photographs were distributed to the\r\nappropriate tactical units, thus making post-strike photography more\r\nfreely available on a regular basis to the participating tactical units.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated 18 February, General Barcus approved most of the\r\n1st MAW commander’s specific requests, but retained full control over\r\nGeneral Megee’s squadrons used in close air support. This was due to\r\nthe fact that EUSAK-FAF joint policy required CAS mission requests to\r\nbe approved by JOC, in accordance with daily Eighth Army priorities,\r\nwhich allocated the aircraft for each request. Returned to operational\r\ncontrol of the Marine wing were planes used on interdiction, armed\r\nreconnaissance and general support activities--the planes on strikes\r\nbeyond the bombline, the photo, and all-weather (night) squadrons.\r\nFAF also retained control over assignment of missions to VMC-1, the\r\nelectronics unit.\r\n\r\nAlthough some of the Marine wing tactical squadrons thus newly enjoyed\r\nthe advantages of flying under their own commander’s wings, 1st MAW\r\nheadquarters staff members had to pay for these benefits. An increased\r\nwork load swamped the G-2 section, where 7 photo interpreters were\r\nkept busy 16 hours a day, 7 days a week. Marine personnel processed\r\nand reviewed an average of 100,000 prints per month and these were\r\n“only those from that portion of the VMJ-1 effort devoted to 1st\r\nMAW operations.”[323] Expansion of 1st MAW headquarters to set up\r\na tactical planning capability pointed to a deficiency in the wing\r\norganization T/O, a weakness that existed during the rest of the war.\r\n\r\n    [323] _Ibid._, p. 10-80.\r\n\r\nWhile General Barcus earlier had General Megee’s recommendations\r\nunder study, a radio news broadcast back in the States momentarily\r\nresulted in poor publicity for the Marine Corps. On 1 February a\r\nnationally syndicated columnist reported instances in which friendly\r\ntroops had been bombed and strafed by U.S. aircraft. Marine Corps\r\nplanes were the most careless, the broadcaster alleged, basing his\r\nstatement on incomplete information. The news story had developed from\r\nan unfortunate publicity release issued by FEAF dealing with a MAG-33\r\nincident. The phrasing implied that Marine aviators were “guilty of\r\ngross carelessness resulting in casualties among their own ground\r\ntroops.”[324]\r\n\r\n    [324] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, p. 9-81.\r\n\r\nActually, of the 63 incidents in which friendly casualties had resulted\r\nfrom aircraft flown by FAF units between January and October 1952,\r\n1st MAW pilots were responsible for 18, or 28.5 percent of the total\r\nnumber of incidents and majority of casualties. What was left unsaid,\r\nhowever, in the unfavorable publicity was that with approximately 14.5\r\npercent of the aircraft represented in FEAF, Marine fliers had been\r\naccomplishing monthly totals of between 30 to 40 percent of all Eighth\r\nArmy CAS missions. They also performed virtually all of the very close\r\nair support jobs (50 to 100 yards out from the MLR) which further\r\nreduced the comparative percentage of Marine “carelessness.”\r\n\r\nIt was true, of course, that on rare occasions freak accidents did\r\nkill and injure UN troops, despite the continual training of pilots\r\nand controllers in strike procedures and target identification. The\r\nposition taken by the two senior Marine commanders in Korea was\r\nthat although any CAS incident involving friendly troops was highly\r\nregrettable, it was in the same category as “short” mortar and\r\nartillery rounds and just as unavoidable.\r\n\r\nTarget identification, low visibility flying conditions, and ballistic\r\ncomputations made the task of precision close air support an enormous\r\none. If anything, it was almost a wonder that more accidents did\r\nnot happen. Despite the similarity of Korean geography, an unending\r\npanorama of almost identical hilltops, ridges, and streams, the pilot\r\nhad to release ordnance at the proper altitude and speed, and in a\r\nbalanced (trim) flight. While conducting his dive the pilot’s view\r\ncould be blocked by cloud formations and his attention distracted by\r\nantiaircraft fire which required evasive action. Even when the ordnance\r\nhad been properly released, prevailing wind conditions could affect\r\nthe flight path of the bombs. This, in addition to human error and\r\nmechanical factors, such as the occasional malfunctioning of parts,\r\nalso affected the accuracy of bombing.\r\n\r\nThroughout the November 1952-March 1953 period, 1st MAW squadrons\r\ncontinued to provide the bulk of close air sorties to the 1st Marine\r\nDivision, in keeping with General Barcus’ policy stated earlier in\r\n1952. Between November and January there had been a lull in the heavy\r\nground fighting that had prevailed in October and little need to\r\nrequest air strikes. When enemy forces opposing the division began to\r\ngrow more active in February, however, the requirement for air support\r\nto 1st MarDiv greatly increased. During this month 1st MAW aviators\r\nreached an all-time high in the percentage of their total CAS sorties\r\ndevoted to the division--two of every three wing close support sorties\r\nwent to General Pollock’s infantry regiments.\r\n\r\nOn the critical issue of close air support, the Marine division had\r\nbecome better satisfied by the end of 1952 with the quantity of air\r\nsupport received from FAF. A continuing difficulty, however, was the\r\ndelayed response to requests for immediate CAS. For the wing, several\r\nother conditions existed which bothered General Megee. One was that the\r\nVMA-312 carrier-based squadron was not utilized to any great extent\r\nin execution of CAS missions. This detrimental condition saddled the\r\nwing commander with an “unqualified” squadron. It also prevented pilots\r\nfrom practicing a highly developed skill they were responsible for\r\nmaintaining, although later in the war this condition was gradually\r\nalleviated. Two other difficulties--centralized control of CAS\r\nmission assignments by JOC and the prevailing differences between\r\nthe Marine and Air Force/Army CAS communications systems and request\r\nprocedures--were never rectified.[325]\r\n\r\n    [325] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, p. 10-80.\r\n\r\nOne long-standing difficulty, though not a CAS matter, had been solved\r\nearly in the winter. Following a series of mechanical troubles with the\r\nF3D-2 aircraft in VMF(N)-513 and prolonged delay in receipt of blast\r\ntube extensions for its 20mm guns, the squadron finally became fully\r\noperational on 1 November with its complement of 12 of the new jet\r\nSkyknight aircraft. Almost as soon as the F3D-2s were ready for night\r\nwork, FEAF had put them to escorting B-29s on bombing runs over North\r\nKorea. With the F3D escort and changes in B-29 tactics, bomber losses,\r\nwhich had been severe, decreased sharply. Enemy attackers became fewer\r\nand fewer so that by February, air-to-air opposition was encountered\r\nonly infrequently. Instead of sending up groups of night fighters at\r\nthe escorted B-29s, the enemy would fly a single jet across the bomber\r\nformation. If a Skyknight followed, one or two MIG-15s, well to the\r\nrear and higher than the decoy, would attempt to gun down the Skyknight\r\nin its pursuit. But because of the F3D tail warning radar, the Marine\r\nradar operator could detect the enemy plane in its approach for the\r\nkill before it got within effective firing range.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Colonel Hutchinson’s VMF(N)-513 pilots soon established\r\nan enviable record for Marine aviation, netting by 31 January five\r\nenemy jets without loss of a single F3D. In addition to the jets, the\r\nsquadron downed a piston engine plane and scored a probable destruct on\r\nanother. During its first three months of operations with the Douglas\r\nSkyknights--the first Navy-Marine jet night-fighter to arrive in the\r\nKorean combat theater--the squadron earned two night-kill records. It\r\nalso quickly proved the design theory and proposed tactics for the\r\nSkyknights that enemy aircraft could be located, intercepted, and\r\ndestroyed purely by electronic means.\r\n\r\nWhile on a night combat air patrol in the vicinity of Sinuiju airfield\r\nearly on 3 November, Master Sergeant H. C. Hoglind picked up a contact\r\non his intercept radar, which a ground radar station had passed on\r\nto him, and notified the pilot, Major William T. Stratton, Jr. After\r\nlosing and reestablishing radar contact, Major Stratton made a visual\r\nsighting of a jet exhaust straight ahead. When he had been cleared to\r\nproceed, the Flying Nightmare’s pilot sent three bursts of 20mm into\r\nthe other plane, identified as a YAK-15. Three explosions followed and\r\nthe aircraft plunged towards the airfield directly below. This marked\r\nthe first time that an enemy jet had been destroyed at night by use of\r\nairborne intercept radar equipment in a jet fighter.\r\n\r\nFive days later the team of Captain Oliver R. Davis and Warrant Officer\r\nDramus F. Fessler bagged the first MIG-15 for the squadron. Captain\r\nDavis expended only 20 rounds of 20mm cannon fire in his aerial\r\nvictory, which took place northwest of Pyongyang near the Yellow Sea.\r\n\r\nThe next two months brought new distinction to Marines in -513. Shortly\r\nafter dark on 10 December, First Lieutenant Joseph A. Corvi had\r\ndeparted on a night combat patrol mission. About 35 miles northwest of\r\nChinnampo, his radar operator, Master Sergeant D. R. George, picked up\r\na target on his scope. Since the “bogey” (an unidentified aircraft,\r\nbelieved to be hostile) was three miles distant, the pilot quickly\r\nclosed on the contact and shot it down. Almost immediately another\r\nblip appeared on the radar screen. Lieutenant Corvi turned to the new\r\nattack and began approaching it, but because of the slower speed of\r\nthe enemy plane the Marine pilot was able to fire only one short burst\r\nbefore overtaking it. An instant before passing the enemy aircraft,\r\nLieutenant Corvi saw it disappear from the radar screen, but neither\r\nmember of the Flying Nightmares crew had made a visual sighting with\r\nthe plane itself, listed as a probable kill. What these two Marines\r\nhad accomplished with their earlier encounter was the first attempt to\r\ndestroy an enemy aircraft without use of a visual sighting by means of\r\nlock-on radar gear.\r\n\r\nAll-weather squadron crews continued to demonstrate the F3D-2\r\ncapability for destruction of hostile aircraft by electronic intercept\r\nduring January. The first MIG-15 downed was by Major Elswin P. (Jack)\r\nDunn and Master Sergeant Lawrence J. Fortin, his radar operator. On 28\r\nJanuary Captain James R. Weaver and Master Sergeant Robert P. Becker\r\ndestroyed another of the Russian fighter-interceptors in an aerial\r\nduel. The final kill came on the 31st when the new squadron commander,\r\nLieutenant Colonel Robert F. Conley (who had taken over VMF(N)-513 on\r\nthe 20th) accompanied by Master Sergeant James M. Scott bagged the\r\nMarine fighter pilots’ 12th MIG of the war.\r\n\r\nWhile VMF(N)-513 wrote several records in the sky, other MAG-33 and\r\n-12 squadrons also made their contribution during the winter of\r\n1952–1953. In MAG-12, a highly successful noontime strike was launched\r\non 16 November by 21 attack planes from VMAs-121 and -212 against a\r\nhydroelectric plant 25 miles southeast of Wonsan. For this exploit the\r\ngroup received the plaudits of the Fifth Air Force CG, General Barcus.\r\nLieutenant Colonel John B. Maas, Jr.’s VMF-115 (he had succeeded\r\nLieutenant Colonel Coin as CO on 29 September) helped all Marines\r\ncelebrate their 177th birthday by sending 22 Panthers against enemy\r\ntroops and supply shelters. On these strikes each MAG-33 aircraft\r\nwas armed with 760 rounds of 20mm and 4 napalm tanks (500 pounds\r\neach), the first time that 4 tanks that large had been dropped from\r\na fighter-bomber. This was part of the 98 sorties flown by 1st MAW\r\nagainst 21 enemy targets on the 10 November anniversary date. During\r\nDecember 1952, the frequency of combat flights by VMF-115 enabled the\r\nsquadron to surpass its old (August 1951) monthly sortie record. The\r\nPanther jet fliers set this new mark of 726 effective sorties in the\r\nlast 31 days of the year.\r\n\r\nMore honors came to wing pilots in the new year. On 8 January, three\r\nMAG-12 squadrons flew more than 28 combat sorties. Some, in support\r\nof the 1st Marine Division near the Panmunjom corridor, by VMAs-121,\r\n-212, and -323, produced outstanding results, earning the praise of\r\nGeneral Pollock. Among the participating pilots was Lieutenant Colonel\r\nBarnett Robinson (VMA-212), who a week earlier had taken command of the\r\nsquadron from Lieutenant Colonel Dobson.\r\n\r\nBetween 9–14 January, MAG-33 participated in a USAF-USMC joint\r\noperation to strike the rail system at Sinanju, 45 miles north of\r\nthe enemy capital, and at Yongmi-dong, to the northwest across both\r\nthe Chongchon and Taedong Rivers. During the six-day Operation\r\nPARALYSIS, Marine and Air Force jet squadrons flew flak suppression and\r\ninterdiction missions, knocking out ground-based air defense weapons\r\nand damaging and destroying bridges, rails, and rolling stock. At night\r\nFEAF Bomber Command, with Flying Nightmare escorts, worked over the\r\ncommunications net, including repair facilities; during daylight, the\r\nfighter-bombers attacked marshalling yards near Sinanju, where railroad\r\ncars were stacked up awaiting repair of the river bridges. Bomb\r\nassessments and intelligence reports showed that two major rail lines\r\nwere inoperative for 16 days and that, as General Barcus had predicted,\r\nthe Chinese “hurriedly increased their antiaircraft defenses in the\r\nChongchon estuary and shot down seven fighter-bombers.”[326]\r\n\r\n    [326] Futrell, _USAF, Korea_, p. 582.\r\n\r\nFollowing this operation, Colonel Robertshaw’s jets from VMFs-115 and\r\n-311 achieved extremely effective close air support in strikes flown\r\n24 January in the I Corps area. About a month later, with an F9F as\r\nan airborne command post and with Lieutenant Colonel Walt Bartosh on\r\nhis wing, the MAG-33 commander directed the operations of 208 USAF and\r\nMarine aircraft on another mass strike. The two-day mission was flown\r\non 18–19 February against the North Korean tank and infantry school\r\nsouthwest of Pyongyang. More than 240 buildings were destroyed in 379\r\nsorties. The attack was one of the largest all-jet fighter-bomber\r\nstrikes of the war. Colonel Robertshaw thereby became the first Marine\r\nto lead such a large joint air-strike force from a CP aloft. And the\r\nnext month, on 8 March, the Group CO flew the first Marine jet night\r\nMPQ mission, dropping six 250-pound bombs from an F9F-2 Panther on an\r\nenemy ammunition dump.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Behind the Lines_[327]\r\n\r\n    [327] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpts_ No. 5, Chaps. 8, 9, No.\r\n          6, Chaps. 9, 10; 1stMarDiv ComdDs. Jan-Feb 53; 1/1 ComdD,\r\n          Feb 53; HMR-161 ComdD, Feb 53; Montross, _SkyCav_.\r\n\r\nThe Marine aviation command, like the division, found that its\r\ncommitment to a large-scale land campaign in Korea considerably\r\nincreased its requirements for nonorganic support, compared with\r\nnormal amphibious combat operations. The wing fell heir to more of the\r\npermanent problems because its organization was less suited to the\r\nheavy support requirements of prolonged combat. Whereas the 1st Marine\r\nDivision received adequate support through the FMFPac Service Command,\r\nthe wing did not since the service command had been tailored more\r\nfor support of ground organizations. Moreover, the command relations\r\nestablished in Korea underscored this situation, with the 1st Combat\r\nService Group placed under CG, 1st Marine Division. The wing received\r\nemergency logistical support from VMR (Marine transport squadron)\r\nunits. This was not an adequate substitute for the various ground\r\nsupport agencies essential for employment of the wing’s full combat\r\npotential.\r\n\r\nMajor problems pertaining to service and support functions of 1st\r\nMAW units resulted from the use of amphibious Tables of Organization\r\nthroughout the period of prolonged land combat without making a T/O\r\nadjustment for the actual combat mission being performed. What the\r\nwing had recommended to solve its longstanding support and supply\r\nproblems was either to strengthen its organic logistical structure\r\nor to increase it by the attachment of appropriate units. It was\r\nemphasized that “prolonged Wing operations under Air Force control with\r\nlogistical support derived from four different services, each at the\r\nend of its supply pipeline, brought clearly into focus the requirement\r\nfor centralized control and monitoring of Wing requisitions and\r\nsupplies.”[328]\r\n\r\n    [328] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, p. 10-133.\r\n\r\nA step toward expanding the amphibious T/O of the wing was made in 1953\r\nwith the request from CG, 1st MAW to CG, FMFPac for a detachment of the\r\n1st Combat Service Group to provide electronics logistical support. It\r\nwas further recommended that the electronics section be made organic to\r\nthe wing to meet its need for this type of service unit.\r\n\r\nUnlike the division, existing T/Os made it impossible for the wing to\r\nconsolidate and control resupply requests from subordinate units and\r\nthen to monitor the requisitions until parts or supplies were received\r\nby the users. This lack of a central wing supply agency had, for some\r\ntime, impaired the effective, sustained performance of 1st MAW ground\r\nelectronics equipment in Korea. CG, FMFPac concurred with the proposal.\r\nHe requested an increase in the wing T/O of four additional electronics\r\nsupply personnel to be attached to the wing for this purpose. The basic\r\nproblem of establishment of a combat service group tailored to fully\r\nmeet 1st MAW needs in the field remained unresolved, however.\r\n\r\nSupply problems in the division were less complicated. On 11 November\r\n1952, General Pollock submitted a letter to the theater commander\r\nrequesting approval of a special list of equipment in excess of\r\ncertain Tables of Organization and Equipment within the division. The\r\nrequirements of the Marine land war mission in Korea dictated the need\r\nfor additional equipment, primarily crew-served weapons and automatic\r\nrifles. Approval was given on 19 January 1953 by CG, AFFE (Army Forces,\r\nFar East). All equipment received through this program was to be\r\nreturned upon the departure of the Marine division from Korea.\r\n\r\nDuring the cold months that ended in March 1953, the division continued\r\nits evaluation of experimental clothing and equipment. Items of winter\r\nwear generally proved to be highly satisfactory. The thermal boot, in\r\nparticular, gave excellent service. On the other hand, the leather\r\ncombat boot did not fully measure up to expectations. Most of its\r\ndeficiencies were caused by the rapid wearing of the composition sole.\r\nOne clothing item, the armored vest, had undergone further testing. In\r\nNovember, delivery of the vests to the division had been completed,\r\nincluding 400 sets of the new lower torso armor. Recent issue of this\r\nadditional type of body armor appeared highly effective in reducing\r\ncombat casualties; its extended coverage also raised morale.\r\n\r\nThough their ability to halt successfully a Chinese bullet or exploding\r\nshell was being improved on, thanks to armored wear, the Marines’\r\nopportunity to keep the enemy from division outposts or MLR areas was\r\nstill being hampered by occasional ammunition shortages. From time to\r\ntime during the winter months there was some relief from the grenade\r\nand howitzer firing restrictions that had been in effect before the\r\nHook fighting. The cutback on use of 81mm mortar shells continued,\r\nhowever, as the supply level of these projectiles remained dangerously\r\nlow.\r\n\r\nA new shortage, this one in fuel, developed during the winter. In\r\nJanuary 1953 it became necessary to reduce the distribution of\r\ngasoline for motor vehicles to .829 gallons per man per day, a drop\r\nof 17 percent from the previous month’s allocation. Diesel fuel was\r\ncut back to 1.41 gallons, or 7 percent less than the December ration.\r\nBy February, however, the crisis had passed and vehicles returned to\r\na less restricted operating schedule. No extreme hardship had been\r\nexperienced by the Marines during the fuel drought. It was considered\r\nthat “prolonged operation under such restrictions would result in a\r\nmarked decrease in efficiency since many essential activities may be\r\ntemporarily postponed, although not entirely eliminated.”[329]\r\n\r\n    [329] 1stMarDiv ComdD, Jan 53, p. 3.\r\n\r\nThe month of February also witnessed the largest helicopter supply lift\r\nin Korea, HAYLIFT I, the previous September, had tested the feasibility\r\nof transporting Class I, III, and V supplies to a frontline infantry\r\nregiment for five consecutive days. HMR-161 and the 7th Marines had\r\nturned out an excellent test performance of the rotary craft in this\r\nlogistical operation. It then became the task for the infantry and\r\nhelicopters to run a resupply operation for two frontline regiments for\r\na five-day period. HAYLIFT II, conducted 23–27 February, was the code\r\nname for this test.\r\n\r\nBoth the planning and execution of the February operation followed\r\nthe general pattern of HAYLIFT I, but on a much larger scale. As in\r\nSeptember, division ordnance and service battalions moved the supplies\r\nto helicopter loading zones near Lieutenant Colonel Carey’s HMR-161\r\nair strip. It had been estimated that 130 tons each day would have to\r\nbe lifted to supply the two MLR regiments, the 7th and 5th Marines.\r\nOn the first day, this figure was exceeded by 30 tons. A request\r\nby A/1/5 on 24 February for support during an emergency operation\r\nnecessitated additional ammunition[330] and helicopters to be diverted\r\nfrom those resupplying the 7th Marines. By the third day, a backlog of\r\nsupplies had accumulated in the loading areas. In order to eliminate\r\nthis buildup and to replace ammunition expended that morning by 1/5,\r\nHMR-161 on 25 February transported 200 tons in a single day, thereby\r\nestablishing a new record. This represented 392 lifts made in 138.4\r\nhours flying time. Maximum time for unloading a chopper was 54 seconds;\r\nthe minimum, 28 seconds.\r\n\r\n    [330] The following month, HMR-161 engaged in a four-day\r\n          ammunition resupply operation for the division. Except\r\n          for one day, the 22d, all available helicopters were\r\n          assigned to that mission, beginning 20 March. HMR-161\r\n          also had a new CO by that time, Colonel Owen A. Chambers\r\n          who had taken over from Lieutenant Colonel Carey on 15\r\n          March.\r\n\r\nThe last two days of HAYLIFT II, although less eventful, contributed\r\nto a resupply tonnage record five times greater than that set by\r\nHAYLIFT I. On the last day, when fog grounded their aircraft for a\r\nsecond time during the morning, Marines were again reminded of an\r\noperational limitation of the helicopters. In the end, though, the\r\naccomplishments far out-weighed this shortcoming. During the five\r\ndays, a total of 1,612,406 pounds of supplies had been lifted to the\r\ntwo frontline regiments. Not one crewman or helicopter was lost. The\r\noperation contributed significantly to the February record for the\r\ngreatest number of combat hours (765), total hours (1,275.5), combat\r\nflights (575), and total flights (1,183) flown by HMR-161 for any\r\none-month period during the Korean fighting. For the rest of the war,\r\nthe February 1953 gross lift of 2,018,120 pounds would also rank as the\r\nlargest amount transported by HMR-161 for a single month.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Quiet Sectors_[331]\r\n\r\n    [331] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: KPR ComdDs, Jun, Aug, Oct-Dec 52, Jan-Mar\r\n          53; 1st AmTracBn ComdDs, Mar-Dec 52, Jan-Mar 53.\r\n\r\nTwo frontline units in the division MLR seldom became involved in\r\nsetting records or bitter contests with the enemy, even though they\r\ncarried out important roles in the sector defense. These were the\r\nKimpo Provisional Regiment and 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion, both\r\nlocated on the left flank of the Marine line. The Kimpo Provisional\r\nRegiment had been organized as a component of the 1st Marine Division\r\na week after its arrival in the west, specifically for defending that\r\nvital sector at the extreme left of the UNC line. The next month the\r\n1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion had been assigned part of Line KANSAS\r\nbetween the KPR and KMC sectors.\r\n\r\nBecause it was set apart from the Korean mainland on the north and east\r\nby the Han River,[332] Kimpo Peninsula afforded little opportunity\r\nfor its occupants to engage the enemy directly in infantry clashes.\r\nArtillery thus became the normal medium for carrying on the limited\r\nhostilities as they existed in this sector between the Communists\r\nand UNC opponents. Hostile forces opposing the KPR were deployed\r\nin company-sized strongpoints across the river, occupying numerous\r\nfortified heights on the north bank of the Han estuary. Enemy\r\nstrength[333] was estimated to be 7 infantry companies, supported by\r\n7 artillery batteries and 40 mortar positions. Sporadic mortar and\r\nartillery rounds fell in the sector, with little harm. Occasionally,\r\nenemy counterbattery fire caused minor damage to the LVTs of the\r\ncommand. During 1952, the first year of the existence of the Kimpo\r\nregiment, 15 June had stood as the record day for the number of enemy\r\nartillery rounds received. Between 1900–2100 a total of 588 shells had\r\nfallen in the sector.\r\n\r\n    [332] On the west, the Yom River similarly separates the Kimpo\r\n          Peninsula from Kanghwa-do Island, second in size of all\r\n          Korean islands and a base for friendly intelligence\r\n          operations.\r\n\r\n    [333] Identified as elements of the 195th CCF Division of the\r\n          65th CCF Army and an unidentified CCF division, in a\r\n          revised EOOB issued in December. Previously, units of the\r\n          193d CCF Division were at the front in this far western\r\n          sector. KPR ComdDs, Oct-Dec 52.\r\n\r\nAs part of its normal defense mission, personnel of the regiment\r\nspent a large part of their time controlling civilians and regulating\r\ntraffic, especially water travel. Certain counterintelligence\r\nproblems confronted the Kimpo Provisional Regiment. A large civilian\r\npopulation, numbering nearly 80,000 natives, lived within the\r\nregimental sector. Local restrictions set by the National Police on\r\nKimpo (who cooperated with the KPR in security matters) included the\r\nSTAYBACK LINE to the north of the peninsula. As a rule, no civilians\r\nother than those with daytime farming permits, were allowed beyond this\r\nline. Numerous regulations were also issued to control boat traffic.\r\nSurrounded by rivers on three sides, there was ample opportunity for\r\nenemy agents or line crossers to infiltrate the defense line, despite\r\ncontinuous screening by friendly outposts and waterborne patrols.\r\n\r\nTwo months after the “heavy” June shelling came the August floods,\r\nwhich were more destructive than the artillery had been. The rest of\r\nthe summer and fall followed a fairly regular, uneventful pattern with\r\ncustomary defense duties, rotation of frontline units, and training\r\nexercises. Among the latter were four helicopter demonstrations in\r\nOctober and a five-hour communication CPX (Command Post Exercise) the\r\nfollowing month.\r\n\r\nOne episode toward the end of the year created a temporary stir in\r\nthe daily routine. In late November, two Communist espionage agents\r\nand their North Korean guides were apprehended on the west bank of\r\nthe Han, almost directly east of the Kimpo Airfield. They had crossed\r\nthe Imjin-Han Rivers by boat, using this normal infiltration route to\r\npenetrate the Marine defense net. The agents were seized by National\r\nPolice on 22 November and their North Korean guides two days later. It\r\nwas unusual for agents and guides to be captured so closely together.\r\nNormal defense measures of the peninsula had assigned separate\r\nnorthern, western, and southern sector units for protection against\r\npossible amphibious or overland attacks or--far more likely--enemy\r\ninfiltration.\r\n\r\nThe following month four more “roving” two-man outposts were\r\nestablished in the western coastal area of the southern sector.\r\nManned from sunset to 30 minutes after sunrise daily by either KPR\r\nmilitary personnel or National Police, the outposts occupied different\r\npositions each night. They were responsible for checking for proper\r\nidentification and enforcing the rigid 2100–0500 curfew hours. Another\r\nunusual occurrence took place the last four nights of December when a\r\nsingle-engine light aircraft dropped propaganda leaflets in Colonel\r\nHarvey C. Tschirgi’s[334] sector.\r\n\r\n    [334] Colonel Tschirgi had taken command of the KPR on 1\r\n          December from Colonel Richard H. Crockett, who previously\r\n          relieved Colonel Staab (the original KPR commander) on 31\r\n          August.\r\n\r\nCommanded by Lieutenant Colonel Dobervich, the 1st Amphibian Tractor\r\nBattalion (minus Company A at KPR, and Company B at Pohang), reinforced\r\nby the Division Reconnaissance Company, had manned positions on the\r\nKANSAS line since April 1952. By the end of May, the battalion had\r\ninserted an additional unit, a provisional company,[335] in the\r\nKANSAS secondary defense line. In July, the amtrac company relieved\r\nthe reconnaissance company on line, the latter then becoming part of\r\nHeadquarters Battalion, 1st Marine Division. All amphibian tractor\r\nbattalion units assigned to ground defense missions received special\r\nrefresher training in infantry operations, including the employment of\r\nforward observers.\r\n\r\n    [335] Comprising a platoon from Company B and several\r\n          headquarters elements, the provisional company was\r\n          disbanded on 14 June when Company B that had been\r\n          supporting MAG-33 at Pohang was reassigned to the\r\n          battalion.\r\n\r\nDuring the first summer in the west, the mainland-based amphibian\r\norganization continued its KANSAS defense mission. The battalion also\r\ninstituted a training program for patrolling the Han River by tractor.\r\n(Company A, attached to the KPR, had conducted waterborne patrols of\r\nthe Yom since June. The unit also manned outposts along that river.)\r\nHeadquarters and Service Company assisted the U.S. Army in laying a\r\nsignal cable across the river during August, the same month Lieutenant\r\nColonel Dobervich relinquished unit command to Lieutenant Colonel Edwin\r\nB. Wheeler. In late August the battalion sent 58 of its members to help\r\naugment 1st Marines ranks, thinned by the fierce Bunker Hill fighting.\r\n\r\nThrough the end of 1952, the 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion continued\r\nits KANSAS mission. Although the sector had witnessed relatively\r\nlittle action for some months, several incidents about this time\r\nvaried the generally quiet daily routine. In October, Company B (Major\r\nCharles W. Fitzmaurice) sent out an amphibious patrol to capture\r\nprisoners (Operation CAT WHISKER). The plan was to cross the Han in\r\na rubber boat and set up an ambush after reaching the enemy shore,\r\nbut a storm-angered river, with a strong tide boosted by heavy winds,\r\nprevented landing of the boat. Two months later, another snare--this\r\none set by the enemy--was partially successful. Several hours after\r\ndark on 1 December, the jeep assigned to the battalion commander, Major\r\nGeorge S. Saussy, Jr.,[336] was being driven on the MSR by Private\r\nFirst Class Billy J. Webb, its operator and only occupant.\r\n\r\n    [336] Formerly the executive officer, Major Saussy took over\r\n          unit command on 7 November, when Lieutenant Colonel\r\n          Wheeler was transferred to the 5th Marines. Lieutenant\r\n          Colonel Frank R. Wilkinson, Jr., became the next\r\n          commanding officer on 16 March 1953.\r\n\r\nSuddenly shots rang out from the side of the road. Within a few\r\nseconds, 23 bullets from a Russian-made submachine gun had struck the\r\njeep; the driver, astonishingly, received only a knee wound. No trace\r\nof the ambushers could be found by the friendly patrol dispatched to\r\ninvestigate the incident. An activity of an entirely different nature\r\nthat same month was the assignment of battalion LVTs to break up the\r\nheavily encrusted ice that had formed around and endangered supports of\r\nthree bridges in the I Corps area. A rash of minor incidents involving\r\nwould-be, but unsuccessful, enemy infiltrators also took place during\r\nthe winter months in the amtrac sector. In November, three agents\r\nattempted to cross the Imjin on their way to the division area, but\r\nwere engaged by a battalion patrol. After a brief fire fight, friendly\r\nartillery was called down on the retreating boat and it was believed\r\ndestroyed. Enemy agents on foot were engaged by National Police or\r\nMarine listening posts again in January and March and deterred from\r\ntheir espionage missions.\r\n\r\nCommitment to an infantry role in the KANSAS line, meanwhile, had\r\npermitted little time for operation of the battalion tractors. In\r\nDecember, construction began on a storage park for those LVTs not in\r\nuse. By placing the non-operating tracked vehicles in a single area,\r\nthe battalion could handle routine maintenance with just a few men.\r\nThis facility, located at Ascom City, was completed early in 1953.\r\nBy March, a total of 34 tractors had been placed there in caretaker\r\nstatus. Implicit in this economy measure was the requirement that all\r\nstowed tractors could revert to combat status, if necessary, on a\r\n48-hour alert.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Changes in the Concept of Ground Defense_[337]\r\n\r\n    [337] The material in this section is derived from: _PacFlt\r\n          EvalRpt_ No. 5, Chap. 8.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months of 1952–1953, the 1st Marine Division modified\r\nthe organization of its tactical defense, although it retained the\r\nbasic concept of the combat outpost system as the backbone of MLR\r\ndefense.[338] Development of much of the KANSAS line and parts of the\r\nMarine MLR during this period reflected several new ideas on how the\r\nground defense could be better organized. Recent experience during\r\nCommunist attacks had shown that defensive emplacements and positions\r\ncould be dug deeper and below ground to withstand massed enemy fires.\r\nContrary to traditional concepts, it had also been found that centering\r\nthe defense on the military crest[339] of a hill was not always the\r\nbest procedure. Emplacement of machine guns downslope or in low firing\r\npositions to cover draws or flat ground was not entirely suitable to\r\nthe Korean terrain, enemy, or nature of positional warfare.\r\n\r\n    [338] The 1st Commonwealth Division, to the Marine right,\r\n          utilized a different defense system. Instead of relying\r\n          on the COPs forward of the main line of defense as major\r\n          deterrent positions, the British preferred to include all\r\n          strategic terrain features within the MLR itself. They\r\n          followed a policy of active patrolling to the front and,\r\n          at night, occupied selected ground sites, preferring to\r\n          fight the enemy from their main battle positions rather\r\n          than from more isolated COP positions. _PactFlt EvalRpt_\r\n          No. 6, Chap. 9, pp. 9-92, 9-93.\r\n\r\n    [339] The military crest is that point along the slope of a\r\n          hill from which maximum observation up and down the hill\r\n          can be obtained. The topographical crest is the highest\r\n          point on a hill or ridge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP DIAGRAM 20      K. White\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF GROUND DEFENSE\r\n\r\nWINTER 1952–1953]\r\n\r\nAltered defense concepts, beginning in October, took the following form:\r\n\r\n  (1) The trace of defensive positions followed the topographical\r\n  crest (A) rather than military crest (B) of key terrain features.\r\n  (Map diagrams 20 and 21 illustrate these changes.)\r\n\r\n  (2) Fighting positions and emplacements were dug a short distance\r\n  downslope (C) from the topographical crest.\r\n\r\n  (3) Trenches on the topographical crest permitted easier, faster,\r\n  and more protected access to fighting positions from the reverse\r\n  slope and support area (D).\r\n\r\n  (4) Positions on the topographical crest were less vulnerable to\r\n  enemy artillery because it was more difficult for the enemy to\r\n  adjust his fire on these positions than on trenches dug along the\r\n  military crest. Many shells simply passed over the top (E) of the\r\n  hill.\r\n\r\n  (5) Certain hills and noses were selected and organized so that\r\n  trenches and gun emplacements, encircling the crest, would form\r\n  mutually supporting positions (X).\r\n\r\n  (6) Machine guns were moved from the draws (Y) to hilltops and\r\n  noses (Z) where better long-range observation and fields of fire\r\n  existed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP DIAGRAM 21      K. WHITE\r\n\r\nTYPICAL HILL DEFENSE\r\n\r\n(Cross Section)\r\n\r\nWINTER 1952–1953]\r\n\r\nAnother change in the improvement of field fortifications came into use\r\nduring the winter months. A different type of barbed wire obstacle,\r\ncalled “Canadian,” “random,” or “double-apron” wire, began to find\r\nfavor with Marine infantrymen. Canadian wire consisted of two parallel\r\nrows of three-strand barbed wire fencing, erected about three feet\r\napart. The void was filled in with additional barbed wire, placed\r\nat random, but connected to the parallel fences.[340] The new type\r\nbarbed wire appeared more effective for several reasons. Besides being\r\nsimple and fast to emplace, Canadian wire merely became more entangled\r\nby artillery shelling, which quickly ripped apart the standard\r\ndouble-apron barbed wire previously used in COP slope defenses.\r\n\r\n    [340] Commenting on the heavy destruction of Hook\r\n          fortifications by CCF preparation, one 7th Marine company\r\n          commander stated: “Enemy artillery and mortars did tend\r\n          to destroy the protective wire. We noted especially that\r\n          the Canadian ‘Random Wire,’ although it tended to move\r\n          about under fire, did hold together and continue to offer\r\n          good protection.” _McLaughlin ltr._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Before the Nevadas Battle_[341]\r\n\r\n    [341] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9; 1stMarDiv\r\n          ComdDs, Feb-Mar 53; 1stMar ComdD, Mar 53; 5thMar ComdDs,\r\n          Feb-Mar 53; 7thMar, 11thMar, 1st TkBn, 1/5, 2/5, 1/7\r\n          ComdDs, Feb 53.\r\n\r\nAs the Marine division continued to revamp and strengthen its primary\r\ndefenses, a change of pace on the battlefront was gradually being felt.\r\nOnly a few major raids had taken place during November, December, and\r\nJanuary, and these involved no transfer of real estate. Casualties had\r\nbeen light. Artillery rounds, both incoming and outgoing, had dropped\r\nsubstantially. By February, however, it became apparent that the period\r\nof winter inactivity was nearing an end.\r\n\r\nTaking the initiative in the renewed action was the 5th Marines,\r\noccupants of the right regimental sector since 25 January. The next\r\nmonth the regiment conducted three successful daytime raids against\r\nfortified enemy positions. Targets for the initial action, on 3\r\nFebruary, were two consistently troublesome hills, 31 and 31A in the\r\nUngok Hill mass, north of the left battalion sector.\r\n\r\nSince all battalions of the 5th Marines were to be involved either\r\ndirectly or indirectly in Operation CLAMBAKE, the initial planning and\r\nactual execution of the raid was to be carried out by the regimental\r\ncommander, Colonel Walt. CLAMBAKE required especially thorough\r\ncoordination of the heavy fire support since it was to be launched with\r\na tank-artillery feint against several CCF positions (Hill 104, Kumgok,\r\nand Red Hill) generally west of the Ungok objective area. The two\r\ntarget hills were to be assaulted by reinforced platoons from Company\r\nA (Captain Don H. Blanchard) of the reserve battalion, 1/5, commanded\r\nby Lieutenant Colonel Jonas M. Platt, who was responsible for the later\r\nplanning stages of the raid. It was anticipated that intensive air and\r\nartillery preparation on the feint objectives and movement of gun and\r\nflame tanks during the diversion would gain the element of surprise for\r\nthe assault platoons. Thus the Marines hoped to take prisoners, the\r\nmain purpose of the raid, and to kill enemy troops and destroy their\r\ndefenses.\r\n\r\nDuring the five weeks of preparation, every aspect of the maneuver was\r\nthoroughly reviewed and rehearsed. All participating units took part\r\nin the planning conferences. Routes were reconnoitered, mines cleared,\r\nand fire concentrations plotted and registered. MAG-12 pilots studied\r\nthe target areas from the nearby Marine MLR. Six rehearsals, including\r\npractice in casualty evacuation, uncovered potential problem areas.\r\nFinal rehearsal was held 1 February, with artillery and air preparation\r\nmade against the feint objectives. Four close air support strikes were\r\nconducted that day and the next as part of the plan to divert enemy\r\nattention from the CLAMBAKE destruction mission.\r\n\r\nShortly after first light on 3 February, three platoons of tanks\r\nrumbled across the MLR to assault the feint area. A heavy “false”\r\nartillery preparation by 1/11 was also placed on the three western\r\nenemy hills as well as direct fire from gun and flame tanks. The two\r\nMarine assault forces, one against each hill, moved out armed with\r\nflamethrowers, 3.5-inch rockets, machine guns, grenades, satchel\r\ncharges, bangalore torpedoes, and automatic weapons. Enemy forces\r\noccupying the positions made three separate counterattack attempts,\r\nwhich were blunted by Marine supporting arms. During the infantry\r\nattack, friendly air hovered on station and artillery fired continuous\r\ncounterbattery and countermortar fire.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the change of withdrawal route of one of the\r\nassault teams, the 5th Marines reported that the operation was carried\r\nout according to plan. Company A tanks had swung left across the frozen\r\nrice paddies to provide left flank security for the infantry and to\r\ninterdict trenchlines that connected with the Ungok objective. Intense\r\nenemy fire lashed the armored vehicles as they approached Kumgok\r\nand Red Hill as well as those supporting tanks that remained on the\r\nMLR.[342] Air, artillery, infantry, and tanks produced an estimated\r\n390 Chinese casualties (including 90 known KIA) in addition to damaged\r\nor destroyed trenchlines, tunnels, caves, bunkers, and weapons of the\r\nenemy. Marine losses were 14 killed and 91 wounded. One flame tank was\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n    [342] For a detailed account of the tank action in the CLAMBAKE\r\n          raid see Col Clyde W. Hunter ltr to Dir MCHist, HQMC, dtd\r\n          6 Jun 70, in v. V, Korean comment file.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the 1st Marines WAKEUP raid in November 1952,\r\nCLAMBAKE was important not so much in accomplishing its primary\r\nmission (actually, no POWs were taken) as in lessons learned. One of\r\nthese was to reemphasize the fact that thorough preparation helped\r\nto ensure smooth coordination of infantry and supporting arms. In\r\nhis report of the operation, Lieutenant Colonel Platt wrote, “minute\r\nplanning to the last detail along with carefully executed rehearsals\r\nare basic to success in actions of this type.”[343] He further noted\r\nthat “confidence and enthusiasm stimulated by the rehearsals are\r\nassets which cannot be overlooked.”[344] The battalion commander also\r\ncommented on the importance of planning for both troop withdrawal and\r\nmaintaining a flexible schedule of fires by supporting arms. Air,[345]\r\nartillery, and tanks all employed fire plans that could be readily\r\nadjusted to meet the changing tactical situation.\r\n\r\n    [343] 1/5 ComdD, Feb. 53, App. IVc, dtd 19 Feb 53, p. 5.\r\n\r\n    [344] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n    [345] In order to assure better close air support during the\r\n          assault; an SOP for the airborne tactical controller was\r\n          proposed and drafted by MAG-12 for 1st MAW approval.\r\n          The plan utilized the marking of targets by rocket and\r\n          subsequent corrections to be made by the FAC. This\r\n          enabled MAG-12 aircraft “to scramble, fly a CAS mission\r\n          at the Division front and be back at the field at K-6 in\r\n          approximately 40 minutes.” Col Wayne M. Cargill ltr to\r\n          Dir MCHist, HQMC, dtd 8 Jan 70.\r\n\r\nOn the ground, flame was found to be the best weapon for neutralizing\r\nthe well-fortified CCF caves. From Company A, 1st Tank Battalion\r\n(Captain Hunter) came information about Chinese 3.5-inch rocket\r\nlauncher teams used in antitank defense. Several of these tank-killer\r\nteams had run down the trenchline holding small bushes in front of\r\nthem. The enemy then boldly advanced through a hail of bullets to\r\nwithin 15–20 yards of the Marine tank before opening fire with their\r\nrockets. Short bursts of flame from headquarters tanks soon caused even\r\nthe most intrepid to beat a hurried retreat.\r\n\r\nConcluding his after-action report of CLAMBAKE, the regimental\r\ncommander, Colonel Walt, observed:\r\n\r\n  In addition to inflicting large numbers of casualties and\r\n  destruction upon the enemy, the operation served a secondary\r\n  purpose, none the less important. It provided excellent training\r\n  and experience for the various infantry and supporting arms\r\n  staffs involved, helping to develop them into a smoothly\r\n  functioning infantry-air-artillery-tank team.[346]\r\n\r\n    [346] 5th Mar ComdD, Feb 53, App. VI, dtd 20 Feb 53, p. 3.\r\n\r\nShortly before the end of the month, the 5th Marines made another\r\nmajor assault. As in the earlier CLAMBAKE, this raid was again in\r\ntwo-reinforced-platoon size and made during the early daylight hours\r\nof 25 February. This time the objective was a single height, Hill 15\r\n(Detroit), two miles east of the CLAMBAKE objective. Lieutenant Colonel\r\nOscar F. Peatross’[347] 2/5, manning the extreme right sector of the\r\ndivision, gave the assignment to Company F, then under Captain Harold\r\nD. Kurth, Jr. Planning for Operation CHARLIE, a standard-type kill,\r\ncapture, and destroy raid, was carried out in much the same detailed\r\nmanner as the earlier 1/5 raid.\r\n\r\n    [347] Lieutenant Colonel Peatross had succeeded Lieutenant\r\n          Colonel McLaughlin as battalion CO on 11 Sep 52.\r\n\r\nCHARLIE differed somewhat in concept in that the 2/5 operational plan\r\nattempted to gain surprise by launching the attack during the BMNT[348]\r\nperiod as well as in use of smoke to screen enemy observation.\r\nSupporting arms preparatory fires had been carefully plotted, including\r\nthe precision destruction aerial bombing that had proved so effective\r\nin the CLAMBAKE assault. In actual execution of CHARLIE, however, bad\r\nweather prevented the use of almost all the planned pre-D-Day and D-Day\r\nair strikes. Upon reaching the Detroit objective area assault Marines\r\n“found the majority of enemy installations were relatively undamaged,\r\neven though subjected to heavy bombardment by other supporting\r\narms.”[349] Artillery preparatory fires had been employed successfully\r\nto isolate the battle area and howitzer and tank missions supported the\r\nraid.[350]\r\n\r\n    [348] Beginning morning nautical twilight is that period\r\n          before sunrise or after sunset (BENT, or beginning\r\n          evening nautical twilight) when visibility is limited to\r\n          approximately 300 yards.\r\n\r\n    [349] 5thMar ComdD, Feb 53, App. VI, dtd 28 Feb 53, p. 5.\r\n\r\n    [350] In nearly three hours of firing, the 11th Marines and\r\n          its reinforcing and attached units, including the 1st\r\n          Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, expended 11,881 rounds.\r\n          Indicative of the meticulous planning that preceded an\r\n          operation such as CHARLIE is the 11th Marines report of\r\n          this raid, 11thMar ComdD, Feb 53.\r\n\r\nBetween the time of CLAMBAKE and CHARLIE a series of Marine and enemy\r\nsmall units actions erupted which were soon to become a way of life\r\nfor the MLR combatants. By sporadic outpost attacks and increasing\r\ntheir use of artillery, the Chinese were beginning to demonstrate a\r\nmore aggressive attitude than in recent months. On the night of 12–13\r\nFebruary, a CCF platoon supported by mortars and artillery probed\r\nCOP Hedy (Hill 124), in the right battalion of the center regimental\r\nsector, held by Lieutenant Colonel Barrett’s 3/7. On the next night,\r\nit was the Korean Marines who turned aggressor. Two of their platoons\r\nraided Hill 240, on the west bank of the Sachon, nearly three miles\r\nnorth of the mouth of the river. The following night, a 7th Marines\r\npatrol moving into ambush positions was itself stalked by a large CCF\r\npatrol. When reinforcements, including armored vehicles, moved out from\r\nthe MLR to support the Marines, the Chinese hastily withdrew.\r\n\r\nThree more contacts were made before the end of the month along the\r\ndivision front. On 19 February CCF soldiers, in two-platoon strength,\r\nengaged KMC sentries forward of COP 33, located about a mile east of\r\nthe action the previous week. After the initial exchange of small arms\r\nfire, the Koreans moved back to the outpost and called down supporting\r\nfires on the Chinese. Artillery and mortars tore into the attackers\r\ncausing numerous casualties and forcing the enemy to withdraw. On the\r\nmorning of 22 February, a raiding party from the 5th Marines assaulted\r\na smaller enemy force at Hill 35A, approximately 1,300 yards southwest\r\nof the Ungok hills. In this second raid staged by the 5th Marines that\r\nmonth, assault troops (H/3/5) used flamethrowers in the early stages of\r\nthe action to help clear enemy trenches of hostile grenade throwers.\r\n\r\nLate the next night a 7th Marines unit, consisting of a reinforced\r\nplatoon and four M-46 tanks, set out to raid Yoke, located near the\r\npeace corridor five miles north of Freedom Bridge. The assault against\r\nthat position never came off. At 2137 as the B/1/7 platoon moved into\r\npreliminary positions on Hill 90, north of the ultimate objective, a\r\nChinese company ambushed the patrol from three sides. When the Marines\r\nclosed with the enemy in hand-to-hand fighting, a support platoon was\r\nsent from the MLR. After an intense 30 minute fire fight, the CCF began\r\nwithdrawing at 0138. Enemy losses were listed as 45 counted KIA, 33\r\nestimated KIA, and 35 estimated WIA. As a result of the assault, orders\r\nfor the 7th Marines raid on Yoke were cancelled. Marine casualties\r\nnumbered 5 killed, 22 wounded.\r\n\r\nWhereas February was characterized by a marked increase in ground\r\ncontacts between Marines and their CCF adversaries, during the first\r\npart of March the Chinese again assumed an inactive posture. Marine\r\npatrols reported few contacts. Except for a KMC raid on 3 March, little\r\naction that could be considered a sizable engagement took place until\r\nafter midmonth. On the 16th there was a brief skirmish involving a 5th\r\nMarines combat patrol near Reno and a short fire fight between Carson\r\ndefenders and an enemy squad. The next night a Chinese platoon, waiting\r\nnear Vegas for a Marine patrol to pass by, was itself put to flight by\r\nthe patrol.\r\n\r\nTwo encounters with the CCF on 19 March marked the heaviest action\r\nyet of the month. Early that morning, a predawn raid was staged by\r\nB/1/5 (Captain Theodore J. Mildner) at Hill 31A, one of the Ungok twin\r\nobjectives in CLAMBAKE the previous month. The March ITEM raid employed\r\n111 Marines. One platoon was to make the assault and the second platoon\r\nto support the operation and assist in casualty evacuation. Following\r\na series of nearly a dozen air strikes on the objective and artillery\r\npreparation, Captain Mildner’s two assault platoons jumped off from\r\nthe MLR check point at 0518. As usually happened in such operations,\r\nthe preliminary fire drove the Chinese to reverse slope defenses. No\r\nenemy POWs were taken and at 0700 the Marine units disengaged, due to\r\ncasualties sustained from enemy shelling and machine gun fire.[351]\r\n\r\n    [351] Prior to the raid various combinations of flamethrower\r\n          fuels and pressure were extensively used. The purpose\r\n          was to determine the maximum effective range of\r\n          the flamethrower teams in order to “neutralize the\r\n          hand-grenade throwing potential of the enemy, this being\r\n          one of the major problems confronting assault elements on\r\n          other raids.” Final tests resulted in flame being thrown\r\n          more than 40 yards up hill. 1/5 ComdD, Mar 53, App. IVf,\r\n          p. 3.\r\n\r\nEarlier that same date, two attacks had been made simultaneously by\r\nthe enemy on outposts in the center regimental sector, where the 1st\r\nMarines had relieved the 7th on 10 March. At 0105 one CCF company\r\nstruck in the vicinity of Hedy while a second lunged at Esther, about\r\n1½ miles east. When a G/3/1 reconnaissance patrol operating forward\r\nof COP Esther observed enemy movement, the Marines pulled back to\r\nthe outpost, alerting it to the impending attack. After a heavy\r\nincoming artillery barrage, the enemy assaulted the outpost, but when\r\na three-hour effort failed to carry the position, the attackers\r\nwithdrew. By that time the Chinese company which had hit COP Hedy had\r\nalso broken off the attack.\r\n\r\nActually the fight in Captain Carl R. Gray’s Company H sector, to the\r\nrear of Hedy, was mainly at the MLR, for the Chinese indulged in merely\r\na brief fire fight at the latter outpost, bypassing it in favor of a\r\ncrack at JAMESTOWN. The main line of resistance failed to yield to\r\nthe enemy thrust, which was supported by 2,400 rounds of mortar and\r\nartillery fire along the MLR and outposts.\r\n\r\nAfter being thwarted by Hedy-Esther defenses, the enemy shifted his\r\nefforts westward to the 1st KMC area. The Korean regiment received\r\nthe brunt of the enemy’s minor infantry probes immediately preceding\r\nthe Nevada Cities battle. Late on 25 March a series of skirmishes\r\nbroke out in the 1st Marines sector between one-or-two platoon size\r\nChinese infantry forces and Marine outpost defenders. Following a quiet\r\ndaylight spell on the 26th, the Chinese resumed the offensive with a\r\nprobe at COP Dagmar. This coincided with what developed into a massive\r\nregimental assault unleashed against Carson, Reno, and Vegas, outposts\r\nin the 5th Marines sector, to the right. There Colonel Walt’s regiment\r\nwould shortly be the target of the bloodiest Chinese attack to date on\r\nthe 1st Marine Division in West Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nVegas\r\n\r\n_The Nevada Cities--Supporting Arms--Defense Organization at the\r\nOutposts--Chinese Attack on 26 March--Reinforcements Dispatched--Massed\r\nCounterattack the Next Day--Push to the Summit--Other Communist\r\nProbes--Three CCF Attempts for the Outpost--Vegas Consolidation\r\nBegins--Aftermath_\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Nevada Cities_[352]\r\n\r\n    [352] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9;\r\n          1stMarDiv, 1stMar, 5thMar, 11thMar, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5\r\n          ComdDs, Mar 53; 5thMar ComdD, Apr 53, Special Action Rpt\r\n          Period 26–30 Mar 53, “Battle of the Cities,” hereafter\r\n          5thMar SAR “Cities”; Maj Norman W.

Consider just the matter of basic logistics. Rising\r\ntemperatures, tons of melting snow, and the thawing of the Imjin River,\r\nlocated north of the rear Marine support and reserve areas, would turn\r\nvital road nets into quagmires to tax the patience and ingenuity of men\r\nand machinery alike.\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of another spring in Korea there was strong likelihood\r\nthat the Chinese Communists facing the Marines across a 33-mile front\r\nof jagged peaks and steep draws would launch a new offensive. This\r\nwould enable them to regain the initiative and end the stalemate that\r\nhad existed since October when they were rebuffed in the battle for the\r\nHook.\r\n\r\nWinning new dominating hill or ridge positions adjacent to the Marine\r\nMLR, in that uneasy No-Mans-Land buffer zone between the CCF and UN\r\nlines, would be both militarily and psychologically advantageous to\r\nthe Communists. Any new yardage or victory, no matter how small,\r\ncould be exploited as leverage against the “Wall Street capitalists”\r\nwhen truce talks resumed at the Panmunjom bargaining table. Further,\r\ndominant terrain seized by the CCF would remain in Communist hands\r\nwhen the truce went into effect. Although wise to the tactics of\r\nthe Chinese,[353] UN intelligence had not anticipated the extent or\r\nintensity of the surprise CCF attack that opened up at 1900 on 26 March\r\nwhen the Communists sent battalions of 700 to 800 men against Marine\r\noutposts of 50 men.\r\n\r\n    [353] Since the first of the year division intelligence reports\r\n          had given the CCF the capability of mounting limited\r\n          objective attacks ranging from company to regimental\r\n          size. _PacFlt EvalRpt_, p. 9-28, quoting 1stMarDiv PIR\r\n          860, dtd 4 Mar 53.\r\n\r\nThe late March attack centered primarily on a trio of peaks where\r\nMarines had dug in three of their key outposts--Carson, Reno, and\r\nVegas. Rechristened from earlier, more prosaic names of Allen, Bruce,\r\nand Clarence, respectively, the Nevada Cities hill complex was located\r\napproximately 1,500 yards north of the MLR fronting the 5th Marines\r\nright sector. The trio was the province of 1/5, which manned the\r\nwestern (left) part of the regimental area. Ultimately, however,\r\nreverberations ran through nearly 10,000 yards of division front,\r\nfrom the two Berlin outposts, 1,000 yards east of Vegas, to COP Hedy,\r\nmidpoint in the 1st Marines center sector. Continuous attacks and\r\ncounterattacks for possession of the key Vegas outpost raged unabated\r\nfor five days. The action escalated into the bloodiest fighting to\r\ndate in western Korea, resulted in loss of a major outpost, and the\r\nkilling or wounding of nearly 1,000 Marines. It was a partial success\r\nfor the enemy, but he paid a high price for the real estate: casualties\r\namounting to more than twice the Marine losses, including 800 known\r\nkilled and a regiment that was decimated by the Marine defenders.\r\n\r\nThe three Nevada outposts lay just below the 38th Parallel,\r\napproximately 10 miles northeast of Panmunjom and the same distance\r\nnorth of the Marine railhead at Munsan-ni. Possession of the area would\r\ngive the Communists improved observation of I Corps MLR positions\r\nto the west. Indeed, the enemy had cast covetous eyes (an ambition\r\ntranslated into action through his well-known creeping tactics) on the\r\nsemi-circular net of outposts since the preceding summer.\r\n\r\nMindful of this, the I Corps commanding general back in September had\r\nstressed the importance of holding key terrain features that could be\r\nof major tactical value to the enemy. This included Bunker Hill and\r\nCOP Reno, both considered likely targets for renewed enemy aggression\r\nin the future. Particularly, the enemy had indicated he wanted to\r\nannex Reno. The object of increasing hostile attacks since July 1952,\r\nReno was the closest of the three Nevadas to CCF lines and tied in\r\ngeographically with two of the enemy’s high ground positions--Hill 190,\r\nto the northeast, and Hill 101, overlooking the site of the destroyed\r\nvillage of Ungok. (See Map 22.)\r\n\r\nReno’s companion outpost on the right, Vegas, at 175 meters, was the\r\nhighest of the three while Carson, on the left flank, was nearest\r\nJAMESTOWN and also assisted in defense of Reno and Vegas. Each of the\r\nthree outposts was manned by a rifle platoon (40 Marines plus two Navy\r\nhospital corpsmen), heavily reinforced with weapons company personnel.\r\nA small hill between Reno and Vegas, known as the Reno Block, further\r\nsupported the Nevada Cities complex and at night was defended by a\r\nreinforced squad.\r\n\r\nSince they commanded the historic Korean invasion route to Seoul, 30\r\nair miles south, the strategic importance of the Nevada outposts had\r\nbeen one of the reasons for transfer of the Marines from East Korea to\r\nthe West, in 1952. Both Reno and Vegas, moreover, overlooked Chinese\r\nrear area supply routes. This was a matter of special concern to the\r\nenemy at this time since he had recently doubled his stockpiling\r\nefforts and wanted to prevent UNC intelligence from learning about the\r\nbuild-up. Possession of the Nevada hills would enable the Chinese to\r\nharass the Marines at even closer range and--hopefully--to conduct new\r\nthrusts at the MLR which would ultimately weaken the UNC position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 22      K. WHITE\r\n\r\n5TH MARINES MLR SECTOR\r\n\r\n26 March 1953]\r\n\r\nIn mid- and late March, the units forward in the 1st Marine Division\r\nsector of the main defense line, JAMESTOWN, remained much as they had\r\nbeen in recent months. Left to right, the defending components were\r\nthe Kimpo Provisional Regiment, 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion, 1st\r\nKorean Marine Corps Regimental Combat Team (1st KMC/RCT),[354] 1st\r\nMarines, and 5th Marines. One change had occurred when the 1st Marines\r\nrelieved the 7th in the center sector earlier in the month. The latter\r\nwas now in division reserve in the Camp Rose rear area. Before long,\r\nthis regiment was to see more offensive action in a hotly contested,\r\nfive-day period than it had during its entire recent tour on line.\r\nOverall, the 1st Marine Division continued as one of the four infantry\r\ndivisions in the I Corps sector of EUSAK[355] and, in fact, the month\r\nitself marked exactly one year since the Marines had arrived on the\r\nwestern front.\r\n\r\n    [354] The 1st KMC Regiment had been redesignated the 1st\r\n          KMC/RCT on 15 Dec 52. Continuing under opcon of the\r\n          1stMarDiv, the Korean RCT consisted of four infantry\r\n          battalions, plus attached artillery, armor, engineer, and\r\n          service units. _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, Chap. 8, p. 8-64.\r\n\r\n    [355] To the Marine division right were the U.S. 2d Infantry,\r\n          ROK 1st, and U.S. 7th Infantry Divisions.\r\n\r\nOccupying the far eastern end of the division sector, the 5th Marines,\r\nunder command of Colonel Walt,[356] had been assigned to the MLR since\r\nlate January. The regiment manned six miles of the JAMESTOWN front.\r\nIt was flanked on the left by the 1st Marines while to the right its\r\nneighbor was the 38th Regiment, 2d Infantry Division, U.S. Army.\r\n\r\n    [356] No stranger to the 5th Marines, Colonel Walt had served\r\n          with this regiment during World War II at Guadalcanal,\r\n          Cape Gloucester, and Peleliu. He had commanded, on\r\n          separate occasions, 2/5 and 3/5 and had earned two Navy\r\n          Crosses for combat leadership and bravery.\r\n\r\nSince 20 February, the western part of the 5th regimental sector had\r\nbeen held by Lieutenant Colonel Platt’s 1/5, with Companies A, B, and\r\nC on line, from left to right. The battalion area held four outposts.\r\nCOP Ava was tucked down near the boundary between the 1st and 5th\r\nRegiments, while the Nevada, or Three Cities, triangle screened the\r\ncentral part of the latter regimental sector. A Company A squad[357]\r\noutposted Ava, some 325 yards forward of the main line. Personnel of\r\nCompany C were stationed on Carson and Reno. Vegas had a unique command\r\nsituation. Due to its proximity to the boundary between 1/5 and 3/5,\r\nVegas came under operational control of the former battalion while\r\npersonnel charged with its defense belonged to Company H of 3/5.\r\n\r\n    [357] Normally Ava was a squad-size outpost. Prior to and\r\n          during the late March attacks, all 5th Marine COPs were\r\n          strengthened.\r\n\r\nThe right flank of the regimental sector was the responsibility of 3/5,\r\nwhich had moved to the front on 23 March, under Lieutenant Colonel\r\nRobert J. Oddy. Companies H, G, and I were forward, in that order\r\nfrom the west, with George personnel on duty at the two reinforced\r\nsquad size outposts, Berlin and East Berlin. In regimental reserve was\r\nLieutenant Colonel James H. Finch’s 2/5.\r\n\r\nWestward along JAMESTOWN from Colonel Walt’s 5th Marines was the center\r\nregimental sector, held by the 1st Marines commanded by Colonel Adams.\r\n(See Map 23.) The extreme western part of the regimental line came to\r\na juncture with KMC territory just as it looped around the critical\r\nPanmunjom peace corridor. This left battalion sector was manned by\r\nLieutenant Colonel George A. Gililland’s 2/1. Companies E, D, B from\r\n1/1,[358] and F were forward, outposting COPs 1, 2, Marilyn, Kate,\r\nand Ingrid. To the right 3/1, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ernest\r\nG. Atkin, defended Hedy, Bunker, Ginger, Esther, Dagmar, and Corinne,\r\nwith Companies H, G, and I on line. Occupying the area adjacent to the\r\nsecondary defense installations, WYOMING and the western part of the\r\nKANSAS line, was Lieutenant Colonel Frederick R. Findtner’s reserve\r\n1/1. And located to the rear of the 1st and 5th Regiments was the 7th\r\nMarines (Colonel Haffner), in reserve,[359] and the division rear\r\nsupport units, also south of the Imjin.\r\n\r\n    [358] Company B from 1/l had been assigned to operational\r\n          control of 2/1 when the latter unit relieved 1/7 on\r\n          line on 10 March. The increased personnel enabled the\r\n          battalion to position a company-size detachment at the\r\n          strategic high ground, COP 2, that overlooked Panmunjom\r\n          and the critical truce talk site.\r\n\r\n    [359] Regimental command changed 27 March when Colonel Glenn C.\r\n          Funk, former commanding officer of the 1st Shore Party\r\n          Battalion, was assigned to the 7th Marines, succeeding\r\n          Colonel Haffner, who became G-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Supporting Arms_[360]\r\n\r\n    [360] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chaps. 9, 10;\r\n          1stMarDiv, 11thMar, 1st TkBn ComdDs, Mar 53; 1st MAW,\r\n          MAGs-12, -33 ComdDs, Mar 53.\r\n\r\nIn support of the three infantry regiments were the artillerymen,\r\nguns, and howitzers of Colonel Mills’ 11th Marines. Two of its three\r\nlight battalions, 1/11 and 3/11, provided 105mm direct fires to the\r\n5th and 1st Marines, respectively. The general support battalion was\r\n2/11, prepared to reinforce the fires of 1/11. The regimental medium\r\nbattalion, 4/11, was in general support of the division, as was the 1st\r\n4.5-inch Rocket Battery. To the southwest of the division sector, the\r\n75mm guns of the 1st KMC Artillery Battalion, also attached to the 11th\r\nMarines, were in direct support of the 1st KMC/RCT. Newly formed the\r\npreceding month, the 1st Provisional Antiaircraft Artillery-Automatic\r\nWeapons Platoon had the mission of defending two of the Imjin River\r\nBridges--Freedom and Spoonbill--in the division sector.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 23      K. WHITE\r\n\r\n1ST MARINES MLR SECTOR\r\n\r\n(Division Center)\r\n\r\n26 March 1953]\r\n\r\nIn addition to organic and attached units of the 11th, four I Corps\r\nartillery components, located within division territory, further\r\nreinforced 11th Marines capabilities. The 623d Field Artillery\r\nBattalion, with batteries in the 5th and 7th Marines sectors, like 4/11\r\nconsisted of 155mm howitzers. Three heavy artillery units were also\r\navailable for counterbattery missions. These 8-inch howitzers belonged\r\nto Battery C of the 17th Field Artillery, Battery B of the 204th\r\nField Artillery, and the 158th Field Artillery Battalion. These Army\r\nunits were assigned to general support of I Corps, reinforcing Marine\r\nfires on call, and were under operational control of the 159th Field\r\nArtillery Battalion Group.\r\n\r\nActive armored support for the division’s ground troops during\r\nMarch was provided by three of the four companies from the 1st Tank\r\nBattalion. Company A’s M-46s, flame tanks, and retrievers, well forward\r\nin the right sector, were in direct support of the 5th Marines; Company\r\nD tanks were assigned to the 1st Marines. Company B functioned as the\r\nforward reserve unit, ready to move into firing positions on the MLR if\r\nthe tactical situation called for it. The rear reserve unit, Company C,\r\nconducted refresher training and performed equipment checks on the rest\r\nof the battalion tanks. The battalion commander, since May 1952, was\r\nLieutenant Colonel John I. Williamson.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, with a personnel strength of 6,400, was\r\nlocated throughout Korea. Wing headquarters, Marine Air Control Group\r\n2, and Marine Air Group 33, with its F9F day jet fighters and the VMJ-1\r\nphoto reconnaissance squadron operated from K-3, Pohang. VMF(N)-513,\r\nwith all weather jet fighters, flew out of K-8, Kunsan, on the west\r\ncoast, 105 miles below Seoul. MAG-12 and its squadrons of attack ADs\r\nand Corsairs was relatively near the 1st Marine Division sector, at\r\nK-6, Pyongtaek, 30 miles southeast of Inchon. Marine Wing Service\r\nSquadron 1, with its heavy maintenance capability, remained at Itami,\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\nTactical control had been altered radically the previous month when\r\nthe Fifth Air Force had relinquished its command of Marine pilots and\r\nplanes and they returned to operational control of the 1st Marine\r\nAircraft Wing for the first time since the early days of the war.\r\nDirection of the helicopters in HMR-161 and VMO-6 used in transport\r\nand reconnaissance missions had for some time been closer to home;\r\nboth squadrons were under 1st Marine Division operational control.\r\nHMR-161 was based at A-17, in the vicinity of the 1st Marine Division\r\ncommand post. VMO-6, a composite unit consisting of single-engine\r\nOE-1 observation planes and a copter section of the HTL-4 and the new\r\nlarger HO5S-1 craft, was located at A-9, three miles south of division\r\nheadquarters. The squadron provided regularly scheduled helicopter\r\nevacuation of night frontline combat-casualties, artillery spotting\r\nflights, and airborne control of air strikes. Both squadrons performed\r\nroutine liaison and reconnaissance, administrative, and resupply\r\nflights.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Defense Organization on the Outposts_[361]\r\n\r\n    [361] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: 1/5, 3/5 ComdDs, Mar 53; 5thMar SAR\r\n          “Cities.”\r\n\r\nCarson (Hill 27), furthest west of the three Nevada Cities was, at 820\r\nyards, also nearest the Marine main line of resistance. It overlooked\r\nenemy terrain to the northwest and dominated an important approach\r\nfrom that same direction--the Seoul road. Organized as a perimeter\r\ndefense position, Carson security was oriented toward two major Chinese\r\nstrongpoints. These were the twin-peaked Ungok Hill mass (31-31A),\r\napproximately 650 yards west of the Seoul road which lay between Ungok\r\nand Carson, and Hill 67 (Arrowhead), an equal distance due northwest.\r\nOther critical features in the immediate Carson vicinity included, on\r\nthe right, the west finger of Reno; the ridgeline south from Reno to a\r\npoint known as “Ambush Alley,” in the vicinity of enemy Hill 47; and\r\nthe ridgeline approaches by the two listening posts--Fox finger and\r\nGeorge finger. (See Map 24.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 24      K. WHITE\r\n\r\nCOP CARSON\r\n\r\nMarch 1953]\r\n\r\nLittle cover or concealment existed, other than that offered by\r\nthe trenchline and a cave used as living quarters. Four weapons\r\npositions--light machine guns and Browning automatic rifles--covered\r\nmain enemy avenues of approach. These and two listening posts were each\r\nmanned by two men after 1800 and throughout the night. Of Carson’s\r\ncustomary strength of 38 (1 officer and 37 enlisted), 28 stood watch\r\nand worked on fortifications at night. A six-man security team was on\r\nduty during the day. All posts connected by land line to battalion\r\nheadquarters, where a 24-hour phone watch was maintained. Sound power\r\nphones and radios also provided communication with the company CP.\r\n\r\nNearly 350 yards of trenchline encircled the outpost. Most was in good\r\ncondition, five or more feet deep and two feet wide. The main trench on\r\nthe reverse slope was in spots shallow, only three to five feet, and a\r\nnew trench was being dug. Fields of fire for small arms protection were\r\nconsidered good, although some of the 28 fighting holes were overly\r\nclose to culvert and sandbag overheading, which prevented complete\r\nfire coverage of forward slopes. Adequate fire support could be given\r\nalong the southern slope of the west finger extending from COP Reno,\r\nwhich was also mutually supporting with that of the Reno Block. Forward\r\nobserver teams for the 60mm and 81mm mortars provided observation for\r\nsupporting arms. The arsenal of weapons at Carson included 4 A-4 light\r\nmachine guns, 2 flamethrowers, 2 3.5-inch rocket launchers, 9 Browning\r\nautomatic rifles, 36 M-1 rifles, 2 carbines, 2 pistols, and 4 grenade\r\nlaunchers.\r\n\r\nSome 450 yards northeast, COP Reno (Hill 25) was dug in on a ridgeline\r\nthat fronted enemy Hill 25A (also known as Hill 150), immediately\r\nnorth. Approximately 1,600 yards away from the MLR, Reno was the\r\ncentral of the three outposts and also the one most distant from\r\nMarine lines. West to east, critical terrain consisted of five enemy\r\npositions--Hills 31, 67, 25A, 190, and 153--and friendly companion\r\noutpost Vegas, on the right flank. (See Map 25.)\r\n\r\nTwo main trenches led into the outpost, a reverse slope fortification.\r\nThe forward trench, perpendicular to the ridgeline fronting the\r\nposition, was approximately 20 yards long and 8 feet deep. The second,\r\nto the rear and about the same length, traversed the outpost in an\r\neast-west direction. Approaching from the entrance, or “Gate” of the\r\nMLR, the two trenches joined on the left, forming a 90 degree angle.\r\nA cave, located in the arc between the trenches, provided overcrowded\r\nliving quarters where personnel slept either on the dirt floor or atop\r\nsandbags, since there were no bunkers at Reno. Ammunition supplies, as\r\nwell as the corpsman’s first aid facilities, were cached in the cave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 25      K. WHITE\r\n\r\nCOP RENO\r\n\r\nMarch 1953]\r\n\r\nA major blocking position, some 100 yards south, and to the rear of\r\nReno itself was covered by troops posted in the trenchline. Left of the\r\nforward trench, protective wire was placed across the topographical\r\ncrest. This left finger had good observation to Ungok and Arrowhead\r\nbut also served as an approach to Carson. Most likely enemy approach,\r\nhowever, was considered to be the ridgeline from Hill 150, on the\r\nnorth. The Seoul road, rear trenchline, and valley to the right were\r\nalternate approaches. Twenty-four hour security at Reno included an\r\nautomatic rifleman at the Gate, at Post 1, on the forward trench, and\r\nPost 2, which was at the extreme right of the rear trench. Ten machine\r\ngunners were also detailed as night watch on the guns. During the\r\ndaytime they were responsible for maintenance of ammunition and weapons\r\nwhich consisted of 18 M-1 rifles, 6 BARs, 5 A-4 LMGs, 2 flamethrowers,\r\n1 carbine, and 7 pistols.\r\n\r\nThe biggest defense problem at Reno stemmed from restricted fields of\r\nfire. Able gun, for instance, covered the rear of the topographical\r\ncrest and Hills 31 and 67, on the left. But dead space masked its\r\neffectiveness practically from the base of Hill 67 to the gun itself.\r\nThe Baker gun, protecting the reverse slope, had a lateral firing range\r\nof from 10 to 30 feet. Charlie gun maintained an unlimited sector of\r\nfire, approximately 180 degrees, and Dog gun covered the rear. As\r\nthere were no prepared machine gun positions, they were fired from the\r\nparapet protecting both the fighting holes and firing positions in the\r\ntrenchline. Two fighting holes were manned by BARs and two were used as\r\nmachine gun posts.\r\n\r\nCustomarily 40 to 43 men were on duty at COP Reno. In fact this number\r\nhad been viewed dubiously as being “far too many to man defensive\r\npositions at any one time,” by the commanding officer of the 1/5\r\nWeapons Company during a survey earlier in the month, noting that\r\n“about 20 could adequately defend the position.”[362] A six-man force\r\nwas detailed as a permanent working party for the improvement of\r\nfortifications. Sound power phones linked all positions and field\r\nphones connected the forward observer with gun positions. Overall, for\r\nproper defense, Reno depended heavily upon support fires from Carson\r\nand Vegas, on its right flank. Morale was considered “very good to\r\nexcellent” with Reno personnel being relieved every 8 to 10 days.\r\n\r\n    [362] 1/5 ComdD, Mar 53, Inspection of COP Reno Report, by Capt\r\n          Henry A. Checklou, dtd 12 Mar 53, p. 4.\r\n\r\nVegas (Hill 21), the highest of the three outposts, was located\r\napproximately 1,310 yards in front of the MLR. Observation of the\r\nsurrounding terrain from the east slope of enemy Hill 190 on the north,\r\nclockwise to the ridge south of Reno had been pronounced “excellent”\r\non an inspection trip made earlier the day the outposts were attacked.\r\nFrom north to south this observation included in its 180-degree sweep,\r\nenemy hill mass 57 to the right, friendly outpost Berlin, the MLR, key\r\nMarine defense highpoints, Hills 229 and 181 in the 1st Marines rear\r\nsector, and intervening terrain. (See Map 26.)\r\n\r\nThe north-south ridge leading to COP Reno masked the view from Vegas\r\non the west. To the north full observation was partially limited by\r\noutpost Reno itself and enemy Hills 150, 153, and 190. The latter was\r\nparticularly strategic for two reasons. First, it shielded a major\r\nassembly area. And, although the Chinese had observation of the entire\r\nright battalion MLR from Hill 190 on the north, Vegas prevented enemy\r\nclose-in view of Marine rear areas. It also dominated the approach to\r\na major Marine observation point, Hill 126, to the rear of the front\r\nlines in the western part of the 3/5 sector.\r\n\r\nOrganized as a perimeter defense, Vegas was surrounded by 250 yards\r\nof trenchline. The forward, or north trench, averaged four feet in\r\ndepth but deepened to about eight feet as it progressed to the rear.\r\nThe most solidly constructed part was the western portion. A center\r\ncommunication trench was in good condition between the rear and\r\ntopographical crest. From this point to the forward trench its depth\r\ndecreased to about four feet. The trench leading back to the MLR, about\r\nfive feet deep and two wide, was in good condition. A total of 13\r\nfighting holes had been constructed.\r\n\r\nOutpost troops, numbering approximately 40, consisted of six fire\r\nteams, heavy weapons and machine gunners, two 81mm mortar crews and two\r\nartillery observers, one corpsman, and a wireman at night. Strength\r\nwas reduced during the day, with replacements to make up the normal\r\ncomplement arriving on position early each evening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 26      K. WHITE\r\n\r\nCOP VEGAS\r\n\r\nMarch 1953]\r\n\r\nMajor approaches to Vegas included the large draws to the west and\r\nnorth of the outpost, the ridgeline to the COP from Hill 153 to the\r\nnorthwest, and the rear trenchline. Several ancillary trenchlines to\r\nthe east tended to reinforce this latter approach. A hindrance to the\r\nenemy, however, was the slope leading into the draw west of the\r\noutpost. For security purposes, the perimeter was divided into three\r\nsectors, each manned by two fire teams augmented by heavy weapons\r\npersonnel. The outpost detachment stood nighttime posts on a 50 percent\r\nbasis and remained within the several living bunkers or other shelters\r\nduring daylight hours because of heavy shelling and sniper fire.\r\nIncessant enemy pressure at the exposed outpost made it expedient to\r\nrotate infantry Marines at Vegas every three days and observers, at the\r\nend of four or five days.\r\n\r\nWeapons on position included two flamethrowers, one 3.5-inch bazooka,\r\nfour machine guns, three pistols, and other small arms. Fields of fire\r\nat Vegas, rated fair to good, were generally restricted due to the\r\nproximity of overheading. Most of the light machine guns had plunging\r\nfields of fire except for the approach along the ridgeline from Hill\r\n153, covered by grazing fire. A fighting hole to the left of Able Gate,\r\nwhich overlooked the trenchline leading to the MLR, was manned during\r\nthe day. No other sentries or listening posts were in effect. Nine\r\nsound power phones were operative. Three were located in the CP bunker\r\n(connecting to C/1/5, G/3/5, and the CP net); one, each, at the four\r\nmain posts, the rear Able Gate, and the cave.\r\n\r\nOther than periodic work being done by 10 Korean Service Corps\r\npersonnel in clearing out the trenches, no construction was in process\r\nat Vegas. KSCs, lugging their traditional A-frames and guided by\r\nMarines, also ran a nightly “supply train” to Vegas as they did to\r\nCarson and Reno. Sufficient personnel manned the outpost for adequate\r\ndefense, although an inspecting officer opined that the “one 3.5 rocket\r\nlauncher on position did not appear to be necessary for defense of this\r\ntype position.”[363]\r\n\r\n    [363] 1/5 ComdD, Mar 53, Inspection of COP Vegas Report, by\r\n          Capt Henry A. Checklou, on 26 Mar, dtd 31 Mar 53, p. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chinese Assault of 26 March_[364]\r\n\r\n    [364] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9; 1stMarDiv\r\n          ComdD, Mar 53; 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl, 26–27 Mar 53; 1stMarDiv\r\n          PIR 883, dtd 27 Mar 53; 1st MAW PIRs 86-53, dtd 27\r\n          Mar 53, 87-53, dtd 28 Mar 53; 1stMar, 5thMar, 7thMar,\r\n          11thMar, 1/1, 2/1, 3/1, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 2/7, 1/11, 2/11,\r\n          3/11, 4/11, 1st TkBn ComdDs, Mar 53; 1stMar SAR, 18–28\r\n          Mar 53; 5thMar SAR “Cities”; Fugate, “Vegas.”\r\n\r\nUntil the final days of March, the CCF units opposite the 5th Marines\r\nhad shown little aggressiveness. Regimental reports had officially\r\ncited Chinese actions as having been “extremely limited” other than\r\ntheir expected resistance to patrols and the Marine ITEM raid staged\r\nearlier in the month by the 1/5 two-platoon unit on Hill 31A, part of\r\nthe Ungok complex. The enemy posture had, in fact, been described as\r\none “reluctant to meet our patrols except in their positions.”[365]\r\n\r\n    [365] 1/5 ComdD, Mar 53, dtd 4 Apr 53, p. 2.\r\n\r\nA regimental patrol policy early in March established as SOP a minimum\r\nof four reconnaissance and two combat patrols in each MLR battalion\r\nsector daily. Nevertheless, 3/5 had reported no contact with the enemy\r\nfor the three-day period prior to the attack which was launched at 1900\r\non 26 March. Since the middle of the month, 1/5 had conducted nearly a\r\ndozen night combat patrols and ambushes in one- and two-squad strength\r\nto test the enemy in the Carson-Reno-Vegas area. Terminology of the\r\noperation orders read that the Marines were to make contact, capture\r\nprisoners, and deny the ground to the enemy, an injunction that--in\r\nview of events shortly to transpire--was to turn out more prophetic\r\nthan anticipated.\r\n\r\nThat last Thursday in March 1953 was clear, almost unseasonably warm.\r\nJust after darkness had settled down over the Korean ridges, gullies,\r\nMLR, outposts, and rice paddies, the enemy suddenly made his presence\r\nknown. Up until that time it had been an average day of activity, and\r\nthere had been no especially ominous overtones to the start of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, at 1900, small arms and machine gun fire cracked from enemy\r\nstrongholds on Hills 44, 40, 35, and 33, and tore into the left and\r\ncenter part of the 1/5 sector. Almost immediately, a heavy mortar and\r\nartillery preparation of 15 minutes duration exploded all along the 5th\r\nMarines MLR. A Chinese rifle platoon and half a dozen machine guns on\r\nHill 140, about 500 yards west of Kumgok, directed additional fire on\r\nthe sector.\r\n\r\nAt the same time 5th Marines outposts Carson and Reno, each manned by\r\na reinforced rifle platoon from C/1/5, came under attack from Chinese\r\nmortars and 76mm artillery. Approximately 1,200 mortar rounds struck\r\nCOP Carson by 1920. As men of D/2/5, some of whom had been detailed\r\nto Carson earlier that night for an ambush, reported, “one round per\r\nsecond from Chinese 60mm and 82mm landed in or around [our] position\r\nduring the first 20 minutes of the engagement. Thereafter, one round\r\nwas received every 40 seconds until about 2200.”[366] Interdiction\r\nfires also raked Marine rear areas and supply routes. Counterbattery\r\nfire struck Marine direct support artillery positions in the 5th’s\r\nregimental sector while heavy shelling of the MLR and its battalion\r\nCPs shattered wire communication between those installations and their\r\nadvance outposts.\r\n\r\n    [366] 1/5 ComdD, Mar 53, p. 10.\r\n\r\nWithin ten minutes, Vegas, furthest east of the four OPs in 1/5\r\nterritory, became the object of serious enemy attention. Outposts\r\nBerlin and East Berlin, meanwhile, still further east in the 3/5 sector\r\nproper were also engaged by fire from hostile small arms and mortars\r\nfrom Chinese occupying Hills 15 (Detroit), 13 (Frisco), and 98 to the\r\nnortheast. As the coordinated fire attack raged throughout the 5th\r\nMarines regimental front, preparatory fire and diversionary probes hit\r\nthe 1st Marines sector. Outposts Hedy, Bunker, Esther, and Dagmar, in\r\nthe center regimental area, were struck by small arms, mortars, and\r\nartillery shells a few minutes before 1900. Platoon and squad strength\r\nlimited attacks were conducted against Dagmar, Hedy, and Esther, and\r\nenemy units were sighted moving in front of the KMC, further west along\r\nthe MLR.\r\n\r\nAt precisely 1910, a force of 3,500 Chinese from the 358th Regiment,\r\n120th Division, 46th CCF Army began to swarm down from Ungok,\r\nArrowhead, Hill 25A, and Hill 190 and launched a massive assault in\r\nregimental strength against the 5th Marines sector. (Map 27.) Elements\r\nof six companies from three battalions converged on the area from\r\nthree directions. Two enemy platoons of the 1st Company, 1st Battalion\r\nfrom Ungok struck Carson while one infantry company each, initially,\r\nbegan a direct assault on Reno and Vegas. Units from the 3d Company,\r\n1st Battalion, from Arrowhead and Hill 29, crossed the Seoul road to\r\nhit Reno in a direct frontal assault. Elements of the 7th Company, 3d\r\nBattalion moved down from Hill 190, a mile north, to encircle the left\r\nflank of Reno and thus strike from the rear of the Marine position.\r\nOther Chinese soldiers of the 8th Company, 3d Battalion, supported\r\nby the 9th Company, moved some 500 yards south of their ridgeline\r\npositions on Hill 25A and 155 immediately north of Vegas to attack the\r\noutpost head-on.\r\n\r\nAnother enemy unit, the 2d Company, 1st Battalion, swept south from\r\nHill 57A and made diversionary probes of the two most remote outposts\r\nof the entire 1st Marine Division line, Berlin and East Berlin in the\r\n3d Battalion sector. These two smaller positions, each manned by a\r\nreinforced squad-size detachment from G/3/5, were to be successful in\r\ndriving off the enemy’s less determined efforts there with a rain of\r\nsmall arms, mortar, and artillery fires.\r\n\r\nAs the enemy regiment advanced toward its objectives in a coordinated\r\nthree-pronged attack, Marine artillery fired protective boxes and\r\nVT on the outposts and routes of approach from the west, north, and\r\neast. Defending infantry also called down organic 60mm and 81mm mortar\r\nbarrages. Actually, prior to the Chinese onslaught at 1900, 1/11,\r\nthe direct support battalion (Lieutenant Colonel Olin W. Jones, Jr.)\r\nfor the 5th Marines, began a registration and had laid its howitzer\r\nfires on the active area. The artillery regiment had also set up\r\nconference calls linking its four organic battalions and supporting\r\nArmy units. The fire plan for the 11th Marines provided for its three\r\nlight battalions (1/11, 2/11, and 3/11) to cover enemy approaches and\r\nassembly areas, deliver protective boxing and VT fires requested by\r\nthe outposts, and furnish countermortar missions called in by forward\r\nobservers. Medium battalions (4/11 and the 623d Field Artillery)\r\nwere to reinforce defensive fires and destroy hostile mortars and\r\nartillery emplacements. Heavy 8-inch howitzer support (Battery C,\r\n17th FA Battalion and Battery A, of the 204th) would silence enemy\r\ncounterbattery weapons.\r\n\r\nAs it happened on the night of the 26th, Marine tanks, in addition\r\nto artillery, were also registered before the time of the actual\r\nattack. Eleven of Captain Hunter’s Company A tanks had earlier rumbled\r\ninto firing position on the MLR to provide mechanized support for an\r\ninfantry raid scheduled at dawn the next morning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 27      K. WHITE\r\n\r\nATTACKS ON 5TH MARINES FRONT\r\n\r\n26–30 MARCH 1953]\r\n\r\nDespite this immediate response of Marine fire support, the Chinese\r\ninvaders outnumbered the platoons holding the outposts by a 20 to 1\r\nratio. The sheer weight of numbers was the decisive factor. By 1935 the\r\nenemy had penetrated the lower trenches of both Carson and Reno. An\r\nhour after the onset of the attack, at 2000, the Marines were throwing\r\nback Chinese forces with bayonets, knives, rifles, and bare fists in\r\nthe close, heavy fighting at Carson. There, where 54 men had been\r\non duty at the time of initial attack, the outpost was successfully\r\nholding off the Communists. Four reinforcing squads quickly dispatched\r\nby battalion were designed to further strengthen the position. At 2000,\r\njust when D/1/5 and C/1/5 relief squads were leaving for the outpost,\r\nthe Chinese unexpectedly began to release their grip on Carson as they\r\nconcentrated on the two more isolated COPs, Reno and Vegas, that were\r\nfurther from the MLR.\r\n\r\nNo other attempt was made by the enemy to occupy Carson that night or\r\nthe next day. Barrage fires gradually ceased as the enemy began to\r\nwithdraw about 2135. Sporadic bursts of his 60mm and 82mm mortars and\r\n76mm guns, however, continued to rock the position until midnight.\r\n\r\nDevelopments at Reno and Vegas, by 2000, were vastly more ominous.\r\nAt Reno, two companies of CCF soldiers thrust into the position from\r\na frontal and flank attack. Within a half hour they made their way\r\ninto the trench defenses. Although VT fires placed on the outposts\r\nand WP flare shells outlined the enemy for the gunners, Chinese in\r\noverpowering numbers continued to batter the Marine post. Due to the\r\nlack of fighting trenches, bunkers, and to limited fields of fire,\r\nReno defenders fell back on a cave defense within a half hour of the\r\nassault.[367]\r\n\r\n    [367] At both Reno and Vegas the Marines had moved into the\r\n          caves for protection from VT fire. This was the plan in\r\n          event of an overwhelming enemy attack. In contrast, the\r\n          detachment at Carson fought from covered fighting holes\r\n          and employed the cave there only to get their wounded out\r\n          of direct fire. 5thMar SAR “Cities,” pp. 2–3.\r\n\r\nA message received at 2030, requesting more VT rounds and\r\nreinforcements, indicated that the enemy had sealed all entrances to\r\nthe cave and that the men were suffering from lack of air. Of the 40\r\nCompany C Marines on the outpost at the time of attack an hour and\r\na half earlier, only 7 were then reported still able to fight. More\r\nillumination to enable friendly machine guns and rockets to chop up\r\nthe enemy was furnished by artillery and a flare plane that arrived\r\non station at 2205. Two Marine tanks, in position behind Reno, were\r\nalerted and put their 90mm fires to good use on the enemy and his\r\nweapons emplacements.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at Vegas, the situation was also deteriorating. More than a\r\nhundred Chinese had moved up under the perimeter of exploding shells\r\nand Marine defensive fires into the lower trenches by 1950, less than\r\nan hour after the enemy’s first volley. Ten minutes later, the Marines\r\nwere forced to give way to the overwhelming number of enemy soldiers\r\nwhich began to swarm over the outpost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the sudden force and onslaught of the enemy,\r\ncommunication difficulties also plagued Marine detachments on the\r\noutposts, particularly at Vegas. Enemy mortar and artillery, aimed\r\nat the mainline CPs, had wrecked the ground lines. As early as 1940,\r\ncommunications between the 1st Battalion CP and Vegas went dead and\r\ncontinued to be broken despite repeated attempts to reestablish\r\ncontact. Carson and Reno also had wire troubles about this time, but\r\nradio contact was shortly established. For the most part, operational\r\nreports and orders during the night and early morning hours were sent\r\nover company and battalion tactical nets. The intensity of the Chinese\r\nfire was not restricted just to forward positions; the 1/5 CP, a mile\r\nsouth of the MLR, at one point received up to 100 rounds per minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reinforcements Dispatched_[368]\r\n\r\n    [368] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdD, Mar 53; 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl,\r\n          26–27 Mar 53; 1stMarDiv PIR 883, dtd 27 Mar 53; 1st MAW\r\n          PIR 86-53, dtd 27 Mar 53; 1stMar, 5thMar, 7thMar, 1/5,\r\n          2/5, 3/5, 2/7, 1/11 ComdDs, Mar 53; 1stMar SAR; 5thMar\r\n          SAR “Cities”; VMO-6, HMR-161 ComDs, Mar 53; MacDonald,\r\n          _POW_; USMC Biog.\r\n\r\nWhile the Marines on the outposts were trying to drive off the enemy,\r\nreinforcements back at the MLR and in the reserve ranks quickly saddled\r\nup. A F/2/5 advance platoon dispatched to Reno at 2015 by way of the\r\nReno Block was ambushed near Hill 47 an hour later by two enemy squads\r\nwhich had moved south to cut off Marine reinforcements. After a fire\r\nexchange, the platoon made its way to the blocking position. Another\r\nrelief unit, from Company C, 1st Battalion, that jumped off for Reno 15\r\nminutes later had poorer luck. The men had scarcely gone a half mile\r\nbefore being shelled. After briefly taking cover the Marines moved out\r\nagain, only to draw fire from the enemy at Hill 47. Advancing for a\r\nthird time, the Company C two-squad unit was again halted by fire from\r\ntwo hostile platoons. By this time 10 Marines had been wounded and\r\nevacuated.\r\n\r\nA D/2/5 reinforcement platoon ordered to Vegas, at 2129, encountered\r\nstrong opposition in the Block vicinity, but it threw back the enemy\r\nin hand-to-hand fighting and prevented him from gaining fire supremacy\r\nat the position. Leading units of F/2/5, meanwhile, had been ordered\r\nto operational control of 1/5 to augment the earlier Company C platoon\r\nat the Block and then move north with them to Reno. After being issued\r\nammunition and hand grenades at the Company C supply point, the “F” 1st\r\nPlatoon left the MLR at 2227, with the 2d Platoon filing out in column\r\n400 yards behind them. Under a constant rain of 76mm artillery and 82mm\r\nand 122mm mortar shells--and with casualties for one platoon reaching\r\nas high as 70 percent within minutes--the F/2/5 men fought their way\r\ninto the trenches at the Block. Here they joined the depleted ranks of\r\nCompany C which had established a base of fire. Despite the incessant\r\nbarrage of Chinese incoming that continued to inflict heavy casualties,\r\nthe Marines maintained their precarious grip on the Block and cleared\r\nout large numbers of Chinese attempting to infiltrate the trenches and\r\napproaches from the north and south to the Marine position.\r\n\r\nWhile the Reno and Vegas relief units were pinned down at the Block,\r\nthe situation at the outposts remained critical. Throughout the night\r\nnew waves of Communist soldiers poured out from their positions behind\r\nChogum-ni, Hills 31 and 31D. When a company of enemy troops were\r\nobserved at 2100 massing near Chogum-ni for a new assault, it was\r\nquickly disposed of by Marine artillery and Company A tankers. At Reno\r\nwhere the immediate situation was the most grim, a message at 2145\r\nreported the enemy still in the trenches, trying to dig down into the\r\ncave while the Marines were attempting to work their way out by hand.\r\nThe final report from Reno received late that night, about 2300, was\r\nweak and could not be understood.\r\n\r\nAt Vegas, meanwhile, communications failure continued to complicate\r\ndefensive measures at the outpost. Because of this, on the order of\r\nregimental commander, Colonel Walt, operational control had been\r\ntransferred, at 2119, from 1/5 to 3/5. Three minutes before midnight\r\nall contact with Vegas was lost. As with Reno, reinforcements sent out\r\nwith the mission of buttressing the Vegas detachment had been delayed.\r\nWhen it became evident that the Company D platoon had been pinned down\r\nat the Block, a platoon from E/2/5 jumped off at 2323 for the Vegas\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nShored up to reinforced company strength, the composite unit at the\r\nBlock had prepared to move on for the ultimate relief of C/1/5 forces\r\nat Reno. Chinese firepower and troops continued to lash the position,\r\nhowever. There seemed to be no limit to the number of reserve troops\r\nthe enemy could throw into the attack. At 2157, two Chinese platoons\r\nhad hit the Block. Twenty minutes later, another two platoons struck.\r\nBy 2300, the Marines had repulsed three attacks, numbering more than\r\n200 troops, amid a continuing withering avalanche of bullets and\r\nshells. Shortly before midnight, a full enemy company had deployed\r\nsouth from Reno to the Block, but had been largely cut down by friendly\r\n90mm tank fire and VT rounds from 1/11. Reinforced and reorganized, the\r\nMarines again prepared for a counterpunch on Reno.\r\n\r\nBy midnight on the 26th, after five blistering hours of battle--to\r\ndevelop into five days of intense conflict and continuing\r\ncounterattacks--the early efforts of the enemy were partly successful.\r\nTwo of the Nevada Hill outposts had fallen, and Marine attempts to\r\nstrengthen them were initially being thwarted by Chinese troops that\r\nhad overflowed the Block and southward toward the MLR. COP Carson was\r\nholding. But the enemy was in control of Reno and Vegas and was using\r\nthe Reno position to mass troops and firepower to further brace his\r\ncontinuing assault on Vegas.\r\n\r\nInitially, the 5th Marines had expected to launch an immediate\r\ncounterattack to regain Reno. In the early hours of the 27th, however,\r\nit became apparent this plan would have to be revised. Reinforcing\r\nelements from the 5th Marines, composed largely of F/2/5, had been\r\nunable to mount out effectively from the Block for Reno. At 0144, the\r\ncommanding officer of Company F, Captain Ralph L. Walz, reported he\r\nhad one platoon left. Between then and 0220 his diminishing unit had\r\nrallied for attack three times. It had successively engaged the enemy\r\nin fire fights, one of 30 minutes’ duration, evacuated its wounded,\r\nregrouped, and then had come under heavy incoming again. Countermortar\r\nfire had been requested and delivered on active enemy positions at\r\nArrowhead, Hills 29, 45, and 21B, some 500 yards northwest of Vegas.\r\n\r\nBut as the Marines girded their defending platoon at the Block\r\nto company-plus size, the Chinese had done likewise, throwing in\r\ncontinuous rounds of new mortar attacks and additional troops. When,\r\nat 0246, another hostile company was seen spreading south from Reno\r\ntoward the Block, the 1st Battalion directed artillery fires on the\r\nenemy and ordered its troops to disengage and return to the MLR. By\r\n0300, early efforts to retake Reno were suspended. Relief forces from\r\nCompanies F and C were on their way back to the battalion area. Ground\r\naction had ceased.\r\n\r\nDuring these early attempts to rescue Reno and its defenders on the\r\nnight of 26–27 March, Marine elements had struggled for more than four\r\nhours trying to get to Reno, but the enemy had completely surrounded\r\nit. At Reno itself, the Marine in command of the outpost when the\r\nChinese struck, Second Lieutenant Rufus A. Seymour, machine gun platoon\r\ncommander of C/1/5, had been taken prisoner along with several of his\r\nmen. Of the Marines originally on duty there, all but five had been\r\nkilled. Casualties of the Reno reinforcing units were later estimated\r\nby the regimental commander as being “as high as 35 percent, with many\r\ndead.”[369]\r\n\r\n    [369] Statement by LtGen Lewis W. Walt, as cited in Eloise\r\n          Engle, _Medic_ (New York, N.Y.: John Day, May 1967), p.\r\n          211.\r\n\r\nA 21-year-old Navy hospital corpsman from Alexandria, Virginia,[370]\r\nattached to a Company C relief platoon from 1/5, helped save many\r\nMarine lives that night in the Reno Block area. He was Hospitalman\r\nFrancis C. Hammond, who lost his own life but was awarded posthumously\r\nthe nation’s highest honor for bravery under fire. For more than four\r\nexhausting hours the young hospitalman helped others to safety, even\r\nthough he had been struck early in the fighting and was hobbling around\r\nwith a leg injury. When his unit was ordered to withdraw from its\r\nattack against a strongly fortified CCF position, Hammond skillfully\r\ndirected the evacuation of wounded Marines and remained behind to\r\nassist other corpsmen. Shell fragments from a mortar blast struck him,\r\nthis time, fatally.\r\n\r\n    [370] In 1956, a newly-completed school in Alexandria, Virginia\r\n          was named the Francis C. Hammond High School and\r\n          dedicated in his memory.\r\n\r\nThe Vegas reinforcing units, in those dark early hours of the 27th,\r\nhad come closer to their objective. Shortly after midnight two\r\nplatoons, composed of elements from D/2/5 and C/1/5, had reached a\r\npoint 400 yards from the outpost, in the vicinity of the entrance\r\nto the communication trench. When the enemy threw in powerful new\r\nassault forces at Vegas, F/2/7, a company from the regimental reserve,\r\ncame under operational control of 3/5 and moved out from the MLR to\r\nreinforce the position. By 0300 the first relief platoon, despite\r\nheavy and continuing Chinese barrages, got to within 200 yards of the\r\noutpost. At this time, however, it was found that the enemy was in\r\ncontrol of Vegas as well as Reno. Marines from D/2/5, C/1/5, E/2/5, and\r\nF/2/7 relief forces, on order, began to pull back to the MLR at 0417.\r\nInitial attempts to regain control of the two outposts were temporarily\r\nhalted, and instead it was decided to launch a coordinated daylight\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time, 0430, the boundary between 1/5 and 3/5 was\r\nmoved 250 yards westward to give 3/5 total responsibility for Vegas,\r\nalthough operational control had been transferred seven hours earlier\r\nthe previous night.\r\n\r\nEnemy casualties for the eight hours of action were heavy. An estimated\r\n600 Chinese had been wounded and killed. Marine losses were also heavy.\r\nIn the action First Lieutenant Kenneth E. Taft, Jr., Officer-in-Charge\r\nat Vegas, was killed and, as it was later learned, some of his H/3/5\r\ndefenders had been captured by the Chinese. By midnight the two\r\nline battalions, 3/5 and 1/5, had reported a total of nearly 150\r\ncasualties,[371] and this figure did not include those wounded or\r\nkilled from the relief platoons and companies being shuttled into\r\naction from the 2/5 reserve battalion. One platoon from E/2/5 had\r\narrived at the Company C supply point about 0210 and, together with a\r\nprovisional unit from Headquarters and Service Company, 1/5, began to\r\nevacuate casualties in front of the MLR. By 0325, a total of 56 wounded\r\nhad passed through the C/1/5 aid station and a cryptic entry in the\r\nG-3 journal noted that “more who are able are going back to assist in\r\nevacuation of casualties.”\r\n\r\n    [371] 1/5 and 3/5 ComdDs, Mar 53. At this time 1/5 had suffered\r\n          5 killed, 30 wounded, 21 wounded not evacuated, 39\r\n          missing (personnel at Reno), or 95. Reports from 3/5\r\n          showed 1 killed, 8 wounded/evacuated, and 40 missing (at\r\n          Vegas), or 49.\r\n\r\nSimilar recovery efforts were being made at the same time in the\r\n3d Battalion. Two alternate routes for evacuation were in effect.\r\nFrom a checkpoint located just south of the MLR in the H/3/5 sector,\r\ncasualties were taken to the Company H supply point and thence to\r\nthe battalion aid station, or else to the KSC camp from which they\r\nwere evacuated to the 1st Battalion aid station. VMO-6 and HMR-161\r\nhelicopters flew out the critically-injured to USS _Haven_ and\r\n_Consolation_ hospital ships at Inchon Harbor and transported blood\r\nfrom supply points to Medical Companies A, E, and C forward stations.\r\nExcepting the original personnel killed or missing at Reno and Vegas,\r\n1st Battalion forces from Companies C and F dispatched to Reno had\r\nreturned to the MLR by 0445. Vegas units, ordered to disengage later\r\nthan the Reno reinforcements, were back by 0530.\r\n\r\nDiversionary probes by the Chinese during the night of the 26th at the\r\n3/5 right flank outposts Berlin and East Berlin, as well as in the 1st\r\nMarines sector, had been beaten back by the Marines. Following the\r\npreassault fire at 1900, a CCF company had sent two platoons against\r\nBerlin and one against satellite East Berlin, both manned by Company\r\nG. These reinforced squad outposts, both only about 325 yards forward\r\nof the MLR, had stymied the enemy’s attempts. Boxing fires and VT on\r\napproach routes had forced the Chinese to retreat at 2115. Ten minutes\r\nlater Company G reported that communication, which had temporarily gone\r\nout, had been restored. One squad dispatched by the 3d Battalion to\r\nBerlin and a second, to East Berlin an hour later, further buttressed\r\nthe companion positions.\r\n\r\nAction in the 1st Marines center regimental sector had also been\r\nrelatively brief. Immediately after the 1900 mortar and artillery\r\npreparation, the Chinese in company strength attempted to penetrate\r\noutposts Hedy, Bunker, Esther, and Dagmar. Shelling had been heaviest\r\nat Dagmar and, shortly after 1900, two squads of Chinese began to\r\nassault the outpost with automatic weapons and satchel charges. Machine\r\nguns positioned on enemy Hills 44, 114, and 116 and small arms fire\r\nfrom Hill 108 supported the attack. The enemy was hurled back at all\r\nplaces except Dagmar where approximately 25 Chinese breached the wire\r\nentanglement.\r\n\r\nTwo hours of intense, close fighting in the trenches followed as the\r\n27 defending Marines, directed by outpost commander Second Lieutenant\r\nBenjamin H. Murray of I/3/1, strongly resisted the invaders. More\r\nthan 300 rounds of mortar and artillery fire supported the action. A\r\ncounterattack from the MLR led by the I/3/1 executive officer, Second\r\nLieutenant John J. Peeler, restored the position, and at 2120 the CCF\r\nfinally withdrew. Less determined efforts had been made by the enemy\r\nat Esther and Bunker. By 2200 the Chinese had departed from the scene\r\nthere, too. Altogether, the 1st Marines sector skirmishes had cost the\r\nCCF 10 killed, 20 estimated killed, and 17 estimated wounded to Marine\r\ncasualties of 4 killed and 16 wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Massed Counterattack the Next Day_[372]\r\n\r\n    [372] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdD, Mar 53; 1stMarDiv G-3\r\n          Jnls, 27 Mar 53; 1stMarDiv PIR Nos. 882–4, dtd 26–28\r\n          Mar 53; 1st MAW PIR 86-53, dtd 27 Mar 53, 87-53, dtd 28\r\n          Mar 53, 88-53, dtd 29 Mar 53; 5thMar, 7thMar, 11thMar,\r\n          1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 2/7, 1/11, 2/11, 3/11, 4/11, 1st TkBn\r\n          ComdDs, Mar 53; 5thMar SAR “Cities”; 11thMar “Artillery\r\n          in the Defense of Outpost Vegas, 26–30 Mar 53,” hereafter\r\n          11thMar SAR “Arty Defense”; MAGs-12, -33, VMAs-212,\r\n          -323; VMFs-115, -311, VMF(N)-513 ComdDs, Mar 53; Fugate,\r\n          “Vegas”; USMC Biog.\r\n\r\nWhile the 5th Marines reorganized during the morning hours of the\r\n27th for a new attack to recapture the lost outposts, General Pollock\r\nordered mortars, tanks, and artillery, including rockets, to neutralize\r\nthe Reno and Vegas areas and enemy approaches.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the 1900 attack the preceding evening until the\r\ntemporary break in fighting eight hours later, at 0300, early estimates\r\nindicated 5,000 rounds of enemy mixed fire had been received in the\r\n“Wild” sector (code name for the 5th Marines, and appropriate it was\r\nfor this late-March period). And this did not include the vast number\r\nof shells that had fallen on the three Nevada COPs. During the same\r\nperiod 1/11, in direct support of the 5th, reported it had delivered\r\nsome 4,209 rounds on the enemy. Throughout the early hours, two\r\nbattalions from the 11th Marines continued to pound away at Reno and\r\nVegas with neutralizing fires to soften enemy positions, deter his\r\nresupply efforts, and silence those mortars and batteries that were\r\ntroubling the Marines.\r\n\r\nBy 0330 observation planes from VMO-6 had made 28 flights behind\r\nenemy lines which enabled artillery spotters to direct nearly 60 fire\r\nmissions on CCF active artillery, mortars, and self-propelled guns.\r\nFrom nightfall on the 26th through 0600 the following morning a total\r\nof 10,222 rounds of all calibers had been fired by Marine cannoneers\r\nsupporting the 1st Division in its ground battles from Berlin to Hedy.\r\n\r\nRevised intelligence reports from the 5th Marines S-2, Major Murray\r\nO. Roe, meanwhile, indicated that between 1900 on the 26th and 0400\r\nthe next day the Chinese had sent 14,000 rounds of mixed mortar and\r\nartillery crashing into Marine positions. It was also determined that a\r\nreinforced regiment had initially hit the Carson, Reno, and Vegas posts.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 27th, at 0345 as the 5th Marines prepared for the\r\ncounterattack, the division reserve, 2/7 (Lieutenant Colonel Alexander\r\nD. Cereghino), was placed under operational control of the 5th Marines.\r\n(Previously put on alert the battalion had moved into an assembly area\r\nbehind 1/5 shortly after midnight, and its F/2/7 had taken part in the\r\npredawn relief attempt.) During the early morning hours a section of\r\nSkyknights, from Lieutenant Colonel Conley’s night fighter squadron,\r\nVMF(N)-513, had made radar controlled bombing runs to strike CCF\r\nartillery positions in the Hill 190 area and enemy troops at Hill 98.\r\nPrecisely at 0650, friendly Panthers from VMF-115 began arriving on\r\nstation to help the neutralizing artillery fire on Reno and Vegas.\r\nOriginally, a dawn ground attack had been envisioned for Reno, but that\r\nwas delayed to wait for air support.\r\n\r\nA tentative H-Hour was set for 0900 with a dual jump-off for both\r\nReno and Vegas. At 0930 the attacks still had not begun due to\r\ncommunication difficulties. While division Marines were waiting to get\r\noff the ground, 1st MAW pilots were enjoying a busy morning. By 0930,\r\nsix four-plane air strikes had been completed by VMF-115 (Lieutenant\r\nColonel Stoddard G. Cortelyou) and -311 (Lieutenant Colonel Francis\r\nK. Coss) plus sorties by Air Force Thunderjets. Tankers from Company\r\nA had also gotten in a few licks when two groups of Chinese were seen\r\ncarrying logs for bunker support into Reno; one group was wiped out,\r\nthe other got by.\r\n\r\nShortly after 1100, friendly artillery batteries began delivering\r\nsmoke on Hills 57A and 190, two enemy high points of observation. The\r\nfire plan was modified to eliminate an early 10-minute preparation on\r\nobjective areas. (Basically, the artillery plan for counterattack was\r\nthat employed in the 19 March Operation ITEM raid on Ungok, because\r\nof the proximity of Ungok to the Vegas hills. This plan consisted of\r\nmassed fires on the objective, with countermortar and counterbattery\r\nfires on known artillery positions. To this prearranged plan were added\r\nthose new mortar and counterbattery targets located by air observers\r\nduring the night of 26–27 March.) This time, the preparatory fires were\r\nto be on call, as was the 90mm fire support from the tankers. A further\r\nchange was made when it was decided to limit the assault to Vegas and\r\nnot retake Reno but rather neutralize it by fire.\r\n\r\nWhile artillery, air, mortars, and tanks pounded the objective, assault\r\nelements of D/2/5 from the regimental reserve, under Captain John B.\r\nMelvin, prepared for jump-off. At 1120 the company crossed the line\r\nof departure in the 3/5 sector of the MLR and immediately came under\r\nheavy fires from enemy infantry and artillery units. Within a half\r\nhour after leaving the battalion front for Vegas, Dog Company had\r\nbeen pinned down by Chinese 76mm artillery, had picked itself up, and\r\nbeen stopped again by a plastering of 60mm and 82mm shells falling\r\neverywhere in its advance. By 1210 only nine men were left in Captain\r\nMelvin’s 1st Platoon to carry on the fight. The Marine unit continued\r\nto claw its way through the rain-swollen rice paddies and up the muddy\r\nslopes leading from the MLR to within 200 yards of the outpost. In 10\r\nminutes, heavy incoming began to take its inevitable toll and enemy\r\nreinforcements were flowing towards Vegas from the CCF assembly point\r\non Hill 153.\r\n\r\nBetween noon and 1300, four enemy groups of varying size had pushed\r\nsouth from Hill 153 to Vegas. At this time still another group,\r\nof company size, moved in with its automatic weapons and mortars.\r\nWithin the next 15 minutes, a reinforced CCF platoon made its\r\nway from the Reno trench to Vegas while still another large unit\r\nattempted to reinforce from Hill 21B. As enemy incoming swept the\r\nslopes and approaches to Vegas, Marine artillery and tank guns fired\r\ncounterbattery missions to silence the Chinese weapons. In the skies,\r\nVMA-121 ADs and the sleek jet fighters from MAG-33 squadrons VMF-115\r\nand -311 continued to pinpoint their target coordinates for destruction\r\nof enemy mortars, trenches, personnel bunkers, and troops.\r\n\r\nBack at the battalion CP two more companies were being readied to\r\ncontinue the Vegas assault. The Provisional Company of 2/5, commanded\r\nby Captain Floyd G. Hudson, moved out at 1215. Close on its heels,\r\nE/2/5 left the Company H checkpoint in the 3/5 sector for the zone of\r\naction. At 1305 the counterattack for Vegas was raging in earnest, with\r\nCompany D riflemen on the lower slopes, chewing into the enemy with\r\ntheir grenades, BARs, M-1s, and carbines. Two hours after the original\r\njump off time, four Marines crawled out of the trenches at Vegas and by\r\n1322 were going over the top, despite incoming that “literally rained\r\non the troops.” Assault commander Melvin recalled:\r\n\r\n  It was so intense at times that you couldn’t move forward or\r\n  backward. The Chinese 60mm mortars began to bother us about\r\n  as much as firecrackers. It was the 120mm mortars and 122mm\r\n  artillery that hurt the most. The noise was deafening. They\r\n  would start walking the mortars toward us from every direction\r\n  possible. You could only hope that the next round wouldn’t be on\r\n  target.[373]\r\n\r\n    [373] Fugate, “Vegas,” p. 20.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Company E, 5th Marines, under Captain Herbert M. Lorence,\r\nhad moved up from the rear and, at 1440, was ordered to pass through\r\nCompany D ranks, evacuate casualties, continue the attack, and secure\r\nthe crest of Vegas. Although Captain Lorence’s men succeeded in moving\r\ninto Company D positions, the deluge of Chinese mortar and artillery\r\nwas so heavy that Company E was unable to advance beyond this point.\r\nAt 1530, a new Marine company, F/2/7 (Captain Ralph F. Estey), was\r\ndispatched from the MLR to buttress the assault. By this time elements\r\nof D/2/5 had reached the right finger of Vegas but were again pinned\r\ndown by intensive enemy artillery and mortars.\r\n\r\nWithin the first hour after leaving the battalion line, the Company F\r\nMarines nearly reached the advanced positions of 2/5, and Company D,\r\nwhich had been in the vanguard since 1100, returned to the regimental\r\nCP. During the next hour, however, heavy shelling slowed the Marine\r\nadvance. At 1730, as Company F prepared to make its first major\r\nassault, a deluge of 60mm and 82mm mortar shells, 76mm and 122mm\r\nbursts, and machine gun bullets rained on the troops. As the men\r\ncrawled forward slowly, planes from VMA-323 which had arrived on scene\r\ntwo hours earlier, continued to smoke the enemy’s posts on Hills 190\r\nand 139. Captain Hunter’s tanks also moved into their MLR positions to\r\nzero in their 90mm rifles on the CCF stronghold at the Vegas northern\r\ncrest.\r\n\r\nBy 1800, Company F was continuing the Marine counterattack to regain\r\nVegas and was approximately 400 yards from the outpost summit.\r\nCombining with Company E Marines, for a total strength of three\r\nplatoons in position, Captain Estey was able to retake part of the\r\nobjective. After an intense 90-minute fire fight and hand-to-hand\r\nfighting in the lower trenches, E/2/7 advanced to the right of the\r\noutpost where at 1930 it began to consolidate. In the next half hour,\r\ntwo platoons of Company F moved out from the right finger of Vegas\r\nto within 50 yards of the peak, before being forced back by Chinese\r\nmachine gun fire and mortars lobbed from the Able (left) gate on\r\nVegas. The enemy company occupying the outpost resisted the attacking\r\nMarines with mortars, grenades, and small arms fire. In addition, the\r\nCCF employed firing positions at Reno for their machine guns, heavy\r\nmortars, and artillery supporting the Vegas defense and periodically\r\nreinforced their troops from the newly captured Reno outpost.\r\n\r\nIt was a busy night for Marines and corpsmen alike. One, whose\r\nsplit-second improvisations in the blazing zone of action were in the\r\nbest Hippocratic tradition, was Hospital Corpsman Third Class William\r\nR. Charette. Attached to F/2/7, he was assisting a Marine when an\r\nenemy grenade landed but a few feet away. Charette immediately threw\r\nhimself on the injured man, taking the full shock of the missile with\r\nhis own body. Since the force of the blast had ripped away his helmet\r\nand medical aid kit, he tore off his clothing to make bandages. Another\r\ntime, while attending a seriously wounded Marine whose armored vest\r\nhad been blown off, the hospitalman removed his own to place around\r\nthe injured man. Without armored vest or helmet, Charette continued\r\nto accompany his platoon in the assault. As a Marine observer, Staff\r\nSergeant Robert S. Steigerwald, commented, “HM3 Charette was everyplace\r\nseemingly at the same time, performing inexhaustibly.”[374]\r\n\r\n    [374] Statement cited in personnel record of HMC(SS) William\r\n          R. Charette, USN. He was the only corpsman during the\r\n          Korean War who was awarded the Medal of Honor and lived\r\n          to receive it.\r\n\r\nThroughout the night the enemy counterattacked but was unsuccessful\r\nin driving the Marines off the outpost. Between 1830 and midnight,\r\nF/2/7 repulsed three enemy onslaughts and engaged in sporadic fire\r\nfights. Although pushed back from the summit, Company F Marines set up\r\na perimeter defense at the base of Vegas where the troops dug in for\r\nthe rest of the night. Their opposite numbers, from 1st MAW, were also\r\non the scene. As follow-up to the day’s unremitting air bombardment of\r\nenemy installations, night fighters of VMF(N)-513 and MAG-12 Corsairs\r\nfrom VMAs-212 and -323 made nine MPQ strikes between 1830 and 0115\r\nunleashing 24½ tons of explosives on CCF hill defenses and supply\r\nstrongpoints.\r\n\r\nGradually, heavy incoming on Vegas began to lift, and from midnight\r\nthrough the early hours of the following morning most of the enemy’s\r\nartillery and mortar fires switched from Vegas to the Marine companies\r\non the MLR. Intermittent small arms fire still cracked and punctuated\r\nthe night from enemy positions on Hills 57A, Detroit, and Frisco, to\r\nthe northeast of Vegas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Push to the Summit_[375]\r\n\r\n    [375] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdD, Mar 53; 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl,\r\n          28 Mar 53; 1stMarDiv PIR 884, annex 340-MISP-53-12, POW\r\n          Rpt and 1stMarDiv PIR 885, annex 340-MISP-53-13, POW Rpt;\r\n          1st MAW PIRs 88-53, dtd 29 Mar 53 and 89-53, dtd 30 Mar\r\n          53; 5thMar, 7thMar, 11thMar, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 2/7, 1/11,\r\n          1st TkBn ComdDs, Mar 53; 5thMar SAR “Cities”; 11thMar SAR\r\n          “Arty Defense”; MAGs-12, -33, VMAs-212, -323, VMFs-115,\r\n          -311 ComdDs, Mar 53; Fugate, “Vegas”; USMC Biog.\r\n\r\nAlthough the composite two-platoon unit of Marines from F/2/7 and\r\nE/2/5 had partially won Vegas back in 10 hours of savage fighting on\r\n27 March, after earlier groundwork by D/2/5, it was a precarious hold.\r\nMarines had attained the lower slopes but the Chinese still clung to\r\nthe northern crest. As it turned out, three separate company-sized\r\nassaults were going to be needed to dislodge the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe initial Marine action on the 28th began at 0335 when 105mm and\r\n155mm howitzers of the 1st, 2d, and 4th Battalions, 11th Marines,\r\nbelched forth their streams of fire at the pocket of enemy troops on\r\nthe northern slopes preparatory to the forthcoming Marine infantry\r\nassault. This 2,326-round pounding was aimed at Chinese assembly areas\r\nand weapon emplacements, with much of the preparation zeroed in on\r\nactive mortars.\r\n\r\nWithin a half hour the weary men of F/2/7, who had spent a wakeful\r\nnight in the lower Vegas trenches, moved to within hand grenade range\r\nof the objective in their first attempt to gain the summit. An intense\r\nshower of small arms and mortar fire, however, forced them to pull\r\nback to the south slopes. While Captain Estey’s troops reorganized\r\nfor the next assault, air strikes joined the big guns, mortars, and\r\ntanks in battering the enemy’s position on the outpost and supply\r\nroutes thereto. Shortly after sunup, a lone AU from VMA-213, followed\r\na half hour later by a VMA-323 Corsair, arrived on station. They laid\r\na smoke screen three miles across the front between Arrowhead and the\r\nfar eastern Marine-U.S. Army boundary to assist four early-morning air\r\nstrikes. Soon afterwards, eight ADs from Lieutenant Colonel John E.\r\nHughes’ VMA-121 were in the skies to support the Vegas attack in the\r\nopening round of aerial activity that would see day-long bombing and\r\nstrafing runs by five 1st MAW squadrons.\r\n\r\nA new Marine assault at 0600 was repulsed and Company F pulled back\r\nto a defilade position 375 yards south of Vegas and regrouped. Again\r\nfriendly planes from VMA-121 and -323, tanks, artillery, and mortars\r\nplastered the enemy in a new series of preparatory fires, beginning at\r\n0920; and again Captain Estey’s F/2/7 men jumped off in attack. By 1015\r\nthe Marines had made their way across the height to within 15 yards\r\nof the trench line on the left finger of Vegas. There they came under\r\ncontinuous small arms and grenade bursts from the crest and battled the\r\nChinese in an intense 22-minute fire fight.\r\n\r\nIt was during this onslaught by Company F for the crest of Vegas that\r\nSergeant Daniel P. Matthews so defiantly routed the enemy to save the\r\nlife of a wounded comrade that his action gave renewed spirit to those\r\nwitnessing it. A squad leader of F/2/7, Matthews was in the thick of\r\na counterpunch against solidly dug-in hill defenses that had repelled\r\nsix previous assaults by Marine forces. The 21-year-old California\r\nMarine was coolly leading his men in the attack when the squad suddenly\r\nwas pinned down by a hostile machine gun located on the Vegas crest.\r\nWhen he saw that its grazing fire prevented a corpsman from removing\r\nto safety a wounded Marine who had fallen in full range of the weapon,\r\nMatthews acted instinctively.\r\n\r\nQuickly working his way around to the base of the enemy machine gun\r\nposition, he leaped onto the rock fortification that surrounded it.\r\nTaking the enemy by surprise, he charged the emplacement with his\r\nown rifle. Severely wounded within moments, the Marine continued his\r\nassault, killed two of the enemy, dispatched a third, and silenced the\r\nweapon. By this action, Sergeant Matthews enabled his comrades on the\r\nground to evacuate the injured Marine, although Matthews died before\r\naid could reach him.[376]\r\n\r\n    [376] The Marine NCO was to be posthumously awarded the Medal\r\n          of Honor, presented a year after the action, on 29 March\r\n          1954.\r\n\r\nBack at battalion, E/2/5, with D/2/7 in column behind it, had moved out\r\nto relieve Captain Estey’s redoubtable F/2/7 forces. By noon, Captain\r\nLorence’s Company E had completed passage of lines through Company F.\r\nThe latter unit, now numbering 43 effectives after its six assaults on\r\n27–28 March to regain the Vegas high ground, returned to base camp.\r\n\r\nHeavy air attacks, meanwhile, were assisting the artillery in blasting\r\nout Communist defenses of the Vegas area. Between 0950 and 1300,\r\nseven four-plane strikes by pilots of Colonel Bowman’s MAG-12 had\r\nswept the outpost area and hill lairs of the enemy at 57A, the east\r\nslope of Reno, Tumae-ri (40D), 190, and resupply points. Within one\r\n23-minute period alone, 28 tons of bombs were laid squarely on the\r\nVegas position. Supported by air, mortars, and artillery, Company E was\r\n400 yards from the objective, and, by 1245, forward elements had moved\r\nup to within 150 yards of the crest. As Marine supporting fires lifted\r\nfrom Vegas to enemy assembly areas on Hills 150, 153, and 190, E/2/5\r\nlaunched its final assault at 1301. Although small arms, bursts of\r\nmortar and enemy artillery fire traced their every move, the Marines’\r\nhard-hitting attack brought them to the top of Vegas where they\r\nliterally dug the Chinese out of their defenses.\r\n\r\nAt 1307, the Marines had secured their position and recaptured the\r\nVegas outpost. At approximately the same time the Marine reinforcing\r\nunit, D/2/7, was ordered to return to MLR, since the objective had been\r\ngained. The Marine in charge of the E/2/5 platoon that retook Vegas was\r\nStaff Sergeant John J. Williams, who had taken over the 1st Platoon\r\nafter its leader, Second Lieutenant Edgar R. Franz, had been wounded\r\nand evacuated. Almost immediately after securing Vegas at 1320, the\r\nChinese launched a counterattack and Company E came under a renewed\r\nbarrage of incessant artillery and mortar shells, exploding at the rate\r\nof one round per second in the Marines’ newly gained trenches.\r\n\r\nMarine firepower from the tankers’ 90mm rifles and the protective fire\r\ncurtain placed around the outpost by the artillery batteries, however,\r\ndeterred this heavy enemy effort. For the next hour Captain Lorence’s\r\nmen continued with mopping up chores. Gradually and fitfully the\r\nChinese resistance began to slacken. By 1401 definite control of Vegas\r\nwas established, except for the topographical crest at the northernmost\r\npoint. Resupply and consolidation of the outpost began at once, with\r\nVegas under 3/5 administration and Major Benjamin G. Lee, operations\r\nofficer of 2/5, in command.\r\n\r\nTwo prisoners had been taken during the day’s action, one by E/2/5\r\nduring its afternoon assault and the other by F/2/7 early in the day.\r\nThe soldier seized by a fire team from Company E was a 21-year-old\r\nwounded litter bearer attached to the attacking force, 3rd Battalion,\r\n358th Regiment. He told 5th Marines interrogators that for the\r\npreceding three months the mission of the 358th Regiment (a component\r\nof the 40th CCF Army, under operational control of the 46th CCF Army)\r\nhad been to prepare to occupy the Vegas and Reno outposts before\r\nthe expected UN spring offensive could be launched. The two key\r\ninstallations overlooked CCF supply routes. Furthermore, occupation\r\nof these two hills, the Chinese believed, would serve as a valuable\r\ntactical example to the 46th Army, whose ranks at this time were\r\ncomposed of nearly 65 percent recruits. The POW also reported that\r\nprior to the CCF attack on Reno and Vegas, men of his regiment had\r\npracticed throwing hand grenades every day for the past two weeks.\r\nNo political classes had been held during this period as practical\r\nproficiency, apparently, took priority over theoretical indoctrination.\r\n\r\nThe other Chinese prisoner, captured by Company F at 0610, was a\r\ngrenadier with the 9th Company, 3d Battalion, 358th Regiment. Prior\r\nto the attack, his unit had occupied reverse slope positions on\r\nHills 25A and 155 as reinforcements for the 8th Company. Each CCF\r\nbattalion, he revealed, “held a front of approximately 1,000 meters,\r\nutilizing one company on line with two in support.”[377] This remark\r\ninterested interrogators since it contradicted the normal pattern of\r\nenemy employment. According to the grenadier, the mission of the 3d\r\nBattalion had been to attack Vegas, while the 1st Battalion (to the\r\nwest of the 3d on the Chinese MLR) was to secure Reno. Hill 190.5, an\r\nenemy strongpoint, had several antiaircraft machine guns on its reverse\r\nslope, he declared, and was the location as well of the forward CP of\r\nthe 3d Battalion, 358th Regiment.\r\n\r\n    [377] 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl, dtd 28 Mar 53.\r\n\r\nFor the next five hours, from 1440 to 1930, the Marines dug in on the\r\ncrest and slopes of Vegas, buttressing their positions for the new\r\nChinese attack sure to come. A muster of the rag-tag group left from\r\nthe day’s 10 hours of fighting revealed a total strength of only five\r\nsquads--58 effectives from E/2/5 and 8 from F/2/7. Uppermost in the\r\nminds of all the men, regardless of their diminished numbers, was the\r\nironclad conviction that “we intend to stay.”[378]\r\n\r\n    [378] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nTheir leader, Major Lee, was no less determined. At 42, he was a\r\nMarine veteran of 19 years, a former sergeant major from World War\r\nII and holder of the Silver Star and Purple Heart for service at\r\nGuadalcanal. Now he had volunteered for this hazardous duty of holding\r\ntogether segments of the Vegas enclave until the Marines could once\r\nagain possess the entire hilltop outpost. Under his direction the\r\ntroops promptly began to prepare individual fighting holes in the best\r\npossible tactical positions and to emplace their weapons. Personnel\r\nfrom Captain Lorence’s E/2/5 held the hard-won Vegas crest, while 150\r\nmen from F/2/5 committed later in the afternoon strengthened the rear\r\ntrenches.\r\n\r\nAir bombardment, prior to the 28th, had not been employed extensively\r\nagainst Vegas itself. The goal had been to recapture the outpost and\r\ndrive the Communists out without unnecessarily destroying its defenses.\r\nChinese tenacity in exploiting the Marine weapons positions at COP 21,\r\nwhile augmenting them, had made it apparent that the Vegas defense\r\nnetwork would have to be reduced to retake the position. Altogether,\r\nduring the day 33 missions (more than 100 CAS sorties) were flown by\r\nAUs, ADs, F4Us, and F9Fs of the 1st Marine Air Wing to support division\r\nground action in regaining the advance outpost. All morning long,\r\npowerful attack planes from three MAG-12 squadrons had winged in from\r\nnearby K-6. Pilots from VMA-121, VMA-212 (Lieutenant Colonel Louis R.\r\nSmunk), and VMA-323 (Lieutenant Colonel William M. Frash) had flown the\r\nbombing runs.\r\n\r\nIn the early afternoon they were joined by the speedy, stable Panther\r\njets from VMF-115 and VMF-311, of MAG-33 (Colonel Robertshaw),\r\nbased further away at K-3. Between 1300 and 1800, a series of three\r\nfour-plane F9F assaults were launched north of the Marine MLR by\r\nVMF-311, while another strike was made further east in support of\r\nthe Army 2d Infantry Division’s Old Baldy operations. These planes,\r\ntogether with two divisions from VMF-115, dumped a total of 23 tons\r\nof bombs and 3,100 rounds of 20mm shells on CCF trenches, bunkers,\r\nmortars, and caves at Vegas, Reno, and Hill 25A. Additionally, VMF-115\r\nPanthers flew four single-sortie daytime MPQ missions north of the\r\nbombline to damage and destroy enemy resupply points.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Communist Probes_[379]\r\n\r\n    [379] The material in this section is derived from: 1stMarDiv\r\n          ComdD, Mar 53; 1stMarDiv PIRs 884-5, dtd 28–29 Mar 53;\r\n          1stMar ComdD, Mar 53; 1stMar SAR.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Chinese made it plain that their main interest was in the\r\nVegas outpost area, spotty probes also took place in Colonel Adams’\r\n1st Marines sector. On the 27th, at about 2310, two enemy squads milled\r\naround the wire defense at outpost Kate, but Marine small arms, BARs,\r\nand mortars routed them after a 15-minute fire fight. At midnight, a\r\nCCF reinforced platoon reconnoitered Dagmar and Esther, for the second\r\nsuccessive night, supported by small arms and automatic weapons fire\r\nfrom Chinese Hills 114 and 44. The enemy platoon started to rush the\r\nforward slope at Dagmar, but Company I defenders pulled back to the\r\nreverse side and directed VT-fuzed shells on the enemy.\r\n\r\nFollowing this barrage the Marines reoccupied their position, with\r\nthe help of MLR machine guns, mortars, and artillery from the 3/11\r\ndirect support battalion. (Now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Alfred\r\nL. Owens, who had succeeded Lieutenant Colonel Pregnall on 25 March.)\r\nThe enemy reinforced with a second platoon, as did the Marines. After\r\nintense close-in fighting in the Dagmar trenches for two hours, the\r\nChinese withdrew. An enemy squad also engaged Bunker and Hedy; but\r\nagain, 3/11 VT-fuzed concentrations and the organic outpost defenses\r\nsent him off handily. Enemy casualties for the evening’s activity were\r\n15 dead, 25 more estimated killed, and 23 estimated wounded.\r\n\r\nThe following night the Chinese briefly harassed outpost Hedy, using\r\nas cover an abandoned Marine tank just east of the outpost, as well as\r\nthe MLR to the rear of COP Bunker. Marine bullets and mortar shells\r\ndictated a quick retreat, however. Several minor contacts with the\r\nenemy had also been made during the two-day period in the 1st KMC\r\nsector. The most menacing were heavy enemy sightings on the 27th of\r\nsome 200 Chinese in the area west of the old outposts 36 and 37, but no\r\nmajor action developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Three CCF Attempts for the Outpost_[380]\r\n\r\n    [380] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdD, Mar 53; 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl,\r\n          28–29 Mar 53; 1stMarDiv PIRs 884-6, dtd 29–31 Mar 53;\r\n          1st MAW PIR 89-53, dtd 29 Mar 53; 5th Mar, 7thMar, 11th\r\n          Mar, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 2/7, 1/11, 3/11, 4/11 ComdDs, Mar 53;\r\n          5thMar SAR “Cities”; 11thMar SAR “Arty Defense”; Fugate,\r\n          “Vegas.”\r\n\r\nAs darkness blanketed No-Man’s-Land on the night of the 28th, ground\r\nfighting flared up anew at 1955. The Chinese had begun another one of\r\ntheir nightly rituals, the first of three counterattacks to win back\r\nthe disputed territory from the Marines. Vegas reported heavy incoming,\r\nincluding not only the usual assortment of mortar and artillery fires\r\nbut direct 3.5-inch rocket hits. Enemy troops, estimated at nearly a\r\nbattalion, began approaching from Reno. By way of answer two Marine\r\nlight artillery battalions, 1/11 and 2/11, together with the medium\r\n155mm howitzers of 4/11 and the Army 623d Field Artillery, lashed a\r\n4,670-round barrage to interdict the approaching enemy. Ripples from\r\nthe 1st 4.5-inch Rocket Battery reinforced the howitzers in thwarting\r\nthis initial enemy assault. On the right flank of the outpost an\r\nintense 20-minute fire fight broke out at 2023, but the Vegas defenders\r\nbeat back the intruders. For an hour the enemy, supported by heavy\r\nmortar and artillery fires from Reno and his own positions at Vegas,\r\ntried unsuccessfully to force the Marines to withdraw.\r\n\r\nCarson, which had been relatively undisturbed for the past two days,\r\nalso came under attack at this time from automatic weapons and mortars\r\ndirected on its north slope by the enemy holed up behind Hills 67 and\r\n31. For the rest of the night an enemy company prowled around the area,\r\nbut the defense at Carson, plus artillery and mortar fire support from\r\nJAMESTOWN, sent the Chinese off in the early morning hours with their\r\nambitions thwarted.\r\n\r\nAt Vegas, meanwhile, outpost commander Major Lee at 2130 radioed\r\nbattalion headquarters that he was preparing for a new enemy\r\ncounterattack. It was not long in coming. Less than an hour later, the\r\nChinese were again storming from Hill 153, and Marine boxing fires\r\npicked off the advancing enemy. At 2230 Major Lee’s riflemen, deployed\r\nabout 25 yards from the peak, were holding Vegas, surrounded by Chinese\r\non the southern face of the position. For a brief period the enemy took\r\nthe high ground but then gave it up under pressure from the defending\r\nMarines. Close by, another sharp fire fight erupted; then subsided\r\nfor about an hour. At 2300 a new onslaught of Chinese reinforcements\r\nmade the third major attempt of the evening to recapture the Vegas\r\nposition. Two enemy companies descended. Within a half hour another\r\nmassive fire fight had broken out, and the battle was raging across the\r\nshell-scarred hilltop. Major Lee reported to G-3 heavy enemy sightings\r\nof at least 200 Chinese on the top slopes challenging Marine possession\r\nof the Vegas crest and attempting to smoke their positions. At 0045,\r\nhostile forces had surrounded the outpost and seized part of the Vegas\r\nheight, but 11th Marines fires walled off the enemy and prevented\r\npenetration. Flare planes circling overhead lighted the target and\r\ncannoneers of both sides concentrated on the crest. The heaviest Marine\r\nshoot of the night-long artillery duel, a 6,108-round barrage, rained\r\ndown on enemy troops and trenches shortly before midnight.\r\n\r\nAltogether, during the night of 28–29 March, two battalions of Chinese\r\ntroops had made three separate, unsuccessful ventures to retake the\r\nVegas crest, but were thrown back by Marine mortar, artillery, and\r\ntank fires. At 0130, following a heavy 37-minute artillery and mortar\r\nconcentration, the enemy began to withdraw, but not before venting his\r\ndispleasure with a resounding blast of small arms and bazooka fire from\r\nthe Reno hill. In their departure, the Chinese were given an assist by\r\nCompany E, 7th Marines, which had broken through the enemy encirclement\r\nof Vegas in the early morning hours to join E/2/5 and F/2/5 defending\r\nforces and help drive the invaders off all but the northern tip of the\r\nhill. Now under Captain Thomas P. Connolly, E/2/7 ascended the high\r\nground, passing through F/2/5 ranks in preparation for the ultimate\r\nrelief of E/2/5.\r\n\r\nFor the next two hours the 11th Marines battalions, together with the\r\n1st 4.5-inch Rocket Battery, sealed off the outpost and blistered enemy\r\nfortifications at Reno with a total of 4,225 rounds. Air observers on\r\nstation fired 10 missions between midnight and 0430. Twenty minutes\r\nlater, the artillerymen unleashed still another preparation to dislodge\r\nthe unyielding CCF dug in at the Vegas topographical crest. Heavier\r\nfires from the 155mm howitzers of 4/11 and the 623d Field Artillery\r\nBattalions followed on more than two dozen active mortar and artillery\r\ntargets.\r\n\r\nA new assault by Marine infantrymen (E/2/7, E/2/5, and F/2/5) at 0450\r\nrecaptured the critical northern segment of the outpost. Elation over\r\nthis encouraging turn of events was dampened, however, by loss of\r\nseveral Marine leaders in the early morning foray. Shortly before 0500,\r\nMajor Lee and Captain Walz were killed instantly by a 120mm mortar\r\nround during an intensive enemy shelling. Another Marine casualty early\r\non the 29th was First Lieutenant John S. Gray. A forward observer from\r\nC/1/11, he was mortally wounded by an enemy mortar blast when he left\r\nhis foxhole to crawl closer to the Vegas peak and thus better direct\r\nartillery fires on the enemy. At the time of his death, Lieutenant Gray\r\nwas reported to have been at Vegas longer than any other officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vegas Consolidation Begins_[381]\r\n\r\n    [381] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9; 1stMarDiv\r\n          ComdD, Mar 53; 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl, 29–31 Mar 53; 1stMarDiv\r\n          PIRs 885–887, dtd 29–31 Mar 53; 1st MAW PIRs 8-53, dtd 29\r\n          Mar 53 and 90-53, dtd 30 Mar 53; 5thMar, 7thMar, 11thMar,\r\n          1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 2/7, 1/11, 2/11, 3/11, 4/11, 1st TkBn\r\n          ComdDs, Mar 53; 5thMar SAR “Cities”; 11thMar SAR “Arty\r\n          Defense”; MAGs-12, -33, VMAs-212, -323, VMFs-115, -311\r\n          ComdDs, Mar 53; Fugate, “Vegas.”\r\n\r\nOnly a few surviving enemy were seen when Marines of F/2/5 and E/2/7\r\nmoved out to consolidate the position after daybreak. This task was\r\ncompleted without contact by 0830. In the meantime, the Vegas defense\r\nwas reorganized with two reinforced platoons on the main portion and a\r\nthird occupying the high ground. A smoke haze placed around the outpost\r\nscreened the work of the Marines. Individual foxholes were dug and\r\nautomatic weapons emplaced. Major Joseph S. Buntin, executive officer\r\nof 3/5, had taken over as the new outpost commander. Corpsmen and\r\nreplacement weapons--machine guns, mortars, BARs, rockets--had arrived.\r\nThe morning supply train brought KSC personnel and Marines with\r\nengineering tools to begin work on trenches, fighting holes, weapons\r\ndugouts, and bunker fortifications.\r\n\r\nBy noon, excavation work on the shell-pocked trench system was well\r\nunder way, with all of it dug waist deep and the majority as deep as\r\na man’s shoulder. Daylight hours between 1000 and 1600 on the 29th\r\nwere relatively quiet with only light ground activity. Rainy weather\r\nthat turned road nets and fighting trenches into boot-high muck and\r\ngiant mud holes further slowed the action. Artillerymen completed\r\ncountermortar and smoke missions, and in the skies air observers\r\ndirected fire throughout the day on 19 enemy resupply and target points\r\nuntil dusk when rain and light snow forced them to return to base.\r\n\r\nAt 1850, the Chinese launched what in some respects was a carbon\r\ncopy action of the night of the 26th. Once again there was sudden\r\nheavy incoming and then shortly after dusk the CCF struck in a new\r\nthree-pronged attack to overrun Vegas. This time three companies of\r\nChinese approached both flanks of the outpost from their positions on\r\nReno and Hill 153. In addition to his infantry weapons, the enemy was\r\nsupported by heavy mortars and artillery. But the Marines’ mortars,\r\nilluminating shells, and big guns replied immediately. Ten minutes\r\nafter the enemy’s latest incursion, a massed counterfire from five\r\nartillery battalions joined in the heaviest single barrage of the\r\nentire Vegas defense action. This massed fire of 6,404 rounds blasted\r\nthe Chinese assault battalion and sent it reeling back with heavy\r\nlosses. Two rocket ripples also tore into the Chinese troops.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the medium and heavy firing batteries, two heavy mortar\r\nunits, Companies A and C of the 461st Infantry Battalion, had that\r\nday gone into position in the 5th Marines sector in general support\r\nof 1/11. Other fires came from the 8-inch howitzer unit, Battery C,\r\n424th Field Artillery Battalion, also newly assigned to the 17th Field\r\nArtillery Battalion that day in general support of the 1st Marine\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\nAlthough another enemy attack was quickly repulsed at 2045 in a brisk,\r\nsavage fight, shortly before midnight the Chinese reappeared, moving\r\nup from behind the right finger of Hill 153. This was believed to be\r\nan attempt to recover their casualties, but Marine artillery, mortars,\r\nand rocket bursts sent them fleeing within ten minutes. Still the enemy\r\nobstinately refused to give up his goal of retaking the high ground\r\nat COP 21. In the early morning hours of the 30th, he again returned\r\nto hit the outpost in his second battalion-strength attack within six\r\nhours. Again he struck from Reno and Hill 153, and again he attempted\r\nto cut off the outpost Marines by encircling the position. Heavy\r\npounding by artillery, mortar, and boxing fires snuffed out the enemy’s\r\nattack and by 0215 the Chinese had left the Vegas domain--this time, it\r\nwas to prove, for good. Their casualties for this latest attempt had\r\nbeen 78 counted killed, 123 more estimated killed, and 174 estimated\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nWith sunup, the Marines at the battered outpost again repaired the\r\ndamage of the night’s visits from the Chinese and continued work to\r\nimprove their trenches and gun emplacements. Clearing weather enabled\r\nair observers and pilots to follow a full flight schedule. VMA-212 and\r\nVMA-323 were again over the Vegas skies during the morning hours and\r\nshortly before noon a joint mission by eight AU’s, a division from each\r\nsquadron, dumped nearly 10 tons of bombs on enemy trenches, mortars,\r\nbunkers, and troops at Hill 25A across from Reno to discourage Chinese\r\nrebuilding efforts. Both flew afternoon sorties to destroy strongholds\r\nat Hill 21B, at Reno, now in possession of the enemy, and to make smoke\r\nscreen runs. Early in the day, Company F of 2/5 came up from the 2/5\r\nCP to fill in on the MLR and Berlin outposts for Company G from 3/5.\r\nLater in the afternoon, G/3/5 relieved E/2/7 on Vegas and Major George\r\nE. Kelly, S-3 of 2d Battalion, 7th Marines, succeeded Major Buntin as\r\nthe new outpost commander.\r\n\r\nTwo comments, casually made at the time, perhaps typify the grim\r\nstaying power of the Marines who defended Vegas. As Corporal George\r\nC. Demars, Company F platoon guide, 5th Marines, observed, “The guys\r\nwere like rabbits digging in. The fill-ins [reinforcements] gotten by\r\nthe Company during the reorganization, jumped right in. We didn’t know\r\nhalf the people on the fire teams, but everybody worked together.”[382]\r\nSecond Lieutenant Irvin B. Maizlish, assigned as a rifle platoon\r\ncommander of F/2/5 on the 25th, the day before the fighting broke out,\r\nand who had the dubious distinction of being one of the few officers\r\nof those originally attached to the company not wounded or killed,\r\nrecalled: “I checked the men digging in at Vegas ... I’ve never seen men\r\nwork so hard ... I even heard some of them singing the Marine Corps Hymn\r\nas they were digging....”[383]\r\n\r\n    [382] Fugate, “Vegas,” p. 74.\r\n\r\n    [383] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nThe last direct confrontation with the enemy at Vegas had occurred that\r\nmorning, about 1100, when five Chinese unconcernedly walked up to the\r\noutpost, apparently to surrender. Then, suddenly, they began throwing\r\ngrenades and firing their automatic weapons. The little delegation was\r\npromptly dispatched by two Marine fire teams. Three CCF soldiers were\r\nkilled and two taken prisoners, one of whom later died.\r\n\r\nAs darkness fell on the 30th, Marine artillery fired heavy harassing\r\nand interdiction missions and regimental TOTs on enemy supply routes\r\nand assembly areas. Although the shoot was dual-purposed, both\r\nto prevent another Chinese attempt at retaking Vegas and to foil\r\na possible diversionary probe elsewhere in the division sector,\r\nneither situation developed. For the fourth consecutive night, giant\r\nsearchlights from the Army’s 2d Platoon, 61st Field Artillery Battery\r\nilluminated the battlefield to spotlight the enemy withdrawal routes.\r\nTwo of the quadruple .50 caliber machine gun mounts from the 1st\r\nProvisional AAA-AW Battery were also displaced to MLR positions in\r\nanticipation of trouble, but the CCF had apparently had enough of a\r\nthoroughly bloodied nose from the Marine fighters and decided to call\r\nit quits.\r\n\r\nBy daybreak, the Vegas sentry forces could report that things had been\r\nrelatively quiet--the first time in five interminably long nights--and\r\nCompanies D and E, 5th Marines, which had been watchdogging it at the\r\noutpost moved back to the MLR. At 0800, the 2d Battalion, 7th Marines,\r\nreverted to parent control, and by noon, reliefs were under way not\r\nonly for Vegas but for Corinne, Dagmar, Hedy, and Bunker in the 1st\r\nMarines sector. A 5th Marines body recovery detail, meanwhile, had\r\nmoved out to search the draws.\r\n\r\nIf ground action was light on the 31st, supporting arms activity was\r\na different story, starting with seven MPQ drops on enemy artillery\r\npositions and ammunition caves in the early hours of darkness. Between\r\n0650 and 1900, 23 air strikes were flown in the Vegas-Reno area by\r\nVMA-121 ADs and AUs of -212 and -323, MAG-12 squadrons, as well as\r\nthree quartets of Air Force Thunderjets dispatched by Fifth Air Force.\r\nArtillery fired a total of 800 rounds on 156 enemy concentrations,\r\nagain with 4.2-inch mortars from the 461st Infantry Battalion\r\nreinforcing 1/11 fires on hostile mortars, ammunition dumps, and supply\r\npoints. If the outgoing was aimed at discouraging Communist plans\r\nfor new acquisitions, _their_ incoming had dropped to a new low in\r\ncomparison with the heightened activity of the past five days. A total\r\nof 699 rounds was reported in the division sector, most of it falling\r\nin 5th Marines territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aftermath_[384]\r\n\r\n    [384] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9; 1stMarDiv\r\n          ComdD, Mar 53; 1stMarDiv PIR 887, dtd 31 Mar 53; 5thMar,\r\n          7thMar, 11thMar, 3/5 ComdDs, Mar 53; 11thMar SAR “Arty\r\n          Defense”; Hicks, _Outpost Warfare_; MacDonald _POW_;\r\n          Jane Blakeney, _Heroes--U.S. Marine Corps, 1861–1955_\r\n          (Washington, D.C.: Blakeney, 1957); Leckie, _Conflict_;\r\n          Fugate, “Vegas”; MSgt Roy E.

The action developed into a five-day siege involving\r\nover 4,000 ground and air Marines and was the most bloody action that\r\nMarines on the western front had yet engaged in. Its cost can be seen,\r\nin part, by the casualties sustained by the 1st Marine Division. The\r\ninfantry strength of two battalions was required to retake Outpost\r\nVegas and defend it against successive Chinese counterattacks. A total\r\nof 520 Marine replacements were received during the operation. Marine\r\ncasualties totaled 1,015, or 116 killed, 441 wounded/evacuated, 360\r\nwounded/not evacuated, and 98 missing, of which 19 were known to be\r\nprisoners. Losses for the critical five-day period represented 70\r\npercent of division casualties for the entire month--1,488 killed,\r\nwounded, and missing (not including 128 in the KMC sector).\r\n\r\nEnemy casualties were listed conservatively as 2,221. This represented\r\n536 counted killed, 654 estimated killed, 174 counted wounded, 853\r\nestimated wounded, and 4 prisoners. The Marines, moreover, in the\r\nfive days of furious fighting had knocked out the 358th CCF Regiment,\r\nnumbering between 3,000 and 3,500 men, and destroyed its effectiveness\r\nas a unit.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Vegas operation, the 1st Marine Air Wing had flown 218\r\ncombat missions against the Nevada Cities hills (63 percent of the\r\nentire month’s total 346 CAS missions), bombing and strafing enemy\r\nweapons positions, bunkers, ammunition dumps, trenches, and troops.\r\nOn the 27th and 28th, while heavy fighting raged in both the Marine\r\nand 7th Army Division sectors, Marine Air Group 33 pilots flew 75\r\nsorties--resulting in their highest daily sortie rate and air hours\r\nsince December 1952. The March 28th date was a noteworthy one for\r\nMAG-12, too. It established a new record for combat sorties and bomb\r\ntonnage unloaded on the enemy in a single day; the group executed 129\r\nsorties and dropped 207.64 tons of bombs and napalm.\r\n\r\nAlthough restricted on two days by weather conditions, close air\r\nsupport was effectively used throughout the Vegas Cities operation. A\r\ntotal of 81 four-aircraft flights dropped approximately 426 tons of\r\nexplosives in CAS missions. Smoke and flare planes--despite a shortage\r\nof both flare planes and flares[385]--were employed throughout the\r\nperiod as were the rotary aircraft of the two helicopter squadrons, the\r\nlatter for casualty evacuation operations.\r\n\r\n    [385] CG, 1stMarDiv msg to COs, 1stMar, 5thMar, 7thMar, KMC,\r\n          KPR, dtd 31 Mar 53, in 1stMarDiv ComdD, Mar 53, App. II,\r\n          p. 9.\r\n\r\nTanks, provided by the Company A direct support tank company, were\r\nused day and night, firing from nine positions along the MLR. Their\r\neffective use to mark air targets was of particular importance in\r\nconnection with their support role, while the tank light also helped\r\nto provide illumination of the objective area in hours of darkness.\r\nApproximately 7,000 rounds of 90mm tank ammunition were fired.\r\n\r\nDuring these five tense days the enemy deluged Marine positions with\r\n45,000 rounds of artillery, mortar, and mixed fire. Indicative of the\r\nsavage pounding the Vegas area took is the fact that incoming Chinese\r\nartillery for the full two-week period from 1–15 March totaled only\r\n3,289 rounds. Marine efforts to defend, counterattack, secure, and\r\nhold the Vegas outpost against repeated Chinese assaults were “marked\r\nby maximum use of and coordination with various supporting arms and\r\norganic weapons.”[386] Three light artillery battalions, two medium\r\nbattalions, two 8-inch batteries, one 4.5-inch rocket battery, and two\r\ncompanies of 4.2-inch mortars fired a combined total of 104,864 rounds\r\nbetween 27–31 March; the 11th Marines and its heavy Army reinforcing\r\nelements, in support of 5th and 7th Marines units, executed 332\r\ncounterbattery and 666 countermortar missions. Of the total number\r\nfired, 132 were air observed.\r\n\r\n    [386] 5thMar SAR “Cities,” p. 8.\r\n\r\nThe artillery shelling was the hottest during a 24-hour period ending\r\nat 1600 on 28–29 March. During this time 35,809 rounds were fired\r\n(33,041 from the four Marine battalions). This even surpassed the\r\nprevious record of 34,881 rounds fired during a one-day period in the\r\nBunker Hill defense of August 1952. A new one-day battalion total\r\nfor West Korean fighting was also set on the 28th; 1/11 fired 11,079\r\nrounds, exceeding the record of 10,652 set by 3/11 during the Bunker\r\nHill fighting.\r\n\r\nMarines at a rear area supply point achieved another record. In a\r\n24-hour period, during the heavy fighting on 28–29 March, 130 men\r\nhandled 2,841 tons of ammunition. Second Lieutenant Donald E. Spangler,\r\nan ammunition platoon commander with the 1st Ordnance Battalion, who\r\nhad but 13 hours’ sleep in the entire five days of fighting, proudly\r\nnoted that his unit had “more than doubled the tonnage that the U.S.\r\nArmy says a man can handle in 14 hours.”[387]\r\n\r\n    [387] Heinecke, _op. cit._, p. 50.\r\n\r\nAs for the men on the front line, besides the Medal of Honor winners,\r\n10 Marines were awarded the Navy Cross, the nation’s second highest\r\ncombat award. Nine citations were for the Vegas action and one for the\r\n1st Marines defense of Dagmar, in staving off an enemy penetration on\r\nthe night of the 26th.\r\n\r\nBattlefront tactics employed by the CCF in its assault of the Vegas\r\nCities outposts were largely consistent with their previous strategy.\r\nAs in the past, the enemy launched simultaneous attacks against\r\nseveral Marine positions in attempt to fragment defensive artillery\r\nfirepower. Characteristically, the enemy preceded his thrust with heavy\r\npreassault concentrations of artillery and mortar fire. He also took\r\nadvantage of the twin ploys of surprise and overwhelming strength,\r\nwith wave after wave of Chinese rolling over the objective. Innovative\r\ntechniques consisted of scaling ladders, fashioned from lightweight but\r\nsturdy bamboo, which were used to traverse Marine wire defenses, and\r\nof having an artillery liaison officer attached to infantry squads to\r\nbetter direct supporting fires during the attack. Analysis of Chinese\r\nfirepower tactics indicated deliberate counterbattery efforts by the\r\nCCF, although this employment of artillery was secondary to its support\r\nof ground troops.\r\n\r\nActually, the Chinese attack on the forward Marine outposts the night\r\nof the 26th appeared to have been part of an overall reinvigorated\r\nspring assault. Opening gun of this offense had been fired three nights\r\nearlier, on the 23d, when they swept over an Army hill defense at Old\r\nBaldy, 25 miles northeast of the Marine Vegas Hills. Despite heavy\r\nAllied gunfire and bombing by Air Force and Marine planes under Fifth\r\nAir Force flight orders, the Chinese had clung to the hill, burrowed\r\ndeeply, and resisted all efforts to be dislodged. After three days of\r\nfighting, U.S. 7th Division troops had abandoned the Old Baldy hill\r\nat dawn on the 26th. The CCF, apparently emboldened by this success,\r\nthat same night had launched a series of probes at nine UN outposts\r\non the Korean far western front in an attempt to further extend their\r\nfrontline acquisitions.\r\n\r\nFollowing the loss of Reno, a new outpost, Elko, was established on\r\nHill 47, southeast of Carson and 765 yards from the MLR, to prevent the\r\nenemy from using the Hill 47 position as an attack and patrol route to\r\nthe MLR. In addition to this new platoon-strength outpost, the Marines\r\nsubstantially shored up Vegas from its former platoon garrison to a\r\ndetachment consisting of 2 officers and 133 enlisted men.\r\n\r\nHeadlines had told Americans at home and the free peoples around the\r\nworld the story of the “Nevada Cities” in Korea and the Marines’\r\nfive-day stand there to prevent loss of critical UNC territory. The\r\nevent that marked an official “well done” to the Marines themselves\r\nwas a message from the Commandant, General Shepherd, who on 30 March\r\nsent the following dispatch to General Pollock, CG, 1st Marine Division:\r\n\r\n  Have followed the reports of intensive combat in the First Marine\r\n  Division sector during the past week with greatest sense of\r\n  pride and confidence. The stubborn and heroic defense of Vegas,\r\n  Reno, and Carson Hills coupled with the superb offensive spirit\r\n  which characterized the several counterattacks are a source of\r\n  reassurance and satisfaction to your fellow Marines everywhere.\r\n  On their behalf please accept for yourself and pass on to every\r\n  officer and man of your command my sincere congratulations on a\r\n  task accomplished in true Marine Corps fashion.[388]\r\n\r\n    [388] CMC msg to CG, 1stMarDiv, dtd 30 Mar 53, cited in\r\n          1stMarDiv ComdD, Mar 53, App. I, p. 7.\r\n\r\nIn turn, General Pollock congratulated the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing\r\nof General Megee and its six participating squadrons (VMAs-121, -212,\r\n-323, VMFs-115, -311, and VMF(N)-513). Citing the close air support\r\nmissions of the Marine flyers during the operation, General Pollock\r\nnoted that the air strikes of the 28th were “particularly well executed\r\nand contributed materially to the success of the 1st Marine Division in\r\nretaking and holding the objective.”[389]\r\n\r\n    [389] CG, 1stMarDiv msg to CG, 1st MAW, dtd 31 Mar 53, in\r\n          MAG-12 ComdD, Mar 53, App. VII-3.\r\n\r\nPlaudits had also come to the 1st Marine Division from the Korean\r\nMinister of Defense, Pai Yung Shin,[390] the day immediately preceding\r\nthe Vegas attack. On 25 March, the Korean Presidential Unit Citation\r\nstreamer,[391] for action from 26 October 1950 to 15 February 1953,\r\nhad been placed on the division colors in ceremonies at the division\r\ncommand post, attended by the Korean Defense Minister; Vice Admiral\r\nWoon Il Sohn, Chief of Korean Naval Operations; Major General Hyan Zoon\r\nShin, Commandant of the Korean Marine Corps; General Pollock, division\r\ncommander, and his troops. The event marked the fourth Korean PUC\r\nawarded to Marine units since the beginning of the war.\r\n\r\n    [390] CROKMC ltr to CMC, dtd 2 Feb 1971, hereafter ROKMC\r\n          _Comments_.\r\n\r\n    [391] See Appendix G for complete text of citation.

The prospect of a new stage in the off-and-on\r\ntruce negotiations had also come late in the month. On 28 March, the\r\nCommunists informed the UN of their willingness to discuss the Allied\r\nproposal for return of sick and wounded prisoners. This exchange\r\nhad originally been suggested by the UN more than a year earlier,\r\nin December 1951. Notification of the new Chinese intentions came,\r\nironically, on a day when the Vegas outpost fighting was at its height.\r\n\r\nAs the month closed on the Vegas chapter, Marines on line and in the\r\nreserve companies who had just sweated through the bloodiest exchange\r\nof the war on the I Corps front to date added their own epitaph. With a\r\ntouch of ungallantry that can be understood, they called the disputed\r\ncrest of Vegas “the highest damn beachhead in Korea.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMarking Time\r\n\r\n(April-June 1953)\r\n\r\n_The Peace Talks Resume--Operation_ LITTLE SWITCH_--Interval Before the\r\nMarines Go Off the Line--The May Relief--Training While in Reserve and\r\nDivision Change of Command--Heavy May-June Fighting--Developments in\r\nMarine Air--Other Marine Defense Activities--The Division Is Ordered\r\nBack to the Front_\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Peace Talks Resume_[392]\r\n\r\n    [392] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9; 1stMarDiv,\r\n          1st EngrBn ComdDs, Apr 53; Berger, _Korea Knot_;\r\n          Clark, _Danube to Yalu_; Hermes, _Truce Tent_; Leckie,\r\n          _Conflict_; M/Sgt Robert T. Fugate, “Freedom Village,”\r\n          _Leatherneck_, v. 36, no. 7 (Jul 53), hereafter Fugate,\r\n          “Freedom Village.”\r\n\r\nIt was April 1953, but it wasn’t an April Fool’s mirage. On 6 April,\r\nrepresentatives of the United Nations Command and the Communist\r\ndelegation sat down at the Panmunjom truce tents to resume the peace\r\ntalks that had been stalemated six months--since October 1952. If there\r\nwas a word that could be said to reflect the attitude of American\r\nofficials and private citizens alike--for that matter, the atmosphere\r\nat Panmunjom itself--it was one of caution--not real optimism, not an\r\nunbridled hopefulness, but a wearied caution born of the mountains of\r\nwords, gulfs of free-flowing dialogue and diatribe, and then ultimate\r\nplateaus of intransigence that had marked negotiations with Communist\r\nleaders since the original truce discussions had begun in July 1951.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic maneuverings had been underway since the end of 1952 for\r\nthe exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of both sides. This was\r\nconsidered a first step towards ending the prisoner of war dispute and\r\nachieving an ultimate truce. A resolution introduced in mid-November\r\nby India at the United Nations session dealing with settlement of\r\nnonrepatriate prisoners had been adopted in early December. Later that\r\nmonth the Red Cross international conference had officially gone on\r\nrecord favoring the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners in advance\r\nof a truce. A letter written on 22 February by the UNC commander,\r\nGeneral Clark, calling for the immediate exchange of ailing prisoners\r\nhad been delivered to the NKPA and CCF leaders.\r\n\r\nInitially, the Communist answer was an oppressive silence that lasted\r\nfor more than a month. During this time the Communist hierarchy had\r\nbeen stunned by the death, on 5 March, of Premier Stalin. Then, on 28\r\nMarch, in a letter that reached General Clark at Tokyo in the middle\r\nof the night, came an unexpected response from the two Communist\r\nspokesmen. They not only agreed unconditionally to an exchange of the\r\nsick and injured prisoners but further proposed that “the delegates\r\nfor armistice negotiations of both sides immediately resume the\r\nnegotiations at Panmunjom.”[393]\r\n\r\n    [393] Leckie, _Conflict_, p. 373.\r\n\r\nThis favorable development astonished not only the United Nations\r\nCommander but the rest of the Free World as well. Several steps were\r\nquickly put in motion. The UN Commander’s reply to the Kim-Peng offer\r\nwas expressed in such a way that resumption of full negotiations was\r\nnot tied in as a condition for the preliminary exchange of ailing POWs.\r\nPresident Eisenhower, commenting on the new Communist proposals at his\r\n2 April press conference, stated he thought the country should “now\r\ntake at face value every offer made to us until it is proved unworthy\r\nof our confidence.”[394] He also further enjoined major military\r\ncommanders and subordinates to avoid anything that might be contrary to\r\nthis view when they made public remarks or issued press releases.\r\n\r\n    [394] CG, Eighth Army msg to CG, 1stMarDiv and others, dtd 4\r\n          Apr 53, in 1stMarDiv ComdD, Apr 53, App. I, p. 1.\r\n\r\nIn Korea, the Munsan-ni Provisional Command was established on 5 April\r\nunder the Commanding General, Eighth Army, in the vicinity of the 1st\r\nMarine Division railhead at Munsan-ni. The command was to prepare for\r\nthe many housekeeping details involved in the receiving and orderly\r\nprocessing of all UNC prisoners. The anticipated exchange itself was\r\ndubbed Operation LITTLE SWITCH. Two Army officers, one Marine Corps,\r\nand one ROKA representative were designed to direct the administrative\r\nmachinery of the provisional command. Heading the organization was\r\nColonel Raymond W. Beggs, USA.\r\n\r\nThe Marine representative, Colonel Wallace M. Nelson, was named\r\ncommanding officer of the United Nations Personnel and Medical\r\nProcessing Unit. His responsibility was not limited to the obvious\r\nmedical aspects of the exchange, but extended to other details\r\ninvolving clothing issue, personnel, security, chaplains, food,\r\ncommunication, motor transport, engineering, and the operation of\r\nunit headquarters. Among those matters to which the Munsan-ni command\r\ndirected its immediate attention was the setting up of a temporary\r\nfacility for Communist prisoners currently held in UNC camps at Koje,\r\nCheju, and Yongcho Islands and a hospital near Pusan. Arrangements were\r\nalso made for in interpreter pool, debriefing teams, and press center\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\nAs the new week began on Monday, 6 April, and the world looked to\r\nPanmunjom for the next set of signals in the war, a new stage developed\r\nin the truce negotiations. Within five days after the talks had begun,\r\nboth sides agreed to return the disabled prisoners in their custody.\r\nFinal papers for the preliminary exchange were signed at noon on 11\r\nApril by Rear Admiral John C. Daniel, USN, for the United Nations\r\nCommand, and Major General Lee Sang Cho, of the Communist delegation.\r\nThe week-long transfer of sick and wounded POWs was scheduled to begin\r\n20 April, at Panmunjom.\r\n\r\nThe Communists announced they intended to release 600 sick and wounded\r\nUNC prisoners (450 Korean, 150 non-Korean), a figure which Admiral\r\nDaniel called “incredibly small.”[395] For its part, the UNC indicated\r\nthat it planned to free nearly ten times that number of North Korean\r\nand Chinese POWs. Communist and Allied representatives also agreed that\r\ntruce talks would be resumed at Panmunjom, once the prisoner exchange\r\nwas completed.\r\n\r\n    [395] Hermes, _Truce Tent_, p. 415.\r\n\r\nSecurity precautions went into effect at both Panmunjom[396] and the\r\nentire Munsan-ni area, 10 miles southeast, on the first day of the\r\nprisoner talks. All facilities at both Panmunjom and Munsan-ni were\r\nplaced off limits to Eighth Army personnel not directly involved in\r\nthe operations. Regulations were strictly enforced. Even before the\r\nnegotiations opened at Panmunjom, actual construction work for LITTLE\r\nSWITCH was well under way by Marine engineers. “Operation RAINBOW,” as\r\nthe building of the facilities for the POW exchange was called, began 5\r\nApril.\r\n\r\n    [396] With resumption of truce negotiations, the 1st Marines,\r\n          whose left battalion sector was immediately adjacent to\r\n          the Panmunjom neutral zone between the two battle lines,\r\n          took certain precautionary measures. The regiment set\r\n          up radio communication with the UN base camp at Munsan\r\n          and reactivated its rescue task force. This unit was on\r\n          alert to evacuate the UN truce team from Panmunjom in\r\n          the event of Communist hostile action or any threat to\r\n          security. While the talks were in session, a forward\r\n          covering group, composed of a reinforced rifle company\r\n          and 1st Tank Battalion platoon, occupied the high ground\r\n          east of Panmunjom at COP 2. Here the Marine rescue\r\n          force maintained close surveillance of the enemy in the\r\n          Panmunjom peace corridor as well as the safe arrival and\r\n          departure of the UN truce team shuttled in by helicopter\r\n          or motor convoy. 1stMar ComdD, Apr 53, pp. 5, 14 and App.\r\n          II, pp. 1–4.\r\n\r\nIn a little over a day--actually 31 working hours--a task force of less\r\nthan 100 Marine construction personnel had erected the entire Freedom\r\nVillage POW recovery station at Munsan-ni. The special work detachment\r\nwas composed of men from Company A, 1st Shore Party Battalion, under\r\nMajor Charles E. Gocke, and attached to the engineer battalion; utility\r\npersonnel from Headquarters and Service Companies; and a Company D\r\nplatoon, 1st Engineer Battalion.[397]\r\n\r\n    [397] The battalion’s new commanding officer was Lieutenant\r\n          Colonel Francis “X” Witt, Jr., who a week earlier had\r\n          succeeded Lieutenant Colonel Francis W. Augustine.\r\n\r\nEarly Sunday morning the Marines moved their giant bulldozers, earth\r\nmovers, pans, and other heavy duty equipment into Munsan-ni. Ground\r\nleveling started at 0800 and work continued around the clock until\r\n0100 Monday. After a five-hour break the men dug in again at 0600 and\r\nworked uninterruptedly until 2000 that night. Furniture, tentage,\r\nand strongbacking stored at the 1st Engineer Battalion command post,\r\nmeanwhile, had been transported and emplaced. When it was all done\r\nthe Freedom Village complex, like ancient Gaul, had been divided into\r\nthree parts. The command area comprised receiving lines, processing and\r\npress tents, and related facilities for United Nations troops. Adjacent\r\nto this was the 45th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital tent, completely\r\nwood-decked, equipped for mass examinations and emergency treatment.\r\nAcross the road from the UN site proper was the area reserved for\r\nreturning South Korean prisoners, who would form the bulk of the\r\nrepatriates.\r\n\r\nAltogether the three camp areas represented some 35,100 square feet of\r\nhospital tentage, 84 squad tents, and 5 wall tents. Gravel to surface\r\nthree miles of standard combat road, plus two miles of electrical\r\nwiring, was hauled and installed. More than 100 signs, painted in\r\nKorean and English, were erected, as well as the large one that\r\nstretched clear across the road at the Freedom Village entrance. Six\r\nwelcome signs were raised above the UN and ROK processing tents, while\r\nanother mammoth Korean-English sign was installed at the Panmunjom\r\nexchange site.\r\n\r\nSpecial areas for ambulance parking; helicopter landing strips; five\r\n50-foot flagpoles; graded access roads and foot paths; sanitation\r\nfacilities; and storage areas for food, blankets, and medical\r\nsupplies were also constructed. And timing was important. It had been\r\nanticipated that the prisoner exchange might take place on short\r\nnotice. For this reason 1st Marine Division work and processing teams\r\nhad conducted their rehearsals so that they could complete all duties\r\nwithin 36 hours after first receiving the “go ahead” signal for the\r\nswitch.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Operation_ LITTLE SWITCH[398]\r\n\r\n    [398] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap 9; Commander\r\n          Naval Forces, Far East (ComNavFE), “Operation Little\r\n          Switch--Apr 53”; ComNavFE Rpt of Intelligence Processing;\r\n          ComNavFE Rpt, 24 Jul 53; FMFPac ComdD, Apr 53 (#1);\r\n          FMFPac ComdD, May 53 (Pt. 2), rpt LtCol Fisher to CG,\r\n          FMFPac, subj, “Debriefing of Returned POWs”; 1stMarDiv\r\n          ComdD, Apr 53; MacDonald, _POW_; Clark, _Danube to\r\n          Yalu_; Hermes, _Truce Tent_; Leckie, _Conflict_; Fugate,\r\n          “Freedom Village”; _New York Times_, 19–21 Apr 53;\r\n          _Washington Post_, 19–21 Apr 53.\r\n\r\nNine days after the truce talks were temporarily suspended, 11 April,\r\nOperation LITTLE SWITCH (code-named Little Swap) began the morning of\r\nMonday, 20 April. By the time it ended on 26 April, a total of 6,670\r\nNorth Korean and Chinese Communist prisoners had been returned by the\r\nUNC. The enemy released 684 captives,[399] of whom 149 were Americans.\r\nAmong them were 15 Marines, 3 Navy corpsmen who had been attached to\r\nthe 1st Marine Division, and a Navy aviator. The first day Allied\r\nprisoners--walking, some hobbling along on crutches, and others carried\r\non litters--were delivered in two groups. The initial 50 men reached\r\nPanmunjom at 0825, and the second group, two hours later. The first\r\nMarine freed was Private Alberto Pizarro-Baez, H/3/7, a Puerto Rican,\r\nwho had been captured at Frisco in the early October 1952 outpost\r\nclashes. Later that day, another POW taken in the same action, Private\r\nLouis A. Pumphrey, was also released.\r\n\r\n    [399] The 684 UNC prisoners returned in LITTLE SWITCH\r\n          represented 471 South Koreans, 149 Americans, 32 British,\r\n          15 Turks, 6 Colombians, 5 Australians, 2 Canadians, 1\r\n          Greek, 1 South African, 1 Filipino, and 1 Netherlander.\r\n\r\nEarly moments of the exchange were tense as UNC sick and wounded\r\ncaptives were shipped in a long line of CCF ambulances from Kaesong,\r\nfive miles northwest of Panmunjom, down the neutral corridor past enemy\r\nlines to the exchange point. Despite the fact that all official papers\r\nand agreements had been concluded more than a week earlier, no one was\r\nabsolutely sure until the last moment that the prisoner exchange would\r\nactually take place. The mechanics of the transfer operation itself, as\r\nit turned out, went off practically without hitch. One minor unsavory\r\nincident had occurred when 50 North Korean prisoners in UNC custody en\r\nroute from Pusan to Panmunjom, had dumped their mess kits into garbage\r\ncans, noisily complaining about breakfast.\r\n\r\nThere was also a long taut moment of uneasy silence when the first\r\nCommunist ambulance pulled up in front of the Panmunjom receiving\r\ncenter. An American MP, who in the excitement had gotten his orders\r\nconfused, forgot to tell the enemy driver where to turn. The ambulance\r\nalmost went past the center. A UN officer raced out to the road and\r\nmotioned to the driver, who backed around and pulled into the parking\r\nlot.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things the liberated POWs saw was the big sign\r\n“Welcome Gate to Freedom” raised the preceding night over the Panmunjom\r\nreceiving tents. Here they could get a cup of coffee and momentarily\r\nrelax before starting the long one-and-a-half hour ambulance trip south\r\nto Freedom Village. The returnees were outfitted in blue Communist\r\ngreatcoats, utilities, caps, and tennis shoes. Some of the men were\r\nbearded; some wore thin smiles; some had half-hidden tears in their\r\neyes. Primarily, there was a subdued and businesslike air to the day’s\r\nproceedings, however, with a marked absence of levity. Admiral Daniel,\r\nwhose UNC liaison group had negotiated the exchange, in commenting on\r\nthe smoothness of the first day’s operation observed: “It’s been a\r\ntremendous emotional experience for us all. Not much was said between\r\nus here, but we are all very happy.”[400]\r\n\r\n    [400] _New York Times_, dtd 20 Apr 53, p. 1.\r\n\r\nFrom Panmunjom all Allied prisoners were taken to Freedom Village at\r\nMunsan where they received a medical check, and the more seriously\r\nwounded were flown to a field hospital near Seoul. The first American\r\nprisoner to reach Freedom Village was an Army litter patient, Private\r\nFirst Class Robert C. Stell, a Negro. Helicoptered in from Panmunjom\r\nat 1007, he was treated “like a 5-star general by all hands, including\r\nGeneral Clark, UN commander.”[401] By noon the routine, agreed upon\r\nin the earlier exchange talks, was moving along evenly and would be\r\nin effect throughout the week-long exchange. The Communist quota was\r\n100 prisoners freed daily, in two groups of 50 each, while the Allies\r\nreturned 500. Thirty Americans were among the 100 UNC men released that\r\nfirst day.\r\n\r\n    [401] _Ibid._, p. 3.\r\n\r\nUpon their arrival at Freedom Village the Marine POWs, all of whom had\r\nbeen wounded prior to being captured, were greeted by representatives\r\nof the 1st Marine Division. In addition to General Clark, other ranking\r\nofficials on hand included Lieutenant General Maxwell D. Taylor,\r\nnew EUSAK commander, Major General Pollock, 1st Marine Division CG,\r\nBrigadier General Joseph C. Burger, in one of his first public duties\r\nsince assuming the post of assistant division commander on 1 April, and\r\nDr. Otto Lehner, head of the International Red Cross inspection teams.\r\n\r\nEach Marine prisoner was met by a 1st Division escort who gave\r\nhim physical assistance, if necessary, as well as a much-prized\r\npossession--a new utility cap with its Marine Corps emblem. Recovered\r\npersonnel received a medical examination. Waiting helicopters stood\r\nby to transport seriously sick or wounded Marines to the hospital\r\nships _Haven_ and _Consolation_ riding at anchor in the Inchon harbor.\r\nChaplains chatted as informally or seriously as a returnee desired.\r\nNewspapers and magazines gave the ex-prisoners their first opportunity\r\nin months to read unslanted news. And a full set of utility uniforms,\r\ntailored on the spot for proper fit, were quickly donned by Marines\r\nhappy to discard their prison blues.\r\n\r\nAlthough returnees received their initial medical processing at\r\nFreedom Village, no intelligence processing was attempted in Korea.\r\nWithin 24 hours after their exchange, returned personnel were flown to\r\nK-16 (Seoul) and from there to Haneda Air Force Base at Tokyo. Upon\r\narrival at the Tokyo Army Hospital Annex, a more detailed medical exam\r\nwas conducted, including a psychiatric interview by officials from\r\nthe newly formed Special Liaison Group of Commander, Naval Forces,\r\nFar East. Lieutenant Colonel Regan Fuller, USMC, was designated by\r\nComNavFE as OIC of the detailed briefing of all returned personnel at\r\nTokyo. Other Marine officers participating in the debriefings included\r\nLieutenant Colonel Thell H. Fisher and Major James D. Swinson, of\r\nFMFPac headquarters; Major Jack M. Daly, representing the 1st Marine\r\nDivision; and Captain Richard V. Rich, of the 1st Marine Air Wing.\r\n\r\nEach Marine returnee was interviewed by a two-man debriefing team\r\nthat consisted of a Marine and a Navy officer, the latter usually a\r\ncounterintelligence expert. The three-phase interrogation averaged 9–12\r\nhours and covered personal data, counterintelligence, and a detailed\r\nmilitary questionnaire. The latter, particularly, sought information\r\nabout UN personnel still held captive by the enemy. Since all of the\r\n15 Marine POWs had been captured relatively recently (either in the\r\nOctober outpost contests or the Vegas battle the previous month), the\r\ninformation they had about the enemy was of limited intelligence value.\r\nFrom debriefing reports of Marine returnees, many of whom brought\r\naddress books with them, it was learned that at least 115 more USMC and\r\nNavy prisoners were alive and still held in POW camps.\r\n\r\nUpon completion of counterintelligence processing, returned personnel\r\nwere available for press interviews. Long-distance telephone calls to\r\nparents or other family members were arranged by the Red Cross. Summer\r\nservice uniforms and campaign ribbons were issued, pay provided, and\r\nadministrative records updated by representatives dispatched by Colonel\r\nJohn F. Dunlap, Commanding Officer, Marine Barracks, Yokosuka.\r\n\r\nAll of the 19 Marine and Navy POWs had been released by 25 April.\r\nAfter final processing and clearance for return to the U.S. the men\r\nwere flown home, via Hawaii, in three groups that departed 28 April,\r\n30 April, and 4 May. Each was accompanied by a Marine Corps officer.\r\nMembers of the first contingent of POWs arrived at Travis Air Force\r\nBase, California, on 29 April, thereby completing their 7,000-mile\r\njourney from Communist prison camps. Another small group of POWs\r\nconsidered possible security risks were airlifted directly from Japan\r\nto Valley Forge Hospital, near Philadelphia, for further interviewing.\r\nNo Marines were among them. With the initial prisoner exchange\r\ncompleted, staffs of the major Far East commands began to prepare for\r\nthe final return of all POWs. Operation BIG SWITCH would take place\r\nafter the ceasefire that, hopefully, was not too far away.\r\n\r\nOn the day that Operation LITTLE SWITCH ended, 26 April, plenary\r\ntruce talks resumed at Panmunjom. The stormy issue of repatriation of\r\nprisoners, which had already prolonged the war by more than a year,\r\nwas still the one major problem preventing final agreement. There was\r\nindication, however, that the Communists appeared to be softening on\r\ntheir rigid insistence of forced repatriation. And, on 7 May, the\r\nCommunists accepted the UN proposal that nonrepatriate prisoners be\r\nkept in neutral custody within Korea (rather than being removed to a\r\nforeign neutral nation) and offered an eight-point armistice plan. With\r\nmodifications, this ultimately became the basis for the armistice.\r\nWhile discussions and disagreements continued on this proposal, another\r\nreal problem developed from a totally different source.\r\n\r\nSince early in April rumblings had been heard, through the polite\r\nambassadorial circuits, that Syngman Rhee, the aging South Korean\r\npresident, was dissatisfied with major truce issues. In particular, he\r\nwas disturbed over the possibility that Korea would not become reunited\r\npolitically. Further, Rhee gave indication that he might take some\r\nkind of action on his own. The Korean leader had advised President\r\nEisenhower that if any armistice was signed that permitted Chinese\r\nCommunist troops to remain south of the Yalu, with his country divided,\r\nhe would withdraw ROK military forces from the UN command. Since South\r\nKorean troops, backed by American specialized units, presently manned\r\nthe bulk of the UNC front line, Rhee’s threat to remove them from\r\nGeneral Clark’s command presented harrowing possibilities.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on 13 May, General Harrison, senior UN representative\r\nat Panmunjom, made a counterproposal to the Communist plan. This\r\nincorporated three measures aimed at reconciling differences in the\r\nlong-controversial repatriation issue.[402] Arguments flew back and\r\nforth at Panmunjom, with a temporary recess called in the talks; but\r\non 4 June the Communists accepted this UN final offer. The dispute of\r\n18 months’ duration had ended and the Allied principle of voluntary\r\nrepatriation had won out in the end. About the only homework left for\r\nthe negotiating teams was to map out final details of the Demilitarized\r\nZone.\r\n\r\n    [402] In brief, these were: (1) that the Neutral Nations\r\n          Repatriation Commission (NNRC) take custody of Chinese\r\n          nonrepatriates but give Korean POWs the option of\r\n          settling either in North or South Korea, as they wished;\r\n          (2) that troops from just one country (India) be used\r\n          to guard nonrepatriates, rather than the unwieldy\r\n          five-nation force earlier proposed by the Communists;\r\n          and (3), that specific procedures, which were clearly\r\n          spelled out, be followed for granting political asylum to\r\n          returning prisoners who refused repatriation.\r\n\r\nPresident Rhee now even more violently denounced the projected\r\narmistice plan. He declared that he and the Koreans would fight on\r\nalone, if necessary. South Korean delegates boycotted the Panmunjom\r\ntruce meetings, and Rhee began a campaign to block the cease-fire.\r\nFinal agreement on the POW issue was reached 8 June. It provided that\r\nthe NNRC offer a “civilian status” to former POWs who did not exercise\r\ntheir right of repatriation within four months after being taken into\r\ncustody by the commission. Those POWs who desired asylum would be set\r\nfree. The South Korean National Assembly unanimously rejected the truce\r\nterms the following day.\r\n\r\nRevision of the truce line, to correspond to current battle positions,\r\nand other concluding details of the truce were being settled by 17\r\nJune. On 18 June, chaos suddenly replaced progress. Acting on orders\r\nfrom Rhee, during early morning hours ROK guards at the South Korean\r\nprisons released approximately 27,000 North Korean anti-Communist POW\r\ninmates (the majority of the large group of NKPA who did not wish to\r\nbe repatriated). They quickly escaped and became absorbed into the\r\ncivilian populace of South Korea. Immediately the Communists charged\r\nthe Americans with complicity and demanded to know whether the United\r\nNations Command was able to control its South Korean ally or not.\r\n\r\nFor the next two weeks the American ambassadorial and military team\r\ntried to restore some measure of international good grace and hope to\r\nthe crisis. Daily talks (and pressure) took place with Rhee, as well\r\nas with the Communist negotiators, to set the course back on track\r\nagain in the direction of a final truce agreement. At the end of June,\r\nUNC Commander Clark was authorized by Washington to work out a way in\r\nwhich it would be possible to sign the tenuous armistice--without the\r\nKoreans, if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Interval Before the Marines Go Off the Line_[403]\r\n\r\n    [403] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9; 1stMarDiv\r\n          ComdD, Apr 53; 1stMarDiv PIRs 896–900, dtd 8–12 Apr 53;\r\n          1stMar, 5thMar, 7thMar, 11thMar, 2/5, 1/7, 2/11, 1st TkBn\r\n          ComdDs, Apr 53; VMAs-121, -212, -323, VMFs-115, -311,\r\n          VMF(N)-513 ComdDs, Apr 53.\r\n\r\nShortly after the heavy Vegas fighting in late March, Colonel Funk’s\r\n7th Marines, which had been in reserve, exchanged positions with the\r\n5th Marines. The new line regiment assumed responsibility for the\r\ncritical, action-prone right sector of the MLR on 4–5 April. In the\r\ncenter part of JAMESTOWN, the 1st Marines of Colonel Adams continued to\r\nman the MLR and its 12 outposts, including the strategic COP-2 tucked\r\ndown by the Panmunjom peace corridor. With the resumption of truce\r\ntalks on 6 April, this position had again taken on renewed importance\r\nwith its tank-infantry covering force of 5 armored vehicles and 245\r\nMarines on call at all times.\r\n\r\nAfter its relief from the MLR in early April the 5th Marines, as the\r\nnew division reserve unit, assumed the regular missions of serving\r\nas a counterforce for Marines in the I Corps sector, if required;\r\nmaintenance of the secondary KANSAS line; and a rigorous training\r\nprogram. On 10 April, the 3d Battalion moved out to the KANSAS position\r\nfor a two-day field exercise. By midmonth, spring thaws and heavy rains\r\nhad so weakened the trench and bunker fortifications of KANSAS that\r\nan all-out effort was temporarily diverted from refresher training\r\nto reconstruction. The 2d Battalion, meanwhile, under Operation Plan\r\n24-53, pursued an intensive five-day shore-based training program,\r\n7–11 April, in preparation for its coming amphibious exercise, MARLEX\r\nXX. On the 13th, BLT 2/5 under Lieutenant Colonel Finch, with armored\r\namphibian, tank, amtrac, and 1/11 detachments, proceeded to the landing\r\narea, Tokchok-to, one of the WCIDE command offshore islands southwest\r\nof Inchon. Battalion assault companies hit the southern Tokchok-to\r\nbeaches on D-Day, 15 April, according to schedule, although high winds\r\nand rough seas subsequently modified the exercise.[404]\r\n\r\n    [404] Official records are at variance on this point. The 2/5\r\n          command diary indicates that the battalion continued the\r\n          exercise on 16–17 April, returning the latter date. The\r\n          5th Marines report categorically indicates that MARLEX XX\r\n          was cancelled on 15 April, because of the weather.\r\n\r\nNot long afterward a training exercise involving UNC personnel got\r\nunderway when the 5th[405] and 1st Marines, together with the\r\nartillerymen, combined with the Army, ROK, and Commonwealth Division on\r\n20 April for a four-day I Corps command post exercise (CPX) EVEREADY\r\nGEORGE, not far from Seoul.\r\n\r\n    [405] Now under a new regimental commander, Colonel Tschirgi,\r\n          who had joined the 5th Marines on 14 April, succeeding\r\n          Colonel Walt, newly assigned division G-3.\r\n\r\nAlong the division front the war was still a daily survival contest,\r\ndespite the promising outlook at Panmunjom. The most ambitious attempt\r\nby the Chinese during the month took place over a three-day period\r\nin the right regimental sector, not long after the 7th Marines had\r\nmoved to the MLR. On 9 April, following a heavy two-hour ballistic\r\ndownpour of 2,000 rounds of enemy mortar and artillery, a reinforced\r\ncompany of about 300 Chinese soldiers launched a strong probe against\r\nCarson at 0345. Attacking in two echelons, the enemy approached from\r\nthe direction of Arrowhead on the north and the Reno ridgeline. In an\r\nhour’s time, the enemy had reached the Marine trenches and protective\r\nwire, at some places, and was being unceremoniously repulsed by the 1/7\r\ndetachment at Carson. For an hour and a half a heavy fire fight raged\r\nat the outpost while intruders and defenders battled at point-blank\r\nrange to settle the dispute.\r\n\r\nA reinforcement platoon, from 4/2/7, dispatched from the MLR at 0530,\r\nmade it as far as the newly established Marine outpost at Elko, about\r\n400 yards southeast of Carson, before being held up by a heavy shower\r\nof mortar rounds, and small arms fire. Tankers from the Company A\r\ndirect element[406] plus a section (two tanks) from the regiment’s\r\narmored platoon leveled their lethal 90mm fires to discourage the\r\nenemy, as did the defender’s barrage of 60mm, 81mm, and 4.2-inch\r\nmortars.\r\n\r\n    [406] Throughout the three-day action, gun tanks from Companies\r\n          A and B (the forward reserve unit) and the regimental\r\n          antitank company fired a total of more than 1,469 90mm\r\n          shells to neutralize enemy positions and weapons.\r\n\r\nTwo rocket ripples and 22 defensive fire concentrations unleashed by\r\n2/11, also in direct support of Lieutenant Colonel Henry C. Lawrence\r\nJr.’s 1st Battalion, plus additional reinforcing fires by batteries of\r\n1/11 and 4/11 drove off the enemy at 0700. As a security measure, a\r\ncompany from the regimental reserve (E/2/7) was assigned to Carson to\r\nbuttress the position and assist in reorganizing the outpost defense.\r\nThe enemy’s activity had cost him 60 known dead. Additional casualties\r\nwere estimated to be 90 killed and 70 wounded. Marine losses numbered\r\n14 killed, 4 missing, 44 wounded/evacuated, and 22 non-seriously\r\nwounded. Meanwhile, beginning at 0715, Marine prop-driven attack AUs\r\nfrom VMAs-212 and -323 and ADs from VMA-121 were aloft over prime\r\nChinese targets to perform CAS missions and MPQ drops.\r\n\r\nBetween the morning’s first strike and midafternoon the three MAG-12\r\nsquadrons completed 43 sorties and blasted enemy hills and weapons\r\npositions north of Carson with a total of 67½ tons of bombs. Later that\r\nnight three Chinese platoons, operating in small units, reappeared in\r\nthe Carson-Elko-Vegas vicinity to recover casualties. Although they\r\nreached an unoccupied caved-in bunker 50 feet from Carson, the enemy’s\r\nnocturnal activity only cost him more casualties from the COP’s defense\r\nfires: 15 known dead, 15 estimated killed, 7 known wounded, and 27\r\nestimated wounded.\r\n\r\nThe following day, Panther jets from Marine Fighter Squadrons 311 and\r\n115 contributed to the further destruction of hostile emplacements,\r\nbut the enemy himself was nowhere to be seen. Again that night,\r\nground-controlled radar bombing runs were made by VMA-121 and\r\nVMF(N)-513 to help keep the enemy off balance. In the early-morning\r\nhours of the 11th, however, a band of 30 grenade-slinging Chinese\r\nrenewed the assault on 7th Marines positions by attacking the reverse\r\nslope of Elko. This ambition was deterred by outpost organic weapons\r\nand box-me-in fires. After a brief fire fight the CCF withdrew, and\r\nthe two MAG-33 squadrons later that morning returned to station for\r\nCAS strikes against CCF trouble spots. Another raid on Carson began at\r\n2115 that night when 70 Chinese moved out from Ungok to the west ridge\r\nof the Marine position. Ten minutes later, Marine 81mm and 4.2-inch\r\nmortars, artillery, machine guns, and tanks forced them back with\r\napproximately 20 CCF killed and wounded to show for their efforts.\r\n\r\nA brief repeat action occurred the following night when two squads\r\nof Chinese reappeared at Elko, but they were dispatched by Marine\r\ninfantry, artillery, and armor direct fires following a 15-minute\r\nspirited exchange. During the night of the 12th[407] Chinese probes\r\nand harassing efforts diminished. Other than a few spotty, abortive\r\nskirmishes in the KMC sector, this pattern of reduced enemy effort\r\nwould continue for the next several weeks, until after the change of\r\nthe Marine line in early May. As the peace talks at Panmunjom were\r\nbeginning to show some progress, enemy psychological warfare efforts\r\nin the KMC, 1st, and 7th regimental sectors became more zealous,\r\nan indication of the Chinese attempt to increase their propaganda\r\noffensive. This included not only loudspeaker broadcasts and propaganda\r\nleaflet fired in mortar shells but a more unusual tactic, on 6 April,\r\nof enemy messages dropped over the COP Vegas area by airplane.\r\n\r\n    [407] This same date was significant because it marked the\r\n          first time a searchlight-guided night close air support\r\n          mission was flown by 1st MAW in the division sector.\r\n\r\nLittle ground action took place in the division sector throughout\r\nthe rest of the month. During the last three days of April, as the\r\noperational period for the Marines drew to an end, both infantry and\r\nartillery units noticed an unusual lull across the front. Marine\r\npatrols made few contacts, and there was a sharp decrease in the\r\nheavy enemy sightings of midmonth. Chinese incoming, in fact, during\r\nthe latter part of the month decreased markedly, with a total of 873\r\nrounds compared to the 4,149 tallied during the 1–15 April period. An\r\naverage of 58.2 rounds daily made it, in fact, the quietest period in\r\nthe Marine division sector since the holiday calm of late December when\r\nonly 84.2 rounds had fallen the last 10 days of the month.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The May Relief_[408]\r\n\r\n    [408] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9; 1stMarDiv\r\n          ComdDs, Apr-May 53; 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnls, 22 Apr-13 May\r\n          53; 1stMar ComdDs, Apr-May 53; 5thMar, 7thMar, 11thMar\r\n          ComdDs, May 53; 1st EngrBn ComdDs, Apr-May 53; Hermes,\r\n          _Truce Tent_.\r\n\r\nBy late April, plans had moved into high gear for relief of the 1st\r\nMarine Division by the 25th U.S. Infantry Division and transfer of the\r\nMarines to U.S. I Corps reserve at Camp Casey. Although the Marine\r\ndivision had been in active defense positions for 20 months (first in\r\nthe eastern X Corps and, for the past year, on the western front),\r\nsome observers noted that there was a reluctance to turn over their\r\npresently occupied positions and that the Marines were coming out\r\n“under protest from commanders who wanted the Division to remain on the\r\nline.”[409]\r\n\r\n    [409] News story (AP), Robert D. Tuckman, Seoul, dtd 12 May 53,\r\n          1stMarDiv ComdD, May 53, App. IX, p. 1.\r\n\r\nFor its part, the 25th Division, commanded by Major General Samuel T.\r\nWilliams, was to shift over to the I Corps far west coastal area from\r\nits own neighboring IX Corps sector on the right. Marine association\r\nwith the Army division went back to the early days of the war.[410]\r\nIn August 1950, when the Korean Conflict was then only a few weeks\r\nold, the 25th Division, with the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade and\r\nthe Army’s RCT-5, had spearheaded the first UN counteroffensive on the\r\nfar southern front, in the Sachon-Chinju area. Now fresh from its own\r\nrecent period in reserve[411] the 25th Division, including its attached\r\nTurkish Brigade, was to take over the 33-mile 1st Marine Division line,\r\neffective 5 May. Marine armor and artillery, however, would remain in\r\nsupport of the 25th Division and transfer to I Corps control.\r\n\r\n    [410] The two divisions had also seen combat together early in\r\n          WW II, at Guadalcanal. Col R. D. Heinl, Jr. ltr to Dir,\r\n          MCHist, HQMC, dtd 27 Sep 70, hereafter _Heinl ltr_.\r\n\r\n    [411] Soon after assuming command of the Eighth Army, in\r\n          mid-February, General Taylor had begun to stress the need\r\n          for a complete eight-week training program for reserve\r\n          divisions before reentering the line, detailed rehearsal\r\n          of patrols, and more frequent rotation of artillery\r\n          battalions to maintain their basic mobility. Hermes,\r\n          _Truce Tent_, p. 391.\r\n\r\nAnother change at this time affected the designation of the United\r\nNations MLR. Called Line JAMESTOWN in the I Corps sector (and variously\r\nin other parts of the EUSAK front as MISSOURI, DULUTH, MINNESOTA,\r\nand CAT), the Allied front was redesignated simply as “main line of\r\nresistance,” beginning 28 April, and was to be so known in all future\r\norders and communications throughout the entire Eighth Army. A further\r\nmodification dropped the reference “in Korea” from the acronym EUSAK,\r\nthe title becoming “Eighth U.S. Army.”\r\n\r\nIn the Marine sector, the last few days of April were a study in\r\ncontrasts. While Marine frontline infantrymen and cannoneers were\r\nhaving a comparatively peaceful interlude during this period of minimal\r\nCCF activity, division engineers were the proverbial colony of beavers.\r\nFollowing up their rigorous schedule in early April of building Freedom\r\nVillage from scratch within 36 hours, engineer personnel moved out from\r\nthe division sector late that month to begin construction of the rear\r\narea camps that would shortly be occupied by the Marines while in I\r\nCorps reserve.\r\n\r\nLocated approximately 15 miles east of the Marine MLR, the Camp Casey\r\nreserve complex consisted of three major areas. They were: the central\r\none, Casey, which gave its name to the entire installation and would\r\nhouse the new division CP and 5th Marines; Indianhead, to the north,\r\nwhere the 7th Marines, 1st KMC Regiment, Division Reconnaissance\r\nCompany, machine gun and NCO schools were to be established; and\r\nBritannia, to the south, assigned to the 1st Marines. Motor transport,\r\nengineer, and medical units in support of the respective regiments were\r\nto locate nearby.\r\n\r\nOn 27 April, the day after resumption of truce talks at Panmunjom,\r\nCompany A engineers began the work of clearing the camp site, erecting\r\nprefabricated buildings, and pioneering roads in the 7th Marines\r\nnorthern area. Two days later the 1st KMC Engineer Company was also\r\ndetailed to Indianhead for work on the 1st KMC Regimental camp. Company\r\nC engineers and Company A, 1st Shore Party Battalion, attached to the\r\nEngineer Battalion, meanwhile moved into the Casey sector to ready the\r\nrelocated Division CP and the 5th Marines camp.\r\n\r\nTactical relief of the 1st Marine Division officially began 1 May.\r\nBy the time it was over, four days later, more than 2,370 truckloads\r\nof Marine personnel and equipment had been used in the transfer to\r\nCamp Casey. Described another way: if placed bumper to bumper in a\r\ncontinuous convoy, this would have extended more than six miles, the\r\nlength of the MLR held by a Marine regiment in any major defense\r\nsector. As a preliminary step in the relief, on 29 April the division\r\nassumed operational control of several incoming Army artillery units\r\n(the 8th, 64th, 69th, and 90th Field Artillery Battalions, and the 21st\r\nAntiaircraft Automatic Weapons Battalion) plus elements of the Turkish\r\ncommand, including the TAFC Field Artillery Battalion. By midafternoon,\r\nthe first of the Army infantry relief personnel had also arrived in\r\nthe division sector, when elements of the three battalions of the 35th\r\nInfantry Regiment had reported in to respective 1st Marines[412] host\r\nunits, preparatory to assuming responsibility for the center sector of\r\nthe Marine line.\r\n\r\n    [412] The regiment was newly-commanded by Colonel Nelson, the\r\n          former UN Personnel and Medical Processing Unit officer,\r\n          who succeeded Colonel Adams as CO, 1st Marines on 1 May.\r\n\r\nOn 1 May the 5th Marines, then in reserve at Camp Rose, took over\r\nresponsibility for the 14th Infantry Regiment, designated as the\r\nArmy maneuver unit. Later that day, when Colonel Tschirgi’s regiment\r\nclosed its headquarters and moved out by motor march to Casey, control\r\nof the Army unit transferred to the division. The same day, the 1st\r\nKMC/RCT artillery battalion--which, like the 11th Marines units, was to\r\nremain on line although KMC infantry personnel were to move to I Corps\r\nreserve--came under control of I Corps; two days later an Army armored\r\nunit, the 89th Tank Battalion, rolled into position in the KMC rear\r\nsupport area and came under division command.\r\n\r\nThe 7th Marines right regimental sector, with its critical Nevada\r\nCities and two Berlin positions, became the new home for the Turkish\r\nbattalions of Brigadier General Sirri Acar in a four-day phased\r\noperation, beginning 0115 on 3 May. Actual bulk displacement of the\r\nfirst Marine MLR units and their respective outposts got underway on\r\nthis date, when responsibility for the 7th Marines left battalion\r\nsector transferred from 2/7[413] to the 1st Battalion, TAFC, and the\r\n7th Marines battalion began displacing to Indianhead. On the same day\r\nthe division opened its advance command post at Camp Casey.\r\n\r\n    [413] On 23 April, 2/7 had relieved 1/7 in the left battalion\r\n          sector and 1/7 became the regimental reserve. There was\r\n          no change in 3/7’s location in the right sector. These\r\n          were the positions for transfer with the Turkish troops\r\n          in early May.\r\n\r\nThe first Marine sector to complete the relief was the 1st Amphibian\r\nTractor Battalion, to the south of the Munsan-ni railhead; at midnight\r\non 4 May, with the assumption of sector responsibility by the Army\r\nTask Force Track, it moved to the logistical complex at Ascom City\r\nwhere it opened its new CP. Throughout the BMNT hours of 4 and 5 May,\r\nMarine positions were transferred to the incoming organic and/or\r\nattached units of the U.S. Army 25th Division. Relief of three of the\r\nmajor sectors in the Marine division line was thus well under way by\r\nthe early hours of the 5th. Final relief and its elaborate phasing\r\noperations were completed that morning. On the left flank, the 1st KMC\r\nwas relieved at 1030 by the incoming U.S. Army 27th Infantry;[414] 30\r\nminutes later, the 1st Marines was replaced in the line by the Army\r\n35th Infantry; and on the right, the 7th Marines sector was taken over\r\nby the TAFC. (See Map 28.)\r\n\r\n    [414] _ROKMC Comments._\r\n\r\nSharply at 1120 on 5 May,[415] the U.S. Army 25th Division assumed\r\nresponsibility for defense of the MLR in what had been the 1st Marine\r\nDivision sector for more than 13 months. At the same time all 25th\r\nInfantry Division units under operational direction of the division\r\nalso reverted to parent control. In addition to the Kimpo Regiment,\r\nseveral small Korean Service Corps and medical units retained in the\r\nsector also came under Army command.\r\n\r\n    [415] Final relief was largely complete at this time.\r\n          Exceptions were the 7th Marines reserve battalion, 1/7,\r\n          relieved by TAFC forces at 0350 the following day and a\r\n          few remaining Marine rear echelon elements that closed\r\n          out the sector on 7 May.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 28      K. White\r\n\r\n25th INFANTRY DIVISION SECTOR\r\n\r\nFOLLOWING RELIEF OF THE 1st MARINE DIVISION\r\n\r\n5 MAY 1953]\r\n\r\nI Corps Operation Orders No. 31 and 32 had directed that the 11th\r\nMarines remain on line in the sector attached to I Corps Artillery,\r\nwith a general support mission of reinforcing the fires of the 25th\r\nDivision artillery, and a secondary task of coordinating counterbattery\r\nsupport. The medium battalion, 4/11, and the 1st 4.5-inch Rocket\r\nBattery, furnished general support for I Corps. Regimental and\r\nbattalion CPs, as well as the rocket battery, continued to occupy their\r\nsame locations. A change affected the KMC artillery battalion, however;\r\nwhen transferred to I Corps artillery control it displaced from the\r\nMarine sector, with a new general support role of reinforcing the I\r\nCorps line.\r\n\r\nAlso on 5 May, at 1130, the 1st Tank Battalion[416] passed to 25th\r\nDivision control. Two companies, C and B, were assigned to the TAFC\r\n(which had no armored units) in the left and right battalion areas,\r\nrespectively. Company D vehicles came under command of the 35th\r\nInfantry Regiment, in the center sector; while A, the remaining\r\ncompany, was designated as the single reserve unit. This was a\r\nmodification of the Marine system of maintaining two tank companies\r\nin reserve, one a short distance behind the MLR and the other, at the\r\narmored battalion CP near Munsan-ni. A change in tactics also took\r\nplace when the Marine tanks came under Army operational control. It\r\nhad been the Marine practice to retain the tanks at the company CP\r\nfrom where they moved to prepared firing slots at the request of the\r\nsupported infantry unit.\r\n\r\n    [416] The 1st Tank Battalion was now commanded by Lieutenant\r\n          Colonel Charles W. McCoy, who had relieved Lieutenant\r\n          Colonel Williamson on 16 April 1953.\r\n\r\nWhen the 1st Tank Battalion was attached to the 25th Division, the\r\narmored vehicles were shifted to firing slots near the MLR where they\r\noccupied semifixed positions.[417] Armored personnel carriers (APCs)\r\nwere assigned by the Army to Company B and used by both B and C as\r\nresupply vehicles to haul food, water, fuel, and ammunition to the\r\ntanks on line. Also as part of the relief, control of the KMC tank\r\ncompany was transferred from the Marine 1st Tank Battalion to I Corps,\r\nalthough the company still continued in its same location in the old\r\nKMC sector.\r\n\r\n    [417] The tanks were not kept in exposed firing positions\r\n          at all times. They were parked in protected, defilade\r\n          revetments and were periodically driven into the firing\r\n          slots to zero in on targets of opportunity. One tank\r\n          might thus use any of several slots, and in cases of\r\n          major attacks reserve tanks could reinforce. LtCol\r\n          Robert J. Post ltr to Dir, MCHist, HQMC, dtd 28 May 70,\r\n          hereafter _Post ltr_.\r\n\r\nAlso remaining in their same positions were MASRT-1 (Marine Air Support\r\nRadar Team One), in support of the 25th Infantry Division, MTACS-2\r\n(Marine Tactical Air Control Squadron Two), and VMO-6. The mobile air\r\nsupport section of the observation squadron, however, had moved with\r\nthe 1st Marine Division to the new Casey area for participation in the\r\ncoming MARLEX operations scheduled during the reserve training period.\r\n\r\nThus with the relief completed, components of the old Marine division\r\nfront, from left to right, were: the Kimpo Provisional Regiment; Task\r\nForce Track; the 27th Infantry Regiment; 35th Infantry Regiment in the\r\ncenter sector, including its armor and heavy mortar company and 2d and\r\n3d Battalions forward, replacing the 1st Marines 3d and 1st Battalions;\r\nand in the right sector, the Turkish Brigade 4.2-inch mortar company\r\nand its 1st and 3d Battalions initially located[418] in the MLR\r\npositions vacated by the 2d and 3d Battalions, 7th Marines.\r\n\r\n    [418] Later, the Turkish forces were to place three battalions\r\n          forward [adding the 2d], with a fourth in reserve.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the 1st Marine Division railhead and truckhead at\r\nMunsan-ni and Ascom City, a subsidiary railhead/truckhead was opened\r\nat Tongduchon-ni, two miles southwest of the new division CP at Casey.\r\nNo change was made in the airhead at K-16. Effective with the 5 May\r\nchange, remaining elements of the division CP staff at Yongji-ri joined\r\nthe advance elements at Casey. As the Marines moved off the front\r\nlines they received “well-done” messages from the Commandant, General\r\nShepherd, and the U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander in Chief, Admiral\r\nArthur W. Radford, as well as the new I Corps Commander, Lieutenant\r\nGeneral Bruce C. Clarke[419] who cited the “excellence of the planning,\r\ncoordination and cooperation which enabled the operation of the past\r\nfew days to be successfully accomplished.”[420]\r\n\r\n    [419] General Clarke had succeeded General Kendall on 10 April\r\n          1953.\r\n\r\n    [420] CG, I Corps msg to CGs, 1stMarDiv, 25th InfDiv, dtd 6 May\r\n          53, in 1stMarDiv ComdD, May 53, App. I, p. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Training While in Reserve and Division Change of Command_[421]\r\n\r\n    [421] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt Eval Rpts_ No. 5.

Division Operation\r\nPlan 7-53 implemented this I Corps Plan “RESTORE” and set forth the\r\ndesignated blocking positions in the 25th Army, Commonwealth, 1st ROK,\r\nand 7th Army Division sectors in event of threatened or actual enemy\r\npenetration of the MLR.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Marine Division’s Training Order 8-53, issued on 6 May, the\r\nday after the relief was officially effected, outlined the training\r\nto be accomplished during the eight-week reserve period, 10 May-5\r\nJuly. Following a few days’ interval devoted to camp construction\r\nand improvement of facilities, an active training program commenced.\r\nIts objective was the continued improvement of amphibious and ground\r\noffensive combat potential of all personnel. Three major regimental\r\ncombat team MARLEXES were scheduled.[422] The training syllabus\r\ncalled for a four-phased progressive schooling from individual to\r\nbattalion and regimental level conducted in all phases of offensive,\r\ndefensive, and amphibious warfare. Weaponry familiarization, small unit\r\ntactics, and combined unit training, with tank-infantry deployment and\r\nintegration of helicopters at company-level exercises, were emphasized,\r\nculminating in a week-long field maneuver.\r\n\r\n    [422] Relief from the Eighth Army defense line provided the\r\n          first opportunity for expansion of the 1st Marine\r\n          Division amphibious training to regimental level.\r\n          Amphibious training in battalion-sized MARLEXES had\r\n          been under way since June 1952, upon transfer of the\r\n          Marines to the western coastal sector. This had, in\r\n          fact, “produced an extra dividend as [their] amphibious\r\n          retraining program, conducted throughout the summer in\r\n          the Tokchok Islands, was apprehensively observed by the\r\n          enemy.” Field, _NavOps, Korea_, p. 430.\r\n\r\nLectures were to be kept to a minimum, with at least 50 percent of\r\nthe tactical training conducted at night. Specialty training in\r\nintelligence, signal communications, antitank and mortar, machine gun,\r\nmine warfare, and staff NCO schools was also prescribed. Numerous\r\ncommand post exercises were programmed to obtain a high standard of\r\nefficiency in both battalion and regimental-level staff functioning.\r\nIt was the first time the division had been in reserve since a brief\r\ntwo-week period in late July-August of 1951. A brisk 40–44 hour week,\r\nplus organized athletics, insured that the training period was to be\r\nfully utilized.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost getting under way. At a staff conference with\r\nbattalion commanders on 11 May, General Pollock, division CG, stressed\r\nthe importance of using the time they were in reserve for enhancing\r\ndivision combat-readiness. Even as he spoke, his 5th Marines had the\r\nday before boarded ships at Inchon and were en route to the Yongjong-ni\r\nlanding area for MARLEX I. Since the 5th Marines, in division reserve,\r\nhad been the first of the regiments to displace and on 1 May had turned\r\nits sector over to the incoming 14th Infantry Regiment, it got the jump\r\non training during the reserve period. Regimental Operation Plan 12-53,\r\nof 28 April, had outlined requirements for the 5th Marines RCT LEX\r\n1; from 2–9 May the regiment had participated in a week of intensive\r\namphibious training, including reduced and normal distance CPX dry runs\r\nfor the coming MARLEX.\r\n\r\nWith ships from CTE 90.85,[423] and air defense by VMFs-311 and -115,\r\nColonel Tschirgi’s RCT-5 made the D-Day landing on 13 May with its two\r\nassault BLTs securing the objective. An unexpectedly shallow beach\r\ngradient and difficulties encountered in unloading vehicles from the\r\ncauseway resulted in less than a 100 percent performance rating. These\r\nwere deficiencies that might have been prevented had not the customary\r\nrehearsal been cancelled the previous day when a heavy fog obscured the\r\nlanding beaches. Besides regimental antitank and 4.2-inch mortar units,\r\nparticipating support elements included Company D, 1st Tank Battalion;\r\nCompany A, 1st Armored Amphibian Battalion; Company C, 1st Engineer\r\nBattalion; 1/11; and helicopters from HMR-161 and VMO-6.\r\n\r\n    [423] CTE 90.85 constituted the MARLEX training element of\r\n          TF-90, Amphibious Force Far East, redesignated Amphibious\r\n          Group Western Pacific earlier that month.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on 15 May, command post and subordinate units from the 1st,\r\n5th (less RCT-5 currently deployed in MARLEX I), and 7th Marines and\r\nsupport elements took part in a one-day division CPX at Camp Casey\r\nstressing mobility, security and operational procedures. Another CPX on\r\n22–23 May by 11th Marines and engineer personnel emphasized dispersion,\r\ncamouflage, and message handling under simulated combat conditions.\r\nUnits of the three infantry regiments plus the KMCs training with the\r\n7th Marines at Indianhead combined in a CPX-FEX (command post-firing\r\nexercise) on 26–27 May. Realism bowed to current ordnance supply\r\neconomics in that ammunition was carried for individual weapons, but it\r\nwould “not be loaded except on specific orders from an officer.”[424]\r\n\r\n    [424] 1stMarDiv msg to addees in 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl, dtd 22 May\r\n          53.\r\n\r\nThe CPX-FEX was held as a trial exercise for an Eighth Army CPX\r\nscheduled later in the month, which was postponed indefinitely on\r\n29 May because of the critical battlefront situation and continuing\r\nenemy attacks across the EUSAK front. Extensive preparations were also\r\nunderway for MARLEX II, with RCT-7, from 2–10 June; and concluding\r\nMARLEX III, scheduled 14–23 June, with RCT-1.\r\n\r\nArmor and advance regimental elements had left for the Ascom\r\nCity-Inchon staging area by 1 June, preparatory for departure to the\r\nYongjong-ni beaches on the Korean west coast in the vicinity of Kunsan.\r\nThe troop list included approximately 250 officers and 4,450 enlisted\r\nfrom Colonel Funk’s 7th Marines and support units, including USN and\r\nKMC. Infantry personnel from the regiment’s three battalions formed the\r\nthree assault teams plus a reserve battalion composed of 475 Korean\r\nMarines designated as BLT 5/KMC. Regimental support units included\r\nCompany C, 1st Engineer Battalion; Company D, 1st Medical Battalion;\r\nCompany C, 1st Shore Party Battalion; Company B, 1st Armored Amphibian\r\nBattalion, and various motor transport, amphibian truck, military\r\npolice, and helicopter detachments.\r\n\r\nR-Day on 5 June went off per schedule. Despite intelligence estimates\r\nwhich cheerily predicted that only “nine days of rain can be expected\r\nduring the month of June”,[425] RCT-7 drew one out of the barrel with\r\nits D-Day landing, 6 June. This took place during heavy rains and\r\ndecreased visibility which threw the boat waves off phase by minutes\r\nand required more than the allotted time for HMR-161 troop and cargo\r\nlifts.\r\n\r\n    [425] MAR RCT LEX II, Opn Plan I, App. 1 to Annex B, dtd 9 May\r\n          53, p. 1, in 7thMar ComdD, May 53.\r\n\r\nUse of a 144-foot-long M-2 steel treadway pontoon bridge loaned by the\r\nArmy, emplaced from the end of the causeway to the beach high water\r\nmark, was considered highly successful. It solved unloading problems\r\nencountered in the earlier MARLEX, in that all heavy equipment and\r\nvehicles were landed on the designated beaches. Further experimentation\r\nwith this novel employment of the M-2 was recommended to test the\r\ncoupling system of bridge and causeway during periods of heavy surf.\r\nOn the minus side, shore party officers noted that night transfer\r\noperations had been hindered because of the lack of running lights on\r\nthe amtracs.\r\n\r\nOn 9 June, as RCT-7 was on the way back from its amphibious exercise,\r\na directive from ComNavFE (Vice Admiral Robert P. Briscoe) notified\r\nthe division of cancellation of the forthcoming RCT MARLEX III. All\r\navailable shipping was being held on 24-hour readiness for the expected\r\nfinal repatriation of POWs (Operation BIG SWITCH). All afloat training\r\nexercises by Marine, Army, and Navy units between 6 June and 15 October\r\nwere to be cancelled.\r\n\r\nThe division was host to ranking I Corps, Eighth Army, Korean, and 1st\r\nCommonwealth officials when a special helicopter assault demonstration\r\nwas staged 11–12 June at Camp Casey. Two rocket launcher sections, 14\r\nHMR-161 copters, and 2/5 infantrymen were deployed to show the diverse\r\ncombat capabilities of the aerial workhorse. While in I Corps reserve,\r\nthe division was also host--and winner--of the I Corps Pistol Matches.\r\nAnd 3/11, which the previous month had taken the Army Training Test 6-2\r\n(a) Modified, was notified the battalion had scored 92.91 percent and\r\nreceived congratulations from the CGs, I Corps Artillery and Eighth\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nA change of command within the 1st Marine Division took place on 15\r\nJune with the arrival of Major General Randolph McC. Pate. The retiring\r\nCG, General Pollock, was presented the Distinguished Service Medal by\r\nthe I Corps commander, General Clarke, for his “outstanding success in\r\nthe defense of Carson, Vegas, and Elko.” The previous month, General\r\nPollock had received the Korean Order of Military Merit, Taiguk for his\r\nactive part in the formation, development, and training of the Korean\r\nMarine Corps. Attending the change of command ceremonies were General\r\nMegee, CG 1st MAW, General Schilt, CG AirFMFPac, and other Marine, I\r\nCorps, Commonwealth, and Korean senior officers.\r\n\r\nThe new 1st Marine Division CG was coming to his Korean post from Camp\r\nLejeune, N. C. where (like General Pollock before him) he had most\r\nrecently commanded the 2d Marine Division. Commissioned originally\r\nin the Marine Corps Reserve in 1921, General Pate was to later rise\r\nto four-star rank. Prior to World War II, he had seen expeditionary\r\nservice in Santo Domingo, in 1923–1924, and in China from 1927–1929,\r\nand also served in Hawaii. For his outstanding service and skill in\r\ncomplicated staff duties, first at Guadalcanal, and later during\r\namphibious operations at Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, General Pate\r\nhad been awarded the Legion of Merit and a Gold Star in lieu of a\r\nsecond Legion of Merit.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, he had served two tours as head of the Division Reserve,\r\nin 1946 and 1951. Other assignments included Director of the Marine\r\nCorps Educational Center at Quantico and Deputy Director of Logistic\r\nPlans in the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.[426]\r\n\r\n    [426] DivInfo, HQMC, Biography of Gen Randolph McC.

Shortly after 0200 on 15 May, the\r\nCCF directed a two-battalion probe on the Carson-Elko-Vegas trio and\r\nthe Berlin-East Berlin outposts newly held by the Turkish brigade.\r\nSupported by heavy concentrations of mortar and artillery, one\r\nbattalion of enemy soldiers moved against each of the two major defense\r\ncomplexes. Marine Company C tanks, occupying the firing slots that\r\nnight, accounted for heavy enemy losses in the action, estimated at\r\n200 CCF killed and 100 wounded. Assisting the TAFC Field Artillery\r\nBattalion in throwing back the attack were 1/11, 2/11, and 4/11 which\r\nsent 3,640 rounds into the sharp four-hour engagement.\r\n\r\nThe TAFC defense was further reinforced later that day with 21 air\r\nstrikes against hostile personnel and weapons positions north of the\r\nTurkish sector. Adding their weight to the clash, 3/11 and the rocket\r\nbattery also brought their guns into action, for a combined 5,526\r\nMarine rounds[428] dispatched against the enemy.\r\n\r\n    [428] Total ammunition expenditure by the 11th Marines and the\r\n          25th Division artillery batteries was 11,527 rounds,\r\n          to the Chinese output of approximately 10,000 rounds.\r\n          11thMarDiv ComdD, May 53, p. 13.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 25 May, after the UNC had made its final offer at the\r\ntruce talks, however, that CCF artillery really began to open up on\r\nthe Nevada complex. The increased activity by hostile pieces, during\r\nthe 25–27 May period, was duly noted by the artillery Marines who\r\nlaconically reported, “Operations followed the recent pattern: enemy\r\nshelling of the Turkish Brigade increased during the afternoon; no\r\ncontacts were reported.”[429]\r\n\r\n    [429] 11thMar ComdD, May 53, dtd 27 May, p. 19.\r\n\r\nThis latter situation changed abruptly on 28 May. Beginning at 1800,\r\nmajor elements of the Chinese 120th Division launched simultaneous\r\nattacks over 17,500 yards of I Corps front that stretched from COP-2\r\neastward to that consistent trouble-spot, the Nevada Cities, on to\r\nthe Berlins, and finally the Hook area in the adjacent Commonwealth\r\nDivision sector. Supported by heavy artillery fires, one CCF battalion\r\nmoved in towards Carson and Elko. Another battalion,[430] under cover\r\nof smoke, attacked central COP Vegas, while a third struck Berlin and\r\nEast Berlin on the right flank. Three hours after the initial attack,\r\ndefenders at Carson and Elko were engaged in hand-to-hand combat with\r\nthe Chinese.\r\n\r\n    [430] Some historians indicate that the 120th Division\r\n          initially sent four battalions forward in the action,\r\n          with two against the main objective, Vegas. Hermes,\r\n          _Truce Tent_, p. 463.\r\n\r\nBy midnight the men of the 35th Infantry had beaten back the attack at\r\nCOP-2. The Turks, likewise, were still in possession of the two Berlin\r\n(platoon-strength) outposts, but Commonwealth forces were involved in\r\na pitched battle at Ronson and Warsaw. The situation was even grimmer\r\nat this time in the Nevada Cities area outposted by the TAFC. Although\r\nthe Turkish troops continued to hold Vegas, where 140 men were dug\r\nin, Carson (two-platoon size) had fallen and Elko (platoon-strength)\r\nwas heavily besieged. Shortly thereafter, the 25th Division ordered\r\nthat the TAFC withdraw from the latter position to its own MLR. The\r\ndiversionary attack against Berlin-East Berlin had been broken off and\r\nthe twin positions were secured.\r\n\r\nDuring the first six hours of the attack, the night of 28–29 May,\r\nColonel Mills’ 11th Marines, now under I Corps command, had sent 9,500\r\nrounds crashing into Chinese strongpoints, while Marine air observers\r\ndirected eight missions against active enemy artillery positions.\r\nRipples from the 1st 4.5-inch Rocket Battery, transferred to the\r\nCommonwealth sector to support the Hook defense, were fired on CCF\r\ntroop activity there. Another curtain of flame engulfed the Carson\r\nintruders. When the fighting started, 15 Marine tanks were positioned\r\nin the Turkish sector. Company B and C vehicles, under Captains James\r\nM. Sherwood and Robert J. Post, relentlessly pounded the approaching\r\nCCF columns, while Company D was put on a 30-minute standby. As the\r\naction developed, additional tanks were committed until 33 were on line\r\nat one time or another.[431]\r\n\r\n    [431] Discussing the Army employment of tanks in fixed MLR\r\n          positions, Lieutenant Colonel Post recalled that although\r\n          many Marine tankers were originally opposed to this\r\n          procedure, “I am forced to confess that it worked well\r\n          in that static defensive situation.” A major advantage\r\n          resulting from this change was that tanks effectively\r\n          linked the MLR with rear area CPs through land line and\r\n          radio. While initial preparatory fire often tore out\r\n          the phone lines, the radios worked well and this was\r\n          “generally the only reliable means of communications with\r\n          the scene of action.” _Post ltr._\r\n\r\nWhen savage Chinese pummeling of the 25th Division outposts continued\r\nthe following day, Colonel Nelson’s 1st Marines was transferred at\r\n1315 to operational control of I Corps. The regiment’s three infantry\r\nbattalions, antitank, and heavy mortar companies promptly moved out\r\nfrom their Britannia headquarters and within two hours had relocated at\r\n25th Division bivouac areas south of the KANSAS line in readiness for\r\ncounterattack orders. The 1st Marine Division Reconnaissance Company\r\nwas similarly ordered to 25th Division control to relieve a 14th\r\nInfantry Regiment reserve company in position along the east bank Imjin\r\nRiver defenses.\r\n\r\nOverhead, close air support runs were being conducted by pilots of\r\nMarine Attack Squadrons 212, 121, and 323. A series of seven 4-plane\r\nstrikes hit repeatedly from noon on those Chinese troops, hardware,\r\nand resupply areas north of the 25th Division line. The aerial assault\r\ncontinued late into the night with MPQ missions executed by VMA-121 and\r\nVMF-311.\r\n\r\nDuring the 29th, control of the Vegas outposts--where 1st Division\r\nMarines had fought and died exactly two months earlier--changed hands\r\nseveral times between the indomitable Turkish defenders and the\r\npersistent Chinese. By dark, the CCF had wrested the northern crest\r\nfrom the TAFC which still held the southeastern face of the position.\r\nIn the 24-hour period from 1800 on the 28th through the 29th, the 11th\r\nMarines had expended 41,523 rounds in 531 missions. At one point in\r\nthe action Chinese counterbattery fire scored a direct hit on Turkish\r\ngun emplacements, knocking six howitzers out of action from the\r\nexplosions of charges already loaded. As a result 2/11, under its new\r\nbattalion commander, Major Max Berueffy, Jr., took over the direct\r\nsupport mission of the TAFC Brigade. Marine artillery spotters on\r\nstation from 0450 to midnight directed 42 fire missions on CCF guns,\r\nwhile the rocket battery unleashed 20 ripples against troop activity,\r\none of which caused 50 WIAs. Although an Allied counterattack early in\r\nthe day had restored Elko to friendly control, the enemy refused to be\r\ndislodged from Carson.\r\n\r\nI Corps had previously regarded the defensive positions of the Nevada\r\ncomplex as “critical,” with the TAFC having been “instructed to hold\r\nthem against all enemy attacks.”[432] By midday on the 29th, however,\r\nthe I Corps commander, General Clarke, and 25th Division CG, General\r\nWilliams, had apparently had a change of mind. The Vegas strength was\r\ndown to some 40 Turks. Altogether more than 150 men under the 25th\r\ncommand had been killed and another 245 wounded in defense of Nevada\r\npositions. It appeared that the Chinese, constantly reinforcing with\r\nfresh battalions despite estimated losses of 3,000, intended to retain\r\nthe offensive until the outposts were taken.\r\n\r\n    [432] Hermes, _Truce Tent_, p. 462.\r\n\r\nWith Carson and Vegas both occupied by the enemy, the Elko position\r\nbecame untenable without the support of its sister outposts. Six times\r\nthe CCF had crossed over from Carson to Elko to try to retake the\r\nlatter position, but had been thus far deterred by Allied firepower.\r\nAccordingly, at 2300, the 25th Division ordered its reserve 14th\r\nRegiment, earlier committed to the Elko-Carson counterattack, to\r\nwithdraw from Elko and the Turks to pull back from Vegas to the MLR.\r\nBy daybreak the withdrawal was completed and 25th Division and Turkish\r\ntroops had regrouped on the MLR.\r\n\r\nThe Army reported that more than 117,000 rounds of artillery and 67\r\nclose air support missions had buttressed the UNC ground effort.\r\nOfficial estimates indicated that in the three-day action the Chinese\r\nhad fired 65,000 rounds of artillery and mortar, “up to this point an\r\nunprecedented volume in the Korean War.”[433] The Marine artillery\r\ncontribution from its four active battalions during this 28–30 May\r\nperiod totaled 56,280 rounds in 835 missions.\r\n\r\n    [433] _Ibid._, p. 464.\r\n\r\nDuring the three-day siege, 15 to 33 Marine tanks poured their lethal\r\n90mm projectiles on the enemy from MLR firing slots. At times the\r\naction was so heavy that the tanks were refueled on line. As they ran\r\nout of ammunition and fuel, “armored utility vehicles of the battalion,\r\nwith a basic load of ammunition aboard, maneuvered beside the tanks\r\nin position and rearmed them on the spot,”[434] to permit virtual\r\nuninterrupted tank firing. One Marine was killed in the action the\r\nfirst night. Although 4,162 rounds of Chinese fire fell near the tank\r\npositions, no damage to materiel was reported. For their part the M-46s\r\nand flames were responsible for 721 enemy deaths, an estimated 137 more\r\nkilled, 141 wounded, and an estimated 1,200 injured.\r\n\r\n    [434] 1st TkBn ComdD, May 53, p. 3.\r\n\r\nDuring the second day of action, nearly 20 missions were flown by\r\nCorsairs and Skyraiders of the three Marine attack squadrons and the\r\njet fighters of VMF-311 and -115. Altogether throughout 28–30 May,\r\nMarine aircraft had flown no less than 119 sorties for the inflamed\r\nsectors of the U.S. Army 25th Division and adjacent British 1st\r\nCommonwealth Division. Of these, 99 were in support of the sagging\r\nCarson-Elko-Vegas-Berlins line.\r\n\r\nGround action ceased the following day as rain drenched the\r\nbattlefield, although the 11th Marines reported sightings of more than\r\n200 Chinese soldiers, most of them on the three recently lost outposts.\r\nBenched while the fierce battle was going on, the 1st Marines remained\r\nunder operational control of I Corps as a possible contingency force\r\nfrom 29 May to 5 June. On the latter date, following the Eighth Army\r\ndecision not to retake the Carson-Elko-Vegas outposts, the regiment\r\nreverted to Marine control and returned to Camp Britannia. The previous\r\nday the Communists had agreed on all major points of the UNC final\r\noffer and it appeared that a ceasefire was close at hand.\r\n\r\nDiplomats and military leaders both felt this latest Chinese assault\r\nwas to show a strong military hand and win dominating terrain features\r\nalong the MLR. Thus the enemy would be able to improve his defensive\r\nposture when final battlelines were adjusted at the truce. It was not\r\nbelieved that the CCF effort was an attempt to expand their operations\r\ninto a general offensive. In any event, the Nevada positions were\r\ndowngraded from their previous designation as major outposts. I Corps\r\nalso decreed no further effort would be made to retake them and that a\r\n“revaluation of the terrain in view of the destruction of the defensive\r\nwork indicates these hills are not presently essential to defense of\r\nthe sector.”[435]\r\n\r\n    [435] CG, I Corps msg to CG, 7thInfDiv, CG, 25thInfDiv, CG,\r\n          1stMarDiv, GOC, 1stComWelDiv, CG I Corps Arty, dtd 9 Jun\r\n          53 in 1stMarDiv ComdD, Jun 53, App. 1, p. 1.\r\n\r\nIf things were now relatively quiet along the battlefront of the\r\nI Corps coastal sector, the situation had begun to heat up in the\r\ncentral part of the UNC defense line. On 10 June, following a CCF\r\nrealignment of troops and supply buildup that had not gone unnoticed\r\nby Eighth Army intelligence officials, elements of the CCF 60th and\r\n68th Armies struck the ROK II Corps area, on the east-central front.\r\n(See Map 29.) Advancing south along both sides of the Pukhan River with\r\ntwo divisions, the Chinese struck at the ROK II defense line which\r\noriginally had bulged out to form a salient in the Kumsong vicinity.\r\nWithin six days the ROK line had been forced back 4,000 yards. In\r\nsubsequent assaults the enemy made new penetrations further west in the\r\nROK II MLR. Although the main Communist thrust was directed against the\r\nROK II Corps, secondary attacks were also made in the X Corps sector\r\neast of ROK II, in the Punchbowl area manned by the ROK 20th Division.\r\nIt was the heaviest, all-out drive since the CCF spring offensive of\r\nApril-May 1951, when the UNC had been pushed south approximately 30\r\nmiles across the entire Korean front.\r\n\r\nBy 18 June, the CCF assaults started to settle down. During the nine\r\ndays of flaming action, ROK units had suffered some 7,300 casualties\r\nto enemy losses of 6,600. Boundaries had been redrawn and three ROK\r\ndivisions had been redeployed in counterattacks to plug holes in the\r\nline that the Chinese had punched open. Nearly 15,000 yards of ROK\r\nfront had been pushed 4,000 yards south and several hill positions east\r\nof the Pukhan had been lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 29      K. WHITE\r\n\r\nEIGHTH ARMY SECTORS\r\n\r\n1 JANUARY-27 JULY 1953]\r\n\r\nThe brief respite ended 24 June when the CCF again directed heavy blows\r\nagainst the ROK troops, ignoring other UN forces in the Eighth Army\r\nline. It was generally considered a retaliatory move for the 18 June\r\nmass release of anti-Communist prisoners by South Korean President\r\nRhee. This time the major target of the renewed Chinese offensive was\r\nthe ROK 9th Division, in the IX Corps sector immediately west of the\r\nROK II Corps. On 25 June the 1st ROK Division on the eastern flank of\r\nI Corps, to the right of the 1st Commonwealth Division, was pounded\r\nby another Chinese division. Significantly, the date was the third\r\nanniversary of the invasion of South Korea.[436] The 7th Marines,\r\ntraining in I Corps reserve, was put on standby status. The regiment\r\nwas removed the following day when the 1st KMC/RCT (minus its 3d\r\nBattalion) was instead placed in readiness,[437] and subsequently moved\r\nout from its Indianhead area to be committed as a relief force in the\r\nleft sector of the 1st ROK line.\r\n\r\n    [436] The strong likelihood of such attacks at this time\r\n          had been noted by Eighth Army in a warning issued\r\n          the previous day that reminded all commanders to be\r\n          “particularly alert” at this time. CG, 8th Army msg to\r\n          CG, 1stMarDiv and addees, G-3 Jnl, dtd 24 Jun 53.\r\n\r\n    [437] This change was due to the existing policy of not having\r\n          a United States unit serving under operational control\r\n          of a Korean commander. Had the 7th Marines or other U.S.\r\n          unit been so committed, it is expected that a provisional\r\n          task force would have been created for the assignment,\r\n          under a non-Korean commander. _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6,\r\n          Chap. 9, p. 9-20. Actually, the 7th Marines alert on the\r\n          25th was of such short duration that no mention of it\r\n          appears in the regimental command diary, although the\r\n          fact is so noted in division records. The 1st KMC/RCT\r\n          was ordered to move out from the Indianhead area at 1630\r\n          on 26 June and came under operational control of 1st ROK\r\n          Division at 1540, 27 June. By 0100 the following day, it\r\n          had relieved 11th ROK Regiment. _ROKMC Comments._\r\n\r\nBy the 26th, the persistent Chinese probes of the 1st ROK sector had\r\nresulted in several forward outposts being overrun. To help stem the\r\naction the Marine 1st 4.5-inch Rocket Battery was displaced on I Corps\r\nArtillery order from its regular position (in the right regimental\r\nsector) 20 miles east to support the hard-pressed ROK division. On at\r\nleast two occasions the battery placed ripples between ROK positions\r\nonly 600 yards apart and it was felt that these “continued requests\r\nfor fire close to friendly troops attested to the gunnery of the\r\nunit.”[438] Between that date and the 30th, the rocket battery remained\r\nin the ROK sector, firing a total of 25 ripples. For the 25th Infantry\r\nDivision sector, however, the front continued undisturbed throughout\r\nthe entire month of June.\r\n\r\n    [438] 11thMar ComdD, Jun 53, p. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Developments in Marine Air_[439]\r\n\r\n    [439] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpts_ No. 4, Chap 10, No. 5,\r\n          Chap 9, No. 6, Chaps. 9, 10; 1stMarDiv ComdD, Apr 53; 1/7\r\n          ComdD, Apr 53, App. IV, Rpt of Night Air Strikes; 1st\r\n          MAW, MAGs-12, -33, VMAs-121, -212, -323, VMFs-115, -311,\r\n          VMF(N)-513, VMJ-1 ComdDs, Apr-Jun 53; VMA-312 ComdDs,\r\n          Apr-May 53; VMA-251 ComdD, June 53; VMO-6 ComdD, Apr 53;\r\n          Futrell, _USAF, Korea_; Hermes, _Truce Tent_.\r\n\r\nWhile the division was in I Corps reserve during the greater part\r\nof the April-June period, the 6,800-man 1st Marine Aircraft Wing\r\ncontinued its missions as an operational component of Fifth Air Force.\r\nFor the Marine air arm it was a time of a major tactical innovation,\r\na number of new air records set, and rapid personnel changes in the\r\nsquadrons.\r\n\r\nShortly before the Marine division went off the line, a new method of\r\nclose air support at night was introduced. This employed the use of two\r\nor more ground controlled 24-inch searchlights located on prominent\r\nterrain features along the MLR in the 7th Marines left battalion sector\r\nwhere the missions were to be flown. Enemy-held reverse slopes--in\r\nsome cases less than 500 yards from Marine positions--were thereby\r\npinpointed by the powerful intersecting searchlight beams. These long\r\npencil-shaped beams created an excellent artificial horizon and enabled\r\npilots to make bombing or strafing runs with a high degree of accuracy\r\neven on the blackest of nights. Manned by ANGLICO personnel, the lights\r\nwere employed either for target location or illumination (both shadow\r\nand direct). A tactical airborne observer in an OE light liaison plane\r\nof VMO-6 directed the searchlight teams and controlled the missions.\r\n\r\nA week of experimentation and trial runs to perfect the night close\r\nair support (NCAS) was conducted by several VMF(N)-513 pilots under\r\ndirection of Colonel Jack R. Cram. Formerly CO of Marine Air Control\r\nGroup Two at K-3, he had extended his tour in Korea to complete work\r\non the new program. On 12 April, the first night of operations, Major\r\nCharles L. Schroeder and Second Lieutenant Thomas F. St. Denis flew two\r\nnight support missions in F7F Tigercats. Although employed only a few\r\nweeks prior to the division going into reserve on 5 May, the new system\r\nrated an enthusiastic response from both pilots and ground commanders,\r\nall the way up to the division CG. As the latter reported to the\r\nCommandant following the first week of night close support missions,\r\n“results ... exceeded all expectations.”[440]\r\n\r\n    [440] CG, 1stMarDiv msg to CMC, dtd 18 Apr 53; in 1stMarDiv\r\n          ComdD, Apr 53, App. II, p. 2.\r\n\r\nBetween 12 April and 5 May, the night fighter squadron conducted 58\r\nNCAS sorties in the division right sector employing this new control\r\nsystem with excellent results.[441] The procedure was a marked success\r\nand made it possible to provide continuous 24-hour-a-day close support\r\nto Marine infantry units. It was considered a supplement to, not a\r\nreplacement for the MPQ (radar controlled bombing) missions of MASRT-1.\r\nPlans called for F9F aircraft to be integrated into the program, since\r\nthe F7F Tigercats were being replaced by jets. Allied psychological\r\nwarfare teams on 17 April introduced a different theme in their\r\nbroadcasts to the enemy: that of the dangers to the CCF from the new\r\nsearchlight marking of targets. As a Marine training bulletin noted:\r\n“It is believed that this method of attack by aircraft is particularly\r\ndemoralizing to the enemy because he is unable to anticipate where\r\nthe strike will hit, and therefore has no means of defending himself\r\nagainst it.”[442]\r\n\r\n    [441] Confirmed damage assessment in this period: 75 enemy\r\n          KIA, 5 WIA; 25 bunkers, 12 personnel shelters, 20 mortar\r\n          positions, 32 automatic weapons positions, 1 ammunition\r\n          bunker, and 1 37mm AA position destroyed; 1 supply area,\r\n          3 weapons damaged; 1,545 yards trenchline destroyed;\r\n          and 190 secondary explosions or fires. Due to operating\r\n          conditions, these figures represented only 80 percent of\r\n          the total flights made on which TAOs confirmed results.\r\n          VMF(N)-513 ComdDs, Apr-May 53.\r\n\r\n    [442] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9, p. 9-106, quoting\r\n          1stMarDiv Training Bulletin No. 5-53, dtd 10 Jun 53.\r\n\r\nAnother tactical improvement about this same time dealt with artillery\r\nflak suppression in support of close support aircraft. Two refinements\r\nmade in the procedure in the late spring of 1953 involved firing of\r\nHE rounds during the actual run of planes over the target. Basically,\r\nthe plan consisted of releasing a TOT or VT concentration on the most\r\nlucrative enemy antiaircraft positions within a 2,500-yard circle\r\naround the strike area. A continuous rain of HE-fuzed projectiles was\r\nplaced on these targets for a three-minute period, during which Marine\r\nplanes made their runs.\r\n\r\nFavorable results were achieved in that new system tended to keep enemy\r\nantiaircraft gunners off-balance for a longer period of time and thus\r\ndecreased the danger to friendly attacking aircraft. On the other hand,\r\npilots quickly noted that this became an “unimaginative employment of\r\nan unvarying flak suppression schedule which Communist AA gunners soon\r\ncaught onto and turned to their own advantage.”[443]\r\n\r\n    [443] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 10, p. 10-70.\r\n\r\nWith respect to squadron hardware, Marine combat potential increased\r\nsubstantially during the spring months with the phasing out of F7Fs in\r\nNight Fighter Squadron 513 and introduction of the new F3D-2 twin-jet\r\nSkyknight intruder. By late May the Allocation of 24 of these jet\r\nnight fighters had been augmented by 4 more jets from the carrier USS\r\n_Lake Champlain_ and the squadron “assumed its primary night-fighter\r\nmission for the first time in the Korean War.”[444] While the sturdy,\r\ndependable Tigercats[445] made their final contribution to the United\r\nNations air effort early in May with the experimental NCAS program, the\r\nnew Skyknights continued the squadron’s unique assignment inaugurated\r\nin late 1952 as night escort to Air Force B-29 bombers on their strike\r\nmissions. Not a single B-29 was lost to enemy interceptors after 29\r\nJanuary 1953. The capabilities of the skilled Marine night-fighters\r\nwere noted in a “well done” message received by the CO, VMF(N)-513 in\r\nApril from the Air Force.[446]\r\n\r\n    [444] _Ibid._, p. 10-99.\r\n\r\n    [445] Also characterized by squadron members as the “tired old\r\n          Tigercats” in reference to the war-weary, 1945-vintage\r\n          aircraft. VMF(N)-513 ComdD, May 53, p. 6.\r\n\r\n    [446] CO, 19th Bomber Group (Col Harvey C. Dorney, USAF)\r\n          msg to CO, VMF(N)-513 (LtCol Robert F. Conley), n.d.,\r\n          reading: “19th Bomber Group Airborne Commander and crews\r\n          participating in attack on Sinanju Bridge Complex, 11\r\n          April, have high praise for night fighter protection. All\r\n          feel that without their protection severe damage or loss\r\n          of B-29’s would have resulted.” VMF(N)-513 ComdD, Apr 53,\r\n          p. 6.\r\n\r\nOrganizational changes within the wing included the arrival, on 29\r\nMay, of a new MAG-12 unit to replace the “Checkerboard” squadron.\r\nVMA-332 (Lieutenant Colonel John B. Berteling) was slated to operate\r\non board the USS _Bairoko_ (CVE-115) for the F4U carrier-based\r\nsquadron VMA-312[447] due for return to CONUS. Veteran of 33 months of\r\ncombat while attached to the wing as West Coast (CTE 95.1.1) aerial\r\nreconnaissance and blockade squadron, VMA-312 (Lieutenant Colonel\r\nWinston E. Jewson) was officially relieved 10 June. The change,\r\nmoreover, was the first phase of a new personnel policy, carrier unit\r\nrotation, that was expected to implement a unit rotation program for\r\nland-based squadrons. It was anticipated that the new unit rotation\r\nprogram would eliminate inherent weakness of the individual pilot\r\nrotation system and thus increase the combat effectiveness of the\r\nwing.[448]\r\n\r\n    [447] Prior to early May, VMA-312 had been based aboard the USS\r\n          _Bataan_ (CVL-29). The carrier itself was scheduled for\r\n          relief from the Korean Theater shortly before the new\r\n          afloat MAG-12 squadron reported in, and a transfer was\r\n          made by 312 to the new, larger escort carrier on 8 May.\r\n\r\n    [448] Comments _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 10, p. 10-33:\r\n          “Severe tactical operations weakness developed throughout\r\n          the war in Korea which can be traced directly to the\r\n          individual pilot rotation system. These weaknesses are\r\n          inherent in any system which precludes pre-combat unit\r\n          training of pilots in the tactical squadron with which\r\n          they later go into combat. The situation is aggravated\r\n          further when pilots, many of them inadequately pre-combat\r\n          trained, are rotated through combat engaged units so\r\n          rapidly that squadron esprit cannot develop to a degree\r\n          which will insure a high standard of tactical efficiency.”\r\n\r\nDuring the period other organizational changes included transfer\r\nof administrative control of VMF(N)-513 on 15 May from MAG-33 to\r\nMAG-12.[449] The squadron, with its new twin-engined jet fighters,\r\nmoved from K-8 (Kunsan) further up the coast to the MAG-12 complex at\r\nK-6 (Pyongtaek), upon completion of the new 8,000-foot concrete runway\r\nthere. This phased redeployment of nightfighter personnel and equipment\r\nbegan in late May and was concluded on 6 June without any interim\r\nreduction of combat commitments. Replacement of the squadron F7F-3Ns\r\nwith F3D-2s was also completed in early June.\r\n\r\n    [449] MAG-12, since 1 April, had been under Colonel Edward B.\r\n          Carney, who assumed command upon reassignment of Colonel\r\n          Bowman to the States.\r\n\r\nLate that month, plans were underway for two additional changes:\r\nthe Marine photographic squadron, VMJ-1, was due to be separated\r\nadministratively and operationally from MAG-33 on 1 July and revert\r\nto 1st MAW; and Marine Wing Service Squadron One (MWSS-1) was to be\r\ndeactivated, effective 1 July.\r\n\r\nThe change of command relationships between CG, FAF and CG, 1st MAW\r\nearlier in the year[450] which had restored operational control of\r\ncertain designated Marine air units to the wing commander, increased\r\nthe efficiency of 1st MAW operations. Despite the fact that VMJ-1 at\r\ntimes contributed nearly 40 percent to the total FAF input of all\r\ndaylight combat photographs,[451] aerial intelligence (both pre-\r\nand post-strike photos) supplied to wing and group headquarters was\r\nconsidered inadequate. As a MAG-33 intelligence officer commented with\r\nsome exasperation as late in the war as May 1953:\r\n\r\n    [450] See Chapter VI.\r\n\r\n    [451] The magnitude of the VMJ-1 work load “can be gauged by\r\n          one day’s peak effort of 5,000 exposures, which, if laid\r\n          end to end, would cover a strip of ground one and one\r\n          half miles long.” _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, Chap. 10, p.\r\n          10-67.\r\n\r\n  The Section continued to experience difficulty in obtaining\r\n  1:50,000 scale overlays of friendly MLR and OP positions. These\r\n  overlays are important for making up target maps for close\r\n  support missions, but they are continually held up for long\r\n  periods by higher echelons, and, if received here at all, are\r\n  then often too old to be considered reliable.[452]\r\n\r\n    [452] MAG-33 ComdD, May 53, p. H-2.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, at the individual squadron level, the carrier unit VMA-312\r\nshortly before its relief, reported: “The one limitation on squadron\r\nactivities continued to be photo coverage of the strikes. With limited\r\nfacilities available, the squadron has no clear cut pictures of strike\r\nresults.”[453] Return of VMJ-1 to operational control of General Megee\r\nultimately “gave the Wing adequate photo-intelligence for the first\r\ntime since commencement of combat operations in Korea.”[454]\r\n\r\n    [453] VMA-312 ComdD, May 53, p. G-2.\r\n\r\n    [454] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 10, p. 10-65.\r\n\r\nIndoctrination of new replacement personnel within the 1st Marine\r\nAircraft Wing took a swift upturn during the spring period. Pilots\r\nwho had completed 100 combat missions were transferred to staff duty\r\nelsewhere in the wing in Korea or rotated Stateside. The average\r\nsquadron personnel strength ran to 88 percent of T/O for enlisted; and\r\nofficer strength, considerably less, frequently dipped as low as 61\r\npercent. Under the 100-missions policy, it was a time of rapid turnover\r\nof unit commanders, too, as witnessed from the following squadron diary\r\nentries:\r\n\r\n  _VMA-212_--Lieutenant Colonel James R. Wallace assumed command\r\n  from Major Edward C. Kicklighter, effective 19 June; the latter\r\n  had been squadron ExO and acting CO in interim period following\r\n  30 April departure of former CO, Lieutenant Colonel Smunk;\r\n\r\n  _VMA-323_--Lieutenant Colonel Clarence H. Moore vice Lieutenant\r\n  Colonel Frash, on 11 April; and Major Robert C. Woten succeeding\r\n  Lieutenant Colonel Moore on 27 June;\r\n\r\n  _VMA-121_--Major Richard L. Braun vice Lieutenant Colonel Hughes,\r\n  on 21 April;\r\n\r\n  _VMF(N)-513_--Lieutenant Colonel Ross S. Mickey vice Lieutenant\r\n  Colonel Conley, on 6 May; in June, Lieutenant Colonel Robert\r\n  L. Conrad, acting CO, named CO for Lieutenant Colonel Mickey,\r\n  hospitalized for injuries received in a May aircraft accident;\r\n\r\n  _VMJ-1_--Lieutenant Colonel Leslie T. Bryan, Jr. vice Lieutenant\r\n  Colonel William M. Ritchey, on 15 May;\r\n\r\n  _VMF-311_--Lieutenant Colonel Arthur M. Moran vice Lieutenant\r\n  Colonel Coss, on 21 April; Lieutenant Colonel Bernard McShane\r\n  vice Lieutenant Colonel Moran, on 1 June;\r\n\r\n  _VMF-115_--Lieutenant Colonel Lynn H. Stewart vice Lieutenant\r\n  Colonel Warren, 5 June.\r\n\r\nWith respect to CAS activities, excellent weather in April--only a\r\nsingle day of restricted flying--brought the 1st MAW air tally that\r\nmonth for its land-based squadrons to 3,850 effective combat sorties\r\n(440 more by VMA-312) and 7,052.8 combat hours. This was a substantial\r\nincrease over the preceding months. Not surprisingly, the average daily\r\nsortie rate for the month was correspondingly high: 128.3. Of 1,319\r\nCAS sorties the largest proportion, 579 and 424 (43.9 percent, 32.1\r\npercent), were for Marine and ROK operations, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding day of the month was 17 April. During the 24-hour\r\nreporting period, 262 sorties were completed by MAGs-33 and -12\r\npilots,[455] who expended a combined total of 228.3 tons of bombs\r\nand 28,385 rounds of 20mm ammunition. For the two MAG-33 fighter\r\nbomber squadrons, it represented maximum effort day. Preparation had\r\nbeen made a week earlier to devise the targeting and best all-round\r\nflight schedules for ordnance and line sections. Objective areas for\r\nthe mass attack were picked by the wing G-3 target selection branch\r\nand approved by the EUSAK-Fifth Air Force JOC. It was decided that\r\n“flights of eight aircraft staggered throughout the day would offer the\r\nbest efficiency in expediting reloading and refueling with not more\r\nthan sixteen aircraft inactive on the flight line at one time.”[456]\r\nThroughout the day, from 0410 to 2030, VMFs-311 and -115 continuously\r\npounded designated targets in support of the U.S. 7th and 3d Infantry\r\nDivisions.[457] Commented MAG-33:\r\n\r\n    [455] Between 15–18 April the west coast carrier squadron\r\n          was under a FEAF order restricting normal interdiction\r\n          missions. This was to protect UNC sick and wounded POWs\r\n          in transit from China to Kaesong for final exchange\r\n          at Panmunjom. VMA-312 air operations were held to CAS\r\n          along the bombline. “Marine fliers of the ‘Checkerboard’\r\n          squadron proved adept at this unusual role [CAS support\r\n          missions along the front lines], and received a ‘well\r\n          done’ from JOC Korea as the Corsairs flew more than 100\r\n          close air support sorties from 16–18 April.” _PacFlt\r\n          EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 10, p. 10-110.\r\n\r\n    [456] MAG-33 ComdD, Apr 53, p. 51.\r\n\r\n    [457] Their respective locations were: 7th Division, at the\r\n          extreme right of I Corps sector; and further east, the\r\n          3d Division occupied the corresponding right flank of IX\r\n          Corps sector. VMF-311 concentrated on the 7th Division\r\n          targets while VMF-115 efforts were devoted primarily to\r\n          the 3d Division.\r\n\r\n  Hitting an all-time high in the annals of memorable days, this,\r\n  the seventeenth of April not only further proved MAG-33’s ability\r\n  to cripple the enemy’s already diminishing strength but it also\r\n  allowed VMF-115 to set records in total airborne sorties launched\r\n  in a single day plus a record total ordnance carried and expended\r\n  in one day by jet type aircraft.[458]\r\n\r\n    [458] MAG-33 ComdD, Apr 53, p. 51.\r\n\r\nVMF-115 alone, with 30 pilots and 23 aircraft, had flown 114 sorties\r\nand delivered 120 tons of bombs on North Korean targets.\r\n\r\nA sample of the intensity of this maximum day was a series of three\r\nearly-morning interdiction strikes led by three VMF-115 pilots that\r\nlaunched the effort. Led by Lieutenant Colonel Joe L. Warren, Major\r\nSamuel J. Mantel, Jr., and Major John F. Bolt, the 23 attacking Panther\r\njets lashed the objective with 22.35 tons of ordnance and 4,630 rounds\r\nof 20mm ammunition. The three missions destroyed half of the buildings\r\nand inflamed 95 percent of the target area in the enemy supply\r\nconcentration point T’ongch’on on the Korean east coast.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, wing operations in May were considerably hampered by the\r\nbad weather peculiar to this time of the year in Korea. Restricted\r\nflying conditions were recorded for 18 days of the month. A total of\r\n153 CAS sorties were flown for the Marine division before its 5 May\r\nrelief from the front lines. Of the wing’s 3,359 sorties[459] during\r\nthe month, 1,405 were for close support to forward units beating back\r\nCommunist encroachment efforts. The allocation of CAS sorties was\r\n412 for U.S. infantry divisions (including 211 for the 25th Division\r\noccupying the customary Marine sector); 153 for the 1st Commonwealth\r\nDivision at the Hook which the Communists assaulted on 27–28 May as\r\npart of their overall thrust against western I Corps defenses; 412\r\nsorties for ROK units; and 63, miscellaneous. Heaviest action for\r\nMarine aviators took place towards the end of the month to thwart\r\nenemy blows in the I Corps sector where Army and Turkish units were\r\nattempting to repulse the Chinese.\r\n\r\n    [459] This figure does not include sorties by VMA-312\r\n          (carrier-based), VMO-6, or HMR-161, the latter two under\r\n          operational control of the 1st Marine Division.\r\n\r\nThe renewed effort of the Chinese Communists against UNC ground forces\r\nin late May continued sporadically the following month. A number of new\r\nrecords were set by Marines flying CAS assignments under the Fifth Air\r\nForce. During the intense mid-June attacks on the ROK II Corps area\r\nand adjacent X Corps sector, MAGs-12 and -33 pilots chalked up some\r\nbusy days. Between 10–17 June, Marine, Navy, and Air Force aircraft\r\nhad flown 8,359 effective sorties, the bulk of this massive FAF\r\neffort to buttress the crumbling ROK defense. Of this number, Marine\r\nsorties totaled 1,156, or nearly 14 percent. (Combat sorties for the\r\n1st MAW throughout June came to 3,276 despite 23 days of marginal to\r\nnonoperational weather.) Marine pilots scored as high as 48 percent\r\nof a single day’s interdiction strikes made by FAF. This occurred 15\r\nJune when the 1st MAW flew a record-breaking 283 sorties, followed by\r\nanother peak 227 sorties the next day.\r\n\r\nActually, when the ground situation in the ROK II Corps front began to\r\ndeteriorate on 12 June, the new Fifth Air Force commander, Lieutenant\r\nGeneral Samuel E. Anderson, “waived the [3,000 foot] minimum-altitude\r\nrestrictions on his fighter-bombers and ordered his wings to give\r\nall-out support to the Eighth Army.”[460] The Seventh Fleet commander,\r\nAdmiral Clark, likewise kept his carriers on line for seven days and\r\nordered its naval pilots to “team with Marine and Fifth Air Force\r\nairmen for a close-support effort exceeding anything up to that\r\ntime.”[461] When the ROK II Corps defenses cracked open on 15 June,\r\ntemporary clearing weather “allowed General Anderson and Admiral Clark\r\nto hit the Reds with everything they had. FEAF planes flew a total of\r\n2,143 sorties of all kinds for the largest single day’s effort of the\r\nwar.”[462]\r\n\r\n    [460] Futrell, _USAF, Korea_, p. 631.\r\n\r\n    [461] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n    [462] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nCommenting on this heavy action period, 14–17 June, a dispatch to\r\nGeneral Megee from the new FAF commander, who had succeeded General\r\nBarcus the previous month, noted:\r\n\r\n  The figures are now in. From 2000, 14 Jun 53, to 0001, 17 Jun\r\n  53, Fifth Air Force units flew a total of 3,941 combat sorties.\r\n  The cost was 9 pilots lost, 11 aircraft lost, 11 aircraft major\r\n  damage, 42 aircraft minor damage. The results: 1 enemy offensive\r\n  stopped cold. I very deeply appreciate the splendid efforts of\r\n  all members of the 5th AF at all levels. Only a concerted team\r\n  effort made the foregoing possible.[463]\r\n\r\n    [463] CG, FAF msg to CG, 1st MAW, dtd 17 Jun 53, in 1st MAW\r\n          ComdD Jun 53 (Vol I), p. 3 and App., IV (Vol III).\r\n\r\nThis came, incidentally, only five days after receipt by the 1st Marine\r\nAircraft Wing of the Korean Presidential Unit Citation.[464] The award\r\ncited the wing’s “outstanding and superior performance of duty” between\r\n27 February 1951 and 11 June 1953. During this period Marine fliers\r\nexecuted more than 80,000 combat sorties for UNC divisions.\r\n\r\n    [464] Presentation of this second Korean PUC to the 1st MAW\r\n          was made by South Korean President Rhee in impressive\r\n          ceremonies 12 June at MAG-33 headquarters, K-3. Among\r\n          the many ranking military officials attending the\r\n          ceremony was Admiral Radford, former CinCPacFlt, and\r\n          newly-appointed Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.\r\n\r\nThe fighter-bombers of MAG-33 and the MAG-12 attack planes saw heavy\r\naction during 24–30 June when the Chinese again concentrated their\r\nattention on ROK divisions in the UNC line. Peak operational day was 30\r\nJune. Marine squadrons alone executed 301 sorties, including 28 percent\r\nof the CAS and 24 percent of total FAF interdiction missions. It was\r\nalso an outstanding day for MAG-12 which “outdid itself by flying 217\r\ncombat sorties against enemy forces. The 30th of this month saw MAG-12\r\nestablish a new ordnance record when an all-time high of 340 tons of\r\nbombs and napalm were dropped on North Korea.”[465] Contributing\r\nheavily to this accomplishment was Marine Attack Squadron 121. It\r\nunleashed 156 tons of ordnance, a squadron record. It was believed this\r\nalso established an all-time record for tonnage expended on the enemy\r\nby a Marine single-engine propeller squadron.\r\n\r\n    [465] MAG-12 ComdD, Jun 53, p. C-1.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Marine Defense Activities_[466]\r\n\r\n    [466] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpts_ No. 5, Chaps. 2, 8, No.\r\n          6, Chaps. 2, 9; WCIDE(U) ComdDs, Oct 52-Jun 53; ECIDE(U)\r\n          ComdDs, Oct 52-Jun 53; Cagle and Manson, _Sea War,\r\n          Korea_; Field, _NavOps, Korea_.\r\n\r\nLike their counterparts on the Korean mainland, the Marines, naval\r\ngunfire teams, and ROK security troops comprising the West Coast and\r\nEast Coast Island Defense Commands felt the alternating pressure\r\nbuild-up and slow-down that typified the closing months of the war.\r\nAt both installations the defense had been recently strengthened,\r\nmore or less by way of response to a CINCPacFleet intelligence\r\nevaluation in December 1952. This alerted the isolated island forces\r\nto the possibility of a renewed Communist attempt to recapture their\r\npositions. The Allied east coast defense structure at Wonsan, right at\r\nthe enemy’s own front door just above the 39th Parallel, was considered\r\nparticularly vulnerable.\r\n\r\nAs in the preceding months, the mission of the west coast island group\r\nremained unchanged--namely, the occupation, defense, and control of\r\nits six island components. These, it will be remembered, were: Sok-to,\r\nCho-do, Paengyong-do (command headquarters), Yongpyong-do, and the two\r\nlesser islands at Taechong-do and Tokchok-to.[467] Formal designation\r\nof the island commands was modified on 1 January 1953. At this time\r\nthe West Coast and East Coast Island Defense Elements (TE 95.15 and\r\nTE 95.23) were redesignated as Task Units (TU 95.1.3 and TU 95.2.3)\r\nrespectively. Korean Marines, who represented the bulk of these task\r\nunits, were provided from the 2d KMC Regiment, the island security\r\nforce. This unit constituted the main defense for the important U.S.\r\nMarine-controlled islands off the Korean west and east coasts.\r\n\r\n    [467] Locations given on WCIDE map, Chapter II.\r\n\r\nApproximately 17 Marine officers and 100 enlisted men were assigned\r\nto the western coastal complex, with two battalions of Korean Marines\r\nfleshing out the garrison defense. The primary mission of this\r\nisland group was to serve as offshore bases for UNC intelligence\r\nactivities, including encouragement of friendly guerrilla operations\r\nconducted by anti-Communist North Korean personnel. Artillery based\r\non the Marine-controlled islands provided both defensive fires and\r\ncounterbattery missions against enemy guns sited on the nearby mainland.\r\n\r\nThe secondary mission of WCIDU, that of training Korean troops in\r\ninfantry and weapons firing exercises, continued to be hampered\r\nsomewhat by faulty communication. As one officer observed, the training\r\nprogram to qualify selected KMCs for naval gunfire duties “met with\r\nonly modest success, due primarily to the language barrier and lack\r\nof communications equipment in the Korean Marine Corps. Personnel\r\nwho had received this training did prove to be extremely helpful in\r\naccompanying raiding parties on the mainland in that they were able to\r\ncall for and adjust fires.”[468]\r\n\r\n    [468] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9, p. 9-128. See also\r\n          Chapter II.\r\n\r\nEnemy pressure against the West Coast Islands, both from Communist\r\nshore guns and bombing, had increased during the fall and winter of\r\n1952. Cho-do, shaped roughly like a giant downward-plunging fish, as\r\npreviously noted had been bombed in October for the first time in the\r\nhistory of the command. This new trend was repeated for the next two\r\nmonths. By way of response, two 90mm guns were transferred to Cho-do\r\nfrom Kanghwa-do (a more peaceful guerrilla-controlled island northwest\r\nof Inchon) for use there as counterbattery fire against aggressive\r\nmainland batteries. The islands of Sok-to and Paengyong-do had\r\nlikewise been bombed during this period, although no damage or serious\r\ncasualties resulted. In December, enemy shore guns fired 752 rounds\r\nagainst Task Force 95 (United Nations Blockading and Escort Force)\r\nships charged with responsibility for the island defense, in contrast\r\nto the 156 rounds of the preceding month.\r\n\r\nIntelligence in December from “Leopard,” the friendly Korean guerrilla\r\nunit at Paengyong-do, also reported the presence of junks, rubber\r\nboats, and a nearby enemy artillery battalion off Chinnampo, believed\r\nto be in readiness to attack the island. A captured POW, moreover,\r\non 22 December reported that elements of the 23d NKPA Brigade located\r\non the mainland across from Sok-to would attempt to seize the island\r\ngroup before the end of the year. The next day, shortly after dusk,\r\nwhen a concentration of 200 rounds[469] of 76mm suddenly fell on\r\nSok-to, and another 125 rounds struck neighboring Cho-do, it looked as\r\nif it might be the beginning of trouble. Naval gunfire (NGF) spotters\r\non the islands directed the fire from UNC patrol boats cruising the\r\nYellow Sea. This counterbattery fire quickly silenced the enemy guns.\r\nAgain, at the end of the month, West Coast islands were alerted for an\r\ninvasion, but it never materialized.\r\n\r\n    [469] An average day’s enemy harassment consisted of 4, 7, 10,\r\n          or at the most approximately 28 rounds of fire. WCIDE\r\n          ComdDs, _passim_.\r\n\r\nA matter of continuing concern to the command during the fall and\r\nwinter months was the North Korean refugee problem. So serious was the\r\nsituation, in fact, that it had warranted a directive from the TF 95\r\ncommander (Rear Admiral John E. Gingrich). In the early fall, a large\r\nnumber of refugees had filtered into the West Coast Islands, raising\r\nserious doubts as to their feeding and ultimate survival during the\r\nKorean winter. Through the United Nations Civil Assistance Command, a\r\ntentative date of September had been set for evacuating these North\r\nKorean refugees to South Korea. By November the question of their\r\nrelocation was still not settled, although the feeding problem had been\r\neased somewhat by two LST-resupply loads of emergency rations and grain\r\nby CTF 90.\r\n\r\nActivities followed a fairly consistent pattern during early 1953,\r\nwith harassing fire striking the islands from the North Korean shore\r\nbatteries and sporadic bomb and propaganda drops. Periodically USAF\r\npilots who had strayed off course, planes from the nearby British\r\ncarriers HMS _Glory_ or _Ocean_, or Marine fliers from USS _Badoeng\r\nStrait_ or _Bataan_ made emergency landings on the beach airstrips\r\nat Paengyong-do for engine repairs or refueling. Logistical support\r\ncontinued to be a problem, due to the peculiarities of the joint\r\nordering system through the Army. In January the western islands had\r\nunfilled requisitions dated from as early as February 1952. Official\r\nunit reports also noted the difficulty of obtaining medical supplies\r\neither promptly or in full.\r\n\r\nIn April, with the hot-cold cease-fire talks again taking one of their\r\nspasmodic upswings, WCIDU commander, Colonel Harry N. Shea, conferred\r\nwith American and British naval officials regarding CTG 95.1’s (Royal\r\nNavy Commander, West Coast Blockading and Patrol Group) Operation\r\nPANDORA. This called for the evacuation of Sok-to and Cho-do, the two\r\nWCIDU islands north of the 38th Parallel, at the time of the armistice.\r\n\r\nIncreased naval gunfire and artillery missions against active\r\nenemy mainland targets, caves, and observation posts gave the two\r\nnew 90mm guns delivered to the Sok-to garrison the month before\r\nand the pair already at Cho-do, as well as their gun crews, some\r\nunscheduled practice. Marine garrison personnel at the two islands\r\nand nearby patrol ships were busy 25 days of the month knocking out\r\nor neutralizing Communist mainside batteries. Late that month, the\r\nbattleship USS _New Jersey_ stationed off the east coast, sailed around\r\nthe Korean peninsula to add its 16-inch guns to the bombardment. Enemy\r\nshelling of the two western islands increased in June, with 1,815\r\nrounds expended in response by the two Marine gun sections.\r\n\r\nDuring June, as it appeared the end of the war was in sight, the\r\nfirst phase of PANDORA got underway with the evacuation by CTF 95 of\r\napproximately 19,425 partisans, their families, and refugees from\r\nSok-to and Cho-do to islands south of the 38th Parallel. A new WCIDU\r\ncommander, Colonel Alexander B. Swenceski, had also arrived by this\r\ntime, since the average tour of duty was but a brief four months at\r\nboth island commands.\r\n\r\nAcross the Korean peninsula, the east coast Allied offshore island\r\ndefense centered on a cluster of islands in Wonsan Harbor. Situated\r\nmore than 100 miles north of the battleline, these strategically-placed\r\nislands comprised the northernmost UN-held territory in Korea. The East\r\nCoast Island Defense Command numbered approximately 35 Marines, 1,270\r\nKorean Marines, and 15 Naval personnel. Headquarters for TU 95.2.3 was\r\nYo-do, the largest installation, which was garrisoned by approximately\r\n300 Korean Marines and a limited detachment of USMC and USN personnel.\r\nSmaller defense forces were located on the other islands under ECIDU\r\ncommand.[470] In addition, an improvised NGF spotting team was also\r\nstationed at the three forward islands (Mo-do, Tae-do, and Hwangto-do).\r\nMission of the ECIDU was a defensive one: to hold the islands as a\r\nbase for covert intelligence activities. The island defense system\r\nexisted for the purpose of “containing and destroying any enemy forces\r\nwho escape detection or who press home an attack in the face of Navy\r\nattempts at their destruction.”[471]\r\n\r\n    [470] See Chapter II and ECIDE map.\r\n\r\n    [471] ECIDE ComdD, Oct 2, p. 1.\r\n\r\nIndividual island commanders were responsible for the defense of their\r\nsmall parcels of seaborne real estate, control of both defensive and\r\noffensive NGF missions in the area, and evaluation of intelligence\r\nregarding enemy troop locations, the movement of supplies north, or\r\nnew emplacements of hostile guns. Fire support for the ECIDU islands,\r\nexposed to the enemy shore batteries above the 39th Parallel, was\r\navailable from Task Force 95, which maintained a task, group of ships\r\noff both the east and west coasts. Aircraft and ships of Task Force\r\n77 (Seventh Fleet Striking Force), operating off the East Korean\r\ncoastline, were also on call. In December, for instance, the Corsairs\r\nof TF 77 had resumed their rail-bridge interdiction. All-out attacks on\r\nrailroad and highway bridges, as well as bombing runs on the 90-mile\r\nstretch of east coast railroad from Hungnam to Songjin, were undertaken\r\nto cut off supplies being moved north for Communist industrial use.\r\n\r\nFebruary marked the second anniversary of the siege of Wonsan by the\r\nUNC, the longest blockade of a port in recent U.S. history. Some\r\nnaval authorities by this time argued that the venture had become one\r\nof doubtful merit which “should never have been undertaken, but its\r\nlong history made it difficult to abandon without apparent admission\r\nof defeat.”[472] In any event, the month also signaled increasing\r\nattention paid by hostile shore batteries to the little island enclave.\r\nFor seven consecutive days, 9–15 February, the harbor islands were\r\ntargets for enemy mixed artillery and mortar shells. Minor materiel\r\ndamage and casualties were sustained at Yo-do during a Valentine’s Day\r\nbombardment, 14 February.\r\n\r\n    [472] Field, _NavOps, Korea_, p. 434.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the enemy harassed the harbor islands for 16 days during\r\nthe month, expending 316 rounds, compared with 11 days in January.\r\nHostile fire, not limited to the Wonsan Harbor islands, was also\r\ndirected against friendly ships USS _DeHaven_ and USS _Moore_. These\r\nprovided counterbattery fire and were, in turn, fired upon, the nearest\r\nshells landing only 400 yards from the two vessels. This attack,\r\nalso on 14 February, was described as an “unusually determined and\r\nprecise”[473] effort. The enemy, moreover, did not appear to take his\r\nusual precautions with respect to disclosing his positions. The fact\r\nthat a Communist shore battery would cease fire when subjected to\r\nfriendly counterbattery, with other positions then immediately taking\r\nup the delivery, “indicated some sort of central control for the first\r\ntime.”[474] The I Corps, NKPA artillery units across from the Wonsan\r\nIsland command revealed the “heavy, effective artillery capability of\r\nenemy batteries which encircle Wonsan Harbor.”[475]\r\n\r\n    [473] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 2, p. 2-5.\r\n\r\n    [474] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n    [475] ECIDE(U) ComdD, Feb 53, p. 1. Seventh Fleet intelligence\r\n          estimated that there were no less than “21 active\r\n          batteries emplaced on Wonsan Bay and within range of our\r\n          islands.” _Heinl ltr._\r\n\r\nUnseasonably good weather the latter part of February improved the\r\ntransportation and supply situation. With the bitter cold and wind\r\nsubsiding, maintenance crews could repair the ravages of the past\r\nseveral months. Craft, up to LCVP size, were hoisted in on a large\r\npontoon for repair. For most of December and January, “this small,\r\nphysically remote Marine Corps command,”[476] as the ECIDU commander,\r\nLieutenant Colonel Robert D. Heinl, Jr. himself described it, had\r\nbeen snowbound. Winds howled in excess of 40 knots, and temperatures\r\ndropped to 10° below at night. Personnel at the command island,\r\nYo-do, subsisted on C rations for eight days. With boating operations\r\nsuspended because of the high winds, it was not possible to send\r\nsupplies or water to Hwangto-do which for several days relied solely on\r\nmelted snow.\r\n\r\n    [476] ECIDE(U) ComdD, Jan 53, p. 3.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged foul weather, moreover, interrupted all classified radio\r\ncommunications between the ECIDU and the outside world. Crypto guard\r\nfor the Wonsan islands was maintained by elements of the East Coast TG\r\n95. Coded and decoded security radio messages had to be picked up by\r\npatrol boat which could not reach the islands during extreme conditions\r\nof icy seas and heavy snows.\r\n\r\nAs with the men on the front line, the Communists stepped up their\r\npressure and gunfire against the island command Marines during\r\nMarch. The record[477] 524 rounds which fell on the ECIDU islands\r\nin March doubled the following month when the command received 1,050\r\nrounds from active mainland batteries. In April the persistent NKPA\r\nartillerymen kept up a continuing bombardment of the eastern coastal\r\nUNC islands, missing only three days of the entire month, that caused\r\nnine casualties when a direct hit was made on the Tae-do CP bunker. It\r\nwas the highest rate of incoming since UN occupation of the islands.\r\nAnother April record was enemy mine laying, which increased sharply\r\nin both the WCIDU and ECIDU command areas. A total of 37 mines were\r\nsighted, the highest number since August 1952. Communist shore gunners,\r\nin addition to harassment of the island themselves, fired 2,091 rounds\r\nagainst TF 95 ships, another all-time high.\r\n\r\n    [477] Another record at this time was the spate of senior\r\n          visiting officers. Seven times during the month no less\r\n          than 15 flag and general officers had taken their turn\r\n          inspecting the ECIDU command headquarters at Yo-do.\r\n          Services represented were the Marine Corps, U.S. Army,\r\n          Korean Marine Corps, ROK Navy, and ROK Army. “One local\r\n          statistician computed the total number of stars for the\r\n          month (one side of the collar only) as 38,” the monthly\r\n          report brightly noted. This was believed possibly an\r\n          all-time high for any headquarters in the Korean theater,\r\n          short of the Eighth Army. ECIDE(U) ComdD, Mar 53, p. 1.\r\n\r\nWith respect to personnel, the situation had improved markedly. An\r\nincrease in ECIDU command strength authorized by CG, FMFPac in March\r\nprovided for an additional 9 Marine officers, 38 enlisted Marines,\r\nand 6 Navy personnel. These were exclusive of the current detachments\r\nof 1st ANGLICO shore party and naval maintenance personnel, and\r\nrepresented nearly a 40 percent strength increase.[478] Not long\r\nafterward the new ECIDU commander, Lieutenant Colonel Hoyt U. Bookhart,\r\nJr., arrived to succeed Lieutenant Colonel Heinl, who had held the\r\nposition since the preceding November.\r\n\r\n    [478] The previous T/O for the ECIDU was 5 officers and 30\r\n          enlisted USMC, 15 USN attached primarily to the Navy\r\n          maintenance unit, and 55 officers and 1,217 enlisted KMCs.\r\n\r\nAs with the WCIDU force, by late spring it appeared that the days of\r\nUNC control and occupation of the east coast islands were numbered.\r\nIn view of the imminent armistice, a CinCFE directive of 11 June\r\ncalled for the evacuation of all civilians, supplies, and equipment\r\n“in excess of immediate needs.”[479] This was a preliminary step\r\ntowards full evacuation of the islands once the armistice agreement was\r\nreached. Accordingly, on 11 June, as evacuation of the friendly west\r\ncoast partisans got under way, villagers from Yo-do, the largest and\r\nECIDU headquarters site, and the far northern island of Yang-do were\r\nsimilarly moved south. The evacuation was completed by mid-June.\r\n\r\n    [479] ECIDE(U) ComdD, Jun 53, p. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Division is Ordered Back to the Front_[480]\r\n\r\n    [480] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9; 1stMarDiv,\r\n          1stMar, 5thMar, 7thMar ComdDs, Jun 53.\r\n\r\nA rash of political activity in June markedly affected the tenor\r\nof military operations in Korea. Intensified Communist aggression\r\nbroke out north of ROK sectors in the Eighth Army line, largely as\r\na reaction to President Rhee’s unprecedented action on 18 June of\r\nfreeing, with the help of ROK guards, approximately 25,000 North\r\nKorean anti-Communist prisoners at POW camps in the south. Other\r\nanti-Communist POWs at Camp No. 10, near Ascom City, staged violent\r\nbreak-out attempts at that same time and Company A, 1st Amphibian\r\nTractor Battalion passed to operational control of the camp commanding\r\nofficer there to help prevent a repetition of any such incidents in the\r\nfuture. Following a recess of truce talks, pending a clarification of\r\nthe status of the current military-diplomatic agreements, key delegates\r\nheld crisis meetings at Panmunjom and Tokyo to get the beleaguered\r\ntalks back on track.\r\n\r\nDespite the furor, signing of the armistice agreement was expected\r\nshortly. As a result, the Munsan-ni Provisional Command was\r\nreorganized with the 1st Marine Division assigned the responsibility\r\nof reactivating the United Nations Personnel and Medical Processing\r\nUnit for the anticipated post-truce exchange of prisoners of war. This\r\nwas to be conducted along lines similar to that for Operation LITTLE\r\nSWITCH, the initial limited exchange. The Division Inspector was named\r\nprocessing unit commander and functional sections (S-1, S-2, S-3, S-4,\r\ninterpreters, messing, medical, engineer) were also activated. As the\r\ndivision training tour in I Corps reserve drew to a close, a number of\r\nregimental CPXs were held during June. And the 5th Marines drew a new\r\nassignment: training in riot control. Following civilian demonstrations\r\nthat had erupted in various populated areas of Eighth Army, including\r\nthe I Corps sector, the regiment was ordered “to be prepared to move\r\nin battalion size increments, to be employed as army service area\r\nreserve in suppression of civil disturbances anywhere in army service\r\narea.”[481]\r\n\r\n    [481] 5thMar ComdD, Jun 53, p. 1.\r\n\r\nWhile the Marine infantry regiments concluded their training period,\r\nthe 1st Tank Battalion, Kimpo Provisional Regiment, and Division\r\nReconnaissance Company remained under operational control of the\r\nfrontline U.S. 25th Infantry Division. Marine artillerymen likewise\r\ncontinued under orders of CG, I Corps Artillery, in the forward area,\r\nreinforcing division artillery fires. Tentative plans were underway for\r\nmovement of the 1st Marine Division back to its former position on the\r\nMLR in early July. After the signing of the cease-fire, the division\r\nwould comply with provisions of the truce agreement by closing out its\r\nformer MLR and withdrawing to designated positions two kilometers south\r\nof the former defensive positions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nHeavy Fighting Before the Armistice\r\n\r\n_Relief of the 25th Division--Initial Attacks on Outposts Berlin and\r\nEast Berlin--Enemy Probes, 11–18 July--Marine Air Operations--Fall of\r\nthe Berlins--Renewal of Heavy Fighting, 24–26 July--Last Day of the War_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relief of the 25th Division_[482]\r\n\r\n    [482] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: _Pac Flt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9;\r\n          1stMarDiv ltr to CMC 3/cpc, A16-13, n.d., Subj: Berlin\r\n          and East Berlin Action, Rpt of, in 1stMarDiv Summary\r\n          of Activities, Jul 53 (G-3) file (Records Group 127,\r\n          61A-2265, Box 74, FRC, Alex., Va.), hereafter _CG,\r\n          1stMarDiv, Berlin Rpt_; 1stMarDiv ComdD, Jul 53;\r\n          1stMarDiv G-3 Jnls, 1–9 Jul 53; 1stMar, 5thMar, 7thMar,\r\n          11th Mar, 1st TkBn, 1/7, 2/7, 3/7, 2/11 ComdDs, Jul 53.\r\n\r\nFor the first week of July the 1st Marine Division continued its\r\nmission as I Corps Reserve and its two-month period of intensive combat\r\ntraining that had begun on 5 May. Planning got under way on 1 July,\r\nhowever, for return of the division to its former sector of the MLR, as\r\nthe western anchor of I Corps, in relief of the 25th Infantry Division.\r\n\r\nMarine infantry components were directed by I Corps to effect the\r\ntransfer of operational control during the night of 7–8 July. Tank and\r\nartillery units--already in the division sector throughout the reserve\r\nperiod--were to make whatever minor relocations were necessary at\r\nsuitable times thereafter. Division Operation Plan 10-53 ordered the\r\n7th Marines to reassume its responsibility for the right regimental\r\nsector of the MLR, eastward to the 1st Commonwealth boundary. The 5th\r\nMarines, which had been in reserve at the time of the May relief of\r\nlines, was assigned to the center sector of the MLR, while the 1st\r\nMarines was designated as divisional reserve.\r\n\r\nRelief of the 25th Infantry Division by Marine units got underway on\r\n6 July when the first incoming elements of Colonel Funk’s 7th Marines\r\nmoved up to the right regimental sector manned jointly by the U.S.\r\n14th Infantry Regiment and the Turkish Armed Forces Command. Advance\r\npersonnel reported into the left sector, to be taken over by the Marine\r\n1st Battalion, and at 1400 the 3d Battalion relieved the TAFC reserve\r\nbattalion in the rear area.\r\n\r\nTwo platoons from the Marine regiment’s 4.2-inch Mortar Company,\r\nmeanwhile, also began their phased relief of the Turkish Heavy Mortar\r\nCompany. The incoming mortar crews had some unexpected early target\r\npractice. As the men took up their active MLR firing positions in the\r\nright battalion sector, they were promptly forced to put their tubes\r\ninto action to silence a troublesome machine gun, enemy mortars, and\r\nhostile troops behind the Jersey Ridge to the north and Reno and Elko\r\non the west. That evening the 2d Battalion opened its new command post\r\nin the eastern sector, occupied by two TAFC battalions.\r\n\r\nSharply at 0455 on 7 July, the 7th Marines assumed responsibility for\r\nthe right regimental sector and came under operational control of\r\nthe 25th Division. Shortly after noon that day, forward units of 1/7\r\nreached the 25th Division sector after a three hour motor march from\r\nCamp Indianhead, through driving rains in their second day without\r\nletup. At the battalion sector, 1/7 joined the advance echelon of 40\r\nmen who had arrived the previous day and took over its MLR positions\r\nfrom the 14th Infantry. Additional 7th Marines units reporting in\r\nthroughout the day and assuming new locations were the weapons, mortar,\r\nand antitank companies.\r\n\r\nThe first of Colonel Tschirgi’s 5th Marines returned to their center\r\nregimental sector before dawn that same day to begin their relief of\r\nthe Army 35th Infantry Regiment. At 0300 the 3d Battalion assumed\r\nresponsibility for the eastern half of the MLR. By late afternoon,\r\nantitank personnel and the 2d Battalion were in line, the latter taking\r\nover the western battalion sector at 1716. In the rear regimental area,\r\nearly elements of Colonel Nelson’s 1st Marines, locating just south of\r\nthe Imjin River, had begun to arrive by 1300. The regiment would assume\r\nground security for the Spoonbill and Libby (formerly X-Ray) bridges in\r\nthe sector as well as MASRT #1.\r\n\r\nNo one needed to remind the 1st Marine Division that the territory it\r\nwas moving back into was not the same--with respect to defense posts\r\nin the right regimental sector--that it had left two months earlier.\r\nThree of its six outposts there (Carson, Elko, Vegas) had fallen to\r\nthe enemy in the late-May battle, despite the formidable resistance\r\nof the defending Turks. Outpost Ava remained at the far western end of\r\nthe line, with the Berlin-East Berlin complex in the right battalion\r\narea. Some 6,750 yards of intervening MLR--more than four miles--lay\r\nin between, bereft of any protective outposts to screen and alert the\r\ndefending line companies to sudden enemy assaults. The Marines were\r\nthus returning to a main line of resistance considerably weakened in\r\nits right regimental sector.\r\n\r\nAs the 1st Division CG, General Pate, observed:\r\n\r\n  Vegas [had] dominated the enemy approaches to Berlin from the\r\n  north and northwest and therefore made Berlin relatively secure.\r\n  Berlin, in turn, dominated the enemy approaches from the north\r\n  and northwest to East Berlin and made East Berlin relatively\r\n  secure. The loss of Outpost Vegas to the CCF placed Berlin and\r\n  East Berlin in very precarious positions and negated their being\r\n  supported by ground fire except from the MLR.[483]\r\n\r\n    [483] _CG, 1stMarDiv, Berlin Rpt_., p. 1.\r\n\r\nGround support fire from the MLR, moreover, tended to be only\r\nmoderately successful in supporting the outposts because of the nature\r\nof the terrain. A major Communist stronghold, Hill 190, lay northeast\r\nof the Carson-Elko-Vegas complex. Since Berlin (COP 19) and East Berlin\r\n(COP 19-A) were sited on extensions of this same hill mass, the enemy\r\ncould make sudden “ridgeline” attacks against the Berlins. With buffer\r\noutpost Vegas now lost, the likelihood of CCF success in such attacks\r\nwas “immeasurably increased.”[484]\r\n\r\n    [484] _Ibid._, p. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Initial Attacks on Outposts Berlin and East Berlin_[485]\r\n\r\n    [485] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chaps. 9, 10;\r\n          _CG, 1stMarDiv, Berlin Rpt_; 1stMarDiv ComdD, July 53;\r\n          1stMarDiv G-3 Jnls, 1–10 Jul 53; 1stMarDiv PIR 992, dtd\r\n          8–9 Jul 53; 5thMar, 7thMar, 11thMar, 1st TkBn, 1/7,\r\n          2/7, 3/7, 2/11, 4/11 ComdDs, Jul 53; 1st MAW, VMF-311,\r\n          VMO-6, HMR-161 ComdDs, Jul 53; Hicks, _Outpost Warfare_;\r\n          MacDonald, _POW_.\r\n\r\nIt did not take the Chinese long to exploit this situation. At about\r\n2100 on 7 July, while the relief of lines was in progress, the two\r\nBerlin outposts and newly-located MLR companies of Lieutenant Colonel\r\nCereghino’s 2d Battalion (from the left: D, F, and E), were greeted\r\nby a heavy volume of Chinese mortar and artillery fire. The barrage\r\ncontinued unremittingly, followed by waves of a reinforced Chinese\r\nbattalion that swept over the two platoon-sized outposts, from the\r\ndirection of Vegas. By 2345 defending Marines at both outposts were\r\nengaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, identified as elements\r\nof the 407th Regiment, 136th Division, 46th CCF Army.\r\n\r\nBerlin, manned at the time by TAFC[486] and Marine personnel, was\r\nunexpectedly strengthened by a Company F reinforced squad that had been\r\ndispatched on an earlier ambush patrol in the vicinity of the outpost.\r\nAt East Berlin, however, the overwhelming hordes of Chinese soldiers\r\nadvanced to the trenchline of the steep forward slope and quickly\r\nlocked with the Marines at point-blank range. Despite the coordination\r\nof MLR machine gun, 60mm, 81mm, and 4.2-inch mortar, and artillery\r\nfires from 2/11[487] and 4/11, the enemy overran the outpost at 2355\r\nafter heavy, close fighting. Chinese mortar and artillery barrages, by\r\nmidnight, had continuously disrupted the Marine communications net at\r\nEast Berlin, and by 0130 radio relay was also out at Berlin proper.\r\n\r\n    [486] Discussing this phase of operations, the 2/7 commander\r\n          stated: “As it turned out we were in great shape with\r\n          both Marines and Turks fighting side by side in some\r\n          instances. We had a great rapport with the Turks in that\r\n          they had previously relieved 2/7. In fact, they made\r\n          us honorary members of their battalions, giving each\r\n          2/7 Marine one of the unit patches.” Col Alexander D.\r\n          Cereghino ltr to Dir MCHist, HQMC, dtd 19 Jun 70.\r\n\r\n    [487] On 7 July, 2/11 had become the direct support battalion\r\n          for the 7th Marines.\r\n\r\nA provisional platoon from Headquarters and Service Company of 2/7\r\nwas quickly ordered to reinforce the main line against any attempted\r\nbreakthrough by the Chinese. This was a distinct possibility since the\r\nBerlins were only 325 yards from the MLR, nearer than most outposts.\r\nMen from Companies H and I of the rear reserve 3d Battalion (since 26\r\nMay commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Paul M. Jones) were also placed\r\nunder operational control of 2/7 and ordered to forward assembly areas\r\nin readiness for a thrust against the enemy at East Berlin.\r\n\r\nAt 0355 a Company F squad jumped off for the initial counterattack.\r\nThis was made at 0415, without artillery preparation, in an attempt to\r\ngain surprise for the assault. It was thrown back. A second Company F\r\nunit, by 0440, was on its way to reinforce the first but got caught by\r\n25 rounds of incoming, with 15 men wounded. It continued on, however,\r\nbut an hour later the Marines were ordered to disengage so that the\r\nartillerymen could place TOT fire on the area preparatory to a fresh\r\nattempt to dislodge the enemy soldiers.\r\n\r\nDuring the early morning hours of 8 July, large numbers of Chinese\r\nwere seen at their new Vegas and Reno strongholds. Marines of the\r\n1st 4.5-inch Rocket Battery blanketed hostile troops there and\r\nat the Berlin outposts with four ripples. On another occasion, a\r\ntime-on-target mission launched by the 2/11 direct support battalion,\r\nlanded in the midst of an enemy company assembled on Vegas. Friendly\r\nfirepower by this time consisted of all four battalions of the 11th\r\nMarines, as well as seven Army and Turkish artillery battalions still\r\nemplaced in the area during the relief period and thus under tactical\r\ncontrol of 25th Division Artillery.\r\n\r\nThroughout 7–8 July, 11 Marine tanks from Company B placed 800 shells\r\non enemy installations and troops. In the characteristic pattern,\r\nuse of Marine armor heightened unfriendly response. The tanks drew\r\nin return 2,000 rounds of Chinese mortar and artillery on their own\r\npositions, but without any serious damage. Elements of the Army 14th\r\nInfantry Regiment Tank Company, still in the area, also opened up with\r\nsome additional shells and bullets.\r\n\r\nDespite the Chinese attack, the relief of lines continued during\r\nthe night. In the center MLR sector, the 5th Marines had taken over\r\nregimental responsibility at 2130, with 3/11 becoming its direct\r\nsupporting unit. And in the western half of the 7th Marines line--about\r\nthe only undisturbed part of the regimental sector--1/7 had routinely\r\ncompleted is battalion relief at 0335 on 8 July.\r\n\r\nAt 0630 it was confirmed that East Berlin, an extension of the ridge on\r\nwhich Berlin was located, was under enemy control. Better news at first\r\nlight was that Berlin,[488] 500 yards west, had repulsed the enemy,\r\na fact not definitely known earlier due to communication failure. At\r\nthis time, G-3 reported that 18 effectives were holding Berlin, and 2/7\r\nassigned an 18-man reinforced squad to buttress the defense. It was not\r\nconsidered feasible to send a larger reinforcement “since the Berlin\r\narea [could] accommodate only a small garrison.”[489]\r\n\r\n    [488] The ridge on which COP Berlin was located was split by\r\n          two valleys. Both of these and the ridge itself served\r\n          as approaches to the Marine MLR. _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6,\r\n          Chap. 9, p. 9-169.\r\n\r\n    [489] _CG, 1stMarDiv, Berlin Rpt_, p. 2.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, another 7th Marines counterforce was being organized for\r\na massed assault to retake East Berlin. At 1000, under cover of a\r\nthundering 1,600-round mortar and artillery preparation by Marine and\r\nTAFC gunners, a reinforced two-platoon unit from Companies George\r\nand How, launched the attack. The unlucky H/3/7 platoon, in the lead,\r\ngot caught between well-aimed Chinese shells and the Marines’ own\r\nprotective wire. In less than 15 minutes the platoon had been reduced\r\nto 20 effectives, with Company G passing through its ranks to continue\r\nthe attack. By 1123 the Marines were in a violent fire fight and\r\ngrenade duel in the main trenchline at East Berlin.\r\n\r\nTank guns, meanwhile, blasted away at Chinese troops, bunkers, active\r\nweapons, and trenches. On call they placed their fire “only a few yards\r\nin front of the friendly attacking infantry and moved this fire forward\r\nas the foot troops advanced.”[490] Heavy countermortar and artillery\r\nrounds were also hitting their mark on forward, top, and reverse slopes\r\nof East Berlin to soften the Chinese defenses. A few minutes later\r\nthe 3d Battalion men had formed for the assault. During the heavy\r\nhand-to-hand fighting of the next hour the Marines “literally threw\r\nsome of the Chinese down the reverse slope.”[491] Gaining the crest of\r\nthe hill, the Marines by force and fire dispatched the enemy intruders.\r\nAt 1233 they were again in possession of East Berlin. With just 20 men\r\nleft in fighting condition at the outpost, a reinforcing platoon from\r\nI/3/7 was dispatched to buttress the assault force.\r\n\r\n    [490] 1st TkBn ComdD, Jul 53, p. 2.\r\n\r\n    [491] Hicks, _Outpost Warfare_, p. 136.\r\n\r\nNorth of the 7th Marines sector four F9F Panthers, led by the\r\ncommanding officer of VMF-311, Lieutenant Colonel Bernard McShane,\r\nfound their way through the rainy skies that had restricted aerial\r\nsupport efforts nearly everywhere. In a noon MPQ mission, the quartet\r\ndelivered five tons of ordnance on Chinese reinforcement troops and\r\nbunkers.\r\n\r\nPromptly at 1300--a half hour after retaking the outpost--the 7th\r\nMarines effected the relief of the last Turkish elements at Berlin and\r\noccupied the twin defense positions. And by 1500 on 8 July, the 1st\r\nMarine Division assumed operational control of the entire division\r\nsector from the Army 25th Infantry Division. Relief of individual units\r\nwould continue, however, through several more days. At the same time,\r\nthe mission of the 11th Marines, since 5 July under a new regimental\r\ncommander, Colonel Manly L. Curry, changed from general support of\r\nU.S. I Corps, reinforcing the fires of the 25th Division Artillery,\r\nto direct support of the Marine Division. The 1st Tank Battalion\r\nsimilarly took over its regular direct support role. Other units under\r\ntemporary Army jurisdiction, such as the Kimpo Provisional Regiment and\r\nDivision Reconnaissance Company, reverted to Marine control.\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of the day, gunners of the 11th Marines continued their\r\nfire missions despite reduced visibility that hindered surveillance\r\nby the OY spotting planes and forward observers. Only 42 Chinese were\r\nsighted during the daytime, although shortly before dusk a CCF group\r\nreportedly heading toward the Berlins area southwest from Frisco was\r\ntaken under fire. Estimates of enemy incoming throughout the 7–8 July\r\naction from 17-odd battalions of Chinese artillery dug in across the\r\ndivision sector was placed at 19,000 rounds of all types. Marine and\r\nArmy-controlled battalions, for their part, pounded Chinese strongholds\r\nwith a total of 20,178 rounds.\r\n\r\nThat night Colonel Funk authorized a 3d Battalion platoon to bolster\r\nthe MLR. Five tanks were also ordered to locate in the Hill 126 area,\r\nthe Marine high-ground terrain feature to the rear of the frontlines.\r\nThis foresight was well rewarded. During the late evening hours strange\r\nmotor noises “sounding like a convoy pulling in and then back out\r\nagain”[492] floated over the Korean hills and the tanks immediately\r\nswept suspected hostile installations with their 90mm guns. Later that\r\nnight of 8–9 July, the Chinese suddenly renewed their probing efforts\r\nat the battered Marine outposts. Moving in from Vegas, an estimated\r\nreinforced enemy company attacked Berlin at 0104, then brushed on\r\nto East Berlin. An intense fire fight ensued off and on for nearly\r\ntwo hours at the two posts. Marine 81mm and 4.2-inch mortars, plus\r\nartillery illumination, boxing fires, and tanks blunted the assaults.\r\nAt 0315 the enemy broke contact and action quieted down at both\r\nlocations.\r\n\r\n    [492] 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl, dtd 9 Jul 53.\r\n\r\nThroughout the rest of the day, eight Company C[493] armored vehicles\r\nassisted the infantrymen in consolidation of positions. A total of 25\r\nrounds of shells and 19,140 rounds of .30 and .50 caliber machine gun\r\nbullets were expended on CCF strongpoints and troops during a 24-hour\r\nfiring period that ended at 1700.\r\n\r\n    [493] On 9 July Company C relieved Company B on the MLR in\r\n          support of the 7th Marines. Both tank companies had been\r\n          in action with the TAFC during the entire 60-day period\r\n          the division was in I Corps reserve. Due to the rotation\r\n          system, however, Baker Company had been on line longer\r\n          and transferred to the rear ranks for a “much needed rest\r\n          and rehabilitation.” 1st TkBn ComdD, Jul 53, p. 3.\r\n\r\nBecause of the casualties at Berlin, an H/3/7 reinforcement squad was\r\nsent to augment the Marine force there. Losses suffered by the 7th\r\nMarines for the two successive nights were 9 killed, 12 missing,[494]\r\n126 wounded and evacuated, and 14 with minor wounds. The cost to the\r\nCCF was 30 known dead, and an estimated 200 killed and 400 wounded.\r\n\r\n    [494] Later it was determined that only two were actually\r\n          captured and they were subsequently repatriated.\r\n          MacDonald, _POW_, p. 211.\r\n\r\nWith the Marines back on line, VMO-6 and HMR-161 which were under\r\ndivision operational control again resumed normal combat routine.\r\nReturning on 8 July to their forward airstrip in the center regimental\r\nsector, VMO-6 helicopters made eight frontline helicopter evacuations.\r\nObservation planes that same day conducted four artillery spotting\r\nmissions behind enemy lines. HMR-161, assuming normal operations on 10\r\nJuly, resupplied Marine division outposts with 1,200 pounds of rations,\r\nwater, and gear as part of its 25.3 hours flight time this first day\r\nback in full service.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Enemy and Marine Probes, 11–18 July_[495]\r\n\r\n    [495] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9; 1stMarDiv\r\n          ComdD, Jul 53; 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnls, 10–17 Jul 53;\r\n          1stMarDiv PIRs 923–930, dtd 10–17 Jul 53; 1stMar, 5thMar,\r\n          7thMar, 11thMar, 2/5, 1/7, 3/7, 2/11 ComdDs, Jul 53;\r\n          Hermes, _Truce Tent_.\r\n\r\nAfter the flare-up on the Berlin front, there was relatively little\r\naction for the next 10 days. Marines continued the relief of the last\r\nof the outgoing 25th Division units. When this was completed on 13\r\nJuly, 1st Marine Division units, including the 1st KMC/RCT[496] and\r\n1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion, were all back in their accustomed\r\nsectors. They thus rejoined the 1st Tank Battalion, 11th Marines, Kimpo\r\nRegiment, and Division Reconnaissance Company which had remained on\r\nline throughout the period. The July relief was one that could hardly\r\nbe characterized as routine. Interfering elements had included not only\r\nthe Chinese but torrential summer rains. These had continued virtually\r\nnonstop from 5–8 July causing bridge and road washouts, rerouting of\r\nsupply trucks, and juggling of manifests at a time when the regiments\r\nwere using an average of 90 transport vehicles daily.\r\n\r\n    [496] The 1st KMC/RCT turned over its sector of the 1st ROK\r\n          Division front to the 1st ROK Regiment at 1800 on 8 July\r\n          and relieved the U.S. 27th Infantry Regiment on 12 July.\r\n          _ROKMC Comments._\r\n\r\nForward of the MLR the regular nightly patrols probed enemy territory,\r\noften with no contact. On at least three occasions division\r\nintelligence reported entire 24-hour periods during which the elusive\r\nChinese could not be sighted anywhere in No-Man’s-Land by friendly\r\npatrols operating north of the Marine division front.\r\n\r\nMore rain,[497] continual haze, and ground fog for 6 of the 10 days\r\nbetween 9–18 July not only reduced the activity of air observers and\r\nMarine pilots, but apparently inspired the ground-digging Chinese to\r\npursue--at least across from the division sector of I Corps--a more\r\nmole-like existence than ever. Enemy troop sightings during the daytime\r\ndecreased from as many as 310 CCF to a new low of 14. Incoming, for one\r\n24-hour period, totaled no more than 48 rounds of Chinese artillery and\r\n228 of mortar fire that struck Marine positions, causing only slight\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\n    [497] Spoonbill Bridge was submerged under 11 feet of water and\r\n          destroyed by the pressure against it on 7 July. Flood\r\n          conditions existed again on 14–15 July when the Imjin\r\n          crested at 26 feet at Libby Bridge. Roads in the vicinity\r\n          were impassable for three days. Resupply of forward\r\n          companies was made via Freedom Bridge. One command diary\r\n          writer, discussing the elaborate series of six moves made\r\n          by 1/1 during July, added a touch of unconscious humor\r\n          when he observed, “During the month, it seemed as if the\r\n          Battalion was constantly on the move.... Rain hampered\r\n          these moves considerably. The weather between moves was\r\n          generally clear and dry.” 1/1 ComdD, July 53, p. 1; 1st\r\n          TkBn ComdD, Jul 53, pp. 5, 11–12, 23; _PacFlt EvalRpt_\r\n          No. 6, Chap. 9, pp. 9-68, 9-136.\r\n\r\nThe same could not be said for their mines. One 7th Marines\r\nreconnaissance patrol located a new minefield staked out with Soviet\r\nantipersonnel mines (POMZ-2) of an unfamiliar type with both pull and\r\ntension fuses. It appeared that mines which had lain dormant during the\r\nwinter months had suddenly come to life with the warm weather, or else\r\nbeen recently re-laid. Nearly a dozen were uncovered by 5th and 7th\r\nMarines patrols, soon after their return to the front, and sometimes\r\nthe discovery came too late. Probably the worst day was 12 July when\r\nfour Marines were killed and eight wounded as a result of accidentally\r\ndetonating mines.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in the 5th Marines sector near the vicinity of truce\r\ncorridor COP-2, the persistent voice of the Dragon Lady taunted Marines\r\nwith such lackluster gambits as “Surrender now! What is your girl\r\ndoing back home?” in the stepped-up pace of its midnight propaganda\r\nbroadcasts.\r\n\r\nThe regular nightly patrols checked in and out, performing their\r\nmission routinely. Even during this last month of the war, when word\r\nof the final truce agreement was expected daily, fire fights ensued.\r\nOn 12 July, a 5th Marines 13-man reconnaissance patrol clashed briefly\r\nnorth of COP Esther, while a 7th Marines platoon-size combat patrol\r\nbrushed with a Chinese squad west of Elko in an 18-minute fire fight.\r\nThe same night the 11th Marines reported increased enemy sightings of\r\n318 CCF soldiers--the most seen since the Berlin probe of 7–8 July.\r\nNo follow-up was made. The Chinese were busy with major offensives\r\nelsewhere along the UNC front, devoting their primary efforts to ROK\r\ndivisions on the central and eastern sectors of the Eighth Army line.\r\nApparently they fully intended to demonstrate to the South Koreans that\r\ncontinuation of the war would be a costly business.[498]\r\n\r\n    [498] Hermes, _Truce Tent_, p. 470.\r\n\r\nAlong the Marine front, three patrol contacts took place on the night\r\nof 16–17 July. Two of them were grim reminders that despite the\r\npromising look (and sound) of the peace talks, for those men lost the\r\ntoll of the war was as final and unremitting as it had been at any time\r\nduring the past three years of combat. The first was a routine maneuver\r\nfor a 5th Marines 13-man combat patrol that, at 2252, engaged an enemy\r\nsquad just north of outpost Hedy. After an eight-minute fire fight the\r\nenemy withdrew, with two Chinese soldiers counted dead and one wounded\r\nand no friendly casualties.\r\n\r\nNot so lucky was a 2/5 reconnaissance patrol. At midnight, its 15\r\nmembers encountered a band of 30 to 40 Chinese, deployed in a V-shaped\r\nambush in the Hill 90 area, an enemy stronghold two miles east of\r\nPanmunjom. The Marines set up a base of fire, beating off the enemy\r\nwith their rifles, BARs, mortars, and bare fists. Reinforcements and\r\nartillery fires were called in. The first relief unit was intercepted\r\nby vicious mortar shelling which wounded the entire detail. A second\r\nrelief squad, also taken under mortar fire, continued the action in an\r\nintense fire contest that lasted nearly two hours. In the meantime, the\r\ndirect support artillery battalion, 3/11, reinforced by 1/11, showered\r\n280 rounds of countermortar on Chinese long-range machine guns and\r\nmortars barking from the surrounding hills.\r\n\r\nDuring the engagement the Chinese made several attempts to capture\r\nprisoners. When the enemy finally began to withdraw, CCF casualties\r\nwere 10 known dead, an estimated 9 more dead, and 3 wounded. Seven\r\nMarines were found to be missing after the Chinese broke contact. A 5th\r\nMarines platoon that extensively screened the battalion front during\r\nthe hours of darkness on the 17th returned at 2210 with six bodies.\r\n\r\nThe third encounter took place not long after midnight in the 7th\r\nMarines territory. This brief skirmish was also to have an unpleasant\r\naftermath and, inadvertently, fulfill the psywar broadcast of the\r\nprevious day that had warned Marines “not to go on patrols or be\r\nkilled.” As it was leaving the Ava Gate (250 yards northwest of the\r\noutpost proper) at 0045, a 30-man combat patrol from Company A was\r\nchallenged on three sides by 40–50 CCF employing small arms, automatic\r\nweapons, grenades, and mortars. After a 15-minute fire exchange, during\r\nwhich the patrol lost communications with its MLR company, the enemy\r\nwithdrew. Six CCF had been counted dead, and 12 more estimated killed\r\nor wounded.\r\n\r\nUpon returning to the outpost, a muster of the men engaged in the\r\naction showed four Marines were missing. A rescue squad recovered three\r\nbodies. When, several hours later, daylight hampered movements of the\r\nsearch party, 2/11 laid down a smoke screen to isolate the sector.\r\nBetween 0050 and 0455, its gunners also directed 529 rounds of close\r\nsupport and countermortar fire on Chinese troops and active weapons\r\nin the area. The recovery unit continued to sweep the area for the\r\nlast missing man until 0545 when it was decided that the search would\r\nhave to be terminated with negative results. Marine casualties from\r\nthe encounter were 3 killed, 1 missing, 19 wounded (evacuated), and 2\r\nnonseriously wounded.\r\n\r\nThe following day patrol activity and enemy contacts quieted down.\r\nAction shifted to the 1st KMC/RCT sector. Here, during the late hours\r\nof the 18th, four Korean combat patrols brushed quickly and briefly\r\nwith Chinese squad and platoon units in light skirmishes of but a\r\nfew minutes duration. The Korean Marines killed 2 of the enemy and\r\nestimated they accounted for 16 more.[499]\r\n\r\n    [499] _ROKMC Comments._\r\n\r\nThe only activity in the Marine right regimental sector occurred when\r\na 7th Marines 36-man combat patrol, on prowl the night of 17–18\r\nJuly, advanced at 0112 as far as hand-grenade range of the Chinese\r\ntrenchline at Ungok. Undetected by the enemy, a patrol member fired a\r\nwhite phosphorus rifle grenade squarely at the CCF machine gun that\r\nwas harassing the friendly MLR. The Marines then engaged 15 Chinese\r\ndefending the position in a brief 20-minute skirmish. Although two men\r\nwere wounded,[500] the Company C patrol members in a somewhat roguish\r\ngesture as they left also planted a Marine Corps recruiting sign at\r\ntheir FPOA (Farthest Point of Advance), facing the enemy.\r\n\r\n    [500] One, who died that morning, was squad leader Sergeant\r\n          Stephen C. Walter, posthumously presented the Navy Cross.\r\n          Also awarded the nation’s second highest combat medal\r\n          for extraordinary heroism in a patrol action on 16–17\r\n          July was Private First Class Roy L. Stewart, of the 5th\r\n          Marines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marine Air Operations_[501]\r\n\r\n    [501] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpts_ No. 4, Chap. 10, No.\r\n          5, Chap. 9, No. 6, Chap. 10; 1stMarDiv ComdD, Jul 53;\r\n          1stMarDiv PIR 924, dtd 10–11 Jul 53; 1st MAW, MAGs-12,\r\n          -33, VMAs-121, -212, -251, -323, VMF(N)-153, VMF-311\r\n          ComdDs, Jul 53; Field, _NavOps, Korea_; Futrell, _USAF,\r\n          Korea_.\r\n\r\nIf the monsoon rains of July hung like a shroud over the infantryman,\r\nthey were an even more serious impediment to air operations of MAGs-12\r\nand -33. There were 24 days of restricted flying when the weather at\r\nhome base or target area was recorded as marginal to non-operational.\r\nOn 12 full days air operations were cancelled entirely. Precipitation\r\nfor July rose to 7.38 inches, with 22 days of rain recorded throughout\r\nthe month. The generally unfavorable weather conditions not only\r\nlimited the normal support missions flown by 1st MAW but delayed the\r\narrival of VMA-251[502] en route from Japan to relieve VMA-323.\r\n\r\n    [502] Marine Attack Squadron 251 (Lieutenant Colonel Harold A.\r\n          Harwood) administratively joined MAG-12 on 6 July for\r\n          323, which had rotated back to MCAS, El Toro three days\r\n          earlier. Movement of -251 aircraft to Korea could not\r\n          take place, however, until 12 July. When VMA-323 (Major\r\n          Woten) departed, the famous “Death Rattlers” had the\r\n          distinction of being the Marine tactical (VMA/VMF) air\r\n          squadron in longest service during the Korean War. The\r\n          unit’s final combat mission on 2 July brought its total\r\n          Korean operations to 20,827 sorties and 48,677.2 hours.\r\n          On 6 August 1950, roaring up from the flight deck of the\r\n          USS _Badoeng Strait_, the VMA-323 Corsairs (then VMF-323)\r\n          had launched their opening blow against North Korean\r\n          installations, led by Major Arnold A. Lund, CO. The\r\n          initial Marine air offensive action of the Korean War had\r\n          been flown three days earlier by VMF-214. This unit was\r\n          reassigned to CONUS in November 1951, giving the Death\r\n          Rattlers the longest continuous service flight record.\r\n          Jul 53 ComdD, 1st MAW, p. 2; _USMC Ops Korea-Pusan_, v.\r\n          I, pp. 89–90, 98; VMF-214 Squadron History, HRB.\r\n\r\nDuring July the wing’s nearly 300 aircraft (250 operational, 43\r\nassigned to pool status in Korea) flew 2,688 combat sorties[503]\r\nand 5,183.1 combat hours. The bulk of the sorties, 1,497, were CAS\r\noperations flown for 19 different UNC divisions. Nearly 900 supported\r\nthe 12 ROK divisions involved in the heavy fighting on the central UNC\r\nsector. Approximately 250 of the CAS sorties were for the 1st Marine\r\nDivision, with more than 200 being day or night MPQ drops and the rest,\r\ndaytime CAS runs. No night close support missions were conducted.\r\n\r\n    [503] Individual reports by the two groups result in a\r\n          slightly higher figure. MAG-12 recorded 2,001 combat\r\n          sorties (including more than 400 flown by carrier-based\r\n          VMA-332, not in the 1st MAW sortie rate). MAG-33 listed\r\n          945 sorties, or a combined group total of 2,946 for the\r\n          month. ComdDs Jul 53 MAG-12, p. C-1 and MAG-33, p. I.\r\n\r\nWhen nearly a week of inclement weather finally lifted, Colonel Arthur\r\nR. Stacy’s[504] MAG-33 pilots based at Pohang welcomed a brisk change\r\nin the tempo of operations. In seven MPQ strikes on 11 July, they\r\nhurled 13 tons of ordnance on Chinese fortifications north of the 7th\r\nMarines sector. It was the wing’s first active day in support missions\r\nfor the 1st Marine Division, newly back on the line.\r\n\r\n    [504] Colonel Stacy was group commander until 24 July, when he\r\n          was detached for assignment to 1st MAW as Assistant Chief\r\n          of Staff, G-2. He was succeeded at MAG-33 by Colonel John\r\n          L. Smith.\r\n\r\nDuring the interim period of 9–18 July, between the two Berlin outpost\r\nattacks, F9F jet fighters from MAG-13 again carried out approximately\r\n35 MPQ missions for the division. (MAG-12 attack planes, during this\r\ntime, were assigned to the flaming central Allied line.) Nearly 20 of\r\nthese were on a single day, 14 July, when VMFs-311 and -115 Panther\r\njets roared over enemy country from morning to sundown unleashing 25\r\ntons north of the Marine troubled right regimental sector and 9 more\r\ntons on hostile emplacements near the western end of the division line.\r\n\r\nIn middle and late July, however, the majority of missions by Marine\r\nfliers bolstered UNC operations in the central part of the Allied front\r\nwhere a major enemy counterthrust erupted. The peak operational day for\r\nMAG-33 pilots during this period occurred 17 July when 40 interdiction\r\nand MPQ missions (136 combat sorties) were executed for Army and ROK\r\ndivisions. The corresponding record day for Colonel Carney’s MAG-12\r\naviators was 19 July when 162 combat sorties were flown on heavy\r\ndestruction missions to support UNC action.\r\n\r\nMarine exchange pilot Major John F. Bolt, of VMF-115, chalked up a\r\nrecord of a different kind on 11 July. Attached to the Fifth Air Force\r\n51st Fighter-Interceptor Group, he shot down his fifth and sixth MIG-15\r\n(the previous four having been bagged since 16 May) to become the first\r\nMarine jet ace in history. Major Bolt was leading a four-plane F-86\r\nflight in the attack on four MIGs east of Sinuiju and required only\r\n1,200 rounds of ammunition and five minutes to destroy the two enemy\r\njet fighters. Bolt thereby became the 37th jet ace of the Korean War.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the month, Navy Lieutenant Guy P. Bordelon won a Silver Star\r\nmedal and gold star in lieu of a second Silver Star. Attending the K-6\r\nceremonies were General Megee and Admiral Clark, 1st Wing and Seventh\r\nFleet commanders. Bordelon, flying with the Marine Corsair night\r\nfighters, had downed four of the harassing “Bedcheck Charlie” planes. A\r\nmember of VC-3 attached to MAG-12, Lieutenant Bordelon on 17 July made\r\nhis fifth night kill and was subsequently awarded the Navy Cross.\r\n\r\nOn the minus side, the 1st Marine Air Wing this last month of the war\r\nsuffered a higher rate of personnel losses on combat flights than in\r\nany month since June 1952.[505] Captain Lote Thistlethwaite and Staff\r\nSergeant W. H. Westbrook, of VMF(N)-513, were killed in an air patrol\r\nflight on 4 July. (Two nights earlier, the same squadron had lost a\r\nNavy pilot and crewman on temporary duty with the night-fighters when\r\ntheir F3D-2 similarly failed to return to Pyongtaek.) Another MAG-12\r\ncasualty was Captain Carl F. Barlow, of VMA-212, killed 13 July on a\r\nprebriefed CAS mission when he crashed while flying instruments.\r\n\r\n    [505] Wing casualties for July 1953 were listed as three\r\n          killed, seven missing, and two wounded in action. Names\r\n          of enlisted crew members on flights are not always given\r\n          in air diaries, which accounts for the discrepancies.\r\n\r\nOn 17 July, Captain Robert I. Nordell, VMF-311, flying his third\r\nmission that day, and wingman First Lieutenant Frank L. Keck, Jr.\r\nwere hit by intense automatic weapons fire while on an interdiction\r\nflight. Their planes reportedly went down, at 2000, over the Sea of\r\nJapan. After a four-day air and surface search conducted by JOC, they\r\nwere declared missing and subsequently reclassified killed in action.\r\nAnother MAG-33 pilot listed KIA was Major Thomas M. Sellers, VMF-115,\r\non exchange duty with the Air Force, shot down 20 July in a dogfight\r\nafter he had scored two MIG-15s. Two days earlier a VMO-6 pilot, First\r\nLieutenant Charles Marino, and his artillery spotter, First Lieutenant\r\nWilliam A. Frease, flying a flak suppression mission, were struck\r\nby enemy fire and crashed with their ship in the 5th Marines center\r\nregimental sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fall of the Berlins_[506]\r\n\r\n    [506] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9;\r\n          _CG, 1stMarDiv, Berlin Rpt_; 1stMarDiv ComdD, Jul 53;\r\n          1stMarDiv G-3 Jnls, 19–21 Jul 53; 1stMarDiv PIRs 933–934,\r\n          dtd 19–21 Jul 53; 1stMar ComdD, Jul 53; 5thMar, 7thMar,\r\n          11thMar, 3/1, 3/5, 1/7, 2/7, 3/7, 1/11, 2/11, 3/11, 4/11,\r\n          1stTkBn ComdDs, Jul 53; 1stMar Preliminary Special Action\r\n          Report, period 8–27 Jul 53 in ComdD, Jul 53, hereafter\r\n          1stMar SAR “Berlins”; MAGs-12, -33, VMAs-121, -212\r\n          ComdDs, Jul 53.\r\n\r\nDespite their preoccupation with other corps sectors on the central\r\nfront of the Eighth Army line, the Chinese had not forgotten about the\r\nBerlin complex held by the Marines. On the night of 19–20 July,[507]\r\nthe enemy lunged against the two Marine outposts in reinforced\r\nbattalion strength to renew his attack launched 12 days earlier.\r\nBeginning at 2200, heavy Chinese mortar and artillery fire struck the\r\ntwo COPs and supporting MLR positions of the 3d Battalion, which had\r\nadvanced to the front on 13 July in relief of 2/7.[508] In the center\r\nregimental sector, 5th Marines outposts Ingrid and Dagmar, and the line\r\ncompanies were also engaged by small arms, mortar, and artillery fires.\r\nAn attempted probe at Dagmar was repulsed, aided by 3/11.\r\n\r\n    [507] The 19th of July, ironically, was the date that truce\r\n          negotiators working at Panmunjom had reached final\r\n          agreement on all remaining disputed points. Staff\r\n          officers were scheduled to begin drawing up details\r\n          of the armistice agreement and boundaries of the\r\n          demilitarized zone. USMA, _Korea_, p. 51.\r\n\r\n    [508] Company E and a detachment of the 81mm mortar platoon\r\n          from the 2d Battalion remained on line. They were\r\n          attached to the 3d Battalion when the sector command\r\n          changed.\r\n\r\nConcentrating their main assault efforts on the Berlins, however, the\r\nChinese forces swarmed up the slopes of the outposts at 2230, with more\r\ntroops moving in from enemy positions on Jersey, Detroit, and Hill\r\n139, some 700 yards north of Berlin. The Chinese struck first at East\r\nBerlin, where 37 Marines were on duty, and then at Berlin, held by 44\r\nmen. Both positions were manned by First Lieutenant Kenneth E. Turner’s\r\nCompany I personnel and employed the maximum-size defenses which could\r\nbe effectively utilized on these terrain features.\r\n\r\nBy 2300 hostile forces were halfway up Berlin. Continuous volumes\r\nof small arms and machine gun fire poured from the defending MLR\r\ncompanies. Defensive boxes were fired by 60mm, 81mm, and 4.2-inch\r\nmortars. Eight Company C tanks augmented the close-in fires, with their\r\nlethal direct-fire 90mm guns tearing into Chinese troops and weapons.\r\nWithin two hours after the initial thrust, the 11th Marines had fired\r\n20 counterbattery and 31 countermortar missions. Artillerymen from 2/11\r\nand 1/11 had expended 1,750 rounds. In addition, 4/11 had unleashed\r\n124 of its 155mm medium projectiles. More countermortar fire came from\r\nthe TAFC Field Artillery Battalion. Despite the heavy fire support,\r\nby midnight the situation was in doubt and at 0146 the twin outposts\r\nwere officially declared under enemy control. Nearly 3,000 rounds of\r\nincoming were estimated to have fallen on division positions by that\r\ntime, most of it in the 7th Marines sector.\r\n\r\nDuring the early morning hours of the 20th, Marine tank guns and\r\ncontinuous shelling by six[509] artillery battalions wreaked havoc\r\non Chinese hardware, reinforcing personnel, supply points, and\r\nfortifications. Reserve units from 2/7 were placed on 30-minute\r\nstandby, with Companies D, E, and F already under 3/7 operational\r\ncontrol. Battalion Operation Order 20-53, issued at 0400 by Lieutenant\r\nColonel Jones, called for Easy and Dog to launch a two-company\r\ncounterattack at 0730 to restore Berlin and East Berlin respectively.\r\nIncoming, meanwhile, continued heavy on the MLR; at 0520, Company I,\r\nlocated to the rear of the contested outposts, reported receiving one\r\nround per second.\r\n\r\n    [509] Three Marine, one TAFC, and two Army battalions.\r\n\r\nThe Marine assault was cancelled by I Corps a half hour before it was\r\nscheduled to take place. A decision subsequently rendered from I Corps\r\ndirected that the positions not be retaken.[510]\r\n\r\n    [510] At a routine conference that same morning attended by\r\n          CG Eighth Army (General Taylor), CG I Corps (General\r\n          Clarke) and CG 1st Marine Division, the earlier decision\r\n          about not regaining the outposts was affirmed. General\r\n          Taylor maintained the positions “could never be held\r\n          should the Chinese decide to exert sufficient pressure\r\n          against them” and recommended instead that the sector\r\n          be organized on a wide front defense concept. Actually,\r\n          following the initial Berlins attack of 7–8 July, a\r\n          discussion about possible readjustment of the Marine\r\n          sector defense had been initiated by General Pate. A\r\n          staff study recommending that just such a “strongpoint”\r\n          concept (rather than the customary linear defense) be\r\n          adopted had been completed by Marine Division officials\r\n          on 15 July. I Corps staff members had concurred with the\r\n          study and it was awaiting consideration by CG, I Corps\r\n          when the Berlins were attacked for the second time on 19\r\n          July. _CG, 1stMarDiv, Berlin Rpt_, pp. 3–4.\r\n\r\nSince the outposts were not to be recaptured,[511] efforts that day\r\nwere devoted to making the two hills as untenable as possible for\r\ntheir new occupants. Heavy destruction missions by air, armor, and\r\nartillery blasted CCF defenses throughout the day. Air observers were\r\non station from 0830 until after dark, with nine CAS missions conducted\r\nby MAG-12 pilots from VMA-121 and -212. The day’s series of air strikes\r\non the Berlin-East Berlin positions (and Vegas weapons emplacements)\r\nbegan at 1145 when a division of ADs from Lieutenant Colonel Harold\r\nB. Penne’s[512] -121 hurled nine and a half tons of ordnance on enemy\r\nbunkers and trenches at East Berlin.\r\n\r\n    [511] Commenting on this point, the I Corps commander noted:\r\n          “The outposts in front of the MLR had gradually lost\r\n          their value in my opinion because, between the MLR and\r\n          the outposts, minefields, tactical wire, etc. had made\r\n          their reinforcement and counterattacks very costly.”\r\n          Resupply was thus restricted to narrow paths on which\r\n          the CCF had zeroed in and “holding poor real estate\r\n          for sentimental reasons is a poor excuse for undue\r\n          casualties.” Gen Bruce C. Clarke, USA, ltr to Dir,\r\n          MCHist, HQMC, dtd 20 May 70.\r\n\r\n    [512] The new squadron commander had taken over 16 July from\r\n          Major Braun.\r\n\r\nThe artillery was having an active day, too. Six firing battalions had\r\nsent more than 3,600 rounds crashing against the enemy by nightfall.\r\nThe 1st 4.5-inch rocketeers also contributed four ripples to the melee.\r\nHeavy fire missions were requested and delivered by the Army 159th\r\nField Artillery Battalion (240mm howitzers) and 17th Field Artillery\r\nBattalion (8-inch howitzers) using 11th Marines airborne spotters. The\r\nprecision fire on enemy positions, which the air spotters reported\r\nto be “the most effective missions they had conducted in Korea”[513]\r\ncontinued for several hours. By 1945 the big guns had demolished the\r\nbunkers and all but 15 yards of trenchline at East Berlin. For their\r\npart the Chinese had fired an estimated 4,900 rounds of mortar and\r\nartillery against the 3d Battalion right hand sector in the 24-hour\r\nperiod ending at 1800 on the 20th.\r\n\r\n    [513] BGen Manly L. Curry ltr to Dir, MCHist, HQMC, dtd 28 May\r\n          70, hereafter _Curry ltr_.\r\n\r\nArmored vehicles, meanwhile, during 19–20 July had expended 200\r\nrounds of HE and WP shells and 6,170 machine gun rounds.[514] Tank\r\nsearchlights had also effectively illuminated enemy positions on the\r\nEast Berlin hill. The tankers’ performance record included: 20 Chinese\r\nbunkers and 2 57mm recoilless rifles destroyed; an estimated 30 enemy\r\nsoldiers killed; a dozen more firing apertures, caves, and trenchworks\r\nsubstantially damaged.\r\n\r\n    [514] Tank and artillery ammunition allocations had been cut\r\n          50 percent the afternoon of the 19th, with a subsequent\r\n          reduction of normal destruction missions and elimination\r\n          of H&I fires.

White\r\n\r\n7TH MARINES MLR SECTOR\r\n\r\n(Division Right)\r\n\r\nLINEAR DEFENSE\r\n\r\n19–20 July 1953]\r\n\r\nBetween noon and the last flight of the day, when a trio of AUs from\r\nLieutenant Colonel Wallace’s VMA-212 attacked a northern enemy mortar\r\nand automatic weapons site, 35 aircraft had repeatedly streaked over\r\nthe Berlin territory and adjacent Chinese strongpoints. Strikes by\r\nVMA-121 at 1145, 1320, 1525, 1625, 1700, 1750; and VMA-212 at 1413,\r\n1849, and 1930 had released a combined total of 69½ tons of bombs and\r\n6,500 rounds of 20mm ammunition on hostile locations.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese casualty toll during this renewed flareup in the fighting\r\non 19–20 July was conservatively placed by 3/7 at 75 killed and 300\r\nwounded. It was further believed that “the enemy battalion was so\r\nweakened and disorganized by the attacks that it was necessary for\r\nthe CCF to commit another battalion to hold the area captured.”[515]\r\nRegimental reports indicated that 6 Marines had been killed, 56 listed\r\nmissing,[516] 86 wounded and evacuated, and 32 not seriously wounded.\r\n\r\n    [515] 3/7 ComdD, 20 Jul 53, p. 5. With respect to the number\r\n          of enemy casualties that night, battalion, regimental,\r\n          artillery support, and division command diaries given\r\n          differing accounts. Other figures cited are: 9 CCF\r\n          killed, between 234–284 estimated killed, and 630\r\n          estimated wounded.\r\n\r\n    [516] Subsequently, it was learned that of 56 Marines\r\n          unaccounted for at the time, 12 were actually captured.\r\n          They were returned after hostilities ended. Several men\r\n          from 1st Marines units under operational control of the\r\n          7th were also taken in this battle. MacDonald, _POW_, pp.\r\n          212, 268–269.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the critical tactical situation and number of casualties\r\nsuffered during the Berlins operation, the 7th Marines regimental\r\ncommander requested that units of the division reserve be placed under\r\nhis control to help check any further aggressive moves of the enemy.\r\nFor it now appeared that the Chinese might continue their thrust and\r\nattempt to seize Hill 119 (directly south of Berlin and East Berlin) in\r\norder to be in position to deny part of the Imjin River to UNC forces\r\nafter signing of the armistice.\r\n\r\nWhile the lost outposts were being neutralized on the morning of\r\nthe 20th, the CO of the incoming 1st Marines, Colonel Nelson, also\r\nordered an immediate reorganization and strengthening of the MLR. This\r\nemployed the defense in depth concept, used by the British Commonwealth\r\nDivision in the sector adjacent to the Marines on the east. The wide\r\nfront defense concept was fully developed with one company occupying\r\na portion of the MLR to the rear of the Berlin complex, known as Hill\r\n119 or more informally, Boulder City. Three companies organized the\r\nhigh ground to the right rear of the MLR east to Hill 111, the limiting\r\npoint on the boundary between the Marine and Commonwealth divisions.\r\nThree more companies fortified the Hill 126 area to the rear and left\r\nof Berlin to its juncture with the western battalion sector held by\r\nLieutenant Colonel Harry A. Hadd’s 1/7. (See Maps 30 and 31.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 31      K. WHITE\r\n\r\n7TH MARINES MLR SECTOR\r\n\r\nDefense-in-depth\r\n\r\n20–21 July 1953]\r\n\r\nThe afternoon of the 20th, 2/1 (Lieutenant Colonel Frank A. Long) was\r\ntransferred to 7th Marines control and positioned in the center of\r\nthe regimental MLR, as the first step in the scheduled relief of the\r\n7th, due off the line on 26 July. For the next three days the regiment\r\ncontinued to develop the sector defense to the rear of the MLR.\r\nElements of the regimental reserve, 2/7, were employed to reinforce the\r\n3/7 sector. Initially, on 20–21 July, F/2/7, under operational command\r\nof 3/7, was assigned the mission of reinforcing Hill 119. Later a 2/1\r\nplatoon was also ordered to strengthen the position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 32      K. WHITE\r\n\r\n7TH MARINES MLR SECTOR\r\n\r\nDefense-in-depth\r\n\r\n22–23 July 1953]\r\n\r\nIncoming 1st Marines platoons and companies from the 2d and 3d\r\n(Lieutenant Colonel Roy D. Miller) Battalions augmented the forces at\r\nthe two critical Hill 119 and 111 locations. As it turned out, 1st\r\nMarines personnel returning to the front from division reserve were to\r\nsee the last of the war’s heavy fighting in the course of their relief\r\nof the 7th Marines. Ultimately, the regimental forward defense, instead\r\nof being divided into two battalion sectors as before, now consisted\r\nof three--a left, center, and right sector. By 23 July the depth\r\nreorganization had been completed and these sectors were manned by 1/7,\r\n2/1, and 3/7. (See Map 32.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Renewal of Heavy Fighting, 24–26 July_[517]\r\n\r\n    [517] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9; 1stMarDiv\r\n          ComdD, Jul 53; 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnls, dtd 21–28 Jul 53;\r\n          1stMarDiv PIRs 935–941, dtd 21–27 Jul 53 and 942, dtd 7\r\n          Aug 53; 1stMar, 5thMar, 7thMar, 11th Mar, 3/1, 3/5, 2/7,\r\n          3/7, 1/11, 2/11, 3/11, 4/11, 1st TkBn ComdDs, Jul 53;\r\n          1stMar SAR “Berlins”; MAGs-12, -33, VMAs-121, -212, -251,\r\n          VMFs-115, -311 ComdDs, Jul 53; Hicks, _Outpost Warfare_;\r\n          Hermes, _Truce Tent_; Miller, Carroll, and Tackley,\r\n          _Korea, 1951–1953_; Martin Russ, _The Last Parallel: A\r\n          Marine’s War Journal_ (New York: Rinehart and Company,\r\n          1957); USMA, _Korea_.\r\n\r\nSightings of enemy troops for the next few days were light. A large\r\nscale attack expected on the 21st by the 5th Marines at Hedy and Dagmar\r\nfailed to materialize. Instead, a token force of a dozen Chinese\r\ndressed in burlap bags made a limited appearance at Hedy before\r\ndeparting, minus three of its party, due to Marine sharp-shooting\r\nskills. In the skies, MAG-33 fliers from VMF-115 and -311 had been\r\ntransferred by Fifth Air Force from exclusive missions for the central\r\nand eastern UNC front (the IX, ROK II, and X Corps sectors) to join\r\nVMA-121 in MPQ flights supporting the 1st Marine Division. During the\r\n21–23 July period, despite layers of thick stratus clouds and rain that\r\nturned off and on periodically like a water spigot, more than 15 radar\r\nmissions were executed by the three squadrons.[518] They unleashed a\r\ngross 33-ton bomb load on CCF mortar and 76mm gun positions, supply\r\nareas, CPs, bunkers, and trenches.\r\n\r\n    [518] One additional flight expending three 1,000-lb. bombs\r\n          was made 22 July by a single AD from replacement\r\n          squadron VMA-251. This was the unit’s first combat\r\n          sortie in support of the 1st Marine Division after its\r\n          indoctrination flights. VMA-251 also flew four MPQ\r\n          flights for the 7th Marines in the early hours of 24\r\n          July, the day the outposts were attacked again. VMA-251\r\n          ComdD, Jul 53.\r\n\r\nThe lull in ground fighting lasted until late on the 24th. Then, at\r\n1930, a heavy preparation of 60mm, 82mm, and 120mm mortars combined\r\nwith 76mm and 122mm artillery shells began to rain down on Boulder\r\nCity. Men of G/3/1, under command of First Lieutenant Oral R. Swigart,\r\nJr., were deployed at that time in a perimeter defense of the position\r\nhaving that morning completed the relief of G/3/7.\r\n\r\nEnemy troops were reported massing for an assault. One regiment located\r\nby forward observers behind Hill 139, some 700 yards northwest of\r\nBerlin, was taken under fire at 1940 by artillery and rocket ripple. At\r\n2030, following their usual pattern of laying down a heavy mortar and\r\nartillery barrage, the CCF began to probe the MLR at Hills 119 and 111\r\nin the Marine right battalion sector. They hit first at Hill 111, the\r\nfar right anchor of the division line, currently held by 7th Marines\r\npersonnel. Then the CCF moved westward to Hill 119. Their choice of\r\ntime for the attack once again coincided with the relief of 7th Marines\r\nunits by the 1st Marines.[519] When the assault began, H/3/1 was moving\r\nup to relieve H/3/7 at the easternmost point of the line in the Hill\r\n111 vicinity, and Company I was preparing to relieve I/3/7, to its left.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [519] A similar incident had occurred on 7 July when the 7th\r\n          Marines was attacked while in the process of relieving a\r\n          regiment of the 25th Infantry. _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, p.\r\n          9-58.\r\n\r\nThe Communist troops temporarily penetrated Hill 111 positions. At\r\nBoulder City, where the main force of the CCF two-battalion unit\r\nhad struck, they occupied a portion of the trenchline. Attempting to\r\nexploit this gain, the Chinese repeatedly assaulted the Berlin Gate,\r\non the left flank of Company G’s position and the East Berlin Gate, to\r\nits right. Marine units of the two regiments posted at the two citadel\r\nhills were heavily supported by MLR mortar, artillery, and tank fires.\r\nNo artillery spotter or CAS flights were flown through the night, once\r\nagain due to weather conditions.\r\n\r\nBy 2120, the bulk of Chinese soldiers had begun to withdraw from Hill\r\n111, this attack apparently being a diversionary effort. But the\r\nenemy’s main thrust continued against the central Hill 119 position.\r\nHere the close, heavy fighting raged on through the morning hours,\r\nwith enemy troops steadily reinforcing from the Jersey Ridge and\r\nEast Berlin, by way of the Berlin Gate, the best avenue of approach\r\nto forward positions of Hill 119. At approximately 2100, the Chinese\r\nhurled a second attack against Hill 119 in the strength of two\r\ncompanies, supported by intense mortar and artillery fire. An hour\r\nlater hand-to-hand combat had developed all along the 700 yards of the\r\nforward trenches. Company G men of the 1st Marines were down to half\r\ntheir original number, ammunition was running low, and evacuation of\r\ncasualties was slowed by the fact that two of the eight corpsmen had\r\nbeen killed and most of the rest were themselves casualties.\r\n\r\nBy midnight, the front, left, and right flanks of the perimeter had\r\nbeen pushed back to the reverse slope of the hill and a 1st Marines\r\nparticipant commented “... only a never-say-die resistance was keeping\r\nthe enemy from seizing the remainder of the position.”[520] At 0015,\r\nthe thinning ranks of G/3/1 Marines (now down to 25 percent effectives)\r\nwere cheered by the news that Company I men were about to reinforce\r\ntheir position. This latter unit itself suffered 35 casualties while\r\nmoving into the rear area, when the Chinese intercepted a coded message\r\nand shifted a substantial amount of their mortar and artillery fires to\r\nthe rear approaches of Hill 119.\r\n\r\n    [520] 1stMar SAR “Berlins,” Aug 53, p. 4.\r\n\r\nIn response to the enemy bombardment, Marine artillery fires crashed\r\nagainst the Chinese continuously from 2100 to midnight. Four ripples\r\nwere launched in support of the Hill 119 defenders. In one of the\r\nregiment’s most intense counterbattery shoots on record, the 11th\r\nMarines in three hours had fired 157 missions. By 2400, an estimated\r\n6,000 to 8,000 hostile rounds had fallen in the division sector.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Chinese were also attempting to punch holes in the 5th\r\nregimental sector. In a second-step operation, rather than striking\r\nsimultaneously as was customary, the enemy at 2115 had jabbed at\r\noutposts Esther and Dagmar in the right battalion of the 5th Marines.\r\nThe reinforced Chinese company from the 408th Regiment quickly began to\r\nconcentrate its attention on Esther, outposted by Company H Marines.\r\nDuring the heavy fighting both Marines and Chinese reinforced. By\r\nearly morning, the enemy had seized part of the front trenchline, but\r\nthe Marines controlled the rear trenches and reorganized the defense\r\nunder rifle platoon commander, Second Lieutenant William H. Bates.\r\nThe Chinese unsuccessfully attempted to isolate the position by heavy\r\nshelling and patrolled vigorously between Esther and the MLR.\r\n\r\nMarines replied with flamethrowers and heavy supporting fires from the\r\nMLR, including machine guns, 81mm and 4.2-inch mortar boxes. Three\r\ntanks--a section from the regimental antitank platoon and one from\r\nCompany A--neutralized enemy targets with 153 rounds to assist the 3d\r\nand 2d Battalions. The 3/11 gunners supporting the 5th Marines also\r\nhurled 3,886 rounds against the Chinese in breaking up the attack.\r\nAfter several hours of strong resistance, the Chinese loosened their\r\ngrip, and at 0640 on the 25th, Esther was reported secured.\r\n\r\nBy this time an enemy battalion had been committed piecemeal at the\r\nposition. The action had developed into the heaviest encounter of the\r\nmonth in the 5th Marines sector. During that night of 24–25 July, more\r\nthan 4,000 artillery and mortar rounds fell in the outpost vicinity;\r\ntotal incoming for the regimental sector throughout July was recorded\r\nat 8,413 rounds. Twelve Marines lost their lives in the battle, with 35\r\nwounded and evacuated, and 63 suffering minor injuries. A total of 85\r\nCCF were counted dead, 110 more estimated killed, and an estimated 250\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nBack at the Berlin Complex area of the 7th Marines where the major\r\naction centered, intense shelling, fire fights, and close hand-to-hand\r\ncombat continued through the early morning of the 25th. Chinese\r\ninfiltrators had broken through a substantial part of the trenchwork\r\non the forward slope of Boulder City. For a while they temporarily\r\noccupied the rocky, shrub-grown hill crest as well.\r\n\r\nA swift-moving counterattack launched at 0130 by 1st Marines from\r\nCompanies G and I, led by Captain Louis J. Sartor, of I/3/1, began to\r\nrestore the proper balance to the situation. At 0330 the MLR had been\r\nreestablished and the Marines had the controlling hand. By 0530 the\r\nHill 119 area was secured, with four new platoons from Companies E of\r\nthe 7th and 1st Marines aiding the defense. Scattered groups of Chinese\r\nstill clung to the forward slopes, and others vainly tried to reinforce\r\nby the Berlin-to-Hill 119 left flank trenchline.\r\n\r\nDirect fire from the four M-46s on position at Boulder City[521] had\r\nhelped disperse hostile troop concentrations. The tanks had also played\r\na major communication role. Although surrounded by enemy forces during\r\nthe peak of the fighting, two of the armored vehicles were still able\r\nto radio timely tactical information to higher echelons. This Company\r\nC quartet, plus another vehicle from the 7th Marines antitank unit,\r\nbetween the time of the enemy assault to 0600 when it stabilized, had\r\npumped 109 HE, 8 marking shells, and 20,750 .30 caliber machine gun\r\nbullets into opposition forces.[522] Five tanks from the 1st Marines\r\nAT company located to the west of the Berlin site meted out further\r\npunishment to enemy soldiers, gun pits, and trenches.\r\n\r\n    [521] One participant remarked: “I think the Boulder City\r\n          action ... is the classic example of where the Army system\r\n          worked well. The tanks were generally given credit for\r\n          saving the position, and I seriously doubt our ability to\r\n          have done the job under the previous system which would\r\n          have required the tanks to move to the scene after the\r\n          action had begun.” _Post ltr._\r\n\r\n    [522] In retaliation, between 2200 and 0600, the four tanks at\r\n          Hill 119 drew 2,200 rounds of enemy mortar and artillery.\r\n\r\nSporadic fighting and heavy incoming (at the rate of 60–70 rounds per\r\nminute for 10 minutes duration) also rained down on eastern Hill 111\r\nin the early hours of the 25th. Assault teams with flamethrowers and\r\n3.5-inch rocket launchers completed the job of clearing the enemy out\r\nof Marine bunkers.\r\n\r\nAltogether the Communists had committed 3,000 troops across the Marine\r\ndivision front during the night of 24–25 July. Between 2200 and 0400,\r\na total of 23,725 rounds had been fired by the 11th Marines and 10\r\nbattalions under its operational control in the division sector. This\r\nincluded batteries from the 25th Division Artillery, I Corps Artillery,\r\nand 1st Commonwealth Division Artillery.[523] The artillery outgoing\r\nrepresented 7,057 rounds to assist the 5th Marines at outpost Esther\r\nand 16,668 in defense of Boulder City.\r\n\r\n    [523] The British were not hampered by any ammunition\r\n          restrictions at this time. The excellent liaison between\r\n          the 11th Marines and Commonwealth Division Artillery\r\n          resulted in a humorous incident. After the battle of\r\n          24–25 July, a young British artillery officer arrived\r\n          at a Marine regimental CP. He identified himself as\r\n          being from the unit that had provided artillery support\r\n          to the Marines the previous night, for which he was\r\n          profusely thanked. Before his astonished audience he then\r\n          unrolled an impressive scroll. This proved to be a bill\r\n          enumerating the various types and amounts of projectiles\r\n          fired and specifying the cost in pounds sterling. When\r\n          he felt the Marine staff was properly flabbergasted, he\r\n          grinned and conceded waggishly: “But I am authorized to\r\n          settle for two bottles of your best whiskey!” _Curry ltr._\r\n\r\nOn the morning of 25 July, the Chinese at 0820 again assaulted Hill\r\n119 in company strength. Marine mortar and artillery fire repulsed the\r\nattack, with heavy enemy losses. See-saw action continued for most of\r\nthe rest of the day on the position. No major infantry attempt was\r\nmade at Hill 111. Intense hostile shelling was reported here at 1100,\r\nhowever, when the 3d Battalion, 7th Marines, still in operational\r\ncontrol of the area, began receiving 125 to 150 rounds per minute. The\r\nlast of the Chinese marauders were forced off the forward slope at\r\nBoulder City at 1335. For some welcomed hours both Marine positions\r\nremained quiet. A conservative estimate by 3/7 of the toll for the\r\nenemy’s efforts were 75 CCF killed and 425 wounded.\r\n\r\nAir support that morning was provided by 32 of the sleek, hard-hitting\r\nF9Fs from VMF-115 and -311. Working in tandem over Chinese terrain\r\ndirectly north of the right regimental sector, the two squadrons,\r\nbetween 0616 and 1036, flew nine MPQ missions. In the aerial assault,\r\nthey bombarded the enemy with more than 32 tons of explosives.\r\n\r\nTwelve Marine tanks had a workout, expending 480 HE and 33 WP shells\r\nand 21,300 rounds of machine gun ammunition in direct fire missions.\r\nThe traditional inequity of battlefront luck was plainly demonstrated\r\nbetween a section (two) of armored vehicles near the Hill 111 company\r\nCP and a trio located at Boulder City. It was practically a standoff\r\nfor the former. Together they were able to fire only 71 high explosive\r\nshells, drawing a return of 1,000 rounds of CCF 60mm mortar and 122mm\r\ncannon shells. Blazing guns of the three tanks in the Hill 119 area,\r\nmeanwhile, during the 24-hour firing period had sent 158 HE, 10 WP,\r\nand 17,295 bullets to destroy hostile weapons and installations and\r\nreceived but 120 mortar and another 120 rounds of artillery fire.\r\n\r\nThe 11th Marines were also busy as heavy firing continued on Chinese\r\npolicing parties and those enemy batteries actively shelling MLR\r\npositions. By late afternoon, 13,500 rounds of Chinese mortar and\r\nartillery had crashed against the 7th Marines right sector--the highest\r\nrate of incoming for any 24-hour period during the entire Berlin\r\naction. For its part, the regiment and its medium and heavy support\r\nunits completed 216 counterbattery missions and sent 36,794 rounds of\r\noutgoing into Chinese defenses between 2200 on 24 July and 1600 on the\r\n25th.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, during 25 July, Colonel Nelson’s men continued with their\r\nrelief of the 7th Marines. At 1100 Major Robert D. Thurston, S-3 of\r\n3/1, assumed command of Hill 119 and reorganized the embattled Company\r\nG and Company I personnel, 1st Marines. That night, at 1940, E/2/1 and\r\nF/2/7 effected the relief of the composite George-Item men. At the\r\neastern Hill 111 Company H, 1st Marines had assisted Company H, 7th\r\nMarines during the day in clearing the trenchworks of the enemy; then\r\nat 1815, the 1st Marines unit completed its relief of H/3/7 and took\r\nover responsibility for the MLR right company sector. Not long after,\r\nbeginning at 2130, 1st and 7th Marines at the critical Hill 119 complex\r\nwere attacked by two enemy companies. MLR fire support plus artillery\r\nand tank guns lashed at the enemy and he withdrew. Between 0130 and\r\n0300 the Chinese again probed Hills 111 and 119, gaining small parts of\r\nthe trenchline before being driven out by superior Marine firepower.\r\nMarine casualties were 19 killed and 125 wounded. The CCF had suffered\r\n30 known dead, an estimated 84 killed, and 310 estimated wounded.\r\n\r\nWith dawn on the 26th came the first real quiet the battlefield had\r\nknown for two days. Small enemy groups tried to reinforce by way of the\r\nBerlin trenchline, only to be stopped by Marine riflemen and machine\r\ngunners. Hostile incoming continued spasmodically. At 1330 the 1st\r\nMarines assumed operational control of the right regimental sector,\r\nas scheduled, and of the remaining 7th Marines units still in the\r\narea.[524] By this time Marine casualties since 24 July numbered 43\r\nkilled and 316 wounded.\r\n\r\n    [524] Seventh Marines units were Companies D and E, and\r\n          elements of the 4.2-inch Mortar Company.\r\n\r\nThat night the Communists, knowing the armistice was near and that\r\ntime was running out for seizing the Boulder City objective, made\r\ntheir final attempts at the strongpoint. Again they attacked at 2130.\r\nDefending 1st Marines were now under Captain Esmond E. Harper, CO\r\nof E/2/1, who had assumed command when Major Thurston was seriously\r\nwounded and evacuated. They fought off the Chinese platoon-size drive\r\nwhen the enemy advanced from Berlin to the wire at Hill 119. Shortly\r\nafter midnight another Chinese platoon returned to Hill 119 in the last\r\nskirmish for the territory, but Marine small arms and artillery handily\r\nsent it home. At 0045, a CCF platoon nosed about the Hill 111 area for\r\nan hour and twenty minutes. Again the Marines discouraged these last\r\nfaltering enemy efforts. Action at both hills ceased and what was to\r\nbecome the concluding ground action for the 1st Marine Division in\r\nKorea had ended.\r\n\r\nDespite impressive tenacity and determination, the Chinese Communist\r\nattacks throughout most of July on the two Berlin outposts and Hills\r\n119 and 111 achieved no real gain. Their repetitive assaults on\r\nstrongly-defended Boulder City up until the last day of the war was an\r\nattempt to place the Marines (and the United Nations Command) in as\r\nunfavorable a position as possible when the armistice agreement was\r\nsigned. While talking at Panmunjom, the Communists pressed hungrily on\r\nthe battlefront for as much critical terrain as they could get under\r\ntheir control before the final ceasefire line was established.\r\n\r\nHad the enemy succeeded in his assaults on the two hill defenses after\r\nhis earlier seizure of the Berlins, under terms of the agreement UNC\r\nforces would have been forced to withdraw southward to a point where\r\nthey no longer had free access to all of the Imjin River. If the\r\nChinese had taken Boulder City this would have also provided the CCF\r\na major high ground position (Hill 126) with direct observation into\r\nMarine rear areas and important supply routes.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of casualties, the last month of the Korean War\r\nwas a costly one, with 181 infantry Marines killed in action and\r\ntotal losses of 1,611 men.[525] This was the highest rate for any\r\nmonth during 1953. It was second only to the October 1952 outpost\r\nbattles[526] for any month during the year the 1st Marine Division\r\ndefended the line in West Korea. The closing days of the war produced\r\nthe last action for which Marines were awarded the Navy Cross. These\r\nMarines were Second Lieutenant Bates, H/3/5; First Lieutenant Swigart,\r\nG/3/1; Second Lieutenant Theodore J. Lutz, Jr., H/3/1; and Sergeant\r\nRobert J. Raymond, F/2/7, who was mortally wounded.\r\n\r\n    [525] Casualty breakdown: 181 killed, 86 missing, 862 wounded\r\n          and evacuated, 474 wounded (not evacuated), and 10\r\n          non-battle deaths.\r\n\r\n    [526] During this period 186 Marines were killed and 1,798\r\n          listed as casualties.\r\n\r\nThe 7th and 1st Marines, as the two regiments involved during July in\r\nthe Berlin sector defense, sustained high monthly losses: 804 and 594,\r\nrespectively. Forty-eight men from the 7th Marines and 70 from the\r\n1st Marines were killed in action. In contrast, the 5th Marines which\r\nwitnessed little frontline action during the month (except for a sharp\r\none-night clash at Outpost Esther), suffered total monthly casualties\r\nof 150 men, of whom 26 lost their lives. Chinese losses were also high:\r\n405 counted killed, 761 estimated killed, 1,988 estimated wounded, 1\r\nprisoner, or 3,155 for the month of July.\r\n\r\nIn their unsuccessful attempts to dislodge the Marines from their MLR\r\npositions the Chinese had pounded the right regimental flank with\r\napproximately 22,200 artillery and mortar shells during the last 24–27\r\nJuly battle. In reply, 11th Marines gunners and supporting units had\r\nexpended a total of 64,187 rounds against CCF strongpoints. The enemy’s\r\nincreased counterbattery capabilities in July, noted by division\r\nintelligence, also received particular attention from the artillerymen.\r\nA record number of 345 counterbattery missions were conducted during\r\nthe period by Marine and Army cannoneers.\r\n\r\nMore than 46,000 rounds of outgoing had been fired by the Chinese in\r\ntheir repeated attempts of 7–9, 19–20, and 24–27 July to seize the\r\nBerlin posts and key MLR terrain. Operations during this final month,\r\nas the 2/11 commander was to point out later, on numerous occasions had\r\nverified the wisdom of leaving “direct support artillery battalions in\r\nplace during frequent changes of frontline infantry units.”[527]\r\n\r\n    [527] Col Gordon H. West ltr to Dir, MCHist, HQMC, dtd 1 Jul\r\n          70, hereafter _West ltr_.\r\n\r\nArmored support throughout the 24–27 July period consisted of more than\r\n30 tanks (Company C, AT Company elements of the 1st and 7th Marines, a\r\nsection of flames, and Company D platoon) on line or in reserve. Marine\r\ntankers used a record 1,287 shells and 54,845 bullets against the CCF,\r\nwhile drawing 4,845 rounds of enemy mixed mortar and artillery.\r\n\r\nThe enemy’s attack on Marine MLR positions, beginning 24 July,\r\nconstituted the major action in the I Corps sector the final 10 days\r\nof the war. During this period the Chinese probed I Corps positions 25\r\ntimes (8 in the Marine, 5 in the 1st Commonwealth, 6 in the 1st ROK,\r\nand 6 in the 7th Infantry Division sectors).\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the Eighth Army line, the last large-scale action\r\nhad broken out east of the Marine sector beginning 13 July when major\r\nelements of six Chinese Communist divisions penetrated a ROK unit to\r\nthe right of the IX Corps. As the division’s right and center fell\r\nback, units withdrew into the zones of the IX and ROK II Corps on the\r\neast. General Taylor directed that a new MLR be established south of\r\nthe Kumsong River, and a counterattack 17–20 July by three II Corps\r\ndivisions attained this objective.\r\n\r\nSince the armistice agreement was imminent, no attempt was made\r\nto restore the original line. The Chinese had achieved temporary\r\nsuccess[528] but at heavy cost. Eighth Army officials estimated that\r\nCCF casualties in July reached 72,000 men, with more than 25,000 of\r\nthese dead. The enemy had lost the equivalent of seven divisions of\r\nthe five Chinese armies committed in attacks upon the II and IX Corps\r\nsectors.\r\n\r\n    [528] Minor realignments of the military line of demarcation\r\n          were made in the center sector to include a few miles\r\n          of territory gained by the Communists in their massive\r\n          July offensive there.

The cease-fire, ending\r\ntwo years of often fruitless and hostile truce negotiations, became\r\neffective at 2200 that night. After three years, one month, and two\r\ndays the so-called police action in Korea had come to a halt.\r\n\r\nActually, final agreement on the armistice had been expected since\r\nlate June. By mid-July it was considered imminent, even though the\r\nCCF during these waning days of the war had launched several major\r\ncounteroffensives against ROK troops defending the central part of the\r\nEighth Army line as well as the Marines in the western I Corps sector.\r\n\r\nWith the final resolution of hostilities at 1000, a flash message\r\nwent out immediately to the 26,000 Marines of General Pate’s division\r\ndirecting that there be “no celebration firing related in any way to\r\nthe advent of the armistice.”[530] Fraternization or communication with\r\nthe enemy was expressly forbidden. Personnel were reminded that firing\r\nof all weapons was to be “restricted to the minimum justified by the\r\ntactical situation.”[531] No defensive firing was to take place after\r\n2145 unless the Marines were actually attacked by enemy infantry. Each\r\nfrontline company was authorized to fire one white star cluster at\r\n2200, signalling the cease fire.\r\n\r\n    [530] Msg 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl, dtd 27 Jul 53, quoting Cease Fire\r\n          and Armistice Agreement, IUS-OP-9-53.\r\n\r\n    [531] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nThe signing of the armistice agreement on 27 July thus ended 36 months\r\nof war for the Marines in Korea. On that date, the 1st Marine Division\r\ninitiated plans for its withdrawal to defensive positions south of the\r\nImjin River. One regiment, the 5th Marines, was left north of the river\r\nto man the general outpost line across the entire division front. A\r\ntransition was made at this time from the customary wide-front linear\r\ndefense to a defense in depth, similar to that employed in the July\r\nBoulder City battle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 33      K. WHITE\r\n\r\nEIGHTH ARMY FRONT\r\n\r\n27 JULY 1953]\r\n\r\nBriefly, the armistice agreement decreed that both UNC and Communist\r\nforces:\r\n\r\n  Cease fire 12 hours (at 2200, 27 July) after signing of agreement;\r\n\r\n  Withdraw all military forces, supplies, and equipment from the\r\n  demilitarized zone (2,000 yards from line of contact) within 72\r\n  hours after effective time of ceasefire;\r\n\r\n  Locate and list all fortifications and minefields in the DMZ\r\n  within 72 hours, to be dismantled during a subsequent salvage\r\n  period;\r\n\r\n  Replace combat personnel and supplies on a one-for-one basis, to\r\n  prevent any build-up; and\r\n\r\n  Begin repatriation of all POWs, with exchange to be completed\r\n  within two months.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Marine Division began that afternoon to close out its existing\r\nMLR[532] and withdraw to its designated post-armistice main battle\r\nposition located two kilometers to the south, in the vicinity of the\r\nKANSAS Line. This tactical withdrawal was to be completed no later than\r\n2200 on 30 July.\r\n\r\n    [532] See Map 33 for Eighth Army dispositions on the last day\r\n          of the war.\r\n\r\nBy early afternoon the three infantry regiments had been ordered to\r\nfurnish mine teams to mark, remove, and clear minefields. For units of\r\nthe 1st and 7th Marines deployed at the Boulder Hill Outpost--quiet\r\nonly since 0300 that morning--the cease-fire news understandably\r\ncarried a “let’s see” reaction as the men “waited cautiously throughout\r\nthe day in their fortifications for the White Star Cluster which would\r\nsignify the end ...”[533] Convincing the men at shell-pocked Boulder\r\nCity that a cease-fire was to take place within a few hours would have\r\nbeen a difficult task that day, however, even for the Commandant.\r\n\r\n    [533] 1stMar SAR “Berlins,” p. 5.\r\n\r\nThe Marine infantrymen who had been the target of the last heavy\r\nCommunist attacks of the war might well have had a special sense of\r\nrealism about the end of hostilities. Between the skirmish with Chinese\r\nattacking units in the early hours of the 27th and mine accidents, a\r\ntotal of 46 Marines had been wounded and removed from duty that last\r\nday of the war and 2 others declared missing in action.\r\n\r\nFor the more free-wheeling artillerymen of the 11th Marines, that\r\nfinal day was one of fairly normal operations. During the day, 40\r\ncounterbattery missions had been fired, the majority in reply to\r\nCommunist batteries that came alive at dusk.[534] A total of 102\r\ncountermortar missions were also completed, bringing the total outgoing\r\nthat last month to 75,910 rounds. Action of the regiment continued\r\nuntil 2135, just ten minutes before the preliminary cease-fire which\r\npreceded the official cease-fire at 2200.\r\n\r\n    [534] The CO of the direct support artillery battalion in the\r\n          defense of Boulder City, recalled that “on the evening\r\n          of the 27th, with the Armistice only hours away, 2/11\r\n          received heavy Chinese artillery fire apparently directed\r\n          at the batteries. Of the many rounds ... 80% were duds and\r\n          no damage was done. Numerous time fuzed shells detonated\r\n          hundreds of meters above ground. We figured that they\r\n          were using up old rounds to keep from hauling them back\r\n          north.” _West ltr._\r\n\r\nFor the 7,035 Marine officers and men on duty with General Megee’s 1st\r\nMarine Aircraft Wing, the day was also an active one. That final day of\r\nthe war Corsairs, Skyraiders, and Pantherjets from the wing mounted 222\r\nsorties and blasted the enemy with 354 tons of high explosives along\r\nthe front. Banshees from VMJ-1 flew 15 reconnaissance sorties during\r\nthe day for priority photographs of enemy airfields and railroads.\r\nLast Marine jet pilot in action was Captain William I. Armagost of\r\nVMF-311. He smashed a Communist supply point with four 500-pounders, at\r\n1835, declaring his flight felt “just like the last winning play of a\r\nfootball game.”[535]\r\n\r\n    [535] 1st MAW ComdD, Jul 53 (Folder 3), CTF-91 msg to ComNavFE,\r\n          dtd 27 Jul 53.\r\n\r\nThe wing closed out its share of the Korean War 35 minutes before\r\nthe cease-fire. A VMA-251 aviator, Captain William J. Foster, Jr.,\r\ndropped three 2,000-pound bombs at 2125 in support of UN troops. The\r\ndistinction of flying this final Marine mission over the bombline had\r\ngone, fittingly, to the wing’s newly-arrived “Black Patch” squadron.\r\nAt sea, U.S. and British warships ended the 17-month naval siege by\r\nshelling Wonsan for the last time, and at 2200 the ships in the harbor\r\nturned on their lights. In compliance with the terms of the armistice,\r\nfull evacuation of the WCIDU and ECIDU islands north of the 38th\r\nParallel started at 2200. Island defense forces off both coasts at this\r\ntime began a systematic destruction of their fortifications as they\r\nprepared to move south.\r\n\r\nAs early as 2100 Marine line units reported seeing Chinese soldiers\r\nforward of their own positions, policing their areas. An hour later\r\nlarge groups of enemy were observed along the division sector. Some\r\n“waved lighted candles, flashlights, and banners while others removed\r\ntheir dead and wounded, and apparently looked for souvenirs.”[536]\r\nA few attempts were made by the Chinese to fraternize. One group\r\napproached a Marine listening post and asked for water and wanted to\r\ntalk. Others hung up gift bags at the base of outpost Ava and shouted,\r\n“How are you? Come on over and let’s have a party,” while the Marines\r\nstared at them in silence.[537] The last hostile incoming in the 1st\r\nMarine Division sector was reported at 2152 when five rounds of 82mm\r\nmortar landed on a Korean outpost, COP Camel.\r\n\r\n    [536] 1stMarDiv, ComdD, Jul 53, p. 2. One Marine officer, Major\r\n          General Louis Metzger, who at the time was Executive\r\n          Officer, Kimpo Provisional Regiment, recalled how voices\r\n          of the Chinese Communists’ singing and cheering drifted\r\n          across the Han River that night. “It was an eerie\r\n          thing ... and very depressing.” MajGen Louis Metzger\r\n          comments on draft MS, dtd 1 Jul 70, hereafter _Metzger\r\n          comments_.\r\n\r\n    [537] 1stMarDiv ComdD, _op. cit._, and Rees, _Korea_, p. 434.\r\n\r\nMarines on line that night warily scanned the darkness in front of\r\ntheir trenches. Slowly at first, then with increasing rapidity the\r\nwhite star cluster shells began to burst over positions all along the\r\nline. Thousands of flares illuminated the sky and craggy hills along\r\nthe 155-mile front, from the Yellow Sea to Sea of Japan. The war in\r\nKorea was over. Of the men from the one Marine Division and air wing\r\ncommitted in Korea during the three-year conflict, 4,262 had been\r\nkilled in battle. An additional 26,038 Marines were wounded. No fewer\r\nthan 42 Marines would receive the Nation’s highest combat decoration,\r\nthe Medal of Honor, for outstanding valor--26 of them posthumously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nReturn of the Prisoners of War\r\n\r\n_Operation_ BIG SWITCH--_Circumstances of Capture--The Communist POW\r\nCamps--CCF “Lenient Policy” and Indoctrination Attempts--The Germ\r\nWarfare Issue--Problems and Performance of Marine POWs--Marine Escape\r\nAttempts--Evaluation and Aftermath_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Operation_ BIG SWITCH[538]\r\n\r\n    [538] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chaps. 9,\r\n          10; 1stMarDiv ComdDs, Jul-Sep 53; 1stMarDiv G-3\r\n          Jnls, Jul-Aug 53; 1st MAW ComdD, Jul 53; 11thMar,\r\n          MAG-33 ComdDs, Jul 53; HRS Subject File VE23.2.S8\r\n          “CMC Statements on Korean POWs”; HRS Subject File #1\r\n          “Prisoners of War--Korea--General”; HRS Subject Files\r\n          “Prisoners of War--Korea--News Clippings, folders #1,\r\n          #2, #3”; Korea War casualty cards from Statistical\r\n          Unit, Casualty Section, Personal Affairs Br, Code DNA,\r\n          HQMC; MacDonald, _POW_; Berger, _Korea Knot_; Clark,\r\n          _Danube to Yalu_; T.

After the conclusion\r\nof hostilities, Marine POWs were among the UNC fighting men returned in\r\nOperation BIG SWITCH.\r\n\r\n    [539] Marine Corps prisoners, including their unit designations\r\n          and date of release (or death), are listed in MacDonald,\r\n          _POW_, pp. 249–273.\r\n\r\nThe new mission of the 1st Marine Division, with the cease-fire,\r\ncalled for organization of the Post Armistice Battle Positions and\r\nestablishment of a No-Pass Line approximately 200 yards south of the\r\nDemilitarized Zone boundary. In addition to maintaining a defensive\r\nreadiness posture for full-scale operations if hostilities resumed,\r\nthe Marine division was charged with control of the Munsan-ni area\r\nand assisting in repatriation of prisoners of war. Obviously, since\r\nthe Panmunjom release point for receiving the POWs was located in the\r\nMarine zone of action, the division--as in the earlier LITTLE SWITCH\r\nprisoner exchange--would play a major part in the final repatriation.\r\n\r\nWith the armistice and ending of the war expected almost daily, the\r\nMunsan-ni Provisional Command was activated and reorganized in June.\r\nOnce again, the 1st Marine Division was responsible for the United\r\nNations Personnel and Medical Processing Unit, organized along lines\r\nsimilar to those used during the preliminary exchange. The division\r\ninspector, Colonel Albert F. Metze, was designated Processing Unit\r\nCommander. Sections under his direction were staffed by Marine and\r\nnaval personnel. The normal command structure was reinforced by special\r\nengineer, medical, interpreter, food service, chaplain, security,\r\nsignal, supply, and motor transport teams. Planning for the project,\r\nlike all military operations, was thorough and continuous.\r\n\r\nAs in April, the Munsan-ni Provisional Command assumed responsibility\r\nfor handling the UN repatriation at Panmunjom as well as supervision of\r\nthe receiving and processing of ROKA personnel. Brigadier General Ralph\r\nM. Osborne, USA, was placed in charge of the command, with headquarters\r\nat the United Nations Base Camp. The RCT landing exercise for the\r\n1st Marines, scheduled in July, was cancelled because of shipping\r\ncommitments for Operation BIG SWITCH, as the Navy Amphibious Force\r\nreadied itself for the repatriation of prisoners. By the end of July,\r\nthe 1st Marine Division was supporting “approximately 42,400 troops\r\nwith Class I [rations] and 48,600 with Class III [petroleum products]\r\ndue to the influx of units and personnel participating in Operation BIG\r\nSWITCH.”[540]\r\n\r\n    [540] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9, p. 9-134.\r\n\r\nSeveral days before the exchange, however, it became evident that the\r\nold site of the Gate to Freedom used in the April exchange would have\r\nto be abandoned. It was found inadequate to handle the larger number of\r\nreturning prisoners--approximately 400 daily--to be processed in the\r\nnew month-long operation. The new site, Freedom Village, near Munsan-ni\r\ncontained an old Army warehouse which was renovated by the 1st Division\r\nengineers and transformed into the 11th Evacuation Hospital where the\r\nUN Medical and Processing Unit was located. Members of the division\r\nMilitary Police Company provided security for the exchange area.\r\nMarines from practically every unit of the division were assigned\r\nduties at the United Nations Processing Center. As General Clark, UNC\r\nCommander later recalled:\r\n\r\n  Preparations for Big Switch were necessarily elaborate. At Munsan\r\n  we had a huge warehouse stocked high with clothing, blankets,\r\n  medical equipment and other supplies for the returning POWs. At\r\n  Freedom Village nearby we had a complete hospital unit ready. It\r\n  was one of the Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals (MASH) which had\r\n  done such magnificent work close to the front through most of the\r\n  war.[541]\r\n\r\n    [541] Clarke, _Danube to Yalu_, pp. 298–299.\r\n\r\nOn 5 August, the first day of BIG SWITCH, Colonel Metze took a final\r\nlook around the processing center. Readiness of this camp was his\r\nresponsibility. If anyone had real understanding of a prisoner’s\r\nrelieved and yet shaken reaction to new freedom it was this Marine\r\nColonel. Chosen by the United Nations Command to build and direct the\r\nenlarged Freedom Village, Colonel Metze himself had been a prisoner of\r\nwar in World War II. He knew from personal experience how men should be\r\ntreated and what should be done for them early in their new freedom.\r\nFor many, this was after nearly three long years in Communist prison\r\ncamps. That morning, as described by an observer:\r\n\r\n  Members of his [Colonel Metze’s] command stood by their cubicles,\r\n  awaiting the first signal. The 129 enlisted Marines, corpsmen,\r\n  doctors and other UN personnel had held a dress rehearsal only\r\n  the day before. Everything was ready.[542]\r\n\r\n    [542] Heinecke, “Big Switch,” p. 44.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles northwest another group of Marines assigned to the\r\nProvisional Command Receipt and Control section waited almost in the\r\nshadow of the famous “peace pagoda” at Panmunjom. UNC receiving teams,\r\neach headed by a Marine Corps major, “watched the road to the north for\r\nthe first sign of a dust cloud which would herald the approach of the\r\nCommunist convoy.”[543] The United Nations POWs had been assembled at\r\nKaesong and held there in several groups, preparatory to the return.\r\nThe exchange agreement had specified that the repatriation would\r\nbegin at 0900. Precisely at 0855 the Communist convoy, led by three\r\nRussian-made jeeps, each carrying one CCF and two _NKPA_ officers,\r\nmoved out from the Communist side of the peace corridor. Trucks and\r\nambulances followed the jeeps.\r\n\r\n    [543] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nAs they approached the exchange site, “a Marine officer bellowed the\r\nfamiliar naval command, ‘Marines, man your stations!’”[544] Rosters\r\nof the UNC prisoners in the trucks and ambulances were then presented\r\nto the Marine team captains who checked the lists. As they called the\r\nnames, “thin, wan, but smiling men shuffled from the trucks to the\r\nmedical tents.”[545]\r\n\r\n    [544] _Ibid._, p. 45.\r\n\r\n    [545] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nOfficial receipt of the POWs at Panmunjom was by the Munsan-ni\r\nProvisional Command Receipt and Control Officer, assisted by 35\r\nofficers and enlisted men from the 1st Marine Division. After their\r\nscreening by medical officers, UN returnees not in need of immediate\r\nmedical aid were transferred by ambulance to Freedom Village at\r\nMunsan-ni for further processing. Helicopter priority went to litter\r\npatients too weak to travel by ambulance. POWs requiring prompt\r\ntreatment were loaded aboard the HMR-161 carriers and flown to the 11th\r\nEvacuation Hospital at Freedom Village.\r\n\r\nSeriously injured men were transferred directly to the Inchon hospital\r\nships for embarkation to the United States, or were air-evacuated to\r\nJapan. South Korean repatriates were processed and went their way to\r\nfreedom through nearby Liberty Village, the ROK counterpart of Freedom\r\nVillage. A huge map was used to check progress of the POW convoys en\r\nroute from Panmunjom to Freedom Village. The departure of ambulances\r\nand helicopters from Panmunjom was radioed ahead to Freedom Village,\r\nwhere medical personnel and vehicles lined the landing mat.\r\n\r\nAt Munsan-ni, the newly-freed men received a more thorough physical\r\nexam and the rest of their processing. Here they were again screened\r\nby medical officers to determine their physical condition. Able-bodied\r\nPOWs were escorted to the personnel data section where necessary\r\nadministrative details were recorded and their military records\r\nbrought up to date. Those medically cleared were available for press\r\ninterviews. New clothing issue, individually tailored, probably as much\r\nas anything emphasized to a prisoner that his particular Korean War was\r\nover. And nearly all of them found news[546] awaiting them in letters\r\nfrom home. When all basic details were completed, returnees went into\r\nthe recreation and refreshment section. Commonplace iced tea, coffee,\r\nice cream (the favorite), milk, sandwiches, cigarettes, and the latest\r\nperiodicals were luxuries. In their weakened condition, the POWs could\r\nbe served only light fare; the big steaks would come later.\r\n\r\n    [546] For at least two Marines their return home was news in\r\n          itself. Captain Paul L. Martelli, VMF-323, had been\r\n          reported KIA. First Lieutenant Robert J. O’Shea, of\r\n          division headquarters, the son of Marine Brigadier\r\n          General George J. O’Shea (Ret), had also been thought\r\n          dead by his family. He had been reported missing in July\r\n          1951 and had not been carried on the official POW list\r\n          released the following December.\r\n\r\nThe first Marine and fifth man in the processing line on the initial\r\nday, 5 August, was Private First Class Alfred P. Graham, Jr., of H/3/5.\r\nAlthough too weak to enter the press room, the 21-year-old repatriate\r\ntold newsmen later in Tokyo of being fed a diet of cracked corn during\r\nhis prison camp stay and of being forced to carry firewood 11 miles\r\neach day. The second Marine returned that day, and the 34th man to\r\nenter Freedom Village, was Sergeant Robert J. Coffee, of the 1st Signal\r\nBattalion. Captured in November 1950, he had been wounded just before\r\nbeing taken prisoner and had received little medical treatment. Like\r\nother returnees, Coffee stated that the treatment had been very poor\r\nwhile he was in the hands of the North Koreans but that it had improved\r\nsomewhat after he was turned over to the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThird and last Marine to come through the line was Private First\r\nClass Pedron E. Aviles, previously with the Reconnaissance Company\r\nof Headquarters Battalion. Knocked unconscious with a rifle butt\r\nwhile battling the enemy on a patrol on 7 December 1952, he regained\r\nconsciousness to find himself a prisoner of the CCF.\r\n\r\nOn the second day, three more USMC infantrymen traveled that final\r\nroad to freedom. They were Private First Class Francis E. Kohus, Jr.,\r\nof A/1/7; Corporal Gethern Kennedy, Jr., I/3/1; and Private First\r\nClass Bernard R. Hollinger, H/3/5. Like the preceding three, their\r\nstories bore a similar pattern: usually they had been captured only\r\nafter having been wounded or clubbed unconscious. As with other UNC\r\nprisoners being released daily, they told of the physical cruelty of\r\ntheir North Korean captors and the mental strain under the Chinese.\r\nObservers noted that many of the men released this second day were in\r\nmuch poorer physical condition than the initial returnees. In fact, one\r\nROK prisoner was found to have died in an ambulance while en route to\r\nLiberty Village.\r\n\r\nMostly the repatriates asked questions about their old outfits: “Do you\r\nknow if any of the other guys on the outpost got back off the hill?”\r\nand “Did we finally take the damn thing?” “Where’s the 24th Division\r\nnow?”[547]\r\n\r\n    [547] HRB Subject File: “#1, ‘Prisoners Of War--Korea--General,’”\r\n          HQMC Div Info release, n.d., n.t.\r\n\r\nTechnical Sergeant Richard E. Arnold was one of the two Marine combat\r\ncorrespondents at Freedom Village during BIG SWITCH. He described his\r\nimpressions of the returning men--in some cases, coming home after 30\r\nmonths’ confinement in North Korean POW camps, and others, as little as\r\n30 days:\r\n\r\n  All are relieved and some a little afraid ... It’s their\r\n  first hour of freedom, and most tell you that they can still\r\n  hardly believe it’s true. Some are visibly shaken, some are\r\n  confused--and all are overwhelmed at the thought of being free\r\n  men once again.[548]\r\n\r\n    [548] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nAs in prison life everywhere, the POWs told of the hated stool pigeons,\r\nthe so-called “progressives.” These were the captives who accepted (or\r\nappeared to accept) the Communist teachings and who, in turn, were\r\ntreated better than the “reactionary” prisoners who resisted the enemy\r\n“forced feeding” indoctrination. Continued the Marine correspondent:\r\n\r\n  They don’t talk much. When they do, it’s ... mainly of\r\n  progressives and reactionaries--the two social groups of prisoner\r\n  life under the rule of Communism, the poor chow and medical care,\r\n  and of the desire to fight Communism again.\r\n\r\n  When you ask, they tell you of atrocities committed during\r\n  the early years of the war with a bitterness of men who have\r\n  helplessly watched their friends and buddies die. Of forced\r\n  marches, the bitter cold, and the endless political lectures they\r\n  were forced to attend.[549]\r\n\r\n    [549] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nOne of the last--possibly _the last_--Marine captured by the Chinese\r\nwas Private First Class Richard D. Johnson, of G/3/1. The 20-year-old\r\nmachine gunner had been in the final battle of the war, the Boulder\r\nCity defense, and was taken 25 July, just two days before the signing\r\nof the truce. Private First Class Johnson was returned the 19th day of\r\nthe exchange. Another Marine seized in that same action was Private\r\nFirst Class Leonard E. Steege, H/3/7. As he entered the gate, he\r\nmomentarily shook up Corporal James E. Maddell, a military policeman\r\non duty at Freedom Village. Maddell said the last time he saw Steege\r\nwas during the fighting for the outpost. “He was a dead Marine then,”\r\nMaddel said, “but I guess it was just a case of mistaken identity.”[550]\r\n\r\n    [550] Heinecke, “Big Switch,” p. 48.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jesse V. Booker of Headquarters Squadron 1, the first Marine\r\nPOW of the war, who had been captured on 7 August 1950, was also one\r\nof the earliest MAW personnel released. Booker and First Lieutenant\r\nRichard Bell, VMF-311, were returned to UNC jurisdiction on 27 August,\r\nthe first Marine aviators to be sent back.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the regular issue of Marine utilities, gold naval\r\naviator’s wings, donated by 1st MAW fliers, were pinned on the chests\r\nof returning pilots by Wing General Megee and Division General Pate.\r\nAlso welcoming Marine returnees at Freedom Village were Brigadier\r\nGeneral Verne J. McCaul, the new Assistant Wing Commander; General\r\nBurger, ADC; and Colonel Metze, who also “found time during the busy\r\ndays to greet and talk with every Marine and Navy Corpsman who passed\r\nthrough.”[551] Among those dignitaries[552] present for the occasion\r\nwere General Taylor, EUSAK CG; General Clarke, I Corps Commander;\r\nSecretary of the Army, Robert T. Stevens; and various U.S. senators.\r\n\r\n    [551] 1stMarDiv ComdD, Aug 53, App. VI, p. 12.\r\n\r\n    [552] As the exchange got underway, General Mark Clark was on a\r\n          trip to the U.S. Unable to greet the returning prisoners,\r\n          as he had at LITTLE SWITCH, the UNC Commander had a\r\n          welcoming letter waiting for each repatriate. A booklet\r\n          especially prepared for returning POWs which contained a\r\n          quick fill-in on world news and sports events they may\r\n          have missed as prisoners was also given each returnee.\r\n          _Washington Post_, dtd 5 Aug 53, p. 3.\r\n\r\nDuring August enlisted POWs were recovered in large numbers.\r\nOfficers, generally, did not arrive at Kaesong--the first step to\r\nPanmunjom--until about 21 August. After that date they were gradually\r\nreturned to friendly control.\r\n\r\nEven as late as 26 August there was considerable concern over the\r\nfate of hundreds of Allied officers not yet repatriated. Some early\r\nreturning officers told of colonels, majors and captains who had been\r\nsentenced up to ten years for forming “reactionary groups” in camp. One\r\nfield grade officer had been sentenced to a long prison term on the\r\neve of the armistice.[553] A similar thing nearly happened to Captain\r\nJohn P. Flynn, VMF(N)-513, long a thorn in the side of his Communist\r\ncaptors. Like a number of UNC airmen falsely charged with waging germ\r\nwarfare, he vigorously denounced these allegations. “Even as late as\r\nthe end of August the Marine was threatened with nonrepatriation, and\r\nhis experience formed the basis for an episode in the novel _A Ride to\r\nPanmunjom_.”[554]\r\n\r\n    [553] HRS Subject File: “#1. “PRISONERS OF\r\n          WAR--Korea--General,” _Washington News_ article, dtd 26\r\n          Aug 53 from Panmunjom, “Officers’ Fate Worries Army,” by\r\n          Jim G. Lucas.\r\n\r\n    [554] MacDonald, _POW_, p. 225.\r\n\r\nBetween 5 August-6 September, 3,597 U.S. servicemen were returned\r\nduring Operation BIG SWITCH, including 129 ground and 28 air Marines.\r\nThis 157 figure represents a total of 42 officers and 115 enlisted\r\nrepatriated during this second and final POW exchange. Of the 27 Naval\r\npersonnel freed, at least 6 were hospital corpsmen serving with the 1st\r\nMarine Division when they were taken. Counting the 157 Marines released\r\nin Operation BIG SWITCH and the 15 wounded POWs sent back in April, a\r\ntotal of 172 division and wing Marines were returned in the two POW\r\nexchanges.\r\n\r\nAlthough the switch took place over a five-week period, 38 Marines,\r\nor 24 percent, were not released until late in the proceedings, in\r\nSeptember. As one author noted, “It was Communist policy to hold the\r\n‘reactionaries’ ... to the last.”[555]\r\n\r\n    [555] Fehrenbach, _Kind of War_, p. 651.\r\n\r\nTwo of the best-known Marine “reactionaries” who had openly defied\r\ntheir Communist jailers during their entire period of captivity,\r\nwere then-Lieutenant Colonel William G. Thrash, a VMA-121 pilot, and\r\nthen-Major John N. McLaughlin, taken POW in November 1950. McLaughlin\r\nwas released on 1 September and Thrash on 5 September in a group of 275\r\nAmericans returned, the largest number for any single day’s transfer\r\nsince the exchange began. The most famous U.S. prisoner held by the\r\nCommunists was Major General William F. Dean. Formerly commander of the\r\nU.S. Army 24th Division, he had been captured in August 1950 after the\r\nfall of Taejon.\r\n\r\nEver since Operation BIG SWITCH got under way, every returnee had\r\nbeen asked if he had seen or heard of General Dean. None had. Many UN\r\nofficers felt--uneasily--that he would probably be the last officer to\r\nbe sent back. In fact, he emerged from imprisonment on 4 September “to\r\nbe greeted with cheers at Freedom Village.”[556] Major Walter R. Harris\r\nand the most senior Marine captured during the war, Colonel Frank H.\r\nSchwable, later to be the central figure in a Court of Inquiry, were\r\namong the last nine Marines returned on 6 September, the final day\r\nof the switch. And so, one by one, the last 160 American POWs passed\r\nthrough Panmunjom. All were men marked by the enemy as “war criminals.”\r\n\r\n    [556] _Life_ Magazine, v. 35, no. 11 (15 Sep 53), p. 42.\r\n\r\nOne Army sergeant, who freely admitted he could “never adequately\r\ndescribe how he felt when he knew he was going home”[557] recalled\r\nthose final moments as a newly-freed prisoner:\r\n\r\n    [557] Fehrenbach, _Kind of War_, p. 651.\r\n\r\n  At 1100 his truck pulled up at Panmunjom, the last convoy of\r\n  American POWs to be exchanged. A huge, moustached Marine master\r\n  sergeant walked up beside the truck, called out: “I will call\r\n  out your last name. You will answer with your first name, middle\r\n  initial, and Army serial number ...”\r\n\r\n  “Schlichter!”\r\n\r\n  Schlichter [Charles B., Sgt.], barked out his response, and\r\n  stepped down.\r\n\r\n  “Sergeant,” the big Marine said gravely, “glad to have you home.”\r\n\r\n  “Fella, you don’t know how glad _I_ am,” Schlichter said.[558]\r\n\r\n    [558] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nIn the preliminary prisoner exchange, the week-long “LITTLE SWITCH”\r\nin April 1953, all of the returned Marine personnel were men who had\r\nbeen wounded at the time of their capture. They were recently-captured\r\nPOWs, deliberately segregated by the enemy from early captives. All of\r\nthese home-coming Marines had been captured since May 1952. Generally\r\nspeaking, they had all been fairly well-treated.\r\n\r\nDuring Operation BIG SWITCH, by contrast, 41 Marines were repatriated\r\nwho had spent nearly three years as Communist prisoners of war. The\r\nmajority of USMC returnees in this second exchange, however--a total of\r\n91--had been captured relatively recently, in 1952 and 1953, and 25 had\r\nbeen held since 1951.\r\n\r\nThroughout Operation BIG SWITCH, the Allied Command transferred a total\r\nof 75,799 prisoners (70,159 NKPA and 5,640 CCF) seeking repatriation.\r\nThe Communist returned 12,757 POWs. In addition to the 3,597 Americans,\r\nthis total represented 1,312 other UNC troops (including 947 Britons,\r\n228 Turks, and small numbers of Filipinos, Australians, and Canadians)\r\nand 7,848 South Koreans.\r\n\r\nThe BIG SWITCH exchange went relatively smoothly, marred for a while\r\nonly by the unruly behavior of some Communist diehard POWs. In a manner\r\nreminiscent of their earlier camp riots, the Communist POWs put on\r\na blatant propaganda show for the benefit of world newsreel cameras.\r\nAs the train carrying CCF and North Korean prisoners moved into the\r\nPanmunjom exchange point, enemy POWs noisily shouted Communist slogans,\r\ndefiantly waved Communist flags, and hurled insults at UN forces.\r\nSome POWs stripped off their [U.S. provided] uniforms, “tossing them\r\ncontemptuously to the ground.”[559] Others spat in the faces of U.S.\r\nsupervising officers, threw their shoes at jeep windshields, and sang\r\nin Korean and Chinese “We will return in the Fall.”[560]\r\n\r\n    [559] _Life_ Magazine, v. 35, no. 7 (17 Aug 53), p. 22.\r\n\r\n    [560] _Metzger comments._\r\n\r\nMarine division and wing elements were designated responsible for\r\nthe security of nonrepatriated enemy POWs. By terms of the armistice\r\nagreement, these were held by UNC custodial forces from India. In\r\ncommenting on the airlift operations, performed largely by HMR-161, the\r\nUNC Commander noted:\r\n\r\n  We had to go to great lengths to live up to our pledge to Syngman\r\n  Rhee that no Indian troops would set foot on South Korean soil.\r\n  Therefore, we set up an airlift operation which carried more than\r\n  six thousand Indians from the decks of our carriers off Inchon by\r\n  helicopter to the Demilitarized Zone. It was a major undertaking\r\n  which just about wore out our helicopter fleet in Korea.[561]\r\n\r\n    [561] Clark, _Danube to Yalu_, p. 299.\r\n\r\nOne of the recommendations made by military officials after the April\r\nLITTLE SWITCH exchange was that all interrogation of returning POWs\r\nbe done either in America or on board ship en route home, rather than\r\nin Tokyo. This system was followed and worked out well. The POWs\r\nboarded ships at Inchon, following their clearance at Freedom Village.\r\nInterrogation teams, in most cases, completed this major part of their\r\nrepatriation processing before docking at San Francisco. Two weeks\r\nof recuperation, good food and rest aboard ship enabled many POWs to\r\narrive home in far better shape for reunion with their families than\r\nthey had been in when received initially at Panmunjom.\r\n\r\nAs in LITTLE SWITCH, Marine and Navy personnel were processed by\r\nmembers of the Intelligence Department of Commander, Naval Forces\r\nFar East, augmented by officers from other Marine staffs. Marine\r\nofficers who conducted the shipboard interrogations again included\r\nLieutenant Colonel Fisher, ComNavFE liaison officer, as well as\r\nLieutenant Colonel William A. Wood, Major Stewart C. Barber, and First\r\nLieutenant Robert A. Whalen. All returning POWs were queried in depth\r\nby counterintelligence personnel about enemy treatment and atrocities,\r\nquestionable acts committed by that small proportion of our own men\r\nwhose conduct was reprehensible, and routine military matters. A\r\nsecurity dossier was prepared on each prisoner, and all data about\r\nhim went into his file case. The LITTLE SWITCH reports had indicated\r\nearlier--and this was subsequently confirmed--that some U.S. servicemen\r\nwere definitely marked for further detailed questioning and scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Circumstances of Capture_[562]\r\n\r\n    [562] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: HRS Subject File: VE 23.2.S8 “CMC\r\n          Statements on Korean POWs”; HRS Subject File:\r\n          “Korea--Korean War--General”; MacDonald, _POW_; Montross,\r\n          Kuokka, and Hicks, _USMC Ops Korea--East-Central Front_,\r\n          v. IV; Matthew B. Ridgway, _The Korean War_ (Garden City:\r\n          Doubleday & Co., Inc., 1967), hereafter Ridgway, _Korean\r\n          War_; Heinecke, “Big Switch.”\r\n\r\nAs the Commandant, General Shepherd, was to testify later during an\r\ninvestigation, “the prisoner of war question had never been a major\r\nproblem [in the Marine Corps] due to the extremely limited number of\r\nMarines taken prisoner.”[563] As one returnee at BIG SWITCH bluntly\r\nput it: “You fought until they reached you with a bullet or a rifle\r\nbutt--that was the end.”[564]\r\n\r\n    [563] HRS Subject File: “VE 23.2.S8--CMC Statements on Korean\r\n          POWs,” CMC Statement dtd 14 Apr 54, p. 2.\r\n\r\n    [564] Heinecke, “Big Switch,” p. 58.\r\n\r\nOf the 221 U.S. Marines captured during the Korean War, more than\r\nhalf--121--were seized after 20 September 1951. For the Marine Corps\r\nthis date marked the time when “warfare of position replaced a warfare\r\nof movement throughout the remaining 22 months of the conflict in\r\nKorea.”[565] Both in the X Corps sector in eastern Korea where the\r\n1st Marine Division was located at that time, as well as later on the\r\nKorean western front, the Marine Corps was denied its traditional\r\naggressive fighting role. The Marines (along with the rest of the UNC\r\nforces) ceased offensive operations, were reduced to making limited\r\nattacks, and were under order from higher echelons to “firm up the\r\nexisting line and to patrol vigorously forward of it.”[566]\r\n\r\n    [565] Montross, Kuokka, and Hicks, _USMC Ops Korea_, v. IV, p.\r\n          201.\r\n\r\n    [566] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nThe mission of the Marine division thereby evolved into “an aggressive\r\ndefense of their sector of responsibility” as records duly phrased it.\r\nOn a larger scale, the nature of the Korean War, from about November\r\n1951 on, reverted to that of July and August,[567] characterized\r\nprimarily by minor patrol clashes and small unit struggles for key\r\noutpost positions. This became the pattern for the remainder of the\r\nwar. It changed only when the decreed mission of an “active defense\r\nof its sector” by a UNC unit became this in fact. Normal defense\r\nthen escalated into sharp, vigorous fighting to retain friendly key\r\nground positions being attacked by the enemy. One American writer, in\r\na discussion of the British defense in depth concept (adopted by the\r\nMarine Corps late in the war), went so far as to blame heavy Marine\r\ncasualties in Korea on EUSAK’s outpost system.[568]\r\n\r\n    [567] In July 1951, fighting had quieted down all along the\r\n          UNC front, as a result of truce talks initiated by the\r\n          Communists. This conveniently provided the enemy, at that\r\n          time hard-pressed, a much-needed breathing spell. The\r\n          lull in ground fighting continued until late August when\r\n          the truce negotiations were suspended.\r\n\r\n    [568] HRS Subject file “Korea--Korean War--General,” article\r\n          _Washington Times-Herald_, dtd 20 Aug 53, by Walter\r\n          Simmons, p. 27.\r\n\r\nApproximately half of the 100 Marines taken prisoner by September\r\n1951--43--had fallen into enemy hands during the last two days\r\nof November 1950. They had been part of the ill-fated Task Force\r\nDrysdale,[569] a composite Royal Marine-USMC-Army convoy that was\r\nambushed by the Chinese en route to the Chosin Reservoir. These facts\r\nare relevant to a better understanding of the Commandant’s statement\r\nthat, traditionally, few Marines become prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n    [569] For further details of this action, see MacDonald,\r\n          _POW_, pp. 33–43; Montross and Canzona, _USMC Ops\r\n          Korea--Chosin_, v. III, pp. 140–141, 225–235; and Reese,\r\n          _Korea_, p. 162.\r\n\r\nOverall, the survival rate for Marines taken captive during the\r\nKorean War was 87.8 percent. Even for the worst year, 1950, when NKPA\r\ntreatment was more ruthless and brutal than the CCF (and in any event,\r\nfor those men longest-held), the Marine survival rate was 75 percent.\r\nMarine Corps statistics show that of 221 Marines captured, 194 (43\r\nofficers, 151 enlisted) returned, and 27 or 12.2 percent died.[570]\r\nOnly a few Marines were afflicted with “give-up-itis,” the malady\r\nthat struck countless POWs and took a heavy toll of lives. Included\r\namong these 194 returnees were the 172 men from the two POW exchanges,\r\nas previously noted; plus a group of 18 Marines captured in 1950 who\r\nescaped and rejoined USMC units in May 1951; two enlisted men who\r\nescaped less than a week after being taken; and two others released by\r\nthe enemy after less than a month’s captivity.\r\n\r\n    [570] Records indicate that 3 officers and 18 enlisted died\r\n          while in captivity. Three officers and 3 enlisted POWs\r\n          were also presumed to have died. MacDonald, _POW_, pp.\r\n          257–259.\r\n\r\nIn a pure statistical oddity, the survival percentage for both Marine\r\nofficers and enlisted (as well as the overall return rate) turned out\r\nto be the same: 87 percent.\r\n\r\nWithout going into an analysis here of the possible relevant factors,\r\nit is interesting to note that 62 percent of all U.S. captured military\r\npersonnel returned after the Korean War and that roughly 38 percent\r\ndied while imprisoned.[571] During World War II, the death rate for\r\nU.S. prisoners held by the Axis powers was approximately 11 percent.\r\n\r\n    [571] The number of American servicemen returned was\r\n          approximately 4,428 of 7,190 captured during the war.\r\n          _Encyclopaedia Britannica_, 1966 edition, “Prisoners\r\n          of War--Korean War,” p. 519B. Earlier DOD “Tentative\r\n          Final Report of U.S. Battle Casualties in the Korean\r\n          War,” cited by MacDonald, _POW_, p. 230, indicated 7,140\r\n          Americans were captured, 4,418 recovered, and 2,701 died.\r\n          Either way, the percentages remain the same.\r\n\r\nCircumstances accounting for the capture of Marines during the Korean\r\nWar were, as in every war, an occupational hazard. In most cases,\r\nprisoners were taken in one of two situations. One occurred when\r\noverwhelming numbers of hostile forces suddenly surrounded and overran\r\na small outpost, and either killed or captured a high proportion of its\r\ndefenders. The second resulted from the well-known increasing accuracy\r\nof CCF antiaircraft fire. Halfway through the war it began to take its\r\ntoll of 1st MAW pilots with similarly predictable results: either death\r\nor capture. Simple mischance and the human error of confused directions\r\ncaused at least two ground Marines to blunder into enemy territory.[572]\r\n\r\n    [572] A similar mishap had dire consequences for Major\r\n          General Dean of the Army. Cut off from his unit, he\r\n          was attempting to return to the U.S. line. Lacking a\r\n          compass he walked to the southwest--and thereby into NKPA\r\n          hands--instead of the southeast where U.S. troops were\r\n          then heavily engaged in the fierce battle of the Pusan\r\n          Perimeter.\r\n\r\nA brief review of the Korean War, chronologically, illustrates how\r\nsome of the men of the 1st Marine Division wound up as prisoners. In\r\nthe first week of August 1950, leading elements of the 1st Provisional\r\nMarine Brigade and the 1st MAW air squadrons arrived in Korea. Soon\r\nthereafter the Marine Corps was in the thick of these early-moving\r\noffensives: at the Pusan Perimeter; the September Inchon-Seoul\r\namphibious landings; Fox Hill at Toktong Pass, Yudam-ni, the Task Force\r\nDrysdale operation, all in November; and the October-December Chosin\r\nReservoir campaign, including the two-day movement from Hagaru to\r\nKoto-ri in early December. Marine infantry, military police, tankers,\r\nmotor transport personnel, and artillerymen were listed MIA in these\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nAltogether, 79 Marines were captured during the first year. November\r\n1950, when 58 Marines were lost to the enemy, would rank as the most\r\ncostly month of the entire war in terms of Marines seized in combat.\r\nThe first air POW, Captain Booker, was shot down 7 August while flying\r\na reconnaissance mission from the USS _Valley Forge_. (This was the\r\nsame date that infantrymen of the Marine Provisional Brigade saw their\r\ninitial heavy fighting in what was then considered only a “police\r\naction.”) Captain Booker was to remain the only Marine pilot in enemy\r\nhands until April 1951.\r\n\r\nOne ground Marine captured during the hectic days of August 1950\r\nescaped before ever becoming listed as a casualty. Although Private\r\nFirst Class Richard E. Barnett thus does not technically qualify as a\r\nPOW statistic, he still holds the distinction of being both one of the\r\nfirst Marine captives and one of the few to escape.[573]\r\n\r\n    [573] A radio-jeep driver, Private First Class Barnett, was\r\n          returning to his unit when he made a wrong turn and,\r\n          instead, came upon a group of North Koreans. The enemy\r\n          fired and halted the vehicle, quickly taking Barnett\r\n          prisoner. Beaten, searched, and interrogated, the Marine\r\n          was placed in a heavily-guarded cellar. For several days\r\n          he was given only a few crackers to eat. On the third\r\n          night, unaccountably, the Koreans took him along on an\r\n          attack. As they neared the objective, Barnett noticed\r\n          that all but one of his NKPA guards had gotten ahead of\r\n          him. He deliberately fell, throwing a rock in the face\r\n          of the nearby guard, and raced for safety. Successfully\r\n          eluding his captors, Private First Class Barnett later\r\n          rejoined his own forces. MacDonald, _POW_, pp. 8–10.\r\n\r\nFew Marines were taken during 1951. Of the 31 seized throughout the\r\nentire year, 13 were from the division and 18 from the wing. The\r\nMarines were engaged in antiguerrilla activities until late February\r\nwhen a general advance was ordered by U.S. IX and X Corps to deny\r\npositions to the enemy. The 1st Marine Division was committed near\r\nWonju, as part of the IX Corps. A second offensive, Operation RIPPER,\r\nwas launched in March, and for the next six weeks small inroads were\r\nmade against CCF forces. Relieved in the Hongchon area the next month\r\nby elements of the U.S. 2d and 7th Divisions, the Marines continued to\r\noperate as part of the IX Corps. Their mission was to secure objectives\r\nnorth of the 38th Parallel. On 21 April the 1st Marine Division\r\nlaunched its attack, on IX Corps order, encountering moderate to\r\nheavy resistance. Throughout the first half of 1951, only five Marine\r\ninfantrymen were captured.\r\n\r\nTruce negotiations, as earlier noted, began at Kaesong on 10 July\r\n1951 and ground fighting slowed. When the Communists broke off the\r\ntruce sessions in late August General Van Fleet, then EUSAK commander,\r\nordered an offensive by the X Corps to seize the entire Punchbowl.\r\nAlong with other X Corps divisions, the Marines attacked on 31\r\nAugust. They secured initial objectives, and then moved north to the\r\nSoyang River to seize additional designated objectives. Following the\r\nbitter action in the Punchbowl area, the Marines were involved in\r\nconsolidating and improving their defenses.\r\n\r\nAs the battle lines became comparatively stabilized in 1951, the enemy\r\nbegan to develop his AA defenses to peak efficiency. Marine pilots\r\nengaged in CAS, observation, interdiction, and armed reconnaissance\r\nmissions began to encounter accurate and intense ground fire.[574]\r\nAircraft losses increased, and with them, the number of USMC aviators\r\nwho fell into enemy hands. More than half of the Marine POWs taken\r\nduring the year--18 of 31--were on 1st MAW station lists. Captive\r\nairmen represented VMF-323, VMF(N)-513, Hedron MAG-33 (Headquarters\r\nSquadron 33), VMO-6, VMF-312, VMF-311, and VMA-121.\r\n\r\n    [574] One Marine who had conducted volunteer AAA reconnaissance\r\n          missions over North Korea was Lieutenant Colonel Charles\r\n          W. May, CO of the 1st 90mm AAAGunBn. In December 1951\r\n          he was lost in such a mission--the same flight in which\r\n          Lieutenant Colonel Thrash, of VMA-121, was captured.\r\n          MajGen A. F. Binney ltr to Hd, HistBr, G-3 Div, HQMC, dtd\r\n          14 Sep 66.\r\n\r\nThe year 1952, like 1950, saw a large number of Marines taken into\r\nhostile custody--a total of 70. As the year began, CCF and UNC ground\r\nforces had settled down to a bunker warfare system often compared to\r\nthe trench warfare of World War I. Air activity remained much as it\r\nhad the preceding year. Air losses decreased, however, with only 11\r\npilots becoming POWs, in contrast to the 59 infantry Marines captured.\r\nIn March, the 1st Marine Division moved from the X Corps zone of\r\naction on the east-central front to the I Corps western coastal flank.\r\nHere the Marines encountered “steadily increasing aggressiveness as\r\nthe enemy launched larger and more frequent attacks against outpost\r\npositions.”[575] Probes, patrol actions, and aggressive defense of the\r\nMLR and its outposts took their toll.\r\n\r\n    [575] MacDonald, _POW_, p. 139.\r\n\r\nEnemy pressure reached its height in October, when 41 Marine\r\ninfantrymen were seized, the second highest number taken in any month\r\nduring the war. In the COPs Detroit and Frisco defense of 6–7 October,\r\nthe 7th Marines listed 22 MIA, of whom 13 became POWs, practically all\r\nof them being wounded prior to capture. On 26 October, the Communists\r\nlunged at 7th Marines COPs Ronson and Warsaw, adjacent to the main\r\nbattle position, the Hook. In the ensuing action, 27 Marines were\r\n“marched, carried, or dragged off the hill and taken into the Chinese\r\nlines.”[576] Surprisingly, all 27 were recovered alive in the prisoner\r\nexchanges the following year.\r\n\r\n    [576] _Ibid._, p. 149.\r\n\r\nOf the 11 Marine airmen who became statistics on a POW list in 1952, 4\r\nwere shot down in an ill-fated 10-day period beginning 6 May. Again,\r\nall-too-accurate hostile AA fire was the villain. In similar incidents\r\nduring the year, two Marines engaged in “good Samaritan” aerial\r\nactivities became POWs for their efforts. In February, First Lieutenant\r\nKenneth W. Henry, an AO assigned to the Marine detachment aboard the\r\nlight cruiser USS _Manchester_, and Lieutenant Edwin C. Moore, USN,\r\nwhirled off in the cruiser’s HO3S to attempt rescue of a downed Navy\r\nfighter pilot, Ensign Marvin Broomhead. In the bright early afternoon,\r\nas Henry was maneuvering the helicopter sling, their ship suddenly\r\ncrashed--apparently from enemy machine gun fire intended for a combat\r\nair patrol operating in the vicinity. Two of the three men--Broomhead\r\nand Henry--were injured, but managed to drag themselves to a hidden\r\nposition and waited to be rescued. Instead, they were discovered\r\nshortly before midnight by a Chinese patrol.\r\n\r\nA similar mishap occurred on 16 May to First Lieutenant Duke Williams,\r\nJr., of VMF-212. Searching for a crashed pilot, his plane was struck by\r\nAA and he managed to jump. His parachute blossomed down into the midst\r\nof 15 waiting Koreans who had gathered to take him prisoner.\r\n\r\nDuring the last seven months of hostilities in Korea, from January-July\r\n1953, 41 Marines were captured. These included a VMO-6 pilot and air\r\nobserver in the little OE-1 spotting planes shot down in two separate\r\nincidents, plus 39 ground Marines trapped in the vicious outpost\r\nstruggles of March and July. Except for two Marines who died, the rest\r\nwere freed a few months after their capture during Operation BIG SWITCH.\r\n\r\nSummarizing it another way, of the 221 Marines captured during the\r\nthree-year conflict:\r\n\r\n  -- 49 were officers and 172 enlisted;\r\n  -- 190 were ground personnel and 31 aviators;\r\n  -- of the 190 ground troops, 19 were officers and 171 enlisted;\r\n  -- of the 31 aviators, 30 were officer pilots and 1 was enlisted.\r\n\r\nThe 7th Marines, which was the unit on line at the time of several\r\nmajor CCF attacks, had the highest number of POWs in the division.\r\nA total of 70 men, or 59.3 percent[577] of the 118 infantry Marines\r\ntaken, were from the 7th. The record during this 1950–1953 period for\r\nthe others is as follows: 1st Marines, 15 POWs; 5th Marines, 33; and\r\nthe division artillery regiment, the 11th Marines, 14. Six pilots from\r\nMarine Fighter Squadron 312 found themselves unwilling guests in North\r\nKorea. Four other units--VMO-6, VMF-323, VMF-311, and VMF(N)-513--each\r\nhad five members who served out the rest of the war as POWs.\r\n\r\n    [577] Recapitulation of facts from MacDonald, _POW_, pp.\r\n          260–269 and _passim_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Communist POW Camps_[578]\r\n\r\n    [578] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: MacDonald, _POW_; Montross, Kuokka,\r\n          and Hicks, _USMC Ops Korea--East-Central Front_, v. IV;\r\n          Barclay, _Commonwealth_; Fehrenbach, _Kind of War_;\r\n          Leckie, _Conflict_; Rees, _Korea_.\r\n\r\nThe Communist POW camp system, under Chinese direction, began in late\r\nDecember 1950. Marines captured in November and December, along with\r\nU.S. Army troops, British Commandos, and other Allied personnel,\r\nwere forced-marched north to Kanggye, not far from the Manchurian\r\nborder.[579] In the bitter cold, while winter howled through North\r\nKorea, the column of prisoners limped its way to its final destination,\r\narriving the day after Christmas. Several of the group, including\r\nMarines, perished during the four-day march--victims of malnutrition,\r\nuntreated combat wounds, pneumonia, the stinging, freezing wind,\r\nand subzero temperatures. Usually, “the Communists moved them [the\r\nprisoners] by night, because they feared the United Nations air power\r\nwhich ... ranged over the whole of North Korea.”[580]\r\n\r\n    [579] Although some American prisoners were taken in the summer\r\n          of 1950, it was not until the late autumn that large\r\n          numbers of men taken in several major engagements created\r\n          a need for a permanent prison-camp system. Rees, _Korea_,\r\n          p. 330.\r\n\r\n    [580] Fehrenbach, _Kind of War_, pp. 423–424.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three months of 1951, a network of POW camps was\r\ndeveloped along the southern shores of the Yalu River. Occupants of\r\nthe forlorn villages were evacuated, and newly captured UNC prisoners\r\nmoved in. The main camp operation at this time was in the Kanggye area.\r\nThis was a temporary indoctrination center established in October\r\n1950 before the development of regular POW camps. (For various CCF\r\ncamp locations, see Map 34.) Ultimately a group of a half dozen or so\r\npermanent camps were developed northeast of Sinuiju, along a 75-mile\r\nstretch of the Yalu.\r\n\r\nBy early 1951, Major McLaughlin, a captured Marine staff officer\r\npreviously attached to X Corps, was senior officer among the Kanggye\r\nprisoners which included a heterogeneous collection of U.S. 7th\r\nDivision soldiers, U.S. Marines, 18 Royal Marine Commandos, and Navy\r\nhospitalmen. UN personnel were scattered throughout several farmhouses,\r\nwith no attempt made to segregate the enlisted and officers. The\r\nChinese designated prisoner squads of 8–12 men, depending on the size\r\nof the room to which they were assigned. CCF-appointed squad leaders\r\nwere those prisoners who appeared more cooperative.\r\n\r\nIn direct opposition to orders, Major McLaughlin set about establishing\r\ncommunication between the small scattered POW groups, despite\r\never-present surveillance. He tried to achieve effective control of\r\nthe POWs so that a united front of resistance against the enemy could\r\nbe maintained. At mass indoctrination meetings, held regularly every\r\nfew days, the Marine officer issued instructions to enlisted personnel\r\nthrough five Marine noncommissioned officers. As one ex-prisoner\r\nrecalled, the “cold, smoke-filled barn was the locale for wide-spread\r\nexchange of information between the many little groups.”[581] Daily\r\nroutine at Kanggye stressed study and political indoctrination. Squad\r\nleaders were responsible for lectures and discussions on assigned\r\ntopics in Marxian dialectical materialism. The curriculum was more\r\nintense than most college courses. On the other hand, physical\r\ntreatment of inmates--except for chronic malnutrition and grossly\r\ninadequate medical care--at Kanggye was less brutal than at most of the\r\nother prisoner compounds.\r\n\r\n    [581] MacDonald, _POW_, p. 63.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 34      K. White\r\n\r\nPOW CAMPS IN WHICH MARINES WERE HELD]\r\n\r\nInterrogations went hand-in-hand with indoctrination. Prisoners were\r\ngrilled regularly on order of battle, close air support, naval gunfire\r\nmethods, UN aircraft, weapons, unit locations, and other tactical\r\ninformation. The Chinese were even more interested in the life\r\nhistories and biographical data of their captives. POWs were required\r\nto answer “economic questionnaires” and at frequent intervals compelled\r\nto write elaborate self-criticisms of their political attitudes and\r\nclass backgrounds. The CCF were satisfied only when prisoners--whose\r\noriginal truthful answers had been rejected--revised their own family\r\nstatus and income statistics downward. POWs, being interrogated, often\r\nfound the Chinese arguing with them over such far-away matters as the\r\nprisoner’s parents or his own family annual income and social level.\r\n\r\nIn March 1951, after an indoctrination period of about eight weeks, the\r\nKanggye POWs were transferred, and the camp itself was later abandoned.\r\nThe officers were relocated at Camp 5, Pyoktong, while the majority\r\ncontinued the march westward to the newly opened Camp 1, at Chongsong.\r\n\r\nDespite its numerical designation as Camp 5, the Pyoktong compound had\r\nbeen organized two months earlier and was the first of the permanent\r\nCCF centers. It became the headquarters of the entire prison-camp\r\nsystem. Approximately 2,000 UNC prisoners were interned here by the\r\nearly part of the year. They were housed in native huts. New inmates\r\narrived regularly from temporary collection centers in the south, where\r\nthey had been held for months. Sometimes they were marched to the Yalu\r\nduring the Korean winter while still wearing their summer fatigues.\r\nPyoktong offered little chance for escape. The compound, situated on a\r\nbarren peninsula that jutted out into the Yalu Reservoir, was so secure\r\nthat the Communists did not even surround it with barbed wire or employ\r\nsearchlights. It was hemmed in on three sides by fast water currents,\r\nwhile the one exit from the peninsula was closely guarded.\r\n\r\nConditions were far more severe here than at Kanggye. A starvation diet\r\nand complete lack of medical care quickly had their inevitable effect.\r\nPneumonia, dysentery, and malnutrition were rampant. The basic diet of\r\nboiled corn or millet resulted in associated deficiency diseases, such\r\nas beriberi and pellagra. Between 20 and 30 prisoners died daily. Many\r\nexperts, nonetheless, felt that “if the Chinese during the winter of\r\n1950–51 killed their prisoners by deliberate neglect, the North Koreans\r\nwho had handled the captives before they became primarily a Chinese\r\nresponsibility killed them by calculated brutality.”[582]\r\n\r\n    [582] Rees, _Korea_, p. 330.\r\n\r\nAlthough now junior to some Army and Air Force officers, Major\r\nMcLaughlin was elected by his fellow officer-prisoners to represent\r\nthem. Recognized by the Chinese as a staunch non-cooperative and\r\ndedicated trouble-maker, the enemy concentrated their pressure on the\r\nMarine officer--and he was subjected to intimidation, maltreatment, and\r\nthreats of death.\r\n\r\nAs they had at Kanggye, the CCF attempted to organize progressive\r\ngroups to write peace appeals, propaganda leaflets, and articles\r\ncondemning the United States for the war. Typically, progressive\r\nPOWs (usually weaker, less resilient members) who went along with\r\nthe Communist propaganda conditioning, received better rations and\r\ntreatment. Rugged resisters, on the other hand, could dependably expect\r\nto stand a considerable amount of solitary confinement, usually in an\r\nunspeakably foul, vermin-infested “hole.” Here a POW was forced to\r\nremain in a debilitating, crouched position usually 56 hours or more.\r\nThroughout the war a good many Marines were to know this particular\r\nenemy treatment. One Marine artilleryman, Second Lieutenant Roland L.\r\nMcDaniel, tied to a Korean POW in the hole for 10 days, emerged with\r\npneumonia and tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the POW compounds at Pyoktong and Chongsong, other sites\r\nwhere Marines were held were Camp 3, at Changsong (nearby and with a\r\nnearly identical name to Camp 1), primarily for enlisted personnel, and\r\nat “The Valley.” This was a temporary medical processing center in the\r\nKanggye area. Marine inmates here were often confined to a pig pen.\r\nLargely because of the filthy conditions of this camp, the death rate\r\nquickly earned the Valley the opprobrious name of Death Valley.\r\n\r\nAnother cluster of POW camps was located further south. These were\r\nprimarily run by the North Koreans, and were transit camps where\r\nprisoners were collected and interrogated before being moved north\r\nby truck or on foot to the permanent establishments. Among them were\r\ncollection centers at Kung Dong and Chorwon, and Camp 10, south of the\r\nNorth Korean Capital Pyongyang. The latter was also known variously\r\nas the Mining Camp, the Gold Mine, or Bean Camp--this due to its\r\nprevailing diet. At this southernmost Communist camp, POWs were\r\nrequired to dig coal in the nearby mine shafts. Loads of coal were then\r\nhauled in small hand carts over icy roads to the camp, a task made more\r\ndifficult by the prisoners’ skimpy mealtime fare.\r\n\r\nThe most notorious of all the camps, however, was Pak’s Palace,[583]\r\nthe interrogation center near Pyongyang. POWs also called it Pak’s\r\nDeath Palace for its chief interrogator, a sadistic North Korean\r\nofficer, Major Pak. Captain Martelli, a F4U fighter pilot from VMF-323\r\nshot down in April 1951, was the first Marine processed through Pak’s,\r\nwhere POWs were continuously threatened and beaten with little or no\r\nprovocation. Another Marine aviator, Captain Gerald Fink, VMF-312,\r\nupon being asked during interrogation here why he had come to Korea\r\nwon a sentence of several days solitary confinement in the hole for\r\nhis forthright answer: “to kill Communists.” Second Lieutenant Carl\r\nR. Lindquist, also of VMF-312, was the only one of 18 Marine officers\r\ncaptured in 1951 not processed through Pak’s before being sent north.\r\n\r\n    [583] The Secretary of Defense Advisory Committee on Prisoners\r\n          of War later adjudged Pak’s to have been “the worst camp\r\n          endured by American POWs in Korea.” MacDonald, _POW_, p.\r\n          104.\r\n\r\nGradually the Chinese developed the policy of segregating officer and\r\nenlisted personnel. Commenting on this procedure, one British observer\r\noffered the following:\r\n\r\n  By this means the lower ranks were deprived of their leaders\r\n  and for a short time this had a depressing, and generally bad,\r\n  effect. It was not long, however, before the natural leaders\r\n  among the rank and file asserted themselves. The standard of\r\n  leadership naturally varied in different compounds; but in all\r\n  there was some organization and in some it was highly efficient.\r\n  It was ... the policy of the Chinese ... to discourage the\r\n  emergence of thrustful leaders.... Consequently, clandestine\r\n  rather than open leadership was usual.[584]\r\n\r\n    [584] Barclay, _Commonwealth_, p. 190.\r\n\r\nBy midyear, noncommissioned officers were also separated from the\r\nenlisted men, in an attempt to better control prisoners. In October\r\nof 1951 another one of the Yalu River Camps was set up. This was Camp\r\n2, at Pi-chong-ni, which thereafter served as the main officers camp.\r\nThe next month a POW column of nearly 50 men, including 6 Marines, left\r\nKung Dong for these northern camps on a death march that covered 225\r\nmiles in two weeks. During the excruciating march, prisoners had been\r\nforced to strip naked and wade across the Chongsong River, a procedure\r\nwhich caused several deaths and cases of frostbite. One British\r\nparticipant, however, recalled that the “Marines banded together during\r\nthe terrible march, and the Royal Marines were drawn close to the U.S.\r\nMarines.”[585]\r\n\r\n    [585] MacDonald, _POW_, p. 127.\r\n\r\nIn December 1951 the Communist and UNC forces exchanged lists of\r\ncaptured personnel. The list of 3,198 American POWs (total UNC: 11,559)\r\nrevealed that 61 Marines were in enemy hands. Nine others, captured\r\nlate in the year, were still in temporary collection points and thus\r\nnot listed. Although Marines represented only a small portion of the\r\ntotal POWs, they were present in most of the nearly dozen regular camps\r\nor collection points then in existence. In any event the 1951 POW\r\nlist[586] gave a picture of the growing Communist camp system.\r\n\r\n    [586] Negotiations broke down at this point. No other list was\r\n          offered by Communist officials until the first exchange\r\n          of wounded POWs, 17 months later, in the April 1953\r\n          LITTLE SWITCH operation. Montross, Kuokka, and Hicks,\r\n          _USMC Ops Korea_, v. IV, p. 223.\r\n\r\nAs 1951 was drawing to an end, the Camp 2 commandant, a fanatical\r\nCommunist named Ding, ordered UNC prisoners to prepare and send\r\na New Year’s greeting to the commander of the CCF, General Peng\r\nTeh-huai. Senior UN officer, Lieutenant Colonel Gerald Brown, USAF,\r\nwas determined that the prisoners would not sign the spurious holiday\r\nmessage. Major McLaughlin voluntarily organized Marine resistance, and\r\nsenior officers of other nationality groups followed suit. No greetings\r\nwere sent. As usually happened, an informer reported the organized\r\nresistance and furnished names of the reactionary leaders. The\r\nfollowing month, the six ranking officers were sentenced to solitary\r\nconfinement, ranging from three to six months, for their “subversive\r\nactivities.”\r\n\r\nThe episode marked the first really organized resistance to the\r\nChinese. “Although the principals were subjected to months of solitary\r\nconfinement, coercion, torture, and very limited rations during the\r\nbitterly cold months of early 1952, their joint effort laid the\r\nfoundation for comparatively effective resistance within Camp 2 during\r\nthe remainder of the war.”[587]\r\n\r\n    [587] MacDonald, _POW_, p. 138.\r\n\r\nIn January 1952, Major McLaughlin and the other five officers were\r\nremoved to begin their long tours of solitary confinement. Although the\r\nremaining Marine officers at Pi-chong-ni had “formed a tightly knit\r\ngroup and consulted among themselves on every major issue,”[588] the\r\natmosphere within the camp itself became highly charged and strained.\r\nSuspicion of informers and opportunists was rampant. The officers at\r\nCamp 2 were generally agreed that Marine Lieutenant Colonel Thrash,\r\nwho arrived in June, was largely responsible for restoring discipline.\r\nHe issued an all-inclusive order about camp behavior for all personnel\r\nwhich read, in part:\r\n\r\n    [588] _Ibid._, p. 164.\r\n\r\n  Study of Communist propaganda would not be countenanced. If study\r\n  was forced on them, POWs were to offer passive resistance and no\r\n  arguments.\r\n\r\n  If prisoners were subject to trial or punishment they were to\r\n  involve no one but themselves.\r\n\r\n  There would be no letters written using any titles or return\r\n  address which might prove beneficial to the Communists for\r\n  propaganda value.[589]\r\n\r\n    [589] _Ibid._, pp. 165–166.\r\n\r\nExpectedly, it was not long before Lieutenant Colonel Thrash’s efforts\r\nto influence and organize his fellow officers outraged CCF officials.\r\nIn September he was removed from the compound, charged with “Criminal\r\nActs and Hostile Attitude against the Chinese People’s Volunteers.”\r\nThe Marine airman spent the next eight months in solitary. Here he\r\nwas subjected to constant interrogation, harassment, and duress. On\r\none occasion he was bound, severely beaten, and thrown outside half\r\nnaked in sub-zero weather. Shock of the severe temperature rendered\r\nhim unconscious, and he nearly died. Throughout his eight-month ordeal\r\nthere were demands that he cooperate with the “lenient” Chinese upon\r\nhis return to the compound.\r\n\r\nDuring 1952, the Communists developed the system of keeping\r\nnewly-captured Marines (and other UNC troops) apart from those taken\r\nprior to January 1952 who had suffered more brutal treatment. Beginning\r\nin August, noncommissioned officers were also segregated. They were\r\nremoved from Chongsong (Camp 1) and taken further north along the Yalu\r\nto the “Sergeants Camp” (Camp 4) at Wiwon. Although a few Marines had\r\nbeen interned at the Camp 2 Annex, at Obul, from late 1951 on, they\r\nwere not sent there in any sizable number until mid-1952.\r\n\r\nAdjacent to a steeply-walled valley, the Obul camp was also known as\r\n“No Name Valley.” Although the inmates of the annex were aware of\r\nother POWs in the main compound and throughout the valley, they were\r\nunder heavy guard to prevent contact between the groups. An Air Force\r\nofficer, the senior member, and Major Harris, the ranking Marine,\r\nwent about organizing the prisoners in a military manner. In order to\r\nexchange information, notes were hidden under rocks at common bathing\r\npoints or latrines. Messages were baked in bread by POWs on kitchen\r\ndetail, and songs were loudly sung to convey information. Hospitalized\r\nPOWs, meanwhile, were held at the Pyoktong (Camp 5) hospital or, in the\r\nsouthern sector, at a second hospital a few miles north of Pyongyang.\r\nOther locations where prisoners were confined in 1952 were “Pike’s\r\nPeak,” also in the same general southern area, and the Manpo Camp on\r\nthe Yalu.\r\n\r\nFor POWs incarcerated behind the bamboo curtain, 1952 marked several\r\nother developments. It was the year that American airmen began to\r\nreceive special grilling and threats from their Communist captors. This\r\nwas in connection with the germ warfare hoax, to be discussed later.\r\nIt was also the year that Marine POWs at Pi-chong-ni (Camp 2) observed\r\ntheir own traditional 10 November Marine Corps birthday ceremony.\r\nEggs, sugar, and flour were stolen for a cake surreptitiously baked\r\nand suitably decorated with the Marine Corps globe and anchor. Another\r\ngroup accomplished the task of bootlegging rice wine. When the special\r\ndate arrived, the Marine officers toasted the President, Commandant,\r\nand Marine Corps and spiritedly sang the National Anthem and Marine\r\nCorps hymn. One of the invited guests, Quartermaster Sergeant James Day\r\nof the Royal Marines, later recalled the reaction of other prisoners:\r\n\r\n  Firstly some were apprehensive in case of trouble with the\r\n  Chinese, and its always consequent rash of gaol [jail] victims.\r\n  Some thought it a little childish, and not worth the trouble\r\n  of interrupting the daily routine of the place. And I feel\r\n  that quite a lot were rather envious that the small band of\r\n  USMC should be able to get together and do this sort of thing\r\n  quite seriously, quite sincerely, and with no thought of any\r\n  consequence.[590]\r\n\r\n    [590] _Ibid._, p. 190.\r\n\r\nThis same month the Chinese staged a “Prisoner of War Command Olympics”\r\nat Pyoktong. Although most Marines opposed the idea of participation\r\nin the event, because of its inevitable propaganda exploitation by\r\nthe CCF, the decision rendered by the senior UN officer was that POW\r\nathletes would be represented. Much improved quality food was served\r\nfor the occasion, Communist photographers were everywhere, and a CCF\r\npropaganda brochure (with articles written by POW turncoats) was later\r\ndistributed in Geneva purportedly to show the healthy recreational\r\nactivities available to UNC prisoners. An Air force pilot, in\r\ndescribing the performance of Major McLaughlin, noted that “his skill\r\nas an athlete helped restore the prestige of the officers torn down by\r\nthe enemy’s propaganda.”[591]\r\n\r\n    [591] _Ibid._, p. 195.\r\n\r\nMore important, he defied the guards by deliberately circulating\r\namong the enlisted men (often younger, impressionable, less mature\r\nindividuals) to point out lies in enemy propaganda tactics designed to\r\nslander the U.S. government and its leaders. The Marine officer also\r\ncollected names of American POWs held in isolated places who it was\r\nsuspected the enemy might attempt to hold as hostages at the end of the\r\nwar--possibly as a bargaining tool for the granting of a seat to Red\r\nChina in the UN.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year of the war although a number of prisoners were\r\nstill being captured in some of the most savage attacks unleashed by\r\nthe enemy, the lot of the average POW had improved. More attention\r\nwas being paid to the former pitiful medical care. The men were more\r\nwarmly clad, even though still huddled into filthy, crowded huts. And\r\nthe monotonous poor chow had improved. Most POWs, although carefully\r\nkept from learning developments of the outside world, naturally\r\nsuspected that some reason lay behind the changes. And so there was:\r\nthe Communists had no desire to repatriate skeletonized prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CCF “Lenient Policy” and Indoctrination Attempts_[592]\r\n\r\n    [592] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: MacDonald, _POW_; Barclay, _Commonwealth_;\r\n          Clark, _Danube to Yalu_; Fehrenbach, _Kind of War_;\r\n          Leckie, _Conflict_; Rees, _Korea_.\r\n\r\nAs early in the war as July 1951, the CCF was seeking propaganda\r\nbenefits out of its so-called “lenient” policy toward captured\r\nUnited Nations personnel. Basically, this could be described as\r\n“calculated leniency in return for cooperation, harassment in return\r\nfor neutrality, and brutality in return for resistance.”[593] Others\r\nhave characterized the CCF psychological techniques of indoctrination\r\nas monotonous and single-minded “repetition, harassment and\r\nhumiliation.”[594]\r\n\r\n    [593] MacDonald, _POW_, p. 61. One former Marine POW commented:\r\n          “The ‘lenient policy’ applied to the ‘liberated\r\n          soldiers,’ who had supposedly been ‘liberated’ from the\r\n          American capitalists by the Chinese People’s Volunteers.\r\n          Unless a prisoner accepted this absurd concept, he was a\r\n          ‘war criminal’ and subject to being treated as such. The\r\n          North Vietnamese use this same characterization (‘war\r\n          criminal’) in reference to U.S. POWs when queried by\r\n          U.S. representatives at the Paris talks.” MajGen John N.\r\n          McLaughlin ltr to Dir, MCHist, HQMC, dtd 17 Jul 70.\r\n\r\n    [594] Rees, _Korea_, p. 337.\r\n\r\nIn some respects, it is true that the Chinese treatment of prisoners\r\nappeared to be more humane than that of the North Koreans. The latter\r\nfreely used physical cruelty and torture, to the point of being\r\nbarbaric.[595] Sometimes it appeared that Allied POWs did not receive\r\nany harsher treatment from the CCF than did local civilian prisoners.\r\n\r\n    [595] There were, for example, instances when POW columns were\r\n          being marched north and the NKPA treatment was so rough\r\n          that “Chinese guards intervened to protect the prisoners\r\n          from the North Koreans.” MacDonald, _POW_, p. 43.\r\n\r\nWhereas the NKPA regularly resorted to physical brutality, the Chinese\r\n“introduced a more insidious form of cruelty.”[596] Although they\r\nused physical violence less often, it was usually more purposeful and\r\ncombined with deliberate mental pressure. CCF officials announced that\r\ntreatment of captives would be “fair and lenient,” but that wrongdoers\r\nwould be publicly punished. Usually this CCF punishment took the form\r\nof less drastic methods--solitary confinement, prolonged interrogation,\r\nand a reduced diet. Even under this decreed lenient policy, however, no\r\nrelief parcels were delivered to POWs, nor were any neutral observers\r\never allowed to inspect the prison camps.\r\n\r\n    [596] _Ibid._, p. 60.\r\n\r\nIn any event, the Chinese were considerably more effective than\r\nthe NKPA in their intelligence activities. Often their skilled\r\ninterrogators were officers who spoke excellent English. Occasionally,\r\nthey had even attended such U.S. schools as the University of Chicago\r\nand had considerable insight into American psychology, customs, and\r\nvalues--even slang. Interrogation sessions usually employed recording\r\ndevices and sometimes were further equipped with one-way mirrors. One\r\nMarine, subjected to frequent interrogation, was kept awake by the\r\nChinese who slapped his face and blew smoke in his eyes.\r\n\r\nFrom early 1951 to the end of the war UNC prisoners were subjected to\r\na systematic attempt at mass conversion to Communism. This intensive\r\nindoctrination effort--like the riots of Communist prisoners in Allied\r\nPOW camps and the CCF germ warfare fabrications--was designed to gain\r\na propaganda advantage. From highest-ranking officer to lowly private,\r\nno one was immune to this thought-reform process. General Dean,\r\nprize Communist captive, who was subject to three years of intense\r\nMarxist-Leninist indoctrination, upon his release commented wryly, “I’m\r\nan authority now on the history of the Communist Party and much of its\r\ndoctrine.”[597]\r\n\r\n    [597] Rees, _Korea_, p. 334.\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking POWs, both American and British, particularly became\r\nthe target for Communist thought-control conditioning. Many experts\r\nhave discussed glowingly the superb example and iron discipline--both\r\non the battlefield and in POW camp--displayed by the Turkish soldiers.\r\nThis is true, and their outstanding performance is to their credit\r\nas a national group. The fact remains, however, that the Turks were\r\nlong-term professional soldiers. Usually they were left alone by\r\nthe Communists who neither spoke their language nor needed them for\r\npropaganda purposes. As a rule all non-American troops of the United\r\nNations received better treatment than American and British personnel.\r\n\r\nThe basic tenet of the Communist party line was that this aggressive\r\nwar against the peace-loving people of Korea had been caused by\r\nAmerican imperialists seeking additional foreign markets. All UNC\r\nsoldiers were, therefore, by simple definition war criminals who\r\ndeserved no better treatment than death. But as most UN soldiers\r\nwere misguided and misled by their capitalist rulers they would “not\r\nbe shot if they admitted their mistakes and showed themselves to be\r\nprogressive”[598] by becoming properly indoctrinated.\r\n\r\n    [598] _Ibid._, p. 335.\r\n\r\nOften, the thought-reform processing started long before prisoners\r\nreached their permanent camps, while they were under initial\r\ninterrogation in the transit collection center. Captain Samuel J.\r\nDavies, Anglican Chaplain of the British Gloucestershire Regiment,[599]\r\nnoted that lecture subjects presented to his officer group at one\r\nNorth Korean temporary collection center included:\r\n\r\n  Corruption of the UN by the American warmongers;\r\n  The Chinese Peoples’ right to Formosa;\r\n  The Stockholm Peace Appeal;\r\n  Progress in Peoples’ China;\r\n  Churchill, tool of the Truman-MacArthur-Dulles Fascist clique;\r\n  The Soviet Union heads the World Peace Camp.[600]\r\n\r\n    [599] Davies was the only one of the four captured UNC\r\n          chaplains who survived the war. During his imprisonment,\r\n          he visited hospitalized POWs at the makeshift hospital\r\n          near Camp 2 and held weekly community services. Another\r\n          well-remembered chaplain was Captain Emil J. Kapaun,\r\n          Chaplains Corps, USA. The Catholic priest stole food\r\n          and sneaked into the enlisted compounds at Camp 5 to\r\n          distribute it. His heroic behavior and selfless interest\r\n          in his fellow-men were an inspiration to fellow POWs.\r\n          MacDonald, _POW_, pp. 77, 136.\r\n\r\n    [600] Rees, _Korea_, p. 336.\r\n\r\nSystematically the enemy ground away at theory and practice of\r\nCommunism, with its superiority to American democracy. From emphasis on\r\nthe Korean War as imperialist aggression, the programmed thinking then\r\ndealt with shortcomings of western countries (particularly Southern\r\nlynchings, poor treatment of Negroes, and colonialism) to the idyllic\r\nsocialism in people’s democracies where “everyone is equal.” “Together\r\nwith the emotional pressures involved, this dramatic presentation of\r\nMarxism-Leninism to prisoners who often not only failed to comprehend\r\nwhy they had fought in Korea, but even the rudiments of democracy\r\nitself, was bound to have some sort of effect.”[601]\r\n\r\n    [601] _Ibid._, p. 337.\r\n\r\nCompulsory lectures and discussions often went on until 2200. Together\r\nwith the unceasing indoctrination efforts, the CCF attempted to\r\nmaintain complete control over every aspect of POW life. Each camp was\r\ndivided into POW companies (ranging from 60 to 300 men), platoons, and\r\nsquads. Squad leaders, appointed by the Chinese, reported regularly\r\nto authorities the opinions of men in their group. “Converted”\r\nprogressives were responsible for much of the internal policing.\r\nEvery prisoner with reactionary tendencies was isolated. The varied\r\npressures of hunger, fear, constant threats of torture, coercion,\r\nnonrepatriation, anxiety, and guilt[602] were used to break him down.\r\n\r\n    [602] Some analysts have pointed out that the Lenient Policy\r\n          with its “emphasis on confession and repentance, and\r\n          its propaganda exploitation” closely resembled POW\r\n          indoctrination tactics developed by the Russians with\r\n          their German prisoners in World War II. Rees, _Korea_, p.\r\n          338.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to convert the Marines and other prisoners to their\r\nown beliefs, the Communists prohibited the use of the term “prisoner\r\nof war.” Instead they used the phrase “newly liberated friends” and\r\ninsisted the POWs do likewise. They also denounced religion as a\r\nsuperstition and device for controlling people’s minds. Curiously, POWs\r\nwere often permitted to retain whatever religious articles they had on\r\nthem when captured, so that Bibles, rosaries, etc., were available for\r\nsquad groups that sought to hold informal religious discussions and\r\nreadings. Such religious expression was, of course, strictly forbidden.\r\nIt might be noted here that Marines, as a group, did not appear to be\r\nany more or less interested in religious services than other POWs.\r\n\r\nBy mid-1952 the compulsory lectures were considered a failure, and the\r\nemphasis shifted to “voluntary” study groups led by progressives. More\r\ninsidious methods of indoctrination were being used--books, papers,\r\nand articles written by camp progressives. Personal interrogation and\r\nindoctrination had proved it could have a more powerful effect than\r\nattempts at mass conversion. Then, too, the Chinese had by this time\r\nperfected another propaganda tool that admirably suited their purposes.\r\nIt was to have even still more effective, far reaching results.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Germ Warfare Issue_[603]\r\n\r\n    [603] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: MacDonald, _POW_; Fehrenbach, _Kind of\r\n          War_; Leckie, _Conflict_; Rees, _Korea_.\r\n\r\nBesides their routine interrogations and indoctrinations, by 1952\r\nthe Communists had found a new angle to exploit. This was to have\r\nstrong repercussions on the treatment of some captured personnel. And,\r\nultimately, it was to affect American public reaction to the entire\r\nKorean War and to shake the nation’s confidence in some of its fighting\r\nmen who became POWs.\r\n\r\nThe germ warfare issue developed from an incident in January 1952\r\nwhen the Communists shot down a U.S. Air Force B-26 bomber. Several\r\nmonths later, in May, the enemy propaganda campaign moved into high\r\ngear when the navigator and pilot both purportedly confessed that they\r\ntook part in a raid in which germ bombs were dropped on North Korean\r\ntowns. After the CCF successfully extracted false confessions from the\r\ntwo USAF officers, the enemy exposed both prisoners to a select group\r\nof Oriental medical specialists and newspapermen. The two Americans\r\napparently performed according to plan, and a relentless flood of\r\nCommunist propaganda was unleashed on the world.\r\n\r\nWhile the allegation of bacteriological warfare was not new in the\r\nKorean War, it was not until 1952 that the Chinese successfully\r\nexploited it. After suffering their first reverses in Korea in\r\nSeptember 1950, the Communists charged that Americans were waging germ\r\nwarfare. Even after they regained the tactical initiative in late 1950\r\nthey continued their campaign of vilification. In early 1951, while\r\nthe UNC battled epidemics of smallpox, typhus, and amoebic dysentery\r\nprevalent among the civil population and within the POW camps, the CCF\r\nbranded medical efforts to curb the diseases as experiments in germ\r\nwarfare. A formal complaint was made by the CCF to the United Nations\r\nin May 1951; thereafter, the germ warfare charges lay dormant for the\r\nrest of the year.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the two airmen’s “confessions” in 1952 was far-reaching.\r\nFrom that time until the end of hostilities “captured aviators of\r\nall services were subjected to a degree of pressure and coercion\r\npreviously unknown by prisoners of war. Prior to the turn of the year\r\naviation and ground personnel received relatively the same treatment in\r\nCommunists’ hands. After January 1952, aviators were singled out for a\r\nspecial brand of treatment designed to wring bacteriological warfare\r\nconfessions from them.”[604] North Korean officials joined the CCF\r\nspokesmen in loudly denouncing American bacteriological attacks. As the\r\ncampaign gained momentum, an elaborate, cleverly-concocted “War Crimes\r\nExhibit” was set up in Peiping in May. Similar displays were later on\r\nview at the UNC officers’ camp at Pi-chong-ni, including hand-written\r\nand sound-recorded confessions by the two American pilots, as well as a\r\nconvincing array of photos depicting the lethal “bomb containers.”\r\n\r\n    [604] MacDonald, _POW_, p. 175.\r\n\r\nAll the while air personnel were being put under acute stress to\r\nconfess alleged war crimes. Captured Marine aviation personnel\r\nencountered this new subject in their interrogations. Lieutenant\r\nHenry, captured in February, was asked about germ warfare. Major\r\nJudson C. Richardson, of VMF(N)-513, during interrogations at Pak’s\r\nwas told he would never leave Korea when he denied that the U.S. was\r\nwaging bacteriological warfare. Master Sergeant John T. Cain, VMO-6,\r\na well-known Marine enlisted pilot whose plane was shot down in July\r\n1952, was questioned, confined to the hole, and taken before a firing\r\nsquad when he refused to acknowledge American participation. Captain\r\nFlynn was also subjected to intensive and brutal interrogation by\r\nNorth Korean and Chinese Communist Air Force personnel who sought a\r\nconfession. Others were to meet similar pressure and be questioned\r\nuntil their nerves shrieked.\r\n\r\nOn 8 July 1952, the first of a chain of events occurred that was\r\nto link the Marine Corps with the spurious bacteriological warfare\r\npropaganda. Colonel Frank H. Schwable, 1st MAW Chief of Staff and\r\nMajor Roy H. Bley, wing ordnance officer, were struck by Communist\r\nground fire while making a reconnaissance flight. The enemy had little\r\ndifficulty in compiling Colonel Schwable’s biography. Although he\r\nrepeatedly maintained he had just arrived in Korea and had not yet\r\nreceived an assignment, he was in uniform with insignia and full\r\npersonal identification. A Department of Defense press release issued\r\ntwo days later gave considerable data, correctly identifying him as the\r\nMarine Wing Chief of Staff. The Chinese knew they had a prize.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after his capture, the colonel was taken to an interrogation\r\ncenter where he remained in solitary confinement until December.\r\nHe quickly became aware of CCF intentions to utilize him for their\r\npropaganda mill. He was interrogated relentlessly, badgered, accused\r\nof being a war criminal, fed a near-starvation diet, denied proper\r\nlatrine privileges, refused medical and dental attention, and subjected\r\nto extremes of temperature. Ultimately the discomfort, almost constant\r\ndiarrhea, extreme pain from being forced to sit in unnatural positions,\r\nfatigue, and naked threats wore him down. At the same time he was\r\nalso convinced that had he continued to resist Communist demands for\r\na confession the enemy would have affixed his forged signature to a\r\ndocument to achieve their ends. He later commented:\r\n\r\n  In making my most difficult decision to seek the only way out, my\r\n  primary consideration was that I would be of greater value to my\r\n  country in exposing this hideous means of slanderous propaganda\r\n  than I would be by sacrificing my life through non-submission or\r\n  remaining a prisoner of the Chinese Communists for life, a matter\r\n  over which they left me no doubt.[605]\r\n\r\n    [605] _Ibid._, p. 180.\r\n\r\nGeneral Dean, held in solitary confinement for much of his three years’\r\ncaptivity, stated the greatest problem facing a prisoner of war is\r\n“maintaining his judgment--he has no one on whom he can try out his\r\nideas before turning them into decisions.”[606] Possibly this was also\r\nColonel Schwable’s problem. Many drafts of his confession were made\r\nbefore the Chinese were satisfied that specific details reinforced the\r\ninformation earlier obtained in other prisoners’ false statements.\r\nThe confession that finally evolved in December cleverly combined\r\nfactual order of battle data and technical terminology to create a\r\nmost convincing lie. It was more sophisticated than efforts of earlier\r\ncaptives and was, unquestionably, damaging.\r\n\r\n    [606] _Ibid._, p. 182.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Problems and Performance of Marine POWs_[607]\r\n\r\n    [607] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 10;\r\n          MacDonald, _POW_; Fehrenbach, _Kind of War_.\r\n\r\nProblems faced by Marine and other UNC prisoners ranged from the\r\nfundamentals of sheer survival to more abstract questions involving\r\nhonor and duty that have less sharply defined interpretations. Was it,\r\nfor instance, a prisoner’s duty to overtly resist the enemy at all\r\ncosts and on all possible occasions? Or was an attitude of passive\r\nresistance that created less hostility and attention better in the long\r\nrun? Were such passive techniques liable to render a POW unable to\r\ncontinue making fine distinctions in his conduct and behavior so that\r\nhe unwittingly went over the line to become a collaborator with the\r\nenemy? What about a ranking POW’s responsibility of leadership?\r\n\r\nIn a practical, day-in, day-out way, every prisoner had to decide for\r\nhimself as to how actively or passively he would resist the enemy. In\r\na number of cases Marine (and other Allied) POWs gave deliberately\r\nfalse or misleading information in response to threats, coercion,\r\nor maltreatment. Three Marines at Pak’s regularly held counsel “to\r\ndetermine their courses of action and to coordinate their false\r\nstories.”[608] Captain Fink’s list of ships, all sunk in World Wars I\r\nand II, was similar to the story told by an Air Force officer of the\r\nnew B-108 bomber (three B-36s).\r\n\r\n    [608] MacDonald, _POW_, p. 121.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently a POW faced threats of death, reduced rations, still\r\nworse medical care, solitary, or physical beatings and torture if he\r\nfailed to make some response to questions. Major Richardson finally\r\nwrote untruthful answers to five questions about the Navy, although his\r\nNKPA interrogators told him his lies were detected. Master Sergeant\r\nCain authored a fanciful report about the Fleet Logistic Wing, an\r\norganization about which he knew nothing, not too surprisingly since\r\nit did not exist. He later admitted, however, that he felt he’d “made\r\na mistake at that time [his first interrogation] by lying about\r\ninconsequential things.”[609]\r\n\r\n    [609] _Ibid._, p. 185.\r\n\r\nExpressed in simplistic terms, a spirit of cohesion and of group\r\nidentity seemed to be the key factor in--to use a bromide that is\r\nparticularly apt here--separating the men from the boys. Even when\r\navowed reactionary leaders were removed to serve one of their many\r\nsolitary tours, there seems little doubt that their example served to\r\ninstill a spirit of resistance (either open or underground) in fellow\r\nPOWs. This was particularly true when the leadership gap was filled by\r\nthe next senior man and the chain of command remained unbroken.\r\n\r\nPrisoners who were able to rise above their own personal situation\r\n(_i.e._, to adjust, without giving in) and to assist others seemed,\r\nunquestionably, to have gained greater resiliency and determination.\r\nWhether this is a cause-or-effect reaction, however, might be a grey\r\narea difficult to pinpoint precisely. In any event, glimpses of\r\nMarines from behind the barbed wire indicated that steadfastness under\r\npressure, ingenuity, and outstanding leadership earned them the respect\r\nof fellow prisoners as well as a place in Marine Corps history.\r\n\r\nEven in a situation as inhospitable and hazardous as a POW camp, it is\r\nnot surprising that characteristic behavior and certain distinctive\r\npersonality traits tend to show through, no matter what. Captain\r\nFink, captured early in the war, endured unspeakable humiliations at\r\nthe hands of the North Koreans. Although he felt his morale was at\r\nits lowest point at this time, and was not sure he could go on, he\r\nwas later responsible for providing a high degree of civility for\r\nPOWs confined to Camp 2. His most notable artistic and mechanical\r\nachievement was probably the construction of an artificial leg[610]\r\nfor USAF Major Thomas D. Harrison. This prosthetic was so expertly\r\nfashioned that its owner could play volley ball using his new limb!\r\nFink also built stethoscopes for POW doctors, using resonant wood and\r\ntubing stolen from Chinese trucks. After a discussion with other POWs\r\non the need for a religious symbol in camp, the resourceful Marine\r\nmade a 22-inch crucifix, christened “Christ in Barbed Wire.”[611] His\r\nefforts on behalf of religion earned him a 10-day sentence in the hole.\r\n\r\n    [610] A hollowed-out compartment of the leg was used to\r\n          hide written records on deaths, atrocities, and other\r\n          administrative data. Ultimately, the records were\r\n          brought back to the U.S. The Air Force officer was a\r\n          cousin, interestingly enough, of the chief Allied truce\r\n          negotiator, General Harrison. MacDonald, _POW_, p. 227,\r\n          and _Washington Post_, dtd 5 Aug 53, p. 1.\r\n\r\n    [611] The crucifix was brought back to freedom by Camp 2 POWs\r\n          and later placed in the Father Kapaun High School, in\r\n          Wichita, Kansas. MacDonald, _POW_, p. 172.\r\n\r\nCaptain Arthur Wagner, VMF(N)-513, spent an unusually long six-month\r\ntour at Pak’s during 1951. For new captives headed in that direction,\r\nthe word via USMC grapevine was that he “could be trusted.”[612]\r\nCaptain Wagner counselled other prisoners at Pak’s, helped chop wood,\r\ndraw water, cook, ease the burden of sick POWs, and resisted the\r\nCommunists at every turn.\r\n\r\n    [612] _Ibid._, p. 121.\r\n\r\nAnother member of the same squadron, Captain Flynn, had completed 59\r\ncombat missions against the enemy in North Korea before being shot\r\ndown in May 1952.[613] While captive, the veteran Marine fighter\r\npilot withstood intense interrogation, influenced others to suppress\r\nCCF-inspired talks made by progressives, and strengthened morale by\r\nplanning a group escape. He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment by a\r\nmock court. Throughout it all, according to Master Sergeant Cain, the\r\nPOWs “owed much to Flynn who kept them amused.”[614] First Lieutenant\r\nRobert J. Gillette’s “reactionary” attitude resulted in his being\r\nplaced in the hole on several occasions. Once, at No Name Valley, he\r\nmanaged to scribble a novel on toilet paper which subsequently provided\r\nsome light moments for fellow prisoners. And First Lieutenant Felix L.\r\nFerranto, 1st. Signal Battalion, spent more than two years of his 33\r\nmonths’ imprisonment in solitary confinement or isolated with small\r\nunits of “non-cooperative” POWs. The CCF pronounced him a “hopeless\r\ncapitalist, an organizer with an ‘unsincere attitude.’”[615]\r\n\r\n    [613] Parachuting from his burning plane after it was struck\r\n          by hostile AA fire, Captain Flynn duplicated an earlier\r\n          action from World War II. In July 1945 he had bailed out\r\n          of an aircraft similarly hit by fire while on a combat\r\n          patrol over Japan. Biog File, HRS, HistBr, G-3 Div, HQMC.\r\n\r\n    [614] MacDonald, _POW_, p. 185.\r\n\r\n    [615] _Ibid._, p. 122.\r\n\r\nThe type of amiable accommodation that could sometimes be made, without\r\ncompromising one’s standards, was once successfully demonstrated by\r\nCaptain Jack E. Perry, VMF-311 briefing officer. On a bombing run\r\nhis F9F fuel tank was hit, and he parachuted down. Seized almost\r\nimmediately by the Chinese, his captors “showed him bomb holes from\r\nnumerous strikes in the area, and they pointed out several wounded\r\nsoldiers. Then, as he describes it, ‘They laughed like hell.’ Although\r\nCaptain Perry failed to see anything funny, he laughed along with\r\nthem.’”[616]\r\n\r\n    [616] _Ibid._, p. 109.\r\n\r\nThree Marines captured during the Korean War had suffered a similar\r\nfate in World War II. Ironically, Staff Sergeant Charles L. Harrison,\r\nof the Military Police Company; Warrant Officer Felix J. McCool, of\r\n1st Service Battalion; and Master Sergeant Frederick J. Stumpges,\r\nHeadquarters Company, were all captured in the same 29 November 1950\r\naction. Comparisons of treatment by the Communists and Japanese were\r\ninevitable. A survivor of the Bataan Death March, Stumpges felt that\r\nalthough the Japanese confinement was more difficult physically,\r\nimprisonment in North Korea was a far worse mental ordeal. “They [the\r\nCommunists] were around all the time and you could never speak your\r\nmind.”[617]\r\n\r\n    [617] _New York Times_, dtd 30 Aug 53, p. 2.\r\n\r\nThe other two Marines similarly thought that the Japanese were more\r\nbrutal but had more character. Harrison, captured at Wake Island, said\r\nhe admired them because “they really believed in their cause and were\r\nloyal to it.”[618] The Chinese, on the other hand, he characterized as\r\nemploying “false friendship and deceit.”[619] McCool, who had spent 70\r\nhours in a slimy, lice-infested hole for refusing to confess to a phony\r\ncharge of rape and pillage, knew that he “hated the Chinese Communists\r\nfar more than he had hated the Japanese.”[620]\r\n\r\n    [618] MacDonald, _POW_, p. 79.\r\n\r\n    [619] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n    [620] _Ibid._, p. 167.\r\n\r\nMaster Sergeant Cain had distinguished himself by flying little OE\r\nreconnaissance planes 184 hours and had 76 combat missions in one\r\nmonth. Just before his capture, Cain had paid for six months’ education\r\nfor nine Korean youngsters who lived near his air base. Because of his\r\ngraying hair and lack of rank insignia, Sergeant Cain was mistaken for\r\na senior officer. In fact, the Chinese insisted that he was Lieutenant\r\nColonel Cain, CO of VMF-121. His equal amount of insistence that he\r\nwas not a Marine officer, plus his refusal to reveal any significant\r\ninformation, made him a particular nuisance to the CCF. He was\r\nsubjected to intensive interrogation sessions, confined to the hole,\r\nand stood at attention for periods of five to eight hours. Describing\r\nthe occasion on which he thought it was all over, Sergeant Cain related\r\nthat he:\r\n\r\n  ... was taken to a hillside, blindfolded, and placed in front of\r\n  a firing squad. He heard rifle bolts click. The commander of the\r\n  firing squad asked if he was ready to tell all.[621]\r\n\r\n    [621] _Ibid._, p. 186.\r\n\r\nWhen the Marine sergeant replied that he was not going to talk, the\r\nChinese returned him to solitary confinement. Eventually, after\r\nquestioning him for 84 days, the CCF gave up trying to indoctrinate\r\nhim in the ways of Communism. Major Harris, senior officer of the Obul\r\ncomplex, freely acknowledged that Sergeant Cain “assumed more than his\r\nshare of duties and responsibilities and set an example for all to\r\nfollow.”[622]\r\n\r\n    [622] _Ibid._, pp. 186–187.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marine Escape Attempts_[623]\r\n\r\n    [623] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: MacDonald, _POW_; Korean War casualty cards\r\n          from Statistical Unit, Casualty Section, HQMC.\r\n\r\nAs the Korean War came to a close, assessments were being made of\r\nAmerica’s role in it. Operation BIG SWITCH swung into high gear and\r\nnational attention focused on the returning POWs and their experiences\r\nin Communist camps. The widely-accepted statement was that no prisoners\r\nhad escaped. Even more discrediting was the prevailing belief that,\r\n“worse, not a single American attempted to escape from captivity.”[624]\r\nThese reported facts are not borne out by the actual record.\r\n\r\n    [624] Leckie, _Conflict_, p. 389.\r\n\r\nIn May 1951, a group of 18 Marines and a U.S. Army interpreter found\r\ntheir way back to American control through a combination of fortuitous\r\nevents and quick thinking. All of the Marines had been captured several\r\nmonths earlier, in the 28 November-11 December period, the majority\r\non the night of 29–30 November. There were peculiar circumstances\r\nconnected with their escape. In early April, a group of nearly 60\r\nUNC prisoners had been brought south by the enemy from the Majon-ni\r\narea. Presumably they were to perform working details in the rear of\r\nCommunist front lines.\r\n\r\nWhile a larger number of prisoners, both Army and Marine, were marched\r\nwestward to Pyoktong, First Lieutenant Frank E. Cold and a group of\r\n17 enlisted were sent further south to the general Chorwon area, not\r\nfar from the 38th Parallel. In the meantime the Chinese launched their\r\nspring counteroffensive on 22 April. It appears that, subsequently, the\r\nMarines and Army interpreter, Corporal Saburo “Sam” Shimamura, who had\r\nbeen attached to the 1st Marine Division, were told they would be taken\r\nto the area in which the Marine division was operating and released\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe group was then trucked southeast to Chunchon, just below the\r\nParallel, under guard, and marched toward the vicinity of the front\r\nlines. On 24 May, while in proximity to the main battle area, an\r\nartillery preparation suddenly registered nearby. The CCF guards fled,\r\nwhile the prisoners ran in the opposite direction, heading for high\r\nground where they successfully eluded the guards. For the rest of that\r\nday and night the escapees quietly watched Communist troops retreat\r\npast them. The next day, 25 May, the Marines fashioned make-shift air\r\npanels from wallpaper they stripped from a ruined Korean house in the\r\narea. They spelled out “POWS--19 RESCUE.” Their signal attracted the\r\nattention of an Army observation pilot who radioed their position to an\r\nArmy reconnaissance unit.\r\n\r\nThree Army tanks were dispatched and escorted the ex-prisoners to\r\nsafety. They entered friendly lines in the vicinity of Chunchon,\r\n“the first and only group of prisoners to experience Communist\r\nindoctrination and to reach freedom after a prolonged period of\r\ninternment.”[625] Two members of the unit[626] were of special\r\ninterest. One man was 56-year-old Master Sergeant Gust H. Dunis, who\r\nhad barely survived the brutal, frozen death march to Kanggye in late\r\nDecember. The other was Staff Sergeant Charles L. Harrison, previously\r\nintroduced as a unique two-time prisoner of war.\r\n\r\n    [625] MacDonald, _POW_, p. 84, reporting news stories in _The\r\n          Washington Post_, dtd 27 Aug 53, p. 7, and _Saturday\r\n          Evening Post_, 25 Aug 51, p. 109.\r\n\r\n    [626] Roster of this May 1951 escape group: 1stLt Cold,\r\n          H&S/3/7; MSgt Dunis, Military Police Co; SSgt Harrison,\r\n          MPCo; SSgt James B.

Corporal William S. Blair, B/1/7, and PFC\r\nBernard W. Insco, D/2/11, were taken prisoner on 24 April 1951 while\r\nthe 1st Marine Division was operating as a component of IX Corps.\r\nAlthough originally sent north to a POW camp, both were released on 12\r\nMay by the enemy after less than a month’s captivity. Another pair of\r\nlucky Marines were PFC Richard R. Grindle and Corporal Harold J. Kidd,\r\nboth of B/1/7. Seized on 11 May in patrol actions, they were the only\r\nMarines captured in ground fighting that month, and escaped to return\r\nto the division four days later.\r\n\r\nAt least six escape attempts are known to have been made by Marine\r\nPOWs, and another elaborate plan late in the war was foiled before it\r\ngot under way. The incidents follow:\r\n\r\n  #1. In the early winter months of 1951, Sergeant Donald M.\r\n  Griffith, F/2/5, became increasingly upset by the filth, steady\r\n  attrition of POWs, and semi-starvation diet at The Valley. He\r\n  vowed to escape. Late one night he pretended to go to the latrine\r\n  and finding the guard asleep, instead hurried down the path\r\n  leading out of the valley. He walked until dawn, then found a\r\n  hut where he hid among a pile of rice bags for some much-needed\r\n  sleep. Later, he knocked at a hut, asking for food. While he ate,\r\n  however, his genial host’s son was out contacting a military\r\n  patrol which even then was on Griffith’s trail.\r\n\r\n  A group of Communist soldiers closed in to recapture him. As\r\n  early punishment, Griffith’s shoe pacs were taken from him and\r\n  he was forced to walk back to the Valley in his threadbare ski\r\n  socks. Returned to the camp, the Marine sergeant was beaten\r\n  across the face. He was also directed to walk up a nearby hill\r\n  and for three successive times a rifle bullet tearing by his head\r\n  barely missed him. Later he learned that plans of his escape were\r\n  leaked to the CCF by an informer, thus triggering an early search.\r\n\r\n  #2. In May 1951, Captain Bryon H. Beswick, VMF-323, was a member\r\n  of a large POW column being marched north. Although still\r\n  suffering severe burns on his face, hands, and leg incurred\r\n  while bailing out of his plane that had caught fire, Beswick and\r\n  four others attempted to outwit their guards while on the march.\r\n  All the would-be escapees were placed in solitary confinement.\r\n\r\n  #3. Shortly after his capture in July 1951, PFC Alfred P. Graham,\r\n  Jr., H/3/5, was interned temporarily at what appeared to be a\r\n  divisional headquarters. One afternoon when the guards seemed\r\n  slack, Graham and another Marine sneaked off. Ultimately they\r\n  approached a farmhouse to get food and there stumbled into a half\r\n  dozen Koreans who took them into custody. The two Marines were\r\n  beaten with a submachine gun and their hands were bound behind\r\n  their back with communications wire. On their forced reappearance\r\n  at the original site of escape, a Korean officer beat and\r\n  interrogated them for three days.\r\n\r\n  #4. A short-lived escape attempt at Pak’s Palace, not long after\r\n  his capture in October 1951, had earned Lieutenant Gillette\r\n  a solitary confinement tour. Arriving at Officers’ camp in\r\n  Pi-chong-ni the following spring, the former VMF(N)-513 squadron\r\n  member and a South African air force pilot laid plans for a\r\n  mutual escape. Gillette deliberately set himself on a course of\r\n  reduced rations to prepare himself for the coming feat. When the\r\n  two men made their break, they were shot at but managed to safely\r\n  clear the camp.\r\n\r\n  The first night out the other pilot so badly injured himself in\r\n  a fall that Gillette had to leave him and go on alone. Although\r\n  the apparent escape route lay to the west, nearer the coast, the\r\n  Marine chose to go east across rugged mountains that offered\r\n  little in the way of cover, concealment, or food. His unorthodox\r\n  planning nearly paid off. “Whereas most escapees were recaptured\r\n  within hours, or at best within days, Lieutenant Gillette was\r\n  free for several weeks before the Communists found him halfway\r\n  across Korea.”[627] One Royal Marine described the attempt as\r\n  “the finest and most determined one he knew of.”[628]\r\n\r\n    [627] MacDonald, _POW_, p. 169.\r\n\r\n    [628] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n#5. In July 1952, three Marine officers were involved in an abortive\r\nescape attempt at Camp 2. They were Lieutenant Colonel Thrash, Major\r\nMcLaughlin, and Second Lieutenant Richard L. Sill, 1st 90mm AAA\r\nGun Battalion. When detected outside of camp they were able to get\r\nback inside the compound, but the Chinese did identify Lieutenant\r\nStill. His escape attempt earned him a three-month sentence in the\r\nhole from which he later “emerged unbothered and steeled against the\r\nCommunists.”[629]\r\n\r\n    [629] _Ibid._, p. 170.\r\n\r\n#6. Captain Martelli escaped from the Camp 2 compound in September\r\n1952. Retaken 10 days later, he was put in the same hole for two\r\nmonths. On release from the confinement, he was visibly upset by the\r\nexperience, but quickly recovered. As a matter of interest, Martelli,\r\nlike the other men whose exploits are recounted here, returned home in\r\nOperation BIG SWITCH.\r\n\r\n#7. In the spring of 1953 a group of 30 officers, including two British\r\nMarines, at Camp 2 organized classes in mathematics, physics, and\r\nsurvival lectures. Conferences on escape and evasion techniques were\r\nheld and the men formed escape groups. The teams drew straws to pick\r\npriorities for escape, and each one presented its plan to a senior body\r\nfor approval. On 1 July, with support of the other teams, the first\r\ngroup went over the fence surrounding their house. Their freedom was\r\nbrief, however, and the camp guard doubled. When rumors of armistice\r\nbegan circulating, further escape plans were cancelled. Clandestine\r\nprisoner escape committees--although unsuccessful in terms of actual\r\nresults achieved--had existed at various camps. Second Lieutenant\r\nRowland M. Murphy had been a member of such an organization at Obul.\r\nMajor McLaughlin had assumed similar responsibilities at Camp 5, in\r\n1951, and later at Camp 2 served on the secret all-UNC prisoners\r\nescape committee and senior officers’ organization within Camp 2. In\r\nearly 1953 Major Harris became senior officer at the Camp 2 Annex. He\r\norganized Spanish classes as a facade for having a regular meeting\r\nplace to announce policy and issue orders. Maps of North Korea were\r\nprepared for use in escape attempts and counter-Chinese political\r\nindoctrination was disseminated.\r\n\r\nThe Camp 2 officers performed another useful service. As rumor leaked\r\nout of the impending truce, they drafted a policy guide on POW behavior\r\nthat was secretly circulated to other camps. UNC prisoners were\r\ndirected to refrain from any appearance of fraternizing with the enemy,\r\nor acts of exuberance or violence. Specifically, they were reminded\r\nnot to show any great enthusiasm upon their release, to prevent\r\nthe Communist cameras on the scene from recording this as another\r\npropaganda victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Evaluation and Aftermath_[630]\r\n\r\n    [630] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: HRS Subject File: VE23.2.S8 “CMC\r\n          Statements on Korean POWs”; Biog File, HRB, HistDiv,\r\n          HQMC; MacDonald, _POW_; Fehrenbach, _Kind of War_; Elliot\r\n          Harris, _The “UnAmerican” Weapon--Psychological Warfare_\r\n          (New York: M. W. Lads Publishing Co., 1967); Leckie,\r\n          _Conflict_; Rees, _Korea_.\r\n\r\nWith but a few exceptions, circumstances indicated that capture of most\r\nMarines was unavoidable. Theoretically, it can be argued that several\r\nseized in bunkers might have avoided captivity had they been occupying\r\nfighting-holes instead. On the other hand, they might just as readily\r\nhave become statistics on a KIA list, instead, by falling victim to\r\npreparatory fire that preceded the enemy’s main assault.\r\n\r\nAs Marine historian, then-Major, MacDonald has noted:\r\n\r\n  A shadow fell over American POWs in the aftermath of the Korean\r\n  War. Courts-martial and other official inquiries revealed that\r\n  a small segment of the Americans captured by the Communists\r\n  had been guilty of behavior ranging from questionable to\r\n  treasonable.[631]\r\n\r\n    [631] MacDonald, _POW_, p. 3.\r\n\r\nBoth the Secretary of Defense Advisory Committee on Prisoners of War\r\nand the United States Congress, which investigated the entire POW\r\nissue, returned favorable verdicts for Marine POW conduct. The U.S.\r\nSenate report summarized its findings:\r\n\r\n  The United States Marine Corps, the Turkish troops, and the\r\n  Colombians as groups, did not succumb to the pressures exerted\r\n  upon them by the Communists and did not cooperate or collaborate\r\n  with the enemy. For this they deserve greatest admiration and\r\n  credit.[632]\r\n\r\n    [632] _Ibid._, p. 237.\r\n\r\nIn commenting on prisoner attitudes and activities that seemed\r\nto account for those men who became “survival types”, an Army\r\npsychiatrist, Major William F. Mayer, observed:\r\n\r\n  The Marines were a statistically significant group from the\r\n  standpoint of size, something over two hundred; the only thing\r\n  I can say about them is that more of them survived than we. I\r\n  think this is a function of discipline and morale and esprit; and\r\n  the attitude in the Marine Corps I expressed a little while ago,\r\n  that if something happens to me, these jokers will take care of\r\n  me.[633]\r\n\r\n    [633] _Ibid._, pp. 236–237, address to U.S. Army Chaplain\r\n          School, 1957.\r\n\r\nIn the nature of self-judgment, Sergeant Griffith referred to “that\r\ncertain ‘something’ that seems to weld men together prevailed\r\nmore among the Marine POWs than it did with the other captured UN\r\nTroops.”[634] The Marine with probably more experience as a POW than\r\nanyone else, Sergeant Harrison, noted that “without USMC training I\r\nwould never have lived through several tight spots. I am not talking\r\nstrictly about physical training as I am mental conditioning. It is\r\nsomething that causes you to think ... about what the other guy will\r\nthink or how it [your action] might affect or endanger them.”[635]\r\n\r\n    [634] _Ibid._, p. 88.\r\n\r\n    [635] _Ibid._, p. 238.\r\n\r\nA senior Air Force officer, Lieutenant Colonel Gerald Brown, who headed\r\nPOW units at Camp 2 and 5 between his tours of solitary confinement,\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n  I was extremely proud of the conduct of U.S. Marine Corps\r\n  personnel with whom I came in contact during my period of\r\n  confinement. Their esprit de corps was perhaps the highest of\r\n  any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States during this\r\n  period.[636]\r\n\r\n    [636] _Ibid._, p. 220.\r\n\r\nAnd Navy Chief Duane Thorin, a former inmate of the Camp 2 annex,\r\nwho later inspired the character of the helicopter pilot in James A.\r\nMichener’s _The Bridges of Toko-ri_, pointed out:\r\n\r\n  The Navy and Marine Corps POWs were generally excellent.\r\n  The Marines who left something to be desired were more than\r\n  compensated for by the majority of them.[637]\r\n\r\n    [637] _Ibid._, p. 223.\r\n\r\nAnother view was offered by a prominent neurologist and consultant\r\nto the Secretary of Defense Advisory Committee, Dr. Harold G. Wolff.\r\nAfter investigating the performance of American POWs in Korea, Dr.\r\nWolff concluded they had not “behaved much differently from other men\r\nin other armies and places” but that Americans had been made to appear\r\nmuch worse “by the enemy’s propaganda devices and our own initial\r\nineptitude in countering the Communist propaganda.”[638]\r\n\r\n    [638] _Ibid._, p. 237.\r\n\r\nAs a postscript to the POW story, five Marines received awards, on 11\r\nJanuary 1954, for their exceptionally meritorious conduct while serving\r\nas prisoners of the Communists in Korea. They were:\r\n\r\n  Lieutenant Colonel Thrash--awarded a Gold Star in lieu of a\r\n  second Legion of Merit;\r\n\r\n  Major McLaughlin--awarded the Legion of Merit;\r\n\r\n  Major Harris--also awarded the Legion of Merit;\r\n\r\n  Captain Flynn--awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal; and\r\n\r\n  Master Sergeant Cain--awarded a Letter of Commendation with\r\n  Ribbon.\r\n\r\nOn the negative side, one enlisted Marine was disciplined for his\r\ncooperation with the enemy in writing a pro-Communist magazine article.\r\nA Court of Inquiry, convened in March 1954, did not recommend a\r\ncourt-martial for the 45-year-old pilot, Colonel Schwable. After a\r\nmonth-long review of circumstances involved in the case, the court\r\nopined that he had resisted Communist pressure and torture “to the\r\nlimit of his ability before giving in.”[639] Its final judgment was\r\nthat Schwable--a Naval Academy graduate, veteran of 20 years’ military\r\nservice, and distinguished WW II night-fighter pilot and squadron\r\nCO--not be subjected to disciplinary action. At the same time the court\r\nheld that his future usefulness as a Marine officer was “seriously\r\nimpaired” by his conduct as a war prisoner.\r\n\r\n    [639] _Ibid._, p. 233.\r\n\r\nOn a larger scale, 192 Americans were found guilty of misconduct\r\nagainst fellow prisoners or various degrees of collaboration with the\r\nenemy. None of these was a Marine. In comparison with some 22,000\r\nCommunists who refused repatriation, 21 U.S. and 1 British prisoner\r\nsuccumbed to CCF brainwashing tactics. Twelve of the Americans have\r\nsince returned to the U.S., apparently disenchanted with the Communist\r\nversion of “people’s democracy” after getting a closer look at it.\r\n\r\nInvestigations later showed that “only a handful of the POWs in Korea\r\nwere able to maintain absolute silence under military interrogation.\r\nNearly all of the American prisoners went beyond the [Geneva\r\nConvention] ‘absolute’, name, rank, serial number, and date of birth\r\nrestriction.”[640] Although giving false or misleading information was\r\na common occurrence in POW camps, such testimony was usually quickly\r\ndetected. American military authorities, drawing up a revised Code of\r\nConduct (1955) subsequently recommended against making untruthful\r\nstatements. Further, even though several Marines seemed to have\r\nsuffered none the worse for giving false information, in at least one\r\ncase a prisoner’s own situation was weakened by enemy detection of his\r\nlie and increasing pressure was brought against him.\r\n\r\n    [640] _Ibid._, p. 230.\r\n\r\nIt was found too, that in every group of prisoners there were always\r\ngradations of those more cooperative with the enemy (“progressives”)\r\nand those who offered open or passive resistance (“reactionaries”).\r\nOne Korean War analyst, in seeking the final explanation of what POW\r\ntactics succeeded best against a dedicated enemy, cited the Turkish\r\n“chain of command that was never broken” and which helped to mold\r\nthem together. He noted the “permissive” culture and background\r\nof Americans where freedom of choice and individual decisions are\r\nbasic tenets. Despite the effect of military indoctrination and\r\ndiscipline, this concept of individualism and freedom appeared to be so\r\nstrongly engrained that unless there was a corresponding emphasis on\r\nresponsibility and strong beliefs it tended to weaken a man when his\r\naction and values were put to a prolonged test--as in the POW compound.\r\nThe analyst concluded:\r\n\r\n  Only an extremely cohesive group, with tight leadership and great\r\n  spiritual strengths, coupled with inner toughness and concern for\r\n  one another, could have survived the shocks visited upon their\r\n  minds and bodies.... They [the Turks] remained united against the\r\n  enemy, and they survived.[641]\r\n\r\n    [641] Fehrenbach, _Kind of War_, pp. 541–542.\r\n\r\nThis judgement, to a large degree, tells the Marine POW story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nWhile Guns Cool\r\n\r\n_The Postwar Transition--Control of the DMZ and the Military Police\r\nCompany--Organization of New Defense Positions--Postwar Employment of\r\nMarine Units in_ FECOM\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Postwar Transition_[642]\r\n\r\n    [642] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chaps. 9,\r\n          10; 1stMarDiv ComdDs Jul-Sep 53; 1stMarDiv Type “C”\r\n          Rpt--Defense of “C” Sector, 27 Jul-31 Oct 53, Folder\r\n          #3 (this and following 1stMarDiv end-of-war records\r\n          currently retired in 61 A2265, Box 74, FRC, Suitland,\r\n          Md.); 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnls, 30 Jul-31 Aug 53; 1stMar Hist\r\n          of Defense of “D” Sector, 27 Jul-31 Oct 53, Folder #3\r\n          (contains brief histories of 1/1, 2/1, 3/1, AT Co/1,\r\n          4.2-inch MortCo/1); 5thMar Hist of Def of “D” Sector,\r\n          27 Jul-31 Oct 53, Folder #3; 5thMar Hist, same period,\r\n          Folder #4 (brief histories of 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, AT Co/5,\r\n          4.2-inch MortCo/5, DMZ Police Co/5), dtd 26 Dec 53;\r\n          7thMar Hist of Defense, 27 Jul 53–10 Feb 54 (brief\r\n          histories 1/7, 2/7, 3/7, AT Co/7, 4.2-inch MortCo/7),\r\n          Folder #5; 1stMarDiv-Type “C” Rpt--Defense of “C” Div\r\n          Sect, 27 Jul-31 Dec 53, Folder #6 (containing, among\r\n          others, brief rpts 11thMar, 1st TkBn, 1st Engr Bn, 1st MT\r\n          Bn, 7th MT Bn, 1st KMC Regt, 2d KMC Regt).\r\n\r\nTerms of the Armistice Agreement required EUSAK components, including\r\nthe 1st Marine Division, to carry out a number of major tasks in the\r\nmonths following the end of active hostilities. As stipulated by the\r\ncease-fire, UNC troops all along the front withdrew to a new main\r\nbattle position (MBP) south of the main line of resistance. A military\r\ndemarcation line (MDL) was established between enemy and friendly\r\npositions, corresponding to the end-of-war battle lines. Each side\r\npulled back 2,000 yards from this MDL, with the combined 4,000-yard\r\nbuffer strip on both sides being known as the demilitarized zone.(DMZ).\r\n\r\nA continuous double-strand barbed wire fence, known as the No-Pass\r\nFence, or No-Pass Line, was erected 200 yards below the southern\r\nboundary of the DMZ by infantry units manning the MLR at the time of\r\nthe cease-fire. Appropriate marking signs, in Chinese, Korean, and\r\nEnglish, were placed at regular intervals along the fence, prohibiting\r\nunauthorized entry into the Demilitarized Zone.\r\n\r\nStrict requirements by I Corps enjoined that the “fence on the southern\r\nboundary of the DMZ must present a continuous unbroken line except for\r\ngates and where it crosses large streams.”[643] Beginning late on 27\r\nJuly 1953, the 1st Marine Division’s modified mission became that of\r\nwithdrawal to and organization of the post-armistice MBP, establishment\r\nof the No-Pass Line, and defense of the new position in readiness for\r\nany possible resumption of hostilities by the enemy.\r\n\r\n    [643] 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl, dtd 2 Aug 53.\r\n\r\nDivision officers, from commanding general to platoon leader level,\r\nrepeatedly emphasized that the armistice agreement was only a cessation\r\nof active fighting. As such, it could be violated by the enemy at any\r\ntime. The armistice was not a peace, but had simply paved the way for a\r\npolitical conference. As the UNC commander, General Mark W. Clark, had\r\nstated, the 27 July document was merely “a military agreement between\r\nopposing commanders to cease fire and to permit the opposing sides to\r\narrive at a peaceful solution of the conflict.”[644] Since many felt\r\nthe cease-fire might be only temporary and not necessarily a permanent\r\npeace, all hands showed an attitude of skepticism and watchful waiting.\r\nThere was little disposition or time for celebration. The response of\r\nmany men to the complete lack of noise across the front was one of\r\nsimple restlessness and expectancy.\r\n\r\n    [644] 1stMarDiv ComdD Aug 53, App. VII, Annex E to\r\n          IMARD-00-10-53, p. 2.\r\n\r\nFrom the 7th Marines just engaged in the vicious Boulder City battle,\r\nthe reaction\r\n\r\n  ... was one of disbelief and caution. Extensive movements of the\r\n  enemy during the night of 27 July only bolstered the feeling\r\n  of wariness and suspicion. Only after dawn broke on 28 July,\r\n  without any shots being fired, did the realism [reality] of the\r\n  truce become apparent, followed by a wide-spread sensation of\r\n  relief.[645]\r\n\r\n    [645] 7thMar Hist, p. 1, Folder #5.\r\n\r\nA 5th Marines representative noted:\r\n\r\n  The fact that negotiations had been going on for some time with\r\n  numerous false alarms dulled the edge for most people, and a\r\n  prior announcement that the agreement would be signed took most\r\n  of the steam away from the actual culmination of the fighting ...\r\n  in effect [the cease-fire] meant “we’re giving you ten dollars\r\n  but don’t spend it for we might take it back.”[646]\r\n\r\n    [646] Co H Rpt of Post-Armistice Activities, Encl (2), CO 3/5\r\n          ltr ser 00208, dtd 11 Jan 54, p. 1, in 3/5 Hist, Folder\r\n          #4.\r\n\r\nThe view expressed by a Korean regimental commander was that:\r\n\r\n  Many of the officers and men were relieved to see the fighting\r\n  cease; others, particularly among the officers, would rather have\r\n  seen the fighting continue until the country could be united.\r\n  However, the officers and men accepted the cease-fire as a\r\n  military order and acted accordingly.[647]\r\n\r\n    [647] 1st KMC Regt Rpt, dtd 7 Apr 54, p. 1, in 1stMarDiv Type\r\n          “C” Rpt, Folder #6.\r\n\r\nDivision MLR units on 27 July had been the 1st KMC, the 5th Marines,\r\nand 1st Marines in the left, center, and right regimental sectors,\r\nrespectively. With the pullback of the division to new defensive\r\npositions, the 5th Marines--the infantry regiment that had not been\r\nheavily engaged in recent combat--was assigned the mission of defending\r\nthe forward general outpost (GOP) line across the division front. In\r\naddition, the 5th Marines, or Northern Regiment as it came to be called\r\nsince it was the only one remaining north of the Imjin River, was also\r\ncharged with police duties and security of the UNC part of the DMZ\r\nlocated in the division sector.\r\n\r\nMarine regiments, battalions, and companies began withdrawing from the\r\nDMZ to move to their new MBP early on the morning of 28 July, less than\r\n24 hours after the signing of the Korean armistice. To some extent, the\r\nrelocation of units was facilitated by the fact that the forward part\r\nof the division sector had been defended by the three MLR regiments.\r\nSince the lateral boundaries, initially, would remain the same, the\r\nthree 5th Marines battalions were to occupy positions held by the three\r\nline regiments. Orders called for 2/5 to occupy the left regimental\r\nsector previously held by the 1st Korean Marine Corps Regimental Combat\r\nTeam; 1/5 to man the 5th Marines center sector; and 3/5 to assume the\r\nright regimental sector.\r\n\r\nWhereas 5th Marines battalions were directed to occupy their new\r\npositions by D+84 hours (or 2200, 30 July), other units in some cases\r\nwere not required to pull out of their respective positions until\r\npositions by D+108 hours (2000, 1 August). This was done to insure\r\nthat no portion of the division front was left unmanned during this\r\nvery critical period. It did, however, force small units to make two\r\nmoves and “in one instance, a battalion and a regimental headquarters\r\nwere occupying the same area.”[648] Because of the need to move almost\r\nimmediately, only a hasty physical reconnaissance was made. Small unit\r\nleaders were not always familiar with the area and this gave rise, in\r\nsome instances, to confusion about exact unit boundaries. This resulted\r\nin a later relocation of several units.\r\n\r\n    [648] 5thMar Hist, dtd 26 Dec 53, p. 4, Folder #4.\r\n\r\nFor the first 72 hours after the armistice, Marines were engaged in\r\na maximum effort to tear down installations, salvage fortification\r\nmaterials, and physically move out of the Demilitarized Zone.\r\nInfantry units were responsible for this destruction and salvage work\r\nwithin assigned sectors, with 1st Engineer Battalion assistance and\r\nsupervision, as available. For the nearly 50 Marine infantry companies\r\nand attached KMC units, the order of priorities for those first three\r\ndays generally appears to have been:\r\n\r\n  (1) Recovery of ordnance and removal to company supply dumps;\r\n\r\n  (2) Removal of all combat equipment to supply dumps; and\r\n\r\n  (3) Destruction of field fortifications and salvage of all bunker\r\n  timbers and other building materials from the old MLR sector.\r\n\r\nSpecifications of the initial armistice agreement, as originally\r\ndrawn up in August 1952, had called for a complete withdrawal of all\r\nmilitary personnel, supplies, and equipment from the DMZ within 72\r\nhours after the cease-fire. Destruction of all fortifications within\r\nthe DMZ likewise was to be accomplished within this 72-hour deadline.\r\nIt subsequently became evident, however, that it would be impossible to\r\ncomplete the entire job of dismantling and salvaging MLR fortifications\r\nwithin a three-day period. In mid-June 1953, CinCUNC had advised major\r\ncommands that Communist and UNC negotiators had agreed to extend\r\nthe original 72 hours to an additional 45-day period, or until 13\r\nSeptember.[649]\r\n\r\n    [649] Other modifications and deadline extensions included:\r\n          (a) withdrawal of all military forces, supplies, and\r\n          equipment from coastal islands and waters north of the\r\n          38th Parallel within 5 days increased to 10 days; (b)\r\n          Personnel and equipment to be evacuated from Korea only\r\n          through those ports of entry specified in the armistice\r\n          agreement. 1st MAW ComdD, Vol. III, Jun 53, Msg from\r\n          CinCUNC to CG, AFFE, COMNAVFE, CG FEAF, info 1st MAW and\r\n          others, dtd 17 Jun 53.\r\n\r\nDivision order 1MARD-OP-11-53, issued at 1600 on 27 July, clearly\r\nstated that all “removable materials”[650] would be taken out of\r\nthe DMZ within the immediate 72-hour period following the effective\r\ndate of the armistice (2200, 27 July). The end-of-war order further\r\ndirected that division personnel would “locate and list all valuable\r\nmaterials which should be salvaged but cannot be moved during this\r\nprescribed time ... an additional period of 45 days, after the initial\r\n72-hour period, will be used to complete salvage operations within the\r\nDemilitarized Zone under the supervision of the Military Armistice\r\nCommission....”[651]\r\n\r\n    [650] 1stMarDiv Folder “Withdrawal to and Organization of Post\r\n          Armistice MBP 1MARD-OP-11-53-July 1953,” dtd 27 Jul 53.\r\n\r\n    [651] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nFrom top to lower echelons, however, a breakdown in communications\r\nseems to have taken place in the maze of post-truce orders. At the pick\r\nand shovel level, initial instructions were sometimes to the effect of:\r\n\r\n  Salvage everything possible in the 72 hours we have to get out of\r\n  here. If unable to salvage; then destroy.... No word was passed\r\n  that there would be a period following the truce in which we\r\n  could conduct a thorough salvage operation. Had this information\r\n  been available, a more systematic process could have been\r\n  devised....[652]\r\n\r\n    [652] Co H Rpt, _op. cit._, p. 1, 3/5 Hist, Folder #4.\r\n\r\nOne regiment commented “that early directives from higher authorities\r\ndid not clearly establish the relative priority for salvage\r\noperations.”[653] More specifically, 1/7 related:\r\n\r\n    [653] 7thMar Hist, dtd 28 Jan 54, p. 5, Folder #5.\r\n\r\n  Periodically, messages would be received stressing certain\r\n  items of salvage as critical. This required revision of working\r\n  schedules and shifting of men to other jobs ... if all salvageable\r\n  material had been designated as critical at the commencement\r\n  of salvage operations, the work could have been completed more\r\n  expeditiously....[654]\r\n\r\n    [654] 1/7 Hist, in 7thMar Hist, p. 4, Folder #5.\r\n\r\nA 5th Marines observer commented on the confusion in these words:\r\n\r\n  It is evident, however, that in dissemination to some of the\r\n  lower echelons, pertinent information was either ignored or\r\n  improperly passed ... some Company Commanders were under the\r\n  impression that the entire job of dismantling and salvaging was\r\n  to be completed in 72 hours. The result of this misconception was\r\n  that in some areas bunkers were filled in with earth and then\r\n  later had to be evacuated [excavated] in order to salvage the\r\n  materials.[655]\r\n\r\n    [655] 5thMar Hist, p. 1, Folder #4.\r\n\r\nInitial salvage operations were conducted from 28–30 July. Trenchlines\r\nwere filled in; tank slots dozed under; bunkers torn down and usable\r\ntimbers carried to salvage collecting points.\r\n\r\nBeginning on 28 July, 1st Marines line units on the division right\r\nflank came under operational control of the 5th Marines, with their new\r\nmission being to “man an outpost line on the most formidable ground\r\nsouth of the southern boundary of the newly planned Demilitarized\r\nZone in the MLR regimental sector.”[656] Movement to the new outpost\r\npositions was under way by 29 July.\r\n\r\n    [656] 1/1 Hist, in 1stMar Hist, p. 1, Folder #3.\r\n\r\nAs the Marine units moved south to establish their new outpost\r\npositions in previously undeveloped areas, the limited engineering\r\nequipment available for simultaneously dismantling bunkers and\r\nconstructing new camps tended to slow the latter job. Personnel of 1/1,\r\nwhich had utilized 124 vehicles for the transfer, were among those\r\nhoused in widely scattered areas for several days during the moving and\r\nsetting up of new camps. Torrential rains, of several days’ duration,\r\nwhich had engulfed the division’s transport operations on so many\r\noccasions in the past, caused the new campsites to turn into a muddy\r\nquagmire. Men of 2/5, during part of the relocation period, lived in\r\nshelter tents until regular tentage became available.\r\n\r\nA short moratorium on salvage activities took place between 31 July-3\r\nAugust while the details for entry into the DMZ were being settled.\r\nMarine division salvage efforts encompassed an area extending from the\r\nMLR to the sector rear, in the vicinity of the KANSAS Line, as far as\r\nthe Imjin River. Work in the areas south of the DMZ did not begin, in\r\nmost cases, until after 13 September, and fortifications of secondary\r\ndefense lines were left in place.\r\n\r\nAll salvage materials removed from the DMZ were placed in battalion\r\nand regimental dumps where they would be readily available for use\r\nin building the new battle positions. Recovery of ammunition was\r\naccomplished in some sectors early on the 28th. At the far right flank\r\nof the division line, the scene of the Marines’ final action in the\r\nKorean War, salvage efforts took on an additional task. Most of the\r\nfirst day was allotted to recovery of the dead at Hills 119 and 111 and\r\nthe removal of their bodies to rear areas.\r\n\r\nAlthough the enemy had policed in front of Marine lines on the night\r\nof 27–28 July, at first light the CCF indicated the desire to recover\r\ntheir dead from Marine positions. Enemy parties were thus permitted to\r\ntemporarily enter 3/1 lines to retrieve these bodies. This procedure\r\nprovoked some consternation and renewed vigilance by Marine personnel\r\nupon “seeing the enemy moving around within a stone’s throw of our\r\nfront lines so soon after his determined attacks.”[657]\r\n\r\n    [657] 3/1 Hist, in 1stMar Hist, p. 2, Folder #3.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Marines’ own corresponding unhappy task was completed,\r\nammunition was removed to supply dumps, a laborious task not finished\r\nin the 1st Marines sector until noon on 29 July. The fierce fighting\r\nthat had started after dark on 24 July and lasted until the morning\r\nof the ceasefire also accounted for the large amount of salvageable\r\nitems found in the area including M-1 rifles, helmets, armored vests,\r\nand quantities of blood serum. All ordnance, equipment, and building\r\nmaterials were separated into stockpiles of good or nonrepairable\r\nitems. Ammunition in excess of a one-half a basic JAMESTOWN fire unit\r\n(a unit of fire is the amount of ammunition a weapon will use in a day\r\nof combat), was placed in company and battalion dumps for collection by\r\nregimental ordnance teams.\r\n\r\nOn occasion, salvage of friendly ammunition was made more difficult\r\nbecause COP stockpiles struck by enemy mortar fire contained both\r\ndamaged and live, usable ammunition mixed together. Although 1st\r\nEngineer Battalion ordnance disposal teams covered the positions\r\nthoroughly, unexploded mortar and artillery rounds were often unearthed\r\nby Marines filling in the old trenches, knocking down bunkers, or\r\nrecovering wire. Anti-personnel mines forward of the protective wire\r\nprevented full salvage operations in some cases.\r\n\r\nThree Marine combat outposts required special attention. These were\r\nBunker Hill and Esther, in the central part of the MLR, and Ava, in\r\nthe right sector. Although occupied by Marines at the time of the\r\ncease-fire, the COPs fell north of the MDL and thus became inaccessible\r\nfor salvage after the initial 72-hour period. The positions were\r\nreduced and materials salvaged in the allotted time.\r\n\r\nDuring the first night, Marines of 3/5 (originally the right battalion,\r\ncenter sector) removed more than 11 truckloads of ammunition. Outposts\r\nHedy and Bunker offered a particular problem due to the distance from\r\nthe MLR and nearest road. As described by some veterans of 24-hour work\r\ncrews, the trail to Bunker was “particularly tortuous and made the\r\npacking of first the ammunition and later the fortification materials a\r\nphysical ordeal.”[658]\r\n\r\n    [658] Co I Rpt of Post-Armistice Activities, Encl (3), CO 3/5\r\n          ltr ser 00208, dtd 11 Jan 54, p. 1, in 3/5 Hist, Folder\r\n          #4.\r\n\r\nAt Hedy the extreme proximity of CCF and Marine lines posed an\r\nadditional difficulty. On the afternoon of the 28th, an interval of 20\r\nyards separated the two; by the following day the enemy had completed\r\nhis work in the area and was never again that close. Operations here\r\nwere also somewhat delayed “by an influx of visitors: newspapermen and\r\nnewsreel cameramen all interested in the great numbers of enemy visible\r\nto our front engaged in the same tasks that we were.”[659]\r\n\r\n    [659] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nDismantling bunkers was the single biggest problem of the entire\r\nsalvage program. This operation began at dawn on the 28th and was\r\nnot completed until the second week of September. Ultimately, more\r\nthan 500 bunkers were reclaimed from MLR materials and installed in\r\nthe new division position. Most of the bunkers were built of 12x12\r\ntimbers, buried deep in the ground, fastened together with 10- to\r\n16-inch spikes. Infantry organic tools and equipment were inadequate\r\nto dismember bunkers so constructed. Crowbars, picks, shovels, pinch\r\nbars, and sledge hammers were all in short supply. Engineer equipment\r\nand other tools were not stockpiled in sufficient quantity to buttress\r\na demolition program of such magnitude.\r\n\r\nIn places where the terrain permitted operation of bulldozers, their\r\nuse drastically shortened the time spent uncovering bunkers. Where\r\nthese had been emplaced on reverse slope positions of steep hills,\r\nhowever, the timbers had to be removed by hand. The latter was the\r\ngenerally prevailing situation.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, throughout the demolition program “basic equipment\r\nwas usually the Marine himself and his ingenuity.”[660] Effective\r\non-the-spot, problem-solving was seen in the many “jury-rigged” levers\r\nor prybars fashioned from timbers and crowbars from scrap steel. The\r\n“Korean Sling Method,” with heavy rope and carrying poles, was often\r\nused to move heavy timbers. Trucks equipped with winches and wreckers\r\nwere effective for this purpose. Dozer tanks were also used, but only\r\nafter having their guns removed as required by the armistice agreement.\r\nDivision engineers experimented at some length with three different\r\nways to pull apart the larger 12x20 bunkers, in which the cross beams\r\nwere secured to columns with two-feet spikes. The least technical\r\napproach which involved “winching the bunkers out of their positions\r\nand bouncing them down a steep slope until they broke apart proved the\r\nmost successful and the quickest method.”[661]\r\n\r\n    [660] 5thMar Hist, p. 2, Folder #4.\r\n\r\n    [661] 1st EngrBn Rpt, dtd 19 Apr 54, p. 3, Folder #6.\r\n\r\nBesides the lack of engineering tools, limited motor transport\r\nfacilities and manpower shortages also created difficulties. Heavy\r\ncommitments across the front, with virtually every division unit\r\ndisplacing to a new location, resulted in a shortage of trucks that\r\nslowed both salvage and logistics operations. Assignment of personnel\r\nto around-the-clock shifts during the critical initial 72-hour\r\nperiod and use of lighting trailers produced maximum results from\r\nthe available equipment. Company G, 3/5 reported that its men were\r\nallowed “ten minute breaks every hour and, because of the heat, they\r\nwere given from 1200 to 1500 hours for sleep and worked all through\r\nthe darkness.”[662] During this three-day period alone, the 1st\r\nTank Battalion transported 275 tons of ammunition and fortification\r\nmaterial, or a total of 111 loads in 2½-ton trucks.\r\n\r\n    [662] Co G Rpt of Post-Armistice Activities, Encl (1), CO 3/5\r\n          ltr ser 00208, dtd 11 Jan 54, p. 1, in 3/5 Hist, Folder\r\n          #4.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the restrictive provisions of the truce agreement led\r\nto a problem involving the use of heavy engineer vehicles. After 3\r\nAugust, it was difficult to bring into the DMZ any hauling or motorized\r\ngear that could be construed as “combat equipment.” The 2½-ton trucks,\r\nhowever, continued to be employed for much of the motor transport\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nBy 0930 on 1 August, the 1st Marine Division had completed its\r\nwithdrawal and manned the new MBP south of the DMZ. The 5th Marines\r\ncontinued its mission as the northern outpost regiment. South of the\r\nImjin, the 7th Marines occupied the right regimental sector; the 1st\r\nKMC moved into the center of the MBP; and the 1st Marines became the\r\ndivision reserve.\r\n\r\nBetween 3 August-13 September, each rifle company sent daily working\r\nparties into the DMZ to excavate those sectors occupied by Marine\r\nunits on 27 July. Depending on available transportation, the size\r\nof the working parties varied from 25 to 100 men. These shortages\r\nwere alleviated, to some extent, by KSC (Korean Service Corps)\r\npersonnel.[663] The heavy-duty, “pure drudgery without glamour,”\r\nmonotonous tasks performed in tropical weather, 103 degree-plus\r\ntemperatures and high humidity, caused one Marine infantryman to\r\ncomment ruefully:\r\n\r\n    [663] KSC units were deactivated shortly thereafter. Following\r\n          a EUSAK order in August to begin discontinuing use of the\r\n          Korean laborers, the number of KSC workers was reduced.\r\n          By the end of October, the 103d KSC Regiment attached to\r\n          the division had been completely disbanded.\r\n\r\n  Close officer supervision proved to be absolutely necessary due\r\n  to the nature of the work, which made the maintenance of interest\r\n  and enthusiasm in the average individual, very difficult.[664]\r\n\r\n    [664] 1/5 Hist, in 5thMar Hist, p. 3, Folder #4.\r\n\r\nIn another 5th Marines unit the motivation gap was partially solved by\r\n“use of a graph posted on the bulletin board showing the money value\r\nof materials salvaged each day, with the exhortation to better the\r\nprevious day’s total.”[665]\r\n\r\n    [665] 4.2-inch Mort Co/5, in 5thMar Hist, p. 3, Folder #4.\r\n\r\nThroughout the month of August and until 13 September, destruction\r\nof MLR positions and removal of materials took place concurrently\r\nwith organization of defensive positions in the new sector. After the\r\ninitial three-day period and its top priority of physical withdrawal\r\nof troops from the DMZ, division tactical requirements called for\r\ncompletion of the MBP as rapidly as possible. This now became the first\r\npriority. New company perimeter defense sites, battalion blocking\r\npositions, coordinated fire plans in event of attack, counterattack\r\norders, and evacuation routes were mapped out. Construction began\r\nimmediately. By 5 August, the new battalion camps had begun to take\r\nform and work on the blocking positions was in progress. Marine units,\r\nlike other UNC forces, had to be prepared at all times for any act of\r\nenemy aggression. Whether the Communists would continue to respect the\r\ncease-fire agreement or not remained an open question.\r\n\r\nStockpiling, meanwhile, had been accomplished at company, battalion,\r\nand regimental dumps. All materials were stacked by size to facilitate\r\nreissue during construction of new positions. As much as 90 percent of\r\nthe materials salvaged were usable in the new fortification. Although\r\na certain amount of inter-battalion exchange took place, battalion\r\nstocks--with the exception of sandbags--were usually adequate to\r\nprovide sufficient fortification materials for the rebuilding. For 5th\r\nMarines units that had the least distance to relocate, timbers moved\r\nfrom the old MLR in the morning were sometimes emplaced in the new\r\ndefensive positions by late afternoon. Helicopters, as well as trucks,\r\nwere used extensively to move stockpiles from company and battalion\r\nareas to rear regimental supply dumps.\r\n\r\nDivision MLR supplies salvaged by the 5th Marines represented:\r\n\r\n  T/E material                        12 tons\r\n\r\n  Signal equipment (wire)          2,000 miles\r\n\r\n  Engineer items\r\n    barbed wire                      2,850 rolls\r\n    concertina                         340 rolls\r\n    pickets, 6-foot                 11,000\r\n    pickets, 3-foot                  8,000\r\n    sandbags                       339,000\r\n    timbers (from 3×8 to 12×12)    150,000 linear feet\r\n\r\n  Total tonnage                      2,000 short tons\r\n\r\nThe 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines estimated that wire rolls, sandbags,\r\ntimbers, and other materiel “recovered by this battalion and assisting\r\nunits was valued at approximately $150,000.”[666]\r\n\r\n    [666] 2/5 Hist, in 5thMar Hist, dtd 12 Dec 53, p. 3, Folder #4.\r\n\r\nBy early September, the 1st Marine Division work priority once again\r\nhad reverted from camp construction to salvage operations. It had\r\nbecome apparent that another maximum effort period would be necessary\r\nif all salvageable materials were to be removed from the DMZ no later\r\nthan the 13 September deadline reaffirmed by I Corps on 2 September.\r\nDuring this last phase of salvage work, participating battalions\r\nagain came under operational control of the 5th Marines. Elements of\r\nthe 1st and 11th Marines, neither of which at that time had a sector\r\nof responsibility for salvage, as well as KMC troops, augmented the\r\norganic units. One battalion alone, 1/1, detailed 400 men in work\r\nparties. At 2130, on 13 September, the division completed its salvage\r\nmission in the Demilitarized Zone, thus meeting the specified time\r\nlimit. Under terms of the armistice agreement, after 13 September all\r\npersonnel were prohibited from entering the Korean Demilitarized Zone.\r\nThe only exceptions were members of the DMZ police companies of the\r\nAllied and Communist sides and other persons specifically authorized\r\npassage by the Military Armistice Commission (MAC).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Control of the DMZ and the Military Police Company_[667]\r\n\r\n    [667] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from: 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnls, 30 Jul-31 Aug 53;\r\n          Demilitarized Zone Police Co Rpt, dtd 18 Dec 53, in\r\n          5thMar Hist, Folder #4; MSgt Paul Sarokin, “DMZ Marines,”\r\n          _Leatherneck_, v. 37, no. 10 (Oct 54), hereafter Sarokin,\r\n          “DMZ Marines.”\r\n\r\nSince the late July signing of the armistice, one of the missions of\r\nthe 5th Marines GOP regiment had been the marking, control of entry,\r\nand policing of the DMZ. At the time the No-Pass Fence was constructed,\r\nroadblocks, called “crossing stations” were located at each route\r\nleading into the DMZ. Initially, 21 crossing stations were opened\r\nacross the regimental front. When it later became apparent that not\r\nall of these security points would be needed, some were closed and the\r\nroads barricaded. Each crossing station was manned by a minimum of\r\ntwo sentries who insured that no weapons were carried into the DMZ.\r\nAlong the fence itself, signs printed in three languages prohibited\r\nunauthorized entry into the southern boundary of the DMZ. On roads and\r\ntrails approaching the southern boundary fence, additional signs placed\r\n200 yards from the fence warned of the proximity to this southern end\r\nof the military zone. Air panels and engineer tape also marked the DMZ.\r\n\r\nAfter 31 July, entry into the DMZ was limited to those persons holding\r\na valid pass, issued under the auspices of the Military Armistice\r\nCommission. Authority was also delegated to CG, U.S. I Corps to issue\r\npasses for the I Corps sector. With salvage operations requiring a\r\nlarge number of passes, authority was further delegated to the CO,\r\n5th Marines, to issue permits for the regimental sector, good only\r\nfor unarmed[668] working parties engaged in salvage operations. The\r\nregimental S-2 established a pass control center, and anyone desiring\r\nto enter the DMZ made application through that office. Each pass\r\ncontained the bearer’s name, rank, service number, organization,\r\nnumber of personnel and vehicles in the working party, and reason for\r\nentry.\r\n\r\n    [668] With the exception of the DMZ Police, all persons\r\n          entering the DMZ for salvage were required to check their\r\n          weapons at the zone entry.\r\n\r\nSecurity procedures also required that a log book of all zone entries\r\nand exits be kept by crossing station guards. This information was\r\nultimately telephoned or radioed to higher echelons. At battalion and\r\nregimental levels a master log or “status board” indicated the number\r\nof people, vehicles, passes, and pass identification numbers present\r\nin the DMZ at all times. As the salvage program reached its height\r\nin August and early September, just the “issuance and recording of\r\npasses and the checking of the working parties into the zone became a\r\nmajor operation.”[669] Between 4 August-13 September, a total of 3,523\r\nvehicle passes and an unknown number of personnel permits were issued.\r\nWith the ending of salvage operations on 13 September, the Marine\r\nregiment no longer issued DMZ passes, although I Corps continued to\r\nauthorize MAC personnel entry permits.\r\n\r\n    [669] 5thMar Hist, p. 2, Folder #3.\r\n\r\nA stipulation set by the armistice agreement was that both the\r\nCommunist and UNC sides police their respective sections of the DMZ\r\nwith “civil police,” not to exceed 1,000 in the zone at any one time\r\nacross the entire front. With further allocation of police personnel\r\nto army and I Corps units, the number of 1st Marine Division police on\r\nduty within the DMZ at any one time was originally set at 50. Since\r\nno civilian police were available to either side, requirements were\r\nmodified so that a specially designated military unit, in lieu of civil\r\npolice, could be employed and the original quota enlarged if this\r\nbecame feasible.\r\n\r\nDue to the delicate political aspect of the DMZ as well as the\r\nnon-repatriated POWs in the custody of Indian forces, security measures\r\nwere of utmost importance. The Marine division activated a new unit,\r\nthe 1st Provisional Demilitarized Zone Police Company at 0800 on 4\r\nSeptember. The new unit, charged with maintaining security throughout\r\nthe 1st Marine Division sector, became operational three days later.\r\nCommanding officer was Captain Samuel G. Goich, formerly of F/2/7. Each\r\nregiment from the division furnished 25 enlisted men and 1 officer to\r\nform the company, including standby personnel. On 21 September, the\r\nDMZ Police Company was attached to the 5th Marines. Police Company\r\npersonnel were required to have had at least three months’ Korean\r\nservice, a General Classification Test score of at least 95, a minimum\r\nheight of 5 feet 10 inches, and were “selected for physical stature\r\nand mental capacity required in coping with the delicate situation\r\nexisting within the Demilitarized Zone.”[670] The average DMZ company\r\nmember was said to know “map-reading on an officer level, first aid,\r\nradio, and understand the fine print of the cease-fire agreement like a\r\nstriped-trouser diplomat.”[671]\r\n\r\n    [670] 1stMarDiv ComdD, Sep 53, p. 2.\r\n\r\n    [671] Sarokin, “DMZ Marines,” p. 23.\r\n\r\nThe mission of the Marine provisional police company as set up by the\r\ntruce agreement was to furnish military police escort for special\r\npersonnel visiting the DMZ and to apprehend truce violators or enemy\r\nline crossers. Visitors who rated a military escort were members of\r\nMAC, Joint Observer Teams, Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission\r\npersonnel,[672] NNSC inspection teams or agency assistants, or other\r\nVIPs authorized to enter the UN half by the Military Armistice\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n    [672] The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission supervised all\r\n          phases of implementation of the armistice. It consisted\r\n          of the Secretariat and 20 neutral nations inspection\r\n          teams staffed by personnel from Sweden, Switzerland,\r\n          Poland, and Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nSix Marine DMZ military policemen, each armed with a .45 caliber pistol\r\nand M-1 rifle, accompanied UN joint observer teams to the demarcation\r\nline, midpoint between enemy and friendly boundaries, but did not\r\ncross the MDL. I Corps orders directed that military police were to be\r\n“responsible for the safety of the United Nations members of the team\r\nand, when meetings are held south of the demarcation line, they will be\r\nresponsible for the safety of the CCF members of the team as well.”[673]\r\n\r\n    [673] 1stMarDiv G-3 Jnl, dtd 1 Aug 53, msg CG I U.S. Corps to\r\n          addees, dtd 31 Jul 53.\r\n\r\nMajor tasks performed by the 104-man company operating within the\r\n2,000-yard wide, 28-mile-long zone were:\r\n\r\n  To maintain surveillance over civilians within the UN half of the\r\n  DMZ;\r\n\r\n  To apprehend and deliver to the Division Provost Marshal any line\r\n  crossers encountered who did not possess an authorized pass,\r\n  regardless of the direction from which such persons entered the\r\n  DMZ; and\r\n\r\n  To provide check points on known routes through the zone and\r\n  observation posts, especially during the hours of reduced\r\n  visibility, and telephone all suspicious incidents to Regimental\r\n  S-2.\r\n\r\nDMZ Police Company personnel operated in motorized patrol teams and\r\ntraveled the entire division sector in radio or cargo jeeps. One\r\nplatoon was kept on a standby basis at camp to serve as a mobile\r\nreserve in the event of an emergency. The roving patrols submitted\r\nreports of all incidents, which were then compiled in a company report.\r\nA copy was submitted to the S-2, the Northern Regiment, and 1st Marine\r\nDivision G-2.\r\n\r\nUNC security measures at all times were strict and uncompromising in\r\nthe Korean DMZ buffer zone. This included the salvage period, the\r\nBIG SWITCH prisoner exchange that took place within the division\r\nsector at Freedom Village from 5 August-6 September, and the lengthy\r\nnonrepatriate POW settlement that extended through January 1954. In\r\nplaces where the military demarcation line was not marked on the ground\r\nor clearly recognizable, the conservative ruling was to stay at least\r\n500 yards south of its estimated location. This applied both to body\r\nrecovery and salvage operations. The No-Fly line was scrupulously\r\nverified.\r\n\r\nAlleged violations charged by the CCF/NKPA were checked out with\r\nthe Marine ground observation posts set up in August to record all\r\nmovements of fixed-wing (reconnaissance) and rotary aircraft in the\r\narea. Helicopters were allowed to fly in the DMZ but no closer than the\r\n500 yard limit from the MDL. Helicopters operating forward of CPs of\r\n5th Marines units having sector responsibility were required to obtain\r\nclearance from the ground unit concerned for each flight. Medical\r\nevacuation copters, generally, were exempted from this restriction and\r\nauthorized a standing clearance.\r\n\r\nCommitments for the DMZ Police Company increased substantially with\r\narrival of the nonrepatriated POWs at their camp in the DMZ corridor\r\nwest of the 2d Battalion, 5th Marines area. The Communist “explainers,”\r\nas well as Polish and Czech members of the neutral Nations Commission,\r\nhad to be escorted while in the UN half of the DMZ. This required that\r\na 24-hour checkpoint and escort cadre be established in the zone. As\r\nthe number of enemy sightings, a daily occurrence in the DMZ, continued\r\nto increase, the size of the police patrols increased correspondingly.\r\nA typical example was related by a member of the police company:\r\n\r\n  It was common practice of the Communists to have a group of\r\n  their men, supposedly their DMZ Police, walk up to the Military\r\n  Demarcation Line and either stand close to it or step across.\r\n  When one of our patrols approached in superior numbers to\r\n  attempt to apprehend them, the Communists would immediately\r\n  reinforce with more men. This made it necessary to have our\r\n  patrols at sufficient strength that they could protect themselves\r\n  from being kidnapped.[674]\r\n\r\n    [674] Demilitarized Zone Police Co/5 rpt, p. 4, in 5thMar Hist,\r\n          Folder #4, _op. cit._\r\n\r\nAs these requirements for security increased, the original complement\r\nof approximately 5 officers and 99 men became inadequate to patrol\r\nthe DMZ. By late October the T/O strength of the 1st Provisional\r\nDemilitarized Zone Police Company had been increased to 6 officers and\r\n314 men. Authorization for the number of police personnel on duty in\r\nthe DMZ had similarly been augmented from 50 to 175.\r\n\r\nDuring the September salvage operations, five Marines in the DMZ were\r\ntaken into custody by the Chinese Communists. Charged with being in\r\nunauthorized territory and violating terms of the armistice agreement,\r\nthey were later returned to United Nations jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Organization of New Defense Positions_[675]\r\n\r\n    [675] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: 1stMarDiv ComdDs Jul-Sep 53; 1stMarDiv Type\r\n          “C” Rpt Defense of “C” Sector, 27 Jul-31 Oct 53, Folder\r\n          #3 (this and following 1stMarDiv end-of-war records\r\n          retired in 61 A2265, Box 74, FRC, Suitland, Md.); 1stMar\r\n          Hist of Defense of “D” Sector, 27 Jul-31 Oct 53, Folder\r\n          #3 (contains brief histories of individual units); 5thMar\r\n          Hist of Defense of “D” Sector, 27 Jul-31 Oct 53, in\r\n          Folders #3 and #4; 7thMar Hist of Defense of “D” Sector,\r\n          27 Jul 53–10 Feb 54, in Folder #5; 1stMarDiv Type “C” Rpt\r\n          Defense of “C” Div Sect, 27 July-31 Dec 53, Folder #6\r\n          (containing, among others, brief rpts 11thMar, 1st TkBn,\r\n          1st EngrBn, 1stMTBn, 7th MTBn, 1st KMC Rgt, 2d KMC Rgt).\r\n\r\nUpon withdrawal from the demilitarized zone and organization of the\r\nMBP, the Eighth Army established its plan for defense on a wide front.\r\nThis was based on the organization of strongpoints disposed in depth,\r\nwith planned counterattacks by mobile reserves.\r\n\r\nAs it had during active hostilities, the 1st Marine Division in the\r\npost-armistice period continued as one of the four UNC divisions\r\nmanning the general outpost and MBP in the U.S. I Corps sector.\r\nImmediately east of the division was its long-time neighbor, the 1st\r\nCommonwealth Division. Still further east in I Corps were the 1st ROK\r\nand U.S. 7th Infantry Divisions.\r\n\r\nSince 1 August, the Marine division had continued to outpost the most\r\nfavorable terrain in its sector below the southern boundary of the\r\nDMZ. The division manned the No-Pass Line and prepared its defenses\r\nto resume full scale military operations, if necessary. The Munsan-ni\r\nProvisional Command, composed of the Marine-Navy-Army personnel\r\nresponsible for implementing the final prisoner exchange, was also\r\nheadquartered in the 1st Marine Division sector.\r\n\r\nThe strongpoint organization of the division’s main battle position\r\nwas accomplished by the deployment of the 5th Marines at the general\r\noutpost line of resistance (or OPLR, a term and concept not in use\r\nsince April 1952). The outpost defense concept embodied a number\r\nof forward positions, lightly held in actual numbers of men but\r\nstrongly defended in numbers of automatic weapons and firepower.\r\n(This capability was possible due to the excess number of automatic\r\nweapons on hand, above normal T/E allowances, which previously had\r\nbeen required by MLR defenses.) In the organization of the positions,\r\nemphasis was placed on construction of bunkered observation posts, the\r\nemplacement of automatic weapons with flanking fires, and clearing of\r\nfields of fire for these weapons.\r\n\r\nBasically, the general concept of OPLR defense was to establish\r\nmutually supporting defensive positions across the front, as well as to\r\ndevelop additional defense in depth positions whose strength increased\r\nfrom front to rear. The positions thus formed successive defense lines,\r\nfrom the southern DMZ boundary--the new Marine division front--south\r\nto the KANSAS Line, the Main Battle Position. (These defense lines\r\nwere the old secondary defensive lines of WYOMING, KANSAS, and KANSAS\r\nSWITCH.) The KMC, 1st Marines, 7th Marines, and other units located\r\nin the KANSAS vicinity engaged in bunker construction and trench\r\nimprovement. Battalion fire plans coordinated the organic, attached,\r\nand supporting weapons. Construction of the new positions and\r\ndevelopment of the KANSAS Line would be a continuing process throughout\r\nthe rest of the year.\r\n\r\nThe 1st Marines received the assignment of developing the blocking\r\npositions, most of these battalion-sized strongpoints. As in the past,\r\ndivision support units continued to be located in the old rear supply\r\nareas south of the Imjin. In early August the division had stationed\r\nthe 7th Marines in the right sector; the 1st KMC in the center; and\r\nthe 1st Marines, to the south of the KMC sector. The 11th Marines,\r\nto the rear of the 7th Marines, had displaced its artillery, relaid,\r\nand was prepared to fire in support of the general outpost and MBP.\r\n(Map 35.) Additional artillery battalions included I Corps and army\r\nunits. Essentially these were the positions held until early October\r\nwhen, during a period of political unrest resulting from the prisoner\r\nexchange, the 1st Marines relieved the 1st KMC/RCT in the center\r\nsector (which held the southern approaches to Freedom Bridge and the\r\nnonrepatriate war compound). The Korean unit then relocated to blocking\r\npositions and assumed the mission of reserve regiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAP 35      K. WHITE\r\n             E. WILSON\r\n\r\n1st MARINE DIVISION\r\n\r\nPOST-ARMISTICE MAIN BATTLE POSITION\r\n\r\n30 SEPTEMBER 1953]\r\n\r\nMarine support units--motor transport, tank, service, medical, aerial\r\nliaison (VMO/HMR)--were in the same general rear area, as was the\r\nheadquarters of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division. The Marine Division\r\nCP continued to be located at Yongji-ri, although construction of a\r\nnew site further south at Chormyon was due to be completed by engineer\r\npersonnel on 1 October. The division railhead and truckhead remained,\r\nrespectively, at Munsan-ni and Ascom City. To the left of the KMC\r\nsector was the 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion. Still further west,\r\nseparated from other units by the Han River, was the Kimpo Provisional\r\nRegiment, in its former wartime sector.\r\n\r\nAs the division OPLR regiment, the 5th Marines held a line 36,000 yards\r\nin length--about 21 miles--roughly corresponding to the front manned\r\nby three regiments during the war. The OPLR sector included the entire\r\narea in the divisional zone of responsibility north of the Imjin.\r\nBoundaries of the 5th Marines territory were the southern DMZ truce\r\nline on the west and north, the Samichon River to the east, and that\r\nmajor water barrier, the curving Imjin River, to the rear.\r\n\r\nAfter establishment of the DMZ, the division occupied unfavorable low\r\nground poorly suited to the defense and inferior to that held by the\r\nenemy--continuing the same situation that had existed during the period\r\nof stabilized combat operations in West Korea. Almost without exception\r\nthe southern boundary of the DMZ prohibited the Marines from moving\r\nonto the commanding terrain, as the No-Pass Line was behind or along\r\nthe reverse slopes of the high ground. On the other hand, in most cases\r\nthe CCF had the advantage of having forward slope positions as well as\r\nthe crests plus most of the commanding terrain in the area.\r\n\r\nCommunist territory in the northern DMZ sector included the former\r\nstrongholds of Yoke, Bunker Hill, Carson, Reno, Vegas, Berlin, East\r\nBerlin and Warsaw. Within the Marine division postwar area were the\r\nPanmunjom Corridor and outposts Marilyn, Kate, the Boulder City hills,\r\nand the Hook. Much of the terrain between the major hill positions\r\nalong the 5th Marines regimental front and the Imjin River consisted of\r\nlow-rolling hills rising abruptly out of the rice paddies.\r\n\r\nConstruction of new positions and the defense system of the 5th\r\nMarines was based on several assumptions about enemy capabilities,\r\nmade by G-2 and the new regimental CO, Colonel Rathvon McC. Tompkins,\r\nwho had assumed command on 2 August. These were: that in the event\r\nof resumption of hostilities by the CCF the enemy would use his jet\r\nfighters and bombers in support of operations; that he would continue\r\nto have numerical superiority in artillery; and that the northern\r\noutpost regiment would have no reinforcement or surface resupply from\r\nunits south of the Imjin.\r\n\r\nThe defense plan for the forward part of the 5th Marines sector in\r\nevent of a resumption of hostilities called for furnishing patrols\r\nequipped with radios and FO teams to occupy Hills 155, 229, and 181.\r\n(Hill 155 was directly south of the DMZ in the 2/5 left battalion\r\nsector; Hills 229 and 181 were, respectively, just inside and just\r\noutside the southern boundary of the truce line in the center 1/5\r\nsector.) From these three elevations the patrols would then have the\r\nmission of bringing down artillery fire on enemy concentrations and\r\nrelaying communications about the situation to the friendly main attack\r\nforce. Other critical hill masses in the OPLR regimental sector were\r\nHill 126 (in the 3/5 eastern battalion sector, just inside the Marine\r\nside of the DMZ) and Hill 163, in the Hook area. The latter hill was\r\nnot as suitable for defense since it was located south of the military\r\ndemarcation line and was thus less accessible.\r\n\r\nThese hill masses so completely dominated the major enemy approaches\r\nthrough the division sector to the Imjin, the lower river crossing\r\nsites and bridges, that their occupation by Marine personnel was\r\nconsidered essential in the event of any attack. Hill 229, adjacent to\r\nthe Chan-dang corridor and part of the 229-181 axis, was considered the\r\nmost critical terrain feature in the entire northern section.\r\n\r\nKey areas to the rear of the 5th Marines’ sector were the two operating\r\nbridges (Freedom in 2/5 territory and Libby on the 3/5 right) and the\r\ntwo interior crossing sites (Honker and Spoonbill). All provided access\r\nto the Imjin and division support units deployed on the south side of\r\nthe river. In the event of threatened hostile attack, the Northern\r\nRegiment was under orders to destroy the bridges to prevent their use\r\nby the enemy on any attempted advance to the rear.\r\n\r\nStrong perimeter defenses, called “Bridgehead Positions” were to be\r\nbuilt by 5th Marines’ battalions. Two were to protect the two bridges\r\nand a third, to include both ferry sites. Between the forward defended\r\nlocalities and the rear bridgehead positions, alternate and secondary\r\nsites were organized to create mutually supporting defenses in depth.\r\nThe bridgeheads were a combination of linear and strongpoint defense,\r\ncapable of withstanding severe pressure.\r\n\r\nOrganization of the defensive positions in the 5th Marine sector\r\nwas complicated both by peculiarities of the terrain and political\r\nrestrictions due to proximity of the DMZ. In addition to the regiment’s\r\nexcess frontage, the demilitarized zone immediately to the front\r\nprecluded use of either aerial or motorized reconnaissance for early\r\nwarning. Security measures for the OPLR were less than ideal. Neither\r\nproper patrols nor a covering force in front of the OPLR was possible;\r\nthe best that could be done was to maintain patrols along the friendly\r\nside of the No-Pass Line.\r\n\r\nAs the regimental left battalion pointed out: “Location of the DMZ and\r\nthe No-Pass Line made the trace of the OPLR follow an artificial and\r\narbitrary line rather than that of the best terrain.”[676] The most\r\ncritical terrain feature in the sector, Hill 155, was located just\r\noutside the southern boundary of the DMZ. Although its possession was\r\nessential to successful defense of the OPLR and the bridgehead defense\r\npositions being developed to the interior and rear of the battalion\r\nsector, Hill 155 could not be occupied because of the armistice\r\nagreement. The solution to the problem was simply to occupy the best\r\nground adjacent to the No-Pass Line.\r\n\r\n    [676] 2/5 Hist, in 5thMar Hist, dtd 12 Dec 53, p. 4, Folder #4.\r\n\r\nPlacement of automatic weapons was a factor of great importance in\r\norganizing the defensive positions. In order to accomplish the mission\r\nof an OPLR, weapons had to be situated to bring the enemy under fire at\r\nmaximum ranges. Accordingly, machine guns and other weapons were placed\r\non high ground well to the front. Some Marines commented that:\r\n\r\n  Many individuals having the MLR concept in mind insisted that\r\n  weapons should be located forward on low ground to provide\r\n  grazing fire. A period of education was required. For the same\r\n  reason, it was necessary to place 81mm mortar and 4.2-inch mortar\r\n  positions further forward than they would normally be in support\r\n  of the MLR.[677]\r\n\r\n    [677] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nThe problem of establishing depth to the defensive positions was never\r\nsolved to the satisfaction of everyone. This was due primarily to the\r\nextended front which necessitated using more units for support elements\r\nthan would normally be done. This situation was partly alleviated by\r\nestablishing some unit defensive sectors further to the rear in the\r\ncompany areas.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty was the inadequate allocation of ammunition:\r\none-half JAMESTOWN load on position, and another half-load available\r\nat the regimental dump. The JAMESTOWN load unit had been developed for\r\nuse in a stabilized defense situation where automatic weapons were\r\naimed as the enemy came in close proximity to the MLR. On the other\r\nhand, OPLR machine guns and weapons were required to open up at maximum\r\nranges and might well be fired for extended periods of time. It was\r\ncalculated that A4 machine guns firing at medium rate (75 rpm) would\r\nexpend the one-half JAMESTOWN load in 22 minutes, while an A1 machine\r\ngun at medium rate (125 rpm) would exhaust the same load in 13 minutes.\r\nA partial improvement was obtained by moving the ammunition loads from\r\nregimental to battalion dumps although the basic problem of limited\r\nallocation--shared also by rear infantry regiments--continued to exist.\r\n\r\nAn unique situation that had confronted the 2d Battalion and at times\r\nthe adjoining 1st Battalion stemmed from the large numbers of Army\r\nengineer personnel building the nonrepatriate POW camp in the DMZ\r\nimmediately west of the 2/5 sector. During August and the first part of\r\nSeptember, the area in front of 2/5 had been used as a base camp for\r\n5,000–7,000 construction personnel. Although their area was crowded\r\nwith these additional units, the Marine battalions could not exercise\r\nany control over them. The Marines were still responsible for security\r\nof the sector, however. Presence of as many as 22,000 nonrepatriate\r\nCCF and NKPA prisoners as well as the Indian custodial forces further\r\ncomplicated the matter. It was noted that:\r\n\r\n  At the same time the Army engineers were building the camp, the\r\n  prisoners were situated in the middle of the 2/5 area and the MSR\r\n  to Panmunjom led completely across the battalion position into\r\n  the 1/5 sector [and thence] into the DMZ. Upon completion of the\r\n  camp, the engineers withdrew from the area but as they withdrew\r\n  the 5,500 troops of the Custodial Forces India were brought in\r\n  to guard the nonrepatriate prisoners. With the arrival of the\r\n  prisoners, the number of personnel in the regiment’s sector\r\n  of responsibility rose to 28,000–30,000. Thus, the problem of\r\n  having a GOP mission and at the same time having never less than\r\n  5,000 and as many as 30,000 friendly, neutral, and/or prisoner\r\n  personnel in front of our most forward defended localities was\r\n  always present.[678]\r\n\r\n    [678] 5thMar Hist, pp. 6–7, Folder #3.\r\n\r\nCamp construction and development of the new positions south of the\r\nriver continued at a furious pace from August through early October.\r\nSince the new camp sites were in civilian populated areas, “it was\r\nnecessary to secure real estate clearance before they could be\r\noccupied or improved.”[679] After clearance was obtained on 29 July,\r\ndivision engineers immediately began work on five separate camps.\r\nThese camp building activities and reconnaissance of assigned blocking\r\npositions continued until 10 August. At this time, construction began\r\non the major blocking positions, so organized and developed as to be\r\nself-sustaining for several days. Whether squad, platoon, or company,\r\nall positions were organized using a perimeter type defense and were\r\nmutually supporting laterally and in depth. Connecting trenches,\r\nbunkers, ammunition holes, and tank slots were also built.\r\n\r\n    [679] 1st EngrBn Rpt, Operations during 27 Jul-31 Oct 53, dtd\r\n          19 Apr 53, p. 4, Folder #6.\r\n\r\nBy early October, construction of the blocking positions was completed\r\nby the 1st Marines despite the fierce summer heat, the numerous rock\r\nformations in the area that were difficult to dig out with limited\r\ntools and demolitions, and the shortage of personnel due to units\r\nparticipating in the new series of division MARLEX exercises, resumed\r\nin October. Within three months, the Marine division had thus largely\r\ncompleted building of a solid defense in its new main battle position.\r\nThe importance of maintaining combat readiness for any renewed\r\nhostility on the part of the enemy demanded continuing vigilance at all\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nDefense specifications throughout the 5th Marines northern general\r\noutpost sector called for some 1,560 individual fighting positions,\r\n400 automatic weapons sites, 8 bunkered infantry OPs, 30 bunkered\r\nCPs, 15,400 yards of trenchlines, and 70,000 yards of protective\r\nand tactical wire. In construction of the MBP, all bunkers were so\r\nblended and camouflaged with the natural terrain that they were almost\r\nimpossible to be seen.\r\n\r\nTo the division rear, the location of recoilless rifle positions, FDC\r\nbunkers, and tank slots in the blocking positions and bridgeheads was\r\nthe major priority. In the antimechanized defense plan, tanks covered\r\nlikely avenues of approach into the general outpost area and also\r\noverlooked critical river crossing sites. Wherever possible old firing\r\npositions which had been previously prepared to support the secondary\r\nlines WYOMING and KANSAS were utilized. By the end of the year, 204\r\ntank firing positions had been emplaced throughout the Marine division\r\nsector.\r\n\r\nThree rehearsals for the occupation of the main battle position were\r\nheld by the 1st Marine Division in September. All division units,\r\nboth combat and service, participated in these exercises. Tactical\r\nunits were required to occupy the MBP and be fully prepared for combat\r\non four hours’ notice; service units were to provide additional\r\nlocal security required for the elimination of enemy infiltrators or\r\nguerrilla agents. Divisional and I Corps test exercises indicated\r\nthat three hours were necessary to man the MBP during daylight and\r\napproximately three and one half hours at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Postwar Employment of Marine Units in_ FECOM[680]\r\n\r\n    [680] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, Chap. 10; AnlRpt\r\n          CMC to SecNav for FY 1954, dtd 11 Aug 54; AnlRpt CMC\r\n          to SecNav for FY 1955, dtd 15 Aug 55; 1st MAW ComdDs,\r\n          Aug-Sep 53; MAGs-12, -33 ComdDs, Aug-Sep 53; MSgt Roy E.\r\n          Heinecke, “Four Star Visit,” _Leatherneck_, v. 37, no. 1\r\n          (Jan 54).\r\n\r\nThe 1st Marine Aircraft Wing Post-Armistice Plan, as part of Fifth\r\nAir Force operations, was effective at 2200, on 27 July. Its purpose,\r\nbasically, was to insure that wing elements carried out provisions of\r\nthe armistice and yet continued to maintain a high level of combat\r\nreadiness in the uneasy truce period.\r\n\r\nTwo major operational restrictions had been imposed on the UNC air\r\nforce by the armistice. The first was establishment of the “No-Fly\r\nLine” south of the Allied southern boundary of the DMZ. Any flight\r\nbeyond that point had to be authorized by JOC and a barrier patrol was\r\nmaintained by FAF to apprehend any violators of the truce provisions.\r\nThe 1st MAW contribution to this aerial security team was night patrols\r\nperformed by F3D-2s from VMF(N)-513 and radar-configured AD aircraft\r\nfrom VMC-1 (later, by the new VMA-251 squadron).\r\n\r\nThe second post-truce restriction, which affected wing logistic\r\nmovements, limited the entry and departure of all Korean air traffic\r\nto five airfields. These aerial ports were K-2, K-8, K-9, K-14, and\r\nK-18. (K-16 was later added.) Neither K-3, the east coast home field of\r\nMAG-33 nor K-6, located just inland from the west coast and the site of\r\nMAG-12 operations, was included. All Marine traffic landed either at\r\nK-9 or K-2 for inventory, a procedure which subsequently developed into\r\na bottleneck, and caused supply delays due to the substantial reduction\r\nin payload made to accommodate the necessary extra fuel due to greater\r\noverland distances between airfields. When the CG, 1st MAW requested\r\nthat K-3 be made a port of entry to avoid the difficulties involved in\r\nuse of the two FAF fields, ComNavFE disapproved the request with the\r\nfollowing rationale:\r\n\r\n  ComNavFE feels that to ask for designation of K-3 as an\r\n  additional port of entry would be politically inadvisable. It\r\n  would provide the Communists with a basis for a propaganda claim\r\n  that the United Nations were attempting to further delay an\r\n  armistice agreement. Should the Communists propose an additional\r\n  port of entry for their side, COMNAVFE states the UN Military\r\n  Armistice Commission will offer designation of K-3 as a _quid pro\r\n  quo_.[681]\r\n\r\n    [681] _PacFlt EvalRpt_, No. 6, p. 10-74.\r\n\r\nRemoval from Korea to Japan of operational combat aircraft for routine\r\nmaintenance runs and their return thus had to be made through the same\r\nport of exit and reentry. Inspections were conducted by the USAF combat\r\naircraft control officer at the port.\r\n\r\nThe post-truce 1st MAW mission, in part, comprised the following:\r\n\r\n  ... to maintain assigned forces in a state of combat\r\n  readiness, provide for security of assigned forces, areas,\r\n  and installations; observe the conditions of the Armistice\r\n  Agreement; support other elements of the United Nations Command\r\n  as required; be prepared to counter any attempt on the part\r\n  of the enemy to resume active hostilities; continue current\r\n  missions other than combat; insure that 1st MAW personnel and\r\n  combat material are not increased beyond the level present at\r\n  the instant of the effective time of the Armistice Agreement;\r\n  submit reports on 1st MAW personnel and controlled items of Wing\r\n  equipment entering or leaving Korea; be prepared to disperse\r\n  air units within or from Korea as necessary to provide maximum\r\n  security during an Armistice....[682]\r\n\r\n    [682] 1st MAW ComdD, Aug 53, Folder #1, p. 1.\r\n\r\nThe strict interpretation of replacing combat aircraft, armored\r\nvehicles, weapons, and ammunition that were destroyed, worn out, or\r\nused up during the period of armistice was, of course, due to the\r\nsensitive political considerations. It was felt that replacement of\r\ncombat equipment by UNC forces:\r\n\r\n  ... would result in the Communists adopting the same liberal\r\n  interpretation which is undesirable since it will lessen the\r\n  control of combat material in North Korea and could permit\r\n  them to replace phenomenal unauthorized quantities of material\r\n  damaged, destroyed, worn out or used up prior to the effective\r\n  date of the Armistice Agreement.[683]\r\n\r\n    [683] 1st MAW ComdD, Aug 53, Folder #2, msg ComNavFE to all\r\n          units, dtd 16 Aug 53.\r\n\r\nIn August, postwar procedures were mapped out for 1st MAW personnel,\r\nas part of the overall quota limitations prescribed by FECOM (Far\r\nEast Command) through FEAF and FAF echelons. A 1st MAW headquarters\r\nsection, designated as 1st MAW, rear echelon, was established at Itami\r\nAFB, Japan, two hours’ flight from Korea. All incoming or outgoing\r\naviation personnel on permanent change of station orders were to report\r\nto the rear echelon, 1st MAW. Announcement of Marine Corps plans to\r\ninitiate future postwar rotation on a stretch-out basis (for both air\r\nand ground personnel) was also made in August. Preliminary plans called\r\nfor changing the current 11-month combat tour in Korea to 14 months by\r\nMarch 1954, and possibly 16-month tours by July 1954, if extension of\r\nKorean service proved necessary. As with division personnel, monthly\r\ncumulative arrivals were not to exceed the number of departing aviation\r\nMarines. The quota set by FEAF for 1st MAW rotation for the month of\r\nAugust was 600, compared to the Marine division quota of 3,000 for\r\nground personnel.\r\n\r\nWith the 1st Marine Division engaged for an unknown length of time\r\nin its postwar mission as an occupation force and 1st MAW units\r\ncontinuing to operate under FAF in Korea, new Marine ground and\r\nair units were assigned to the Far East theater shortly after the\r\nconclusion of Korean hostilities. On 23 July, the 3d Marine Division,\r\ntogether with supporting air units, was readied for deployment from\r\nCamp Pendleton to Japan the following month. On 13 August the division\r\nCP was opened afloat and units proceeded to Japan between 16–30 August.\r\nThe mission of this division and the two major air units, MAGs-11\r\nand -16, was to maintain a high state of readiness in the Far East\r\nCommand and to assist in the air defense of Japan. As explained by the\r\nCommandant, their redeployment was accomplished “in order to provide\r\nthe amphibious capability which is an important element of national\r\nstrategy in that predominantly maritime theater.”[684]\r\n\r\n    [684] AnlRpt CMC to SecNav for FY 1954, dtd 11 Aug. 54, p. II-2.\r\n\r\nThe new Marine units thus joined in the Pacific, the 1st Provisional\r\nMarine Air-Ground Task Force[685] that had been activated in Kaneohe,\r\nHawaii in January of 1953. Commanded by Brigadier General James P.\r\nRisely, it was to include a headquarters company, reinforced regiment,\r\nand reinforced aircraft group. The special task force was designated\r\nas a hard-hitting, air-ground team that could respond immediately as a\r\nforce-in-readiness to any emergency in the Pacific area.\r\n\r\n    [685] The Task Force was subsequently redesignated as the 1st\r\n          Marine Brigade, FMF, in May 1956.\r\n\r\nCommanded by Major General Robert H. Pepper, the 21,100-man 3d Marine\r\nDivision was called the “Three-Dimensional Division,” in reference\r\nto its training in airborne, amphibious, and atomic warfare. Within\r\nsix months, its components were to stretch from Kobe to Tokyo, with\r\ndivision headquarters and the 9th Marines at Gifu, the 4th Marines at\r\nNara, and other units at Otsu.\r\n\r\nNew Marine air units, which included Marine Transport Squadron 253\r\nand Marine Observation Squadron 2, as well as MAGs-11 and -16, all\r\ncame under 1st MAW operational control. Commanded by Colonel John\r\nD. Harshberger, the all-jet MAG-11, formerly based at Edenton,\r\nN.C., arrived at NAS Atsugi on 10 September. It comprised three F9F\r\nsquadrons, VMFs-222, -224, and -314. Also at Atsugi, the Marine Corps\r\naerial gateway to Japan, was the new transport squadron, VMR-253,\r\ncommanded by Lieutenant Colonel Carl J. Fleps, which reported in to\r\nCG, 1st MAW, on 16 August. Following numerous FMFPac requests for\r\nadditional air transport capability, the Commandant had authorized\r\ntransfer of the squadron from El Toro to assist the veteran wartime\r\ncarrier VMR-152 in the enormous postwar airlift program.\r\n\r\nFlying new R4Q Fairchild Packets, which could carry 42 troops, the\r\nsquadron from August to May 1954 logged more than 5,000,000 passenger\r\nmiles in transporting Marine replacements for the 1st and 3d Marine\r\nDivisions. Additional air capability was provided by Marine Helicopter\r\nTransport Group 16 (at Hanshin AFB) under Colonel Harold J. Mitchener,\r\nwith its two HRS-2 (HMR-162, HMR-163) and service squadrons (MAMs-16,\r\nMABS-16) and VMO-2, commanded by Major William G. MacLean (based at\r\nItami). Both units reported to 1st MAW and FECOM on 13 August.\r\n\r\nMajor command changes within the 1st MAW that month were: Brigadier\r\nGeneral Verne J. McCaul, vice Brigadier General Alexander W. Kreiser,\r\nJr. as ACG, 1st MAW, effective 16 August; and Colonel William F.\r\nHausman, vice Colonel Carney, CO, MAG-12, on 8 August. (The new MAG-33\r\nCO, Colonel Smith, had succeeded Colonel Stacy in late July.)\r\n\r\nIn the immediate post-armistice period, extensive training programs\r\nwere instituted by MAGs-12 and -33 to maintain high operational\r\nefficiency. Marine aircraft remained on JOC alert as required by the\r\nFifth Air Force and flew training missions scheduled by 1st MAW and\r\nFAF. These consisted of practice strikes against heavily-defended\r\ntargets, practice CAS for Eighth Army units, GCI (ground control\r\nintercept) flights under MGCIS-3 control, and bombing practice using\r\nthe Naktong Bombing Range. Other training sorties were scheduled\r\nin reconnaissance navigation, weather penetration, determining\r\nfuel bingos,[686] target location and identification, air defense\r\npatrolling, and coordination of tactical procedures in the target area.\r\nThe training schedules provided a well-balanced indoctrination program\r\nfor new squadron flight leaders, pilots, radar operators, and other\r\ncrew members arriving in Korea on the postwar personnel drafts.\r\n\r\n    [686] A fuel bingo is the amount of fuel needed by a pilot to\r\n          reach home base plus enough additional fuel to divert to\r\n          an alternate airfield.\r\n\r\nA new work day schedule of 0700–1500 implemented in August made more\r\ntime available for athletics, swimming, studying, and R&R (Rest &\r\nRecreation). That same month the MAG-12 softball team won the Fifth Air\r\nForce “All Korea” softball championship. Following this achievement,\r\nthe team left for Japan to compete in the FAF “Far East” softball\r\ntournament which included teams from all the major Pacific bases.\r\nSubsequently, the K-6 players “disguised in Air Force uniforms, went\r\nonward and upward to become FEAF champions in September.”[687] MAG-33\r\npilots, meanwhile, participated in Operation SPYGLASS, a FAF training\r\nexercise in August and Operation BACK DOOR, the following month.\r\nBoth emphasized interception flying and work with GCI squadrons. As\r\n“aggressors,” the Pohang-based airmen made simulated attacks on South\r\nKorean targets “defended” by Air Force and other land-based Marine\r\nunits. In October, MAG-33 pilots flew CAS missions for the 1st Marine\r\nDivision training problem, MARLEX IV, a battalion landing exercise\r\nstaged by 1/7 on Tokchok-to Island. Beginning that month a new\r\nprocedure was inaugurated by MAG-33 and the recently-arrived MAG-11.\r\nEvery week, four MAG-11 pilots came to Korea for a week of orientation\r\nflying with a MAG-33 squadron to gain a better picture of typical\r\nflying conditions in the Korean theater.\r\n\r\n    [687] Field, _NavOps, Korea_, pp. 456–457.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1955 the 1st Marine Division, which had been in the Korean\r\nfront lines almost continuously since September 1950, returned to\r\nCamp Pendleton. Redeployment by echelons began in February. By June,\r\nall units had returned to CONUS. The transfer from Korean occupation\r\nduty was effected in order that the division’s “valuable capability\r\nas a highly trained amphibious force in readiness may be fully\r\nrealized.”[688] Now under Major General Merrill B. Twining,[689] the\r\ndivision had been a part of Eighth Army occupying postwar defense\r\npositions in Korea until its relief on 17–18 March 1955 by the U.S.\r\n24th Infantry Division.\r\n\r\n    [688] AnlRpt of CMC to SecNav FY 1955, dtd 15 Aug 55, p. 3,\r\n          quoting statement made by SecDef in Dec 54 on forthcoming\r\n          departure of 1stMarDiv from FECOM.\r\n\r\n    [689] Postwar commanders of 1stMarDiv to date had been Major\r\n          General Robert H. Pepper, who succeeded General Pate, and\r\n          served from 12 May 54–22 Jul 54; Major General Robert\r\n          E. Hogaboom, 23 Jul 54–17 Jan 55; and General Twining,\r\n          beginning 18 Jan 55.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its official mission in the Eighth Army line, the 1st\r\nMarine Division had conducted an active small-unit amphibious training\r\nprogram during its postwar Korea duty. All but two of its infantry\r\nbattalions had carried out assault landings on Tokchok-to, off the\r\nKorean west coast south of Inchon, prior to its departure for the\r\nUnited States. The 3d Marine Division had also conducted an active\r\ntraining program, with numerous small-unit exercises and regimental\r\nlandings staged at Iwo Jima and Okinawa as part of its continuous\r\nreadiness conditioning.\r\n\r\nFor Marine air personnel, their official departure from Korea following\r\nthe 1st MAW wartime assignment there, came the next year. Beginning in\r\nJune 1956, initial units of the Marine aircraft wing were withdrawn\r\nfrom Korea and relocated at NAS Iwakuni, Japan. Plans called for the\r\nwing, then under Brigadier General Samuel S. Jack[690] and occupying\r\nbases in both Korea and Japan, to be permanently headquartered at\r\nIwakuni and revert to CinCPacFlt control. The wing remained on station\r\nin the Far East as a component of postwar United States defense\r\nstrength in that area.\r\n\r\n    [690] CGs, 1st MAW, in the immediate post-armistice period\r\n          were: Major General Megee, until 4 Dec 53; Major General\r\n          Albert D. Cooley, 5 Dec 53–25 Mar 54; Brigadier General\r\n          McCaul, 26 May 54–24 Aug 54; Brigadier General Marion L.\r\n          Dawson, 25 Aug 54–24 Sep 55; and Brigadier General Jack,\r\n          25 Sep 55–30 Jun 56.\r\n\r\nThe prewar Fifth Air Force and Eighth U.S. Army commands, under which\r\nMarine Corps air and ground units had functioned during the Korean\r\nWar, were permanently deployed in the Far East as operative military\r\nechelons. EUSAK-FAF transferred from its wartime JOC location at Seoul\r\nto Osan-ni in January 1954 and in September of that year relocated to\r\nNagoya, Japan. Eighth Army headquarters remained at Seoul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nKorean Reflection\r\n\r\n_Marine Corps Role and Contributions to the Korean War: Ground, Air,\r\nHelicopter--FMF and Readiness Posture--Problems Peculiar to the Korean\r\nWar--Korean Lessons_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marine Corps Role and Contribution to the Korean War: Ground_[691]\r\n\r\n    [691] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: U.S. Dept. of Defense, Semiannual Reports\r\n          of the Secretary of Defense, 1951–1954, hereafter _Rpt\r\n          of SecDef_; _PacFlt EvalRpts_, No. 6, Chaps. 9, 10, No.\r\n          5, Chaps. 8, 9, No. 4, Chaps. 9, 10; Marine Corps Board\r\n          Study, An Evaluation of the Influence of Marine Corps\r\n          Forces on the Course of the Korean War (4 Aug 50–15 Dec\r\n          50), vs. I and II, hereafter _USMC Board Rpt_, held in\r\n          James C.

These are the Pusan Perimeter defense\r\n(August-September 1950), Inchon-Seoul assault (September-October 1950),\r\nthe Chosin Reservoir campaign (October-December 1950), East-Central\r\nKorea (January 1951-March 1952), West Korea (March 1952-July 1953), and\r\nthe post-armistice period (July 1953-February 1955).\r\n\r\nMarine Corps traditional concepts of readiness and fast, effective\r\ndeployment were never better illustrated than in the hectic weeks\r\nfollowing 25 June 1950. The NKPA invasion of South Korea came at a\r\ntime when U.S. military forces were in the final stages of a cutback\r\nto peacetime size. Ships and planes were being “mothballed”; personnel\r\nof all the Armed Services were being reduced in number to the lowest\r\npossible effective manpower levels.\r\n\r\nFrom the peak of its six-division, five-wing wartime strength of\r\n475,600 in 1944–1945, the Marine Corps at the outbreak of the Korean\r\nemergency had only two skeletal divisions and two air wings. There\r\nwere but 74,279 Marines on active duty, 97 percent of the Marine Corps\r\nauthorized strength. Although a ceiling of 100,000 had been established\r\nfor the Corps by law, it was a period of tight purse strings for all\r\ndefense components. Fiscal austerity in the post-World War II period\r\nhad whittled Corps numbers from 85,000 in FY 1947 to what was projected\r\nat 67,000 by the end of FY 1950.\r\n\r\nThis critically reduced strength found the normal Marine triangular\r\ninfantry organization cut back to two companies per battalion, two\r\nbattalions per regiment, and two regiments per division. The 1st Marine\r\nDivision, at Camp Pendleton, and 2d Marine Division, at Camp Lejeune,\r\nwere structured along the regular peacetime T/O of 10,232 USMC/USN vice\r\nthe wartime minimum T/O of 22,355. No Marine units of any size were\r\nlocated in the Far East.\r\n\r\nDespite its lean numbers in late June 1950, the Marine Corps once\r\nagain would be in the forefront of American military response to the\r\nCommunist aggression 6,000 miles across the Pacific. As hard-pressed\r\nSouth Korean forces and understrength U.S. occupation troops from Japan\r\nattempted to halt the Communist invaders, General of the Army Douglas\r\nMacArthur, on 2 July, requested the JCS to send immediately a Marine\r\nRCT with supporting air to the Far East. On 7 July, the 1st Provisional\r\nMarine Brigade was formed at Camp Pendleton from units of the 1st\r\nDivision. Major components of the brigade--a balanced force of ground,\r\nservice, and aviation elements--were the 5th Marines and MAG-33. Five\r\ndays later, the 6,534-man brigade had mounted out from San Diego to\r\nanswer the CinCFE plea for Marines to help turn the Communist tide\r\nengulfing Korea.\r\n\r\nThe brigade buttressed the faltering UNC defense in the Pusan\r\nPerimeter. Employed as a mobile reserve it helped prevent three enemy\r\nbreakthroughs--at Chinju and the two Naktong River battles. On 7\r\nAugust, a month after its activation, the brigade launched an attack\r\ntoward Chinju. The Marine brigade was the first unit sent from CONUS\r\nto see combat in what was then considered a short-term police action.\r\nLater, in leading the way to destruction of an enemy bridgehead at the\r\nNaktong, the Marine brigade gave the defending Eighth Army its first\r\nvictory against the NKPA in the Korean conflict.\r\n\r\nEven before the brigade had been dispatched to the Far East, as the\r\nKorean situation continued to deteriorate, MacArthur had requested the\r\nJCS to expand the brigade to a full war-strength division. Between\r\n10–21 July MacArthur, now CinCUNC, had made three separate requests\r\nfor a Marine division. This persistence was reinforced by his growing\r\ndetermination to conduct a tactical amphibious operation to the rear of\r\nthe overextended NKPA lines and thereby seize the initiative from the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nIn the States, meanwhile, authorization was received to bring the badly\r\nunderstrength 1st and 2d Marine Divisions up to full 22,000-man war\r\nlevels. By stripping posts and stations, reassignment and rerouting\r\nof units, and callup of additional reserve personnel, major elements\r\nof the 1st Marine Division were on their way to Korea by mid-August.\r\nTiming was critical in order to meet the projected D-Day target date of\r\n15 September.\r\n\r\nPulled out of the Pusan line on 12 September, the brigade was absorbed\r\nby the newly arrived 1st Marine Division in preparation for the coming\r\nInchon invasion. As the brigade commander, Lieutenant General Edward A.\r\nCraig, USMC, later reminisced:\r\n\r\n  Although the 1st Provisional Brigade and the 1st MarDiv had never\r\n  actually trained or worked together, they still combined and\r\n  executed a successful landing. To me, this simply emphasized the\r\n  fine training and techniques laid down for amphibious landings by\r\n  the Marines.[692]\r\n\r\n    [692] _CheVron_, pp. 4–5.\r\n\r\nOrganized as a unit less than four months, the brigade left behind it\r\na reputation for mobility, effectiveness, and rapid deployment in the\r\nface of national emergency. Although Marine air and ground forces had\r\noperated together since 1919 in Haiti, formation of the 1st Provisional\r\nMarine Brigade “marked the first time that the air and ground elements,\r\ntask organized under a single commander, had engaged in combat.”[693]\r\n\r\n    [693] _Ibid._ Even though Marine air and ground forces had\r\n          on occasion operated jointly ever since the 1920s, air\r\n          support in the early days was considered a subsidiary\r\n          rather than integral part of the team. The doctrine of\r\n          Marine close air support was formulated in WW II but not\r\n          fully employed before the end of hostilities.\r\n\r\nIn the brilliant Inchon landing of 15 September 1950, Major General\r\nOliver P. Smith’s 1st Division Marines led the X Corps attack in the\r\nfirst major counterstroke by United Nations forces on Communist-held\r\nterritory. This maneuver was closely timed against enormous odds\r\nof personnel, logistics, and hydrography (tidal fluctuations of 31\r\nfeet) which made 15 September the only suitable assault date until\r\nmid-October. When outlined in earlier planning sessions by General\r\nMacArthur, the mammoth difficulties of the operation had been so\r\nunsettling that the designated Attack Force Commander for the landing,\r\nRear Admiral James H. Doyle, expressed the view that “the best I can\r\nsay is that Inchon is not impossible.”[694]\r\n\r\n    [694] Quoted in _USMC Ops Korea_, v. II, p. 46. Admiral Doyle\r\n          was Commander of Amphibious Forces for the Pacific Fleet.\r\n\r\nDespite all the difficulties, the landing at Inchon and recapture of\r\nSeoul, the South Korean Capital, and its adjacent Kimpo airfield by the\r\nMarines was a stunning tactical blow by the UNC that broke the backbone\r\nof the North Korean People’s Army 1950 offensive. The 1st Marine\r\nDivision, in its successfully executed amphibious landing, had offered\r\nUNC forces an opportunity to defeat the enemy decisively before a\r\nSiberian-like Korean winter set in. Accomplished under the most adverse\r\nweather and geographic conditions, the assault proved anew the decisive\r\npower of amphibious forces employed at a critical time and place. This\r\ncapability and readiness of the Marine Corps had totally reversed the\r\nmilitary situation, and a battered enemy was on the run. The subsequent\r\nrouting of the NKPA divisions in the Inchon-Seoul campaign by X Corps\r\nand the Eighth U.S. Army forces would have led to an early UN victory\r\nhad not the Chinese Communists intervened to support their Korean\r\ncounterparts. The operation had validated Far East Commander General\r\nMacArthur’s early premise that:\r\n\r\n  ... air and naval action alone could not be decisive, and that\r\n  nothing short of the intervention of U.S. ground forces could\r\n  give any assurance of stopping the Communists and of later\r\n  regaining the lost ground.[695]\r\n\r\n    [695] _Ibid._, p. 3.\r\n\r\nThe Inchon operation, moreover, had been planned in record\r\ntime--approximately 20 days. This was one of the shortest periods\r\never allotted to a major amphibious assault, involving the planning,\r\nassembly of shipping, and mounting out of a combined force of 29,000\r\nMarines and support personnel.\r\n\r\nWith the Inchon-Seoul operation ended, the 1st Marine Division\r\n(including the 7th Marines which had reached Inchon in time for the\r\nliberation of Seoul) reembarked on 12 October for deployment to the\r\neast coast of Korea. A new military operation was envisioned north of\r\nthe 38th Parallel against Pyongyang, the North Korean Capital. As part\r\nof the drive, X Corps was to make an amphibious envelopment on the east\r\ncoast, in the area of the enemy-held port of Wonsan. From here X Corps\r\nwould advance westward toward Pyongyang, to link up with Eighth Army\r\ntroops and trap NKPA forces withdrawing from the south.\r\n\r\nWhile the Marines were en route to the objective, word was received\r\nthat ROK troops had overrun Wonsan and were pushing north. The revised\r\nX Corps plan of operation called for a three-pronged attack towards the\r\nYalu. The Marine division would advance on the left, the U.S. Army 7th\r\nDivision in the center, and 1st ROK Division on the right flank. This\r\ndrive to the north and subsequent action at the Chosin Reservoir would\r\nrank as one of the most rigorous campaigns in the entire history of the\r\nMarine Corps.\r\n\r\nFighting as part of EUSAK, by this time fanned out throughout North\r\nKorea, the 1st Marine Division did not meet the expected NKPA\r\nresistance. Instead, large-scale Chinese Communist Forces had entered\r\nthe war. As X Corps swept north toward the Yalu River in November 1950,\r\nthe Marines became the first United States troops to defeat the Chinese\r\nCommunists in battle. At Sudong, after four days of savage fighting,\r\nthe Marine RCT-7 so badly crippled major elements of the 124th CCF\r\nDivision that it was never again committed as an organic unit.\r\n\r\nWhen the Chinese forces struck in full force at the Chosin Reservoir,\r\nX Corps units were forced back. Elements of a nine-division assault\r\nforce, the CCF 9th Army Group, which had been sent into Korea with\r\nthe specific mission of annihilating the 1st Marine Division, began\r\nto attack. On 27 November, the Chinese directed a massive frontal\r\nassault against 5th and 7th Marines positions at Yudam-ni, west of the\r\nreservoir. Another CCF division, moving up from the south, cut the MSR\r\nheld by the 1st Marines so that the division at Yudam-ni, west of the\r\nreservoir, was completely encircled by Communist forces. Many experts\r\nconsidered the 1st Marine Division as lost. Others thought the only\r\nway to save it was to airlift it out, leaving its equipment behind.\r\nInstead, the Marines seized the initiative at Yudam-ni and cut a path\r\nthrough CCF units blocking a route to Hagaru. The division battled its\r\nway out in 20-degree-below-zero weather 78 miles over icy, winding\r\nmountain roads from the reservoir to the Hamhung-Hungnam area where, on\r\n15 December, it redeployed to South Korea.\r\n\r\nIntegrated ground and air action enabled the 10,000 Marines and\r\nattached 4,000 Army-Royal Marine troops to break out of the entrapment\r\nand move south. During 13 tortuous days the Marines had withstood\r\nhostile strength representing elements of six to eight CCF divisions.\r\nThe major result, from the military view, was that the Marine division\r\nproperly evacuated its dead and wounded, brought out all operable\r\nequipment, and completed the retrograde movement with tactical\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\nNot only had the Chinese (with a total of 60,000 men in assault or\r\nreserve) failed to accomplish their mission, destruction of the\r\ndivision, but the Marine defenders had dealt a savage blow to the enemy\r\nin return. POW debriefings later revealed that assault units of the CCF\r\n9th Army Group had been rendered so militarily ineffective that nearly\r\nthree months were required for its replacement, re-equipment, and\r\nreorganization.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1951, the 1st Marine Division was reassigned to IX Corps for\r\nOperation KILLER, a limited offensive ordered by the EUSAK Commander,\r\nGeneral Matthew B. Ridgway. In Operation RIPPER, in March, the division\r\nled another IX Corps advance as it drove toward the 38th Parallel on\r\nthe east-central front. When the Chinese struck back with their spring\r\noffensive on 22 April, the Marines were transferred to operational\r\ncontrol of X Corps and counterattacked to restore the UNC defensive\r\nposition in the far eastern sector. During May and June, the 1st Marine\r\nDivision continued to punish the enemy in the Punchbowl area of eastern\r\nKorea, driving the CCF back to Yanggu and the Soyang River corridor.\r\n\r\nActivity all along the UNC front came to an uncertain halt in July 1951\r\nwhen Allied and Communist negotiators met at Kaesong for truce talks\r\ninitiated by the enemy. In August the MLR flared into action again, and\r\nthe Marine Division was engaged in new counterthrusts in the Punchbowl\r\narea. Fighting during the next three weeks involved the division in\r\nsome of its hardest offensive operations in Korea. It also developed\r\nthat this would be the last offensive for the Marines. In November\r\n1951, as a result of the truce talks and possibility of ending\r\nhostilities, General Ridgway, now UNC Commander, ordered the Eighth\r\nArmy to cease offensive operations and begin an active defense of the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nThe war of fire and movement had turned into one of positional warfare,\r\na defensive posture by UN forces that would continue for the last 21\r\nmonths of the three-year conflict. Throughout the winter of 1951–1952,\r\nthe Marines conducted vigorous patrol activities in their sector of X\r\nCorps. Although it was a lackluster period of trench warfare for the\r\naverage infantryman, major tactical innovations were being pioneered by\r\nthe division with its use of the transport helicopter for logistical\r\nand resupply missions.\r\n\r\nIn March 1952, the 1st Marine Division was transferred from the eastern\r\nX Corps line 140 miles west to strengthen the far end of the Eighth\r\nArmy MLR in the I Corps sector. The division was relocated in the\r\npath of the enemy’s invasion route to Seoul, where weak defenses in\r\nthe Kimpo coastal area had threatened the security of the UNC front.\r\nHere the division’s four infantry regiments (including the 1st Korean\r\nMarine Corps RCT) held nearly 35 miles of front line in the critical\r\nPanmunjom-Munsan area. The demilitarized route for the United Nations\r\nnegotiators led through the Marine lines. It was the most active sector\r\nof the UN front for the next 16 months. This key position guarded the\r\nbest routes of advance from North Korea to Seoul and indicated the high\r\nregard in which General James A. Van Fleet, EUSAK commander, held the\r\nMarines.\r\n\r\nWest Korean terrain was rugged, hilly, and friendly to the CCF who had\r\nthe advantage of high ground positions as well as considerably more\r\nmanpower. Although cast in an unaccustomed defensive warfare role,\r\nrather than a true attack mission, the Marines repelled an almost\r\ncontinuous series of enemy probes. While truce talks went on at nearby\r\nPanmunjom, fighting as furious as at any time earlier in the war\r\nflared up intermittently as the CCF tried to gain additional terrain\r\nfor bargaining purposes. During 1952–1953, the Marine division beat\r\noff determined CCF limited objective attacks on Bunker Hill, the Hook,\r\nVegas, and Boulder City outposts up until--literally--the final day of\r\nthe war, 27 July 1953.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing Marine actions during this period, the Secretary of the\r\nNavy commented:\r\n\r\n  Marines in Korea have established an enviable record of success\r\n  in carrying out their assigned missions. The First Marine\r\n  Division began its third year in Korea holding an active sector\r\n  of the United Nations front guarding the enemy’s invasion route\r\n  to Seoul. It was frequently subjected to fanatical Chinese\r\n  attacks supported by intensive artillery fire. Some of the\r\n  heaviest fighting during the year took place along the front\r\n  held by this Division. Enemy attacks were well coordinated and\r\n  numerically strong. Continued patrol activity to keep the enemy\r\n  off balance frequently resulted in bitter hand-to-hand fighting\r\n  with numerous casualties on both sides.[696]\r\n\r\n    [696] Semianl Rpt of SecNav (1 Jan-30 Jun) 1953, p. 185.\r\n\r\nThis type of prolonged static warfare gave little real satisfaction\r\nto Marines accustomed to waging a war of movement and a more tangible\r\n“mission accomplished.” The year of positional warfare in western Korea\r\nwas costly, too. Total U.S. casualties in the Korean War numbered\r\napproximately 137,000 men killed, missing, or wounded. The Marine\r\nCorps toll was 30,544. Of this number, 4,262 were KIA, an additional\r\n244 were listed as non-battle deaths, and 26,038 were wounded. During\r\nthis last part of the war, Marine casualties (both ground and air)\r\ntotaled 13,087, plus an additional 2,529 for the attached 1st KMC/RCT.\r\nAstonishingly, 1,586 Marines or 39.6 percent[697] of the infantry\r\nMarines killed in the entire war were victims of the “static,” outpost\r\nwarfare in the west. Another 11,244 were listed WIA during this\r\nperiod--representing 43.9 percent of the total number of ground Marines\r\nwounded during the three years of conflict.\r\n\r\n    [697] See Appendix E. Percentages represent Marine ground only;\r\n          air casualties have been deducted. Of 1st MAW casualties\r\n          of 432 (258 KIA, 174 WIA) during the entire war, 103 were\r\n          KIA and 41 WIA during the April 1952-July 1953 period\r\n          cited above.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConditions varied widely during the 1950–1952 and 1952–1953 periods of\r\nthe war. The enemy’s improved capability in artillery during the latter\r\nperiod of positional warfare largely accounts for the high casualty\r\nrate at this time. It has been noted that:\r\n\r\n  Prior to February 1952, with a warfare of mobility prevailing,\r\n  the enemy was inferior in artillery, the causative agent of most\r\n  personnel losses. Afterwards, during the outpost warfare of\r\n  western Korea, the front remained more or less static, and the\r\n  Chinese Reds had as much artillery support as the Marines.[698]\r\n\r\n    [698] Lynn Montross, “Development of Our Body Armor,” _Marine\r\n          Corps Gazette_, v. 39, no. 6 (Jun 55), p. 16.\r\n\r\nIt might be valid to question the use of Marine Corps specialists\r\nin amphibious warfare in an Army-type conventional land war. The\r\nprotracted land campaign that characterized the latter stages of\r\nthe Korean conflict actually was waged for the majority of the war\r\nperiod--from September 1951 to July 1953, or nearly two years. In terms\r\nof economy of manpower it could be considered an inefficient, though\r\nnot ineffective use of Marines. On the other hand, the history of\r\nwarfare down through the ages makes it repeatedly clear that a nation\r\nfights the pitched battle against its opponent with the arsenal of\r\nweapons and personnel at hand.\r\n\r\nAs an Eighth U.S. Army component (attached variously to the X, IX,\r\nand I Corps), the 1st Marine Division (one of nearly 20 divisions\r\nrepresenting U.S. Army, British Commonwealth, and ROK troops) performed\r\nits assigned mission--to repulse and punish the enemy. It contributed\r\nheavily to maintaining the integrity of the EUSAK front and was\r\nconsidered one of the two crack EUSAK divisions--the other being the\r\nMarines’ neighbor to the right, the British Commonwealth Division. With\r\nthe attached KMCs, the 1st Marine Division, moreover, was also the\r\nbiggest and strongest division in EUSAK.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, fast deployment of the Marine division had made\r\npossible the brilliant tactical maneuver at Inchon. Many military\r\nexperts, following World War II, had envisioned future conflicts only\r\nin terms of atomic warfare and massive strategic air assaults. Even the\r\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff “had predicted publicly, hardly\r\nsix months before, that the world would never again see a large-scale\r\namphibious landing.”[699] In contradiction to new atomic-age tactics,\r\nhowever, the United Nations commander in September 1950 had turned the\r\ntide of the battle by his use of a conventional maneuver--envelopment\r\nby amphibious assault. The performance of the Marine Corps was thus\r\nresponsible, in part, for changing post-Korean War military doctrine\r\nfrom total reliance on new tactics and weaponry to a more balanced\r\nconcept that combined both sophisticated innovations and viable,\r\nestablished procedures.\r\n\r\n    [699] Statement by Gen Omar N. Bradley, USA, as quoted by Gen\r\n          G. C. Thomas, Col R. D. Heinl, Jr. and RAdm A. A. Ageton,\r\n          _The Marine Officer’s Guide_ (Annapolis: United States\r\n          Naval Institute, 1956), p. 130.\r\n\r\nAlthough unemployed in its primary amphibious role after late 1950, the\r\n1st Marine Division had originally been positioned on the eastern front\r\nbecause of this capability. It was the UN commander’s desire to have\r\nEUSAK’s only amphibious trained and equipped division near the coast\r\nin the event that an amphibious maneuver was required for offensive or\r\ndefensive purposes. Again, in the division’s 1952 move to the western\r\ncoastal front in the Kimpo area, this fighting capability was a major\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nTo a large extent, U.S. forces in Korea fought the early part of\r\nthe Korean War with weapons from the preceding war--only five years\r\nremoved. Three tactical innovations employed by the Marine Corps during\r\nthe Korean War were highly successful and largely adopted by the other\r\nservices. These were the thermal boot, individual body armor, and the\r\nhelicopter. All were first combat tested in 1951.\r\n\r\nFrostbite casualties during the first winter in Korea resulting\r\nfrom inadequate footwear made it necessary to provide combat troops\r\nwith specially insulated footgear. The new thermal boot virtually\r\neliminated frostbite for both Marine infantrymen and aviators. Armored\r\nutility jackets had been developed toward the end of World War II but\r\nwere not actually battle tested. The Marine Corps had renewed the\r\nexperimentation in 1947. First combat use of the plastic, light-weight\r\nbody armor was made in July 1951 by Marines while fighting in the\r\nPunchbowl and Inje areas of X Corps. Improvements were made to the\r\nprototypes and by the following summer the Marine Corps, following a\r\nrequest made by the Army Quartermaster General, furnished some 4,000\r\nvests to frontline Army troops. By 1953 the 1st Marine Division had\r\nreceived its authorized quota of 24,000 vests and new lower torso body\r\narmor had also been put into production.\r\n\r\nMedical experts reported that the effectiveness of enemy low-velocity\r\nmissile weapons striking a man wearing body armor was reduced from\r\n30–80 percent. Chest and abdominal wounds decreased from 90–95 percent\r\nafter issuance of the armored vests. Overall battle casualties\r\nwere estimated to have been cut by 30 percent. By the time of the\r\ncease-fire, the protection offered by the Marine body armor had been\r\nextended to some 93,000 Marine and Army wearers. Hardly anywhere could\r\nthe U.S. taxpayer or fighting man have found a better buy for the\r\nmoney: mass production had reduced the per unit cost of the Marine\r\narmored vest to just $37.50.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Air_[700]\r\n\r\n    [700] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpts_ No. 6, Chap. 9, No. 5,\r\n          Chap. 8, No. 4, Chap. 10; _USMC Board Rpts_, vs. 1-11;\r\n          _Generals’ Summary_; AnlRpt SecNav 1952–1953; _USMC Ops\r\n          Korea_ vs. I-IV, _passim_; Monograph, _A Brief History of\r\n          Marine Corps Aviation_, (HistBr, G-3 Div, HQMC, 1960);\r\n          Cagle and Manson, _Sea War, Korea_; Sherrod, _Marine\r\n          Aviation_; LtCol C.

Keller, catapulted from the deck of the USS\r\n_Sicily_ to launch the first Marine air strikes in the Korean action.\r\nFrom then until 27 July 1953, units of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing\r\nflew 127,496 combat sorties in the Korean War, considerably in excess\r\nof the 80,000-odd sorties for all Marine aviation during World War II.\r\nOf this Korean number nearly a third, more than 39,500, represented the\r\nMarine Corps close air support specialty, even though 1st MAW pilots\r\nwere heavily engaged in other assignments from Fifth Air Force. These\r\nincluded interdiction, general support, air defense patrols, air rescue\r\noperations, photo and armed reconnaissance, and related tasks to insure\r\nAllied air superiority.\r\n\r\nWith the outbreak of Korean hostilities, Stateside Marine air units\r\nwere alerted for combat duty by 5 July. At Major General Field Harris’\r\n1st MAW headquarters, El Toro, MAG-33 elements were quickly readied\r\nfor deployment to Japanese bases and thence to Korea. Commanded by\r\nBrigadier General Thomas J. Cushman, MAG-33 comprised Headquarters and\r\nService Squadron 33, fighter squadrons VMF-214 and -323, an echelon of\r\nnightfighters from VMF(N)-513, two radar units (Marine Ground Control\r\nIntercept Squadron 1 and Marine Tactical Air Control Squadron 2), plus\r\nthe observation squadron, VMO-6. Forward elements were quickly on their\r\nway, arriving in Japan on 19 July, while the rear echelon reached the\r\nKorean Theater on 31 July. Twenty R5Ds from Marine Transport Squadrons\r\n152 and 352 were already providing logistical support for Pacific lift\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nAfter practicing some last minute carrier landing approaches, the\r\nfighter pilots got into combat almost at once. Following -214 into the\r\nwar, VMF-323 started operations on 6 August, flying from USS _Badoeng\r\nStrait_ in support of the Pusan ground defenders. When the brigade\r\nmounted out on 7 August on its drive to Chinju, the two MAG-33 carrier\r\nsquadrons were there with their 5-inch HVARs, napalm, 100- to 500-pound\r\nbombs, and 20mm cannon. VMF(N)-513 began its regularly-scheduled night\r\ntours over the Korean perimeter that same date, lashing at enemy supply\r\nand transportation centers in the Sachon-Chinju area of southern Korea.\r\nVMO-6 had already started evacuating casualties from the Pusan area\r\nthree days earlier.\r\n\r\nMany Army ground commanders witnessed the Marine system of close air\r\nsupport for the first time during the Pusan fighting. After the second\r\nNaktong battle, when air strikes had silenced enemy guns and 300 troops\r\nnear Obong-ni, the commander of the 23rd Regiment to the right of the\r\nbrigade wrote General Ridgway in Washington:\r\n\r\n  Infantry and artillery is a good team, but only by adding\r\n  adequate and efficient air support can we succeed without\r\n  devastating losses ... The Marines on our left were a sight to\r\n  behold. Not only was their equipment superior or equal to ours,\r\n  but they had squadrons of air in direct support. They used it\r\n  like artillery. It was, ‘Hey, Joe, this is Smitty, knock the\r\n  left of that ridge in from Item Company.’ They had it _day and\r\n  night_.[701]\r\n\r\n    [701] Quoted in Andrew Geer, _The New Breed--The Story of the\r\n          U.S. Marines in Korea_ (New York: Harper & Brothers,\r\n          1952), pp. 94–95, quoted with permission of the publisher.\r\n\r\nAnd while Marine, Army, and Navy staffs were completing plans for the\r\nforthcoming Inchon assault, MAG-33’s little aerial Photo Unit (part of\r\nHeadquarters Squadron) took a series of reconnaissance photographs of\r\nthe landing beaches in preparation for the closely coordinated maneuver.\r\n\r\nDuring Inchon-Seoul operations, MAG-33 was joined by three MAG-12\r\nfighter squadrons: VMF-212, VMF-312, and VMF(N)-542. After the\r\ncapture of Kimpo airfield, 212’s “Devilcats” and 542’s nightfighters\r\ntransferred from Itami to Kimpo. Flying out of 2d MAW headquarters,\r\nCherry Point, N.C., on 18 August, the Devilcats had climaxed a hurried\r\ndash halfway around the world to get into action. The squadron flew\r\nits first combat mission from Kimpo a month after its departure from\r\nthe East Coast. While the MAG-12 land-based squadrons and the carrier\r\npilots functioned as the division’s flying artillery, MGCIS-1 set up a\r\nradar warning system and MTACS-2 established a Tactical Air Direction\r\nCenter to direct all aircraft in the X Corps zone of action.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of the Inchon operation on 8 October, VMF-312\r\nand VMF(N)-542 remained at Kimpo. Other Marine squadrons (VMF-212,\r\nVMF(N)-513, VMO-6, HqSq-12, and carrier-based VMF-323) shifted to the\r\nKorean east coast in readiness for the Wonsan landing and subsequent\r\ndeployment north of the Marine infantry regiments. Wing elements began\r\narriving at the port city’s airfield on 13 October. Division Marines,\r\nmeanwhile, on board ship in the Wonsan harbor while more than 3,000\r\nexpertly laid Communist mines were being removed, did not land until 26\r\nOctober. For the men who fought the vertical war in Korea, it was “one\r\nof the rare times in the air-ground association, the 1st MAW had landed\r\nahead of the 1st Marine Division. The aviators didn’t miss putting up a\r\nbig sign-board “_Welcome, 1st Division!_”[702]\r\n\r\n    [702] LtCol C. A. Phillips and Maj H. D. Kuokka, “1st MAW in\r\n          Korea,” Part I, _Marine Corps Gazette_, May 1957, p. 45.\r\n\r\nAs 30 CCF divisions slammed into UNC forces all across the fighting\r\nfront in late November to change the nature of ground operations (and\r\nthe future of the war), so did the onset of the first Korean winter\r\ntest 1st MAW aerial skills and ingenuity. Low hanging ceilings, icing\r\nconditions, and three-inch snows on the carrier decks were common\r\noperating hazards. For the shore-based pilots, the bad weather often\r\ncaused changed flight plans as they were forced to land at alternate\r\nfields or on Navy carriers. Nonetheless, Marine RD4s flew up to the\r\nsouthern tip of the Chosin Reservoir, at Hagaru, to air-drop ammunition\r\nand supplies and evacuate casualties from the entrapment. Logistical\r\nsupport to this tiny frozen makeshift air strip was also provided by\r\nAir Force C-47s and C-119s. Later on, during the first step of the\r\ngrinding movement south, Air Force pilots paradropped a sectionalized\r\nsteel bridge vitally needed at Koto-ri to replace a destroyed span over\r\na chasm.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the load-out for Wonsan in early October, the 1st MAW\r\nwas placed under operational control of the Seoul-based Fifth Air\r\nForce.[703] Echelons of FAF air command and control initially slowed\r\noperational orders anywhere from 4 to 36 hours. Simplified interservice\r\ncommunications and command liaison between 1st MAW and FAF helped\r\nimprove the situation. With a verbal agreement, on 1 December, for CG,\r\n1st MAW to receive full control over X Corps area aircraft, problems\r\neased substantially. To a large degree the close coordination of Marine\r\naviation and ground forces during the Chosin campaign was due to the\r\nuse of flexible, simplified, and fast battle-tested Marine Corps-Navy\r\nCAS techniques and to having increased the number of pilot FACs from\r\none to two per battalion.\r\n\r\n    [703] Technically, FAF had also been the controlling agency\r\n          for air support during Pusan operations. Marine aviation\r\n          units, as a component of an integrated Fleet Marine\r\n          Force, however, were directed to fly support for 1st\r\n          ProvMarBrig as their highest priority. Except for the\r\n          formality of checking in with the FAF Tactical Air\r\n          Control Center (TACC) at JOC, 1st MAW units operated\r\n          under the Marine Corps-Navy CAS doctrine. During the\r\n          Seoul-Inchon campaign, control of air operations came\r\n          under ComNavFE, since it was an amphibious operation, and\r\n          the air system followed Marine-Navy doctrine. USMC Board\r\n          Rpt, v. I, p. IV-B-9, 14.\r\n\r\nThe Marine movement south from Hagaru was protected by one of the\r\ngreatest concentrations of aircraft during the entire war. Twenty-four\r\nCAS aircraft covered the breakout column, while attack planes assaulted\r\nenemy forces in adjacent ridge approaches. Marine planes on station at\r\nYonpo (south of the Hamhung-Hungnam axis) and carrier-based VMF-323\r\nflew some 130 sorties daily. Another 100 attack sorties were flown\r\ndaily by Navy carrier-based planes, while FAF flew interdiction\r\nmissions beyond the bombline. Marine Panther jets of VMF-311, operating\r\nwith the Air Force from the Pusan area, got into the action at Yonpo.\r\nIt was also at this time that an airborne TADC (tactical air direction\r\ncenter) was first improvised when the radio jeeps moving south with\r\nthe column had communication failures. For six days, a VMR-152 R5D\r\ntransport orbited 2,000 to 4,000 feet above the Marine units to control\r\nair support between Hagaru and Chinhung-ni as a flying radio nerve\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\nFrom late November to early December, as the division battled its way\r\nfrom Chosin to Hamhung, Marine, Navy, and Air Force aircraft evacuated\r\nmore than 5,000 Marine, Army, and ROK casualties. And during the most\r\ncritical period, the little OY spotter planes and HO3S-1 helicopters\r\nfrom VMO-6 provided the only physical contact between units separated\r\nby enemy action. Marine tactical squadrons in these three early major\r\noffensives of the war, from 3 August to 14 December, flew 7,822\r\nsorties, 5,305 of them CAS for the battered UNC ground units.\r\n\r\nFrom 1951–1953, 1st MAW pilots and planes came under direct control of\r\nFAF. They alternated between principal missions of interdiction raids\r\nto harass and destroy Communist supply lines north of the battlefront,\r\ngeneral support sorties outside the bombline, and CAS flights to\r\nsupport infantry forces threatened by enemy penetration. Typical of FAF\r\nfocus on massive aerial assaults were the following assignments that\r\nMarine flyers participated in:\r\n\r\n  In January 1951 (prior to Operation KILLER), the 1st MAW\r\n  undertook a series of interdiction raids against the Communist\r\n  supply net located in the Korean waist between the 38th and 39th\r\n  Parallels, to disrupt the CCF transport-truck system.\r\n\r\n  On 9 May 1951, 75 1st MAW Corsairs and Panther jets were part of\r\n  the 300-plane raid staged by FAF against Communist airfields at\r\n  Sinuiju, on the Korean side of the Yalu.\r\n\r\nOperation STRANGLE, a major Fifth Air Force all-out interdiction\r\neffort to cripple the enemy supply life line, was undertaken 20 May.\r\nWhen the Chinese Communist spring offensive broke shortly thereafter,\r\nMAG-12 Corsairs and -33 Panther jets delivered maximum support to the\r\nMLR regiments, the 1st and 7th Marines. When the truce talks began\r\nin Kaesong, in July 1951, 1st MAW planes and the radar searches of\r\nMACG-2 stood guard. Batteries of the Marine 1st 90mm AAA Gun Battalion,\r\nattached to the wing, were also alerted to keep under surveillance the\r\napproaches to key military ports.\r\n\r\nNew tactical developments pioneered by 1st MAW during the Korean War\r\nadvanced the UNC air effort and added to the 1st MAW reputation for\r\nversatility. Several major steps forward were taken toward Marine\r\naviation’s primary goal of providing real operational 24-hour CAS,\r\nregardless of foul weather conditions. The new MPQ-14 radar-controlled\r\nbombing equipment, developed between 1946 and 1950, was employed by\r\nMASRT-1, as a device to control night fighter sorties of a general\r\nsupport nature flown by day attack aircraft. By means of height-finding\r\nand directional radars, it enabled a pilot to leave his base, drop a\r\nbomb load on target, and return to home field without ever having seen\r\nthe ground. It offered major practical improvement in blind bombing\r\nmethods. MPQ was limited, however, in its use in sudden, moving battle\r\nsituations because of some of its sophisticated, hand-built ABC\r\ncomponents. A real tactical breakthrough in night CAS came in April\r\n1953 when VMF(N)-513 and the VMO-6 spotter planes evolved the new\r\nsearchlight beam control system which made possible 24-hour coverage\r\nfor 1st Marine Division ground units.\r\n\r\nIn other innovations, it will be remembered that the Air Force in late\r\n1952 had requested escort by VMF(N)-513’s new two-place jet-intruder\r\nF3D Skyknights on Air Force B-29 night bombing missions. During a\r\nfour-month period from 1952–1953, the Marine night fighters downed\r\none enemy plane or more a month while escorting the B-29s. Once the\r\nF3Ds began their night escort role, Air Force bomber losses became\r\nnegligible.\r\n\r\nA unique capability of the long-range, jet-intruder night-fighter\r\nwas that the F3D carried a radar operator who replaced the ground\r\ncontroller, thereby extending air-defense radar range to the aircraft.\r\nIt could thus operate independently and effectively at great distance\r\nfrom its base. Without GCI (ground control intercept) aid, VMF(N)-513\r\ndirect escort to bombers at night was so successful that the squadron’s\r\nplanes were used as exclusive escort of the Bomber Command B-29s. In\r\nNovember 1952, the Marine squadron’s two night kills were the first\r\never recorded by airborne intercept radar-equipped jet fighters. At the\r\nend of the war, Skyknights and -513 pilots (flying F3Ds as well as the\r\nearlier F7Fs) had destroyed more enemy aircraft than any other Marine\r\nor Navy day or night fighter plane. Tactics employed by VMF(N)-513\r\nwere original in concept and required a high-level of training and\r\nindividual pilot-AIO (airborne intercept operator) proficiency. It was\r\nnoted that:\r\n\r\n  The enthusiasm with which this Marine aid to the Air Force has\r\n  been received by FEAF Bomber Command indicates that VMF(N)-513\r\n  had successfully adapted its equipment and personnel to a\r\n  mission usually associated with Air Force operations, making an\r\n  important contribution to interservice cooperation, but even more\r\n  important, to tactical progress in the night escort of bomber\r\n  formations.[704]\r\n\r\n    [704] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, p. 9-82.\r\n\r\nAn operation somewhat in reverse of the nightfighters was that of\r\nVMJ-1, the Marine photographic squadron, which had its own Air Force\r\nescort. Formerly the Wing Photo Unit, VMJ-1 was commissioned in\r\nFebruary 1952 and flew a total of 5,025 combat flights. Under FAF\r\noperational control until late in the war, the squadron’s 550-mph\r\nF2H-2P twin-jet Banshees flew unarmed deep into enemy country--even\r\nas far as the MIG-guarded Yalu--photographing positions, airfields,\r\npower plants, and other targets. An escort plane flew cover while the\r\nphoto ship took pictures. Photo missions to the Suiho Reservoir were\r\nrated so important that “24 Air Force F-86 jets flew an umbrella.”[705]\r\nIntroduction of the squadron’s jet Banshee early in 1952 was a major\r\nstep in improved aerial photography. The Banshee was the superior\r\nphotographic aircraft in the combat theater, because of its new\r\nadvanced-design view finder and operating range.\r\n\r\n    [705] “1st MAW in Korea,” _op. cit._, Part II, Jun 57, p. 23.\r\n\r\nCoverage from VMJ-1’s gross wartime output of 793,012 feet of processed\r\nprints was equal to a continuous photographic strip six and half times\r\naround the earth at the equator. The Marine photo squadron contributed\r\na third to the entire UN photo reconnaissance effort and at times flew\r\nas much as 50 percent of all FAF intelligence missions.\r\n\r\nThroughout the war the four attack squadrons of MAG-12 (VMAs-212, -251,\r\n-121; and -332 at the end of the war) had dumped seemingly endless bomb\r\nloads on CCF installations, while MAG-33’s two jet-fighter squadrons\r\n(VMF-115 and -311) had provided the Marine exchange pilots who scoured\r\nthe lower side of the Yalu with the Air Force F-86s on fighter sweeps.\r\n\r\nDuring Korea the Marine CVE/CVL squadrons (VMAs-214, -233, -312, and\r\n-251) flew more than 25,000 sorties, experimenting with improved\r\ntechniques for carrier landings. The carrier qualification program of\r\nMarine air units, a regular part of their training, also proved its\r\nvalue in combat. In the earliest days of the war, VMF-214 and -323[706]\r\nhad operated from two CVEs based off the south coast of Korea, thereby\r\nproviding close support to the brigade and other Eighth Army elements\r\nat a time when all shore-based aircraft were forced to operate from\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n    [706] With phaseout of the Corsairs in 1952, the VMF squadrons\r\n          were subsequently redesignated as attack units.\r\n\r\nIn other tactical refinements, the 1st MAW had employed an airborne\r\ntactical air control center in combat for the first time. In July\r\n1952, when the static ground situation led to a build-up of enemy flak\r\nalong the front lines that interfered with effective CAS delivery,\r\nthe 11th Marines had instituted a flak suppression program in front\r\nof the division sector. Later that year, CG Eighth Army had ordered a\r\nsimilar program used by all other Eighth Army commands. By December,\r\napparently because of lack of success with their own methods, EUSAK\r\nhad adopted the system developed by the Marine artillery regiment. The\r\nantiaircraft program, together with a reduction in the number of runs\r\nper aircraft per mission,[707] had measurably decreased casualties\r\nfor CAS missions conducted within artillery range. During 1952–1953\r\nthis loss rate for pilots and planes had dropped by a third, with no\r\ncorresponding reduction in the sortie rate.\r\n\r\n    [707] In August 1952, FAF had introduced a new policy limiting\r\n          pilots to one pass on general support or interdiction\r\n          missions and two passes on CAS flights.\r\n\r\nStabilized warfare and enemy AA build-up had also led to an increasing\r\nuse of enemy radars. Passive electronics countermeasures (ECM) were\r\ninstituted by FAF. This program was enhanced in September 1952 by the\r\ncommissioning of VMC-1 (Marine Composite Squadron 1), administratively\r\nassigned to MACG-2. The squadron possessed the only Fifth Air Force\r\nECM capability to locate enemy radars and was the primary source of\r\nECM intercept equipment in FAF squadrons for early warning and radar\r\ncontrol monitoring. Throughout the duration of hostilities, VMC-1\r\nremained the only Navy-Marine unit in the Korean theater with ECM as\r\nits prime function.\r\n\r\nFor its combat action, the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing was awarded two\r\nKorean Presidential Unit Citations and the Army Distinguished Unit\r\nCitation for the Wonsan operation. Wing pilots were responsible for\r\ndowning 35 enemy planes, including the first night kill made by a\r\nUnited Nations aircraft. Participation of the 1st MAW in the war could\r\nalso be measured in a different way. On the inevitable red side of the\r\nledger: 258 air Marines had been killed (including 65 MIA and presumed\r\ndead) and 174 WIA. A total of 436 aircraft were also lost in combat or\r\noperational accidents.\r\n\r\nFrom the command level, Korean operations marked the first time the\r\n1st Marine Aircraft Wing had functioned for an extended period as a\r\ncomponent in a broad, unified command structure such as FAF. Despite\r\nthe weak links initially inherent in such a situation, the command\r\nstructure did work. Marine-Navy and Air Force-Army differing aerial\r\ndoctrines and tactics of close tactical air support, however, were\r\nnever fully reconciled. The Marine wing made a notable contribution\r\nin providing really effective close, speedy tactical support during\r\nthe sudden fluid battle situation that erupted in mid-July 1953.\r\nSimplified Marine TACP control, request procedures, and fast radio net\r\nsystem enabled 1st MAW pilots to reach the target area quickly. During\r\nthis final month of the war--and indicative of the enormous amount of\r\ncoordination involved in the FAF administrative apparatus--1st MAW\r\nplanes flew 1,500 CAS sorties for the 19 different EUSAK frontline\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\nCG, 1st MAW noted in General Order No. 153 issued the last day of the\r\nwar, that “the Wing’s association with the Eighth Army, the Fifth Air\r\nForce and the Seventh U.S. Fleet in combined operations had been a\r\nprofessionally broadening experience--teaching tolerance, teamwork, and\r\nflexibility of operations.”[708]\r\n\r\n    [708] MajGen V. E. Megee, GO 153, dtd 27 Jul 53, quoted in 1st\r\n          MAW, Part II, _op. cit._, p. 26.\r\n\r\nBesides the FAF interdiction work and support missions for frontline\r\nunits, new 1st MAW tactics and equipment had diversified the wing’s\r\nskills and capabilities in its primary role of providing CAS for Marine\r\nground units. Of new tactical air support developments in the Korean\r\naction none had a more revolutionary effect than those created by the\r\nhelicopter--which dramatically reshaped battlefield logistics and\r\npointed the way to a new era in Marine Corps air-ground teamwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Helicopter_[709]\r\n\r\n    [709] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section\r\n          is derived from _PacFlt EvalRpts_ No. 4, Chap. 9,\r\n          No. 5, Chap. 8, No. 6, Chap. 9; _USMC Board Rpt_, v.\r\n          I; Generals’ _Summary_; _USMC Ops Korea_, vs. I-IV,\r\n          _passim_; Montross, _SkyCav_.\r\n\r\nA promising newcomer on the Marine aviation scene was the helicopter,\r\nwhose tactical employment in Korea was to far exceed all expectations.\r\nA few helicopters had been used experimentally in the European and\r\nPacific theaters toward the end of World War II, too late to evaluate\r\ntheir performance. But it was the Marine Corps, beginning in 1947,\r\nthat had pioneered the development of combat techniques utilizing the\r\nrotor-driven aircraft as a means of enhancing its capability for the\r\namphibious assault. When the Korean incident erupted in June 1950,\r\nthe Marine Corps was in a position to assign four HO3S-1 Sikorsky\r\ntwo-place helicopters and flight personnel from its Quantico test unit,\r\nHMX-1, together with fixed-wing planes and pilots to form the brigade\r\nobservation squadron, VMO-6. These Marines had the distinction of\r\nbeing the first helicopter pilots of any U.S. service to be formed into\r\na unit for overseas duty.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Marine Corps also had 31 months’ experience with the\r\nstrange looking, pot-bellied, ungainly aircraft in diverse battlefield\r\ntasks. These included casualty evacuation, reconnaissance, wire-laying,\r\nliaison, and administrative missions. But promising test exercises at\r\nQuantico and Camp Lejeune were hardly enough. The real test would come\r\nat the front. There, the helicopter’s military value would reflect and\r\n“depend to a large extent on how well the Marine Corps had worked out\r\ncombat doctrines and techniques where none had existed before.”[710]\r\n\r\n    [710] Montross, _SkyCav_, p. 108.\r\n\r\nLanding with the brigade in August 1950, the choppers performed\r\ninvaluable service from the earliest days of Pusan, Inchon, Seoul, and\r\nthe Reservoir. During the most critical phase of the Chosin operation,\r\nthe helicopters provided the only liaison between isolated commands.\r\nWire-laying by air was first employed by VMO-6 during the second battle\r\nof the Naktong River, in September 1950. The ground had changed hands\r\nseveral times and control was uncertain. Using makeshift communication\r\nrigs, VMO-6 pilots unreeled telephone wire at a mile a minute. This\r\nmethod of putting telephone lines across Korean mountains became\r\nroutine through the rest of the war, and Marine choppers strung miles\r\nof lines in rain and wind with the enemy blasting away at them. Wire\r\nwas laid over terrain in a matter of hours where it would have taken\r\nmen on foot weeks--if it could have been done.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest innovation of VMO-6, however, was its night\r\ncasualty evacuation techniques first employed at Pusan. Darting in and\r\nout at treetop level around the Korean mountains, the light, easily\r\nmaneuverable craft could land on a tiny patch of earth to evacuate\r\ninjured men or bring in supplies. Once, during the early part of the\r\nwar, when the aeronautical pioneer Igor Sikorsky was asked how his\r\nrevolutionary vehicles were performing in combat, Mr. Sikorsky, bowing\r\nfrom the waist in his Old World manner, replied:\r\n\r\n  Thank you. Our things go very well in Korea. The helicopter has\r\n  already saved the lives of several thousands of our boys in Korea\r\n  and the score is still mounting.[711]\r\n\r\n    [711] _Marine Corps Gazette_, v. 39, no. 10 (Oct 55), p. 61\r\n          quoting Eugene E. Wilson, _Wings of the Dawn_ (Hartford,\r\n          Conn.: Connecticut Printers, Inc., 1955).\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the helicopter, as little as 43 minutes elapsed\r\nbetween the time a Marine was hit and the time he was on board the USS\r\n_Repose_ or other hospital ships. Later on when the Marine transport\r\ncopters arrived in Korea, HMR-161 pilots felt a new record had been\r\nset when only 30 minutes[712] intervened between the time a frontline\r\nMarine was hit and delivered to a hospital facility 17 miles from the\r\nzone of action. The _Consolation_ had been outfitted with a helicopter\r\nloading platform in July 1951, and eventually all hospital ships had\r\nsuch landing platforms. In Korea the flying ambulances could make the\r\ntrip from rear area aid station to ship in five minutes and unload the\r\nwounded and clear the deck in 45 seconds flat.\r\n\r\n    [712] By contrast, in 1945 World War II campaigns the Secretary\r\n          of the Navy James V. Forrestal had visited hospital\r\n          ships and praised the air evacuation methods then in use\r\n          when he commented, “I went aboard the _Samaritan_, where\r\n          Navy surgeons and corpsmen were already dealing with the\r\n          casualties from the day and night before.” Capt Clifford\r\n          P. Morehouse, _The Iwo Jima Campaign_, (Washington:\r\n          HistDiv, HQMC, 1946), p. 139.\r\n\r\nThroughout the war nearly 10,000 wounded Marines were evacuated by\r\nhelicopter; more than 1,000 such missions were carried out at night.\r\nRecords indicate that VMO-6 flew out 7,067 casualties and that another\r\n2,748 medical evacuations were made by HMR-161, for which the task\r\nranked as a secondary mission. Although these humanitarian gains were\r\nimportant, major tactical innovations made by the helicopter were even\r\nmore significant.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1951, HMR-161 successfully executed the first combat\r\ntroop resupply mission in history. At this time while the division\r\nwas deployed in the jagged razorback-ridge Punchbowl area, “a glimpse\r\nof future warfare was provided when Marine helicopter lifts on a\r\ncompany scale led to the lift of an entire battalion and its organic\r\nequipment.”[713] Arriving in Korea on 31 August, the squadron had a\r\ncomplement of 15 new 10-place HRS-1 transport vehicles, with cruising\r\nspeed of 60–85 knots. Developed specifically to meet Marine Corps\r\ncombat requirements, the HRS marked a new era in Marine airborne\r\nsupport to ground troops. Both VMO-6 and HMR-161 came under operational\r\ncontrol of the division. (With 1st Division and Wing headquarters\r\nseparated geographically by more than 200 miles, it was particularly\r\nexpedient to have the two squadrons under division control.)\r\n\r\n    [713] HistBr outline, p. 4.\r\n\r\nThe first step toward using the rotor-blade aircraft in the mission\r\nmost closely related to the USMC basic helicopter concept--that\r\nof transporting troops and supplies by vertical envelopment--was\r\naccomplished 13 September 1951. In Operation WINDMILL I, HRS choppers\r\ncarried out the first Marine mass helicopter combat resupply operation\r\nin history. A lift of one day’s supplies was made to 2/1 in the Soyang\r\nRiver vicinity. A total of 28 flights were executed in overall time of\r\n2½ hours (a total flight time of 14.1 hours) to transport 18,848 pounds\r\nof gear and 74 Marines a distance of seven miles.\r\n\r\nHMR-161 first applied the Corps’ new concept of vertical envelopment\r\non 21 September when, despite heavy fog, it transported 224 fully\r\nequipped Marines and 17,772 pounds of cargo from the reserve area\r\nto the MLR. This was the first helicopter lift of a combat unit in\r\nhistory. Company-size troop lifts inevitably led to more complicated\r\nbattalion-size transfers. In the 11 November Operation SWITCH, HMR-161\r\neffected the relief of a frontline battalion, involving the lift of\r\nnearly 2,000 troops. Twelve of the 3½-ton aircraft made 262 flights in\r\noverall time of 10 hours (95.6 hours flight time).\r\n\r\nThe tactical and logistical possibilities of the multi-purpose rotor\r\ncraft attracted considerable attention. So impressed, in fact, were\r\nEighth Army officers by the mobility and utility displayed by Marine\r\nhelicopters that in November 1951 General Ridgway had asked the Army\r\nto provide four Army helicopter transport battalions, each with 280\r\nhelicopters. Korea, Ridgway said, had “conclusively demonstrated that\r\nthe Army vitally needed helicopters,”[714] and he recommended that the\r\ntypical field army of the future have 10 helicopter transportation\r\nbattalions.\r\n\r\n    [714] Futrell, _USAF, Korea_, pp. 533–534.\r\n\r\nRidgway was thereby renewing requests for helicopters made in the\r\nearly days of the war by both the Army (through General MacArthur)\r\nand the Air Force (by General Barcus). But the UNC Commander’s\r\nenthusiasm, although understandable, turned out to be the undoing\r\nfor substantial Army use of the rotary-blade aircraft in Korea. The\r\nscale of operations[715] envisioned by Ridgway unwittingly led to a\r\n“jurisdictional controversy”[716] about possible duplication of aerial\r\nfunctions not reconciled by the two services until a year later.\r\nAlthough both services had helicopters in limited use, “hostilities\r\nwere in their last stages before either the Army or the Air Force\r\nbegan to receive the cargo helicopters which they had put on order in\r\n1950 and 1951.”[717]\r\n\r\n    [715] Hermes, _Truce Tent_, p. 184, comments: “In order to\r\n          insure a steady flow of replacement craft, he [Ridgway]\r\n          suggested that procurement be started on a scale\r\n          that would permit manufacturers to expand production\r\n          immediately.”\r\n\r\n    [716] Futrell, _USAF, Korea_, p. 534.\r\n\r\n    [717] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nA successful three-day Army regimental supply exercise in May 1953 and\r\na combat maneuver the following month in which the choppers formed an\r\nair bridge to a heavily attacked, isolated ROK unit caused General\r\nTaylor, then CG, EUSAK, to observe: “The cargo helicopter, employed\r\nin mass, can extend the tactical mobility of the Army far beyond\r\nits normal capability.” He strongly recommended that the Army make\r\n“ample provisions for the full exploitation of the helicopter in the\r\nfuture.”[718]\r\n\r\n    [718] _Ibid._, p. 535.\r\n\r\nPioneering developments by the Marine Corps had, of course, continued\r\nmeanwhile. Logistical operations had grown increasingly complex and\r\ndiversified. In Operation HAYLIFT II, 23–27 February 1953, Marine\r\nhelicopters set an all time cargo-carrying record when they lifted\r\n1,612,306 pounds of cargo to completely supply two JAMESTOWN regiments\r\nwith daily requirements for the five-day period. This represented a\r\ntotal of 1,633 lifts and 583.4 flying hours for the operation. The\r\nrecord day’s lift was 200 tons, whereas plans had called for lifting\r\na maximum 130 tons per day. Experience gained during the operation\r\nindicated that similar tactical maneuvers in warmer weather would be\r\neven more successful when troop fuel oil requirements were reduced.\r\n\r\nOther Marine innovations by HMR-161 included supplying ammunition\r\nfrom the rear area ASP to the MLR and redeployment of 1st 4.5-inch\r\nRocket Battery personnel and guns from one firing area to another.\r\nAnd although VMO-6 executed most of the mercy missions, the transport\r\nsquadron performed an unusual assignment in July 1952. Flood conditions\r\nthroughout Korea brought an urgent request from the Army for use of\r\nHMR-161. On 30 July, the Marine squadron evacuated 1,172 Army troops\r\nfrom their positions in the Chunchon area where they had been trapped\r\nby the heavy rains.\r\n\r\nWith a new tactical exercise held nearly every month, HMR-161\r\noperations that once had rated world-wide headlines were now\r\npractically routine. VTOL-style battalion troop lifts were no longer\r\nnovel and regimental resupply operations were becoming almost standard\r\npractice. In both relocation of units and logistical support, combat\r\nhelicopters had provided high mobility and reasonable speed. They\r\nhad introduced a new infantry technique of “hit and run” tactics.\r\nThe transport helicopter squadron had proved most effective when\r\nemployed in major tactical movements and not when used piecemeal on\r\nminor missions. Marine Corps wartime use of the new aerial vehicle had\r\nclearly proven that helicopters had become a necessary and integral\r\ncomponent of the modern-day balanced military force.\r\n\r\n\r\n_FMF and Readiness Posture_[719]\r\n\r\n    [719] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: Semianl Rpts of SecDef (including SecNav),\r\n          1951–1955; _PacFlt EvalRpts_ No. 4, Chaps. 9, 10, No. 5,\r\n          Chaps. 8, 9, No. 6.

Printing Office, 1961).\r\n\r\nThe flexibility and readiness capability inherent in the Marine Corps\r\nFMF structure was a strong undergirding factor in its swift response to\r\nthe Korean crisis. As noted, in June 1950 the Marine Corps had 74,279\r\nofficers and men on active duty. Its Fleet Marine Force, consisting of\r\nFMFPac and FMFLant, numbered 27,656. The 11,853 personnel of FMFPac\r\nincluded 7,779 men in General Smith’s 1st Marine Division at Camp\r\nPendleton and 3,733 in General Harris’ 1st Marine Aircraft Wing at El\r\nToro. On the East Coast, FMFLant numbered 15,803 with approximately\r\n8,973 Marines in the 2d Division at Camp Lejeune and 5,297 air\r\npersonnel attached to the 2d Wing at Cherry Point.\r\n\r\nOutbreak of Korean hostilities thus presented the Marine Corps with\r\nthe tasks of organizing and deploying for combat first a brigade and\r\nthen a full war-strength reinforced division, each with supporting\r\naviation elements. Despite the low strength to which FMFPac had shrunk\r\ndue to stringent national defense economy measures, the heavy demands\r\nplaced upon it were met. Both missions were accomplished quickly and\r\neffectively. In fact, “few achievements in the long history of the\r\nMarine Corps can equal what was achieved in the 11 weeks which elapsed\r\nbetween the outbreak of the Korean War and the amphibious assault of\r\nthe 1st Marine Division at Inchon.”[720]\r\n\r\n    [720] Historical Outline of the Development of FMFPac,\r\n          1941–1950, p. 49.\r\n\r\nAs early as 2 July, CinCFE MacArthur had requested that a Marine\r\nRCT-air unit be dispatched to the Far East. On 7 July the 1st\r\nProvisional Marine Brigade was activated; on 12–14 July it embarked.\r\nWith departure of the brigade, personnel shortages within the 1st\r\nDivision and 1st Wing became acute. The division was reduced to 3,459,\r\nless than a RCT; and the wing to 2,300. Meanwhile, as the increasing\r\ndemand had continued for a Marine Division deployed to Korea, it\r\nbecame equally apparent that if the Marine Corps were to fulfill this\r\nrequirement of deploying a full-strength division to Korea,[721] its\r\nreservists would have to be called up to alleviate these shortages.\r\n\r\n    [721] With 7,779 men in 1stMarDiv and 8,973 in the 2dMarDiv,\r\n          even “had they been combined into a single unit, its\r\n          numbers would still have fallen 20 percent short of one\r\n          war-strength division.” Giusti, _Mobilization_, MCR, p. 9.\r\n\r\nManpower potential of the Marine Corps Reserve was 128,959, nearly\r\ntwice that of the regular establishment. In June 1950, the Organized\r\nMarine Corps Reserve (Ground) numbered 1,879 officers and 31,648\r\nenlisted personnel being trained in 138 OMCR units of battalion size\r\nor less. Membership of the ground reserve was approximately 76 percent\r\nof its authorized strength. At the same time the Organized Reserve\r\n(Aviation) consisted of 30 fighter and 12 ground control intercept\r\nsquadrons attached to the Marine Air Reserve Training Command organized\r\nat Glenview, Ill. in 1946. These MARTCOM squadrons numbered 1,588\r\nofficers and 4,753 enlisted, or approximately 95 percent of authorized\r\nstrength. In addition to nearly 40,000 members of the OMCR, the Marine\r\nVolunteer (nondrill, nonpay status) Reserve carried approximately\r\n90,000 on its rolls.\r\n\r\nA warning notice went out on 19 July from the Commandant, General\r\nCates, to District Directors that the OMCR would shortly be ordered\r\nto active duty; later that same day mobilization of the Reserve was\r\nauthorized by President Truman, with Congressional sanction. On 20\r\nJuly, the first 22 ground units, with nearly 5,000 men, were ordered to\r\nactive duty on a schedule that took into account the unit’s state of\r\nreadiness, proximity to its initial duty station, and facilities there\r\nfor handling the personnel overload.\r\n\r\nLess than a month after hostilities began in Korea, key infantry,\r\nartillery, and engineer units of the OMCR had been ordered to extended\r\nactive duty. On 31 July, West Coast ground reserve units from Los\r\nAngeles, San Francisco, Oakland, and Phoenix were the first to report\r\nin to Camp Pendleton for augmentation into the 1st Marine Division. The\r\nfollowing day their opposite numbers from the East Coast units arrived\r\nat Camp Lejeune. By 11 September, all of the organized ground units had\r\nreported for duty and the OMCR (Ground) had ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nWhile the organized ground reserve was being mobilized, the first\r\nof the 42 MARTCOM fighter and intercept squadrons began arriving at\r\nEl Toro. Personnel of six reserve VMF and three MGCI squadrons were\r\nordered to duty on 23 July as replacements in the 1st MAW which had\r\nfurnished units and men for the MAG-33 component of the brigade.\r\n\r\nCommenting on the success with which the Marine Corps achieved this\r\nexpansion, the Secretary of Defense was to note later:\r\n\r\n  The speed with which this mobilization was effected was an\r\n  important factor in the rapid buildup of the First Marine\r\n  Division, the first units of which sailed for the Far East in\r\n  July 1950.[722]\r\n\r\n    [722] Semianl Rpt of SecDef (1 Jan-30 Jun) 1953, p. 187.\r\n\r\nAs late as 20 July, the Joint Chiefs of Staff had informed MacArthur\r\nthat a Marine division could not be sent before November or even\r\nDecember. Finally, on 25 July, the CinCUNC’s third request for the\r\ndivision was approved. It would, however, be a division minus one RCT,\r\nand the Joint Chiefs were “adamant in their decision that MacArthur\r\nmust wait until autumn or even winter for his third RCT.”[723]\r\n\r\n    [723] _USMC Ops Korea_, v. II, p. 23.\r\n\r\nThe JCS also directed on 25 July that the Marine Corps build its\r\ndivision (less one RCT) to full war strength. The date of 10–15\r\nAugust was set for its departure to the Far East. Among the many\r\nsteps taken in the mobilization schedule, the JCS directed that the\r\nCamp Lejeune-based 2d Marine Division be expanded immediately to war\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nFleshing out personnel--against short-fuzed manpower and time\r\nfactors--for the 1st Marine Division and Wing, due to embark in\r\nmid-August, a month after the brigade had left, was a round-the-clock\r\noperation for all hands. Between 25 July-5 August, the Marine Corps\r\nprovided personnel for the expanded Division/Wing by:\r\n\r\n  transfer of FMFLant-selected, 2d Division/Wing air and ground\r\n  units, of 6,800 men, to FMFPac;\r\n\r\n  transfer of 3,600 regular Marines from 105 posts and stations\r\n  throughout the U.S.;\r\n\r\n  mobilization of 2,900 from early OMCR ground and air units; and\r\n  utilization of two replacement drafts, number 900, intended for\r\n  the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade.\r\n\r\nExpansion of the 1st Marine Division was in two phases, bringing the\r\ndivision (less one RCT) up to war strength and then organizing its\r\nthird reinforced infantry regiment, the 7th Marines. With the cadre\r\nof 3,459 men in the division after the brigade left and the influx of\r\nregulars and reservists, the 1st Division embarked for Korea between\r\n10 and 24 August. It had reached wartime strength (less one RCT) on 15\r\nAugust, just 27 days after beginning its buildup from a peacetime T/O.\r\nAs it had approached war strength, the Division CG, General Smith, was\r\ndirected by CMC ltr of 4 August to activate a third RCT and prepare it\r\nfor departure to Korea no later than 1 September.\r\n\r\nWhile mounting out, the division transferred approximately 1,000 of\r\nits rear echelon to be used in the buildup of the 7th Marines. The\r\n6th Marines of the 2d Division provided the base for building this\r\nnew regiment. (Approximately 800 Marines of 3/6 were reassigned from\r\nMediterranean duty and ordered to the Far East, via the Suez Canal,\r\nto join the 7th Marines upon its arrival there.) By drawing men from\r\nwidely scattered sources, it was possible to activate the 7th Marines\r\non 17 August. Departure of this regiment on 1 September was thus far in\r\nadvance of the late fall or winter target date originally set by the\r\nJCS.\r\n\r\nWith all OMCR ground units called up and absorbed into the 1st and 2d\r\nDivisions, and air squadrons being mobilized on a slower schedule (due\r\nto less-urgent combat needs for air personnel in the early war stage),\r\nthe Marine Corps dealt with its remaining body of reserve strength.\r\nBulk orders went out beginning 15 August to the Volunteer Reserve, and\r\nby the end of the year 58,480 men and women in this category were on\r\nactive duty. More than 80 percent of the volunteer reservists on Marine\r\nCorps rolls served during the Korean War.\r\n\r\nAttesting to the impact of events in Korea is the fact that “following\r\nthe epic withdrawal of the 1st Division from the Chosin Reservoir, the\r\nnumber of new enlistments into the active Volunteer Reserve jumped from\r\n877 in December to 3,477 in January.”[724]\r\n\r\n    [724] Giusti, _op. cit._, p. 36.\r\n\r\nComplete mobilization of the organized ground reserve had been\r\naccomplished in just 53 days, from 20 July to 11 September. A previous\r\nestimate had shown an expected 80 percent availability of ground\r\nreserve on M-Day; the actual mobilization figure was 90 percent.\r\nOf 33,528 OMCR ordered to active duty, a total of 30,183 (1,550\r\nofficers/28,633 enlisted) reported. Marine aviation also expanded\r\nrapidly. By January 1951, 32 organized reserve air units (20 of the\r\n30 existing VMFs and all 12 MGCIs) had been activated and by October\r\nof that year all of the reserve squadrons had been called to active\r\nduty. Of the 6,341 organized air reservists, 5,240 received orders;\r\n4,893, or 93.4 percent, reported in. In contrast to the ground reserve,\r\nair units had been recalled on a staggered or partial mobilization\r\nschedule, a matter which was later to receive Congressional attention\r\n(and ultimately to set a new trend) when the Nation’s entire Korean War\r\nmobilization procedures were reviewed and subsequently revised.\r\n\r\nOf the Marines participating in the Inchon invasion, 17 percent were\r\nreservists. By June 1951 the proportion of reservists in Marine Corps\r\nunits in Korea had increased to nearly 50 percent. Between July 1950\r\nand June 1953, approximately 122,000 reservists, both recruits and\r\nveterans, saw active duty with the Marine Corps.\r\n\r\nThroughout the war the Marine Corps effected approximately 34\r\nreplacement drafts and another 31 rotation drafts. Ground Marines\r\nserved an average tour of 13 months overseas (although actual time\r\nattached to the division was about 10½ months). The collapse of North\r\nKorean forces after the Inchon-Seoul operation and the unopposed\r\nlanding at Wonsan had pointed to an early end of the Korean conflict.\r\nMassive Chinese intervention in November 1950, however, changed\r\nthe prospect of a short war to a long one and made it necessary to\r\nimplement a rotation and release policy. By March 1951, HQMC had\r\nworked out a preliminary phaseout program for reserve personnel (based\r\non the various categories and length of service prior to recall) which\r\nwas put into effect in June 1951.\r\n\r\nDuring 1952 and up until July 1953, approximately 500 officers and\r\n15,500 enlisted men joined the 1st Marine Division in Korea every six\r\nmonths. Individual monthly replacement drafts generally ranged from\r\n1,900 to 2,500, depending on the combat situation and other personnel\r\nneeds within the Marine Corps. Monthly rotation drafts of Marines\r\nassigned to the States or other duty stations from Korea were usually\r\nsomewhat smaller than their corresponding incoming numbers. Ranks and\r\nMOS of replacement personnel to the end of the war, however, did not\r\nalways meet the needs of the division. Specialty training conducted\r\nby the 1st Marine Division in Korea helped remedy most of the worst\r\ndeficiencies.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter half of 1952 and throughout 1953, tours for Marine\r\npilots/combat air crews averaged 9 months, and for aviation ground\r\nofficer/enlisted personnel, 12 months. Following a detailed HQMC\r\nstudy of the advantages of tactical unit as opposed to individual\r\npilot rotation, a new squadron replacement policy was instituted.\r\nThis procedure assured standard precombat training of all pilots[725]\r\nand development of a team spirit prior to the squadron’s arrival in\r\nthe combat theater. Previously this had not been possible with the\r\ncontinuing turnover of 1st MAW personnel under the individual release\r\nsystem. Despite plans during 1952–1953 for replacement and rotation of\r\nsquadrons as an entity, this did not come about until late in the war\r\nwhen carrier squadron VMA-312 was replaced by VMA-332 in June 1953.\r\nWith the end of hostilities, tours were extended to approximately 14\r\nmonths for both aviation and ground Marines.\r\n\r\n    [725] Even as late as July 1952, the influx of Class III\r\n          volunteer reserve pilots, many of whom lacked adequate\r\n          recent precombat flying experience, had presented a\r\n          serious wing personnel problem and resulted in on-the-job\r\n          training for pilots in the VMO-6 fixed-wing section.\r\n          As another measure to improve squadron operational\r\n          proficiency and partially correct weaknesses of the\r\n          individual pilot rotation system and fast turnover, a\r\n          100-mission ceiling was inaugurated in February 1953.\r\n          This applied to aviators in the VMF/VMA tactical units,\r\n          with the exception of VMF(N)-513 pilots who were rotated\r\n          after 60 missions.\r\n\r\nBuildup of Marine Corps personnel during the Korean War from the June\r\n1950 base of 74,279 is seen in the following strength figures:\r\n\r\n  June 1951             192,620 Marines on active duty\r\n  June 1952             231,967 Marines on active duty\r\n  June 1953             249,219 Marines on active duty\r\n\r\nAltogether, an estimated 424,000 Marines served during the period of\r\nhostilities. The war also witnessed a sizable increase in the number of\r\nNegro Marines on active duty. This figure grew from 2 officers/1,965\r\nenlisted in 1950 to 19 officers/14,468 enlisted by 1953. Marine\r\nofficials commented on their fine combat performance, including that\r\nof many outstanding NCOs. In line with the changing climate of events\r\nand legislation,[726] the Korean War marked the first time that Negro\r\npersonnel were fully integrated into the military services, in contrast\r\nto the segregated units before and during World War II.\r\n\r\n    [726] Assignment of Negro personnel in the armed forces\r\n          continued to expand as a result of the President’s 1948\r\n          Executive Order on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity.\r\n          The Far East Command in July 1951 and the European\r\n          Command in April 1952 initiated steps towards the racial\r\n          integration of combat units, followed by similar programs\r\n          for service units. Semianl Rpt SecDef (1 Jan-30 Jun\r\n          1952), p. 21.\r\n\r\nPeak strength of the Marine Corps during the Korean emergency occurred\r\non 30 September 1953, when 261,343 were on duty. At the end of the war,\r\n33,107 Marines (26,072 division, 7,035 wing) were stationed in Korea.\r\nThe time of peak deployed strength in Korea during 1950–1953 appears to\r\nhave been April 1953, when Marines of the 1st Division/Wing numbered\r\n35,306.[727]\r\n\r\n    [727] For detailed breakdown of figures, see 1stMarDiv, 1st MAW\r\n          ComdDs, Apr 53 and _PacFlt Eval Rpt_ No. 6, Chap. 9, p.\r\n          9-54, Chap. 10, p. 10-29. Also, _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5,\r\n          Chap. 8, p. 8-33 and No. 4, Chap. 9, p. 9-26.\r\n\r\nWhile the Korean War was still in progress, Congress passed new\r\nlegislation to remedy certain shortcomings that had become apparent\r\nduring the emergency, particularly the Nation’s recent experience\r\nwith partial mobilization. These new laws affected the size of the\r\nFMF structure of the Marine Corps, its active-duty strength, and its\r\nreserve component.\r\n\r\nPublic Law 416, enacted 28 June 1952, represented several major\r\nadvances for the Marine Corps. It authorized an increase of Marine\r\nCorps strength to a minimum of three combat divisions and three wings;\r\nraised the ceiling of regular active-duty personnel to 400,000 (except\r\nfor normal expansion in a national emergency or war); and provided\r\nfor the Commandant to sit as co-equal member of the Joint Chiefs\r\nof Staff[728] on matters of direct concern to the Marine Corps. In\r\nreaffirming the role of Marine Corps in the seizure and defense of\r\nadvanced naval bases, as well as land operations incident to naval\r\ncampaigns, the law also cited the corollary Marine Corps mission of\r\n“performing such other duties as the President may direct.” Commenting\r\non Public Law 416, the Commandant observed: “Our views are considered.\r\nOur interests are protected. The entire Marine Corps has benefited\r\ngreatly by these gains.”[729] General Shepherd further noted that the\r\nnew legislation “expresses clearly the intent that the Marine Corps\r\nshall be maintained as a ready fighting force prepared to move promptly\r\nin time of peace or war to areas of trouble. It recognizes that in the\r\nfuture there may be a series of continuing international crises--each\r\nshort of all-out war, but each requiring our nation ... to move shock\r\nforces into action on the shortest of notice.”[730]\r\n\r\n    [728] Previously, Marine Corps views had been represented at\r\n          the JCS level by the SecNav or CNO.\r\n\r\n    [729] _Generals’ Summary_, p. 1.\r\n\r\n    [730] Thomas, Heinl, and Ageton, _op. cit._, p. 70.\r\n\r\nThe two new laws affecting the future training and composition of\r\nthe Marine Corps and other services were: (1) the Universal Military\r\nTraining and Service Act (UMT&S), as amended, approved 19 June 1951;\r\nand (2) the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 (Public Law 476), approved\r\n9 July 1952. Basically, the two laws sought to establish a sounder\r\nmobilization base and were complementary in nature. The Armed Forces\r\nReserve Act of 1952 implemented a new mobilization concept: either\r\na partial or total callup of the Nation’s reserve forces. In the\r\npast, the M-Day target had been geared to a total war only. A limited\r\nwar, resulting in a partial, Korean-type mobilization, had not been\r\nenvisioned. The 1952 act thereby provided greater flexibility for\r\ndealing with both contingencies and also consolidated much of the\r\nexisting legislation affecting reserve forces.\r\n\r\nMembers of the reserve were newly designated by different categories\r\nof M-Day priority: ready, standby, and retired reserve. These\r\nvarying degrees of availability for callup reflected training status\r\n(OMCR/volunteer), length of prior service, and related factors (i.e.,\r\nmen with the least service were designated for first callup, or the\r\n“Ready” category.) Previously, they were all equally subject for recall\r\nin an emergency, regardless of prior service.\r\n\r\nThe 1952 act and its new provisions thereby distinguished between a\r\nfuture national emergency and an all-out war. Theoretically, at least,\r\na national emergency could be proclaimed by the President, calling for\r\na partial mobilization, as in Korea. A declaration of war by Congress,\r\nas in World War II, would call for total mobilization. Thus the Marine\r\nCorps Reserve was newly earmarked for either a partial or total\r\nmobilization.\r\n\r\nUnder UMT&S, a military service obligation of eight years was\r\nestablished for all young men under age 26 entering the armed forces\r\n(whether by enlistment, draft, appointment, or reserve) after 19 June\r\n1951. The act also authorized drafting of male citizens for two-year\r\nactive duty periods. This new system of eight-year obligors provided\r\nthe post-Korean MCR with a stable body of personnel who had received\r\ntheir basic training but still had a reserve obligation.\r\n\r\nAlso as a result of the Korean mobilization, the Organized Marine\r\nCorps Reserve troop list was modified in order to provide a manpower\r\npool for additional elements of the regular establishment. Supply,\r\nservice, and security units were added to provide more of an FMF type\r\nof augmentation than that furnished by reserve units in the past.\r\nReestablishment of the OMCR began in October 1951, when the first group\r\nof recalled reservists were released from Korean duty. Plans called for\r\na larger reserve and more comprehensive training. Ground units were to\r\nbe increased from 138 to approximately 255, with the air squadrons to\r\nnumber 42. The Volunteer Reserve was similarly to be strengthened by\r\nstricter requirements for participation.\r\n\r\nTraditionally the mission of the Marine Corps Reserve, since 1916,\r\nhad been defined as “providing trained personnel for integration into\r\nthe Marine Corps in time of national emergency.” The strengthened MCR\r\nprogram as a result of Korea and the new laws led to a more serious\r\nreappraisal of its role. In looking to its post-Korea future, the\r\nMarine Corps planned a revitalized training program that would now\r\n“assist in extending the ‘force-in-readiness’ concept to the Marine\r\nCorps Reserve.”[731] More than ever before, the Marine Corps sought to\r\nmake its reserve a mirror-image of the regular establishment.\r\n\r\n    [731] _Generals’ Summary_, p. 96.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Problems Peculiar to the Korean War_[732]\r\n\r\n    [732] Unless otherwise noted, the material in this section is\r\n          derived from: _PacFlt EvalRpts_ No. 4, Chaps. 9, 10, No.\r\n          5, Chaps. 1, 8, 9, No. 6, Chaps. 1, 9, 10; _USMC Board\r\n          Rpt_ vs. I-II; 1st Marine Division Training Bulletin\r\n          No. 5-53, “Lessons Learned,” dtd 10 Jun 53, hereafter\r\n          _Lessons Learned 5-53_; _Generals’ Summary_; Futrell,\r\n          _USAF, Korea_; Heinl, _Soldiers of Sea_.\r\n\r\nThe undeclared war of Communist China against United Nations forces\r\nresulted in major changes in high-level policy and strategy that\r\naffected military tactics for the rest of the war. In an attempt to\r\nprevent escalation of Korean hostilities into an all-out nuclear war,\r\nthe decision was made that U.N. forces, both ground and air, would not\r\nstrike enemy bases in Chinese territory. After the beginning of truce\r\nnegotiations in July 1951, the mission of Allied ground forces was\r\nchanged from initiating offensive operations to one of maintaining an\r\nactive defense of the MLR across Korea. The basic strategy became one\r\nof containment and prevention of any further enemy gains south of the\r\n38th Parallel. It involved attempting to inflict maximum losses on the\r\nenemy while attempting to minimize those of the UNC. Militarily, these\r\nrestrictions removed the possibility of winning a decisive victory.\r\nFor the next two years, fighting seesawed back and forth across the\r\nparallel.\r\n\r\nStatic and defensive warfare thus characterized the greater part of\r\nthe Korean War. During this period, the Marine division performed\r\na land war mission similar to other Eighth Army components while\r\nMarine aviation squadrons flew under control of Fifth Air Force. Both\r\nthe 1st Marine Division and 1st Marine Aircraft Wing faced tactical\r\nrestrictions that resulted from the strategic policies governing\r\nthe overall role of EUSAK and FAF. Problem areas arose from the\r\nlimited nature of this particular war. These involved not only the\r\nshift in the UNC strategy from an offensive posture to a defensive\r\n(“active defense”) concept, but also from the paralyzing effect of the\r\nprotracted truce negotiations on battlefield tactics.\r\n\r\nFor nearly two years (16 months in West Korea and 5 months earlier\r\nwhile in IX Corps on the East-Central front), the Marine division\r\nassumed an unaccustomed defensive role. Such a sustained, basically\r\nnon-win position was hardly morale-building to the average Marine\r\nunable to see personally any yardage gained, any progress made in his\r\nparticular war. Not surprisingly, such a passive battle assignment\r\ndid result in a temporary loss of amphibious skills on the part of\r\nboth individual Marines and the division. End-of-war evaluations noted\r\nthat “long and indecisive defensive situations such as existed in\r\nKorea do little to foster the offensive spirit so long traditional\r\nwith the Marine Corps and certainly tend to detract from the immediate\r\namphibious readiness required of a Marine Division.”[733]\r\n\r\n    [733] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, p. 9-2.\r\n\r\nPrior to its tour of duty as I Corps reserve in mid-1953, the 1st\r\nMarine Division had noted that it would “require intensive training\r\nand reequipping for a period of at least 60 days” upon release from\r\nactive combat in order to “reach a desirable standard of amphibious\r\nreadiness.”[734] Rigorous MARLEX and RCT exercises initiated in June\r\n1952 after the division had moved to the western coastal sector off\r\nthe Yellow Sea and expanded during its I Corps reserve period, were\r\nimportant steps in rectifying this skill attrition. This was, of\r\ncourse, in addition to the continuous training schedule in offensive\r\nand defensive warfare maintained by the division for the battalions and\r\nregiment periodically in regular reserve status.\r\n\r\n    [734] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, p. 8-5. Subsequently, the\r\n          division’s ground readiness was rated as excellent; a\r\n          conservative estimate placed individual unit amphibious\r\n          readiness at between 25 and 60 percent; and indicated\r\n          a 30-day training period would bring the division to\r\n          complete amphibious readiness. _Generals’ Summary_, p. 53.\r\n\r\nOutpost warfare in West Korea was characterized by overextended MLR\r\nfrontage. The more than 60,000 yards held by the division while in the\r\nI Corps sector resulted in a thinly-held line which invited penetration\r\nand encirclement. “Normal” frontage for an infantry division in defense\r\nwith two regiments on line was considered by U.S. Army doctrine to be\r\n8–9,000 yards. Even with four MLR regiments (two Marine, 1st KMC/RCT,\r\nand KPR) and the 1st Amphibian Tractor Battalion on line (the third\r\nMarine regiment in reserve with a counterattack mission), this was\r\na very lengthy sector. It was further complicated by the Han River\r\nobstacle on the left flank and the Imjin River to the rear of the\r\nsector that separated Marine frontline troops from rear support and\r\nreserve units.\r\n\r\nInfantry battalions thus occupied “extremely wide fronts, as a\r\nrule 3,500 to 5,000 yards,” while individual rifle companies were\r\nassigned anywhere from “1,200 to 1,700 yards of the MLR to occupy and\r\ndefend.”[735] Prior to the battle of the Hook in October 1952, one of\r\nthe major engagements on the western front, the 7th Marines at the far\r\nright end of the division sector had emplaced all three battalions on\r\nline, rather than the customary procedure of two on line and the third\r\nin reserve. There was little other choice, for the regimental sector\r\nexceeded 10,000 yards, “more properly the frontage for a division\r\nrather than a regiment.”[736]\r\n\r\n    [735] _Lessons Learned_ 5-53, p. 19.\r\n\r\n    [736] Hicks, _Outpost Warfare_, p. 107.\r\n\r\nDuring a 100 percent watch, at least theoretically, a Marine could\r\nbe spaced at intervals about every 10 to 15 yards along the MLR. A\r\nnight 50 percent watch--with personnel of rifle platoons assigned to\r\nCOPs, listening posts, combat patrols, repair of fortifications, and\r\nthe KSC nightly supply trains--not infrequently spread personnel to a\r\npoint where the MLR was dangerously thin, often with 50 yards between\r\nmen.[737] Such an over-wide lineal deployment dissipated defensive\r\nstrength and made mutually supporting fires difficult.\r\n\r\n    [737] Lessons Learned, _op. cit_.\r\n\r\nDivision artillery, too, was thinly positioned across the wide sector,\r\nmaking it difficult to execute counterbattery missions. This led to\r\ndevelopment of the innovative counter-counterbattery program (or\r\n“roving guns”) devised by the 11th Marines in May 1952 to deliberately\r\nmislead the CCF as to the strength and location of divisional\r\nartillery; the situation resulted as well in the reinforcement of the\r\nfour Marine artillery battalions by heavier I Corps 155mm and 8-inch\r\nhowitzers. The static situation in the prolonged land campaign also\r\nled to the growth of large, semi-permanent type camps which somewhat\r\nhampered traditional Marine mobility. Organizations had additional\r\npersonnel and equipment above T/O and T/E because of the peculiar\r\ndefense requirements of the sustained battle situation.\r\n\r\nThe lack of depth in the defense did not provide for receiving the\r\nshock of a determined enemy attack, particularly since the normal\r\nOPLR had been withdrawn to strengthen the overextended MLR in April\r\n1952, shortly after the division’s arrival in West Korea. Ultimately,\r\nas we have seen, this main line of resistance concept was modified\r\nand rather than a long thin trenchline the Marine division employed a\r\ndefense-in-depth concept using a series of strongpoints, as in Boulder\r\nCity and the organization of the postwar main battle position. In\r\ncontrast to the Marine situation (and that of most other divisions\r\nin the EUSAK line), the CCF confronting the 1st Marine Division\r\nbeyond No-Man’s-Land deployed their forces in great depth, boasted\r\nunlimited manpower, and employed an elastic type of defense on mutually\r\nsupporting key terrain features. The enemy had also developed an\r\nartillery capability that was numerically superior to ours. And they\r\nheld high ground positions that overlooked virtually the entire Marine\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nAs in World War II, Korean operations provided another instance in\r\nwhich various military services and components were coordinated by\r\njoint commands: EUSAK for the ground defense and FAF for air. These\r\nmassive operational command structures accomplished the desired\r\ngoals. On lower level echelons, however, some policies tended to\r\nbe so restrictive that they precluded normal combat initiative and\r\naggressiveness. The net result was thus to allow the enemy to maintain\r\nthe tactical initiative while, in effect, hampering UNC counter-defense\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nNew directives issued by I Corps in late 1952, for example, changed the\r\ncorps policy of large-scale raids for prisoners, previously encouraged\r\nin the spring of 1952, which affected infantry raids and patrol\r\nactivities for the rest of the war. Plans for all raids, company size\r\nor larger, required both I Corps and EUSAK approval, and were to be\r\nsubmitted 10 days prior to planned execution. Complete patrol plans\r\nfor even platoon-size operations had to be submitted at least 24 hours\r\nin advance. Although the reason for the new policy stemmed from a\r\ndesire to minimize casualties during the prolonged stalemate, negative\r\neffects of such a lead-time factor were quickly apparent. Battalion or\r\nregimental commanders frequently were unable to capitalize on targets\r\nof opportunity that developed or changes in local conditions, such as\r\nweather or troop deployment, to gain maximum effectiveness from the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nDirectives covering offensive maneuvers that could be taken on local\r\ninitiative were so restrictive that “any independent action below the\r\nlevel of the Division Commander became practically nonexistent.”[738]\r\nSimilarly, counterattack plans to retake previously considered major\r\nCOPs were countermanded, on several occasions, by corps or army higher\r\nechelons shortly before jump-off time with the reason given that the\r\naction was not worth the cost of further UNC casualties or possible\r\njeopardy to the fragile peace negotiations.\r\n\r\n    [738] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, p. 9-84.\r\n\r\nAllied offensive capability was further restricted by various EUSAK and\r\nI Corps orders issued during the protracted period of truce talks. Many\r\ndirectives had as their well-intentioned rationale the desire not to\r\nupset the precarious balance in UNC-Communist negotiations by providing\r\nthe enemy further opportunities for exploitative propaganda victories.\r\nThe actual record shows, however, that the Communists were never at a\r\nloss to conjure up and capitalize on fabricated “events” that suited\r\ntheir purpose--whether charging UNC aircraft had violated the Kaesong\r\nneutrality strip, that American fliers were engaging in germ warfare,\r\nor deliberately instigating POW camp disruptions and breakouts.\r\n\r\nNeutrality restrictions[739] on supporting arms within the entire\r\nKaesong-Panmunjom-Munsan-ni area further complicated the UNC tactical\r\nsituation and hampered both offensive and defensive operations of the\r\n1st Marine Division. This was particularly true of the center Marine\r\nregimental sector which was bisected by the Panmunjom corridor and the\r\nno-fire lines. The truce talk neutral zone restrictions prevented the\r\nMarines in this area from massing their artillery fires on a desirable\r\nscale and also, at times, interfered with proper CAS delivery forward\r\nof the MLR. The numerous and sometimes conflicting “no-fly, no-fire”\r\nrestricting lines stemmed from original agreements made between UNC\r\nand Communist representatives in 1951. Subsequently, however, the\r\nprohibitions against firing any type of weapon in the area were\r\nmodified from time to time and added to by FAF, EUSAK, and I Corps,\r\n“each time adding to the frustration of the local commanders.”[740]\r\n\r\n    [739] Basically, these consisted of a no-hostile-act three-mile\r\n          circular area radiating from Kaesong; a six-mile radius\r\n          forbidding FAF planes in the skies over Kaesong and\r\n          another two-mile, no-fly radius over Panmunjom; and\r\n          various other prohibitions on military craft, air-dropped\r\n          leaflets, and firing of artillery to include propaganda\r\n          shell leaflets.\r\n\r\n    [740] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, 9-78.\r\n\r\nThe double-standard effect of the neutrality restrictions became\r\nreadily apparent, however. The CCF artfully used this area, by means\r\nof his tactics of “creeping” toward the Allied MLR, as a supply and\r\nreserve buildup location. The enemy emplaced artillery, assembled\r\ntroops, and even used the neutral territory for equipment buildups,\r\nincluding tanks, in the Kaesong vicinity.[741] Thus the restrictive\r\nlines gave the enemy an opportunity to maneuver within an approximate\r\n12 square-mile area, all within effective artillery range and outside\r\nof the Kaesong-Panmunjom restricted territory, but UNC units were\r\npowerless to take any action.\r\n\r\n    [741] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 4, p. 9-37.\r\n\r\nIntelligence operations, during the latter stages of the war, were\r\nnot considered optimum--for either the division or wing. While dug in\r\non the western end of I Corps, the Marine information effort had been\r\n“seriously hampered by the lack of prisoners of war.”[742] Only 94 CCF\r\nhad been captured by the division during the period, compared with more\r\nthan 2,000 prisoners taken earlier on the East-Central front.[743]\r\nThis deficiency was attributed to the “static defensive situation, the\r\nreluctance of the Chinese to surrender and the heavy volume of fire\r\nplaced on our reconnaissance patrols.”[744]\r\n\r\n    [742] _Generals’ Summary_, p. 39.\r\n\r\n    [743] Between December 1950-July 1953, the 1st Marine Division\r\n          took 2,445 _NKPA/CCF_, with an additional 656 enemy\r\n          seized by its attached 1st KMC/RCT, or a total of\r\n          3,101. Marine capturing units included Headquarters\r\n          Battalion, 1st Tank Battalion, 11th Marines, the three\r\n          infantry regiments, and 7th Motor Transport Battalion. An\r\n          additional 4,792 POWs were also taken by the 1st Division\r\n          in the early Inchon-Seoul operations. G-1 Folder, Aug 53\r\n          (Box 4), “Personnel Periodic Rpt. No. 94,” dtd 15–31 Aug\r\n          53; _USMC Board Rpt_, v. I, p. II-B-46.\r\n\r\n    [744] _Generals’ Summary_, p. 39.\r\n\r\nIn the air, photo reconnaissance results were not rated entirely\r\nsatisfactory as a source of current information by either air or ground\r\nMarines. The command channels in effect designated the Air Force as\r\nresponsible agent for control and coordination of all photo missions\r\nin Korea. Requests for photographic missions thus were relayed on to\r\nFAF and flown by its Reconnaissance Wing or the Marines’ own VMJ-1\r\nsquadron. The system produced relatively good vertical coverage with\r\nphotos available in about 10 days. Special requests for immediate\r\ncoverage on areas of local importance, however, customarily were either\r\nnot flown or “delayed to the point where they were of no value”[745]\r\nbecause the tactical situation had been changed.\r\n\r\n    [745] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nDelays were due to the shortage of photographic aircraft throughout\r\nFAF and the limited provision in T/Os for photo interpretation.\r\nIntelligence of air-strike targets (particularly post-strike) was\r\nconsistently mediocre. Oblique photos of frontline positions took an\r\naverage of three-four days to be processed and sometimes longer. As\r\nan expedient, aerial observers began to shoot their own vertical and\r\noblique photos with hand-held cameras slung over the side of a VMO-6\r\nplane.\r\n\r\nProbably the most serious problem of all, from the Marine Corps point\r\nof view, was that during much of the Korean War Marine air-ground\r\ncomponents, trained to work as a team, were to a large extent\r\nprecluded from operating together. The separate missions of the wing\r\nand division reflected, on a smaller scale, the divergent UNC air and\r\nground doctrine and tactics. After the early moving battles, Korean\r\nhostilities had settled down to a protracted land war in which ground\r\nand air tactical commands did not operate jointly and were never\r\ncoordinated to deal a truly devastating blow to the enemy. Since the\r\nKorean War was a limited one most of the fighting was confined to the\r\nstabilized front across Korea. Both air and naval forces were viewed\r\nlargely as supporting arms for the ground operation.\r\n\r\nDue to political-military considerations, UNC tactical air power had\r\nbeen, in effect, handcuffed so that its use would not appear “overly\r\naggressive” and threaten an enlargement of the Korean hostilities into\r\na nuclear armageddon of World War III.[746] Since the earliest days of\r\nthe war, a strict embargo had been placed on any bombing of Chinese\r\nrear supply areas or industrial complexes although it was obvious that\r\nmuch of the enemy’s logistical strength lay beyond the Manchurian\r\nborder.\r\n\r\n    [746] Much of the unwritten but basic policy mitigating against\r\n          full use of Allied air superiority stemmed from the\r\n          desire to employ “humanitarian” standards in the UNC war\r\n          effort. Following WW II there had been wide criticism\r\n          of the “moral wrong of massed air bombardment” as well\r\n          as employment of the atomic bomb by the U. S. to hasten\r\n          the end of the war. The UNC goal, in Korea, was to avoid\r\n          needless civilian casualties and for air strikes to be\r\n          directed against purely military targets. Futrell, _USAF\r\n          Korea_, p. 41.\r\n\r\nAir efforts were concentrated largely on nuisance or harassing raids\r\nwithin North Korea and close air support efforts of various types,\r\nrather than a systematic destruction of the enemy’s primary supply\r\ninstallation’s. Some ranking officers had informally interpreted\r\nofficial Washington policy as “Don’t employ airpower so that the\r\nenemy will get mad and won’t sign the armistice.”[747] Indeed, it was\r\nnot until after the Communists had rejected what the UNC called its\r\n“final truce package,” in April 1952, that it was decided to exert\r\ngreater pressure against the Communists. The list of approved aerial\r\ntargets was then enlarged to include North Korean hydroelectric power\r\nfacilities, previously exempted from air attack.\r\n\r\n    [747] _Ibid._, p. 402.\r\n\r\nFrom late 1950 until early 1953, Marine air squadrons were assigned\r\ndirectly by FAF, with CG, 1st MAW, having virtually no tactical control\r\nover his own units. Marine Corps aerial doctrine traditionally employed\r\nclose air support of ground operations as the primary role of its air\r\narm. FEAF and FAF, however, in their interpretation of employment of\r\ntactical air power directed FAF maximum efforts toward interdiction\r\nmissions, sometimes even to the expense of immediate CAS needs.[748]\r\nAs Far East Air Forces stated late in 1951, “when required, close air\r\nsupport of United Nations Army forces may take precedence over other\r\nFEAF programs.”[749] Interdiction, general support, and close support\r\nmissions were the normal order of priorities flown by _FEAF_-FAF.\r\n\r\n    [748] Comments Futrell, _USAF, Korea_, pp. 430–431: “Despite\r\n          the fact that responsible Eighth Army and Fifth Air\r\n          Force commanders had decided that the rail-interdiction\r\n          attacks would best accomplish the United Nations mission\r\n          in Korea, Eighth Army subordinate commanders were gravely\r\n          dissatisfied with the limitations [96 sorties daily for\r\n          the entire Eighth Army front, decided upon by EUSAK-_FAF_\r\n          in November 1951] placed on close support.” One of\r\n          those dissenting subordinates at the time was CG, 1st\r\n          Mar Div. Following the September 1951 heavy fighting in\r\n          the Punchbowl area, General Thomas officially described\r\n          the Marine division’s air support as unsatisfactory and\r\n          stated his division had “taken unnecessary casualties\r\n          because its air support had not been adequate or timely.”\r\n          Average elapsed time between the division’s CAS requests\r\n          and its 187 approved missions that month had been nearly\r\n          two hours. Only 32 immediate air-support requests had\r\n          been filled within 30 minutes.\r\n\r\n    [749] _Ibid._, p. 432.\r\n\r\nOperation STRANGLE, the 10-month, all-out, air interdiction campaign\r\nduring 1951–1952 originally had as its objective the destruction of\r\nthe North Korean road-rail network. The interdiction program had\r\nbeen defined at first as a move to “paralyze enemy transportation in\r\nthe zone between the railheads at the 39th Parallel and the front\r\nlines.”[750] and later somewhat more conservatively as a measure to so\r\n“disrupt the enemy’s lines of communication ... that he will be unable\r\nto contain a determined offensive by friendly forces ... or to mount a\r\nsustained offensive himself.”[751]\r\n\r\n    [750] _Ibid._, p. 296.\r\n\r\n    [751] _Ibid._, pp. 435–436.\r\n\r\nDespite more than 87,552 interdiction sorties flown during the period,\r\nCinCFE daily intelligence summaries showed that aerial harassment of\r\nthe CCF had not hindered their defensive efforts. Instead, by the\r\nsummer of 1952 the enemy had “actually doubled in troop strength,\r\nreinforced their artillery strength to equal that of the UN forces,\r\ndeveloped a tremendous AA capability, and established the capability\r\nfor launching a general offensive.”[752] With UNC air and sea\r\nsuperiority, the Chinese Communists had still succeeded in keeping\r\ntheir main supply route open. Rail track cuts were being repaired in\r\nas little as 36 hours. And the CCF was employing more fire power than\r\never: in May 1952, some 102,000 rounds fell against UNC positions\r\ncompared to only 8,000 the previous July.\r\n\r\n    [752] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, p. 9-58.\r\n\r\nEven the retiring UNC Supreme Commander, General Ridgway, admitted\r\nbefore Congressional representatives in 1952 that the enemy had greater\r\noffensive potential than ever before, and the Commander, Seventh Fleet,\r\nVice Admiral Joseph J. Clark, declared flatly: “The interdiction\r\nprogram was a failure ... It did _not_ interdict.”[753] USAF spokesmen\r\nfelt it had attained its limited purpose but opined: “Seen abstractly,\r\nthe United Nations railway-interdiction campaign was defensive and\r\npreventive rather than offensive and positive.”[754] In early 1952, CG,\r\nFAF, General Everest, recognizing that his pilots “had been so long\r\nengaged in interdiction attacks that they were losing their skills in\r\nclose support”[755] inaugurated a new system. Beginning in March all\r\nfighter-bomber squadrons were to be rotated on weekly close-support\r\nmissions.\r\n\r\n    [753] Cagle and Manson, _Sea War, Korea_, p. 270.\r\n\r\n    [754] Futrell, _USAF, Korea_, pp. 437–438.\r\n\r\n    [755] _Ibid._, p. 434.\r\n\r\nActually, the skies had begun to clear for Marine aviation operational\r\ndifficulties by the latter half of 1952. A better understanding had\r\ndeveloped between both high-level officials and the working day-to-day\r\nliaison operations at JOC CG, 1st MAW had “established his position\r\nso firmly he was able to guide establishment of the policies which\r\ngoverned his operations merely by expressing his desires to CG 5th\r\nAF.”[756] The battle for Bunker Hill in August 1952 had marked\r\nexcellent cooperation between Eighth Army and FAF, with the 1st Marine\r\nDivision receiving air priority for two days. In any event, matters\r\nwere substantially improved from late 1951-early 1952 when, during a\r\n12-month period, 1st MAW CAS sorties for 1st MarDiv had plummeted to\r\nthe incredibly low figure of 1,956[757] or 15.8 percent of the wing’s\r\ntotal 12,372 CAS sorties during FY 1952 (1Jul51–30Jun52).\r\n\r\n    [756] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, p. 9-45.\r\n\r\n    [757] By contrast: in FY 1951, 1st MAW CAS sorties for\r\n          1stMarDiv were 7,000 of total 14,028 CAS sorties, or 50\r\n          percent; for FY 1953, the _figure_ was 4,912 of total\r\n          14,540 CAS sorties, or 32.4 percent. _Generals’ Summary_,\r\n          Chart C, following p. 58.\r\n\r\nCommenting on this unhappy period for both air and infantry Marines,\r\nLieutenant General Richard C. Mangrum, USMC (Retired), who was CO,\r\nMAG-12 during part of the STRANGLE operations, said “for the rest of\r\n1951 and well into 1952 the major effort of my Group and of MAG-33 was\r\ndevoted to cutting the rail lines in North Korea. Without success, of\r\ncourse. Little by little we were able to increase the percentages of\r\neffort devoted to close support of the troops.”[758] And by the last\r\nsix months of the war the bulk of all CAS missions received by the\r\ndivision were flown by 1st MAW aircraft, in contrast to earlier periods\r\nwhen a third or half of the division’s sorties were Marine-flown. As\r\nthe last Korean War Wing CG noted, despite basic differences between\r\nArmy-Air Force and Marine Corps-Navy concept and tactics, ultimately\r\n“the commanders of the Fifth Air Force in actual daily practice\r\ndecentralized control to a marked degree.”[759]\r\n\r\n    [758] Quoted in Heinl, _Soldiers of Sea_, p. 647.\r\n\r\n    [759] MajGen V. E. Megee, “Tactical Air Support of Ground\r\n          Forces,” _Marine Corps Gazette_, v. 39, no. 12 (Dec 55),\r\n          p. 17.\r\n\r\nThroughout the war, however, a lack of standardized terms and\r\ndifferences in request procedures continued to exist. (This was\r\nresolved by using Marine control procedures when flying for the\r\ndivision, and Army-Air Force procedures when scrambled on flights for\r\nother divisions.) Whereas EUSAK-FAF considered strikes inside the\r\nbombline[760] as “close air support” and those outside it as “general\r\nsupport,” the Marine CAS concept was one of support in close proximity\r\nto frontlines (ranging from 50 to 500 yards out) that affects the fire\r\nand maneuver of those ground units. In the hands of Marine FACs, Marine\r\nplanes employed on close support strikes had a definite influence on\r\nthe MLR tactical situation.\r\n\r\n    [760] The bombline had been moved in to an average of 3–4,000\r\n          meters from the MLR in December 1952 to expose more\r\n          targets to the “mass” strike treatment.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the Marine system of maintaining aircraft “on air alert”\r\nresulted in CAS requests being filled in 5 to 15 minutes. Air support\r\nrequests screened in the regular manner by Eighth Army and FAF at the\r\nJOC level resulted in a delivery of ordnance to the target in a minimum\r\nof 30 minutes and delays sometimes of nearly four hours.[761] During\r\nfluid situations, when the division required more than 40 sorties per\r\nday, the “on station” system proved more tactically effective than the\r\nFAF pre-planned “on call” procedure.\r\n\r\n    [761] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ Chap. 1, No. 6, p. 1-15.\r\n\r\nOperational differences between the Marine-Navy and Army-Air Force type\r\nof CAS in a critical ground situation were never more apparent than\r\nin a major CCF last-ditch effort when the enemy slammed against ROK\r\ndefenses in the Kumsong area. An end-of-war report noted:\r\n\r\n  CCF penetration of the II ROK Corps sector, in July, 1953,\r\n  brought clearly into focus the ineffectiveness of the Air\r\n  Force-Army close air support (CAS) system during periods of fluid\r\n  operations. CCF eruption through the II ROK Corps MLR and deep\r\n  into friendly territory eliminated, as effective or practical,\r\n  the complete reliance by 5th AF on pre-planned CAS strikes (using\r\n  aircraft from the ground-alert pool), against fleeting targets\r\n  or targets of an immediate nature. These types of targets are\r\n  considered normal during a fluid situation.\r\n\r\n  The inadequacy of communications for rapid transmission of\r\n  air support requests in the CAS system employed in Korea, the\r\n  impossibility of only four TACP’s per division (U.S. and ROK\r\n  Army) to keep up with frontline battalion battle actions in\r\n  order to control CAS strikes, and the over-centralization of\r\n  control of CAS request approvals and CAS aircraft allocation\r\n  were all clearly demonstrated during that period of fluid ground\r\n  operations in July.[762]\r\n\r\n    [762] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, p. 10-3.\r\n\r\nDespite the accommodation reached during the Korean War, many of these\r\nfundamental differences in doctrine and employment of air support to\r\nground troops in combat persisted until recent years.[763]\r\n\r\n    [763] For a penetrating discussion of interservice problems\r\n          dealing with air-ground liaison and communications, use\r\n          of FACs, and CAS capability, etc., see U.S. Congress,\r\n          Rpt of Special Subcommittee on Tactical Air Support of\r\n          the Committee on Armed Services, Otis G.

Most of the “lessons”\r\nlearned from the enemy, the tactical situation itself, and the terrain\r\nin Korea are derived largely from the later outpost warfare stage when\r\nthe Marines were employed in a stabilized and sustained defensive\r\nsituation similar to that facing other Allied units across the entire\r\nEighth Army front. Tactics of defense on a wide front, construction\r\nof permanent type field fortifications, and organization of the\r\nbattle position in difficult terrain was a new experience to Marines.\r\nThis period of limited objective attacks and battles of attrition\r\nhighlighted the importance of small unit tactics and demonstrated some\r\nmodified concepts regarding employment of supporting arms.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of outpost warfare, the 1st Marine Division\r\nwas never confronted by a general enemy offensive or combined\r\ninfantry-armor-artillery-air assault. The nature of the conflict was\r\none of limited objective attacks, with strong and sometimes sustained\r\nprobes. Typically, these were two-battalion assaults against a\r\nplatoon-size outpost.\r\n\r\nTime after time, as UNC defending troops learned, the CCF\r\ncharacteristic pattern of attack was repetitive and almost predictable.\r\nAfter dark, heavy preparatory fires deluged an isolated advance\r\noutpost. Crude, but effective, improvised demolitions often reduced\r\nCOP fortifications[765] so that the enemy could assail the position.\r\nWaves of attacking Chinese then overwhelmed the greatly outnumbered\r\ndefenders. Almost invariably the initial attack made on the front of\r\nthe position was a feint; the real attack would be made by troops\r\nthat had enveloped the position and moved to the rear. Enemy ambush\r\nforces were also located to the rear of the outpost, between the COP\r\nand MLR, at normal reinforcement routes to prevent both a pullback by\r\nthe defenders to the MLR and to stop reinforcements from reaching the\r\noutpost.\r\n\r\n    [765] If the enemy advanced closer than 50 yards, by closely\r\n          following under heavy preparatory fires, he could\r\n          penetrate the position. At this close range, normal\r\n          box-me-in artillery fires were not close enough to break\r\n          up the attack. _Lessons Learned_ 5-53, p. 10.\r\n\r\nEffective defensive fire plans for the COPs covered all likely enemy\r\napproaches and assembly areas, as well as close-in boxing fires of the\r\nCOP on all sides. Marine defense positions were sited for all-round\r\ndefense, with special attention paid to covering the rear approaches\r\nat night. This tactic of rear envelopment also applied on a smaller\r\nscale to patrols. Invariably the CCF maneuvered to the flanks and rear\r\nof a friendly patrol in an attempt to encircle it. The CCF skillfully\r\nemployed both the terrain and troops and regularly attacked from more\r\nthan one direction.\r\n\r\nExperience with Communist combat techniques forced UNC leaders to\r\nreevaluate their own night-fighting tactics. The Chinese had a marked\r\nsuperiority in night operations. Every major attack on Marine outposts\r\nduring the last year of the war was made at night. When they were\r\nnot directly assaulting a friendly site, the CCF advanced their own\r\nground positions by digging and their well-known creeping tactics. This\r\nenabled them to establish an OP line within small arms and mortar range\r\nof Marine COPs and the MLR. The battle for Bunker Hill came about as\r\na result of this enemy tactic. Organization in early 1952 of COP-2A,\r\nadjacent to the Panmunjom corridor, was in direct rebuttal to this same\r\ntactic. By such indirect methods, the Chinese were further able to\r\nextend their already favorable high ground positions which gave them\r\nobservation over practically all of the Marine front line. Defensively\r\nthe enemy used the cover of darkness equally well: mountain roads were\r\naswarm with trucks and supply movements, which UNC night-fighters and\r\nbombers slowed with only moderate success.\r\n\r\nSkilled, rapid construction of field fortifications and excellent\r\ncamouflage discipline by the enemy were also object lessons. Entrances\r\nto tunnels and caves, as well as the bunkers themselves were so\r\ncarefully disguised by fresh branches, weeds, logs, and other natural\r\nfoliage that they were rarely visible either by air observer or\r\naerial photographs. Active weapons positions were also effectively\r\ncamouflaged. Often 60mm and 82mm mortars were housed in bunkers and\r\nfired through a narrow opening at the top. If moved out temporarily\r\nto an open slope, they were quickly returned to the bunker to avoid\r\ndetection. The Chinese elaborate underground system of trenchworks and\r\nradial tunnels between forward and rear bunkers was sometimes as much\r\nas 35 yards long. Underground bunkers and tunnels often had 20 feet or\r\nmore of protective dirt cover and offered security from anything except\r\na direct aerial hit.\r\n\r\nDestruction of the enemy’s trenches, bunkers, and cave network by\r\nmedium and heavy artillery was only partially successful. Napalm was\r\ngenerally ineffective due to the lack of combustible materials in CCF\r\nground defenses. The well-prepared, deeply dug fortifications were\r\nvirtually impervious to anything less than air assaults with heavy\r\nordnance (1,000-pound bombs and over) which were required to destroy\r\nCCF reverse slope positions.\r\n\r\nA well dug-in secondary line was located four to eight miles to the\r\nrear of the Chinese MLR. Intelligence indicated that an attack to\r\ninfiltrate CCF defenses would “require the penetration of a fortified\r\narea to a minimum depth of 10 miles.”[766] Some Korean War analysts\r\nmaintained that behind their front line the Chinese had entrenched\r\nthe ridges to an average depth of 14 miles and that the enemy “could\r\nhave fallen back upon successive prepared positions for all that\r\ndistance.”[767] Although the trench warfare period of the Korean War\r\nwas often likened to World War I, the Chinese defensive works were\r\nestimated to have “ten times the depth of any belt of entrenchments\r\nin World War I.”[768] Some areas had even been engineered for defense\r\nagainst nuclear attack. Caves, tunnels, and particularly reverse slope\r\npositions also showed CCF skill in the selection and organization of\r\nterrain features.\r\n\r\n    [766] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 5, p. 8-29.\r\n\r\n    [767] Marshall, _Pork Chop Hill_, p. 24.\r\n\r\n    [768] _Ibid._, p. 116.\r\n\r\nBoth the nature of the ground fighting and weather in Korea quickly\r\nindicated that our bunker construction needed to be improved. Siting\r\nthem lower into the ground, so that the outline of the bunkers would\r\nnot make them such ready targets, and reinforcing them to withstand\r\na 105mm direct hit were steps in this direction. Use of sandbags (of\r\nwhich there was a continuing shortage) for both bunkers and trenches\r\nproved to be almost as much a problem as a solution. Bunkers above\r\nground shored up with sandbags frequently collapsed in times of heavy\r\nrains or Korean spring thawing conditions.\r\n\r\nOutpost warfare also proved that the average bunker often became a\r\ndeathtrap when used defensively. This was due to the enemy proclivity\r\nfor sealing entrances with their satchel charges, as occurred in the\r\nVegas Cities battle. It became evident that large living-fighting\r\nbunkers could easily turn into traps in which many men could become\r\ncasualties simultaneously, and from which few could fight. Despite\r\ntheir exposed nature, fighting holes were often safer. Some Korean\r\ncombat officers were of the opinion that rather than our six- to\r\neight-man bunkers, smaller two-man fighting units would be obviously\r\nfaster to build, more effective, and safer since they would present a\r\nsmaller target.\r\n\r\nA 1st Marine Division training bulletin issued near the end of the war\r\nstated categorically:\r\n\r\n  As a rule no bunker or cave should be large enough to accommodate\r\n  more than four men. If the cave is bombardment proof, there\r\n  is another greater danger that the men will fail to man their\r\n  fighting positions quickly enough after the enemy fire lifts or\r\n  ceases.[769]\r\n\r\n    [769] _Lessons Learned_, 5-53, p. 11.\r\n\r\nUNC reconnaissance and security activities also showed need for\r\nimprovement. Night raids, patrol operations, and ambushes were\r\nconducted continuously to maintain contact with the enemy, keep him\r\noff balance, and obtain intelligence. This type of mobile, small-unit\r\naction repeatedly indicated an urgent need for more basic training in\r\nnight combat operations at the squad and platoon level. The frequent\r\nbreakdown of communications in night fighting, whether it involved\r\na small patrol or besieged outpost, was particularly critical. Some\r\nregimental commanders noted the failure to employ properly organic\r\nsmall arms in combat action during darkness before requesting heavier\r\nsupporting fires. It was felt that the practice of calling for mortar\r\nor artillery fire to the exclusion of using small arms was a dangerous\r\npractice which was being overused and that “_even in the defense the\r\nspirit of the offensive must be maintained_.”[770] Meticulous planning\r\nwas vital for effective fire plans, alternate avenues of approach, and\r\nevacuation. Detailed rehearsals of raids were essential.\r\n\r\n    [770] 5thMar ComdD, Nov 52, App. VI, p. 4.\r\n\r\nNight operations proved it was necessary to have a combat patrol\r\nsufficiently large to allow for both the accomplishment of the mission\r\nand evacuation of casualties. In evaluating the Korean experience,\r\nMarine officers pointed to the difficulties of operating effectively\r\non “pitch black nights when a man could barely see his own hand in\r\nfront of him or when the most prominent terrain feature could not be\r\nsilhouetted.”[771] Some commanders declared that such circumstances\r\noften lead to patrols accidentally walking into minefields--their own,\r\nas well as the enemy’s.\r\n\r\n    [771] Batterton, _Korea Notes_, p. 34.\r\n\r\nIn their security measures, CCF strict policing of the battlefield\r\nafter either a small raid or major assault was well known to every\r\nMarine infantryman as part of the Chinese elaborate precautions to\r\npreserve order of battle identity. CCF counterintelligence efforts\r\nwere equally scrupulous. Despite extensive precautions to keep the\r\nrelief of the Marines by the 25th Infantry Division secret in May 1953,\r\nenemy psychological warfare loudspeakers predicted the relief date\r\none week in advance. Later they broadcast a change in date that was\r\nequally accurate. Two heavy enemy probes made in July while individual\r\nbattalion reliefs were in process also demonstrated the Chinese acuity\r\nin intelligence activities.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for UNC commanders to avoid a fixed pattern in operations\r\nwas insufficiently recognized. A battle diary found on a CCF soldier\r\nkilled in early 1953, had observed about the Americans:\r\n\r\n  Two days before an enemy relief they clamor in their trenches,\r\n  and at the same time heavily bombard our positions.\r\n\r\n  For small scale attacks, the enemy sends out a small group of\r\n  men crawling on their hands and knees; however, in large scale\r\n  attacks, they intensely bombard our positions.\r\n\r\n  An enemy artillery bombardment following air reconnaissance\r\n  indicates that the enemy will probably launch a ground attack\r\n  within a short period.[772]\r\n\r\n    [772] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6 p. 9-58 citing Eighth U.S. Army\r\n          PIR No. 948.\r\n\r\nAs the CG, 1st Marine Division further commented about overuse of\r\nestablished procedures:\r\n\r\n  The same tactics and techniques should not be followed in every\r\n  raid. The pattern should be altered to the extent that the\r\n  tactics and techniques employed will not indicate the objective\r\n  to the enemy. The time selected for raids should vary to permit\r\n  the conduct of both daylight and night raids. Employment of\r\n  supporting arms including the delivery of smoke must be varied to\r\n  prevent indication of the objective.[773]\r\n\r\n    [773] _Lessons Learned 5-53_, p. 2.\r\n\r\nEnemy ability to locate listening posts and take them under direct\r\nfire or mortar attack also dictated the need for frequent change in\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nRegarding the use of supporting arms, the Korean terrain itself\r\ndictated a need for modification of traditional practices of employing\r\nboth direct and indirect fire weapons in order to achieve maximum\r\neffectiveness. Standard Marine Corps use of both crew-served infantry\r\nweapons and artillery centered around the concept of interlocking and\r\nmutually reinforcing bands of fire. Neither the frontage nor terrain in\r\nKorea was what could be termed “normal.” Battalion frontages were often\r\nmore than twice the accepted maximum. The terrain consisted of steep\r\nmain ridge lines with many steep finger ridges leading off both sides.\r\nSuch contours require twice as many machine guns for adequate defense\r\nagainst enemy attacks if employed in positions affording the usual\r\ninterlocking grazing fire.\r\n\r\nFor both infantry weapons on the forward COPs and MLR, and supporting\r\nartillery batteries, the combination of “stretching unit fronts\r\nand unstretchable ranges”[774] of the weapons caused them to lose\r\na considerable amount of their mutual support capability, as one\r\nartillery regimental commander commented about the experience of the\r\n1st Marine Division in Korea. As a result, a compromise was often\r\neffected whereby machine guns were emplaced on the high ground of the\r\nridge line, with their individual sectors of fire extended to 180\r\ndegrees. Although the guns were no longer mutually supporting, the\r\nnumerous finger ridges could be better covered by fire to prevent the\r\nenemy from gaining a foothold on them prior to assault on the main\r\nridge line.\r\n\r\n    [774] Col F. P. Henderson, “Amphibious Artillery of the\r\n          Future,” _Marine Corps Gazette_, v. 39, no. 12 (Dec 55),\r\n          p. 30.\r\n\r\nAs previously noted, the Marine division also modified its concept\r\nabout occupying the military crest, rather than the topographical\r\ncrest, of forward slopes.[775] In view of CCF tactics, forward slope\r\npositions offered the advantage of observation and superior fields of\r\nfire and assisted in bringing fire on the enemy in those areas and\r\napproaches masked from the view of reverse slope positions.\r\n\r\n    [775] See Chapter VI.\r\n\r\nUnder conditions of stabilized defensive lines in Korea, the great\r\noffensive power of Marine tanks was somewhat limited. They were used\r\nextensively as direct fire weapons and supplemented the artillery\r\nregiment by firing deep H&I (harassing and interdiction) missions. In\r\nWest Korea, it proved expedient to have friendly tanks positioned in\r\ndefiladed assembly areas where they were on call and ready to move\r\ninto MLR firing slots on short notice. They often provided close fire\r\nsupport to Marine patrols and outpost defense actions, sometimes being\r\ncalled in for fire missions before the direct support artillery.\r\n\r\nSince tanks under enemy observation invariably drew retaliatory fire,\r\nthey usually remained in firing positions on the MLR only long enough\r\nto complete their fire mission. Deployment of several M-46s in mutually\r\nsupporting MLR positions, however, tended to reduce the volume of\r\nhostile fire. When operating forward of the MLR, it was important that\r\nthe armored vehicles be protected by infantry from enemy tank-killer\r\nteams. Often the Marine artillery observer’s knowledge of the terrain\r\nand familiarity with objective targets upon which the tank could be\r\neffectively used was thus relayed to the tanker, particularly when such\r\ntargets were themselves obscured to the tank gunner. In registering the\r\ntarget, however, the adjustment system used by the gunner differed from\r\nthat of the artillery FOs. It was recommended that use of tank guns and\r\nlights be made part of the regular COP fire plan.\r\n\r\nThe Korean experience demonstrated in particular the need for better\r\nrehearsed tank-infantry patrols. It also showed the need for a reliable\r\ntank-mounted searchlight with a range up to 2,000 yards. Smoke and\r\nmuzzle blast of the 90mm gun often reduced the effectiveness of the\r\ntank searchlight. When two tanks were employed as a team (one spotting\r\ntargets and adjusting fire with the light, while the other zeroed in on\r\nthe illuminated targets), the searchlight was markedly more effective.\r\n\r\nOutpost warfare, which was predominantly night fighting, was thus\r\ncharacterized by patrolling and ambushes, artillery dueling, and sharp\r\nbattles for contested terrain that would offer improved observation.\r\nIn this stand-off period of positional warfare, ground defenses were\r\ndeveloped to the point where “both sides were incomparably stronger\r\nthan they had been in actual [moving] battle.”[776]\r\n\r\n    [776] Marshall, _Military History of Korean War_, p. 72.\r\n\r\nLessons from Korea dealt not only with modified battle tactics, but\r\ninvolved an evaluation of enemy performance and capabilities, as well\r\nas certain strategic considerations which had so markedly affected the\r\ncourse of the war. UNC forces in Korea faced an adversary who had vast\r\nresources of manpower and, accordingly, was wholly indifferent to the\r\ncost of victory in terms of personnel and time. In fact, the enemy\r\nbelieved that mass was the key to victory. In many instances Chinese\r\ncommanders did not launch an offensive unless their attack force had a\r\nthree-to-one superiority over the defending friendly unit.\r\n\r\nCombat effectiveness of the CCF was evaluated as good to excellent.\r\nChinese officers demonstrated good combat leadership. They were well\r\nschooled in both offensive and defensive military tactics. Some units\r\nhad been trained for amphibious operations. During the long period of\r\npositional warfare, the CCF had built up their military capability\r\n(troops, artillery, AA guns) and resupplied their forward units.\r\nMaintaining a steady flow of supplies had been an earlier weakness of\r\nthe CCF logistics system. During the last six months of the war Chinese\r\nstockpiles were adequate for 35 days of offensive operations; the enemy\r\nwas capable of supporting a major offensive for a 17–24 day period.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the North Korean soldier was considerably less effective.\r\nThe larger number of NKPA prisoners taken and their greater desertion\r\nrate indicated poorer discipline and lower morale. NKPA units were\r\nrated from poor to good. After 1951, NKPA forces decreased in\r\nimportance while the CCF assumed a greater role in the combat effort as\r\nwell as in the truce negotiations.\r\n\r\nChinese weapons and equipment were characterized by a lack of\r\nstandardization due to the absence of a central system of production or\r\nordnance supply. Their weapons included a wide assortment of foreign\r\nmanufacture--Japanese, U.S., German, Czechoslovakian, Soviet, and\r\nChinese design. Because of a shortage of small arms, usually not more\r\nthan a third of the personnel in their combat units were individually\r\narmed. Despite this fact the CCF soldier was convinced he was good and\r\nhad “proved himself to be a formidable opponent in combat.”[777]\r\n\r\n    [777] 1st MAW PIR 127-53, Encl (1), p. 1.\r\n\r\nIndividually and as units, the CCF exhibited the traditional Oriental\r\ncharacteristics of extreme patience, passivity, and determination. Some\r\nauthorities went so far as to declare that the Chinese ability to:\r\n\r\n  ... remain quiet for a long period and to patrol stealthily are\r\n  the main reasons for the success of his engagements. The enemy’s\r\n  successes which have resulted from his patience and stealth show\r\n  that our troops need more training in the same technique.[778]\r\n\r\n    [778] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, p. 9-41.\r\n\r\nThe enemy’s tenacious determination to hold key terrain, regardless of\r\nthe costs of lives, was well known. Another evaluation concluded:\r\n\r\n  The Chinese [is] well and courageously led at the small unit\r\n  level. He is thoroughly disciplined. He is an industrious digger.\r\n  His conduct of the defense is accomplished in spite of UN\r\n  superiority in the air, his inferior communications equipment and\r\n  his hodgepodge of weapons and equipment.[779]\r\n\r\n    [779] _Ibid._, No. 5, p. 8-31.\r\n\r\nBattlefront lightweightness and mobility, particularly in Korean winter\r\noperations, was another important object lesson from the enemy. Marine\r\ncold weather clothing, including thermal boot and body armor which\r\nhad saved so many lives, was of excellent design and quality. Despite\r\nthis, some authorities felt that during the Korean War the Marine was\r\n“placed at a disadvantage when he met the CCF soldier,”[780] because\r\nof bulky cold-weather clothing that hindered freedom of movement. The\r\nweight of some of the Marine infantryman’s weapons, such as the 16½ lb.\r\nBAR (plus magazines) and the 9½ lb. M-1 rifle, was felt to contribute\r\nfurther to this lack of mobility. In contrast, “the CCF soldier dressed\r\nin his quilted uniform and armed with a ‘burp’ [submachine] gun, moved\r\nfreely and quietly over the roughest of terrain, thereby gaining a not\r\ninconsiderable advantage over his heavily burdened adversary.”[781]\r\n\r\n    [780] _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, p. 9-82.\r\n\r\n    [781] _Ibid._\r\n\r\nThis superior mobility led to the related advantage of tactical\r\nsurprise. Since CCF units were unencumbered by heavy weapons they\r\ncould readily use primitive routes of approach in the darkness. Their\r\nmovements through disputed terrain were typically so furtive that often\r\nthere was no preliminary warning until the CCF were virtually within\r\ngrenade-throwing distance of friendly patrols or installations. The\r\nenemy practice of hiding by day and moving by night also concealed\r\ntheir presence from UN air reconnaissance.\r\n\r\nOne observer of the Korean scene, both in the early battles of 1950\r\nand again in 1953, has compared the CCF development of military skills\r\nduring this period, as follows:\r\n\r\n  In 1950, the Red Chinese were a crude lot, given more to\r\n  pell-mell attacks and diehard stands than to deception and\r\n  protection. But they stayed and they learned as they went along.\r\n  When they entered the war, apart from their exceptional skill and\r\n  persistence with the machine gun, they were not accurate users\r\n  of hand weapons ... by 1953, few of the old signs remained. They\r\n  had become as tenacious and as earth-seeking as ants, and in that\r\n  lay a great part of their success. Two and one-half years of war\r\n  in Korea were a bonanza for Communist China. On that training\r\n  ground her armies became as skilled as any in the world in the\r\n  techniques of hitting, evading and surviving.[782]\r\n\r\n    [782] Marshall, _Pork Chop Hill_, pp. 20–21.\r\n\r\nThe most telling characteristic of the Chinese Communist soldier, who\r\nessentially was a guerrilla fighter, may thus be his ready capacity to\r\nlearn from experience, particularly the fine art of deception.\r\n\r\nAs important as any of the lessons from the battlefield was the\r\nexperience of dealing with the Communists at the truce table.\r\nCease-fire talks dragged on interminably over a period of 2 years and\r\n17 days. Some 158 meetings were held, with more than 18 million words\r\nrecorded, most of these dealing with the prisoner exchange that had\r\nbeen the major stumbling block since early 1952. During the two years\r\nof the truce talks, from July 1951-July 1953, an additional 56,000\r\nAmericans had been killed or wounded, bringing total U.S. combat losses\r\nto more than 136,000.[783] (U.S. forces suffered some 80,000 casualties\r\nin the first year of the war.) And in the end, the final solution to\r\nthe POW problem was substantially that first proposed by the UNC in\r\nApril 1952.\r\n\r\n    [783] Marshall, _Military History of Korean War_, pp. 77, 78.\r\n\r\nCommenting on the Communist strategem that opened the truce talks\r\nin July 1951, U.S. government officials observed at the time the\r\nnegotiations began:\r\n\r\n  The suggestion was received with caution since the free people of\r\n  the world have learned that Communist words and Communist intent\r\n  seldom coincide. Regardless, our leaders initiated action for\r\n  preliminary ceasefire talks with the hope that the Communists\r\n  were acting in good faith.[784]\r\n\r\n    [784] Semianl Rpt SecNav (1 Jan-30 Jun), 1951, p. 187.\r\n\r\nDespite this early realistic appraisal of the enemy, the degree to\r\nwhich the Communists were to employ truce negotiations as simply an\r\nextension of the battlefield was not immediately evident.\r\n\r\nA key factor is involved here. The proverbial Chinese quality of\r\npassivity and seemingly endless patience, both on the individual and\r\nnational level, was fully utilized to their advantage. In contrast,\r\nthe Western people, particularly Americans, are characteristically\r\nimpatient to complete a task once it is started. As Admiral C. Turner\r\nJoy, USN, who initially headed the UNC delegation to the Korean\r\nArmistice Conference, commented, “We are a people who like to get\r\nthings _done_.... The Communist negotiating method recognizes and seeks\r\nto gain advantage by aggravating our American tendency to impatience\r\nthrough the imposition of endless delays.”[785] The American attitude\r\nis to feel that a deadlocked issue should be resolved by mutual\r\nconcessions, which puts the enemy on favorable ground in employing his\r\ndelaying tactics. The Communist view is that by deliberately slowing\r\nthe progress toward completion of the armistice the position of their\r\nopponent will gradually be undermined. Thus, Communists regard any\r\nconcession made by their opponents as a sign of weakness. Whereas\r\nWesterners often feel that to accept part of a negotiating proposal\r\nwill encourage the Communists to respond in kind, such an action is apt\r\nto lead to an even more unyielding position on their part.\r\n\r\n    [785] Joy, _Truce Negotiations_, p. 39.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe armistice effort in Korea also taught the following lessons:\r\n\r\n  Never weaken your pressure when the enemy sues for [an]\r\n  armistice. Increase it.\r\n\r\n  Armistice conferences should be brief ... to allow ... talks to\r\n  become protracted is to indicate weakness on your part. This\r\n  encourages your Communist opponents.\r\n\r\n  The site at which armistice talks are held should be outside the\r\n  area of conflict.\r\n\r\n  Never concede anything to the Communists for nothing, merely to\r\n  make progress.[786]\r\n\r\n    [786] _Ibid._, pp. 166–173, _passim_.\r\n\r\nPossibly no one had more first-hand experience in negotiating with the\r\nenemy in the Korean War than Colonel James C. Murray, the Marine Corps\r\nstaff officer who was involved in the truce talks from 8 July 1951 to\r\n27 July 1953. In these two years he served as liaison officer between\r\nthe delegations of the two sides and participated actively in meetings.\r\nOn three different occasions he negotiated the truce line which was\r\nto separate UNC and Communist forces. In July 1953, as Senior Liaison\r\nOfficer, he was in charge of the UNC staff group that determined the\r\nfinal line of demarcation. He has noted that Communist rationalizations\r\nreadily disregard whatever facts or logic which do not fit their\r\npurpose, no matter how inconsistent.\r\n\r\nWhile customarily ignoring all restrictions of the Geneva Convention\r\nin dealing with prisoners, for example, when it was expedient to their\r\ninterests the Communists would then argue for an incredibly narrow\r\ninterpretation of the Convention’s provisions. Declared Colonel Murray:\r\n“Having come to the conference table only because they were near\r\ndefeat, the Communists were prepared from the very first to make the\r\nmost of the negotiations to create ... a ‘climate of victory’.”[787]\r\nThis accounts for their concern with even the smallest detail of “stage\r\nsetting,” for maintaining “face,” and for practical advantages from\r\nnegotiating conditions, such as the physical setting of the truce talk\r\nsite.\r\n\r\n    [787] Col J. C. Murray, “Prisoner Issue in the Korean Armistice\r\n          Negotiations,” _Marine Corps Gazette_, v. 39, no. 9 (Sep\r\n          55), p. 30.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the Marine officer further observed:\r\n\r\n  A fundamental objective of the Communists in respect to the\r\n  truce was the appearance of the Communist victory in Korea....\r\n  An armistice, no less than war, could be looked upon only as\r\n  a means to an end ... to this end they negotiate patiently and\r\n  skillfully ... temporary inconveniences must be borne for ... the\r\n  attainment of long-range political objectives.[788]\r\n\r\n    [788] _Ibid._, p. 29.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the close interaction between Communist military operations\r\nand truce negotiations, a key factor since 1951, was particularly\r\napparent during April-July 1953 as the war drew to an end.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Communist China which had emerged stronger and with\r\nconsiderably more prestige from the war, the other Asian nation to\r\nhave undergone marked military growth was the Republic of Korea. In\r\nJune 1950, the ROK army had numbered approximately 98,000 inadequately\r\ntrained troops, armed chiefly with hand-carried weapons such as rifles\r\nand carbines, ill-prepared to hold back a determined enemy attack. The\r\nROK army was little more than a constabulary force organized by KMAG\r\n(Korean Military Advisory Group) for internal police duty. Only 65,000\r\nmen had actually received unit combat training. ROK armed forces during\r\nthe three years of the war had increased six-fold and by July 1953\r\ntotaled nearly 600,000 men.\r\n\r\nTraining and equipment had steadily improved the ROK battle efficiency\r\nwhich, in the 1950–1951 period, had been handicapped by lack of heavy\r\ntanks, mortars, artillery, antitank mines and shells, and other heavy\r\nweapons. By the spring of 1951 the ROK army was being transformed\r\ninto an effective fighting force, due largely to the determination of\r\nGeneral Van Fleet, then EUSAK commander. In 1952 the ROK army had been\r\nenlarged to 12 divisions and the ROK Marine forces had been similarly\r\nexpanded. Gradual augmentation resulted in a total of 16 ROK divisions,\r\nmost of these with organic artillery; by July 1953 ROK troops had\r\nassumed responsibility for the majority of the UN line.\r\n\r\nMarine Corps experience with its ROK counterpart had been instructive\r\nand generally encouraging.[789] Organized in 1949 by the Republic of\r\nKorea with assistance from KMAG, the 1st Korean Marine Corps Regiment\r\nhad taken part in antiguerrilla operations until the NKPA invasion.\r\nWith the outbreak of hostilities, the KMCs engaged in UN delaying\r\nactions in southwest Korea until September 1950 when the Korean\r\nregiment of nearly 3,000 men was attached to the 5th Marines as part of\r\nthe Inchon assault force. Later the KMCs were involved in defense of\r\nWonsan and the Hamhung-Hungnam beachhead as well as the Pohang patrol.\r\nAfter serving as a maneuver element with the ROK forces in early\r\n1951, the 1st KMC Regiment was attached permanently to the 1st Marine\r\nDivision in March of that year, participating in the Hwachon Reservoir\r\nfighting and performing valuable service in the interrogation of POWs.\r\n\r\n    [789] See “1stMarDiv, 1st KMC Regt. and Its Relationship to the\r\n          1stMarDiv,” “SAR” File (Korea), Type “C” Rpt.\r\n\r\nThe KMCs modeled themselves after U.S. Marines, particularly emulating\r\nthe traditional offensive Marine _esprit de corps_ and overriding goal\r\nto “close with the enemy and seize the objective” regardless of strong\r\nresistance. The combat courage and determination of the KMCs was cited\r\nby CG, 1st Marine Division, on several occasions.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1952–1953 period, the KMC/RCT provided the Marine division\r\nwith nearly a quarter of its combat strength and became the fourth\r\nregiment of the division. The ROK Marine Corps also consisted of the\r\n2d KMC Regiment, which furnished personnel for the WCIDU/ECIDU island\r\nsecurity forces, and the 5th KMC Battalion, attached to the Marine\r\ndivision in 1952. Classes in infantry tactics for KMC officer and\r\nenlisted personnel were conducted at the Korean Marine Corps Training\r\nCenter at Chinhae. This was patterned after U.S. Marine Corps recruit\r\nand officers’ basic schools, under supervision of USMC staff personnel.\r\nCoupled with an offensive spirit and desire to attain U.S. Marine Corps\r\nstandards and combat performance, the Korean Marines largely overcame\r\nearly major problems resulting from the language barrier, translation\r\nof U.S. basic training materials, and the insufficient number of\r\nqualified and experienced Korean military instructors. One early\r\nrecruit class possibly established a record for brevity in training\r\nwhen its members, after only a few weeks, were ordered to participate\r\nin the Inchon assault which was the Korean Marines’ first specialized\r\namphibious operation.\r\n\r\nMany of the hard lessons of Korea--as well as some of its unique\r\nproblems--resulted from the fact that this was America’s first major\r\nexperience in a modern, undeclared, and limited war. Accustomed to the\r\ntradition of hard-hitting, all-out war and decisive victory, both the\r\nfighting man at the front and Nation tended to view the conflict as\r\nwell as its ultimate accomplishments as inconclusive.[790]\r\n\r\n    [790] The course of the war, particularly its protracted and\r\n          static nature, had led to growing national apathy and\r\n          opposition, particularly on the U.S. home front. In late\r\n          1950, national opinion polls found that 80 percent of the\r\n          people were in favor of the war and seven months later\r\n          that 67 percent were against it. On the Korean front\r\n          lines, morale was generally highest during heavy ground\r\n          actions or large scale air attacks. _Washington Post_,\r\n          dtd 12 Jul 70, p. A-17; _PacFlt EvalRpt_ No. 6, p. 1-16.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, immediate collective security action by the UNC had\r\nprevented another small country from being subdued by direct, armed\r\naggression. And the Communists had failed to attain their objective:\r\nthe forced unification of Korea, not as a free nation but as a Russian\r\nsatellite, as was North Korea. The balance sheet for UNC military\r\nintervention showed that 22 nations (including the ROK) had provided\r\nassistance, either personnel or materiel in defense of South Korea.\r\nMany of these countries had supplied token units of battalion-size or\r\nless and several had furnished noncombat medical facilities. Despite\r\nthe fact these detachments from other Allied countries totalled “only\r\n44,000 men they were disproportionately valuable in emphasizing the\r\ncollective, coalition nature of the Korean war effort.”[791] Major\r\nlosses, however, had been borne by ROK and American troops.\r\n\r\n    [791] Rees, _Korea_, p. 33.\r\n\r\nUNC casualties numbered 996,937 killed, wounded, and missing. U.S.\r\nlosses were 136,937, of which 33,629 represented battle deaths and\r\n103,308 wounded in action. A measure of the role that ground forces\r\nplayed in Korea “may be judged from the fact that, of the total United\r\nStates battle casualties for the entire conflict, the Army and Marines\r\naccounted for 97 percent.”[792] Casualties of other UNC countries,\r\nexclusive of the U.S. and ROK, totaled approximately 17,000 although\r\nno other Allied nation lost as many as 1,000 dead. ROK casualties were\r\nlisted at 850,000. Communist losses were estimated at 1,420,000 (CCF:\r\n900,000 killed and wounded; NKPA: 520,000 killed and wounded).\r\n\r\n    [792] Ridgway, _Korean War_, p. viii.\r\n\r\nFor the Republic of South Korea, the end of the war in some respects\r\nrepresented a _status quo ante bellum_. Korea still remained\r\npolitically partitioned and geographically divided. Whereas the 38th\r\nParallel had been the territorial boundary prior to the Communist\r\nattack of 25 June 1950, the cease-fire line dividing North and South\r\nKorea in 1953 was the point of contact between ground forces at\r\nthe time the armistice was signed. This demarcation line, however,\r\n“represented a stronger defense than the 38th Parallel as it possessed\r\na geographical basis all along its approximately 155-mile length.”[793]\r\nThe new boundary ran above the KANSAS Line, the commanding ground north\r\nof the 38th Parallel.\r\n\r\n    [793] Rees, _Korea_, p. 431. In the three years of war, North\r\n          Korea had gained 850 square miles of territory southwest\r\n          of the Parallel, while the ROK acquired 2,350 square\r\n          miles north of the original June 1950 boundary.\r\n\r\nPossibly the single, most important lesson to be drawn from the Korean\r\nWar is that many of our nation’s military assumptions--and resulting\r\ntactical decisions--tended to be based on a lack of appreciation\r\nof enemy capabilities. In many instances intelligence evaluations\r\nfocused on “probable intentions of the enemy rather than on his\r\ncapabilities.”[794]\r\n\r\n    [794] Collins, _War in Peacetime_, p. 175.\r\n\r\nWhile America put great military value and reliance on its massive\r\ndestructive air power, for example, we were confronted by an enemy\r\nwho practically never employed his own air capability, but instead\r\nmoved freely at night and hid by day and was thus little deterred by\r\nour aerial harassment. And while our own battle summaries regularly\r\ncited kill ratios of 1 USMC to 3.75 CCF and substantial Communist\r\nlosses,[795] we seemed to ignore an enemy mind that thought in terms\r\nof numerical superiority and was little concerned about the high human\r\ncost of holding key terrain or annexing a desired position. In the\r\nlast month of the war alone, Eighth Army estimated that CCF casualties\r\nnumbered 72,000, with more than 25,000 killed.\r\n\r\n    [795] Official records show that the 1stMarDiv inflicted\r\n          approximately 59,805 CCF casualties (11,957 KIA; 15,111\r\n          estimated WIA or KIA; 32,643 estimated WIA; and 94 POWs)\r\n          during the Apr 52-Jul 53 period on the western front.\r\n          For the same time, Marine infantry casualties were\r\n          approximately 13,000 plus some 2,500 for its 1st KMC/RCT.\r\n\r\nIn both battlefield tactics and high-level strategy, the Korean\r\nWar revealed a strong tendency on the part of the UNC to predict\r\nenemy action by values and ideology largely reflecting our own.\r\nWhether because of wishful thinking, basic mistakes in judgment,\r\nor international _naiveté_, the 1950–1953 experience repeatedly\r\nindicated a need on the part of Allied nations for considerably more\r\nhard-headed realism in dealing with a Communist adversary. The original\r\nUNC military objective of halting Communist aggression in Korea had\r\nbeen successfully accomplished, without enlarging the conflict into\r\na nuclear war. At the same time, Korea had also provided a sobering\r\nlesson. It demonstrated how, in a limited war, overriding political\r\nconsiderations may permit the enemy to operate from a privileged\r\nsanctuary and allow him to seize and, in many respects, retain the\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\nThe Korean War had made America more aware of the threat of world\r\nCommunism and had resulted in the strengthening of our national defense\r\ncommitments in the Far East as well as in Europe. It had also validated\r\nthe concept of a balanced defense force. In contrast to the emphasis\r\non air capability and atomic power that had dominated the strategic\r\nthinking in the post-World War II era, the Korean hostilities pointed\r\nto the requirement for a balanced, diversified military force of\r\nsufficient strength and readiness to cope effectively and on short\r\nnotice with any emergency. Korea had underscored how severe peacetime\r\nbudgetary cut-backs had led to unpreparedness. The Korean experience\r\nhad also shown the need for flexibility in mobilization planning.\r\nPreviously, this had been projected for an all-out, general war, based\r\non America’s role in World War II. The Nation’s post-Korean policy thus\r\nsought, for the first time, a military strategy that would effectively\r\ndeter either a major war or local aggression.\r\n\r\nKorean hostilities illustrated another important lesson. South\r\nKorea had been attacked by an act of direct aggression, in flagrant\r\nviolation of the Cairo Declaration and U.N. Charter. It was apparent\r\nthat, despite the defense treaties and mutual aid pacts which the\r\nUnited States had signed during and after World War II, “any number\r\nof alliances, if not supported by strong military preparedness, would\r\nnever restrain aggression.”[796] It had taken the Korean War to drive\r\nhome the harsh reality that military preparedness, possession of\r\nsuperior power, and _the willingness to use that power_ were the only\r\ndeterrent to enemy aggression throughout the world.\r\n\r\n    [796] Marshall, _Military History of Korean War_, p. 2.\r\n\r\nThe Korean War also caused the Communists to modify their strategy\r\nfrom one of overt aggression to more insidious means of gaining their\r\npolitical and economic objectives. As the Marine Corps Commandant,\r\nGeneral Shepherd, warned: “Their tactic is to use war by proxy, war by\r\nsatellite, war by threat and subversion.”[797] And, although it was not\r\nfully apparent at the time, the Korean attack “was to prove to be one\r\nof the first in a series of ‘wars of liberation’”[798] that the world\r\nwould be witness to.\r\n\r\n    [797] Anl Rpt of the CMC to SecNav, FY 1955, p. 3.\r\n\r\n    [798] Collins, _War in Peacetime_, pp. 3–4.\r\n\r\nIn the final analysis, the Korean War evolved into a prolonged battle\r\nof position and attrition in which the Communists, operating close to\r\ntheir base of supply, were fought to a standstill by United Nations\r\nforces under unfavorable conditions of climate and logistics. In\r\ncountering the enemy threat in Korea, the American units committed\r\nthere initially suffered from the effects of peacetime apathy that had\r\nfollowed the rapid demobilization following World War II. As the Korean\r\nWar, originally visualized as a “police action” of brief duration,\r\nground on into a major effort spanning a period of three years and\r\none month, loud voices were raised on the home front to protest the\r\nexpenditure of lives and materiel in a venture that was not always\r\nclearly understood by all Americans.\r\n\r\nAmong the U.S. forces committed on this far flung battlefront, it\r\nwas once again the Marine Corps component that stood out in its\r\nsacrifice, military skills, and devotion to duty. When rushed into\r\nthe battle during the first desperate weeks and months of the war,\r\nthe quickly-augmented Marine units helped to restore stability to the\r\nshattered EUSAK front line. During the daringly conceived and executed\r\noperation at Inchon, Marines accomplished this incredibly complex\r\namphibious operation with their customary spirit and precision. Never\r\nwas their courage and tenacity more conspicuous than during those\r\nbitter days of the Chosin Reservoir campaign following the Chinese\r\nCommunist intervention.\r\n\r\nIn the static, or positional, warfare that marked the final operations\r\nin Korea, the 1st Marine Division and 1st Marine Aircraft Wing\r\nexecuted their respective missions with professional skill and\r\ndispatch, regardless of tactical problems and the dreary monotony that\r\ncharacterized a large part of the Korean War. U.S. Marines had seen\r\ncombat throughout much of the Korean peninsula. The fighting had taken\r\nthem from Pusan to Inchon and Seoul, to the Chosin, to Inje and the\r\nHwachon Reservoir in the Punchbowl area, and finally, in 1952–1953, to\r\nthe critical 35-mile front in West Korea near Panmunjom. In Korea, as\r\nin past wars, Marines demonstrated the versatility, aggressiveness, and\r\nreadiness which has always been a tradition of the Corps.\r\n\r\nMarine courage and combat performance went far toward removing the\r\nimage of Western softness and decadence which the Communists had so\r\nmistakenly construed in their own minds. It is a record of which all\r\nAmericans and the Free World can be proud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nGlossary of Technical Terms and Abbreviations\r\n\r\n\r\n  AAA--Antiaircraft

The heroic and courageous fighting of the\r\nFirst United States Marine Division (Reinforced), which was outnumbered\r\nbut never outfought by the Chinese Communist Forces; coupled with its\r\nfight against the terrible winter weather in this return to Hungnam,\r\nhas added another glorious page to the brilliant history of the United\r\nStates Marines. After regrouping and retraining, the First United\r\nStates Marine Division (Reinforced) rejoined the United Nations\r\nForces and began the attack to the north which drove the aggressors\r\nrelentlessly before them. The enemy spring offensive during April\r\n1951 which threatened to nullify the recent United Nations gains was\r\nsuccessfully repulsed by the First Marine Division (Reinforced) and\r\nwhen other Republic of Korea Forces were heavily pressed and fighting\r\nfor survival the timely offensive by this Division gave heart to the\r\npeoples of Korea. In March 1952 the First Marine Division (Reinforced)\r\nassumed responsibility of defending the western flank of the Eighth\r\nArmy. In carrying out the responsibilities of this assignment the\r\nMarines won everlasting glory at Bunker Hill. Continuing active\r\noperations against the Communist enemy until the Armistice, the First\r\nMarine Division (Reinforced) inflicted heavy losses upon the aggressors\r\nand successfully repulsed their assaults upon strong point Vegas and\r\nReno during March 1953, and during July 1953, just prior to the signing\r\nof the Armistice, again threw back the enemy in several days of severe\r\nfighting at strong points Berlin and East Berlin. Although suffering\r\nheavy losses during these engagements the First Marine Division\r\n(Reinforced) was at all times successful in maintaining the integrity\r\nof the United Nations’ positions within their assigned sector. The\r\nFirst United States Marine Division (Reinforced), by its unparalleled\r\nfighting courage and steadfast devotion to duty, has won the undying\r\naffection and gratitude of the Korean people. During its entire\r\ncampaign the First United States Marine Division (Reinforced) remained\r\ntrue to its motto of “Semper Fidelis”. In keeping faith with the\r\nhighest traditions of its own country the First United States Marine\r\nDivision (Reinforced) kindled new hope in the breasts of all free men\r\nand women in the Republic of Korea.

During these periods the First Marine\r\nDivision, Reinforced, maintained the integrity of over thirty-five\r\nmiles of defense line in Panmunjom Truce Area against the constant\r\naggressions of the enemy. During the time the Division was in the\r\nlines, it was under fire and attack by a resolute, well-equipped and\r\nfanatical hostile force. The Division maintained an raiding defense\r\nand constantly kept the enemy off balance by continuously patrolling,\r\nprobing and raiding enemy positions, accompanied by the full weight of\r\nartillery and air support. Commencing in August 1952, and frequently\r\nthereafter, during the months of October 1952, March 1953, and July\r\n1953, the enemy launched a series of large scale attacks to capture\r\ncertain terrain features critical to the defense of friendly lines.\r\nThe outposts and main defensive positions called Bunker Hill, The\r\nHook, Reno, Carson, Vegas, Berlin and East Berlin, along with certain\r\nsmaller outposts, gave title to battles of unsurpassed ferocity in\r\nwhich the full effort of the Marine Division was required to hurl\r\nback the attackers at heavy cost to both the Division and the enemy.\r\nThat the lines in the Division sector remained firm and unbreached at\r\nthe cessation of hostilities on 27 July 1953 gave eloquent tribute to\r\nthe resourcefulness, courage, professional acumen and stamina of the\r\nmembers of the First Marine Division, Reinforced.

The citation reads as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The Third Turkish Brigade, Turkish Armed Forces Command, and the\r\nfollowing attached units: The Turkish Liaison Detachment, 8215th Army\r\nUnit; Company B, 1st Marine Tank Battalion, 1st Marine Division; and\r\nCompany C, 1st Marine Tank Battalion, 1st Marine Division, are cited\r\nfor outstanding performance of duty and extraordinary heroism in action\r\nagainst the enemy near Munsan-ni, Korea, during the period 28 to 29\r\nMay 1953. On the night of 28 May, an assault, supported by a heavy\r\nbarrage, was launched by a powerful enemy force, determined to wrest\r\noutposts “Elko,” “Carson,” and “Vegas” from friendly hands. The valiant\r\ntroops occupying these positions were soon surrounded and hand-to-hand\r\ncombat ensued. With great tenacity and courage, the friendly troops\r\nfought on until, with only three of them still standing on outpost\r\n“Carson,” the first position fell. Despite the tremendous number of\r\ncasualties they had suffered, the foe intensified the attack on the two\r\nremaining terrain features, rushing repeatedly up the slopes only to be\r\nhurled back by the gallant defenders. Friendly reinforcements arrived\r\ntogether with concentrated artillery support. All fire power was\r\nbrought to bear on the charging enemy, as the defending troops fought\r\ndesperately to hold. The foe came on in seemingly endless numbers and\r\nfriendly tanks moved into highly vulnerable positions to fire at close\r\nrange. Friendly casualties were heavy, but the toll of enemy dead was\r\nenormous. The determined foe paid apparently no attention to their\r\nthousands of casualties and appeared prepared to sacrifice thousands\r\nmore to gain their objectives. Realizing that these friendly outposts\r\ncould not hope to stand in the face of the endless waves of hostile\r\ntroops, the friendly command ordered the outpost defenders to withdraw\r\nto the main line of resistance. The extraordinary heroism, singleness\r\nof purpose, and magnificent fighting spirit exhibited by the members of\r\nthe Third Turkish Brigade, Turkish Armed Forces Command, and attached\r\nunits throughout this crucial battle, resulted in the frustration of\r\nenemy plans to breach the main line of resistance, thus reflecting the\r\ngreatest credit on themselves and the military profession.\r\n\r\nBy order of the Secretary of the Army:\r\n\r\n  OFFICIAL:\r\n    WM.

Rotation personnel shall be introduced into and evacuated from\r\nKorea only through the ports of entry enumerated in Paragraph 43\r\nhereof. Rotation shall be conducted on a man-for-man basis; provided,\r\nhowever, that no more than thirty-five thousand (35,000) persons in\r\nthe military service shall be admitted into Korea by either side in\r\nany calendar month under the rotation policy. No military personnel\r\nof either side shall be introduced into Korea if the introduction of\r\nsuch personnel will cause the aggregate of the military personnel\r\nof that side admitted into Korea since the effective date of this\r\nArmistice Agreement to exceed the cumulative total of the military\r\npersonnel of that side who have departed from Korea since that date.\r\nReports concerning arrivals in and departures from Korea of military\r\npersonnel shall be made daily to the Military Armistice Commission and\r\nthe Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, such reports shall include\r\nplaces of arrival and departure and the number of persons arriving at\r\nor departing from each such place.

Such combat aircraft, armored\r\nvehicles, weapons, and ammunition shall be introduced into Korea only\r\nthrough the ports of entry enumerated in Paragraph 43 hereof.

In versions of this eBook that support\r\nhyperlinks, the page references in the List of Illustrations lead to\r\nthe corresponding illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe index was not systematically checked for proper alphabetization or\r\ncorrect page references; some minor errors or omissions were silently\r\ncorrected.\r\n\r\nPage 62: Two lines of text near the top of the page were in the wrong\r\norder and have been swapped back to the correct order.\r\n\r\nPhoto sections: Some of the photo credit numbers may be incomplete, as\r\nthe right-hand sides of some pages were clipped in all available images\r\nof the pages of the original publication.\r\n\r\nPage 579: “Presidental” was printed that way, and retained here as it\r\nmay have been printed that way in the original Citation.",
