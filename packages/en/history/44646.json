Molé to a seat in the French Academy. He is supported\r\nalike by M. Royer-Collard and by the Ministers; hence M. de Villemain\r\nfound occasion to say, yesterday evening, that all the most _diverse_\r\nand _inverse_ influences were in combination to _transport_ or to\r\n_export_ M. Molé to the Academy, and that he himself was strongly in\r\nfavour of _importation_, as a seat in the Academy was no obstacle to\r\nother posts. This play on words was no less pointed than malicious.\r\n\r\nThere was much talk of the various speeches delivered before the King\r\non New Year's Day, and in particular of M. Pasquier's speech, which\r\nwas remarkable for the boldness he displayed in his use of the word\r\n\"subject,\" which M. de Villemain called a _progressive_ term.\r\n\r\nThe King was delighted with Count Apponyi's speech, and the Diplomatic\r\nService were equally pleased with the King's reply. In any case,\r\nFieschi and Mascara[1] were so much treasure-trove to all the\r\nspeech-makers; emotion and sympathy in every degree were noticeable,\r\nand M. Dupin was moved even to sobs!\r\n\r\n  [1] Mascara, in Algiers, was captured by the French in 1835.\r\n\r\nConcerning M. Pasquier, a notice was inserted by some jester in a\r\nlow-class newspaper to the effect that his recent illness was caused\r\nby his recognition of Fieschi as his natural son! The old Comtesse de\r\nla Briche, who is falling into her dotage, went off in all seriousness\r\nto relate this piece of folly with sighs of profound emotion in the\r\n_salon_ of Madame de Chastellux, the Carlist headquarters. Such want\r\nof tact is almost inconceivable, and great merriment was aroused!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 4, 1836._--The illness of Madame de Flahaut's second\r\ndaughter has become critical, and provided me yesterday with an\r\nillustration of that truest of parables, the beam and the mote, when\r\nMadame de Lieven said to me, in reference to Madame de Flahaut: \"Can\r\nyou conceive that she talks politics to me at a time like this and\r\norders her carriage to visit Madame Adélaïde? She will even leave her\r\ndaughter's room to discuss public affairs with her visitors, and asks\r\nme to dinner to-morrow to distract her thoughts, as she says, and not\r\nto be left alone in her anxiety!\" Apparently people cannot see\r\nthemselves as others see them, and such incidents give one startling\r\ncause for introspection.\r\n\r\nThe much-discussed communication from President Jackson,[2] which has\r\nbeen expected with great impatience, has reached the Duc de Broglie,\r\nby way of England. He went to the King five hours later, to inform him\r\nthat the communication had arrived; when the King asked to see it the\r\nDuc de Broglie told him that it was of no importance and that he had\r\nalready sent it to the newspapers! He made the same observation to his\r\ncolleague, M. de Thiers, who told every one he met during the evening,\r\non the faith of this information, that the message was of no political\r\nsignificance. The next day the King and M. Thiers were able to read\r\nthe message in the papers, and found that it was very cleverly\r\nconceived, very insolent to M. de Broglie personally, and exactly\r\ncalculated to terminate the existing dispute. Council after council\r\nwas then held, and lively discussions took place; at length the royal\r\nwill has triumphed, with the support of M. Thiers, and the\r\ncommunication will be declared satisfactory. The intervention of\r\nEngland is to be declined, and a statement will be made that France is\r\nprepared to pay the sum of twenty-five millions as due under the terms\r\nspecified. M. de Broglie eventually yielded, though his surrender was\r\ndelayed by the wound to his self-esteem. At first he refused to submit\r\nfor approval his note thanking England for her offer of intervention,\r\nbut it was eventually shown to the King yesterday. It was criticised\r\nas being too long, too diffuse, and too metaphysical. There was a\r\nvigorous discussion in the council, but the King concluded the matter\r\nby giving his hand to the Duc de Broglie with a kind word. At the same\r\ntime a considerable amount of ill-temper remains on both sides.\r\nHowever, a war with the United States would be very disadvantageous to\r\nFrench commerce; so this conclusion will probably have a good effect\r\nupon public opinion.\r\n\r\n  [2] _See_ Appendix. In 1834 Jackson had claimed an indemnity of\r\n  twenty-five millions, in very haughty terms, from the Government\r\n  of Louis Philippe as compensation to the United States for the\r\n  loss of ships seized under the Empire; in the event of refusal,\r\n  confiscation was threatened of all French estates within the\r\n  territories of the Union. While the claim was entirely\r\n  legitimate, the insulting form in which it was presented delayed\r\n  a settlement, until President Jackson retracted his words in the\r\n  communication to which reference is here made.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 11, 1836._--Yesterday morning I had a call from M.\r\nRoyer-Collard. He had just left M. de Berryer in a state of\r\nconsiderable vexation and disgust; their conversation had dealt with\r\nPrague. M. de Berryer said that at Prague M. Royer was in many men's\r\nminds and was well spoken of; that Charles X. had several times\r\nrepeated his fear that he had not sufficiently considered several\r\nthings which M. Royer had told him in a long conversation at the time\r\nof the much-discussed address[3] of 1830. The curious point is that\r\nwhen the old king attempted to recall these important points, of which\r\nhe had but a vague recollection, he found himself unable to remember\r\nthem. The incident is very characteristic of the man's good intentions\r\nand incompetency.\r\n\r\n  [3] The Address of the 221 (March 3, 1830). This was a reply to a\r\n  speech from the throne, and plainly expressed the displeasure of\r\n  the 221 Deputies at seeing M. de Martignac deposed from the\r\n  Presidency in favour of the Prince Jules de Polignac.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 16, 1836._--M. Humann, Financial Minister, delivered a\r\ntirade yesterday in the Chamber of Deputies, in which he very\r\nimprudently raised the question of the reduction of the State bonds,\r\nwithout previously consulting his colleagues. It was thought that a\r\ndissolution of the Ministry would be the consequence, but the\r\ndifficulty has been settled, and matters remain as they were, for the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThe King has personally seen Count Pahlen and soothed his feelings,\r\nand it is hoped that the speech of the Duc de Broglie in the Chamber\r\nof Deputies will not lead to any outburst.[4]\r\n\r\n  [4] The speech to which reference is made will be found in the\r\n  Appendix to this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 24, 1836._--The Chamber of Deputies remains disturbed\r\nand restive. Apathetic as the session was at its opening, it provides\r\nvexation enough to those responsible for the government. The\r\nprevailing ill-temper is especially manifested against the Duc de\r\nBroglie, the tone of whose speeches displeases the Deputies. His\r\nobservation in the Chamber the other day, \"is that clear?\" is regarded\r\nas almost unpardonable.[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] M. Humann submitted to the Chamber as a necessary measure a\r\n  scheme for the conversion of Government 5 per cent. bonds, which\r\n  had already been attempted in vain by M. de Villèle in 1824. The\r\n  Chamber was inclined to receive the idea favourably, but the\r\n  Cabinet showed some ill-temper as it had not been previously\r\n  consulted, and M. Humann resigned. A question was asked in the\r\n  Chamber on this subject on June 18, and discussion was opened by\r\n  the Duc de Broglie. \"We are asking,\" he said, \"whether the\r\n  Government intends to propose the measure in the course of this\r\n  session. I answer, No; is that clear?\" This last remark excited\r\n  general disfavour, and was the subject of adverse comment\r\n  forthwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 28, 1836._--Yesterday we were dining with Marshal\r\nMaison. It was a remarkable dinner for many reasons, but especially\r\nfor the stories told by the Marshal's wife, one of which amused me for\r\na long time afterwards. They were speaking of crowded balls and saying\r\nhow difficult it was to discover the exact number of guests actually\r\npresent; thereupon the Marshal's wife observed in her high, shrill\r\nvoice: \"I have an admirable method which has always worked\r\nsuccessfully in all the balls I have given; I put my chambermaid\r\nbehind the door with a bag of beans at her side, and I say: 'Mariette,\r\nwhen any one comes in, you will take a bean out of the big bag and put\r\nit in your handbag.' Thus the numbers are exactly known, and that is\r\nthe best way of doing it.\" So strong an inclination to wild laughter\r\novercame me that I nearly choked, and Mmes. de Lieven, von Werther,\r\nand von Löwenhielm, who were present, were in the same predicament.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 1, 1836._--If I were at my dear Rochecotte, as I was\r\nlast year, I should think that spring was beginning on February 1,\r\nwhereas here one can say nothing of the kind. My old dislike of Paris\r\nhas been growing upon me for some time. Not that people are in any way\r\ndisagreeable--indeed, the contrary is the case; but life at Paris is\r\ntoo exhausting, the atmosphere is too keen, attractions are too\r\nnumerous and widely spread, while at the same time they are not\r\nsufficiently strong. There is no leisure, constant worry, and a\r\ncontinual sense of want.\r\n\r\nAt London I lived amid a society at once high and simple-minded;\r\nsocial success and leisure were possible at the same time. M. de\r\nTalleyrand there enjoyed good health and was occupied with important\r\nbusiness. The excitement which I then experienced had its\r\ncompensations; I had time for my own occupations, for reading,\r\nworking, writing, and thinking, nor was I pestered by every idle\r\nperson. If calling is a tax upon one's time, calls can be paid at\r\nLondon with an empty carriage and with cards; in short, life was then\r\na pleasure. Hence my deep and melancholy regret for those years which\r\nwill never return; hence my longing for the calm and sweetness of\r\nRochecotte, with its wide horizon and its pure sky, for my clean\r\nhouse, my kind and simple neighbours, my workpeople, my flowers, my\r\nbig dog, my little cow and goat, the good Abbé, the modest Vestier,\r\nthe little wood where we used to gather fir-cones--the place, in\r\nshort, where I am at my best, because I have time for valuable\r\nintrospection, for enlightenment of thought, for the practice of good\r\nand the avoidance of evil, time to unite myself in simplicity of heart\r\nand mind with the beauty, the strength, and the graciousness of\r\nnature, which there gives me shelter, refreshment, and repose. But a\r\ntruce to these self-complainings, which are useless and ungrateful.\r\n\r\nYesterday I saw Dr. Ferrus, on his return from Ham. His account of\r\nwhat he found there is as follows: Both the orders and the attitude\r\nof the doctors were extremely kind, but it was necessary to find some\r\nexcuse for action, and the two ex-Ministers who were really ill, MM.\r\nde Chantelauze and de Peyronnet, insolently refused to permit a visit\r\nfrom the doctors; while the others, MM. de Polignac and Guernon de\r\nRanville, though very compliant, submissive, and anxious to take\r\nadvantage of the kindly attitude of the Government, were unfortunately\r\nunable to plead any malady. Hence it was necessary to postpone the\r\ndesired attempt to improve their condition.[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] This is again a reference to the former Ministers of Charles\r\n  X. Certain people were energetically striving to secure the\r\n  liberation of these unfortunate political prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 6, 1836._--Yesterday morning I went to the session of\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies, with the Countess Bretzenheim, who had\r\ninvited me to accompany her; there I heard for the first time a speech\r\nby M. Thiers; he spoke admirably, in opposition to the much-discussed\r\nproposal for the conversion of the stock, so imprudently put forward\r\nby M. Humann. While M. Thiers was speaking I thought I noticed him\r\nspitting blood several times; I wrote to ask him how he was, and the\r\nfollowing is an extract from his reply: \"I am exhausted; I did not\r\nspit blood, but in those few moments I shortened my life by several\r\ndays; I have never encountered so strong an opposition of opinion, and\r\nan iron will is required to overcome an obstinacy so plain as that\r\ndisplayed by the Chamber. I am very sorry that you should have heard\r\nme speak, as the figures must have wearied you, and have given you a\r\npoor idea of our public oratory. We should be heard and judged only\r\nupon days of excitement, and not when we are discussing accounts. In\r\nany case, I am doubtful of the consequences, and were it not for the\r\nKing I should be inclined to wish that the Ministry would resign. The\r\nstruggle against such imprudence and foolishness is an unbearable\r\ntask.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter prepared me to some extent for the events of the evening.\r\nHowever, M. Royer-Collard, who came to me in the course of the\r\nmorning, believed that the Ministry would emerge triumphant, for the\r\nreason that the Chamber would find difficulty in using an advantage,\r\nif they gained one. He was overcome with admiration for the speech of\r\nM. Thiers, and had told him as much in the Chamber. On this occasion\r\nthey spoke to one another again, for the first time since the\r\ndiscussion of the September laws.\r\n\r\nMy son, M. de Valençay, came directly from the session of the Chamber\r\nof Deputies to dinner with us. He told us of the stupefaction produced\r\nin the Chamber by the strange conclusions of Humann, and the\r\nexcitement of the Ministers because the project for converting the\r\nGovernment stock had been postponed by a majority of two votes only.\r\n\r\nThe _Journal de Paris_ announced the resignation of the Ministry at a\r\nlater hour, and General Alava, who had just seen the Duc de Broglie,\r\ntold us at eleven o'clock in the evening that the King had accepted\r\ntheir resignations, and had sent for MM. Humann and Molé.\r\n\r\nAt that moment I received the following note from M. Thiers: \"We have\r\nresigned in full freedom and seriousness. The King knew beforehand,\r\nand agreed with every one, and myself in particular, that this result\r\nwas the inevitable consequence of our intention to oppose the scheme\r\nfor conversion. Our honour would be compromised if we did not persist\r\nin our action and force a new Ministry to take office. It matters not\r\nif that Ministry be weak and helpless; the burden of proving the fact\r\nwill rest upon the Third Party. No other action is possible, either\r\nfor the King or for ourselves, and would in any case be a deception in\r\nthe style of Charles X.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 7, 1836._--There is no news of the Ministry except\r\nthe fact of resignation, which is definite. It is thought that M. de\r\nBroglie will never take office again, as the animosity of the Chamber\r\nis chiefly directed against himself.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers made no attempt to oppose resignation; he was actuated\r\nrather by the desire to secure an honourable withdrawal and to\r\ndissociate himself from colleagues whom he did not like than by any\r\nspecial devotion to the point at issue, though his defence was marked\r\nwith great skill.\r\n\r\nThe King summoned M. Humann, who _refused_, M. Molé, who _declined_,\r\nM. Dupin, who _spoke at random_--shades of meaning which are worthy of\r\nnote. In short, nothing has been done, nor can any action be regarded\r\nas probable. The friends of M. Molé say that he will no longer be sent\r\nfrom pillar to post or put up with requests, refusals, and vexations\r\nsuch as he experienced in November, and that if people will not submit\r\nto his views he will decline to interfere.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 8, 1836._--Yesterday I had a call from M.\r\nRoyer-Collard. He explains the attitude of the Chamber towards the\r\nlast Ministry as follows: The Ministry had lasted for three years and\r\nwas worn out, especially the doctrinaire members of it, while the\r\nCabinet had wearied the Chamber by too constantly pressing for\r\ndecisions and making personal matters Cabinet questions; moreover, the\r\nChamber had gone beyond its powers in the announcement issued at the\r\ntime when the laws concerning intimidation were passed;[7] it had been\r\nby no means popular in the provinces, while the disdainful folly of M.\r\nde Broglie had filled the cup to overflowing. Finally, as the country\r\nwas prosperous and peaceful both at home and abroad, the Chamber had\r\nthought the moment opportune to enounce its rights and to show the\r\nMinistry that it was not indispensable; while a popular question in\r\nthe provinces had provided it with an opportunity for displaying its\r\npower, in which determination it was supported by its political\r\nignorance, which will not allow it to foresee the extent of the\r\ncrisis. M. Royer-Collard added that the only two Ministers who could\r\nhave preserved their reputation in the Chamber were MM. Thiers and\r\nDuchâtel, but that here again some small period of exile would be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n  [7] In 1835, in consequence of Fieschi's attempt, the Ministry\r\n  proposed three severe legal enactments dealing with the jury and\r\n  the sentences in cases of rebellion, and, most important of all,\r\n  with the Press. The discussion upon these laws continued in the\r\n  Chamber from August 13, 1834, to September 29, and ended in a\r\n  complete success for the Government.\r\n\r\nYesterday we dined with M. Thiers in fulfillment of a long-standing\r\ninvitation. He was highly delighted and fluttering whenever he\r\npleased. He proposes to travel, and to visit Vienna, Berlin, Rome, and\r\nNaples; he will start in April. M. de Broglie, who was also at dinner,\r\nappeared sad and downcast, and I was astonished that he made no\r\nattempt to hide his feelings; it was not the devil, but the doctrine,\r\nthat he was burying.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I paid a visit to Madame de Lieven and made the\r\nacquaintance of M. Berryer. M. Royer-Collard, who sees him constantly,\r\ntold me in the morning that M. Berryer was very anxious to make my\r\nacquaintance. We were on our best behaviour. He talks simply and\r\nkindly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 9, 1836._--Yesterday we dined with the Sardinian\r\nAmbassador.[8] I was told that nothing had been yet decided concerning\r\nthe Ministry, and M. Molé, who was sitting near me, confirmed this\r\nstatement. He has declined to join the Third Party, in spite of the\r\nuniversal desire that he should do so. I believe that, for want of a\r\nbetter leader, M. Dupin will eventually profit for the time being by\r\nthis state of affairs; as, however, the little group which he leads is\r\nvery weak, he will be obliged to base his power upon the Left, and\r\nthis will cost him dear. His position will be analogous to that of the\r\nEnglish Whig Ministry confronted by O'Connell. I hope that this state\r\nof affairs will be of no long duration, though a short time is quite\r\nenough in which to take many retrograde steps. At the Château sadness\r\nprevails, uneasiness in the diplomatic world and anxiety in public\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n  [8] The Marquis de Brignole-Sale.\r\n\r\nThe young and beautiful Queen of Naples died on January 31, a few days\r\nafter the birth of her child. The news arrived yesterday.[9]\r\n\r\n  [9] Marie Christine, Princess of Savoy, died in giving birth to\r\n  the prince who was afterwards Francis II., the last King of\r\n  Naples.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 10, 1836._--The judges in Fieschi's case, and the\r\naudience, take a remarkable interest in this man. He is an\r\nunprecedented character; he has a fine intellect and a real genius for\r\nstrategy, while the terrors of his situation never obscure his memory,\r\nhis self-possession, or his penetration; he is a man of strong\r\npassions, especially where women are concerned. His affection for Nina\r\nLassave is remarkable; he constantly writes to her, and when he\r\nlearned that she had been unfaithful to him he reproached her for not\r\nwaiting a few days and sparing him this last bitterness, as his\r\nexecution would have set her free; all this was written in the most\r\ntouching style. Another point is that when M. Ladvocat sent money to\r\nFieschi, that he might provide himself with some small dainties in\r\nprison, instead of spending the money, he sent it to this woman Nina.\r\nShe wrote to thank him more or less in the following terms: \"I thank\r\nyou for thus depriving yourself for my sake; with what you have sent\r\nme I have bought a few decent things to do you credit before your\r\njudges, but as you will soon be unable to send me anything more, I am\r\neconomising, and am now mistress of forty francs.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark concerning economy is disgusting. Moreover, she wrote to\r\nFieschi to assure him that she had remained faithful to him, which is\r\nuntrue. Everybody seems to have been far more interested by these\r\namorous details than by the actual crime. What a strange time it is!\r\nFieschi's correspondence, in passing through the hands of M. Decazes,\r\nbecame the amusement of the House of Peers; but the truly astonishing\r\nfact is the notoriety which the whole story has given to Mlle. Nina,\r\nwho was formerly resident in the Salpêtrière. It is asserted that\r\nmonetary proposals have been made to her by men of high position;\r\nthere is no doubt that one hears the strangest descriptions of her\r\nbeauties and her imperfections, and it is a positive fact that she has\r\nonly one eye.\r\n\r\nIf Fieschi is a lover, he is no less attracted by religion. When the\r\nalmoner of the Chamber of Peers asked those under trial if they wished\r\nto hear Mass, Fieschi alone replied yes, and said that he was anxious\r\nto hear it as he was neither a heathen nor an atheist; that if he was\r\nnot a theological expert he had nevertheless read Plutarch and Cicero\r\nand firmly believed in the immortality of the soul; as the soul was\r\nnot divisible it could not be material, and that, in short, he\r\nbelieved in the spiritual nature of man. He asked the almoner to come\r\nand see him again and not to leave him after his sentence had been\r\npronounced. In view of such inconsistencies, how is it possible to\r\npass any absolute judgment on men?\r\n\r\nI believe the following to be an accurate bulletin of the Ministerial\r\ncrisis: Yesterday morning the King sent for Dupin, Sauzet, and Passy,\r\nand commissioned them to form a Ministry upon two conditions only:\r\nfirstly, they were not to give a post to any one who had voted against\r\nthe repressive laws; secondly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs must\r\nbe a man who would reassure European opinion and be agreeable to\r\nhimself. The three men replied that they understood the King's wishes,\r\nbut that they could not bind themselves until they had consulted their\r\nfriends; they then withdrew. At the Chamber they sent round a list,\r\nwhich was drawn up nearly as follows: Dupin to be Minister of Justice\r\nand President, Passy to be Minister of Finance, Flahaut of Foreign\r\nAffairs, Molitor of War, Montalivet of the Interior. I have since\r\nlearned that Montalivet refused the post in spite of the King's\r\nwishes, and that the King refused to accept the nomination of Flahaut.\r\nThe King wished to appoint Rumigny or Baudrand to the Ministry of\r\nForeign Affairs, and would have declared for the latter, if there had\r\nnot been a wish to retain him as a companion to the Prince Royal on\r\nhis travels. The Prince is very pleased at the fall of the last\r\nMinistry: I believe he is wrong; the Flahaut party are delighted. The\r\nMinisterial party hope to secure the election of M. Guizot as\r\nPresident of the Chamber of Deputies; the Opposition will support M.\r\nMartin du Nord.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I accompanied M. de Talleyrand to a dinner given by M.\r\nde Montalivet. Counts Pahlen and Apponyi were pale with fear inspired\r\nby the sight of M. de Flahaut's name on a list of Ministers. Marshal\r\nMaison was regretting the loss of his ambassadorship at St. Petersburg\r\nwith cries of rage which were not in the best of taste.\r\n\r\nWe then went to the last Ministerial reception given by the Duc de\r\nBroglie. M. de Broglie believes himself to be fully in touch with the\r\nrequirements of the time; he has no suspicion of the actual truth,\r\nthat he is the sole cause and object of the squabbling which is going\r\non, that he is the man rejected by the Chamber, and that if he were to\r\nsay to his colleagues, \"I see that I am myself the real\r\nstumbling-block; I will withdraw, but I beg you to remain,\" M. Molé\r\nwould take his place and everything would be settled to the general\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 11, 1836._--Madame de Rumford died yesterday morning\r\nafter breakfast; she had had some friends to dinner the evening\r\nbefore. She had been much changed for some time, but has always\r\nrefused to acknowledge herself an invalid, and remained as\r\ndiscourteous to death as she was to those about her. The loss of her\r\n_salon_ will be felt; it was a meeting-place, and there are very few\r\nthat are habitually regarded as such. Every one found something there\r\nto remind him of this or that period of his life. This loss has\r\nsaddened me; it is not well to have reached the age of eighty-four.\r\nBut M. de Rigny was fifty, Clémentine de Flahaut sixteen, Yolande de\r\nValençay two! Life is threatened at every step of the ladder, and one\r\nmust always be ready.\r\n\r\nThat old cat Sémonville, whose claws are always ready, reached the\r\nLuxembourg yesterday with the announcement that the Ministry was at\r\nlength settled. He was surrounded with questioners, and gave the list\r\nas follows: \"President of the Council, Madame Adélaide; Justice and\r\nPublic Worship, the Duchesse de Broglie; Foreign Affairs, the Duchesse\r\nde Dino;[10] Interior, the Comtesse de Boigne; War, the Comtesse de\r\nFlahaut; Marine, the Duchesse de Massa; Finance, the Duchesse de\r\nMontmorency; Commerce, the Marquise de Caraman!\" I sent this piece of\r\nwit to Madame de Lieven, in reply to a note asking for certain\r\ninformation; she replied that the King's condition at least was\r\nfulfilled, and that the Minister of Foreign Affairs was not likely to\r\ndisturb Europe.\r\n\r\n  [10] The author of these memoirs.\r\n\r\nThis is poor stuff, but poorer still is the fact that it is impossible\r\nto form a Ministry, in seriousness or otherwise. Yesterday I was at\r\nthe Tuileries. The Ministers who had resigned were all grouped about\r\nthe King, but, I think, with no particular object. It is deplorable!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 12, 1836._--Of Ministerial news there is none; all\r\nthat I have learned yesterday is as follows: Dupin, Passy, and Sauzet\r\nspent three hours with the King, and told him that they could not\r\nundertake the formation of a Ministry, as various intrigues had made\r\nthe attempt impossible; they were, however, ready themselves to enter\r\nthe Ministry, if their services were agreeable to the King. They then\r\nwithdrew, and the King sent for M. Molé in the course of the evening,\r\nbut I cannot say what passed at this interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 13, 1836._--I have the following information as\r\nregards the events of yesterday concerning the Ministerial crisis. M.\r\nMolé declares that he will not take office without M. Thiers, who will\r\nnot come in without M. Guizot; he, again, will not act without M. de\r\nBroglie, unless the latter recognises that he is himself the only real\r\nobstacle, insists that his colleagues should take office without him,\r\nand writes them a letter to that effect, dated from Broglie. M. de\r\nSalvandy attempted to enlighten him upon this point, but met with a\r\nvery poor reception. A lively scene is said to have taken place\r\nbetween MM. de Broglie and Guizot; certainly M. de Broglie is\r\nobviously agitated, and so ill-tempered as to rouse the pity of his\r\nfriends and the contempt of other men. Some people think that the King\r\nwill summon de Broglie and request him with greater authority than\r\nSalvandy used to put an end to this deplorable state of affairs, which\r\nis only continued on his account.\r\n\r\nDupin's chance has entirely disappeared. During the two days when it\r\nwas thought that he would be Minister, Thiers and Guizot both entered\r\nthe competition for the Presidency, and so gained an opportunity of\r\ncounting the votes in their favour. M. Guizot received eight, M.\r\nMartin du Nord fifteen; the remainder of the Ministerial party would\r\nhave voted for M. Thiers and secured for him the refusal of the\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 16, 1836._--Fieschi and his accomplices have been\r\ncondemned to death; M. de Mareuil came yesterday to tell us of the\r\nsentence, at eleven o'clock in the evening.[11]\r\n\r\n  [11] The sentence which condemned Fieschi, Pépin, and Morey to\r\n  death. They were executed at the Barrière Saint-Jacques on\r\n  February 19.\r\n\r\nIt seems that many of the peers gave long explanations to justify\r\ntheir manner of voting. A small fraction of the Chamber considered\r\nthat the circumstantial evidence against Pépin and Morey was\r\ninadequate to justify the extreme penalty, and preferred to inflict\r\npenal servitude for life. Fieschi was condemned to death unanimously,\r\nand M. Barthe asked that the punishments reserved for parricides\r\nshould be added to the death penalty.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers announce the death of Madame Bonaparte; her\r\ngreat-granddaughter--that is, the daughter of Joseph, who married the\r\nson of Lucien--was the only member of her numerous family at her side.\r\nCardinal Fesch has been very attentive to her, and she leaves him her\r\npictures; it is also thought that the division of her inheritance will\r\ncause fresh dissensions among her children, who are by no means at\r\nharmony with one another, for it seems that during her lifetime she\r\ngave considerable sums to Lucien, Jérôme, and to Madame Murat, which\r\nsums they are not willing to repay.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 17, 1836._--Yesterday the King assembled his former\r\nMinisters and announced that in the first place he would not accept\r\ntheir resignations until another Cabinet was formed. Furthermore, he\r\nsaid that it was only by an accident that a majority in the Chamber\r\nhad been against them; their system was that of the Chamber, although\r\ncertain individuals in the Cabinet might not be agreeable to the\r\nChamber, and he would therefore be delighted to see them all remain in\r\noffice; if, however, they thought that any of their members were\r\nlikely to keep the Chamber in a state of exasperation, he asked them\r\nto consider the matter among themselves and then to let him know upon\r\nwhat he could rely. M. de Broglie said that the King should make trial\r\nof the Third Party, to which the King replied: \"It may please you,\r\nsir, to restate the weakness of that Third Party, but it does not\r\nplease me to make so disastrous an attempt; I have had enough of three\r\ndays' ministries; the majority is not to be found either in the Third\r\nParty or in the Left, but with you, gentlemen, or, if not with all of\r\nyou, at any rate with some. Your arrangements and mutual engagements\r\nought to give way before the gravity of the situation: so much I\r\nexpect from your honesty and your desire for the general welfare; for\r\nmy own part, gentlemen, I shall fold my arms and bide my time at\r\nSaint-Cloud.\" MM. de Broglie and Guizot replied that no member of the\r\nCabinet was exactly bound, but that there were certain conventions\r\nwhich they must respect in each member's case. This was a very\r\ninopportune reply at such a moment, especially from the first speaker,\r\nwho could have cut the Gordian knot at one word and have simplified\r\nthe position. No one knows what the result will be, unless matters\r\nshould turn out as M. Royer-Collard predicted to M. Thiers last\r\nFriday: \"You are impossible to-day, but in a week you will be\r\nnecessary, indispensable, and absolute.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand and myself visited the Queen yesterday. The fact that\r\nthe Court was in mourning for the Queen of Naples, together with the\r\ntrial of Fieschi and the Ministerial crisis, made it impossible for\r\nthe Château to take part in the pleasures of the carnival, and a very\r\nserious spirit prevailed. The King's attention was occupied by\r\nthoughts of the punishment which awaited the prisoners condemned the\r\nprevious evening, and he had not ventured to go out, because he knew\r\nthat Madame Pépin and her children were lying in wait for him. The\r\nChâteau was mournful indeed, and formed a painful contrast with the\r\njoyful tumult in the streets. M. Pasquier came to tell the King that\r\nPépin had asked to see him that morning, so that the execution must be\r\npostponed until the next day.\r\n\r\nBefore going home I spent half an hour with Madame de Lieven. No one\r\nwas there except Lady Charlotte Grenville and M. Berryer, who said\r\nthat when one knew nothing one was able to say anything one liked,\r\nand that he had no hesitation in asserting that Thiers' was the only\r\npossible combination, and alone likely to be agreeable to the Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 19, 1836._--Yesterday morning I had a call from M.\r\nThiers, who had definitely accepted the task of forming a Cabinet and\r\nacting as President. He proposed to spend the rest of the day in\r\nmaking up his list. He has too much common sense to underrate the\r\ndifficulty of his new position, and too much courage or blindness to\r\nbe dismayed by it. M. Molé failed to secure election to the Academy;\r\nit has been a disastrous week for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 20, 1836._--The following are the actual words\r\nwritten by the King beneath the signature which he was obliged to\r\nappend to the death-warrants of Fieschi, Pépin, Morey, &c.: \"It is\r\nonly a profound sense of duty which induces me to give an approval\r\nwhich is one of the most painful acts of my life; however, considering\r\nthe frankness which Fieschi showed in his confession and his conduct\r\nduring the trial, I intend that the subordinate parts of his\r\npunishment shall be remitted, and I deeply regret that my conscience\r\nwill not allow me to do more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 21, 1836._--M. Thiers is finding difficulties in the\r\nway of his attempt to combine a Ministry; every one is willing to work\r\nwith him or under him, but not in company with others. At the same\r\ntime it is important that the Cabinet should be both strong and\r\nreputable. There are difficulties everywhere, even for superior\r\nmortals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 22, 1836._--M. de Talleyrand is in a very bad temper:\r\nthe newspapers and public opinion all regard him as responsible for\r\nthe new Ministry: the names have at length appeared in this morning's\r\n_Moniteur_.[12] He, however, has had nothing to do with it, and as the\r\nsudden rise of M. Thiers has not met with universal approval, the\r\nEnglish being particularly incensed, M. de Talleyrand is aroused to\r\ngreat irritation by all that he hears upon the subject, and vents his\r\nanger upon Paris, his age, and his position, and keenly regrets that\r\nhe ever left London.\r\n\r\n  [12] The Cabinet was as follows: M. Thiers, President of the\r\n  Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs; M. Sauzet, Keeper of the\r\n  Seals; M. de Montalivet, Minister of the Interior; M. d'Argout,\r\n  Financial Minister; M. Passy, Minister of Commerce and Public\r\n  Works; M. Pelet de la Lozère, Minister of Education; Marshal\r\n  Maison, Minister of War; Admiral Duperré, Minister of Naval\r\n  Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 23, 1836._--Yesterday, on returning home at the end\r\nof the morning, I found M. Berryer at my door; he had just left the\r\nChamber of Deputies, where Thiers had been speaking. Berryer has a\r\nhigh opinion of the talent, the intellectual power, and the capacity\r\nof Thiers. Berryer is himself the most unprejudiced, impartial, and\r\nsimple of characters; there is nothing artificial, affected, or\r\nextreme about him; it is difficult to think of him as a party man. In\r\nmy opinion, no one was ever less a party man, and perhaps he would be\r\nglad if he could avoid the necessity of taking sides entirely. The\r\nease, the lightness, the gentleness, and the simplicity of his\r\nconversation are the more creditable to him by contrast with his\r\nprofession and his position. The justice of his judgment and the\r\nkindness which is most constantly characteristic of it compel\r\nconfidence in his opinions and his statements.\r\n\r\nThiers' speech was received with marked coldness by the Chamber. The\r\nfact is fortunate for him, in my opinion. There is some danger that\r\nthe intoxication of success might lead to his fall, and anything which\r\nwill keep him from disaster can only be useful and for his good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 24, 1836._--M. Molé dined here yesterday. His bearing\r\nshows some traces of coldness and disappointment. He was unwilling to\r\nact in concert with M. Dupin in the matter of the Ministry;\r\nconsequently the latter, who commanded several votes in the French\r\nAcademy, withdrew them, and so brought about the rejection of M. Molé;\r\nhe then observed: \"M. Molé would not be my colleague, and I do not\r\ncare for him as my fellow Academician.\"\r\n\r\nParis is likely to become increasingly difficult as a place of\r\nresidence. Apart from the two great dynastic divisions which separate\r\nsociety, we shall now have to deal with all the factions caused by\r\ndisappointed ambition, the Molé, Broglie, Guizot, and Dupin factions,\r\nand finally the Thiers faction. These will all be as bitterly hostile\r\nto one another as the Legitimists are to the Moderate Party. All these\r\nfactions will never find any such common point of amalgamation as the\r\nChâteau might and should become; on the contrary, some object to the\r\nKing, others to our house. Detestation and malignancy are mutual, but\r\nno one is willing to examine himself or to recognise that there are\r\nfaults on all sides, and that the real causes of blame are to be found\r\nin himself. How strange is the blindness and how great the ill-faith\r\nof men, especially of those who are involved in public affairs and\r\ninterests!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 4, 1836._--Yesterday, at the house of M. de Talleyrand,\r\nM. Mignet related that Marchand, a former _valet de chambre_ under the\r\nEmperor, proposed to publish a commentary upon the \"Commentaries\" of\r\nCæsar, which Napoleon had dictated to him in the last weeks of his\r\nlife in St. Helena. Marchand often spoke to M. Mignet of Napoleon's\r\nlast moments, of the loneliness and emptiness of his life; in\r\nillustration, he said that one evening when the Emperor, who was then\r\nvery ill, was in bed, he pointed to the foot of the bed and said to\r\nhim: \"Marchand, sit down there and tell me something.\" Marchand said\r\nto him: \"Dear me, sire, what can I tell you who have done and seen so\r\nmuch?\" \"Tell me about your youth; that will be simple and true, and\r\nwill interest me,\" replied the Emperor. There is something very\r\npathetic about this little dialogue. What teaching might not Bossuet\r\nhave drawn from these few words--Bossuet, who did not disdain to\r\nintroduce the somewhat trivial anecdote of the fowl into the funeral\r\noration upon the Palatine! Surely the greatest homage to Bossuet is\r\nthe fact that every great misfortune, every triumph or failure, makes\r\nus turn towards the Eagle of Meaux, who alone could extol, lament, and\r\nimmortalise them worthily.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 5, 1836._--Yesterday morning MM. Berryer and Thiers met\r\nat my house. I think it would have been impossible to have been\r\npresent at a conversation more animated, sparkling, witty, surprising,\r\nkind, sincere, free, and true, or more devoid of all party spirit,\r\nthan that which then arose between these two men, so different and so\r\nhighly gifted. I also thought that it would never finish; they did not\r\ngo until after six o'clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 7, 1836._--M. Royer-Collard introduced me yesterday to\r\nM. de Tocqueville, the author of \"Democracy in America.\" He seemed to\r\nme to be a nice little man, simple and modest, with an intellectual\r\nexpression. We talked a great deal about England, and our views upon\r\nthe destiny of the country were quite in harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 9, 1836._--I had several times glanced at the \"Imitation\r\nof Jesus Christ.\" Whether it was that my knowledge of others and\r\nmyself was only superficial or that my mind was ill-prepared and too\r\nwandering, I had seen no great difference between this famous work and\r\nthe \"Journée du Chrétien\" and the \"Petit Paroissien.\" I had often been\r\nsurprised at the great reputation which this book enjoyed, but had\r\nnever found any pleasure in reading it. Chance led me to open it the\r\nother day with Pauline; the first lines caught my attention, and I\r\nhave since been reading it with ever increasing admiration. What\r\nintellectual power beneath the highest simplicity of form! What\r\nprofound knowledge of the deepest recesses of the human heart! What\r\nbeauty and enlightenment! And yet it is the work of an unknown monk.\r\nNothing humiliates me more than a failure of self-knowledge or shows\r\nme more clearly in what darkness I was sunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 10, 1836._--Yesterday I went with the Duchesse de\r\nMontmorency to a ball, given by Madame Salomon de Rothschild, the\r\nmother. The house is the most magnificent that can be conceived, and\r\nis therefore known as the Temple of Solomon. It is infinitely superior\r\nto her daughter-in-law's house, because the proportions are higher and\r\ngreater. The luxury of it is indescribable, but in good taste--pure\r\nRenaissance, without any mixture of other styles; the gallery in\r\nparticular is worthy of Chenonceaux, and one might have thought one's\r\nself at an entertainment given by the Valois. In the chief room the\r\narmchairs are made of gilt bronze instead of gilt wood, and cost a\r\nthousand francs apiece. The dining-hall is like the nave of a\r\ncathedral. All was well arranged and admirably lighted; there was no\r\ncrushing, and every courtesy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 11, 1836._--Yesterday I went to Saint-Thomas d'Aquin, to\r\nhear the Abbé de Ravignan, formerly the King's _procureur_; he is a\r\nfriend of Berryer, who praises him greatly, and a brother-in-law of\r\nGeneral Exelmans; I had known him in the Pyrenees, where I had been\r\nstruck by the beautiful expression of his face. He is a good preacher,\r\nwith an excellent delivery, while his style is pure and refined, but\r\nrather logical and argumentative than warm or sympathetic. He\r\ntherefore lays more stress upon evangelical dogma than upon morality,\r\nand seemed to me to be a man of talent rather than a great preacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 18, 1836._--With regard to my reflections upon\r\nBossuet,[13] you praise my attitude somewhat unduly. I have, indeed, a\r\nlove of truth, and the world, with the dreadful misery which it\r\ncontains, fills me with disgust; I have learned to fear the contagion\r\nof the world, under which I have suffered too long; I examine myself\r\nseriously, and am horrified to find myself immersed in the sorrow and\r\ngrief which are the lot of worldly people and are the destruction of\r\npeace of mind, charity, and purity. I make some attempt to burst my\r\nbonds and rise to a purer region; but none the less my efforts are\r\nusually impotent, and my struggles vain and futile. As a rule I cannot\r\ntell whether the moral weariness which overwhelms me is due to the sad\r\nsight of the deplorable agitations amid which I live, or to the no\r\nless deplorable agitation of my inward life. When we have spent years\r\namid the struggles of life and desire to change our path, however\r\nremote may be the road which leads us forward, we find ourselves a\r\nburden to ourselves; we can neither go forward with our load nor throw\r\nit off straightway; we stumble and retrace our steps; we prove\r\nourselves but feeble travellers, and our goal recedes as our desire to\r\nreach it increases. Such is my case....\r\n\r\n  [13] Extract from a letter.\r\n\r\nYesterday, towards the end of the morning, M. de Tocqueville came to\r\npay his call; I like him. The Duc de Noailles also called; he is not\r\nso attractive, though by no means disagreeable. Another caller was\r\nBerryer, who might be most agreeable if his mind and bearing did not\r\nbetray traces of low life, which have struck my notice. However, the\r\nconversation never flagged, as the first visitor has sound views, the\r\nsecond good judgment, and the third that mental alacrity which enables\r\nhim to apprehend a point at once. The conversation of these\r\ndistinguished men was concerned only with facts, and not with people:\r\nnames were not mentioned; there was no gossip, no bitterness or\r\nextravagance. The talk was as it should always be, especially at a\r\nlady's house.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 20, 1836._--How deep a melancholy may be inspired by the\r\nfirst fine spring day, when it fails to harmonise with one's own frame\r\nof mind! For forty-eight hours the weather has been mild and lovely,\r\nthe atmosphere filled with sweetness and light and breathing joy and\r\nhappiness; new life, new warmth and pleasure are springing into being,\r\nand I feel suffocated in this town. The public promenades cannot take\r\nthe place of the country, and nothing can bring back the sweet\r\nspringtime of last year, with its flowers, its wide horizon, and its\r\nfreshness, in which it was so easy to take breath. I would worship any\r\none who could give me back these things! And instead I drive with\r\nMadame de Lieven through the Bois de Boulogne in a closed carriage!\r\nSuch was my occupation yesterday, while M. de Talleyrand was at the\r\nAcademy of Moral and Political Science, voting for M. de Tocqueville,\r\nwho failed to secure election.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 24, 1836._--The Princess Belgiojoso is rather striking\r\nthan beautiful: she is extremely pale, her eyes are too far apart, her\r\nhead too square, her mouth large and her teeth discoloured; but she\r\nhas a good nose, and her figure would be pretty if it were somewhat\r\nfuller; her hair is jet black, and she wears striking dresses; she has\r\nintellect, but wants balance, and is full of artistic whims and\r\ninconsistencies; her manner is intentionally and skilfully natural,\r\nsufficiently to hide her affectation, while her affectation seems to\r\ncounterbalance a certain innate vulgarity, which her flatterers style\r\nan untamed nature. Such is my impression of this personage, with whom\r\nI have but the slightest acquaintance.\r\n\r\nM. Royer-Collard found me reading the \"Imitation\" the other day, and\r\nbrought me yesterday a pretty little copy which he has had from his\r\nyouth, and has almost invariably carried about with him. I have been\r\ndeeply touched by this gift, and regard it as a most precious\r\npossession. My only objection to this little book is the fact that it\r\nis in Latin: I never knew Latin well, and I find that I have now\r\nforgotten it. I think I shall have to take it up again.\r\n\r\nM. Royer asked me to give him in exchange some book which I had\r\nconstantly read. I gave him a copy of Bossuet's \"Funeral Orations,\"\r\ndeeply scored with my marks; the ribbon-mark is torn away, but a\r\nhairpin happened to be marking one of the passages in the oration on\r\nthe Princess Palatine, which had a special meaning for myself. M.\r\nRoyer accepted the little volume most gratefully.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening I went to the Italian Opera, and Berryer paid a\r\nvisit to my box. His mind was full of the morning session in the\r\nChamber of Deputies and of M. Guizot's _formidable_ speech. M. Thiers\r\nproposes to reply this morning, as, indeed, he must, unless he wishes\r\nto see M. Guizot become paramount in the Chamber; in short, we are to\r\nsee the real adversaries engaged in a hand-to-hand struggle. This is\r\nan event, and is so regarded. Berryer described the whole affair\r\nmarvellously well, without bitterness against any one, and without a\r\nword more than was necessary to make the situation clear. In ten\r\nminutes he had told me everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 27, 1836._--Yesterday morning I had the honour of seeing\r\nthe King with Madame Adélaïde; his conversation was charming. He was\r\nkind enough to tell me stories of his marriage, of the Court of\r\nPalermo and the famous Queen Caroline. I also heard that Prince\r\nCharles of Naples and Miss Penelope arrived here within the last two\r\ndays in a state of complete destitution. This was an embarrassing\r\nevent, and in a sense discreditable, especially to the Queen.[14]\r\n\r\n  [14] Prince Charles of Naples, brother of the Duchesse de Berry,\r\n  was the nephew of Queen Marie Amélie.\r\n\r\nI have reason to believe that Thiers did not reply forthwith to\r\nGuizot's great speech the other day for reasons of prudence, and in\r\nobedience to the orders of his superiors; but he will lose nothing by\r\nwaiting, and we shall see a striking explosion upon the next\r\nopportunity. I think the authorities were unwilling to regard the\r\nquestion as a duel between two individuals, and have preferred to let\r\nthe effect of the first speech wear off before offering a reply. In\r\nany case, an enormous majority responded to the effort that was made.\r\nThe only vexatious point is the number of concessions offered by M.\r\nSauzet in his speech, and on this subject I have noticed some strong\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\nM. de Tocqueville's name was proposed, without his knowledge, to the\r\nAcademy of Political and Moral Science by M. Cousin; M. Tocqueville\r\nhas told me that he did not wish to seek election again. As the\r\ngrandson of M. de Malesherbes, he has no desire to join an Academy of\r\nmere figureheads, of which, for the most part, this institution is\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 29, 1836._--It is certain that all idea of intervention\r\nin Spain has been abandoned by every grade within the Governmental\r\nhierarchy; some had never entertained the project, and others have\r\ndropped it. I think there is no reason to fear any imprudence whatever\r\nin this direction.\r\n\r\nRumour is entirely occupied with a conversation between the King and\r\nGuizot, in which the former is said to have expressed his extreme\r\ndispleasure with the dates which were given as marking the good system\r\nof administration. The King said that the system was not the work of\r\nany individual, but was his own, and that the only date he would\r\nrecognise was his own date, August 9. He added that it was bad policy\r\nto attack the only Cabinet which could command a majority at that\r\nmoment. Guizot replied that if the King cared to test the matter he\r\nwould see that the majority was to be found elsewhere. \"Not so,\"\r\nreturned the King; \"it is you, sir, who are deluded, and you fail to\r\nsee that the course you are pursuing rather divides you from the\r\npoints at issue than brings you nearer to them. If you continue, you\r\nwill perhaps force me to take a measure which I detest, and which will\r\nassuredly be more displeasing to yourself; that measure is a\r\ndissolution of the Chamber, please remember.\" I believe this\r\nconversation to be literally exact, and I think it will induce people\r\nto consider their words and deeds more carefully, the more so as the\r\ndoctrinaires, who know perfectly well that they have no chance of\r\nre-election, will shrink from a dissolution.\r\n\r\nM. de Chateaubriand has sold his works, unedited or as yet unwritten,\r\nfor a hundred and fifty thousand francs cash, in addition to a yearly\r\nincome of twelve thousand francs payable to his wife upon his death.\r\nHe is said to be completely upset by the payment of his debts, and his\r\nfuture existence which is thus defined and circumscribed seems to him\r\na heavy burden. Everything he writes, even apart from his memoirs,\r\nwill belong to his publishers in return for a scale of payment now\r\nlaid down. The manuscripts of his memoirs have been solemnly sealed up\r\nin his presence in an iron box, which has been deposited with a\r\nsolicitor. He says that his thoughts have suffered imprisonment for\r\ndebt in place of himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 30, 1836._--I have certainly heard more music this year\r\nthan last; as I am deprived of all my favourite amusements, I have\r\ndevoted myself wholeheartedly, without reserve, to music, and have\r\nsought opportunities for hearing it. As the advance of years or\r\ncircumstances diminish my tastes, the pleasures which are left to me\r\nare intensified by the disappearance of others; affection takes the\r\nplace of coquetry and music of dancing; reading and meditation replace\r\nidle conversations, with their malignity or indiscretions; I drive\r\ninstead of calling, and prefer rest to excitement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 13, 1836._--I took Pauline yesterday evening to a\r\ncharity lottery at the house of the Duchesse de Montmorency, where\r\nthere was a crowd. All the Faubourg Saint-Germain were there,\r\nincluding even the Duchesse de Gontaut, formerly governess to the Duc\r\nde Bordeaux; she condescended so far as to bow to me very politely.\r\nPauline was interested by everything, as girls of fifteen usually are.\r\nShe was very pretty; her hair was simply done, but dressed by the\r\ngreat Edouard; she wore a sky-blue dress, and looked fresh as a rose,\r\nwith her calm and dainty bearing and her happy little face; in short,\r\nshe met with general approval, consequently I felt well disposed to\r\nevery one; the slights formerly inflicted upon me by this or that\r\nperson were forgotten when a pleasant word or a kind look was\r\naddressed to Pauline. It is certainly better not to live in hostility\r\nwith society, and if one is so wrong-headed or unfortunate it is very\r\npleasant to make one's daughter a means of reconciliation.\r\n\r\nI have letters from England telling me that the Duchess of Gloucester\r\nhas become the happiest person in the world; Lady Georgiana Bathurst\r\nis her lady of honour; she is at home every evening, and her house is\r\nthe meeting-place of the high Tories; all the news is to be heard\r\nthere, and gossip goes on, with which the Duchess delights the King\r\nevery morning. The King of England sees his Ministers only on\r\nbusiness, and has no social intercourse with them. Lord Melbourne does\r\nnot care or complain, and goes his own way without worrying the King,\r\nwhich seems to me to be a sound plan.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning, thanks to a special ticket, for which I sent to ask\r\nthe Archbishop, I was able to hear the last of the series of lectures\r\ngiven at Notre-Dame by the Abbé Lacordaire. He is starting for Rome\r\nto-day, and will be absent for two years. There were at least five\r\nthousand persons in the church, nearly all schoolboys and girls. Among\r\nthe men who came in with the Archbishop and were favoured with seats\r\non the Banc de l'OEuvre I recognised the Marquis de Vérac, the Duc\r\nde Noailles, and M. de Tocqueville. I was placed just behind this\r\nbench, with some fifty ladies, none of whom I knew; I was opposite to\r\nthe pulpit and did not lose a single word. Imagination, vigour, and a\r\nstyle far removed from that of the seminary are the distinctive\r\nqualities of the Abbé Lacordaire; he is a young man with a good\r\ndelivery. His use of metaphor, however, seemed to me to be slightly\r\nconfused and somewhat too daring, while his doctrine allowed no room\r\nfor the beautiful and humble theory of grace. I think that St.\r\nAugustine, the great apostle of grace, would have found matter for\r\ncriticism in his words. On the whole, I was interested and struck with\r\nthe attentive attitude of his audience. The Archbishop concluded the\r\nlecture with some suitable words of thanks and farewell to the young\r\npreacher, and with a blessing at once appropriate, simple, and gentle\r\nupon the congregation, which was received with surprising respect by\r\nhis young hearers. It must be said that when the Archbishop avoids\r\npolitics and the commonplaces of the seminary he can produce, as he\r\ndid yesterday, a noble and touching effect, with his fine face and\r\ngestures and his appealing tone, in his splendid cathedral and from\r\nhis exalted position, whence he looked down upon these many young\r\nfaces. M. de Tocqueville, who called upon me towards the end of the\r\nmorning, was even then moved by the scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 13, 1836._--MM. Hyde de Neuville, de Jumilhac, de Cossé,\r\nJacques de Fitz-James, and de Montbreton have all started for Prague,\r\nto ask Charles X. to give up the Duc de Bordeaux. In the event of a\r\nrefusal they have resolved to carry him off, and flatter themselves\r\nthat they will have the co-operation of the young Prince in the\r\nattempt. They wish to find a home for him in Switzerland, where he is\r\nto be educated, and so brought nearer to France in every sense of the\r\nterm. This project, which is in itself somewhat visionary, is reduced\r\nto absurdity by the boasting and gossip with which it has been\r\nannounced. Another plan, of which the police have been informed, is to\r\ncarry off one of the young princes of royal blood and to keep him as a\r\nhostage. The Minister of the Interior has been somewhat disturbed by\r\nthis proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 21, 1836._--A courier arrived yesterday from Vienna\r\nbringing a reply conceived in the most gracious terms to the\r\ninsinuations which have been made concerning the Duc d'Orléans and his\r\nproposed journey in Austria. All that was avoided under the Duc de\r\nBroglie has been welcomed under M. Thiers, to whom personally the\r\nreply referred in very kind terms. Something of the same kind is now\r\nexpected from Berlin. The departure of the Prince and of his brother,\r\nthe Duc de Nemours, is fixed for May 4, but the fact will not be\r\nannounced for another five days, when they will have returned from\r\nChantilly. The return journey is to be made by Turin. The Sardinian\r\nCourt, which feels the want of some support, is inclined, after much\r\nhesitation, to look to France. My son, Valençay, will accompany the\r\nPrinces; he will be the only unattached member of their suite with\r\nthem. It was proposed to give him a title and an official position,\r\nbut I objected, as my son is sure to be well received anywhere.\r\n\r\nYesterday at dinner at the house of M. de Talleyrand a quarrel arose\r\nbetween M. Thiers and M. Bertin de Veaux, the result of which, I\r\nthink, has been the opposite of what was expected: instead of pacific\r\nexplanations a duel became the consequence. I was on tenterhooks, and\r\neventually checked the dissension almost brutally. Every one, I think,\r\napproved my action, which I would have taken earlier if I had not\r\nthought that M. de Talleyrand was the proper person to intervene; he,\r\nhowever, did not even exert himself to change the conversation. Bertin\r\nde Veaux was constantly aggressive, while Thiers for a long time was\r\nperfectly calm, until he grew excited and angry, and at length they\r\nhurled political defiance at one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 23, 1836._--Mrs. Norton has written a letter to Mr.\r\nEllice, which is a kind of manifesto, and has sent it to me with\r\norders to communicate it to her foreign compatriots. I have read the\r\nletter, and, if her words are to be believed, she emerges from this\r\nfoul story as pure as Desdemona.[15] I hope indeed that it is so. The\r\nwhole business seems to me very vulgar and in very bad taste.\r\n\r\n  [15] Reference is here made to an action for divorce brought\r\n  against Mrs. Norton by her husband, which made a great stir in\r\n  England at this time. The intimacy of Mrs. Norton with Lord\r\n  Melbourne was well known. However, the verdict given in the\r\n  following June acquitted Lord Melbourne, but Mrs. Norton and her\r\n  husband separated.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse de Coigny, who has always come to England for her\r\nconfinements, in order to ensure the birth of girls, was to start this\r\nmorning to London for the same reason, but owing to mistaken\r\ncalculations she was yesterday confined of a fine boy, which is a\r\nbitter disappointment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 26, 1836._--Visitors returning from Chantilly were most\r\nenthusiastic yesterday about the beauty of the spot, the extensive\r\nsociety to be found there, the excitement of the races, the brilliancy\r\nof the hunt, and, in the case of those who were at the Château, the\r\ngraciousness of the Prince Royal. The English say that apart from the\r\nraces themselves, which, however, are by no means bad, these three\r\ndays at Chantilly are much superior to Ascot, Epsom, and any meeting\r\nof the kind in England.\r\n\r\nHunting was carried on with the pack of the Prince of Wagram, and some\r\nfour hundred young men rode out; but only thirty were in at the death\r\nof the stag.\r\n\r\nThe Prince Royal is to start on the 3rd or 4th, and will go straight\r\nto Metz to visit the School of Artillery; he will not stop at any of\r\nthe small Courts, which he proposes carefully to avoid by taking all\r\nkinds of unusual routes under the pretext that they are more direct.\r\n\r\nYesterday I dined with Madame de la Redorte, and met several people,\r\nincluding General Alava, who told us the story of the duel between\r\nMendizabal and Isturitz, in which neither combatant received a\r\nscratch.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to expect a Ministerial crisis at Madrid which might affect\r\nhis position as ambassador.\r\n\r\nAlava is so inclined to exaggerate that when he was at the house of M.\r\nDupin at a reception of Deputies the host asked him, touching M.\r\nBerryer on the shoulder, whether he knew this Deputy. Alava\r\nstraightway exclaimed: \"Certainly I know M. Berryer, and _I share all\r\nhis opinions_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 27, 1836._--The route of the Prince Royal passes through\r\nVerdun, Metz, Trèves, Düsseldorf, Hildesheim, Magdeburg, Potsdam, and\r\nBerlin. All the Ministers of Saxony, Hanover, and Bavaria have brought\r\npressing invitations from their Sovereigns asking the Prince to make a\r\nstay with them. These have been declined under the pretext of want of\r\ntime, but in reality owing to some ill-feeling caused by the continued\r\naffronts and insults from Munich; if the Prince refused one invitation\r\nhe obviously could not accept others without a declaration of\r\nhostility. He is sorry, however, to hurry by Dresden, whence there has\r\nnever been any cause of complaint. From Berlin he will proceed to\r\nVienna, by way of Breslau and Brünn.\r\n\r\nFor some days I have been reading a few volumes of the \"Essais de\r\nMorale\" by Nicole; our curiosity concerning this work was aroused by\r\nMadame de Sévigné. They are doubtless excellent, but I think one must\r\nbe somewhat more advanced than I am to admire them keenly. There is a\r\ncertain dry austerity apparent which somewhat repels me. To these many\r\nphilosophical arguments I prefer the touching phrase of St. Augustine:\r\n\"If you are afraid of God, throw yourself into the arms of God.\"\r\nEventually, perhaps, I shall learn to appreciate Nicole, as one's\r\nmental tastes change with one's age and circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 28, 1836._--Pozzo has received the order of St. Andrew\r\nin diamonds, and at the same time unlimited leave of absence to travel\r\nin Italy. I imagine that he will soon pass this way.\r\n\r\nThe journey of the Prince Royal has been arranged to begin a day\r\nearlier, and he is to start on the 2nd. Berlin will not be reached for\r\nten days, as he is to put up every night, while each day's journey\r\nwill not be too long, as they wish him to arrive fresh and alert and\r\nready to undergo military fatigues, the manœuvres, festivities, and\r\nother duties. This seems to me very sensible. The Prince Royal has\r\nreceived a formal invitation to the manœuvres at Berlin. Hence his\r\nreception cannot be anything but excellent. The invitation has\r\ncertainly been sought, but it is undoubtedly an invitation, and\r\naccusations of importunity or rashness are therefore out of place. The\r\nDuc and the Duchesse d'Angoulême will naturally have left Vienna when\r\nthe two Princes arrive there.\r\n\r\nYesterday I accompanied the Comtesse de Castellane to a reading given\r\nby M. de Rémusat upon historical incidents in the style of the\r\n\"Barricades\"; \"The Night of St. Bartholomew\" was his subject. It was\r\nclearly and brightly treated, and the author assures us that much\r\nhistorical research has been devoted to it, but it was so long that\r\nthe second part had to be postponed until Tuesday. To sit through a\r\nreading is an exhausting business.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 1, 1836._--Yesterday was Pauline's ball--a pretty scene\r\nand entirely successful. There was no crowd, plenty of light, young\r\nand pretty people in full gaiety, and polite young men acting as\r\npartners to the ladies, all in excellent style and taste, and the\r\ncompany most carefully selected. It was not exactly exclusive, but the\r\nFaubourg Saint-Germain were in preponderant numbers. My cousin, Madame\r\nde Chastellux, for instance, went to the trouble of coming. In short,\r\nI was well pleased with our little success and with the delight of\r\nPauline.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 2, 1836._--Yesterday news arrived from Berlin of the\r\npreparations made to receive the young Princes. The King said that\r\nthey should have the kind of reception given to his son-in-law, the\r\nEmperor. They are to stay at the old palace. An hour after their\r\narrival all the princes will come to pay their first calls; in short,\r\neverything is to go off as well as possible. The Carlist faction is\r\noverwhelmed, and the aggressive members of it are quite ill in\r\nconsequence; the moderate members are casting tender glances at the\r\nChâteau des Tuileries, and yesterday M. de Chabrol, formerly Naval\r\nMinister, and M. Mounier went to the Château. M. de Noailles would be\r\nready to do the same were it not for his wife, whose feelings he has\r\nto consider--and reasonably, for she, though a most worthy person, is\r\nvery extravagant in her political ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 4, 1836._--Yesterday I went to hear the conclusion of M.\r\nde Rémusat's \"Night of St. Bartholomew.\"[16] It is clever and\r\ntalented, but I repeat that this style of performance is a mistake,\r\nand a good historical narrative would be much more interesting to me.\r\n\r\n  [16] This work was published after the death of the Comte de\r\n  Rémusat in 1878, by his son Paul.\r\n\r\nI have seen M. Royer-Collard, and also M. Thiers. The former said that\r\nthe doctrinaires were decisively defeated in the Dupin dispute, as the\r\nChamber had pronounced against them. The second is very pleased with\r\nhis reports from the Russian Ambassador and from the Court of St.\r\nPetersburg, which are beginning to become flattering. I believe he is\r\non the way to another reconciliation which he thinks of more\r\nimportance, with Bertin de Veaux, but this is still a profound secret.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 6, 1836._--I have been deeply affected by the death of the\r\ngood Abbé Girolet. He followed the fine precept of Bossuet, and the\r\nonly precaution which he took against the attacks of death was the\r\ninnocence of his life, for all his interests were so neglected that he\r\nhas left me a fine complication to unravel, which demands my immediate\r\npresence at Rochecotte. I shall start the day after to-morrow, and\r\nthey are only waiting for me to take the seals off his property. A\r\nwill in which he has left me everything has been found, but where or\r\nwhat may this everything be? This is as yet unknown, and there is some\r\nfear that there may be more debts than property, which fact would\r\nprevent me from beginning the charitable foundations which I promised\r\nto take in hand after his death. I shall find a very obvious void at\r\nRochecotte, and shall miss that gentle look which clung so\r\naffectionately to me. And then how sad are the details of his death!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, May 10, 1836._--No interesting news can be expected from\r\nme in this retired corner of the world, where I can boast only of\r\npeace and silence and of solitude--three excellent things which I\r\nappreciate the more as I have left, in the words of the \"Imitation,\"\r\n\"the tumultuous commerce of men, which arouses vanity even in the\r\nsimple-minded, and eventually enslaves the soul.\"\r\n\r\nI spent the evening with M. Vestier, my good architect, over plans and\r\narrangements for the vault of the Abbé and for my own. This will be\r\narranged quite simply in the parish cemetery on the hillside before\r\nthat beautiful view, in the pure air, looking out upon the rising sun.\r\nThe vaults are to be very simply surrounded by shrubs and an iron\r\nrailing; there will be nothing more than names and dates. Thus his\r\nlast resting-place will be as simple as was his mind, and I trust that\r\nmine will be equally so. The wishes of men are so rarely performed\r\nafter their deaths that during our lifetime we should act as far as we\r\ncan. I had considerable difficulty in inducing Vestier to undertake\r\nthis simple work. He says it is horrible to be giving orders for the\r\ndigging of my grave, and at length the poor fellow began to weep, but\r\nhe yielded at last, for he is very obedient to me.[17]\r\n\r\n  [17] This plan was not entirely carried out; the Abbé alone was\r\n  buried at Saint-Patrice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, May 13, 1836._--Yesterday I received a long letter from\r\nmy son, Valençay, from Coblenz. Full honour has been done to the\r\nPrinces; M. the Duc d'Orléans has invariably invited to dinner the\r\nauthorities commissioned to welcome him. He speaks German with a\r\nfluency which is much appreciated. In every town regimental bands are\r\nconstantly playing under the windows of the Princes, and, in short,\r\nall due attention is shown to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, May 18, 1836._--I have been here since the day before\r\nyesterday, and am expecting M. de Talleyrand and Pauline to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI have been reading a narrative written by one of the chief nuns of\r\nPort Royal, about the reform of their establishment, which was carried\r\nout by the Mother Marie Angélique de Sainte-Madeleine Arnauld, and\r\nabout their persecution, in the time of their celebrated abbess, the\r\nMother Angélique de Saint-Jean Arnauld, a niece of the foregoing and a\r\ndaughter of M. d'Andilly. They were great minds and strong souls, and\r\nhow remarkable are the details of the story! What a race were these\r\nArnaulds, and M. Nicole and the Abbé de Saint-Cyran! All these names\r\nare to be found in the writings of Madame de Sévigné. Her friend, M.\r\nde Pomponne, was Arnauld, the son of M. d'Andilly. This was a peculiar\r\nfamily, even in its own time, and it was said that Pascal was quite a\r\nnonentity compared with Antoine Arnauld. They must have been giants\r\nindeed; and if giants at their time, what would they seem now?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, May 22, 1836._--Yesterday I had a letter from my son,\r\nValençay, from Berlin. He is delighted, and with reason, for apart\r\nfrom the generally satisfactory character of the journey, he is\r\ntreated with especial kindness, which is particularly touching to me\r\nas it is due to consideration for myself. The Prince Royal told him\r\nthat he had always regarded me as his sister, that he would treat him\r\nas a nephew, and that my letter was delightful. He objected, however,\r\nthat there was not enough of the nursery about him. The Duchess of\r\nCumberland and my godmother, Princess Louise,[18] have been quite\r\nmotherly, and the Queen of the Low Countries has also been very kind,\r\ntogether with M. Ancillon, Herr von Humboldt, and the Countess of\r\nRedern. M. de Valençay assures me that the Crown Prince of Prussia was\r\nneither cold nor repellent in his reception of the Duc d'Orléans, but,\r\non the contrary, kind and cordial; the Crown Princess and Princess\r\nWilliam the younger were equally charming; every one else behaved very\r\nproperly, as also did the sight-seers along the routes, and our\r\nPrinces showed perfect prudence. There was some trouble in inducing\r\nthe young French officers to take off their Belgian decorations; the\r\nDuc d'Orléans was anxious that they should not wear them at all at\r\nBerlin, but they showed some reluctance, and eventually it was agreed\r\nthat they should remove them when meeting the Queen of the Low\r\nCountries.[19] A courier came to Berlin with an urgent letter from the\r\nKing of Saxony inviting the Princes to pass through Dresden. I do not\r\nknow whether that will induce them to change their route. The two\r\nPrinces attended service in a Catholic church in Berlin on Sunday, and\r\ntheir action produced an excellent effect.\r\n\r\n  [18] The Princess Louise was the daughter of Prince Ferdinand of\r\n  Prussia, the youngest brother of Frederick the Great. She married\r\n  Prince Antoine Radziwill in 1796.\r\n\r\n  [19] Queen Wilhelmina of the Low Countries was the daughter of\r\n  King Frederick William II. of Prussia, and sister of the king\r\n  then reigning, Frederick William III.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, May 23, 1836._--Yesterday, the Day of Pentecost, was spent\r\nas follows, and will give an idea of our usual mode of life in this\r\nplace: First of all came high mass at the parish church, which lasted\r\nfor two full hours, thanks to a sermon from the vicar, who took the\r\nmore pains as he saw me in the Castle pew. The heat was extreme, and\r\nthe smell unpleasant, while the crowd was almost as great as at\r\nSaint-Roch. The result for me was a severe headache, which passed off\r\nto some extent during a long drive which I took with M. de Talleyrand,\r\nto the ponds in the Forest of Gâtines. Several people from the town\r\ndined with us. I walked for a little after dinner, while Pauline went\r\nfor a drive with her uncle; I wrote until nine o'clock, when the post\r\ngoes, and when M. de Talleyrand came in. The day was concluded with\r\nnewspapers, tea, and piquet.\r\n\r\nThese days are very pleasant when I am not alarmed about M. de\r\nTalleyrand's health, and I thank God for them as I go to bed. I no\r\nlonger consider the amount of amusement or interest or pleasure to be\r\ngained; one day perhaps that will return; now that M. de Talleyrand\r\nand my children are well and my mind is free from anxiety, and my\r\ntemper sufficiently kind to make life pleasant for those around me, I\r\nask for nothing more. When we are able to perform a complete\r\nrenunciation of self, we find our burden lightened, and the low and\r\nheavy flight of selfishness is replaced by the rapid sweep of\r\noutstretched wings, which is a pleasure in itself. My courage and my\r\nself-possession only disappear when I see sickness threatening or\r\nstriking down my family, for I have only reached the threshold of that\r\nstage of resignation in which one sacrifices one's self to the things\r\nof heaven. I doubt if I shall ever pass within it. But enough of this,\r\nor I shall be thought as religious as a lady of the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Germain. I am very far from that point, which I shall never\r\nentirely reach, for my independence will never allow me to follow the\r\nbeaten track or confine myself to particular practices, attitudes, and\r\nobservances; at the same time, given my natural taste for good books,\r\nthe natural seriousness of my mind, my wide experience, and the\r\nsincerity of my judgments upon myself, it will be hard if I do not\r\nlearn to draw consolation at least from the one perennial source.\r\n\r\nThe Carnavalet residence is for sale at a price of a hundred and forty\r\nthousand francs. If I dared, I would buy it, and I am, indeed,\r\nextremely tempted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, May 26, 1836._--The correspondence between M. de Talleyrand\r\nand Madame Adélaïde continues animated and very affectionate, and\r\ngives me some work.\r\n\r\nThe following news reached us from Paris by letters of yesterday's\r\ndate: Alava is overthrown, and Miraflores proclaims himself the\r\nsuccessor; Alava says that the affairs of his country reduce him to\r\ndespair. As a matter of fact the newspapers mention some strange\r\naffairs in the Assembly of the Procuradores, and great is the\r\nconfusion caused by the whole business of the change of Ministry. Some\r\npeople who declare themselves well informed, assert that Isturitz, to\r\nrelieve himself of embarrassment, would be inclined to come to an\r\nunderstanding with Don Carlos and to arrange a marriage between Queen\r\nIsabella and her cousin.\r\n\r\nLady Jersey has given orders for copies of her correspondence with\r\nLady Pembroke to be sent to her. It seems that this correspondence is\r\nbeyond all that could be imagined in maid-servant style. She also\r\nwishes M. de Talleyrand to read all these details.\r\n\r\nI have a letter from Princess Louise of Prussia, my godmother, which\r\nspeaks in very high terms of the young French Princes. Princess Louise\r\nis a clever woman, naturally inclined to sarcasm and severity, and her\r\nappreciation is therefore the more valuable. M. de Valençay writes to\r\nme that he has been greatly struck by the beauty of the Princesses, by\r\ntheir jewels and the elegance of their dress. Herr von Humboldt took\r\nthe Princes and their suite to see the museums and the artists'\r\nstudios. The Crown Prince of Prussia has a taste for art, and has\r\ngreatly stimulated these matters in Berlin. The Duc d'Orléans has\r\ngiven great pleasure by ordering a statue from Rauch, the chief\r\nsculptor in Prussia, and the King's favourite. The shyness of the\r\nQueen of the Low Countries is even greater than that of the Duc de\r\nNemours. This mutual defect seems to have brought them together, for I\r\nam told that the Queen has conceived a friendship for the young Prince\r\nand that long conversations have taken place between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, May 29, 1836._--Yesterday I read the new play of M. Casimir\r\nDelavigne, _Une Famille au Temps de Luther_. The work contains some\r\nfine lines, but is quite unsuited for the stage, and nothing is colder\r\nthan its theological discussions, even when they conclude with crime;\r\nmoreover, these forms of fanaticism are somewhat wearisome, discordant\r\nas they are with the spirit of our time. Finally, the dreadful\r\nmassacre of St. Bartholomew has become even tiresome, and the best\r\nproof of the fact that both it and the atrocities of the Atrides have\r\nlost their power to thrill, is their recitation with songs and dances.\r\n\r\nMadame Adélaïde informs M. de Talleyrand that the Crown Princess of\r\nPrussia has written to her mother, the Queen-Dowager of Bavaria,\r\nsaying that she was _forced to agree_ to the proposal to show honour\r\nto the French Princes, and that a very good friend of Louis-Philippe\r\nhad advised them to show themselves in public.\r\n\r\nThe King of Naples has now left home, some say to marry a princess of\r\nModena, and others to pay court to the daughter of the Archduke\r\nCharles, and others, again, to have a look at the young princesses of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThe King is having a full-length portrait of François I. painted for\r\nValençay, and another of the Grande Mademoiselle; the former built the\r\nCastle, and the latter visited it and praised it in her memoirs. The\r\nKing is also sending M. de Talleyrand the chair in which Louis XVIII.\r\nwas wheeled about, and he has informed us through Madame that if he\r\nshould go to Bordeaux, as is possible, he would pass this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, May 31, 1836._--It seems that neither intellect nor years\r\ncan shelter people from foolishness, and a great act of folly has been\r\ncommitted by M. Ancillon in his marriage with Mlle. de Verquignieulle,\r\nif what we hear from Berlin is true. M. de Valençay also informs me\r\nthat the entertainment given by M. Bresson,[20] at which the King of\r\nPrussia was present, was a very brilliant affair; all the servants\r\nwere in full livery, blue, gold, and red, and Bresson said to him:\r\n\"These are my colours,\" an amusing remark, and one worthy of the\r\npresent time. \"We shall see,\" as M. de Talleyrand says.\r\n\r\n  [20] M. Bresson was the French Minister at Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 1, 1836._--The young French gentlemen who went to\r\nPrague have returned after a very short stay. They were especially\r\nstruck by the atmosphere of boredom which is the environment of life\r\nin that town. They said the Duc de Bordeaux had a very pleasant face,\r\nbut his figure was not attractive and his mind but little developed,\r\nlike that of a child brought up in the midst of old men.\r\n\r\nAt a dinner given on May 22 to the two French Princes by the Crown\r\nPrince of Prussia, Princess Albert,[21] to the great rage of Bresson,\r\nthe great disgust of the King, and the general horror of the company,\r\nappeared with an enormous garland of lilies in her hair; up to that\r\npoint her behaviour had been quite proper.\r\n\r\n  [21] Princess Albert of Prussia was a princess of the Low\r\n  Countries.\r\n\r\nThe presents distributed by the Duc d'Orléans at Berlin were most\r\nexpensive, and in money and diamonds amounted to more than a hundred\r\nthousand francs. It is rather too much than not enough. Prince\r\nWittgenstein received a box containing not only the portrait of the\r\nPrince Royal, but also that of the King and Queen--a very marked\r\nattention. M. Ancillon, plastered with the great Cross of the Legion\r\nof Honour, swelled himself out and strutted about, and appeared ready\r\nto trample upon any one and every one. His behaviour is explained by\r\nhis middle-class origin and his Calvinistic views.\r\n\r\nThe parting was affectionate, some professing to love the Princes as\r\ntheir sons and others as their brothers; in short, no success was ever\r\nmore complete. The ladies were all struck with the handsome appearance\r\nof the Duc d'Orléans. My authorities for these statements are\r\nreliable, as I quote not merely M. de Valençay, but other letters\r\nwhich came in yesterday, written moreover by natives of Berlin. The\r\naccident which nearly befell the Duc d'Orléans at the manœuvres was\r\ncaused by his politeness to the Princesses; he was reining in his\r\nhorse near them, when he was nearly thrown, but the skill with which\r\nhe recovered himself gained him many compliments; and on this question\r\nthe Duchess of Cumberland writes as follows: \"Imagine what would have\r\nbecome of us if any misfortune had happened to him; I should be ready\r\nto leave my sick body upon my bed and be changed into a guardian angel\r\nto hover over them during their stay at Berlin, and thus to answer the\r\nconfidence of your Queen, who begged me in a charming letter to treat\r\nher sons as my own.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the day when our Princes were at home to the Diplomatic Body M.\r\nde Ribeaupierre, the Russian Minister, sent his excuses, alleging a\r\nswollen face. Contrary to the old etiquette of Berlin, the whole of\r\nthe Diplomatic Body was invited to a ball at the house of Prince\r\nWilliam, the King's brother. Of this entertainment I am informed: \"The\r\nball given to the French mission by order of the King, Louis-Philippe,\r\nwas a great success; the French Princes were so tactful as to do the\r\nhonours themselves, and received the King and the Princesses at the\r\nfoot of the staircase.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 2, 1836._--The Princess de Lieven arrived here\r\nyesterday in a feeble state of health. We took her in and looked after\r\nher as well as we could, but towards the evening I began to feel that\r\nshe had some presentiments of a tiresome stay, and that if the journey\r\nhither lay before her at this moment she would hesitate to undertake\r\nit. This I can understand. Here she will have no news and will not be\r\nable to see the shadow-show of life, which are both necessities to\r\nher. The novelty of the outer world, recollections and historical\r\ntraditions, natural beauties, the domestic life of a household,\r\nreading, thought, and work are by no means to her taste, and in other\r\nrespects Valençay has never been more poverty-stricken than at this\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThe verses which M. de Peyronnet has sent to me are not very\r\nexcellent, but that point is of no account in comparison with the\r\nactual circumstance and the whole question. During the winter I\r\nworked pretty hard for these poor people, and obtained some definite\r\nalleviation for M. Peyronnet, who was the worst of all in health, and\r\nthis he found very agreeable; I hope that I may be able to do more for\r\nhim as soon as the session is over. It was this charitable work which\r\ninspired the verses in question.[22]\r\n\r\n  [22] We have been unable to find them.\r\n\r\nMy sister writes to me from Vienna saying that great preparations are\r\nmade to receive the French Princes, and in particular Paul Esterhazy\r\nis working for that purpose; there will be an entertainment at his\r\nhouse at Eisenstadt. Unfortunately many people are in the country and\r\nmany in mourning.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 4, 1836._--We have had two days of bad weather, but\r\nyesterday morning a better prospect fortunately allowed us to take\r\nMadame de Lieven for a drive in the forest and past the warren, the\r\nquarries, &c. In the evening, however, M. de Talleyrand had an attack\r\nof palpitation, which was but slight, though it is evident that the\r\nenemy is still there. Madame de Lieven yawned to desperation. The poor\r\nwoman is bored, which fact I can very well understand and pardon. The\r\ntruth is that, with her frame of mind and habits, she is not likely to\r\nendure our solitude or the dull and quiet atmosphere of the household\r\nwhich is due to the mental and physical state of M. de Talleyrand.\r\nMoreover, the Princess is not an easy guest from a material point of\r\nview; she has twice changed her room, and now wants to go back to the\r\nfirst room she occupied, in which is the bed of Madame de Staël. Lady\r\nHolland could not have given us more trouble, and Pauline says that\r\nthe Princess is \"rather whimsical.\"\r\n\r\nA caricature has appeared in London of Lord Melbourne and Mrs. Norton\r\non the very day of the eclipse; it represents the sun and Mrs. Norton\r\nas the moon passing over it, while beneath is the word \"Eclipse.\" The\r\nreference is to the scandalous law-suit which Mr. Norton is bringing\r\nagainst his wife, and in which Lord Melbourne is unpleasantly\r\ncompromised.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 5, 1836._--The poor Princess de Lieven is greatly\r\nbored, and expresses herself on the subject with strange openness.\r\nYesterday she asked me, as if she were talking to herself, why we had\r\ninvited her at a time when we had no one staying in the house. I began\r\nto laugh, and replied very gently: \"But, dear Princess, you yourself\r\nwere so kind as to ask to come. We would have invited the whole world,\r\nbut the session is not yet finished, so that diplomatists, peers, and\r\nDeputies cannot leave Paris.\" \"That is true,\" she replied, and later\r\non, when she saw that M. de Sercey had just arrived at Paris, she was\r\nfull of regret that she could not be there to ask him questions; she\r\nalso thought her _salon_ would have been very interesting that evening\r\nduring the discussion of the foreign service vote. I like\r\nstraightforward persons, because with them at any rate one knows\r\nexactly where one is.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 10, 1836._--The Princess de Lieven received letters\r\nyesterday from her husband, telling her that she has been represented\r\nin a very bad light to the Emperor Nicholas. Conversations and whole\r\nspeeches have been sent to St. Petersburg as though they emanated from\r\nthe Princess, which are certainly fictitious, for she is very zealous\r\nin her master's service; but those who talk a great deal and see many\r\npeople are always compromised sooner or later. The Princess is greatly\r\nagitated in consequence.\r\n\r\nThe Prince d'Orange is quite obviously showing signs of madness, which\r\ntake the form of such sordid economy that his wife and children have\r\nnot even enough to eat; he keeps the key of the pantry himself, and\r\nthe Princess has to send out her chambermaid to buy cutlets. The\r\neldest son is said to be a young scamp. He is now at London with his\r\nyounger brother, where they are known as the \"unripe Oranges.\" The\r\nDutch are said to be much perturbed about the future of their country,\r\nand are praying that the life of the present King may be prolonged.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 13, 1836._--Yesterday I had a long letter from the\r\nCrown Prince of Prussia, with a kind sentence concerning the French\r\nPrinces and their father, the King, though with a qualification\r\nagainst revolutions which shows his true opinion. It is a curious\r\nletter. I have had another from M. Ancillon in most laudatory terms,\r\nwith no qualification, concerning the travellers, the union, the\r\npeace, and M. de Talleyrand; also a curious letter. Finally I have two\r\nvery long letters from M. de Valençay written from Vienna; he had\r\nstopped at Günthersdorf, of which he gives full details.[23] At Vienna\r\nhe had seen the Count of Clam at the house of his aunt of Sagan, from\r\nwhom he had learnt that the first interview had given great\r\nsatisfaction and that our Princes had said everything that was proper.\r\nThe Archduchess Sophie spoke very kindly of her remembrance of me and\r\ntreated my son very well. He thinks that the Austrian princesses lack\r\nthat grace and distinction which is so striking in the princesses of\r\nthe Prussian royal family. Princess Metternich was at the first\r\nevening reception given by M. and Madame de Sainte-Aulaire; she\r\nbehaved most discreetly, and stayed very late; the Duc d'Orange only\r\ntalked to her for five minutes, and then upon the subject of\r\nhomeopathy! She deserved a small lesson.[24]\r\n\r\n  [23] An estate belonging to the Duchesse de Dino in Silesia.\r\n\r\n  [24] Princess Metternich had used some discourteous terms\r\n  concerning the assumption of the crown by Louis-Philippe in 1830.\r\n\r\nThe great diplomatic reception of the nobility and the garrison seems\r\nto have been superb. M. de Valençay was especially delighted by the\r\nraces at Baden, where he was entertained by the Archduke Charles, who\r\nspoke to him very warmly of M. de Talleyrand. The Archduke received\r\nall the Frenchmen most cordially. They dined with the Archduchess\r\nTheresa, who is described by M. de Valençay as of an agreeable\r\nappearance, with pretty manners, and an attractive face. She is very\r\ndark and small. The Duc d'Orléans was seated near her at dinner, and\r\ntheir conversation was vivacious. Prince Metternich was also there. He\r\nhas been reconciled, at any rate outwardly, with the Archduke.[25] The\r\nlatter has retired to the pretty town of Baden, where he grows\r\nflowers; he told M. de Valençay that, like all old soldiers, he loved\r\nhis garden. The Duc d'Orléans was to dine there again by himself two\r\ndays later. The Archduke adores his daughter, and will leave her free\r\nto choose her own husband; she has refused the Crown Prince of\r\nBavaria, and is to inspect the Kings of Naples and Greece. The Russian\r\nalliance alone causes her father some fears.\r\n\r\n  [25] The Liberal ideas of the Archduke Charles had induced Prince\r\n  Metternich to remove this prince from the Court and to regard him\r\n  with suspicion. They had almost quarrelled.\r\n\r\nM. de Valençay was also delighted with the entertainment at Laxemburg,\r\nand the water-parties, with music everywhere, which reminded him of\r\nVirginia Water. All the society of Vienna was there informally, and\r\nthe scene was correspondingly animated.\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that all this causes ill-feeling at Prague. The\r\nDauphine was speaking to some one who asked her, when she was about to\r\nstart for Vienna, at what time they would have the honour of seeing\r\nher again; she replied that any one who wanted to see her henceforward\r\nwould have to come and fetch her. A Vienna lady, a strong political\r\nopponent of France, said before M. de Valençay, in speaking of our\r\nPrince Royal, that he was so kind and gracious it was to be hoped that\r\nhe was not something else!\r\n\r\nThe travellers are to start on the 11th and make their way to Milan\r\nthrough Verona, devoting ten days to the journey.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Capua and Miss Penelope are at Paris. The former has\r\nseen the Queen; he will go to Rome, and there open negotiations for a\r\nreconciliation with Naples.\r\n\r\nAll the Coburg family and the Belgian King and Queen are coming to\r\nNeuilly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 17, 1836._--It seems that every day must be marked by\r\nsome tribulation. Yesterday evening we had a terrible fright, the\r\nconsequences of which might have been most serious; they seem to have\r\nbeen but slight, though the doctor says that we cannot be certain for\r\nnine days that no internal shock has been sustained. M. de\r\nTalleyrand's mania for staying out late brought him back yesterday in\r\nhis little carriage when it was pitch-dark; moreover, he childishly\r\namused himself by steering a zigzag course, so that he twisted the\r\nfront wheel. This checked his progress, and he could not perceive the\r\ncause in the darkness, so he told the servant to push harder, which he\r\ndid. The result was a violent jolt, which shot him out of the carriage\r\nand threw him head first with his face on the ground upon the gravel\r\nof the Orange Court at the entry of the _donjon_. His face was badly\r\nbruised, but fortunately his nose bled freely; he did not lose\r\nconsciousness, and wished to sit in the drawing-room and play piquet.\r\nAt midnight he put his feet in hot mustard and water, and is now\r\nasleep. But what a terrible nervous shock at his age and with his\r\nweight, and when he is suffering from a malady which demands that he\r\nshould be spared every emotion and disturbance!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 18, 1836._--M. de Talleyrand's face has suffered\r\nconsiderably, but otherwise he seems to have escaped miraculously from\r\nthis remarkable fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 21, 1836._[26]--Do you remember that it was you who\r\nrefused any form of conversation upon the subject of religion? Only\r\nupon one occasion at Rochecotte did you give me any outline of your\r\nideas upon this subject; at that time you were more advanced than\r\nmyself in respect of certain beliefs. My experiences since that date\r\nhave brought me more rapidly along the road, but my starting-point has\r\nbeen my recollection of that conversation, in which I saw that you\r\nadmitted certain fundamental principles of which I was not sure. In\r\nany case, my speculations have not advanced beyond that point, and\r\nonly in points of practice do I attempt to guide my movements by this\r\ncompass; I have never busied myself with dogmas or mysteries, and if I\r\nprefer the Roman Catholic religion I do so because I think it most\r\nuseful to society in general and to States; individual religion is a\r\ndifferent matter, and I think any religion based upon the Gospel is\r\nequally good and divine. Since I have seen all supports falling away\r\naround me, I have felt my own weakness and the necessity of some\r\nsupport and guide; I have sought and found; I have knocked and it has\r\nbeen opened to me; I have asked and it has been given to me; and yet\r\nall very incompletely hitherto, for when one thus walks alone and ill\r\nprepared it is impossible to avoid wrong paths, or to avoid slipping\r\nin the ruts with continual stumbles. Nor would it have been wise to\r\narouse myself to excessive zeal and fervour, which would have prepared\r\na reaction, perhaps fatal; I therefore advance step by step, and when\r\nI consider my progress am humiliated to see how little I have risen; a\r\nlittle more kindness, patience, and self-command is all that I have\r\nacquired. I have the same delight in the things that please me, the\r\nsame repugnance for those that weary me, my dislikes are not extinct\r\nand enmity remains keen, my mental anxiety is often wearing, my\r\nenergies are inconsistent, my speech often too hasty and its\r\nexpression inconsiderate. I have, too, a thousand modes of\r\nself-flattery; I am wounded by blame, and too pleased by approbation,\r\nwhich I sometimes seek and would be ready to arouse at necessity; in\r\nfact, there is no task so long and difficult and none that demands\r\nmore exertion and perseverance than to satisfy one's conscience.\r\n\r\n  [26] Extract from a letter.\r\n\r\nApart from the practical methods which I have felt must be followed as\r\na thread to guide me through the labyrinth, I have also been helped by\r\na great sense of gratitude. One day in England I was suddenly struck\r\nby the thought of the innumerable favours which had been granted to\r\nme, though I had made so ill a use of my powers and my advantages. I\r\nadmire the patience of God and the long-suffering of Providence\r\ntowards me; to have found what I have found seems to me so real a\r\nblessing and so ill-deserved that it has filled me with gratitude.\r\nThis sense has continually increased, and partially supports me in\r\naccomplishing the sacrifices which I am making. The deep instruction\r\nto be daily derived from the old age of M. de Talleyrand; the death of\r\nMarie Suchet;[27] her mother's grief; the successive deaths of so many\r\nof my acquaintances of different ages, sexes, and positions; of the\r\ngranddaughter whose eyes I have closed,[28] and who brought death so\r\nnear to me; the close reading of good books; the lofty conversation\r\nof M. de Royer-Collard, who is ready to throw aside philosophic doubts\r\nand is slowly succeeding--all these influences have made me consider a\r\nthousand matters hitherto unnoticed, and have directed me towards a\r\nlofty and a certain goal. Such is the story of this side of my life.\r\nMy attitude, however, is not that of outward profession, and I can say\r\nthat I am more advanced in reality than in form; in the latter\r\nrespect, I doubt if I shall ever change.\r\n\r\n  [27] Daughter of the Marshal of Albuféra.\r\n\r\n  [28] Yolande de Valençay.\r\n\r\nWhat a long answer this is to one small page of your letter! If it\r\nseems to you too long, say so, and we will reserve all these\r\nrevelations for evenings at Rochecotte.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d'Orléans gives a glowing account of a conversation with\r\nPrince Metternich, by which he was delighted.\r\n\r\nThe Princesse de Lieven has just gone away, to the general relief. I\r\nthink that the Princess and her proud niece[29] came to feel that they\r\nhad been somewhat ridiculous here, as they went to some trouble on\r\ntheir last day to utter innumerable thanks and excuses for the\r\ninconvenience they had caused, &c.\r\n\r\n  [29] The Baroness of Mengden, niece of the Princesse de Lieven,\r\n  afterwards lived at Carlsruhe, where she was abbess of a noble\r\n  chapter. She was very tall, especially in the upper part of her\r\n  body, and any one seated by her side at dinner was obliged to\r\n  raise his head in order to see her face. As she was very\r\n  good-natured, she became to some extent her aunt's drudge; at\r\n  Valençay, when the Princesse de Lieven stayed there, she gave her\r\n  niece her jewel-box to keep when she was out driving, so that the\r\n  Baroness of Mengden could rarely take part in these excursions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 24, 1836._--How stupid ill-nature is! Madame de Lieven\r\nhas been unkind enough to write to Paris groaning and lamenting over\r\nthe profound boredom which she felt here, and her correspondents have\r\nbeen laughing at us or using her words against us; the fact is widely\r\nknown and commented upon. Our friends told us of it with great\r\nindignation. This small ingratitude on the part of Madame de Lieven,\r\nwhich apparently arises on this occasion from want of social\r\nexperience, is real stupidity; in any case, I am not surprised; I\r\nwould have made a bet that it was so; her weariness was too profound\r\nto be concealed, and I clearly saw that the need of revenge was felt\r\nin her correspondence. I do not reproach her for being bored, for\r\nsaying so, or even for writing the fact, but for prolonging her stay\r\nhere under the pretext of illness. She was afraid of travelling alone,\r\nafraid to be isolated at Baden, and dared not stay longer at Paris,\r\nand so she stayed here, to die of inanition and to rouse our\r\nill-feeling. This did not prevent her from weeping like a penitent\r\nwhen she went away; her tears were sincere, for she shed them, not for\r\nus, but for herself, her wandering and lonely life. On that point I am\r\nnot deceived.\r\n\r\nYesterday I had a letter from M. de Valençay from Leoben. They were\r\nvery pleased with Vienna in every respect. However, the Prussian royal\r\nfamily showed to better advantage than the Imperial royal family. The\r\nPrussian princesses were thought more striking for their youth, their\r\nbeauty and good style, and notwithstanding the garland of lilies,\r\nwhich seems to have been the result of a teasing or coquettish\r\nconversation, our Prince Royal and Princess Albert began an obvious\r\nflirtation. The Empress of Austria and the Duchess of Lucca, her\r\nsister, are very beautiful, but in a cold, austere, and imposing\r\nstyle. Our Princes distributed the same presents at Vienna as at\r\nBerlin, but instead of the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour which\r\nwas given to Ancillon, Prince Metternich, who has long possessed all\r\nthe French orders, was given a magnificent service of Sèvres china.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 25, 1836._--M. de Barante[30] writes from St.\r\nPetersburg saying that there is great feeling against Madame de\r\nLieven, on account of her long stay in France. Some ill-temper has\r\nalso been aroused by the successful journey of our Princes, but\r\nnothing of the kind has been shown to our ambassador, who is treated\r\npersonally with great politeness.\r\n\r\n  [30] French Ambassador at St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Mrs. Norton was most angry, in the course of the\r\nstrange trial--of which _Galignani_ gives a far too detailed\r\naccount--because the servants who were called to give evidence said\r\nthat she rouged and dyed her eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 27, 1836._--Another attempt upon the King's life.[31]\r\nWhat a dreadful mania it is, and will it be always futile? Such is the\r\nsad question which one cannot help asking. We know nothing yet beyond\r\nthe news telegraphed to the centres of the neighbouring departments,\r\nwhence the prefects have sent messengers for our information.\r\n\r\n  [31] On the evening of June 25, 1836, a young man aged\r\n  twenty-six, named Louis Alibaud, shot at the king in the court of\r\n  the Tuileries when Louis-Philippe was reviewing the National\r\n  Guard and the drummers were beating a march.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 28, 1836._--Our Princes have been told by letter not\r\nto hasten their return on account of the attempt upon the King's life.\r\nThey should reach Turin to-day, and are expected at Paris on the 8th.\r\nIt seems that Lord Ponsonby[32] has gone mad. He insists upon the\r\ndismissal of Reis Effendi[33] and the chief of the Guard. He has\r\nwritten two notes to the Ottoman Porte in which he even threatens the\r\nOttoman Empire with disruption if satisfaction is refused. Admiral\r\nRoussin himself writes that Lord Ponsonby is mad. All the Ministers,\r\nincluding the Russian Minister, are working to prevent a rupture; the\r\nCourt of Vienna is explaining the matter to the English Government in\r\nLondon, and it is hoped that Lord Ponsonby will be recalled.\r\n\r\n  [32] English Ambassador at Constantinople.\r\n\r\n  [33] Reis Effendi was the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 29, 1836._--Yesterday I had a letter from our\r\ntravellers, dated from Roveredo, where they were detained by the\r\nindisposition of the Duc de Nemours. It was a somewhat serious attack,\r\nof which they made light in their letters to his parents, but which\r\ngreatly frightened the Duc d'Orléans. He was also greatly vexed by the\r\nhurried departure of General Baudrand. It seems that this departure\r\nwas provoked not so much by the necessity of a rapid journey to the\r\nwaters as by some ill-temper at the fact that the Prince Royal did not\r\nshow sufficient confidence in him.\r\n\r\nThe Princes were about to make their way to Florence, as the Grand\r\nDuke of Tuscany had been especially pertinacious in asking for a\r\nvisit, but the illness of the Duc de Nemours stopped their journey.\r\nThey have met the Archduchess Marie Louise,[34] cousin-german of our\r\nPrince Royal. She asked M. de Valençay for news of us, as she is his\r\ngodmother. He thought she was not so aged as she has been described.\r\nThey have also seen the Princess of Salerno and the King of Naples.\r\nThe latter is described as having a fine head, but a coarse and clumsy\r\nfigure. He is in despair at the death of his wife, with whom he lived\r\non very bad terms until she was with child, in giving birth to whom\r\nshe died. He is said to be very whimsical.\r\n\r\n  [34] The widow of Napoleon I.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Paris was at Neuilly at eleven o'clock on the day\r\nwhen the King's life was attempted. It is unfortunate that he can\r\nnever appear before the King except immediately after an attempt at\r\nassassination, and I therefore think that his visits are not very\r\npopular, as they are made under conditions with which one would\r\nreadily dispense. He refused to admit the body of Sieyès to the\r\nchurch, and it was taken straight to the cemetery.[35]\r\n\r\n  [35] Sieyès died at Paris, June 28, 1836.\r\n\r\nMy deepest grief concerning the attempted assassination of the 25th is\r\nthat I fear the pistol-shot has killed our Princess Royal. Many say\r\nthat Alibaud is another Louvel, an isolated fanatic, a natural product\r\nof newspaper extravagances and bad teaching. The King wishes to pardon\r\nthe assassin, but it is thought that the Cabinet will not suffer him\r\nto do so. General Fagel[36] has been at Neuilly, notwithstanding the\r\npresence of the Belgian King and Queen; the King treated him very\r\nkindly.\r\n\r\n  [36] General Fagel had been the ambassador of the King of the Low\r\n  Countries in France under the Restoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, July 5, 1836._--My chambermaid's serious illness forces me\r\nto wait upon myself. I have felt a little awkward, but shall get used\r\nto it. It is not always pleasant, but it is useful, and I do not\r\ncomplain. I have, indeed, my moments of discouragement, but then I\r\nchide myself and it passes away. At times great nervous fatigue\r\nresults from want of practice, but this will disappear, for we are not\r\nupon earth to amuse ourselves, or to rest, or to be well and happy and\r\ncomfortable; that is our chief illusion; we mistake our object, and\r\nare then angry that we do not attain it; if we tell ourselves that the\r\nobject of life is work, struggle, and sacrifice we avoid\r\nmisunderstandings and escape the most painful of fates.\r\n\r\nThe examination of Alibaud will not be printed; so much the better, as\r\nall this is bad food for public curiosity. Yesterday I had a letter\r\nfrom the Duc de Noailles, who is one of the judges; he told me that\r\nthe crime was obviously prompted by want. As the man had not a\r\nhalfpenny he wished to kill himself, but he thought his death should\r\nbe made interesting and useful. Such is the influence of bad teaching\r\nderived from the republican age and society in which he has lived. He\r\nis not a gloomy fanatic like Louvel, nor a modern Erostratus like\r\nFieschi, but is merely a beggar of considerable self-possession and\r\nbadly brought up.\r\n\r\nAll the newspapers, Carlist, Radical, and Moderate, are greatly vexed\r\nby the mandate of the Archbishop of Paris. To appear at Neuilly is too\r\nmuch for some; unwillingness to use the term \"the King\" in the mandate\r\nis a platitude which does not deceive others and irritates many; the\r\nJesuitical and equivocal phrase at the end is thought very pitiable.\r\nIn short, the outcry is general and deserved. I am sorry, for at\r\nbottom he is a man not without good qualities, but with a deplorable\r\nwant of tact.\r\n\r\nI have a letter from M. de Valençay written from Milan; the horseraces\r\nin the arena, where twenty-five thousand people collected, and the\r\nillumination of the theatre of La Scala were admirable.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor of Valençay came to consult M. de Talleyrand about an\r\naddress to be presented to the King concerning the last attempt upon\r\nhis life, and begged M. de Talleyrand to draw it up. He commissioned\r\nme with the task. Here it is, as it has been passed and as it was sent\r\nto Paris yesterday. To fall from diplomatic to municipal language is a\r\ngreat proof of decadence. That at any rate is what little Fontanes of\r\nBerry has produced, and of all the addresses drawn up on this occasion\r\nit is undoubtedly the most monarchical both in form and substance.\r\n\r\n   /* \"With the confidence of children, the respect of subjects, and\r\n   the gratitude of the friends of true liberty, the inhabitants of\r\n   Valençay venture to place at the foot of the Throne the\r\n   expression of their delight at the miraculous preservation of the\r\n   sacred person of the King and their wishes for the permanent\r\n   happiness of the Royal Family. Insignificant and remote as is the\r\n   quarter of your realm whence these loving hearts yearn towards\r\n   your Majesty, your goodness is our guarantee that our token of\r\n   respect will be indulgently received. Our town, moreover, is not\r\n   without its claims upon the interest of the King, and the claim\r\n   which we are most pleased to assert is the honour which we have\r\n   had in receiving His Royal Highness Monseigneur the Duc\r\n   d'Orléans, and the recollection of the kindness which he has\r\n   shown amongst us,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThen follow the signatures of the Municipal Council, including that of\r\nM. de Talleyrand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, July 10, 1836._--My son, Valençay, arrived yesterday; he\r\ntold us nothing new about his travels, and only confirmed his previous\r\nletters. We have also the Prince de Laval, by whom M. de Talleyrand is\r\nwearied to death, and with good reason. At Paris the Prince is\r\ntolerable, and sometimes even amusing, but in the country his want of\r\njudgment and his snobbishness, which induces him to say, for instance,\r\nthat the orange-tree, pruned, clipped short, and planted in a box, is\r\nthe aristocracy of nature, his continual practice of asking questions,\r\nof stammering and spitting before one's face, and always looking on\r\nthe insignificant side of things, are most wearing; and he does not\r\nsay a word of his departure.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d'Orléans writes to say that only for reasons of state would\r\nhe be sorry not to marry the daughter of the Archduke Charles, for her\r\nattractions for him are entirely moral; in person he thinks her, if\r\nnot ugly, yet insignificant, and he is not attracted. In any case, the\r\nfather and daughter readily assent to the proposal of marriage; the\r\nEmperor of Austria says nothing; but his brother the Archduke Francis\r\nCharles and his sister-in-law the Archduchess Sophie say \"No.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, July 13, 1836._--Yesterday evening we had a visit from the\r\nDuc Decazes[37] and the Comte de la Villegontier, who stopped for tea\r\non their way to their foundry at Aveyron. M. Decazes was sad and\r\nsorrowful concerning the King's dangers and the open sores in society,\r\nas revealed by the trial of Alibaud. He also complains, and with\r\nreason, of the organisation, or rather the non-organisation, of the\r\npolice. He says that the King alone has preserved his calm and\r\npresence of mind, but that around him all are sad, anxious, and\r\nagitated, and that the Queen and Madame are very unhappy. Marshal\r\nLobau has persuaded the King that the National Guard would take it ill\r\nif his Majesty did not review them on the 28th of this month. He will\r\ntherefore pass under the Arc de Triomphe de l'Etoile, where the\r\nNational Guard will march before him. But this is too much. The July\r\nfestivals will be confined to the opening of the Arc de Triomphe, and\r\nthe Obelisk from Luxor will be unveiled. No further commemoration\r\nwould be required, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n  [37] M. Decazes then acted as chief referendary to the Chamber of\r\n  Peers.\r\n\r\nAlibaud yielded to the exhortations of the Abbé Grivel. He confessed,\r\nand therefore has repented. On the scaffold he kissed the crucifix\r\nbefore the people, but when one of the servants took away his black\r\nveil he flew into a rage and turned suddenly round to the multitude,\r\nred in the face, crying, \"I die for my country and for liberty,\" and\r\nthen he submitted.\r\n\r\nM. Decazes also told us that every day brought him anonymous letters,\r\ndenunciations, and revelations, and that it was impossible to get a\r\nmoment's peace. He left me in profound sadness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, July 16, 1836._--The Prince de Laval, who is still here,\r\nadmiring everything and evidently well pleased in spite of our\r\npolitical differences, has a certain form of wit which consists in\r\nsaying smart and clever remarks now and then, but these are wanting in\r\ntaste and balance. His class snobbishness recalls that of M.\r\nSaint-Simon, his caste prejudice is carried to a ridiculous point, his\r\ncuriosity and gossip are unexampled, and his selfishness and\r\nabsorption in his own importance and amusement are inconceivable; he\r\nadvances every claim on his own behalf, and is therefore unbearable\r\nwhen taken seriously. Taken the other way, there is something to be\r\ngot out of him, the more so as, though he is a tease, he is not\r\nill-tempered, and the very extravagance of his poses forces him to\r\nlive up to them.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Noailles, whom we also expect here to-day, is very\r\ndifferent; he is reasonable, self-possessed, cold, polite, and\r\nreserved, asking no questions, never chattering nor wearying anybody;\r\nbut though he is unpretentious his claims to consideration are none\r\nthe less real, and he is absorbed, first of all by his position as a\r\ngreat lord, and then as a politician. His position as a man of fashion\r\nand fortune, of which Adrien de Laval boasts his past possession, as\r\nthey are now gone, has no attraction for him. I might even say that if\r\nM. de Laval is a quondam young man, the Duc de Noailles is an old man\r\nbefore his time. He is only thirty-four or thirty-five, but his face,\r\nhis manners, and his life in general make him appear fifty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, July 27, 1836._--I think more and more of the Duc de Noailles.\r\nHe is a man of good judgment, sound taste, with a sense of honour and\r\nexcellent manners. He is also dignified and possessed of common sense,\r\nwhile his goodwill is valuable, and his high position may be useful in\r\nthe world in which he is a figure. But my high opinion of his good\r\nqualities and the value which I set upon his goodwill and friendship\r\ndo not prevent me from seeing his pretentiousness. His chief ambition\r\nis political, and is not, perhaps, sufficiently supported by the ease\r\nof temperament which is quite indispensable at the present time. The\r\nwhole family has remained what it was two hundred years ago. The\r\nNoailles are rather illustrious than ancient, rather courtiers than\r\nservants, but servants rather than favourites, intriguers rather than\r\nambitious, society people rather than lords, snobs rather than\r\naristocrats, and above all and before all, Noailles. I know the whole\r\nof the family existing at the present time; the best and most capable\r\nof them is undoubtedly the Duc, whom I judge perhaps somewhat\r\nseverely, but for whom I have always a real esteem.\r\n\r\nI left Valençay the day before yesterday at six o'clock in the\r\nmorning; my dear Pauline was very sad at being left behind; I slept at\r\nJeurs with the Mollien family, reaching their house at eight o'clock\r\nin the evening, and arrived here in pretty good time. I found M. de\r\nTalleyrand in fairly good health, but much disturbed by the state of\r\naffairs. The King will not be present at to-morrow's review, and has\r\ngiven it up because of a discovery that fifty-six young people have\r\nsworn to kill him. As it was impossible to arrest these fifty-six, it\r\nhas been thought more advisable to abandon the review. In what times\r\nwe live!\r\n\r\nThe death of Carrel[38] has also thrown a gloom over us. He made many\r\nmistakes, but his mind was distinguished and his talent remarkable.\r\nEven M. de Chateaubriand, the author of the \"Génie du Christianisme,\"\r\nwept as he walked in the funeral procession of the man who refused to\r\nsee a priest and forbade the holding of any Church ceremony at his\r\nfuneral. The desire to produce an effect usually ends in some loss of\r\ntaste and propriety in the most essential details.\r\n\r\n  [38] A violent newspaper quarrel brought about a meeting between\r\n  Armand Carrel, editor of _Le National_, and Emile de Girardin,\r\n  editor of _La Presse_. A pistol duel took place on July 28 in the\r\n  wood of Vincennes. Armand Carrel was severely wounded in the\r\n  stomach, and died the next day, after expressing a definite wish\r\n  for burial in a cemetery without any Church service.\r\n\r\nAffairs in Spain are going very badly. The supporters of intervention\r\nare growing active, and many of them are influential and leading\r\nspirits, but the supreme will is in active opposition to them.\r\n\r\nDuring my journey yesterday I was in very good company, with Cardinal\r\nde Retz, whose memoirs I have taken up again; I had not read them for\r\nmany years, and then at an age when one is more attracted by the facts\r\nand the anecdotes than by the style or reflections. The style is\r\nlively, original, strong, and graceful, while the reflections are\r\nthoughtful, judicious, elevating, striking, and abundant. What a\r\ndelightful book, and what insight, and often more than insight, in\r\njudgment, if not in action! He was a political La Bruyère.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, July 28, 1836._--Yesterday the Duc d'Orléans came to see me.\r\nHe is in very bad health and somewhat melancholy; he too is obliged\r\nto take an infinite number of precautions which sadden his life. The\r\nKing had resolved to go to the review, but was at the same time so\r\nconvinced that he would be killed that he made his will, and gave full\r\norders and directions to his son concerning his accession to the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the morning I also had a call from M. Thiers, who was\r\nvery pleased with the news he had just received from Africa, with the\r\npolitical situation at home and abroad, and, in short, with\r\neverything, apart from the great and continual dangers which threaten\r\nthe King's life. There were to have been several attempts upon the\r\nKing's life on the day of the review; these attempts were to be\r\norganised separately and without connection. One was to be delivered\r\nby a group of men disguised as National Guards, who were to fire a\r\nvolley of twenty shots at the King as he passed, one of which would\r\ncertainly have found its mark. Two of the young men who have been\r\narrested--and the arrests amount to more than a hundred--have already\r\nmade important confessions. Yesterday morning a man was arrested in\r\nwhose house was found a machine like Fieschi's, but more perfect and\r\nsmaller in compass, with more accuracy and certainty in its working.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, July 29, 1836._--Yesterday evening I was with the Queen. She\r\nseemed quite natural in manner, though she said very bitterly: \"We can\r\ntestify to ourselves that we are entirely upright, and yet we are\r\nforced to live amid terrors and with the precautions of tyrants.\"\r\nMadame Adélaïde urges her not to sadden the King's temper. He was with\r\nhis Ministers, and did not come in till later. His manner was quite\r\nordinary, but his features bear the mark of gloomy thoughts; the\r\ngreatest vexation he ever experienced in his life was his inability to\r\ngo to the review. Moreover, he thinks that his days are numbered, for\r\nthe day before yesterday, when taking leave of the Queen of the\r\nBelgians, who was returning to Brussels, he told her that he would not\r\nsee her again. The young queen was in ill-health, and nothing was more\r\nheartrending than their farewells. Poor people!\r\n\r\nA remarkable fact which is vouched for by all the officers of the\r\nlegions of the National Guard is that during the last fortnight a\r\nnumber of unknown or notorious people, such as Bastide, and others,\r\nhave put down their names on the rotas of the National Guard and take\r\nsentry duty; this was in order that they might find a place in the\r\nranks which were to march before the King upon the day of the review.\r\n\r\nNothing sadder can be conceived than the Tuileries. I stayed there two\r\nhours with an inexpressible sinking of heart, a melancholy and an\r\ninclination to weep which I could hardly restrain, especially when I\r\nsaw the King. I shall start early to-morrow morning for Valençay.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chartres, July 31, 1836._--I left Paris yesterday, but much later\r\nthan I intended, as the Duc d'Orléans sent word that he wished to\r\nspeak with me again. I cannot say how much I have been touched by his\r\nperfect kindness to me. He came to see me every day, and showed that\r\nhe counted me as his best friend--and he is certainly not mistaken. He\r\nhas made remarkable progress in every respect, and if heaven preserves\r\nhim to us I am sure that his reign will be brilliant. I hope that a\r\ngood marriage will clear our political horizon, which is very dark.\r\n\r\nWhat is his marriage to be? That question will be decided next week,\r\nfor I think that he certainly will marry; circumstances make it\r\nentirely necessary to consolidate and strengthen that which crime\r\nthreatens and attacks daily, and a continuation of the line becomes\r\neven more important than the greatness of the alliance. The latter,\r\nhowever, is not to be despised. Search is made, but if no success\r\nresults the only object will be to find a wife who can bear fine\r\nchildren, without any idea of a morganatic marriage, which is not\r\nrequired for many sound reasons, any more than a marriage with any\r\nmember of the Bonaparte family. Religion is a matter of no\r\nconsequence. It is absolutely necessary to deliver Paris from the\r\nmournful condition into which it has fallen. I know the French, and if\r\nthey are shown a young and engaging bride they will be delighted,\r\nwhile the foreign political world will perhaps be more considerate to\r\nus when it has no further matrimonial snare to spread before us.\r\n\r\nYesterday I stayed a few minutes at Versailles with Madame de Balbi,\r\nand a few minutes more at Maintenon, with the Duchesse de Noailles. I\r\nam now starting for Châteaudun, and shall go on from thence to\r\nMontigny, where I have promised to visit the Prince de Laval.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Montigny, August 1, 1836._--I left Chartres after hearing mass in the\r\ncathedral, which, as far as I could see, has not suffered from the\r\nfire.[39] The wood- and lead-work have gone, but as the vaulting\r\nwithin, which was made of stone, has not suffered, nothing is to be\r\nseen from within the church. The work of repair is now in progress.\r\n\r\n  [39] In the month of June 1836 a conflagration, supposed to be\r\n  caused by the carelessness of some plumbers, completely destroyed\r\n  the chestnut beam-work of the cathedral, which was the admiration\r\n  of visitors and was known as \"the Forest.\" A great number of old\r\n  windows were broken or melted, and the bells were seriously\r\n  damaged. For several hours the fire threatened to spread to the\r\n  whole of the lower town. The important work of repair lasted for\r\n  several years.\r\n\r\nI stopped at Châteaudun in order to go over the whole of the old\r\ncastle, including the kitchens and the dungeons. Though greatly\r\nruined, some beauties yet remain, and the view is splendid. The Prince\r\nde Laval came to meet me, and brought me here in his carriage. He is\r\nmaking a charming spot here, arranged with good taste, care, and\r\nmagnificence. The situation is beautiful, and the Gothic part of the\r\ncastle has been well preserved and carefully restored. The castle\r\nwould give a very good idea of the owner to anybody who did not know\r\nhim. I must admit my astonishment at the fact that the spot could have\r\nbeen arranged as it was by Adrien de Laval; the truth is that he has\r\nan excellent architect; and then the Baron de Montmorency has arranged\r\nthe court, and has had several consultations with me concerning the\r\narrangement of the rooms, for this is not my first visit. In short, it\r\nis charming, and though things are much better at Rochecotte, there\r\nare some here which outrival ours. In respect of size and proportion\r\nthe two places can be well compared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 2, 1836._--I have now returned to my lair, and am\r\ndelighted to be far from the uproar of Paris, but I should like time\r\nfor a good rest, whereas M. de Talleyrand has also just come with\r\npeople who are to surround us from to-day. If I could choose a coat\r\nof arms which really meant something I should prefer a stag at bay\r\nwith the dogs around him.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to be more hospitable than M. de Laval has been, and\r\nI am slightly ashamed of the small ingratitude of which I may be\r\nguilty in relating one of the most ridiculous affairs which I know.\r\nAdrien possesses the order of the Holy Ghost, which is no longer worn;\r\nhe had several medallions, and will any one guess what he has done\r\nwith them? He has had them sewn on the middle of one of the velvet\r\ncounterpanes which cover the chief beds in the castle. I was never\r\nmore surprised than to wake up in the morning and find a large\r\ninscription of the Holy Ghost across my figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 6, 1836._--I have a letter from M. de\r\nSainte-Aulaire, dated July 22, from Vienna, which begins as follows:\r\n\"I am now writing to you, as this letter will be taken by a courier\r\nwho will start in two days and tell the Ministry I really do not know\r\nwhat. The attempted assassination by Alibaud has evoked unexpected\r\nmanifestations of interest for the King here, and wishes no less\r\nsincere for his accomplishment of the great work with which Providence\r\nhas entrusted him; but we need not be surprised that this incident has\r\nalso increased the terror which is felt or which people seek to rouse\r\nconcerning the condition of Paris. 'Everything comes to him who\r\nwaits.' On this condition I would have answered for his success, but\r\nit is one of the cases where people will not wait, and possibly with\r\nreason.\" This letter from M. de Sainte-Aulaire must have come by the\r\ncourier who brought the important answer concerning the proposed\r\nmarriage between the Duc d'Orléans and the Archduchess Theresa; hence\r\nthis answer must have arrived at Paris, and I am the more inclined to\r\nthink that it has been received, as Madame Adélaïde informs M. de\r\nTalleyrand that her nephew will write to him personally upon his own\r\naffairs. It is from no curiosity, but with a keen desire to see the\r\nfate of the young Prince happily settled, that I impatiently await his\r\nletters. I should also like to see the King of Naples make one of our\r\nprincesses his queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 7, 1836._--By way of continuing the quotation which\r\nI gave yesterday from M. de Sainte-Aulaire's letter, I will say that\r\nthe reply has been received and that it has been unfavourable. I am\r\nsorry, for our sakes, but if it is a setback to our Prince Royal I\r\nregard it as possibly a political error on the part of those who have\r\ndeclined. Their repentance may yet be speedy, for the incident may\r\nchange the appearance of the world and bring once more into opposition\r\nthe two forces which were inclined to amalgamate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 9, 1836._--Yesterday at lunch-time we saw our\r\ncousins arrive, the Prince de Chalais and his brother.[40] The former,\r\nin my opinion, has the most charming face that I know, a fine figure\r\nand noble manners. I talked a great deal with him, as he did not leave\r\nuntil after dinner. He has sound sense, simplicity of mind,\r\nuprightness of heart, curiosity upon useful matters, and a sensible\r\nand reasonable interest in everything that can strengthen the fine\r\nposition of a great landowner.\r\n\r\n  [40] The Comte Paul de Périgord.\r\n\r\nI am informed that the decree which is to liberate the prisoners of\r\nHam has been signed. I am truly pleased to hear it, as I have worked\r\nhard to secure it. They are not given full liberty, but a change of\r\nresidence with some relaxations preparatory to full freedom, which\r\nwill allow them to recover their shattered health more readily and\r\nunder better conditions.\r\n\r\nEvery one is well pleased at Neuilly with the King of Naples. Our King\r\nhas been much worried by people who would like him to intervene beyond\r\nthe Pyrenees, against his wish, but hitherto he resists vigorously.\r\nThis mental anxiety, together with the precautions which people wish\r\nto impose upon him to secure his safety, is poisoning his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 11, 1836._--M. de Talleyrand is informed that the\r\nSpanish problems, which are growing more and more acute, are causing\r\nbitterness at Paris, where nothing of the kind should exist--namely,\r\nbetween the King and his Minister of Foreign Affairs,[41] who is\r\nsupported by the Prince Royal, as these two men are anxious for\r\nintervention. We may wonder who will emerge victorious from this\r\ndomestic struggle.\r\n\r\n  [41] M. Thiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 22, 1836._--I can well understand the reflections\r\nmade concerning the Grand Duchess Stephanie of Baden; her want of tact\r\nis due to her early education. She was brought up in a pretentious\r\nboarding-school,[42] where she learnt much except that exquisite sense\r\nof propriety which may be transmitted hereditarily or implanted in\r\nyouth but can never be taught. For instance, she asked M. Berryer to a\r\nball at her house, though he had not been introduced and had not asked\r\nfor an introduction. Then she talks too much, as a rule, and attempts\r\nto bring herself into notice by conversational brilliancies which are\r\nnot always properly calculated or adapted to her position. Princesses\r\nare not obliged to be kind; they must, however, be obliging and\r\ndignified; but to understand the limits of propriety and not to go\r\nbeyond them they must have acquired certain habits from infancy; here\r\nthe Grand Duchess Stephanie was wanting, and Madame Campan has not\r\nbeen able to amend the defect. I believe her to be at bottom an\r\nexcellent person. Her life shows devotion and courage in the\r\nmisfortunes through which she has passed with great credit. I think\r\nthat Madame de Lieven, who criticises her so severely, would not\r\nemerge so unscathed from the crises caused by her difficult position\r\nwith respect to her husband. The Grand Duchess had a nice manner and a\r\npretty, alert, and graceful bearing; she needed youth, and as she lost\r\nyouth her defects became more obvious. This, unfortunately, is every\r\none's case, and for that reason it is wrong to say that people are too\r\nold to amend; on the contrary, when charm passes away it is most\r\nessential to replace it by capacity; charm of youth calls forth\r\nindulgence and provides excuses which disappear with those charms and\r\ngraces, and are replaced by a severity of judgment which can only be\r\nopposed by more self-control, more self-renunciation, and more\r\nself-respect.\r\n\r\n  [42] The institution of the famous Madame Campan, now the school\r\n  of Ecouen.\r\n\r\nWe are officially informed that the refusal from Vienna was expressed\r\nin polite terms, but no reason was given. The possibilities of\r\nPrincess Sophia of Würtemburg have not been considered, in spite of\r\nwhat people say. Our Prince Royal has started for the country,\r\nsomewhat thin and changed, but entirely convalescent.\r\n\r\nFrom Madrid we hear that Isturitz has resigned. Calatrava takes his\r\nplace as President of the Council. Everything is going very badly.\r\n\r\nThe King of Naples starts for Toulon on the 24th, and goes, as he\r\ncame, unmarried.\r\n\r\nThe ex-Ministers are still prisoners at Ham, in consequence of\r\ndifficulties which have arisen among the Ministers in power. The\r\nMinister of the Interior wishes to keep the prisoners under his\r\nsupervision, and the President of the Council wishes them to remain in\r\nthe fortresses, under the milder regulations, but in military\r\nstrongholds; but so long as they are there, the Minister of War claims\r\nsupervision over them. It is quite time that this treatment came to an\r\nend, for the unhappy people are ill.\r\n\r\nMadame Murat has obtained permission to spend a month at Paris. She\r\nwill arrive in a week, and is said to be taking no part in her\r\nbrother's intrigues.\r\n\r\nYesterday I had a letter from Madame de Lieven, who announces her\r\nreturn to Paris as a positive fact. I am afraid she may be making a\r\ngreat mistake. Yesterday I had a letter from St. Petersburg in which\r\nshe is said to be in very bad odour at Court. On the other hand, M. de\r\nLöwe-Weimar is very well treated at Court, and poses as an aristocrat.\r\nHorace Vernet is also spoiled and petted in a most inconceivable\r\nmanner. Why, in view of that, should Madame de Lieven be thus\r\nharassed? Can it be that she is suspected of being something of an\r\nintriguer? The English are certainly right to include the capacity of\r\nkeeping quiet among a person's best qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 24, 1836._--I have a comical and unexpected piece of\r\nnews to the effect that M. Berryer has been playing in a vaudeville at\r\nBaden with Madame de Rossi. This must be a strange occupation for a\r\npolitician, but it is better for him than bad company in Switzerland.\r\nYesterday the newspapers announced the death of M. de Rayneval[43] at\r\nMadrid. This will increase the difficulty of a question which is\r\ncomplicated enough already.\r\n\r\n  [43] French Ambassador in Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 27, 1836._--We have no details from Paris, but\r\nobviously some Cabinet crisis is in preparation. Meanwhile M. Thiers\r\nseems to have been anxious to involve the King in the Spanish\r\ndifficulty against his wish, and to have acted for that purpose\r\nwithout consulting his colleagues. The result has been a considerable\r\namount of ill-feeling which is difficult to quell, and should lead in\r\na few days either to the submission of Thiers to the King or to the\r\nformation of a new Ministry, which, however, would contain some\r\nmembers of the present Cabinet, and in particular, I think, M. de\r\nMontalivet. All this is a matter of speculation, for we know nothing\r\ndefinite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 28, 1836._--A letter from Madame Adélaïde yesterday\r\ninformed M. de Talleyrand as follows: \"The Ministry is dissolved, to\r\nmy profound regret. I am especially sorry for Thiers, but he was\r\nobstinate upon the question of intervention in Spain, and this has\r\nspoiled everything. The King wished to disband the new body that was\r\nformed at Bayonne, and demanded a formal undertaking that there should\r\nbe no question of intervention hereafter; Thiers refused, and\r\nresigned. Any Ministerial crisis at this moment is very vexatious, for\r\nwe have so small a circle from which we can choose. The King has sent\r\nfor M. Molé, but he was in the country. He will require time to come,\r\nand no doubt he will ask for Guizot. It is all very distressing, and\r\nwe know by experience how long and difficult is the task of forming a\r\nnew Cabinet. Pity me, for I am heartbroken!\" Such was the position of\r\naffairs the day before yesterday in the immediate neighbourhood of the\r\ncrisis. I am very sorry it should have occurred, in the first place\r\nbecause I have a real interest in Thiers, and because I regret that\r\nhis revolutionary instincts should have overcome his devotion, his\r\ngratitude, and the recognition which he owed to the great wisdom, the\r\nprudence, and the long experience of the King. Moreover, constant\r\nchanges of Ministry are Governmental misfortunes and shake public\r\nopinion too frequently; besides, Thiers' dexterity, alertness, and\r\npromptitude, apart from his energy and his intellect, are useful to\r\nthe State. What use will he make of these powers when he has full\r\nliberty of action? Madame Adélaïde, as the extract from her letter\r\nshows, has no great love for the Doctrinaires, but it is inconceivable\r\nthat M. de Broglie should be recalled, with whom M. Guizot considers\r\nthat he has settled accounts for ever. Apart from these disadvantages,\r\nI think it is obviously beneficial for the King to have given a fresh\r\nproof that on questions of real importance he cannot be shaken and\r\nwill not be driven into action against his wish. Thus in February he\r\nresisted the arrogance of the Doctrinaires, and has now overthrown the\r\ninfatuation of Thiers. This seems to be a fair warning for the future\r\nMinistry, whatever its political colouring, and an excellent guarantee\r\nto all right-thinking men in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 29, 1836._--M. de Talleyrand ought to regard the\r\naccidents that happen to him without disastrous results as a guarantee\r\nthat his life is certainly assured, and in my place I think that this\r\nwarning would rather turn my thoughts upon what they portend and\r\ninduce me to thank God for the respite granted to lighten our burden\r\nof responsibility. Sometimes he reflects upon death, but not often.\r\nYesterday evening there was a violent storm which threatened the\r\nCastle. After a loud clap of thunder he asked me what I had been\r\nthinking of at that moment, and I immediately replied: \"If a priest\r\nhad been in the room I should have confessed myself, for I am afraid\r\nof sudden death. To die unprepared and to carry with me my heavy\r\nburden of sin is a terrifying prospect, and however careful one may be\r\nto live well we cannot do without reconciliation and pardon.\" M.\r\nCogny, our doctor, who was there, and who is terribly afraid of\r\nthunderstorms, added somewhat foolishly that he was performing an act\r\nof contrition at every flash. M. de Talleyrand said nothing at all,\r\nand we went on playing piquet. I take every opportunity of\r\nstrengthening my belief, and thus attempting to arouse his, but never\r\nuntil I have an opening. In such a matter a light touch is\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nYesterday I had a long, interesting letter from the Duc d'Orléans, and\r\na letter which I think the more satisfactory as he has returned to\r\nmore reasonable opinions upon the Spanish question. His opinion of the\r\nMinisterial crisis corresponds entirely with my own. I have also a\r\nletter from M. Guizot written from Broglie on August 24. When writing\r\nhe had no news of the resignation of Thiers, which took place on the\r\n25th. He informs me that he has just bought a small estate near\r\nLisieux and is going to turn farmer.[44] I presume that I shall next\r\nhear that he has left the plough to resume the pen and speechifying.\r\n\r\n  [44] This estate was the Val Richer, where M. Guizot lived until\r\n  his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 1, 1836._--I am strongly inclined to accede\r\nentirely to the opinion concerning the Emperor Nicholas which states\r\nthat the only royal quality in his possession is personal courage. His\r\nchief deficiency seems to me to be that of intelligence, not only in\r\nconversation and judgment, but in general.\r\n\r\nM. de Montessuy, who accompanied M. de Barante to an entertainment at\r\nPeterhof and passed the night there, writes that he saw the Empress at\r\na distance in the gardens and respectfully withdrew, but that in the\r\nevening she reproached him for so doing, saying that she had come down\r\nin order to speak to him and that it was wrong of him to avoid her.\r\nAll this story seems to me to be very unlikely.\r\n\r\nMadame Adélaïde writes to M. de Talleyrand on August 30 that nothing\r\nhas yet been done with regard to the Ministry. M. Molé has opened\r\ncommunications with MM. Guizot and Duchâtel, both of whom have arrived\r\nat Paris, but unanimity between them is rendered difficult by their\r\nrespective sense of dignity. The King and Madame seem greatly to\r\nregret their forced separation from the retiring Ministers and the\r\nnecessity of calling in others.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 3, 1836._--Yesterday I learned a piece of news\r\nwhich is causing me much anxiety and is likely to involve me in\r\nembarrassment: the death of my man of business in Germany, Herr\r\nHennenberg, who died at Berlin on August 23. I am thus obliged to\r\nreplace a most upright and capable man, a strong and respected\r\ncharacter who had full knowledge for twenty-five years not only of my\r\nbusiness, but of all my intimacies, past and present, who has thrown\r\nhimself heartily into every interest of my life and performed immense\r\nservices, and, in spite of the many pecuniary shocks which I have\r\nexperienced, has restored my fortunes and brought them to visible\r\nprosperity, often to my own astonishment. He was, in short, a man to\r\nwhom I had entirely handed over the control of my affairs, as, indeed,\r\nwas necessary, in view of the long distance which separates me from\r\nthe centre of my interests. Such a man cannot be replaced by\r\ncorrespondence or blindly, nor can I remain in uncertainty and\r\nunsettlement for any length of time without suffering incalculable\r\nloss. Hence a journey to Germany seems an absolute necessity; but, on\r\nthe other hand, how can I leave M. de Talleyrand alone in view of the\r\npresent state of his health? It is not to be thought of, and I pray\r\nthat Providence may deliver me from this inextricable complication.\r\n\r\nLetters from Paris say that attempts to form a Ministry are so many\r\nsuccessive failures, that the King is growing tired of it, and that\r\nThiers is beginning to say that Spain is past all remedy. Perhaps they\r\nwill end in patching the matter up, but the shock that each party has\r\nreceived will weaken their harmony, apart from the paralysing sense of\r\nmistrust and rancour which will remain. It is all very sad.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 4, 1836._--We have letters daily from Paris, but\r\nno word regarding any solution of the difficulty. Yesterday I thought\r\nthe breach might be healed; I am less inclined to think so to-day. It\r\nis even possible that the journey to Fontainebleau may take place\r\nbefore the reconstruction of the Cabinet. M. Thiers would like to\r\nstart for Italy, to which the King has replied that his resignation\r\nwill be accepted only when he has nominated a successor. Molé and\r\nGuizot are possibilities which seem to be exhausted without result.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 7, 1836._--We are told that the _Moniteur_ of\r\nto-day will contain the names of a Guizot-Molé Ministry, recruited\r\nentirely from among the Doctrinaires under the influence and by the\r\nefforts of M. Guizot. I had a letter from M. Thiers yesterday, and am\r\nsorry to see some ill-temper displayed against all who do not share\r\nhis ideas about that wretched Spanish question. In particular he\r\nthinks that the signatories to the Quadruple Alliance should have\r\nagreed with him. This remark is addressed to M. de Talleyrand, who\r\nproposes to reply that a fresh reading of the treaty will show that it\r\nwas drawn up in such a way that France is not under obligation in any\r\ndirection. M. Guizot persisted in objecting to the retention of M. de\r\nMontalivet as Minister of the Interior, and as the latter thought it\r\ninconsistent with his dignity to leave this post for another, as\r\nGuizot had proposed, he has resigned, to the King's great regret, and\r\nwill go to Berry, where he has property. Sauzet and d'Argout are said\r\nto be going to Italy, once the refuge of dethroned Sovereigns and now\r\nthe inevitable touringground of ex-Ministers.\r\n\r\nThe following fact is certain: On the 4th of this month information\r\nwas received that the _Société des Familles_, the most numerous and\r\nbest organised of secret societies at this time, proposed to make some\r\nattempt to raise a public disturbance. Their intention was perfectly\r\nclear; the fear of discovery doubtless prevented them from putting it\r\ninto effect. They proposed to advance upon the prison where the\r\npolitical prisoners are confined, to set them at liberty, to seize the\r\nPrefecture of Police, and thence to march upon Neuilly. The Ministers\r\nassert that their intentions were quite serious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 9, 1836._--The newspapers are already declaring a\r\nterrible war upon the new Ministry, which will be settled before the\r\nChambers.[45] The Opposition journals predict a breach in the\r\nCabinet, which seems a not unlikely possibility. Then perhaps we shall\r\nsee M. Thiers return to the head of affairs, but with a certain\r\nopposition to confront him, after making war upon a system which he\r\nhad long supported and entering into obligations with men inclining to\r\nthe Left, in which case he would be likely to draw the Government into\r\ndangerous paths. I do not really know, but in general things seem to\r\nme to be growing dark. In any case it is fair to recognise that the\r\nnew Ministerial combination can display to the country and abroad\r\nhonourable names, distinguished talent, and recognised capacity. Let\r\nus hope, then, that it may rest upon a solid basis. Eight or ten days\r\nbefore the last crisis M. Molé, after a considerable silence, wrote a\r\nvery sprightly letter to M. Royer-Collard and to myself.\r\n\r\n  [45] The Ministry was composed as follows: M. Molé, President of\r\n  the Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs; M. Guizot, Minister\r\n  of Public Instruction; M. Persil, Minister of Justice; M.\r\n  Duchâtel, Financial Minister; M. de Gasparin, Minister of the\r\n  Interior, with M. de Rémusat as Under-Secretary of State; M.\r\n  Martin du Nord, Minister of Commerce and Public Works; General\r\n  Bernard, Minister of War; and Admiral Rosamel, Minister of Naval\r\n  Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 10, 1836._--Yesterday M. de Talleyrand received a\r\nnice deferential little note from M. Molé upon his accession to the\r\nMinistry. The burden of the letter was as follows: As the new Cabinet\r\nhad been formed upon a question and with ideas which M. de Talleyrand\r\nhad wisely made his own, the new Ministers might congratulate\r\nthemselves upon his approval, and for himself he trusted that it might\r\nbe so, as he relied upon M. de Talleyrand's counsel and opinion. M. de\r\nTalleyrand immediately replied. It is not my business to praise the\r\nanswer, but I think it should please M. Molé, though he will find no\r\ncriticism in it of the man whose place he takes. M. de Talleyrand may\r\nregret the blindness of M. Thiers upon the Spanish question, but it is\r\nnot for him to blame M. Thiers in definite terms, as he has long shown\r\nand felt goodwill for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 11, 1836._--I shall not quote Madame de Lieven as\r\ntestifying to the accuracy of the story told by M. de Montessuy,[46]\r\nbut I admit that I cannot understand so strange an incident. If one of\r\nour princesses or our Sovereign had so acted, a revolutionary\r\ninterpretation would immediately have been put upon it at St.\r\nPetersburg, and if the Emperor Nicholas admits Horace Vernet, and\r\nespecially M. de Löwe-Weimar, to his favour, his intimacy, and his\r\nconfidence, I do not see why the King should be reproached for dining\r\nat the Tuileries with his National Guards. The truth is,\r\nLouis-Philippe cannot use the knout or Siberia, which are two stern\r\nprecautions against familiarity, though it is fortunate for each of us\r\nthat these weapons are not in his hands; in Russia, neither age nor\r\nsex nor rank nor merit is any protection.\r\n\r\n  [46] _See_ above, p. 63.\r\n\r\nI have a letter from M. Guizot couched in most sprightly terms,\r\ntelling me of his entrance to the Council. The friendship of the King\r\nfor M. de Talleyrand and the confidence with which he honours him\r\nforbid any Minister to be on bad terms with him; our intentions are\r\nidentical, so that between ourselves and these gentlemen all should go\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nI have a long letter from the Comte Alexis de Saint-Priest from\r\nLisbon. He writes from time to time, though I only send short dry\r\nnotes by way of answer; but he seems determined to regard them as\r\nproofs of friendship. It is merely a case of calculating\r\nself-interest. He knows that the Duc d'Orléans shows me some kindness,\r\nand he believes himself called upon to play a part when this Prince\r\ncomes to the throne, and therefore desires in any case to be one of my\r\nfriends; any one reading the opening sentences of his letter would\r\nthink that I was a great deal to him and he to me. I am somewhat vexed\r\nin consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 13, 1836._--How is it that people are so often\r\nfound ready to report ill-tempered speeches to the persons affected by\r\nthem? It is a strange and too common frame of mind. To myself it is so\r\nhateful that while I believe myself incapable of it, I always receive\r\nvery coldly those who bring me confidential remarks of this nature. I\r\nthink that the first condition upon which one can live in peace is to\r\nspeak evil of things only when they are bad and as little as possible\r\nof people, and the second condition is to disregard evil spoken about\r\nourselves unless it be spoken to warn one of some trap or actual\r\ndanger, but it is very rarely that such information is actuated by\r\nthis good and laudable intention. These moral reflections are evoked\r\nby the slanders which Lord Rosse is said to have uttered about Madame\r\nde Lieven and the information brought to her concerning them. In any\r\ncase I see that social habit, knowledge of the world, the necessities\r\nof conversation, and, in short, the thousand and one considerations\r\nwhich make hypocrisy a virtue, or at any rate a social quality, allow\r\nthese two people to meet on good terms, and if that be so, my theories\r\nare of little or no importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 16, 1836._--The following is an extract from a\r\nletter received by M. de Talleyrand yesterday; it was not sent by\r\nMadame Adélaïde, but the writer is generally very well informed. \"M.\r\nMolé is ill. He has not yet been able to pay any calls, nor to receive\r\nany ambassador, nor has any council yet been held by the King. It is\r\nsaid that his health will not allow him to remain long in office, and\r\nthat he will never establish himself there with any certainty. If he\r\nshould resign, it is thought that the Ministry would not be entirely\r\ndislocated, and that Montalivet would probably take his place. There\r\nis also a rumour that the Ministry is ready to confront the Chambers\r\nfearlessly, and expects to secure a majority, that it is ready to be\r\ncontented with a small majority in the hope of seeing it grow, and\r\nthat it does not intend to make every point a Cabinet question.\r\nMarshal Soult is not to be Minister of War. He was anxious to be\r\nPresident of the Council, but this was refused, and the post will\r\nprobably be given to Molitor, Sébastiani, or Bernard. The Ministry is\r\nentirely dominated by the King's policy upon the Spanish question. The\r\nbody which was gathering on the Pyrenees frontier will be disbanded\r\nand the Foreign Legion abandoned. In any case that legion is at the\r\nservice of Spain, and we have no right to use it for our own purposes.\r\nStrictest adherence will be maintained to the limits laid down by the\r\ntreaty of the Quadruple Alliance. At the same time an ambassador at\r\nMadrid will be appointed, though the death of Rayneval might have\r\nenabled us to dispense with this; but the appointment will be made\r\nfrom respect to England. A rumour has gone abroad, but it is a great\r\nsecret, and the appointment is not yet settled, that this ambassador\r\nwill be the Duc de Coigny. The King is a little doubtful of the\r\nattitude which Thiers will adopt. He is also much displeased with him,\r\nand has expressed his displeasure several times. At one time Thiers\r\ntook some steps to return to the Ministry, and the matter was\r\ndiscussed. He then submitted himself wholly to the King's opinion and\r\nwill upon the Spanish question, but the style of the King's expression\r\nshowed that he was very far from reposing confidence in Thiers, and\r\nthat he would only take him back perforce and in a difficult and\r\nunavoidable position. The true cause of Thiers' resignation is not so\r\nmuch difference of opinion between the King and himself as the\r\ndeceitful course by which he wished to draw the King into intervention\r\nagainst his will. Since he has gone several facts have been discovered\r\nof which no one had any suspicion. Thiers went away announcing that he\r\nwould only return for the following session if he saw his policy\r\nattacked. He is said to be really very despondent about his fall, and\r\nhas the more reason for despondency as he is sole author of it. The\r\nmode of his resignation has greatly diminished the reputation which he\r\nfirst achieved, and the public opinion is not in his favour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 21, 1836._--Yesterday we heard that the\r\nConstitution of 1820 had been proclaimed at Lisbon. It is asserted\r\nthat this event was prepared at London, and the fact remains that\r\nAdmiral Gage, who was in harbour with three ships of the line,\r\nremained a passive spectator. The queens of the South are not destined\r\nto enjoy unbroken slumber, for at Lisbon, as at Madrid, the Queen was\r\nforced to sign the new Constitution at two o'clock in the morning. The\r\narmy took the side of the people and of the National Guard. The poor\r\nlittle Prince of Coburg has made a sad marriage indeed. If he remains\r\nin private life with so heavy a burden as Doña Maria he will collapse.\r\nIt is impossible to avoid some feeling of dismay at these military\r\nreactions, and we are deeply anxious to see our Cabinet completed by a\r\n_real_ Minister of War. General Bernard was the last chance, and would\r\nbe the best choice, as Marshal Soult persistently refuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 23, 1836._--Our festival of St. Maurice[47] was\r\nheld yesterday, and was most brilliant. Numbers of neighbours came,\r\nand our cousins came over from Saint-Aignan. The gamekeepers with\r\ntheir early trumpet-blasts, fine weather, a long drive, the banquet in\r\nthe Castle, and dinner to the little school-girls, the three courts\r\nlighted up, and a most pretty entertainment, cheerfully and\r\ndelightfully played, completed our festivity.\r\n\r\n  [47] St. Maurice was the patron saint of the Prince de\r\n  Talleyrand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 25, 1836._--It is certain that Charles X., to\r\nplease the Duc de Bordeaux, has requested Don Carlos to receive his\r\ngrandson into his army, and Don Carlos has very wisely refused. The\r\ntruth is that this would have been the only thing that could have\r\ninduced France to intervene.\r\n\r\nA letter from Strasburg gives me many details concerning the Abbé\r\nBautain and MM. Ratisbonne and de Bonnechose which interest me\r\ngreatly, for it was these men who carried on the correspondence\r\nconcerning the philosophy of religion which I read last winter. This\r\nbook is preceded by their biographies and the story of their\r\nconversion, so that my knowledge of their case is complete. M.\r\nRoyer-Collard, to whom I have spoken several times concerning the Abbé\r\nBautain, told me that when he was high master of the university he\r\nknew the Abbé, then quite a young man; that he had a distinguished\r\nmind and a lively imagination, but that his mother was at Charenton\r\nand that there seemed some likelihood of his following her, though at\r\nthe same time he thought a great deal of him for many reasons. I trust\r\nthat the death of Mlle. Humann will not relax the precious bond which\r\nunites all these young people, with their goodness and sincerity. The\r\nmanner of Mlle. Humann's death was like that of Queen Anne of Austria,\r\na description of which I have just read in the _Mémoires_ of Madame de\r\nMotteville; this queen also died of cancer. I know few incidents so\r\ntouching and edifying, so curious and well described, as the death of\r\nthis princess. I have finished these memoirs; a book which\r\ncounterbalances, from the political standpoint, the memoirs of\r\nCardinal de Retz. By way of restoring my equilibrium, I am reading\r\nthe _Mémoires_ of the Grande Mademoiselle. I read them before my\r\nmarriage, at a time when I did not know France, and therefore knew\r\neven less the district which I now inhabit, and in which this princess\r\nlived for a long time; consequently her book has an entirely new\r\nattraction for me and interests me deeply.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 28, 1836._--A few days ago a Spanish courier\r\narrived at Paris from Madrid. He had been stopped by the Carlists, who\r\nhad taken all his despatches except those directly addressed to King\r\nLouis-Philippe. In these despatches Queen Christina announces that she\r\nproposes to leave Madrid, leaving the two Princesses behind. The next\r\nday a telegram came in stating that the Queen is to leave Madrid, with\r\nall the Ministry, for Badajoz. This town was chosen as being nearest\r\nto Portugal, and because the Queen would be unable to travel in the\r\ndirection of Cadiz or the Pyrenees or to any seaport. Unfortunate\r\ncreature!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 2, 1836._--M. de Valençay, who is at the camp of\r\nCompiègne with the Duc d'Orléans, writes that everything is going off\r\nwell and that the King's visit has had an excellent effect. The\r\nMinisters, who all accompanied the King to Compiègne, followed him on\r\nhorseback to the great review, but M. Molé felt uncomfortable after a\r\nfew minutes and got into the Queen's carriage. The camp is said to be\r\nvery fine; the King was excellently received, and the young Princes\r\nmake a good appearance. I am the more pleased to hear this as it is\r\nthe first time that the King has left his confinement since the case\r\nof Alibaud. His presence in camp must have been thought very\r\nnecessary, as the Duc d'Orléans answered for the King's safety with\r\nhis own life, begging him to go and show himself to the troops; and\r\nonly then did the Council, which had at first opposed the plan,\r\nconsent to the King's journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 5, 1836._--I must copy the following passage about\r\nthe castle of Valençay, which I found in the _Mémoires_ of the Grand\r\nMademoiselle, vol. ii. p. 411, in the year 1653: \"I continued my\r\njourney to Valençay, and arrived there by torchlight. I thought I was\r\nentering an enchanted house. The rooms are the most handsome,\r\ndelightful, and magnificent, in the world; the staircase is very fine,\r\nand is reached by an arcaded gallery that is superb. It was\r\nbeautifully lighted up; there were plenty of people, including Madame\r\nde Valençay, and some local ladies with handsome daughters, and the\r\ngeneral effect was most perfect. The room corresponded with the beauty\r\nof the staircase, both in decorations and furniture. It rained the\r\nwhole day that I was there, and I think the weather must have done it\r\non purpose, as the covered walks had only just been begun. From there\r\nI went to Selles; it is a fine house.\"\r\n\r\nI have a letter from Alexander von Humboldt about the death of my man\r\nof business, Herr Hennenberg. He offers his services in a most\r\nobliging and careful letter, marked by the utmost flattery and\r\nwittiness, a curious document which I shall keep among my precious\r\nautographs. The death of this man has aroused the interest of all my\r\nfriends. Were it not for the anxiety which would pursue me if I were\r\nto leave M. de Talleyrand and my daughter, a journey to Prussia would\r\nsuit me entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 18, 1836._--Yesterday I had a letter from the\r\nPrince de Laval, written from Maintenon, where he was staying with M.\r\nde Chateaubriand and Madame Récamier. He told me that a messenger from\r\nthe Princesse de Polignac had just arrived begging the Duc de Noailles\r\nto go to Paris to try and remove the fresh obstacle which prevented\r\nthe accomplishment of the promise to improve the condition of the\r\nprisoners. The Prince de Laval adds that the Duc de Noailles was about\r\nto start, and that he would return to Montigny, whence he would come\r\nand pay us a short visit and tell us of the new complications which\r\nhave arisen concerning the poor prisoners of Ham.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 20, 1836._--Yesterday we had a pleasant visit from\r\nM. Royer-Collard, who came over from Châteauvieux in spite of the\r\ndeplorable state of the roads. He was very indignant that any one\r\nshould be bargaining with the prisoners of Ham about their liberty. He\r\nleft me a letter which he had received from M. de Tocqueville, who had\r\nreturned from a journey in Switzerland. In it I found the following\r\npassage: \"I have closely examined Switzerland for two months. It is\r\nvery possible that the present severity of the French Government\r\ntowards it may force this disunited people to submit, but it is\r\ncertain in any case that we have made implacable enemies there. We\r\nhave accomplished a miracle by uniting in common feeling against\r\nourselves parties hitherto irreconcilable. This miracle has been\r\nperformed by the violent measure of M. Thiers, and perhaps even more\r\nby the pride and haughtiness of our ambassador, M. de Montebello, and\r\nhis mania for interfering in the domestic affairs of the country upon\r\nevery possible occasion.\"\r\n\r\nI have recently been thinking a great deal of what has been done or\r\nleft undone for the prisoners at Ham. All the newspapers with the\r\nexception of the _Débats_ unanimously blame the last measures, the\r\nfavours offered as a bargain and the degrading conditions imposed upon\r\nthese prisoners, who are a class by themselves and unexampled in\r\nhistory. These unfortunate men, moreover, are not asking for liberty,\r\nbut are only requesting some alleviation on the score of their health.\r\nIt seems that our present Ministers do not share the opinion of\r\nCardinal de Retz, who said: \"Everything that seems dangerous and\r\nreally is not, is almost always a wise measure.\" Some one else makes\r\nanother observation which seems very applicable to recent events:\r\n\"There is nothing finer than to do favours to those who are against\r\nus, and nothing weaker, in my opinion, than to receive favours from\r\nthem. Christianity, which enjoins the first action upon us, would\r\ncertainly have enjoined the second if it were good.\" Here we have a\r\nclever saying in the style of that fine period when everybody, even\r\nthe least perfect, had some grandeur about him. I do not know whether\r\nvice is now any less, but as for grandeur I can find none.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 23, 1836._--I have decided to write a short note\r\nconcerning the castle of Valençay, describing its foundation and\r\nhistory, &c., which I shall dedicate to my grandson, Boson, in the\r\nfollowing words:[48]\r\n\r\n   TO MY GRANDSON,\r\n\r\n   \"All are agreed that it is disgraceful to know nothing of the\r\n   history of one's own country, and that undue modesty or undue\r\n   presumption are possible dangers if one is ignorant of one's\r\n   family history, but few are aware how greatly the pleasure of\r\n   inhabiting a beautiful spot is increased by some knowledge of its\r\n   traditions. Of these three kinds of ignorance the last is\r\n   undoubtedly of least importance, but it is also the most common;\r\n   schoolmasters may create the first, parents the second, but only\r\n   individual taste can lead us to inquire into dates and facts\r\n   connected with places which are not generally recognised as\r\n   famous. This inquiry may seem trivial if it is not justified by\r\n   any interesting recollections of the past, but in such a case as\r\n   that of Valençay, where the house is well known for its connection\r\n   with celebrities, it is the less excusable to disregard or to\r\n   confuse its history, as we are specially called, if not to\r\n   perpetuate these famous events, at least to respect them.\r\n\r\n   \"It has been a pleasure to make this piece of history easier for\r\n   your study. May it encourage you to remain as noble in heart and\r\n   thought as are the glories and the traditions of the ancient place\r\n   of which I propose to tell you the story.\"\r\n\r\n  [48] This note upon Valençay was printed in 1848 by Crapelet, Rue\r\n  de Vaugirard, at Paris, with the dedication to which the author\r\n  here refers. This curious work is quoted by Larousse in his great\r\n  \"Dictionnaire universel du Dix-neuvième Siècle,\" under\r\n  \"Valençay.\" It has become scarce, but several copies exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 24, 1836._--Yesterday I had a very kind letter from\r\nthe Duc d'Orléans, telling me of the departure of his brother the Duc\r\nde Nemours for Constantine. He envies him his dangerous enterprise.\r\n\r\nM. the Prince de Joinville was at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 28, 1836._--All our letters from Paris say that no\r\nceremony has been more imposing than the erection of the Obelisk of\r\nLuxor.[49] The royal family was welcomed with delight. It was their\r\nfirst public appearance in Paris since Fieschi's attempt, and the\r\npeople showed their pleasure. The Cabinet hesitated, as in the case of\r\nCompiègne, but the royal will carried the day, and with successful\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n  [49] The Obelisk of Luxor was given to King Louis-Philippe by\r\n  Mehemet Ali, Pasha of Egypt. It was removed from its place before\r\n  the Temple of Luxor, carried to Paris, and erected in the Place\r\n  de la Concorde in 1836.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 30, 1836._--To-morrow I propose to start from here\r\nat eight o'clock in the morning; I shall lunch at Beauregard,[50] dine\r\nat Tours and sleep at my own house at Rochecotte, where M. de\r\nTalleyrand and my daughter will join me on November 2.\r\n\r\n  [50] With the Comtesse Camille de Sainte-Aldegonde.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 2, 1836._--I have not had a moment's rest since\r\nmy arrival here, as I had to put everything in order before the\r\nappearance of the guests whom I am expecting, and to examine the\r\nchanges that have been caused during my absence by the construction of\r\nthe artesian well; these changes have greatly improved the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the Castle, though much remains to be done.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that M. Thiers has uttered some very\r\nill-advised remarks concerning all of us. Ill-temper and despondency\r\nusually find unmeasured expression in the case of persons whose early\r\neducation has been deficient. It was the Spanish question which drove\r\nM. Thiers from the Ministry, and on this point he was absolutely\r\nopposed to M. de Talleyrand; hence the result. I have no ill-feeling\r\nagainst him; it was bound to be so. Moreover, there are very few\r\npeople of whom I am sufficiently fond to hate them profoundly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 4, 1836._--What is the meaning of all this\r\nStrasburg disturbance?[51] I am inclined to think there is something\r\nserious in this mad Bonaparte enterprise, from the fact that a similar\r\nmovement took place the same day at Vendôme. Six sergeants began the\r\naffair, which was immediately crushed, though one man was killed. I do\r\nnot know whether the newspapers have anything to say of it, but it is\r\nquite certain, as the two prefects of Tours and Blois related it to\r\nM. de Talleyrand, who told me the news when he arrived. The Grand\r\nDuchess Stephanie will be uneasy concerning the expedition of her\r\ncousin, Louis Bonaparte.[52] I am sorry for the Duchesse de Saint-Leu,\r\nalthough I think she had some knowledge of the affair and is more\r\ninclined to intrigue than to act a part; but she is a mother, and has\r\nalready lost her eldest son, and she must feel terrible anxiety; it is\r\na just though bitter punishment for her miserable intrigues.\r\n\r\n  [51] On October 26, 1836, Prince Louis Bonaparte, accompanied by\r\n  his friend M. de Persigny, and supported by Colonel Vaudrey,\r\n  attempted to begin a military revolt and to overthrow the king,\r\n  Louis-Philippe.\r\n\r\n  [52] Afterwards Napoleon III.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 7, 1836._--Yesterday I had a letter from Madame\r\nde Lieven, who tells me that the Emperor Nicholas is indisposed. When\r\na Russian admits that the Emperor is indisposed he must indeed be ill.\r\nHis death would be an event of very different importance from the\r\noutbreak at Strasburg. I do not think the French would have any great\r\nreason to regret him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 10, 1836._--Madame Adélaïde informs M. de\r\nTalleyrand that the King has resolved not to bring the young Bonaparte\r\nto trial; he will simply insist upon his immediate departure for\r\nAmerica and exact a formal promise that he will never return to\r\nFrance. Madame de Saint-Leu has written to the King to beg for her\r\nson's life. She is known to be hidden at Paris, where the authorities\r\nare unwilling to leave her; nor will they allow her to live in\r\nSwitzerland. Apparently she will go to the United States with her son.\r\nWhat foolishness it is which can lead to such a result!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 11, 1836._--Madame de Lieven was saying recently\r\nbefore Pozzo that she would perhaps spend the next winter at Rome.\r\n\"What on earth would you find to do in Italy?\" cried Pozzo. \"You could\r\nask no one to tell you the news except the Apollo Belvedere, and if he\r\nrefused you would say, 'Wretch, away with you!'\" This sally of Pozzo's\r\nmade every one laugh, including the Princess; she is, in fact, quite\r\nfrivolous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 20, 1836._--Yesterday's letters told of a\r\nreversal in the affairs of Portugal. The counter-revolution seems to\r\nhave failed at the moment when success was thought certain, and the\r\nmishap was due to a want of understanding between the little Van de\r\nWeyer and Lord Howard de Walden. The disaster is complete.\r\n\r\nMadame Adélaïde tells M. de Talleyrand that the Court will certainly\r\nnot go into mourning for the death of Charles X., as no notification\r\nof the event has been received.[53] She quotes several examples in\r\nwhich mourning was not worn for this reason, though near relatives\r\nwere concerned, including the case of the late Queen of Naples; she\r\nwas aunt and mother-in-law to the Emperor of Austria, and died in the\r\nImperial castle near Vienna, but the Austrian Court did not go into\r\nmourning because the King of Naples, who was then in Sicily, did not\r\nsend a notification of his wife's death. Such precedents are\r\ninvincible.\r\n\r\n  [53] Charles X. had just died at Goritz, in Austria, on November\r\n  6, 1836.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 21, 1836._--The death of Charles X. has divided\r\nsociety in Paris upon every point. Every one wears mourning according\r\nto his own fancy, from colours to deep black by infinite gradations,\r\nand with fresh bitterness about every yard of crape that seems to be\r\nwanting. Some refer to him as the Comte de Marnes and Henry V., others\r\nas Louis XIX. In short, the place is a perfect Babel, and they are not\r\neven agreed upon the disease of which Charles X. died. Yesterday's\r\nletters speak of nothing else, except the affairs of Portugal. We are\r\ninformed that the clumsy attempt might easily shake the position of\r\nLord Palmerston.[54]\r\n\r\n  [54] The Queen of Portugal had been forced, after several\r\n  outbreaks, to accept the Radical Constitution of 1820. In\r\n  November she began a counter-revolution, helped by Palmella,\r\n  Terceira, and Saldanha, believing, at the instigation of England,\r\n  that the population of Lisbon would support her, and proposing to\r\n  dismiss her Ministers. She had been wrongly informed concerning\r\n  the popular feeling, and was forced to abandon the struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 22, 1836._--The Prince de Laval writes that M.\r\nde Ranville is staying with him at Montigny, while M. de Polignac[55]\r\nis on the road for Munich and Goritz. I do not know at all how this\r\nbusiness has been arranged, nor do I know the meaning of this meeting\r\nof Paris clergy summoned to the house of M. Guizot, the Minister of\r\nPublic Worship. They say that the Archbishop is preparing a manifesto\r\nin consequence, but I have not yet received the answer to the riddle.\r\n\r\n  [55] M. de Polignac, who was a prisoner at Ham, had demanded from\r\n  M. Molé his transference to a sanatorium.\r\n\r\nOnly the Abbé de Vertot could tell the full story of the revolutions\r\nin Portugal. Lord Palmerston would not be the hero of it, nor Lord\r\nHoward de Walden either. What can one think of the base methods\r\nemployed by such diplomacy?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 28, 1836._--Differences of opinion concerning\r\nthe question of mourning for Charles X. have found their way into the\r\nroyal family; the Queen, who had voluntarily assumed mourning the\r\nfirst day, was vexed because the Ministry forced her to abandon it.\r\nThe Cabinet is afraid of newspaper controversy, but has gained\r\nnothing, as all the newspapers are in rivalry according to their\r\npolitical colouring. I am much puzzled to know what shade of white,\r\ngrey, or black I shall adopt when I reach Paris; generally speaking,\r\nthe ladies of the neutral party who are also of society wear black in\r\ncompany and white at Court. The position of our diplomatists abroad\r\nwill be very embarrassing.\r\n\r\nM. de Balzac, who is a native of Touraine, has come into the country\r\nto buy a small estate, and induced one of my neighbours to bring him\r\nhere. Unfortunately it was dreadful weather and I was forced to invite\r\nhim to dinner.\r\n\r\nI was polite, but very reserved. I am greatly afraid of these\r\npublicists, men of letters, and writers of articles. I never spoke a\r\nword without deep consideration, and was delighted when he went.\r\nMoreover, he did not attract me; his face and bearing are vulgar, and\r\nI imagine his ideas are equally so. Undoubtedly he is a clever man,\r\nbut his conversation is neither easy nor light, but, on the contrary,\r\nvery dull. He watched and examined all of us most minutely, especially\r\nM. de Talleyrand.\r\n\r\nI could very well have done without this visit, and should have\r\navoided it if I had been able. He aims at the extraordinary, and\r\nrelates a thousand incidents about himself, of which I believe none.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de Laval informed me that M. de Polignac has not yet been\r\nable to profit by the freedom which was granted him, as he was too ill\r\nto move at the moment arranged for his departure.[56] He asks to be\r\ntransported to the nearest frontier, Mons or Calais, to avoid any\r\nroute of which he could not endure the fatigue.\r\n\r\n  [56] His punishment had been commuted to perpetual banishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 2, 1836._--The Archbishop's letter concerning\r\nthe convocation of the clergy is a bad one, because of its\r\nfault-finding, which is an unsuitable characteristic in an\r\necclesiastic whose finest quality is evangelical simplicity; but we\r\nmust also admit that he must have been shocked by the attempt to\r\ninfluence the clergy directly, and that the prohibition of prayers\r\ninstituted by the Church is somewhat too revolutionary, and I wish we\r\ncould reform revolutionary ways more definitely. We cling to them out\r\nof fear, and this timidity, which is too obvious, brings us into\r\nisolation abroad and encourages enemies at home.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d'Angoulême will certainly style himself Louis XIX. and his\r\nwife the Queen; she wished it to be so. However, immediately after the\r\ndeath of Charles X. they sent all the insignia of royalty into the\r\nroom of the Duc de Bordeaux, declaring that even if events were\r\nfavourable they never wished to reign in France. In any case the\r\nnotifications were issued under the incognito title of Comte de\r\nMarnes. The young Prince is called Monseigneur at Goritz. He and his\r\nsister are staying with his uncle and aunt.\r\n\r\nM. de Polignac wrote to M. Molé after the death of Charles X., saying\r\npositively that he would be grateful to the King of the French for\r\npermission to leave Ham, and thus obtained his permit. M. Peyronnet\r\nwrote in charcoal on his prison wall, \"I ask mercy only from God,\"\r\nwhich I think he had hardly the right to say, since he left his prison\r\nin very lively spirits. He would not see M. de Polignac again, even at\r\nthe last moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 15, 1836._--I shall certainly leave here\r\nto-morrow evening, and shall be at Paris in the afternoon of the day\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  [The two correspondents whose letters furnish material for these\r\n  memoirs spent a few months together at Paris, so that the memoirs\r\n  were interrupted, and recommenced in 1837.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n1837\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 17, 1837._--The new Ministry, which entered upon office\r\nthe day before yesterday, and is destined to immortalise the date of\r\nApril 15, as different Governments are designated by such dates, will\r\nhave a stern conflict to wage, and I hope, for the sake of its leader,\r\nM. Molé, that it will emerge with honour from the struggle. The\r\n_Journal de Paris_ offers a frank Doctrinaire opposition; the _Journal\r\ndes Débats_ pronounces a funeral oration over the last Ministry and\r\noffers peace and support to the new one. All this promises neither\r\nreality, sincerity, fidelity, nor stability, and I hardly know to whom\r\nor to what it is reasonable to trust in the sphere of political\r\nrelations. M. Royer-Collard came to see me this morning before going\r\nto the Chamber of Deputies; he did not seem to think that the new\r\nMinistry would survive one session.[57]\r\n\r\n  [57] The Ministry was composed as follows: M. Molé, President of\r\n  the Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs; M. Barthe, Minister\r\n  of Justice; M. de Montalivet, Minister of the Interior; M.\r\n  Lacave-Laplagne, Financial Minister; M. de Salvandy, Minister of\r\n  Public Instruction. General Bernard, Admiral de Rosamel, and M.\r\n  Martin du Nord retained their portfolios; M. de Rémusat,\r\n  Under-Secretary of State, followed his Minister into retirement.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers came to dine with us, among other guests, and talked\r\nlargely, as usual. He came from the Chamber, where they had in vain\r\nawaited the official proclamation of the new Ministry which had been\r\nannounced. The King was to take the Electress,[58] who is at Paris at\r\nthis moment incognito as the Comtesse d'Arco, to visit Versailles,\r\nbut as the council lasted from ten in the morning till five in the\r\nafternoon the King was unable to go out or the Ministers to appear\r\nbefore the Chamber. The incident produced a bad effect upon the\r\nElectress, who is said to be irritable and scornful.\r\n\r\n  [58] Marianne Leopoldine, Archduchess of Austria-Este, born in\r\n  1771, married the Elector Charles Theodore of Bavaria. After her\r\n  husband's death she married the Grand Master of his Court, the\r\n  Comte Louis Arco. This princess died in 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 19, 1837._--Madame de Castellane, who came to see me\r\nthis morning, was very painfully affected by last night's session in\r\nthe Chamber, and told me that the extreme length of yesterday's\r\ncouncil was due to a keen discussion concerning the complete repeal of\r\nthe law of appanage and the advisability of leaving blank the appanage\r\nof the Duc d'Orléans in the law which was to be presented to the\r\nChamber on the occasion of his marriage with Princess Helena of\r\nMecklenburg-Schwerin; the Duc d'Orléans, who was present at the\r\ncouncil, was anxious that a blank space should be left, and eventually\r\ngained his point.\r\n\r\nHardly had Madame de Castellane left my house than Madame de Lieven\r\ncame in; she came to ask me to dinner to-day. She told me a saying\r\nwhich is current concerning the new Ministry, and is borrowed from a\r\nnew invention; they call it the deodorised Ministry.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the morning I had a visit from M. de Tocqueville,\r\nwho came to me from the Chamber, where he had witnessed the solemn\r\nentry of the Ministry. He said that the entry took place amid the most\r\nabsolute silence; there was not a word or a gesture, as if the benches\r\nhad been empty, and as if one had been in the middle of the ice upon\r\nLake Ladoga, to quote a later remark by Madame de Lieven. The same\r\nsilence prevailed during M. Molé's speech, and when the Ministry\r\nretired in a body to make their way to the Chamber of Peers there was\r\na murmur of dissatisfaction which drove back MM. de Salvandy and de\r\nRosamel, who had come to resume their places upon the Ministerial\r\nbench. In the ensuing debate Marshal Clauzel seems to have cut a poor\r\nfigure, but M. Jaubert was most incisive, and at his remarks upon the\r\nprovisional state of affairs malicious laughter against the Cabinet\r\nburst out on all sides. On the whole the impression was most\r\ndiscouraging for the new Ministry.\r\n\r\nAfter our dinner the Duc de Noailles came in his turn to give an\r\naccount of the Ministerial entry into the Chamber of Peers. M. Molé\r\nsaid a few short and confused words; M. de Brézé said that he thought\r\nthe speech too vague, and asked for some explanation of the reason for\r\nthe dissolution of the last Cabinet. M. Molé attempted to reply\r\nwithout committing himself, with the result, doubtless by mistake,\r\nthat he used the word \"categorical\" to characterise the brevity of his\r\nwords. Thereupon M. Villemain said maliciously that the speech of the\r\nPresident of the Council was anything rather than categorical, and\r\nthat he would like to know what was going to happen concerning the law\r\nof non-revelation. M. de Montalivet then got up, and is said to have\r\nmade an excellent speech. He would have left the Chamber with a\r\nthoroughly good impression, had not M. Siméon, the promoter of the law\r\nof non-revelation, announced that his speech was ready. This will be a\r\ngreat embarrassment for the Ministry, as they would have preferred to\r\nallow this proposed law to be forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 22, 1837._--Yesterday I had a visit from the Duc\r\nd'Orléans, who had just learnt the vote of the Chamber concerning his\r\nmarriage dotation, and was satisfied both with the form and matter of\r\nit. He seems to me inclined to spend half of the million allotted to\r\nhousehold expenses in charity to the workmen of Lyons, in bank-books\r\nbought for unfortunate people in the savings-banks of the country, in\r\nclothes for a large number of children in orphanages, and, in short,\r\nin good works. He is very pleased with his marriage, and in an\r\nexcellent temper. The Princess Helena wishes to be escorted from\r\nWeimar by an envoy of France, and a suitable person is being sought\r\nfor this mission. I should be glad to see the Baron de Montmorency\r\nobtain the honour. The Princess will see the King of Prussia at\r\nPotsdam. Her portrait has not yet arrived. There are still hopes that\r\nthe marriage will take place before June 15. As the Princess is not to\r\nbe married by procuration, and is not yet, consequently, the Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans, her household will not go to meet her at the frontier.\r\nThere she will be met only by some member of the King's household, and\r\nperhaps by one of the Queen's ladies; in any case, she is coming\r\naccompanied by her step-mother, the Dowager Grand Duchess of\r\nMecklenburg.\r\n\r\nMeunier will probably be pardoned on the occasion of the marriage.[59]\r\nThe trial of Meunier presents no interest as regards the character of\r\nthe individuals concerned, nor is their language in any way dramatic.\r\nThe affair is much inferior to that of Fieschi, or even of Alibaud,\r\nand the only effect produced has been one of disgust, which is the\r\nbest effect upon the public that could be produced.\r\n\r\n  [59] On December 27, 1836, at the opening of the Parliamentary\r\n  session, another attempt was made upon the life of King\r\n  Louis-Philippe as he was driving to the Palais Bourbon with three\r\n  of his sons. The criminal was Meunier, a young man aged\r\n  twenty-two, who was condemned to death by the Chamber of Peers;\r\n  but the King eventually secured a commutation of his penalty to\r\n  perpetual banishment on the occasion of the marriage of the Duc\r\n  d'Orléans.\r\n\r\nThe ridiculous compliment of M. Dupin to the Prince Royal is well\r\ncommented upon this morning in the _Journal de Paris_. The King would\r\nnot allow his son to receive the congratulations of the Chambers\r\nexcept in his own presence, which induced M. Sémonville to say that he\r\nwould have thought he was abdicating if any other course had been\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nI dined at the house of M. and Madame Mollien with M. and Madame\r\nBertin de Veaux, M. Guizot, and M. de Vandœuvre. There was much talk\r\nof the halting speech of M. Barthe, at the end of which he suddenly\r\ncame to a standstill, of the extremely poor appearance of the\r\nMinistry, and of the almost inevitable possibility of a duel between\r\nMM. Thiers and Guizot in the course of a session which will bring up\r\nso many burning questions. The two champions will deliver their blows\r\nupon the backs of the Ministry, which will probably succumb under\r\ntheir assault. This remark is fairly general, and is not my property.\r\nYesterday nothing more than skirmishing went on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 26, 1837._--I hear of discussions in England upon the\r\nSpanish question. M. Thiers gave assurances the other day that the\r\nEnglish Ministry was ready to leave Spain to its destiny. He deduced,\r\nwith some fear for the reigning French dynasty, the conclusion that\r\nDon Carlos would be triumphant. It is true that this question is\r\nconcerned with that of intervention, upon which he used to lay so much\r\nstress.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse d'Albuféra has been greatly agitated by the duel of her\r\nson-in-law, M. de La Redorte, who fought the editor of the _Corsaire_\r\non account of an insulting article which appeared two days ago in this\r\nwretched newspaper, apparently attacking both the person and the\r\nopinions of M. de La Redorte. The duel was fought with pistols, and\r\nthe editor was wounded in the hand; it is thought that he will lose a\r\nfinger. Social distinctions are destroyed by the excesses of the\r\nPress.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 27, 1837._--This morning I saw Madame Adélaïde, who told\r\nme that the King had just signed the commutation of Meunier's penalty.\r\nShe also told me that the Princess of Mecklenburg and her step-mother\r\nwould reach the French frontier on May 25; on May 28, St. Ferdinand's\r\nDay, there would be a birthday celebration for the Duc d'Orléans at\r\nFontainebleau, and the marriage would take place on the 31st.\r\n\r\nOur guests at dinner were the Princesse de Lieven, the Duc de\r\nNoailles, Labouchère, M. Thiers, and Matusiewicz, who has returned\r\nmuch aged from Naples, of which he gives a bad account, both for its\r\nclimate and its social resources. Thus the guests were somewhat\r\nheterogeneous, which was due to M. de Talleyrand's absence of mind,\r\nbut all went off very well and the conversation was lively, especially\r\nbetween M. Thiers and Madame de Lieven. She was positively coquettish\r\ntowards him--I use the word advisedly, because no other would express\r\nthe fact. M. Thiers gave an account of the Chamber, continually\r\nrepeating in a special tone of voice which evoked involuntary\r\nlaughter, \"Poor Ministry!\" At the same time he patronises the\r\nMinistry, though he would never consent, I think, to be patronised at\r\nthat price. It would suit him to keep the Ministry alive until the\r\nnext session, but his success is doubtful, for, as he says himself, an\r\ninvalid can be kept alive, but not a dead man. In yesterday's session\r\nthe Ministry equivocated, as usual, and eventually decided against\r\nMarshal Soult, which caused much ill-temper on the Left because the\r\nDoctrinaires shouted on every side, \"Settle it!\" \"Settle it!\" They\r\nsaid that the scene was quite scandalous. After Madame de Lieven took\r\nher leave the gentlemen stayed on for some time, and talked of the\r\nchanges which the schism had introduced into society, even into the\r\nneutral body of it. They discussed the influence of the _salons_ and\r\nof the women who controlled them. M. Thiers classed them as follows:\r\nThe _salon_ of Madame de Lieven is the observatory of Europe; that of\r\nMadame de Ségur is purely Doctrinaire, with no concessions; that of\r\nMadame de La Redorte is entirely in the power of M. Thiers; with\r\nMadame de Flahaut the convenience of the Duc d'Orléans is the general\r\ndesire, and with M. de Talleyrand the convenience of the King; the\r\nhouse of Madame de Broglie is for the 11th of October and for the\r\nconcession, though the most bitter of concessions; the cabinet of\r\nMadame de Dino is alone guided by the most perfect independence of\r\nmind and judgment. My share is thus by no means the worst, though, to\r\ntell the truth, it was pronounced in my presence.\r\n\r\nThe German newspapers announce the death of M. Ancillon, who had been\r\nill for a long time, when the doctor ordered him a draught and a\r\nliniment; he explained the matter to Madame Ancillon, who was starting\r\nfor a concert. When she came back she perceived that a mistake had\r\nbeen made, and a few hours afterwards the invalid was dead. The poor\r\nman was unfortunate in marriage. He began by marrying a wife who might\r\nhave been his mother, then one who might have been his daughter, and\r\nfinally this Belgian beauty, who was, I think, the worst of the three.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 29, 1837._--This morning I saw M. Royer-Collard, who\r\nspoke of the session in the Chamber of Deputies on the previous\r\nevening, when a million had been voted for the Queen of the Belgians.\r\nThe result, for which he also voted, was doubtless good, but the\r\ndebate seems to have been very ominous for the Government, and M. de\r\nCormenin by no means received a thrashing, but held the upper hand.\r\nThe same impression was given to me by two others who were present at\r\nthe session.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 30, 1837._--M. Thiers came to see me this morning before\r\nthe session of the Chamber. He confirmed the general report of the\r\nsession which discussed the grant to the Queen of the Belgians; but\r\nthe object of his visit was to complain of the Princesse de Lieven. He\r\nhas suddenly seen what I had foreseen long ago, that she did not take\r\nhim seriously, but brought him out and put him forward as an actor. He\r\nhas too much common sense not to see the ridiculous side of this and\r\nnot to feel it. He asked if I had noticed it and if others had seen\r\nit. I told him that no one had mentioned it to me, but that I thought\r\na little more reserve in his language in a _salon_ which he himself\r\ncalled the observatory of Europe would not be out of place. I advised\r\nhim, however, to remain on good terms with the Princess, who is really\r\nfond of him, and whose wit and easy conversation please him also. I\r\nthink he found an opportunity the other day of letting drop a few\r\nwords to her that frightened her considerably. There is no harm in\r\nthat, as she is a person with whom one must remain upon good terms and\r\nyet keep in check.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 1, 1837._--The Duc de Broglie is going to meet the\r\nPrincess of Mecklenburg at Fulda, on this side of Weimar, not to marry\r\nher, but to offer his compliments and his escort. The wife of Marshal\r\nLobau will be the Princess's lady-of-honour.\r\n\r\nYesterday I had a letter from the Archbishop of Paris, who sends me a\r\ncopy of the answer from Rome, which he had just received, concerning\r\nhis last difficulties with reference to the archiepiscopal estate.\r\nRome entirely approves his conduct, and leaves him free to conduct any\r\ntransaction which may satisfy his general interests. This last phrase\r\nis distinctly vague. I shall probably go to-morrow afternoon to thank\r\nthe Archbishop and to learn some further details. He adds in his\r\nletter that he is certain that the Government have received an answer\r\nsimilar to that which he communicates to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 2, 1837._--I am assured that the Prussian Minister here,\r\nBaron von Werther, will take the place of M. Ancillon at Berlin. He is\r\noffering some objection to the proposal, but it is thought that he\r\nwill accept.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Mornay has been nicknamed the Sosthenes of the July\r\nrevolution--amusing, but very true.\r\n\r\nI have seen M. Royer-Collard, who thought that the law concerning\r\nsecret funds would pass, but would be a mortal blow to the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening I went to the Court reception held on the 1st of\r\nMay.[60] There was an enormous crowd, including every type of beauty\r\nand ugliness, of well and badly dressed people. The Duc d'Orléans did\r\nnot appear, as he is suffering from a severe sore throat and\r\ninflammation of the eyes. He is wise to take care of himself, as he\r\nhas only three weeks for that purpose.\r\n\r\n  [60] The birthday of Louis-Philippe.\r\n\r\nI was told at the Château that in a morning session of the Chamber M.\r\nJaubert had positively flayed the Ministry, and that to-day's session\r\nmight easily end in their overthrow. I hardly think so, as no one is\r\nanxious to seize their inheritance.\r\n\r\nRumours are also current of an important victory said to be won by Don\r\nCarlos.\r\n\r\nApparently I did not mention what Matusiewicz told me about the new\r\nQueen of Naples, concerning whom I asked him many questions. She is\r\nthe Archduchess Theresa of whom so much was heard last year. He says\r\nthat she is agreeable, witty, kind, and nice, with no haughtiness or\r\nfine manners, and nothing of the princess about her. The King is said\r\nto be deeply in love with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 4, 1837._--Yesterday I went to the Sacred Heart to see the\r\nArchbishop. I found him delighted with the answer from Rome, and not\r\nanxious to make any public parade of it. Whatever formalities the\r\nother side might raise, he was anxious to use the liberty given him\r\nfrom Rome to handle the whole question in a pacific spirit; in short,\r\nhe was calmer and gentler than I had seen him for a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 5, 1837._--M. Molé, who dined here yesterday, said that\r\nhis colleague, M. Martin du Nord, would make a kind of apology to-day\r\nto the Chamber for his outburst of the day before yesterday. M. Thiers\r\nhas harangued his forces and calmed their feelings.\r\n\r\nThe ratification of the marriage contract of the Duc d'Orléans has\r\ncome to hand from Mecklenburg; the illness of Herr von Plessen, the\r\nMecklenburg Minister, had prevented him from travelling to the spot\r\nwhere the ratifications are to be exchanged, and some delay was\r\nfeared, which would have been the more prolonged as the Minister has\r\nsince died. M. Bresson therefore sent a bearer to him with the Act; he\r\nwas almost at his last gasp when he signed it, and died three hours\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nHerr von Lutteroth says that the portrait of the Prince Royal which he\r\nwas commissioned to take to the Princess Helena produced an excellent\r\nimpression. Two attacks of influenza made it impossible to finish the\r\nportrait of the Princess; in her place I would not send anything. Herr\r\nvon Lutteroth is full of the delightful qualities of the Princess,\r\nalthough he admits that her nose is by no means distinguished and her\r\nteeth rather bad. Otherwise she is admirable, especially her figure,\r\nwhich is charming. When he dined with her her gloves were too large\r\nand she wore black shoes which obviously were not made at Paris. The\r\nvexatious point is that the Duc d'Orléans has an obstinate cold on his\r\nchest; he coughs a great deal and his voice is very weak, but he is\r\ntaking care of himself, and wisely.\r\n\r\nMecklenburg princesses have no dowry, but when they marry the States\r\nvote them two or three hundred thousand francs as a voluntary gift.\r\nThe Duc d'Orléans has refused this vote, to the great delight, it is\r\nsaid, of the people of Mecklenburg. The Duc de Broglie will be\r\naccompanied upon his mission by the Comte Foy, son of the famous\r\nGeneral, the Comte d'Haussonville, MM. Léon de Laborde, Philippe de\r\nChabot, and Doudain, the last-named with the title of First Secretary\r\nto the embassy.[61]\r\n\r\n  [61] This embassy of honour was sent to meet the royal bride; the\r\n  meeting took place at Fulda on May 22, 1837.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 6, 1837._--After a visit from M. Royer-Collard, and as\r\nthough by way of contrast, I went yesterday morning and waited for a\r\nlong time at Madame Bautrand's, the famous costumier. I wanted to\r\nchoose a few things for the entertainments at Fontainebleau, and spent\r\nan interesting time over it. In the first place there were the most\r\ndelightful articles, then there was a crowd of people waiting for some\r\nmark of favour, and messages were coming from the Château hastily\r\nsummoning the great personage. One really might have thought one's\r\nself in the rooms of a party leader.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening I had a note from Madame de Castellane written after\r\nthe session of the Chamber, giving the following account of it: M.\r\nMartin du Nord offered a reasonable explanation; M. Augustin Giraud\r\nvigorously attacked M. Molé, who returned an admirable reply; M. Vatry\r\nchallenged the great champions to enter the arena by proposing an\r\namendment; M. de Lamartine, in a wearisome speech entirely off the\r\npoint, aroused M. Odilon Barrot, who then delivered one of his finest\r\nspeeches; M. Guizot in his turn made an excellent reply.\r\n\r\nI was awakened just now to receive a note from M. Molé, telling me\r\nthat M. Thiers, shaken and almost converted by yesterday's session, is\r\nanxious to overthrow the Ministry and so force M. Guizot to come\r\nforward with his friends, with the object of overthrowing him in turn;\r\nhe adds that M. Dupin reminded M. Thiers of his obligations, telling\r\nhim that such action would be dishonourable. M. Thiers seemed to waver\r\nonce more, and announced that he would summon his friends again. M.\r\nMolé sends me this news, asking me to discuss it with M. Thiers from\r\nDupin's point of view. He has applied to the wrong person, for the\r\nburnt child fears the fire, and I have too keen a recollection of last\r\nyear's scene to put my hand into a wasp's nest of that kind. I prefer\r\nnot to meddle with what does not concern me, but in any case to-day's\r\nwork will decide the case of the Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 7, 1837._--I did not go out yesterday morning, and left my\r\ndoor open, so certain visitors came in: M. Jules d'Entraigues, the Duc\r\nde Noailles, and the little Princess Schönberg. All were full of the\r\nsession of the previous evening and of M. Guizot's magnificent speech.\r\nHe really performed admirably, and aroused the deepest parliamentary\r\nemotion in the Chamber.\r\n\r\nAbout five o'clock M. de Tocqueville arrived. He came from the session\r\nand had just heard Thiers, who had replied to Guizot. It seems that no\r\none ever showed greater power; it is he who saved the Ministry and\r\nsecured the passing of the law.[62] He added that Thiers spoke quietly\r\nand coldly, seeming to avoid any oratorical effects, and not\r\nattempting to outdo his rival in dramatic display, but anxious only to\r\ndeliver a blow, and he is said to have succeeded.\r\n\r\n  [62] The reference is to a law concerning the estimates for the\r\n  secret police fund.\r\n\r\nAt dinner our guests were the Duchesse d'Albuféra, M. and Madame de La\r\nRedorte, MM. Thiers and Mignet. M. Thiers was well pleased with his\r\nday's work, and gave a warm tribute to Guizot, roundly asserting that\r\nhe would never have been so foolish as to try and eclipse him, seeing\r\nthat that was impossible; he had attempted only to make his position\r\nimpossible, and that he had done. He then gave us his speech, which\r\nseemed to me to be strikingly clear, sensible, and practical. He told\r\nme that M. Royer-Collard had almost fallen upon his neck, saying, \"You\r\nhave killed them!\"\r\n\r\nIn the evening I went to Madame Molé's, to a dinner given in return\r\nfor that which I recently gave when the Electress was present. The\r\nonly subject of conversation was the session in the Chamber. The\r\nMinistry were as pleased as if they had been successful, though there\r\nis no possibility that they will triumph. As I came back I called upon\r\nMadame de Lieven. She had heard Guizot on the previous evening, but\r\nnot Thiers in the morning. Thus she had remained entirely under\r\nGuizot's influence, which was the more appropriate as he came in\r\nhimself delighted with the concert of praise by which he has been\r\nreceived; but in reality he felt the blow had been struck. I, who know\r\nhim well, thought his feelings quite obvious.\r\n\r\nAs I write I am quite deafened by the noise of the drum which is\r\ncontinually beaten for the great review of the National Guard which\r\nthe King is to hold to-day. Heaven grant that all goes off well. I am\r\nmost anxious.\r\n\r\nI know that Herr von Werther and Apponyi are but moderately satisfied\r\nwith the political doctrines expressed by M. Guizot in his speech of\r\nthe day before yesterday; they were expecting a less limited and less\r\nmiddle-class system. There they were wrong, for M. Guizot's social\r\nideas are alone appropriate to the age and to the country as it is now\r\nconstituted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 8, 1837._--I should be delighted if the last piece of news\r\nI have heard were true, that the Grand Duchess Stephanie is to marry\r\nher daughter to the Duke of Leuchtenberg; there would then be no\r\npossibility of her marrying one of our princes, and I should be\r\nequally pleased because I am not anxious to see among them a nephew of\r\nthe Prefect of Blois.[63]\r\n\r\n  [63] The Comte de Lezay-Marnesia.\r\n\r\nThe day before yesterday, in the evening, I met the Marquis of\r\nConyngham at the house of Madame de Lieven. He related that the\r\nDuchess of Kent, who is always doing tactless things, recently invited\r\nLord Grey to dinner together with Lady Jersey. Their respective rank\r\nrequired that Lord Grey should take Lady Jersey into dinner; Sir John\r\nConroy requested Lord Grey to do so, but he absolutely refused, and\r\nLady Jersey was taken in by some one of lower rank. Both were keenly\r\nirritated in consequence.\r\n\r\nIt seems certain that the Duchesse de Saint-Leu is dying. The\r\nphysician Lisfranc, who has returned from Arenenberg, says so. The\r\npoor woman has mismanaged her life and her position, and she is\r\nexpiating her fault most cruelly. It is dreadful to survive her eldest\r\nson and to die far away from her second son, entirely cut off from her\r\nfamily; this misfortune disarms the severe criticism which one might\r\nbe tempted to utter concerning her.\r\n\r\nYesterday was held the great review, and all my rooms were filled from\r\neleven o'clock in the morning. From our windows we had a perfect view\r\nof the march past, which followed the Rue de Rivoli, and then passed\r\nin front of the Obelisk, where were the King, the Queen, the Princes,\r\nand a very numerous following. Sixty thousand National Guards and\r\ntwenty thousand line troops marched past. Previously the King had gone\r\nround the ranks within the Cour du Carrousel and on the Esplanade des\r\nInvalides. The National Guard shouted \"Vive le Roi!\" most vigorously,\r\nand the line troops still more so. The wind was cold and sharp, but\r\nthe sun was bright. The King returned to the Château across the garden\r\nof the Tuileries. Thus the King's state of siege has come to an end,\r\nand a good thing too. We must hope upon the one hand that it will not\r\noften be thought necessary to renew this form of proceeding, and that\r\non the other hand some relaxation may be possible of those excessive\r\nprecautions which spoilt the effect of the show, and which were\r\ncarried to such an extent yesterday that I have never seen anything\r\nsadder or more painful; the embankments, the Rue de Rivoli, the\r\nsquare, and the Tuileries were forbidden to every one except men in\r\nuniform, and men, women, children, little dogs, and every living being\r\nwere driven away; it was a complete desert, and every one was\r\nblockaded in his house. My son Valençay, to get from his house in the\r\nRue de Université to mine, was obliged to go by the Pont d'Auteuil!\r\nThis state of things was maintained until the King returned to his\r\nrooms. All the police were on duty, and the posts of the National\r\nGuard were doubled upon every side by a row of police and municipal\r\nguards surrounding the royal group. The town looked as though deserted\r\nor plague-stricken, with a conquering army marching through without\r\nfinding a stopping-place or inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAfter our dinner I went to inquire for the Queen and to say farewell\r\nto Madame Adélaïde, who is starting for Brussels this morning. There\r\nhad been a great military dinner of two hundred and sixty people in\r\nthe Hall of the Marshals; all were in full dress, pleased and\r\nanimated.\r\n\r\nI concluded the evening with Madame de Castellane, where I found M.\r\nMolé, who was very pleased with the result of the review.\r\n\r\nIn my wanderings I discovered that the last speech of M. Thiers was\r\ngaining an increasing hold on men's minds. It is thought that, without\r\nabandoning his general theories, he was pointing to a practical\r\nsolution which would satisfy all positive spirits; people are much\r\nobliged by the fact that in this speech he had twice separated from\r\nthe Left without hurting their feelings; in short, his clever words\r\nhave dissipated some of the fears which he inspired and removed some\r\nof the obstacles which stood between himself and the power. This\r\nimpression I have received from many different sides, and except the\r\nDoctrinaires and the extremists on the Left every one is feeling it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 9, 1837._--Yesterday I had a long visit from M.\r\nRoyer-Collard, whose admiration for the speech of M. Thiers is at its\r\nheight. He praises the occasion, the propriety of it, and above all\r\nthe truth, not only its personal truth--that is to say, its individual\r\nsincerity--but its truth with reference to the actual state of\r\nopinion, which the speaker alone has correctly appreciated. He said it\r\nwas one of those speeches over which one could never think too long,\r\nwhich grips the reader more and more, and the effect of which will\r\nsteadily increase. He admits that the session when MM. Odilon Barrot\r\nand Guizot spoke was more interesting to watch, and that the two\r\nactors played their parts very well, but that they were merely acting;\r\nthat they showed themselves good orators, but not statesmen; that both\r\nrelied upon extremist opinions which were worn out; that M. Guizot in\r\nparticular was no longer a man of his age, but an _émigré_; and that\r\nthis point had been admirably brought out by Thiers. M. Royer-Collard\r\nthinks the speech of Guizot imprudent and irritating, in which respect\r\nhe says that Guizot followed his arrogant disposition. In short, he\r\nsays many things; he says them in my sitting-room, but repeats them\r\nin the Chamber, at the Academy, to each and all, and makes it his\r\nbusiness to do so. This is very useful to M. Thiers, in whose speech\r\nthere is something too fine and subtle to be understood without a\r\ncommentary.\r\n\r\nI did not go out after M. Royer's call, but stayed at home to read the\r\nlife of Raphael by M. Quatremère; the book is lacking in warmth and\r\nvivacity, but it is well written. It is most restful at the present\r\ntime to return to the exquisite art of an age when men of genius were\r\ncomplete, because they possessed every shade of genius, if one may use\r\nthe phrase. Books of this kind give me an inexpressible longing for\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I looked in at the Austrian Embassy, where Madame de\r\nLieven told me a large amount of gossip from London. One of her\r\nstories was as follows: At the last Levée the King thanked the Turkish\r\nAmbassador aloud and through an interpreter for postponing a dinner\r\nwhich he was giving, on account of the death of Lady Delisle, his\r\nnatural daughter, and thus showing him a respect which his own family\r\nhad refused; this remark was aimed at the Duchess of Kent. At the last\r\nDrawing-room the Queen could not be present, as she was ill, and it\r\nwas held by Princess Augusta; the Duchess of Kent arrived with her\r\ndaughter; the King heartily embraced the latter without noticing her\r\nmother, and seeing Sir John Conroy in the throne-room he ordered the\r\nChamberlain to send him out. Finally, when the Prince of Linange came\r\nto his mother's house, the Duchess of Kent, with his wife, who is not\r\nhis equal in birth, the King sent Lord Conyngham to the Duchess to say\r\nthat he would receive his daughter-in-law, but could not permit her to\r\nenter his private apartments; the Duchess declined to receive Lord\r\nConyngham, and sent a message to say that if he came to pay a private\r\ncall she would see him with pleasure, but that she would not receive\r\nhim as the King's messenger, and that he need only write down what he\r\nhad to say. Lord Conyngham then sent her a letter, to which she\r\nreplied by an epistle of twelve pages, enumerating all her supposed\r\ngrievances against the King, and concluding with the statement that if\r\nher daughter-in-law were not received as a princess she would never\r\nset foot in the King's house again. She had several copies made of the\r\nletter, and sent them to all the members of the Cabinet. Lord\r\nConyngham, who told all this to Madame de Lieven, in spite of his Whig\r\nprinciples, went on to say that the position of the English Ministry\r\nwas unpleasant, as their relations with the King were disturbed and\r\nthey were unpopular in the country, and that the difficulties\r\nconcerning the Bank and the progress of affairs in Spain were very\r\nunpleasant incidents for the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nIt is settled that the Duc de Coigny is to be knight-of-honour to the\r\nDuchesse d'Orléans. He is naturally impolite, his habits are\r\nuncivilised, and he has only one hand, so that he will not be able to\r\noffer his hand to the Princess. An equally certain appointment is that\r\nof the Comtesse Anatole de Montesquiou as first lady to accompany the\r\nPrincess, and to take the place of the lady-of-honour, whose delicate\r\nhealth will often prevent her from performing her duties.[64] This is\r\nan excellent choice. Madame de Montesquiou is forty-six years of age,\r\nher reputation is unblemished, she has been pretty and is still\r\npleasant to look upon, her manners are quiet and simple and are the\r\nexact expression of her life and character. No better choice and no\r\nperson better suited for the position could be found.\r\n\r\n  [64] The Comtesse de Lobau.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers say that a subscription is being raised in the Chamber\r\nof Deputies to print fifty thousand copies of M. Guizot's speech. M.\r\nMartin du Nord, one of the members of the present Cabinet, has given a\r\nsubscription, and thus confirmed the generally accepted opinion that\r\nhe is secretly a Doctrinaire and a traitor to the Cabinet. Thereupon\r\nM. Molé went to the King to ask for the removal of M. Martin du Nord\r\nor to offer his own resignation. I have not yet heard the conclusion\r\nof this fresh complication.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 10, 1837._--At the time of writing yesterday I had not\r\nread the _Moniteur_, which announced the amnesty.[65] I knew that M.\r\nMolé had long been anxious to see this measure passed, but I think\r\nthat the speech of M. Thiers encouraged him in his design and\r\naccelerated the execution of it. I have heard people talking of\r\nnothing else all day. Men's minds are entirely occupied with it, and\r\ntheir attention is thus diverted from the peerage given to M. Bresson,\r\nwhich again is to be explained by this marriage. What a fortunate man\r\nhe is! Undoubtedly he is capable, but circumstances have helped him\r\nwith a speed and consistency rarely found in human destiny. To return\r\nto the great event of the amnesty, I will say that high society\r\nstrongly approves of it, the more so as it has arrived unexpectedly\r\nand not been extorted by party importunity; so it is an act of mercy,\r\nand not of weakness. The sharp-sighted regard it as another act of\r\nhostility to the Doctrinaires rather than an act of kindness to the\r\npolitical prisoners--as much as to say that the measure could not be\r\npassed while the Doctrinaires were in office, but now that we have\r\nseparated from them we hasten to grant it. This will isolate them yet\r\nmore in the country. I repeat there are people who regard this measure\r\nas a consequence of M. Thiers' speech, and even as directly due to his\r\ninfluence. The Doctrinaires are most infuriated, and those peers who\r\nare friendly to them announce that all the contumacious persons will\r\ncome up for judgment, and that the peers will then go off to their\r\ncountry seats instead of taking their places. The following story had\r\na wide circulation yesterday: M. Jaubert, in speaking of the amnesty\r\nto M. Dupin, said to him: \"It is a little hard that after leaving to\r\nus all the odium of the severe measures which we have courageously\r\ndefended during the crisis and danger we should now be deprived of the\r\ncredit of showing mercy.\" M. Dupin replied: \"It is very sad, but you\r\nhave one consolation, namely, that Persil will order the medal to be\r\nstruck.\" (M. Persil is a Doctrinaire and Comptroller of the Mint.) The\r\nsaying is a smart one. Those who approve the amnesty also urge, and\r\nwith some reason, that it will obliterate the ill-effect produced by\r\nthe excessive precautions on the day of the review.\r\n\r\n  [65] On the occasion of the marriage of the Duc d'Orléans an\r\n  amnesty was granted by ordinance dated May 8 to all who were in\r\n  prison for crimes or political delinquencies.\r\n\r\nYesterday I was at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, where Sigalon, who has\r\njust arrived from Rome, had placed the magnificent copy of the _Last\r\nJudgment_ of Michael Angelo, that masterpiece which is fading, like\r\nall the frescoes in the Vatican. The copy is the same size as the\r\noriginal, and forms the background of a hall, to which has been given\r\nthe form and dimensions of the Sistine Chapel. It is the most\r\nbeautiful and surprising thing that can be imagined. I was quite\r\noverwhelmed. Variety, richness, and boldness of composition are so\r\ncombined that one rests stupefied before the power of such genius. In\r\nthe same room have been placed casts of different statues by Michael\r\nAngelo which also have arrived from Italy, and complete one's\r\nadmiration for this great man. The statue of Lorenzo de' Medici and\r\nthe statue of Day and Night are admirable. We then saw the charming\r\ngateway to the castle of Anet and the beautiful door of the castle of\r\nGaillon, both masterpieces of the Renaissance; then came the interior\r\ncourtyard, adorned with fountains and fragments of ancient work, which\r\nwas very fine. The building in itself is in excellent style; it\r\ncontains fine models of all classes and ages of art, which will be\r\nadded to. They form a collection as curious as it is interesting, and\r\nadd a new attraction to Paris.\r\n\r\nThence we went on to the new Church of Our Lady of Loretto. It seemed\r\nto me extremely heavy and full of motley ornaments, and had it not\r\nbeen for some fine pictures I should have found little agreeable to\r\nlook at. It is said to be in the style of the Italian churches, which\r\nI do not know; but to judge from this specimen I would rather say my\r\nprayers under the lofty, bold, and austere vaults, the hewn stone and\r\nGothic arches of Notre-Dame and of Saint-Etienne du Mont, than amid\r\nthe glaring colours of this Southern imitation. We finished our\r\nwanderings by a visit to the Church of the Madeleine. The interior at\r\npresent is in exact correspondence with the outside, and it seems that\r\nCalchas is about to sacrifice Iphigenia upon it, to such an extent\r\nhave mythological subjects apparently pervaded this fine building.\r\nThey are already beginning to gild the arches and the capitals of the\r\ncolumns, pretending that the white stone, though it is much enriched\r\nby different kinds of marbling, is too cold to the eye. Thus they are\r\npreparing a disagreeable contrast between the outside and the inside.\r\nI cannot understand the vagaries of Christian worship.\r\n\r\nIn the evening at Madame de Lieven's house I saw Berryer, who does not\r\nyield to M. Royer in his admiration for M. Thiers' speech. I heard\r\nthat M. Martin du Nord had given way upon the question of his\r\nsubscription for printing Guizot's speech, as upon other points. For\r\none who calls himself a member of the Opposition, he does not seem to\r\noppose very strenuously.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 11, 1837._--Yesterday I had a call from the excellent Abbé\r\nDupanloup. We were mutually anxious to meet, in the interests of\r\nPauline, before the general departure for the country. As usual, I was\r\ntouched and pleased by his kind and spiritual conversation. We talked\r\nof our hope that the amnesty will inspire the Government with courage\r\nto reopen the Church of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois, the closing of\r\nwhich is the greatest scandal of the July revolution; seeing that acts\r\nof mercy extend from Ham to the Republic and to la Vendée, continued\r\nvindictiveness towards the church and to leave the Cross broken would\r\nseem to me most inconsistent. The church should be reopened without\r\nconsidering any difficulties that the Archbishop may raise. He should\r\nthus be forced to appoint a reliable priest, and then to go and\r\nexpress his thanks to the Tuileries, but he should set to work at once\r\nwhile the effect of the amnesty remains all-powerful; at such a moment\r\nthere is no fear of any movement in the district, and this action\r\nwould only be the strongest answer to the Doctrinaires, whose tactics\r\nare to represent the amnesty as the price of the compact made with the\r\nLeft. To reopen the Church of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois would restore\r\nthe balance. I think it would be a politic move as well as a religious\r\nrestoration; if we delay too long the religious newspapers and people\r\nwill begin to cry out, with reason, against the injustice of it, and\r\nany later action will seem like a concession to their complaints; then\r\nthe Opposition will pounce upon it and foment irritation with the\r\nmeasure. Everything, therefore, should be quite spontaneous, the\r\nreligious restoration no less than the royal mercy. I think they will\r\ntake the matter in hand; it should have been done already, in my\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 14, 1837._--The _Moniteur_ of yesterday, heaven be praised,\r\ncontains an ordinance by which the Church of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois\r\nis to be restored for worship. I am delighted. The Baron de Montmorency,\r\nwho came to see me in the morning, had dined yesterday at the Château,\r\nwhere the Queen wept with joy at the news.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I went to pay a farewell visit at the Hôtel de Broglie,\r\nwhere the amnesty was very unfavourably received, as Madame de Broglie\r\nis very anxious to fortify Princess Helena in her Protestantism.\r\n\r\nI then went on to the Duchesse de Montmorency, where I heard very bad\r\nnews of the Prince de Laval. He had caught a slight cold and had taken\r\nno care of himself, but had gone to the races at Chantilly in very\r\nbitter weather. His malady grew worse, and now causes great anxiety. I\r\nshould be grieved indeed if any misfortune happened to him, for in\r\nspite of his absurdities and foolishness he has a good heart and is a\r\ngood friend.\r\n\r\nI finished the evening with Madame de Castellane. M. Molé came in and\r\ntold us that the Archbishop, accompanied by two of his Vicars-General,\r\nhad called upon him that evening and upon the Keeper of the Seals\r\nafter a visit to the King. It seems that his appearance in the\r\nMinisterial _salons_ made a great sensation. Before his visit the\r\nArchbishop had quietly had the church blessed. Mass was said there\r\nthis morning. A week will be spent in necessary repairs, and next\r\nSunday the new vicar will be installed. As M. Dupanloup has refused\r\nthis post, the choice has fallen upon M. Demerson, the priest of\r\nSaint-Séverin, undoubtedly the most distinguished ecclesiastic in the\r\ndiocese. He is the confessor of Madame Andral, and the friend of her\r\nfather. M. Royer-Collard has often spoken to me of him and thinks a\r\ngreat deal of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 15, 1837._--Yesterday evening I was at the Tuileries. I\r\nfound the King delighted with a visit that he had paid in the morning\r\nto the Botanical Gardens to see the new hothouses they have been\r\nsetting up. He was well applauded as he went by; in short, he seems to\r\nhave grown young again. Everybody about him is well pleased. He went\r\nthere without an escort, and spent two hours walking with the Minister\r\nof the Interior and of Education, with the Prefect of Police and one\r\n_aide-de-camp_. The crowd kept on increasing, and these gentlemen, who\r\nsaw all the horrible faces from the Rue Mouffetard and that quarter\r\nthronging round the King, were dying with fear, but the King was\r\ndelighted, and it was impossible to induce him to go indoors. He was\r\nmost heartily cheered by all the crowd. I think, however, that it\r\nwould not be advisable for him often to make such trials of his\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 16, 1837._--The Prince de Laval is not getting on well. He\r\nhas been bled a second time, and the doctors say that his condition is\r\nserious.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that M. Dupanloup is ambitious; I do not know him well\r\nenough to be positive. He is gentle, discreet, moderate, with a\r\nknowledge of the world, a fine command of language and conversational\r\ntact, and, in short, possesses every quality which the spiritual\r\ndirector of a society personage should have. All his penitents and all\r\ntheir mothers think a great deal of him. But this does not exclude\r\nambition. I know that he lays great stress upon keeping apart from\r\npolitics, but when confronted with the Archbishop he committed the\r\nvenial sin of urging him to go to the Tuileries and of going with him\r\nto the incumbent of Saint-Roch, whose curate and friend he is. But the\r\nrobe of ambition is like the chameleon's skin, the colours of which\r\nchange according to the observer's position. I can therefore answer\r\nfor nothing except that he has refused two important livings at Paris.\r\nI know that the Archbishop secretly destines him for the Madeleine\r\nwhen that living becomes vacant, and, in fact, it is a society parish\r\nwhich will suit him best.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 18, 1837._--Yesterday morning I was with Madame Adélaïde,\r\nwhere I saw the King. Every one at the Château is busy with\r\npreparations for the marriage and for the journey from Fontainebleau,\r\nwhich is to be a splendid affair. I am delighted, and should be still\r\nmore so if I had not heard that not only the mothers but also the\r\ndaughters are expected. I have done my best to have my daughter\r\nexcused, to avoid the infinite vexations which I foresee, but M. de\r\nTalleyrand came in to Madame in the middle of our discussion, and\r\ninstead of supporting my views he opposed me. It is very annoying.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 19, 1837._--The death of the poor young Count Putbus is a\r\nvery sad event for his family and for the unfortunate Countess Buol. I\r\nam very sorry for her, and her husband seems to me to be wanting in\r\nfeeling and tact. In his position with reference to his wife, he may\r\nseparate from her with as much uproar as he pleases, but if he will\r\nnot do so from pecuniary considerations he should behave himself\r\nquietly or at least humanely. In any case I assert that for her it is\r\nbetter to lament her lover as dead than faithless, and that, unhappy\r\nas she is, she would be still more so if Count Putbus had abandoned\r\nher. A woman's danger when she finds her lover faithless is that she\r\nmay be roused to vengeance and may lose those illusions which shelter\r\nher, not only against faults, but against hardness of heart and\r\nfrivolity, properly so called. Death leaves us all our illusions, and\r\neven encourages them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 21, 1837._--M. de Talleyrand, M. and Madame de Valençay,\r\nPauline, and myself are invited to stay at Fontainebleau throughout\r\nthe festivities--that is to say, we are to come on May 29 and to stay\r\ntill June 3, inclusive. This is a favour, as nearly everybody else has\r\nbeen invited at successive intervals of twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nOne of my German friends, a canoness, and a clever and intelligent\r\nperson,[66] writes to me as follows concerning the Princess Helena of\r\nMecklenburg: \"The most amiable, the best educated, the kindest of the\r\nGerman princesses is to adorn the throne of France. I am sure that she\r\nwill please you greatly. She is as cheerful as a child of fifteen,\r\nwith as much sense as a person of thirty. She combines the charm of\r\nevery age.\"\r\n\r\n  [66] Fräulein Sidonie von Dieskau, of whom mention will be made\r\n  later on the occasion of the Duchesse de Talleyrand's journey to\r\n  Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Praslin and the Duke of Treviso are the two\r\nknights-of-honour in subordination to the uncivilised Duc de Coigny,\r\nwho will lead them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 22, 1837._--The Duc d'Orléans will first go to Verdun, to\r\nsee without being seen, and then to Melun to be seen. Henry IV. in\r\ndisguise went to the frontier to see Marie de Medici at supper, and\r\nLouis XIV. did the same at Fontarabia.\r\n\r\nAmong the persons invited to Fontainebleau there is one who certainly\r\ncould not have been forgotten, in my opinion, and this is the great\r\nMlle. Palmyre, the famous dressmaker. The fact is that she has been\r\nworking upon a pattern sent from Mecklenburg, but I am by no means\r\ncertain that this pattern is a good one or well made. Thus the eighty\r\ndresses of the trousseau may fit badly, and it is just as well to have\r\nsome one there to make readjustments when necessary. Merchants,\r\nworkmen, omnibuses, and post-chaises are all in confusion; the\r\nexpenditure, the orders, and the activity are inconceivable. It is\r\nimpossible to get anything, and tradesmen certainly have not the right\r\nto complain, for every one is on the move. A crowd of foreigners have\r\nalso arrived at Paris, most of them English.\r\n\r\nThe Werther family have resolved to leave immediately after the\r\nmarriage of the Prince Royal, without waiting for the festivities, for\r\nHerr von Werther has agreed to take M. Ancillon's place. They are very\r\ngood people, who will be regretted at Paris, and who are also very\r\nsorry to leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 25, 1837._--For the 29th and 30th, the days of arrival and\r\nmarriage, the Marshals have been invited to Fontainebleau, with the\r\nofficials of the two Chambers, the Ministries of October 11, February\r\n22, September 6, and all the present Cabinet. I have always said that\r\nFontainebleau was a chronological castle. It was resolved not to go\r\nfurther back than October 11, to avoid the necessity of inviting M.\r\nLaffitte. All the chief presidents of the courts have also been\r\ninvited, and of the Diplomatic Body Herr and Frau von Werther,[67] M.\r\nand Madame Lehon.[68] The rest are invited for the other days, two at\r\na time.\r\n\r\n  [67] Baron Werther was Prussian Minister at Paris from 1824.\r\n\r\n  [68] Comte Lehon was Belgian Minister.\r\n\r\nI must mention an incident concerning Madame Molé, who vegetates\r\nrather than lives. The other evening at the Duchesse de Montmorency's\r\npeople were saying how sorry the Werthers were. She asked why. \"At\r\nleaving Paris, of course.\" She replied: \"But to go to Fontainebleau is\r\nnot very sad nor very tiring.\" \"But, madame, Herr von Werther is going\r\nto Berlin to take the place of M. Ancillon.\" \"Oh, then M. Ancillon is\r\ncoming here?\" I do not think that after such an experience any one\r\nwill accuse M. Molé of betraying diplomatic secrets to his wife.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of England has written a charming letter to the French Queen\r\nconcerning the marriage of the Prince Royal, and, in view of her close\r\nrelationship with Princess Helena, has sent her a magnificent Indian\r\nshawl, one of the most beautiful that has ever come out of the wealthy\r\nstorehouses of the Company. It is said to be a marvel. I shall see it\r\nat Fontainebleau, where the wedding presents will be displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, May 26, 1837._--The King of England held the last Drawing-room\r\nseated; since then he has felt worse, and people are anxious about\r\nhim. It is said that he wished to live long enough to thwart the\r\ndesires of the Duchess of Kent, by not leaving her to act as Regent\r\nfor a single day, and the Princess Victoria attained her majority two\r\ndays ago.\r\n\r\nThey say that anarchy is at its height at Madrid, and also that Don\r\nCarlos is at his wits' end.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Broglie and the gentlemen of his suite are writing\r\nenthusiastic letters about the Princess Helena. All say that she has a\r\nvery pleasant appearance; all seem to be in love with her, and cannot\r\nspeak enough of her delightful manners, while she is said to be\r\nexcellently dressed. The trousseau, which has been ordered here, is\r\nsaid to be very magnificent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fontainebleau, May 30, 1837._--Writing here is a feat of some\r\ningenuity. The weather was too fine yesterday, and a great storm\r\nfollowed; it burst in the morning, and cleared ten minutes before the\r\narrival of the Princess, who was received in bright sunlight and with\r\nmuch emotion. Her arrival was a fine spectacle; a family scene amid\r\nthe most royal splendour. The Princess showed much emotion, no\r\nembarrassment, nobility and grace, and was equal to the occasion. I do\r\nnot know if she is pretty; she is so gracious that people have not\r\nconsidered that point. She reminds one a little of Madame de\r\nMarescalchi, but is of a much more German type, while the lower part\r\nof her face recedes a trifle. She has beautiful hair, a good\r\ncomplexion--in short, she looks very well, and the Prince Royal is\r\nwell pleased.\r\n\r\nPauline never left my side even at dinner, to which I was taken in by\r\nthe Baron von Werther. He was placed between the Grand Duchess of\r\nMecklenburg and myself. M. de Talleyrand was far from well yesterday,\r\nyet by force of will he kept a smiling countenance. I was very anxious\r\nabout him the whole time.\r\n\r\nUntil to-morrow we shall number two hundred and eighty at table.\r\nYesterday the day began for me at half-past five in the morning at\r\nParis, and finished here at one o'clock at night. At ten o'clock I\r\nmust be fully dressed for the Queen's mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fontainebleau, May 31, 1837._--The two most exhausting days have\r\npassed, for which I thank heaven, as I have been trembling the whole\r\ntime for M. de Talleyrand, who has been so incredibly rash as to\r\nundergo these severe trials. However, he has seen everything, and has\r\ncome through with little more than fatigue.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to be correct follow the Queen to her private mass in\r\nthe morning. Pauline has just taken me into a charming little chapel,\r\nin memory of Louis VII., the Young.\r\n\r\nThe two German princesses were not visible yesterday for the whole\r\nmorning. The time before dinner was filled up by walks, for those who\r\nwere tempted, of whom I was not one, and the inspection of the\r\nwedding presents for the rest, of whom I was one. The presents and the\r\ndresses are most fine and magnificent, especially the case by Buhl\r\nwhich contained the shawls, which was one of the finest things I have\r\nseen. The whole was exhibited in the rooms of the Queen Mother. The\r\ndiamonds are beautiful, and the jewels numerous, in different styles,\r\nbut there are no pearls. The Duc d'Orléans does not like them, and the\r\nPrincess can also wear the Crown pearls.\r\n\r\nThe royal family dined in private. Madame de Dolomieu and General\r\nAthalin presided at the table of two hundred and eighty guests in the\r\nDiana Gallery. Pauline was again near me at dinner, and M. Thiers on\r\nthe other side.\r\n\r\nAt half-past eight the civil marriage took place in the room of Henry\r\nII., a superb spectacle in the most beautiful surroundings imaginable,\r\nand magnificently lighted. The Chancellor, M. Pasquier, who was\r\nrecently appointed to this post, was in his ermine robes at a great\r\nred and gold table, around which stood all who were witnessing the\r\nceremony, with the bridal pair in front of him. We made our way there\r\nin procession. Then we went on to the great chapel, ornamented with\r\nthe shields of France and Navarre. The exhortation given by the Bishop\r\nof Meaux[69] was both short and well weighed. Unfortunately, in the\r\ncase of mixed marriages many ceremonies have to be omitted which would\r\nadd to the picturesqueness of the scene. The priest of Fontainebleau,\r\nwho is the famous Abbé Lieutard, and hitherto one of the chief\r\nopponents of the present Government, assisted the Bishop, and even\r\nclaimed to do so as a right. The hall, which was arranged as a\r\nProtestant church, could hardly hold us, and the crowd was\r\nsuffocating; the exhortation of the pastor, M. Cuvier, was very long\r\nand very dull, going back to the creation of the world, with continual\r\nreferences to procreation. It was puritanism itself. Before the\r\nblessing he asked the bride permission to perform a duty with which he\r\nhad been entrusted by the Biblical Society, and offered her a Bible,\r\nin which he urged her to read constantly. I thought the act quite out\r\nof place at such a moment, and very disrespectful to the Queen, who is\r\nmaking a great sacrifice from the religious point of view.\r\n\r\n  [69] Mgr. Gallard.\r\n\r\nThe Princess was perfectly calm the whole time; I noticed no\r\nnervousness, and less emotion than at the time of her arrival. She was\r\nperfectly well dressed. Unfortunately she has no colour, and thus\r\nwants a certain lustre, but in spite of her thinness she is graceful\r\nand charmingly simple. Her feet are long and well made and her hands\r\nare white and delicate; in short, she is a person of much attraction.\r\n\r\nAfter all these ceremonies we separated. I went to look after M. de\r\nTalleyrand, about whom I was anxious, and whom I found very well. M.\r\nMolé came in, in a bad temper. It is indeed strange that throughout\r\nthis affair he has obtained no favours of any kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fontainebleau, June 1, 1837._--There is no political news to be\r\nlearnt here. The Princes are absorbed in themselves; M. de Salvandy,\r\nthe only Minister on duty near the King, is in the same state.\r\nCuriosity is turned away from politics, and there is enough here to\r\narouse it and satisfy it.\r\n\r\nYesterday was spent as follows: After lunch came a very long drive in\r\nthe forest; twenty-six carriages, each with four horses, the great\r\nroyal coach with eight horses, and then eighty riding horses, all\r\nconducted by the richly liveried servants of Orléans, were assembled\r\nin the great courtyard of the Cheval Blanc, and provided a general\r\nopportunity for excursions. We hastened to follow the King and to\r\ntraverse the most beautiful parts of the forest. Many sightseers who\r\nwere seen galloping most imprudently among the rocks joined the royal\r\nprocession, and gave the wood an animated and charming aspect.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say that lunch had been preceded by a mass said by the\r\nBishop of Meaux in the great chapel. Every one was there, including\r\nthe royal family and the Duchesse d'Orléans. I should have been glad\r\nyesterday, when there was no mixed marriage to consider and when only\r\nthe King's mass was being said, if the service had been finely\r\nrendered with appropriate music. Instead of that there was nothing of\r\nthe kind; there were no clergy and not a sound of music; even the bell\r\nfor the moment of elevation was forgotten. Methodists display much\r\nmore trickery in their pretentious simplicity and their affected and\r\nsolemn speech; but at mass, where the words cannot be heard, outward\r\nshow is necessary, with incense, music, flowers, gold, and bells, and\r\nall that can stir the soul by uplifting it to God without the\r\nnecessity of hearing the words pronounced.\r\n\r\nMany people have gone and others have come, including the Turkish\r\nAmbassador,[70] who sat by Pauline at dinner. The theatre hall has not\r\nbeen restored, and looks faded; the orchestra, which was not from\r\nParis, was abominable; Mlle. Mars has grown old, and no longer played\r\nher parts properly; the other actors were very poor, and the choice of\r\nplays was not happy. These were _False Confidences_ and _The\r\nUnexpected Wager_. The Princess Royal was in the great box at the back\r\nof the hall, between the King and Queen. She listened attentively, but\r\nher face does not express her feelings, and does not change. She is\r\nalways gentle and calm to the point of immobility, and makes no\r\ngestures, which is a mark of distinction. Perfect repose gives a sense\r\nof dignity, and when she walks or bows she does it with perfect grace.\r\n\r\n  [70] His Excellency Mohammed Nouri Effendi.\r\n\r\nM. Humann, when he went away yesterday, was run away with by the\r\npost-horses down the hill of Chailly. He jumped out of the carriage,\r\nbruised his face, and put his shoulder out.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fontainebleau, June 2, 1837._--Yesterday was not so full as the\r\npreceding days, as after mass, lunch, and the gathering after lunch,\r\nwe were left with a few hours' freedom. I spent them with M. de\r\nTalleyrand or in the town. M. de Talleyrand went to see Madame\r\nAdélaïde, to whom he wished to give a piece of news which reached us\r\nfrom the Bauffremont family, who were interested by it, and which, to\r\nspeak truly, has produced a sad effect here. It is the announcement of\r\nthe marriage of the Count of Syracuse, brother to the King of Naples,\r\nwith Philiberte de Carignan. This young person is the granddaughter of\r\nthe Comte de Villefranche, the prince of the house of Carignan who\r\nmarried, in a fit of folly, the daughter of a boat-builder at St.\r\nMalo, Mlle. Magon Laballue. The Sardinian Court only consented to\r\nrecognise the marriage on condition that the children of it should\r\nenter religious orders; the revolution destroyed this obligation, and\r\nthe son entered the army and married Mlle. de La Vauguyon, sister of\r\nthe Dowager-Duchess of Bauffremont, who was burnt to death in 1820. It\r\nwas only after her death and the accession of the present King of\r\nSardinia that the last two children were recognised as princes of the\r\nblood and treated as such. The eldest daughter was married before this\r\nconcession to a private individual of high family, the Prince of\r\nArsoli, a Roman family. Philiberte, the daughter and granddaughter of\r\nmarriages contested or doubtful, thus becomes Princess of Naples. The\r\nmarriage, by licence, must have taken place the day before yesterday\r\nwith much haste and precipitation. The displeasure it will cause here\r\nis obvious. The King of Naples is at the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nYesterday after dinner we went to hear Duprez in part of the opera\r\n_William Tell_, and the Esslers danced in a pretty ballet. I was\r\nsurprised that the Princess Royal never lost her calm, even at the\r\nmost exciting points of Duprez' acting. I never saw a movement of her\r\nhead, a gesture, or any greater animation in her face. The same was\r\ntrue during the ballet, which I can better understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fontainebleau, June 3, 1837._--M. de Talleyrand started this morning\r\nwith Pauline. They wish to keep me here until to-morrow. No one could\r\nhave been surrounded with greater regard and attention than has been\r\nshown to M. de Talleyrand; he was quite overcome as he went away. The\r\nKing and Madame Adélaïde have insisted that he shall return to Paris\r\nfor next winter, but I do not think that he will give up his project\r\nof going to Nice.\r\n\r\nPauline's stay here has done her no harm. She has always behaved\r\nperfectly and pleased me much. She was delighted to be in the same\r\nroom with me. Her dress was in excellent taste, and she has gone away\r\nvery pleased to have been here, but also glad to go and in no way\r\ndissipated in heart or mind.\r\n\r\nNearly every one has gone, and only those on regular duty and intimate\r\nfriends remain. I am starting to-morrow at the same time as the Queen\r\nand the Duchesse d'Albuféra, who came here yesterday. The country\r\ndrive was very pretty, animated and popular. We then went into the\r\nprettiest part of the forest, called the Calvaire, whence there is an\r\nadmirable view. From the depths of the ravines over which we hung\r\nsingers who had been stationed there raised their song. It was\r\ndelightful, and the weather, wonderful to relate, lent such a charm to\r\nthe drive that it was prolonged. We eventually returned past the large\r\nvine arbour and the canal.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we had a tiresome comic opera, _The Flash_, followed by\r\n_The Caliph of Bagdad_, for which the King had asked as an old\r\nfavourite. It was very late before this was over, and as I stayed up\r\nwith M. de Talleyrand my sleep was cut short, the more so as his early\r\ndeparture obliged me to be ready in good time. The King and Madame\r\ncame to say good-bye to him in his room. After lunch the King amused\r\nhimself by showing the Château to three or four guests. I was\r\ndelighted both with the Château and with our guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, June 5, 1837._--I came back yesterday from Fontainebleau. Mass\r\nwas said at six o'clock in the morning, and then the departure took\r\nplace. I was included in the royal company, and thus arrived in\r\nexcellent time, not leaving them until they turned off for\r\nSaint-Cloud. The last day at Fontainebleau, the day before yesterday,\r\nwas occupied much to my taste, by a historical excursion, and in the\r\nevening we had a theatrical performance by actors from the Gymnasium.\r\nThe whole stay at Fontainebleau was very pleasant, as I received much\r\nattention and kindness.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I arrived yesterday I went to the Champs Elysées to Madame\r\nde Flahaut's house; she had urgently begged me to come and see the\r\nroyal entry, for which the weather was magnificent. There was a vast\r\ncrowd and a most brilliant procession, the Princess bowing with\r\nperfect grace. The view from the Place Louis XV. and the Champs\r\nElysées was magnificent. All went off very well, but there was not\r\nenough cheering and more curiosity than enthusiasm. People opened\r\ntheir eyes but not their mouths. The main point is that there were no\r\npistol-shots, and that the King was able to show himself to the crowd\r\nwithout any _apparent_ precautions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, June 6, 1837._--Yesterday I saw M. Royer-Collard, who was\r\nsomewhat displeased with the marriage of the Prince Royal, as a man of\r\nthe Faubourg Saint-Germain might well be. I was vexed with him, and we\r\nhad a small quarrel. He is partial in his views, and his conversation\r\nis intolerant to an extraordinary degree.\r\n\r\nThe day before yesterday in the garden of the Tuileries there were\r\nmore than sixty thousand people present from eleven o'clock in the\r\nmorning to eleven at night, and such real enthusiasm that the King was\r\nobliged to leave his state dinner in the Hall of the Marshals and come\r\nout upon the balcony with his family, whence he uttered a few words of\r\nthanks, which were received with infinite delight. From the moment of\r\nentering the garden until the march past of the troops the royal\r\nfamily remained in the Pavillon de l'Horloge, whence there was a\r\nmagnificent view. The setting sun gilded the top of the Obelisk and\r\nthe Arc de Triomphe, and was reflected upon the arms and cuirasses of\r\nthe troops; the benches of the National Guard were adorned with\r\nflowers. I am assured that it was a real transformation scene.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be much inclination towards a dissolution of the\r\nChamber, at any rate on the part of M. Molé. M. Royer-Collard is\r\nvigorously urging him in that direction.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish Ambassador here can speak a few words of French. This\r\ndiscovery is due to myself, for every one took his professed ignorance\r\nso literally as not to speak a word to him. He looked so dull that I\r\nfelt sorry for him, and made a venture. He replied in a few words, and\r\nthe result is that I have been allowed to see the portrait of Sultan\r\nMahmoud, who seems to be very handsome.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, June 7, 1837._--Yesterday I called upon the Queen to thank her\r\nfor Fontainebleau. The Duchesse d'Orléans was with her mother-in-law,\r\ngracious, pretty, and amiable. She is a real treasure, and is\r\ngenerally popular. She delighted the Council of State, the peers, and\r\nthe Deputies by adding a kind phrase to the answer which her husband\r\nreturned to the different speeches. She has spoken individually to\r\neach peer, and never in commonplaces. They are all delighted.\r\n\r\nMy awakening this morning was a sad one, as news was brought to me of\r\nthe death of Adrien de Laval. He was a sincere friend, and they are\r\nscarce. I am very sorry, both for him and for his aunt the good\r\nVicomtesse de Laval, who is hardly able to bear such a shock; and if\r\nshe also should be carried off it would be a heavy blow to M. de\r\nTalleyrand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, June 8, 1837._--The popularity of the Princess Royal increases\r\nsteadily. She has even been talking to General Neigre, of the Antwerp\r\nArtillery. The Duc d'Orléans is extremely proud and happy at the\r\nrespect shown to her. It is certain that the personal influence of his\r\nwife increases his own importance, and I already see that the Pavillon\r\nMarsan will rise superior to the Pavillon de Flore.[71] I am not sure\r\nthat some small jealousy has not already arisen.\r\n\r\n  [71] At the Palace of the Tuileries the Pavillon Marsan was\r\n  occupied by the Duc and Duchesse d'Orléans, while the Pavillon de\r\n  Flore was occupied by Madame Adélaïde, sister of King\r\n  Louis-Philippe.\r\n\r\nThe following story is related as a fact: The Duchesse d'Orléans saw\r\nher husband turn his opera-glasses for a long time in the direction of\r\nMadame Lehon. She then turned to him and took away the opera-glasses,\r\nsaying, half jestingly and half seriously: \"That is no compliment to\r\nme, and is not polite to the person at whom you look.\" He is said to\r\nhave offered no objection to her action, and if this is true it is\r\nnoteworthy.\r\n\r\nM. de Flahaut is furious because he has not received the Grand Cordon\r\nof the Legion of Honour. He had proposed to resign his post as First\r\nEquerry, but has changed his mind. It is said that the Duc de Coigny\r\nrefuses him any authority except over the stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, June 11, 1837._--I cannot give many details concerning\r\nyesterday's festivity at Versailles. I started about one o'clock in\r\nfull dress, with the Duchesse d'Albuféra, and we came back together\r\nat four o'clock in the morning. The weather was beautiful, the spot\r\nadmirable, the gardens in regal state, the inside of the house\r\nsplendid, and the sight magnificent. It lasted for five hours. My eyes\r\nare smarting with the glare of the lights. Fifteen hundred people were\r\ninvited, and yet some are displeased; I admit that I should have drawn\r\nup the lists in another way.\r\n\r\nI had the honour of dining at the King's table, for whom it was a\r\ngreat day. At the last set piece there was a tremendous shout of \"Long\r\nlive the King!\" and it was well deserved.\r\n\r\nCount Rantzau, who is escorting the Dowager Grand Duchess of\r\nMecklenburg, was deeply touched to see in an honourable position the\r\nportrait of Marshal Rantzau, who served under Louis XIV., and whose\r\ndescendant he is. He sat by me at dinner, and I drew a great deal out\r\nof him concerning the Princesses, whom I esteem more highly every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, June 12, 1837._--I am starting to-morrow to rejoin M. de\r\nTalleyrand at Valençay.\r\n\r\nThe King of England is most seriously ill, and is only kept alive with\r\ncuraçao and raw meat. He knows that he is dying, and is calling his\r\nfamily round him: the FitzClarences, and even Lord Munster. Mr.\r\nCaradoc is said to be taking Sir John Conroy's place with the Duchess\r\nof Kent. He sends for presents for her, the cost of which is paid by\r\nthe Princess Bagration. It is said that if the King dies the Duchess\r\nof Kent will summon Lord Moira to the post of Prime Minister, who is a\r\ngreat Radical; others say that King Leopold is advising his niece to\r\ntake Lord Palmerston, but the little Princess is inclined to Lord\r\nGrey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 14, 1837._--I have just arrived, after a tiring\r\njourney in dreadful heat and two thunderstorms. M. de Talleyrand is\r\nvery well, as also is Pauline.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 17, 1837._--Madame Adélaïde has sent M. de Talleyrand\r\ndetails of the accidents which took place upon the day of the\r\nfireworks; twenty-three persons were suffocated in the crowd and\r\nthirty-nine are injured. This has naturally caused much grief. The\r\nDuchesse d'Orléans was anxious not to go to the entertainment at the\r\nHôtel de Ville and to cancel the balls; but it was pointed out to her\r\nthat many people would be disappointed and much expense needlessly\r\nincurred. Festivities have therefore been postponed until after the\r\nfuneral of the victims.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the fireworks, the illuminations, and especially the\r\nsham fight, were remarkably beautiful. Popular festivities are hardly\r\never held without accidents, and I am always afraid of them. The\r\nvictims all belong to the working class, which makes their case still\r\nsadder, and some of them leave their families in poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 18, 1837._--Pauline has made a conquest of the\r\nArchbishop of Bourges, Mgr. de Villèle, who called here before my\r\narrival. She is said to have done the honours of the Castle remarkably\r\nwell, with unusual self-possession, grace, and propriety. I am not\r\nsorry that she was obliged to try.\r\n\r\nConsiderable restorations are being made in our great castle. The\r\nnorthern part of the moat has been cleaned out, and the wretched\r\nlittle gardens which blocked the approach to it have been cleared\r\naway; there is now a walk all the way round. The belfry upon the town\r\nchurch looks very well, and in general the place seems improved.\r\n\r\nHostile newspapers try to draw comparisons between the accidents at\r\nthe fireworks and the sad scenes upon the marriage of Louis XVI., and\r\nthe catastrophe at the Schwarzenberg ball at the time of the Emperor\r\nNapoleon's marriage. They draw omens from these coincidences. But what\r\nmore disastrous coincidence could there be for the elder branch of the\r\nBourbons than the assassination of the Duc de Berry and the revolution\r\nof 1830? Yet no misfortune happened at the marriage of this Prince. It\r\nis not in consequence of such special incidents that kings lose their\r\nthrones.\r\n\r\nThe Municipal Council at Paris has voted a hundred and fifty thousand\r\nfrancs for the further expenses of the festivity. Everything is on so\r\nlarge a scale that the hire of glasses and water-bottles costs four\r\nthousand francs. Ices and refreshments to the amount of twenty\r\nthousand francs were distributed on the day when the festival was\r\npostponed to the workmen and to the hospitals. The patients will have\r\na feast, and smart sayings are in circulation concerning the\r\nindigestion they are likely to get.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 19, 1837._--A German newspaper has a story of a vision\r\nwhich the Duchesse d'Orléans is said to have seen, and speaks of her\r\nidea of playing the part of a second Joan of Arc. All this is\r\ndoubtless ridiculous; at the same time there is some mysticism in her\r\ndesire to come to France, for M. Bresson, the most prosaic of men, has\r\nseveral times told me this: \"She thinks she has a vocation, and has\r\nseen a special call of Providence in this marriage proposal; her\r\nmother-in-law, who is inclined to the Pietist sect, was swayed by the\r\nsame idea.\"\r\n\r\nThe following has also been told me by Count Rantzau: Upon the day\r\nwhen he learnt of Meunier's attempted assassination of the King,\r\nnegotiations for the marriage had been already opened. He was unable\r\nto hide from the Princess his fear of the fate towards which she was\r\ninclined. She then replied: \"Stop, sir; the news that you give me, far\r\nfrom shaking my will, only confirms it. Providence has perhaps\r\ndestined me to receive a shot intended for the King, and thus to save\r\nhis life. I shall not shrink from my mission.\"\r\n\r\nThere is thus a strong strain of fanaticism in her, which in no way\r\nspoils her extreme simplicity of manner or the remarkable calm of her\r\nbearing. This is so unusual a combination that I have been more struck\r\nby it than by any of her other good qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 22, 1837._--Madame Adélaïde has written a long letter\r\nto M. de Talleyrand, with full details of the entertainment at the\r\nTown Hall, which seems to have been the most beautiful thing of this\r\nkind, and far more magnificent than anything else that has yet been\r\ndone. The King was admirably received as he passed through the streets\r\nand at the Town Hall. There were five thousand persons at this\r\nentertainment. Princess Helena thought the diorama of Ludwiglust[72]\r\nperfectly like the original.\r\n\r\n  [72] The Castle of Mecklenburg, where the princess had been\r\n  brought up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 25, 1837._--So the old King of England is dead. I was\r\ninterested to read the manner in which the young Queen was proclaimed\r\nat London, in her own presence from the balcony of St. James's Palace.\r\nThis beautiful and touching scene is marked by a very pleasing\r\nrestraint.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 28, 1837._--A widely circulated rumour at Paris\r\nasserts that Mr. Caradoc intends to secure a divorce from Princess\r\nBagration--an easy process; that he will be made a peer and will\r\nbecome the husband of the young Queen. He asserts his descent from the\r\nKings of Ireland. All this I believe to be nonsense, but meanwhile the\r\nyoung Queen is so charmed with him that she will do and say nothing\r\nwithout his consent.\r\n\r\nHere is another story: Charles X. had given the Duc de Maillé a\r\npicture for the church of Lormois; the family has just sold it to a\r\ndealer for fifty-three thousand francs; the result has been a dispute\r\nwith the Civil List officials, who assert that Charles X. had no right\r\nto present the picture. Pamphlets have been printed setting forth the\r\ncase on either side. If the dealer is obliged to restore the picture\r\nhe will force the Maillé family to return the fifty-three thousand\r\nfrancs. Apart from this picture, the family found that the inheritance\r\nof the Duc de Maillé consisted solely of debts. It is certain that if\r\nthe picture came from one of the museums or one of the royal castles\r\nCharles X. had no right to give it away. It is all very unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, June 29, 1837._--M. de Sémonville was introduced in the\r\nevening by the Queen herself to the Duchesse d'Orléans at the Round\r\nTable. He told the Princess that only the kindness of the Queen could\r\nhave induced him to show her so old a face. \"You mean so old a\r\nreputation,\" replied the Princess. The old cat sheathed his claws and\r\nwas pleased.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, July 1, 1837._--I hear from Paris that the situation of\r\npublic affairs is regarded as satisfactory at the moment, although the\r\nMinisterial elections have generally shown opposition. At Strasburg,\r\nGrenoble, and Montpellier they were absolutely Republican. Many people\r\nassert that the Ministry should dissolve the Chamber, as it is worn\r\nout. They urge that the marriage of the Prince Royal and the amnesty\r\nmake the present moment favourable, that later on circumstances will\r\nnot, perhaps, be so advantageous, but that the King refuses to\r\nconsider the idea. M. Royer-Collard writes to me on the same subject:\r\n\"I think that M. Molé is inclined to dissolution, and the King, though\r\nhe will not yet accept it, will be led to it by force of\r\ncircumstances. The Chamber is exhausted and can carry on no longer.\"\r\nAs a postscript he adds: \"I have had a long interview with M. Molé,\r\nand I am to see him again; he has decided to propose, and therefore to\r\ncarry out, the plan of dissolution. I did not urge him, but I am of\r\nhis opinion. The Chamber can no longer go on, and a dissolution need\r\nonly be desired and accepted to become necessary.\"\r\n\r\nFinally Madame de Lieven writes to me as follows immediately before\r\nstarting for England: \"M. de Flahaut was anxious to secure the\r\ncomplimentary mission to London. He has been obliged to give way to\r\nGeneral Baudrand, which has increased the bad temper both of the\r\nhusband and the wife. Sébastiani is so ill that he is useless at\r\nLondon; I really do not know who keeps your Court informed. Madame de\r\nFlahaut is working as hard as she can to secure the recall of\r\nGranville from Paris and the appointment of Lord Durham to his post,\r\nwith the double idea of removing a competitor from Palmerston's path\r\nand having an ambassador at Paris inclined to intrigue. Granville's\r\nchief merit was that he had no such tendency. In my opinion Durham\r\nwill have to have his way, as he will no longer stay at St. Petersburg\r\nand wants something better. Your Deputies are said to be dispersing in\r\nuneasiness and discontent. M. Molé says that he wants a dissolution,\r\nbut that the King does not.\r\n\r\n\"M. Molé's last reception was well attended. A hundred and fifty\r\ndeputies came to M. Guizot's party. M. Thiers has written from Lucca\r\nthat his wife suffered severely from sea-sickness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, July 6, 1837._--The following is an extract from a letter\r\nfrom Madame de Lieven dated from Boulogne: \"I have seen M. Molé and\r\nM. Guizot at the last moment; the former had received a letter from\r\nBarante. My Sovereign's ill-temper is in no way improved, and is even\r\nworse than before. It is a hopeless case, as he is going mad. M. Molé\r\nis certainly jealous of Guizot. I have some very amusing things to\r\ntell you on that subject, which have all happened since your\r\ndeparture. There are some strange characters in the world, and as I\r\nnaturally have a sense of humour, I laugh.\"\r\n\r\nI should like to know the details of this rivalry, which seems to me\r\nso improbable, from the nature of its object, that I am inclined to\r\nthink the Princess has been led astray by feminine vanity. She\r\nconfuses jealousy with the susceptibility native to character.\r\n\r\nI have a letter from Baron de Montmorency, the executor of the Prince\r\nde Laval, telling me that the latter, in a pencilled note, written the\r\nevening before his death, has left me a souvenir which he is sending\r\nme. I am deeply touched by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 11, 1837._--I arrived here yesterday, and am obliged\r\nto go out on business. The valley of the Loire is superb. The spring\r\nis late this year, and the foliage is therefore unusually green for\r\nthis season. My plants have all grown very well, the climbers\r\nespecially, and the flowers are abundant; everything seems in\r\nexcellent order.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 12, 1837._--Yesterday I went round my house; small\r\nimprovements are slowly being carried out.\r\n\r\nI was much struck by the effect of the Sistine Madonna in the\r\ndrawing-room, which has taken the place of the Corinne, which has gone\r\nto the drawing-room of the Abbé's house. The change is almost\r\nsymbolical, and shows the difference between the spirit of my past and\r\nthat which now dominates me, or, to speak more accurately, is gaining\r\nground; progress is by no means rapid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, July 13, 1837._--Yesterday it only rained for half the\r\nday, and I was able to go round my little empire, which I found in\r\nvery good condition. I shall be sorry presently to tear myself away\r\nfrom it. I propose to dine and sleep at Tours, and shall be back at\r\nValençay to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI was able yesterday to visit my hydraulic rams.[73] Nothing takes up\r\nless room or produces a better result. Many workmen come to see them,\r\nand several landowners wish to imitate them; it is really an admirable\r\ninvention. I have now water for the kitchen, the stables, and\r\neverywhere, and next year I shall present myself with a fire-engine.\r\n\r\n  [73] As Rochecotte was without any water-supply, and the hillside\r\n  upon which the castle was built was quite bare, hydraulic rams\r\n  were introduced. These were the first imported to France. The\r\n  Duchesse de Dino had them made in England, and insisted that\r\n  French measures should be transposed exactly into English, and\r\n  English into French, with the result that when they were set up\r\n  at Rochecotte, where they still stand, the measurements were\r\n  found to be exact.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, July 15, 1837._--I left Tours yesterday morning. Before\r\nstarting I saw the sad sight of a man killed by lightning. His\r\ncompanion only had his legs broken, and was being taken to the\r\nhospital for a double amputation.\r\n\r\nI had lunch at Loches, where I visited everything: the tomb of Agnès\r\nSorel, the oratory of Anne of Brittany, and a curious church, the\r\nprison of Ludovico Sforza. I admired the magnificent panorama from the\r\ntop of the towers. We then stopped at Montrésor, to inspect one of the\r\nprettiest Renaissance churches I have seen. It is built by the side of\r\nan old castle, which was begun by the famous Foulques Nera, the\r\ngreatest builder before Louis-Philippe.\r\n\r\nAt the ironworks of Luçay[74] I found horses from the house, which\r\nbrought me here very quickly.\r\n\r\n  [74] Luçay de Male is a dependency of the estate of Valençay. By\r\n  its architecture the castle of Luçay seems to belong to the same\r\n  age as that of Valençay. It is in a fine situation, overlooking\r\n  the ironworks, the fine lake which provides it with water, the\r\n  town of Luçay, and picturesque ravines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, July 18, 1837._--With regard to the trial of General de\r\nRigny, I can say that the General was deeply hurt, and reasonably so,\r\nbecause the Government wished to punish him after his brilliant\r\nacquittal before the Council of War; he declared to the Minister of\r\nWar that if they chose that moment to deprive him of the command of\r\nLille, he would accuse Marshal Clausel before the civil courts, and\r\nwithout in any way sparing him, as he had felt obliged to do at\r\nMarseilles. The Minister of War told him that he had wished to give\r\nhim the command, but that the King objected. M. Molé and the whole\r\nCouncil said the same, and Baron Louis, uncle of General de Rigny,\r\nthought it well to go to Neuilly and demand an explanation from the\r\nKing. The King said that the General had been proved guilty of\r\ninsubordination, to which the poor old uncle replied: \"But your\r\nMajesty is surely ready to recognise the judgment that has been\r\npassed; the Council of War admitted that the remarks attributed to my\r\nnephew were libellous; all that we can now do is to prosecute the\r\nMarshal.\" The King then replied: \"Ah, I did not know that. I will look\r\ninto the details of the trial, and then we shall see.\"[75]\r\n\r\n  [75] In 1836 Marshal Clausel, who was then Governor of Algeria,\r\n  attacked the Bey of Constantine unsuccessfully; upon his failure\r\n  the army, which was weakened, was obliged to raise the siege of\r\n  the town and to retreat by forced marches in the midst of\r\n  continual attacks from the Arab troops. General de Rigny, who was\r\n  stationed in the rearguard, bore the whole weight of this\r\n  disastrous retreat. In spite of his efforts he found that his\r\n  general had singled him out in an order of the day for a formal\r\n  accusation of treacherous insinuations and advice, and had\r\n  declared him a rebel and an unworthy officer. General de Rigny\r\n  demanded to be judged by a court-martial, and secured a verdict\r\n  of acquittal, which was unanimously given in 1837.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that at the Château anybody called Rigny is in bad odour,\r\nfor the opposite reason from that which has made the fortune of M.\r\nBresson. It is not enough to be a devoted servant of the Government;\r\none must also be, and always have been, an Orléanist.\r\n\r\nI have received Madame de Lieven's first letter from London. She seems\r\ndelighted with the magnificence of her hosts' style of living, the\r\nDuke and Duchess of Sutherland, and also by the attentions of her\r\nfriends. She says that the young Queen is a marvel of dignity and\r\nindustry, and is not to be led, even by her mother. She manages her\r\nwhole Court herself, and as the Duchess of Sutherland is Mistress of\r\nthe Robes the Princess sees the notes that the Queen writes on the\r\noccasion of the Court functions, which are models of good arrangement\r\nand propriety. The Duchess of Sutherland is in charge of all\r\narrangements, and is even above the Lord Chamberlain. Apparently she\r\ncan become a second Duchess of Marlborough if she likes. When the\r\nQueen receives addresses on her throne the Duchess of Sutherland\r\nstands at her right hand, while the Duchess of Kent, the Queen's\r\nmother, is seated below the steps. The Queen wishes to review the\r\ntroops on horseback, and what she wishes she does. Lord Melbourne is\r\nall-powerful and the Whigs are triumphant; the elections will be\r\nkeenly fought; it is the Tories' last chance. Lord Durham has resumed\r\nhis power over the Radicals, who flatter him, and the Queen does not\r\nshare her mother's liking for him.\r\n\r\nThe English crown has no diamonds. The very beautiful diamonds of the\r\nQueen-Dowager are her own property, and came to her from her\r\nmother-in-law, the old Queen Charlotte, who bequeathed them to the\r\ncrown of Hanover. As this crown is now separated from the English\r\ncrown, the Duke of Cumberland, as King of Hanover, reclaims the\r\ndiamonds. Thus Queen Victoria has none, and although she is in no\r\nhurry to send back these jewels she will not wear them.\r\n\r\nCount Orloff has been sent to London to compliment the Queen. Madame\r\nde Lieven hopes to learn from him how far she can defy the Emperor,\r\nher master.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers wrote to her from Florence that he was not satisfied with\r\nthe treaty concluded with Abd-el-Kader.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, July 26, 1837._--Letters received this morning seem to show\r\nthat the resolution to dissolve the Chamber has been retracted, or has\r\ngiven rise at any rate to hesitation. The audacious declaration of the\r\nKing of Hanover, the success of Don Carlos, and the fear of seeing the\r\nEnglish elections turn in a Radical direction is said to give rise to\r\napprehension here of definite mandates and republican tendencies in\r\nthe coming general elections.\r\n\r\nThe Court is at the town of Eu, and from thence will go on to\r\nSaint-Cloud. The Dowager Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg accompanies its\r\nmovements. She is liked and respected, and, feeling that her position\r\nwill not be agreeable in Germany, she is in no hurry to return, and is\r\nsomewhat afraid of the solitude that there awaits her.\r\n\r\nYesterday I had a letter from M. Royer-Collard, who is in Paris, from\r\nwhich the following is an extract: \"Dissolution resounds throughout\r\nall correspondence, even in that from the Minister of the Interior.\r\nConditions, however, are laid down: if Don Carlos does not reach\r\nMadrid, if the King of Hanover is not overthrown, if the English\r\nelections give no cause for terror; these reservations are due to the\r\ncharacter and policy of the King, who does not care to run risks, and\r\nwho spares the Doctrinaires by leaving them some hope. The decision is\r\nto come from M. Molé, who would leave them nothing. In neither case is\r\nthere any consideration as to whether the step in itself is good or\r\nbad: 'It will all pass over.' For my part, if I am allowed to express\r\nan opinion, it is precisely those cases which are considered capable\r\nof postponement that I would never postpone. I do not know what the\r\nnew Chamber will be like, nor do I expect miracles from it, but I\r\nregard the old Chamber as inadequate and entirely incompetent, if any\r\nimportant resolution is required.\"\r\n\r\nI have also a letter from M. Thiers from Florence. He seems to be sad\r\nand uneasy about his wife's health; he speaks of her with warm and\r\ntender anxiety, and says that this is his only trouble and that he\r\ndefies politics to disturb his equanimity henceforward. He adds: \"I\r\nhave returned to literature and philosophy; like the classical\r\nBossuet, I enjoy the spectacle of human affairs in monuments and\r\nbooks--that is to say, in the memorials of men of former times. I\r\nclaim the power of discovering the truth from a mere hint, and as this\r\nis the method of historical investigation I believe I have a good\r\nknowledge and understanding of the past. This presumption of mine,\r\nwhich harms nobody, neither M. Guizot nor King Louis-Philippe, nor\r\nPrince Metternich, would enable me to live very happily and busily if\r\nI were spared family cares. I shall therefore do all that I possibly\r\ncan to remain as I am; I wish to improve, to increase my intellectual\r\nand moral powers, and this can be done better in retirement than\r\nanywhere else, as one then has time for reflection and study,\r\nundisturbed by selfish considerations. If some fine position should\r\nappear some day when I have made myself what I can become, well and\r\ngood; but to spend one's life bandied about between the King and his\r\ndemands for an appanage and the Chamber with its refusals, to be\r\nconstantly harassed by the Tuileries and the Palais Bourbon, by people\r\nwho are never grateful and make you the butt of their grievances\r\nwithout the only recompense for the troubles of position, the power to\r\ndo good--all this is simply not worth while. I say this with full\r\nmeaning, and as I am happy enough to see that my feelings are shared\r\nby those about me, I shall maintain my point of view; so that this\r\nwinter you will see me in entire freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 1, 1837._--M. de Vandœuvre came to pay us a visit\r\nyesterday. He told us an amusing story of Madame de Boigne, who had\r\nbeen invited to dinner with M. and Madame de Salvandy. When she\r\narrived she found only the lady of the house, who apologised for her\r\nhusband and said that he could not appear at dinner because he was\r\nill. They sat down without him, but when they went back to the\r\ndrawing-room they found the young Minister, as he calls himself,\r\ncarelessly reposing in a long chair, in Turkish slippers and a fine\r\nflowered dressing-gown, with a smoking cap embroidered by ladies'\r\nhands cocked over one ear. The sharp and prudish face of Madame de\r\nBoigne at that moment is said to have been indescribable.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of the Duchesse de Plaisance has died of typhoid fever at\r\nBeyrout, in Syria; her father told me the news. The fate of the\r\nunhappy mother, of whom at present I know nothing, causes me grief and\r\nanxiety. She was a good friend to me at a time when I had but few\r\nfriends, and I cannot forget it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 4, 1837._--I have read the article upon Madame de\r\nKrüdener in the _Revue des deux Mondes_. She was a Courlandaise, and I\r\nhave seen her at my mother's house, with whom she struck up a small\r\nfriendship. My mother also thought, and rightly, that it was her duty\r\nto take some notice of all her compatriots. Madame de Krüdener was an\r\nadventuress by nature, and if she had not been well born she would\r\nhave been recognised as such long before her final absurdities. From\r\n1814 until her death she lived surrounded by a gang of scoundrels, who\r\nfollowed her about Europe and presented an unpleasant sight which was\r\nanything rather than evangelical. They were a strange company of\r\napostles.\r\n\r\nPeople who are easily excited, animated and changeable, ready for\r\nanything, attracted in the most opposite directions, are often\r\nregarded as hypocrites, simply because they are changeable, and one is\r\nalways tempted to doubt their sincerity. Such is the case of M.\r\nThiers. I am sure he is very happy as he writes in his villa at\r\nCareggi,[76] amid recollections of the Medici, and that he is also\r\nentirely disgusted with Paris. Ardent and impetuous natures, equally\r\nready for any enterprise, are unfortunately often misjudged by\r\ncharacters more happily balanced. I know something of this from my own\r\nexperience. We shall undoubtedly see M. Thiers once more in the arena\r\nof politics and ambition, but to-day he sincerely believes that he has\r\nleft it for ever. The advantage of such natures as his, and perhaps as\r\nmine, consists in the fact that they are never wholly cast down and\r\nare so supple and elastic that they accommodate themselves to the most\r\ndifferent situations; but it must be admitted that corresponding\r\ninconveniences are involved. Their judgment of things and of people is\r\noften too rapid, and their execution is often too quick and too\r\ncomplete; by springing from rock to rock they are always in danger,\r\nand sometimes fall; they then descend to an abyss, which is regarded\r\nas their proper position by those who have been able to maintain\r\nthemselves steadily at one height, are by no means sorry to see their\r\noverthrow and are disinclined to offer any help. How many times have I\r\nseen and experienced this! The worst part of it is not the accusations\r\nof folly, but of hypocrisy. There is, however, for these natures one\r\ninfallible resource, when they have the strength to fall back upon it:\r\nthey can force themselves to recover their equilibrium and follow the\r\ngolden mean. It is a long task, which will continue necessarily\r\nthroughout their lives, but that is the advantage of it, as the end of\r\nit can never be determined.\r\n\r\n  [76] Careggi forms part of the town of Fiesole, near Florence.\r\n  Several villas stand about the neighbourhood, the most famous\r\n  being that which was built by the Medici, which contains several\r\n  Renaissance masterpieces. The Grand Dukes of Tuscany offered the\r\n  use of it to distinguished foreigners who stayed at Florence. In\r\n  this way M. Thiers occupied it in 1837. In 1848 the Princess of\r\n  Parma sought refuge there in her flight from the revolutions.\r\n  This villa still belongs to the house of Lorraine.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Noailles writes to us that his uncle has died within a few\r\nhours, with every symptom of cholera. I do not know whether I am\r\nwrong, but for me everything is shrouded in a veil of darkness, and I\r\ninstinctively fear some catastrophe. If only it does not fall upon M.\r\nde Talleyrand or upon my children! For myself I trust in the will of\r\nGod and prepare myself as well as I can. But how many arrears remain\r\nto be paid, and how terror-stricken I should be were it not for my\r\nfull confidence in the Divine mercy!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 5, 1837._--M. de Montrond writes from Paris to M. de\r\nTalleyrand that the following story was told of the young Queen\r\nVictoria at the house of the Flahauts: The Duchess of Sutherland had\r\nkept the Queen waiting; when she arrived the Queen went up to her and\r\nsaid: \"My dear Duchess, pray do not let this happen again, for neither\r\nyou nor I ought to keep any one waiting.\" Was not that very well said?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 8, 1837._--Yesterday I had a letter from Madame de\r\nLieven, which was begun in England and finished in France in the\r\ncourse of her journey to Paris. She has seen Orloff in London, and\r\nthinks that through him she has settled her business so well that she\r\ncan venture to return to Paris. She tells me some curious things of\r\nthe young Queen. \"Every one has been taken in by her; she has secretly\r\nprepared herself for a long time for her destined position. At the\r\npresent moment she gives her whole heart to Lord Melbourne. Her mother\r\nwished her to enter into obligations with the Radicals, and also with\r\nConroy personally. It seems that Conroy, who dominates the mother, had\r\nbehaved very rudely to her daughter, and even threatened her with\r\nconfinement three days before her accession if she did not promise him\r\na peerage and the post held by Sir Herbert Taylor. She gave him a\r\npension of three thousand pounds and forbade him the palace. The\r\nmother only comes to see her daughter when she is sent for. The\r\nDuchess of Kent complains bitterly, and is obviously overcome by\r\nvexation; and Caradoc, who had miscalculated his possibilities in that\r\nquarter, has shared in this disgrace and has left England. The young\r\nQueen is full of affection and respect for her uncle, King Leopold,\r\nwho did not like Conroy; he used to take the girl's part against her\r\nmother. Melbourne is all-powerful, and adores his young Sovereign. Her\r\nself-possession is incredible. People are quite afraid of her; she\r\nkeeps every one in order, and I assure you that everything looks very\r\ndifferent as compared with the old King's time. The Queen wears every\r\nday the Order of the Garter as a medal upon her shoulder, and the\r\nmotto upon her arm. She has never grown tall, and therefore wears a\r\ndress with a train even in the morning; she has a distinguished\r\nappearance; her face is charming and her shoulders superb. She issues\r\nher orders as a queen; her will must be obeyed at once and without\r\ncontradiction. All the courtiers seem overwhelmed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 15, 1837._--I knew Madame de Lieven's taste for\r\nplanting herself at Paris, but I did not think it went so far as to\r\ninduce her to monopolise the Russian Embassy, and from every point of\r\nview this is a false move; with whatever kindness she may meet in her\r\npresent position, which is regarded as neutral and without influence,\r\nan official position would bring her into inextricable difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 17, 1837._--The following is an extract from a\r\nletter from Madame de Lieven received yesterday: \"For the moment\r\nConservatism is very fashionable in England. The new House of Commons\r\nwill be much better composed than the last; I hope and I believe that\r\nthis will produce an agreement with the moderate Tories; they are\r\nprepared for it. I can answer for Sir Robert Peel and the Duke of\r\nWellington, who are ready to give their help and support for the\r\nmoment without any return. If Lord Melbourne accepts he will lose the\r\nsupport of the Radical Party, and will find himself obliged in a short\r\ntime to bring Tories into the Cabinet; but that is the best bargain\r\nopen to him, and Lord Melbourne is more inclined to it than his\r\ncolleagues. We shall see if he is bold enough to take the step; when I\r\nleft him he seemed ready for it. The Queen will not be married or\r\nthink of marrying for a year or two at least. You may rely upon the\r\naccuracy of this statement. The Duchess of Kent is a complete\r\nnonentity, and even put somewhat on one side by her daughter. Conroy\r\ndare not appear before the Queen. The Queen is astounding! Most\r\nastounding! With so much power at eighteen, what will she be like at\r\nforty?\r\n\r\n\"The Clanricardes have quarrelled with the Ministry. She is happy,\r\nbecause she can now be as Tory as she pleases.\r\n\r\n\"Diplomacy is in a poor way at London, since you and I are no longer\r\nthere. The members look shabby indeed; they seem mere nobodies,\r\nreceive no respect, have no position, know no news, ask everybody for\r\nnews, and come and whisper a Court affair a fortnight after it is\r\nforgotten. I blush for my late profession.\r\n\r\n\"Esterhazy has gone to Brussels. This is producing an effect at\r\nLondon, as it is the first act of recognition to the Belgian royalty;\r\nbut from that source Queen Victoria's policy is inspired.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 20, 1837._--We hear from Paris that the Duc\r\nd'Orléans has a cold and is growing thin. There is some fear of his\r\nlungs, and it is said that he takes too much exercise. It is thought\r\nthe exertion of the camp at Compiègne may be too much for him. His\r\nwife is literally adored by the royal family, and by all who come near\r\nher.\r\n\r\nI have a charming letter from the Duchess of Gloucester. These old\r\nprincesses seem to have been deeply saddened by the death of the late\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 25, 1837._--The King and Queen of the Belgians will\r\nbe at London on the 26th of this month--that is, to-morrow. It is\r\nsupposed that the King will have full influence over his niece, but\r\nthat he will not restore relations between the Duchess of Kent and the\r\nQueen, or go out of his way to spare the former, as he finds their\r\ndisunion in accordance with his ideas.\r\n\r\nThe Princess de Lieven is very angry with her husband, who will not\r\nappear at Havre, where she has arranged to meet him. She is doing her\r\nutmost at St. Petersburg to gain some means of reviving her husband's\r\nspirits, of which, to use her own expression, very little remain. She\r\nrepeats that she cannot leave Paris without risking her life. I think\r\nthat she has no great desire to meet the poor Prince again. She tells\r\nme that M. Guizot is at Paris, that he comes to see her every day, and\r\nthat he drives M. Molé away as soon as he comes in. M. Molé is invited\r\nto the camp at Compiègne from the 1st to the 4th of September, and M.\r\nGuizot from the 5th to the 8th. The whole of France will be invited in\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, August 29, 1837._--I had a troublesome day yesterday.\r\nMadame de Sainte-Aldegonde came to us, bringing her daughters and M.\r\nCuvillier Fleury, tutor to the Duc d'Aumale and a contributor to the\r\n_Journal des Débats_. I had to put myself out and show them\r\neverything, and was very glad when they started back for Beauregard at\r\nnine o'clock in the evening. M. Fleury has left his pupil for the\r\nmoment to travel for six weeks, and is contributing articles to the\r\n_Journal des Débats_ about the castles that he visits. There is\r\nnothing so disagreeable as this kind of thing, and he has received a\r\nstrong hint here that we do not care to see ourselves in print.\r\n\r\nMadame de Sainte-Aldegonde says that the Duchesse d'Orléans is\r\ncertainly with child. She also says that Princesse Marie is to marry\r\nDuke Alexander of Würtemberg next October, and will live in France.\r\n\r\nM. Mignet, who has been here for two days, tells us no news. He\r\nconfines himself to long historical dissertations, which are sometimes\r\ninteresting, but generally somewhat pedantic.\r\n\r\nMadame de Jaucourt writes that Baron Louis is dying of a stroke of\r\napoplexy. This has been largely brought on by fretting over the\r\nbusiness of his nephew de Rigny.[77]\r\n\r\n  [77] _See_ p. 120.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 2, 1837._--I have a letter from the Duc de\r\nNoailles, who gives me some small news. I never saw any one of\r\nimportance stay at home less than he does. At Paris he pays a daily\r\nround of calls, morning and evening, which take up the whole of his\r\ntime, and he never refuses an invitation to dinner. In the summer he\r\ngoes the round of the country houses and the watering-places, and is\r\ncontinually making excursions to Paris, as his residence is close at\r\nhand. Barren characters, when they are naturally intelligent, feel a\r\ngreater need of change than others; in any case, the consequence is\r\nthat he always knows the news. At Paris he keeps it to himself, and\r\nasks more questions than he answers; but when he writes he tells all\r\nthat he knows, so that his letters are always pleasant.\r\n\r\nI have also a letter from M. Thiers, from Cauterets. He is\r\nizard-hunting with the Basques, of which sport he is very fond,\r\nalthough the Pyrenees seem to him but poor scenery after the Lake of\r\nComo. He is less anxious about his wife's health, and talks of coming\r\nhere for the end of the month, but with all his impedimenta, as he\r\ncannot leave the ladies whom he is escorting. I am not altogether\r\npleased, but how can I refuse?\r\n\r\nIt seems that the expedition to Constantine is actually to take place,\r\nand that the Prince Royal will lead it. This campaign seems to me a\r\nvery foolish one for the Prince Royal.\r\n\r\nI have just read the so-called memoirs of the Chevalier d'Eon, which\r\nare tiresome, improbable, and absurd; the idea in particular that he\r\ncould have had a love-affair with the old Queen of England, the\r\nugliest, the most prudish and austere woman of her time, is too\r\nridiculous an invention.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 6, 1837._--The newspapers now say that it is the\r\nDuc de Nemours, and not the Prince Royal, who will command the\r\nexpedition to Constantine. This seems to me a better arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe Princesse de Lieven writes as follows: \"There is talk of a double\r\nmarriage: the Princesse Marie with Duke Alexander of Würtemberg and\r\nPrincesse Clémentine with the eldest son of the reigning Duke of\r\nSaxe-Coburg-Gotha. Here, however, a difficulty appears. The children\r\nof the marriage should be Lutherans, which the Queen does not wish;\r\nand in the case of the first marriage there is also the possible\r\ndifficulty that the King of Würtemberg might not give his consent. It\r\nis said that the negotiations, though not broken off, are not far\r\nadvanced. I have a letter from my brother which shows me that Orloff\r\nhas kept his word. He says that Paris is the only place to suit me,\r\nand that no one protests against it. Now I have only my husband to\r\nthink of, and how can he be likely to offer objections as the Court\r\nhas raised none? This difficulty is bound to disappear, but not for a\r\nmonth or six weeks, for my husband will require advices from the\r\nEmperor, and the whole troublesome affair will have to go round\r\nEurope, from Paris to Odessa and from Odessa to Ischl and from Ischl\r\nto Paris. Just think of that!\" So much from this great and aged spoilt\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 8, 1837._--The news given us by Madame de\r\nSainte-Aldegonde was premature. Madame Adélaïde writes to M. de\r\nTalleyrand that the Duchesse d'Orléans is not with child, that the\r\nKing will not go to Amboise this year, and that the marriage of the\r\nPrincesse Marie with Duke Alexander of Würtemberg is possible, but not\r\nabsolutely settled, though negotiations are going on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 9, 1837._--I have come back from an excursion to\r\nChâteauvieux and Saint-Aignan which occupied the whole of yesterday\r\nand to-day. I was marvellously well and in high spirits with M.\r\nRoyer-Collard, but to-day I feel broken down and miserable. There is\r\nno sense in it; I do not know what does me good or what makes me feel\r\nill; I suffer from what I think should do me good and recover from\r\nthat which should lay me low. I am a very strange little creature. The\r\ndoctor tells me every day that it is the result of my nervous,\r\nfantastic, and capricious disposition. What is certain is that I have\r\nfits of cheerfulness, of gaiety, and of sadness; that I look after\r\nmyself, or my nerves look after me, very badly; and that I am\r\nexceedingly tired of myself, and to some extent of other people.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 11, 1837._--What is to be said of the mandate of\r\nthe Archbishop of Paris, and of the article in the _Journal des\r\nDébats_ which follows it? The desecration of Sainte-Geneviève is\r\nobvious, and the scandal of the pediment has been felt by all\r\nright-thinking people.[78] In the face of such an enormity it was\r\ndifficult for the plaintive voice of the chief pastor not to utter a\r\ncry of pain, and the absence of any protest would have been\r\nblameworthy, in my opinion. But his cry has been uttered with violence\r\nand bitterness, and with none of the apostolic respect for the\r\nfeelings of others which it is always wise to keep in view. In M. de\r\nQuélen we shall always have an excellent priest with the courage and\r\ndevotion of his convictions, but he will never learn tact, and will\r\nconstantly injure his position by his words and his actions. I am\r\nsorry for him, as I am interested in him, and also for the cause of\r\nreligion, which is even more wounded by these unhappy events and\r\nGovernmental scandals. The want of thought which permitted this\r\npediment, the obvious hesitation of the Ministry to know whether it\r\nwould be disclosed or not, the weakness which showed it to the eyes of\r\nthe public, and the tone of indifference with which newspapers speak\r\nof it, are so many disavowals of the system of order and energy which\r\nthey have claimed as theirs. Next to the pillage of the archbishopric,\r\nthe destruction of the crosses, and the rejection of the fleur-de-lys,\r\nnothing seems to me more hopelessly revolutionary than this hideous\r\npediment. It frightens right-thinking people far more than usurpation.\r\n\r\n  [78] It was proposed to erect upon the Pantheon a colossal statue\r\n  of Renown to replace the cross removed in 1831 from what was at\r\n  that time the Church of Sainte-Geneviève. Cortot was commissioned\r\n  with this work, and set up a model in carton-pierre. Criticism\r\n  unanimously condemned it, and the statue was taken down after\r\n  some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 12, 1837._--The Carlist party are very wrong to\r\naccuse the Duc de Noailles of inclination to support the present\r\nGovernment; he is very far from anything of the kind. I have seen that\r\nhe was somewhat tempted to that course for two or three months during\r\nthe journey of the two Princes in Germany and when the marriage of the\r\nArchduchess Theresa was discussed. Since Alibaud's pistol-shot and the\r\nrefusal of Austria he has given up the idea, and I think he is more\r\ndetermined than ever to follow his present line of conduct, although\r\nhis impartiality in thought and language will always prevent him from\r\njoining the hot-headed members of his party.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven writes as follows: \"I have a letter from my husband\r\nproposing the right bank of the Rhine and asserting that he cannot\r\npossibly cross it. We shall see. I hope and believe that he will\r\nchange his mind. M. Molé and M. Guizot meet at my house, and are\r\nbeginning to talk. The consent of the King of Würtemberg to his\r\ncousin's marriage has come to hand. M. Guizot has returned from\r\nCompiègne delighted with the wit and intelligence of the Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans. Madame de Flahaut is kept very much aloof from the\r\nPrincess, and is vexed in consequence. She had her four days at the\r\nChâteau, like the other guests, and then returned to her rooms in the\r\ntown of Compiègne. Lady Jersey writes that she will come and spend the\r\nwinter at Paris to see the Prince de Talleyrand. My husband has seen\r\ntheir Hanoverian Majesties at Carlsbad.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 18, 1837._--Yesterday I had a very kind letter\r\nfrom M. Molé. He tells me that he has been obliged to postpone the\r\ndiplomatic affair. He wishes to create some peers, but is somewhat\r\nhampered by the stupid social classification. He speaks bitterly of\r\nthe great attention paid by M. Guizot to Madame de Lieven, and readily\r\naccepted by the latter.\r\n\r\nAlava, who has been here since yesterday, told me that the hunchbacked\r\ndaughter of the Duc de Frias has married the Prince of Anglona. Mlle.\r\nAuguste de Rigny is certainly the only heiress of the Baron Louis, who\r\nleaves seventy thousand francs income. She has already an income of\r\neighteen thousand of her own. The will is quite simple, and so\r\ndefinite that it cannot be attacked.[79]\r\n\r\n  [79] Baron Louis died at Vry-sur-Marne, near Paris, on August 26,\r\n  1837.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 19, 1837._--M. de Salvandy, whom M. de Talleyrand\r\nhad invited here, appeared yesterday at dinner-time. He is going back\r\nthis evening, having sandwiched this excursion between two meetings of\r\nthe Council. I have exhausted myself in graciousness of manner and in\r\nmaking conversation, which is not an easy matter with a man who is\r\nundoubtedly intellectual, but emphatically so, and constantly anxious\r\nto produce an effect. In any case, he has been very attentive to me.\r\nHe told me that the Duke Alexander of Würtemberg had an income of only\r\nfifty thousand francs, and that the King of Würtemberg showed much\r\npoliteness and readiness throughout the affair, though the alliance is\r\na poor one for our young Princess; we gain nothing more than a husband\r\nfor her. It is not true that she will stay in France; in the summer\r\nshe will live in her husband's castle, fifteen leagues from Coburg,\r\nand in the winter in a little palace at Gotha. When they visit Paris\r\nthey will be put up at the Elysée. They are going to Germany\r\nimmediately after the marriage, which will take place in the first\r\nfortnight of October.\r\n\r\nThe French elections will take place on November 15, and the Chamber\r\nwill meet on December 5.\r\n\r\nM. de Salvandy also talked much of the Duchess d'Orleans, whom he\r\nbelieves, and I think rightly, to be an eminently clever person, and,\r\nas she has to govern some day thirty-two million souls, is working\r\ndaily to win their hearts one by one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 20, 1837._--M. de Salvandy left us yesterday\r\nafter dinner. During our morning talk he quoted an instance showing\r\nthe growing influence of the Duchesse d'Orléans over her husband.\r\nBefore his marriage he troubled so little about mass that last May, a\r\nfew weeks before his wedding, he went to the races at Chantilly on the\r\nDay of Pentecost, and never even thought of attending mass. Recently\r\nat Saint-Quentin he went there _in fiocchi_, telling the National\r\nGuard that they might follow him or not as they pleased. The Guard\r\nwent in a body. Saint-Quentin, however, like all manufacturing towns,\r\nis by no means religious.\r\n\r\nThe Pope is deeply vexed about the business of Sainte-Geneviève, and\r\nis going to offer a severe remonstrance through Mgr. Garibaldi. The\r\nKing, who has been much distressed by the scandal, is embarrassed in\r\nhis relations with Rome because he yielded to M. de Montalivet, who is\r\nunfortunately surrounded by the wretched troop of hostile newspapers,\r\nto which he pays homage and deference. M. Molé, who is opposed to the\r\npediment, has also yielded. M. de Salvandy is also fulminating, and I\r\nimagine when he has uttered one sonorous phrase he will think his duty\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 22, 1837._--M. de Salvandy has written, upon his\r\narrival in Paris during the session of the Council, telling M. de\r\nTalleyrand that he had found everybody much excited at the news from\r\nSpain; all are expecting to hear of the arrival of Don Carlos at\r\nMadrid. It is possible that this news will somewhat disturb\r\narrangements for the dissolution and the elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 28, 1837._--Madame Adélaïde writes that the\r\nmarriage of her niece to Duke Alexander of Würtemberg will take place\r\nat Trianon on October 12. Madame de Castellane tells me that the\r\nLieven-Guizot flirtation is unparalleled. He is making her read Dante\r\nand Tasso, and never leaves her house. Since he has been in the\r\ncountry he writes letters to her of ten pages. During his absence the\r\nPrincess went to his house, gained admission to his rooms, and\r\nexamined everything carefully. She has written curious but sensible\r\narticles on the subject. An article has appeared concerning the whole\r\naffair in _Le Temps_. This has made her furious, and she has had a\r\nvery lively interview with M. Molé, because _Le Temps_ is said to be\r\nconsiderably under Ministerial influence; hence relations between the\r\nPrime Minister and herself are somewhat strained. It is all very\r\nridiculous, and I am glad to be away from Paris and all this gossip.\r\n\r\nIn any case, a retired life is delightful. In society one squanders\r\ntoo much energy; instead of laying up a proper store of provisions for\r\nthe great journey, we scatter them broadcast, and find ourselves\r\nlacking when we have to start. Terrible is our want and disgraceful\r\nour indigence! I am sometimes really terrified at my wretched\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nYesterday I had a sad piece of news--the death of the young Princess\r\nof Arsoli, daughter of the late Madame de Carignan. She was carried\r\noff by cholera in the same week as her mother-in-law, Princess\r\nMassimo. I had seen her born.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 29, 1837._--The Baron de Montmorency, who arrived\r\nhere yesterday, thinks that there is some hitch in the Würtemberg\r\nmarriage. The King of Würtemberg seems to have suddenly refused his\r\nconsent, except on condition that all the children should be\r\nProtestants, while our Queen wishes them all to be Catholics. If the\r\nDuke Alexander yields to the Queen there will be a marriage the more\r\nwithout the head of the family, which never looks well. If France\r\ngives way to the King of Würtemberg the Princess will have to go to be\r\nmarried at the frontier, as was Mlle. de Broglie, for the French\r\nCatholic clergy will only allow mixed marriages on condition that all\r\nthe children are brought up as Catholics. It is really inconceivable\r\nthat so important a question was not decided before the announcement\r\nof the marriage. It will lead to any number of vexatious ideas, and\r\nshow with what difficulty business can be conducted at our Court.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Von Hügel, the Austrian Chargé d'Affaires at Paris, is\r\ngoing mad.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 1, 1837._--Yesterday our theatricals took place,\r\nfor which we had been rehearsing for a fortnight; I played my part in\r\nspite of a headache. People kindly said that I entirely concealed my\r\nsuffering on the stage, but as soon as it was over I was obliged to go\r\nto bed at once. The performance was quite successful, and Pauline\r\nplayed two totally different parts so admirably that I begin to wonder\r\nwhether I ought to allow her to continue this amusement. Our scene\r\nfrom the _Femmes savantes_ went very well, and M. de la Besnardière,\r\nwho is an old theatre-goer, asserts that he never saw it so well\r\nplayed. I really think that it went with a certainty, a unity, and a\r\ncorrectness that were quite remarkable. M. de Talleyrand was\r\ndelighted. There was supper and dancing after the performance, but I\r\nwas not there.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 2, 1837._--All the neighbours about us went away\r\nyesterday after mass, but in the course of the day a certain Mr.\r\nHamilton arrived, who is an American, and the son of Colonel\r\nHamilton, who was well known during the War of Independence in the\r\nUnited States; M. de Talleyrand often speaks of him, and was very\r\nintimate with him in America. The son did not wish to leave the Old\r\nWorld, where he has been making a tour, without seeing his father's\r\nfriend. He brought his own son with him, a young man of twenty-one.\r\nNeither of them speak French, so I exhausted myself in making English\r\nconversation. They are starting again this morning. In his own country\r\nMr. Hamilton belongs to the Opposition party. He is a sensible man,\r\nbut with that tinge of Americanism which is always somewhat\r\ndisagreeable in the best of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 7, 1837._--I hear from Paris that the difficulties\r\nwith Würtemberg have been smoothed over. The marriage is to take place\r\non the 14th, and everything is going on to the general satisfaction.\r\nOur Princess has been invited to Stuttgart. The Duc d'Orléans is said\r\nto be the only member of the family dissatisfied with this union, and\r\nwe are told that he treated his future brother-in-law more than coldly\r\nat Compiègne.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 9, 1837._--The Duc Decazes arrived here\r\nunexpectedly at dinner-time yesterday. He was on his way from Livorno,\r\nfull of the Bordeaux affair, which he seems inclined to visit upon the\r\nPrefect, M. de Pressac. After dinner he continued his journey to\r\nParis, where he is summoned by the marriage of the Princesse Marie. He\r\nhad left M. Thiers and all his family at Tours. We are expecting them\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 10, 1837._--M. and Madame Thiers, Madame Dosne and\r\nher young daughter arrived yesterday an hour before dinner-time. They\r\ncame by Montrichard, and so they were all shaken and weary. Madame\r\nThiers does not show any sign of exhaustion in her face; she is\r\nperhaps a little thin, but nothing else; I think it is largely a\r\nmatter of nerves, and that if she were in good spirits her\r\nindisposition would quickly disappear. In any case, for a person of\r\nher kind, I think her quite anxious to please, but, like her mother,\r\nshe has a vulgar intonation and trivial expressions to which I cannot\r\nget accustomed. It was a dull and heavy evening, in spite of the\r\nenthusiasm of M. Thiers for Italy. He seems to be greatly struck by\r\nthe beauty of Valençay, and I think they are all very glad to be here.\r\nFortunately the weather is fine; I have never prayed for sunshine so\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 11, 1837._--Madame Thiers was very tired yesterday;\r\nshe went upstairs after lunch and did not reappear until dinner-time.\r\nShe would not go for a drive, and her mother kept her company. We took\r\nthe husband out with us, and he was in excellent spirits, with no\r\nbitterness or hostility. He wishes to go from here to Lille without\r\ncrossing Paris, where he only wishes to arrive just in time for the\r\nChambers; he was also very sarcastic about the repeated proposals that\r\nhave been made to him for the greatest embassies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 12, 1837._--M. de Talleyrand yesterday took M.\r\nThiers to see M. Royer-Collard. They returned both well pleased with\r\ntheir walk, whence I infer that they left their host equally pleased.\r\nI have no great trouble with the ladies. The young wife appears for\r\nmeals, lolls in a drawing-room armchair for half an hour after lunch\r\nand for an hour after dinner, then goes up to her room; she will not\r\ndrive, and only wishes to be left alone. Her mother is with her a\r\ngreat deal, and her husband most attentive. The young wife governs\r\nthem all, but like a spoilt and capricious child, and I think that the\r\npoor husband finds the path of marriage a somewhat thorny one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 13, 1837._--The Duchesse de Saint-Leu is dead. What\r\nwill become of her son? Will he be left upon our frontier?\r\n\r\nMadame Murat continues to remain at Paris. General Macdonald,[80] who\r\nwas thought to be her husband, and who was greatly devoted to her in\r\nany case, has died at Florence. To the universal surprise, this event\r\nhas not so far saddened her as to prevent her from going to the\r\ntheatre, nor does she show any of the grief that might have been\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n  [80] Francis Macdonald had been appointed Minister of War at\r\n  Naples by King Murat in 1814.\r\n\r\nHere people talk of nothing but the approaching elections; they seem\r\nto be still very uncertain and to defy all calculations. I have always\r\nnoticed this to be the case at every dissolution of the Chamber. The\r\ninstructions of the Ministry are very capricious; on the whole the\r\nDoctrinaires and progressive parties are to be proscribed, but with so\r\nmany exceptions here and there that unusual points of contact are\r\ncreated. M. Thiers is quite calm, in excellent political spirits; he\r\ntalks a great deal of his forty years and of the frost of age;\r\nhowever, I would not trust to that, and if he were provoked he would\r\nbe quite capable of entering the fray most vigorously. He has quite\r\nabandoned his ideas of Spanish intervention, not as regards the past,\r\nbut for the present moment. I have never seen him so wise and\r\nself-controlled--a condition only to be attained by those whose\r\ninclinations are definite, and who have enough self-satisfaction not\r\nto be ambitious for power. His wife unbends a little; she danced\r\nyesterday evening in excellent spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 15, 1837._--The whole of the Thiers family went\r\naway yesterday. Although the mother has been anxious to please, the\r\nyoung wife amiable in her manner, and her husband witty, animated, and\r\ntractable, as usual, I am not sorry to see them go.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 22, 1837._--We are to have a second theatrical\r\nperformance. I rehearsed my part yesterday with M. de Valençay while\r\nthe rest of the company were out driving.\r\n\r\nI have a very carefully written letter from Madame Dosne, from which\r\nthe following is an interesting passage: \"Since our arrival the house\r\nhas been stormed by friends, inquirers, and interested people, who\r\nwish to learn the attitude of M. Thiers. He has seen M. Molé and M. de\r\nMontalivet, who are struggling for his friendship, and has been\r\neffusively received by the royal family. You know better than any one,\r\nmadame, to whom he owes that. In short, his move to Paris has been\r\nquite politic and successful. He is ready to defend the Ministry as\r\nlong as it lasts and to help it as long as he can, if they will\r\nsupport his view with regard to the elections. To-morrow we shall\r\nstart for Lille, where we shall stay as long as my daughter wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 26, 1837._--Madame de Lieven writes to say that her\r\nhusband has sent his son Alexander to her to carry her off dead or\r\nalive, but she has refused to stir, and that the son has gone back\r\nagain provided with all possible certificates from the doctors of the\r\nEmbassy stating the impossibility of moving her. She is loud in the\r\npraises of Comte Pahlen and of my cousin Paul Medem. It seems that the\r\nAutocrat told M. de Lieven that he would crush the Princess if she\r\npersisted in remaining in France. I think she has some private means\r\nwhich no one can touch, and which help her to hold out. Before long it\r\nwill become a regular drama.\r\n\r\nI have a long letter from the Duc d'Orléans, in which he tells me that\r\nhis sister, the Duchess of Würtemberg, did not go immediately to\r\nStuttgart on leaving Paris, but went first to Coburg, and will not go\r\nto Würtemberg till later. The Duc d'Orléans gives me excellent\r\naccounts of his wife, and seems to regard her as a perfect friend,\r\nwhich is the best certificate a woman can have from her husband, and a\r\nguarantee of the most desirable future for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, November 2, 1837._--I shall start presently to dine and\r\nsleep at Beauregard. To-morrow I shall pass through Tours, and reach\r\nmy house at Rochecotte in time for dinner.\r\n\r\nI have a kind letter from M. Guizot, who tells me that the new Chamber\r\nwill be like the last, and that if there is a difference it will be to\r\nthe advantage of his own views.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers writes from Lille saying that the general electioneering cry\r\nis \"Down with the Doctrinaires!\" and that he is asked by five\r\ndifferent departments to become a candidate, but that he will remain\r\nfaithful to Aix. Finally, M. Royer-Collard writes from Paris saying\r\nthat M. Molé has been tricked in the elections; that it does not,\r\nhowever, follow that the elections will go in favour of the\r\nDoctrinaires, but that they will not lack Ministerial support. Of\r\nthese three versions which is the most credible? I am inclined to\r\naccept the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 4, 1837._--Since yesterday I have been in my own\r\nhome. As I passed through Tours in the morning I found the poor\r\nPrefect grappling with the electoral fever.\r\n\r\nThe confusion of the instructions is incredible, continually modified\r\nor contradicted as they are by intrigues at Paris, alternating between\r\nthe influence of Guizot or Thiers; consequently I think the result\r\nwill be very far removed from that which was proposed at the\r\ndissolution of the Chamber. Fortunately the country is calm, for the\r\ndissolution was decided upon, not for patriotic reasons, but simply\r\nfor personal interest, and miscalculation upon that ground is a matter\r\nof indifference. At the same time it is foolish uselessly to stir up\r\nan infinity of local passions which, though they do not rise to the\r\ndanger and violence of political strife, none the less injure public\r\nspirit by dividing the country more and more into parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 5, 1837._--The comedies which we acted at\r\nValençay brought some life into the great castle, of which there has\r\nbeen a prodigious lack during June, July, and August. I admit, to my\r\nshame, that for the first time in my life since I rested from the\r\nfatigues of Fontainebleau and Versailles I have been very bored. The\r\nillness which we have all suffered one after another brought anxiety\r\nin place of boredom, and I am glad of some small diversion to bring me\r\nout of the groove.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 11, 1837._--A letter from Madame Adélaïde\r\nreached me yesterday. She seems fairly pleased with the elections, and\r\nwould be more so were it not for the infamous alliance between the\r\nLegitimists and Republicans, which has brought success to the latter\r\nparty in several places. I use her own expressions. She also says that\r\nPrincesse Marie is delighted with her husband and her journey, with\r\nGermany and with the reception which has so far been given.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 24, 1837._--I am sorry for the Grand Duchess\r\nStephanie on account of the wrongdoing or misfortune of her daughter,\r\nthe Princess Wasa.[81] I never liked her, and was struck by her bad\r\nappearance when I saw her at Paris in 1827 with her mother; moreover,\r\nher husband, whom I also know, is a very ordinary person, and by no\r\nmeans the man to guide a young wife.\r\n\r\n  [81] Princess Louisa of Baden, the eldest daughter of the Grand\r\n  Duchess Stephanie of Baden, had married a Prince Wasa. Her\r\n  household was constantly disturbed by quarrels, which the Grand\r\n  Duchess was continually trying to heal, though for a long time\r\n  without success.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess of Massa speaks with delight in her letters of the\r\nhospitality and the distinction at the Court of Coburg, and of the\r\nhappiness of the Princesse Marie. I also hear that the Duc d'Orléans\r\nconstantly talks of his domestic happiness, in which he is entirely\r\nabsorbed. He is to give an entertainment upon the return of his\r\nbrother, the Duc de Nemours, the victor of Constantine.\r\n\r\nI am more and more delighted with the life of Bossuet by Cardinal\r\nBausset. How fortunate it is that I put off reading this book at a\r\ntime when the taste for reading had passed away, and is now revived by\r\nthis excellent work! I have ordered a fine engraving of Bossuet which\r\nI wish to possess; it is absurd that he should not have his place here\r\nwith my other friends of the great century, Madame de Sévigné, Madame\r\nde Maintenon, Cardinal de Retz, and Arnauld d'Andilly. Although I\r\nadmire every personage of that great age, I have my preferences. I\r\nwant a portrait of the Palatine to complete my collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 30, 1837._--My sister, the Duchesse de Sagan,\r\nwrites to say that she will come here shortly; I do not know whether\r\nshe will carry out her plan this time--not that I am altogether\r\nregretful if she should fail, for I am never entirely at my ease with\r\nher. I was accustomed to be afraid of her in my youth, and am still\r\nsomewhat overawed; but as the matter has been announced and arranged,\r\nit is better that she should come.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 2, 1837._--Yesterday in the _Journal des Débats_\r\nI read the great memorandum of the Prussian Government against the\r\nArchbishop of Cologne.[82] We must suspend our judgment until we hear\r\nhis defence; but the fact remains that so strong a measure as to\r\narrest an archbishop and imprison him does not look well in the case\r\nof a Protestant Sovereign when dealing with a Catholic prelate in a\r\nCatholic country. It has too strong an appearance of persecution, even\r\nif it be justified at bottom. I am very curious to know the end of\r\nthis affair; it seems to me of serious import.\r\n\r\n  [82] The Archbishop of Cologne and the Prussian Government\r\n  differed on the question of mixed marriages. The Archbishop\r\n  wished to appeal to the Pope, and the Government had him arrested\r\n  on November 28, 1837. He remained a prisoner for four years at\r\n  Minden, and never re-entered his diocese, where his coadjutor\r\n  took his place on his death in 1845. The Archbishop of Cologne,\r\n  Baron Droste de Vischering, was born in 1773.\r\n\r\nM. de Montrond tells M. de Talleyrand that the whole family of Thiers\r\nprofess such a redoubled affection for us since their stay at Valençay\r\nthat we shall be regarded as responsible for the acts and deeds of M.\r\nThiers during the coming session. I have urged this upon M. de\r\nTalleyrand as an argument for staying here as long as possible, but\r\nwith what success I do not know.\r\n\r\nM. Guizot is to be found at Madame de Lieven's house from morning to\r\nevening, to the general amusement.\r\n\r\nMadame Adélaïde's letters begin to urge more strongly our return to\r\nParis, which is exactly the reason why I should prefer to stay here.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 4, 1837._--M. de Sainte-Aulaire informs me that\r\nthe Grand Duchess Stephanie has solved her daughter Wasa's domestic\r\ndifficulties. I fear she has only postponed the evil day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 6, 1837._--Yesterday I carried out an enterprise\r\nwhich I had long been anxious to perform. I went with my son Valençay\r\nto see the Comte d'Héliaud and Madame de Champchevrier. We started in\r\nfine frosty weather, lunched with M. d'Héliaud, and spent an hour at\r\nChampchevrier on our return with the nicest people in the world, in a\r\nfine old castle, with moats and avenues, and a well-wooded country of\r\npreserves; old tapestry, stag-horns, and hunting-horns hung from the\r\nwalls are the chief ornaments in this noble but not very elegant\r\nmansion. It is inhabited by a simple, upright, and respected family,\r\nwho live comfortably but not luxuriously, hunting and farming\r\nthroughout the year. At certain times forty or fifty of the\r\nsurrounding families meet there for amusement. The whole establishment\r\nis well worthy of a description by Walter Scott, especially an old\r\ngrandmother of eighty-two, upright, alert, imposing, and polite, in a\r\nsurprisingly antique dress. We were very kindly received. By the time\r\nwe reached home I was frozen, but very glad that I had paid my calls\r\nand fulfilled my neighbourly duties.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Noailles writes to say that he met M. Thiers one morning at\r\nMadame de Lieven's house, where he spoke like a little saint and a\r\ngreat philosopher.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 10, 1837._--My sister and my son Alexandre at\r\nlast arrived here yesterday, after a long and tiring journey. My\r\nsister has grown very stout, and looks much older; none the less she\r\nis astonishingly well preserved for the age of fifty-seven. She talks\r\na great deal and very loudly. The Vienna strain in her is predominant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 11, 1837._--I took my sister for a long drive\r\nyesterday. She thinks this place very pretty, and, as other persons\r\nhave already told me, assures me that nothing recalls to her so much\r\n_la bella Italia_. We had hardly returned from our long drive than I\r\nbegan it over again for M. de Salvandy, who dropped in unexpectedly at\r\ndinner, and after a short stay continued his journey to\r\nNogent-le-Rotrou, where he is going to an electoral banquet. He told\r\nus that the Duc de Nemours had reached Havre with a broken arm, in\r\nconsequence of an accident upon board of a wretched steamship. He\r\ntravelled by Gibraltar, in order to avoid a great ball that the town\r\nof Marseilles had prepared for him, and over which great expense had\r\nbeen incurred. The King is very displeased by this prank.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 19, 1837._--Last spring when I consulted\r\nLisfranc and Cruveilhier they both told me that I was threatened by a\r\ntendency to feverishness. Since that time my life has been arranged\r\nto avoid the danger, and with success; but since the arrival of my\r\nsister I have felt a great and steadily increasing nervous agitation,\r\nso much so that yesterday inflammation was pronounced, with violent\r\nfever. I am much distressed, and think I shall have to spend some days\r\nin bed or upon my sofa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 20, 1837._--The doctor says that I am better\r\nto-day. I never remember having felt so ill as the day before\r\nyesterday. I am still keeping my room, and feel very poorly, but the\r\ndoctor repeats that there is no danger, and that with a few days' more\r\ncare I shall be quite well.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 25, 1837._--The pain in my right side is growing\r\nless, and I am not so weak. When I am stronger I shall speak of my\r\nthoughts during these days of danger through which I have passed. The\r\nmental life becomes the clearer when the outward eye is veiled and\r\nobscured.[83]\r\n\r\n  [83] The Duchesse de Dino suffered from a much more severe\r\n  illness than she relates. It is to this period that she ascribed\r\n  those inward changes which then took place in the case of M. de\r\n  Talleyrand, and gradually brought him back to the Christian\r\n  faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 26, 1837._--I am better, and very grateful to\r\nProvidence which has delivered me from so grievous a state; but I\r\nshall not recover from the shock for a long time. I was deeply touched\r\nto learn that yesterday during the service I was recommended to the\r\nprayers of the congregation. All my neighbours and the whole\r\ncountryside have been most kind; my servants have watched and worked\r\nwith infinite zeal, and the two doctors, MM. Cogny and Orie, have been\r\nvery attentive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 28, 1837._--The weather is magnificent, and at\r\nmidday I shall be wheeled on to the terrace for a moment.\r\n\r\nI have no news from Paris, and am greatly ignorant of the affairs of\r\nthis world. It seemed to me during the two days that I was ill that I\r\nsaw something of the things of the next world, and that it was not so\r\ndifficult as might be thought to rise towards one's Creator; that\r\nthere was even a certain sweetness in the idea that one was to rest at\r\nlength from all the troubles of life. Providence can soften all the\r\ntrials which He sends to us, by giving us the strength to bear them,\r\nand one can never feel too thankful for all the Divine favours.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 31, 1837._--This last day of a year, which upon\r\nthe whole has not been entirely agreeable, induces me to throw a\r\nretrospective glance upon my life--an effort which produces a not very\r\npleasant result. However, it would be wrong to complain; if\r\nmisfortunes are not lacking for me, there are also blessings which it\r\nwould be ungrateful not to recognise; and one may feel despondent and\r\nserious and yet have no right to feel or to call oneself unhappy. May\r\nGod preserve for myself and for those whom I love, honour, health, and\r\nthat peace of mind which keeps the soul from care, and my thanks will\r\nbe heartfelt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n1838\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, January 1, 1838._--In spite of my weakness I remained\r\nuntil midnight in the drawing-room, to embrace M. de Talleyrand, my\r\nchildren, and my sister as the new year came in. I am to go out in the\r\ncarriage to-day, to come down to dinner, and, in short, to return to\r\nlife by degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, January 2, 1838._--The whole countryside passed this way\r\nyesterday; people were still here in the evening. I am no worse this\r\nmorning, but the contrary, and if this marvellous weather will last a\r\nfew days longer I hope that I shall soon be quite myself again. M. de\r\nTalleyrand, unfortunately, already speaks of returning to Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, January 5, 1838._--I have no good opinion of the year\r\nupon which we have entered, from a political point of view. My mind is\r\ndespondent, my soul sad, my nerves are weak, my heart is full, and, to\r\nuse the language of the chambermaid, I wouldn't give twopence for\r\nanything. We have been plunged in fog for the last few days, but none\r\nthe less I have been to pay my farewell calls in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, January 6, 1838._--M. de Talleyrand and Pauline have just\r\nstarted for Paris. No one is left in the house except my sister, my\r\nson Alexandre, and myself. I must make up my accounts and prepare for\r\ndeparture, as we are all three going the day after to-morrow.\r\nNotwithstanding the sad recollections of the illness which darkened my\r\nlast weeks here, I shall leave this pleasant little spot with regret.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 11, 1838._--I arrived here yesterday at ten o'clock in\r\nthe evening after a journey which nine degrees of frost and constant\r\nsnow made extremely unpleasant. However, we had no accident, and the\r\nchange of air, sudden as it has been, has rather strengthened me and\r\ngiven me a little appetite.\r\n\r\nYesterday I dined at Versailles with Madame de Balbi, whom I thought\r\nhad grown very old. My sister at the same time was eating fowl with\r\nMadame de Trogoff, whom she knew very well long ago.\r\n\r\nWe found M. de Talleyrand in good health, but anxious about our\r\njourney. He told me that the Ministry was absorbed in work upon the\r\nAddress, so that none of the members are visible for the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 12, 1838._--Yesterday I was very busy with my sister's\r\ndresses, my own, and those of Pauline. We have all three arrived in\r\nrags. Then I went to see Madame de Laval, who is greatly changed. In\r\nthe evening I took my sister to hear _The Puritans_, in the same box\r\nat the _Théâtre Italien_ as I had last year. Rubini has certainly lost\r\nsomething of his voice, and Madame Grisi has begun to shriek.\r\n\r\nI believe there is great agitation in the political world, but I ask\r\nno questions, do not even read a newspaper, and preserve my beloved\r\nstate of ignorance, partly through idleness and partly as a\r\nprecaution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 13, 1838._--My sister wished to go for once to the\r\nChamber of Deputies, which is a new sight for her. The Russian\r\nAmbassador gave us his tickets, and we spent our morning yesterday at\r\nthe Palais Bourbon. M. Molé surpassed my expectations. He delighted my\r\nsister and charmed myself. There could be nothing more dignified,\r\nnothing clearer, better thought or better expressed than his speech.\r\nHis success was quite complete. I saw Madame de Lieven at the Chamber;\r\nmy sister and she will not look at one another; they detest one\r\nanother, though they do not know one another. This is inconvenient\r\nfor me.[84] M. Guizot came up into our seat, and I thought him greatly\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\n  [84] A book recently published by M. Jean Hanotau, _Letters of\r\n  Prince Metternich to the Comtesse de Lieven_ (1818-1819), shows\r\n  that it was Prince Metternich who set these two ladies against\r\n  one another.\r\n\r\nI am quite overcome by so different a mode of life from that of the\r\nlast six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 14, 1838._--Yesterday I had a very long and very kind\r\nvisit from the Prince Royal, who was quite calm and in a placid frame\r\nof mind.\r\n\r\nI then called upon the Princesse de Lieven, who gave me full details\r\nof her domestic situation, which excluded conversation upon any other\r\ntopic and reduced me to the position of audience. She thinks she will\r\ncertainly be able to stay here _ad vitam æternam_ without molestation.\r\nI hope she may. In the evening I went to the Tuileries, to pay my\r\nrespects to the Queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 15, 1838._--Great fires are becoming quite\r\nfashionable. The burning of the London Stock Exchange will form a\r\ncounterpart to the destruction of the Winter Palace at St. Petersburg,\r\nwith the difference that a hundred persons perished in Russia, while\r\nno loss of life took place in England. Paul Medem told me that the\r\nWinter Palace was three times as large as the Louvre, and that six\r\nthousand persons lived there; that the Imperial pharmacy was situated\r\nin the middle of the castle, and that an explosion resulting from a\r\nchemical experiment had caused the conflagration.\r\n\r\nI did not go out yesterday. M. de Sainte-Aulaire came to lunch with my\r\nsister and myself, after which I had a call from M. Royer-Collard, who\r\nis much better this year. I saw MM. Thiers and Guizot with M. de\r\nTalleyrand. We had a long and tiresome family dinner, after which my\r\nsister and myself found nothing better to do than to go to bed at\r\nhalf-past nine. I have not entirely recovered my strength. A\r\nconversation with Dr. Cruveilhier, only too similar to that which I\r\nhad at Tours with Dr. Bretonneau, has done much to bring back my\r\ndespondency and listlessness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 16, 1838._--Yesterday when I was writing I had heard\r\nnothing of the conflagration which destroyed the _Théâtre Italien_ the\r\npreceding night. The under-manager and four firemen lost their lives.\r\nIt is a great catastrophe, and disastrous for poor people like myself\r\nwhose only pleasure was the Italian Opera. I feel it quite deeply.\r\n\r\nLady Clanricarde came to lunch with me yesterday, and it was a great\r\npleasure to see her again. She is very nice, and we talked over \"dear,\r\never dear England,\" an inexhaustible subject for me.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I took Pauline to a ball given by the Duc d'Orléans; it\r\nwas charming and delightfully arranged. We went away after supper at\r\ntwo o'clock in the morning, which was late for me. However, apart from\r\na bad headache I need not complain of the way in which I got through\r\nmy task. Unfortunately there are many others of the kind, and the\r\nprospect of their multiplicity frightens me. I saw nothing noticeable\r\nat the ball except the delicate appearance of the Duchesse d'Orléans,\r\nwhich unfortunately is not to be explained by any prospect of a child.\r\nI think our excellent Queen looks older, and the Duc de Nemours is\r\nterribly thin. He has grown a beard in the modern style, but so fair\r\nthat it is frightful to behold.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 17, 1838._--Yesterday I spent the morning with my\r\nsister in doing what I detest more than anything else--making a full\r\nround of indispensable calls. In the evening I took her to the\r\nTuileries. The arrangements were most noble and magnificent. She was a\r\nlittle astonished at the forms of presentation here, and I was more\r\nthan usually struck by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 23, 1838._--I have caught a cold as a result of\r\nsitting in a draught which blew straight upon my back at a concert\r\nyesterday at the residence of the Duc d'Orléans; this was the only\r\nthing of which to complain at an evening's entertainment where there\r\nwas no crowd and where the music was delightful, well chosen, and not\r\ntoo long.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand is very well, except for his legs; their weakness\r\ndoes not matter so much, but they are becoming painful, especially\r\nthe toes of one foot, which are not always their natural colour. This\r\nis an ominous sign. I am very anxious, and so is he; in short, I am\r\ngreatly depressed, and everything weighs heavily upon my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 28, 1838._--M. de Talleyrand is not ill, but his mania\r\nfor dining out has not agreed with him. Yesterday at Lord Granville's,\r\nwhen giving his arm to the Princesse de Lieven, he trod upon the folds\r\nof her dress and nearly fell; he did not actually fall, but his knee\r\ngave way, his weak foot turned, and he twisted his big toe. I was\r\ndeeply anxious when I saw him come back in this state. What a sad year\r\nit is! The fact is that since last April nothing has gone right, and\r\nif I did not regard all this as a trial and preparation for a better\r\nworld, I should be quite disgusted with this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, January 30, 1838._--M. de Talleyrand's foot gives him pain,\r\nand the worst of it is the difficulty of finding out whether the pain\r\nis the result of the sprain or the general weakness of the foot;\r\notherwise he is calm, with people always about him, and plays his game\r\nof whist every evening.\r\n\r\nI was with the Queen this evening, who had received the sad news that\r\nmorning of the burning of the palace in Gotha in which her daughter,\r\nPrincesse Marie, was living. Princesse Marie nearly lost her life, and\r\nhas lost much valuable property, albums, portraits, books, her\r\ndiaries, in fact everything. Her diamonds are melted out of the\r\nsettings, which are mere lumps of metal; the large stones alone\r\nresisted the heat, and these must be repolished. And then many\r\nprecious objects which money cannot replace have gone. This first\r\ncloud which overshadows her young happiness is especially cruel,\r\nbecause it raises distrust and destroys the sense of future security.\r\nIt is a real grief to the Queen, the more so as the shock might have\r\ndone the Princess some harm, as she is with child.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 1, 1838._--M. de Talleyrand is anxious about the\r\nstate of his leg and the consequent change necessitated in his mode of\r\nlife. I wish his foot would get strong enough to allow him to get\r\ninto a carriage, but he cannot yet put enough weight upon it to mount.\r\nWant of fresh air and exercise, if this continues, may have serious\r\nconsequences. Meanwhile he is not alone for a single moment from ten\r\no'clock in the morning till after midnight.\r\n\r\nLady Clanricarde came to lunch with me yesterday. In a few days she is\r\nreturning to her dear England, of which I think daily with deep\r\nregret. I knew all that I was losing when I left it, and I have at any\r\nrate counted the cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 2, 1838._--The state of M. de Talleyrand's leg is\r\npretty much the same, though it was slightly less swollen yesterday.\r\nHe is rather despondent, and, I think, too far-sighted not to realise\r\nall the possible ill-results. I cannot say how despondent I feel and\r\nwhat a weight is upon my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 3, 1838._--Yesterday was M. de Talleyrand's birthday,\r\nand he is now eighty-four. Fortunately his leg has seemed much better\r\nduring the last day or two. This fact was the best birthday present he\r\ncould have, or I either.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 5, 1838._--My sister collected some Austrians and\r\nItalians yesterday evening at her house, and engaged a band of\r\nNeapolitan musicians who are here. She got them to sing some of their\r\nnational airs, which are very pretty. M. de Talleyrand was carried up\r\nto my sister's rooms, and played his game there. His leg improves in\r\nappearance, but the sprained foot is weak and painful. I do not know\r\nif he will ever be able to walk again. If he could only get into a\r\ncarriage! His inability to get fresh air makes me anxious.\r\n\r\nHe is sad and worried. Strange to say, he has expressed a wish to make\r\nthe acquaintance of the Abbé Dupanloup, and has asked me to invite him\r\nto dinner on my birthday. I did so at once. The Abbé at first accepted\r\nand then refused. I suspect the Archbishop's hand in this. I shall see\r\nhim to-morrow and get an explanation. When M. de Talleyrand heard that\r\nthe Abbé had refused he said: \"He has less intelligence than I\r\nthought, for he ought to be anxious to come here for my sake and his\r\nown.\" These words have impressed me and increased my vexation with the\r\nAbbé's refusal.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 7, 1838._--Yesterday, in spite of the keen cold, I\r\nwent to the Archbishop, who was very gracious. He gave me, for St.\r\nDorothea's Day, my birthday, which was yesterday, a splendid copy of\r\nthe _Imitation of Jesus Christ_, and another for M. de Talleyrand; for\r\nmy sister a portrait of Leo XII., the Pope who had received his\r\nrenunciation, and for Pauline a handsome religious work. He was\r\ngreatly surprised and vexed that the Abbé Dupanloup had refused to\r\ndine with us; in short, I came away quite satisfied.\r\n\r\nI was still more pleased at the way in which M. de Talleyrand accepted\r\nthe Archbishop's present and listened to my account of our\r\nconversation. He would like the Archbishop to use his authority to\r\ninduce the Abbé Dupanloup to come here. I cannot help ascribing his\r\nexcellent frame of mind to my own feelings in my last illness, and to\r\nthe words which I was then able to speak to him. I bless God for the\r\nsign that He has been pleased to send me by His hidden and always\r\nadmirable means of working and if to complete this great task I should\r\nhave to make a yet greater sacrifice I shall readily do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 9, 1838._--M. de Talleyrand went out yesterday for\r\nthe first time for a drive, which did him good, or, more correctly,\r\npleased him. The effects of his sprain are rapidly passing away, but\r\nthe same is not true of the general condition of his foot, which is\r\nunsatisfactory. He was carried into the carriage and helped out again,\r\nwhich was not so difficult as I thought, but this obvious infirmity is\r\npainful to look at--more painful than I can say. Rumours are believed\r\nthat the Duchesse d'Orléans is with child; however, I think we shall\r\nhave to wait a little before the story can be confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 10, 1838._--It is said that the quarrel between the\r\nFlahauts and General Baudrand will be settled, but I do not think\r\npermanently.[85] Madame de Flahaut comes to see M. de Talleyrand in\r\nthe evenings, and her husband every morning; they are kind and\r\ngracious, as threatened people are.\r\n\r\n  [85] M. de Flahaut and General Baudrand were in constant rivalry\r\n  with one another. They were continually quarrelling about their\r\n  official duties in attendance upon the Duc d'Orléans, and in\r\n  February 1838 they were intriguing to be sent to the coronation\r\n  of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nM. Royer-Collard, whom I saw yesterday for a moment, was delighted to\r\nfind that his speeches the other day had shattered the position which\r\npeople wished the Deputies to resume. There was some friction between\r\nus on this occasion. There is too strong a strain of bitterness in his\r\nnature, which sometimes makes him quite mischievous, though he does\r\nnot know it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 11, 1838._--M. de Talleyrand was able to visit Madame\r\nAdélaïde yesterday, the chief event of his day, and therefore of mine.\r\nThe event of to-day is the snow, which is falling heavily and\r\nincessantly, and brings us back to the middle of the winter.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Dupanloup came to see me yesterday, and paid a long call. I\r\nwas quite satisfied with the result, and he will dine with us in a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nWe also had some people to dinner; the whole of the Albuféra family,\r\nthe Thiers, the Flahauts; and some people come in every evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 15, 1838._--M. de Talleyrand is very busy with a\r\nsmall laudatory speech upon M. Reinhard which he proposes to deliver\r\nat the Academy of Moral and Political Science at the beginning of next\r\nmonth. He is taking trouble with it, and spent several hours over it\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\nThe Baudrand and Flahaut business is not yet concluded. Claims,\r\nhesitations, and equivocations have been forthcoming from either side,\r\nwith the result that the two rivals have become ridiculously bitter,\r\nand, what is worse, the Prince Royal has been involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 23, 1838._--We are still in the midst of cold and\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Nemours has had a sore throat, which threatened to become\r\nquinsy, but his indisposition has not postponed any of the Court\r\nfestivities, and the day before yesterday he was present at the\r\nQueen's ball.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand has a cold and his legs are weak. These are his two\r\nweak points. The former is only a transitory trouble; the other,\r\nthough its remote consequences may be serious, is not threatening at\r\npresent. Such is the true state of affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, February 25, 1838._--I was informed early this morning that M.\r\nde Talleyrand was suffering from a kind of suffocation. This was\r\npurely due to outward circumstances, for he had slipped down in his\r\nbed and was practically buried by his vast bedclothes, with the result\r\nthat a kind of nightmare was the consequence. I have just left him\r\nsleeping peaceably in an armchair. What I do not like is the fact that\r\nfor the last two days he has been more or less feverish, and that he\r\nwill eat nothing or very little for fear of increasing the fever. He\r\nis very weak. The absence of Dr. Cruveilhier, who is at Limoges, is\r\nalso a trouble, and though I feel no immediate anxiety, I am far from\r\nconfident concerning the result of this invalid condition, which seems\r\nto point to a general break-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 3, 1838._--In two hours M. de Talleyrand is going to the\r\nAcademy in cold and most unpleasant rain; I also fear the effect of\r\nthe excitement upon him. There will be a large audience, but no women,\r\nas this Academy will not admit them. I hope that to-day will go off\r\nwell, but I wish it were to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 4, 1838._--M. de Talleyrand is very agitated and very\r\nweak this morning. He made a great effort, and whatever his success, I\r\nfear he will have to pay dearly for it. His success was beyond my\r\nexpectation; the accounts of some fifty people who besieged my room\r\nafter the session leave me no doubt upon that point. He had recovered\r\nhis vocal powers, read excellently well, walked about, seemed younger\r\nand entirely himself, and two hours afterwards he was overthrown and\r\nincapable of making an effort. I do not know what the newspapers will\r\nhave to say of the speech, but if anything can disarm them I think it\r\nshould be the fact that a man at such an age and with so full a past\r\nshould display such energy in delivering in public farewells so noble\r\nand so full of justice and good teaching.[86]\r\n\r\n  [86] For the speech of M. de Talleyrand _see_ Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 5, 1838._--The day has gone off better than I expected\r\nfor M. de Talleyrand. The _Journal Général de France_, which is a\r\nDoctrinaire organ, contained the best, cleverest, and pleasantest\r\narticle upon M. de Talleyrand's speech. Some ascribed it to M. Doudan,\r\nothers to M. Villemain. The article in the _Débats_ was kind, but\r\ndull; that of the _Journal de Paris_ good; of the _Charte_ stupid and\r\nbadly written; the _Gazette de France_ fairly good; the _Siècle_ and\r\nthe _Presse_ insignificant; the _National_ of no account. Against my\r\ncustom, which has been not to open a single newspaper since my return\r\nfrom the country, I read them all yesterday, and shall do the same\r\nto-day; then I shall resume my state of ignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 6, 1838._--M. de Talleyrand had a fainting fit yesterday\r\nbefore dinner. I think it was due to the excessively rigorous methods\r\nof his dieting and to the catarrh of his chest and stomach, which\r\ntakes away his appetite. The blister which will be placed upon him\r\nwill relieve him, I hope. Yesterday's newspapers were not equally\r\nsatisfactory concerning his speech, but he was not disturbed on that\r\naccount, for the intelligent and right-minded members of his audience\r\nhave been really pleased. The house is constantly full of people\r\ncoming to congratulate him. M. Royer-Collard said to me yesterday: \"M.\r\nde Talleyrand has solemnly disavowed the unpleasant incidents of his\r\nlife and publicly glorified the good and really useful parts of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 7, 1838._--M. de Talleyrand had no further attacks of\r\nfaintness yesterday, but he does not look well, and I think him much\r\nchanged. I hear that his brother, the Duc de Talleyrand, my\r\nfather-in-law, is also in a very poor state of health; the Vicomtesse\r\nde Laval is feverish with a bad cold and she cannot sleep. This is\r\nall very sad, and these omens of death depress me greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 8, 1838._--M. de Talleyrand had a better day yesterday.\r\nWe take great care of him: when I came back from a dinner given to my\r\nsister by the Stackelbergs, and from the Queen, to whom I went\r\nafterwards, I found him surrounded by fair ladies and in pretty good\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nIn the morning I took Pauline to ask offerings from the Archbishop. My\r\nsister wished to accompany us, so that I was unable to speak with M.\r\nde Quélen.\r\n\r\nThe Flahaut party have lost all touch with the Pavillon Marsan, except\r\nthe good graces of the Prince Royal, which they seem to be\r\nmonopolising. At the Pavillon de Flore there is a general satisfaction\r\nat their departure, notwithstanding many fine phrases. The Flahauts do\r\nnot understand the truth, and throw the blame upon a Doctrinaire\r\nintrigue, to which the Duc de Coigny is said to have lent his help.\r\nThey are soon starting for England, where I think they will make a\r\npretty long stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 10, 1838._--The Abbé Dupanloup came to see me yesterday.\r\nHe then asked to see M. de Talleyrand, to thank him for the copy of\r\nhis speech which he had sent him. Pauline took him there. He stayed\r\nalone for twenty minutes with M. de Talleyrand, who did not open the\r\nsubject directly, but let some kind words fall, and when the Abbé came\r\nback to my room he seemed to feel some hope. In any case, he has shown\r\ngreat discretion and perfect tact, and I think he is entirely right.\r\nHe was the first to suggest that he should take his leave, and was\r\ntold that he would gladly be seen again. This is all excellent,\r\nprovided we are given time. It is not so much a case of illness as of\r\ngeneral depression and an obvious alteration in his features; but with\r\nsuch a mind one cannot be hasty. What a task it is, and how terrified\r\nI should be of it if I did not tell myself that the most unworthy\r\ninstrument which God is pleased to choose can become more powerful\r\nthan the greatest saint, if God's providence is not pleased to make\r\nuse of him!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 11, 1838._--The English Ministry has triumphantly\r\nsurvived the crisis which was thought likely to become its overthrow.\r\nWill ours pass equally well through next week's crisis, the question\r\nof the secret service funds? Many batteries have been laid in position\r\nagainst it, and a silent agitation is proceeding on all sides. It is\r\nsaid that either extremity of the Chamber will direct a converging\r\nfire upon the Ministerial benches, I suppose with the object of\r\nafterwards shooting one another down upon the field of battle. It is\r\nall very distressing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 14, 1838._--I spent two hours yesterday with the\r\nArchbishop. I was better pleased with his sentiments than with his\r\ndecisions. However, everything has been left for his meditation. He\r\nasked me to write and tell him what I thought, and I hope, with the\r\ngrace of God, Who will cast light here and there, to reach some\r\nsatisfactory conclusion, both for those who are to leave us and for\r\nthose destined to continue their pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the Archbishop I went to the Vicomtesse de Laval, who is\r\nweak and shaken in health, but alert in heart and mind.\r\n\r\nOn my return I found M. de Talleyrand depressed and uneasy; he\r\nrecovered his spirits after a talk with me. The last few days he has\r\neaten a little better. In the evening he was not so weak, and I have\r\njust heard that he had a quiet night. I am swayed incessantly between\r\nhope and despair, but supported by the sense that I am useful, and\r\nperhaps even necessary. If my strength is to fail me, I trust that it\r\nmay last to the end of my task, after which the sacrifice will have\r\nbeen made, as I made it during my illness at Rochecotte.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 15, 1838._--Yesterday I accompanied my sister, who\r\nwished to go once more before her departure to the Chamber of\r\nDeputies. I felt greatly bored. M. Molé spoke very well; M. Barthe was\r\nunbearably superficial; M. Guizot gave us the most wearisome of all\r\nhis sermons; M. Passy was coarse without being clever; M. Odilon\r\nBarrot was very clever and witty, and left neither Thiers nor Berryer\r\nanything to say, but his delivery is so oratorical and so badly\r\nsustained that it is hard work to listen to him. On the whole the\r\nhonours of the session remained with M. Molé; or, to speak more\r\naccurately, if the Ministry gained nothing its adversary lost a great\r\ndeal, which amounts to the same thing at the present moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 16, 1838._--I took Pauline yesterday to mass, to the\r\nsermon, and to the salutation, after which she made her collection.\r\nTwo funerals interrupted the collection, preventing any one from\r\ncoming out, and they were also delayed by a driving rain, so that we\r\nremained standing at the church door for an interminable time.\r\nHowever, the sermon of the Abbé de Ravignan,[87] concerning\r\nindifference in religion and its various causes, pleased me greatly,\r\nand if it is not one of the best sermons I have read, it is at any\r\nrate one of the best that I have ever heard.\r\n\r\n  [87] The Abbé de Ravignan had taken the place of Lacordaire in\r\n  the pulpit of Notre-Dame.\r\n\r\nM. Molé, who was dining here, said that this morning in the Chamber,\r\nduring the formation of the official bodies, the alliance between men\r\nwho were enemies a few months ago was notorious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 17, 1838._--I spent a long time yesterday morning at the\r\nSeminary of Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet, of which the Abbé Dupanloup\r\nis the superior. The good Abbé pleased me greatly, and also expressed\r\nhis satisfaction with the little document which I showed him.[88]\r\n\r\n  [88] The reference is to the letter which the Prince de\r\n  Talleyrand wrote to Rome retracting the errors of his life, which\r\n  had incurred the censure of the Church.\r\n\r\nIn another month we shall have a new poem by M. de Lamartine, called\r\n_L'Ange déchu_,[89] then the _Mélanges littéraires_, by M. Villemain,\r\nand a work by M. de Chateaubriand on the Congress of Verona; in short,\r\nenough reading for the whole summer.\r\n\r\n  [89] Better known under the title of _La Chute d'un Ange_ (_The\r\n  Fallen Angel_), the opening of the poem called _Jocelyn_.\r\n\r\nM. de Talleyrand says that on May 1 he will go to his estate of Pont\r\nde Sains, in Flanders, stay there for the summer, travel to Nice by\r\neasy stages, starting on September 1, and return to Valençay in the\r\nmonth of May 1839. Such extensive projects are decidedly rash, and it\r\nis unreasonable for him to expose himself to the damp of Flanders\r\nafter May 1. I tell him so and trust to Providence.\r\n\r\nThe motto, or rather the conclusion of a letter, which I find in an\r\nold book seems to me very pretty: \"Be with God.\" I have adopted it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 22, 1838._--Princesse Marie, who has been here since the\r\n19th, nearly had a miscarriage yesterday, as the result of too long a\r\ndrive; while the Duchesse d'Orléans can only avoid one by remaining in\r\nher long chair.\r\n\r\nM. de Rumigny, our ambassador at Turin, has brought a foolish dispute\r\nupon himself--a personal quarrel with the King over a matter of\r\netiquette. Complaints concerning him have come to hand. It is the most\r\nfoolish business conceivable, as it is all about the black or white\r\nheaddresses worn by the women. Sardinian etiquette allows the Queen\r\nalone to wear them. How absurd it all is!\r\n\r\nA coalition between MM. Thiers and Guizot seems likely, but there is\r\nsuch an outcry against this combination that either party is\r\nembarrassed, and it will probably come to nothing. M. Guizot in\r\nparticular is experiencing the evil results of it, because his\r\nreputation is suffering greatly, and upon that, rather than upon his\r\ntalent, he regarded his importance to be based. The fact is that\r\nnotwithstanding all that has been said on either side in the speeches\r\nwhich closed last session and the discussions that have filled the\r\ninterval there is something too abrupt in this alliance, which M.\r\nRoyer-Collard calls an impious coalition.\r\n\r\nThere is much talk of a journey to be made by the King to Nantes and\r\nBordeaux for the month of June, which would bring us back to Berry and\r\ntowards Touraine. Hitherto M. de Talleyrand contemplated only Pont de\r\nSains, a calamitous idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 25, 1838._--Yesterday I defied an equinoctial storm to\r\ngo and see the Archbishop. By degrees we came to an agreement, in the\r\nterms of the letter, and I hope that we shall arrive at some useful\r\nresult, but we require time and the help of outward circumstances\r\nwhich do not depend on us and must be asked from a greater Power than\r\nourselves. In any case, if heaven can be importuned by the prayers of\r\nearth, the petitions sent up on this subject should be efficacious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, March 28, 1838._--Yesterday I had a most important\r\nconversation with M. de Talleyrand, and found him in a state of\r\nopen-mindedness which seemed miraculous. I now hope to be able to push\r\nsteadily forward, and though the goal is still far away I trust that\r\nno precipice will form an obstacle to my progress.\r\n\r\nDeath comes upon people here in a terrifying way; M. Alexis de Rougé\r\nwas carried off in twelve hours by a sudden stroke of apoplexy. His\r\nloss has thrown many people into great grief.\r\n\r\nI have called upon Madame Adélaïde, where I heard all the nice things\r\nthat the Duchess of Würtemberg is saying about Germany. The Duchesse\r\nd'Orléans feels that her child has quickened, and I think that her\r\ncondition will be publicly announced in a few days.\r\n\r\nThey say that the young Queen of England gallops down the streets of\r\nLondon through all the omnibuses and cabs. Her old aunts think this is\r\nvery shocking, and so it is.\r\n\r\nIn the English Parliament there is a coalition no less astounding than\r\nthat of MM. Thiers and Guizot; Lord Brougham and Lord Lyndhurst have\r\njoined hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 1, 1838._--Yesterday I went with my sister to the court\r\nof the Louvre to see the bronze statue which is to be sent off in a\r\nfew days to Turin and is on exhibition for the moment. It is a statue\r\nof Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy after the battle of Saint-Quentin,\r\npulling up his horse and putting his sword into its sheath. It is the\r\nwork of Marochetti, a delightful thing, full of grace, nobility, and\r\nlife. I was very pleased with it, and it seems to have met with the\r\ngeneral approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 3, 1838._--Yesterday I gave M. de Talleyrand the little\r\ndocument which I had drawn up for him. The incident passed over\r\nwithout a storm. I suppose that he will have read and digested it\r\nyesterday evening, and I shall see to-day whether the horizon is\r\nclouded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 4, 1838._--The little document was entirely successful.\r\n\r\nYesterday I took my sister to Saint-Roch to hear the Abbé de Ravignan,\r\nwho pleased her greatly. He has a fine face, a beautiful voice, an\r\nexcellent delivery, faith, conviction, warmth, authority, a close and\r\nvigorous style of argument, couched in clear and noble language, with\r\na precise choice of words. He is not prolix and never diffuse. He\r\nlacks unction and his teaching is therefore rather doctrinal than\r\nevangelical, so that his talent had full scope as he was preaching on\r\nthe infallibility of the Church.\r\n\r\nM. de Pimodan, a great Legitimist, who was giving his arm to one of\r\nthe lady collectors, insolently blocked the Queen's passage; the\r\nvicar, the Abbé Olivier, who was accompanying her to the door, and who\r\nis a little thick-set man, strong as a Turk, vigorously elbowed M. de\r\nPimodan to move him out of the way; he flew into a rage, and rudely\r\nasked the _curé_ what he meant by shoving him. The Abbé calmly\r\nreplied: \"I meant, sir, to make room for the Queen\"; upon which the\r\ngentleman muttered some very insolent remarks, which passed unnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe Princesse de Bauffremont, who was to be one of the lady\r\ncollectors, heard the evening before that Madame de Vatry was also to\r\nperform this duty. There were six of these ladies, chosen from\r\ndifferent circles of Parisian society, in order to untie as many\r\npurse-strings as possible. The Princess then said that she would not\r\nbe seen in company with the daughter of M. Hamguerlot, and withdrew.\r\nWas ever such false pride or want of charity?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, April 8, 1838._--The general attention was occupied by the\r\nsession in the Chamber of Peers yesterday. The speech of M. de Brigode\r\nwhich was delivered the evening before had made every one alert, and\r\nthe active part taken by the Duc de Broglie in this discussion seems\r\nto be an event, and is connected with the hostile movement and the\r\nimpious alliance in the Chamber of Deputies. The Ministry made an\r\nexcellent reply to the attacks of MM. de Broglie and Villemain. M.\r\nPasquier, who is angry at an attempt to limit his powers, made a very\r\nbad President. The Ministry is anxious concerning Easter week.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Talleyrand, younger brother of the Prince de Talleyrand,\r\ndied on April 28, 1838. The Duc and Duchesse de Dino then inherited\r\nhis title, which they afterwards bore. The following 17th of May the\r\nPrince de Talleyrand died in his turn, after four days' illness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written on May 10, 1838, but was placed at\r\nthis point of the Memoirs by the author herself.\r\n\r\n   _A letter addressed by the Duchesse de Talleyrand to the Abbé\r\n   Dupanloup with reference to the latter's account of the last\r\n   moments of the Prince de Talleyrand._\r\n\r\n\"I have read with profound emotion, M. l'Abbé, as you may be sure, the\r\nvaluable manuscript which I now beg to return to you.[90]\r\n\r\n  [90] The manuscript in question was an account of the last\r\n  moments of the Prince de Talleyrand, written by the Abbé\r\n  Dupanloup, afterwards Bishop of Orleans. The author never printed\r\n  it, and bequeathed it, with all his papers concerning the Prince\r\n  de Talleyrand, to M. Hilaire de Lacombe, who sent them to the\r\n  Abbé Lagrange, afterwards Bishop of Chartres. He only used them\r\n  for purposes of frequent quotation in the life of the Bishop\r\n  Dupanloup, which he wrote some years ago, and two chapters of\r\n  which are devoted to M. de Talleyrand. These papers are now in\r\n  the possession of M. Bernard de Lacombe. The letter of the\r\n  Duchesse de Talleyrand, transcribed in this volume, is reproduced\r\n  here, although I have already published it in _Le Temps_ of April\r\n  30, 1908.\r\n\r\n\"Everything is related with a truth and simplicity which must, I\r\nthink, touch the hearts of the most indifferent and convince the most\r\nsceptical. I have nothing to add to your account, which perfectly\r\ndescribes all the incidents of the sad event unfortunately\r\naccomplished before our eyes. But perhaps I alone am able to point out\r\nthe course of mental development which for some years had certainly\r\nbegun to modify M. de Talleyrand's feelings. It was a gradual process,\r\nand there is a certain interest in following its slow but sincere\r\ngrowth, as it eventually led him in so consoling a manner to his goal.\r\n\r\n\"I will therefore try to retrace my recollections of this matter, and\r\nI think I shall not go back too far if I begin with my daughter's\r\nfirst communion, which took place at London on March 31, 1834. On that\r\nday she came to ask for the blessing of M. de Talleyrand, whom she\r\ncalled her good uncle. He gave it her tenderly, and then said to me:\r\n'How touching is the piety of a young girl, and how unnatural is\r\nunbelief, especially in women.' However, a short time after our return\r\nto France M. de Talleyrand was alarmed by the strength of my\r\ndaughter's feelings. He was afraid that she might be taught to\r\nmistrust him, or to form unfavourable opinions of him, and even asked\r\nme to find out from what point of view Pauline's confessor treated the\r\nsubject. I put the question directly to my daughter, who replied with\r\nthat candour which you yourself know, that as her uncle did not\r\ninvolve her in any sin she never spoke of him to her confessor, who\r\nonly mentioned him in advising her to pray to God earnestly for him.\r\nM. de Talleyrand was touched by this answer, and said to me: 'Such\r\nconduct is that of an intelligent and deserving man.'\r\n\r\n\"From that time he was anxious that Pauline should have more\r\nopportunities for attending church, and even go some distance from\r\nhome to receive the benefit of your wise direction; he used to offer\r\nher the use of his carriage, and I have sometimes seen him go to\r\npersonal inconvenience for the advantage of his 'little girl.'\r\n\r\n\"Eventually he derived a certain self-esteem on account of Pauline's\r\nreligious earnestness, and seemed to be flattered that she should have\r\nbeen so well brought up under his own eyes; he would often say, in\r\nspeaking of Pauline, 'She is the angel of the house.' He took great\r\npleasure, as all good minds do, in declaring the merits of others. No\r\none could give praise more gracefully, with greater moderation,\r\nadvantage, and propriety; any one who was mentioned or criticised by\r\nhim received all the credit that could be his due. Upon occasions he\r\nwould certainly utter words of blame, but only at rare intervals, and\r\nnever with such direct force as when he praised. He was especially\r\nlenient towards ecclesiastics, and if he disapproved of them it was\r\nonly for political reasons, and never on account of their religious\r\nministrations, while he always expressed himself with great\r\nmoderation. He both respected and admired the ancient Church of\r\nFrance, of which he spoke as a great, a fine, and a magnificent\r\ninstitution. In his house I have seen cardinals, bishops, and simple\r\nvillage pastors; all were received with infinite respect, and became\r\nthe objects of tactful attention. An inappropriate word was never\r\nuttered before them; M. de Talleyrand would never have allowed\r\nanything of the kind. I have seen the Bishop of Rennes (the Abbé\r\nMannay) spend months at Valençay and the Bishop of Evreux (the Abbé\r\nBourlier) stay at M. de Talleyrand's residence in Paris with the same\r\npurity and freedom of conduct and enjoying the same respect as in\r\ntheir dioceses. Towards his uncle, the late Cardinal of Périgord, M.\r\nde Talleyrand was a tender, attentive, and deferential nephew. He was\r\noften to be seen at the Archbishop's house, where he was especially\r\nfond of a talk with the Abbé Desjardins, whom he liked for the\r\ngentleness and the wide range and tact of his conversation.\r\n\r\n\"I have often been astonished at the unconstraint of my uncle's\r\nbearing in the society of ecclesiastics, which I can only explain by\r\nsupposing that he was under a delusion, strange, but real and\r\nlong-lasting, concerning his actual position with reference to the\r\nChurch. He was quite aware that he had dealt the Church a blow, but he\r\nthought that the process of secularisation which he had unduly\r\nstimulated had been one of simplification rather than of\r\ndestruction.[91] As his position thus seemed to him pretty clearly\r\ndefined, he regarded it as easy. This mistake lasted as long as his\r\npolitical life, and only after his retirement did he think of defining\r\nmore exactly his relations with the Papacy. But before this time a\r\nvague instinct made him feel that if, in his opinion, he did not\r\nexactly owe any reparation, he owed at least some consolation to those\r\nwhom he had saddened. He therefore was ready to support the interests\r\nof the clergy upon every occasion, and never refused an alms either to\r\na priest in distress or to a beggar, but tacitly recognised the claims\r\nof both upon him. His charity was great, and I gave him much pleasure\r\nby repeating to him a remark made by a most estimable person, which\r\nwas as follows: 'You may set your mind at rest; M. de Talleyrand will\r\ncome to a good end, for he is charitable.' I was able to remind him of\r\nthis saying at the most solemn hour of his life, as you, M. l'Abbé,\r\nmay remember, and remember, also, what consolation he derived from it.\r\nHe was always deeply grateful to those in retirement from the world\r\nand in convents who prayed for him. He never forgot it, and used to\r\nsay: 'I have some friends among the good souls.' His heart was touched\r\nbecause he was a good man, a very good man indeed; he felt this\r\nhimself when he used to ask me: 'Am I not really better than I am\r\nthought to be?' Certainly he was better than he was thought; only his\r\nneighbours, his friends, and his servants could appreciate the extent\r\nof his simple kindness, his attention, his love, and his loyalty. You\r\nhave seen our tears. The good-hearted alone are thus lamented.\r\n\r\n  [91] M. de Talleyrand had spoken strongly in favour of the\r\n  Concordat. The Pope was aware of the fact, and on March 10, 1802,\r\n  addressed a Papal letter to him which authorised him to re-enter\r\n  civil life, though expressed in somewhat vague terms.\r\n\r\n\"After his return from England he was twice strongly impressed with\r\nsalutary effect by the Christian death of the Duc de Dalberg and by\r\nthe religious habits which characterised the latter part of the life\r\nof Dr. Bourdois, his contemporary, his friend, and his doctor. He was\r\ngrateful to Dr. Bourdois for entrusting him to the clever hands of M.\r\nCruveilhier; he had confidence in his skill, and felt himself honoured\r\nto be so well attended by so religious a man. The earnestness of his\r\ndoctor seemed to be regarded by him as an additional guarantee.\r\n\r\n\"Pope Pius VII. was always the object of his veneration; he devoted\r\nseveral pages of his memoirs to the struggle between this Pope and the\r\nEmperor Napoleon, and his view of the matter was entirely to the\r\nadvantage of the Pope. He had a strong admiration for the policy of\r\nthe Papacy as clever, quiet, gentle, and always uniform, which\r\nqualities he regarded as of first-rate importance in the conduct of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\"Throughout the pontificate of Pius VII. my uncle thought himself in\r\nfairly good odour at Rome. In support of this conviction he often\r\nquoted to me a remark by the holy Father with reference to himself.\r\nThe Pope was then at Fontainebleau, and was speaking to the Marquise\r\nde Brignole, a friend of M. de Talleyrand, and said, referring to my\r\nuncle: 'May God rest his soul; for my part, I have a great affection\r\nfor him.'\r\n\r\n\"M. de Talleyrand was well aware that I often had the honour of seeing\r\nthe Archbishop of Paris, and he had guessed that our intercourse was\r\nactuated by one principal idea as far as M. de Quélen was\r\nconcerned--the desire to preserve his relations with my uncle. M. de\r\nTalleyrand was never worried by him; on the contrary; and though\r\nseveral letters addressed by the Archbishop of Paris to M. de\r\nTalleyrand at different times failed to achieve their object, he was\r\nnone the less touched by the enduring interest he had inspired in a\r\nprelate whose character he honoured and whose sincere zeal and\r\nopen-mindedness he appreciated. He also showed much interest in M. de\r\nQuélen and his political position, which he would like to have been\r\nable to render easier. Upon several occasions I have seen him attempt\r\nto do him some service, by advice which he thought useful, or by\r\nspeaking warmly in his favour at any other time. This he did not\r\nmerely from love of truth, but also as a testimony to the memory of\r\nthe late Cardinal Périgord. He often said: 'I look upon M. de Quélen\r\nas a legacy from my uncle, the Cardinal. He likes us and our name and\r\neverything connected with the Cardinal.' On New Year's Day he used to\r\ninstruct me to leave his card at the Archbishop's house, saying, 'We\r\nshould always treat him as a grandparent.' He never saw me start upon\r\na visit to Saint-Michel or to the Sacré Cœur[92] without asking me\r\nto give his respects to the Archbishop. When I came back he used to\r\nask me for news of him and whether his own name had been mentioned,\r\nand what M. de Quélen had said of him. He would listen attentively to\r\nmy answers, smile, and say at length: 'Yes, yes, I know that he is\r\nvery anxious to win my soul and to offer it to the Cardinal.' Up to\r\nhis last year these remarks were never uttered very seriously, but\r\nwith great kindliness.\r\n\r\n  [92] The Archbishop de Quélen, who was out of sympathy with the\r\n  Government of 1830, was threatened in 1831 by an insurrection\r\n  which pillaged the Archbishop's residence in Paris. As he then\r\n  had no official residence, he took refuge first in the Convent of\r\n  the Ladies of St. Michel of Paris, and then in that of the Ladies\r\n  of the Sacré Cœur at Conflans, a short distance outside the\r\n  town.\r\n\r\n\"On December 10, 1838, I received very early notice of the death of\r\nthe Princesse de Talleyrand. I was obliged to announce the news to my\r\nuncle, and I was most reluctant to do so, for it was just at this time\r\nthat he was attacked by violent palpitations which made us fear a\r\nsudden death. Excitement above all was to be avoided, and I was afraid\r\nthat this news might cause him some agitation. But it was not so, and\r\nhe immediately replied calmly in words which much surprised me: 'That\r\ngreatly simplifies my position.' At the same moment from the pocket of\r\nhis dressing-jacket he drew out some letters and told me to read them.\r\nThe first was written by a religious lady at the Sacré Cœur; M. de\r\nTalleyrand had known her well in past years, had done her some\r\nservice, and always called her his old friend; she was Madame de\r\nMarbœuf. In this letter she spoke to him of God, and sent him a\r\nmedal, which he always used to wear, and which to-day becomes yours.\r\n\r\n\"The second letter was sent to him by a clergyman near Gap, who was\r\nentirely unknown to him, and who spoke of God with admirable and\r\ntouching simplicity.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, the third letter, inspired by the warmest faith,\r\nopen-mindedness, reason, and sincere interest, boldly touched upon my\r\nuncle's religious position. He wrote a few lines to the Duchesse\r\nMathieu de Montmorency to thank her for it, and constantly carried\r\nthis letter about with him in a little pocket-book, where I found it\r\nafter his death. He often spoke of it, and of the noble and\r\nunfortunate lady who had written it, and always with warmth and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\"He also knew that one of my cousins, Madame de Chabannes, a nun of\r\nthe Grandes Carmélites at Paris, constantly prayed for him; he was\r\ntouched by the fact, and would say to me, when speaking of these pious\r\npeople: 'The good souls will not despair of me.' I know nothing so\r\ngentle or so loving as this saying of his, which showed that he had no\r\nfear that God would abandon him.\r\n\r\n\"In the case of any one who knew him as well as I did, attempts to\r\nurge him too rapidly along this path would have been tactless. It was,\r\nindeed, necessary to give these various impressions time to develop,\r\nand with him nothing was done quickly; his trust in time was infinite,\r\nand it was faithful to him unto death.\r\n\r\n\"Whenever I spoke to my uncle of his marriage, as I often did, I was\r\nnot afraid so show him my surprise at a mistake as inexplicable as it\r\nwas fatal in the eyes of God. He then replied: 'The truth is that I\r\ncannot give you a satisfactory explanation of it; it was done at a\r\ntime of general disturbance, when people attached no great importance\r\nto anything, to themselves, or to others; there was no society and no\r\nfamily, and every one acted with complete carelessness in the midst of\r\nwars and the fall of empires. You do not know how far astray men may\r\nwander in periods of great social upheaval.' The same idea may be\r\nfound in his proposed declaration to the Pope, the original of which\r\nis in my hands, when he wrote: 'This revolution which has swept\r\neverything away and has continued for the last fifty years.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus you may see that not only did he make no attempt to justify his\r\nmarriage, but that he did not even try to explain it. His domestic\r\nlife had been very unhappy under the Empire and the Restoration, and\r\nsince that time I have always seen him embarrassed and ashamed of this\r\nstrange bond which he no longer wished to bear, but the painful chain\r\nof which he could not entirely break; and when death broke it for him\r\nhe realised his deliverance to the full.\r\n\r\n\"Some time afterwards, in March 1836, one of his servants was attacked\r\nby an illness which was soon declared mortal. My daughter induced the\r\nman to see a priest and to receive the sacraments. M. de Talleyrand\r\nknew of it, and expressed his satisfaction. On this occasion he said\r\nto me: 'Any other procedure in our house would have been a scandal\r\nwhich would certainly have caused unpleasant talk; I am delighted that\r\nPauline should have prevented it.' The same evening he related the\r\nincident to Madame de Laval, and enlarged with satisfaction upon the\r\ninfluence which Pauline exerted upon the whole house by her firm and\r\nmodest earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"In the spring of 1837 my uncle desired to leave Fontainebleau,\r\nwhither he had come for the marriage of the Duc d'Orléans, before the\r\nCourt had finished its stay. He told me to remain and to be present at\r\nthe great festival which the King gave at Versailles a few days later.\r\nI rejoined him afterwards at Berry, where he had been anxious to go in\r\ntime to meet the Archbishop of Bourges at Valençay, who was passing\r\nthat way while making a tour of his diocese. I heard from Pauline that\r\nM. de Talleyrand had shown special attention to the prelate, even to\r\nthe point of changing his personal customs. On Friday and Saturday he\r\nhad declined to have meat upon his table, and all the meals were\r\nserved as for a fast day.\r\n\r\n\"During the summer of the same year, 1837, the superior of the Sisters\r\nof Saint-André, who were established at Valençay by the care of M. de\r\nTalleyrand, came to inspect this community. He called at the Castle,\r\nwhere he was asked to dinner. As we left the table M. de Talleyrand\r\nsaid to me: 'I have an idea that the Abbé Taury is a member of the\r\ncommunity of Saint-Sulpice; go and ask him.' I brought back a reply in\r\nthe affirmative. 'I was sure of it,' he returned with satisfaction;\r\n'there is a gentleness and reserve and a sense of propriety in the\r\nmembers of that community which is quite unmistakable.'\r\n\r\n\"On Sundays and great festivals M. de Talleyrand was always present at\r\nmass when he was at Valençay; on his two patron saints' days, St.\r\nCharles and St. Maurice, he was also present, and would have felt hurt\r\nif the vicar had not come to say mass at the Château. His behaviour in\r\nchapel was entirely proper, and notwithstanding his infirmity he\r\nwould always kneel down at the right moment. If there was no mass, if\r\npeople came late or made a noise, he noticed it as being improper.\r\nDuring mass he read attentively either the _Funeral Orations_ of\r\nBossuet or his _Discourse upon Universal History_. One Sunday,\r\nhowever, in November 1837 he had forgotten his book, and took one of\r\nthe two which Pauline had brought for herself. It was the _Imitation\r\nof Jesus Christ_. As he gave it back to her he turned to me and asked\r\nme to give him a copy of this admirable book. I offered him mine,\r\nwhich he afterwards took to mass in preference to any other.\r\n\r\n\"He regarded it as important that the officiating priest should\r\nperform the service in full, and often quoted the Archbishop of Paris\r\nas the ecclesiastic whose conduct of the service was most to his taste\r\nand most dignified. One Sunday I ventured to tell him that during mass\r\nmy thoughts had wandered in his direction. He wished to know them, and\r\nI ventured to tell him that I had been wondering what his thoughts\r\ncould be when he remembered that he too had held the same distinction\r\nas the priest officiating before him. His reply seemed to me to be an\r\nobvious proof of the delusion under which he was concerning his true\r\necclesiastical position. He said: 'Why do you think it strange to see\r\nme at mass? I go there as you do, or any one else. You are constantly\r\nforgetting that I have resigned my orders, which fact makes my\r\nposition very simple.' At that time he wished to show me the letters\r\ngranting his resignation, but they were at Paris. After his death I\r\nfound them, with all the papers relating to this business, and very\r\ncurious they are. I examined them carefully; they showed me that his\r\nmarriage alone had been the great obstacle to his reconciliation with\r\nthe Church; his other offences had been pardoned and the\r\necclesiastical censure removed at Paris by Cardinal Caprara in the\r\nname of the Pope.\r\n\r\n\"I referred just now to the attention with which M. de Talleyrand used\r\nto read Bossuet's _Discourse on Universal History_; this fact recalls\r\nto my mind an incident which seemed to me remarkable. One day at\r\nValençay, I think in the year 1835, he asked me to come into his room.\r\nI found him there reading. 'Come,' he said, 'I wish to show you how\r\nmysteries should be spoken of; read aloud and read slowly.' I read the\r\nfollowing: \"In the year 4000 of the world's history, Jesus Christ the\r\nson of Abraham in time, the Son of God in eternity, was born of a\r\nvirgin.' 'Learn the passage by heart,' he said to me, 'and see with\r\nwhat authority and what simplicity all mysteries may be concentrated\r\nin these few lines. Thus and thus only it is proper to speak of holy\r\nthings. They are imposed upon us, but not explained to us. That fact\r\nalone secures their acceptance; in other forms they are worthless, for\r\ndoubt begins when authority ends, and authority, tradition, and\r\ndominion are only revealed sufficiently in a Catholic church.' He\r\nalways had something unpleasant to say about Protestantism; he had\r\nseen it at close quarters in America, and had preserved a disagreeable\r\nmemory of it.\r\n\r\n\"In the month of December 1837 I felt seriously ill. We were then at\r\nmy house at Rochecotte, where, unfortunately, spiritual resources are\r\nfew. However, as I felt in some danger I wished to send for the local\r\nclergyman. My uncle heard of it, and as I was getting well he showed\r\nsome surprise. 'So you have reached that point,' he said to me; 'and\r\nhow did you get there?' I told him as simply as I could, and he\r\nlistened with much interest. In conclusion I added that, among many\r\nother serious considerations, I had not forgotten that of my social\r\nposition, which I was the more bound to remember in view of its\r\nimportance. He then interrupted me quickly and said: 'In truth there\r\nis nothing less aristocratic than unbelief.' Two days afterwards he\r\nre-opened a similar conversation of his own accord, made me go through\r\nthe same details, then looked at me steadily and said: 'You believe,\r\nthen?' 'Yes, sir,' I replied, 'firmly.'\r\n\r\n\"During our last stay together at Rochecotte he heard of the arrest of\r\nthe Archbishop of Cologne; he seemed to regard it as an important\r\nevent. 'This may give us back the line of the Rhine,' he said\r\nimmediately. 'In any case, it is a grain of Catholicism sown in\r\nEurope; you will see it rise and grow vigorously.'\r\n\r\n\"At that time I came across a passage dealing with the limits of the\r\nspiritual and temporal powers, which is to be found in the discourse\r\ndelivered by Fénelon at the consecration of the Archbishop of Cologne.\r\nI showed this fine passage to my uncle, who was delighted with it, and\r\nsaid: 'That should be copied and sent to the King of Prussia.'\r\n\r\n\"When we returned to Paris in the month of January 1838 M. de\r\nTalleyrand was soon deprived of the little exercise which he had been\r\nable hitherto to take. He sprained his foot at the English Embassy,\r\nwhere he was dining, on January 27. The winter was very cold, and the\r\ndouching which was ordered for his sprained foot to restore its\r\nstrength gave him a cold. The cold became bronchitis, and he could not\r\nsleep or eat. Every morning he used to complain of his harassing\r\ninsomnia. 'When one cannot sleep,' he said, 'one thinks terribly.'\r\nOnce he added: 'During these long nights I recall many events of my\r\nlife.' 'Can you give yourself reasons for them all?' I asked him.\r\n'No,' he said; 'in truth there are some I do not understand in the\r\nleast; others that I can explain and excuse; and others, too, for\r\nwhich I blame myself the more severely as they were performed with\r\nextreme carelessness, though they have since been my chief cause of\r\nself-reproach. If I had acted according to any system or principle,\r\nthen I should certainly understand them, but my actions were performed\r\nwithout consideration and with the carelessness of that age, as was\r\nalmost everything done in our youth.' I told him that it was\r\npreferable, in my opinion, to have acted thus than as a result of\r\nfalse doctrine. He admitted that I was right.\r\n\r\n\"It was at the end of one of these conversations that your letter\r\narrived, M. l'Abbé, the letter that you quote in your interesting\r\nnarrative. He handed it to me to read, and said somewhat abruptly: 'If\r\nI were to fall seriously ill, I should ask for a priest. Do you think\r\nthe Abbé Dupanloup would come?' 'I have no doubt of it,' I replied;\r\n'but he could only be of any use to you if you re-entered the\r\ncommunion from which you have unfortunately departed.' 'Yes,' he\r\nreplied, 'I owe something to Rome, I know well, and have thought of it\r\nfor a long time.' 'For how long?' I asked him, surprised, I admit, at\r\nthis unexpected beginning. 'Since the last visit of the Archbishop of\r\nBourges to Valençay, and afterwards when the Abbé Taury came there. I\r\nthen wondered why the Archbishop, who at that time was more directly\r\nmy spiritual pastor, did not open the subject. Why did the apostle of\r\nSaint-Sulpice never speak to me?' 'Unfortunately,' I replied, 'they\r\nwould not have dared.' 'Yet,' he said, 'I would have welcomed anything\r\nof the kind.' Deeply moved by such satisfactory words, I took his\r\nhand, and, standing before him with tears in my eyes, I said: 'Why\r\nwait for any one to open the question? Why not take for yourself\r\nspontaneously, freely, and nobly the step that is at once most\r\nhonourable to yourself, most consoling to the Church and to all\r\nright-minded people? I am sure that you would find Rome well disposed,\r\nwhile the Archbishop of Paris is deeply attached to you; so make the\r\ntrial.' He did not interrupt me, and I was able to go further into\r\nthis delicate and even thorny question, though it was a question that\r\nI thoroughly understood, as it had been repeatedly explained to me by\r\nM. de Quélen, who had been anxious to make me realise all its\r\nbearings. We were interrupted before I had been able to say all I\r\nwished, but on going to my room I wrote M. de Talleyrand a long letter\r\nunder stress of my deep devotion. He read it with that trustfulness\r\nwith which he was accustomed to rely upon my instinct when his\r\nreputation and his real interest was at stake. So my letter made an\r\nimpression upon him, though he did not tell me so until later, when he\r\ngave me a paper for M. de Quélen, of which I will speak afterwards.\r\n\r\n\"In the month of March 1838 he read a eulogy upon M. Reinhard at the\r\nAcademy of Moral and Political Science. His doctor feared the effect\r\nupon him of such an enterprise. Our attempts to dissuade him were in\r\nvain. 'This is my last appearance in public,' he said, 'and nothing\r\nshall keep me back.' He was anxious to use the opportunity for\r\nexplaining his political doctrines and for showing that they were\r\nthose of an honest man. He even hoped that he would be thus of some\r\nuse to those who proposed to follow a diplomatic career. The evening\r\nbefore the meeting he went over his speech with me, and said: 'The\r\nreligion of duty; that will please the Abbé Dupanloup.' When we\r\nreached the passage concerning theological study I interrupted him to\r\nsay: 'Admit that that is intended much rather for yourself than for\r\ngood M. Reinhard.' 'Why, certainly,' he replied, 'there is no harm in\r\nletting the public see my point of departure.' 'I am delighted,' I\r\nsaid, 'to see you overshadowing the end of your life with the\r\nrecollections and traditions of your early youth.' 'I was sure you\r\nwould be pleased with it,' was his kindly reply.\r\n\r\n\"M. de Talleyrand bore the strain of this fatiguing meeting, where he\r\nwas successful in every way, remarkably well. From the point of view\r\nof literature and politics he was successful, and also as a nobleman\r\nand an honest man. When he returned home he at once sent the first\r\nproofs of his speech to M. de Quélen and to you. He expected your\r\napproval, and was touched by it.\r\n\r\n\"Then his health seemed to improve; he recovered his strength, made\r\nplans for travel, and talked of Nice for the following winter; he felt\r\nhis powers reviving, and noticed it with pleasure. On April 28,\r\nhowever, when he heard of his brother's death, who was eight years\r\nyounger than himself, he put his hands before his eyes and said:\r\n'Another warning, my dear child. Do you know whether my brother\r\nrecovered his memory before death?' 'Unfortunately not, sir,' I said.\r\nHe then resumed with extreme sadness: 'How dreadful it is thus to fall\r\nfrom the most worldly life into dotage, and from dotage into death!'\r\n\r\n\"This painful shock did not check the improvement in his health, and\r\nwe were able to think that he had been restored to life. I am the more\r\ncareful to observe that this was the moment, when all idea of an\r\napproaching death was far away, when he chose to undertake seriously\r\nthe project of submission to the Pope. He drew up a form of\r\ndeclaration without saying anything to me of it, a kind of pleasant\r\nsurprise which he wished to keep for me. One day, when he saw me ready\r\nto go to Conflans to M. de Quélen, he drew from the drawer of his\r\ndesk, the desk at which I am now writing, a sheet of paper covered on\r\nboth sides, with erasures at several points. 'Here,' he said, 'is\r\nsomething which will secure you a hearty reception where you are\r\ngoing. You shall tell me what the Archbishop thinks of it.' On my\r\nreturn I told him that M. de Quélen deeply appreciated the paper, but\r\nwished the statements there expressed to be presented in a more\r\ncanonical form, and intended to send him the ecclesiastical formula in\r\na few days.\r\n\r\n\"You know better than any one, sir, that thus the matter was actually\r\ncarried out. M. de Talleyrand also spoke to me on the same day of his\r\nintention to write an explanatory letter to the Pope when sending him\r\nthe declaration. He went into full details, and insisted upon his\r\nwillingness to speak of Pauline in this letter. He ended by a saying\r\nwhich seems to me of considerable importance: 'What I am to do should\r\nbe dated during the week of my speech to the Academy. I do not wish\r\npeople to be able to say that I was in my dotage.' This idea was\r\ncarried out upon his deathbed, and was performed as he wished.\r\n\r\n\"But here I must stop. Attractive as the subject may be, your\r\nnarrative contains full details. Moreover, during my uncle's illness I\r\nwas nothing more than his nurse, and my actions were confined to\r\nsummoning the consolations of your presence and to obeying my uncle by\r\nreading to him the two addresses to Rome before he signed them. I\r\nforced myself to read them slowly and seriously, because I neither\r\nwould nor could diminish in any way the merit of his action; it was\r\nnecessary that he should thoroughly understand what he was about to\r\ndo. His faculties were too clear, heaven be praised, and his attention\r\ntoo concentrated, for any hurried or confused reading to have\r\nsatisfied him. It was for me to justify his touching confidence which\r\nhad induced him to wish this important reading to be performed by\r\nmyself, and only the firmness and clearness of my pronunciation could\r\nsatisfy this condition. He was to be left to the last moment in full\r\nconsciousness of his act and full freedom of his will. From this\r\ndifficult task I have derived the complete indifference with which I\r\nhave afterwards faced any doubts, attacks, or calumnies of which I\r\nhave been the object.\r\n\r\n\"I can say in the sight of God that there was no ignorance or weakness\r\non the part of M. de Talleyrand; there was no delusion and no abuse of\r\nconfidence on my part. His generous nature, the recollections of his\r\nearly youth, his family traditions, the wide experience of a long\r\ncareer, the example of Pauline, some explanations which I was\r\ninstructed to give him, the confidence with which you were able to\r\ninspire him, the revelation that comes to every man at the gate of the\r\ntomb, and above all the infinite mercy of a gracious Providence--such\r\nare the reasons which allow us to honour him as sincerely in his death\r\nas we loved him in his life.\r\n\r\n\"Carried away by a subject which is near to my heart, I have\r\noverstepped the limits which I had at first laid down, but I have no\r\nfear that I have wearied you by recalling your attention to details\r\nwhich I know you will value, and which for me have the special\r\nadvantage that they have established, M. l'Abbé, between us, a bond\r\nwhich nothing can weaken or break.\r\n\r\n    \"DUCHESSE DE TALLEYRAND,\"\r\n    \"PRINCESSE DE COURLANDE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Heidelberg, August 27, 1838._--I have been here with my daughter\r\nsince yesterday evening. My sister, the Duchesse de Sagan, arrived the\r\nprevious evening. This morning, at six o'clock, faithful to my habits\r\nat Baden, I went out while my sister and daughter were still asleep,\r\nand while recalling memories of the place I found the bridge and\r\nstopped before the statue of the Elector Charles Theodore; I then\r\ncrossed the river and walked upon the banks of the Neckar for\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, with the town upon my left, dominated by\r\nthe old castle. The pretty landscape, with the river valley, the\r\nposition of the town, and even the style of the agriculture, reminded\r\nme of the hillsides of Amboise and my dear Loire, and was pleasantly\r\nlighted by the broken rays of a sun struggling through light clouds.\r\n\r\nI now know who wrote the article upon M. de Talleyrand which appeared\r\nin the _Gazette_ of Augsburg. My sister read it in manuscript. The\r\nwriter was the Minister Schulenburg, a clever man, who had seen a\r\ngreat deal of M. de Talleyrand in past times. He is a friend of the\r\nVicomtesse de Laval, and saw M. de Talleyrand at her house once more\r\nwhen he came to Paris eighteen months ago. He is anxious not to be\r\nknown as the author of this article.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 6, 1838._--I arrived here the day before yesterday,\r\nand found a letter which told me that as M. Molé had refused to make\r\nan alliance with M. Guizot, the latter had formed a coalition with M.\r\nThiers. M. Guizot will become President of the Chamber of Deputies and\r\nM. Thiers Prime Minister. All this is to be revealed and settled\r\nduring the discussion upon the Address. I cannot guarantee this story.\r\nThe King is at Eu, and I shall not see the Court until I return.\r\n\r\nI am just finishing the last work of Villemain.[93] The first chapter\r\nof the second volume deals with Montesquieu; the second is a detailed\r\nanalysis of the _Esprit des Lois_, which is much too deep for me. The\r\nfollowing chapters summarise the bad philosophy of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, as it appears in the mouths of its prophets, its votaries,\r\nand its adversaries. The last part of the volume is devoted to\r\nRousseau, by whose charms Villemain seems too obviously to have been\r\novercome. I have no kindly feelings for Rousseau, for he was a\r\nhypocrite, and Voltaire's cynicism is perhaps less disgusting; at any\r\nrate, Voltaire was not guilty of so many positively bad actions as\r\nRousseau, and mere talent in itself is no justification for either\r\nman.\r\n\r\n  [93] _The Eighteenth Century._\r\n\r\nMy children write from Valençay saying that the crowd at the funeral\r\nceremony was enormous.[94] Starting from Blois, the procession was\r\njoined by the people of all the neighbouring settlements on foot, in\r\ngreat sadness, while at night they came with torches. On the carriage\r\nwhich bore the coffin of M. de Talleyrand and that of my\r\ngranddaughter, Yolande, were Hélie and Péan;[95] in the carriage which\r\nfollowed was my son Alexandre. All the clergy of the district offered\r\ntheir services. My son Valençay also sends me the programme of the\r\nceremony, which seems very well arranged; I especially approve of a\r\nlarge distribution of charity to the poor, who should never be\r\nforgotten, neither in joy nor sorrow.\r\n\r\n  [94] The funerals of the Prince de Talleyrand, of his brother,\r\n  the Duc de Talleyrand, and of the little Yolande de Périgord,\r\n  daughter of the Duc and Duchesse de Valençay, who died in\r\n  childhood, took place on September 6, 1838, at Valençay. The\r\n  three coffins were placed in a vault which the Prince de\r\n  Talleyrand had constructed during his lifetime.\r\n\r\n  [95] The Prince de Talleyrand's footmen.\r\n\r\nBefore starting, the coffin of M. de Talleyrand was covered with black\r\nvelvet, with silver nails, and bore an escutcheon with his arms, his\r\nname and distinctions; the coffin of Yolande was covered with white\r\nvelvet. The arrival of the funeral procession in the Castle court at\r\nValençay, at ten o'clock at night in the most beautiful moonlight, is\r\nsaid to have been extremely imposing; there was deep silence, broken\r\nonly by the sound of the hearse as it slowly passed the draw-bridge.\r\nThe bodies were placed for the night in the church, and watched by the\r\nclergy in prayer. The coffin of the Duc de Talleyrand, accompanied by\r\nthe doctor who had attended him, arrived two hours later.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 7, 1838._--The Princesse de Lieven, whom I saw\r\nyesterday, told me that she no longer receives any letters from her\r\nhusband. She examined me closely as to any information I might have\r\ngained in Germany concerning her Emperor, whom I think she really\r\nhates as much as the inhabitants of Warsaw can hate him. If, however,\r\nshe was once more within his grasp, or merely out of France, her\r\npatriotism would be equal to that of any old Muscovite. She told me\r\nthat at Munich the Emperor Nicholas had displayed great exasperation\r\nwith the Russian Minister at the enormous expense to which he had gone\r\nfor the reception of the Empress, saying, \"Do you wish, then, to\r\nincrease our unpopularity?\" She spoke a great deal of the father's\r\ncarelessness with respect to his son's well-being. Apart from the\r\nrapidity of their journey, and the scanty food which the father gave\r\nhim in the course of it, he made the Grand Duke continually hold his\r\nlegs outside the carriage, no matter what the weather might be, in\r\norder that they should not be in his father's way.\r\n\r\nI am assured that Queen Victoria, who showed herself so anxious to\r\nescape from the maternal yoke, is now trying to avoid the influence of\r\nher uncle, King Leopold.\r\n\r\nThe Flahaut family have been saying the most horrible things at London\r\nabout the Tuileries, and the Tuileries are aware of the fact.\r\n\r\nFrance has abandoned Belgium in the course of the negotiations in\r\nprogress at London, and forces her to yield upon all questions of\r\nterritory, but supports her pecuniary claim; between the figures of\r\nLeopold and King William there is a difference of 16,000,000. The\r\nPowers wish to compromise, but Leopold objects, and refuses to relax\r\nhis grasp of Limburg until the crowns are paid.\r\n\r\nIn Spain Queen Christina is trying to make money out of everything,\r\nand demands a price for every nomination that she makes. She thinks\r\nonly of amassing money and spending it quietly out of Spain, for which\r\nshe may speedily have an opportunity. Her sister, whose practical mind\r\nhas already gained her a certain influence here, and who might be able\r\nto marry her prettiest daughter to the Duc de Nemours, is intriguing\r\nvigorously against her.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers spent three hours with Count Metternich near Como, and\r\nshowed anything but sympathy for Spain during the conversation.\r\nHowever, people have not been taken in and prejudice remains\r\nunaltered.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bonnétable, September 17, 1838._--I reached this strange place an\r\nhour before dinner-time. The country is very pretty, but the castle\r\nstands at the end of a little town, and the only view is the high-road\r\nwhich runs along the moat. It is an old manor-house, with heavy\r\nturrets, thick walls, and the windows few and narrow. There is little\r\nin the way of furniture or decoration, but it is solid and clean, and\r\nthe necessaries of life of every kind are at hand, from an almorne to\r\na warming-pan. The mistress of the house, an active, bustling,\r\ngood-tempered lady, is largely occupied in most charitable work, in\r\nwhich she shows great insight, and really leads the life of a\r\nChristian widow, on the principles laid down by St. Jerome. In short,\r\none is inclined to think oneself in a country far away from France and\r\nin a century quite remote from the nineteenth. Evening prayers are\r\nsaid all together at nine o'clock in the chapel, and are read by the\r\nDuchesse Mathieu de Montmorency herself. They moved me deeply,\r\nespecially the prayer for the rest of the departed, repeated by one\r\nwho has survived all her relatives, whether older, of her own age, or\r\nyounger than herself. This prayer in the mouth of one who is thus\r\nalone, without forefathers or posterity, was strangely sad. The other\r\nisolated being, poor Zoé,[96] who repeated the responses, completed\r\nthe picture and the impression, which went to my heart. All the\r\nservants were present. No more edifying spectacle could be seen than\r\nthat of this great and ancient house. The Duchesse is very highly\r\nconnected, and came to her title through the Luynes, who had inherited\r\nit by marriage from the Duchesse de Nemours, one of whom had married\r\nthe niece.\r\n\r\n  [96] Zoé was a negress in the service of the Vicomtesse de Laval,\r\n  to whom she showed the greatest devotion. In 1838, after the\r\n  death of the Vicomtesse, Zoé was taken into service by the\r\n  Duchesse Mathieu de Montmorency, daughter-in-law of Madame de\r\n  Laval, who lived upon the estate of Bonnétable, where Zoé ended\r\n  her days in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bonnétable, September 18, 1838._--If the weather were not so damp I\r\nshould find much interest in this place, which is quite unique. Mass\r\nbrings the household together every morning at ten o'clock; we do not\r\nlunch until eleven o'clock, and have then half an hour for walking in\r\nthe moats, which are dry and have been turned into gardens by the care\r\nof the Duchesse; she also took us for a walk around her kitchen garden\r\nand the whole of her strange household. After lunch we worked round a\r\ntable at an altar-cloth, while the prior read his newspapers aloud. At\r\none o'clock we went to visit the fine hospital and the schools founded\r\nby the Duchesse; everything is perfectly arranged, and much better\r\ncared for than the castle. There are six beds for men and six for\r\nwomen, a kind of boarding-school for twelve girls, and classes for\r\nday scholars and the poor, together with a large dispensary. This is\r\nall in one place, with the necessary outbuildings. Eight sisters do\r\nthe work of the establishment, which is really very fine. The Duchesse\r\nthen made us get into an old carriage with worm-eaten lining, but\r\ndrawn by four handsome horses, driven very cleverly four-in-hand by\r\none of the coachmen of Charles X. With Madame de Montmorency\r\neverything is in contrast. She inherited her taste for horses from her\r\nmother, and indulges herself in that respect; she has no taste for\r\ncarriages, and does not care if the one makes the other look shabby.\r\nThus drawn over shocking roads, we reached a magnificent forest of\r\nfull-grown timber, where the fine trees are only cut every hundred\r\nyears. It is really beautiful. In the centre of this forest, where six\r\nroads meet, is a vast clearing; there the Duchesse has built a china\r\nfactory, with all the necessary outbuildings, which is almost a\r\nvillage. She has spent a great deal of money on it, and admits herself\r\nthat it is not a lucrative investment, but it gives occupation to\r\nsixty-eight people, is a reason for a pretty walk, and an additional\r\ninterest for herself. I made a few purchases, and Pauline was\r\ninterested in seeing the pottery moulded, fired, painted, and\r\nenamelled.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner one of the local clergy called while we spent our time in\r\nembroidery, as after lunch, and talked of matters of local interest.\r\nThen came prayers, good-night, and sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bonnétable, September 19, 1838._--Yesterday it rained all day. No one\r\nwent out except the clergy, who were going to a retreat at Mans, and\r\nstopped here to pay their respects to the Duchesse. The sisters also\r\ncame in for their orders. The Duchesse is in very good spirits. She\r\nhas the gift of narrative, and kept the conversation going very well\r\nthroughout a long day, without the smallest appearance of ill-nature.\r\nWhen I went down to my room she lent me a manuscript book of her\r\nthoughts. She writes wonderfully, and her writing displays a wealth\r\nand variety of astonishing description. The outpourings of her heart\r\nsince her husband's death are especially touching, and display a\r\ntenderness of feeling which would hardly be guessed from her outward\r\nappearance. I shall leave her entirely overcome by the warmth of her\r\nreception, her fine qualities, and the admirable example which she\r\nsets here.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, September 27, 1838._--Yesterday I had a most unexpected\r\npiece of news which grieved me deeply: Madame de Broglie is dead of\r\nbrain fever, though she was so young, at any rate for death--a year\r\nyounger than myself--though she was so happy, healthy, beautiful,\r\nuseful, distinguished, and beloved. In one short week she was carried\r\noff, though prepared for death by her constant goodness. It has been\r\nno surprise to her.\r\n\r\nAlmost the same day, but after a longer illness, amid the dissipations\r\nof too worldly a life, died Lady Elizabeth Harcourt. She was of the\r\nsame age, and also handsome, but I think in no way prepared for the\r\ndread passage.\r\n\r\nWith the death of my brother-in-law, the Prince of\r\nHohenzollern-Hechingen, I have heard of three deaths during the last\r\nweek. Last month Anatole de Talleyrand died; in the month of July\r\nMadame de Laval; on May 17 M. de Talleyrand; on April 28 my\r\nfather-in-law; in March my uncle Medem. In less than seven months\r\neight persons have disappeared who were bound to me by ties of blood,\r\nfriendship, or intercourse. Death surrounds me on every hand, and I\r\ncan no longer trust either to the freshness of my daughter or to the\r\ncares of others; only the goodness of God can be infallibly trusted,\r\nand on His infinite mercy I must rely, and confide my loved ones to\r\nHis care.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two days of her life Madame de Broglie was delirious,\r\nand chanted the Psalms so loudly that one could hear her from one end\r\nof her residence to the other. When she was not singing she talked to\r\nher brother and her daughter who had died years before.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, October 3, 1838._--I am again in this beautiful spot, so\r\nrich in memories and so deprived of life and movement. I reached here\r\nyesterday in the moonlight, which suits the place so well, and which\r\nM. de Talleyrand always pointed out to us with such admiration. It was\r\nan unpleasant journey: broken carriages, tired horses, bad\r\npostillions, torn harness, and abominable roads, as they are being\r\nrepaired or constructed afresh; in short, a series of petty obstacles,\r\nwhich troubled and vexed us, and made us late. M. de Talleyrand's old\r\ndog, Carlos, was strangely excited at our arrival, and pulled Mlle.\r\nHenriette by her dress, as if he would say, \"Come and help me to look\r\nfor the missing one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 9, 1838._--I am now again in Paris, though I cannot\r\nconceal the fact that a stay in this town makes me sadder than ever.\r\nHow I long for my workmen, my garden, the soft skies of Touraine, the\r\nquiet of the country, the restfulness of the fields, time to think and\r\nto reflect, of which I am here deprived by constant business and\r\nworry!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 12, 1838._--Yesterday I went to the Convent of the\r\nSacré Cœur, where I stayed a long time with the Archbishop of Paris.\r\nHe gave me an exact translation of the letter of secularisation sent\r\nby Pius VII. to M. de Talleyrand. It is a curious document, and shows\r\nthat even though M. de Talleyrand, with his habitual carelessness, had\r\nmistaken the text, the general sense had been known to him, and that\r\nhe had every reason to say that Rome could not be too exacting without\r\nself-contradiction. As, however, the letter had preceded the marriage\r\nof M. de Talleyrand, and as that marriage was not authorised by the\r\nChurch, it was actually necessary for him to retract. This was done\r\n_in verba generalia_, as Rome admitted, and so every one should be\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned home I gave orders that I should not be disturbed\r\nduring the evening, and busied myself in putting the papers that I had\r\nfound at M. de Talleyrand's house into some order. I shall complete\r\nthis work only by degrees, for it causes me keen emotion. For\r\ninstance, I came upon a note which M. de Talleyrand sent to me from\r\nhis room to mine on February 6, 1837,[97] in which he told me that at\r\nhis supreme hour his only anxiety would be my future and my\r\nhappiness. I cannot say how this scrap of paper has agitated me.\r\n\r\n  [97] February 6 is St. Dorothea's Day, the patron saint of the\r\n  Duchesse de Talleyrand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 13, 1838._--M. de Montrond came to see me yesterday.\r\nHe showed himself extremely kind and soothing; but the true nature of\r\nthings peeps out invariably, and towards the end of his call, which\r\nhad been spent in expressions of regret for M. de Talleyrand's death,\r\nhe let fall a phrase to this effect: \"Do you propose to become a lady\r\nof the Faubourg Saint-Germain?\" I was able to reply that I had no need\r\nto do anything of the kind, that my position was plain: a lady of rank\r\nand independent means, unwilling to sacrifice my opinions here or my\r\nposition there; too deeply attached to the memory of M. de Talleyrand\r\nnot to be on good terms with the Tuileries, and too good company not\r\nto live happily with my family and my own friends. He replied that I\r\nhad not forgotten to speak like M. de Talleyrand himself. Then he\r\nrose, took my hand, and asked me if I would not be kind to him, saying\r\nthat he was alone in the world, that he was very anxious for\r\nopportunities to talk of M. de Talleyrand with me sometimes, and then\r\nhe began to weep like a child. I told him that he would always find me\r\nready to listen to him, and to reply, if he spoke of M. de Talleyrand,\r\na subject of inexhaustible interest to myself. Human nature is\r\nremarkable in its great diversity and its astonishing contrasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 17, 1838._--I have only had two satisfactory incidents\r\nsince my return: the arrival of my son Valençay, who is so good to me,\r\nand a long conversation with the Abbé Dupanloup, which went on\r\nyesterday for two hours at my house. Our minds are in sympathy, and,\r\nwhat is better, we are marvellously alert to divine one another's\r\nfeelings, and both noticed it, owing to the strange and rapid\r\ncoincidence of our expressions. He has a rapidly working mind, and for\r\nthat reason pleased M. de Talleyrand, while with him one is never\r\nembarrassed or hampered, and transitional ideas are never clogged; his\r\nclearness of mind is never marked by dryness, because he has a sweet\r\nand most affectionate soul. My long intercourse with M. de Talleyrand\r\nhas made it difficult for ordinary people to get on with me; I meet\r\nminds which seem slow, diffuse, and ill-developed; they are always\r\nputting on the brake, like people going downhill; I have spent my life\r\nwith my shoulder to the wheel in uphill work. In M. de Talleyrand's\r\nlifetime I took more pleasure in the society of others, because I\r\nfully enjoyed my own society with him; perhaps also because I\r\nsometimes felt the need of rest at some lower elevation. But to-day I\r\nfeel that I am being overcome, in a moral sense, by what the English\r\ncall creeping paralysis; in short, yesterday I was able to spread my\r\nwings for a moment, and it did me good. I complained to him of the\r\nwant of system in my life, of the weariness and oppression which were\r\nthe result of overstrain. He spoke of my reading, and told me that he\r\nthought I should be deeply attracted by patristic literature; he\r\npromised to sketch out a little course of reading for me within my\r\nrange. He is no inquisitive or indiscreet converter of souls; he is a\r\ngood and intelligent man, a pure and lofty soul, discreet and\r\nmoderate, whose influence can never be anything but wise, gentle, and\r\nrestrained.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 18, 1838._--The Princess Christian of Denmark, who is\r\nat this moment at Carlsruhe, is no longer young; but fifteen years\r\nago, when she came to Paris, she was very pretty; her complexion,\r\nhair, and shoulders were especially beautiful. Her features were less\r\nstriking, and those are the most permanent elements in beauty. I know\r\nthat she and her husband have retained a very kindly feeling for the\r\npresent royal family of France. Princess Christian is the\r\ngranddaughter of the unfortunate Queen Mathilda of Denmark. Prince\r\nChristian's first wife was a mad woman with dreadful manners.[98] She\r\nwent to Rome for refuge and to join the Catholic Church, and there she\r\nplunged into the most ridiculous mummeries. Her husband adored her,\r\nand if the King of Denmark had not insisted upon a separation Prince\r\nChristian would have remained under her yoke. He still corresponds\r\nwith her, and has never ceased to regret her loss. The present\r\nPrincess Christian, though prettier, is quite sensible, but has never\r\nhad much influence with her husband, owing, it is said, to the fact\r\nthat she has no children. The first wife was the mother of Prince\r\nFrederick, who is an exile in Jutland.\r\n\r\n  [98] The first wife of Prince Christian of Denmark was Princess\r\n  Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Unfaithful to her husband, she\r\n  was separated from him in 1809, and divorced by order of the king\r\n  in 1810. She died in 1840 at Rome, where she had lived after her\r\n  conversion to Catholicism. She was born in 1784, and married in\r\n  1806.\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 20, 1838._--Yesterday I went with Pauline to the\r\nComédie-Française to hear Mlle. Rachel, who is now causing so great a\r\nsensation. I was not at all pleased. They all acted very badly, though\r\nMlle. Rachel is not so bad as the rest. They played _Andromaque_, in\r\nwhich she took the part of Hermione, the part of irony, scorn, and\r\ndisdain. She went through it accurately and intelligently, but there\r\nis no sympathy or attraction in her acting. She has a thin voice, is\r\nneither pretty nor beautiful, but very young, and might become an\r\nexcellent actress if she had good training. The rest of the company is\r\nwretched. I was very bored, and returned home benumbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 21, 1838._--The Duchesse de Palmella, whom I saw\r\nyesterday, told me a strange thing. She said that the Duke of\r\nLeuchtenberg, the first husband of Queen Doña Maria, had never been\r\nher husband; that on his arrival in Portugal he was attacked with\r\nscurvy, which made him contagious and greatly disgusted his wife, who\r\nadores the little Coburg. She is now expecting her confinement.\r\n\r\nWith Pauline I called upon the Duchesse d'Orléans, who seemed to have\r\nrecovered very well from her confinement. Her child, which she was\r\nkind enough to show us, is really charming. She has every reason to be\r\nas proud of him as she is.\r\n\r\nWe came home for an audience granted me by the Infanta Carlotta, the\r\nwife of Don Francisco. Like myself, they are both staying in the\r\nGalliffet residence.[99] It was a curious interview. The Infanta is a\r\nmuch bolder figure than Madame de Zea, and much taller. She is very\r\nfair, with a face which, though washed out, is none the less stern,\r\nwith a rough manner of speaking. I felt very ill at ease with her,\r\nalthough she was very courteous. Her husband is red-haired and ugly,\r\nand the whole tribe of little Infantas, boys and girls, are all\r\nutterly detestable. The eldest of the princesses is well brought up,\r\ninclined to talk, and graciously took notice of Pauline. In my\r\nopinion, this Infanta would be a most unpleasant Sovereign.\r\n\r\n  [99] After the death of the Prince de Talleyrand the Duchesse de\r\n  Talleyrand sold the residence in the Rue Saint-Florentin to the\r\n  Rothschilds. This house she had inherited from the Prince. She\r\n  then settled in a large suite of rooms in the residence of the\r\n  Marquis de Galliffet, Rue de Grenelle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, October 31, 1838._--During the last two days I have seen a\r\ngreat deal of the Comtesse de Castellane. She speaks of only one thing\r\nwhich she wants, and for which she is working with incredible energy.\r\nI cannot complain, as her efforts show how much she thinks of my\r\ndaughter, to whom she wishes to marry the young Henri de Castellane.\r\nYesterday I went to consult the Archbishop on the point. He, as well\r\nas the Abbé Dupanloup, seems to think that of all the possible\r\nopenings that have hitherto appeared Henri de Castellane would offer\r\nthe best chance of domestic happiness, by reason of his personal\r\nmerits. Both of them say that Pauline ought to choose for herself,\r\nafter due examination. Examination requires acquaintanceship; to\r\nbecome acquainted they must see one another; and to see one another\r\nthey must meet. And so I have reached a new phase in my life, when I\r\nam obliged to give a young man the run of my house in order to see\r\nwhat he is worth. I have known M. de Castellane personally for many\r\nyears, but I have lost sight of him for a long time; besides, he is\r\ngoing to marry Pauline, and not me. He is clever and well-educated,\r\nhard-working, and, I think, ambitious. He is very correct and polite,\r\nlives a retired life, and goes only into the best society; he is a\r\ngood son and a good brother, has an excellent name, but no title at\r\npresent, and no prospect; has few family ties, and wishes to live in\r\nthe same house as myself at Paris, though with a separate\r\nestablishment. He is respectful to his mother, but not on confidential\r\nterms with her; wishes to have a religious wife, though he does not\r\npractise the forms of religion himself. He is to have twenty thousand\r\nfrancs income when he marries, and thirty thousand more from his\r\ngrandmother. He has a childless uncle who is worth forty-two millions.\r\nFor the moment the uncle will not give or promise or guarantee\r\nanything, but he is very anxious for the marriage, and as he is\r\neccentricity personified he may come down handsomely some day. The\r\nAbbé Dupanloup advises me to speak to Pauline on the subject without\r\nany constraint, and also to tell her of other proposals made for her\r\nhand. She does not like Jules de Clermont-Tonnerre, and thinks he\r\nlooks vulgar; the Duc de Saulx-Tavannes horrifies her--as a matter of\r\nfact he has the figure of an elephant, while there is madness in the\r\nfamily on both sides. The Duc de Guiche is not yet nineteen years of\r\nage, has no property whatever, a number of brothers and sisters, a\r\nrather foolish mother, while his family are always in extremities. The\r\nMarquis de Biron is very rich and a good fellow; he is a childless\r\nwidower, but extremely stupid, and a red-hot Carlist. Pauline has\r\nrecently seen M. de Castellane on two occasions, and likes him\r\ngreatly; but she says she would like to know more of him, to make\r\ncertain of his principles and belief. I tell her that there is no\r\nhurry, that she can very well wait, and that in any case I shall not\r\nconsent to any marriage taking place until our business affairs have\r\nbeen wound up, the will declared, and the anniversary of the 17th of\r\nMay over. This is understood, though the parties would like a promise\r\nto be given before that date, without celebrating the marriage. I can\r\nalso understand that they would like to make certain of Pauline, but I\r\ndo not propose to have our throats cut in that way. Madame Adélaïde,\r\nwho is much afraid that Pauline's marriage might prevent her from\r\ngoing to the Tuileries, is a warm supporter of M. de Castellane. She\r\nlet me know that M. de Talleyrand, to her knowledge, had thought of\r\nhim. This is true, but he was more inclined to M. de Mérode, though\r\nfamily arrangements made the proposal impossible; besides, Pauline\r\nlikes M. de Castellane much better than M. de Mérode. Another who has\r\nbeen mentioned to me is Elie de Gontaut, the younger brother of the\r\nMarquis of Saint-Blancard, but he is a young fop, and, though rich,\r\nhis position as younger brother is very pronounced, and that would not\r\nplease Pauline. In short, there is a perfect crowd of suitors, and I\r\ndo not know to whom I should listen. One point is certain, and I shall\r\nmake it perfectly clear: that Pauline herself will have to make the\r\nchoice.[100]\r\n\r\n  [100] Mlle. Pauline de Périgord did in fact marry M. de\r\n  Castellane, on April 11, 1839. He then assumed the title of\r\n  Marquis from his grandfather, who had just died. His father,\r\n  General de Castellane, afterwards Marshal of France, yielded the\r\n  title to him on the occasion of his marriage and never bore it\r\n  himself. From his grandmother, who brought him up, the old\r\n  Marchioness de Castellane, _née_ Rohan-Chabot, whose first\r\n  husband, the Duc de la Rochefoucauld, had left her a large\r\n  fortune, M. de Castellane received as a wedding-gift the property\r\n  of Aubijou, in Auvergne, in the department of Cantal, which will\r\n  often be mentioned in these memoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n1840\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse de Sagan, eldest sister of the Duchesse de Talleyrand,\r\nhad died in the winter of 1840. A number of business difficulties were\r\ninvolved by the disposal of her property, and the Duchesse de\r\nTalleyrand resolved upon a journey to Prussia, which she had not\r\nvisited since her marriage. She was accompanied by her eldest son, M.\r\nde Valençay, while her correspondent, M. de Bacourt, who had been\r\nappointed French Minister to the United States, went to take up his\r\nnew post at Washington, where he remained for several years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amiens, May 16, 1840._--I cannot say with what fear I think of my\r\ndeparture from Paris this morning and of the real trials upon which we\r\nare to enter. I am now on the way to Germany, while you are starting\r\nfor America.[101] But to return to my journey of to-day: the roads are\r\nheavy, the postillions brought us along rather badly, and we did not\r\narrive here until nine o'clock in the evening. I have read a good deal\r\nof the life of Cardinal Ximenes. It is a sober and a serious book,\r\ncorrectly written, but cold, and progress in it is difficult. I do\r\nnot, however, regret my trouble with it, for I know but little of this\r\ngreat character, and he is worth studying.\r\n\r\n  [101] Extract from a letter to M. de Bacourt.\r\n\r\nThe country is beautifully green and fresh, with bushy vegetation. We\r\nhad pleasant weather, in spite of a few showers, but twenty times I\r\ntold myself that travelling was the most foolish of all professions;\r\nto be carried along these interminable roads, bumped upon their rough\r\nsurface, delivered to the tender mercies of postillions, fleeing from\r\nall one loves, going as rapidly as possible towards things and people\r\nwho are quite uninteresting; thus spending one's life as though it\r\nwere eternal, and only realising its shortness when it is at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lille, May 17, 1840._--This morning before leaving Amiens we heard\r\nmass in the fine cathedral. The 17th of May is a date of special\r\nimport to myself. I gave myself some credit for going to mass so far\r\nfrom the house of the rector of the Academy, M. Martin, with whom we\r\nput up; then it was raining hard, and the Picard streets are very\r\ndirty and the pavement detestable.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral is really magnificent; strength, grace, and boldness are\r\ncombined; stained-glass windows alone are wanting, as the light is too\r\nbright. I prayed with all my heart for the dead and for the living,\r\nand for the travellers who are to entrust themselves to the sea or\r\ntraverse unknown lands.\r\n\r\nOn the road from Amiens to this town I read the _Diable boiteux_, the\r\nmerits of which do not attract me in the least. The stories are too\r\nmonotonous and uninteresting, and the constant tone of mockery and\r\nsatire, which is not supported by the fine verse of Boileau, quite\r\ndisgusted me. However, I have read it, and am glad it is over. I now\r\nknow the nature of this book, which has had a certain reputation.\r\n\r\nWe had a better journey than yesterday. Our servants have gone to the\r\noffice to arrange for to-morrow's journey, which will be complicated\r\nby the Belgian railways. After the mediocrity of Amiens and Arras,\r\nwhere I had some broth this morning, Lille strikes one as a large if\r\nnot a great town, but I must admit that at present my travelling\r\ncuriosity is benumbed and my interest remarkably dull.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Liège, May 18, 1840._--We have been fourteen mortal hours on the\r\njourney from Lille to this town, notwithstanding the help of the\r\nrailway. The fact is that to make use of the railway it is necessary\r\nto make a round of twenty leagues, which considerably diminishes the\r\nadvantage of it. From Courtrai one must go up to Gand, touch Malines,\r\nand then to Liège by Louvain and Tirlemont. A vast amount of time is\r\nwasted in stoppages at the numerous stations. Moreover, if one takes\r\none's own carriage time is required to put it on a truck and take it\r\noff again, while the expense for the freight of carriages is so heavy\r\nthat nothing is saved by the railway. It is certainly a marvellous\r\ninvention, and the machinery is interesting. All is worked with\r\nperfect punctuality and order, but at the same time it is an\r\nunpleasant way of travelling, to my taste. There is no time to see\r\nanything; for instance, we passed along the outer walls of several\r\ntowns which I should have liked to examine; we did not even pass\r\nthrough villages, but went straight across country, with no other\r\nevent than occasional tunnels, cold and damp, in which the smoke of\r\nthe engine becomes thick enough to choke one. Even though the wind\r\ncarries away the smoke, it and the rattling of the engine would make\r\nyou imagine yourself upon a steamboat. Imagination was the easier in\r\nmy case as sickness and a certain stupefaction never left me. In\r\nshort, I arrived worn out and more and more displeased with the\r\nfatigues and weariness of my enterprise. At Menin we were told to get\r\nout in a bitter wind to be searched by the Custom House officials;\r\nonly when the examination was half over did they ask for our\r\npassports; upon seeing our rank the Inspector of Customs checked the\r\nardour of his subordinates and allowed us to go. The fortress of Menin\r\nis most carefully kept, and as clean and well restored as it can be;\r\nand yet, if I am not wrong, I think that our protocols had required\r\nits destruction.\r\n\r\nI was struck with great admiration for the wealth and the good\r\ncultivation of all Belgium, and if I had been able to satisfy my taste\r\nfor old buildings by visiting Ghent, Malines, and other places I\r\nshould have been consoled.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bergheim, May 19, 1840._--To travel from Liège to Cologne would have\r\nbeen too long a day, so we are sleeping here in a very clean little\r\ninn, though we have no means of warming ourselves, in spite of the\r\nfact that the wind is icy. It is something of a hardship to be forced\r\nto go without a fire or to be suffocated by a cast-iron stove. I am\r\nundoubtedly a very ungrateful daughter of Germany, as I find\r\nnumberless material discomforts which I did not suspect in past years,\r\nbut which now cause me considerable exasperation.\r\n\r\nI was greatly struck by the delightful country through which we passed\r\non the road from Liège to Aix-la-Chapelle by way of Verviers.\r\nChaudfontaine especially is a charming spot. The direct road would\r\nhave been through Battice, but this road is out of use and repair, and\r\nwe were directed from Liège to Verviers. The richness and beauty of\r\nthe countryside, the activity of the factories, and the river valleys\r\nmade the scene entirely animated and agreeable.\r\n\r\nI was struck by the changed appearance of Aix-la-Chapelle. Although\r\nthe watering season had not yet commenced, the town was as animated as\r\npossible; there are plenty of fine shops and new houses. At the same\r\ntime I should not care to take the waters there, as there is nothing\r\ncountrified about the place, and the walks are all too distant. To-day\r\nI read a large part of a book by the Président de Brosses, _Italy a\r\nHundred Years Ago_. It is written with vigour and cheerfulness, wit\r\nand fancy, but the spirit of the eighteenth century and the writer's\r\npeculiar cynicism are obvious at every page.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cologne, May 20, 1840._--We have reached here so early that we have\r\ndecided to travel another dozen leagues to-day, after seeing Frau von\r\nBinzer, changing our money, and buying some eau de Cologne. How cold\r\nit is here! The change of climate becomes more and more perceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elberfeld, May 20, 1840._--Frau von Binzer is an extremely ugly\r\nperson, but cheerful, sensible, clever, and very loyal. She spent last\r\nyear with my sister, the Duchesse de Sagan, and had only left her for\r\nsix weeks when she was overtaken by death. She wept bitterly in\r\nspeaking of my sister, and assured me that her death was a happy\r\ndeliverance; that she was so sad, so wearied, irritated, and disgusted\r\nwith everything that her temperament had visibly changed. She seems to\r\nhave had fits of actual despair, to have suffered a great deal during\r\nthe last weeks, and to have had several presentiments of her death.\r\nShe made her will on the evening before her last journey to Italy, in\r\nthe course of five minutes, while she had some friends in the house\r\ntaking tea. She told Frau von Binzer what she was doing, to her great\r\nastonishment. She had intended to make another will, but death came\r\nupon her as a punishment for her dilatoriness. Frau von Binzer was so\r\ngrieved at the rapidity of our departure from Cologne that I could not\r\nrefuse to take lunch with her. She lives a long way from the hotel\r\nwhere I had put up, and I therefore had a considerable walk to her\r\nhouse and back. My walk was prolonged because she insisted upon taking\r\nme out of my way to show me the Stock Exchange, an old and curious\r\nhouse of the Templars, the Town Hall, with its curious tower and\r\ndoorway, and the cathedral, which the Crown Prince of Prussia has\r\ntaken under his patronage, and which is being rapidly restored; the\r\nresults will be admirable. We stopped for a moment in front of the\r\nChurch of St. Mary of the Capitol, where Alpaide, the mother of\r\nCharles Martel, is buried. We also looked at two houses belonging to\r\nold aristocratic families in the time of the Hansa, which are in\r\nByzantine style. At the same time Cologne is a very ugly town, and the\r\nRhine is by no means beautiful at the spot where we crossed it.\r\n\r\nHere we are, twelve leagues from Cologne, in the prettiest town\r\nconceivable, which reminds one of Verviers; the country about it is\r\nalso pretty, and somewhat Belgian in character. All is clean and well\r\ncared for. The Prussian roads are truly admirable, the postillions go\r\nmuch better, and the horses are kept in good condition. In this\r\nrespect and in many others the country has undergone a remarkable\r\nchange. At the same time the iron stoves, the beds, and the food cause\r\nme discomfort. The railway is progressing, and it is intended to\r\ncontinue the line to Berlin. The work is being pushed on with great\r\nrapidity, and from Liège nothing is to be seen but navvies, machinery,\r\nand other preparations for this transformation scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mersheden, May 21, 1840._--We reached Arnberg at five o'clock. This\r\nseemed a little early to finish our stage, so we continued our\r\njourney for six leagues more. Now we are in a typical village inn, but\r\nfairly clean, and with very obliging people. We might have found\r\nbetter accommodation at the next stage, but I could not bring myself\r\nto expose the servants any longer to the frightful weather. I have\r\nrarely seen any more dreadful; hail, rain, blasts, and storms all came\r\ndown upon us. None the less I noticed that we were passing through\r\ncountry almost as pretty as that which we saw yesterday. It reminded\r\nme at times of the valley of Baden and of the narrower valley of\r\nWildbad. I am still reading the _Italy_ of the President de Brosses,\r\nwhich is amusing, but not entirely attractive. I will copy two\r\npassages which seem to me fairly applicable to our present mode of\r\nlife: \"Generally speaking, the inconveniences and the causes of\r\nimpatience during a long journey are so many that one should avoid the\r\nfurther vexation of economy in small matters. It is certainly hard to\r\nbe cheated, but we should satisfy our self-esteem by telling ourselves\r\nthat we are cheated willingly and because we are too lazy to be\r\nangry.\" That is a piece of advice which I am inclined to practise too\r\noften. Here is the other passage which also suits my case: \"In foreign\r\ncountries we should be on our guard against satisfaction of the sight\r\nand weariness of the heart. There is as much as you please to amuse\r\nyour curiosity, but no social resources. You are living only with\r\npeople who have no interest in you or you in them, and however kind\r\nthey are, it is impossible for either party to go to the trouble of\r\ndiscovering interest in the other when each knows that they are ready\r\nto part and never to meet again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cassel, May 22, 1840._--The weather to-day was as bad as yesterday,\r\nand the country not so pretty. Cassel is quite as small a town as\r\nCarlsruhe, and looks even less like a residential city. The suburbs\r\nespecially are very poor. I found nothing to admire but a hill covered\r\nwith magnificent oak-trees, which took us a long time both to ascend\r\nand descend. I feel the cold most bitterly, and everything here is so\r\nlate that the lilac is hardly in flower.\r\n\r\nOn arriving I sent for newspapers, in which I saw an account of the\r\nlong-delayed visit of the Hereditary Grand Duke of Russia to Mannheim.\r\nPoor Grand Duchess Stephanie! A year ago such a visit would have been\r\nan event; to-day it is mere empty courtesy, and it must have cost her\r\nan effort to receive it graciously. The only matter of interest to me\r\nin the newspaper was the bad account given, with no attempt at\r\nconcealment, of the King of Prussia's health. This slow illness must\r\nchange all the habits of the royal family and of Berlin society. I\r\nshall certainly not regret the entertainments, but I shall be sorry to\r\nbe unable to pay my respects to the King, who was very kind to me in\r\nmy youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nordhausen, May 23, 1840._--It did not rain to-day, but it is cold\r\nenough for frost. To-morrow we have forty-one leagues to travel if we\r\nare to reach Wittenberg, a severe task which seems to me impossible.\r\nFortunately we have done with the roads and the postillions of Hesse,\r\nwhich have remained faithful to the old Germanic aberrations. In\r\nPrussia both the posting system and the roads are excellent, the\r\nvillages and their inhabitants look greatly superior, but for the last\r\ntwenty-four hours, though the country is not precisely ugly, it has\r\nlost the richness and attractiveness which struck me on the road from\r\nLille to Arnberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wittenberg, May 24, 1840._--Forty-two leagues in twenty-four hours in\r\na country where no one knows what going ahead means, is really\r\nexcellent progress.\r\n\r\nThis town is an old acquaintance of my youth. When we used to go from\r\nBerlin to Saxony and from Saxony to Berlin, Wittenberg was always the\r\nsecond halt, for at that time macadamised roads were unknown. Progress\r\nwas made at a walking pace, ploughing through deep sand. To-morrow I\r\nexpect to cover twenty-seven leagues in nine or ten hours, which\r\noccupied two days in those earlier times. From Nordhausen to this\r\npoint the country is ugly, and the inevitable pine-tree forests have\r\nreappeared. The cradle of my youth was certainly far from beautiful.\r\n\r\nMy curiosity was aroused by Eisleben and Halle, through which we\r\npassed. The former of these towns was Luther's birthplace. His house\r\nis well preserved, and there is a small museum there of all kinds of\r\nthings relating to him and to the Reformation. I only saw the outside\r\nof the house, which is of no special interest, but at the door I\r\nbought a small description of Eisleben and its curiosities, which has\r\nmade me quite learned.\r\n\r\nHalle is very ugly, in spite of a few Gothic exteriors, past which I\r\ndrove. Moreover, these university towns have invariably a character of\r\ntheir own, which is provided by the crowd of wretched students, with\r\ntheir noise and want of manners, who loaf about the carriages, with\r\nlong pipes in their mouths, and seem quite ready to cause a\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 25, 1840._--The rain has been coming down again all day,\r\nand my re-entry to my native town was made under no agreeable\r\nauspices. Fortunately I had no reason to regret that the countryside\r\nwas not in sunshine, for the scenery from Wittenberg here is\r\natrocious. I had forgotten to some extent my native land, and was\r\nsurprised to find it so hideous. However, I must make an exception of\r\nthe bridge of Potsdam, which is really pretty. The bank of the Havel\r\nis bright and graceful with the wooded slopes which surround it,\r\ncovered as they are with pretty country houses. Even Potsdam, which is\r\nonly a summer residence, looks more like a capital town than Cassel,\r\nStuttgart, or Carlsruhe; but half a league further on everything is as\r\ndry and dismal as possible, until the suburbs of Berlin, which gave me\r\na real surprise on the side from which we reached the town. This\r\nhappened to be an English quarter, with iron gateways before the\r\nhouses, and a number of gardens between the gateways and the houses,\r\nwhich are small, but very well kept.\r\n\r\nBerlin itself is a handsome town, but thinly populated, while as\r\nregards carriages, cabs are the dominant feature, and sadness is\r\ntherefore its chief characteristic. I am staying at the Russicher Hof.\r\nOpposite is the Castle; a pretty bridge and the museum on the left;\r\non the right are the quays. It is a pleasant aspect, and my room on\r\nthe first floor is almost too magnificent.\r\n\r\nMy man of business, Herr von Wolff, told me that the King's condition\r\nwas regarded as desperate, and that yesterday he sent for his eldest\r\nson, and entrusted him with the business of government. The scene is\r\nsaid to have been very touching. The King's illness is intestinal\r\ncatarrh, which seems incurable. It is also said that he has had the\r\ndeplorable privilege of bad doctors in Berlin, where the doctors are\r\nexcellent. He can take no food, and is visibly wasting away; but death\r\nis not thought to be imminent. The day before yesterday he walked as\r\nfar as his window to see the troops march past, and those who saw him\r\nwere horrified by the change in his appearance.\r\n\r\nThe whole town is in sadness, and the royal family in despair. The\r\nPrincess of Liegnitz is quite as ill as the King, with severe\r\ngastritis, and is thought to be in great danger.\r\n\r\nM. Bresson, who has just spent an hour with me, is in despair at the\r\nKing's condition. He will see no one except the Princess of Liegnitz,\r\nhis doctors, and the Prince of Wittgenstein. He has seen the Crown\r\nPrince for a moment, but none of his other children, and says he feels\r\ntoo weak to see any one else. A messenger has just been despatched to\r\nthe Russian Empress, to stop her progress at Warsaw, where she is to\r\narrive to-morrow. The King would be in no condition to bear this\r\ninterview, much less the lamentable scenes which the Emperor Nicholas\r\nwould certainly make. The Empress is also said to be in a very sad\r\nway. This approaching death will be a great blow, which will re-echo\r\nnear and far.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 26, 1840._--I slept fairly well. My bed is not quite so\r\nnarrow or so extraordinary as some that I have found on the journey\r\nfrom Cologne to Berlin. Unless one is prepared to sleep on nothing but\r\nfeathers, nothing is to be found but thin, hard mattresses nailed on\r\nto deal boards. The bedclothes are of a remarkable character, while\r\nthe sheets look like towels. I had several of them sewn together, and\r\nthus succeeded in covering my bed. As regards bedrooms, Germany is\r\nundoubtedly in a state of savagery, even more so than with regard to\r\nfood, which is extraordinary enough at times, though in Berlin even M.\r\nde Valençay admits that it is good. The cleanliness is perfect, and\r\nthe furniture tasteful. There are carpets everywhere, and the iron\r\nstoves are replaced by fine porcelain stoves, which give no smell and\r\nheat the room excellently, but it is disappointing to be forced to use\r\nthem on the 26th of May. M. Bresson utters terrible groans about the\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nIs it not strange that I should have felt no emotion whatever upon\r\nre-entering this town where I was born and where I was largely brought\r\nup? I examined it with the same curiosity as I felt towards Cologne\r\nand Cassel, and that was all. I have no feeling of that special\r\npatriotism which I have long felt for Germany. I am a complete\r\nstranger both to things and people, entirely unconnected with the\r\nplace, speaking the language with some hesitation; in short, I am not\r\nat home, or rather ill at my ease, and ashamed at being so. I do not\r\nthink it would be thus if I were to return to London. I do not think I\r\nshould then be delighted; I should probably burst into tears; but at\r\nany rate I should feel some emotion, as I feel at Valençay. I am less\r\nafraid of that which stirs my feelings than of that which freezes\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nEverything goes on here so early that one must be ready at dawn.\r\nWaking up is nothing, but getting up is difficult. I am extremely\r\ntired, even more than when travelling, because when once ensconced in\r\nmy carriage, which is very soft, I can rest in silence, inaction, and\r\nsleep, whereas here things are very different.\r\n\r\nMy man of business from Silesia was at my house at nine o'clock. He is\r\ngoing away this evening to make preparations for my arrival. At eleven\r\no'clock Herr and Frau von Wolff came in. They told me that the Duke of\r\nCoburg was negotiating to buy the estate of Muskau from Prince Pückler\r\nfor his sister, the Grand Duchess Constantine. The garden of Muskau is\r\nsaid to be the most beautiful in Germany. It is only ten leagues from\r\nmy house.\r\n\r\nM. Bresson came in at midday to tell me that there was some\r\nimprovement in the King, that he had been able to take some soup and\r\nto walk round his room. He urged me at the same time not to put off my\r\ncalls upon the chief ladies of the Princesses.\r\n\r\nMidday is the fashionable hour for calls here, so I started off with\r\nM. de Valençay. First we went to the Countess of Reede at the Castle.\r\nShe is the chief lady of the Crown Princess, and was an intimate\r\nfriend of my mother. She was not at home, nor was the Baroness of\r\nLestocq, lady-in-waiting to the Princess William, the King's\r\nsister-in-law. We also went to the Countess of Wincke at the King's\r\npalace to call upon the Princess of Liegnitz. She is an old lady\r\nbelonging to the palace of the late Queen, of which I retained some\r\nconfused idea from my youth. She received us with an old aristocratic\r\nair which pleased me. The Countess of Schweinitz, at the new palace of\r\nPrince William, the King's son, was also at home. Countess Kuhneim, at\r\nthe Teutonic Palace, where the Princess Charles of Prussia resides,\r\nwas out.\r\n\r\nFrau von Schweinitz told me that Prince William was to start to-morrow\r\nto meet his sister, the Empress of Russia, and to stop her from coming\r\nhere. We also went to see the Werthers, who were delighted to talk of\r\nParis; and then to the house of Madame de Perponcher, with whom I\r\nplayed a great deal in my youth. She was not at home.\r\n\r\nBerlin is really a very fine town. The streets are wide and laid out\r\nin regular lines, the houses are tall and regular, there are many\r\npalaces and fine buildings, fine squares with trees, gardens and\r\nwalks, and yet it is gloomy. There is obviously a lack of wealth to\r\nfill the fine setting. The carriages of private individuals are so\r\nmuch like cabs that I was deceived by the resemblance for some time.\r\nThe horses and liveries and everything of the kind are dreadfully\r\nshabby.\r\n\r\nYesterday we dined with M. Bresson, who lives in a beautiful house\r\nwhich my sister the Duchess of Acerenza occupied in past years. The\r\nrooms are fine and beautifully furnished for Berlin, but spoilt by a\r\nhorrible portrait of the French King, whose hand is stretched over a\r\nvast charter--quite an atrocity! The other guests were von Humboldt,\r\nLord William Russell, and M. de Loyère, who is attached to the French\r\nEmbassy. Herr von Humboldt talked in his usual style of all the\r\nrivers, all the mountains, all the planets, and of the whole universe.\r\nHe did not forget his neighbours, whom he did not treat with\r\nsuperlative charity. Princess Albert seemed to me to be very much in\r\nhis bad books, and also to some extent in those of M. Bresson. Lord\r\nWilliam Russell is always taciturn, as a Russell should be. He says he\r\nis not displeased with his position, and anything that separates him\r\nfrom Lady Russell always suits his taste. As for M. Bresson, he is\r\nobviously bored, and the nine years he has spent here have completely\r\nexhausted his patience. I think that he greatly fears the approaching\r\ndeath of the King as likely to affect his position. He complains of\r\nthe effects of the climate, and is obviously beating against his bars.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of this dinner Princess William, the King's\r\ndaughter-in-law, asked me to wait upon her at half-past six. I\r\ntherefore went. She lives in a charming palace, beautifully arranged;\r\nthe conservatories are decorated with marble, the floors are\r\nmagnificent, and the furniture is beautiful; in short, the whole is in\r\nexquisite taste. The Princess was alone, and received me most\r\ngraciously. I stayed a long time.\r\n\r\nThe general fear of a visit from the Russian Imperial family is very\r\ncurious. The royal family is preoccupied with the business of avoiding\r\nanything of the kind, and use a thousand devices for the purpose. They\r\nseem to be afraid of them as of a devastating torrent.\r\n\r\nI have just had a call from Madame de Perponcher. Her queenly bearing\r\nand her regular features have survived the passing of her youth. She\r\nis a clever woman, and her conversation is animated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 27, 1840._--A special luxury in Berlin, to be found in\r\nall the houses belonging to people of importance, are the wide\r\nwindows, which light the rooms brilliantly, and give a bright\r\nappearance to the houses.\r\n\r\nThis morning I had a private audience of the Crown Princess, who lives\r\nin a part of the Castle properly so called. Her large private room is\r\nhandsome and curious. The Princess is very polite, but a little cold\r\nand timid, with beautiful blue eyes, a dull complexion, strong and by\r\nno means attractive features; she limps a little. The conversation\r\nbecame animated upon the arrival of the Crown Prince. He showed me\r\ngreat cordiality, and had just come from the King, who was perceptibly\r\nbetter. This improvement has revived all their spirits, but there is\r\nstill a grave reason for anxiety.\r\n\r\nI dined with Princess William, the King's daughter-in-law; her husband\r\nhas delayed his departure. At dinner there were the Crown Prince and\r\nPrincess, and the two Princes of Würtemberg, the sons of Prince Paul;\r\nthe latter are starting to-morrow to meet their sister, the Grand\r\nDuchess Helena, who is going to Ems, and then to Italy. The other\r\nguests were Prince George of Hesse, brother of the Duchess of\r\nCambridge; a Russian general and an English officer who had come to\r\nlook at the manœuvres; Werther, his wife, and his son, who is going\r\nto Paris to take the place of Arnim till the new appointment is made;\r\nand the Count and Countess of Redern. The Countess is a Hamburg\r\nheiress, entirely ugly; she looks like a blonde Jewess, which is to be\r\nugly twice over.\r\n\r\nI sat near the Crown Prince, who asked me many questions about\r\nVersailles, and was then interested in all the recollections of our\r\nyouth; he has grown very stout and old.\r\n\r\nAt seven o'clock in the evening I was requested to visit Princess\r\nAlbert, and invited to stay for tea and supper. It is impossible to\r\nimagine anything which takes up so much time as Court life here. The\r\nonly satisfactory point is that everyone withdraws before ten o'clock\r\nat night; but at that time one is more exhausted than one would be at\r\ntwo o'clock in the morning at Paris.\r\n\r\nI think that of all the persons I have seen here Princess Albert has\r\nfilled me with the greatest curiosity and interest. At first I\r\nthought her face long and narrow, her mouth large, and the lower part\r\nof her face, when she laughed, very ugly, while the want of eyebrows\r\nwas remarkable; but by degrees I have grown used to her, and find her\r\nactually pleasant. Her teeth are white, she has a cheerful laugh and\r\nlively eyes, her figure is pretty, and she is tall, like myself; but\r\nit is too obvious that she laces very tightly, which is the more\r\nnoticeable as she is never at rest; she wriggles, gesticulates,\r\nlaughs, fidgets, and talks somewhat at random; she never crosses a\r\nroom except at a run and a skip, and does not shine in point of\r\ndignity of bearing, but on the whole she is by no means unpleasant,\r\nand I think that men might find her somewhat attractive. She was very\r\nkind to me, with a frankness and good-nature in putting her questions\r\nas if she had always known me, and poking fun right and left at her\r\nfamily to begin with; she astonished me greatly. The fact is that she\r\nis a spoilt child, accustomed to do and say anything she likes, and is\r\nregarded here as quite beyond restraint. She goes away to The Hague\r\nwhen her family would like her to stay in Berlin, and comes back when\r\nthey think she intends to make a long stay in Holland. In short, she\r\nis a strange being. Her husband is very delicate. Their palace, though\r\npretty outside, seemed to me rather poor within. At her house I saw no\r\none except the Princess of Würtemberg, Madame de Perponcher (reasons\r\nof etiquette forbid her to receive M. de Perponcher, as the Diplomatic\r\nBody are excluded from royal residences), Herr von Liebermann,\r\nPrussian Minister at St. Petersburg, and the Prince and Princess\r\nWilliam, the King's son, who arrived late.\r\n\r\nI cannot be anything but grateful for the reception that has been\r\noffered to me here, but the want of rest overpowers every other\r\nconsideration, and I should like to be back in my dear Rochecotte.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 28, 1840._--This morning I had an audience of Princess\r\nCharles. She has charming features, a fine figure, a high colour,\r\ntired eyes, beautiful manners, and a kind and pleasant way of\r\nspeaking. Her appearance, on the whole, is insignificant, but she\r\nshows much kindness of heart. Her husband is simply vulgar. At the\r\npresent moment he has a mania for seeing operations, and watches all\r\nthe new experiments in surgery. Berlin is just now much excited by a\r\nmode of curing squinting, practised by Dieffenbach. Out of two hundred\r\ncases he has had only one failure, and that was due to the impatience\r\nof the patient. It is a very clever idea, and people come in from all\r\nparts to be made beautiful instead of ugly.\r\n\r\nHere every one professes surprise at the resemblance between Madame de\r\nLazareff and myself.\r\n\r\nI have called upon Princess Pückler, the wife of the traveller; she is\r\na lady who is largely supported by the Court; but she was not at home.\r\nIn the afternoon I called upon Princess William, the Queen's\r\nsister-in-law, who was extremely kind to me. She has been very\r\nbeautiful, and some remnants of her beauty still remain. She is a\r\nleading member of the sect of the Pietists. She introduced me to her\r\nunmarried daughter, a pretty princess of fifteen years of age, whose\r\nface pleased me greatly.[102]\r\n\r\n  [102] The daughter of Princess William of Prussia to whom\r\n  reference is here made married the King of Bavaria a short time\r\n  afterwards.\r\n\r\nPrincess William is the sister of the Dowager Grand Duchess of\r\nMecklenburg, step-mother to the Duchesse d'Orléans.\r\n\r\nI am going to the theatre to see a ballet, in the box of the Countess\r\nof Redern, who insisted upon my coming. Then I shall finish my day\r\nwith the Werthers, who are giving a party for me. I am quite\r\noverwhelmed by my busy life, which is so utterly different from the\r\nidle existence I have led for the last two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 29, 1840._--The ballet here is very well done. The King\r\ntakes great interest in it, and gives an annual subscription of a\r\nhundred and twenty thousand crowns to the Opera, which is a great deal\r\nfor this country. There are many pretty dancers, the theatre is\r\nbeautiful and the orchestra excellent. I have been unable to judge of\r\nthe singers, as I did not go till the opera was over.\r\n\r\nAt the Werthers' I found a rout going on, which was much like all\r\nother parties of the kind. The women were well dressed, but not\r\npretty, the social intercourse somewhat cold, while the men in the\r\nservice wore their uniforms, which gave them a stiff appearance.\r\n\r\nThe King's condition gave less satisfaction yesterday; he had had a\r\nfainting fit after expressing a wish to eat herrings, which was\r\nspeedily satisfied. However, the Princes went to the theatre. The\r\ndoctors persist in saying that his state is not desperate. This is the\r\nopinion, among others, of a certain Dr. Schönlein, who has been\r\nappointed professor at the university here; he comes from Zürich with\r\na very great reputation, and the King has been induced to see him in\r\nconsultation. Princess Frederick of the Low Countries is expected. She\r\nis her father's favourite, and he is as anxious to see her as he is\r\nafraid of the Russian visits. Princess William, the King's\r\nsister-in-law, whose eldest daughter is married to Darmstadt, told me\r\nthat the Hereditary Grand Duke of Russia is deeply in love with\r\nPrincess Marie, his future bride, and she is beginning to feel the\r\nsame towards him.\r\n\r\nI was to have dined to-day with the Crown Prince, but as the King had\r\nhad another fainting fit the High Marshal came to tell me that the\r\ndinner would not take place. The King's precarious condition causes\r\nmuch anxiety to some people who are fond of him, and to others who\r\nrespect him for political considerations. No one, not even the heir,\r\nwas prepared for this crisis, and to their sadness is added perplexity\r\nand hesitation.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning I went for a drive in the Tiergarten, the Bois de\r\nBoulogne of Berlin, and saw the spot where I had been daily taken for\r\na walk in my youth. It is a very pretty wood on the edge of the town,\r\nwell planted, partly in English style, bounded by the Spree, and full\r\nof pretty country houses. It is a very popular resort at Berlin.\r\n\r\nI dined with Lord William Russell, where I heard that there was some\r\nsmall excitement in the Ministry at London, though nothing was likely\r\nto come of it. The present Cabinet is as used to defeats as\r\nMithridates to poison.\r\n\r\nThis morning Herr von Humboldt came to fetch us, and took his niece,\r\nFrau von Bülow, and myself to the Museum. He had told all the\r\ndirectors, professors, and artists to be ready. I therefore saw\r\neverything in the greatest detail. The building is fine and well\r\narranged, the classification perfect and intelligent, and the light\r\nwell managed. The King has acquired some excellent examples of every\r\nstyle of art; an ancient bust of Julius Cæsar in greenish basalt is\r\none of the most beautiful things I know. The Museum is very rich in\r\npictures of the ancient German school; the Etruscan vases are quite\r\nfirst-rate; the fifteenth-century china is very curious; the intaglios\r\nand the medals are in perfect order and tastefully set out. The\r\nofficials, who are clever and full of artistic erudition, did me the\r\nhonours with great courtesy. I replied by asking many questions, and\r\nwas attentive to the answers; but the visit lasted for three hours,\r\nand I was standing all the time, and eventually I nearly collapsed.\r\n\r\nI then went to a great dinner with M. Bresson. As I was starting for\r\nit the Prince of Wittgenstein arrived; he had been requested by the\r\nKing and the Princess of Liegnitz to express to me in the kindest\r\nterms their regret at their inability to see me. The King was not\r\nquite so ill, and had been able to see Princess Frederick of the Low\r\nCountries, his favourite daughter, for whom he had telegraphed, and\r\nwho had hastened to come to him. The Prince of Wittgenstein was most\r\nobliging; he is a stout personage, and is greatly downcast at the\r\nmoment and heart-broken at the King's danger. He has a very kindly\r\nfeeling for France, and is very friendly with Princess William, the\r\nking's daughter-in-law, who overwhelms me with kindness.\r\n\r\nAt M. Bresson's dinner Herr von Humboldt, as usual, relieved every one\r\nelse of the trouble of talking, which is very convenient for lazy\r\npersons like myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, May 31, 1840._--To-day is an important day in the history of\r\nthe country, and one of which the King awaits the issue with\r\nimpatience. The Great Elector ascended the throne on May 31, 1640,\r\nFrederick the Great on May 31, 1740, and I am assured of the existence\r\nof a prophecy that the Crown Prince will ascend the throne on May 31,\r\n1840.\r\n\r\nI went to mass in a church which is hardly a church: it is a great\r\nround hall, covered with a single cupola, surrounded with columns,\r\nwith a large window between each column. Nothing could be less solemn\r\nand less Catholic.\r\n\r\nI dined with Prince Radziwill, who took me up after dinner to the\r\nrooms of his late mother, where I had been a great deal in my youth.\r\nThey are no longer used, and are just as I had known them. Nobody\r\ncould be kinder than all the Radziwills have been to me. The daughter\r\nof the late Princess married the nephew of Prince Adam Czartoryski.\r\nShe is now in the country. The two Radziwill Princes married two\r\nsisters, the daughters of Prince Clary. They all had plenty of\r\nchildren, and live as a very happy family in the same house.\r\n\r\nI had gone home after the dinner, when I received a message from\r\nPrincess William, the King's daughter-in-law, asking me to pay her a\r\nvisit. I found her alone, and she kept me talking for an hour. The\r\nlatest news of the King was very sad. He told his chief groom of the\r\nchamber that he had no hope of recovery, but would not speak of his\r\ndeath for fear of affecting those about him. He is said to have\r\ninsisted upon being carried to-morrow to the window of his room, at\r\nthe moment of the solemn function which has been largely advertised,\r\nand the preparations for which he has supervised from his bed. The\r\nCrown Prince, in the King's name, is to lay the first stone of a\r\nmonument in honour of Frederick II. at the entry of the promenade\r\nUnter den Linden. The whole garrison, all the state bodies, and all\r\nBerlin, are to be present at this ceremony. Stands have been erected\r\nfor the public. My son and myself are to find a place on the balcony\r\nof Princess William, where the Princesses will be.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening at the house of the Prince of Wittgenstein, where I\r\nwent, was Madame de Krüdener, _née_ Lerchenfeld, natural daughter of\r\nthe Count Lerchenfeld and of the Princess of Thurn and Taxis. At St.\r\nPetersburg she was at first a favourite of the Empress, but was\r\nafterwards somewhat discarded because the Emperor appeared to be\r\ntaken with her. She strongly resembles the late Queen of Prussia,\r\nwhich may be explained by her birth, but she has not her majestic\r\nbearing; she is, however, a handsome woman.\r\n\r\nI hear from Paris that there is an attempt to gather the household of\r\nthe Emperor Napoleon for a mission to fetch his remains from St.\r\nHelena. Marchand, his groom of the chamber, was asked if he wished to\r\naccompany the mission; at first he hesitated, and then accepted on the\r\ncondition that he should be allowed to sit at the table of the Prince\r\nde Joinville; to satisfy him he has been appointed captain on the\r\nstaff of the National Guard, and he is to go, and will sit at the\r\nPrince's table! I abstain from comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 1, 1840._--I have just returned from the ceremony, which\r\nwas really most beautiful and imposing. The thought of the King's\r\ndangerous condition, which every one had at heart, gave a singularly\r\ntouching and solemn aspect to this national celebration, the last at\r\nwhich the poor King could be present. And in what manner was he\r\npresent? In bed at his window! Fortunately the weather was less\r\ndisagreeable than it has lately been. The Crown Prince laid the first\r\nstone of the monument which is to support the equestrian statue of\r\nFrederick the Great. Is it not strange that there is no statue of him\r\nas yet in Berlin? Yesterday was the anniversary of his accession a\r\nhundred years ago; but as it was a Sunday the celebration was\r\npostponed till to-day. Each regiment in the army was represented by a\r\ndetachment. The army is really superb, and splendidly equipped.\r\nBesides the state bodies, the authorities, the Consistory, a\r\ndetachment of the Landwehr, deputations from the guilds of arts and\r\ncrafts, with their bands, surrounded the square, which is magnificent\r\nand was most beautifully decorated. Around the monument could be seen\r\nall those who had served under Frederick II., dressed as they were at\r\nthat time, and carrying the flags captured during the Seven Years'\r\nWar. The King himself had considered every detail of this fine\r\nceremony, and had given the most positive orders to forbid any\r\nmanifestation of applause for himself; but the silent and profound\r\nrespect, the perfect order and the sadness of the spectators was\r\nsufficiently striking and touching. When the foundation-stone was\r\nlowered, salvos were fired, bells rang, drums beat, and the old\r\ntattered flags were lowered; at that moment most of the spectators\r\nburst into tears. Nothing of the sort could be looked for in a\r\nrepublican atmosphere or in our revolutionary regions.\r\n\r\nOn the balcony where I was placed I saw Prince Frederick of the Low\r\nCountries, who introduced me to his wife. She was overcome with grief;\r\nshe is not pretty, but looks kind and natural. The young Hereditary\r\nGrand Duke of Russia, who arrived this morning, was present; the Crown\r\nPrince of Prussia introduced me to him. He is said to have grown very\r\nfat. I expected to see a very insignificant young man, but he is quite\r\nthe contrary, although I do not care about his complexion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 2, 1840._--Yesterday evening I went to tea with Madame\r\nde Perponcher, whose _salon_ is, in my opinion, the pleasantest in\r\nBerlin. She is very conversational and well-mannered, while she is\r\nsimple and restrained. She is a central point of society, and her\r\nmother's position with the Crown Princess has helped her largely.\r\nThere I heard that no change has taken place in the King's condition,\r\nthough something of the kind had been feared owing to the excitement\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\nThe suite of the Hereditary Grand Duke of Russia are staying at the\r\nsame hotel as myself, at the King's expense. They make a fearful\r\nuproar, and consume the more food as their board costs them nothing.\r\nIt is impossible to say how the Russians are detested here.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 3, 1840._--Yesterday I was at a great dinner given by\r\nthe Werthers. The King was said to be better; he had had some sleep,\r\nand felt the moral relief of passing the fatal date. During the dinner\r\nI received a message from the young Princess William asking me to call\r\nupon her after dinner in outdoor dress. I went, and we drove out. She\r\ntook me to Charlottenburg, which she showed me in full detail, and\r\nespecially the country house which the King has had built there, where\r\nhe prefers to stay.\r\n\r\nI was glad to see the portraits of the Duc d'Orléans and the Duc de\r\nNemours which were drawn here at the time when they passed through\r\nBerlin. The King bought them for his private room. When we came back\r\nthe Princess made me stay to tea, and I spent all the time alone with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThis morning when I was finishing breakfast M. Bresson came to tell us\r\nthat the King was _in extremis_. In the afternoon I stopped before his\r\npalace; he was still alive, and had even recovered sufficient\r\nconsciousness to demand the reading of the newspapers. There is a\r\ncrowd about the palace; many people are in tears, and the behaviour of\r\nthe population is perfect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 4, 1840._--Yesterday I dined at the house of M. Bresson\r\nwith Princess Pückler, who is starting for Muskau to meet her husband.\r\nHe is returning from Vienna after an absence of six years; she speaks\r\nof him with admiration. She is a little old woman of wit,\r\nintelligence, and tact, and has gained considerable reputation in\r\ndifferent circles.\r\n\r\nOnly yesterday was the publication begun of bulletins upon the King's\r\nhealth; he might be dead at the present moment. Hitherto he had\r\nforbidden any announcements; I do not think he knew anything of it\r\nyesterday. He has preserved his consciousness, and is quite calm,\r\nsimple, and dignified.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince last night the King has been in a kind of agony, from which he\r\nsometimes gains relief by a few drops of coffee. He can still speak a\r\nlittle, and says not a word about his condition, though he realises\r\nits gravity to the full. The whole family, even the grandchildren, are\r\nat the palace, and the Ministers also. The crowd still throngs the\r\nsquare and shows the same interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 5, 1840._--The King was still alive yesterday at eight\r\no'clock in the evening. He had said farewell to his children and\r\nsolemnly handed his will to his Ministers; he then declared that he\r\nhad done with this world and wished to see no one except the Princess\r\nof Liegnitz and the pastor for whom he sent, intending to devote his\r\nremaining time to securing his peace of mind and in considering the\r\nlife to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 6, 1840._--Herr von Humboldt has just left me. The King\r\nwas very feverish last night; he can hardly speak, and seems to have\r\nlost all interest. What a long struggle for a man of seventy! All the\r\nMecklenburg family has arrived. The appearance of the Duke of\r\nCumberland has caused some consternation, and the Emperor Nicholas\r\nwill be here to-morrow in spite of every attempt to prevent his\r\narrival. There is an obvious intention to surround the new Sovereign\r\nfrom the moment of his accession, and this may damage his public\r\nreputation, for the people are apprehensive, and do not hide their\r\nfears. It is an interesting time for spectators, and I am perhaps\r\nwatching the sowing of seed which will produce great consequences.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I wished to fulfil my promise of going to see Frau\r\nvon Bülow at Tegel, which is three leagues from Berlin. At first I\r\nfound the wind very unpleasant, but when we entered a forest which\r\nbegan half-way I was pleasantly sheltered, and the scent of the\r\npine-trees was delightful. On leaving the pine-trees we reached a\r\nsuperb lake, the shores of which were wooded with trees in leaf--an\r\nunusual sight here.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the lake is the fortress of Spandau, at the other the\r\npark, the castle of Tegel, and the monument raised by the late Herr\r\nWilhelm von Humboldt to his wife. It is very pretty. The castle is by\r\nno means extraordinary, but contains some fine artistic works brought\r\nfrom Italy, and a good portrait of Alexander von Humboldt by Gérard.\r\nThe monument is a column of porphyry upon a granite base, and the\r\ncapital is in white marble. The column supports a white marble statue\r\nof Hope by Thorwaldsen, and is surrounded half by an iron railing and\r\nhalf by a great stone bench. All is in excellent taste, and the only\r\npoint which displeased me was that Frau von Humboldt, her husband, her\r\neldest son, and one of the children of Frau von Bülow are really\r\nburied at the foot of this column. I cannot bear graves in gardens;\r\nmy belief requires a common cemetery or vault in a church or\r\nchapel--in short, a spot consecrated to prayer and reflection, and\r\nundisturbed by worldly tumult.\r\n\r\nI drove round the lake, and then took the road back to Berlin. At the\r\ngates of the town I met Lord William Russell, who told me that the\r\nKing was at his last gasp, and that orders had been given to close the\r\ntheatres. My son, whom I found at our hotel on the point of coming in,\r\ngave me the same news. He had just been watching the operation for\r\ncuring squinting, and was full of admiration for Dieffenbach, his\r\ndexterity, and the result of the operation. Of the two patients, both\r\nyoung girls, one did not say a word, and the other cried a great deal.\r\nThe mere demonstration would have made me want to scream. The whole\r\noperation lasts from seventy to eighty seconds. The operator is helped\r\nby three pupils; one raises the upper eyelid, the second depresses the\r\nlower lid, and the third wipes away the blood between the two\r\nincisions. The first incision divides the lower part of the white of\r\nthe eye; then with a little hook Dieffenbach draws forward the muscle\r\ncovered by that part, cuts it through, and the operation is over. This\r\nmuscle, in the case of people who squint, is too short, and brings the\r\neye too close to the nose. As soon as it is cut through the pupil goes\r\nto its proper place.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 7, 1840._--Yesterday evening the King had reached the\r\nend, the death-rattle set in, and there was that motion of the hands,\r\nmechanical but terribly symptomatic, which common people call \"picking\r\nthings up to pack.\" He was unable to speak, and seemed to have lost\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nI am extremely guarded here in discussing either politics or religion;\r\nI hear a great deal, and listen with interest to anything I am told\r\nabout the state of this country, but I am not imprudent in my answers.\r\nPrudence here is easier than in France, where it is almost impossible\r\nnot to be overcome by the contagion.\r\n\r\nI have just been told that the Emperor Nicholas has arrived; I do not\r\nthink he will see the King, from whose room all are excluded, though\r\nhe is still alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 8, 1840._--The King died yesterday at twenty-two minutes\r\npast three in the afternoon, surrounded by all his family, whose hands\r\nhe clasped without speaking. He died in the arms of the Princess of\r\nLiegnitz, for whom the royal family and the public are showing the\r\ngreatest respect. She has perfectly fulfilled her duty. The Prince\r\nRoyal fell fainting at the moment when the King expired. Grief is\r\ngeneral and widespread. The Emperor Nicholas is said to have lamented\r\nloudly; he arrived from Warsaw in thirty-seven hours, accompanied only\r\nby General Benkendorff.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening the troops took the oath to the new Sovereign. The\r\nGovernment has issued a proclamation everywhere of the death, which is\r\ntouching, simple, and perfectly correct.\r\n\r\nI have been to Frau von Schweinitz to hear news of Princess William,\r\nwho takes the title of Princess of Prussia, as her husband is\r\nheir-presumptive, though he is not Crown Prince, since he is the\r\nbrother, not the eldest son, of the new King. The will had been\r\nopened. The late King has ordered a military funeral; his body will be\r\nplaced in the cathedral by day, and, in accordance with his wishes,\r\ntaken to Charlottenburg by night, to be placed in the same vault with\r\nthe late Queen, his wife. I have just visited this monument in the\r\npark of Charlottenburg, yesterday afternoon. It is enclosed in a\r\ntemple in ancient style at the end of a long walk of pines and\r\ncypress-trees; within the temple, between two candelabras beautifully\r\ncarved in white marble, is to be seen, upon a raised platform, a bed\r\nof white marble, upon which the Queen's statue is gracefully and\r\nsimply recumbent, wrapped in a long robe with open sleeves. The bare\r\narms are crossed over the breast, the neck is bare, and the head wears\r\nonly the royal circlet. It is a masterpiece, especially for the\r\ndrapery, which is remarkably true to nature, and the best work of\r\nRauch, the Prussian sculptor, whom the late Queen had educated at\r\nRome. The general effect is beautiful, but too mythological; the\r\nreligious touch which death imperiously claims is wanting.\r\n\r\nThe King will lie in state to-morrow and the day after in military\r\ndress. The body will not be embalmed, and will be interred on\r\nThursday, in accordance with his orders. He also ordered the pastor to\r\npray at his bedside immediately after his death and aloud in the\r\nmiddle of his family, exhorting them to peace and concord. This was\r\ndone, and it is to be hoped that his prayer will be heard, though\r\nthere is no immediate appearance that any one heeds it. The immediate\r\nwithdrawal of the Prince of Wittgenstein and of Herr von Lottum was\r\nexpected, but the new King begged them not to leave him, at any rate\r\nat first. The public is glad to see the father's old servants thus\r\nretained by the son, and the more so as their relations with the\r\nPrince Royal were not entirely agreeable and an earlier change was\r\nexpected. It is to be hoped that there will be no change at all. Such\r\nis the summary of a conversation on my part with M. Bresson and Lord\r\nWilliam Russell; after which I went to see the collection of pictures\r\nbelonging to Count Raczynski, the best private collection in Berlin. A\r\nlarge cartoon by a pupil of Cornelius of Munich, representing one of\r\nthe great battles of Attila, is the best thing there. Tradition\r\nrelates that the battle was continued in the sky, and that those who\r\nperished go on fighting, like shadows in the clouds, at certain times\r\nof the year; the two battles are to be seen in the cartoon. The design\r\nis admirable and well executed. The rest of the collection did not\r\ngreatly attract me.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven writes from Paris: \"We have had a curious week here:\r\nthe Ministry was defeated in the Chamber upon the law for the funeral\r\nof Napoleon, and attempted revenge by sowing discord between the\r\nChamber and the country; after more mature reflection, and after the\r\nproposed subscription had been a partial failure, the matter was\r\ndropped, and the letter of Odillon Barrot concluded it.\r\n\r\n\"The Duc d'Orléans, in Africa, has had a fresh attack of dysentery,\r\nwhich was very dangerous for twenty-four hours.\"\r\n\r\nNow an extract from a letter from the Duc de Noailles:\r\n\"Notwithstanding the complete fiasco concerning the Imperial remains,\r\nThiers retains his strength, and will become complete master. The\r\nproposal of Remilly,[103] which was in sight, will not come up for\r\ndiscussion this year. There will be no dissolution between the two\r\nsessions; after next session dissolution is certain; the new Chamber\r\nwill be moderately, but certainly more Left. Thiers is determined\r\nneither to urge on nor to check progress in this direction; to guide\r\nthe movement, but to follow it, as he thinks that strength and the\r\nmajority are there to be found. He hopes to be able to restrain the\r\nLeft, but in case of failure he has determined rather to obey it than\r\nto resign. So we are definitely embarked upon this path, and this is\r\nthe great event of the winter; the consequences, but not the rapidity,\r\nof the movement can be calculated.\"\r\n\r\n  [103] After the vote upon the secret service funds in March 1840\r\n  one of the Deputies, M. Remilly, attempted to embarrass the\r\n  Ministry by a proposal for Parliamentary reform, providing that\r\n  Deputies should not be promoted to salaried posts or secure\r\n  promotion for their Parliamentary life in the following year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 9, 1840._--Yesterday after dinner I called upon the\r\nCountess of Reede, the chief lady of the new Queen's Court. There I\r\nsaw the reigning Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, brother of the\r\nlate Queen and of the late Princess of Thurn and Taxis, a great friend\r\nof M. de Talleyrand. He spoke of my uncle in the warmest terms, which\r\ntouched me deeply, saying that he had experienced much kindness from\r\nhim under the Empire. I was there informed that, besides the King's\r\nwill properly so called, which dates from 1827, and of which I know\r\nnothing, there is a codicil containing arrangements for the funeral,\r\nand in such detail that the position of the troops in the streets is\r\npointed out. A letter to his successor has also been found, which is\r\nsaid to be full of the wisest counsel; while encouraging his son to\r\navoid innovations of every kind without due consideration, the King\r\nalso advises him to avoid any retrogressive step out of harmony with\r\nthe spirit of the age. It is said that this letter will be published.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned home Herr von Humboldt came to see me, and kept me up\r\nwhile he told me many stories which were doubtless curious, and would\r\nhave interested me were it not for his overpoweringly monotonous\r\nmanner. In any case, he is very well informed of all that goes on\r\nhere, and clever at ferreting out new information.\r\n\r\nThe Russian and the other Courts are starting on Wednesday, the day\r\nafter the King's funeral. I think that the King and Queen will be glad\r\nto breathe a little freely.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 10, 1840._--Yesterday the director of the Museum came to\r\nfetch me, and took me, with my son, to the studio of Rauch, a very\r\nclever sculptor and a very pleasant man. He showed us several statues\r\nintended for the Walhalla of Bavaria; the model of the statue of\r\nFrederick II., the first stone of which I had seen laid; and a Danae\r\nfor St. Petersburg; then a little statue, half natural size, of a\r\nyoung girl fully dressed and holding a little lamb in her arms, which\r\nwas very pretty, and I liked it greatly. Before we went home I was\r\ntaken to see the Egyptian Museum, which is in a building apart.\r\nAlthough the collection is said to be admirable, I could feel no\r\npleasure in looking at the hideous colossi and the numerous mummies.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned home I had a call from Prince Radziwill, who came from\r\nthe Castle, where, with the chief officers of the garrison, he had\r\nbeen passing in parade before the lying-in-state of the late King. The\r\nKing was laid out with his face uncovered, wrapped in his military\r\ncloak, with his little cap on his head, as he had ordered in his\r\ncodicil.\r\n\r\nThe King has bequeathed a hundred thousand Prussian crowns, or three\r\nhundred and fifty-five thousand francs, to the town of Berlin, and\r\nother sums to Königsberg, Breslau, and Potsdam, as being the four\r\ntowns of his kingdom in which he has resided. He has bequeathed the\r\nlittle palace in which he lived as Crown Prince, which he would not\r\nleave as King, and in which he died, to his grandson, the son of\r\nPrince William, who will probably be King one day. The Princess of\r\nLeignitz retains the palace by the side of it, in which she was\r\nliving, the domain of Erdmansdorff, in Silesia, and an income of forty\r\nthousand crowns, to be paid by the State. It seems that the King had\r\nleft from fourteen to twenty million crowns in his private chest. He\r\nhas ordered that each soldier present at his funeral shall receive a\r\ncrown, and each non-commissioned officer two crowns. He has also\r\nordered that his body shall be followed, not only by all the clergy of\r\nBerlin, but by all those of the neighbourhood; they are coming in from\r\nStettin, Magdeburg, and every part of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nM. Bresson was much depressed by the King's death, but has recovered\r\nhis spirits on seeing that the Prince of Wittgenstein is to be\r\nretained at Court, at any rate for the moment. The new King is\r\ntreating his father's old servant most admirably.\r\n\r\nA strange incident which has caused much displeasure was the sight of\r\nthe Russian officers in the suite of the Emperor Nicholas on duty\r\nbefore the body of the late King together with the Prussian officers.\r\nThe Emperor issued the request, and the authorities did not venture to\r\nrefuse, but some ill-feeling has been shown, and the very scanty\r\nliking for Russia has been further diminished.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 11, 1840._--I spent the whole of yesterday paying\r\nfarewell calls, and when I was calling upon Frau von Schweinitz, the\r\nPrincess of Prussia sent for me. With her I found the Prince of\r\nPrussia, and both were very kind to me.\r\n\r\nThe King informed me through the Countess of Reede that he hoped to\r\nsee me later, on my return, at Sans Souci. He has ordered the Chief\r\nMarshal to find me a good place for this morning's ceremony. The\r\nEmperor of Russia is starting this evening for Weimar and Frankfort,\r\nwhere he wishes to see his future daughter-in-law.\r\n\r\nThis morning I went to the ceremony, and just as I was starting out\r\nthe King sent word telling me to go through the Castle, and the\r\nPrincess of Prussia sent me her liveried servants to secure me a\r\nplace. I thus reached the church by way of the royal apartments. I was\r\nin a stand opposite the Princess of Leignitz, who was well enough to\r\nbe present at the ceremony; she was heavily veiled, like all the\r\nladies, and I could not distinguish her features. The church was not\r\ndraped, which gave it too bright an appearance, and the sombre nature\r\nof the ceremony suffered in consequence. The organ, the singing, and\r\nthe sermon by the pastor, the great emotion of the old servants and\r\nchildren of the deceased, the terrible salvos of cannon, and the\r\nbeautiful tolling of all the bells were imposing. Before withdrawing\r\nthe new King offered a prayer of considerable length in a low voice on\r\nhis knees by the coffin. The whole family followed his example, after\r\nwhich the King embraced all his brothers, his wife, his sisters,\r\nnephews, and uncles--in short, the whole of his family. The Emperor of\r\nRussia, who has a fine but terrible face, did the same. There was thus\r\na great deal of embracing for a church. My own opinion is that in the\r\nhouse of God one should be occupied only with worship; but between a\r\nProtestant temple and the Church the difference is considerable.\r\n\r\nThe King of Hanover, who arrived an hour before the ceremony, was\r\npresent. He is old, and though he looks somewhat uncivilised he\r\nappeared to me like an old lamb by the side of a young tiger when I\r\ncompared him with the Emperor of Russia.\r\n\r\nI propose to start to-morrow for Silesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crossen, June 12, 1840._--I left Berlin this morning at half-past\r\nseven in mild and cloudy weather. Thanks to the excellent roads, the\r\ngood horses, and the capital post service, we accomplished thirty-six\r\nleagues in thirteen hours and a half, which is satisfactory travelling\r\nin any country. As far as Frankfort-on-the-Oder, which we crossed in\r\nthe middle of the day, the country is chiefly remarkable for its\r\ndismal and barren character. When the valley of the Oder is reached\r\nthe country becomes less flat and more smiling. Frankfort is a large\r\ntown of thirty-two thousand souls, for whom excitement is provided by\r\nthree large fairs during the year; but apart from those times it is\r\nvery empty. There is nothing attractive about the town. Crossen, where\r\nI am at this moment, which is also on the Oder, is not so large a\r\ntown, but more pleasantly situated. I am now only a few hours from my\r\nown property, and shall arrive there in good time to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, June 13, 1840._--I am now upon my own estates. It is a\r\nstrange impression to find a home of one's own at so vast a distance\r\nfrom the spot where one's life is usually passed, and also to find\r\nthis home as clean and well ordered, though all is quite simple, as if\r\none always lived there.\r\n\r\nThis morning when I started from Crossen it was raining, and the rain\r\ncontinued as far as Grünberg, a large fortress, where I found Herr and\r\nFrau von Wurmb, who had come to meet me. Frau von Wurmb is the\r\ndaughter of a state councillor in the Prussian service, Herr von\r\nGöcking, to whom the late King had entrusted me during my period of\r\nwardship. She married a Westphalian gentleman, Herr von Wurmb, who had\r\nformerly served in the Prussian armies, until his delicate health\r\nobliged him to resign. For many years he has lived in Wartenberg, a\r\nlittle town which belongs to me. There, at first under the direction\r\nof Hennenberg, and since his death alone, he has supervised my\r\nestates, forests, &c. Frau von Wurmb, as my guardian's daughter, was a\r\nconstant companion of my youth. She was very well brought up. People\r\nof good society in Germany do not object to conducting the business of\r\nthose whom they regard as great lords; for instance, the cousin of\r\nBaron Gersdorff, the Saxon Minister at London, manages my sisters'\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nHerr and Frau von Wurmb preceded me here. The last few leagues\r\ntraverse sand and pine forests, but at the entrance to a small hamlet,\r\nwhich does not deserve the name of village, is a pleasant avenue which\r\nleads to a planted court, in the middle of which is a large house;\r\nfine trees hide the outbuildings, which are not an agreeable sight. At\r\nthe back of the house is a pleasant view: a garden very well planted\r\nand kept up, full of flowers, many of them rare; the garden is\r\ncleverly joined to a field, at the end of which is a very pretty wood.\r\nA streams runs through the garden and keeps it fresh. The house is of\r\ndouble depth: it is a long rectangle, with thirteen windows in front;\r\nit is spoilt by its enormous roof, a necessary protection against the\r\nlong-lasting snow in winter, and also by the yellow orange colour with\r\nwhich the bricks have been painted. The interior is not bad. In the\r\nmiddle is a vaulted hall, with a staircase in the background; to the\r\nright of the hall, is a large room with three windows, and further on\r\na little library with two windows opening upon a very pretty\r\ngreenhouse, which is connected with the orangery; there I have fifty\r\norange-trees of moderate size. On the left of the hall is my bedroom,\r\na large dressing-room, wardrobes, bathroom, and the maid's room. These\r\nrooms are doubled in the following way: behind the library is a room\r\ncontaining the rooms opening from the dining-room; behind the\r\ndrawing-room is the dining-room; while behind my own room and the\r\nadjoining ones are the servants' rooms, a bedroom, and a large\r\ndressing-room. On the first floor are four gentlemen's rooms, with\r\ncupboards, of which only two are furnished, and a large billiard-room.\r\nIn the attics are six servants' rooms, a store-room, and a\r\nlumber-room. The living rooms and my own look southwards, and so do\r\nnot get the view of the garden; but I prefer to have the sun, even if\r\nI must look upon the courtyard, especially in a house which has no\r\ncellar; there is, however, no trace of dampness. The ground floor is\r\nvery prettily furnished, and the floors are inlaid with all kinds of\r\nwood, and are surprisingly pretty considering that they were done\r\nhere. On the first floor there is only the room now occupied by M. de\r\nValençay, which is furnished, and that somewhat scantily. In fact, the\r\nhouse contains only what is absolutely necessary, and I am glad that I\r\nbrought some plate; Herr von Wurmb is lending me many things. However,\r\nwe shall do, and I feel better here than I have done for a long time,\r\nbecause here I have at least silence and rest about me. This is the\r\nheart of the country; I do not regret it, and feel a certain pleasure\r\nin the noise of the cows and the bustle of haymaking, which shows me\r\nonce again that I am really of a very countrified nature.\r\n\r\nThere is a fairly good little portrait of my mother in the\r\ndrawing-room, and a very bad one of myself, while in a smaller room\r\nare lithographs of the Prussian royal family. The library is somewhat\r\nrestricted, but contains five hundred excellent books in English,\r\nFrench, and German. I have already been round the garden, which is\r\nquite pretty. The gardener comes from the King's gardens in\r\nCharlottenburg, and has been to Munich and Vienna to perfect himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, June 14, 1840._--This morning at eight o'clock, in\r\nspite of the cold and bitter wind, which seem to be characteristic of\r\nPrussia, I started in the carriage to drive four leagues for mass and\r\nhigh mass too. Wartenberg is two-thirds Catholic, while Günthersdorf\r\nis entirely Protestant. The Catholic church is at the entrance to\r\nWartenberg, a town over which I have some seigneurial rights; each\r\nhouse pays me a small tax. The road runs through my woods for two\r\nleagues until we reach the high-road. The church was full, the priest\r\nat the entrance with the holy water and a beautiful address, while my\r\nseat was strewn with country flowers. There was nothing wanting: a\r\nprocession, the blessing of the Sacrament, the sermon, prayers for the\r\nroyal family and for myself, and a beautiful organ accompaniment,\r\nwhile the children of the Catholic school sang very well. I think the\r\nwhole ceremony lasted nearly three hours. Frau von Wurmb, who lives in\r\none of my houses a short distance from the town, with a pretty garden\r\nround it, was expecting me to lunch. There was no one present except\r\nher own family, which is numerous.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch Herr von Wurmb asked me to see all the servants of my\r\nestates, who had come together from various points to pay their\r\nrespects. Then began a long march past. They form a regular staff, all\r\nnominated by myself and paid from my purse. Such is the custom here\r\nupon large estates: an architect, a doctor, two bailiffs, two\r\ncollectors, an agent, a treasurer, and a head keeper, four Catholic\r\npriests and three Protestant pastors, and the mayor of the town; all\r\ntrue gentlemen and very well educated, speaking and introducing\r\nthemselves perfectly. I did my best to please every one, and made a\r\ncomplete conquest of the priest of Wartenberg, to whom I promised some\r\nembroidery of my own making for his church. When I went away Herr von\r\nWurmb went with me for part of the road to a very pretty enclosure: an\r\nacre or two of forest surrounded with palings, divided by walks, with\r\na little piece of water, a good gamekeeper's house, where the\r\npheasants are brought up most carefully. We saw the sitting hens and\r\nthe little pheasants in coops, and also the full-grown birds, which\r\nwere near the water or flying in the trees. Nearly six hundred are\r\nsold each year. Roe deer and hares also abound.\r\n\r\nIt was five o'clock when I got back. After dinner I went to sleep with\r\nweariness, for the day had been long, and the cold increased the\r\ndrowsiness produced by the open air.\r\n\r\nI am here without newspapers or letters, which I do not miss, and wait\r\npatiently until the post is pleased to make its way to this remote\r\ncorner of the world. I have already told myself that this country\r\nwould form a very pleasant retreat from the shocks by which Western\r\nEurope is always more or less threatened, and in times of revolution\r\none would not mind the severity of the climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, June 15, 1840._--Loving a country life as I do, I have\r\nevery possibility of satisfying my desire here, for as I wish to see\r\neverything in a short time I have not a moment to lose; so to-day I\r\nstarted at nine o'clock in the morning and returned to Wartenberg, to\r\nthe old Jesuit convent called the Castle. It is a considerable\r\nbuilding, with cloisters; the cells of the monks have been transformed\r\ninto pretty rooms, which are now inhabited by the treasurer, the\r\nbailiff, one of the chief stewards, the doctor, the Protestant pastor\r\nand the Protestant school, while there is a very pretty Catholic\r\nchapel, with fresco paintings and an image of miraculous power which\r\nattracts a large number of pilgrims on the 2nd of July every year.\r\nThere is a collection of fine ornaments and sacred vessels of some\r\nvalue. A little glazed cupboard contains the coins and medals offered\r\n_ex voto_; from my chain I took off the little silver medal with the\r\neffigy of M. de Quélen, and placed it with the other offerings.\r\n\r\nThis visit was lengthy, and I concluded it by unearthing from a dusty\r\nspot the portraits of the old landowners who had left this property to\r\nthe Jesuits by will. After giving orders for the restoration of the\r\nportraits I went to see the brewery, the distillery, and the\r\nstockyards, where cattle are bred for sale at Berlin. All this is on a\r\nvery large scale. I have even a winepress, for my vintage is a good\r\none, and also a large plantation of mulberry trees; the silkworms are\r\nbred, the silk wound off and sent to Berlin, where it is woven.\r\n\r\nAfter all this inspection we went to see two farms at Wartenberg; then\r\na very agreeable road between beautiful plantations, all made since my\r\nreign began, which extend for two leagues, brought us to the summit of\r\na wooded hill, from the top of which there is a splendid view over the\r\nOder--an unusual thing in this part of Silesia. On the road my son\r\nLouis was able to get a shot at some roebuck. I returned here at six\r\no'clock in the evening. Fortunately the weather was respectable.\r\n\r\nI have just opened an old writing-desk, in which I have found papers\r\nof my youth--letters from the Abbé Piatoli and many affecting things\r\nof the kind, such as the wedding present given me by the Prince\r\nPrimate; this is a bird in a golden cage which sings and flaps its\r\nwings. Then there are engravings and pieces of embroidery. They have\r\nrecalled so many shadows of the past. There is something remarkably\r\nsolemn in this past thus suddenly revived with such intense\r\nverisimilitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, June 17, 1840._--I set out at ten o'clock in the\r\nmorning, and returned at eight in the evening. First I visited two\r\nfarms which belong to the seigniory of Wartenberg, in the second of\r\nwhich I had lunch. I also visited the church, for in this country both\r\nthe churches and their incumbents are dependent upon the overlord.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch we crossed the Oder by a ferry, and went as far as\r\nCarolath, which is well worth seeing. It is a very large castle upon\r\na considerable elevation, and was built at different times. The\r\nearliest part goes back to the days of the Emperor Charles IV. Neither\r\nwithin nor without are there any traces of style or careful work, but\r\nthere is something grandiose about the general appearance. There is\r\nnothing in the way of gardens except planted terraces going down to\r\nthe Oder. The view is admirable, the more so as the opposite banks are\r\nvery well wooded with magnificent old oak-trees upon an expanse of\r\nturf covered with cattle and horses reared in the Prince's stables.\r\nThe town of Beuthen and the fortress of Glogau make a good effect in\r\nthis countryside. The village is pretty, several factories provide\r\nanimation, and a pretty inn adds a touch of gracefulness. The castle\r\nlords, husband and wife, with their youngest daughter, were away on\r\nbusiness. The eldest daughter, a pretty young person, was at the\r\ncastle with a young cousin and an old steward of the Prince; they\r\nreceived me most kindly. A three-horsed carriage was harnessed, and\r\nafter crossing the Oder by a ford we drove through the great oak-trees\r\nwhich I mentioned above, in the midst of which the Princess has built\r\na delightful cottage, where we were given tea. Unfortunately I was\r\ndevoured by gnats, and returned with a swollen face, while a slight\r\nsunstroke in addition completed my overthrow. In this strange climate\r\ncold is so rapidly followed by heat that one is always caught by\r\nsurprise. However, I am very glad to have seen Carolath. It is a\r\ncurious spot; Chaumont, on the banks of the Loire, gives a fairly good\r\nidea of it.\r\n\r\nThis morning we started again at nine o'clock, my son and myself, to\r\nvisit some of my estates upon the other side of the Oder. The district\r\nis called Schwarmitz, and is more exposed to inundations than any\r\nother. A nephew of the late Herr Hennenberg farms it; he lives at\r\nKleinitz, another of my estates, but he had come to meet me at the\r\ndykes, which toilsome constructions I visited. His wife, the\r\nProtestant and Catholic clergyman, the head gamekeeper, and a crowd of\r\npeople were waiting for us at the farm, together with an excellent\r\nlunch. After the meal we went through the farm in detail, two\r\nfarmhouses and a fine strip of oak forest, and then returned by way\r\nof Saabor. This is an estate belonging to the younger brother of\r\nPrince Carolath. If the castle and park were properly kept up they\r\nwould be preferable to the castle and park of Carolath, though the\r\nsituation is not so good. It is, however, very fine, and the forecourt\r\nmost beautiful. The landowner has been ruined, and was very anxious\r\nfor me to buy Saabor, which is surrounded by my estates, but\r\ntopographical circumstances are no sufficient reason for concluding\r\nsuch a bargain.\r\n\r\nLetters from Paris, which have hitherto gone astray, tell me the\r\nfollowing news: Private correspondence from Africa gives the most\r\nharassing details about that vexatious country. Marshal Valée is again\r\nasking for troops and money.\r\n\r\nThe Prefect of Tours, M. d'Entraigues, has run away from the uproar\r\nwhich threatened him in his prefecture. The Sub-Prefect of Loches is\r\nthe only victim who has been sacrificed to the demands of the Deputy,\r\nM. Taschereau. The nephew of Madame Mollien is transferred from the\r\nprefecture of the Ariège to that of Cantal, and thus becomes the\r\nPrefect of the Castellanes. M. Royer-Collard tells me that he has\r\nsaved M. de Lezay, the Prefect of Blois, and M. Bourbon.[104] With\r\nthis object he asked an interview of M. Thiers, with which he seems to\r\nhave been well satisfied.\r\n\r\n  [104] M. Bourbon de Sarty was the prefect of Marne.\r\n\r\nM. de La Redorte is now Ambassador at Madrid; his wife is too ill to\r\naccompany him. This is an unexpected step forward in his career, and a\r\npush which will cause vexation to all who will have their own\r\npromotion delayed in consequence. I suppose the King must have made\r\nthis concession to his Prime Minister, whose close friend M. de La\r\nRedorte is, by way of recompense for his non-intervention in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d'Orléans on his return from Africa is said to have found the\r\nDuchesse d'Orléans in excellent health; the measles from which she has\r\nsuffered, by removing the centre of irritation, has restored her\r\ndigestion, so that she is able to take food and grow stronger. I am\r\ndelighted to hear it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, June 18, 1840._--It has been raining all day, and I was\r\ntherefore obliged to abandon the project of visiting a small piece of\r\nland belonging to me, half a league away, which is called Drentkau. I\r\ngave a dinner to twelve people, clergy and local authorities. I shall\r\nhave to give two more to do the correct thing. My household is only\r\narranged for twelve people, and I cannot have more guests at one time.\r\n\r\nMy son Louis jabbers German with such effrontery that he is making\r\nrapid progress. I have had a call from Prince Frederick of Carolath,\r\nthe owner of Saabor. His position in this province is analogous to\r\nthat of a lord-lieutenant in an English county.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, June 19, 1840._--I visited two schools within my\r\njurisdiction; they are Catholic schools, and in an excellent state of\r\nefficiency. The education given to the children surprised me, and I\r\nwas most delighted and edified. I gave some prizes by way of\r\nencouragement, and have undertaken to provide for the career of a boy\r\nof twelve whose energy and intelligence are really marvellous, though\r\nhe is too poor to enter the seminary, for which he feels a special\r\nvocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sagan, June 21, 1840._--The day before yesterday at Günthersdorf I\r\nreceived a letter which decided me to come here. Herr von Wolff wrote\r\nto me from Berlin saying that transactions were in progress here of a\r\nvery irregular nature and against the interests of my children; that\r\nhe was coming to put the matter right, and advised me to come on my\r\nside. I therefore started from Günthersdorf yesterday morning with M.\r\nde Valençay. The journey took us six hours. I put up at the inn; as\r\nthings are I do not think it advisable to go to the castle, but how\r\nstrangely I was impressed with the necessity! Here, where my father\r\nand sister lived and where I spent so much time in my youth, I have to\r\ngo to an inn!\r\n\r\nAfter an hour's conversation with Herr von Wolff we went to the\r\ncastle. I recognised everything except things that had been taken away\r\nwith some undue haste, and which perhaps will have to be brought back.\r\nMy eldest sister's old man of business wept bitterly. He is on very\r\nbad terms with Herr von Gersdorff, who looks after the affairs of my\r\nsister, the Princess of Hohenzollern. I saw him, but did not talk\r\nbusiness, in the first place because the matter affects my son and not\r\nmyself, and also because I wished to avoid any open breach.\r\n\r\nSagan is really beautiful so far as the castle and park are concerned,\r\nthough the neighbourhood is inferior to that in which my own estates\r\nlie; but the house is magnificent. I found some old figures of my\r\nfather's time, which revived sad memories. It was a pleasure to see\r\nthe portraits of my family.\r\n\r\nThere is here a certain Countess Dohna, who was brought up first with\r\nmy mother and then with my eldest sister, and who married a man of\r\nvery good position in the country. In her youth she was quite like a\r\nchild of the house. She came yesterday to tea with me, and I was\r\ndelighted to see her and talk with her of my poor sister, the Duchesse\r\nde Sagan, and of her last visit a short time before her death.\r\n\r\nThis morning I went to mass in the charming church of the Augustine\r\nmonks, where my father has rested for thirty-nine years. I was greatly\r\naffected by the whole service, and by the music, which was excellent.\r\n\r\nAfter that I went to see the Countess Dohna, who came with me to the\r\ncastle. I wished to look at the outbuildings, which I had not seen\r\nyesterday. In the stables I found an old gilt carriage lined with red\r\nvelvet, and almost exactly resembling the carriage of the Spanish\r\nPrinces at Valençay. In that carriage my father left Courlande and\r\ncame here. The business man of my sister, the Princess of\r\nHohenzollern, sells everything which does not belong to the fief, and\r\nput up this carriage for sale. I bought it at once for a bid of\r\nthirty-five crowns.\r\n\r\nI dined at two o'clock, according to the custom of the town, and\r\nafterwards we went to the end of the park to visit a little ancient\r\nchurch where my sister de Sagan told me that she wished to place my\r\nfather's body and to be buried herself. The little church must be\r\nrestored, which will be quite easy. It might be made a very suitable\r\nand retired burial-place.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, June 22, 1840._--I have now returned to my own\r\nfireside, of which I am quite fond. Before leaving Sagan this morning\r\nI received calls from many of the local people, and went through a\r\nlong business conference. The whole Sagan question is so complicated\r\nthat it will last a long time. Wolff, Wurmb, and my eldest sister's\r\nold business man advised me to simplify the matter by asking my\r\nsister, who still owes me some money for Nachod,[105] to surrender the\r\nallodial forests of Sagan, which will thus come back to my sons some\r\nday. I do not object, for these forests are superb, but this is a\r\nfurther question. There are some preliminary points which should be\r\nsettled first and will take time. The business men urge me strongly to\r\nspend the whole year in Germany. I cannot spend the winter in so cold\r\na climate, but I should like to come back next spring for the fine\r\nweather. I believe my son is right in saying that he is very fortunate\r\nin making his first appearance in this country with myself.\r\n\r\n  [105] Nachod, an estate in Bohemia with a vast castle built by\r\n  the Piccolomini, had been bought by the Duc de Courlande. His\r\n  eldest daughter, Wilhelmine de Sagan, had inherited it, and died\r\n  there in 1839. Nachod was then sold to the Princes of\r\n  Schaumburg-Lippe, who still retain it.\r\n\r\nOn my way back I stayed for two hours at Neusalz, which is a curious\r\ntown to visit. Half of it is occupied by a colony of Moravian\r\nbrothers, whose customs nearly resemble those of the Quakers. They are\r\nsomewhat unusual, especially the custom which they call the Feast of\r\nLove. In their church they sing and pray and take coffee and cakes in\r\nthe most perfect silence and with the most perfect gluttony. They are\r\nvery industrious, very avaricious, somewhat hypocritical, and\r\namazingly clean. They address one another in the second person\r\nsingular. They have missionaries, and their branches spread throughout\r\nthe world. Besides the Moravian church, Neusalz has a Catholic and a\r\nProtestant church. The latter is quite new, and very pretty. I visited\r\nit to see a present given by the reigning King of Prussia; this is a\r\nvery handsome Christ after Annibale Carrache. I also examined in full\r\ndetail the splendid ironworks, where many castings are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, June 23, 1840._--It is beautiful weather. This evening\r\nmy garden is green, fresh, and sweet-smelling. There are times and\r\nseasons of climate, nature, and mind which are especially prone to\r\nraise regrets in the heart, and notwithstanding the actual comfort\r\nwith which I am surrounded I feel somewhat depressed to-day. I have\r\nbeen going through papers the whole morning with my business man, and\r\nafterwards went with him to inspect the Protestant school in this\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, June 25, 1840._--I spent yesterday from ten in the\r\nmorning till nine in the evening in visiting the most distant part of\r\nmy estates, which include a town, three farms, and a little forest. In\r\none of the farms the remains of an old Gothic castle have been\r\ntransformed into a barn. I lunched with a retired lieutenant who is\r\nmarried and works my farms, upon one of which is a good\r\ndwelling-house; the farms have always been held together, first by the\r\ngrandfather and then by the father of the present holder. His wife is\r\nexpecting a child, and they hope that the lease will be renewed to the\r\nfourth generation. I went to look at the church and the town, which is\r\nthree parts Catholic. I was very warmly received. The position of a\r\ngreat overlord is very different here from in France, and my son's\r\nhead is quite turned by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Günthersdorf, June 26, 1840._--To-morrow I must return to Berlin,\r\nwhile my son will go on to Marienbad. I have recovered my strength in\r\nthe open-air life that I have led among the woods. Yesterday I went to\r\nsee the worst of my farms, which is called Heydan, and is wrested by\r\nmain force from the sand.\r\n\r\nI had my neighbour to dinner, Prince Carolath of Saabor, a stout man\r\nbetween fifty and sixty years of age, very pleasant and polite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frankfort-on-the-Oder, June 28, 1840._--I spent the whole of\r\nyesterday out of doors in rain and hail. I could have wished for\r\nbetter weather for the sake of the good people who had prepared\r\nreceptions for me, and also for my own sake, as I could form but a\r\nvery inadequate judgment of the two recently made farms; one is called\r\nPeterhof, after my father, and the other Dorotheenaue, after myself.\r\nThese farms have been established upon lands by the help of which the\r\npeasants of Kleinitz have been enabled to buy their freedom from\r\nforced labour. Beautiful forests surround these lands. The agent in\r\nresidence belongs to a family of Courlande, which followed my father\r\nto Silesia. A striking portrait of my father, who had made a present\r\nof it to his follower, adorns his room. He values it highly, and so I\r\ncould not ask him to sell it to me, as I was tempted to do.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived here I found a very kind letter from the Duc d'Orléans,\r\nreferring most properly to the death of the King of Prussia and to his\r\nsuccessor. This is what he says about France: \"The apparent agitation\r\nhas subsided, but there are still clouds upon the horizon; though the\r\nstorm has been cleverly averted, it has not entirely dispersed.\r\nHowever, the interval between the sessions will pass off well. Only\r\nthe King and M. Thiers are in the foreground, and neither is willing\r\nto embarrass the other. Both wish to smooth their path, and no\r\nquestion will arise to divide them. For my part, I wish every success\r\nto our great little Minister, who can confer vast benefits upon this\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nI was sorry to say good-bye to my son; he is a good child, natural,\r\ntractable, and quiet. I am glad that he was pleased with Silesia, and\r\nthat he has shown so good a spirit in every respect. Moreover, in him\r\nI had a relative at hand, and I begin to feel the great difference\r\nbetween solitude and isolation. For a long time I confused these two\r\nconditions, which are so similar and yet so different; the one I can\r\nbear very well, the other makes me afraid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, June 29, 1840._--I arrived here yesterday at three o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon. I found many letters, but none of any interest.\r\nHowever, Madame Mollien says that the Duchesse d'Orléans is with\r\nchild, and adds that the digestive disturbance has returned from which\r\nthe measles seemed to have relieved her. Madame Adélaïde, who also\r\nwrites, seems to be well pleased with the way in which the review of\r\nthe National Guard passed off, and especially with the reception of\r\nthe Duc d'Orléans upon his return from Africa. Some of the officers\r\nattached to him are dead, and many of them have been left behind\r\nwounded or ill; he himself has grown very thin.\r\n\r\nHere at Berlin, according to what I hear from different people whom I\r\nsaw yesterday evening, the moderation, the goodness, and the wisdom of\r\nthe new King give great satisfaction. He works hard, is accessible to\r\neverybody, and shows every respect for the friends and the wishes of\r\nhis father. Herr von Humboldt has brought me all kinds of gracious\r\nmessages from Sans Souci; the Prince and Princess of Prussia have sent\r\nothers; Madame de Perponcher told me that there would be a grand Court\r\nof Condolence on Friday next, and explained what costume would be\r\nworn.\r\n\r\nThe only change under the new Government is that the King works with\r\neach of his Ministers separately, whereas the late King would only\r\ntalk with the Prince of Wittgenstein and work only with Count Lottum.\r\nHerr von Altenstein, who was Minister of Worship and Education, died\r\nthree weeks before the late King, and no fresh appointment has yet\r\nbeen made. There is much anxiety to know who will fill this important\r\npost. The choice will give some indication of the direction in which\r\naffairs will be guided. The nomination for that very reason is a\r\nmatter of great perplexity to the King.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, July 1, 1840._--My great objection to towns is the calls that\r\nhave to be made and received. In spite of the fact that I am only a\r\nbird of passage here I have to suffer this inconvenience. I have made\r\na large number of calls and received a great many yesterday morning\r\nand evening. The Prince of Prussia, who started this morning for Ems,\r\nwas with me for a long time, and told me that the Empress of Russia\r\nwas well pleased with her future daughter-in-law, and the young\r\nPrincess will travel to Russia with the Empress herself.\r\n\r\nLord William Russell also came to see me. He told me that Lady\r\nGranville had _ordered_ Mr. Heneage, who is attached to her husband's\r\nEmbassy at Paris, to accompany Madame de Lieven to England.\r\n\r\nI went with Wolff to see the studio of Begas, a German painter trained\r\nat Paris under the eyes of Gros. He is very talented.\r\n\r\nThere has been an earthquake in the department of Indre-et-Loire,\r\nwhich was felt at Tours; at Candes, four leagues from Rochecotte,\r\nseveral houses have been overthrown. At Rochecotte nothing has\r\nhappened, thank heaven, but this subterranean convulsion frightens me;\r\nanother event of the kind might easily ruin all my work of\r\nrestoration, and my artesian well might run dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potsdam, July 2, 1840._--I left Berlin yesterday at eleven o'clock in\r\nthe morning by the railway. I was in the same carriage with Prince\r\nAdalbert of Prussia, the King's cousin, Lord William Russell, and\r\nPrince George of Hesse. When I got out of the train, which reaches\r\nPotsdam in less than an hour, I found the carriage and the servants of\r\nthe Princess of Prussia, with an invitation to visit her at once at\r\nBabelsberg, a pretty Gothic castle which she has built upon a wooded\r\nheight overlooking the valley of the Havel. It is a small residence,\r\nbut very well arranged, with a beautiful view. We sat there talking\r\nfor an hour. Her carriage remained at my disposal in Potsdam after it\r\nhad brought me back. When I had dressed I went to Sans Souci, where\r\nthe King dines at three o'clock. Both he and the Queen were most kind\r\nand friendly. After dinner he took me to see the room where Frederick\r\nII. died, and that King's library. He insisted that I should follow\r\nhim to the terrace, which is a fine piece of work. Then I was handed\r\nover to the Countess of Reede, the Queen's chief lady, and to\r\nHumboldt, who drove me to the Marble Palace, where are many beautiful\r\nobjects of art, and also to the New Palace, where the great summer\r\nfestivities are held. The Princess of Prussia came to meet us, and\r\ntook me to Charlottenhof, which was made by the reigning King from the\r\nmodels, plans, and design of a villa belonging to Pliny. It is a\r\ncharming sight, full of beautiful things brought from Italy, which\r\nharmonise admirably, an inconceivable confusion of flowers and fresco\r\npaintings as at Pompeii, with fountains and ancient baths, all in the\r\nbest taste. The King and Queen were there, and we had tea. The King\r\nthen took me with him in a pony chaise and drove me through splendid\r\navenues of old oak-trees to Sans Souci, where he insisted that I\r\nshould stay to supper. Supper was served in a little room without\r\nceremony, and there was more conversation than eating. This went on\r\nvery pleasantly and easily until eleven o'clock. The King promised me\r\nhis portrait, and has been most kind in every way. He made me promise\r\nto come and see him again at Berlin, and was, as they say here, very\r\n_herzlich_.\r\n\r\nThis morning Humboldt came of his own accord to suggest that before\r\ngoing to lunch with the Princess of Prussia I should see the Island of\r\nthe Peacocks, with its beautiful conservatories and curious menagerie.\r\nThe King's boatmen and the overseers of the botanical gardens waited\r\non me, and I brought back some splendid flowers. We reached the\r\nPrincess of Prussia a little late. After lunch she took me in the pony\r\nchaise to see Glinicke, the pretty villa of Prince Charles, who is at\r\nthis moment at the baths of Kreuznach with his wife. Thence I returned\r\nto Potsdam and to Berlin by the railway.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, July 3, 1840._--Madame de Perponcher came for me to-day at\r\nfour o'clock. She took me through the rooms of her mother, the\r\nCountess of Reede, so that we avoided the crowd and were the first to\r\nreach the Court of Condolence which was held by the Queen at Berlin.\r\nShe was seated on her throne in a room hung with black; the shutters\r\nwere closed, and the room was lighted only by four large candles,\r\naccording to old etiquette. The Queen wore a double veil, one\r\nstreaming behind and the other lowered before her face; all the ladies\r\nwere dressed in the same way, and it was impossible to distinguish\r\nfaces. Each made a silent bow before the throne, and that was all. It\r\nwas strangely sad and lugubrious, but a very noble and imposing\r\nceremony. The men who passed before the throne were in uniform, with\r\ntheir faces uncovered, but any gold or silver on their uniforms was\r\ncovered with black crape.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berlin, July 5, 1840._--My stay at Berlin has now come to an end. I\r\nwent to high mass this morning, a less meritorious act here than\r\nelsewhere, on account of the admirable music.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Herzberg, July 6, 1840._--I started this morning from Berlin by\r\nrailway as far as Potsdam, where I stayed for lunch. When I got out of\r\nthe train I found a footman with a very affectionate farewell letter\r\nfrom the Princess of Prussia. I have been spoilt to the last moment. I\r\nfeel most deeply grateful, for every one has shown me a kindness and a\r\ncordiality which I had only experienced in England before now.\r\n\r\nI have finished the _Stories of the Merovingian Age_, by M. Augustin\r\nThierry. The book is not without interest or originality; as a picture\r\nof strange and unknown customs, it is valuable. I have begun the\r\nDialogues of Fénelon on Jansenism, a book which is little known and\r\nalmost forgotten, though admirably written, and sometimes as striking\r\nas the _Provincial Letters_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Königsbruck, July 8, 1840._--I came here yesterday at six o'clock in\r\nthe evening to see my niece, the Countess of Hohenthal. The lady of\r\nthe place is taller, fairer, more intelligent, quite as pleasant, and\r\nin my opinion prettier and kinder than her sister, Frau von Lazareff.\r\nHer other sister, Fanny, is an excellent and cheerful character, and\r\nif her health were better she would be pretty. The Count of Hohenthal\r\nis a thorough gentleman who admires and adores his wife. Miss\r\nHarrison, once the governess of these ladies, is a prudent and loyal\r\nperson who has acted as their mother, and is respected as such in the\r\nhousehold. Königsbruck is a great house, rather vast than beautiful,\r\nat the entrance to a small town. Its position would be picturesque and\r\nthe view agreeable if it were not almost choked by the outbuildings,\r\nwhich, in the German style, are placed far too near the castle. The\r\ncountry is a transition-point between the barrenness and flatness of\r\nPrussia and the rich productivity of Saxony.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from a letter from M. Royer-Collard,\r\nwritten from Paris when he was about to start for the Blésois: \"Thiers\r\ncame even to-day to sit down here in silence with M. Cousin, who\r\nrepresented the companion brother of the Jesuit. Thiers speaks very\r\ndisdainfully of the Ministries which preceded his own, and modestly of\r\nhis successes as Minister of the Interior; in any case, he is very\r\nkind to me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Königsbruck, July 9, 1840._--To-day I went over the castle in detail.\r\nIt might afford opportunity for beautification in several directions;\r\nbut such is not the local taste, as the lords work their estates\r\nthemselves and prefer the useful to the agreeable.\r\n\r\nMy niece had told me that the King and Queen of Saxony had expressed a\r\nwish to see me; I therefore wrote yesterday to Pillnitz, where the\r\nCourt now is, to ask their Majesties for an interview. When the answer\r\narrives I shall arrange for my departure.\r\n\r\nMy nieces generally spend their winters at Dresden, and told me that\r\nthe French Minister, M. de Bussières, was in very bad odour there. He\r\nis regarded as an unpleasant character and in bad style. He has\r\nintroduced some disagreeable customs, and deeply wounded the Queen by\r\nvarious tactless remarks concerning her. There is a general wish for\r\nhis removal to some other diplomatic post.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dresden, July 11, 1840._--I left Königsbruck this morning, and was\r\nglad to see once more the pretty suburbs of Dresden. I am now about to\r\ndress and to start for Pillnitz.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dresden, July 12, 1840._--The castle of Pillnitz is neither very\r\nbeautiful nor curious. The gardens are only moderately good, but the\r\nsituation on the banks of the Elbe is charming; the country is\r\ndelightful and fertile. The whole royal family of Saxony were\r\nassembled there yesterday. The Queen, whom I had known long ago at\r\nBaden, before her marriage, is the tallest woman I know; she is very\r\nkind, well educated, and simply anxious to please. The King had dined\r\nseveral times with M. de Talleyrand at Paris; he is a frank and\r\nnatural person, especially when his shyness, which is obvious at\r\nfirst, has time to wear off. Princess John, the Queen's sister, and\r\nthe twin sister of the Queen of Prussia, is strikingly like the\r\nlatter, but she has been so worn out by constant child-bearing that\r\nshe hardly has the strength to move or to utter more than a few words.\r\nI had also known her at Baden, when she was very pretty and agreeable.\r\nHer husband, Prince John, is one of the most learned royal personages\r\nof his time, always busy with deep matters; his dress and appearance\r\nare very careless, and there is something of the German professor\r\nabout him. Princess Augusta, the Queen's cousin, had nearly all the\r\nsovereigns of Europe as her suitors thirty years ago: Napoleon\r\nmentioned her name in the council where his marriage was decided; none\r\nthe less she remained single, and, moreover, has become a very\r\npleasant old maid. She was never pretty, but was fresh and bright,\r\nwith individual points of beauty. Her expression remains kind and\r\nattractive. Finally, I made a conquest of Princess Amelia, the King's\r\nsister, who writes comedies. She is a witty and imaginative person,\r\nand her conversation is lively and sparkling; she showed remarkable\r\nkindness to me.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I was taken into a very fine room to change my dress, and\r\nwas strongly tempted to theft by the many fine examples of old Dresden\r\nchina. The Queen sent for me, and I was taken to her room, where she\r\nasked me questions, as the Princesses had done. Everybody came in soon\r\nin out-of-door dress, and we started in carriages for a long drive.\r\nThe vine is largely grown about Dresden. Above the royal vineyards the\r\nKing has built a little summer-house, which reminds me of that of the\r\nGrand Duchess Stephanie at Baden. This was the object of our drive,\r\nand the view from it is superb: on the right was Dresden, opposite the\r\nElbe, with its smiling banks, and on the left the mountain chain known\r\nas Saxon Switzerland. Tea was served in the summer-house and after a\r\npleasant conversation I said farewell, when all kinds of warm messages\r\nwere exchanged. My carriage had followed me, and brought me back to\r\nDresden by ten o'clock in the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dresden, July 13, 1840._--As yesterday was Sunday I went to mass in\r\nthe morning in the chapel of the castle, where the music is famous\r\nthroughout Germany. It is the only place where singers are still to be\r\nheard in the style of Crescentini and Marchesi. This celebrated music\r\ndid not satisfy me; it was too operatic in style, too noisy and\r\ndramatic, instead of suggesting a religious calm; moreover, these\r\nmutilated voices, notwithstanding their brilliancy, have a certain\r\nunpleasant harshness and shrillness. I never cared for the voice of\r\nCrescentini, whom I heard at her best at Napoleon's Court.\r\n\r\nAfter mass we visited the interior of the castle, where Bendemann, one\r\nof the most distinguished artists of Düsseldorf, is now painting\r\nfrescoes in the great hall where the King opens and closes the\r\nsessions of the States. It will be a fine piece of work in respect\r\nboth of its composition and execution, but it will never have the\r\nbrilliancy which only Italy can give to this style of painting, and\r\nwhich is so indispensable to it. I was much interested by the\r\napartments of the Elector Augustus the Strong, which were furnished in\r\nthe fashion of his age, and have never been used since, except by the\r\nEmperor Napoleon. They contain a great number of specimens of Buhl\r\nfurniture, lacquer-work, gilt copper, old china, and inlaid wood, but\r\nthese things are kept in bad condition and badly arranged, and do not\r\nmake a quarter of the effect they should produce. The castle from the\r\noutside looks like an old convent, but there are some curious\r\narchitectural details in its interior courts which remind me of the\r\ncastle of Blois, though they cannot vie with it. Nothing can give\r\ngrace, lightness, and elegance to architectural work like the\r\neverlasting white stone which belongs exclusively to the centre of\r\nFrance. Here the stone is very dark.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I had a visit from the Baron of Lindenau, Minister of\r\nEducation and Director of Museums. He played an important political\r\npart in the affairs of Saxony during the co-regency of the present\r\nKing. I had known him formerly at the house of my late aunt, the\r\nCountess of Recke. He is a distinguished man, and I was glad to see\r\nhim again.\r\n\r\nMy nephew took us this morning to see the Japanese Palace, which\r\ncontains the royal library, the manuscripts, the intaglios, medals,\r\nand engravings. I went through twenty vaulted chambers, which contain\r\nall known specimens of china, of every age and every country. There\r\nwere some very beautiful and very curious things among them. This\r\ncollection is especially rich in Chinese specimens. Then we went on to\r\nthe royal china manufactory, which has preserved the fine paste so\r\ngreatly admired in old Saxon china, which is now sold by curiosity\r\ndealers.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I went to the historical museum called the Zwinger, which\r\nis arranged after the style of the Tower of London. Herr von Lindenau\r\nhad sent word of my coming to the chief directors, who are most\r\nlearned men, and explained everything to us delightfully. The picture\r\ngallery and the treasury I had seen upon other occasions, and did not\r\nvisit them again.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Teplitz, July 14, 1840._--It is not a long journey from Dresden\r\nhere--only eight short hours, through charming country. The hills\r\nprevent rapid progress, but the variety and the attractiveness of the\r\nscenery compensate for the delay. Some of the scenery recalls the\r\nMurgthal, and other parts Wildbad. The Erzgebirge, at the foot of\r\nwhich Teplitz lies, makes a sufficient background, though it is not an\r\nimposing mountain range. The mountains are, moreover, well wooded, the\r\nvillage is very pretty, flowers are grown, and the roads are\r\nexcellent. Immediately after my arrival I had a visit from my niece,\r\nPrincess Biron, who married my eldest nephew. She took me in her\r\ncarriage to see the town, which is not far off, the pretty promenades,\r\nand the village of Schönau, which is close to the town and contains\r\nthe chief watering-places. It is all very nice, and prettily built;\r\nbut Teplitz may be as pretty as it likes--it cannot equal dear Baden.\r\nThe society of the place is also different, and seems to me to be very\r\nmoderate here. It is said that the death of the King of Prussia will\r\nmake a great difference, as he came every year.\r\n\r\nPrincess Biron is a pleasant person; though not pretty, she has a\r\nnoble bearing, and is deeply loved and respected in her husband's\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Teplitz, July 15, 1840._--I am starting for Carlsbad, where I shall\r\nsee my two sisters this evening, from whom I have been separated for\r\nsixteen years. This unduly long absence has changed my habits, and I\r\nhave lost touch with their interests; so I begin the day with some\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carlsbad, July 16, 1840._--Fifteen hours' travelling to-day, during\r\nwhich I did not stop for a moment. I had to cover twenty-six leagues,\r\ncontinually going uphill or down. After Teplitz the country is pretty\r\nas far as Dux, the castle of Count Wallenstein, where Casanova wrote\r\nhis memoirs; after that the country becomes extremely dull. It was ten\r\no'clock when I arrived. My sisters were sitting opposite one another\r\nplaying patience. Jeanne, the Duchess of Acerenza, welcomed me very\r\nnaturally; Pauline, the Princess of Hohenzollern, with some\r\nembarrassment, which immediately communicated itself to me. We only\r\ntalked of indifferent matters, and they gave me tea. I then went to a\r\nhouse opposite, where my sister Jeanne has hired a room for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carlsbad, July 17, 1840._--The Duc de Noailles writes from Paris\r\ntelling me that he dined with M. Thiers at the house of the Sardinian\r\nAmbassador,[106] and had a long talk with him. He found M. Thiers\r\nprofoundly interested in Africa, willing to spend vast sums there, to\r\nwage a great war and keep up an army of eighty thousand men, and to\r\nbuild the continuous lines which have been so largely discussed, to\r\nsurround the whole plain of the Mitija.[107] He attempts to prove that\r\nthese efforts will produce marvellous results in two or three years:\r\nthe real possession of Africa, a large colonising movement, and a\r\nsplendid port on the Mediterranean. The Duc de Noailles also tells me\r\nthat Madame de Lieven is at London, and is greatly pleased with her\r\nreception.\r\n\r\n  [106] The Marquis de Brignole-Sale.\r\n\r\n  [107] The vast plain of the Mitija is situated to the south of\r\n  Algiers, and extends between two mountainous zones of the Atlas\r\n  and the Sahel. It is famous for its fertility, for which reason\r\n  the Arabs call it \"the Mother of the Poor.\"\r\n\r\nAnother correspondent says: \"The King does not seem to come to terms\r\nwith his Ministry, although he is said to be on the best footing with\r\nthe several members of it. Having lost a game, the King has now to win\r\none, and is waiting his opportunity patiently. M. Guizot still seems\r\nto be the fashion in England.[108] He bets at the racecourse, and has\r\nwon two hundred louis. Surely M. Guizot on the turf is one of the\r\nstrangest anomalies of our age!\"\r\n\r\n  [108] M. Guizot was then Ambassador at London.\r\n\r\nYesterday my sisters took me to see the various springs and the shops,\r\nwhich are very pretty. I then dined with them at three o'clock, my\r\nbrother-in-law, Count Schulenburg, being present.[109] Then we went\r\nfor a drive along the valley, which greatly resembles the valley of\r\nWildbad. There I found some old acquaintances--the Prince and Princess\r\nReuss-Schleiz, the Count and Countess Solms, son of the old Ompteda by\r\nher first marriage, the Countess Karolyi, called Nandine, the old\r\nLöwenhielm, with his wife, whose first married name was Frau von\r\nDüben, Liebermann, and an old Princess Lichenstein. I returned home at\r\nten o'clock, rather wearied with this succession of faces.\r\n\r\n  [109] The third husband of the eldest sister of the Duchesse de\r\n  Talleyrand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carlsbad, July 18, 1840._--Yesterday I went to pay a call to the\r\nCountess of Björnstjerna, who lives in the same house as myself. She\r\nis starting for Hamburg this morning, where she will hear whether she\r\nis to meet her husband at Stockholm or London. Her eldest son is\r\nmarrying the only daughter of her sister, Countess Ugglas, who died\r\nsome years ago. It has been pleasant to meet some one to remind me of\r\nLondon, the best time of my life, even in the form of this little\r\nBjörnstjerna. I have also been to see an old man of eighty years who\r\nalways used to live with my aunt, the Countess of Recke, and whom I\r\nhad missed at Dresden, where I hoped to find him. He usually lives\r\nthere in a house the use of which was bequeathed to him by my aunt,\r\nand which reverts to myself after the death of this poor old man. We\r\nboth grew sad over the memories of my good aunt.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I went for a drive with my sisters along a pretty road\r\ncut out of the mountain-side, and visited a china factory, where there\r\nwere some pretty things. Pottery has been a comparatively widespread\r\nindustry in Bohemia for some time, but remains much behind the Saxon\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carlsbad, July 19, 1840._--Yesterday I spent very much as the former\r\nday, and as I shall probably spend every day of my stay here. I always\r\nwake up early, write till nine o'clock, get up and dress. At ten\r\no'clock I go to my sisters, and stay talking to them till midday. I\r\nthen pay some necessary calls, and return home to read. I go back to\r\nmy sisters at three o'clock for dinner, then take them for a drive in\r\na carriage that I have hired. At six o'clock they sit in front of\r\ntheir door to see the people go past. I stay with them for a time, and\r\nthen return to my room, and finally go back to them at eight o'clock\r\nfor tea.\r\n\r\nMy sister Hohenzollern has brought all the curious letters that had\r\nbelonged to my mother, and which my sister the Duchesse de Sagan had\r\nseized. She proposed to keep a third of them, and we therefore divided\r\nthem. My share contains the letters of the late King of Poland,[110]\r\nof the Emperor Alexander, of the brothers and sisters of Frederick the\r\nGreat, Goethe, the Emperor Napoleon to the Empress Joséphine, the\r\ngreat Condé, Louis XIV., and in particular a letter from Fénelon to\r\nhis grand-nephew whom he called Fanfan.[111] This letter is enclosed\r\nin a paper on which the Bishop of Alais, M. de Bausset, has written a\r\nsigned note testifying to the authenticity of this letter, so that\r\nthere are two autographs in one.\r\n\r\n  [110] Stanislas Augustus Poniatowski, last King of Poland.\r\n\r\n  [111] M. Léon de Beaumont, the son of Fénelon's sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carlsbad, July 20, 1840._--I went to mass yesterday in an enormous\r\ncrowd, for this country is essentially Catholic. The little chapels,\r\nthe great crucifixes, the _ex-votos_, scattered about the mountains,\r\nare all visited on Sundays by the people, who leave small candles and\r\nflowers there. I went to visit two of these little shrines, which\r\nincrease the beauty of the landscape, apart from their religious\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nI then went to see my sisters in the usual place. Countess Léon\r\nRazumowski and Princess Palfy were with them. I was introduced, but\r\ndid not find them very interesting. Countess Razumowski is the leader\r\nof the pleasure-seeking society here; they spend their days in tea and\r\nsupper parties in the style of the Russian ladies at Baden.\r\n\r\nM. de Tatitcheff is also here, and told us that a young Russian who\r\nhad come straight from Rome said that the Pope was in a desperate\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a Mrs. Austin, a clever English lady, brought letters\r\nof introduction to my sisters. She sees a good deal of M. Guizot at\r\nLondon, is always quoting his remarks, and boasts of her\r\nacquaintanceship with Lady Lansdowne.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carlsbad, July 22, 1840._--Yesterday I had a very touching letter\r\nfrom the Abbé Dupanloup. He has been for rest and retirement at the\r\nGrande Chartreuse, whence his letter is dated. He proposes to return\r\nto Paris at once to help in the consecration of the new\r\nArchbishop.[112] He speaks with much concern about the condition of\r\nthe French clergy, whose irritation he describes as very great.\r\n\r\n  [112] Mgr. Affre.\r\n\r\nI have also a letter from the Princesse de Lieven from London. She\r\nsays: \"The Ministry is very weak, but it is likely to continue in\r\nlife, though vitality will be feeble. The Queen has entirely recovered\r\nher popularity since the attempt to assassinate her.[113] She really\r\nbehaved with great courage and coolness, most creditable and unusual\r\nat her age. She is very fond of her husband, whom she treats as a\r\nsmall boy. He is not so clever as she, but is very calm and dignified.\r\nM. Guizot has an excellent position here, is universally respected,\r\nand perfectly happy. Herr von Brunnow cuts a poor figure. He and his\r\nwife are thought to be quite ridiculous and out of place. The little\r\nChreptowicz, daughter of Count Nesselrode, who is here, is very vexed\r\nand ashamed about it. Alava has lost his cheerfulness. Lady Jersey's\r\nhair is grey. Lord Grey looks very well, but is very peevish.\"\r\n\r\n  [113] On June 6, 1840, a young man named Oxford, afterwards\r\n  thought to be mentally weak, fired two pistol-shots at Queen\r\n  Victoria as she was driving through the streets of London,\r\n  accompanied by her husband, Prince Albert.\r\n\r\nIt is said here that Matusiewicz is dangerously ill of gout at\r\nStockholm, and that M. Potemkin has gone raving mad at Rome. This is\r\nlikely to cause some changes in the Russian diplomatic service, and\r\nperhaps will bring my cousin, Paul Medem, from Stuttgart.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carlsbad, July 27, 1840._--I propose to start the day after to-morrow\r\nfor Baden. A certain Herr von Hübner arrived yesterday. He is an\r\nAustrian[114] with a post in the office of Prince Metternich. He\r\nbrought me a pressing invitation from the Prince to go and see him at\r\nKönigswarth, which is only six hours by road from here. I sent a\r\nrefusal, but in terms of warm regret; it would not be kind to my\r\nsisters if I were to cut my stay short by a day or two after so long a\r\nseparation, and I also fear the foolish interpretations which our\r\nnewspapers might place upon my action. Frederic Lamb, Esterhazy,\r\nTatitcheff, Fiquelmont, Maltzan, and other diplomatists are gathered\r\nat Königswarth. This will attract attention, and I am not anxious that\r\nmy name, which has not yet been sufficiently forgotten, should be made\r\nthe subject of delightful journalistic comments.\r\n\r\n  [114] Herr von Hübner was Austrian Ambassador in France under the\r\n  Second Empire, before the Italian War.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carlsbad, July 30, 1840._--I am leaving Carlsbad at midday this\r\nmorning, and going with my sister Acerenza to Löbichau, in Saxony, an\r\nestate which belongs to her; my mother is buried there. She will then\r\nmeet my sister Hohenzollern at Ischl, for which she also starts\r\nto-day. We part upon the best terms, and I have promised to pay them a\r\nvisit at Vienna on my next journey to Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Löbichau, July 31, 1840._--I arrived here yesterday evening, after a\r\njourney through a picturesque and mountainous country, well wooded and\r\nwell watered. I have been travelling in the pretty duchy of\r\nSaxony-Altenburg, a fertile, smiling, and populous district, where I\r\nspent every summer until the time of my marriage. I revisited it\r\nafterwards upon several occasions. Many recollections give me an\r\ninterest in the country, and sometimes arouse emotion. Some old faces\r\nof past times still remain to greet me. I went into the room where my\r\nmother died, and which my sister now uses, and we went to see her\r\ngrave at the end of the park. I also went to the presbytery to see the\r\nwife of the pastor, who was a faithful companion of my youth; one of\r\nher daughters is my godchild, and is a pretty young person.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Löbichau, August 1, 1840._--It rained all yesterday, and it was\r\nimpossible to go out. I spent my time in going over the house and\r\nlooking at the rooms which I had occupied at different periods. Some\r\npeople from the neighbourhood came in to see us, including the\r\ndeaconess, Fräulein Sidonie von Dieskau, a great friend of my mother.\r\nI often used to go to her house in my youth. She is a very lively and\r\nclever person, and bears her sixty-two years admirably.\r\n\r\nHere I found a letter from the Duchesse d'Albuféra, who says: \"Lady\r\nSandwich gave an evening party recently. You would never guess who was\r\nengaged to amuse the company--a hypnotist! The Marquise de Caraman was\r\noverheard saying to the young Duc de Vicence, 'If we were alone I\r\nshould like to be hypnotised, but I dare not before all these people;\r\nI should be afraid of showing my excitement.' Marshal Valée will be\r\ncontinued in his African command, notwithstanding the criticism to\r\nwhich he is exposed, on account of the difficulty of finding any one\r\nto take his place. The Flahaut have returned in a very softened frame\r\nof mind, and well disposed to the Government; they often go to\r\nAuteuil, where M. Thiers has set up house. The marriage of Lady Acton\r\nwith Lord Leveson is settled for this month; it will take place in\r\nEngland, where the Granvilles have been called by the serious illness\r\nof their daughter, Lady Rivers. Lord Granville does not greatly\r\napprove of this marriage; much pressure has been necessary to obtain\r\nhis consent, but his son's passion has overcome all obstacles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Löbichau, August 2, 1840._--Yesterday I went with my sister a\r\ndistance of a short half-league to visit a summer residence in the\r\nmiddle of the park, in which I spent several summers. My mother made\r\nme a present of it, and I gave it back to her when I was married. It\r\nis now in somewhat poor repair, but I was glad to see it again. On our\r\nreturn I went into the village to recall some memories.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Schleitz, August 3, 1840._--This town is the residence of the Prince\r\nof Reuss LXIV. Three years ago it was burnt down. The castle is quite\r\nnew, built in the style of a barracks, with two very insignificant\r\ntowers; it is a pity, for the country is beautiful, especially towards\r\nGera, where I dined with the deaconess von Dieskau, of whom I spoke\r\nabove, and who is one of the pleasantest recollections of my youth.\r\nShe is very comfortably settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nuremberg, August 4, 1840._--Yesterday evening I reached Bayreuth at\r\na late hour, and started again early this morning.\r\n\r\nA mere walk through the streets of Nüremberg will show any observer\r\nthe peculiarities of the town. Octagonal balconies in the form of\r\nprojecting towers in the middle or at the corners of the houses, with\r\ngables, almost all overhanging the street, are most characteristic.\r\nThe number of niches with statues of saints would make one think that\r\nthe country was Catholic; yet the town is entirely Protestant; but the\r\nvandalism of the Reformation was as rabid here as elsewhere, and the\r\ngood taste of the inhabitants has preserved from a sense of artistic\r\nvalue what they no longer appreciate for religious reasons.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening at the last posting station before Bayreuth I met\r\nsome travellers whom I did not know but who seemed to be important\r\npeople. The husband came up to my carriage and asked me if I had heard\r\nthe news. I replied that I had not. He then told me that he belonged\r\nto Geneva, and that he was taking his invalid wife to Marienbad; that\r\non leaving Geneva he had seen one of his friends from Paris, who told\r\nhim of the news that a convention had been signed at London between\r\nAustria, Prussia, Russia, and England against the Pasha of Egypt, and\r\nthat the French King was furious in consequence; that M. Thiers had\r\nimmediately ordered the sudden mobilisation of two hundred thousand\r\nmen to march to the northern frontier, and of ten thousand\r\nsailors.[115] As I no longer see the newspapers, I am very doubtful\r\nwhat to think of such news, and do not know what to make of these\r\napparent contradictions.\r\n\r\n  [115] The complications of the Eastern question nearly plunged\r\n  France into war about this time. Syria had revolted, and the\r\n  English, who objected to the power of the Egyptian Viceroy,\r\n  Mehemet Ali, joined Prussia, Austria, and Russia, excluding\r\n  France, whom Lord Palmerston knew to be unduly favourable to\r\n  Egypt, and secretly signed the treaty at London on July 15, 1840,\r\n  restoring Syria to the Sultan.\r\n\r\nI was told that on September 1 a fifteen days' camp would take place\r\nhere; twenty thousand troops, the whole Bavarian Court, and other\r\nprinces will make it a brilliant affair.\r\n\r\nIn _Galignani_ I saw the news of the death of Lord Durham; I do not\r\nthink he will be greatly regretted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo return from my aberrations, the Church of St. Sebald is\r\nill-proportioned and the decorations are very tawdry, but it contains\r\none fine monument. This is a great silver reliquary covered with gold\r\nbands, placed in an openwork monument of cast iron, remarkable for its\r\ndelicacy and gracefulness; the ornamentation is extremely rich and the\r\ndesign admirable. The Town Hall, the large hall painted with frescoes\r\nby Albert Dürer, where several Imperial Diets have been held, is worth\r\nseeing, and also the room in which are hung the portraits of those\r\ncitizens of Nuremberg who were benefactors to their native town by\r\nfounding religious houses. A chapel of St. Maurice which has been\r\ntransformed into a museum has some interesting pictures of the old\r\nGerman school. The bronze statue of Dürer in one of the squares, which\r\nwas modelled by Rauch of Berlin, and cast here, has nobility of\r\nbearing and makes a fine effect. The old castle, upon an elevation,\r\noverlooks the town, and from it may be gained a general view of the\r\ncountryside. Though it is somewhat mean in appearance, it has the\r\nmerit of indisputable antiquity. The King and Queen of Bavaria inhabit\r\nit when they are here. An old linden-tree planted in the middle of the\r\ncourt by the Empress Cunegonde must be eight hundred years old if the\r\nchronicle is to be believed; one may reasonably doubt such antiquity,\r\nthough the fact remains that this tree has seen many events.\r\n\r\nThe Church of St. Lawrence is very fine and imposing; the tabernacle\r\nand the pulpit are masterpieces. Two fountains, one of cast iron and\r\nthe other of stone, in two of the squares are very noteworthy for\r\ncurious details of sculpture, but the little threads of water which\r\nthey spout make them look more like _ex-votos_ than fountains. The\r\nhouse of the Emperor Adolphus of Nassau and the house of the\r\nHohenzollerns, who for a long time were Burgraves of Nuremberg, with\r\nseveral other houses in the hands of private individuals, are curious.\r\nThe mania for restoration has reached Nüremberg; the results would be\r\nhighly praiseworthy were it not for the habit of painting in glaring\r\ncolours houses with sculptured fronts which should especially be left\r\nin the natural colour of the stone. The cemetery of St. John contains\r\nthe tombs of all the illustrious men of the town. The Rosenau, the\r\npublic walk, of which the inhabitants are very proud, is damp and\r\nbadly kept. I finished my round with a visit to the toy shop which has\r\nbeen famous for centuries; all kinds of figures and grotesques are\r\nthere made, cleverly carved in wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baden, August 7, 1840._--I am now at Baden, and felt quite overcome\r\nwhen I just now entered it alone. The sight of the Jagd-Haus, of the\r\nlittle chapel, the poplar-trees upon the road--in fact, something at\r\nevery step awoke memories and regrets. I am staying in a clean little\r\nhouse on the Graben, opposite the Strasburg Hotel. Houses are being\r\nbuilt in every direction; Baden will soon be a large town, and much\r\nless attractive to me. As I read the letters which you write me from\r\nAmerica[116] I often think they would have greatly interested M. de\r\nTalleyrand, and would have reminded him of many things, but if poor M.\r\nde Talleyrand had lived I do not think he would have allowed you to go\r\ninto exile so far away; although he often said that a politician to\r\ncomplete his education should certainly go to America, as a distant\r\npoint of view from which to judge old Europe.\r\n\r\n  [116] Extract from a letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baden, August 8, 1840._--Herr von Blittersdorf whom I saw with his\r\nwife, told me of another wild attempt of Louis Bonaparte, who had\r\ndisembarked at Boulogne-sur-Mer and had attempted to arouse a\r\nrevolt.[117] The news was telegraphed, so that there were no details.\r\n\r\n  [117] On August 6, 1840, Prince Louis Bonaparte took advantage of\r\n  the excitement caused by the approach of the date when Napoleon's\r\n  remains were to be brought back to Paris, and made an attempt at\r\n  Boulogne-sur-Mer to restore Napoleon's dynasty to the throne of\r\n  France. On this occasion the Prince was arrested and tried before\r\n  the Chamber of Peers. He was defended by Berryer, and was\r\n  condemned to perpetual confinement in the castle of Ham in 1846.\r\n  He succeeding in escaping, and went first to Belgium, and thence\r\n  to England.\r\n\r\nThe King of Würtemberg is here; he has just left the watering-place of\r\nAix in Savoy. His daughter and son-in-law, the Count of Neipperg, are\r\nwith him; they go out a great deal, give parties, and so on. Herr von\r\nBlittersdorf also told me that the news from Paris was of a very\r\nwarlike character; for his part he did not understand either how war\r\nwas possible, seeing that every party had important reasons for\r\navoiding it, or again how it could be prevented in view of Lord\r\nPalmerston's measures, which have been ratified by the northern\r\nPowers,[118] while public opinion in France was unanimous and excited;\r\nand the Pasha of Egypt again had gained a success, whereas disasters\r\nalone could have stopped the coercive measures for which the\r\nconvention stipulated. On this question the French King is said to be\r\nin full agreement with M. Thiers, and to have stated that he would\r\nprefer war to revolution. M. Guizot has been reproached because he did\r\nnot give warning in sufficient time to stop the signing of the\r\nconvention. He defends himself by saying that he did give notice, but\r\nwas left without instructions. Such is the statement of Herr von\r\nBlittersdorf. He is very anxious about the situation, and especially\r\nabout the frontier position of the Grand Duchy of Baden, which would\r\nbe inconvenient in times of war. He says that the position of the\r\nduchy is the more difficult on account of the want of a fortress, the\r\nbuilding of which he has urged for the last twenty-eight years upon\r\nAustria, though he has not been able to attain it. I came back very\r\nanxious in view of the possibility of war.\r\n\r\n  [118] Lord Palmerston secured the signing of a convention by\r\n  which the four Powers undertook to give the Porte any necessary\r\n  support to reduce the Pasha and protect Constantinople as far as\r\n  needful against his attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baden, August 9, 1840._--To-day I fell back into my usual habits when\r\ntaking the waters. I found some of the faces of former years. My son,\r\nM. de Valençay, arrived from Marienbad. During the day I had a call\r\nfrom Count Woronzoff Dashkoff, who has come from Ems. The waters seem\r\nto have greatly benefited the Empress of Russia; he says that the Duke\r\nof Nassau treated the Grand Duchess Olga very coldly, and that\r\nPrincess Marie of Hesse was quite a success among the Russian\r\ngrandees. Count Woronzoff says that she has bad teeth and does not\r\nthink much of her beauty.\r\n\r\nI then saw Herr von Blittersdorf, who says that the King of\r\nWürtemberg, Princess Marie, his daughter, and even the Count of\r\nNeipperg, regret the marriage, which places them in a false position.\r\nThe Princess is said to be in bad health, and by no means rich. All\r\nthese stories seem foolish, the more so as the Count of Neipperg is\r\nquite an insignificant person.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Rohan has also arrived; he told me of the death of Madame\r\nde La Rovère (Elizabeth of Stackelberg), a young and handsome lady,\r\nhappy and beloved, and a friend of my daughter Pauline. Poor Frau von\r\nStackelberg! She has thus lost three children of full age and very\r\ndear to her in less than six months. These are heavy blows; she is a\r\nreal angel, and has been a sufferer all her life.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baden, August 10, 1840._--I have a letter from the Duchesse\r\nd'Albuféra, who is very anxious about her son-in-law, M. de La\r\nRedorte, the Spanish Ambassador. He reached Barcelona at a very gloomy\r\ntime. She says that he has done extremely well, and that the\r\nauthorities at Paris are very pleased with his attitude from the\r\noutset.\r\n\r\nAll my letters talk of war in a tone which reduces me to despair.\r\nMadame de Lieven was the first to send the news to Paris of the famous\r\nconvention of the four Powers, which she announced with a cry of\r\ntriumph in a letter to Madame de Flahaut. This Russian Princess showed\r\nherself most delighted and overjoyed at having some excitement worthy\r\nof her, but how will she settle that with M. Guizot? It seems that\r\nthese rumours of war reduce Madame de Flahaut to despair, as she has\r\nrecovered her affection for the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Noailles is, I hear, very proud because he has predicted\r\nthe disturbance now in progress. I cannot sufficiently remember any of\r\nhis speeches to recall his prophecies. In any case, it is a poor\r\nconsolation for the evils which threaten European society.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baden, August 12, 1840._--I dined with the Wellesleys; Princess Marie\r\nand the Count of Neipperg were there. After seeing the latter I am\r\nthe less able to understand the marriage. The King of Würtemberg is\r\nsaid to be displeased with his son-in-law, who adopts a contemptuous\r\nattitude; the Count is susceptible and hard to please, and the poor\r\nPrincess is torn between her husband and her father, as also is\r\nsociety between the husband and the wife; in short, the position is\r\nfalse and foolish for everybody. The Princess is the chief sufferer,\r\nand, though not pretty, she is a pleasant person; there is something\r\nwrong about her figure--her movements are neither free nor easy.\r\n\r\nThis morning I went to a concert given by the Countess Strogonoff.\r\nPrincess Marie and the Grand Duke of Baden were also there. High\r\nsociety in general was well represented. I saw nothing of any\r\nparticular note, and fortunately made no new acquaintances.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baden, August 14, 1840._--Yesterday I read the manifesto of the new\r\nArchbishop of Paris, Mgr. Affre, on the occasion of his enthronement.\r\nTwo points in it seemed to me to show great affectation: he attempted\r\nto reassure the Government about the moderation of his political\r\nviews, and he refused to say a single word about his predecessor,\r\nwhich is against all custom and good taste. If he would not speak of\r\nhis predecessor's administration of office or of his personality, he\r\nmight at least have praised his charity, which is incontestable; he\r\nwould not have compromised himself, and would have avoided the\r\nfoolishness of silence.\r\n\r\nHerr von Blittersdorf told me at his wife's house that he was startled\r\nby the exasperation which was produced in France by the absolute\r\nsilence of the Queen of England with reference to France in her Speech\r\nupon the prorogation of Parliament. He told me also that England had\r\nresolved to break with France on the Eastern question, because she had\r\nrecently acquired accurate information concerning the intrigues of M.\r\nde Pontois, to prevent any reconciliation of the Sultan with the\r\nPasha.[119] England was also aware of the assurances given to the\r\nlatter, that he need not take the severity of the Powers seriously,\r\nand might continue his enterprise, trusting to the help of France.\r\nLord Palmerston complains of this duplicity. On the other hand it is\r\nasserted that the prospects of peace between the Porte and Egypt are\r\nhampered by Lord Ponsonby; in short, it is a hopeless tangle. Let us\r\ntrust that it will not be settled by cannon-shots.\r\n\r\n  [119] In 1840 the Sultan was Abdul Mejed, who ascended the throne\r\n  the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from a letter from M. Bresson from Berlin\r\nwhich I have just received: \"I have been suddenly overwhelmed with\r\nwork, and not of the pleasantest kind. The evil is great, and will not\r\nbe entirely repaired. How often have I thought that if M. de\r\nTalleyrand were alive and at London this would not have happened! I\r\nwish also he could be at Berlin and everywhere, for I am not very\r\nsuccessful in making people listen to reason. Yet this is the most\r\nunworthy transaction of modern times, though quite worthy to bear the\r\nnames of Lord Palmerston, von Bülow, and Neumann. Herr von Bülow acted\r\nwithout authorisation. At first there was an outcry against him, then\r\nthere was a wish to do as the majority were doing, and his fine\r\nmasterpiece was ratified with very few restrictions. The four Courts\r\nwill let me hear of it within six months. Mehemet Ali will send them\r\nabout their business and wait for them to blockade him, an enterprise\r\nif possible more ridiculous than that of La Plata,[120] and one which\r\nwill be far more expensive. I hope that he will not cross the Taurus\r\nto delude our friends of St. Petersburg. The chief politicians look\r\nfor a double moral effect upon France and upon Mehemet Ali, thanks to\r\nthe Syrian insurrection. You can see how careful their calculations\r\nhave been. Apart from this there is the insult of the clandestine\r\nnegotiations and the notification to M. Guizot of the fact that these\r\nhad been signed forty-eight hours after everything was over and when\r\nhe was thinking of something entirely different, so you may easily\r\njudge of our feelings. If the good old King of Prussia were still\r\nalive we should not have seen such stupidity. Herr von Bülow would\r\nhave had a wigging, or rather he would never have gained the upper\r\nhand. He thought he had flattered and won men over and could rely upon\r\nthe passions aroused by the inheritance of a Prince whom Prussia will\r\ndaily regret more and more. In short, I am in a very bad temper, and I\r\ntake no trouble to hide it. We now know exactly what there is behind\r\nwords and protestations. I trust that the people will also learn what\r\nthe resentment of France can mean.\" In this outburst the natural\r\nimpetuosity of M. de Bresson is obvious, but I also seem to see that\r\nthe action of the Powers was inspired rather by tactlessness than by\r\nreal hostility, and from this fact one may derive some hopes of peace.\r\n\r\n  [120] Rosas secured his appointment in 1829 as Governor of Buenos\r\n  Ayres in 1835. This dictator had a serious quarrel with France\r\n  owing to his refusal to satisfy the claims of the French\r\n  residents. After a long blockade the quarrel was satisfactorily\r\n  terminated in 1840 by Admiral de Mackau.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baden, August 19, 1840._--Yesterday I received so pressing an\r\ninvitation from the Grand Duchess Stephanie to visit her at her estate\r\nof Umkirch, in Briesgau, where she now is, that I resolved to pay her\r\na visit after completing my cure here.\r\n\r\nI have seen my cousin, Paul Medem, who came from Stuttgart, where he\r\nhad just shown his letters of credit as Russian Minister. He does not\r\nbelieve in the possibility of the war, and as proof of his conviction\r\nhas just invested two hundred thousand francs in the French Funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baden, August 20, 1840._--I was very agreeably surprised to receive\r\nthe portrait of the King of Prussia, with a kind autograph letter. The\r\nportrait is an admirable and striking likeness, painted by Krüger.\r\n\r\nMadame de Nesselrode brought her son to see me, who has just come from\r\nLondon. He left Madame de Lieven absorbed by the European conflict, on\r\nbad terms with Brunnow, very cold towards Lady Palmerston, and furious\r\nbecause she had not been let into the secret of the signature of the\r\nfamous convention. She involuntarily helped to mystify M. Guizot by\r\nassuring him that there could be no truth in the idea or she would\r\nhave known it herself. She belongs to the French Embassy, is treated\r\nas such, and people go on laughing at her. She is at home until\r\nlunch-time; as soon as M. Guizot appears the door is closed, no one is\r\nadmitted, and any one with her takes his leave. Her position seems,\r\nin truth, to be ridiculous and impossible, and she is only supported\r\nby the Sutherlands, with whom she lives.\r\n\r\nI have a letter from Paris from the Duchesse d'Albuféra, who says:\r\n\"What can I tell you of the war? The Press is urging it forward by\r\nevery means; every day bellicose articles fill the newspapers and\r\nexcite people's minds. I am assured, however, that the King is quite\r\ncalm and has no fear of an outbreak, but can the progress of public\r\nopinion be checked? It is said that orders have been issued to\r\nmobilise the National Guard in France; we may expect to see every\r\nmeans of defence prepared. People are not calm enough to see that in\r\nthis way war may be aroused. Every fresh measure increases the general\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n\"In any case I am convinced that the Government itself does not know\r\nwhat the result will be. I trust that diplomacy may avoid any resort\r\nto cannon-shot. I have been to see the Duchesse d'Orléans at\r\nSaint-Cloud; she is very thin, but does not complain of her health;\r\nshe is often to be seen driving in the Bois, with the Duc d'Orléans\r\nriding by the carriage. Madame de Flahaut is at Dieppe, and her\r\nhusband at Paris; he often dines with the Prince Royal. His position\r\nis likely to become embarrassing during the trial of Louis Bonaparte.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Baden, August 22, 1840._--My son M. de Valençay, who has returned to\r\nParis, tells me he has seen the Duc d'Orléans, who says: \"Thiers and\r\nGuizot seem to distrust one another profoundly. Guizot supposes that\r\nThiers wished to throw the responsibility of the present crisis upon\r\nhim and allowed suspicions to arise that he had not kept his\r\nGovernment informed. He has therefore sent copies of his despatches to\r\nhis friends in Paris, who threaten to use them if the Ambassador is\r\nattacked. According to these friends, Guizot informed Thiers\r\naccurately of the course of events, but the latter declined to give\r\nhim instructions or to reply before consulting Mehemet Ali, but simply\r\nsent instructions to London to say neither yes nor no. Palmerston, on\r\nthe other hand, wished to drive Thiers into a corner. Thiers on his\r\nside said: 'Palmerston is playing diamond cut diamond, but I will balk\r\nhim,' an expression which seems to have become a diplomatic term. At\r\nlength Palmerston, worried and impatient, is said to have settled the\r\nbusiness. There is a strong feeling in favour of war; Guizot, however,\r\nstill believes in peace, but he writes that as a matter of fact a mere\r\nspark, a blow given to a sailor, would be enough to fire the most\r\nterrible war in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Umkirch, August 26, 1840._--Yesterday when I was half-way from Baden\r\non the road here a formidable storm burst, and we were obliged to take\r\nshelter in a barn; hailstones fell as big as nuts. Notwithstanding the\r\ndelay I arrived at six o'clock in the evening. The Grand Duchess had\r\nkindly sent her horses to meet me at Friburg. When I arrived Herr von\r\nSchreckenstein told me I should find her in bed, where she had been\r\nwith a chill since the evening before.\r\n\r\nThe new lady-in-waiting, Frau von Sturmfeder, a widow who seems to be\r\nabout fifty years old, with pleasant manners, took me to the Duchess.\r\nI found her very feverish, but no less talkative than usual; very\r\nexasperated by her invalid state, and nearly as much by the arrival of\r\nDuke Bernard of Saxe-Weimar, who was paying her an unexpected visit.\r\nAfter half an hour Princess Marie took me to dinner. The large\r\nassembly room and the dining-room are in a separate building, a\r\nhundred yards away from the castle; nothing could be more\r\ninconvenient; after rain and without goloshes it would be impossible\r\nto get there.\r\n\r\nI already knew Umkirch. I did not care for it in past times, nor does\r\nit please me any better now. The main residence is small and the rooms\r\nare low; mine, however, which is on the first floor, has a fine view\r\nof the mountains.\r\n\r\nAt dinner all the guests were assembled--that is to say, Princess\r\nMarie; Duke Bernard, with his _aide-de-camp_, old Madame de Walsh, who\r\nis here on a visit, though her days of official service are over; her\r\nson and daughter-in-law, the Baroness von Sturmfeder; Herr von\r\nSchreckenstein; Fräulein Bilz, a little hunchbacked music-mistress;\r\nand M. Mathieu, the French painter, who is giving lessons to Princess\r\nMarie. After dinner I went back to the invalid, and stayed with her\r\nuntil tea-time. She seems delighted to see me. She continues very\r\nanxious to see her daughter married, and has just had an offer from\r\nPrince Hohenlohe; he, however, was thought to be not sufficiently\r\ndistinguished, and his request has been refused; the old Count of\r\nDarmstadt would also be ready to marry her, but he is thought to be\r\ntoo old and too ugly. There is an idea that Prince Frederick of\r\nPrussia, the Prince of Düsseldorf, exhausted and wearied by the\r\nextravagance of his wife, will procure a divorce, and will then turn\r\nhis thoughts to Princess Marie, who would be quite ready to take him.\r\nSuch is the desire at this moment. They would like me to send a good\r\naccount of the Princess to Berlin.\r\n\r\nVery little interest is shown in Louis Bonaparte, whom they would like\r\nto see confined in a fortress.\r\n\r\nMadame de Walsh, who is a friend of the Abbé Bautain, told me that he\r\nhad just been summoned to Paris by M. Cousin and by the new\r\nArchbishop; there is apparently a proposal to form a faculty for\r\nadvanced theological study, with M. Bautain at the head of it. He is\r\ncertainly an intelligent and talented man, but not entirely reconciled\r\nto Rome. Hot-headed and ambitious, his relations with his bishop have\r\nlong been strained; he has not that readiness to submit upon points of\r\ndoctrine which is inherent in Catholicism and the foundation of its\r\npermanency. His appointment will therefore arouse some mistrust among\r\nthe clergy, and not without reason. I shall hear the truth of the\r\nwhole matter at Paris from the Abbé Dupanloup.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Saxe-Weimar, though heavy in appearance, is not without\r\ncommon sense and learning. To my great astonishment I found him a\r\nstrong supporter of the house of Orléans; he asserted his strong\r\naffection for the Duchesse d'Orléans, his niece, and entrusted me with\r\na letter for her. He is very anti-Russian and anti-English, and went\r\nso far as to say that if war should break out the King of the Low\r\nCountries ought to make common cause with France. He is at this moment\r\non the unattached list, and is provisionally established at Mannheim,\r\nwhence he is very anxious to make a journey to Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duchess and Princess Marie knew all about the presents and\r\nthe trousseau given by Russia to Princess Marie of Hesse. The Emperor\r\ngave her two rows of pearls with a sapphire clasp, supposed to be\r\nworth two hundred thousand francs; the Empress gave her a bracelet to\r\nmatch; and her _fiancé_, the Grand Duke, gave her his portrait framed\r\nin diamonds and a parasol adorned with emeralds and pearls, together\r\nwith maps of the Russian Empire and views of St. Petersburg nicely\r\nbound, and, lastly, the present left by the will of the late Empress\r\nMarie to her grandson's future wife, which is a Sévigné in three\r\npieces, each as large as a breastplate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lunéville, August 27, 1840._--I left Umkirch this morning, and spent\r\nfourteen hours in traversing a long road which is made longer by the\r\npass over the mountains. I crossed the Vosges by the Col du Bonhomme.\r\nMany factories and workshops give some life and animation to the\r\ncountry, which is sometimes bright and lively. Vegetation is poor and\r\nthe outlines of the hills too monotonous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vitry-sur-Marne, August 28, 1840._--I left Lunéville at seven o'clock\r\nthis morning, stopped at Nancy for two and a half hours, and arrived\r\nhere at ten in the evening, which may be called good going.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ay, August 30, 1840._--On my road here yesterday I stopped at\r\nChâlons, where I met M. de La Boulaye, who was there for the session\r\nof the General Council. I was very glad to see him; he is a pleasant\r\nman in mind as well as character, and I think even more of the one\r\nthan of the other every day of my life. He gave me the Paris news\r\nwhich he had heard from M. Roy, who had come straight from that\r\nBabylon to preside over the Council-General of Marne. The night before\r\nhe left Paris he had seen the King, who talked upon the questions of\r\nthe day, and said: \"Thiers is urging me to war, to which I reply:\r\n'Very well, but the Chambers must be convoked.' He then answers: 'We\r\nshall get nothing from this Chamber; it should be dissolved.' 'Oh, no,\r\nmy dear Minister; on that point I prefer to take the Chamber as I\r\nfind it and make the best of things.'\"\r\n\r\nM. Roy also said that the news of the ratification of the London\r\nTreaty reached Paris on the 22nd, and was not published till the 24th.\r\nDuring that time the terrible excitement on the Stock Exchange ruined\r\nmore than one broker, forced M. Barbet de Jouy to flee, enriched M.\r\nDosne, the father-in-law of M. Thiers, with seventeen hundred francs\r\nand M. Fould with several millions. The latter has taken M. de\r\nRothschild's place in the confidence of the Ministry. The public\r\noutcry was such that the Guardian of the Seals, M. Vivien, was obliged\r\nto give orders for the information to be published. This information\r\nwill produce no effect, as is natural, but it shows that the scandal\r\nhas gone very far. It seems that in consequence the chief personage in\r\nthe Ministry has lost much ground in public opinion; he is thought to\r\nhave guided the diplomacy of the country very casually, and to have\r\nconcealed interesting news from the public in a most unusual way. The\r\nwhole of the manufacturing and speculating world is said to tremble at\r\nthe thought of war, and to exert a very strong influence upon the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nI reached here at about three o'clock in the afternoon in African\r\nheat. I am glad to be back again in a warm climate, with its flowers,\r\nits fruits, its beautiful nights, and its blue sky.\r\n\r\nI have a letter from the Princesse de Lieven written from London on\r\nAugust 22. She says: \"General anxiety concerning the situation is\r\nbecoming apparent here. All goes well, or rather there is no anxiety\r\nupon questions of foreign policy, however serious the complications\r\nmay be. French newspapers, and even the French military preparations,\r\nare regarded with scorn, but at last the people are beginning to rub\r\ntheir eyes; they are astonished to find that what is known as French\r\nhumbug may mean something, and that this something may be neither more\r\nnor less than a general war, waged, as far as France is concerned,\r\nwith dreadful weapons--weapons which were wisely laid aside for ten\r\nyears, and which France will perhaps be forced to raise once more; in\r\nshort, uneasiness is spreading, and I cannot help seeing in the fact\r\nthe opening of the way to an understanding, in spite of the obstacles\r\nwhich the sense of self-esteem may meet with on the road. This is my\r\npoint of view. My politics are concerned with my set of rooms,[121]\r\nwhich I like and wish to keep. The Duke of Wellington loudly asserts\r\nthat he is Turkish, and more Turkish than anybody, but that Turkey\r\nwill not have peace with France, and that peace must be preserved\r\nbefore all things. Leopold is greatly interested; he proposes to\r\nreturn to Belgium. M. Guizot has been at Eu and Windsor; his present\r\nlife suits him, and he looks very well.\"\r\n\r\n  [121] The Princesse de Lieven had hired in the house recently\r\n  bought by M. de Rothschild in the Rue Saint-Florentin the\r\n  first-floor rooms, which the Prince de Talleyrand had occupied\r\n  for many years when he was in possession of this residence. The\r\n  Princesse thought that there she could recover the political\r\n  atmosphere which suited her taste. She stayed there until her\r\n  death in 1857.\r\n\r\nMy niece, the Countess of Hohenthal, who has been to Dresden to see\r\nher uncle Maltzan when he went there from Königswarth, sends me some\r\nnews concerning the stay of the Empress of Russia in Saxony: \"The\r\nEmpress of Russia has shown such coldness to the Saxon Court that the\r\nKing and Queen of Prussia, who have delighted everybody, have been\r\nreduced to despair. She would not stay at Pillnitz, where many\r\npreparations for her comfort had been made; she refused to use the\r\nCourt carriages, and went about the shops and streets like a\r\nboarding-school girl, without the least sense of decorum. She refused\r\nto dine at Court, and only looked in for a moment at a concert given\r\nin her honour. The King of Prussia was ready to give the portfolio of\r\nForeign Affairs to my uncle Maltzan, but he preferred to retain his\r\npost at Vienna. It is said that his refusal is due to the fact that he\r\nis wildly in love with Princess Metternich.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, August 31, 1840._--Once again I am in this great Paris,\r\ndoubtless populous, and yet so empty for me. This morning at ten\r\no'clock I reached my little house,[122] which seems to me like a\r\npleasant little inn, only I am astonished by its small size, which\r\nsuits my habits and my tastes so little that I could certainly have\r\nchosen nothing better in order to realise my intention of visiting\r\nParis only when absolutely obliged.\r\n\r\n  [122] The Duchesse de Talleyrand had bought a little house with a\r\n  court and garden at Paris in the Rue de Lille, No. 73, in the\r\n  year 1840. This house, which in size was a mere temporary abode,\r\n  was bought in 1862 by the Comtesse de Bagneux.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 3, 1840._--Yesterday I had a long visit from M.\r\nMolé, who blames M. Guizot, and relates his infinite blunders with\r\ngreat complacency; he blames M. Thiers, and draws a vivid picture of\r\nhis bumptiousness, his casual ways, and so on. Nor does the King\r\nescape his criticism as regards the present crisis, which entirely\r\noccupies all minds here. He says that the greatest swashbucklers are\r\ndying with fear of war; that really people are ashamed and vexed\r\nbecause they have been led astray and induced to regard as impossible\r\nwhat, however, has happened, while they are angry at finding\r\nthemselves isolated when lasting alliances have been dangled before\r\ntheir eyes. But amid the general panic certain points are so well\r\nadvertised by conversations and continual publications that it daily\r\nbecomes more difficult to solve the problem, and the only possibility\r\nis to cut the knot. Commercial interests have been suddenly paralysed,\r\nand business in general is suffering heavily. Rothschild, who has\r\nquarrelled with M. Thiers, has lost even more millions than M. Fould\r\nhas gained. M. Molé explains all this very cheerfully.\r\n\r\nI went to dinner with the wife of Marshal d'Albuféra. The poor woman\r\nwas in despair, for that morning she had seen her daughter start for\r\nSpain in the most deplorable state of health. She has kept one of her\r\ngrandchildren with her. She is really a most warm-hearted person. Her\r\naccount of the present political situation differs entirely from that\r\nof M. Molé; she is no less frightened by the serious nature of events,\r\nbut attributes them to other causes. She is never tired of praising\r\nthe capacity, the energy, and the cleverness of M. Thiers, his\r\ninexhaustible resource, and his complete harmony with the King. One\r\nfact she told me which would hardly please M. Bresson: that M. de La\r\nRedorte was given the choice of going to Berlin and preferred Madrid.\r\nShe says that M. de La Redorte has been very successful in Spain, and\r\nthat the King and Ministers are never weary of praising the\r\ndistinguished tone of his despatches.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock I went to see Madame de Castellane. There the\r\npanegyric upon the late M. de Quélen was discussed, which led the\r\nconversation to the new Archbishop, M. Affre. His nomination was\r\nbrought about by M. de Montalembert in the following way: M. de\r\nMontalembert has become a strong partisan of the Ministry, and M.\r\nThiers thinks that with his help he will be able to confine the ranks\r\nof the clergy to distinguished men. As a matter of fact, M. de\r\nMontalembert is only connected with the democratic section of the\r\nyoung clergy, who form a party by themselves, including the Abbés\r\nCœur, Combalot, Lacordaire, and Bautain, which is not regarded as\r\northodox in the sense that the old clergy are. This party also\r\ncontains some distinguished young priests like the Abbé Dupanloup, the\r\nAbbé Petetot, the Curé de Saint-Louis-d'Autin, and others; in fact,\r\nthere is quite a schism.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned home I found a letter from M. Bresson, of which the\r\nfollowing is an interesting passage: \"The position is very serious,\r\nand the Prussian King's first appearance in foreign policy is not\r\nhappy. There is no frankness or nobility in following all these fine\r\nprotestations with an act of provocation and injustice towards\r\nourselves, who have never been guilty of a single act of bad faith\r\ntowards Prussia. Such action calls for vengeance, and I am by no means\r\na sufficiently humble Christian not to thirst for it. I am well aware\r\nthat they are sorry at what has happened and are embarrassed by it,\r\nbut they have been carried away by that great windbag Bülow further\r\nthan they wished at a time when his voracious appetite has been\r\nfollowed by a fit of indigestion; but the harm has now been done, and\r\nit is irreparable. They have shown their real feelings, and what\r\nconfidence can we have for the future? In short, I am utterly\r\ndisgusted, and I should be glad to resign my post; I am also ill and\r\ndepressed, and have a longing for Rome. I wish to leave my mind fallow\r\nand to sit in real sunshine and get warm. I have spent twenty-four\r\nyears in exile working without intermission, and I can stand it no\r\nlonger. I am utterly bored, and do not want the good relations which\r\nI have been able to maintain here to break down during my tenure of\r\noffice, as they seem likely to do. One fault leads to a second, and\r\none wrongdoing begets another. Besides, I have been personally\r\naffronted; I have been loyal and they have not been. My resentment\r\nwill find vent, and whether upon the King or the Minister is all the\r\nsame to me. I will make them repent their want of gratitude and\r\ncourtesy towards our King, after calling him the Palladium of Europe,\r\nin speaking to me and M. de Ségur.\" In this vehement style the\r\nimpetuosity of M. Bresson will be obvious, but the truth is I think\r\nthings have gone so far as to make him wish for another post.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow the Paris Stock Exchange account is made up. The probable\r\nlosses are estimated at twenty-four to twenty-five millions--a very\r\ngreat disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 4, 1840._--Yesterday I went to the Tuileries to keep\r\nan appointment with Madame Adélaïde. I also saw the King there, who\r\nwas well and cheerful, in a very easy frame of mind, convinced that\r\nthere would be no war, and certainly not anxious for one. He flattered\r\nhimself that the four Powers would soon be persuaded that they were\r\nworking in the wrong direction and be forced to fall back upon his\r\nintervention, and that he would thus be called to play the part of\r\nmediator, &c. He is very greatly hurt that the Powers should have put\r\nhim in such a position, but is too sensible to listen to the\r\ninvectives and the uproar of the Ministerial Press. He has no greater\r\nleanings towards M. Thiers than he used to have, but he understands\r\nthat it is now impossible to break with him, and hopes to use him to\r\nextort certain concessions from the Powers, which he alone could\r\ninduce the country to accept. There is an element of truth and\r\ncleverness in these ideas, though also a certain amount of illusion.\r\nMadame's feelings are those of the King, though she is extremely\r\nbitter against M. Guizot, and accuses him of showing the most utter\r\ndiplomatic incompetence. She repeated more than twenty times: \"Oh, if\r\nonly our dear Prince de Talleyrand were alive, if only our good\r\nGeneral Sébastiani had remained at London, we should not be in this\r\nposition!\"\r\n\r\nI had hardly returned home when the Duc d'Orléans called upon me, and\r\nstayed for a long time. He is far more anxious, and at the same time\r\nfar more decided, than his father. His exasperation with the Powers is\r\nextreme, chiefly on account of the way in which events have come to\r\npass. On July 16 Guizot sent news that nothing had happened or would\r\nhappen; on the 17th he had a letter from Lord Palmerston asking him to\r\ncall, and when he reached the house Lord Palmerston simply read the\r\nfamous memorandum. Guizot became pale and agitated, and could find\r\nnothing to say except that he would inform his Government, and left\r\nLord Palmerston as though thunderstruck. Now he and his friends throw\r\nthe whole of the blame upon Thiers. Thiers replies vigorously that\r\nthey are in the wrong, and gives details, so that relations are\r\ngreatly strained. Thiers is horrified at the possibility of war, but\r\ninstead of calming the journalists of his party he is so entirely\r\ndominated by them that he not only cannot check them, but thinks\r\nhimself bound to tell them everything. The result is that secrecy is\r\nimpossible; the Diplomatic Body is affronted and action in general is\r\nhampered. Meanwhile all the preparations announced by the newspapers\r\nhave been made, and even doubled. The Duc d'Orléans is himself taking\r\nthe business in hand. Thirty-four million francs have already been\r\nexpended. All the forces in Algiers are being recalled, and the\r\nauthorities have made up their minds to abandon the colony without\r\nregret, telling themselves that they have had the advantage of\r\ntraining their soldiers and their officers. The Chambers will not be\r\nsummoned until all chances of peace have disappeared, when it is\r\nexpected that all these expenses will be certainly approved. The Queen\r\nis the most warlike of the whole royal family; the blood of Maria\r\nTheresa is aroused; she is furious with the action of the Powers, and\r\nsays that if war breaks out she will ask the Archbishop of Paris to\r\nbless the swords of her five sons and make them swear upon the Holy\r\nSacrament never to sheath them again until France and their dynasty\r\nare restored to the chief place in Europe. As she usually interferes\r\nin no way, this vigour has astonished and embarrassed the King.\r\n\r\nM. Guizot, to return to him, is an object of ridicule at the Château,\r\nespecially since the return of the Duc de Nemours from London, for he\r\ntells numberless stories at the expense of the little ambassador. He\r\nasks for the addresses of tailors, wishes his trousers to be\r\ntight-fitting, bets at the races, thinks he has a good eye for a\r\nhorse, devotes his attention to his carriages and his table, is\r\nutterly frivolous, and, to complete his ridiculous appearance, brags\r\nin front of Mrs. Stanley and tries to make Madame de Lieven jealous,\r\nand it is said with some success. This field of operations, in short,\r\nis being cleverly worked.\r\n\r\nAfter the Duc d'Orléans had gone I had a call from the Abbé Dupanloup,\r\nwho gave me some curious details concerning the Paris clergy, among\r\nwhom a silent but very definite opposition has arisen against Mgr.\r\nAffre. The vulgarity and rudeness of his manner rouses exasperation\r\nagainst him every day. He has admitted his entire hatred of the memory\r\nand the friends of the late Mgr. de Quélen; even my poor self am an\r\nobject of his dislike; and as for the Sacré Cœur, it is a case of\r\npersecution. The Abbé began to laugh when I said, \"Then we have become\r\nthe Fort-Royal of the Jesuits!\" Mgr. Affre does not venture to\r\ninterfere with the Abbé Dupanloup or his little seminary, and even\r\ngoes out of his way to please him, because of the Abbé's widespread\r\nrelations, which make him a favourite with M. Jaubert, Minister of\r\nPublic Works, with the Princesse de Beauffremont, a pronounced\r\nCarlist, with Madame de La Redorte, and with Madame de Gramont, of the\r\nSacré Cœur. Moreover, in the course of the week which preceded the\r\nnomination of the Archbishop, M. Thiers sent for him to ask his\r\nopinion about the state of the clergy. M. Thiers, with his usual\r\ntactlessness, had made an appointment at the same time with M. de\r\nMontalembert, who brought with him Mgr. Affre. The parties arrived\r\nsimultaneously, and were astounded at meeting one another. While they\r\nwere thus awaiting the Minister with surprise, he was closeted with\r\nM. Royer-Collard. Eventually the four men confronted one another for a\r\nfew moments--a memorable scene.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Dupanloup renewed his promise to come and see me at\r\nRochecotte in October; at the same time he did not hide the fact that\r\nhe might be unable to come if he saw that the Archbishop was unduly\r\ndisturbed, for he has to respect his feelings for the sake of his\r\nlittle seminary.\r\n\r\nIn the papers seized with Louis Bonaparte proofs were found that the\r\nundertaking was financed by Russia, with the connivance of the Carlist\r\nparty, led by Berryer, and the name of M. Thiers was too frequently\r\nmentioned. The King forbade the Chancellor to pursue his action in\r\nthis direction for two reasons: firstly, because M. Thiers would have\r\nbeen obliged to give evidence which would have embarrassed and\r\ncomplicated the general situation to a far greater extent; and,\r\nsecondly, because the King thinks it useless to show his foreign\r\nenemies to what an extent they can count on positive support from\r\nRussia. What will be the end of these conflicting interests and this\r\ngeneral complication?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 5, 1840._--Paris was greatly excited the day before\r\nyesterday and yesterday by the numerous gatherings and bands of\r\nworkmen. The newspapers give full details. Much money has been found\r\nupon those who have been arrested, which is supposed to come from the\r\nRusso-Bonapartists; such, at least, is the opinion of the Government.\r\nEvery day reveals some new social disease, and the age is racked by\r\ncruel sickness.\r\n\r\nYesterday I went to the Sacré Cœur for a long talk with Madame de\r\nGramont, whom I found uneasy and disturbed. She gave me full details\r\nof the harassing treatment laid upon her by the new Archbishop, and\r\nalso of his new style of ruling the Paris clergy, to which they are by\r\nno means accustomed. For instance, he reprimanded the poor old\r\nincumbent of Saint-Thomas-d'Aquin for the reason that he himself had\r\nbeen slandered in his parish, for which he regarded the incumbent as\r\nresponsible. In a certain sacristy he saw some young priests laughing\r\nat his vulgar manners, and addressed them with strong language. He\r\nwishes to force certain incumbents to resign. In short, there is\r\ngeneral disturbance throughout the diocese.\r\n\r\nI also went to Madame de Jaucourt, whom I found alone, aged and\r\nisolated, but lively. She told me a fact which I should have thought\r\nimpossible a few days ago, but which I am now more inclined to\r\nbelieve: that the Queen and Madame gave sixty thousand francs to M. de\r\nMontalembert's newspaper, the _Univers catholique_. For some time in\r\nthis paper accounts have been noticed of the King's conversations with\r\nforeign ambassadors.\r\n\r\nMadame de Castellane came to ask me to dine with her to-day, and with\r\nM. Molé, who will read us his speech upon the occasion of his\r\nadmission to the French Academy, where he is taking the place of M. de\r\nQuélen.\r\n\r\nThis morning I saw M. Hottinger, the banker, who is much disturbed\r\nabout the situation. He sees, with great uneasiness, that the efforts\r\nof diplomacy can be nullified at any moment by the will of the Pasha\r\nof Egypt, in whose hands it is obvious that the question of peace or\r\nwar now rests. Conspiracies and risings at Constantinople continually\r\ncomplicate all these questions for the worse. It is certain that only\r\na miraculous Providence could disperse these heavy clouds. At\r\nMarseilles trade has come to a standstill and people are warehousing\r\ntheir stocks; not a single ship is leaving the port, and every one is\r\nanxiously awaiting the issue.\r\n\r\nAt one o'clock I went to Saint-Cloud to see Madame Adélaïde; then I\r\nwent to the Queen, and afterwards to the Duchesse d'Orléans: she is\r\nreally charming, distinguished, witty, gracious, and self-restrained;\r\nher conversation is most agreeable and attractive. Madame Adélaïde\r\nseemed to me to think that peace will be preserved; heaven grant that\r\nshe is right!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 7, 1840._--The revolt is now breaking out with fresh\r\naudacity. Guns from the Invalides are galloping to the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Antoine, the assembly is beating continuously and troops are on\r\nthe march, while the National Guard is concentrated at the different\r\nmayors' houses; in short, this is a case of battle. So far our\r\nFaubourg Saint-Germain is peaceful, but it must be admitted that if\r\nthe combat is not soon concluded the left bank of the Seine will be no\r\nbetter off than the right. I am told that the bands scattered through\r\nParis are largely composed of Poles and Italians, wandering people\r\nwithout a fixed home, never sleeping twice in the same house, and\r\ntherefore difficult to seize. Since yesterday they have been\r\nthreatening to set Paris on fire, by way of simplifying their task.\r\nThe foremen of the factories, who have long known of the proposed\r\nmovement, had warned the Chief of Police, who had, however, no legal\r\nauthorisation to take adequate precautions. It was even impossible to\r\nprevent yesterday's terrible outbreak. To-day there is a general\r\npanic, and the troops and guns are ordered to do police work. Let us\r\nhope they will again stand firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 8, 1840._--Yesterday evening at eight o'clock I\r\nheard that the troops had driven the rioters out of Paris, and that\r\nthe town was tranquil; public buildings, however, were guarded, on\r\naccount of threats of incendiarism. In the afternoon I saw M. Molé,\r\nwho seemed to be quite overwhelmed by the fact that public stocks had\r\ngone down four francs. He also told me of the definite rupture of the\r\nDoctrinaires with M. Thiers, whose manifesto was inserted in a Rouen\r\nnewspaper, and has been quoted in M. Molé's newspaper, _La Presse_.\r\nThis conflict is said to be most energetic.\r\n\r\nThe _Journal des Débats_ is also very bitter against M. Thiers.\r\nBusiness men on the Stock Exchange are making outcries against him,\r\nand his position is becoming very difficult. A more pressing interest\r\nis the other war, the first demonstration of which seems to have been\r\nbrought about in Syria by the action of Admiral Napier. It is\r\ncertainly said that this Admiral is a madman, and that as he is backed\r\nby the hot-headed Lord Ponsonby this demonstration does not emanate\r\nfrom the English Government, but we wonder whether this Government\r\nwill disavow it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 10, 1840._--The general calm has outwardly at least\r\nbeen re-established at Paris. Yesterday I dined at Saint-Cloud, which\r\nhas been restored and furnished by the King in a magnificent fashion;\r\nsplendid Gobelin tapestry is to be seen there, copies from Rubens\r\nrepresenting the life of Marie de' Medici. The King took me round all\r\nthe rooms, and talked a little of every subject on the way, constantly\r\nsaying that he was anxious for peace and would do all he could to\r\npreserve it, but thought his task must be facilitated; this is not\r\nbeing done, either at home or abroad. His hatred of the Russians and\r\nhis bitterness towards England are extreme. He has a special, and not\r\nunreasonable, grudge against England, on account of present events in\r\nSpain. Queen Christina was convinced that if she could only see\r\nEspartero she could induce him to become her personal adherent, and\r\nhad therefore invited him to Madrid. On his refusal she undertook the\r\njourney which was her ruin. In her absence public feeling was\r\nmanufactured in the capital; she is now obliged to return under the\r\nmost ominous auspices. Probably her daughter will first be taken from\r\nher, and after that what will be done with her? This is the question\r\nwhich the King continually asks himself, uneasily repeating: \"I fear\r\nthe poor woman is ruined.\"[123] He says that England finances and\r\nencourages the anarchist movement; that Espartero is entirely English,\r\nand that if a general war bursts out we may expect to see him invade\r\nFrance as an English ally.\r\n\r\n  [123] After ending the civil war (aroused by Don Carlos on the\r\n  death of his brother, Ferdinand VII.) by the capitulation of\r\n  Bergara, Marie Christina attempted to begin a reactionary policy.\r\n  In 1840 she presented to the Cortes the law of the\r\n  _Ayuntamientos_, intended as a restriction upon municipal\r\n  freedom. An insurrection at once broke out in Barcelona, and\r\n  rapidly spread to Madrid and a large number of other towns. This\r\n  movement was supported by Espartero. The Queen-Regent summoned\r\n  him and commissioned him to form a Ministry on September 16,\r\n  1840, but he imposed such severe conditions upon her that she\r\n  thought acceptance impossible. On October 2 she resigned the\r\n  regency.\r\n\r\nThe King had heard that the King of Prussia had set the Archbishop of\r\nCologne at liberty and authorised him to return to Rome, but that the\r\nArchbishop would not take advantage of this permission until he had\r\nreceived fresh instructions from Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse de Nemours has a most inexpressive countenance and a\r\nmonotonous tone of voice, which somewhat counteracts the effect of her\r\nbrilliant youth. The Duc de Nemours remains as stupid as ever. The Duc\r\nd'Aumale is now regarded as a man. He seems lively and inclined to\r\ntalk. Princesse Clémentine is growing faded, and takes less trouble to\r\nplease. The Queen and the Duchesse d'Orléans are the two bright stars.\r\nM. Dupin, who was also dining at Saint-Cloud, was loudly groaning and\r\nharanguing about the weakness of the Government in their treatment of\r\nthe rioters, saying that as long as they were addressed with the words\r\n\"gentlemen and fellow toilers\" incendiarism and plunder might be\r\nexpected. The day before yesterday these workmen during the night\r\ndisarmed two outposts in the Rue Mauconseil, though it must be said\r\nthat the soldiers made no attempt to defend themselves. The result was\r\na fresh panic at the Stock Exchange yesterday. The fear, the grief,\r\nand the ruin which have overtaken a number of people cannot be\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nThe other day M. de Montrond was saying that M. de Flahaut was anxious\r\nto go to London as ambassador, but they are too glad to be rid of\r\nGuizot to recall him here, notwithstanding the dissatisfaction which\r\nhe causes on the other side of the Channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paris, September 11, 1840._--I have decided to start at the end of\r\nthe morning for Jeurs to visit the Comtesse Mollien, where I shall\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening on returning home I continued reading the accounts\r\nof the trial of Madame Lafarge, as I had fallen behind.[124] If she is\r\ninnocent of the crime, so much the better for her relations, but the\r\nevidence of the two expert bodies, her enormous purchases of arsenic,\r\nand the sudden transition from complete repugnance to excessive\r\ntenderness for her husband would always make me suspect her so far as\r\nto desire another nurse if she had to mix my potions.\r\n\r\n  [124] Madame Lafarge, with whom several people in French society\r\n  were compromised, was first accused of stealing diamonds and then\r\n  of poisoning her husband. The first accusation was never entirely\r\n  cleared up, but the second was proved. The Court of Assizes\r\n  condemned Madame Lafarge to penal servitude. She remained in\r\n  prison for twelve years, at the end of which she was pardoned\r\n  owing to her enfeebled health. She died a few months later, in\r\n  1852.\r\n\r\nI am especially shocked by Madame Lafarge's behaviour at one point,\r\nand by the uproarious laughter with which she greeted the emphatic and\r\nreally ridiculous evidence of one of the witnesses; such frivolity\r\nseems to me to be rather a proof of impudence than of innocence. The\r\nmore innocent a person might be, the more she would suffer under such\r\nan accusation, and while preserving a clear conscience her mind would\r\nbe filled with other ideas than any which could produce such bursts of\r\nlaughter. Her behaviour there shows a terrible lack of refinement and\r\na complete failure to realise her position, for when the accusation\r\nconcerns husband-poisoning, whether one is accuser or accused, I can\r\nhardly conceive of any inclination to hilarity. On the whole, whether\r\nshe is a poisoner or not, she is obviously an unpleasant adventuress.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Courtalin, September 14, 1840._--I left Jeurs very early yesterday,\r\nafter being, as usual, kindly and hospitably entertained. The day\r\nbefore yesterday I took a stroll with Madame Mollien in the valley of\r\nthe Juine, which extends from Etampes to Corbeil; it is well watered,\r\nwell wooded, and populous; great rocks peep out among the trees, as in\r\ncertain parts of the forest of Fontainebleau. The three chief\r\nresidences in this valley are Gravelles, belonging to M. de\r\nPerregeaux, Chamarande, belonging to M. de Talaru, and Ménilvoisin,\r\nbelonging to M. de Choiseul-Praslin. The first two of these I already\r\nknew, and Madame Mollien took me to see the third. It is a stately and\r\nspacious residence; the approaches and the park are handsome, but the\r\ngeneral appearance is depressing. This is characteristic of all the\r\nresidences in this district. They have no outlook, shut in as they are\r\nin this narrow valley. They lack space and air, but not water, of\r\nwhich there is such an abundance that dampness is unavoidable. The\r\nwaters of the Juine turn a number of mills, some of which are so large\r\nas to look like castles.\r\n\r\nI arrived here yesterday evening, and found all the Montmorency family\r\nassembled with a M. de Roothe, an old man of seventy-eight, son of the\r\nlast wife of Marshal Richelieu.\r\n\r\nThe only subject of discussion yesterday evening in the drawing-room\r\nwas the case of Madame Lafarge. Here, as everywhere, very opposite\r\nopinions prevail concerning her. Those who think her innocent say that\r\nher husband did not die of poisoning, but from taking cantharides as a\r\ntonic for nervous debility, and that the rapid change in his wife's\r\nbehaviour is to be attributed to his recovery from this failing, and\r\nalso the pleasure with which she saw him enter her room by the window\r\nwhen he did not come in by the door. Those who persist in thinking\r\nMadame Lafarge guilty say that the first experts should be believed,\r\nwho performed their analysis after the first post-mortem, rather than\r\nthe second, who went to work when putrefaction had set in. They also\r\nemphasise the evil tendencies, established by yesterday's evidence, of\r\nthe accused: her habits of lying and playing a part; her evil\r\nreputation from her youth; the haste with which her family attempted\r\nto get rid of her by marriage, even going so far as to apply to a\r\nmatrimonial agency. She is the granddaughter of a certain Madame\r\nCollard, who before her marriage bore the sole name of Hermine; she\r\nwas brought up by Madame de Genlis, and was generally supposed to be\r\nher daughter and the daughter of the Duc d'Orléans, father of the\r\npresent King of France. This ancestry of hers is supposed to account\r\nfor the keen interest taken in her case at the Tuileries. The\r\naccusation concerning the diamonds is differently regarded in\r\ndifferent circles. Mdmes. de Léautaud, de Montbreton, and the Nicolai,\r\nbelonging to the Faubourg Saint-Germain and that clique, think her\r\ncapable of theft and poisoning; the democracy, who are delighted to\r\nfind a society lady guilty, regard the fable which Madame Lafarge\r\ninvented about Madame Léautaud as true. Party spirit appears in\r\neverything and destroys all feelings of equity and justice.\r\n\r\nI have just received a letter from the Duchesse d'Albuféra, of which\r\nthe following is an extract: \"I was at Auteuil with Madame Thiers the\r\nevening of the day before yesterday. Considerable uneasiness prevailed\r\nabout current events; these are moving rapidly and becoming very\r\ncomplicated. The decision to fortify Paris had thrown the Stock\r\nExchange into excitement; it is a measure which will be enormously\r\nexpensive to carry out, and will rouse much apprehension. M. Thiers\r\nsaid that all his efforts were intended to gain time to finish his\r\npreparations; he added that if we could prolong the matter until April\r\nnext we should be in a state of defence, and he said that no one could\r\nbe more keenly interested in the question than the King and Queen. As\r\nregards Spain, he seems very uneasy and doubtful of the result; he\r\nreceives telegrams every day. On the 7th the Queen-Regent was still at\r\nValencia, but he thinks that she will perhaps have to fight a battle\r\nto return to her capital. The Town Council of Madrid appoint fresh\r\nMinisters every day, and anarchy there seems complete.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Courtalin, September 15, 1840._--At dinner-time two new arrivals\r\nappeared, the Duc de Rohan and his son the Prince of Léon. They\r\nbrought certain information that M. Anatole Demidoff had married\r\nPrincesse Mathilde de Montfort in return for the payment of the\r\nfather's debts by M. Demidoff. He is moved only by considerations of\r\nvanity, and has so acted in order to become connected with the King of\r\nWürtemberg and the King of Russia, but the connection is said to be\r\nunfavourably regarded by the two Sovereigns, and not likely to bring\r\nhim much satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bonnétable, September 17, 1840._--The day before yesterday, in the\r\nevening, after all the usual gossip of the Courtalin drawing-room, we\r\nhad some amusing anecdotes very well told by M. de Roothe concerning\r\nhis father-in-law, Marshal Richelieu.[125] He was married during three\r\ndifferent reigns, and the first marriage was ordered by Louis XIV.,\r\nwho had found a perfumed cap of the young fool too near the bed of the\r\nDuchesse de Bourgogne.\r\n\r\n  [125] At the age of fourteen the Duc de Richelieu, then Duc de\r\n  Fronsac, married Mlle. de Noailles, by order of King Louis XIV.\r\n  In 1734, after the sieges of Kehl and Philippsburg, where he\r\n  greatly distinguished himself, Richelieu married Mlle. de Guise,\r\n  Princess of Lorraine, and at the age of eighty-two he married a\r\n  third wife, Madame de Roothe. It is said that after the marriage\r\n  ceremony he went home to change his clothes, threw down the\r\n  ribbon of his order on the bed, and said to his footman: \"You can\r\n  go; the Holy Spirit will do the rest.\"\r\n\r\nI am astonished by the thought that I have dined with a man whose\r\nfather-in-law had been at the feet of that charming Princess and had\r\nbeen scolded by Madame de Maintenon. M. de Roothe said that Marshal\r\nRichelieu was always a lady's man, and that an hour before his death,\r\nwhen his daughter-in-law came to his bedside, and said that she\r\nthought he was better and looked stronger, he answered: \"Ah, the fact\r\nis that you see me through your fair eyes.\" M. de Roothe gave the\r\nfollowing account of his mother's marriage with Marshal Richelieu: A\r\nfew years previously, when her first husband was still alive, as she\r\nwas driving with him, they passed a carriage overturned and broken\r\nupon the Pont Neuf; they stopped to learn to whom the accident had\r\nhappened, and whether they could help the sufferers. It was the\r\nMarshal Richelieu whom they picked up and took home to his house in\r\ntheir carriage. The next day the Marshal called to thank M. and Madame\r\nde Roothe; he was struck with the beauty of the latter, and renewed\r\nhis visits so constantly that people remarked upon it to Madame de\r\nRoothe, telling her that the Marshal's reputation was such that it\r\nmight be dangerous to receive him too often, in spite of his eighty\r\nyears. Madame de Roothe therefore kept out of his way. Some time\r\nafterwards she became a widow, and was left with four children in such\r\nstraitened circumstances that she was obliged to sell her horses.\r\nMarshal Richelieu, disguised as a horse-dealer, appeared as purchaser,\r\nsaid that he could not come to an agreement with Madame de Roothe's\r\nservants, and asked to see her herself. He was taken in, and a\r\nrecognition followed. To cut explanations short, she told him that she\r\nhad changed her mind and would not sell her horses. M. de Richelieu\r\nwithdrew, but in order to help the poor widow he induced the King,\r\nwithout her knowledge, to find rooms for her in the Tuileries, the\r\nvery rooms where we have seen the Vicomtesse d'Agoult and Madame\r\nAdélaïde. Madame de Roothe accepted the King's kindness. Some months\r\nafterwards she learnt that she owed it to the Marshal, and she thought\r\nit her duty to write and thank him. He came to call upon her, fell at\r\nher feet, and said: \"If you are comfortable in these rooms, allow me\r\nat least to say that they are unworthy of you, and that the Richelieu\r\nresidence would suit you much better.\" The proposal was accepted, and\r\nthe marriage took place. Madame de Roothe became with child, but the\r\nDuc de Fronsac was furious at the thought that a birth might prejudice\r\nhis rights, and induced a chambermaid to give his mother-in-law a\r\ndraught which brought on a miscarriage.\r\n\r\nYesterday I travelled rapidly, thanks to good roads, good horses and\r\npostillions, and in particular to a hurricane which blew on our backs\r\nand swept the carriage, servants, and horses along in its blast. I\r\nfound the Duchesse Mathieu de Montmorency in good health, but slightly\r\ndeaf. Her chaplain is ill, and the customs of the house are\r\nconsequently altered.\r\n\r\nI have a letter from M. Bresson. His account of the political\r\nsituation is as follows: \"Things here have become somewhat calmer; the\r\nmatter will blow over, but resentment and distrust will remain. People\r\nwill no longer meet with the same cordiality, and will be continually\r\non their guard; in short, the ground is by no means as clear as it\r\nwas, a thing which M. de Talleyrand never liked, but I think that the\r\nmain storm has turned aside, and if you have made plans for a journey\r\nto Prussia next year you need not abandon them for any possible war.\r\nHerr von Werther has been rather seriously ill. The Prince of\r\nWittgenstein comes back to-morrow from Kissingen. Frau von Reede,\r\nseventy-four years of age as she is, is the leader of society at\r\nKönigsberg. We shall have some splendid festivities for the\r\nHuldigung.[126] The nobles of the Mark of Brandenburg have alone\r\nsubscribed twenty thousand crowns. All this brilliant prospect does\r\nnot restore my good-humour; my health is certainly changed by the\r\nclimate, and my character by isolation and exile. I have reached one\r\nof those periods in life, one of those frames of mind, when change is\r\nrequired at any cost, and it is for change that I hope. My best days\r\nare past; my few remaining ties in this world will soon be broken, and\r\nI ought to try to strengthen my connection with my country. You would\r\ndo me a very great service if you could induce my patroness, Madame\r\nAdélaïde, to smooth the path for my retirement.\"\r\n\r\n  [126] King Frederick William IV. was not exactly crowned, but he\r\n  went to Königsberg to receive the homage (_die Huldigung_) of his\r\n  subjects, who took the oath of fidelity to him through their\r\n  Deputies on September 10, 1840.\r\n\r\nI have an idea that M. Thiers will soon have no trouble in finding\r\nhigh diplomatic posts for his friends, owing to a large number of\r\nvoluntary resignations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 19, 1840._--I am now at Valençay, a spot so full\r\nof memories that it seems to me like a native land. M. and Madame de\r\nValençay are alone here with their children. They both seem very glad\r\nto see me again, and I am always happy to be back at Valençay. Here I\r\nam less cut off than elsewhere from an eventful past, and the dead are\r\nless far away than anywhere else.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 22, 1840._--M. and Madame de Castellane arrived\r\nhere yesterday from their native Auvergne, which seems by no means a\r\npleasant district in which to live. There are no high-roads to their\r\nresidence, but only badly made paths, which must be traversed in a\r\nlitter or on horseback. The snow is already upon their mountains,\r\nwhere there are no trees and no cultivation, nothing but grass for the\r\ncattle; there is no fruit and no vegetables, no game, and no doctor\r\nwithin easy reach. Pauline has grown thin and sunburnt; her husband is\r\nvery thin, and I hope they will pick up at Rochecotte, where we are\r\nall going. Their little daughter, Marie, is most satisfactory, fair,\r\nfat, and fresh, always in a good temper, laughing and restless, a\r\nlittle angel whom I was very glad to see again, and her mother with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nTo-day is St. Maurice's Day, formerly the most festive and animated of\r\ndays at Valençay. This year it will be celebrated only by a mass for\r\nthe repose of the soul of our dear M. de Talleyrand. It will be\r\ncelebrated in the chapel where he rests.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 24, 1840._--The great Lafarge drama is now\r\nconcluded; she has been condemned. The reflection which came to me\r\nupon reading the verdict is that the appearance of this woman, her\r\nspeeches, her gesture, and her bearing, produced a very striking\r\neffect and secured her conviction. It is a verdict which could by no\r\nmeans be inferred from the facts, for she has shown for a long time\r\ngreat presence of mind, while her counsel were extremely talented, and\r\nthe Public Prosecutor displayed a tactlessness akin to rudeness.\r\nPublic sympathies were widely divided, and Madame Lafarge was\r\nsupported by a powerful family. The extraordinary and unusual element\r\nin this case is that I can see no one, not even the condemned person,\r\nwho is in any way attractive. Apart from the prisoner herself, there\r\nis Denis, who seems to be a bad man; her mother Lafarge, who is too\r\nanxious about the will; the deceased man, whose business transactions\r\nwere a trifle shady; Madame de Léautaud, very frivolous; Madame de\r\nMontbreton, who was too fond of hypnotism; Madame de Nicolaï, who did\r\nnot look after her daughters properly. As the accusers of Madame\r\nLafarge numbered so few estimable persons, she must have strongly\r\nimpressed the jury with her guilt for them to bring in a verdict\r\nagainst her.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 25, 1840._--The Duc de Noailles has been to Paris\r\nto call upon Madame de Lieven on her return from London, and writes to\r\nme as follows: \"I found the Princesse much changed. There are still\r\nhopes of peace, and the Government is moving in that direction. The\r\nKing retains his confidence. The proposals of Mehemet Ali have opened\r\na new stage in the business, which may prevent war, but nothing is\r\nsettled; if the matter drags on until the spring Thiers will then be\r\nmore warlike than he now is, as we shall then have an army which we do\r\nnot now possess. There is a kindlier feeling towards Prussia than\r\ntowards the other three Powers. It seems that Berlin has already had\r\nmore than enough of the convention, and that Herr von Bülow is loudly\r\nabused for his presumption and his blindness.\"\r\n\r\nFrom another source I hear as follows: \"Uneasiness at London is\r\nspreading through every class. The English Ministry declares its\r\nastonishment at the measures taken in France and at the energy\r\ndisplayed by the King. I believe that Lord Palmerston is very anxious.\r\nThe Princesse de Lieven read a letter to M. de Montrond from Lady\r\nCowper which does not conceal the uneasiness and uncertainty of those\r\nabout her. They say Lord Holland stands entirely aloof from events. I\r\nhave certain information to the contrary; he writes letters of six\r\npages to Mr. Bulwer on current business, and shows as much keenness as\r\nany young man. He is said to be a very strong opponent of France. In\r\nboth England and Scotland the harvest is a bad one, which adds to the\r\nembarrassments of the English Cabinet. Meanwhile, though spirits are\r\nrising at Saint-Cloud, the breach seems to be widened by the exchange\r\nof notes in very bitter language. The whole matter is very confused,\r\nand it is impossible to forecast the result with any certainty.\"\r\n\r\nYesterday M. de Maussion came here from Paris, or rather from M.\r\nThiers, at whose house he has been living. He says that Madame de\r\nLieven is regarded as a spy in the house of M. Thiers, where she is\r\naccused of all kinds of treachery. He also says that M. de Flahaut\r\ncomes to M. Thiers every morning with a bundle of letters from\r\nEngland, that he poses as a man of importance, and that he and his\r\nwife are intriguing more vigorously than ever. He adds that M. de\r\nFlahaut is starting for England in order to be absent during the trial\r\nof Louis Bonaparte, but his wife is giving out that he has a secret\r\nand important mission to the English Cabinet, to repair the\r\ntactlessness of M. Guizot. There is a wish to remove M. Guizot, but M.\r\nThiers does not want him in Paris for the meeting of the Chambers, so\r\nM. de Flahaut is thrown back upon the embassy at Vienna, and it is\r\nthought that he will obtain it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 25, 1840._--Frau von Wolff writes to me from\r\nBerlin under date the 19th of this month: \"Our town is astir with\r\npreparations for the ceremonies to take place the day after to-morrow\r\nat the entry of the King and Queen, and is also busy with the\r\nentertainments which will be given when the oath of fidelity is taken.\r\nAn enormous number of strangers are coming in from every quarter. You\r\nwill have seen in the German newspapers how enthusiastically the King\r\nwas welcomed at Königsberg and with what royal dignity he ascended the\r\nthrone of his ancestors. All who were present agreed in saying that\r\nthe King's impromptu speech after the oath was more moving than\r\nanything they have known. The speech was so unprepared that the Queen\r\nhalted as though with astonishment when she saw the King suddenly rise\r\nand approach the railing; there he stopped, and, raising one hand to\r\nheaven, he uttered in a strong, sonorous voice which went to every\r\nheart and was heard at the end of the enclosure, the simple words of\r\nhope for the future. He moved many to tears, and shed tears himself.\r\nWe need only pray to heaven to preserve us the blessings of peace;\r\nhitherto the prospects of war have not shaken the general confidence.\r\nThe King's energy and activity in the work of government is\r\nincomparable. To judge from the beginning he has made, Prussia will\r\nmake giant strides under his rule; but I repeat, to enjoy the golden\r\nage which seems to smile upon us peace must be preserved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 28, 1840._--Yesterday we were amused by a small\r\ndramatic performance during the evening, which began by the dialogue\r\nbetween Agrippine and Néron,[127] played in costume by M. de Montenon,\r\nwho took the part of Néron, and my son-in-law as Agrippine, a truly\r\nfeminine monstrosity. Then _Le Mari de la Veuve_ was acted with much\r\nvigour, balance, and spirit by my son Louis, my daughter Pauline,\r\nMlle. Clément de Ris, and Mlle. de Weizel. Then we had two scenes from\r\nthe _Dépit amoureux_ by Mlle. Clément de Ris, M. de Montenon, M. and\r\nMadame d'Entraigues, and finally _Passé Minuit_ by MM. de Maussion and\r\nde Biron, which greatly amused the pit. After the performance there\r\nwas supper and a dance, and all passed off very cheerfully.\r\n\r\n  [127] From Racine's tragedy _Britannicus_, Act IV. scene ii.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 29, 1840._--I have a number of letters, one of\r\nwhich says: \"The meeting of the Cabinet has been called at London for\r\nMonday the 7th. It is thought unlikely that Lord Palmerston will be\r\nable to carry his own views, and the Ministers are said to be by no\r\nmeans unanimous; for this reason some hope survives that peace may be\r\nmaintained; on the other hand, nothing is known of the nature of the\r\ninstructions sent to the Mediterranean, and the whole situation is\r\nvery uncertain.\"\r\n\r\nNow for Madame de Lieven. She begins with many moans over her health,\r\nand ends: \"My health, however, is not so bad as that of Europe. What a\r\ndisturbance everywhere! War is the most likely consequence. To think\r\nthat people could allow things to reach this point and that not a man\r\nin Europe can conduct a piece of business properly! Prince Metternich\r\nmust be dead. Every one desires peace passionately, and see to what\r\nthe wild love of peace has brought Europe! Indeed, the whole world\r\nmust be mad! The crisis must be settled in a few weeks. I am told that\r\nVienna is making great efforts, but Palmerston is very obstinate. In\r\nFrance there has been an outcry, and much more also than mere outcry.\r\nWhat self-respecting persons would think of retreating? I should like\r\na talk with you; we have seen better times, and I have many things to\r\ntell you of London which would astonish you. My dear Duchesse, if war\r\nbreaks out I am bound to be the first to leave Paris and France, and\r\nwhere shall I go? It is abominable!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valençay, September 30, 1840._--M. Molé writes as follows: \"The Comte\r\nde Paris has been very ill--in fact, in the greatest danger; he is\r\nbetter, but not cured. No doubt you know that Madame de Lieven has\r\nreturned; her friend M. Guizot--and I am certain of my facts--will\r\nsoon break with his master and superior, M. Thiers. The discussion\r\nupon the Address will be the latest date for the accomplishment of\r\nthis great event.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse d'Albuféra says: \"Anxiety continues to prevail here;\r\npeople are asking what answer is to be sent to the proposals of\r\nMehemet Ali, but many people think that thunderbolts will be the\r\nanswer. In France armaments are being organised upon a very large\r\nscale. The Duchesse de Massa has arrived in time to close the eyes of\r\nMarshal Macdonald, her father. It is thought that his marshal's baton\r\nwill go to General Sébastiani. The Princesse de Lieven receives a\r\nwritten despatch from our London Ambassador every day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tours, October 2, 1840._--Here I find a letter from M. de\r\nSainte-Aulaire, who writes from Vienna on September 23: \"The matter\r\nwould proceed excellently, if it were conducted here; but discussion\r\ntakes place at Vienna and Berlin, and negotiations at London, where, I\r\nbelieve, a very different temper unfortunately prevails.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 4, 1840._--Yesterday's newspapers contain a long\r\nexplanatory note from Lord Palmerston, addressed to the English\r\nMinister in Paris, Mr. Bulwer, which puts the Eastern question in a\r\nvery different light from that given by the French narratives.[128] We\r\nhave also news of the capture of Beyrout,[129] which is a strong\r\nbeginning to the course of coercive measures. What will be the result?\r\n\r\n  [128] The memorandum addressed by the French Government to Lord\r\n  Palmerston will be found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n  [129] Beyrout had been taken from Turkey by Ibrahim Pasha, whose\r\n  victories had subjugated the whole of Syria for the Viceroy of\r\n  Egypt. As this expedition threatened the Ottoman Empire, and, in\r\n  fact, nearly brought about a European war, the town of Beyrout\r\n  was bombarded and captured from Mehemet Ali by an Anglo-Austrian\r\n  squadron in 1840.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 5, 1840._--My son-in-law has a letter from Paris\r\ntelling him that the _salon_ of M. Thiers on the day when the news\r\narrived of the capture of Beyrout was so bellicose that it threatened\r\nto throw the whole world into a conflagration. However, in the\r\n_Journal des Débats_ of the 3rd instant I saw a small article on this\r\nquestion urging calm and moderation, and when I consider the inspired\r\nnature of this paper I have become a little calmer.\r\n\r\nI had expected that the pleadings of M. Berryer on behalf of Prince\r\nLouis Bonaparte would display a seditious tendency, would be\r\nblustering, rash, and outrageous. I was greatly surprised to find that\r\nI could read them without the slightest emotion. But I have often\r\nnoticed that when one reads Berryer's speeches they do not produce an\r\neffect in harmony with his reputation, and that one must hear him to\r\nbe dazzled and attracted, to such an extent does he possess the outer\r\nand attractive qualities of an orator.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 6, 1840._--The Duchesse d'Albuféra writes from\r\nParis: \"Events in the East are of a very alarming nature, and so also\r\nis the language of the Ministerial newspapers, for which the\r\nmoderation of the Saint-Cloud organ[130] is but a small compensation.\r\nThe former journalists threaten M. Thiers that they will break with\r\nhim if he does not begin war. Prussia and Austria seem decidedly\r\nanxious not to make war upon us or upon anybody; it is difficult to\r\nunderstand the situation. M. de Flahaut is at London staying with Lord\r\nHolland, who sees the Ministers every day and tells his wife that he\r\nis trying to convince them of our real position, but this officious\r\nservice will probably have no great result, as people at London seem\r\nto have made up their minds. I have seen Lady Granville; both she and\r\nher husband are greatly depressed. They still hope that war will not\r\nbreak out, and I know that Lord Granville is doing all he can to\r\nproduce a calmer frame of mind. Everybody one meets is uneasy and\r\nanxious, nor will they talk of anything but of the memorandum, of\r\nBeyrout, of Espartero and the fortifications; they go to bed in\r\nexcitement and awake painfully anxious. You are lucky to be far away\r\nfrom such a turmoil. Nobody pays attention to the trial of Louis\r\nBonaparte; M. d'Alton-Shée alone voted for death, after a violent\r\nspeech. The proposal was badly received by the rest of the Chamber.\"\r\n\r\n  [130] _I.e._ the _Journal des Débats_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 7, 1840._--Yesterday I heard a sad piece of\r\nnews--the death of my poor friend the Countess Batthyàny at Richmond\r\non the 2nd. She had recently felt an improvement in her health, which\r\nhad induced her to consider the possibility of coming to live at\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nI hear from Paris: \"M. Molé is at Paris for the trial of Louis\r\nBonaparte, in which M. Berryer was a complete failure. All minds are\r\nabsorbed by the bombardment of Beyrout and the possible consequences.\r\nThere is a universal outcry against M. Thiers. Madame de Lieven is\r\nrather ill; she is feverish, and sees visitors in her long chair. She\r\nprofesses a close attachment for M. Guizot, but is said to show a\r\ntendency to coldness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 8, 1840._--Yesterday I had a letter from Madame\r\nde Lieven, begun on the 5th and finished on the 6th. The following is\r\nan extract from the part dated the 5th: \"In England nothing has been\r\ndecided; the Ministers are not agreed; however, the peace party is\r\npredominant, to which Palmerston himself pretends to belong, though he\r\ndoes not offer any means of finding a solution satisfactory to France;\r\nmoreover, his hands are not free, as he must ask for Russia's consent\r\nat every moment. Since the bombardment of Beyrout Thiers seems to\r\nthink his position no longer tenable unless he makes some bold stroke;\r\nhis colleagues are not all of his opinion, and the King is not in\r\nfavour of extreme measures. However, some decision must be made. Lord\r\nGranville is very anxious. Things have gone so far that change is\r\ninevitable. It was even said yesterday that Thiers wished to send two\r\nhundred thousand men to the Rhine and a French fleet to Alexandria to\r\noppose the English. This would be an act of madness. The situation is\r\nvery dangerous, and assuming that Thiers breaks with the Government,\r\nwhere are people to be found sufficiently resolute to undertake the\r\nheavy burden now before them?\"\r\n\r\nOn the 6th she writes: \"The three or four councils held within the\r\nlast two days have ended in the resolution to send a protest to the\r\nEnglish Government in which a _casus belli_ will be laid down, and I\r\nthink that Alexandria and Saint-Jean d'Acre will be the points at\r\nissue; but if one of these towns were to be attacked at this moment\r\nwhat would become of the protest? The English Government has on its\r\nside addressed notes to its allies to modify the treaty; negotiations\r\nare going on with tolerable frankness, but meanwhile military\r\noperations are also proceeding. They say that the King is not in\r\nentire agreement with M. Thiers concerning the _casus belli_; he is\r\nalso said to be especially satisfied with M. Cousin, who is on good\r\nterms with Admiral Roussin and M. Gouin. I am told on good authority\r\nthat the meeting of the Chambers is arranged for the early days of\r\nNovember, and that the protest of which I told you will be decided\r\nthis morning. Saint-Jean d'Acre will not be mentioned in it.\"\r\n\r\nThis interesting letter gave much food for our conversation. The Duc\r\nde Noailles, who is here, and who has brought his manuscript, read us\r\na passage on quietism.[131] It is clearly written, and in a good and\r\nbrisk style, with well-chosen quotations which enliven the subject.\r\n\r\n  [131] This piece is to be found in the _History of Madame de\r\n  Maintenon and the Chief Events of the Reign of Louis XIV._, the\r\n  first part of which was to appear in 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 11, 1840._--Yesterday we heard of the sudden\r\ndeath of Arthur de Mortemart,[132] a fine young fellow, who was to\r\ninherit a magnificent fortune, and also, though I did not know the\r\nfact, to marry the daughter of the Duc de Noailles, who set off\r\nimmediately upon hearing the sad news. Arthur de Mortemart was\r\ntwenty-seven years of age, and an only son. It is a dreadful blow to\r\nhis family.\r\n\r\n  [132] The only son of the Duc de Mortemart, who died in\r\n  consequence of a fall from a carriage.\r\n\r\nM. Molé writes: \"The Chambers are being convoked for the 28th, and my\r\nfriends insist that I should return to Paris between the 15th and\r\n20th. I agree, but we shall have nothing but the remarkable and barren\r\npleasure of exchanging our condolences. We are advancing with fatal\r\nrapidity towards a revolutionary Government, which may lead to even\r\nmore bloodshed than before. God alone knows how long it will last and\r\nwhat will take its place. However, if the newspapers do not mislead\r\nand divide the right-minded party we should emerge successfully, with\r\ncourage, but our domestic difficulties make the situation\r\nirremediable; foreign affairs would easily be settled if our home\r\npolicy inspired any confidence. In any case, the Chamber will have to\r\ndecide the whole matter, but there is little hope that it will rise to\r\nthe greatness of its task. I do not know what will happen to my\r\nreception at the Academy in the midst of all this. I am ready, and\r\nnotwithstanding the arguments of M. Villemain, who seems to be\r\nintimidated, I shall omit nothing from my eulogy of Mgr. de Quélen,\r\nand I invoke the great day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 12, 1840._--A letter from M. de Barante at St.\r\nPetersburg tells me: \"I am waiting for news from elsewhere, for at St.\r\nPetersburg nothing is decided, nor in reality do people greatly care.\r\nPeace would be perhaps the wiser course, but war is more in conformity\r\nwith the sentiments which people have been professing for ten years;\r\nso they will only do what England wishes. You can make your\r\nconjectures in accordance with this view; you know Lord Palmerston and\r\nall his political environment, of which I have no idea.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 14, 1840._--Madame de Montmorency writes to say\r\nthat M. Demidoff has written to M. Thiers for authorisation to\r\nannounce his wife at Paris as Her Royal Highness Madame the Princesse\r\nde Montfort. Madame Demidoff has written personally to Madame Thiers,\r\nwhom she knew in Italy, on this subject, and the King has given his\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 17, 1840._--The Duchesse d'Albuféra writes:\r\n\"Peace now seems to be a trifle nearer. Negotiations have been\r\nresumed, and people are agreed in saying that if war is to break out\r\nit will not be for a considerable time, and that many diplomatic notes\r\nwill be exchanged before we reach that extremity. General de Cubières,\r\nMinister of War, had resigned because he thought the majority in the\r\nCouncil too warlike, and his opinion was that we should be unable to\r\nwage a successful war with the Powers and must avoid the possibility.\r\nHis resignation, however, has not been accepted, as the negotiations\r\nand prospects of peace have been resumed, at any rate for the moment.\r\nThe French memorandum has brought many over to the side of M. Thiers.\r\nThe vacant Presidency of the Chamber is a post which occupies many\r\nminds; opinions are divided between M. Odilon Barrot and M. Sauzet.\r\nThe Comte de Paris has fallen ill again, and his parents are very\r\nuneasy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 19, 1840._--Madame de Lieven writes: \"The English\r\nCabinet has welcomed the French note. The peace party is gaining\r\nstrength, but the issue does not lie in that direction. St.\r\nPetersburg, which is a long way off, must be consulted, and during\r\nthese delays the newspapers are able to interfere. The memorandum of\r\nThiers has caused much satisfaction at Paris, and some embarrassment\r\nto Lord Palmerston; at St. Petersburg it will be thought that he says\r\naloud what has hitherto been whispered. As for Austria, Apponyi claims\r\nthat the narrative is inaccurate where Austria is concerned. In any\r\ncase, the decision is imminent, and will be known on November 15. The\r\nfour Powers care nothing about the war or about France; so we may ask\r\nin what direction or for what reason France will take action.\r\nUnfortunately there is a general idea that peace and M. Thiers are\r\nincompatible. This would be quite dangerous, for excitement is high,\r\nand Thiers in the scales can outweigh war.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 20, 1840._--The newspapers contain an account of\r\na fresh attempt to assassinate the King, made by a certain\r\nDarmès.[133] The constant repetition of these attempts makes one\r\ntremble, and it is impossible to avoid uneasiness.\r\n\r\n  [133] On October 15, 1840, about six o'clock in the evening,\r\n  Louis-Philippe was returning from Paris to Saint-Cloud with the\r\n  Queen and Madame Adélaïde. They were driving along the Quai des\r\n  Tuileries, and had reached the Poste du Lion, when an explosion\r\n  was heard; but the weapon which the assassin Darmès had used\r\n  against the King had burst and the charge had exploded backwards.\r\n  As soon as the assassin had been arrested and imprisoned it\r\n  became necessary to amputate his left hand, which was entirely\r\n  shattered.\r\n\r\nYesterday my son-in-law received letters from Paris which say that the\r\nwind seems to blow in the direction of war. Lord Palmerston is stated\r\nto be anxious to insist upon the full enforcement of the treaty. Our\r\nMinister thinks himself certain of a majority, rather because of the\r\napprehension with which his opponents would view their own accession\r\nto power in the present situation, than of any confidence inspired by\r\nthe Cabinet. After the attempted assassination by Darmès the Duc\r\nd'Orléans is said to have declared that he was strongly in favour of\r\nwar, and would rather be killed on the banks of the Rhine than\r\nmurdered in a Paris slum. All our letters agree that excitement is\r\nrunning high and that conditions are both complicated and serious.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 21, 1840._--Yesterday the papers announced the\r\nabdication of Queen Christina. This event will not form an agreeable\r\npage in the annals of M. de La Redorte's Spanish embassy.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Noailles writes as follows: \"Many people are saying that\r\nThiers will resign, and many say that he is in a difficulty upon the\r\nsubject. He does not see how he can appear before the Chambers. He\r\nwould like to arrange a retreat which would leave him at the head of a\r\nparty, by making people believe that he was unable to persuade the\r\nKing to take the energetic resolutions which the national honour\r\nrequires. On the other hand, thus to be eclipsed, to leave every one\r\nin difficulty, after raising and provoking all these questions, to\r\nevade discussion and responsibility before the Chambers, would\r\ncertainly be disgraceful. However, people who are best informed think\r\nthat he will resign. The speech from the throne is now the only point\r\nupon which he can disagree and request permission to retire.\r\n\r\n\"Prussia definitely refuses to let any horses go out of its territory.\r\nIt is hoped that some will be found in Normandy and Holland. The\r\nsituation is extremely embarrassing, for we are certainly not ready\r\nfor war, and cannot be before spring, and yet loans have already been\r\neffected to the amount of four hundred and fifty millions. The deficit\r\nwill be a bottomless pit. If stocks fall to ninety-nine, when by law\r\nsixteen millions a month must be redeemed, and if money is taken from\r\nthe savings banks, the Treasury will be in a hopeless difficulty. The\r\nSyrian expedition seems to have no immediate result; Ibrahim allows\r\nthe allies to seize the seaboard, which is separated from the rest of\r\nthe country by a chain of mountains which runs along the sea, and\r\nwhich the disembarked troops cannot cross. He holds all this country,\r\nwhich is overawed by his army and dare not revolt, and is waiting for\r\nthe storms to drive away the fleet, which cannot then return before\r\nspring. I have seen a letter from Lady Palmerston, strongly inclined\r\nto peace. Guizot also writes that Downing Street is now calmer.\r\n\r\n\"The King is very depressed by this further attempt to assassinate\r\nhim, and Thiers feels that the credit of the Ministry is not improved\r\nby the event. The Deputies who are already here and those who are\r\narriving are said to be inclined for peace. I hear that the Chamber of\r\nPeers is tempted, if it has the courage--which I doubt--to adopt a\r\npatronising and embarrassing attitude towards the Ministry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 23, 1840._--Madame Adélaïde, in a very kind\r\nanswer to a letter from myself, writes as follows about the attempted\r\nassassination \"The King's first word after the explosion to the Queen\r\nand to myself was, 'Well, it seems that you must always be in this\r\nfatal carriage,' a truly touching remark.\"\r\n\r\nI have the following from Madame de Lieven: \"Granville yesterday\r\nhanded in Lord Palmerston's answer to the note of the 8th. I believe\r\nthat this answer undertakes to revoke the proposal for the Pasha's\r\ndeposition, if he submits; you will see that this does not help\r\nmatters. All that can now be said is that the general attitude and\r\nlanguage upon either side is gentler, and may possibly lead to an\r\nunderstanding. Lord Palmerston will not explain himself more clearly,\r\nas he is waiting for news of some brilliant successes in Syria; so far\r\nhe has waited in vain. The tone of the French Ministry is less\r\nwarlike; they say that war may arrive in spring, if winter does not\r\nsettle everything. Here you see a change, and diplomacy at Paris is\r\ninclined to believe in peace. We shall see what the Chambers will do;\r\ntheir action will be important both upon events and individuals.\r\n\r\n\"The King has not appeared in the town since the shot was fired at\r\nhim. On this subject the foreign newspapers comment far more suitably\r\nthan the French.\r\n\r\n\"The dissensions in the English Cabinet are said to be more obvious,\r\nand Palmerston is thought to be in the minority. M. de Flahaut, who\r\narrives to-morrow, will enlighten us upon this subject. Madame de\r\nFlahaut is now very anti-Palmerston, because she naturally fears the\r\npossibility of war between her two native lands.[134] Lord John\r\nRussell has gone over to the majority against Palmerston, and, feeble\r\nthough he is, his influence is important. Things in general are in\r\nincredible confusion, but I am really beginning to hope that there is\r\na little more prospect of peace than there has been for the last few\r\ndays.\"\r\n\r\n  [134] Madame de Flahaut was an Englishwoman, daughter of Admiral\r\n  Keith (Lord Elphinstone). He was ordered to notify Napoleon I.,\r\n  when he sought hospitality on the English coast in 1815, that he\r\n  was a prisoner of the allies. He was also ordered to prepare for\r\n  the prisoner's transport to St. Helena.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 24, 1840._--Yesterday my son-in-law heard that\r\nthe French Ministry had resigned upon the occasion of the speech from\r\nthe Crown, which it wished to devote to the subject of the _casus\r\nbelli_, against the King's desires.[135]\r\n\r\n  [135] Thiers and his Ministry went out on October 29, 1840, and\r\n  were replaced by M. Guizot. Thiers was not to return to power\r\n  under the reign of Louis-Philippe.\r\n\r\nMy son, M. de Dino, tells me that the Grand Duke of Tuscany has made\r\nM. Demidoff Prince of San Donato, a name derived from his silk\r\nmanufacture, and has given him the title of Excellency. The Pope[136]\r\nhas sent the dispensations for the marriage. The dowry of the young\r\nPrincess is settled at two hundred and fifty thousand francs, with\r\ntwenty-five thousand francs pin-money.\r\n\r\n  [136] The Pope was then Gregory XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, October 25, 1840._--Queen Christina is apparently\r\nintending to settle at Florence, where her sentimental interests are\r\ncentred. She has two children by Muñoz, whom she adores, and has\r\nmanaged to save an income of fifteen hundred thousand francs.\r\n\r\nThe little Comte de Paris is very ill, in continuous fever, which\r\nwastes him away. The Duc d'Orléans is greatly distressed, and the\r\nDuchesse is in bed very weak and unhappy. She is not allowed to move\r\nfor fear of a miscarriage, as she is now in her eighth month. The poor\r\nroyal family is receiving some heavy blows.\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 2, 1840._--Queen Christina is not going to\r\nItaly; Nice, Paris, and then Bordeaux, such are said to be her\r\nmovements. She wishes to remain near Spain, in order to keep an eye\r\nupon the progress of events.\r\n\r\nMadame de Lieven writes as follows, the day before yesterday: \"You see\r\nwhat has happened here; things are becoming very stormy; M. Guizot\r\nmust be very courageous to embark in such a vessel. At London the\r\ngeneral tone is becoming much milder, and will continue to improve in\r\nfavour of the new Ministry, but a great deal will have to be done to\r\nsatisfy the madmen here, and an ill interpretation will be placed upon\r\nEnglish self-satisfaction. Thus there are many difficulties which are\r\nfar from a solution. The Chamber will be in a state of continual\r\nstorm, an interesting spectacle, but likely to become frightful. The\r\nKing is said to be delighted that he has got rid of Thiers, and to be\r\ncharmed with his new Ministers;[137] I wish I could believe that his\r\nsatisfaction was likely to last. Thiers says that he will not oppose\r\nGuizot; this is nonsense. The Comte de Paris is better. The Duc\r\nd'Orléans is not satisfied with the change of Ministers, but King\r\nLeopold is very pleased.\"\r\n\r\n  [137] The new Cabinet was composed as follows: Minister of War\r\n  and President of the Council, Marshal Soult; Foreign Affairs, M.\r\n  Guizot; Public Works, M. Teste; the Interior, M. Duchâtel;\r\n  Finance, M. Humann; Education, M. Villemain; Justice, M. Martin\r\n  du Nord; Commerce, M. Cunin-Gridaine; Naval Affairs, Admiral\r\n  Duperré.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 4, 1840._--A letter which I have just received\r\nfrom M. Molé contains the following: \"The outgoing Ministry was\r\nruining everything, and in three months would have involved us in war\r\nwith the whole of Europe, and given us a revolutionary Government into\r\nthe bargain. I do not know what the new Ministry will do, but it\r\ncannot do worse, or even as badly. The method of its formation has\r\nobliged me to stand aloof--an easy part to play, and one which I\r\nusually prefer, the more so as when I do take part I never do so by\r\nhalves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 5, 1840._--My son, M. de Dino, writes from Paris\r\nthat great preparations are being made to decorate the route by which\r\nthe procession will pass bringing back the remains of Napoleon from\r\nSt. Helena, and that a strange idea has been proposed, to have a row\r\nof the effigies of all the Kings of France. I suppose they will be\r\nplaced there to present arms to the usurper. Really, people are\r\nabsurd nowadays; in any case, this fine idea emanates from the\r\nCabinet of M. Thiers, and not from the present Ministry.\r\n\r\nA letter from Madame Mollien says: \"Yesterday evening, in the middle\r\nof the theatre, Bergeron, the foremost of all the King's assassins,\r\nentered a box, where was seated M. Emile de Girardin, the editor of\r\n_La Presse_, to whom, without saying a word, he gave a box on the\r\nears. M. Girardin bounded up like a madman; his wife, who is twice as\r\nbig and strong as he is, caught him by his collar, shouting, 'Don't go\r\nout! You shall not go out! He is an assassin!' The result is said to\r\nhave been an incredible scene; everybody intervened, all were in a\r\nquarrelsome state of mind, and in the corridors and vestibule nothing\r\ncould be heard except challenges and appointments.\"\r\n\r\nHere is an extract from another letter in a different strain: \"M.\r\nGuizot and Madame de Lieven are the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, and\r\nI have a fear that M. de Broglie must be content with the fate of the\r\nSultan's wife, Validé. M. Molé has not been offered a position; the\r\nKing continually repeats that M. Molé declined to lend a hand; this is\r\nnot the case. At so serious a crisis no thinking man would use such\r\nlanguage, but the matter is most easily explained in this way. The\r\n_Journal des Débats_ has since been carefully working upon the\r\nscruples of M. Molé, and said to him: 'If you refuse to support the\r\nCabinet, which is Conservative, the Left will come into power, and it\r\nwill be your fault. It is a crime against the country,' &c. This\r\nattitude seems to resemble the case of parents who, when they have a\r\nson dangerously ill, say to a girl, 'If you do not grant him an\r\ninterview he will die, and it will be your fault.' If I were a girl I\r\nassure you that in this case I should look after myself. My opinion is\r\nthat M. Molé should remain a member of the Academy and nothing more.\r\nMoreover, he will be none the worse off for that. Do you know that\r\nMaurice de Noailles is to become a priest? It is said that Barante\r\nwill be Ambassador at London. I hope so.\"\r\n\r\nMy son-in-law hears that Maurice de Noailles is entering the Church in\r\ndespair, because he could not marry the daughter of the Duc de\r\nNoailles. I admit that I do not believe this story as yet, and await\r\nsome confirmation of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 6, 1840._--Yesterday's post brought me a long\r\nletter from M. de Salvandy: \"We are emerging from a Ministerial\r\ncrisis, which has passed off with little incident, except that M. Molé\r\nhas remained outside the new combination. He feels, with much\r\nexasperation, that some supreme influence has secured his exclusion.\r\nAt the outset of the crisis M. de Montalivet worked very hard to find\r\na post for M. Molé in the new Cabinet: he went about everywhere, and\r\ndeclared on all sides that his co-operation was indispensable, to M.\r\nMolé more emphatically than to any one. I could not help saying to M.\r\nMolé that so much zeal seemed suspicious, and that I could not but\r\ninfer some bad result. However, M. Molé's chances of office never\r\namounted to anything, nor has he been treated with any of that\r\nceremony, which might outwardly have soothed his feelings; in fact,\r\npractically no notice has been taken of any member of the Ministry of\r\nApril 15. Only upon the last day were they considered in the least.\r\nThe new body was brought together with such little thought that no\r\neffort was made to secure M. Passy, who was ready to come in\r\nunconditionally, but was united with M. Dufaure; the latter based his\r\nrefusal upon a personal dislike for M. Martin du Nord rather than upon\r\npolitical motives. M. Passy and M. Dufaure had no objection to myself\r\nor to M. Laplagne. Thus it would have been possible with no great\r\ndifficulty to gather round Marshal Soult and M. Guizot some members of\r\nthe Ministries of April 15 and May 12. These would have formed a good\r\nnucleus for a majority, at once compact and permanent. Instead of\r\nthis, a Ministry has been lumped together, and it is expected that the\r\ndangers evoked by M. Thiers will provide votes at first, while the\r\nfuture can take care of itself. When the Cabinet, however, was formed,\r\nit was remembered that no measures had been taken to secure the\r\nadherence of the Left Centre, or even of the Conservative party. Then\r\nthey took steps to repair this mistake, and the Ministers all came to\r\nme. M. Guizot, whom I had not seen since the Coalition, came wearing\r\nhis order, to ask me solemnly for my co-operation. I did not hide the\r\nfact that it was rather late, and that this fashion of forming a\r\nMinistry without paying attention to any one, or respecting M. Molé\r\nand his party by the observance of outward formality, increased the\r\ndifficulty of a situation, which was already complicated enough. When\r\nI heard M. Guizot I remembered what I was saying to the Duc d'Orléans\r\na few days ago, that of the two rivals it was difficult to say which\r\nis the more futile; that if Thiers is futile without, Guizot is so\r\nwithin; in fact, Guizot has not a notion of the domestic dangers, the\r\nParliamentary difficulties, and the general peril caused by the\r\nabstention of M. Passy and M. Dufaure; for they, added to Lamartine\r\nand myself, would form a possible Cabinet intermediate between that of\r\nto-day and that of M. Odilon Barrot, whether we took M. Molé, M. de\r\nBroglie, or even M. Thiers for our leader. In short, their confidence\r\nand presumption have been inexplicable, while they have completely\r\nforgotten the apostasy of 1839, which is aggravated by this fresh\r\nchange of creed and colour. They are convinced that their theories can\r\nbe resumed at the point where they had dropped them, and talk of\r\nsafeguards, order, and resistance with the same authority. They have\r\nno notion of the fury which this language is likely to arouse among\r\ntheir adversaries, and regard us as cold and disagreeable. However, we\r\nshall support them, for we are men of honour before all things, and I\r\nam equally certain that there will be a majority on the general\r\nquestion. Thiers has brought things to such a point that his\r\nrestoration would mean both revolution and war; but the humiliation\r\nabroad which Guizot's Cabinet will have to confront is likely to be a\r\ncrushing burden. Honourable men do not pardon Thiers for making this\r\nhumiliation inevitable, and in three months no one will pardon Guizot\r\nfor yielding to it. In my opinion he will have to give way in a short\r\ntime, but if he performs the double service of bringing us through a\r\ngreat difficulty without increasing it and of paving the way for a new\r\nConservative majority he will have done a good deal. I do not despair,\r\nand for my part will certainly help him. He left me and went on to\r\nopen conciliatory measures with M. Molé.\r\n\r\n\"The immediate cause of Thiers' rupture with the King is as follows:\r\nIn the speech Thiers demanded further measures, that is, an additional\r\nhundred and fifty thousand men--making six hundred and fifty thousand\r\nin all, the mobilisation of the National Guards, camps upon the Rhine\r\nand the Alps, in short, war. The King tried to compromise by saying\r\nthat his Ministers would explain what they had done and what they\r\nintended to do. Thiers refused; it seems as though there was no\r\nsincerity on either side. Thiers felt that his position was untenable:\r\nthe Left was trembling, the Conservatives would venture anything in\r\ntheir fright, and his own foolishness will not bear discussion. The\r\nKing on his side was bold enough to regard his attempted assassination\r\nby Darmès as a possible starting-point from which to turn the struggle\r\nagainst himself and overthrow his Cardinal de Retz, while he ran no\r\nrisk for his power, but a very great deal of risk for his life.\r\n\r\n\"The Conservative party thus seems to be reorganised by the return of\r\nthe large majority of the Doctrinaires and the probable support of the\r\nLeft Centres, who are in terror, but the Doctrinaire party is divided;\r\nM. Duvergier de Hauranne and M. Piscatory follow M. de Rémusat and M.\r\nJaubert from the Left; M. Broglie is divided between the two camps; M.\r\nThiers continues to rely upon him, and flatters himself that he has\r\nbeen strongly defended by him in the Chamber of Peers; M. Guizot, on\r\nthe other hand, calculates that he will accept the London Embassy; to\r\nthis he attaches great importance, although M. de Broglie will not be\r\nable to lend him all the strength of which he will deprive M. Thiers\r\nby a long way; however, he will not weaken him, and that is something.\r\nFailing M. Thiers, Madames de Barante and de Sainte-Aulaire will fight\r\nfor London. There is no doubt that M. de la Redorte will be retired,\r\nas he has cut a poor figure in the Peninsula. There will be many\r\nchanges in the Diplomatic Body. I know that I have been thought of for\r\nan embassy, but I have not yet considered my reply. M. Guizot has\r\ngained nothing from London; something may be obtained from Lord\r\nMelbourne, but nothing from Lord Palmerston, and it is not certain\r\nthat Europe is less inclined to the latter than to the former. The\r\ncondition of the Comte de Paris still causes alarm. Chomel, to whom I\r\nhave spoken, but he is rather a pessimist, has no hope except that the\r\npoor young Prince may live long enough to spare the Duchesse d'Orléans\r\na great grief during her confinement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 8, 1840._--M. d'Entraigues, our Prefect, who has\r\nbeen here since the evening of the day before yesterday, received\r\nyesterday by a courier a telegram sent to him at Tours with news of\r\nthe nomination of the President, the Vice-President and the Committee\r\nof the Chamber of Deputies. The nominations in general are, thank\r\nheaven, favourable to the Cabinet and supported by a good majority.\r\nThis beginning is a trifle consoling. If fear inspires wisdom, so much\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\nI have a letter from the Duc de Noailles, who tells me that there is\r\nno truth in the rumour that his cousin M. Maurice is to enter the\r\nChurch. People are indeed wonderfully clever in inventing and\r\nspreading stories and providing them with so many details as to make\r\none believe what is utterly unfounded. The Duc de Noailles also says:\r\n\"The royal session is said to have been a most mournful ceremony;[138]\r\non the one side was much outcry of obvious meaning, while on the Left\r\nthere was menacing silence; in the middle was the King shedding tears\r\nat a certain passage in his speech. The speech was wanting in dignity,\r\nand a pacific attitude should be more dignified; it was drawn up by\r\nGuizot. The desire for peace was too obvious, and it was not a\r\nsuccess. The Ministry are sure of a majority for some time, but as the\r\nfear of war dies away they will lose it. Syria has been given up as a\r\nbad job by the Government. If the Pasha submits, all will be over; if\r\nhe resists and is attacked in Egypt it is difficult to say how an\r\nexplosion will be avoided here. Thiers said to Guizot on his arrival:\r\n'Now it is your turn. There are only two men in France, yourself and\r\nI; I am the Minister of the revolution, you of the Conservative\r\nmovement; if one is not in power the other must be. We cannot act in\r\nconcert, but we can live upon good terms. I shall put no obstacle in\r\nyour way, and make no attempt to inconvenience you.' None the less he\r\nis already intriguing in the Chamber, and an agitation will be raised\r\nto support him.\"\r\n\r\n  [138] The opening session of the Chamber of Deputies.\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 12, 1840._--The Abbé Dupanloup arrived here\r\nyesterday to consecrate my chapel. The ceremony is to take place\r\nimmediately. Yesterday's post brought news of the confinement of the\r\nDuchesse d'Orléans. I am delighted to hear of the birth of a second\r\nson.[139] Madame de Lieven writes that she is somewhat dissatisfied\r\nwith the beginning which the new Ministry has made.\r\n\r\n  [139] The Duc de Chartres.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 14, 1840._--I had wished the first mass said in\r\nmy chapel to be for the repose of the soul of M. de Talleyrand, but an\r\ninaugural mass cannot be one of mourning. At the ceremony of the day\r\nbefore yesterday, therefore, colours were worn in honour of St.\r\nMartin; yesterday's mass was for the dear departed. The altar is\r\nexactly where his bed used to stand in the room which has been\r\nreplaced by the chapel; the coincidence affected me deeply.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 17, 1840._--M. de Salvandy, who has most\r\nobligingly undertaken to send me a little weekly bulletin, tells me\r\nthat the Diplomatic Body at Paris was almost as keenly excited by the\r\nlast note from Lord Palmerston as the Chamber itself.[140]\r\n\r\n  [140] Lord Palmerston was unwilling to make any concessions.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Count Apponyi has written everywhere pointing out the\r\ndanger of urging France to revolution and to war when she is\r\nattempting to throw off the yoke of anarchy. Lord Granville and Herr\r\nvon Bülow disavow the acts of Lord Palmerston. If he really wished to\r\ndrive France to extremities, it may be believed that neither Austria\r\nnor Prussia would support him. Even Russia seems to have moderated her\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nMy son-in-law writes me from Paris on the 15th: \"The state of affairs\r\nhere seems to me very confused. The transition from revolutionary\r\nprovocation to a demeanour of humility can only be effected amid\r\nuproar in order to put shame out of countenance. To this end everybody\r\nis working. There is a general cry for peace and for the support of\r\nthe former Ministry, and a general outcry against the cowardice and\r\ndegradation of the supreme power, though no one can say exactly what\r\nshould have been done. These indeterminate attacks never produce a\r\nreally embarrassing situation, and as they make an uproar without\r\ndoing any harm, the men against whom they are ineffectually directed\r\nobtain the credit of success. It thus seems generally admitted that\r\nthe Ministry will gain a majority. M. Guizot, for instance, was saying\r\nthe day before yesterday in his _salon_, with the heroic air\r\ncharacteristic of General Guizot: 'Gentlemen, we have just begun the\r\ncampaign; the war will be long and severe, but I hope that we shall\r\ngain the victory.' Though the Chamber desires peace at any price, it\r\nis not compliant. The greater its anxiety, the louder its outcries,\r\nwhich will only end with its unregretted fall. The Address, which is\r\nto be drawn up, people say, by M. Passy or M. de Salvandy, will be\r\nvery bellicose, so much so as to embarrass the Government, although it\r\nhad been decided to create as little trouble as possible on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\"You will have read the answer of Lord Palmerston to the memorandum of\r\nOctober 8. It is an important matter. His disdain for us is obvious,\r\nand is not even disguised by forms or ceremonies. It seems, moreover,\r\nthat this feeling towards us has grown remarkably of late. None the\r\nless the note has caused much embarrassment to M. Guizot, who had told\r\neverybody that since his entry upon office the situation in England\r\nhad entirely changed and that Lord Palmerston was an altered\r\ncharacter. He summed up his views in these words: 'I have peace in my\r\npocket.' This is how he explained Lord Palmerston's note when he was\r\ntalking at the house of the President of the Chamber[141] two days\r\nago: 'Lord Palmerston has a theological mind; he will let no\r\nobjection pass without an answer, so that this note means nothing;\r\nit is merely a question of principle.' M. Dubois, of the\r\nLoire-Inférieure, who is a clever man, and a strong supporter of the\r\nnew Ministry, then took M. Guizot aside and told him that he would be\r\nmaking a great mistake if he repeated that observation in the Chamber.\r\nM. Guizot merely answered by repeating his statement, with which he\r\nwas so delighted that he caused it to be inserted that evening in his\r\nown newspaper, _Le Messager_, in the form of a note at the foot of the\r\nmemorandum, merely suppressing the term 'theological.' At the same\r\ntime the incident has caused some stir, which has not yet died away,\r\nand would make M. Guizot cut a ridiculous figure if things seemed what\r\nthey are in this country. The Ministry proposes to make peace, and\r\neverybody thinks that it will be successful. After that it will\r\nperish, for no obvious reason, in a hurricane; this also seems to be\r\ngenerally believed. Then M. Molé, who now remains in isolation, will\r\ncome to power. He will probably be welcomed by every one, not because\r\nhe is any more popular in the Chamber than he used to be, but because\r\nevery one's energy is exhausted, while the King remains master. The\r\nmatter will depend upon the King, who is ill-disposed to M. Molé at\r\nthis moment, and uttered a remark concerning him which others\r\nattribute to M. Guizot, but which is too good to come from more than\r\none source: 'M. Molé is an excellent looker-on, but is a bad actor.' I\r\nhave an idea that the remark is mine, and that some one stole it from\r\nme five years ago.\r\n\r\n  [141] M. Sauzet.\r\n\r\n\"The Syrian campaign is decidedly favourable to the allies. The\r\nEnglish have displayed much energy. They are inducing the Turks to\r\nstrike hard, and everything is yielding before them; the force of\r\nIbrahim was a myth. At every moment we are expecting the news of the\r\ncapture of Saint-Jean d'Acre, which will be an important success both\r\nhere and there. The saddest part of it is that there is no certainty\r\nconcerning the possible safety of Egypt. Already rumours are present\r\nof a probable revolt at Alexandria, of the assassination of the Pasha\r\nby knife or poison; while you have seen that Lord Palmerston, with his\r\ntheological mind, no longer speaks of the deposition of the Pasha as\r\nhe did three weeks ago. There is no certainty that we shall not yield\r\nupon that point here, and it would be a tremendous concession.\r\n\r\n\"So much for the present. I now turn to the past. Thiers has shrunk in\r\neverybody's eyes: his timidity has been invariably as great as his\r\nimprudence and his superficiality. He dismissed the French Consul at\r\nBeyrout because he wished to serve the Pasha in Syria by calming the\r\nrevolt, and it has never been possible to induce him to send reliable\r\nagents to Syria for the purpose of finding out the exact extent of\r\nIbrahim's power. Hence we have been deceived, and the attitude of\r\nFrance has been guided by unrealised expectations. M. de Broglie\r\nthinks that the King was greatly mistaken in dismissing the Ministry\r\nof M. Thiers, because he would in any case have fallen a victim to\r\npublic ridicule at this moment. This opinion is based upon the fact\r\nthat if one stakes a large sum upon one card and it does not appear\r\nthe ridicule is universal. The person to whom he was speaking on the\r\nmatter yesterday evening thought, on the other hand, that while the\r\nChamber might fear war, it would never have been strong enough to\r\noverthrow the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\"The speech drawn up by Thiers did not propose a new levy of a hundred\r\nand fifty thousand men, but merely wished to anticipate the new levy\r\nby three months, whether for peace or for war, this being the levy\r\nordinarily made in the spring. Moreover, the tone of the speech was\r\nquite moderate; but the fact is that neither he nor the King was\r\nsincere and it was a mere pretext on either side.\r\n\r\n\"There was a Ministerial crisis, of which we had no suspicion, after\r\nthe capture of Beyrout. The Ministry wished to make a demonstration by\r\nsending the fleet to Alexandria, but the King was opposed to this\r\nidea. M. de Broglie was asked to mediate between the two parties, and\r\npatched the matter up, on the theory that it was impossible at that\r\nmoment to appoint a permanent Ministry if those in power resigned upon\r\nsuch a question. He was also opposed to the idea of sending a fleet to\r\nAlexandria, believing that the measure was good in itself, as likely\r\nto cause the allies anxiety while giving them no reason for complaint,\r\nand thinking it a measure which an absolute Government would have\r\nevery right to carry out; but in French practice, on the other hand,\r\nas soon as this measure had been executed, the Press would have driven\r\nthe fleet into action, whether they wished or not, and war would have\r\nbeen the result. All this argument, in any case, is based upon the\r\nfact that this measure or anything like it could only be carried out\r\nby violent means of which the public must hear, such as a resignation,\r\na crisis, and so forth. If the matter had been quietly arranged with\r\nthe private knowledge of the King, the case would have been very\r\ndifferent. Moreover, M. de Broglie is by no means well disposed\r\ntowards the King. He says, however, that it is all a matter of\r\nindifference to him apart from the outward disturbance; that he will\r\nsupport any possible Ministry, that not only will he make no attempt\r\nto overthrow them, but will not even try to shake their stability,\r\nseeing that any of the said Ministries are always more reasonable than\r\nthe Chamber. In short, he says that he is part of the Ministerial\r\nsuite, an avowal which no one had yet ventured to make, and that he\r\ngreatly envies you the prospect of spending his winter in the country.\r\nHis calmness is quite Olympian, though tempered with bitter and\r\npiercing irony.\r\n\r\n\"M. Guizot tells his friends in confidence that he has induced M. de\r\nBroglie to accept the London Embassy. I believe nothing of the kind,\r\nbut I forgot to ask him yesterday evening. M. Molé seemed to me to be\r\nutterly cast down; he is a kind of Jeremiah singing madrigals, and is\r\ngreatly changed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 22, 1840._--Yesterday my son-in-law wrote to his\r\nwife saying that the diplomatic correspondence was read privately\r\nbefore the Commission of the Address in the Chamber of Deputies. It\r\nrepresents M. Thiers as an incompetent and impossible Minister, M.\r\nGuizot as a wise ambassador and a dangerous auxiliary, Lord Palmerston\r\nas a resolute and strong character; it shows that Thiers had\r\nattempted to deceive and blind the eyes of every one and to take them\r\nin, and was simply laughed at, as also was France. He also writes that\r\nthe Duc d'Orléans made his little impromptu speech before the Chamber\r\nof Peers with admirable tact, grace, and nobility.\r\n\r\nAnother note has been received from Lord Palmerston, milder in tone\r\nthan the former, but still raising anxiety upon the Egyptian question.\r\nM. Mounier has been officially sent to London to try and secure some\r\nconcession.\r\n\r\nMy son Valençay writes to me to say that Madame de Nesselrode is at\r\nParis for six weeks; that she will not appear at Court, and therefore\r\nwill not go into society, but will live quietly by herself, and is\r\ndelighted with her idea. I do not know whether Count Nesselrode will\r\nbe equally delighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 23, 1840._--My son-in-law writes that M.\r\nWalewski, who had been sent to Egypt as an envoy to Ibrahim, thought\r\nthat he was still writing despatches for the Ministry of March 1, and\r\nhad announced that in spite of all his efforts he could not induce\r\nIbrahim to pass the Taurus. This despatch seems to be causing a great\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 24, 1840._--My son-in-law writes: \"There is a\r\nvague rumour that some arrangement will be made in Syria and Egypt\r\nwhich will not be the ruin of the Pasha. This is in consequence of his\r\ncomplete submission to the Powers, but we shall boast of it here, and\r\nthe majority will appear to believe it. For some time past there have\r\nbeen terrible arguments between Thiers and Guizot, face to face, and\r\nthe worst of it is for them both that the bystanders support one of\r\nthem against the other; consequently they will dig the pit in which\r\nthey will both fall. Thiers is almost entirely ruined, and Guizot will\r\nbe in the spring after he has refused, as he will, to pave the way for\r\nM. Molé, who will certainly enter upon office if the King wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 25, 1840._--I have been reading with admiration\r\nthe noble farewell of Queen Christina to the Spanish nation.[142] It\r\nseems to belong to another time and to an age when there was still\r\nsomething divine in the language of kings. This touching manifesto is\r\nsaid to have been drawn up by Señor de Offalia, who has also left\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n  [142] This manifesto of Queen Christina to the Spanish nation\r\n  will be found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 26, 1840._--What a dreadful speech M. Dupin has\r\nmade! I am certainly the most peaceful creature in France, but I\r\ncannot understand how any one can descend to such depths. A descent so\r\nuseless, so tactless, and so clumsy that it really seems as if he were\r\ntrying to win a wager.\r\n\r\nThe wife of the Marshal d'Albuféra tells me that the Comtesse de\r\nNesselrode met M. Thiers at her house, and that he put out all his\r\nefforts to charm the Comtesse. Madame de Nesselrode takes such sudden\r\nfancies that she might get excited even over M. Thiers.\r\n\r\nThe English have captured Saint-Jean d'Acre. Their little Queen has\r\nbeen confined of a daughter.[143]\r\n\r\n  [143] Victoria, Crown Princess of Great Britain and Ireland, was\r\n  born on November 21, 1840. By her marriage with Prince Frederick\r\n  William of Prussia she afterwards became Empress of Germany. She\r\n  was the mother of the Emperor William II.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 28, 1840._--The Duc de Noailles writes: \"You\r\nwill see by reading the reports of yesterday's session in the Chamber\r\nof Deputies the excitement which pervaded the assembly. This\r\nestablishes and confirms peace with disgrace. These events will be a\r\nheavy burden upon the future of the present dynasty. I think that the\r\nconsequence at home will be a kind of reform in the Chamber, which\r\nwill produce a dissolution, and also another Chamber, in which we\r\nshall be forced to endure a Left Ministry led by Thiers.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Mollien writes to me: \"Queen Christina is pretty; her\r\ncomplexion is superb, her skin fine and white; she has a gentle look\r\nand a clever and gracious smile, but those who wish to think her\r\ncharming must look no lower than her head; in full detail she is\r\nalmost a monstrosity, quite as much as her sister the Infanta. She\r\ncame to France unattended by any of her ladies, though the newspapers\r\nare pleased to speak of some Doña, who, if she does exist, is probably\r\nnothing but a chambermaid. At Paris there are some Spanish ladies who\r\nwill perform some kind of attendance upon her; at the present moment\r\nthe Duchess of Berwick is so acting. Her suite is composed of only two\r\nmen, who are both young; one especially, the Count of Raquena, does\r\nnot seem to be more than twenty. He is a little man with fair\r\nmoustaches, and looks like a comedy lieutenant. I do not know when the\r\nQueen will start. She says she is very happy here. I am afraid she\r\nwill be too happy and stay too long. These royal visits always cause a\r\ncertain amount of disturbance, which soon wearies the inhabitants of\r\nthe Tuileries. She dines there every day, though she is staying in the\r\nroyal palace. Her interview with her sister was very cold, but it\r\npassed off without any scene, and nothing more was expected.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse de Bauffremont sent me news of the marriage of her\r\ngrandson with the second Mlle. d'Aubusson; the eldest daughter is\r\nmarrying Prince Marc de Beauvau. Gontran's marriage will not take\r\nplace for a year, as the young lady is only fifteen; she will be\r\nenormously rich. Her mother is Mlle. de Boissy. Her father has been\r\nill for ten years, and his property is in the hands of executors.\r\nGontran is not yet nineteen, and a very handsome young fellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 29, 1840._--The day before yesterday the\r\n_Journal des Débats_ was very curiously filled with the speeches of M.\r\nPassy and M. Guizot, throughout which M. Thiers must have felt himself\r\nsomewhat uneasy. On the whole these explanations are not very\r\ncreditable to the cleverness of any one except to the skill and the\r\ndignified tenacity of Lord Palmerston. It appears to me that all the\r\nFrench actors have emerged from the business somewhat bespattered,\r\nincluding even the little Bourqueney.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, November 30, 1840._--The discussions in the Chamber have\r\ninduced me to read the newspaper through, and I am not sorry, for it\r\nis a curious drama, though one in which the situation is more\r\ninteresting than the people, whose appearance becomes ever more\r\nthreadbare as they adopt the most certain means of degradation, want\r\nof straightforwardness, simplicity, and truth in their dealings.\r\nMoreover, this discussion is like the Day of Judgment; whether they\r\nlike it or not, every one is stripped of his fine feathers, and truth\r\nis forced to the forefront. Hitherto M. Villemain seems to me to speak\r\nthe truth in the most suitable and striking language, but he is only\r\nin a position to speak for one side of the matter, though this, in my\r\nopinion, is the side to which blame chiefly attaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 1, 1840._--The Duc de Noailles tells me: \"I had\r\na long talk yesterday with M. Guizot, and I told him that recent\r\nevents and all that discussion has brought forth will considerably\r\ncomplicate the present situation for a long time. He thinks, on the\r\ncontrary, that the difficulties are only momentary, and that public\r\nfeeling upon this question will be as short-lived as it was upon the\r\nPolish war eight years ago.[144] I also had a long talk with Berryer\r\nconcerning his speech; he is thinking it over, and has some good\r\nideas; his conclusion will probably give the Ministry a set-back. He\r\nwill say that war is obviously impossible at this moment, but that\r\npeace as formulated by the Ministry is not acceptable to the Chamber,\r\nand that the Address should be referred to a new commission. Odilon\r\nBarrot and M. Dufaure have already proposed this idea, which might\r\neasily become popular. I also met Thiers at the Chamber, and walked\r\nabout for ten minutes with him. I reminded him that I had already\r\nprophesied the events that have come to pass, because in this great\r\nbusiness nothing could be done without alliances, while France was\r\nunited to an ally who was opposed to her interests and obviously\r\nlikely to abandon her. He replied that France even alone could have\r\nprevented action, at the expense, however, of great energy and a\r\nlarge display of force. He throws the whole responsibility upon the\r\nKing; he says that it is a case of inertia upon the throne, and that\r\nwith inertia in high places and also naturally ingrained in the\r\nnation, nothing can be done; that if the Duc d'Orléans had been King\r\nthe course of events would have been different; that he would perhaps\r\nhave perished, but have perished with dignity, and would not have left\r\nFrance in her present state of humiliation and hopelessness, in which\r\nshe will long continue. In any case, he is entirely devoted to the\r\nLeft, and M. Odilon Barrot drew the bonds tighter yesterday. Madame de\r\nLieven is, I think, really attached to Guizot, for she no longer goes\r\nto the sessions of the Chamber, and confines herself to asking news of\r\nthem with much anxiety.\"\r\n\r\n  [144] A conflict arising from the revolution of July 1830 broke\r\n  out in Poland, where the Russians and the insurgents fought\r\n  terrible battles under the walls of Warsaw. On September 7, 1831,\r\n  Warsaw was obliged to capitulate in spite of a desperate\r\n  resistance, and the event caused great grief and sympathy\r\n  throughout France. An attempt was made to begin a revolt in Paris\r\n  and to overthrow the Ministry of Casimir-Perier, who had\r\n  recognised the impossibility of supporting Poland.\r\n\r\nI now come to an extract from a letter from the Princesse de Lieven\r\nherself: \"Thiers seems to have decided that he will no longer serve\r\nthe King. He says that he will wait for the Duc d'Orléans. Syria is\r\nlost for the Pasha. It is hoped and believed that he will yield to the\r\nsummons of the English Admiral Stopford. I suppose that the French\r\nGovernment is advising him to do so; then the matter will be concluded\r\nwith no glory for France, we must admit, and with every credit to Lord\r\nPalmerston. There are many people who strongly object to this latter\r\nresult. The Ministers here expect a decent majority of fifty or sixty\r\nin favour of the Address, after which they will get on as well as they\r\ncan. M. Guizot seems very tired, but is full of courage. At Vienna\r\npeople are delighted with the change of Ministry and full of\r\nconfidence in the present Ministers. I have no news of public opinion\r\nas yet from St. Petersburg. I am a little curious to hear what our\r\nRussian public will say about this great affair which has been settled\r\nwithout any active interference on the part of us Russians; it will\r\ncause us some astonishment. You will probably ask me whether there is\r\na Russian public; the question is not unreasonable, but there is one,\r\nas far as the East is concerned. When I was at London as Ambassadress\r\nI ventured to call Turkey our Portugal; my own Court much appreciated\r\nthe epigram, but the English did not. No haste is shown here to\r\nnominate a London Ambassador; I think they would prefer the Egyptian\r\nbusiness to be settled first. We shall certainly have to wait until\r\nthe middle of December. Madame de Flahaut does not know what to do,\r\ntorn as she is by the whims and fancies which are natural to her and\r\nthe extreme desire of her husband for a diplomatic post. The King\r\ngreatly wished his ambassadors to call upon Queen Christina in a body;\r\nmany of them felt scruples upon the point, but at length they decided\r\nto go, regarding her as nothing more than the widow of Ferdinand VII.,\r\nand in fact she is nothing more now. The Queen of England is said to\r\nhave had a very easy confinement, and will probably have seventeen\r\nchildren like her grandmother. Madame de Nesselrode lives at the\r\nChamber of Deputies; she is in love with Thiers, and has joined the\r\nOpposition extremists; she is finding life quite pleasant here. I see\r\nvery little of her as her time is taken up with the debates in the\r\nChamber and with theatres. My ambassador is crushed beneath the weight\r\nof all the great Russian ladies who are grouped together in Paris. I\r\nam sorry for him, for I can believe that it is entirely tiresome.\"\r\n\r\nI would have been ready to make a bet that Madame de Nesselrode would\r\nconceive a violent fancy for Thiers, if it were only to rival Madame\r\nde Lieven's fancy for Guizot. After reading the speech of M. Barrot\r\nand the series of invectives which he aimed directly at Guizot, I\r\nbegan to wonder yesterday how such things could be said and heard\r\nwithout leading to further explanations by means of swords and\r\npistols.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 3, 1840._--The following are the most important\r\npassages from the bulletin sent by M. de Salvandy, under date December\r\n1, before and during the session of the Chamber. He says: \"Have you\r\nheard at Rochecotte a pleasant epigram by Garnier Pagès, who is to\r\nspeak to-day? 'I would strip them both, and their ugliness would then\r\nbe obvious.' This epigram very well sums up the situation. M. Thiers\r\nretains his revolutionary attitude, but that is all; he remains\r\nincompetent to many and impossible to all. M. Guizot is far from\r\nhaving gained all that M. Thiers has lost. He has immense talent,\r\nadmirable strength of mind in times of storm, the gift of overaweing\r\nall hostile revolts in the Assembly, and the art of raising the minds\r\nof his audience to consider questions with him upon a higher plane and\r\nfrom a wider point of view; these are his special advantages, though\r\nhe has never made the best of them. Yet he grows stronger, though he\r\nraises no defences, and rests his power upon the majority without\r\npermanently establishing it. The soil declines to be cultivated. M.\r\nThiers is like a mistress who is asked only to behave herself;\r\nanything will be permitted to him, and his reputation will not suffer.\r\nM. Guizot is the woman of strict morals who has been a failure and is\r\nblamed for everything. This struggle between the Ambassador and the\r\nMinister, in spite of attempts to soften it, does harm to the Chamber\r\nand to public opinion. He is not even pardoned for his firm resolve to\r\nabandon the principles of the Coalition, as if people would have\r\npreferred him faithful to infidelity personified. The speech of\r\nDufaure seems to many people a manifesto intervening between the\r\nCabinet and M. Thiers; the action of Passy and Dupin in this direction\r\nhas caused much anxiety. My name is coupled with this movement because\r\nno one imagines that Ministers in retirement are not displeased to be\r\nemployed. M. Molé is represented as hovering above all, although he\r\nhas no connection with the sphere in which the Ministry of May 12\r\npredominates, for that Ministry, I think, regards it as a point of\r\nhonour to preserve its consistency by holding aloof from M. Molé, as\r\nJaubert thinks to remain consistent by retaining his seat among the\r\nothers, whom he wounds and annoys by his constant outcries against the\r\nKing and his enthusiasm for M. Barrot. Such is our position. The\r\nground seems to be crumbling beneath us. Alas for our country, which\r\nshould be strong and cannot be governed! Our Chamber is really the\r\nOEil de Bœuf of the democracy.[145] Favourites, male and female,\r\ndisturb everything by their intrigues, and spend the time in\r\noverthrowing one another, with the result that ruin is universal. I am\r\ngoing to the Chamber, where MM. de Lamartine and Berryer will cross\r\nswords, and shall close this letter there.\r\n\r\n  [145] An allusion to the OEil de Bœuf in the castle of\r\n  Versailles, where Court intrigues were hatched.\r\n\r\n\"_P.S._--Berryer has just spoken, a clever, brilliant, and perfidious\r\nspeech. He has protected Thiers by going straightway to the Tuileries.\r\nThere he has displayed his thunderbolts and launched anathemas against\r\nM. Guizot the Ambassador, which have been definitely applauded three\r\ntimes by the Assembly. M. de Lamartine is now rising to reply.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 4, 1840._--The speech of M. Berryer shows the\r\nstate of the country from one point of view and that of M. de\r\nLamartine from another. These two speeches seem to me to be the most\r\nbrilliant effort on the part of one orator and the most lofty on the\r\npart of the other that the whole discussion upon the Address has\r\nproduced. M. de Lamartine, for whom in general I have but a moderate\r\nliking, greatly pleased me with his reply which seems to be wise, well\r\nsupported by facts, well thought out, and well delivered, with\r\nexcellent touches of straightforward feeling, which had its effect\r\nupon the Assembly.\r\n\r\nWe are assured that the mission of M. Mounier to London is intended to\r\nsecure the help of England for the proposal of a marriage between the\r\ninnocent Isabella with her cousin Carlos, Prince of Asturias.\r\n\r\nThe remains of Napoleon have now been brought to Cherbourg. In Paris\r\nno preparations are said to have yet been made for this ceremony,\r\nwhich in my opinion will be very ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 5, 1840._--Yesterday I had a letter from M.\r\nRoyer Collard, from which the following is a striking extract: \"A week\r\nago, madame, I was a prisoner in the Chamber, following a great debate\r\nupon the Address with close interest. The audience have alternately\r\nexpressed dissatisfaction with the chief actors, but not from the same\r\npoint of view. The faults of Thiers are those of the Minister, and the\r\nfaults of Guizot those of the man. I do not know whether you noticed\r\nin the newspapers that I was led to make a declaration in Guizot's\r\nfavour which he greatly needed, as he was in a difficulty, for no one\r\nbelieved a word of what he was saying, although he spoke the truth.\r\nThe next day he came over to my place to thank me, boldly crossing the\r\nwhole Chamber for the purpose. I did not accept his thanks, and told\r\nhim that I had done nothing for him, but had been thinking only of\r\nmyself. He then buttonholed me in a corridor. I maintained a distant\r\nattitude and refused to converse. The difference between the two men\r\nis that Providence has not granted Thiers the power of distinguishing\r\nbetween good and evil; Guizot has this power, but will not use it. He\r\nis therefore the more guilty, but not, perhaps, the more dangerous. If\r\none could regard any decision of to-day as irrevocable, I should say\r\nthat they are both utterly ruined. I wish they were, but I am not sure\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\nMy son-in-law hears that the effect of Berryer's speech has been\r\ntremendous. It seems to have dealt a death-blow to M. Guizot, and a\r\nvigorous thrust in higher quarters. The Carlists are overjoyed. I am\r\ninclined to think that they regard the event as more important than it\r\nreally is. Thiers loudly praises Berryer, and tells any one who will\r\nlisten to him that in point of art nothing is superior to it, and that\r\nin 1789 no better performance was achieved.\r\n\r\nThe Princesse de Lieven, to whom some one related the thrust that\r\nGuizot had received, answered that he had not been hit.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the ceremony in honour of the remains of Napoleon will\r\ntake place on the 15th of this month. How opportunely his ghost\r\narrives!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 6, 1840._--I hear from a correspondent: \"I have\r\nno certain confirmation of Demidoff's death, but I know from a sure\r\nsource that he had a very unpleasant journey to Rome, and afterwards\r\nsome harassing interviews with the Cardinal's Secretary of State and\r\nwith the Russian Minister, after which he was obliged to leave the\r\nPapal States, in accordance with orders. The consequent excitement\r\nthen caused him one of his worst attacks. Apparently he told a Greek\r\npriest that his children would all be brought up in the Greek\r\nreligion, while he told the Catholic authorities that they would be\r\nbrought up as Catholics. Moreover, he said, with his usual assurance,\r\nthat with money anything could be gained from the Court of Rome, and\r\nthat he had sent a hundred thousand francs to the Pope for the\r\ndispensations which he has procured. Cardinal Lambruschini, indignant\r\nat this story, inserted an article in the _Gazette romaine_, which has\r\nbeen circulated everywhere, and which denies the statement, affirming\r\nvery positively that M. Demidoff only paid ninety francs for his\r\ndispensations--namely, the cost of their postage. The Russian Minister\r\nthen refused to intercede with the Roman Court on behalf of Demidoff.\r\nDemidoff abused him, in consequence, and after all this fine\r\nperformance was obliged to leave Rome; and if he is not dead with fury\r\nhe is none the less in an awkward position.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 7, 1840._--The chief news of the day is the\r\nrejection of M. Odilon Barrot's amendment by a majority of more than a\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nOne or two clever epigrams current at Paris are these: MM. Jaubert and\r\nDuvergier de Hauranne--in short, the Doctrinaire section that has gone\r\nover to the Left--are known as the unrestrained schismatics from the\r\nDoctrine. In other circles partisans of Mgr. Affre, the Archbishop of\r\nParis, are known as the _affreux_ (frightful). People must have their\r\njoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 9, 1840._--Madame Mollien informs me that, as\r\nthe Address is now voted, men's minds are beginning to turn to the\r\nceremony of the Remains, as the people of Paris call it. The expenses\r\nof the ceremony will amount to a million; thousands of workmen are\r\nbusy day and night with preparations, and thousands of loafers spend\r\ntheir time looking on until nightfall. What foolishness all this\r\ncomedy is, coming at such a time and in such circumstances! I think\r\nthat the rock of St. Helena would have been a more fitting sepulchre,\r\nand perhaps a safer resting-place, than Paris, with its storms and\r\nrevolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 10, 1840._--M. Raullin writes to say that the\r\nStock Exchange gambling was discussed at the session of the Chamber,\r\nand M. Thiers actually wept. He also says that the hatred and acrimony\r\nwhich embroil all these people is quite unparalleled, and that it is\r\nimpossible to talk with any one unless you share their particular form\r\nof madness. Thiers wished to fight a duel with M. de Givré, which was\r\nprevented by Rémusat. M. Jaubert is also slightly infected by the\r\ndisease. Madame Dosne is in bed, a result of the effects of the last\r\nsession of the Chamber at which she was present. The revelations made\r\nupon the subject of the Stock Exchange gambling have overwhelmed her.\r\n\r\nM. de Saint-Aulaire writes from Vienna saying that he is going to\r\nstand for election to the French Academy; he displays great disgust\r\nwith public affairs, and there is every probability that this feeling\r\nwill become general.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 13, 1840._--Yesterday, as my solitude was more\r\ncomplete than usual, I returned, as I constantly do, to my\r\nrecollections of the past. It occurred to me to write a few lines upon\r\ncertain mental characteristics of M. de Talleyrand, as follows:\r\n\r\nHis mind was strong, but his conscience was weak, for it needed\r\nenlightenment. The age in which he lived, his education, and the\r\nposition into which he was forced were all incompatible with that\r\nreflection which can illuminate the soul. His natural want of\r\nsensitiveness also disinclined him for the serious work of\r\nself-examination and left him in darkness. Thus his unusual mental\r\npowers were entirely devoted to political interests. He was swept away\r\nby the terrible movement of his age, and threw the whole of his\r\nenergies into it. If stress was required his energy was great; he\r\ncould live without repose and rest, and deprived others of it as well\r\nas himself, but when he had attained his object he would relapse into\r\na lengthy indifference, upon which he cleverly prevented any\r\nencroachment. He could be idle so gracefully that no one could disturb\r\nhim without self-reproach, but he had a keen and accurate eye for a\r\nsituation and a penetrating perception of its possibilities, while his\r\nmind was tempered with excellent common sense. When he took action he\r\nworked but slowly at first, but with rapidity and precipitation as the\r\ncrisis approached. The attitude of carelessness, which he abandoned as\r\nlittle as possible, was most disastrous to him in private life, for he\r\ncarried it to excess. His door was always open, his rooms were\r\nconstantly invaded, while his indifference to the reliability and\r\nmoral worth of the men who made their way to him was deplorable. At\r\nthe same time he saw everything through his half-closed eyes, but he\r\ntook little trouble to judge men, and even less to avoid those of whom\r\nhe thought least. In conversation, if he felt no need of opposition,\r\nhe allowed people to talk or act as they would, but if he felt himself\r\nattacked he was immediately aroused, and the answer was a crushing\r\nblow; he overthrew his opponent on the spot, though he never retained\r\nany bitterness of feeling for him. He speedily relapsed into his\r\nindifference, and as easily forgot an impropriety as he sincerely\r\npardoned an insult. In any case, he was rarely called upon to defend\r\nhimself. His dignity was natural and simple, so well protected by his\r\nreputation, his great past, and by the apparent indolence which was\r\nknown to be only a mask, that I have rarely seen even the worst\r\ncharacters venture to show their true nature with him. I have often\r\nheard him say with real satisfaction: \"I was a Minister under the\r\nDirectory; all the hobnailed boots of the Revolution have tramped\r\nthrough my room, but no one ever ventured upon familiarity with me.\"\r\nHe spoke the truth; even his nearest and dearest addressed him only\r\nwith respectful deference. I am, moreover, convinced that his\r\noverpowering dignity was supported by a natural characteristic which\r\ncould be felt even beneath his indolence. This was a cool courage and\r\npresence of mind, a bold temperament and instinctive bravery which\r\ninspires an irresistible taste for danger in any form, which makes\r\nrisk attractive and hazard delightful. Beneath the nobility of his\r\nfeatures, the slowness of his movements, and his luxurious habits\r\nthere was a depth of audacious boldness which sometimes peeped out,\r\nrevealed a wholly different order of capacities, and made him by\r\nforce of contrast one of the most original and most attractive\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 14, 1840._--Among the letters which I received\r\nyesterday I had one from Berlin from M. Bresson, who says: \"Frankfort\r\nis by no means a misfortune for Herr von Bülow; he has long desired it\r\nfor private reasons; the post ranks as at least equal to that of\r\nLondon. The strange outcome of Eastern events has restored the credit\r\nof those responsible for the negotiations. The men who made the\r\nloudest outcry against Bülow are to-day warmest in his praises. We are\r\nso indulgent to those who show daring that I am myself inclined to\r\nregard them as correct. Humboldt has no political influence over the\r\nKing of Prussia; no one has any as yet, and it is impossible to say\r\nexactly at present what attitude he will adopt. Some recent\r\nnominations of members of the Pietists have slightly damaged his\r\npopularity; his liking for them is not shared by the country. Lord\r\nWilliam Russell extends the area of his amusements more and more; he\r\nis now divided between three ladies, one of whom attracts him with\r\nsome frequency to Mecklenburg. Prince Wittgenstein no longer takes any\r\nshare in public business; he has had several attacks and will not live\r\nlong. I need not tell you what I felt concerning the discussion upon\r\nthe Address; existing conditions make life abroad most unpleasant. Is\r\nit true that Flahaut is going to Vienna to replace Saint-Aulaire? If\r\nso, I shall certainly be left here. The wind of favour does not blow\r\nin my direction. A certain street and house very well known to you are\r\nnot so well disposed to me as they were.\" This last passage alludes to\r\nTalleyrand's residence in the Rue Saint-Florentin, where Madame de\r\nLieven now lives.\r\n\r\nI am informed of the death of the young Marie de La Rochefoucauld,\r\ndaughter of Sosthène and granddaughter of the Duchesse Mathieu de\r\nMontmorency. This poor woman has survived her contemporaries, her\r\nchildren, and her grandchildren. Heaven has severely tried the high\r\ncourage and profound faith with which she is endowed.\r\n\r\nI am also informed that at the much-talked-of ceremony of the Remains\r\nthe Queen and the Princesses will be in mourning as for Louis XVIII.\r\nIt seems that everybody is mad; the newspapers only speak of the\r\nfuneral, or rather of the triumphal procession and of the religious\r\nhonours which will everywhere be paid to the remains of Napoleon.\r\nAfter all, Napoleon, twice in forty years, will have performed the\r\nsame service for the French. He will have reconciled them to religion,\r\nfor it seems that it is quite curious to see the crowds upon their\r\nknees surrounding the clergy who bless these remains. Curious, too, is\r\nthe general wish that their hero should have the benediction of the\r\nChurch. Strange are the people who accept order personified in the\r\nmidst of actual anarchy for the sake of a revolutionary idea, for it\r\nseems clear to me that there is no other motive for all these honours,\r\nwhich are paid, not to the legislator, but to the usurper and to the\r\nconqueror.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 15, 1840._--Yesterday I had some news from\r\nMadame de Lieven, the chief points of which I will copy: \"Egypt is now\r\ndone for. Napier was rather violent, contrary to his instructions, but\r\nat the same time he has succeeded. Napier wished to show his learning,\r\nand is asking the Pasha to restore the reign of the Ptolemys, a\r\nstrange position for a vassal, but there it is. At Constantinople the\r\nprinciple of hereditary succession will be recognised for his family,\r\nand he will afterwards surrender the fleet. At London delight is great\r\nand Lord Palmerston cannot contain himself. Relations between the two\r\ncountries remain very strained; it is not war, but cannot be called\r\npeace. The discussion upon the Address has been forgotten in view of\r\nthe funeral of Napoleon; this will be a superb ceremony, and I hope it\r\nwill be nothing else.\r\n\r\n\"Queen Christina has gone, after making a conquest of your King. She\r\nwill go to Rome, but not to Naples, where her daughter has not been\r\nrecognised. The whole of Russian female society is here; five of the\r\npalace ladies are at Paris and only four left at St. Petersburg. The\r\nambassadors have declared that they will not be present at the\r\nfuneral. Most of them have adopted this idea independently, but Lord\r\nGranville asked for instructions; after some hesitation he was told\r\nto do as the others did. The confinement of the Queen of England was\r\nperfectly easy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 17, 1840._--We have not yet heard how the\r\nfuneral passed off at Paris the day before yesterday. Some uneasiness\r\nprevailed. The Duchesse de Montmorency told me: \"There is an idea of\r\nattacking the English Embassy and wrecking the house. Some soldiers\r\nhave been placed within the residence and Lady Granville has moved. It\r\nis estimated that eight hundred thousand people will be on foot. My\r\nchildren went to the Pecq, and thought that everything was very well\r\nconducted; there was a general silence when the boat came in, and all\r\nheads were bared. General Bertrand was on the right of the coffin,\r\nGeneral Gourgaud on the left, M. de Chabot before it, and the Prince\r\nof Joinville went to and fro giving orders and had all the decorations\r\nremoved which were not religious. The priests were there with\r\nsurplices and many candles, and there was nothing worldly or\r\nmythological.\"\r\n\r\nThe newspapers speak of great excitement. I shall be delighted when\r\nthe evening post tells us how it has all gone off. I have written to\r\nsecure my grandson Boson a view of the ceremony. Foolish, incoherent,\r\ncontradictory, and ridiculous as it may be, still the solemn arrival\r\nof the coffin brought back from St. Helena will be very imposing, and\r\nhe will be glad one day to have seen it. Unfortunately at his age he\r\nwill be merely impressed, and will be unable to draw any of the\r\nstrange conclusions which the sight should inspire--the complete\r\nforgetfulness of the oppression and the universal maledictions with\r\nwhich Europe resounded twenty-six years ago; to-day nothing remains\r\nbut the recollections of Napoleon's victories, which make his memory\r\nso popular. Paris, proclaiming her eager love of liberty, and France,\r\nhumiliated before the foreigner, are doing their utmost to honour the\r\nman who did most to reduce them to servitude and was the most terrible\r\nof conquerors.\r\n\r\nIn the newspapers we have read a description of the decorations in the\r\nChamps Elysées, with the row of kings and great men. The great Condé\r\nat least should not have found a place among them. Condé offering a\r\ncrown to his grandson's assassin! What I think should be fine is the\r\nhearse. I like the idea of Napoleon brought back to France on a\r\nbuckler....\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 18, 1840._--Yesterday we awaited the post most\r\nanxiously, and by some fatality the box was broken and we had to go to\r\nbed without letters. Fortunately my son Dino, who had been at Tours,\r\nbrought back a copy of a telegram received by the Prefect which said\r\nthat everything went off very well, apart from a small demonstration\r\nby some fifty men in blouses, who tried to break through the lines in\r\nthe Place Louis XV., but were driven back.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 19, 1840._--At last our letters have come.\r\nMadame Mollien, who was at the Church of the Invalides in the King's\r\nsuite, says: \"This ceremony was just as unpopular in the position\r\nwhere I was placed as it was popular in the streets of Paris. For\r\nevery reason people are delighted that yesterday is over. Before\r\nentering the church we met in a kind of room, or rather chapel without\r\nan altar, which had already been used for the same purpose at the\r\nfuneral of the victims of Fieschi. The royal family, the Chancellor,\r\nthe Ministers, the Households, and even the tutors, waited together\r\nfor two hours. The time was chiefly spent in speculation upon the\r\nprogress of the procession and in attempts to derive some heat from\r\ntwo enormous fireplaces that had been hastily constructed and avoid\r\nthe volumes of smoke which they belched into the room. Recollections\r\nof the Emperor were conspicuous by their absence; people talked of any\r\nsubject except that. The Chancellor[146] was noticeable for his\r\ncheerfulness and his comical outbursts against the smoke. The Queen\r\nwas feverish, but nothing could prevent her from accompanying the\r\nKing, and she went home from the Invalides really ill. I can tell you\r\nnothing of the scene within the church. I was so shut in on my stand\r\nthat I saw nothing, and could hardly hear the beautiful mass by\r\nMozart, divinely sung.\"\r\n\r\n  [146] The Duc Pasquier.\r\n\r\nThe following is another account: \"The hearse, in my opinion, was\r\nreally admirable; nothing could be more magnificent and imposing; the\r\ndepartmental standards borne by subalterns made an excellent effect,\r\nand the trumpets playing a simple funeral march in unison impressed me\r\ndeeply. I liked, too, the five hundred sailors from _La Belle Poule_,\r\nwhose austere appearance contrasted with the general splendour; but a\r\nridiculous effect was produced by the old costumes of the Empire,\r\nwhich looked as though they had been brought out from Franconi's. The\r\nprogress of the hearse was not followed sufficiently closely by the\r\ncrowd, so that the people rushed along in too noisy a fashion. There\r\nwere some unpleasant shouts of 'Down with Guizot!' 'Death to the men\r\nof Ghent!' Some red flags were also seen, and the _Marseillaise_ was\r\nheard once or twice, but these attempts were immediately checked. The\r\nPrince de Joinville has grown brown and thin, but he is handsome and\r\nlooked very well. He was warmly welcomed throughout the procession\r\nyesterday.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duchesse d'Albuféra saw the procession pass from Madame de\r\nFlahaut's house, who had invited the old ladies who had figured under\r\nthe Empire, the wife of Marshal Ney, the Duchesse de Rovigo, &c., with\r\na number of modern society figures or strangers. The eighty thousand\r\ntroops are said to have given the ceremony the aspect of a review\r\nrather than of a funeral. The Marshal's wife reasonably disliked the\r\nattitude of the people, which was neither religious nor impressive nor\r\nrespectful.\r\n\r\nI have also a letter from M. Royer Collard, who says nothing about the\r\nceremony, at which he was not present; but in answer to a statement of\r\nmine, expressing my astonishment at his silence concerning Berryer's\r\nspeech, he says: \"If I were to give you my plain opinion of the\r\nprotagonists in the debate upon the Address, I should be tempted to\r\nuse very violent language. M. Berryer is supporting the cause of good\r\nby evil methods, an imaginary good by what is certainly wrong, and the\r\ncause of order by means of confusion. He has the outward graces of an\r\norator, but not the essential points. He makes no impression upon\r\nmen's minds, and nothing will be left to him but his name. You ask my\r\nopinion of M. de Tocqueville. He has a fund of honest motives which is\r\nnot adequate for his purposes, and which he imprudently expends, but\r\nsome remnants of which will always be left to him. I am afraid that in\r\nhis anxiety to succeed he will wander into impossible paths by an\r\nattempt to reconcile irreconcilable elements. He extends both hands\r\nsimultaneously, the right hand in welcome to the left, and the left\r\nhand to ourselves, and regrets that he has not a third hand behind him\r\nwhich he could offer unseen. He proposes to present himself for\r\nelection to the French Academy in place of M. de Bonald. My first vote\r\nis promised to Ballanche, but he will have my second. His\r\nopponents--for there is an opposition--say that his literary success\r\nhas already brought him into the Institute, the Chamber, and will give\r\nhim an armchair at Barrot's house, and that he can therefore wait.\"\r\nOur hermit of the Rue d'Enfer displays a considerable spice of\r\nmalignity beneath his excellent qualities. The notion of a third hand\r\nis very persuasive, a capital metaphor, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 20, 1840._--The Duc de Noailles also sends me a\r\nsmall account of the funeral, and says that the crowd of onlookers\r\nwatched the procession going by almost as if it were that of the\r\nBœuf-Gras, and that the people in the church were entirely absorbed\r\nby the question of the cold and the business of wrapping themselves\r\nup; that the service was confused and that the social spectacle was\r\nthe main point in everybody's mind. The obvious inference seems to me\r\nto be that there are no more Bonapartists in France. The fact is that\r\nthere is nothing in this country except newspaper articles.\r\n\r\nMy son-in-law is told that a proposal is to be brought forward in the\r\nChamber to efface the figure of Henry IV. from the star of the Legion\r\nof Honour and to replace it by the effigy of Napoleon. As a matter of\r\nfact there will be nothing more extraordinary in destroying the image\r\nof one's ancestor than in staining one's coat of arms.[147]\r\n\r\n  [147] An allusion to the deed to which Louis-Philippe placed his\r\n  signature in February 1831, the day after the Archbishop's\r\n  residence was destroyed and Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois was\r\n  plundered. M. Laffitte, who was too inclined to consider\r\n  resistance to sedition impossible, induced the Sovereign to\r\n  publish the following decree: \"In future the State seal will\r\n  represent an open book, bearing these words, 'Charter of 1830,'\r\n  surmounted by a closed crown with a sceptre and a hand of justice\r\n  in saltire, and tricolour flags behind the escutcheon, with\r\n  inscription, 'Louis-Philippe, King of the French.'\" Thus it was\r\n  that the lilies disappeared which had hitherto been represented\r\n  upon the State seal throughout the realm.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 23, 1840._--I have a letter from M. de Salvandy,\r\nof which the following are the essential points: \"A note has arrived\r\nfrom Lord Palmerston stating that Napier's convention has been\r\nratified, and guaranteeing the fact in the name of England.\r\n\r\n\"M. Thiers will be president of the Commission concerning the\r\nfortifications, and will report their proceedings to the Chamber; thus\r\nhe will have the Cabinet on the stool of repentance and be able to\r\nkeep the Chamber in check. It thus appears that M. Thiers is by no\r\nmeans so weak as was thought, and that M. Guizot's position is by no\r\nmeans assured. In this general state of uncertainty anything is\r\npossible. The credit of the Chamber is shaken by it within, and a\r\nEuropean disturbance may very well follow. Austria has presented a\r\nvery moderate note upon the question of armaments, but Germany will\r\nnot disarm.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Salvandy says the same as my other correspondents with regard to\r\nthe funeral. He complains that there was too much gold, which was to\r\nbe seen in every possible position. Apparently those who arranged the\r\nceremony thought that it was the best means of representing glory. He\r\nalso said that nothing could be less religious than the religious\r\nceremony. This is natural when one has an archbishop who cannot walk\r\nor pray or use incense. I notice in the _Moniteur_ a phrase which is\r\nquite admirable: \"The _De Profundis_ was sung by Duprez and the prayer\r\nby the Archbishop.\"\r\n\r\nM. de Salvandy says that during the ceremony M. Thiers was remarkably\r\nhopeful at the outset, very angry at the conclusion, and preoccupied\r\nthroughout; apparently he had set his hopes upon a day which, thank\r\nheaven, has been a failure. Even in the church he attempted to begin a\r\ndiscussion with M. Molé concerning Napoleon's thoughts and chances\r\nduring the Hundred Days.\r\n\r\nNow I have an extract from a letter sent by Frau von Wolff from\r\nBerlin: \"Hitherto nothing has disturbed the perfect harmony between\r\nthe Sovereign and his people; on political questions there is\r\npractically no difference of opinion among them, so we are almost all\r\northodox in this respect; but religious opinions are strongly divided,\r\nand from this point of view the first steps of the King are watched\r\nwith some anxiety. It is to be hoped that the King will never\r\nsacrifice true merit to sectarian prejudice. With regard to the new\r\nnobility which the King has just created, it will be difficult for me\r\nto give you a precise explanation, for the institution seems to be\r\nstill somewhat vague. The King hopes to obviate the inconvenience of a\r\npoor nobility--and the Prussian nobility is usually poor--by\r\nintroducing new titles and attaching them to territorial estates, so\r\nthat the title will pass only to those children or descendants who\r\ninherit land, and will become extinct if the succession leaves the\r\nfamily. This idea has not been greatly appreciated so far. People fear\r\npossible complications and entanglements and it is thought that the\r\ninstitution will hardly survive, as it is not in harmony with Germanic\r\ncustom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 27, 1840._--The Duc de Noailles tells me that M.\r\nde Tocqueville has withdrawn his candidature for the Academy. The Duc\r\nhas just been to dinner with M. Pasquier, where he met Mgr. Affre; he\r\nspeaks of him as a regular peasant; even the enemies of Mgr. de Quélen\r\nnoticed the difference at the ceremony in the Invalides. It was Mgr.\r\nde Quélen who officiated for the victims of Fieschi. Mgr. Affre is an\r\nappropriate prelate for this wretched age, which is so devoid of\r\ndignity wherever it is looked for.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rochecotte, December 30, 1840._--I hear from Paris that a despatch in\r\na mild and friendly tone has arrived from Russia for communication to\r\nthe Government, saying that the isolation of France is regarded with\r\nregret and that there is a readiness to begin the usual measures for\r\nbringing France into the train of negotiations since a Conservative\r\nMinistry has been re-established at Paris. The despatch was read to M.\r\nGuizot and then to the King. Can it betoken a desire for a closer\r\nunion? I hardly think so, but I do think that there is a general wish\r\nto avoid war in Russia as well as elsewhere; that there is a wish to\r\ncalm the feelings of France and induce her to disarm, and that\r\ndisarmament may follow elsewhere, for these general armaments are the\r\nruin of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n_Message from President Jackson of the United States_\r\n\r\nSince the last session of the Congress the validity of our claims upon\r\nFrance, as arranged by the treaty of 1831, has been recognised by both\r\nbranches of the Legislature, and the money has been voted for their\r\nsatisfaction, but I regret to be obliged to inform you that payment\r\nhas not yet been made.\r\n\r\nA short summary of the most important incidents in this lengthy\r\ncontroversy will show how far the motives, by which attempts are made\r\nto justify this delay, are absolutely indefensible.\r\n\r\nWhen I took office I found the United States applying in vain to the\r\njustice of France for the satisfaction of claims the validity of which\r\nhas never been doubted, and has now been admitted by France herself in\r\nthe most solemn manner. The long-standing nature of these claims,\r\ntheir entire justice, and the aggravating circumstances from which\r\nthey sprang, are too well known to the American people for a further\r\ndescription of them to be necessary. It is enough to say that for a\r\nperiod of ten years and more, with the exception of a few intervals,\r\nour commerce has been the object of constant aggression on the part of\r\nFrance, which usually took the form of condemning ships and cargo in\r\nvirtue of arbitrary decrees, contravening both international law and\r\nthe stipulations of the treaties, while ships were burnt on the high\r\nseas, and seizures and confiscations took place under special Imperial\r\nrescripts in the harbours of other nations then in French occupation\r\nor under French control.\r\n\r\nSuch, as is admitted, has been the nature of our grievances,\r\ngrievances in many cases so flagrant that even the authors of them\r\nnever denied our right to satisfaction. Some idea of the extent of our\r\nlosses may be gained by considering the fact that the burning of\r\nvessels at sea and the seizure and sacrifice in forced sales of\r\nAmerican property, apart from awards to privateers before condemnation\r\nwas pronounced, or without such formality, have brought the French\r\nTreasury a sum of twenty-four millions of francs, apart from\r\nconsiderable customs dues.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years this business has been the subject of negotiations,\r\nwhich were interrupted only during the short period when France was\r\noverwhelmed by the united forces of Europe. During this period, when\r\nother nations were extorting their claims at the bayonet's point, the\r\nUnited States suspended their demands in consideration of the\r\ndisasters that had overpowered the brave people to whom they felt\r\nthemselves bound, and in consideration of the brotherly help which\r\nthey had received from France in their own times of suffering and\r\ndanger. The effect of this prolonged and fruitless discussion,\r\ndisastrous both to our relations with France and to our national\r\ncharacter, was obvious, and my own course of duty was perfectly clear\r\nto me. I was bound either to insist upon the satisfaction of our\r\nclaims within a reasonable period or to abandon them entirely. I could\r\nnot doubt that this course was most conformable to the interests and\r\nhonour of the two countries.\r\n\r\nInstructions were therefore given from this point of view to the\r\nMinister who was once more sent to demand satisfaction. When Congress\r\nmet on October 10, 1829, I considered it my duty to refer to these\r\nclaims and to the dilatory attitude of France, in terms sufficiently\r\nstrong to draw the serious attention of both countries to the matter.\r\nThe French Minister then in power took offence at the message, under\r\nthe idea that it contained a threat, upon which basis the French\r\nGovernment did not care to negotiate. The American Minister refuted\r\nthe interpretation which the French authorities attempted to place\r\nupon the message, and reminded the French Minister that the\r\nPresident's message was a communication addressed not to foreign\r\ngovernments, but to the Congress of the United States, and that in\r\nthis message it was his duty under the Constitution to provide this\r\nbody with information upon the state of the Union with reference both\r\nto foreign as well as to domestic affairs. That if, again, in the\r\nperformance of this task he deemed it his duty to call the attention\r\nof the Congress to the consequences which might result from strained\r\nrelations with another Government, one might reasonably suppose that\r\nhe acted under a sense of duty in thus frankly communicating with\r\nanother branch of his own Government, and not that he acted with the\r\nobject of threatening a foreign Power. The French Government was\r\nsatisfied and negotiations were continued. These were concluded by the\r\ntreaty of July 4, 1831, which partially recognised the justice of our\r\nclaims, and promised payment to the amount of twenty-five millions of\r\nfrancs in six annual instalments. The ratifications of the treaty were\r\nexchanged at Washington on February 2, 1832. Five days later the\r\ntreaty was presented to Congress, which immediately passed the Acts\r\nnecessary to secure to France the commercial advantages conceded to\r\nher by the arrangement. The treaty had been previously ratified with\r\nfull solemnity by the King of France, in terms which are certainly no\r\nmere formality: \"We, regarding the above convention as satisfactory in\r\nall and each of the conclusions which it contains, declare, both for\r\nourselves and for our heirs and successors, that it is accepted,\r\napproved, ratified, and confirmed, and by these presents, signed with\r\nour hand, we do accept, approve, ratify, and confirm it, promising\r\nupon our faith and word as King to observe and to secure its\r\nobservance inviolably without contravention at any time and without\r\npermitting direct or indirect contravention for any reason or pretext\r\nwhatsoever.\" The official announcement that ratifications had been\r\nexchanged with the United States reached Paris while the Chambers were\r\nin session. The extraordinary delays prejudicial to ourselves by the\r\nintroduction of which the French Government have prevented the\r\nexecution of the treaty, have already been explained to Congress. It\r\nis sufficient to point out that the session then opened was allowed to\r\npass without any effort being made to obtain the necessary funds; that\r\nthe two following sessions also went by without any action resembling\r\na serious effort to secure a decision upon the question; and that not\r\nuntil the fourth session, nearly four years after the conclusion of\r\nthe treaty, and more than two years after the exchange of\r\nratifications, was the law referring to the execution of the treaty\r\nput to the vote and rejected.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the United States Government, in full confidence that the\r\ntreaty concluded would be executed in good faith, and with equal\r\nconfidence that measures would be taken to secure payment of the first\r\ninstalment, which was to fall due on February 2, 1833, negotiated a\r\nbill for the amount through the Bank of the United States. When this\r\nbill was presented by bearer the French Government allowed it to be\r\nprotested. Apart from the loss incurred by non-payment, the United\r\nStates had to meet the claims of the bank, which asserted infringement\r\nof its interests, in satisfaction of which this institution seized and\r\nstill holds a corresponding amount from the State revenues.\r\n\r\nCongress was in session when the decision of the Chambers was\r\ncommunicated to Washington, and an immediate announcement of this\r\ndecision on the part of France was a step which was naturally expected\r\nfrom the President. The profound discontent shown by public opinion\r\nand the similar excitement which prevailed in the Congress, made it\r\nmore than probable that a recourse to immediate measures for securing\r\nredress would be the consequence of any appeal made upon this question\r\nto Congress itself.\r\n\r\nWith a sincere desire to preserve the peaceful relations which have so\r\nlong existed between the two countries, I wished to avoid this step if\r\nI could be convinced that in thus acting, neither the interests nor\r\nthe honour of my country would be compromised. Without the most\r\ncomplete assurance upon this point I could not hope to discharge the\r\nresponsibility which I assumed in allowing the Congress to adjourn\r\nwithout giving it an account of the affair. These conditions seemed to\r\nbe satisfied by the assurances which were given to me.\r\n\r\nThe French Government had foreseen that the feeling in the United\r\nStates aroused by this second rejection of the credit vote would be as\r\nI have described it, and prompt measures had been taken by the French\r\nGovernment to anticipate the consequences. The King personally\r\nexpressed through our Minister at Paris his profound regret for the\r\ndecision of the Chambers and promised to send a ship of war with\r\ndespatches to his Minister here, forthwith authorising him to give\r\nevery assurance to the government and the people of the United States\r\nthat the treaty would be in any case faithfully performed by France.\r\nThe warship arrived and the Minister received his instructions.\r\nProfessing to act in virtue of these instructions he gave the most\r\nsolemn assurances that immediately after the new elections, and as\r\nsoon as ever the Chamber would allow, the French Chambers would be\r\nconvoked and that the attempt to obtain the necessary credit would be\r\nrenewed; that all the constitutional power of the King and his\r\nMinisters would be exerted to secure this object. It was understood\r\nthat he pledged himself to this end, and this Government expressly\r\ninformed him that the question ought to be decided at a date\r\nsufficiently near to enable Congress to learn the result at the\r\ncommencement of the session.\r\n\r\nRelying upon these assurances, I undertook the responsibility of\r\nallowing Congress to separate without offering any communication upon\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nOur expectations, reasonably based upon promises so solemnly given,\r\nwere not realised. The French Chambers met on July 31, 1834, and\r\nthough our Minister at Paris urged the French Ministers to lay the\r\nmatter before the Chambers, they refused. He then insisted that if the\r\nChambers had been prorogued without coming to any conclusion in the\r\nmatter, they should be again convoked in time to enable their decision\r\nto be known at Washington before the meeting of Congress. This\r\nreasonable demand was not only refused, but the Chambers were\r\nprorogued until December 29, a date so remote that their decision in\r\nall probability could not have been obtained in time to reach\r\nWashington before the Congress was forced to adjourn by the terms of\r\nthe Constitution. The reasons given by the Ministry for their refusal\r\nto convoke the Chambers at a nearer date were afterwards shown to have\r\nbeen by no means insurmountable, for the Chambers were convoked on\r\nDecember 1 for the special purpose of considering home affairs, though\r\nthis fact did not become known to our Government until after the last\r\nsession of the Congress. As our reasonable expectations were thus\r\ndeceived, it was my imperative duty to consult Congress as to the\r\nadvisability of reprisals, in case the stipulations of the treaty were\r\nnot promptly carried out. For this purpose a communication was\r\nindispensable. It would have been unworthy of us in the course of this\r\ncommunication to refrain from an explanation of all the facts\r\nnecessary for an exact comprehension of the affair, or to shrink from\r\ntruth for fear of offending others. On the other hand, to have gone a\r\nstep further with the object of wounding the pride of a government and\r\na people with whom we have so many reasons to cultivate friendly\r\nrelations to our mutual advantage would have been both imprudent and\r\ndisastrous.\r\n\r\nAs past events had warned us of the difficulty of drawing up the most\r\nsimple statement of our grievances without wounding the feelings of\r\nthose who had become responsible for redressing them, I did my best to\r\nprevent any interpretation of the message containing the\r\nrecommendations placed before Congress as a threat to France. I\r\ndisavowed any such design and further declared that the pride and the\r\npower of France were so well known that no one would expect to extort\r\nsatisfaction by fear. The message did not reach Paris until more than\r\na month after the Chambers had met, and to such an extent did the\r\nMinistry disregard our legitimate claims, that our Minister was\r\ninformed that the matter would not be made a Cabinet question when it\r\nhad been brought forward.\r\n\r\nAlthough the message was not officially communicated to the Government\r\nand although it contained definite declarations that no menace was\r\nintended, the French Ministers determined to regard the conditional\r\nproposal of reprisals as a threat and as an insult, which the national\r\nhonour made it their duty to reject.\r\n\r\nThe measures by which they proceeded to show their resentment of this\r\nsupposed insult were the immediate recall of their Minister from\r\nWashington, the offer of passports to the American Minister at Paris,\r\nand a declaration in the legislative Chambers that diplomatic\r\nrelations with the United States Government were suspended.\r\n\r\nAfter they had thus avenged the dignity of France, they proceeded to\r\nshow their justice. For this purpose a law was immediately presented\r\nto the Chamber of Deputies asking for the funds necessary to perform\r\nthe terms of the treaty. As this proposal afterwards became a law, the\r\nterms of which are now one of the chief subjects of discussion between\r\nthe two nations, I am bound to retrace the history of this law.\r\n\r\nThe Financial Minister in his explanation alluded to the measures\r\nwhich had been taken in answer to the supposed insult, and represented\r\nthe performance of the treaty as imperative upon the honour and\r\njustice of France. As the mouthpiece of the Ministry he declared that\r\nthe message, until it had received the sanction of Congress, was\r\nmerely the simple expression of the President's personal opinion. On\r\nthe other hand he declared that France had entered into engagements\r\nwhich were binding upon her honour. In accordance with this point of\r\nview, the only condition upon which the French Ministry proposed to\r\nconsider the payment of the money was to defer this payment until it\r\nwas certain that the United States Government had done nothing which\r\ncould injure the interests of France, or, in other terms, that\r\nCongress had not authorised any measure hostile to France.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the French Cabinet could not have known what was the\r\nattitude or the decision of Congress, but on January 14 the Senate\r\ndecided that there was no reason for the moment to take any\r\nlegislative measures with reference to the business proceeding between\r\nthe United States and France, and no decision upon the subject was\r\nmade in the Representative Chamber. These facts were known at Paris\r\nbefore March 28, 1835, when the Commission which had been considering\r\nthe bill of indemnity presented its report to the Chamber of Deputies.\r\nThis Commission repeated the opinions of the Ministry, declared that\r\nthe Congress had put aside the proposals of the President, and\r\nproposed the adoption of the law with no other restriction than that\r\noriginally stated. The French Ministry and the Chambers thus knew that\r\nif the position they had adopted, and which had been so frequently\r\nstated to be incompatible with the honour of France, was maintained,\r\nand if the law was adopted in its original form, the money would be\r\npaid and this unfortunate discussion would come to an end. But this\r\nflattering hope was soon destroyed by an amendment introduced into the\r\nlaw at the moment of its adoption, providing that the money should not\r\nbe paid until the Government had received satisfactory explanations\r\nconcerning the President's message of December 2, 1834. What is still\r\nmore remarkable, the President of the Council[148] adopted this\r\namendment and consented to its insertion in the law. As for the\r\npretended insult which had induced them to recall their Minister and\r\nsend our Minister his passports, not until then did they propose to\r\nask for an explanation of this incident. The proposals and opinions\r\nwhich they had declared could not reasonably be imputed to the\r\nAmerican people or government were put forward as obstacles to the\r\naccomplishment of an act of justice towards this government and\r\npeople. They had declared that the honour of France required the\r\nperformance of an undertaking into which the King had entered unless\r\nCongress adopted the proposals of the message. They were certain that\r\nCongress had not adopted them and none the less they refused to\r\nperform the terms of the treaty until they had obtained from the\r\nPresident an explanation of an opinion which they had themselves\r\ncharacterised as personal and ineffectual. The supposition that I had\r\nintended to threaten or to insult the French Government is as\r\nunfounded as any attempt to extort from the fears of that nation that\r\nwhich its feelings of justice would have made it refuse, would have\r\nbeen foolish and ridiculous; but the Constitution of the United States\r\nobliges the President to explain to Congress the situation of the\r\ncountry and the American people cannot admit the intervention of any\r\nGovernment whatever upon earth in the free performance of the domestic\r\nduties which the Constitution has imposed upon its public officials.\r\nThe discussions proceeding between the different branches of our\r\nGovernment concern ourselves alone, and our representatives are\r\nresponsible for any words which they may utter only to their own\r\nconstituents and to their fellows in office. If, in the course of\r\nthese discussions, facts have been inaccurately stated, or wrong\r\ninferences have been drawn from them, correction will necessarily\r\nfollow when the mistakes are perceived, from their love of justice and\r\ntheir sense of self-respect; but they will never submit to be\r\nquestioned upon that matter as a right by any foreign Power. When\r\nthese discussions lead to action, then our responsibility to foreign\r\nPowers begins, but it is then a national and not an individual\r\nresponsibility. The principle upon which a demand is issued for an\r\nexplanation of the terms of my message would also justify the claim of\r\nany foreign Power to demand an explanation of the terms employed in a\r\ncommittee report or in the speech of a member of Congress.\r\n\r\n  [148] At that time the Duc de Broglie.\r\n\r\nIt is not the first time that the French Government has taken offence\r\nat messages from American presidents. President Washington and\r\nPresident Adams, in the performance of their duties to the American\r\npeople, encountered ill-feeling on the part of the French Directory.\r\nThe grievance raised by the Minister of Charles X. and removed by the\r\nexplanations offered by our Minister at Paris, has already been\r\nmentioned when it was known that the Minister of the reigning King\r\ntook offence at my message last year by interpreting it in a sense\r\nwhich the very terms of it forbade. Our last Minister at Paris in\r\nreply to the last note which showed dissatisfaction with the language\r\nof the message, sent a communication to the French Government under\r\ndate January 28, 1835, which was calculated to remove all the\r\nimpressions that undue susceptibility might have received. This note\r\nrepeated and recalled to the attention of the French Government the\r\ndisavowal contained in the message itself of any intention to use\r\nintimidation by threats; it declared in all truth that the message did\r\nnot contain either in words or intention any accusation of bad faith\r\nagainst the King of the French; it drew a very reasonable distinction\r\nbetween the right of complaining in measured terms of the failure to\r\nperform the terms of the convention, and an imputation that the delay\r\nin performance was due to evil motives; in short it showed that the\r\nnecessary exercise of this right was not to be regarded as an\r\noffensive imputation. Although this communication was made by our\r\nMinister without instructions and entirely upon his own\r\nresponsibility, my approbation has since made it a governmental act\r\nand this approbation was officially notified to the French Government\r\non April 25, 1835. However, it produced no effect. The law was passed\r\nwith the unfortunate amendment, supported by the King's Ministers and\r\nwas definitely approved by the King.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States are reasonably inclined to pursue a\r\npacific policy in their dealings with foreign nations; the people must\r\ntherefore be informed of the loyalty of their government to this\r\npolicy. In the present case this policy was carried to the furthest\r\nlimits compatible with due self-respect. The note of January 28 was\r\nnot the only communication which our Minister took the responsibility\r\nof offering upon the same subject and from the same point of view;\r\nwhen he found that it was proposed to make the payment of a just debt\r\ndependent upon the accomplishment of a condition which he knew could\r\nnever be performed, he thought himself bound to make a further attempt\r\nto convince the French Government that, if our self-respect and our\r\nregard for the dignity of other nations prevented us from using any\r\nlanguage which might give offence, at the same time we would never\r\nrecognise the right of any foreign government to require an\r\nexplanation of communications passing between the different branches\r\nof our public service. To prevent any misunderstanding the Minister\r\nrecalled the language used in a preceding Note and added that any\r\nexplanation which could be reasonably asked or honourably given, had\r\nalready been furnished and that the annexation of this demand to the\r\nlaw as a condition, was not only useless but might be regarded as\r\noffensive and would certainly never be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nWhen this last communication, to which I called the special attention\r\nof the Congress, was submitted to me, I conceived the hope that its\r\nobvious intention of securing a prompt and honourable settlement of\r\nthe difficulties between the two nations would have been achieved, and\r\nI therefore did not hesitate to give it my sanction and my complete\r\napprobation. So much was due from me to the Minister who had made\r\nhimself responsible for the act. The people of the United States were\r\npublicly informed of it and I am now communicating it to the people's\r\nrepresentatives to show how far the Executive power has gone in its\r\nattempts to restore a good understanding between the two countries. My\r\napproval would have been communicated to the French Government if an\r\nofficial request for it had been received.\r\n\r\nAs the French Government had thus received all the explanations which\r\nhonour and principle could allow, we hoped that there would be no\r\nfurther hesitation in paying the instalments as they fell due. The\r\nagent authorised to receive the money was instructed to inform the\r\nFrench Government of his readiness; by way of reply he was informed\r\nthat the money could not then be paid because the formalities required\r\nby the act of the Chambers had not been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAs I had received no official communication concerning the intentions\r\nof the French Government, and as I was anxious to conclude this\r\ndisagreeable affair before the meeting of Congress, I instructed our\r\nMinister at Paris to inquire into the final determination of the\r\nFrench Government and if the due payment of the instalment was\r\nrefused, to return to the United States without further explanations.\r\n\r\nThe results of this last step have not yet reached our knowledge, but\r\nwe expect information daily. I trust that information may be\r\nfavourable. As the different powers in France have recognised the\r\njustice of our rights and the obligations imposed upon them by the\r\ntreaty of 1831, and as no real cause remains as an excuse for further\r\ndelay, we may hope that France will at length adopt that course of\r\nprocedure demanded no less imperiously by the interests of the two\r\nnations than by the principles of justice. When once the treaty has\r\nbeen carried out by France, few causes of disagreement will remain\r\nbetween the two countries, and in short there will be nothing that\r\ncannot be surmounted by the influence of a pacific and enlightened\r\npolicy and by the influence of that mutual good will and those\r\ngenerous recollections which will, we trust, then be revived in all\r\ntheir early strength; but in any case, the question of principle which\r\nhas been raised by the new turn given to the discussion is of such\r\nvital importance to the independent action of the government, that we\r\ncannot abandon it or make it the subject of a bargain without\r\ncompromising our national honour. I need not say that such a sacrifice\r\nwill never be made by any act of mine. I will never stain the honour\r\nof my country to relieve myself of my obligation to tell the truth and\r\nto do my duty; nor can I give any other explanations of my official\r\nact than those required by honour and justice. This determination, I\r\nfeel sure, will meet with the approbation of my constituents. My\r\nknowledge of their character is very inadequate if the sum of\r\ntwenty-five millions of francs should outweigh for a moment in their\r\neyes any question which affects their national independence; and if\r\nunfortunately a different impression should prevail they would rally,\r\nI feel certain, about their chosen Government vigorously and\r\nunanimously, and silence for ever this degrading imputation.\r\n\r\nHaving thus frankly submitted to the Congress the further steps which\r\nhave taken place since last session, in this interesting and important\r\naffair and also the views of the Executive power concerning it, it\r\nonly remains for me to add, that as soon as the information expected\r\nby our Minister has been received, it will become the subject of a\r\nspecial communication.[149]\r\n\r\n  [149] From the _Journal des Débats of January 1, 1836_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n   _Speech by the_ DUC DE BROGLIE, _President of the Council,\r\n   Chamber of Deputies in the Session of January 6, 1836, on the\r\n   subject of Poland_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nI do full justice to high ideals and the noble passions with which the\r\norator whom you have just heard has been inspired;[150] but I will\r\nventure to remind him that he has not done full justice to the\r\nGovernment and to the Ministry of 1831 in expressing his apparent\r\nbelief that the difficulties of that period prevented our Cabinet from\r\nshowing that interest in the Polish nation which a French Government\r\nwill always feel for Poland.\r\n\r\n  [150] M. Odilon Barrot.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, difficult and dangerous as it was, when the domestic\r\ncircumstances of France were very perplexing, the French Government\r\ndid for the Polish nation all that it was its duty to do. It did more\r\nthan any other nation, and if history ever reveals the diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence of the French Government at that time, I venture to\r\nthink that full justice will be done to the illustrious man who was\r\nthen President of the Cabinet.[151]\r\n\r\n  [151] M. Casimir Perier.\r\n\r\nWhat was done at that time in the interests of humanity and justice,\r\nthe Government has never ceased to do whenever it thought that its\r\nintervention could be of any use to the population of Poland.\r\n\r\nBut in the presence of so enlightened a Chamber as this, it is\r\nunnecessary to recall the fact that the intervention of a foreign\r\nPower in the domestic administration of another state must be\r\nconducted with every care and precaution. There is often a reason to\r\nfear that such intervention, far from calming irritation and\r\nexasperation and far from weakening political animosity, may arouse\r\nthese passions to greater power. In a word, such a task can only be\r\nfulfilled by the constant exercise of care and precaution.\r\n\r\nI trust that the Chamber will understand me if I say that the French\r\nGovernment has never neglected any opportunity of intervening in the\r\ninterests of humanity, but the Chamber will also understand perhaps\r\nthat this is not the right moment for serving humanity and that it is\r\nindeed against the wishes of the Chamber to press the Government to\r\nfurther efforts in this place. It is to be feared that words actuated\r\nby generous feeling may indeed produce an effect entirely contrary to\r\nthe sentiments which inspires them and may merely be translated abroad\r\ninto greater ill-feeling. There is a fear, in short, that the cause of\r\nhumanity may be betrayed in the very wish to serve it and without the\r\nknowledge of those who desire to defend it (General cries of Hear,\r\nHear).\r\n\r\nOn this point I shall say no more. The former speaker has himself\r\npointed out the difference that should characterise the observations\r\nof one who speaks for the Government, and those of an isolated member\r\nof the Chamber. The Chamber will certainly understand that it is not\r\nfor me to reply severally to the observations which have been laid\r\nbefore you, because any answer to these observations will have an\r\nundue importance as coming from myself.\r\n\r\nAs to the other branch of the question, the existence of treaties\r\nwhich the first speaker has discussed, and to which the second[152]\r\nhas also referred; I will speak upon the matter as shortly as I can.\r\nAs far as I know, absolutely no one in Europe would assert that\r\ntreaties should not be faithfully executed both in their letter and\r\ntheir spirit, but in the article of the treaty to which the two\r\norators have referred, different principles are enounced; principles\r\nwhich are not incompatible, and should indeed be reconciled; on the\r\none hand the Independence of Poland, and on the other the Union of\r\nPoland with Russia. In this article the principle is laid down that\r\nrepresentation and certain national institutions should exist; but\r\nexecution has been delayed until we know what these institutions are\r\nto be, and under what form they will be established.\r\n\r\n  [152] M. Saint-Marc Girardin.\r\n\r\nThis article was not drawn up with all the clearness that might have\r\nbeen desired. The possibility is thus open that the several Powers who\r\nsigned the treaty of 1815 may interpret it in different senses, and\r\nemphasise more or less the principles therein enounced. It may be--I\r\nam only putting a hypothetical case--that the several Powers will not\r\nagree upon the application of these principles, or upon the nature of\r\nthe action that lies before them. Are we to say that the moment a\r\ndifference of opinion arises, we should immediately have recourse to\r\nforce? The Chamber cannot countenance such an idea. The maintenance of\r\nrelations between the Powers is upon the same footing as the\r\nmaintenance of harmony between the public bodies. The mere fact that\r\ndivergence of opinion is possible is no reason for an appeal to force.\r\nDiscussion, reason, and time will enable the truth to prevail.\r\n\r\nWell, gentlemen, I am confident that the Chamber will understand\r\nwithout further words from myself upon the question now before it,\r\nthat there are divergences of opinion between the different Powers\r\nupon certain points. We consider that negotiations, discussion, and\r\ntime will enable the truth to prevail, and we trust that upon this\r\npoint you will agree with us. (Loud applause.)[153]\r\n\r\n  [153] From the _Journal des Débats of January 7, 1836_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n   _Eulogy upon_ COUNT REINHART, _delivered at the Academy of Moral\r\n   and Political Science, by the_ PRINCE DE TALLEYRAND, _in the\r\n   Session of March, 3, 1838_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n\r\nI was in America when the kindnes of my friends appointed me a member\r\nof the Institute, and thus connected me with the study of Moral and\r\nPolitical Science, to which society I have had the honour to belong\r\nsince its origin.\r\n\r\nOn my return to France my first care was to attend the sessions of the\r\nInstitute, and thus to show the members of that time, many of whom we\r\nhave every reason to regret, what pleasure I felt at finding myself\r\none of their number. During the first session at which I was present\r\nthe committee was reappointed, and I received the honourable post of\r\nsecretary. The six months' report which I drew up, with all the care\r\nthat I could bring to it, was perhaps of a too deferential character,\r\nas I was giving an account of work to which I was a complete stranger.\r\nIt was work which doubtless had cost much research and much labour to\r\none of our most learned colleagues, and was entitled, \"Dissertations\r\nupon the Riparian Laws.\" At the same time in our public meetings I\r\ndelivered some lectures which I was then allowed to insert in the\r\nMemoirs of the Institute. Forty years have elapsed since that date,\r\nduring which this chair has been forbidden to me, first by long\r\nabsences, and also by duties to which I was obliged to devote the\r\nwhole of my time, and I may add by the discretion which times of\r\ndifficulty make incumbent upon a man whose business is political;\r\nand, finally, by the infirmities which old age usually brings or\r\naggravates.\r\n\r\nBut to-day I feel it necessary--and, indeed, regard it as a duty--to\r\nappear for the last time in memory of a man known throughout Europe, a\r\nman who was my friend, and who was our colleague since the formation\r\nof the Institute. I come forward publicly to testify to our esteem for\r\nhis person and to our regret for his loss. His position and mine\r\nenable me to reveal several of his special merits. His principal, but\r\nnot his sole title to glory consists in a correspondence extending\r\nover forty years, necessarily unknown to the public, who will probably\r\nnever hear of it. I asked myself, \"Who will speak upon that matter\r\nwithin these walls? Who will have any reason to speak of it except\r\nmyself, who have known so much of it, who have been so pleased by it,\r\nand so often helped by it in the course of the Ministerial duties\r\nwhich I have had to perform under three very different reigns?\"\r\n\r\nCount Reinhart was thirty years of age and I was thirty-seven when I\r\nfirst met him. He entered public life with a large stock of\r\ninformation; he knew five or six languages, and was familiar with\r\ntheir literatures. He could have attained celebrity as a poet or\r\nhistorian or geographer, and in this latter capacity he became a\r\nmember of the Institute at the time of its foundation.\r\n\r\nAt that time he was already a member of the Academy of Science in\r\nGöttingen. Born and educated in Germany, he had published in his youth\r\ncertain poems which had attracted the attention of Gessner, Wieland\r\nand Schiller. At a later date, when his health forced him to take the\r\nwaters of Carlsbad, he was fortunate enough to meet and to know the\r\nfamous Goethe, who so far appreciated his taste and his knowledge as\r\nto apply to him for information upon any outstanding features in\r\nFrench literature. Herr Reinhart promised to keep him informed.\r\nUndertakings of this nature among men of first-rate intellectual power\r\nare invariably mutual, and soon become bonds of friendship. The\r\nintimacy between Count Reinhart and Goethe gave rise to a\r\ncorrespondence which is now being printed in Germany.\r\n\r\nHaving thus reached that time of life when a man must definitely\r\nchoose that career for which he thinks himself best fitted, we shall\r\nsee that Herr Reinhart formed a resolution by no means consistent with\r\nhis character, his tastes, his own position, and that of his family:\r\nremarkable as the fact was for that age, in preference to the many\r\ncareers in which he could have been independent, he chose one in which\r\nindependence was impossible, and gave his preference to diplomacy. His\r\nchoice was a good one; he was fitted to occupy any post in this\r\nprofession, and filled all posts in succession and all with\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nI will venture to assert that his early studies had fitted him\r\nadmirably for his profession. His work in theology especially had\r\nbrought him distinction in the seminary of Denkendorf and in the\r\nProtestant faculty of Tübingen; it had given him a strength and\r\ndexterity in argument which may be noted in every document from his\r\npen. Lest I should seem to be pursuing a paradoxical idea, I may\r\nrecall the fact that several of our great diplomatists were\r\ntheologians, and have all made their mark in history by their conduct\r\nof the most important political affairs of their age. Cardinal\r\nChancellor Duprat was as completely versed in canon law as\r\njurisprudence, and fixed, in conjunction with Leo X., the principles\r\nof the Concordat which in large part survives to-day; Cardinal\r\nd'Ossat, notwithstanding the opposition of several great Powers,\r\nsucceeded in reconciling Henry IV. with the Court of Rome; his\r\nsurviving correspondence is still recommended for study to those of\r\nour young men who propose to follow a political career; Cardinal de\r\nPolignac, a theologian, poet, and diplomatist, after many unhappy\r\nwars, was able to preserve the conquests of Louis XIV. to France by\r\nthe treaty of Utrecht.\r\n\r\nThus, too, amid theological books collected by his father, afterwards\r\nBishop of Gap, was begun the education of M. de Lionne, to whose name\r\nfresh lustre has recently been added by an important publication.\r\n\r\nThe names which I have quoted will suffice to justify my idea of the\r\ninfluence which I conceive to have been exerted upon Count Reinhart's\r\nmind by the early studies to which his father's education had directed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe varied and profound information which he had acquired qualified\r\nhim to perform at Bordeaux the honourable, if modest, duties of tutor\r\nin a Protestant family in that town. There he naturally began\r\nrelations with several men whose talents, whose mistakes, and whose\r\ndeath brought such renown to our first Legislative Assembly. Count\r\nReinhart was easily induced by them to enter the service of France.\r\n\r\nI feel in no way obliged to follow in detail the many vicissitudes of\r\nhis long career. The numerous posts which were entrusted to him,\r\nsometimes of importance, at other times of inferior rank, seem to have\r\nfollowed in no consecutive order, and, indeed, to denote a want of\r\ngradation which we could hardly understand at the present time; but in\r\nthat age neither positions nor persons were subject to prejudice. In\r\nother times favour, and more rarely discrimination, called men to\r\neminent positions, but during the time of which I speak, for good or\r\nfor evil, positions were won by force, and such a system naturally\r\nproduced confusion.\r\n\r\nThus we shall see Count Reinhart as First Secretary to the London\r\nEmbassy; in a similar position at Naples; as Plenipotentiary Minister\r\nto the Hanseatic towns, Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck; head of the third\r\ndivision in the Department of Foreign Affairs; Plenipotentiary\r\nMinister at Florence; Foreign Minister; Plenipotentiary Minister in\r\nSwitzerland; Consul-General at Milan; Plenipotentiary Minister for the\r\narea of Lower Saxony; Resident in the Turkish provinces beyond the\r\nDanube, and Chief Commissioner of commercial relations in Moldavia;\r\nPlenipotentiary Minister to the King of Westphalia; head of the\r\nchancery in the Department of Foreign Affairs; Plenipotentiary\r\nMinister to the Germanic Diet and to the free town of Frankfort; and,\r\nfinally, Plenipotentiary Minister at Dresden. How many posts, how much\r\nwork, and how many interests were thus confided to the care of one\r\nman! And this at a time when talent seemed likely to be the less\r\nappreciated, as war appeared to be the chief arbitrator in every\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nYou will not expect me, gentlemen, to give you any detailed account\r\nwith dates of the works which Count Reinhart produced in the various\r\nposts which I have just enumerated; such an account would need a\r\nvolume. I need only speak to you of the manner in which he fulfilled\r\nhis official duties, whether he was Head of a Department, Minister, or\r\nConsul.\r\n\r\nCount Reinhart had not at that time the advantage which he might have\r\nhad a few years later of seeing excellent models for his imitation;\r\nbut he was well aware what high and different capacities should\r\ndistinguish the head of a department of Foreign Affairs. His delicate\r\ntact showed him that the habits of such a head should be simple,\r\nregular, and retiring; that, remote from the uproar of the world, he\r\nshould live for business alone, and bring to it an impenetrable\r\nsecrecy; that while always ready to give an answer concerning facts\r\nand men, he should have constantly present to his memory every treaty,\r\nknow the dates of them, their history, have a correct knowledge of\r\ntheir strong points and their weaknesses, their antecedent and\r\nconsequent circumstances; that he should know the names of the chief\r\ndiplomatists and even their family relations; and that while using\r\nthis knowledge, he should be careful not to disturb the penetrating\r\nself-esteem of the Minister, and that if he should ever induce that\r\nMinister to share his own opinions, his success should remain\r\nconcealed. He knew that he could only shine by reflection elsewhere,\r\nbut he was also aware that so pure and modest a life would naturally\r\ncommand every respect.\r\n\r\nCount Reinhart's faculty of observation did not stop at that point. It\r\nhad shown him how unusual is the combination of qualities necessary\r\nfor a Minister of Foreign Affairs. Such a Minister must, in fact, be\r\nendowed with a kind of instinct which will give him prompt warning and\r\nprevent him from compromising himself before any discussion begins: he\r\nmust be able to appear frank while remaining impenetrable; must be\r\nreserved and yet seem careless; must discriminate even in the nature\r\nof his amusements; his conversation must be simple, varied,\r\nattractive, always natural, and sometimes open. In a word, he must\r\nnever cease for a single moment in the twenty-four hours of the day to\r\nbe Minister of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, unusual as these capacities are, they could hardly\r\nbe adequate if loyalty did not give them that support which they\r\nalmost always require. I am bound to mention the fact here in\r\nopposition to a prejudice generally current. Diplomacy is not a\r\nscience of duplicity and trickery; if good faith is required anywhere,\r\nit is especially necessary in political transactions, for it alone can\r\nmake them permanent and durable. Attempts have been made to identify\r\nreserve with duplicity; good faith will never authorise duplicity, but\r\nit may admit reserve, and reserve has the special faculty of\r\nincreasing confidence.\r\n\r\nDominated by a sense of honour and of his country's interests, by the\r\nhonour and interests of his Sovereign, by the love of liberty founded\r\nupon a respect for order and uniform justice, a Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs, when he is equal to his task, occupies the highest position\r\nto which any lofty mind could aspire.\r\n\r\nMuch as is required of a competent Minister, how much more is required\r\nof a good Consul. The claims upon a Consul are infinitely varied and\r\nare of a totally different order from those which may affect the other\r\nofficials of a Foreign Office. They require an amount of practical\r\nexperience which can only be acquired by a special education. Within\r\nthe area of their jurisdiction Consuls are required to perform for\r\ntheir compatriots the duties of judges, arbitrators, and mediators;\r\noften they are officers of the Civil State; they act as notaries, and\r\nsometimes as Admiralty officers; they watch and report upon sanitary\r\naffairs; their position enables them to give an accurate and complete\r\nidea of the state of trade, of navigation, and of manufactures in the\r\ncountry where they reside. Count Reinhart, who neglected nothing to\r\nsecure the accuracy of that information with which it was his business\r\nto provide his Government, or the correctness of the decisions which\r\nas a political agent, as Consul and Admiralty officer, he was obliged\r\nto give, had made a profound study of international and shipping law.\r\nThis study had induced him to think that a time would come when clever\r\ncombinations would establish a general system of commerce and\r\nnavigation in which the interests of every nation would be respected,\r\nand the basis of which would be so strong that not even war itself\r\ncould alter the principle of it, though it might interrupt some of its\r\nresults. He was also able to decide certainly and promptly all\r\nquestions of interchange, arbitration, conversion of money, weights\r\nand measures, while no claims were ever raised in dispute of the\r\ninformation which he provided or of the judgments which he delivered.\r\nIt is also true that the personal consideration which he enjoyed\r\nthroughout his career gave much influence to his intervention in any\r\nmatter which he conducted or in any dispute upon which he had to\r\npronounce.\r\n\r\nWide as a man's knowledge may be and vast as his capacity, the\r\ncomplete diplomatist is but very rarely met with. Yet Count Reinhart\r\nmight have attained this distinction if he had had one additional\r\ncapacity. The clearness of his view and intelligence was admirable; he\r\ncould write an excellent account of anything that he had seen or\r\nheard; his style was resourceful, easy, clever, and attractive. Of all\r\nthe diplomatic correspondence of that age, the Emperor Napoleon, who\r\nhad every right to be fastidious, showed a preference for the\r\ndespatches of Count Reinhart; but admirably as he wrote, he could only\r\nexpress himself with difficulty. For action his intelligence required\r\nmore time than conversation could provide, and for the easy\r\nreproduction of his mental speech he was obliged to work alone and\r\nunaided. Notwithstanding this real inconvenience, Count Reinhart\r\nalways succeeded in performing his commissions thoroughly well. Whence\r\ndid he derive the inspiration which enabled him to succeed?\r\n\r\nThe source of his power, gentlemen, was a real and profound belief\r\nwhich governed all his actions, the sense of duty. The strength of\r\nthis belief is not often entirely realised. A life entirely devoted to\r\nduty is easily separated from ambition. Count Reinhart's life was\r\ngiven up to the duties which he had to perform, nor was there in him\r\nany trace of personal ambition or any claim to rapid promotion. The\r\nreligion of duty to which Count Reinhart was faithful all his life,\r\nconsists in perfect submission to the orders and instructions of\r\nsuperiors; in constant vigilance added to much perspicacity, which\r\nnever leaves those superiors ignorant of what they ought to know; in a\r\nstrict adherence to truth in every official report, whether agreeable\r\nor unpleasant; in an impenetrable discretion and a regularity of life\r\nwhich secure confidence and esteem; in decorum of outward conduct and\r\nin continual care to give the acts of his Government that colouring\r\nand that interpretation demanded by the interest of the affairs under\r\nhis charge.\r\n\r\nThough advancing age had warned Count Reinhart that it was time for\r\nrest, he would never have asked to be relieved, fearing that he might\r\nseem to show coldness in his pursuit of a career which had been\r\nlife-long. The royal kindness, with its invariable attention,\r\nconsidered his necessities and gave this great servant of France a\r\nmost honourable post, by calling him to the Chamber of Peers. Count\r\nReinhart did not long enjoy this honour and died almost suddenly on\r\nDecember 5, 1837. He was twice married, and had a son by his first\r\nwife, who is now pursuing a political career. The best wish that we\r\ncan offer the son is that he may resemble his father as nearly as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n   _Memorandum addressed by_ LORD PALMERSTON _to the French\r\n     Government and handed to_ M. THIERS _by_ Mr. BÜLWER _at the\r\n     beginning of September 1840_.\r\n\r\n    FOREIGN OFFICE, _August 31, 1840._\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nVarious reasons have prevented me from sending you earlier and\r\ntransmitting through you to the French Government certain observations\r\nwhich Her Majesty's Government desire to make upon the Memorandum\r\nwhich was handed to me on July 24 by the French Ambassador to this\r\nCourt, in reply to the Memorandum which I had handed to His Excellency\r\non the 17th of that month; but I am now able to fulfil this task.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government observes with great satisfaction the friendly\r\ntone of the French Memorandum and its assurances of keen desire to\r\nmaintain peace and the balance of power in Europe. The Memorandum of\r\nJuly 17 was conceived in a spirit no less friendly towards France, and\r\nHer Majesty's Government is equally anxious that France should be able\r\nto keep peace in Europe and prevent the smallest disturbance of that\r\nequilibrium which now exists between the Powers.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government has been equally delighted to see the\r\ndeclarations contained in the French Memorandum stating that France\r\nwishes to act in concert with the other four Powers with reference to\r\nthe affairs in the Levant.\r\n\r\nOn this point the sentiments of Her Majesty's Government correspond in\r\nevery respect with those of the French Government: for, in the first\r\nplace, throughout the negotiations which have proceeded upon this\r\nquestion for more than twelve months, the British Government has\r\nconstantly been anxious that a concert of the five Powers should be\r\nestablished, and that all five should agree to a common line of\r\naction; Her Majesty's Government though not bound to defer, as proof\r\nof this desire, to the other proposals which have been made from time\r\nto time to the French Government, and to which reference has been made\r\nin the French Memorandum, can unhesitatingly declare that no European\r\nPower can be less influenced than Great Britain by private views or by\r\nany desire and hope of exclusive advantage which might arise in her\r\nfavour from the conclusion of the questions in the Levant. On the\r\ncontrary, in these matters the interests of Great Britain are\r\nidentical with those of Europe in general, and are based upon the\r\nmaintenance of the integrity and independence of the Ottoman Empire as\r\na guarantee for the preservation of peace and as essential to the\r\nmaintenance of the balance of power in general.\r\n\r\nTo these principles the French Government has promised its full\r\nadherence, and offered it in more than one instance, especially in a\r\ndespatch from Marshal Soult, under date July 17, 1839. This despatch\r\nwas officially communicated to the four Powers. It has also offered\r\nsupport in a collective note, dated July 27, 1839, and in the speech\r\nof the King of the French to the Chambers in December 1839.\r\n\r\nIn these documents the French Government declares its determination to\r\nmaintain the integrity and independence of the Ottoman Empire under\r\nthe reigning dynasty as essential to the balance of power and as a\r\nguarantee for the preservation of peace; in a despatch from Marshal\r\nSoult the French Government has shown its resolution to oppose by\r\naction and influence any combination which might be hostile to the\r\nmaintenance of this integrity and this independence.\r\n\r\nHence the Governments of Great Britain and of France are entirely\r\nagreed upon the object towards which their policy should be directed.\r\nThe only difference existing between the two Governments is a\r\ndifference of opinion concerning the means regarded as most advisable\r\nto obtain this common end. On this point, as the French Memorandum\r\nobserves, a difference of opinion may naturally be expected.\r\n\r\nOn this point a great difference of opinion has arisen between the two\r\nGovernments, which seems to have become stronger and more pronounced\r\nin proportion as the two Governments have more completely explained\r\ntheir respective views, and this fact for the moment prevents the two\r\nGovernments from acting in concert to attain their common purpose. On\r\nthe one hand, Her Majesty's Government has repeatedly pointed out her\r\nopinion that it would be impossible to maintain the integrity of the\r\nTurkish Empire and to preserve the independence of the Sultan, if\r\nMehemet Ali were to be left in possession of Syria, as the military\r\nkey of Asiatic Turkey, and that if Mehemet Ali were to continue to\r\noccupy this province as well as Egypt, he would be able at any time to\r\nthreaten Bagdad from the south, Diarbekir and Erzeroum from the east,\r\nKoniah, Brousse, and Constantinople from the north; and that the same\r\nambitious spirit which has driven Mehemet Ali under other conditions\r\nto revolt against his Sovereign, would soon induce him hereafter to\r\ntake up arms for further invasions; and that for this purpose he would\r\nalways maintain a large army on foot; that the Sultan, on the other\r\nhand, would be continually on guard against the possible danger, and\r\nwould also be obliged to remain under arms, so that the Sultan and\r\nMehemet Ali would continue to maintain arms upon a war footing for the\r\npurpose of observing one another; that a collision would be the\r\ninevitable result of these continual suspicions and mutual alarms, and\r\nthat even if there should be no premeditated aggression upon either\r\nside, any collision of the sort would necessarily lead to foreign\r\nintervention in the Turkish Empire, while such intervention, thus\r\nprovoked, would produce the most serious discord between the Powers of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government has pointed out as probable, if not as\r\ncertain, an even greater danger than this, which would result from the\r\ncontinued occupation of Syria by Mehemet Ali; namely, that the Pasha,\r\ntrusting to military force and wearied by his political position as a\r\nsubject, would carry out an intention which he has frankly avowed to\r\nthe Powers of Europe that he would never abandon, and would declare\r\nhimself independent. Such a declaration upon his part would\r\nincontestably amount to a dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire, and,\r\nwhat is more, this dismemberment might happen under such conditions as\r\nwould make it more difficult for the European Powers to act in concert\r\nfor the purpose of forcing the Pasha to withdraw such a declaration,\r\nand more difficult than it is for them to-day to combine their forces\r\nand oblige him to evacuate Syria.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government has therefore invariably asserted that the\r\nPowers which are anxious to preserve the integrity of the Turkish\r\nEmpire and to maintain the independence of the Sultan should unite in\r\nhelping the latter to re-establish his direct authority over Syria.\r\n\r\nThe French Government, on the other hand, has asserted that if Mehemet\r\nAli were once assured of the permanent occupation of Egypt and Syria\r\nhe would remain a faithful subject and become the strongest support of\r\nthe Sultan; that the Sultan could not govern if the Pasha were not in\r\npossession of this province, the military and financial resources of\r\nwhich would then be of greater use to him than if they were in the\r\nhands of the Sultan himself; that every confidence might be placed in\r\nthe sincerity with which Mehemet Ali had renounced all ulterior views,\r\nand in his protestations of faithful devotion to his Sovereign; that\r\nthe Pasha is an old man, and upon his death, even if his rights are\r\nrecognised as hereditary, the totality of his acquired power would\r\nrevert to the Sultan, because all possessions in Mohammedan countries,\r\nof whatever nature, are in reality held only upon tenure for lifetime.\r\n\r\nThe French Government has also maintained that Mehemet Ali will never\r\nbe willing to evacuate Syria of his own accord and that the only means\r\nby which European Powers could use force would be operations by sea\r\nwhich would be inadequate, or by land which would be dangerous; that\r\nthese operations by sea would not expel the Egyptians from Syria and\r\nwould merely rouse Mehemet Ali to begin an attack upon Constantinople;\r\nwhile the measures which might be taken in such a case to defend the\r\ncapital and in particular any operations on land undertaken by the\r\ntroops of the allied Powers to expel the army of Mehemet Ali from\r\nSyria, would be more fatal to the Turkish Empire than the state of\r\nthings could possibly be which these measures would be intended to\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\nTo these objections Her Majesty's Government replied that no reliance\r\ncould be placed upon the recent protestations of Mehemet Ali; that his\r\nambition is insatiable and would only be increased by success; and\r\nthat to provide him with the opportunity of invading, or to leave\r\nwithin his reach the objects of his desire would be to sow the seeds\r\nof inevitable collisions; that Syria is no further from Constantinople\r\nthan a large number of well-administered provinces are from their\r\ncapitals in other States and can be as well governed from\r\nConstantinople as from Alexandria; that it is impossible for the\r\nresources of this province to be of any use to the Sultan in the hands\r\nof a governor who might turn them against his master at any moment and\r\nthat they would be more useful if they were in the hands or at the\r\ndisposal of the Sultan himself; that, as Ibrahim had an army at his\r\norders, he had also the means, upon the decease of Mehemet Ali, of\r\nsecuring his own succession to any power of which the latter might be\r\npossessed at his death; that it was not fit that the Great Powers\r\nshould advise the Sultan to conclude a public arrangement with Mehemet\r\nAli, with the secret intention of hereafter breaking the arrangement\r\nupon the first occasion that might seem opportune.\r\n\r\nNone the less the French Government maintained its opinion and refused\r\nto take part in an arrangement which included the use of coercive\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nBut the French Memorandum laid down that in the course of recent\r\ncircumstances no positive proposal has been made to France upon which\r\nshe was called to explain her attitude and that consequently the\r\nresolution which England communicated to her in the Memorandum of July\r\n17, doubtless in the name of the four Powers, must not be considered\r\nas actuated by refusals which France has not made. This passage\r\nobliges me briefly to remind you of the general course of\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\nThe original opinion conceived by Her Majesty's Government, of which\r\nthe five Powers were informed, including France, in 1839, was that the\r\narrangement between the Sultan and Mehemet Ali which might secure a\r\npermanent state of peace in the Levant, would be of a nature to\r\nconfine the power delegated to Mehemet Ali to Egypt alone and would\r\nre-establish the direct authority of the Sultan throughout Syria, both\r\nin Candia and in all the towns of the Holy Land; thus interposing the\r\ndesert between the direct power of the Sultan and the province of\r\nwhich the administration would be left to the Pasha. And Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment proposed that by way of compensation for the evacuation of\r\nSyria, Mehemet Ali should receive an assurance that his male\r\ndescendants should succeed him as governors in Egypt, under the\r\nsovereignty of the Sultan.\r\n\r\nTo this proposal the French Government raised objections saying that\r\nsuch an arrangement would doubtless be the best if there were any\r\nmeans of executing it, but that Mehemet Ali would offer resistance and\r\nthat any measures of violence which the allies might employ to reduce\r\nhim, would produce effects which might be more dangerous to the peace\r\nof Europe and to the independence of the Porte, than the actual state\r\nof affairs between the Sultan and Mehemet Ali could possibly be; that\r\nalthough the French Government thus refused to agree to England's\r\nplan, during the long space of time which had subsequently elapsed, it\r\nhad not proposed any plan of its own. Further, in September 1839,\r\nComte Sébastiani, the French Ambassador at the Court of London,\r\nproposed to draw a line from the east to the west of the sea, nearly\r\nfrom Beyrout to the desert near Damascus and to declare that all the\r\nland to the south of this line should be administered by Mehemet Ali\r\nand that all to the north should be under the immediate authority of\r\nthe Sultan. The French Ambassador then gave Her Majesty's Government\r\nto understand that if such an arrangement were admitted by the five\r\nPowers, France would unite with the four Powers, in case of need, for\r\nthe use of coercive measures, with the object of forcing Mehemet Ali\r\nto submission.\r\n\r\nI pointed out to Comte Sébastiani that such an arrangement was open,\r\nthough in a less degree, to all the objections applicable to the\r\npresent relative position of the two parties and that consequently Her\r\nMajesty's Government could not accede to it. I observed that it seemed\r\ninconsistent on the part of France to express her willingness to force\r\nMehemet Ali to agree to an arrangement which would obviously be\r\nincomplete and inadequate to secure the proposed object, while\r\nobjecting to coercive measures when they were proposed for the purpose\r\nof forcing consent to the arrangement desired by Her Majesty, the\r\nexecution of which, as France admitted, would entirely fulfil the\r\ndesired object.\r\n\r\nTo these arguments Comte Sébastiani replied that the objections\r\nadvanced by the French Government to the employment of coercive\r\nmeasures against Mehemet Ali, were founded upon considerations of\r\ndomestic government, and that these objections would be removed if\r\nthe French Government was enabled to prove to the nation and to the\r\nChambers that it had obtained the best possible conditions for Mehemet\r\nAll and that he had refused to accept them.\r\n\r\nAs this insinuation was not admitted by Her Majesty's Government, the\r\nFrench Government communicated officially on September 27, 1839, its\r\nown plan, which was that Mehemet Ali should become a hereditary\r\ngovernor of Egypt and of all Syria, and governor for life of Candia,\r\nsurrendering nothing but the district of Adana and Arabia. The French\r\nGovernment did not say a word as to its knowledge of Mehemet Ali's\r\ninclination to adhere to this arrangement, nor did it declare that if\r\nhe refused to agree, France would take coercive measures to compel\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nObviously Her Majesty's Government could not consent to this plan,\r\nwhich was open to more objections than the present state of things,\r\nthe more so as the gift to Mehemet Ali of the legal and hereditary\r\ntitle to a third of the Ottoman Empire, which he now occupies only by\r\nforce, would have been to begin the positive dismemberment of the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government, therefore, being desirous to show its\r\nreadiness to come to an agreement with France upon these questions,\r\nstated that it would yield its well-founded objection to any extension\r\nof Mehemet Ali's power beyond Egypt and would join the French\r\nGovernment in recommending the Sultan to grant to Mehemet Ali, apart\r\nfrom the pashalik of Egypt, the administration of the lower part of\r\nSyria, to be bounded on the north by a line drawn from Cape Carmel to\r\nthe southern extremity of the Lake of Tiberias, and by a line from\r\nthis point to the Gulf of Akaba, provided that France would join the\r\nfour Powers in coercive measures if Mehemet Ali refused this offer.\r\nThis proposal, however, was not accepted by the French Government,\r\nwhich now declared its inability to join in coercive measures or to be\r\na party to an arrangement to which Mehemet Ali would not consent.\r\n\r\nWhile these discussions were proceeding with France, separate\r\nnegotiations were in progress between England and Russia, of which\r\nfull details and information have been sent to the French Government.\r\nNegotiations with France were suspended for a time at the outset of\r\nthis year, firstly because a change of Ministry was expected, and\r\nsecondly because a change of Ministry took place.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, however, Baron von Neumann and myself resolved,\r\nupon the advice of our respective governments, to make a last effort\r\nwith the object of inducing France to begin a treaty which was to be\r\nconcluded with the other four Powers, and we submitted to the French\r\nGovernment, through M. Guizot, another proposal for an arrangement\r\nbetween the Sultan and Mehemet Ali. One objection put forward by the\r\nFrench Government to the last proposals of England was that although\r\nit was proposed to give Mehemet Ali the strong position extending from\r\nMount Carmel to Mount Tabor, he would be deprived of the fortress of\r\nAcre.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this objection Baron von Neumann and myself proposed that\r\nthe northern frontiers of the part of Syria to be administered by the\r\nPasha should extend from Cape Nakhora to the furthest point of the\r\nLake of Tiberias, thus including within the boundary the fortress of\r\nAcre; and that the eastern frontier should extend along the western\r\ncoast of the Lake of Tiberias and thence to the Gulf of Akaba. We\r\ndeclared that the government of this part of Syria could be granted to\r\nMehemet Ali for life only, and that neither England nor Austria would\r\nconsent to grant Mehemet Ali hereditary rights over any part of Syria.\r\nI further declared to M. Guizot that I could go no further in the way\r\nof concessions in the hope of securing the co-operation of France, and\r\nthat this was our last proposal. Baron von Neumann and myself\r\ncommunicated these facts separately to M. Guizot: Baron von Neumann\r\nfirst, and myself the next day. M. Guizot told me he would inform his\r\nGovernment of this proposal and of the facts which I had laid before\r\nhim, and that he would let me know the answer as soon as he had\r\nreceived it. A short time afterwards the plenipotentiaries of Austria,\r\nPrussia, and Russia informed me that they had every reason to believe\r\nthat the French Government, instead of deciding upon the proposal for\r\nthemselves, had sent it to Alexandria to learn the decision of Mehemet\r\nAli; that the four Powers who had undertaken the business were thus\r\nconfronted, not with France, but with Mehemet Ali; that, apart from\r\nthe inevitable delay, this was an action which their respective courts\r\nhad never intended to take and one to which they would never consent;\r\nand that the French Government had thus placed the plenipotentiaries\r\nin a very embarrassing position. I agreed with them that their\r\nobjections were justified with regard to the conduct which they\r\nattributed to the French Government, but that M. Guizot had said not a\r\nword to me of what would be done. Mehemet Ali had been informed that\r\nthe French Government at that moment was fully occupied with\r\nparliamentary questions and could naturally ask for time before\r\nsending an answer to our proposals, and that in any case delay could\r\ndo no great harm. About June 27, M. Guizot came to me and read me a\r\nletter addressed to him by M. Thiers, containing the answer of the\r\nFrench Government to our proposal. This answer was a formal refusal.\r\nM. Thiers said that _the French Government positively knew that\r\nMehemet Ali would not consent to a division of Syria unless he were\r\nforced to do so; that France could not co-operate in coercive measures\r\nagainst Mehemet Ali under these conditions, and that therefore she\r\ncould not become a party to the proposed arrangement_.\r\n\r\nAs France had thus refused to yield to England's ultimatum, the\r\nplenipotentiaries were bound to consider what steps should be adopted\r\nby their Governments. The position of the five Powers was this: the\r\nfive had declared their conviction that in the interests of the\r\nbalance of power and of the peace of Europe it was essential to\r\npreserve the independence and integrity of the Ottoman Empire under\r\nthe reigning dynasty; all five had declared that they would use all\r\ntheir influence to maintain this integrity and this independence; but\r\nFrance, on the one hand, insisted that the best means to secure this\r\nresult was to abandon the Sultan to the mercies of Mehemet Ali and to\r\nadvise him to submit to the conditions which Mehemet might impose upon\r\nhim in order to preserve peace _sine qua non_; while on the other side\r\nthe four Powers regarded any further military occupation of the\r\nSultan's provinces by Mehemet Ali as likely to destroy the integrity\r\nof the Turkish Empire and to be fatal to its independence; they\r\ntherefore thought that it was advisable to confine Mehemet Ali within\r\nnarrower limits.\r\n\r\nAfter about two months of deliberations, France not only refused to\r\nconsent to the plan proposed by the four Powers as an ultimatum upon\r\ntheir part, but further declared that she would not become a party to\r\nany arrangement to which Mehemet Ali did not voluntarily consent\r\nwithout the use of force. It only remained then for the four Great\r\nPowers to adopt as an alternative the principle laid down by France,\r\nwhich consisted in the complete submission of the Sultan to the\r\ndemands of Mehemet Ali; or to act upon their principles and force\r\nMehemet Ali to accept an arrangement compatible in form with the\r\nrights of the Sultan, and compatible in content with the integrity of\r\nthe Ottoman Empire. If the former alternative were adopted, the\r\nco-operation of France would be secured; in the latter alternative the\r\nhope of that co-operation must be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe keen desire of the four Powers to secure the co-operation of\r\nFrance has been shown by the fact that they have continued their\r\nefforts for several months in the course of negotiations. They are\r\nwell aware of the value of French support, not only for the particular\r\nobject which they have in view, but also with reference to the general\r\nand permanent interests of Europe. But what they failed to secure, and\r\nwhat they esteemed, was the co-operation of France in the maintenance\r\nof peace to secure the eventual safety of Europe and the practical\r\nexecution of the principles to which the five Powers had declared\r\ntheir agreement. They desired the co-operation of France, not only for\r\nthemselves and for the advantage and opportunity of the moment, but\r\nalso for the good which it might have conferred, and for the future\r\nconsequences which might have resulted from it. They wished to\r\nco-operate with France to do good, but they were not prepared to\r\nco-operate with her in doing evil.\r\n\r\nThinking, therefore, that the policy advised by France was unjust, and\r\nin no way judicious with regard to the Sultan; that it might become\r\nthe cause of misfortunes in Europe; that it was inconsistent with the\r\npublic engagement undertaken by the five Powers, and that it was\r\nincompatible with the principles which they had wisely emphasised, the\r\nfour Powers felt that they could not make the sacrifice demanded of\r\nthem, and buy the help of France at so high a price--if, indeed, that\r\ncould be called co-operation which merely consisted in allowing events\r\nto follow their natural course. As the four Powers were thus unable to\r\nadopt the views of France, they determined to accomplish their\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nThis determination, however, was not unexpected and the probable\r\neventualities had not been hidden from France. On the contrary, upon\r\nseveral occasions during the course of negotiations, and no later than\r\nOctober 1 last, I had pointed out to the French Ambassador that our\r\ndesire to remain united with France must have a limit, that we were\r\nanxious to go forward with France but not disposed to come to a\r\nstandstill with her, and that if she could not contrive to act in\r\nharmony with the four Powers, she must not be astonished if she saw\r\nthem come to an understanding between themselves and acting apart from\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nComte Sabastiani told me that he foresaw that we should thus act, and\r\nthat he could predict the result; that we were bound to try and\r\nconclude our arrangements without the help of France, and that we\r\nshould find that our means were inadequate; that France would be a\r\npassive spectator of events; that after a year or eighteen months of\r\nuseless efforts we should recognise that we had been mistaken, and\r\nthat we should then apply to France; that this Power would then\r\nco-operate to settle these matters upon a friendly basis with as much\r\nfriendliness after our failure as she would have shown before our\r\nattempt, and that she would then probably persuade us to agree to\r\nconditions to which we refused our consent at the moment.\r\n\r\nSimilar indications were given to M. Guizot with regard to the line\r\nwhich would probably be taken by the four Powers if they were\r\nunsuccessful in coming to an arrangement with France. The French\r\nGovernment has therefore refused the ultimatum of the four Powers, and\r\nby the act of refusal has enounced afresh a principle of action which\r\nit knew could not be adopted by the four Powers: a principle which\r\nconsisted in the idea that no settlement of the difficulties between\r\nthe Sultan and his subject could take place except under conditions\r\nwhich the subject could accept voluntarily, or, in other terms, could\r\ndictate; hence, the French Government must have been prepared to see\r\nthe four Powers determined to act apart from France; and when the four\r\nPowers had come to this determination, they could not be represented\r\nas breaking with France, or as excluding France from the arrangement\r\nof a war to be carried on by Europe. On the contrary, it was France\r\nwho broke with the four Powers, for it was France who laid down for\r\nherself a principle of action which made co-operation with the other\r\nPowers impossible.\r\n\r\nAt this point, without attempting further controversial observations\r\nwith reference to the past, I feel obliged to point out that the\r\nvoluntary retirement on the part of France was not entirely due to the\r\ncourse of negotiations at London, but that, unless Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment has been strangely misled, it was decided even more\r\ndefinitely in the course of negotiations at Constantinople. The five\r\nPowers declared to the Sultan by a Collective Note, which was handed\r\nto the Porte on July 27, 1839, by their representatives at\r\nConstantinople, that their unanimity was complete, and these\r\nrepresentatives requested the Porte to refrain from any direct\r\nnegotiations with Mehemet Ali, and to make no arrangement with the\r\nPasha without the concurrence of the five Powers. However, Her\r\nMajesty's Government has good reason to believe that during the last\r\nfew months the French representative at Constantinople has decisively\r\nisolated France from the other four Powers, and has energetically and\r\nrepeatedly pressed the Porte to negotiate directly with Mehemet Ali,\r\nand to conclude an arrangement with the Pasha, not only without the\r\nconcurrence of the four great Powers, but under the mediation of\r\nFrance alone, and in accordance with the special views of the French\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAs regards the line of conduct followed by Great Britain, the French\r\nGovernment must recognise that the views and opinions of Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment have never varied, from the outset of these negotiations,\r\nexcept in so far as Her Majesty's Government has offered to modify its\r\nviews with the object of securing the co-operation of France. These\r\nviews have been from time to time frankly expressed to the French\r\nGovernment, and have been continually supported in the most urgent\r\nmanner by arguments which seemed conclusive to Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment. From the very outset of the negotiations, the declarations\r\nof principle made by the French Government induced Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment to believe that the two Governments had only to agree upon\r\nthe means of carrying out their common principles. If the intentions\r\nof the French Government concerning these means differed from the\r\nviews of England even at the outset of the negotiations, France has\r\ncertainly not the right to refer to the difference between France and\r\nEngland as unexpected, seeing that the French Government recognised\r\nits existence a long time previously. If the intentions of the French\r\nGovernment with regard to the measures to be taken have undergone a\r\nchange since the opening of negotiations, France certainly has not\r\nthe right to impute to Great Britain a change of political intention\r\nwhich proceeds from France, and not from England.\r\n\r\nBut in any case, when four out of five Powers have agreed upon a\r\ndefinite line of conduct, and when the fifth has resolved to pursue an\r\nentirely different policy, it would be unreasonable to require the\r\nfour to abandon, in deference to the fifth, opinions to which they are\r\ndaily more resolved to adhere and which refer to a question of vital\r\nimportance for the chief and future interests of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut as France continues to maintain the general principles which she\r\nlaid down at the outset and continues to consider the maintenance of\r\nthe integrity and independence of the Turkish Empire as necessary to\r\npreserve the balance of power; as again France has never refused to\r\nadmit that the arrangement which the four Powers wished to introduce\r\nbetween the Sultan and the Pasha would be the best solution if it\r\ncould be secured, and as again the objections of France referred not\r\nto the object proposed but to the means by which it is to be gained,\r\nher opinion being that the end is good, but that the means are\r\ninadequate and dangerous; Her Majesty's Government is confident that\r\nthe isolation of France, which no one regrets more than Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment, will not be of long duration.\r\n\r\nWhen the four Powers, in concert with the Sultan, have succeeded in\r\nintroducing an arrangement of this nature between the Porte and his\r\nsubjects, there will then be no further point of disagreement between\r\nFrance and her allies, nor will there be any obstacle to prevent\r\nFrance from undertaking with the other Powers such engagements for the\r\nfuture as may seem necessary to secure the good results of an\r\nintervention by the four Powers in favour of the Sultan, and to\r\npreserve the Ottoman Empire from any recurrence of the dangers to\r\nwhich it is exposed.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government impatiently awaits the moment when France\r\nwill be able to resume her position in the concert of the Powers and\r\ntrusts that that moment will be accelerated in the interests of the\r\nfull development of the moral influence of France. Although the French\r\nGovernment, for reasons of its own, has refused to participate in the\r\ncoercive measures to be employed against Mehemet Ali, this Government\r\ncertainly cannot object to the employment of such measures with the\r\nobject of inducing the Pasha to submit to the arrangements which are\r\nto be placed before him, and it is obvious that more than one argument\r\nmight be adduced and that more than one prudential consideration might\r\nbe urged upon the Pasha with more efficacy by France as a neutral\r\nPower and a non-participant in this affair, than by the four Powers\r\nwhich are actively engaged in the prosecution of coercive measures.\r\n\r\nIn any case Her Majesty's Government is confident that Europe will\r\nrecognise the justice of the proposal which has been put forward by\r\nthe four Powers, for their purpose is just and disinterested. They are\r\nnot seeking to gather any advantage for themselves or to establish any\r\nexclusive sphere of influence, or to acquire any territory, and the\r\nobject which they have in view should be as profitable to France as to\r\nthemselves, because France, like themselves, is interested in the\r\nmaintenance of the balance of power and in the preservation of the\r\ngeneral peace.\r\n\r\nYou will send officially to M. Thiers a copy of this despatch.\r\n\r\n    I am, &c.,\r\n\r\n    (Signed)      PALMERSTON.\r\n\r\n(From the _Journal des Débats_ of October 2.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n_Manifesto to the Spanish Nation._\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANIARDS,\r\n\r\nAs I left the soil of Spain in a day of grief and bitterness for me,\r\nmy streaming eyes were turned to heaven in prayer that the God of\r\nmercy would shed His grace and His blessing upon us.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached a foreign land, the first need of my soul and the first\r\nthought of my heart was to raise my voice in friendship, the voice\r\nwith which I have ever spoken to you with a sense of unspeakable\r\ntenderness, both in good and bad fortune.\r\n\r\nAlone, abandoned, and a prey to the deepest grief, my only consolation\r\nin this great misfortune is to open my heart to God and to you, to my\r\nfather and to my children.\r\n\r\nThink not that I shall be satisfied with lamentations and barren\r\nrecriminations, or that, to explain my conduct as Queen-Regent of the\r\nrealm, I shall attempt to excite your passions; on the contrary, I\r\nhave done everything to calm them and would gladly see them at rest.\r\nThe language of self-restraint alone is consonant with my affection,\r\nmy dignity, and my glory.\r\n\r\nWhen I left my country to seek another home in Spanish hearts, rumour\r\nhad informed me of your great exploits and your high qualities. I knew\r\nthat in every age you had leaped forward to the combat with the\r\nnoblest and most generous ardour to defend the throne of your\r\nSovereigns; that you had defended it at the price of your blood, and\r\nthat in days of glorious memory you had deserved well of your country\r\nand of Europe. I then swore to devote myself to the happiness of a\r\nnation which had shed its blood to break the captivity of its Kings.\r\nThe Almighty heard my oath, your manifestations of joy showed me that\r\nyou were conscious of it, and my conscience tells me that I have kept\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen your King, upon the brink of the tomb, dropped the reins of State\r\nfrom his failing grasp and placed them in my hands, my gaze fell\r\nalternately upon my husband, my daughter's cradle, and the Spanish\r\nnation, thus uniting the three objects of my love in order to\r\nrecommend them to the protection of heaven in one prayer. My painful\r\nexperiences as mother and wife while my husband's life and my\r\ndaughter's throne were endangered could not distract me from my duties\r\nas Queen: at my voice universities were opened; at my voice\r\nlong-standing abuses disappeared and useful reforms, wisely\r\nconsidered, were brought forward; at my voice those who had sought in\r\nvain a home as exiles and wanderers in foreign lands, returned to\r\ntheir hearths and homes. Your joyous enthusiasm at these solemn acts\r\nof justice and mercy could only be compared to the extent of the grief\r\nand the depth of bitterness to which I was abandoned; for myself I\r\nreserved all sadness, and for you, Spaniards, all joy.\r\n\r\nAt a later date, when God had called my august husband to Himself, who\r\nleft the government of the whole realm in my hands, I strove to guide\r\nthe State as a merciful Queen-Regent (_justiciera_). During the short\r\nperiod which elapsed since my elevation to power until the convocation\r\nof the first Cortes, my power was unique, but it was not despotic, or\r\nabsolute, or arbitrary, for it was limited by my will. The most\r\ndignified people in the realm and the Council of Government, which I\r\nwas bound to consult by the last wishes of my august husband upon all\r\nmatters of grave import, pointed out to me that public opinion\r\ndemanded other guarantees from me as the repository of the sovereign\r\npower. I gave those guarantees, and freely and spontaneously convoked\r\nthe chiefs of the nation and the procuradores of the realm.\r\n\r\nI granted the royal statute and I have not infringed it. If others\r\nhave trampled it under foot, they must be responsible for their\r\nactions before God, who holds laws sacred.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of 1837 was accepted by me, and I took the oath to\r\nit; to avoid infringement of it, I then made the last and greatest of\r\nsacrifices--I laid down the sceptre and I was forced to abandon my\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nIn referring to the events which have brought these cruel tribulations\r\nupon me, I shall speak to you as my dignity demands, with\r\nself-restraint and in words well weighed.\r\n\r\nI was served by responsible Ministers, who were supported by the\r\nCortes. I accepted their resignation, which was imperiously demanded\r\nby a revolt at Barcelona; then began a crisis which was only concluded\r\nby the renunciation which I signed at Valencia. During this deplorable\r\nperiod, the municipality of Madrid revolted against my authority, an\r\nexample followed by other important towns. The rebels insisted that I\r\nshould condemn the conduct of Ministers who had loyally served me;\r\nthat I should recognise the movement as legitimate; that I should\r\nannul, or at any rate suspend, the law of municipalities which I had\r\nsanctioned, after it had been voted by the Cortes; and that I should\r\nendanger the unity of the Regency.\r\n\r\nI could not accept the first of these conditions without entire loss\r\nof self-respect; I could not accede to the second without recognising\r\nthe right of force, a right recognised neither by divine nor human\r\nlaws, and the existence of which is incompatible with the\r\nConstitution, as it is incompatible with all Constitutions; I could\r\nnot accept the third condition without infringing the Constitution,\r\nwhich regards as law any measure voted by the Cortes and sanctioned by\r\nthe supreme head of the State, and which places a law once sanctioned\r\nbeyond the sphere of the royal authority; I could not accept the\r\nfourth condition without accepting my own disgrace, passing\r\ncondemnation upon myself and undermining the power which the King had\r\nleft me and which the Chambers of the Cortes had afterwards confirmed,\r\nand which was preserved by me as a sacred possession which I had sworn\r\nnever to surrender to the hands of factious men.\r\n\r\nMy firmness in resisting that which I could not accept in the face of\r\nmy duty, my oaths and the dearest interests of the monarchy, has\r\nbrought down upon the defenceless woman, whose voice now speaks to\r\nyou, a series of griefs and sufferings which no human language could\r\nexpress. You will not have forgotten, Spaniards, how I carried my\r\nmisfortunes from city to city, insulted and affronted everywhere, for\r\none of those decrees of God which are a mystery to man, has permitted\r\ninjustice and ingratitude to prevail. Doubtless for that reason the\r\nsmall number of those who hated me were emboldened to insult me, while\r\nthe large number of those who loved me had so far lost courage as to\r\noffer me nothing but silent compassion as a testimony of their\r\naffection. There were some who offered me their swords, but I did not\r\naccept their offer, preferring martyrdom in isolation to the certain\r\nprospect of reading one day a new list of martyrs who had fallen\r\nvictims to their loyalty. I might have stirred up a civil war, but\r\ncivil war could not be aroused by myself, who have just given you the\r\npeace that my heart desired, a peace cemented by forgetfulness of the\r\npast; my mother's eyes turned away from so dreadful a prospect; I told\r\nmyself that when children are ungrateful a mother must endure to\r\ndeath, but that she must not stir up war between them.\r\n\r\nDays elapsed in this dreadful condition of affairs; I saw my sceptre\r\nbecome merely a useless reed and my diadem a crown of thorns. At\r\nlength my strength failed; I laid aside my sceptre and my crown to\r\nbreathe the air of freedom; an unhappy victim but with a calm brow, a\r\nclear conscience, and a soul without remorse.\r\n\r\nSuch, Spaniards, has been my conduct. I offer you this account of it\r\nthat it may not be stained by calumny, and in so doing I have\r\nperformed the last of my duties. She who was your Queen asks nothing\r\nmore of you than that you will love her daughter and honour her\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nMarseilles, November 8, 1840.\r\n\r\n    (Signed)      MARIA CHRISTINA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL INDEX\r\n\r\n[The names followed by an asterisk (*) have been already noted in more\r\ndetail in the Biographical Index of vol.
