To understand\r\nthe exploits of Wellington’s men, it does not suffice to read a mere\r\nchronicle of their marches and battles. I have endeavoured to collect\r\nin these pages notices of those aspects of their life with which no\r\nstrategical or tactical work can deal, though tactics and even strategy\r\nwill not be found unnoticed.\r\n\r\nMy special thanks are due to my friend Mr. C. T. Atkinson, Fellow of\r\nExeter College, Oxford, for allowing me to use the admirable list of\r\nthe brigade and divisional organization of the Peninsular Army which\r\nforms Appendix II. It is largely expanded from the article on the same\r\ntopic which he printed eight years ago in the _Historical Review_, and\r\nenables the reader to find out the precise composition of every one of\r\nWellington’s units at any moment between April, 1808 and April, 1814.\r\nI have also to express my gratitude to the Hon. John Fortescue, the\r\nauthor of the great _History of the British Army_, for answering a good\r\nmany queries which I should have found hard to solve without his aid.\r\nThe index is by the same loving hand which has worked on so many of my\r\nearlier volumes.\r\n\r\n            C.

Roughly speaking,\r\nthese notes relate either to the personal characteristics of that\r\nfamous old army of Wellington, which, as he himself said, “could go\r\nanywhere and do anything,” or to its inner mechanism—the details of its\r\nmanagement. I purpose to speak in these pages of the leaders and the\r\nled; of the daily life, manners, and customs of the Peninsular Army,\r\nas much as of its composition and its organization. I shall be dealing\r\nwith the rank and file no less than with the officers, and must even\r\nfind space for a few pages on that curious and polyglot horde of camp\r\nfollowers which trailed at the heels of the army, and frequently raised\r\nproblems which worried not only colonels and adjutants, but even the\r\nGreat Duke himself.\r\n\r\nThere is an immense amount of interesting material to be collected,\r\nconcerning the inner life of the Peninsular Army, from public\r\ndocuments, such as despatches, general orders, and regimental reports,\r\nand records of courts martial. But I shall be utilizing to a much\r\ngreater extent non-official information, collected from the countless\r\ndiaries, memoirs, and series of contemporary letters, which have come\r\ndown to us from the men who took part in the great war. Nor are the\r\ncontroversial pamphlets to be neglected, which kept appearing for\r\nmany a year, when one survivor of the old army found, in the writings\r\nof another, statements which he considered injurious to himself, his\r\nfriends, his regiment, or his division. The best known and most copious\r\nof these discussions is that which centres round the publication of\r\nNapier’s _Peninsular War_; the successive appearance of its volumes led\r\nto the printing of many protests, in which some of the most prominent\r\nofficers of Wellington’s army took part—not only Lord Beresford,\r\nwho was Napier’s especial butt and _bête noir_, and replied to the\r\nhistorian in terms sometimes not too dignified—but Cole, Hardinge,\r\nD’Urban, and many more. This set of “strictures”, as they were called,\r\nmainly relate to the Albuera campaign. But there are smaller, but not\r\nless interesting, series of controversial pamphlets relating to the\r\nConvention of Cintra, to Moore’s retreat, to the campaign of 1810\r\n(Bussaco), the storm of Badajoz, and other topics.\r\n\r\nThe memoirs and autobiographies, of course, possess the greatest share\r\nof interest. And it may be noted as a remarkable fact that those\r\ncoming from the rank and file are not very much less numerous than\r\nthose which come from the commissioned ranks. If there are scores\r\nof diaries and reminiscences of colonels, captains, and subalterns,\r\nthere are at least dozens of little books by sergeants, corporals, and\r\nprivates. Many of these are very quaint productions indeed, printed\r\nat local presses—at Perth, Coventry, Cirencester, Louth, Ashford—even\r\nat Corfu. Very frequently some knot of military or civilian friends\r\ninduced a much-travelled veteran to commit to paper the tales which had\r\nbeen the delight of the canteen, or of the fireside of some village\r\ninn. They are generally very good reading, but often give rather the\r\nspirit of the time and the regiment than an accurate record of its\r\nlong-past exploits. One or two of these veterans’ artless tales show\r\nall the characteristics of the memoirs of the prince of their tribe—the\r\ndelightful but autolatrous Marbot. I have thought it worth while to\r\ngive in an appendix the names and titles of the best of them. One\r\nor two, above all the little book of “Rifleman Harris” of the 95th,\r\nwell deserve to be republished, but still await that honour. Perhaps\r\nregimental patriotism may some day provide us with a series of reprints\r\nof the best Soldiers’ Tales.[1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Memoirs of the Rank and File]\r\n\r\nIt is a very notable fact, which requires (but has never hitherto\r\nreceived) an explanation, that it is precisely with the coming in of\r\nthe nineteenth century that British soldiers and officers alike began\r\nto write diaries and reminiscences on a large scale, and in great\r\nnumbers. I do not, of course, mean to say that there were none such\r\nproduced in the eighteenth century. Besides serious military histories\r\nlike those of Kane, Stedman, or Tarleton, there do exist a certain\r\nnumber of narratives of personal adventure written by officers, such\r\nas Major Rogers the Scout, or the garrulous and often amusing diarist\r\n(unfortunately anonymous) who made the campaign of Culloden with\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland—not to speak of the semi-apochryphal Captain\r\nCarleton. But they are few, and the writings from the ranks are fewer\r\nstill, though there are certain soldiers’ letters which go back as far\r\nas Marlborough’s time, and one or two small books like Bristow’s and\r\nScurry’s Indian reminiscences, and Sergeant Lamb’s _Journal_ in the\r\nAmerican War of Independence, which are worth mentioning. But it is\r\nquite certain that there was more writing going on in the army during\r\nthe ten years 1805–1815 than in the whole eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nWhat was the explanation of the phenomenon? There are, I think, two\r\nmain causes to be borne in mind: the first was the glorious and\r\ninspiring character of Wellington’s campaigns, which made both officers\r\nand men justifiably proud of themselves, and more anxious than any\r\nprevious generation had been to put on paper the tale of their own\r\nexploits. It must have been a man of particularly cheerful disposition\r\nwho cared to compile the personal narrative of his adventures during\r\nthe Old American War, which was largely a record of disaster, or\r\neven in the ups and downs of the Seven Years’ War, when for every\r\nMinden or Quebec there had been an evil memory like Ticonderoga\r\nor Kloster-Kampen. It is to this instinctive dislike to open up\r\nold memories of misfortune that we may attribute the fact that the\r\nfirst British campaigns of the French Revolutionary War, the unhappy\r\nmarches and battles of the Duke of York’s army in 1793, 1794, 1795 are\r\nrecorded in singularly few books of reminiscences—there are only (to my\r\nknowledge) the doggerel verse of the “Officer of the Guards,” with its\r\nvaluable foot-notes, and the simple memoirs of Sergeant Stevenson of\r\nthe Scots Fusilier Guards, and Corporal Brown of the Coldstream. This\r\nis an extraordinarily small output for a long series of campaigns, in\r\nwhich some 30,000 British troops were in the field, and where gallant\r\nexploits like those of Famars and Villers-en-Cauchies took place. But\r\nthe general tale was not one on which any participant could look back\r\nwith pleasure. Hence, no doubt, the want of books of reminiscences.\r\n\r\nBut I fancy that there is another and a quite distinct cause for the\r\nextraordinary outburst of interesting military literature with which\r\nthe nineteenth century begins, and we may note that this outburst\r\ncertainly commences a little before the Peninsular War. There exist\r\nseveral very good personal narratives both of the Conquest of Egypt\r\nin 1801, of the Indian Wars during the Viceroyalty of Lord Wellesley,\r\nand of the short campaign of Maida. And this cause I take to be the\r\nfact that the generation which grew up under the stress of the long\r\nRevolutionary War with France was far more serious and intelligent\r\nthan that which saw it begin, and realized the supreme importance\r\nof the ends for which Great Britain was contending, and the danger\r\nwhich threatened her national existence. The empire had been in danger\r\nbefore, both in the Seven Years’ War, and in the War of American\r\nIndependence, but the enemy had never been so terrifying and abhorrent\r\nas the Jacobins of the Red Republic. The France of Robespierre was\r\nloathed and feared as the France of Louis XV. or Louis XVI. had never\r\nbeen. To the greater part of the British nation the war against the\r\nRevolution soon became a kind of Crusade against the “triple-headed\r\nmonster of Republicanism, Atheism, and Sedition.” The feeling that\r\nGreat Britain had to fight not so much for empire as for national\r\nexistence, and for all that made life worth having—religion, morality,\r\nconstitution, laws, liberty—made men desperately keen for the fight, as\r\ntheir ancestors had never been.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sword and the Pen]\r\n\r\nAmong the many aspects which their keenness took, one was most\r\ncertainly the desire to record their own personal part in the great\r\nstrife. It is in some such way only that I can explain the fact that\r\nthe actually contemporary diaries and journals become so good as the\r\nwar wears on, compared to anything that had gone before. Memoirs and\r\nreminiscences written later do not count in the argument, because they\r\nwere compiled and printed long after the French war was over, and its\r\ngreatness was understood. But the abundance of good material written\r\ndown (and often sent to the press) during the continuance of the war\r\nis astounding. In some cases we can be sure that we owe the record\r\nto the reason that I have just suggested. For example, we certainly\r\nowe to it the long and interesting military diaries of Lord Lynedoch\r\n(the Sir Thomas Graham of Barrosa), who most decidedly went into the\r\nRevolutionary War as a Crusader and nothing less. As I shall explain\r\nwhen dealing with his remarkable career, he started military life at\r\nforty-four, mortgaging his estates to raise a battalion, and suddenly\r\nfrom a Whig M.P. of the normal type developed into a persistent and\r\nconscientious fighter against France and French ideas—whether they were\r\nexpressed (as when first he drew the sword) in the frenzied antics of\r\nthe Jacobins, or (as during his latter years) in the grinding despotism\r\nof Bonaparte. His diary from first to last is the record of one who\r\nfeels that he is discharging the elementary duty of a good citizen, by\r\ndoing his best to beat the French wherever they may be found.\r\n\r\nI take it that the same idea was at the bottom of the heart of many a\r\nman of lesser note, who kept his pen busy during those twenty eventful\r\nyears. Some frankly say that they went into the service, contrary to\r\nthe original scheme of their life, because they saw the danger to the\r\nstate, and were ready to take their part in meeting it. “The threat of\r\ninvasion fired every loyal pair of shoulders for a red coat.”[2]\r\n\r\nOf the men whose memoirs and letters I have read, some would have\r\nbeen lawyers (like Sir Hussey Vivian), others politicians, others\r\ndoctors, others civil servants, others merchants, if the Great War\r\nhad not broken out. I should imagine that the proportion of officers\r\nwho had taken their commission for other reasons than that they had\r\nan old family connection with the army, or loved adventure, was\r\ninfinitely higher during this period than it had ever been before. A\r\nvery appreciable number of them were men with a strong religious turn—a\r\nthing I imagine to have been most unusual in the army of the eighteenth\r\ncentury (though we must not forget Colonel Gardiner). One young diarist\r\nheads the journal of his first campaign with a long prayer.[3] Another\r\nstarts for the front with a final letter to his relatives to the effect\r\nthat “while striving to discharge his military duties he will never\r\nforget his religious ones: he who observes the former and disregards\r\nthe latter is no better than a civilized brute.”[4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Men of Religion]\r\n\r\nThere were Peninsular officers who led prayer-meetings and founded\r\nreligious societies—not entirely to the delight of the Duke of\r\nWellington,[5] whose own very dry and official view of religion was as\r\nintolerant of “enthusiasm” as that of any Whig bishop of Mid-Georgian\r\ntimes. Some of the most interesting diaries of the war are those of\r\nmen who like Gleig, Dallas, and Boothby, took Holy Orders when the\r\nstrife came to an end. One or two of the authors from the ranks show\r\nthe same tendencies. Quartermaster Surtees was undergoing the agonies\r\nof a very painful conversion, during the campaign of 1812, and found\r\nthat the memories of his spiritual experiences had blunted and dulled\r\nhis recollection of his regimental fortunes during that time.[6]\r\nA very curious book by an Irish sergeant of the 43rd devotes many\r\nmore pages to religious reflections than to marches and bivouacs.[7]\r\nAnother writer of the same type describes himself on his title-page\r\nas “Twenty-one years in the British Foot Guards, sixteen years a\r\nnon-commissioned officer, forty years a Wesleyan class leader, once\r\nwounded, and two years a Prisoner.”[8]\r\n\r\nOn the whole I am inclined to attribute the great improvement alike\r\nin the quantity and the quality of the information which we possess\r\nas to the inner life of the army, during the second half of the great\r\nstruggle with France, not only to the fact that the danger to the\r\nempire and the great interests at stake had fired the imagination of\r\nmany a participant, but still more to the other fact that the body of\r\nofficers contained a much larger proportion of thoughtful and serious\r\nmen than it had ever done before. And the same was the case _mutatis\r\nmutandis_ with the rank and file also. Not but what—of course—some\r\nof the most interesting information is supplied to us by cheerful and\r\ngarrulous rattlepates of a very different type, who had been attracted\r\ninto the service by the adventure of the soldier’s life, and record\r\nmainly its picturesque or its humorous side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF INFORMATION—THE LITERATURE OF THE PENINSULAR WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be well, perhaps, to give a short account of the main sources\r\nfrom which our knowledge of the Peninsular Army is derived. The\r\nofficial ones must be cited first. The most important of all are,\r\nnaturally enough, the Wellington Dispatches. Of these there are two\r\nseries; the first, in twelve volumes, was published during the Duke’s\r\nlifetime by Colonel Gurwood between 1837 and 1839. The second, or\r\nsupplementary series, in fifteen volumes, was published with copious\r\nnotes by the second Duke of Wellington between 1858 and 1872.\r\n\r\nThe series edited by Gurwood is absolutely necessary to every student\r\nof the Peninsular War, but is most tiresome to handle, and is by no\r\nmeans complete. The Duke forbade the publication of a great number\r\nof his more confidential letters, and ordered portions of others to\r\nbe omitted. He had a strong notion that a great deal of historical\r\ninformation could be, and ought to be, suppressed; this fact has caused\r\nmuch trouble to the modern historian, who wishes to obtain not a mere\r\nofficial and expurgated view of the war, but a full and complete survey\r\nof it. To show Wellington’s attitude it may be sufficient to quote\r\nhis answer to William Napier, who asked for leave to utilize all his\r\npapers. “He could not tell the whole truth without hurting the feelings\r\nof many worthy men, and without doing mischief. Expatiating on the\r\nsubject, he related many anecdotes illustrating this observation,\r\nshowing errors committed by generals and others—especially at\r\nWaterloo—errors so materially affecting his operations that he could\r\nnot do justice to himself if he suppressed them, and yet by giving them\r\npublicity he would ungraciously affect the favour of many worthy men,\r\nwhose only fault was dullness.”[9]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gurwood and the Duke’s Dispatches]\r\n\r\nThe Gurwood edition of the dispatches was published some fifteen\r\nyears after Napier made his application, but numbers of the old\r\nPeninsular officers were still alive, and the Duke adhered to his\r\nalready-expressed opinion that it would not be well to expose old\r\nquarrels and old blunders. Paragraphs, accordingly, are often omitted\r\nin the reprint, and in a large majority of cases, where blame was\r\nimputed or reproofs administered to any individual, the name was\r\nleft blank. This makes the edition most tiresome to read. It is\r\nexasperating to find that _e.g._ “nothing has given me more concern in\r\nthe late operations than the conduct of Lieut.-Colonel —— of the ——\r\nRegt.”[10] or that “no means exists of punishing military disorders\r\nand irregularities of the kind committed by Brigadier-General ——\r\nand Colonel ——.” Or again, when Wellington writes to the Patronage\r\nSecretary at the Horse Guards that “I am much obliged to you for\r\nrelieving me from Major-General —— and Colonel ——. I have seen General\r\n—— and I think he will do very well, and so will ——”[11]; or that “——\r\nappears to be a kind of madman,” and “—— is not very wise,” the reader\r\nis reduced to despair. The only way of discovering the names, which\r\nare often those of officers of high rank, who figure repeatedly in any\r\nnarrative of the Peninsular War, is to go to the original dispatches\r\nat the Record Office, or, when the communication is a private and not\r\na public one, to the letters at Apsley House. Meanwhile, few have the\r\nleisure or the patience to do this, so that Wellington’s judgments on\r\nhis lieutenants are still practically inaccessible.\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, still necessary to leave all these blanks in 1837.\r\nAnd Gurwood was no doubt acting in strict obedience to the Duke’s\r\norders. But nothing can excuse his own slack editing of the massive\r\ntomes that he published. There are no tables of contents to the\r\nvolumes, nor does the title page of each indicate the dates between\r\nwhich it runs. To find out which volume will contain a letter of\r\nNovember, 1810, we must take down Vols. VI. and VII., and see from the\r\ndate of the last dispatch in one and the first in the other, when the\r\nbreak comes. Supposing we wish to discover how many communications were\r\nsent to Graham or Spencer in 1811, there is no other way of achieving\r\nour object than running through every page of the two volumes in which\r\nthe correspondence of that year is contained! There is a so-called\r\nindex to the whole series, but it is practically useless, from the\r\nsmall number of headings given. The reader will look in it vainly for\r\nobvious places-names such as Chaves, Casal Novo, Castello Branco,\r\nVera, St. Pierre, for personal names such as Lapisse, Latour-Maubourg,\r\nBonnet, Montbrun, Abadia, Penne-Villemur, O’Donnell, Del Parque,\r\nErskine, Anson, Victor Alten, Barnard, Beckwith. On the other hand he\r\nwill find silly headings such as under L, “Lies, encouragement of,” or\r\nunder I, “Invincibility of British Troops.” Perhaps the most ridiculous\r\nentry in this absurd compilation is that of “Light Division,” to which\r\nthere is annexed just one note, “satisfactory conduct of, on April\r\n6, 1811,” as if that was the sole occasion on which it was necessary\r\nto mention that distinguished unit of the British army. There are no\r\nheadings under regiments at all, so that if one wishes to see what the\r\nDuke said about the 52nd or the Black Watch, one simply gets no help.\r\n\r\nBut there is another trick of Gurwood’s which is even worse than his\r\nwant of tables of contents or adequate index-entries. He omitted all\r\nthe elaborate statistics which used to accompany the Duke’s dispatches,\r\nwithout exception. The beautiful tables of casualties which explain\r\nthe distribution of losses between regiments and divisions, are in\r\nevery case boiled down into three bald totals of “killed, wounded,\r\nand missing,” for the whole army, no indication of units being\r\nleft. Even Lord Londonderry’s modest two volumes, the first attempt\r\nat a general history of the Peninsular War, give far more useful\r\ninformation on the all-important topics of strengths and losses than\r\nall Gurwood’s tomes. For that sensible author rightly saw that nothing\r\ncould be more serviceable to the reader than an occasional table of\r\nthe organization and numbers of the whole allied army, and that the\r\ndetailed casualty-list of such a fight as Talavera or Albuera is\r\nindispensable. The purblind Gurwood preferred to put in a note, “the\r\ndetail of divisions, regiments, and battalions has been omitted, being\r\ntoo voluminous,”[12] when he was dealing with an important return. The\r\nhistorian owes him small thanks for his precious opinion.\r\n\r\nIt is an immense relief to pass from Gurwood’s ill-arranged work to\r\nthe volumes of the _Wellington Supplementary Dispatches_, which were\r\npublished by the second Duke between 1858 and 1872. Though the mass of\r\nPeninsular material contained in this series is comparatively small,\r\nit comprises a great quantity of familiar and private correspondence,\r\nwhich had been deliberately omitted from the earlier publication.\r\nAnd, moreover, it is admirably edited; the second Duke knew what was\r\nimportant and what required explanation, appended valuable and copious\r\nnotes, and was able (since the elder generation was now practically\r\nextinct) to abandon the exasperating reticence used by Gurwood.\r\nMoreover, he added a vast quantity of letters written not by, but to,\r\nhis father, which serve to explain the old Duke’s sometime cryptic\r\nreplies to his correspondents. Even a few necessary French documents\r\nhave been added. Altogether these volumes are excellent, and make one\r\nwish that the editing of the whole of the Wellington papers had fallen\r\ninto the same hands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington’s “General Orders”]\r\n\r\nThere is a third series of Official publications which though not\r\nso “generally necessary for salvation” as the Dispatches, for any\r\nstudent of the Peninsular War, is very valuable and needs continually\r\nto be worked up. This is the seven volumes of _General Orders_, from\r\n1809 to 1815, which are strictly contemporary documents, as they were\r\ncollected and issued while the war was in progress—the 1809–10 volumes\r\nwere printed in 1811, the 1811 volume in 1812, and so on. The last, or\r\nWaterloo volume, had the distinction of being issued by the British\r\nMilitary Press in Paris, “by Sergeant Buchan, 3rd Guards,” as printer.\r\nThe _General Orders_ contain not only all the documents strictly so\r\ncalled, the notices issued by the commander-in-chief for the army, but\r\nan invaluable _précis_ of all courts-martial other than regimental\r\nones, and a record of promotions, gazettings of officers to regiments,\r\nrules as to issue of pay and rations, and directions as to all matters\r\nof detail relating to organization, hospitals, depôts, stores, routes,\r\netc. If any one wishes to know on what day the 42nd was moved from\r\nthe first to the second division, when precisely General Craufurd got\r\nleave to go home on private business, what was the accepted value of\r\nthe Spanish dollar or the Portuguese Cruzado Novo at different dates,\r\nwhen expressed in English money, or what was the bounty given when a\r\ntime-expired man consented to renew his service for a limited period,\r\nthese are the volumes in which he will find his curiosity satisfied.\r\nThey cannot be called interesting reading—but they contain facts not\r\nelsewhere to be found.\r\n\r\nThere is an exactly corresponding series of General Orders for the\r\nPortuguese Army, in six yearly volumes, called _Ordens do Dia_: it was\r\nissued by Marshal Beresford, and contains all the documents signed\r\nby him. Whenever a student is interested in the career of one of the\r\nnumerous British officers in the Portuguese service, he must seek out\r\nthe records of his doings in these volumes. They are not easy to work\r\nin, as they have no yearly indices, and much patience is required to\r\ndiscover isolated notices of individuals. These volumes are practically\r\ninaccessible in England. It was with the greatest difficulty that a\r\nLisbon friend hunted me up a copy after long search, and I am not\r\naware that there is another on this side of the sea. But by its\r\nuse only can we trace the service of any Anglo-Portuguese officer.\r\nThere was supposed to be an “Ordem” every morning, and when nothing\r\nwas forthcoming in the way of promotions, court-martial reports, or\r\ndecrees, Beresford’s chief of the staff used to publish a solemn\r\nstatement that there was no news, as thus—\r\n\r\n                Quartel-General de Chamusca, 7. 1. 1811.\r\n                             Nada de novo.\r\n                      _Adjudante-General_ Mosinho.\r\n\r\nThis happened on an average about twice a week.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these printed series there is an immense amount of\r\nunprinted official correspondence in the Record Office which bears\r\non the Peninsular War. It will be found not only in the War Office\r\nsection, but in those belonging to the Foreign Office and the\r\nAdmiralty. As an example of the mysteries of official classification, I\r\nmay mention that all documents relating to French prisoners will have\r\nto be looked for among the Admiralty records, under the sub-headings\r\n_Transport_ and _Medical_. If, as occasionally happens, one wishes to\r\nfind out the names and regiments of French officers captured on some\r\nparticular occasion, _e.g._ Soult’s retreat from Oporto, or the storm\r\nof Badajoz, it is to the Admiralty records that one must go! Officers\r\ncan always be identified, but it is a herculean task to deal with the\r\nrank and file, for they used to be shot into one of the great prisons,\r\nNorman’s Cross, Porchester, Stapleton, etc., in arbitrary batches, with\r\nno regard to their regimental numbers. It would take a week to hunt\r\nthrough the prison records with the object of identifying the number\r\nof privates of the 34th Léger captured at Rodrigo, since they may have\r\ngone in small parties to any one of a dozen destinations. Many of the\r\nprison registers have lost one or other of their outer-boards, and the\r\nhandling of them is a grimy business for the fingers, since they are\r\npractically never consulted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Record Office and its Wealth]\r\n\r\nWhile nearly the whole of the Wellington dispatches have been printed,\r\nit is only a small part of the Duke’s “enclosures”, added to each\r\ndispatch, that have had the same good fortune. These always repay\r\na cursory inspection, and are often highly important. The greater\r\npart of Sir John Moore’s correspondence with Lord Castlereagh, and\r\nmany dispatches of Moore’s subordinates—Baird, Leith, and Lord W.\r\nBentinck—with a number of valuable returns and statistics,—are printed\r\nin a large volume entitled “_Papers Relative to Spain and Portugal,\r\nPresented to Parliament in 1809_.” There are, to the best of my\r\nknowledge, no similar volumes relating to Graham’s campaign from Cadiz\r\nin 1811, or Maitland’s and Murray’s operations on the east side of\r\nSpain in 1813–14. A good deal of information about the latter, however,\r\nmay be got from the enormous report of the court-martial on Murray,\r\nfor his wretched _fiasco_ at the siege of Tarragona, which is full of\r\nvaluable facts. The details of the other minor British enterprises\r\nin the Peninsula—such as those of Doyle, Skerret, Sir Home Popham,\r\nand Lord Blayney, all remain in manuscript,—readily accessible to the\r\nsearcher, but not too often consulted. The Foreign Office section\r\nat the Record Office is highly valuable not only to the historian\r\nof diplomacy, but to the purely military historian, because Stuart,\r\nVaughan, Henry Wellesley, and the other representatives of the British\r\nGovernment at Madrid, Seville, and Cadiz, used to send home, along with\r\ntheir own dispatches, numberless Spanish documents. These include not\r\nonly official papers from the Regency, but private documents of great\r\nvalue, letters from generals and statesmen who wish to keep the British\r\nagent informed as to their views, when they have clashed with the\r\nresolves of their own government. There are quite a number of military\r\nnarratives by Spanish officers, who are set on excusing themselves\r\nfrom responsibility for the disasters of their colleagues. And the\r\npoliticians sometimes propose, in private and confidential minutes,\r\nvery curious plans and intrigues. Sir Charles Vaughan kept a certain\r\nnumber of these confidential papers in his own possession when he left\r\nCadiz, and did not turn them over to the Foreign Office. They lie,\r\nalong with his private correspondence, in the Library of All Souls’\r\nCollege, Oxford.\r\n\r\nSince we are dealing with the British army, not with the general\r\nhistory of the Peninsular War, I need only mention that unpublished\r\ndocuments by the thousand, relating to the French, Spanish, and\r\nPortuguese armies, may be found at Paris, Madrid, and Lisbon, and\r\nthat the researcher is invariably welcomed and courteously treated.\r\nIt may be worth while to make a note, for the benefit of beginners,\r\nto the effect that the French military documents are not concentrated\r\nin one mass, but are divided between the _Archives Nationales_, and\r\nthe _Archives de la Guerre_ at the Ministry of War. If a return or a\r\ndispatch is not to be found in one of these repositories, it may yet\r\nturn up in the other. The Spanish records are very “patchy,” full\r\non some campaigns, almost non-existent on others. For example, the\r\ndocuments on the luckless Ocaña campaign of 1809 are marvellously few;\r\nthere does not exist a single complete “morning state”, by regiments\r\nand divisions, of Areizaga’s unhappy army. I fancy that the whole\r\nof the official papers of his staff were captured in the rout, and\r\ndestroyed by ignorant plunderers—they did not get into the French\r\ncollections. Hence there have only survived the few dispatches which\r\nAreizaga and some of his subordinates sent to the Spanish Ministry of\r\nWar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contemporary Journals]\r\n\r\nSo much for Official Records. Passing on to the publications of\r\nindividual actors in the war, we must draw a sharp line between those\r\nwhich were issued during or immediately after the campaigns with which\r\nthey deal, and those which were written down, with or without the aid\r\nof contemporary notes or journals, many years after. The former, of\r\ncourse, possess a peculiar interest, because the writers’ narrative\r\nis not coloured by any knowledge of what is yet to come. An officer\r\nwriting of Corunna or Talavera with the memory of Vittoria and Waterloo\r\nupon him, necessarily took up a different view of the war from the\r\nman who set down his early campaign without any idea of what was to\r\nfollow. Early checks and hardships loom larger in the hour of doubt\r\nand disappointment, than when the recollection of them has been dimmed\r\nby subsequent hours of triumph. The early material, therefore, is very\r\nvaluable, but it is not so copious as that which was written down\r\nlater, and it largely exists in the form of letters and diaries, both\r\nof which are less readable than formal narratives. As good types of\r\nthis sort of material we may name Ormsby’s and Ker-Porter’s _Journals\r\nof the Campaign of 1808–09_, Hawkers’ _Journal of the Talavera\r\nCampaign_, Stothert’s _Diary of 1809–11_, and General MacKinnon’s\r\nJournal of the same three years, all of which were published within a\r\nfew months of the last entry which each contains. Next to these come\r\nthe books which consist of contemporary material, published without\r\nalteration from the original manuscripts, but only many years after\r\nthey had been written. The best of these for hard facts, often facts\r\nnot to be found elsewhere, is the diary of Tomkinson of the 16th Light\r\nDragoons:[13] with it may be mentioned the Journal of George Simmons of\r\nthe 95th, published in 1899 with the title, “A British Rifle Man,”[14]\r\nthe Journals of Sir William Gomm, 1808–15,[15] Sir George Warre’s\r\nLetters of 1808–12,[16] which only saw the light two years ago, and\r\nLarpent’s _Private Journal_, printed in 1852.[17] These volumes all\r\nhave short notes by the editors, but the text is the writing of the\r\nPeninsular time, untampered with and unaltered.\r\n\r\nThese books and their minor contemporaries stand in a class by\r\nthemselves, as contemporary material reflecting accurately the spirit\r\nof the times. Much more numerous, however, are the books which, though\r\nproduced by actors in the Great War, appeared at dates more or less\r\nremote from the years whose events they narrate. The formal histories\r\nare comparatively few, the reason being that Napier’s magnificent (if\r\nsomewhat prejudiced and biassed) volumes completely put off other\r\npossible authors, who felt that they lacked his genius and his power of\r\nexpression, from the idea of writing a long narrative of the war as a\r\nwhole. This was a misfortune, since the one book which all students of\r\nmilitary history are thereby driven to read, was composed by a bitter\r\npolitical partisan, who is set on maligning the Tory government, has an\r\naltogether exaggerated admiration for Napoleon, and owned many personal\r\nenemies in the British army, who receive scant justice at his hands.\r\nAt the same time we must be grateful that the work was written by one\r\nwho was an actual witness of many of the campaigns that he relates,\r\nconscientiously strove to get at all other first-hand witnesses, and\r\nransacked the French as well as the British official papers, so far as\r\nhe could obtain access to them. The merits of his style are all his\r\nown, and will cause the _History of the Peninsular War_ to be read as\r\nan English classic, as Clarendon’s _History of the Great Rebellion_ is\r\nread, even when research has shown (as in Clarendon’s case) that much\r\nof the narrative needs reconstruction, and that the general thesis on\r\nwhich it is constructed lacks impartiality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Napier, Southey, and Lord Londonderry]\r\n\r\nThe only other general histories of the war which appeared were\r\nSouthey’s (three vols. published 1832) and Lord Londonderry’s.[18] The\r\nformer was written by a literary man without any military experience,\r\nwho had seen nothing of the Peninsula during the years of the\r\nstruggle, and had as almost his only merit, a good knowledge of the\r\nSpanish sources, of which he was too uncritical. The book fell dead,\r\nbeing unable to compete with Napier, and lacking all the authority of\r\npersonal knowledge which was the latter’s strong point. The smaller\r\nbook of Lord Londonderry (two volumes, published 1829) is by no means\r\nwithout merit, but has many faults, always hovering on the edge between\r\nformal history and personal reminiscences. Wherever Charles Stewart\r\nhad not been present, he passes lightly over the episodes of war,\r\nand obviously had taken no very great pains to collect first-hand\r\nmaterial. At the same time the book has value, as giving the views\r\nof a highly-placed staff officer, who had the opportunity of seeing\r\nevery episode from the point of view of Head Quarters, and had strong\r\nconvictions and theories of his own. He had also the saving grace of\r\nloving statistics, and printed many valuable appendices of “morning\r\nstates” and casualty-lists, things of which Napier was far too\r\nsparing, and which Gurwood suppressed altogether. As a general record\r\nthe book could not cope with Napier, and has been forgotten—somewhat\r\nundeservedly—no less than Southey’s vast quartos. There is absolutely\r\nno other general history by a contemporary which needs mention. Of\r\ncourse I omit foreign sources, which help us little with regard to the\r\nBritish army, though they are indispensable for a general study of the\r\nwar. Foy’s unfinished _Guerre de la Peninsule_, if we may judge from\r\nthe volumes which appeared before his death, would have been a very\r\nprejudiced affair—his account of the British troops in Vol. I. is a\r\nbitter satire, contrasting oddly enough with his confessions concerning\r\ntheir merits in his _Journal_, of which a large portion was published\r\na few years ago by Girod de l’Ain under the title _Vie Militaire du\r\nGénéral Foy_. After all the detraction in his formal history, it is\r\ninteresting to read the frank letter which says, in 1811, that for a\r\nset battle on a limited front he acknowledges the superiority of the\r\nEnglish infantry to the French, “I keep this opinion to myself,” he\r\nadds, “and have never divulged it, for it is necessary that the soldier\r\nin the ranks should not only hate his enemy, but also despise him.”[19]\r\nFoy kept the opinion so closely to himself, that no one would have\r\nsuspected it who had read only his formal history of the Peninsular War.\r\n\r\nAnother French general history is Marshal Jourdan’s _Guerre d’Espagne_,\r\nissued only ten years ago by the Vicomte de Grouchy, though large parts\r\nof it had been utilized in Ducasse’s _Life and Correspondence of King\r\nJoseph Bonaparte_. This covers the whole war down to Vittoria, and\r\nis notable for its acute and often unanswerable criticism of Soult\r\nand Masséna, Marmont, and, not least, of Napoleon himself. It is less\r\nsatisfactory as a vindication of Jourdan’s own doings. Marmont’s\r\nautobiography only covers his fifteen months of command from May, 1811,\r\nto July, 1812: while St. Cyr’s and Suchet’s very interesting accounts\r\nof their own periods of activity relate entirely to Catalonia and the\r\neastern side of the Peninsula. St. Cyr does not touch British affairs\r\nat all; Suchet treats his campaigns against Maitland and Murray in a\r\nmuch more cursory style than his previous successes against the Spanish\r\narmies.[20] The other French formal narratives by contemporaries and\r\neye-witnesses are for the most part monographs on particular campaigns\r\nin which the writers took part—such as Thiébault’s work on Junot in\r\nPortugal—full of deliberate inaccuracies—which was published in 1817,\r\nand Lapène’s _Conquête d’Andalousie, en 1810–12_, and _Campagnes de\r\n1813–14_ (both published in 1823 in volumes of different size) which\r\ndeal only with the army of Soult. There are, however, two general\r\nhistories by German officers—Schepeler (who served with the Spaniards),\r\nand Riegel (who served with the French)—which both require mention. The\r\nformer is especially valuable.[21]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Toreno, Belmas, John Jones]\r\n\r\nAmong Peninsular historians two deserve special notice. The Conde\r\nde Toreno, a Spanish statesman who had taken part in the war as a\r\nyoung man, produced in 1838 three massive volumes which are, next to\r\nNapier, the greatest book that makes this war its subject. He is a\r\nfirst-hand authority of great merit, and should always be consulted\r\nfor the Spanish version of events. He was a great master of detail,\r\nand yet could paint with a broad brush. It is sometimes necessary\r\nto remember that he is a partisan, and has his favourites and his\r\nenemies (especially La Romana) among the generals and statesmen of\r\nSpain. But on the whole he is a historian of high merit and judgment.\r\nWith Toreno’s work must be mentioned the five small volumes of the\r\nPortuguese José Accursio das Neves, published in 1811, when Masséna had\r\nbut just retreated from before the Lines of Torres Vedras. This is a\r\nvery full and interesting description of Junot’s invasion of Portugal,\r\nand of the sufferings of that realm which came to an end with the\r\nConvention of Cintra. It is the only detailed picture of Portugal in\r\n1808. Unfortunately the author did not complete the story of 1809–10.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this note on historical works, as distinguished from\r\nmemoirs or diaries of adventure, we must name two excellent books, one\r\nEnglish and one French, on the special subject of siege operations.\r\nThese two monographs by specialists, both distinguished engineer\r\nofficers—Sir John Jones’ _Journal of the Sieges in Spain 1811–13_,\r\nand Colonel Belmas’ _Journaux des Sièges dans la Peninsule 1808–13_,\r\npublished respectively in 1827 and 1837—are among the most valuable\r\nbooks dealing with the Peninsular War, both containing a wealth of\r\ndetail and explanatory notes. The work of Belmas is especially rich in\r\nreprints of original documents bearing on the sieges, and in statistics\r\nof garrisons, losses, ammunition expended, etc. They were so complete,\r\nand supplemented each other so well, that little was done to add\r\nto the information that they give, till Major J. Leslie’s admirable\r\nedition of the _Dickson Papers_ began to appear a few years ago, and\r\nappreciably increased our knowledge of the English side of the siege\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nHaving made an end of the formal histories written by contemporaries\r\nand eye-witnesses, it remains that we should speak of a class of\r\nliterature much larger in bulk, and generally much more interesting,\r\nconsidered in the light of reading for the general student—the books\r\nof autobiographies and personal reminiscences which were written by\r\nparticipants in the war some time after it had come to an end—at any\r\ntime from ten to forty years after 1814. Their name is legion. I am\r\ncontinually discovering more of them, many of them printed obscurely\r\nin small editions and from local presses, so that the very knowledge\r\nof their existence has perished. And so many unpublished manuscripts\r\nof the sort exist, in France no less than in England, that it is clear\r\nthat we have not even yet got to the end of the stock of original\r\nmaterial bearing on the war. Some of the most interesting, _e.g._ the\r\nlively autobiography of Blakeney of the 28th,[22] and that of Ney’s\r\naide-de-camp Sprünglin,[23] have only appeared during the last few\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inaccuracies of Memoir-writers]\r\n\r\nThese volumes of personal adventures differ greatly in value: some were\r\nwritten up conscientiously from contemporary diaries: others contain\r\nonly fragments, the most striking or the most typical incidents of\r\ncampaigns whose less interesting every-day work had been forgotten, or\r\nat least had grown dim. Unfortunately in old age the memory often finds\r\nit hard to distinguish between things seen and things heard. It is not\r\nuncommon to find a writer who represents himself as having been present\r\nat scenes where he cannot have been assisting, and still more frequent\r\nto detect him applying to one date perfectly genuine anecdotes which\r\nbelong to another. One or two of the most readable narratives frankly\r\nmix up the sequence of events, with a note that the exact dating can\r\nnot be reconstructed. This is notoriously the case with the most vivid\r\nof all the books of reminiscences from the ranks—the little volume of\r\n“Rifleman Harris,” whose tales about General Robert Craufurd and the\r\nLight Division flow on in a string, in which chronology has to take its\r\nchance, and often fails to find it.\r\n\r\nAnother source of blurred or falsified reminiscences is that an author,\r\nwriting many years after the events which he has to record, has\r\ngenerally read printed books about them, and mixes up this secondary\r\nknowledge with the first-hand tale of his adventures. Napier’s\r\nPeninsular War came out so comparatively early, and was so universally\r\nread, that screeds from it have crept into a very great number of the\r\nbooks written after 1830. Indeed, some simple veterans betray the\r\nsource of their tales, concerning events which they cannot possibly\r\nhave witnessed themselves, by repeating phrases or epigrams of Napier’s\r\nwhich are unmistakeable. Some even fill up a blank patch in their own\r\nmemory by a _précis_ of a page or a chapter from the great history.\r\nIt is always necessary to take care that we are not accepting as a\r\ncorroboration of some tale, that which is really only a repetition of\r\nit. The diary of a sergeant of the 43rd mentioned above,[24] contains\r\nan intolerable amount of boiled-down Napier. It is far more curious to\r\nfind traces of him in the famous Marbot, who had clearly read Mathieu\r\nDumas’ translation when it came out in French.\r\n\r\nThe books of personal adventure, as we may call the whole class, may\r\nroughly be divided into three sections, of decreasing value in the way\r\nof authority. The first and most important consists of works written\r\nupon the base of an old diary or journal, where the memory is kept\r\nstraight as to the sequence of events by the contemporary record,\r\nand the author is amplifying and writing up real first-hand material.\r\nFavourable examples of this are Leach’s _Rough Sketches of the Life\r\nof an Old Soldier_,[25] Leslie of Balquhain’s _Military Journal_,[26]\r\nwhich in spite of its title is not in journal shape, but reads as a\r\ncontinuous narrative, and Sir George Bell’s _Rough Notes of Fifty\r\nYears’ Service_,[27] all of which are definitely stated by the authors\r\nto have been founded on their note-books of the war time, and therefore\r\ncan as a rule be treated as first-hand evidence. They can generally\r\nbe trusted as authorities against any divergent tales based on the\r\nnarratives of writers who wrote their reminiscences without any such\r\nfoundation, and where they get off the lines of contemporary evidence\r\nthey usually give the reader warning. For example, Leach gives valuable\r\nmaterial to show the inaccuracy of Napier’s exaggerated estimate of\r\nthe length and pace of the Light Division’s march to Talavera, whose\r\nerroneous figures have been repeated in so many subsequent books. And\r\nyet Leach was not conscious of the fact that the data which he gives\r\nwere incompatible with Napier’s story, and repeats it in a general\r\nway—because he published his book several years after the appearance\r\nof Napier’s second volume, and had (like many other members of the\r\nLight Division) absorbed the legend as a matter of faith on Napier’s\r\nauthority. It was reserved for Sir John Bell,[28] who had served under\r\nCraufurd but joined too late for Talavera, to explode the story. But\r\nhis demonstration of its inaccuracy has not travelled far, while the\r\noriginal legend has gone all round the world, and is still reproduced,\r\nas an example of unparalleled rapidity of movement, in serious military\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gleig, Blakeney, Hennegan]\r\n\r\nInfinitely less valuable than the books founded on private diaries\r\nor letters of contemporary date, are those which were written down\r\nlong after the war, from unaided memory only. They are, of course,\r\nprogressively less valuable for evidence according as the date at which\r\nthey were indited recedes from the period with which they deal. Gleig’s\r\ncharming _The Subaltern_, printed as early as 1825, may be better\r\ntrusted for matters of detail than Blakeney’s equally vivid narrative\r\nwritten in the remote island of Paxos about 1835, and Blakeney is more\r\nvaluable than Hennegan’s highly romantic _Seven Years of Campaigning_,\r\npublished only in 1847, when thirty winters had blurred reminiscence,\r\nand allowed of the accretion of much second-hand and doubtful material\r\nround the original story. The strength of men’s memories differs, so\r\ndoes their appreciation of the relative value of a dramatic narrative\r\nas compared with a photographic record of personal experiences. But\r\nin a general way we must allow that every year that elapses between\r\nthe event and the setting down of its narrative on paper decreases\r\nprogressively the value of the record. As an example of the way in\r\nwhich the failing powers of old age can confuse even a powerful memory,\r\nwe may mention the curious fact that Wellington himself, twenty years\r\nafter his last campaign, seems to have told two auditors that he had\r\nvisited Blücher’s camp on the very eve of Waterloo, the night between\r\nthe 17th and 18th of June, 1815, a statement quite incredible.[29]\r\nIt was apparently a blurred memory of his real visit to the Prussian\r\nheadquarters on the early afternoon of the 16th, of which ample details\r\nare known.\r\n\r\nFailing memory, the love of a well-rounded tale, a spice of autolatry,\r\nand an appreciation of the picturesque, have impaired the value of\r\nmany a veteran’s reminiscences. Especially if he is a well-known\r\n_raconteur_, and has repeated his narrative many times before he\r\nsets it down on paper, does it tend to assume a romantic form. The\r\nclassical example, of course, is Marbot, whose memoirs contain many\r\nthings demonstrably false, _e.g._ that he brought the news of the _Dos\r\nMayo_ insurrection at Madrid to Napoleon, or that in 1812 he took his\r\nregiment from Moscow to the neighbourhood of Poltava, and brought it\r\nback (400 miles!) in less than a fortnight with a convoy of provisions,\r\nor that he saw 6000 men drowned on the broken ice of the lake of\r\nSatschan at the end of the battle of Austerlitz.[30] Marbot is, of\r\ncourse, an extreme example of amusing egotism, but parallels on a minor\r\nscale could be quoted from many of his contemporaries, who wrote their\r\ntale too late. We may mention Thiébault’s account of the combat of\r\nAldea da Ponte, when he declares that he fought 17,000 Anglo-Portuguese\r\nand produced 500 casualties in their ranks, when he was really opposed\r\nby one British brigade and two Portuguese battalions, who lost\r\nprecisely 100 men between them. Yet the account is so lengthy and\r\ndetailed, that if we had not the British sources before us, we should\r\nbe inclined to think that we were reading an accurate narrative of\r\na real fight, instead of a romantic invention reconstructed from a\r\nblurred memory. It was the only Peninsular fight in which Thiébault\r\nexercised an independent command—and every year added to its beauties\r\nas the general grew old.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, we read the later-written Peninsular narratives\r\nwith interest, and often with profit, as reflections of the spirit of\r\nthe time and the army, we must always be cautious in accepting their\r\nevidence. And we must begin by trying to obtain a judgment on the\r\n“personal equation”—was the author a hard-headed observer, or a lover\r\nof romantic anecdotes? What proportion, if any, of the facts which he\r\ngives can be proved incompatible with contemporary records? Or again,\r\nwhat proportion (though not demonstrably false) seem unlikely, in face\r\nof other authorities? Had he been reading other men’s books on a large\r\nscale? Of this the usual proof is elaborate narrative concerning\r\nevents at which he cannot possibly have been present, with or without\r\ncitation of the source from which he has obtained the information. It\r\nis only when the author has passed his examination with credit on these\r\npoints, that we can begin to treat him as a serious authority, and to\r\ntrust him as evidence for scenes at which we know that he was actually\r\npresent. Many a writer of personal adventures may finally be given his\r\ncertificate as good authority for the annals of his own battalion,\r\nbut for nothing more. It is even possible that we may have to make\r\nthe further restriction that he may be trusted on the lucky days, but\r\nnot on the less happy ones, in the history of his own beloved corps.\r\nReticence as to “untoward incidents” is not uncommon. As to things\r\noutside the regiment, there was often a good deal of untrustworthy\r\ngossip abroad, which stuck in the memory even after long years had\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Books of Regimental Adventure]\r\n\r\nAmong all the books of regimental adventure, I should give the first\r\nplace for interest and good writing to Lieut. Grattan’s _With the\r\nConnaught Rangers_. It is not too much to say that if the author\r\nhad taken to formal history, his style, which is vivid without\r\nexaggeration, and often dignified without pomposity, would have made\r\nhim a worthy rival of Napier as an English classic. His descriptions\r\nof the aspect and psychology of the stormers marching down to the\r\nadvanced trenches at Ciudad Rodrigo, and of the crisis of the battle\r\nof Salamanca, are as good as anything that Napier ever wrote. A reader\r\npresented with many of his paragraphs would say without hesitation that\r\nthey were excerpts from the great historian. Unfortunately Grattan\r\nsuffered from one of the faults which I have named above—he _will_\r\ngive untrustworthy information about episodes at which he was not\r\npresent—it is at best superfluous and sometimes misleading. But for\r\nwhat the 88th did at Bussaco and Fuentes, at Badajoz and Salamanca,\r\nhe is very good authority. And he is always a pleasure to read. Two\r\ngood books—Gleig’s _The Subaltern_, and Moyle Sherer’s _Recollections\r\nof the Peninsula_—have a share of the literary merit of Grattan’s\r\nwork, but lack his power. They give respectively the day-by-day camp\r\nlife of the 85th in 1813–14, and of the 48th in 1811–13, in a pleasant\r\nand life-like fashion, and since both were published within ten years\r\nof the end of the war—Gleig’s in 1825, Sherer’s in 1824—the writers’\r\nmemories were still strong, and their statements of fact may be relied\r\nupon. Both have the merit of sticking closely to personal experience,\r\nand of avoiding second-hand stories.\r\n\r\nThose lively tales of adventure—Kincaid’s _Adventures in the Rifle\r\nBrigade_, Sir Harry Smith’s _Autobiography_, and Blakeney’s memoir\r\n(which its editor called _A Boy in the Peninsular War_)[31]—were\r\nall written at a much later date, from twenty to thirty years\r\nafter Waterloo, and show their remoteness from the time that they\r\ndescribe not so much by want of detail, nor of picturesque power of\r\ndescription,—all three authors were good wielders of the pen—as by\r\nthe selection of the facts that they record. Much of the every-day\r\nlife of the regiment has been forgotten or grown dim, and only the\r\ngreat days, or the most striking personal experiences, or quaint and\r\ngrotesque incidents, are recorded. This very fact makes them all very\r\ngood reading—they contain (so to speak) all the plums of the cake\r\nand comparatively little of the less appetizing crust. Harry Smith’s\r\nchapters are practically the tale of his Odyssey in the campaigns of\r\n1812–13 along with the heroic little Spanish wife whom he had picked\r\nup and married at the storm of Badajoz. Kincaid is a humourist—he\r\nremembers all the grotesque incidents, ludicrous situations, practical\r\njokes, and misadventures, in which he and his comrades were concerned,\r\nand pours them out in a string of anecdotes, loosely connected by a\r\nnarrative of which he says that he refuses to be responsible for the\r\nexact sequence or dating. It is very amusing, and some of the more\r\nstriking stories can be verified from other and better authorities.\r\nBut the general effect is often as if we were reading a chapter out\r\nof Lever’s _Charles O’Malley_, or some such old-fashioned Peninsular\r\nromance. Blakeney’s book gives a better impression for solidity, and\r\nhe fills up many an incident, otherwise known to us only in outline,\r\nwith picturesque detail which bears every appearance of truth. But\r\nI have once or twice found his narrative refusing to square in with\r\ncontemporary documents, and when this is the case the story written\r\ntwenty-five years after the event must go to the wall.[32] He must be\r\nused with caution, though he is giving a genuine record to the best of\r\nhis ability.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reminiscences from the Ranks]\r\n\r\nNearly all the reminiscences from the ranks are subject to these same\r\ndisabilities. With hardly an exception they were written down long\r\nyears after the events recorded. Usually the narrator had no books\r\nor notes to help him, and we get a genuine tale, uninfluenced by\r\nouter sources, but blurred and foreshortened by the lapse of time.\r\nThe details of personal adventure are perfectly authentic to the best\r\nof the veteran’s memory; incidents of battle, of camp hardships, of\r\nsome famous court-martial and subsequent punishment-parade, come out\r\nin a clear-cut fashion. But there are long gaps of forgotten months,\r\nfrequent errors of dating, and often mistakes in the persons to whom an\r\nexploit, an epigram, or a misadventure are attributed. Yet these little\r\nvolumes give the spirit of the rank and file in the most admirable\r\nfashion, and enable us to realize the inner life of the battalion as\r\nno official document can do. There are a few cases where the author\r\nhas got hold of a book, generally Napier’s great history, and to a\r\ngreat extent spoils his work by letting in passages of incongruous\r\neloquence, or strategical disquisition, into the homely stuff of his\r\nreal reminiscences.[33]\r\n\r\nOne soldier’s little volume stands out from all the rest for its\r\nliterary merit—it is the work of a man of superior education, who had\r\nenlisted in a moment of pique and humiliation to avoid facing at home\r\nthe consequences of his own conceit and folly. This short story of 150\r\npages called _Journal of T. S., a Soldier of the 71st Highland Light\r\nInfantry, 1806–15_, was written down as early as 1818,[34] when memory\r\nwas still fresh. Its value lies in the fact that the author wrote from\r\nthe ranks, yet was so different in education and mental equipment from\r\nhis comrades, that he does not take their views and habits for granted,\r\nbut proceeds to explain and comment on them. “I could get,” as he\r\nnotes, “no pleasure from their amusements, but found it necessary to\r\nhumour them in many things, and to be obliging to all. I was thought\r\nsaucy, and little courted by them, they not liking my dry manner as\r\nthey called it.” His narrative is that of an intelligent observer\r\nof the behaviour of the regiment, in whose psychology he is deeply\r\ninterested, rather than that of a typical soldier. Having a ready pen\r\nand a keen observant eye, he produced a little book of extraordinary\r\ninterest. The chronicle of his marches, and the details of the actions\r\nwhich he relates, seem very accurate when compared with official\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nSergeant Donaldson of the 94th was another notable Scot whose book,\r\n_The Eventful Life of a Soldier_, is well worth reading. He was not\r\nso well educated as T. S., nor had he the same vivid literary style.\r\nBut he was an intelligent man, and possessed a wider set of interests\r\nthan was common in the ranks, so that it is always worth while to\r\nlook up his notes and observations. His description of the horrors\r\nof Masséna’s retreat from Portugal in 1811 is a very striking piece\r\nof lurid writing. After him may be mentioned a quartermaster and\r\na sergeant—Surtees and Costello—both of the Rifle Brigade,—whose\r\nreminiscences are full of typical stories reflecting the virtues and\r\nfailings of the famous Light Division. For the views and ways of\r\nthought of the ordinary private of the better sort, the little books\r\nof “Rifleman Harris,” already cited above, Lawrence of the 40th, and\r\nCooper of the 7th Fusiliers,[35] are valuable authority. They are\r\nadmirable evidence for the way in which the rank and file looked on a\r\nbattle, a forced march, or a prolonged shortage of rations. But we must\r\nnot trust them overmuch as authorities on the greater matter of war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Memoirs of French Veterans]\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable bulk of French reminiscences dealing with\r\nthe purely British side of the Peninsular War. Beside Marbot’s and\r\nThiébault’s memoirs, of which I have already made mention, three\r\nor four more must not be neglected by any one who wishes to see\r\nWellington’s army from the outside. By far the most vivid and lively\r\nof them is Lemonnier-Delafosse of the 31st Léger, whose _Souvenirs\r\nMilitaires_ were published at Havre in 1850. He is a bitter enemy, and\r\nwants to prove that Wellington was a mediocre general, and ought always\r\nto have been beaten. But he does his best to tell a true tale, and\r\nacknowledges his defeats handsomely—though he thinks that with better\r\nluck they might have been victories. Failing memory can be detected in\r\none or two places, where he makes an officer fall at the wrong battle,\r\nor misnames a village. Fantin des Odoards, also (oddly enough) of the\r\n31st Léger, kept a journal, so that his reminiscences of 1808–11 are\r\nvery accurate. He is specially valuable for Moore’s retreat and Soult’s\r\nOporto campaign. A far more fair-minded man than Delafosse, he is full\r\nof acknowledgments of the merit of his British adversaries, and makes\r\nno secret of his disgust for the Spanish war,—a nightmare of plunder\r\nand military executions naturally resulting from an unjust aggression.\r\nA third valuable author is Colonel St. Chamans, an aide-de-camp of\r\nSoult, whom he cordially detested, and whose meanness and spirit\r\nof intrigue he is fond of exposing. He is of a light and humorous\r\nspirit—very different from another aide-de-camp, Ney’s Swiss follower,\r\nSprünglin, whose journal[36] is a most solid and heavy production, of\r\nvalue for minute facts and figures but not lively. Unlike St. Chamans\r\nin another respect, he is devoted to his chief, the Marshal, of whom\r\nhe was the most loyal admirer. But I imagine that Ney was a much more\r\ngenerous and loveable master than the wily Soult.\r\n\r\nOther useful French volumes of reminiscences are those of Guingret\r\nof the 6th corps, full of horrible details of Masséna’s Portuguese\r\nmisfortunes; of D’Illens, a cavalry officer who served against Moore\r\nand Wellesley in 1808–09; and of Vigo-Roussillon, of the 8th Line, who\r\ngives the only good French narrative of Barrosa. Parquin is a mere\r\n_sabreur_, who wrote his memoir too late, and whose anecdotes cannot be\r\ntrusted. He survived to be one of the followers of Napoleon III. in his\r\nearly and unhappy adventures at Boulogne and elsewhere. Other French\r\nwriters, such as Rocca and Gonneville, were long in Spain, but little\r\nin contact with the British, being employed on the Catalan coast, or\r\nwith the army of the South on the Granada side. So much for the works\r\nof actors in the Great War, who relate what they have themselves seen.\r\nWe need spend but a much smaller space on the books of the later\r\ngenerations, which are but second-hand information, however carefully\r\nthey may have been compiled.\r\n\r\nThe British regimental histories ought to be of great value, since the\r\nseries compiled by the order of the Horse Guards, under the general\r\neditorship of Richard Cannon, in the 1830’s, might have been enriched\r\nby the information obtainable from hundreds of Peninsular veterans,\r\nwho were still surviving. Unfortunately nearly every volume of it is\r\nno more than bad hack-work. In the majority of the volumes we find\r\nnothing more than copious extracts from Napier, eked out with reprints\r\nof the formal reports taken from the _London Gazette_. It is quite\r\nexceptional to find even regimental statistics, such as might have been\r\nobtained with ease from the pay-lists and other documents in possession\r\nof the battalion, or stored at the Record Office. Details obtained\r\nthrough enquiry from veteran officers who had served through the war\r\nare quite exceptional. Some of his volumes are less arid and jejune\r\nthan others—and this is about all that can be said in favour of even\r\nthe best of them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regimental Histories]\r\n\r\nAll the good regimental histories, without exception, are outside the\r\nofficial “Cannon” series. Some are excellent; it may be said that, as\r\na general rule, those written latest are the best: the standard of\r\naccuracy and original research has been rising ever since 1860. Among\r\nthose which deserve a special word of praise are Colonel Gardyne’s\r\nadmirable _The Life of a Regiment_ (the Gordon Highlanders), published\r\nin 1901; Cope’s _History of the Rifle Brigade_ (full of excerpts from\r\nfirst-hand authorities) which came out in 1877; Moorsom’s _History of\r\nthe 52nd Oxfordshire Light Infantry_ (the first really good regimental\r\nhistory which was written), published in 1860; Davis’s _History of\r\nthe 2nd Foot_ (Queen’s West Surrey), and Colonel Hamilton’s _14th\r\nHussars_. By the time that these began to appear, the level of research\r\nwas beginning to rise, and it was no longer considered superfluous to\r\nvisit the Record Office, or to make enquiries for unpublished papers\r\namong the families of old officers. All those mentioned above are large\r\nvolumes, but even the smaller histories are now compiled with care,\r\nand their size is generally the result not of scamped work (as of\r\nold), but of the fact that some regiments have, by the chance of their\r\nstations, seen less service than others, and therefore have less to\r\nrecord. I may mention as books on the smaller scale which have proved\r\nuseful to me, Hayden’s history of the 76th, Smyth’s of the 20th, and\r\nPurdon’s of the 47th. A rare example of the annals of a smaller unit,\r\na battery not a battalion, is Colonel Whinyates’ story of C Troop,\r\nR.H.A., which he called _From Corunna to Sebastopol_, in which much\r\nloyal and conscientious work may be found. But the history of the whole\r\nof the Artillery of the Peninsular Army, Portuguese as well as English,\r\nis now being worked out in admirable detail in the _Dickson Papers_,\r\nedited by Major John Leslie, R.A., who knows everything that can be\r\nknown about the units of his corps which served under Wellington.\r\nSir Alexander Dickson, it may be remarked, was Commanding Officer of\r\nthe Artillery in the later campaigns of 1813 and in 1814, and before\r\nhe obtained that post had been in charge of all the three sieges of\r\nBadajoz as well as those of Olivenza and Ciudad Rodrigo. Since he\r\nhad been lent to the Portuguese artillery, his papers give copious\r\ninformation as to the auxiliary batteries of that nation which were\r\nattached to the Peninsular Army. It is devoutly to be wished that some\r\nofficer would take up a corresponding task by compiling the annals of\r\nthe Royal Engineers in the Peninsular War. Connolly’s _History of the\r\nRoyal Sappers and Miners_ (published so far back as 1857), has much\r\ngood information, but infinitely more could be compiled by searching\r\nthe Record Office, and collating the memoirs of Boothby, Burgoyne,\r\nLandmann, and other engineer officers who have left journals or\r\nreminiscences.\r\n\r\nAlong with the British regimental histories should be named two sets\r\nof volumes which are of the same type, though they relate to larger\r\nunits than a regiment, and do not deal with our own troops. The first\r\nclass deals with our German auxiliaries, and is headed by Major Ludlow\r\nBeamish’s valuable and conscientious _History of the King’s German\r\nLegion_. This was written in 1832, but is a very favourable example\r\nof research for a book of the date, when Cannon’s miserable series\r\nrepresented the level of English regimental history. The two volumes\r\ncontain many original letters and documents, and some excellent plates\r\nof uniforms. In 1907 Captain Schwertfeger went over the same ground\r\nin his _Geschichte der Königlich Deutschen Legion_,[37] and added\r\nappreciably to Beamish’s store of facts. The Brunswick Oels regiment,\r\nwhich served Wellington from 1811 to 1814, has also a German biographer\r\nin Colonel Kortfleisch, who has served in the 88th German Infantry,\r\nwhich now represents that ancient corps. There is no similar history\r\nfor the _Chasseurs Brittaniques_, the last of the old Peninsular\r\nforeign corps.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Portuguese Authorities]\r\n\r\nFor the Portuguese Army a good description of the state of affairs in\r\n1810, when it had just been reorganized, is contained in Halliday’s\r\n_Present State of Portugal_, published in 1812. Chaby’s _Excerptos\r\nHistoricos_[38] contains a good deal of valuable material for its\r\nsubsequent history, but is sadly ill-arranged and patchy. Only the\r\nPortuguese artillery in the Peninsular War has been dealt with in\r\nMajor Teixeira Botelho’s _Subsidios para a Historia da Artilheria\r\nPortegueza_, which is very full and well documented. The life of a\r\nBritish officer serving with a Portuguese regiment can be studied\r\nin the _Memoirs of Bunbury_ (20th Line),[39] and Blakiston (5th\r\nCaçadores).[40]\r\n\r\nAfter regimental histories, the next most important source of\r\ninformation, in the way of books not written by those who served under\r\nWellington, is personal biographies. Captain Delavoye’s _Life of Lord\r\nLynedoch_ (Sir Thomas Graham)[41] is perhaps the most useful among\r\nthem, not so much for any merit of style or arrangement, as for the\r\nexcellent use of contemporary documents not available elsewhere. A\r\nlarge portion of the volume consists of excerpts from Graham’s long and\r\ninteresting military journal, and letters from and to him are printed\r\n_in extenso_. Thus we get first-hand information on many events at\r\nwhich no other British witness was present, _e.g._ Castaños’ campaign\r\non the Ebro in 1808, as well as comments on better known operations,\r\nsuch as Sir John Moore’s Corunna retreat, and the Barrosa expedition\r\nof 1811. Unfortunately both journal and letters fail for the campaign\r\nof 1813, in which Graham took such a distinguished part.\r\n\r\nH. B. Robinson’s _Memoirs of Sir Thomas Picton_[42] was a book of\r\nwhich Napier fell foul—there are many caustic comments on it in his\r\ncontroversial appendices. But it is not nearly so bad a work as might\r\nhave been expected from his way of treating it. Indeed I fancy that\r\nNapier was paying off an old Light Division grudge against Picton\r\nhimself, whom he personally disliked. The narrative is fair, and the\r\nquantity of contemporary letters inserted give the compilation some\r\nvalue. Sidney’s _Life of Lord Hill_[43] is far inferior to Robinson’s\r\nbook: the author did not know his Peninsular War well enough to\r\njustify the task which he took in hand, and the letters, of which he\r\nfortunately prints a good many, are the only valuable material in it.\r\nIt is curious that both Picton and Hill had their lives written by\r\nclergymen, when there were still a good many old Peninsular officers\r\nsurviving who might have undertaken the task.\r\n\r\nOf the other chief lieutenants of Wellington, Beresford has never\r\nfound a biographer, though the part which he played in the war was\r\nso important. There must be an immense accumulation of his papers\r\nsomewhere, in private hands, but I do not know where they lie. The only\r\naccount of him consists of a few pages in a useful but rather formal\r\nand patchy little book by J. W. Cole, entitled, _Memoirs of British\r\nGenerals Distinguished during the Peninsular War_.[44] Lord Combermere\r\n(Stapleton Cotton) was in high command throughout Wellington’s\r\ncampaigns, but was hardly up to his position, though he earned his\r\nchief’s tolerance by strict obedience to orders, a greater merit in the\r\nDuke’s eyes than military genius or initiative. There is a biography of\r\nhim by Lady Combermere and Captain W. Knollys (1866) but the Peninsular\r\nchapters are short. Of Sir Lowry Cole, Sir John Gaspard Le Marchant,\r\nand several other prominent divisional generals and brigadiers, the\r\nonly biographies are those in J. W. Cole’s book mentioned above. Sir\r\nJames Leith, more fortunate, had a small volume dedicated to his memory\r\nby an anonymous admirer in 1818, but it was written without sufficient\r\nmaterial, Leith’s private correspondence not (as it seems) being in\r\nthe author’s hands, while official documents were not for the most\r\npart available at such an early date. There is a good deal, however,\r\nconcerning this hard-fighting general’s personality and adventures to\r\nbe gleaned from the memoirs of his nephew and aide-de-camp, Leith Hay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Biographies of Gough, Colborne, etc.]\r\n\r\nOf officers who did not attain to the highest rank under Wellington,\r\nbut who in later years made a great career for themselves, there are\r\ntwo biographies which devote a large section to Peninsular matters,\r\nthose of Lord Gough by R. S. Rait (two vols., 1903), and of Lord\r\nSeaton (Colborne of the 52nd) by Moore Smith. These are both excellent\r\nproductions, which give much private correspondence of the time, and\r\nhave been constructed on modern lines, with full attention to all\r\npossible sources first- and second-hand. They are both indispensable\r\nfor any one who wishes to make a detailed study of the Peninsular\r\ncampaigns. There are also short memoirs of Sir Denis Pack[45] and Lord\r\nVivian,[46] each produced by a grandson of the general, and giving\r\nuseful extracts from journals and correspondence. The campaign of Sir\r\nJohn Moore can, perhaps, hardly be considered as falling into the\r\nstory of Wellington’s army, but it is impossible to avoid mentioning\r\nthe full (and highly controversial) biography of the hero of Corunna\r\nby Sir J. F. Maurice,[47] which contains an invaluable diary, and much\r\ncorrespondence. It is an indispensable volume, at any rate, for those\r\nwho wish to study the first year of the Peninsular War, and to mark the\r\ndifference between the personalities and military theories of Moore and\r\nWellington.\r\n\r\nOf formal and detailed histories of the Peninsular War written in\r\nrecent years there is one in Spanish by General Arteche, a very\r\nconscientious and thorough-going worker at original documents, who\r\ngot up a good many English authorities, but by no means all. For the\r\nSpanish version of the whole war he is absolutely necessary. So, for\r\nthe Portuguese version, is the immense work of Soriano da Luz, which is\r\nlargely founded on Napier, but often differs from him, and brings many\r\nunpublished documents to light. Colonel Balagny has started a history\r\nof the war in French on a very large scale, delightfully documented,\r\nand showing admirable research. In five volumes he has only just got\r\ninto 1809, so the whole book will be a large one. Mr. Fortescue’s\r\nfine history of the British Army has just started on the Peninsular\r\ncampaign in its last volume. To my own four volumes, soon I hope to be\r\nfive, I need only allude in passing. There is one immense monograph on\r\nDupont’s Campaign by a French author, Colonel Titeux, which does not\r\ntouch English military affairs at all. Two smaller but good works of\r\nthe same type by Colonel Dumas and Commandant Clerc are both, oddly\r\nenough, dedicated to the same campaign,—Soult’s defence of the Pyrenean\r\nfrontier in 1813–14: the former is the better of the two: both have\r\nendeavoured, in the modern fashion, to use the reports of both sides,\r\nnot to write from the documents of one only; but Dumas has a better\r\nknowledge of his English sources than Clerc.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond my power to guess why similar monographs on separate\r\ncampaigns of the war do not appear in English also. But the few\r\n_brochures_ purporting to treat of such which have appeared of late\r\non this side of the channel, are mostly cram-books for examinations,\r\nresting on no wide knowledge of sources, and often consisting of little\r\nmore than an analysis of Napier, with some supplementary comments\r\nhazarded. They contrast very unfavourably with a book such as that of\r\nColonel Dumas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE DUKE OF WELLINGTON—THE MAN AND THE STRATEGIST\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much for our sources. We may now proceed to discover what we can\r\ndeduce from them. And we must inevitably begin with a consideration\r\nof the great leader of the British army. I am not writing a life of\r\nWellington, still less a commentary on his campaigns—with which I\r\nam trying to deal elsewhere. My object is rather to paint him as he\r\nappeared to his own army, and as his acts and his writings reveal him\r\nduring the course of his Peninsular campaigns. The Arthur Wellesley of\r\n1809 is difficult to disentangle in our own memories from the familiar\r\nfigure of Victorian reminiscences. We think of him as the “Great\r\nDuke,” the first and most honoured subject of the crown, round whom\r\ncentre so many stories, more or less well founded, illustrating his\r\ndisinterestedness, his hatred of phrases, insincerities, sentiment, and\r\nhumbug generally, his punctiliousness, his bleak frugality, and his\r\noccasional scathing directness of speech—for he could never “suffer\r\nfools gladly.” He had become a legend long before he died, and it takes\r\nan effort of mind to differentiate the old man of 1850 from the general\r\nof 1809, who had still, in the eyes of most men, his reputation to\r\nmake. For those who understood the greatness of his Indian exploits\r\nwere few. It was not Napoleon only who thought that to call Wellesley\r\na “sepoy general” was sufficient to reduce his reputation to that of a\r\nfacile victor over contemptible enemies.\r\n\r\nWhen he took command of the Peninsular Army in the April of that\r\nyear, Arthur Wellesley was thirty-nine: he had just reached early\r\nmiddle age. He was a slight but wiry man of middle stature, well built\r\nand erect, with a long face, an aquiline nose, and a keen but cold\r\ngrey eye. His reputation as a soldier was already high; but few save\r\nthose who had served under him in India understood the full scope of\r\nhis abilities. Many undervalued him, because he was a member of a\r\nwell-known, but ill-loved family and political group, and had owed\r\nhis early promotion and opportunities of distinguishing himself to\r\nthat fact. It was still open to critics to say that the man who had\r\ncommanded a battalion in the old Revolutionary War at the age of\r\ntwenty-three, and who had headed an army in India before he was quite\r\nthirty, had got further to the front than he deserved by political\r\ninfluence. And it was true (though the fact is so often forgotten),\r\nthat in his early years he had got much help from his connections, that\r\nhe had obtained his unique chance in India because he was the brother\r\nof a viceroy, and that since his return from the East he had been more\r\nof a politician than a general. Was he not, even when he won Vimeiro,\r\nSecretary for Ireland in the Tory government of the day? It was a post\r\nwhose holder had to dabble in much dirty work, when dealing with the\r\nneedy peers, the grovelling place-mongers, and the intriguing lawyers\r\nof Dublin. Wellesley went through with it all, and not by any means\r\nin a conciliatory way. He passed the necessary jobs, but did not hide\r\nfrom the jobbers his scorn for them. When the Secretary for Ireland\r\nhad to deal with any one whom he disliked, he showed a happy mixture\r\nof aristocratic hauteur and cold intellectual contempt, which sent the\r\npetitioner away in a bitter frame of mind, whether his petition had\r\nbeen granted or no. Unfortunately, he carried this manner from the\r\nIrish Secretaryship on to the Headquarters of the Peninsular Army. It\r\ndid not tend to make him loved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington and the Whigs]\r\n\r\nFortunately for Great Britain, it does not always follow that, because\r\na man has been pushed rapidly to the front by political influence, he\r\nis therefore incompetent or unworthy of the place given him. Every one\r\nwho came into personal contact with Arthur Wellesley soon recognized\r\nthat Castlereagh and the other ministers had not erred when they sent\r\nthe “Sepoy General” to Portugal in 1808, and when they, despite of all\r\nthe clamour following the Convention of Cintra, despatched him a second\r\ntime to Lisbon in 1809, this time with full control of the Peninsular\r\nArmy. From the first opening of his Vimeiro campaign the troops that he\r\nled had the firmest confidence in him—they saw the skill with which he\r\nhandled them, and criticism very soon died away. It was left for Whig\r\npoliticians at home, carpers with not the slightest knowledge of war,\r\nto go on asserting for a couple of years more that he was an over-rated\r\nofficer, that he was rash and reckless, and that his leadership\r\nwould end, on some not very distant day, with the expulsion of the\r\nBritish army from the Peninsula. At the front there were very few such\r\ndoubters—though contemporary letters have proved to me that one or two\r\nwere to be found.[48]\r\n\r\nTo say that Wellington from the first was trusted alike by his officers\r\nand his men, is by no means to say that he was loved by them. He did\r\neverything that could win confidence, but little that could attract\r\naffection. They recognized that he was marvellously capable, but that\r\nhe was without the supreme gift of sympathy for others. “The sight of\r\nhis long nose among us,” wrote one of his veterans, “was worth ten\r\nthousand men any day of the week. I will venture to say that there was\r\nnot a heart in the army which did not beat more lightly when we heard\r\nthe joyful news of his arrival.”[49] But this does not mean that he was\r\nregarded with an enthusiasm of the emotional and affectionate sort.\r\nAnother Light Division officer sums up the position in the coldest\r\nwords that I have ever seen applied to the relations of a great general\r\nwith his victorious army. “I know that it has been said that Wellington\r\nwas unpopular with the army. Now I can assert with respect to the\r\nLight Division that the troops _rather liked him than otherwise_....\r\nAlthough Wellington was not what may be called popular, still the\r\ntroops possessed great confidence in him, nor did I ever hear a single\r\nindividual express an opinion to the contrary.”[50]\r\n\r\nThere must, indeed, have been something to repel enthusiasm and\r\naffection in the leader of whom, after five years of victories won and\r\nhardships suffered in common, it could be said that his troops “rather\r\nliked him than otherwise.” But they found that he was a hard master,\r\nslow to praise and swift to blame and to punish. Though he knew the\r\nmilitary virtues of his rank and file, and acknowledged that they had\r\nmore than once “got him out of a scrape” by performing the almost\r\nimpossible, he did not love them. He has left on record unpardonable\r\nwords concerning his men. “They are the scum of the earth. English\r\nsoldiers are fellows who have enlisted for drink—that is the plain\r\nfact: they have _all_ enlisted for drink.”[51] Quite as bad in spirit\r\nis one of his sayings before a Royal Commission on the Army. “I have no\r\nidea of any great effect being produced on British soldiers by anything\r\nbut the fear of immediate corporal punishment.” Naturally enough\r\na leader with such views never appealed to the better side of his\r\nmen: he never spoke or wrote about honour or patriotism to them, but\r\nfrequently reminded them of the lash and the firing-party, that were\r\nthe inevitable penalty for the straggler, the drunkard, the plunderer,\r\nand the deserter. Nothing cooled the spirits of officers and men alike\r\nmore than the strength and vigour of his rebukes, as compared with the\r\nofficial formality of his terms of praise. It was possible to have a\r\nfull appreciation of his marvellous powers of brain, and a complete\r\nconfidence in him as a leader, without feeling the least touch of\r\naffection for this hard and unsympathetic figure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington and his Men]\r\n\r\nThe distressing point in all this is that the Peninsular Army, though\r\nit had its proportion of hardened sots and criminals, was full of good\r\nsoldiers who knew what honour and loyalty meant, and were perfectly\r\ncapable of answering any stirring appeal to their heart or their\r\nbrain. There are dozens of diaries and autobiographies written in the\r\nranks which show the existence of a vast class of well-conditioned\r\nintelligent, sober, even religious men, who were doing their work\r\nconscientiously, and would have valued a word of praise—they often got\r\nit from their regimental officers—seldom from their commander-in-chief.\r\nAnd we may add that if anything was calculated to brutalize an army\r\nit was the wicked cruelty of the British military punishment code,\r\nwhich Wellington to the end of his life supported. There is plenty\r\nof authority for the fact that the man who had once received his\r\n500 lashes for a fault which was small, or which involved no moral\r\nguilt, was often turned thereby from a good into a bad soldier, by\r\nlosing his self-respect and having his sense of justice seared out.\r\nGood officers knew this well enough, and did their best to avoid the\r\ncat-of-nine-tails, and to try more rational means—more often than not\r\nwith success.[52]\r\n\r\nIt might have been expected that Wellington would at least show more\r\nregard for the feelings of his officers, however much he might contemn\r\nhis rank and file. As a rule he did not. He had some few intimates\r\nwhom he treated with a certain familiarity, and it is clear that he\r\nshowed consideration and even kindness to his aides-de-camp and other\r\npersonal retainers. But to the great majority of his officers, even to\r\nmany of his generals and heads of departments, he bore himself very\r\nstiffly: he would administer to them humiliating snubs or reproofs\r\nbefore others, and ignore their remarks or proffered counsel in the\r\nmost marked way. A few examples may serve. Sir Thomas Picton was one\r\nof his most distinguished lieutenants, and was specially summoned by\r\nhim to come over to Brussels to take his part in the campaign of 1815.\r\nThe moment that he arrived in the Belgian capital he sought the Duke,\r\nwho was walking in the Great Park. We have the witness of Picton’s\r\naide-de-camp for the following reception. “The general’s manner was\r\nalways more familiar than the Duke liked in his lieutenants, and on\r\nthis occasion he approached him in a careless sort of way, just as he\r\nmight have greeted an equal. The Duke bowed coldly to him, and said, ‘I\r\nam glad you are come, Sir Thomas. The sooner you get on horseback the\r\nbetter: no time to be lost. You will take the command of the troops in\r\nadvance.’ That was all. Picton appeared not to like the Duke’s manner,\r\nand when he had bowed and left, he muttered words which convinced those\r\nwho were with him that he was not much pleased with his interview.”[53]\r\nSuch was the welcome vouchsafed to one of the best officers in the\r\narmy, whom Wellington had specially sent for, and whom he had not seen\r\nfor a long space of time. Another picture of Wellington’s manners may\r\nbe taken from the memoir of one of his departmental chiefs, Sir James\r\nMcGrigor. “One morning I was in his lordship’s small room, when two\r\nofficers came to request leave to go home to England. An engineer\r\ncaptain first made his request: he had received letters informing him\r\nthat his wife was dangerously ill, and that the whole of his family\r\nwere sick. His lordship quickly replied, ‘No, no, sir. I cannot spare\r\nyou at this moment.’ The captain, with a mournful face, drew back. Then\r\na general officer, of noble family, commanding a brigade, advanced\r\nsaying, ‘My lord, I have lately been suffering much from rheumatism——’.\r\nWithout allowing him time to complete his sentence, Lord Wellington\r\nrapidly said, ‘and you want to go to England to be cured. By all means.\r\nGo there immediately.’ The general, surprised at his lordship’s tone\r\nand manner, looked abashed, but to prevent his saying anything more,\r\nhis lordship turned and began to address me, enquiring about the\r\ncasualty-returns of the preceding night, and the nature of them.”[54]\r\nAn interview with the commander-in-chief was such a trying thing for\r\nthe nerves that some officers went away from it in a flood of tears—as\r\ndid Charles Stewart after one famous reproof—and others suffocating\r\nfrom suppressed maledictions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington and his Officers]\r\n\r\nWellington’s temper was tried by having to deal with some inefficient\r\nand slack officers—foisted upon him from home—for never till the end\r\nof the war (as he bitterly complained) was he allowed complete liberty\r\nin choosing his subordinates. But it was not on them alone that his\r\nthunders fell. He often raged at zealous and capable subordinates,\r\nwho had done no more than think for themselves in an urgent crisis,\r\nwhen the orders that they had received seemed no longer applicable.\r\nSir James McGrigor, whom I have just quoted above, once moved some\r\ncommissariat stores to Salamanca, where there was a great accumulation\r\nof sick and wounded. “When I came to inform him his lordship started\r\nup, and in a violent manner began to repudiate what I had done. ‘I\r\nshall be glad to know,’ he asked, ‘who commands this army—I or you? I\r\nestablish one route, one line of communication—you establish another\r\nby ordering up supplies by it. As long as you live, sir, never do\r\nthat again. Never do _anything_ without my orders.’ I pleaded that\r\nthere had been no time to consult him, and that I had to save lives.\r\nHe peremptorily desired me ‘never again to act without his orders.’”\r\nThree months afterwards McGrigor ventured to say, “My lord, you will\r\nremember how much you blamed me at Madrid, for the steps that I took\r\nwhen I could not consult your lordship, and acted for myself. Now, if\r\nI had not, what would the consequences have been?” He answered, “It is\r\nall right as it has turned out, but still I recommend you to _have my\r\norders for what you do_.” This was a singular feature in his lordship’s\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nAnything that seemed to Wellington to partake of the nature of\r\nthinking for oneself was an unpardonable sin in a subordinate. This\r\nis why he preferred blind obedience in his lieutenants to zeal and\r\nenergy which might lead to some contravention of his own intention.\r\nThus it came that he preferred as lieutenants not only Hill, who was\r\na man of first-class brain-power notwithstanding his docility, but\r\nSpencer and Beresford, who most certainly were not. Hence, too, his\r\ncommission of the cavalry arm throughout the war to such a mediocre\r\npersonage as Stapleton Cotton (of whom he used the most unflattering\r\nlanguage).[55] These men could be trusted to obey without reasoning,\r\nwhile Robert Craufurd, the ablest general in the Peninsula, or Picton,\r\ncould not, but were liable to think for themselves. It may be noted\r\nthat Hill, Beresford, Graham and Craufurd, were the only officers to\r\nwhom Wellington ever condescended in his correspondence to give the why\r\nand wherefore of a command that he issued: the others simply received\r\norders without any commentary. There are instances known in which a\r\nword of reasonable explanation to a subordinate would have enabled him\r\nto understand a situation, and to comprehend why directions otherwise\r\nincomprehensible were given him. Tiresome results occasionally\r\nfollowed. This foible of refusing information to subordinates for no\r\nadequate reason has been shared by other great generals—_e.g._ by\r\nStonewall Jackson, as Colonel Henderson’s biography of that strange\r\ngenius sufficiently shows. It is a trick of the autocratic mind.\r\n\r\nIt hardly requires to be pointed out that this determination to allow\r\nno liberty of action to his lieutenants, and to keep even small\r\ndecisions in his own hands, effectually prevented Wellington from\r\nforming a school of generals capable of carrying out large independent\r\noperations. He trained admirable divisional commanders, but not leaders\r\nof armies. The springs of self-confidence were drained out of men who\r\nhad for long been subjected to his _régime_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington’s Dispatches]\r\n\r\nProbably the thing which irritated Wellington’s subordinates most\r\nwas his habit of making his official mention of names in dispatches\r\nlittle more than a formal recital in order of the senior officers\r\npresent. Where grave mistakes had been committed, he still stuck\r\nthe names of the misdemeanants in the list, among those of the men\r\nwho had really done the work. A complete mystification as to their\r\nrelative merits would be produced, if we had only the dispatches to\r\nread, and no external commentary on them. He honourably mentioned\r\nMurray in his Oporto dispatch, Erskine in his dispatch concerning\r\nthe actions during Masséna’s retreat in 1811, Trip in his Waterloo\r\ndispatch, though each of these officers had done his best to spoil the\r\noperations in which he was concerned. On the other hand, he would make\r\nthe most unaccountable omissions: his Fuentes de Oñoro dispatch makes\r\nno mention of the British artillery, which had done most brilliant\r\nservice in that battle, not merely in the matter of Norman Ramsay’s\r\nwell-known exploit, which Wellington might have thought too small a\r\nmatter to mention, but in the decisive checking of the main French\r\nattack. There are extant heart-rending letters from the senior officers\r\ncommanding the artillery, deploring the way in which they have been\r\ncompletely ignored: “to read the dispatch, there might have been no\r\nBritish artillery present at all.” A similar inexplicable omission\r\nof any record of zealous service occurs in Wellington’s dispatch\r\nrecording the fall of Badajoz, where no special praise of the services\r\nof his engineer officers is made, though 50 per cent. of them had\r\nbeen killed or wounded during the siege. “You may suppose we all feel\r\nhurt at finding our exertions have not been deemed worthy of any sort\r\nof eulogium,” writes John Jones, the historian of the sieges of the\r\nPeninsula, to one of his colleagues. And Fletcher, the commanding\r\nengineer, writes to a friend: “You will observe that Lord W. has\r\nnot mentioned the engineers in the late actions: how I hate such\r\ncapriciousness!”[56] The cold phrase in which their desperate service\r\nwas acknowledged is “the officers and men of the corps of engineers\r\nand artillery were equally distinguished during the operations of\r\nthe siege and its close.” Fletcher would gladly have exchanged the\r\npersonal honour of a decoration, which was given him along with other\r\nsenior officers, for three lines of warm praise of the exertions of his\r\nsubordinates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Roberts on Wellington]\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, the most astounding instance of Wellington’s\r\nungracious omissions is that his famous Waterloo dispatch contains\r\nno mention whatever of the services of Colborne and the 52nd, the\r\nbattalion which gave the decisive stroke against the flank of the\r\nImperial Guard, during Napoleon’s last desperate assault on the British\r\nline. Colborne, the most unselfish and generous of men, could never\r\nforget this slight. He tried to excuse it, saying, “dispatches are\r\nwritten in haste, and it is impossible for a general to do justice\r\nto his army.” And when he heard his officers complaining that the\r\nBritish Guards had been given all the credit for the final repulse of\r\nthe French column, he said, “For shame, gentlemen! One would think\r\nthat you forgot that the 52nd had ever been in battle before.” But\r\nthere was a bitter comment in the table talk of his later years. “The\r\nDuke was occasionally not above writing in his dispatches to please\r\nthe aristocracy.... I don’t mean to say that this was peculiar to\r\nhim. It used to be a common thing with general officers.”[57] Enough,\r\nhowever, of these illustrative anecdotes of the limitations of a very\r\ngreat soldier and a very honourable man. They have to be mentioned in\r\norder to explain how it came to pass that Wellington was implicitly\r\ntrusted, and never loved. But they compel me to acquiesce in the hard\r\njudgment which Lord Roberts wrote in his _Rise of Wellington_—“the\r\nmore we go into his actions and his writings in detail, the more do\r\nwe respect and admire him as a general, and the less do we like him\r\nas a man.” I conclude this paragraph with two quotations from two\r\neloquent writers who served through long years of the Peninsular\r\ncampaigns. “Thus terminated the war, and with it all remembrances\r\nof the veteran’s services” are the last words of William Napier’s\r\npenultimate chapter.[58] Grattan of the 88th, a forgotten writer now,\r\nbut one who wielded a descriptive pen no less vivid than Napier’s,\r\nputs the complaint more bitterly. “In his parting General Order to\r\nthe Peninsular Army he told us that he would never cease to feel the\r\nwarmest interest for our welfare and honour. How that promise has\r\nbeen kept every one knows. That the Duke of Wellington is one of the\r\nmost remarkable (perhaps the greatest) men of the present age, few\r\nwill deny. But that he neglected the interests and feelings of his\r\nPeninsular army, as a body, is beyond all question. And were he in his\r\ngrave to-morrow, hundreds of voices that now are silent would echo what\r\nI write.”[59]\r\n\r\nIf I have dwelt perhaps at over-great length on the limitations of\r\nWellington’s heart, it is only fair that full credit should be given to\r\nhis wonderful powers of brain. To comprehend the actual merit of his\r\nmilitary career, it is not sufficient to possess a mere knowledge of\r\nthe details of his tactics and his strategy. The conditions under which\r\nhe had to exercise his talents were exceptionally trying and difficult.\r\nWhen he assumed command at Lisbon on April 22, 1809, the French were in\r\npossession of all Northern and Central Spain, and of no inconsiderable\r\npart of Northern Portugal also. The Spanish armies had all been\r\ndashed to pieces—there was no single one of them which had not\r\nsuffered a crushing defeat, and some of them (such as Cuesta’s army\r\nof Estremadura, and La Romana’s army of Galicia) were at the moment\r\nlittle better than wandering bands of fugitives. The British army of\r\nwhich Wellesley took command when he landed at Lisbon, though it only\r\nmustered 19,000 men present, or 21,000 including men in hospital, was\r\nthe only solid force, in good order and intact in _morale_, on which\r\nthe allies could count in the Iberian Peninsula. The task set before\r\nWellesley was to see if he could defend Portugal, and co-operate in the\r\nprotection of Southern Spain, it being obvious that the French were in\r\nvastly superior numbers, and well able to take the offensive if they\r\nshould chose to do so. There were two armies threatening Lisbon. The\r\none under Soult had already captured Oporto and overrun two Portuguese\r\nprovinces, shortly before Wellesley’s landing. The other, under Victor,\r\nlay in Estremadura close to the Portuguese border, and had recently\r\ndestroyed the largest surviving Spanish army at the battle of Medellin\r\non March 28. Was it possible that 19,000 British troops could save\r\nthe Peninsula from conquest, or even that they could keep up the war\r\nin Central Portugal? Never was a more unpromising task set to the\r\ncommander of a small army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington’s Powers of Prescience]\r\n\r\nFortunately we possess three documents from Wellesley’s own hand, which\r\nshow us the way in which he surveyed the position that was before him,\r\nand stated his views as to the future course of the Peninsular War.\r\nHe recognized that it was about to be a very long business, and that\r\nhis task was simply to keep the war going as long as possible, with\r\nthe limited resources at his disposition. Ambitious schemes for the\r\nexpulsion of the French from the whole Peninsula were in 1809 perfectly\r\nfutile. The hypothesis which he sets forth in the first of the three\r\ndocuments to which I allude, his _Memorandum on the Defence of\r\nPortugal_, laid before Castlereagh on March 7, before he had taken ship\r\nfor Lisbon, is a marvel of prophetic genius. No more prescient document\r\nwas ever written. Rejecting the decision of Sir John Moore, who had\r\ndeclared that Portugal was quite indefensible, Wellesley states that\r\na British army of not less than 30,000 men, backed by the levies of\r\nPortugal, ought to be able to maintain itself for an almost indefinite\r\nperiod on the flank of the French army in Spain. Its presence on the\r\nTagus would paralyse all offensive movements of the enemy, and enable\r\nthe Spaniards to make head in the unsubdued provinces of their realm,\r\nso long as Portugal should remain intact. The French ought, if they\r\nwere wise, to turn all their disposable forces against the British\r\narmy and Portugal, but he believed that even then, when the geography\r\nof the country was taken into consideration, they would fail in their\r\nattempt to overrun it. They could not succeed, as he held, unless they\r\nwere able to set aside 100,000 men for the task, and he did not see how\r\nin the spring of 1809 they could spare such a large detachment, out of\r\nthe forces which they then possessed in the Peninsula. If they tried it\r\nwith a smaller army, he thought that he could undertake to foil them.\r\nHe believed that he could cope with Soult and Victor, the two enemies\r\nwho immediately threatened Portugal.[60]\r\n\r\nFurther forward it was impossible to look. If a war should break out\r\nbetween Napoleon and Austria, as seemed likely at the moment in March,\r\n1809, to one who (like himself) was in the secrets of the British\r\nCabinet, the Emperor would not be able to send reinforcements to\r\nSpain for many a day. But, even so, the position of the French in the\r\nPeninsula was so strong that it could only be endangered if a very\r\nlarge allied force, acting in unison under the guidance of a single\r\ngeneral, should be brought to bear upon them. Of the collection of such\r\na force, and still more of the possibility of its being entrusted to\r\nhis own command, there was as yet no question. Wellesley was aware of\r\nthe jealousy of foreign interference which the Spanish Junta nurtured:\r\nthere was little probability that they would entrust him with the\r\nsupreme control over their armies. It was, indeed, only in 1812,\r\nwhen he had acquired for himself a much greater reputation than he\r\nowned in 1809, and when the Spanish Government had drunk the cup of\r\nhumiliation to the dregs, that he was finally given the position of\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Spanish armies.\r\n\r\nThis memorandum is a truly inspired document, which shows Wellesley\r\nat his best. It is not too much to say that it predicts the whole\r\ncourse of the Peninsular War—whose central point was to be invasion of\r\nPortugal in 1810 by a French army of 65,000 instead of the required\r\n100,000 men, and that army, as he had foreseen, Wellesley was able to\r\ncheck and foil.\r\n\r\nThe second document of a prophetic sort that we have to notice is\r\nWellesley’s reply to Mr. Canning’s question to him as regards the\r\nfuture general policy of the war, written on September 5, 1809. The\r\nwhole aspect of affairs had been much changed since March, by the fact\r\nthat Austria had tried her luck in a war against Napoleon, and had been\r\nbeaten at Wagram and forced to make peace. It was therefore certain\r\nthat the Emperor would now have his hands free again, and be able to\r\nreinforce his armies in the Peninsula. Wellesley replies that it is\r\nhopeless to attempt to defend both Southern Spain and Portugal also,\r\neven if the British army were raised to 40,000 men. But Portugal can\r\nstill be defended.[61] He expresses the strongest objection to any\r\nattempt to cover Andalusia and Seville, for to endeavour to do so must\r\nmean that Lisbon would have to be given up.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Lines of Torres Vedras]\r\n\r\nThe third great prophetic despatch is the Memorandum of October\r\n26, 1809, ordering the construction of the Lines of Torres Vedras.\r\nWellesley looks a full year ahead. He sees that Napoleon can now\r\nreinforce his Spanish armies, but that the new troops cannot get up\r\ntill the next spring. When they appear, the British army will have to\r\nretreat on Lisbon, where lines of such strength can be planned that\r\nthere is a good prospect of bringing the invaders to a stand. Meanwhile\r\nthe countryside shall be cleared of population and provisions, so that\r\nthe French, if they keep concentrated, must starve, and the allied\r\narmy shall so conduct its operations that the enemy will be compelled\r\nto remain _en masse_. Then follow directions to Colonel Fletcher\r\n(commanding the engineers) to make his plans for an immense line of\r\nredoubts covering the Lisbon peninsula from sea to sea. What was\r\nforeseen came to pass: the French reinforcements arrived: the invasion\r\nof Portugal under Masséna took place in 1810. But the whole countryside\r\nwas swept clear of food, and when the marshal reached the Lines with\r\nhis half-starved army, he was completely blocked, refused to attack the\r\nformidable positions, and, after a few weeks of endurance in front of\r\nthem, withdrew with his famished troops. It was on October 26, 1809,\r\nthat Wellington ordered the Lines to be laid out. On October 14, 1810,\r\nMasséna appeared in front of them and was foiled: Wellington had made\r\nhis preparations exactly a year ahead!\r\n\r\nCareful long-sighted calculation was perhaps the Duke’s strongest\r\npoint. He had an immense grasp of detail, kept intelligence officers of\r\npicked ability out on every front, and had compiled an almost exactly\r\ncorrect muster-roll of the forces opposed to him. Seldom had a general\r\nof his time such a complete knowledge of his adversaries, and this he\r\nowed to the pains that he took to obtain it. His great scouts Colquhoun\r\nGrant,[62] Waters, and Rumann were always far out to the front, often\r\nwithin the French lines, sending him daily information, which he\r\nfiled and dissected. In addition he had many Spanish and Portuguese\r\ncorrespondents, whose information would have been more valuable if it\r\nhad not contained too much hearsay, and if they had been able to judge\r\nnumbers with the trained eye of a soldier. Once he complained that he\r\nand Marmont were almost equally handicapped as regards information from\r\nthe natives—for if the Frenchmen got none, he himself got too much:\r\nthe proportion of it which was inaccurate spoiled the value of the\r\nrest. But Grant or Waters never made mistakes. Part of his system was\r\nthe cross-questioning of every deserter and prisoner as to the number\r\nand brigading of his regiment, and the amount of battalions that it\r\ncontained. By constant comparison of these reports he got to know the\r\nexact number of units in every French corps, and their average strength.\r\n\r\nBut this was less important than his faculty for judging the individual\r\ncharacters of his opponents. After a few weeks he got his fixed opinion\r\non Masséna or Victor, Soult or Marmont, and would lay his plans with\r\ncareful reference to their particular foibles. I think that this is\r\nwhat he meant when he once observed that his own merit was, perhaps,\r\nthat he knew more of “what was going on upon the other side of the\r\nhill,”—in the invisible ground occupied by the enemy and hidden by the\r\nfog of war—than most men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington’s Insight into Character]\r\n\r\nThis insight into the enemy’s probable move, when their strength, their\r\nobject, and the personal tendencies of their leader were known, was\r\na most valuable part of Wellesley’s mental equipment. The best known\r\ninstance where it came into play was on the day of Sorauren. In the\r\nmidst of the battles of the Pyrenees, when the British army had taken\r\nup its fighting position, though its numbers were as yet by no means\r\ncomplete, and two divisions were still marching up, Wellington arrived\r\nfrom the west to assume command. He could see Soult on the opposite\r\nhill surrounded by his staff, and it was equally certain that Soult\r\ncould see him, and knew the reason of the cheer which ran along the\r\nfront of the allied army as he rode up. Wellington judged, and rightly,\r\nthat the news of his arrival, and the sight of him in position, would\r\ncause the marshal to delay his attack till the last of the French\r\nreserves had come on the field. “I had an excellent glass: I saw him\r\nspying at us—then write and send off a letter: _I knew what he would\r\nbe writing_, and gave my orders accordingly.”[63] Wellington judged\r\nSoult a cautious general, knew that his own presence would redouble\r\nhis caution, and so judged that the order given by the marshal would\r\nbe for the checking of a threatened attack, which would have been very\r\ndangerous at the moment, if it had been pressed. “The 6th Division will\r\nhave time to come up, and we shall beat him,” is said to have been his\r\ncomment, when he saw Soult hurriedly write and dispatch an order to his\r\nfront line.\r\n\r\nWellington played off a similar piece of bluff on Marmont at Fuente\r\nGuinaldo in September, 1811, when he drew up in a position strong\r\nindeed, but over-great for the numbers that he had in hand, and seemed\r\nto offer battle. He was aware that his own reputation for caution was\r\nso great that, if the enemy saw him halt and take up his ground, they\r\nwould judge that he had concentrated his whole force, and would not\r\nattack him till their own reserves were near. He absconded unmolested\r\nin the night, while Marmont’s rear columns were toiling up for the\r\nexpected battle of the next day.\r\n\r\nFor a long time in 1809–10 Wellesley had to assume a defensive\r\nattitude. It was not till 1811 that it at last became possible for him\r\nto think of taking the offensive, nor was it till 1812, the glorious\r\nyear of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, and Salamanca, that the dream reached\r\nits realization. Hence came it that for a long time he was regarded\r\nonly as a cautious and calculating general, a master of defensive\r\nwarfare. This conception of him was wrong; as events showed, in\r\n1812–1813, that he could be a very thunderbolt of war, when propitious\r\nchance gave him the opportunity, could strike the boldest blows, and\r\nlaunch his army upon the enemy with the most ruthless energy. But, in\r\nthe earlier years of his command, he was always hopelessly outnumbered,\r\nand forced to parry rather than to strike. He had to run no risks with\r\nhis precious little army, the 30,000 British troops on whom the whole\r\ndefence of the Peninsula really depended: because if it were destroyed\r\nit could not be replaced. With these 30,000 men he had covenanted, in\r\nhis agreement with Castlereagh, when first he sailed to take command at\r\nLisbon, that he would keep up the war indefinitely. If by taking some\r\ngreat risk he had lost 15,000 or even 10,000 men, the government would\r\nhave called him home, and would have given up the struggle. Thus he\r\nhad to fight with the consciousness that a single disaster might ruin\r\nnot only his own plans, but the whole cause of the allies in Spain.\r\nNo wonder that his actions seem cautious! Yet even in 1810–1811 he\r\ntook some serious risks, such as the offering of battle at Bussaco and\r\nFuentes de Oñoro. When even a partial defeat would mean his own recall,\r\nand the evacuation of Portugal, it required no small resolution even\r\nto face such chances as these. But his serene and equable temper could\r\ndraw the exact line between legitimate and over-rash enterprise, and\r\nnever betrayed him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington on the Offensive]\r\n\r\nAll the more striking, therefore, was the sudden development into a\r\nbold offensive policy which marked the commencement of that year of\r\nvictories 1812. The chance had at last come: Napoleon was ceasing to\r\npour reinforcements into Spain—the Russian War was beginning to loom\r\nnear at hand. The French no longer possessed their former overwhelming\r\nsuperiority: in order to hold in check Wellington’s army, now at last\r\nincreased by troops from home to 40,000 British sabres and bayonets,\r\nthey had to concentrate from every quarter, and risk their hold on\r\nmany provinces in order to collect a force so large that the British\r\ngeneral could not dare to face it. At last, in the winter of 1811–1812,\r\nNapoleon himself intervened as Wellington’s helper, by dispersing\r\nhis armies too broadcast. The actually fatal move was the sending of\r\n15,000 of Marmont’s “Army of Portugal,” the immediate adversary of\r\nthe Anglo-Portuguese host, for a distant expedition to the coast of\r\nthe Mediterranean in aid of Marshal Suchet. It was the absence of\r\nthis great detachment, which could not return for many weeks, that\r\nemboldened Wellington to make his first great offensive stroke, the\r\nstorming of Ciudad Rodrigo on January 19, 1812, after a siege of only\r\ntwelve days.\r\n\r\nFollowing on this first success came the dear-bought but decisive\r\nsuccess of the storming of Badajoz on April 7; this was a costly\r\nbusiness, because Wellington had to operate “against time,” since, if\r\nhe lingered over-long, the French armies from north and south would\r\ncombine, outnumber him, and drive him back into Portugal. Badajoz had\r\nto be stormed by sheer force, before all the arts of the engineer and\r\nartillerist had worked their full effect. The fire of the besieged had\r\nnot been subdued, nor had the approaches of the assailants been pushed\r\nclose up to the walls, as science would have dictated. But by making\r\nthree simultaneous attacks on different points of the fortress, and\r\nsucceeding at two of them, Wellington achieved his object and solved\r\nhis “time problem.” He showed here, for the first time, that he could,\r\nif it was necessary, spend the lives of his men remorselessly, in order\r\nto finish in a few days a task which, if much longer delayed, would\r\nhave had to be abandoned. This was to his French enemies a revelation\r\nof a new side of his character. He had been esteemed one who refused\r\nrisks and would not accept losses. If they had known of the details of\r\nhis old Indian victory of Assaye, they would have judged his character\r\nmore truly.\r\n\r\nBut Salamanca was the real revelation of Wellington’s full powers. It\r\nwas a lightning stroke, a sudden offensive movement made at a crisis of\r\nmomentary opportunity, which would have ceased if the hour had not been\r\nseized with all promptitude. Wellington hurled his army unexpectedly\r\nat the enemy, who was manœuvring in full confidence and tranquillity\r\nin front of his line, thinking that he had to deal with an adversary\r\nwho might accept a battle (as at Vimeiro, Talavera, or Bussaco), but\r\nmight be trusted not to force one on. Salamanca surprised and dismayed\r\nthe more sagacious of the French officers. Foy, the most intelligent\r\nobserver among them, put down in his diary six days later, “This battle\r\nis the most cleverly fought, the largest in scale, the most important\r\nin results, of any that the English have won in recent times. It\r\nbrings up Lord Wellington’s reputation almost to the level of that of\r\nMarlborough. Up to this day we knew his prudence, his eye for choosing\r\ngood positions, and the skill with which he used them. But at Salamanca\r\nhe has shown himself a great and able master of manœuvring. He kept\r\nhis dispositions hidden nearly the whole day: he allowed us to develop\r\nour movement before he pronounced his own: he played a close game; he\r\nutilized the “oblique order” in the style of Frederick the Great....\r\nThe catastrophe of the Spanish War has come—for six months we ought to\r\nhave seen that it was quite probable.”[64]\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most striking and handsome compliments ever paid\r\nby a general of a beaten army to the commander of the victorious\r\nadversaries. It is perfectly true, and it reflects the greatest credit\r\non Foy’s fair-mindedness and readiness to see facts as they were. The\r\nconqueror of Salamanca was for the future a much more terrifying enemy\r\nthan the victor of Bussaco or Talavera had been. It is one thing to be\r\nrepulsed—that had often happened to the French before—another to be\r\nsuddenly assailed, scattered, and driven off the field with crushing\r\nlosses and in hopeless disorder, as happened to Wellington’s enemies\r\nunder the shadow of the Arapiles on July 22, 1812.\r\n\r\nWellington as a great master of the offensive came into prominence\r\nin 1812, and for the rest of the war it is this side of him which is\r\nmost frequently visible, though the retreat from Burgos shows that his\r\nprudence was as much alive as ever. During the few days that preceded\r\nthat retreat there was very great temptation to try a hard stroke at\r\none of the French armies that were converging on the two halves of his\r\nown force. Napoleon would undoubtedly have made the attempt. But,\r\nWellington, knowing that his own total numbers were much inferior to\r\nthose of the enemy, and that to concentrate in front of either Soult or\r\nSouham would be to take a terrible risk on the other flank, preferred\r\na concentric retreat towards his base on the frontier of Portugal, to\r\na battle in the plains of Castille, where he was far from home and\r\nsupport, and where a defeat might lead to absolute ruin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Campaigns of 1813–1814]\r\n\r\nThis was the last time that he was outnumbered and forced back upon\r\nhis old methods. In 1813, owing to Napoleon’s drafts from the army\r\nof Spain, which were called off to replace the troops lost in the\r\nMoscow campaign, the allies had at last a superiority in numbers,\r\nthough that superiority consisted entirely in Spanish troops of\r\ndoubtful solidity. But even these were conditions far more favourable\r\nthan Wellington had ever enjoyed before—he knew how to use his newly\r\njoined Spanish divisions in a useful fashion, without placing them in\r\nthe more dangerous and responsible positions. The campaigns of 1813\r\nand 1814 are both essentially offensive in character, though they\r\ncontain one or two episodes when Wellington was, for the moment, on\r\nthe defensive in his old style, notably the early part of the battles\r\nof the Pyrenees, where, till his reserves came up, he was fending off\r\nSoult by the use of his more advanced divisions. But the moment that\r\nhis army was assembled he struck hard, and chased the enemy over the\r\nfrontier, again in the series of operations that begun on the last day\r\nof Sorauren. There was a very similar episode during the operations\r\nthat are generally known as the battle of the Nive, where Wellington\r\nhad twice to stand for a movement in position, while one of his wings\r\nwas assailed by Soult’s main body. But this was distinctly what we may\r\ncall defensive tactical detail, in a campaign that was essentially\r\noffensive on the whole. The main character of the operations of 1813–14\r\nmay be described as the clearing out of the enemy from a series of\r\npositions—generally heavily fortified—by successful breaking through of\r\nthe lines which Soult on each occasion failed to hold. Invariably the\r\nFrench army was nailed down to the position which it had taken up, by\r\ndemonstrations all along its front, while the decisive blow was given\r\nat selected points by a mass of troops collected for the main stroke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON’S INFANTRY TACTICS—LINE _VERSUS_ COLUMN\r\n\r\n\r\nEveryone who takes a serious interest in military history is aware\r\nthat, in a general way, the victories of Wellington over his French\r\nadversaries were due to a skilful use of the two-deep line against\r\nthe massive column, which had become the usual fighting-formation for\r\na French army acting on the offensive, during the later years of the\r\ngreat war that raged from 1792 till 1814. But I am not sure that the\r\nmethods and limitations of Wellington’s system are fully appreciated,\r\nand they are well worth explaining. And on the other hand it would\r\nnot be true to imagine that all French fighting, without exception,\r\nwas conducted in column, or that blows delivered by the solid masses\r\nwhose aspect the English knew so well, were the only ideal of the\r\nNapoleonic generals. It is not sufficient to lay down the general\r\nthesis that Wellington found himself opposed by troops who invariably\r\nworked in column, and that he beat those troops by the simple expedient\r\nof meeting them, front to front, with other troops who as invariably\r\nfought in the two-deep battle line. The statement is true in a general\r\nway, but needs explanation and modification.\r\n\r\nThe use of infantry in line was, of course, no invention of\r\nWellington’s, nor is it a universal panacea for all crises of war.\r\nDuring the eighteenth century, from Marlborough to Frederic the Great,\r\nall European infantry was normally fighting in line, three or four\r\ndeep, and looking for success in battle to the rapidity and accuracy\r\nof its fire, not to the impetus of advances in heavy masses such as\r\nhad been practised by the pikemen of the sixteenth or seventeenth\r\ncentury, and were to be introduced again by the French generals of the\r\nRevolutionary period. Everyone knows how the victories of Frederic the\r\nGreat were in part to be attributed to the careful fire-drill of his\r\ninfantry, who, with their iron ramrods and rapid manual exercise, used\r\nto put in a far larger and more effective discharge of musket-balls per\r\nminute than their adversaries. But both parties were as a rule fighting\r\nin three-deep line, Austrians no less than Prussians. Armies had a\r\nstereotyped array, with infantry battalions deployed in long lines in\r\nthe centre, and heavy masses of cavalry covering the wings. A glance\r\nat the battle-plans of the War of the Austrian Succession, or of the\r\nSeven Years’ War, shows a marvellous similarity in the general tactical\r\narrangements of the rival hosts, and front-to-front collisions of long\r\nparallel lines were quite common, though commanders of genius had their\r\nown ways of varying the tactics of the day. Frederic the Great’s famous\r\n“oblique order,” or advance in _échelon_, with the strong striking-wing\r\nbrought forward, and the weaker “containing-wing” held back and\r\nrefused, is sufficiently well known. Occasionally he was able to vary\r\nit, as at Rossbach and Leuthen, and to throw the greater part of his\r\ntroops across the enemy’s flank at right angles, so as to roll him up\r\nin detail. But these were “uncovenanted mercies” obtained owing to the\r\nabnormal sloth or unskilfulness of the opposing general. Torgau needs a\r\nspecial word of mention, as Frederic’s only battle fought of choice in\r\na thoroughly irregular formation.\r\n\r\nThere were one or two cases in the old eighteenth-century wars of\r\nengagements won by the piercing of a hostile centre, such as Marshal\r\nSaxe’s victory of Roucoux (1746), and we may find, in other operations\r\nof that great general, instances of the use of deep masses, battalion\r\ndeployed behind battalion, for the attack of a chosen section of\r\nthe hostile position, and others where a line of deployed infantry\r\nwas flanked or supported by units practically in column. But this\r\nwas exceptional—as exceptional as the somewhat similar formation of\r\nCumberland’s mass of British and Hanoverian infantry at Fontenoy,\r\nwhich, though often described as a column, had originally consisted of\r\nthree successive lines of deployed battalions, which were ultimately\r\nconstricted into a mass by lateral pressure. Some of Marshal Broglie’s\r\nand Ferdinand of Brunswick’s fights during the Seven Years’ War were\r\nalso fought in a looser order of battle than was normal.\r\n\r\nNormally the tactics of the eighteenth century were directed to the\r\nsmashing up of one of the enemy’s wings, either by outflanking it,\r\nor by assailing it with very superior forces, while the rest of the\r\nenemy’s army was “contained” by equal or inferior numbers, according\r\nas the assailant had more or less troops than his enemy. The decisive\r\nblow was very frequently delivered by a superior force of cavalry\r\nconcentrated upon the striking wing, which commenced the action by\r\nbreaking down the inferior hostile cavalry, and then turned in upon the\r\nflank of the infantry of the wing which it had assailed. Such a type of\r\nbattle may sometimes be found much later, even in the Peninsular War,\r\nwhere Ocaña was a perfect example of it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frederic II. and Marshal Saxe]\r\n\r\nSpeaking roughly, however, the period of set battles fought by enemies\r\nadvancing against each other in more or less parallel lines ended with\r\nthe outbreak of the war of the French Revolution. There had been a\r\nfierce controversy in France from 1775 to 1791 between the advocates\r\nof the linear, or Frederician, battle-order—headed by General Guibert,\r\nand the officers who wished to introduce a deeper formation, which they\r\nclaimed to have learnt from the instructions of Marshal Saxe—of whom\r\nthe chief was General Menil-Durand. The former school had triumphed\r\njust before the war began, and the _Réglement d’Infanterie_ of 1791\r\naccepted all their views. It was on this drill-book that the French\r\ninfantry stood to fight in the following year, when the war on the\r\nRhine and in Belgium began.[65]\r\n\r\nBut the attempt of the first generals of Revolutionary France to fight\r\non the old linear system was a failure. The troops of the Republic had\r\nbeen demoralized by the removal or desertion of the greater proportion\r\nof their commissioned officers, and their _cadres_ had been hastily\r\nfilled with half-trained recruits. At the same time hundreds of new\r\nunits, the battalions of volunteers, had been formed on no old _cadre_\r\nat all, but, with officers and men alike little better than untrained\r\ncivilians, took the field along with the reorganized remains of the old\r\nroyal army. It is hardly necessary to remark, that these raw armies\r\nsuffered a series of disgraceful defeats at the hands of the Austrian\r\nand other allied troops in 1792–93. They were beaten both in tactics,\r\nin manœuvring, and in fire-discipline by the well-drilled veteran\r\nbattalions to which they were opposed.\r\n\r\nThe French Republic, when it came under the control of the Jacobins,\r\ntried to set matters right by accusing its generals of treason, and\r\narrested and guillotined a considerable proportion of the unfortunate\r\ncommanders-in-chief to whom its armies had been entrusted. But neither\r\nthis heroic device, nor the sending to the armies of the well known\r\n“representatives _en mission_” from the National Assembly, who were to\r\nstimulate the energy of the generals, had satisfactory results. As the\r\nrepresentatives were generally as ignorant of military affairs as they\r\nwere self-important and autocratic, they did no more than confuse and\r\nharass the unhappy generals on whom they were inflicted.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, the Jacobin government did accomplish: it pushed\r\ninto the field reinforcements in such myriads that the armies of\r\nthe allies were hopelessly outnumbered on every frontier. The first\r\nsuccesses of the Republican armies in the North were won by brute\r\nforce, by heaping double and triple numbers upon the enemy. And the new\r\ntactics of the Revolutionary leaders were evolved from a consciousness\r\nof superiority in this respect, a determination to swamp troops that\r\nmanœuvred better than their own, by hurling preponderant masses upon\r\nthem, regardless of the losses that must necessarily be suffered. For\r\nthey had inexhaustible reserves behind them, from the newly-decreed\r\nlevies _en masse_, while the bases of the allies were far off, and\r\ntheir trained men, when destroyed, could only be replaced slowly and\r\nwith difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tactics of the French Revolution]\r\n\r\nWhen the generals of the Revolution threw away the old linear tactics\r\nlearned in the school of Frederic the Great, as inapplicable to troops\r\nthat could not manœuvre with the same speed and accuracy as their\r\nenemies, the improvised system that succeeded was a brutal and wasteful\r\none, but had the merit of allowing them to utilize their superiority\r\nof numbers. It is possible that those of them who reasoned at all upon\r\nthe topic—and reasoning was not easy in that strenuous time, when a\r\ncommander’s head sat lightly on his shoulders—saw that they were in a\r\nmanner utilizing the idea that had been tried in a tentative way by\r\nMaurice de Saxe, and by one or two other generals of the old wars—the\r\nidea that for collision in long line on a parallel front, partial\r\nattacks in heavy masses on designated points might be substituted. But\r\nit is probable that there was more of improvisation than of deliberate\r\ntactical theory in the manœuvres of even the best of them.\r\n\r\nThe usual method was to throw at the hostile front a very thick\r\nskirmishing line, which sheathed and concealed a mass of heavy columns,\r\nconcentrated upon one or two critical points of the field. The idea\r\nwas that the front line of _tirailleurs_ would so engage the enemy,\r\nand keep him occupied all along his front, that at the crucial section\r\nof the combat the supporting columns would get up to striking distance\r\nwith practically no loss, and could be hurled, while still intact, upon\r\nthose points of the hostile array which it was intended to pierce; they\r\nwould go through by their mere impetus and weight, since they were only\r\nexposed to fire for a few minutes, and could endure the loss suffered\r\nin that time without losing their _élan_ or their pace. The essential\r\npart of the system was the enormously thick and powerful skirmishing\r\nline: whole battalions were dispersed in chains of _tirailleurs_, who\r\nfrankly abandoned any attempt at ordered movement, took refuge behind\r\ncover of all sorts, and were so numerous that they could always drive\r\nin the weak skirmishing line of the enemy, and get closely engaged with\r\nhis whole front. The orderly battalion-volleys of the Austrian, or\r\nother allied troops opposed to them, did comparatively little harm to\r\nthese swarms, who were taking cover as much as possible, and presented\r\nno closed body or solid mark for the musketry fire poured upon them.\r\nIt looks as if the proper antidote against such a swarm-attack would\r\nhave been local and partial cavalry charges, by squadrons judiciously\r\ninserted in the hostile line, for nothing could have been more\r\nvulnerable to a sudden cavalry onslaught than a disorderly chain of\r\nlight troops. On many occasions in the campaigns of 1792–93 the French\r\ninfantry had shown itself very helpless against horsemen who pushed\r\ntheir charge home, not only in cases where it was caught unprepared,\r\nbut even when it had succeeded in forming square with more or less\r\npromptitude.[66] But this particular remedy against the swarm-attack\r\ndoes not seem to have been duly employed, and indeed many parts of\r\nFlanders are so cut up by small enclosures, that the use of cavalry as\r\na universal panacea might often have proved impossible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tactics of the French Column]\r\n\r\nThe masses which supported the thick lines of _tirailleurs_ were formed\r\neither in columns of companies or columns of “divisions,” _i.e._ double\r\ncompanies.[67] In the former case the eight companies, each three deep,\r\nwere drawn up behind each other. In the latter the front was formed by\r\na “division,” and the depth was only twelve men. In either case none\r\nbut the two front ranks could use their firearms properly, and the rest\r\nwere useless save for the impetus that they gave the rolling mass. But\r\nsuch a column, when properly sheathed by the skirmishing line till the\r\nlast moment, generally came with a very effective rush against the\r\nallied line opposed to it, which would have been already engaged with\r\nthe _tirailleurs_ for some time, and had probably been much depleted\r\nby their fire. It is equally clear that, without its protective sheath\r\nof skirmishers, such a heavy column would have been a very clumsy\r\ninstrument of war, since it combined the minimum of shooting power\r\nwith the maximum of vulnerability. But when so shielded, the columns\r\nwhich attacked in masses at a decisive spot, leaving the rest of the\r\nhostile line “contained” by an adequate force, had a fair chance of\r\npenetrating, though the process of penetration might during the last\r\ntwo or three minutes be very costly to the troops forming the head of\r\nthe column.\r\n\r\nThe best early summary of this change in French tactics which I know\r\noccurs in an anonymous English pamphlet published in 1802, which puts\r\nthe matter in a nutshell. “The French army was composed of troops of\r\nthe line without order, and of raw and undisciplined volunteers. They\r\nexperienced defeats in the beginning, but in the meantime war was\r\nforming both officers and soldiers. In an open country they took to\r\nforming their armies in columns instead of lines, which they could not\r\npreserve without difficulty. They reduced battles to attacks on certain\r\npoints, where brigade succeeded brigade, and fresh troops supplied\r\nthe places of those who were driven back, till they were enabled to\r\nforce the post, and make the enemy give way. They were fully aware\r\nthat they could not give battle in regular order, and sought to reduce\r\nengagements to important affairs of posts: this plan has succeeded.\r\nThey look upon losses as nothing, provided they attain their end; they\r\nset little store by their men, because they have the certainty of being\r\nable to replace them, and the customary superiority of their numbers\r\naffords them an advantage which can only be counterbalanced by great\r\nskill, conduct, and activity.”[68]\r\n\r\nAfter 1794, when the Republican armies had won their first series\r\nof great successes, and had driven their enemies behind their own\r\nfrontiers, there is a distinct change in the tactical conceptions\r\nof the French. The troops had improved immensely in morale and\r\nself-confidence: a new race of generals had appeared, who were neither\r\nobsessed by reminiscences of the system of Frederic the Great, like\r\nsome of their predecessors, nor spurred to blind violence and the\r\nbrutal expenditure of vast numbers of men like certain others. The\r\nnew generals modified the gross and unscientific methods of the\r\nJacobin armies of 1793–94, which had won victory indeed, but only by\r\nthe force of numbers and with reckless loss of life. There remained\r\nas a permanent lesson, however, from the earlier campaigns two\r\nprinciples—the avoidance of dispersion and extension, by which armies\r\n“cover everything and protect nothing,” and the necessity of striking\r\nat crucial points rather than delivering “linear” battles, fought out\r\nat equal intensity along the whole front. In general French tactics\r\nbecame very supple, the units manœuvring with a freedom which had been\r\nunknown to earlier generations. The system of parting an army into\r\ndivisions, now introduced as a regular organization,[69] gave to the\r\nwhole army a power of independent movement unknown in the days when\r\na line of battle was considered a rigid thing, formed of brigades\r\nranged elbow to elbow, none of which ought to move without the direct\r\norders of the general-in-chief. A front might be composed of separate\r\ndivisions coming on the field by different roads, and each adopting\r\nits own formation, the only necessity being that there should be no\r\ngreat gaps left between them. As a matter of fact this last necessary\r\nprecaution was by no means always observed, and there are cases in\r\nthe middle, and even the later, years of the Revolutionary War, in\r\nwhich French generals brought their armies upon the field in such\r\ndisconnected bodies, and with such want of co-operation and good\r\ntiming, that they were deservedly defeated in detail.[70] Bonaparte\r\nhimself is liable to this charge for his order of attack at Marengo,\r\nwhere he committed himself to a general action before the column of\r\nDesaix was near enough to the field, and as nearly as possible suffered\r\na crushing reverse for the want of a mass of troops whose action was\r\nabsolutely necessary to him. Hoche, Jourdan, and Moreau (the last\r\nespecially), all committed similar mistakes from time to time. But\r\nthese errors were at least better than an adhesion to the stereotyped\r\ntactics of the older generation, where formal set orders of battle had\r\nbeen thought absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disadvantages of the Column]\r\n\r\nAs a rule we find the French operating in the later years of the\r\nRepublic with methods very different from those of 1793, with skill\r\nand swiftness, no longer with the mere brute force of numerical\r\nsuperiority, winning by brilliant manœuvring rather than by mere\r\nbludgeon work. Yet, oddly enough, there was no formal revision of\r\nofficial tactics; the _Reglement d’Infanterie_ which had been drawn\r\nup in 1791, whose base was the old three-deep line of Frederic the\r\nGreat, had never been disowned, even when it was for the most part\r\ndisregarded, in the period when swarm-attacks of _tirailleurs_,\r\nsupported by monstrous heavy columns, had become, perforce, the\r\npractical method of the French armies. When that unsatisfactory time\r\npassed by, the same old drill-book continued to be used, and was no\r\nlonger so remote from actual practice as it had been. For the use of\r\nthe deployed battalion began to come up again, as the handiness of the\r\ntroops increased, and their self-reliance was restored. Only the early\r\nRevolutionary War had left two marks upon French tactics—for hard and\r\nheavy work, such as the forcing of passes, or bridges, or defiles,\r\nor the breaking of a crucial point in the enemy’s line, the deep\r\ncolumn remained habitually employed: while the old idea of the orderly\r\ncontinuous line of battle was gone for ever, or almost gone, for (oddly\r\nenough) in Napoleon’s last and least lucky fight, Waterloo, the order\r\nof the imperial host was more like the trim and symmetrical array of a\r\nFrederician army than any French line of battle that had been seen for\r\nmany a year. Certainly it would have pleased the eye of the Prussian\r\nking much better than the apparently irregular, though carefully\r\nthought out, plans of battle on which Jena or Wagram, Borodino or\r\nBautzen were won.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The “Ordre Mixte”]\r\n\r\nIt would be doing injustice to Napoleon to represent him as a\r\ngeneral whose main tactical method rested solely on the employment\r\nof massive columns for the critical operation on each battlefield.\r\nHe was quite aware that infantry ought to operate by its fire, and\r\nthat every man in the rear ranks is a musket wasted. If the Emperor\r\nhad any favourite formation it was the _ordre mixte_, recommended by\r\nGuibert far back before his own day, in which a certain combination\r\nof the advantages of line and column was obtained, by drawing up the\r\nbrigade or regiment with alternate battalions in line three-deep and\r\nin column. This formation gave a fair amount of frontal fire from the\r\nalternate deployed battalions, while the columns dispersed among them\r\ngave solidity, and immunity from a flank attack by cavalry, which\r\nmight otherwise roll up the line. If, for example, a regiment of three\r\nbattalions of 900 men each were drawn up in the _ordre mixte_, with one\r\ndeployed battalion flanked by two battalions in column, it had about\r\n730 men in the firing line, while if arranged in three columns, it\r\nwould only have had about 200 able to use their muskets freely. Still,\r\nat the best, this formation was heavy, since all the serried back-ranks\r\nof the flanking battalions had no power to join in the fusillade. For\r\nsimple fire-effect it was as inferior to the line as it was superior to\r\nthe mere column.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, however, was certainly fond of it. From the crossing of the\r\nTagliamento (1797), when he is first recorded to have used it, he made\r\nvery frequent employment of it. In a dispatch to Soult, sent him just\r\nbefore Austerlitz, he directed him to use it “_autant que faire se\r\npourra_.” It is curious, however, to note that the marshal, less than a\r\nweek after, having to strike the decisive blow in that battle, did not,\r\nafter all, use the _ordre mixte_, but fought in lines of battalions in\r\n“columns of divisions,” as he particularly mentions in his report to\r\nthe Emperor.[71]\r\n\r\nBut the _ordre mixte_ was certainly employed again and again, not only\r\nin those parts of the battle where Napoleon was simply “containing” his\r\nenemy, and where he was merely keeping up the fight and pinning the\r\nadversary to his position, but also on the crucial points, where he was\r\nendeavouring to deal his main blow. We have notes to the effect that\r\nLannes’ Corps at Jena, Augereau’s at Eylau, and Victor’s at Friedland,\r\nwhich were all “striking forces,” not “containing forces,” used this\r\nformation. Its supposed solidity did not always save it from disaster,\r\nas was seen in the second of the cases quoted above, where Augereau’s\r\nwhole corps, despite of its battalions in column, was ridden down by a\r\nflank attack of Russian cavalry, charging covered by a snowstorm.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of Napoleon’s theoretical preference for the _ordre\r\nmixte_, and his knowledge that the column was a costly formation to\r\nemploy against an enemy whose fire was not subdued, it is certain that\r\nhe used it frequently, not only for the forcing of bridges or defiles\r\n(as at Arcola and Ebersberg[72]), but for giving the final blow at a\r\npoint where he was determined to break through, and where the enemy was\r\nholding on with tiresome persistence. At Wagram the flank-guards of\r\nMacdonald’s conquering advance were formed by 13 battalions in solid\r\ncolumn, one behind the other, though its front consisted of eight\r\ndeployed battalions. Friant’s division on the right wing also attacked\r\nwith three regiments formed “_en colonne serrée par bataillons_.”\r\nAt Friedland, Ney’s right division (Marchand) came to the front in\r\na single file of ten battalions one behind the other, and never got\r\ndeployed, but attacked in mass and was checked. In 1812 and 1813\r\nadvance in heavy masses was usual—whole regiments formed in “column\r\nof divisions,” battalion behind battalion,[73] with only 200 yards’\r\ndistance between regiment and regiment.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was quite aware of the disadvantages of such formations,\r\n“même en plaine,” he observed in a celebrated interview with Foy, “les\r\ncolonnes n’enfoncent les lignes qu’autant qu’elles sont appuyées par\r\nle feu d’une artillerie très supérieure, qui prépare l’attaque.”[74]\r\nAnd his advances in column were habitually prepared by a crushing\r\nartillery fire on the point which he was about to assail, a fire which\r\nhe himself, as an old artillery officer, knew how to direct with the\r\ngreatest accuracy and efficiency. It seems that he relied much more\r\non such preparation by concentrated batteries for the shielding of\r\nhis columns, than on sheathing them by a thick skirmishing line, the\r\nold device of the generals of the Republic. An enemy’s firing line\r\nmight be occupied and demoralized by shot and shell, as well as by a\r\nscreen of skirmishers. Jena, indeed, seems to be about the only one\r\nof his battles in which a hostile line was masked and depleted by a\r\nheavy _tirailleur_ attack, before the columns in support charged and\r\nrouted it. Often the light infantry seems to have been practically\r\nnon-existent, and it was artillery and formed battalions alone which\r\nfought out the engagement. French generals in the imperial campaigns\r\nappear habitually to have used for the skirmishing line no more than\r\nthe _Voltigeur_ company of each battalion,[75] a force making one-ninth\r\nof the whole unit only, till the number of companies was cut down in\r\n1808 from nine to six, when the _Voltigeurs_ became one-sixth of the\r\ntotal. We are very far, by 1805 or 1809, from the day of the great\r\n“swarm-attacks” of the early Republic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tactics of Napoleon’s Generals]\r\n\r\nIt was the tactics of the Empire, not those of the Republic, which\r\nWellington had to face, when he took command of the allied army in\r\nthe Peninsula in 1809. He had to take into consideration an enemy\r\nwhose methods were essentially offensive, whose order of infantry\r\nfighting was at the best—in the _ordre mixte_—rather heavy, and in\r\nmany cases, when the column of the battalion or the regiment was used,\r\nexceptionally gross and crowded. He knew that the enemy would have a\r\nfar more numerous cavalry than was at his own disposition, and that\r\nit would be used with reckless boldness—the cavalry stroke in the\r\nNapoleonic battle accompanied, if it did not precede, the infantry\r\nstroke. Moreover, the French army would have a very powerful and\r\neffective artillery, trained to prepare the way for infantry attacks\r\nby the greatest artillerist in the world. His own proportion of guns\r\nto infantry was ridiculously low: there was not even one battery per\r\ndivision in 1809.\r\n\r\nWhat was there to oppose to this dangerous enemy in the way of\r\ntactical efficiency? Roughly speaking we may say that the one point of\r\nsuperiority on which Wellesley counted, and counted rightly, was the\r\nsuperiority of the English formation for infantry in the two-deep line\r\nto the heavier order of the enemy’s battalions. For this formation he\r\nwas, of course, not responsible himself: he took it over as an accepted\r\nthing, and thought that he knew how to turn it to the best account.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the French War on British tactics had been notable and\r\ninteresting. The first reflections published on the new type of war\r\non this side of the Channel seem to have been mainly inspired by the\r\nexperience of the Duke of York’s army in 1793–94, when the thick chains\r\nof _tirailleurs_, which formed the protective screen, or first line,\r\nof the Republican armies, had done so much damage to troops which\r\nfought them in the old three-deep order, adopted from Frederic the\r\nGreat, without any sufficient counter-provision of skirmishers. We find\r\nearly in the war complaints that the British forces had no adequate\r\nproportion of light troops—that the one light company per battalion,\r\nnormally used, was wholly unable to prevent the French _tirailleur_\r\nswarm from pressing up to the main line, and doing it much harm\r\nbefore the real attack was delivered. Two remedies were proposed—the\r\nfirst was that the proportion of light companies in a battalion\r\nshould be increased from one to two,[76] or that in each regiment a\r\ncertain number of men should be selected for good marksmanship, and\r\ntaught light infantry drill, while still remaining attached to their\r\ncompanies. Of these proposals the first was never tried: the second was\r\nactually practised by certain colonels, who trained fifteen or twenty\r\nmen per company as skirmishers: they were called “flankers,” and were\r\nto go out along with the light company. The only British battle where\r\nI have found them specially mentioned is Maida, where their mention\r\nillustrates the danger of the system. Generals wanting more light\r\ntroops habitually purloined the light companies of regiments to make\r\n“light battalions”; but not only did they do this, but they sometimes\r\neven stole the “flankers” also from the centre companies. Stuart had\r\nat Maida not only the light companies, but also the “flankers” of\r\nregiments left behind in Sicily, which had therefore been deprived of\r\nevery marksman that they possessed—an execrable device. The system,\r\nhowever, was only tentative; it soon disappeared; Wellington never\r\nskimmed the centre companies of their good shots, though he did\r\noccasionally create a light battalion of light companies—even this was\r\nexceptional.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: British use of Light Troops]\r\n\r\nBut there was a second alternative course open to the British: instead\r\nof developing more skirmishers in each battalion, they might create\r\nnew light-infantry corps, or turn whole units of the line into light\r\ntroops. For the former there was good precedent: in the War of the\r\nAmerican Revolution the British generals had of necessity embodied\r\ncorps of riflemen, to oppose to the deadly marksmen from the backwoods\r\nwho formed the most efficient part of the American armies. Such\r\nwere Simcoe’s Rangers, and the dismounted part of Tarleton’s famous\r\nLegion—whose remainder consisted of veritable mounted infantry—the\r\nfirst of their sort in the British army, since dragoons had forgotten\r\ntheir old trade and become cavalry of the line. But all the Rangers,\r\netc., had been disbanded in 1783, and their use seems to have been\r\nforgotten before the French War began; the system had to begin again\r\n_de novo_. It was not till 1798 that the first British rifle battalion\r\nwas created, to wit the 5th Battalion of the 60th Regiment, or Royal\r\nAmericans, which was formed as a Jäger unit out of the remains of\r\nmany defunct foreign light corps in British pay: it remained mainly\r\nGerman in composition even during the Peninsular War. This was the\r\nfirst green-coated battalion; the second was Coote Manningham’s\r\n“Experimental Rifle Corps,” formed in January, 1800, and finally taken\r\ninto the service after some vicissitudes, as the 95th—a name famous\r\nin Peninsular annals, though now almost obliterated by its new title\r\nof the “Rifle Brigade.” The regiment was enlarged to three battalions\r\nbefore it came into Wellington’s hands. Later on, though the number of\r\nrifle corps was not increased, yet an addition was made to the light\r\ntroops of the British army by turning certain picked battalions into\r\nlight infantry. They were armed with a special musket of light weight,\r\nnot with a rifle, and all the companies equally were instructed in\r\nskirmishing work. The first corps so treated was the 90th or Perthshire\r\nLight Infantry, which received the title in 1794. The precedent was\r\nnot, however, acted on again till in 1803, the 43rd and 52nd, the\r\nfamous regiments of the Peninsular Light Division, were honoured with\r\nthe same designation. The last additions during the period of the\r\nNapoleonic wars were the 68th and 85th in 1808, and the 51st and 71st\r\nin 1809. Most of these corps had two battalions, but, even so, the\r\nprovision of light infantry was not large for an army which had then\r\nnearly 200 battalions embodied. There were also some foreign corps to\r\nbe taken into consideration, which stood on the British muster-rolls,\r\nsuch as the two Light Battalions of the King’s German Legion, the\r\nBrunswick Oels Jägers, and the Chasseurs Britanniques, who all four\r\nserved in the Peninsula. All these save the last were created after\r\n1803: but at least during the second period of the great French War,\r\nour armies were not practically destitute of light troops, as they were\r\nin 1793. We shall see that this had no small importance in Wellington’s\r\ntactical devices.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The British Two-deep Line]\r\n\r\nThe other lesson that might possibly have been deduced from the\r\ncampaigns of the earlier years of the great war was the efficacy of\r\ncolumns for striking at the critical points of an enemy’s line. The\r\ncontinental enemies of France were affected by what they had seen\r\nof this sort of success, and often copied the formation of their\r\nadversaries. But it is notable that the old and wholesome prejudice of\r\nthe British in favour of the line was in no way disturbed by what had\r\nhappened of late. The idea that the column was a clumsy and expensive\r\nformation was not shaken, and the theory that infantry ought to win by\r\nthe rapidity and accuracy of its shooting, and that every musket not\r\nin the firing-line was wasted, continued to prevail. The reply of the\r\nBritish to the _ordre mixte_ was to reduce the depth of the deployed\r\nbattalion from three ranks to two, because it had been discovered\r\nthat the fire of the third rank was difficult, dangerous to those in\r\nfront, and practically ineffective. Sir David Dundas’s drill-book\r\nof 1788 with its Prussian three ranks, which had been the official\r\nguide of the British infantry of late, was not formally cancelled at\r\nfirst, but it was practically disregarded, and the army went back\r\nto the two-rank array, which it had habitually used in the American\r\nWar, and had abandoned with regret. Apparently the Duke of York did\r\nnot altogether approve this change: he at least once issued a General\r\nOrder, to remind colonels that the formation in three ranks was still\r\nofficially recognized and ought not to be forgotten. But the permission\r\ngiven by an order in 1801, that inspecting officers might allow\r\nregiments to appear “even at reviews” in the two ranks, probably marked\r\nthe practical end of the Prussian system.[77] It had certainly been\r\ndisused by many officers long before that date, and it is certain that\r\nin Abercrombie’s Egyptian campaign the double instead of the triple\r\nrank was in general use.[78] British military opinion had decided that\r\nfire was everything, and that the correct answer to the French columnar\r\nattack was to put more men into the firing line.\r\n\r\nA conclusive proof of the efficacy of the double when opposed to the\r\ntriple rank was very clearly given at the half-forgotten Calabrian\r\nbattle of Maida, three years after the commencement of the second half\r\nof the great French War. At this fight the French General Reynier\r\nhad deployed the whole, or the greater part, of his battalions, who\r\nwere not as usual fighting either in _ordre mixte_ or in battalion\r\ncolumn. The result was very decisive—5000 British infantry in the\r\nthinner formation received the attack of 6000 French in the heavier,\r\nand inflicted on them, purely by superior fire-efficiency, one of the\r\nmost crushing defeats on a small scale that was ever seen, disabling or\r\ntaking 2000 men, with a total loss to themselves of only 320.[79] It is\r\nworth while remembering that some of the officers who were afterwards\r\nto be Wellington’s trusted lieutenants were present at Maida, including\r\nCole, Kempt, Oswald, and Colborne.[79] This was about the only instance\r\nthat I know where English and French came into action both deployed,\r\nand on a more or less parallel front. Usually it was a case of “column\r\nagainst line.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington’s System]\r\n\r\nSir Arthur Wellesley had been nine years absent in India before he\r\nreturned to England in 1805, so that he had to learn the difference\r\nbetween the Republican and the Imperial armies by new experience. The\r\nproblem had long been interesting him. Before he left Calcutta he is\r\nsaid to have remarked to his confidants that the French were sweeping\r\neverything before them in Europe by the use of column formations, but\r\nthat he was convinced that the column could, and would, be beaten by\r\nthe line. What he heard after his return to England evidently confirmed\r\nhim in this opinion. A conversation which he had with Croker, just\r\nbefore he set sail on the expedition which was to end at Vimeiro,\r\nchances to have been preserved in the latter’s papers, under the date,\r\nJune 14, 1808. Sitting silent, lost in reverie for a long time, he was\r\nasked by Croker the subject of his thoughts. “To say the truth,” he\r\nreplied, “I am thinking of the French I am going to fight. I have not\r\nseen them since the campaigns in Flanders [1793–94] when they were\r\ncapital soldiers, and a dozen years of victory under Bonaparte must\r\nhave made them better still. ’Tis enough to make one thoughtful. But\r\nthough they may overwhelm me, I don’t think that they will outmanœuvre\r\nme. First, because I am not afraid of them, as every one else seems\r\nto be, and secondly, because (if all I hear about their system is\r\ntrue) I think it a false one against steady troops. I suspect all the\r\ncontinental armies are half-beaten before the battle begins. I at least\r\nwill not be frightened beforehand.”\r\n\r\nWellesley went out to Portugal, there to try what could be done with\r\nsteady troops against the “French system.” But it would be to convey a\r\nfalse impression of his meaning if we were to state that he simply went\r\nout to beat column with line—though the essential fact is sufficiently\r\ntrue. He went out to try his own conception of the proper way to use\r\nthe line formation, which had its peculiarities and its limitations.\r\nThe chief of these were that—\r\n\r\n(1) The line must not be exposed before the moment of actual conflict:\r\n_i.e._ it must be kept under cover as much as possible.\r\n\r\n(2) That till the critical moment it must be screened by a line of\r\nskirmishers impenetrable to the enemy’s _tirailleurs._\r\n\r\n(3) That it must be properly covered on its flanks, either by the\r\nnature of the ground, or by cavalry and artillery.\r\n\r\nWhen we investigate all his earlier pitched battles, we shall see that\r\neach of these three requisites was as far as possible secured.\r\n\r\n(1) It was necessary for success that the line should be kept concealed\r\nfrom the enemy’s distant fire of artillery and infantry as long as\r\npossible. Hence we find that one of the most marked features of\r\nWellesley’s many defensive battles was that he took up, whenever it was\r\nfeasible, a position which would mask his main line, and show nothing\r\nto the enemy but his skirmishers and possibly his artillery, for the\r\nlatter having to operate before the infantry fighting began, and being\r\nobliged to take up positions which would command the ground over which\r\nthe enemy must advance, were often visible from the first. At Vimeiro,\r\nWellesley so concealed his army that Junot, thinking to turn his left\r\nflank, found his turning column itself outflanked by troops moved under\r\ncover behind a skyline. At Bussaco, Masséna, no mean general, mistook\r\nWellington’s centre for his extreme right, and found his attacking\r\ncolumns[80] well outflanked when the attack had been pressed to its\r\nissue. At Salamanca it was much the same; the main part of the British\r\nline was well concealed behind a low ridge of hills, while Pakenham’s\r\ndivision and its attendant cavalry, the force which executed the great\r\nstroke, were concealed in a wooded tract, far outside the French\r\nmarching column that vainly thought to get round the allied right\r\nwing. At Waterloo, the clearest case of all, the whole of Wellington’s\r\ninfantry of the front line was so far drawn back from the edge of\r\nthe slope that it was invisible, till the enemy had climbed to the\r\nbrow of the plateau on which it was arrayed. Only the artillery, the\r\nskirmishing line, and the troops in the outlying posts of Hougoumont\r\nand La Haye Sainte could be made out by Napoleon’s eye. Talavera, as I\r\nshall mention below, is the only exception to this general rule in the\r\nDuke’s defensive battles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Advantages of Cover]\r\n\r\nWellington’s ideal position was a rising ground with a long _glacis_\r\nof slope in front, and a plateau or a dip behind it. The infantry was\r\ndrawn back from the skyline, and placed behind the crest, if the hill\r\nwere saddle-backed, or some hundreds of yards away from the edge, if it\r\nwere flat-topped. There they stood or lay till they were wanted, secure\r\nfrom artillery fire: they moved forward to their actual fighting ground\r\nonly when the fire-combat of infantry was to begin. Every one will\r\nremember Wellington’s caustic comment on the Prussian order of battle\r\nat Ligny, where Blücher had drawn out his army in a chequered array\r\nall along the declivity of a descending slope. “Damnably mauled these\r\nfellows will be—every man visible to the enemy.”[81] Or in more solemn\r\nphrase, as he afterwards consigned it to paper: “I told the Prussian\r\nofficers, in the presence of Colonel Hardinge, that according to my\r\njudgment, the exposure of the advanced columns, and indeed of the army,\r\nto cannonade, standing as they did displayed to the aim of the enemy’s\r\nfire, was not prudent.”[82]\r\n\r\nBy the end of the Peninsular War, as I have already had occasion to\r\nobserve, it had become so well known to the French that Wellington’s\r\narmy, ready for a battle, would be under cover, that he was able, as at\r\nFuente Guinaldo in 1811, and at Sorauren in 1813, to play off on them\r\nthe trick of offering to fight in a half-manned position, because he\r\nknew that they would take it for granted that the ground invisible to\r\nthem was held by an adequate force. There is an interesting testimony\r\nto the same effect in the Waterloo campaign. On the morning before the\r\nbattle of Quatre Bras began, General Reille, a veteran of the Spanish\r\nwar, remained halted for some time before a position held by nothing\r\nbut a single Dutch-Belgian division, because (as he expressed it), “Ce\r\npourrait bien être une bataille d’Espagne—les troupes Anglaises se\r\nmontreraient quand il en serait temps.”[83] This was the lesson taught\r\nby many years of Peninsular experience—but on this occasion it chanced\r\nto be singularly ill applied—since a vigorous push would have shown\r\nReille that there were as yet no red-coats concealed behind the trees\r\nof the Bois de Bossu.\r\n\r\nIt was only when absolute necessity compelled, owing to there being no\r\ncover available in some parts of his chosen position, that Wellington\r\nvery occasionally left troops in his battle-front visible to the\r\nenemy, and exposed to artillery fire from a distance. The best known\r\ninstance of this occurred with his centre brigades at Talavera, who\r\nwere unmasked perforce, because between the strong hill which protected\r\nhis left, and the olive groves which covered his right, there were\r\nmany hundred yards of open ground, without any serviceable dips or\r\nundulations to conceal the line. And this was almost the only battle in\r\nwhich we find record of his troops having suffered heavily by artillery\r\nfire before the clash of infantry fighting began.[84]\r\n\r\n(2) The second postulate of Wellington’s system was, as I have remarked\r\nabove, that the infantry of his battle-line must be covered by such\r\na powerful screen of skirmishers, that the enemy’s advanced line of\r\n_tirailleurs_ should never be able to get near enough to it to cause\r\nany real molestation, and that it should not be seriously engaged\r\nbefore the French supporting columns came up to deliver the main\r\nattack. His old experience in Flanders in 1794 had taught him that the\r\nline cannot contend at advantage with a swarm of light troops, who\r\nyield when charged, but return the moment that the charge has stopped\r\nand the line has drawn back to its original position. There were evil\r\nmemories of this sort not only from Flanders, but from the Egyptian\r\nExpedition of 1801, when Abercrombie’s less engaged brigades suffered\r\nseverely at the battle of Alexandria from the incessant fire of\r\nskirmishers at long range, to whom no proper opposition was made.[85]\r\n\r\nThe device which Wellesley practised was to make sure that he should\r\nalways have a skirmishing screen of his own, so strong that the French\r\n_tirailleurs_ should never be able to force it in and to get close to\r\nthe main line. The moment that he had assumed command in April, 1809,\r\nhe set to work to secure this _desideratum_. His first measure was to\r\nadd to every brigade in his army an extra company of trained riflemen,\r\nto reinforce the three light companies of the brigade.[86] In April,\r\n1809, he broke up the oldest rifle battalion in the British army, the\r\nfifth of the 60th regiment, and began to distribute a company of it to\r\neach of his brigades, save to those of the King’s German Legion, which\r\nwere served by special rifle companies of their own.[87] Thus each of\r\nthe brigades which fought at Talavera had a special extra provision of\r\nlight troops. Furthermore, when the new Light Division was instituted\r\non the 1st of March, 1810, each of its two brigades was given a number\r\nof companies of the 95th rifles: and of the other brigades formed in\r\n1810–11 most were provided with an extra light company by means of\r\ntaking fractions from the 95th or the newly arrived Brunswick Oels\r\nJägers, and those which were not, had light-infantry corps of their own\r\ninside them. But this was not all.[88]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ample Provision of Light Troops]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1810, Wellington began the system of incorporating\r\na Portuguese brigade of five battalions in each British division. Of\r\nthese five one was always[89] a Caçador or light battalion, specially\r\ntrained for skirmishing. The old Portuguese army had not included\r\nsuch battalions, which were all newly raised corps, intended entirely\r\nfor light infantry work. There were originally only six of them, but\r\nWellington ordered a second six to be raised in 1811, utilizing as\r\nthe cadre of the 7th, 8th, 9th the old Loyal Lusitanian Legion, which\r\nSir Robert Wilson had formed early in the war. As the Portuguese army\r\ncontained just twenty-four regiments of the line, in twelve brigades,\r\nthe Caçador battalion gave precisely one unit to each brigade, save\r\nthat two were incorporated in the Light Division, while none was left\r\nwith the two regiments which remained behind in garrison at Abrantes\r\nand at Cadiz respectively.\r\n\r\nAs the Caçador battalions were essentially light troops, and used\r\nwholly for skirmishing, it resulted that when an Anglo-Portuguese\r\ndivision of the normal strength of six British and five Portuguese\r\nbattalions set itself in battle array, it sent out a skirmishing line\r\nof no less than eight British and ten Portuguese companies, viz. one\r\neach from the line battalions, two of British rifles, six of Caçadores,\r\nor a total of from 1200 to 1500 men to a total strength of 5000 to\r\n5500. This, as will be obvious, was a very powerful protective sheath\r\nto cover the front of the division. It was not always required—the\r\nFrench did not invariably send out a skirmishing line in advance of\r\ntheir main attack: but when they did, it would always be restrained\r\nand kept off from the main front of the divisional line. If the enemy\r\nwished to push it in, he had to bring up his formed battalions through\r\nhis _tirailleurs_, and thus only could he reach the front of battle.\r\nThe French regiments, whether formed in _ordre mixte_ or (as was more\r\ncommon) in column, had to come to the front, and only so could reach\r\nthe hitherto intact British line. It may be noted that the enemy rarely\r\nused for his skirmishing line more than the _voltigeur_ company of\r\neach battalion; as his divisions averaged ten to twelve battalions[90]\r\nand the unit was a six-company battalion of 600 men or under, with\r\nonly one _voltigeur_ company, a French division would send out 1000 to\r\n1200 skirmishers, a force appreciably less than the light troops of a\r\nBritish division of approximately equal force. Hence Wellington never\r\nseems to have been seriously incommoded by the French skirmishers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advantages of the Skirmishing Screen]\r\n\r\nSo considerable was the British screen of light troops that the French\r\nnot unfrequently mistook it for a front line, and speak of their column\r\nas piercing or thrusting back the first line of their opponents, when\r\nall that they had done was to drive in a powerful and obstinate body\r\nof skirmishers bickering in front of the real fighting formation.[91]\r\nInvariably, we may say, they had to use their columns to attack the\r\ntwo-deep line while the latter was still intact, while their own masses\r\nhad already been under fire for some time and were no longer fresh.\r\n\r\nIt will be asked, perhaps, why the marshals and generals of Napoleon\r\ndid not deploy their columns before the moment of contact. Why do we so\r\nseldom read of even the _ordre mixte_ in use—Albuera is the only battle\r\nwhere we distinctly find it mentioned? The answer to this objection\r\nis, firstly, that they were strongly convinced that the column was\r\nthe better striking force to carry a given point, and that they were\r\nnormally attacking not the whole British line but the particular\r\nsection or sections where they intended to break through. But,\r\nsecondly, we may add that they frequently did attempt to deploy, but\r\nalways too late, since they waited till they had driven in the British\r\nskirmishing line, and tried to assume the thinner formation when they\r\nwere already under fire and heavily engaged. It was not always that\r\nthe British noted this endeavour—so late was it begun, so instant was\r\nits failure. But there is evidence that it was tried by Kellermann’s\r\ngrenadiers at Vimeiro, by part at least of Leval’s division at Barrosa,\r\nby Merle’s column at Bussaco, when it had already reached the summit\r\nof the Serra, and was closely engaged with Picton’s troops. At Albuera\r\nwe have a good description of it from the British side. When Myers’\r\nfusilier brigade marched against the flank of the 5th Corps, in the\r\ncrisis of that battle, Soult launched against them his reserve, the\r\nthree regiments of Werlé, which became at once locked in combat at\r\nvery short range with the fusiliers. “During the close action,”\r\nwrites a British officer (Blakeney of the 7th), “I saw their officers\r\nendeavouring to deploy their columns, but all to no purpose. For as\r\nsoon as the third of a company got out, they would immediately run back\r\nin order to be covered by the front of their column.” The fact was,\r\nthat the effect of the fire of a British regiment far exceeded anything\r\nthat the enemy had been wont to cope with when engaged with continental\r\ntroops, and was altogether devastating. Again and again French officers\r\nwho came under it for the first time, made the miscalculation of\r\ntrying the impossible. Nothing could be more inevitably productive\r\nof confusion and disorder than to attempt deployment under such a\r\nheavy fire. Wherefore many French commanders never tried it at all,\r\nand thought it more safe to go on to the final shock with their\r\nbattalions in the usual “column of divisions,” in which they had begun\r\ntheir attack. This was little better, and quite as costly in the end.\r\n“Really,” wrote Wellington, in a moment of unwonted exhilaration, after\r\nthe combat of Sabugal, “these attacks in column against our lines are\r\nvery contemptible.”[92] This was after he had viewed from the other\r\nbank of the Coa, “where I could see every movement on both sides,” the\r\n43rd regiment repulse in succession three attacks by French columns\r\nwhich came up against it, one after the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Necessity of Flank Cover]\r\n\r\n(3) We now come to the third postulate of Wellington’s system—the\r\ntwo-deep fighting line must be covered on its flanks, either by the\r\nground, or by cavalry and artillery support, or by infantry prolonging\r\nthe front beyond the enemy’s immediate point of action. At Talavera\r\none of his flanks was covered by a precipitous hill, the other by\r\nthick olive plantations. At Bussaco both the French attacks were\r\nhopelessly outflanked by troops posted on high and inaccessible ground,\r\nand could only be pushed frontally. At Fuentes de Oñoro the final\r\nfighting position rested on a heavily occupied village at one end, and\r\non the ravine of the Turon river upon the other. At Salamanca the 3rd\r\nDivision, the striking-force which won the battle, had its line covered\r\non its outer flank by a British and a Portuguese brigade of cavalry.\r\nAt Vittoria the whole French army was enveloped by the concentric\r\nand converging attack of the much longer British line. At Waterloo\r\nflank protection was secured by the advanced post of Hougoumont and\r\na “refused” right wing at one end of the position: by the group of\r\nfortified farms (Papelotte, La Haye, etc.), and a mass of cavalry\r\nat the other. Wellington, in short, was very careful of his flanks.\r\nOnly once indeed, so far as I remember, did the French get round the\r\noutlying end of his army and cause him trouble. This was in the first\r\nepisode of Fuentes de Oñoro, where the 7th Division, placed some way\r\nout, as a flank-guard, suffered some loss by being taken in rear\r\nby French cavalry which had made a great circuit, and only escaped\r\nworse disaster because two of its battalions, the 51st and _Chasseurs\r\nBritanniques_, had time to form front to flank, and adapt themselves\r\nto the situation, and because a few British squadrons sacrificed\r\nthemselves in checking, so long as was possible, the enemy’s superior\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nThere was one universally remembered instance during the war which\r\ndemonstrated the terrible risk that the line might run if it were not\r\nproperly protected on the flanks. At Albuera Colborne’s brigade of\r\nthe 2nd Division was thrown into the fight with its flank absolutely\r\nbare—there was no support within half a mile—by the recklessness of its\r\ndivisional general, William Stewart. It was caught unprepared by two\r\nregiments of French cavalry, charging in at an angle, almost on its\r\nrear, and three battalions were literally cut to pieces, with a loss of\r\n1200 men out of 1600 present, and five colours. Wellington would never\r\nhave sent it forward without the proper support on its wings, and it\r\nis noteworthy that, later on the same day, Cole took the 4th Division\r\ninto action on the same hill, and against the same enemy, with perfect\r\nsuccess, because he had guarded one flank with a battalion in column,\r\nand the other (the outer and more exposed one) with a battalion in\r\nsquare and a brigade of cavalry.\r\n\r\nThese, then, were the necessary postulates required for the successful\r\nuse of line against column, and when they were duly borne in mind,\r\nvictory was secure with any reasonable balance in numbers. The\r\nessential fact that lay behind the oft-observed conclusion was simply\r\nthat the two-deep line enabled a force to use every musket with effect,\r\nwhile the “column of divisions” put seven-ninths of the men forming it\r\nin a position where they could not shoot at all, and even the _ordre\r\nmixte_ praised by Napoleon placed from seven-twelfths to two-thirds of\r\nthe rank and file in the same unhappy condition.[93] But Albuera is the\r\nonly fight in the war in which there is definite proof that the enemy\r\nfought in the _ordre mixte_ with deployed battalions and battalions\r\nin column ranged alternately in his front.[94] Usually he came on\r\nwith his units all in columns of divisions, and very frequently (as at\r\nBussaco and in certain episodes at Talavera) he had battalion behind\r\nbattalion in each regiment. It was a gross order of fighting, but\r\nD’Erlon invented a worse and a more clumsy formation at Waterloo, where\r\nhe sent forward whole divisions with eight or nine battalions deployed\r\none behind the other, so as to produce a front of only 200 men and a\r\ndepth of twenty-four—with only one man in twelve able to use his musket.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Superior Fire of the Line]\r\n\r\nClearly, however, the column of divisions (double companies) was the\r\nnormal French order, _i.e._ in a battalion of 600 men in six companies,\r\nwe should get a front of 66 muskets and 132 men able to fire, while\r\n468 were in the rear ranks, able to be shot but not to shoot. If an\r\nEnglish battalion of equal strength lay in front, in its two-deep\r\nline, it could give a discharge of 600 muskets against one of 132, and\r\nthis was not all. Its front was nearly five times that of the French\r\nbattalion, so that its fire lapped round the flanks of the advancing\r\nmass, demoralizing it because there was no proper power to reply. Often\r\nthe British line, during the moments of fire-combat, somewhat threw\r\nforward its wings in a shallow crescent, and blazed with three sides of\r\nthe column at once. This was done by the 43rd and 52nd at Bussaco, with\r\ngreat effect, against the French brigade, that of Simon, which came\r\nup the slope in front of them, with its leading regiment ranged three\r\nbattalions deep, in a most vulnerable array. How could it be expected\r\nthat the column would prevail? Effective against an enemy who allowed\r\nhimself to be cowed and beaten by the sight of the formidable advancing\r\nmass, it was helpless against steady troops, who stood their ground and\r\nemptied their muskets, as fast as they could load, into a mark which\r\nit was impossible to miss. This, probably, is what Wellington meant\r\nwhen (as mentioned above) he stated to Croker, ere ever he sailed for\r\nPortugal, that “if all I hear about their system is true, I think it a\r\nfalse one against steady troops. I suspect all the continental armies\r\nare half-beaten before the battle begins.” That is to say, the column\r\nmight win by the terror that its massive weight and impetus inspired;\r\nbut if the enemy refused to be terrorized, he would be able to hold his\r\nown, and to inflict enormous losses on the crowded formation.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to be said that, with the battalion in column of\r\ndivisions as unit, the French had two ways of drawing up their\r\nattacking line. They might either draw up the battalions of each\r\nregiment in a line of columns, or they might place them one behind the\r\nother, making the whole regiment into a single column. Both methods\r\nwere from time to time employed. It was not details of arrangement\r\nlike this which made the difference—the essential weakness was the\r\n“column of divisions” which formed the base of all the array—it was too\r\nhelpless in fire-contest against the line.\r\n\r\nThe physical aspect of the contest between line and column we have\r\nnow sufficiently dealt with. What was the moral aspect? Fortunately\r\nwe can explain it with accuracy, because one of the many thousands\r\nof French officers who went through the Peninsular War has left us,\r\nnot personal anecdotes or confused impressions like so many of his\r\nfellows, but a real account of the mental state of a battalion going\r\nforward in column to attack the British line. I make no excuse for\r\nquoting in full the paragraphs of Bugeaud, a _chef de bataillon_ in\r\n1812—a marshal of African fame thirty years later—because they give\r\nus exactly what we want to know. It should be premised, however, that\r\nBugeaud did not serve in the Army of Portugal, nor face Wellington’s\r\nown troops. He served in Suchet’s army, along the Mediterranean Coast\r\nof the Peninsula, and his personal observations must have been made at\r\nCastalla and other combats in the East. It is to be noted also that he\r\ngives no account of the clash of skirmishers which so often took place,\r\nand describes his column as going forward unsheathed to the main clash\r\nof battle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bugeaud on Column versus Line]\r\n\r\n“I served seven years in the Peninsula,” he says; “during that time we\r\nsometimes beat the English in isolated encounters and raids [_e.g._\r\nOrdal] which as a field officer detached I was able to prepare and\r\ndirect. But during that long period of war, it was my sorrow to see\r\nthat only in a very small number of general actions did the British\r\narmy fail to get the better of us. We almost invariably attacked\r\nour adversaries, without either taking into account our own past\r\nexperience, or bearing in mind that the tactics which answered well\r\nenough when we had only Spaniards to deal with, almost invariably\r\nfailed when an English force was in our front.\r\n\r\n“The English generally held good defensive positions, carefully\r\nselected and usually on rising ground, behind the crest of which\r\nthey found cover for a good part of their men. The usual obligatory\r\ncannonade would commence the operation, then, in haste, without duly\r\nreconnoitring the position, without ascertaining whether the ground\r\nafforded any facilities for lateral or turning movements, we marched\r\nstraight forward, ‘taking the bull by the horns.’[95]\r\n\r\n“When we got to about a thousand yards from the English line the men\r\nwould begin to get restless and excited: they exchanged ideas with\r\none another, their march began to be somewhat precipitate, and was\r\nalready growing a little disorderly. Meanwhile the English, silent\r\nand impassive, with grounded arms, loomed like a long red wall; their\r\naspect was imposing—it impressed novices not a little. Soon the\r\ndistance began to grow shorter: cries of ‘_Vive l’Empereur_,’ ‘_en\r\navant à la baïonnette_,’ broke from our mass. Some men hoisted their\r\nshakos on their muskets, the quick-step became a run: the ranks began\r\nto be mixed up: the men’s agitation became tumultuous, many soldiers\r\nbegan to fire as they ran. And all the while the red English line,\r\nstill silent and motionless, even when we were only 300 yards away,\r\nseemed to take no notice of the storm which was about to beat upon it.\r\n\r\n“The contrast was striking. More than one among us began to reflect\r\nthat the enemy’s fire, so long reserved, would be very unpleasant when\r\nit did break forth. Our ardour began to cool: the moral influence\r\n(irresistible in action) of a calm which seems undisturbed as opposed\r\nto disorder which strives to make up by noise what it lacks in\r\nfirmness, weighed heavily on our hearts.\r\n\r\n“At this moment of painful expectation the English line would make a\r\nquarter-turn—the muskets were going up to the ‘ready.’ An indefinable\r\nsensation nailed to the spot many of our men, who halted and opened a\r\nwavering fire. The enemy’s return, a volley of simultaneous precision\r\nand deadly effect, crashed in upon us like a thunderbolt. Decimated by\r\nit we reeled together, staggering under the blow and trying to recover\r\nour equilibrium. Then three formidable _Hurrahs_ termined the long\r\nsilence of our adversaries. With the third they were down upon us,\r\npressing us into a disorderly retreat. But to our great surprise, they\r\ndid not pursue their advantage for more than some hundred yards, and\r\nwent back with calm to their former lines, to await another attack. We\r\nrarely failed to deliver it when our reinforcements came up—with the\r\nsame want of success and heavier losses.”[96]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Helplessness of the Column]\r\n\r\nThis is the picture that we need to complete our study of the conflict\r\nof column with line. The psychology of the huddled mass going forward\r\nto inevitable defeat could not be better portrayed. The only thing that\r\nis hard for us to understand is the reason which induced capable men\r\nlike Soult, D’Erlon, or Foy to continue to use the columnar formation\r\nall through the dark days of 1813–14, and even in the final campaign of\r\nWaterloo. All honour must be paid, however, to the rank and file who,\r\nwith five years of such experience behind them, were still steadfast\r\nand courageous enough to put up a good fight even in their last\r\noffensive battles in the Pyrenees, as well as in the defensive actions\r\nof Orthez and Toulouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON’S TACTICS—THE CAVALRY AND ARTILLERY\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto we have been confining our outlook on Wellington’s tactics\r\nto his use of infantry. But a few words must be added as to his\r\nmethods of handling the other two arms—cavalry and artillery. There\r\nare fortunately one or two _memoranda_ of his own which enable us\r\nto interpret his views on the use of these arms, which were to him\r\nmainly auxiliary; for the epigram that he was “essentially an infantry\r\ngeneral” is in the main correct, though it needs some comment and\r\nexplanation. In the early part of his Peninsular campaigning he was\r\nforced to be an “infantry general,” since the home government kept him\r\nunreasonably short in the matter of horsemen and guns till the year\r\n1811 was far spent. Moreover, the ground over which he had to fight in\r\n1809–10–11 must be considered.\r\n\r\nThe Iberian Peninsula may from the point of view of the cavalry\r\ntactician be divided into two sets of regions, in the one of which the\r\nmounted arm is all-important, while in the other it may, almost without\r\nexaggeration, be described as well-nigh negligible as an element of\r\nmilitary strength, being only usable on a small scale, for exploration\r\nand observation, and not being able to be employed effectively in mass.\r\n\r\nTo the first-named class of regions, the tracts eminently suitable for\r\nthe employment of cavalry, belong the great plateau of Central Spain,\r\nthe broad arable plains of Old Castile and Leon, from Burgos to Ciudad\r\nRodrigo and from Astorga to Aranda. Here, in a gently undulating\r\nupland, little enclosed, and mainly laid out in great common-fields,\r\ncavalry has one of the suitable terrains that can be found for it in\r\nEurope—as favourable as Champagne, or the lowlands of Northern Germany.\r\nThis is also, almost to the same extent, the case with the loftier and\r\nless cultivated plateau of New Castile, and with the melancholy thinly\r\npeopled moors of La Mancha and Estremadura, where the horseman may ride\r\nahead for twenty or thirty miles without meeting any serious natural\r\nobstacle, save at long intervals the steep cleft of a ravine, dry in\r\nsummer, full of a fierce stream in winter. Nor are the great central\r\nuplands the only tracts of Spain where cavalry finds an admirable field\r\nfor operations: the central valley of the Ebro in Aragon, and the\r\nwhole of the broad plain of the Guadalquivir in Andalusia, are equally\r\nsuited for the employment of the mounted arm, on the largest scale.\r\nNapoleon, therefore, was entirely justified when he attached a very\r\nlarge proportion of horse to his Army of Spain, and when he uttered his\r\n_dictum_ that great portions of it must inevitably be the possession\r\nof the general who owned the larger and the more efficient mass of\r\nsquadrons.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are large tracts of the Peninsula where\r\ncavalry is almost as useless as in Switzerland or Calabria. Such are\r\nthe whole Pyrenean tract on the north, extending from Catalonia, by\r\nAragon and Navarre, to the Asturian and Galician lands along the\r\nsouthern shore of the Bay of Biscay. It will be remembered that, during\r\nthe Pyrenean Campaign of 1813, Wellington sent back very nearly all his\r\ncavalry to the plain of the Ebro, while Soult left his in the plain of\r\nthe Adour. Sir John Moore’s small but fine cavalry force was useless\r\nto him in the Corunna retreat, when once Astorga had been passed, and\r\nthe Galician mountains entered. He sent it on before him, with the\r\nexception of a squadron or two kept with the rear-guard. Soult’s more\r\nnumerous mounted force, in that same campaign, was only useful in\r\npicking up Moore’s stragglers, and keeping the British continuously on\r\nthe march—it was brought to a dead stop every time that the retreating\r\narmy showed an infantry rear-guard, and stood at bay in one of the\r\ninnumerable Galician defiles.\r\n\r\nThere is another tract of the Peninsula almost as unsuited as the\r\nPyrenean and Galician highlands for the use of cavalry—and that is\r\nPortugal, where so much of Wellington’s earlier campaigning took place.\r\nDeducting some coast plains of comparatively small extent, all Northern\r\nand Central Portugal is mountainous—not for the most part mountainous\r\non a large scale, with high summits and broad valleys, but mountainous\r\non a small scale with rugged hills of 2000 or 3000 feet, between\r\nwhich flow deeply-sunk torrents in narrow ravines—where roads are all\r\nuphill and downhill and a defile occurs every few miles. It was the\r\ncharacter of this countryside which made Wellington’s army of 1810–11,\r\nwith its very small cavalry force—only seven British and four or five\r\nPortuguese regiments—safe against Masséna’s immensely preponderant\r\nnumber of squadrons. All through the long retreat from Almeida to the\r\nlines of Torres Vedras the allied army could never be caught, turned,\r\nor molested; the cavalry on both sides was only employed in petty\r\nrear-guard actions, in which the small force brought the larger to a\r\ncheck in defiles, and generally gave back only when the invader brought\r\nup infantry to support his attack. For all the good that it did him,\r\nMasséna might have left his 7000 cavalry behind him when he entered\r\nPortugal—a few squadrons for exploration was all that he needed. Jammed\r\nin narrow defiles, where they were helpless, his mounted men were often\r\nmore of an incumbrance than a help to him.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when the slopes of the Portuguese mountains were\r\nonce left behind, Wellington was forced to be most cautious, and to\r\nrestrict his action to favourable ground (as at Talavera, and Fuentes\r\nd’Oñoro) so long as the enemy was hopelessly superior in his number\r\nof squadrons. It was only after 1811, when his cavalry regiments\r\nwere about doubled in numbers, that he could venture down into the\r\nplains, and deliver great battles in the open like Salamanca—the first\r\nengagement which he ever fought in the Peninsula where his cavalry was\r\nnot inferior by a third or even a half to that of the French.\r\n\r\nBeside the Pyrenean regions and Portugal, there are other districts\r\nof the Peninsula where the cavalry arm is handicapped by the\r\nterrain—Catalonia for example, where the inland is one mass of\r\nrugged valleys, the coastland of the kingdom of Granada, and the\r\ngreat ganglion of mountain lands where Aragon, Valencia, and New\r\nCastile meet. But as these were tracts where the British army was\r\nlittle engaged, I pass them over with a mention. But it must also be\r\nremembered that each of the great upland plateaux of Spain—Leon, New\r\nCastile, La Mancha, and Estremadura, is separated from the others by\r\nbroad mountain belts, where the Spanish guerillero bands made their\r\nheadquarters, and rendered communication between plain and plain\r\ndifficult and perilous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: French Cavalry Tactics]\r\n\r\nIn such a country of contrasts, how did the various combatants use\r\ntheir mounted men during the six long years between Vimeiro and\r\nToulouse? What was the relative value of the different national\r\ncavalry, and what were its tactics for battle and for the equally\r\nimportant work of exploration, and of the covering and concealing the\r\nmovements of the other arms?\r\n\r\nFrench cavalry tactics had, by 1808, when the war began, developed\r\ninto as definite a system as those of the infantry. Napoleon was fond\r\nof massing his horsemen in very large bodies, and launching them at\r\nthe centre no less than at the flank of the army opposed to him.\r\nIn the times of Marlborough and of Frederic the Great cavalry was\r\nalmost always drawn up in long lines on the wings, and used first for\r\nthe beating of the hostile containing cavalry, and then for turning\r\nagainst the unprotected flank of the enemy’s infantry in the centre.\r\nA cavalry dash at a weak point in the middle of the hostile front was\r\nvery rare indeed, and only tried by the very few generals of first\r\nrate intelligence, who had emancipated themselves from the old routine\r\nwhich prescribed the regular drawing up of an army. Marlborough’s\r\ncavalry charge at the French right-centre at Blenheim is almost the\r\nonly first-rate example of such a stroke in the old wars of the\r\neighteenth century. Frederic’s great cavalry charge at Rossbach, which\r\nis sometimes quoted as a parallel, was after all no more than a sudden\r\nrush of the Prussian flank-cavalry at the exposed wing of an army which\r\nwas unwisely trying to march around the position of its adversary. But\r\nNapoleon was the exponent of great frontal attacks of cavalry on chosen\r\nweak spots of the enemy’s line, which had already been well pounded\r\nby artillery or weakened in some other way. He would use 6000, 8000,\r\nor (as at Waterloo) even 12,000 men for one of these great strokes.\r\nAt Austerlitz and Borodino these charges were made straight at the\r\nenemy’s front: Marengo and Dresden were won by such rushes: Eylau was\r\nonly saved from falling into a disaster by a blow of the same kind.\r\nBut cavalry had to be used at precisely the right moment, to be most\r\nskilfully led, and to be pushed home without remorse and despite of all\r\nlosses, if it was to be successful. Even then it might be beaten off\r\nby thoroughly cool and unshaken infantry, as at Waterloo. It was only\r\nagainst exhausted, distracted, or untrained battalions that it could\r\ncount with a reasonable certainty of success.\r\n\r\nAll through the war the raw and badly-drilled Spanish armies supplied\r\nthe French squadrons with exactly this sort of opportunities. They were\r\nalways being surprised before they had been formed by their generals in\r\nline of battle, or caught in confusion while they were executing some\r\ncomplicated manœuvre. If attacked while they were in line or in column\r\nof march, they always fell victims to a cavalry charge, being from want\r\nof discipline extraordinarily slow to form square. As if this was not\r\nenough, they were often weak enough in morale to allow themselves to\r\nbe broken even when they had time to form their squares. The battles\r\nof Medellin, Ocaña, the Gebora, and Saguntum, were good examples of\r\nthe power of a comparatively small mass of cavalry skilfully handled,\r\nover a numerous but ill-disciplined infantry. But the little-mentioned\r\ncombat of Margalef in 1810 is perhaps the strongest example of the\r\nkind, for there six squadrons of Suchet’s cavalry (the 13th Cuirassiers\r\nsupported by two squadrons of the 3rd Hussars) actually rode down in\r\nsuccession, a whole division of some 4000 men, whom they caught while\r\nforming line of battle from column of march. This was done, too,\r\ndespite of the fact that the Spanish infantry was accompanied by three\r\nsquadrons of cavalry (who made the usual bolt at the commencement of\r\nthe action), as well as by a half-battery of artillery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Successes of the French Cavalry]\r\n\r\nIt was of course a very different matter when the French cavalry had\r\nto face the steady battalions of the British army. Looking down all\r\nthe record of battles and skirmishes from 1808 down to 1814, I can\r\nonly remember two occasions when the enemy’s cavalry really achieved\r\na notable tactical success. Oddly enough both fell within the month\r\nof May, 1811. At Albuera there occurred that complete disaster to\r\na British infantry brigade which has already been described in the\r\npreceding chapter. The other, and much smaller, success achieved by\r\nFrench cavalry over British infantry at Fuentes de Oñoro, a few days\r\nbefore the greater disaster at Albuera, has also been alluded to.[97]\r\nThese two disasters were wholly exceptional; usually the British\r\ninfantry held its own, unless it was absolutely taken by surprise, and\r\nthis even when attacked frontally by cavalry while it was deployed in\r\nthe two deep line, without forming square. If the British had their\r\nflanks covered, they were perfectly safe, and turned back any charge\r\nwith ease.\r\n\r\nIndeed the repulse of cavalry by British troops in line, who did not\r\ntake the trouble to form square because their flanks were covered, was\r\nnot infrequent in the Peninsular War. The classic instance is that of\r\nthe 5th Northumberland Fusiliers at El Bodon in 1811, who advanced in\r\nline firing against two French cavalry regiments and drove them off\r\nthe heights, being able to do so because they had a squadron or two of\r\nBritish horse to protect them from being turned. A very similar feat\r\nwas performed by the 52nd at Sabugal in 1811: and Harvey’s Portuguese\r\nbrigade did as much at Albuera.\r\n\r\nMuch more, of course, was the square impregnable. When once safely\r\nplaced in that formation, British troops habitually not only withstood\r\ncavalry charges at a stand-still, but made long movements over a\r\nbattlefield inundated by the hostile cavalry. At Fuentes de Oñoro the\r\nLight Division, three British and two Portuguese squares, retreated at\r\nleisure for _two miles_ while beset by four brigades of French cavalry,\r\nand reached the ground which they had been ordered to take up with a\r\ntotal loss of one killed and thirty-four wounded. Similarly at El Bodon\r\nthe square composed of the 5th and 77th retreated for six miles, in the\r\nface of two cavalry brigades which could never break into them.[98]\r\n\r\nIndeed it may be stated, as a rule almost without exception, that\r\ntroops in square, whether British or French, were never broken during\r\nthe Peninsular War even by very desperate and gallant charges. One of\r\nthe best instances of this general rule was the case of the combat of\r\nBarquilla, where two grenadier companies of the French 22nd, surprised\r\nwhile covering a foraging party by five squadrons of British cavalry,\r\ngot away in a level country after having been charged successively by\r\nthree squadrons of the 1st Hussars of the German Legion, the 16th and\r\nthe 14th Light Dragoons. One of these three squadron-charges, at least\r\n(that of the 14th), had been pushed home so handsomely that an officer\r\nand nine men fell actually among the French front rank, and a French\r\nobserver noted bayonets broken, and musket barrels deeply cut into by\r\nthe sweeping blows of the light dragoons, who yet failed entirely to\r\nbreak in.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cavalry Action against Squares]\r\n\r\nThere was indeed only one extraordinary case of properly formed squares\r\nbeing broken during the whole war, a case as exceptional in one way as\r\nthe disaster to Colborne’s brigade at Albuera was in the other. This\r\nwas at the combat of Garcia Hernandez, on the morning after the battle\r\nof Salamanca, where the heavy dragoons of the K.G.L. delivered what Foy\r\n(the French historian of the war) called the best charge that he had\r\never seen. The rear-guard of Marmont’s army had been formed of the one\r\ndivision which had not been seriously engaged in the battle, so that\r\nit could not be said to have been composed of shaken or demoralized\r\ntroops. Nevertheless, two of its squares were actually broken by\r\nthe legionary dragoons, though drawn up without haste or hurry on\r\na hillside favourable for defensive action. According to Beamish’s\r\n_History of the German Legion_, a work composed a few years later\r\nfrom the testimony of eye-witnesses, the first square was broken by a\r\nmortally wounded horse, carrying a dead rider, leaping right upon the\r\nkneeling front rank of the square, and bearing down half a dozen men\r\nby its struggles and kicking. An officer, Captain Gleichen, spurred\r\nhis horse into the gap thus created, his men followed, a wedge was\r\nthrust into the square, and it broke up, the large majority of the men\r\nsurrendering. The second square, belonging to the same regiment, the\r\n6th Léger, was a little higher up the hillside than the first: it was a\r\nwitness of the destruction of the sister-battalion, and seems to have\r\nbeen shaken by the sight: at any rate, when assailed a few minutes\r\nlater by another squadron of the German Dragoons, it gave a rather wild\r\nthough destructive volley, and wavered at the moment of receiving the\r\nattack, bulging in at the first charge. This was, of course, fatal. The\r\nbroken squares lost 1400 prisoners, beside some 200 killed and wounded.\r\nThe victorious dragoons paid a fairly high price for their success,\r\nlosing 4 officers and 50 men killed, and 2 officers, and 60 men wounded\r\nout of 700 present; the extraordinary proportion of killed to wounded,\r\n54 to 62 marking the deadly effect of musketry at the closest possible\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nThis (as I said before) was the exception that proved the rule: the\r\ninvulnerability of a steady square was such a commonplace, that Foy and\r\nthe other old officers of the Army of Spain, looked with dismay upon\r\nNapoleon’s great attempt at Waterloo to break down the long line of\r\nBritish squares between La Haye Sainte and Hougoumont, by the charges\r\nof some ten or twelve thousand cavalry massed on a short front of less\r\nthan a mile. The Emperor had not allowed for the superior resisting\r\npower of a thoroughly good infantry.\r\n\r\nOf fights between cavalry and cavalry, when the two sides were present\r\nin numbers so fairly equal as to make the struggle a fair test of their\r\nrelative efficiency, there were comparatively few in the Peninsular\r\nWar. In the early days of the war Wellington was too scantily provided\r\nwith horsemen, and could never afford to engage in a cavalry battle\r\non a large scale. He had only six regiments at Talavera in 1809, only\r\nseven in the Bussaco campaign of 1810. When he divided his army for the\r\nsimultaneous campaign in Beira and in Estremadura in March, 1811, he\r\ncould only give Beresford three regiments, and keep four for himself.\r\nNor could the deficiency be supplied (as was done in the artillery arm)\r\nby using Portuguese auxiliaries. The cavalry of that nation was so weak\r\nand so badly mounted that it is doubtful whether there were ever so\r\nmany as 2000 of them in the field at once. Many of the twelve regiments\r\nwere never mounted, and did garrison duty as infantry throughout the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington and his Cavalry]\r\n\r\nIt was not till the summer and autumn of 1811 that Wellington at last\r\nbegan to get large reinforcements of the mounted arm from England,\r\nwhich more than doubled his strength, for in the campaign of 1812 he\r\nhad no less than fifteen regiments instead of seven. In the winter of\r\n1812–13 further reinforcements came out, and in the Vittoria campaign\r\nhe had at last a powerful cavalry equal or superior to that of the\r\nFrench.[99]\r\n\r\nYet even allowing for the weakness of Wellington’s mounted strength\r\nin his earlier campaigns, we must acknowledge that they played a\r\ncomparatively small part in his scheme of operations. Though his\r\ndragoons did good service in keeping his front covered, and performed\r\nmany gallant exploits (we need only mention Talavera and Fuentes de\r\nOñoro to instance good self-sacrificing work done), they were seldom\r\nused as part of the main striking force that won a victory. Indeed,\r\nthe charge of Le Marchant’s heavy brigade at Salamanca is about the\r\nonly instance that can be cited of really decisive action by cavalry\r\nin any of the Duke’s battles. There were other notable successes to\r\nbe remembered, but they were in side issues, and often not under\r\nthe chief’s own eye—as, for example, Bock’s breaking of the squares\r\nat Garcia Hernandez on the day after Salamanca, and Lumley’s very\r\ncreditable victory over Latour-Maubourg at Usagre on May 25, 1811.\r\n\r\nEven when Wellington had at last a large cavalry force in 1812–14, it\r\nwas seldom found massed, and I believe that more than three brigades\r\nwere never found acting together. Such a force as six regiments was\r\nseldom seen in line and engaged. For the use of cavalry as a screen\r\nwe may mention the combat of Venta del Pozo, during the retreat from\r\nBurgos in 1812. This was a skirmish fought by two brigades to cover the\r\nwithdrawal of the infantry, which had to hurry hard on the way toward\r\nSalamanca and safety.\r\n\r\nSomething, no doubt, must be allowed for the fact that Wellington\r\nnever, till the Waterloo campaign, had an officer of proved ability in\r\nchief command of his cavalry. Stapleton Cotton, who served so long\r\nin that capacity, was not a man of mark. Lumley, who had a short but\r\ndistinguished career as a divisional commander, went home sick in 1811,\r\nand Le Marchant, who came out from home with a high reputation, was\r\nmost unfortunately killed in his first battle, Salamanca, where his\r\nbrigade did so much to settle the fortunes of the day. But allowing for\r\nall this, it remains clear that Wellington made comparatively little\r\nuse of the cavalry arm—which could hardly have been expected when we\r\nremember how effectively he had used his horse at Assaye, quite early\r\nin his career. Possibly the fact that he was so hopelessly outmatched\r\nin this arm in 1809–11 sunk so much into his soul, that when he got\r\nhis chance, later on, he was not ready to use it. Certainly several\r\ncases can be cited where it was not duly used to press a completed\r\nvictory—most particularly after Vittoria and Orthez. There is no\r\nconcealing the fact that Wellington’s reluctance to use great cavalry\r\nattacks was, at bottom, due to his doubts as to the tactical skill of\r\nhis senior officers, and the power of his regiments to manœuvre. He\r\ndivulged his views on the subject, twelve years after the war was over,\r\nin a letter to Lord John Russell, dated July 31, 1826. “I considered\r\nour cavalry,” he wrote, “so inferior to the French from want of order,\r\nthat although I considered one of our squadrons a match for two French,\r\nyet I did not care to see four British opposed to four French, and\r\nstill more so as the numbers increased, and order (of course) became\r\nmore necessary. They could gallop, but could not preserve their order.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some Reckless Cavalry Charges]\r\n\r\nThis seems a very hard judgment, when we examine in detail the cavalry\r\nannals of the Peninsular War. There were cases, no doubt, where English\r\nregiments threw away their chances by their blind fury in charging, and\r\neither got cut up from pursuing an original advantage to a reckless\r\nlength, or at any rate missed an opportunity by over-great dispersion\r\nor riding off the field. The earliest case was seen at Vimeiro just\r\nafter Wellington’s first landing in the Peninsula, when two squadrons\r\nof the 20th Light Dragoons, after successfully cutting up a beaten\r\ncolumn of infantry, pushed on for half a mile in great disorder, to\r\ncharge Junot’s cavalry reserves, and were horribly maltreated—losing\r\nabout one man in four. An equally irrational exploit took place at\r\nTalavera, where the 23rd Light Dragoons, beaten off in a charge against\r\na square which they had been ordered to attack, rushed on beyond it,\r\nagainst three successive lines of French cavalry, pierced the first,\r\nwere stopped by the second, and had to cut their way back with a loss\r\nof 105 prisoners and 102 killed and wounded—nearly half their strength.\r\nAn equally headlong business was the charge of the 13th Light Dragoons\r\nat Campo Mayor on March 25, 1811, when that regiment, having beaten in\r\nfair fight the French 26th Dragoons, and captured eighteen siege-guns\r\nwhich were retreating on the road, galloped on for more than six miles,\r\nsabring the scattered fugitives, till they were actually brought up\r\nby the fire of the fortress of Badajoz, on to whose very glacis they\r\nhad made their way. The captured guns, meanwhile, were picked up by\r\nthe French infantry who had been retreating along the high-road behind\r\ntheir routed cavalry, and brought off in safety—the 13th not having\r\nleft a single man to secure them. Here, at any rate, not much loss was\r\nsuffered, though a great capture was missed, but similar galloping\r\ntactics on June 11, 1812, at the combat of Maguilla, led to a complete\r\ndisaster. Slade’s heavy brigade (1st Royals and 3rd Dragoon Guards)\r\nfell in with L’Allemand’s French brigade, the 17th and 27th Dragoons.\r\nEach drew up, but L’Allemand had placed one squadron in reserve far\r\nbeyond the sky line, and out of sight. Slade charged, beat the five\r\nsquadrons immediately opposed to him, and then (without reforming or\r\nsetting aside any supports) galloped after the broken French brigade in\r\ncomplete disorder for a mile, till he came parallel to the unperceived\r\nreserve squadron, which charged him in flank and rear: the rest of\r\nthe French halted and turned; Slade could not stand, and was routed,\r\nhaving 40 casualties and 118 prisoners. Wellington wrote about this\r\nto Hill: “I have never been more annoyed than by Slade’s affair. Our\r\nofficers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything.\r\nThey never consider the situation, never think of manœuvring before\r\nan enemy, and never keep back or provide for a reserve. All cavalry\r\nshould charge in two lines, and at least one-third should be ordered\r\nbeforehand to pull up and reform, as soon as the charge has been\r\ndelivered, and the enemy been broken.”[100]\r\n\r\nIn the first three of the cases mentioned above, the discredit of\r\nthe rash and inconsiderate pressing on of the charge falls on the\r\nregimental officers—in the last on the brigadier, Slade. It must be\r\nconfessed that Wellington was not very happy in his senior cavalry\r\nofficers—Erskine, Long, and Slade have all some bad marks against\r\nthem—especially the last-named, whose proceedings seem nearly to have\r\nbroken the heart of the lively and intelligent diarist Tomkinson, of\r\nthe 16th Light Dragoons, who had the misfortune to serve long under\r\nhim. Stapleton Cotton, the commander of the whole cavalry, was but a\r\nmediocrity; every one will remember his old chief’s uncomplimentary\r\nremarks about him _àpropos_ of the siege of Bhurtpore. The man who\r\nought to have been in charge of the British horse during the whole war\r\nwas Lord Paget, who had handled Sir John Moore’s five cavalry regiments\r\nwith such admirable skill and daring during the Corunna campaign: his\r\ntwo little fights of Sahagun and Benevente were models in their way.\r\nBut he was unhappily never employed again till Waterloo—where his\r\ndoings, under his new name of Lord Uxbridge, are sufficiently well\r\nknown. But a question of seniority, and an unhappy family quarrel with\r\nthe Wellesleys (having absconded with the wife of Wellington’s brother\r\nHenry, he fought a duel with her brother in consequence) prevented him\r\nfrom seeing service under the Duke in the eventful years 1809–14. Of\r\nthe cavalry generals who took part in the great campaigns, after Paget\r\nthe most successful was Lumley, who has two very fine achievements to\r\nhis credit—the containing of Soult’s superior cavalry during the crisis\r\nof the battle of Albuera, and the combat of Usagre, of May 25, 1811,\r\nnoted above. This was considered such an admirable piece of work by the\r\nenemy, that it is related at great length in Picard’s _Histoire de la\r\nCavalerie_, alone among all British successes of the Peninsular War.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lumley’s Victory at Usagre]\r\n\r\nIt needs a word of notice, as it is hardly mentioned in the Wellington\r\ndispatches, and very briefly by Napier. Latour-Maubourg had been\r\nsent by Soult to push back Beresford’s advanced posts, and discover\r\nhis position. He had a very large force—two brigades of dragoons and\r\nfour regiments of light cavalry, in all 3500 sabres. Lumley, who was\r\nscreening Beresford’s movements, had only three British regiments (3rd\r\nDragoon Guards, 4th Dragoons, 13th Light Dragoons), 980 sabres, and\r\nMadden’s and Otway’s Portuguese brigades, 1000 sabres, with 300 of\r\nPenne Villemur’s Spanish horse. Wishing to contain the French advance\r\nas long as possible, he took up a position behind the bridge and\r\nvillage of Usagre, a defile through which the French must pass in order\r\nto reach him. Latour-Maubourg, relying on the immense superiority of\r\nnumbers which he possessed, was reckless in his tactics. After sending\r\noff a brigade of light horse to turn Lumley’s position, by a very long\r\ndetour and distant fords, he pushed his other three brigades into\r\nthe village, with orders to cross the bridge and press the enemy in\r\nfront. Lumley was showing nothing but a line of Portuguese vedettes,\r\nhaving withdrawn his squadrons behind the sky line. He was apprised\r\nof the turning movement, but, knowing the ground better than the\r\nFrench, was aware that it would take a very much longer time than the\r\nenemy expected, so resolved to hold his position to the last moment.\r\nHe allowed the two leading regiments of Bron’s dragoons to pass the\r\nbridge and form on the nearer side, and then, while the third regiment\r\nwas crossing the river, and the second brigade was entering the long\r\nvillage, charged suddenly in upon the first brigade, with six English\r\nsquadrons in front and six Portuguese squadrons on the right flank.\r\nThe two deployed French regiments were thrown back on the third, which\r\nwas jammed on the bridge. Hence they could not get away to reform and\r\nrally, the road behind them being entirely blocked, while the second\r\nbrigade in the village could not get to the front to give assistance.\r\nAll that Latour-Maubourg could do was to dismount its leading regiment\r\nand occupy with it the houses on each side of the bridge, from which\r\nthey kept back the victorious British by their carbine fire. Lumley,\r\nmeanwhile, dealt with the three routed regiments at his leisure,\r\nkilling or wounding 250 men and capturing 80 prisoners before the\r\ndisordered wrecks succeeded in re-crossing the river. Latour-Maubourg,\r\nwarned by this bloody check, showed for the future no anxiety to press\r\nin upon Beresford’s cavalry screen.\r\n\r\nHow _not_ to deal with an exactly similar situation, it may be\r\nremarked, was shown on the 23rd October of the following year, 1812,\r\nby two British brigadiers, who, charged with the covering of the\r\nretreat of Wellington’s army from Burgos, were holding a position\r\nbehind the bridge of Venta del Pozo or Villadrigo, when the part\r\nof the French cavalry immediately opposed to them, the brigade of\r\nFaverot, ten squadrons strong, came down to the defile. Faverot, like\r\nLatour-Maubourg at Usagre, took the hazardous step of ordering his\r\nleading regiment to pass the bridge at a trot, and form on the other\r\nside. This Bock, the senior British brigadier, allowed it to do, and\r\nwas right in so doing, for the proper moment to strike was when the\r\nenemy should have half or three-quarters of his men across the bridge,\r\nand the rest jammed upon it. But Bock allowed the psychological moment\r\nto pass, and did not charge till the French brigade had almost entirely\r\ncrossed, and could put very nearly equal numbers in line against him.\r\nThen, moving too late, with some squadrons of Anson’s brigade in\r\nsupport, he came to a desperate standing fight with the enemy, in\r\nwhich both suffered very heavily. But when all the British and German\r\nLegion regiments were already engaged, the rearmost squadrons of the\r\nFrench, which had crossed the bridge under cover of the fighting\r\nline, fell upon Bock from the flank, and turned one of his wings; the\r\nBritish cavalry had to give way and retreat, till it was covered by the\r\ninfantry of the 7th Division. If Bock had charged five minutes earlier,\r\nhe would have nipped the French column in the middle, and probably have\r\ndestroyed the leading regiments. The French brigade, as it was, lost 18\r\nofficers and 116 men, Anson and Bock about 200, among whom were four\r\nofficers and 70 men prisoners.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Surprise of Arroyo Dos Molinos]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I am inclined to think that Wellington was a little\r\nhard on his cavalry. There was, of course, considerable justification\r\nfor his criticisms. There was a want of decision and intelligence\r\namong some of his brigadiers, and a tendency to headlong and reckless\r\ncharging straight ahead among many of his regimental officers. But\r\nlooking dispassionately at the cavalry work on both sides, it is\r\nimpossible to say that the French marshals were any better served.\r\nThere is no striking instance in the annals of the British campaigns\r\nof 1809–14 of the army, or even a division, being surprised for want\r\nof vigilance on the part of its cavalry screen, while several such can\r\nbe quoted on the French side—especially Ney’s surprise at Foz d’Arouce\r\non March 15, 1811—caused by his light cavalry under Lamotte having\r\ncompletely failed to watch the roads, or the better-known rout of\r\nGirard at Arroyo dos Molinos later in the same year. On that occasion\r\nan infantry division, accompanied by no less than two brigades of light\r\ncavalry, was attacked at dawn and dispersed with heavy loss, owing to\r\nthe fact that the cavalry brigadiers, Bron and Briche, had taken no\r\nprecautions whatever to feel for the enemy. They, like the infantry,\r\nwere completely surprised, being caught with the horses unsaddled,\r\nand the men dispersed among houses; hence the chasseurs were taken\r\nprisoners in large numbers by Hill’s sudden rush, one of the brigadiers\r\nand a cavalry colonel being among the 2000 unwounded prisoners\r\ntaken. There is no such large-scale surprise as this among all the\r\nrecords of the British cavalry. The worst that I know were those of\r\na squadron of the 13th Light Dragoons on April 6, 1811, near Elvas,\r\nand a very similar one of the 11th Light Dragoons two months later,\r\nnot far from the same place. In the last case the disaster is said to\r\nhave happened because the regiment had only just landed from England\r\nafter long home-service, and the captain in command lost his head from\r\nsheer inexperience. With regard to this I may quote the following\r\npregnant sentence, from the _Diary_ of Tomkinson, who wrote far the\r\nbest detailed account of the life of a cavalry regiment during those\r\neventful years. “To attempt giving men or officers any idea in England\r\nof outpost duty was considered absurd, and when they came abroad they\r\nhad all to learn. The fact was that there was no one to teach them.\r\nSir Stapleton Cotton (who afterwards commanded the cavalry in Spain)\r\nonce tried an experiment with the 14th and 16th Light Dragoons near\r\nWoodbridge in Suffolk. In the end he got the supposed enemy’s vedettes\r\nand his own all facing the same way. In England I never saw nor heard\r\nof cavalry taught to charge, disperse, and reform, which of all things,\r\nbefore an enemy, is most essential. Inclining in line right or left\r\nis very useful, and that was scarcely ever practised.” He adds in\r\n1819: “On return to English duty, after the peace, we all continued\r\nthe old system, each regiment estimating its merit by mere celerity of\r\nmovement. Not one idea suggested by our war experience was remembered,\r\nand after five years we shall have to commence all over again, if we\r\nare sent abroad.”\r\n\r\nIn short, the proper work of cavalry, apart from mere charging, had to\r\nbe learnt on Spanish soil when any regiment landed. But it was in the\r\nend picked up by the better corps, and on the whole the outpost and\r\nreconnaissance work of the Peninsular Army seem to have been well done,\r\nthough some regiments had a better reputation than others. Much of the\r\nwork of this kind speaks for itself. The most admirable achievement\r\nduring the war was undoubtedly that of the 1st Hussars of the K.G.L.,\r\nwho, assisted afterwards by the 14th and 16th Light Dragoons, kept for\r\nfour months (March to May, 1810) the line of the Agueda and Azava, 40\r\nmiles long, against a fourfold strength of French cavalry, without\r\nonce letting a hostile reconnaissance through, losing a picket or even\r\na vedette, or sending a piece of false information back to General\r\nCraufurd, whose front they were covering.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington’s Cavalry Tactics]\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made in the opening words of this chapter to\r\nWellington’s memorandum for the tactical management of cavalry. It was\r\nonly issued after Waterloo, in the form of “Instructions to Officers\r\ncommanding Brigades of Cavalry in the Army of Occupation,” but, no\r\ndoubt, represents the tactics which he had evolved from his Peninsular\r\nexperience.[101] Too long to give in entirety, it is worth analysing.\r\nThe heads run as follows:—\r\n\r\n(1) A reserve must always be kept, to improve a success, or to cover\r\nan unsuccessful charge. This reserve should not be less than half the\r\ntotal number of sabres, and may occasionally be as much as two-thirds\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n(2) Normally a cavalry force should form in three lines: the first and\r\nsecond lines should be deployed, the reserve may be in column, but so\r\nformed as to be easily changed into line.\r\n\r\n(3) The second line should be 400 or 500 yards from the first, the\r\nreserve a similar distance from the second line, if cavalry is about to\r\nact against cavalry. This is found not too great a distance to prevent\r\nthe rear lines from improving an advantage gained by the front line,\r\nnor too little to prevent a defeated front line from passing between\r\nthe intervals of its supports without disordering them.\r\n\r\n(4) When, however, cavalry is charging infantry, the second line should\r\nbe only 200 yards behind the first, the object being that it should be\r\nable to deliver its charge without delay, against a battalion which\r\nhas spent its fire against the first line, and will not be prepared for\r\na second charge pushed in rapid succession to the first.\r\n\r\n(5) When the first line delivers its attack at a gallop, the supports\r\nmust follow at a walk only, lest they be carried forward by the rush,\r\nand get mingled with the line in front at the onset. For order in the\r\nsupports must be rigidly kept—they are useless if they have got into\r\nconfusion, when they are wanted to sustain and cover a checked first\r\nline.\r\n\r\nA note as to horses may finish our observations on the cavalry side\r\nof Wellington’s tactics. In countless places, in diaries no less than\r\ndispatches, we find the complaint that the trooper of 1810 was, when\r\nnot well looked after by his officers, a bad horse-master—careless as\r\nto feeding his mount, and still more so as to saddle-galls and such\r\nlike. It is often remarked that the one German light cavalry regiment\r\nin the original Peninsular Army, the 1st Hussars of the King’s German\r\nLegion, set an example which some other regiments might have copied\r\nwith advantage, being far more conscientious and considerate to their\r\nbeasts. It is interesting to find that the French cavalry reports have\r\nexactly the same complaints, and the number of dismounted men shown\r\nin French regimental states as a consequence of sick horses was as\r\ngreat as our own. Several times I have found the report that when a\r\nconsiderable number of French cavalry had been captured, quite a small\r\nproportion of their horses could be turned over to serve as remounts\r\nfor their captors, because of the abominable condition in which they\r\nwere found. The fact was that the climate and the food seem to have\r\nbeen equally deleterious to the English and French horses: a diet of\r\nchopped straw and green maize—often all that could be got—was deadly\r\nto horses accustomed to stable diet in England or France. Wellington\r\nsometimes actually imported hay and oats from England; but they\r\ncould not be got far up country, and only served for regiments that\r\nchanced to be put into winter quarters near the sea. Practically\r\nall the remounts came from England—the Portuguese and Spanish horses\r\nhaving been tried and found wanting many times. In 1808 the 20th\r\nLight Dragoons were embarked without horses, being ordered to mount\r\nthemselves in Portugal; but the experiment failed wholly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington’s Artillery Tactics]\r\n\r\nOnly a short note is required as to Wellington’s use of artillery. In\r\nhis early years of command he was almost as weak in this arm as in\r\ncavalry. There was not one British battery per division available in\r\n1809. But the Portuguese artillery being numerous, and ere long very\r\nefficient, was largely used to supplement the British after 1810. Yet\r\neven when it had become proportioned to the number of his whole army,\r\nthe Duke did not use it in the style of Bonaparte. He never worked\r\nwith enormous masses of guns manœuvring in front line, and supporting\r\nan attack, such as the Emperor used. Only at Bussaco, Vittoria, and\r\nWaterloo do we find anything like a concentration of many batteries\r\nto play an important part in the line of battle. Usually the Duke\r\npreferred to work with small units—individual batteries—placed in\r\nwell-chosen spots, and often kept concealed till the critical moment.\r\nThey were dotted along the front of the position rather than massed,\r\nand in most cases must be regarded as valuable support for the infantry\r\nthat was to win the battle, rather than as an arm intended to work for\r\nits independent aims and to take a special part in war. Of several of\r\nNapoleon’s victories we may say that they were artilleryman’s battles;\r\nnothing of the kind can be predicated of any of Wellington’s triumphs,\r\nthough the guns were always well placed, and most usefully employed, as\r\nwitness Bussaco, Fuentes de Oñoro, and Waterloo.\r\n\r\nAs to Wellington’s use of siege artillery, we must speak in a later\r\nchapter.[102] It was, through no fault of his own, the weakest point\r\nin his army: indeed till 1811 he never had a British battering-train,\r\nand in the early sieges of Badajoz he worked _in forma pauperis_, with\r\nimprovised material, mainly Portuguese, and very deficient in quality.\r\nThe record is not a cheerful one; but it must be said that the home\r\nauthorities, and not Wellington, were the responsible parties for any\r\nchecks that were suffered. A great general who is not an artillery\r\nor engineering specialist must trust to his scientific officers, and\r\ncertainly cannot be made responsible for shortage of men and material\r\ndue to the parsimony of his masters at home.\r\n\r\nSo much for the great Duke’s tactics. We shall presently be\r\ninvestigating his system of military organization—the inner machinery\r\nof his army. But before dealing with it, we shall have to spare some\r\nattention for his greater lieutenants, whose individualities had an\r\nimportant share in the management of his army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON’S LIEUTENANTS—HILL, BERESFORD, GRAHAM\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no stronger contrast than that between the impression\r\nwhich the Iron Duke left on his old followers, and that produced by his\r\ntrusted and most responsible lieutenant, Sir Rowland Hill. Hill was\r\nblessed and kindly remembered wherever he went. He was a man brimming\r\nover with the milk of human kindness, and the mention of him in any\r\ndiary is generally accompanied by some anecdote of an act of thoughtful\r\nconsideration, some friendly word, or piece of unpremeditated, often\r\nhomely charity. A wounded officer from Albuera, who is dragging himself\r\npainfully back to Lisbon, reports himself to Hill as he passes his\r\nheadquarters. Next morning “the general himself attended me out on my\r\nroad, to give me at parting a basket with tea, sugar, bread, butter,\r\nand a large venison pasty.”[103] A grateful sergeant, who bore a letter\r\nto Hill in 1813, remembers how he expected nothing but a nod and an\r\nanswer from such a great man, and was surprised to find that the\r\ngeneral ordered his servant to give the messenger a supper, arranged\r\nfor his billet that night, and next morn had his haversack stuffed with\r\nbread and meat, presented him with a dollar, and advised him where to\r\nsleep on his return journey.[104] He would give an exhausted private a\r\ndrink from the can that had just been brought for his personal use, or\r\nfind time to bestow a piece of friendly advice on an unknown subaltern.\r\nThis simple, pious, considerate old officer, whose later portraits\r\nshow a decided resemblance to Mr. Pickwick, was known everywhere among\r\nthe rank and file as “Daddy Hill.” An officer of the 2nd Division\r\nsums up his character in a well-written letter as follows[105]: “The\r\nfoundation of all his popularity with the troops was his sterling worth\r\nand heroic spirit, but his popularity was strengthened and increased as\r\nsoon as he was personally known. He was the very picture of an English\r\ncountry gentleman: to the soldiers who came from the rural districts\r\nof old England he represented _home_; his fresh complexion, placid\r\nface, kind eyes, kind voice, the absence of all parade or noise in his\r\nmanner delighted them. The displeasure of Sir Rowland was worse to them\r\nthan the loudest anger of other generals. His attention to all their\r\nwants and comforts, his visits to the sick in hospital, his vigilant\r\nprotection of the poor peasantry, his just severity to marauders, his\r\ngenerous treatment of such French prisoners and wounded as fell into\r\nhis hands, made for him a warm place in the hearts of his soldiery; and\r\nwhere’er the survivors of that army are now scattered, assuredly Hill’s\r\nname and image are dearly cherished still.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Merits of Sir Rowland Hill]\r\n\r\nThe description sounds like that of a benevolent old squire, rather\r\nthan that of a distinguished lieutenant-general. Nevertheless, Rowland\r\nHill was a very great man of war. Wellington liked him as a subordinate\r\nbecause of his extraordinary punctuality in obedience, and the entire\r\nabsence in him of that restless personal ambition which makes many able\r\nmen think more of opportunities for distinguishing themselves than of\r\nexact performance of the orders given them. Wherever Hill was, it was\r\ncertain that nothing would be risked, and nothing would be forgotten.\r\nHis beautiful combination of intelligence and executive power more\r\nthan once brought relief to his chief’s mind in a critical moment,\r\nmost of all on the march to Bussaco in September, 1810, when it was\r\nall-important to Wellington’s plans that his own detached force under\r\nHill should join him as soon as Masséna’s similar detached force under\r\nReynier should have reached the main French army. Hill executed a long\r\nand difficult march over a mountainous country with admirable speed,\r\nand was duly up in line on the day before the battle of Bussaco, which\r\ncould not in common prudence have been fought if he had been late.\r\n\r\nThis we might have expected from a man of Hill’s character; but what\r\nis more surprising is that when he was trusted—a thing that did not\r\noften occur under Wellington’s _régime_—with a command in which he was\r\nallowed to take the offensive on his own account, he displayed not\r\nonly a power of organizing, but a fierce driving energy which none of\r\nWellington’s more eager and restless subordinates could have surpassed.\r\nSpeedy pursuit of an enemy on the move was not one of the great Duke’s\r\ncharacteristics; he was often, and not unjustly, accused of not making\r\nthe best profit out of his victories. But Hill’s rapid following up\r\nof Girard, in November, 1811, ending with the complete surprise and\r\ndispersion or capture of the French force at Arroyo dos Molinos, was\r\na piece of work which for swift, continuous movement, over mountain\r\nroads, in vile rainy weather, could not have been surpassed by the\r\nbest of Napoleon’s lieutenants. Another blow of the most creditable\r\nswiftness and daring was the storming of the forts of Almaraz five\r\nmonths later, when Hill, with a light force, plunged right into the\r\nmiddle of the French cantonments and broke the all-important bridge\r\nby which Soult and Marmont were wont to co-operate. The forts were\r\nstormed, the bridge thoroughly destroyed, and Hill was off, and out of\r\nreach, before the neighbouring French divisions were half concentrated.\r\n\r\nBut the crowning glory of Hill’s Peninsular service was the one general\r\naction in which he was fortunate enough to hold independent command.\r\nThis was at the end of the war, the battle of St. Pierre, near\r\nBayonne. He was forming the right flank of Wellington’s line when his\r\ncommunication with the main army was cut off by a rise in the river\r\nNive, which carried away the bridges by which he communicated with\r\nthe main host. Soult, transferring the bulk of his field force, then\r\nin front of Wellington, by means of the bridges in Bayonne town, fell\r\nupon Hill with five divisions. Hill had only two, those which he had\r\ncommanded for the last three years, the 2nd and Hamilton’s (now Le\r\nCor’s) Portuguese. With 15,000 men he fought a defensive battle against\r\n30,000 for the greater part of the short December day. His reserves\r\nwere used up, every regiment had charged many times, the losses were\r\nheavy, and it seemed hardly possible to hold on against such odds. But\r\nHill did so, and at last the reinforcements from the other side of the\r\nriver Nive began to appear in the late afternoon, and Soult desisted\r\nfrom his attack and drew off beaten. This was one of the most desperate\r\npieces of fighting in the Peninsular War, and Hill was the soul of the\r\ndefence. He was seen at every point of danger, and repeatedly led up\r\nrallied regiments in person to save what seemed like a lost battle.\r\nEye-witnesses speak of him as quite transformed from his ordinary\r\nplacidity—a very picture of warlike energy. He was even heard to swear,\r\na thing so rare that we are assured that this lapse from his accustomed\r\nhabits only took place twice during the whole war. The first occasion\r\nwas in the desperate melée in the night attack that began the battle of\r\nTalavera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE II._\r\n\r\nLORD HILL, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear that Hill was a man capable of the highest feats in war,\r\nwho might have gone very far, if he had been given the chance of a\r\ncompletely independent command. But such was not his fortune, and in\r\nhis last campaign, that of Waterloo, he was almost lost to sight,\r\nas a corps-commander whose troops were operating always under the\r\nimmediate eye of Wellington. He survived to a good old age, was made\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the British Army when Wellington gave up the\r\noffice on accepting the Premiership in 1827, and held it till within\r\na few months of his death in 1842. Almost the last recorded words of\r\nthe kindly old man upon his death-bed were, “I have a great deal to be\r\nthankful for; I believe I have not an enemy in the world.” And this was\r\nliterally true: to know “Daddy Hill” was to love him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Beresford]\r\n\r\nThe other lieutenant to whom Wellington repeatedly entrusted a\r\nsemi-independent command was one who was neither so blameless nor so\r\ncapable as Rowland Hill. Yet William Carr Beresford was by no means to\r\nbe despised as a soldier. The illegitimate son of a great Irish peer,\r\nhe was put into a marching regiment at seventeen, and saw an immense\r\namount of service even for those stirring days of the Revolutionary\r\nWar, when a British officer was liable to be sent to any of the four\r\ncontinents in rapid succession. This was literally the case with\r\nBeresford, who was engaged in India, Egypt, the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nBuenos Ayres, and Portugal in the eight years between 1800 and 1808.\r\n\r\nWhen the Portuguese Government asked for a British general to\r\nreorganize their dilapidated army in 1809, Beresford was the man\r\nselected—partly because he had the reputation of being a good\r\ndisciplinarian, partly because he knew the Portuguese tongue, from\r\nhaving garrisoned Madeira for many months, but mostly (as we are told)\r\nbecause of political influence. His father’s family had never lost\r\nsight of him, and he was well “pushed” by the Beresford clan, who were\r\na great power in Ireland, and had to be conciliated by all Governments.\r\n\r\nIf this appointment to command the Portuguese Army was a job, we may\r\nsay (with Gilbert’s judge) that so far as organization went, it was “a\r\ngood job too.” For he did most eminent service in creating order out\r\nof chaos, and produced in the short space of a year a well-disciplined\r\nforce that was capable of taking a creditable part in line with the\r\nBritish Army, and won well-deserved encomiums from Wellington and every\r\nother fair critic for the part that it took at Bussaco, its first\r\nengagement. The new army had not been created without much friction\r\nand discontent: to clear out scores of incapable officers—many of them\r\n_fidalgos_ with great court influence—to promote young and unknown men\r\nto their places, to enforce the rigour of the conscription in a land\r\nwhere it existed in theory but had always been evaded in practice,\r\ngained Beresford immense unpopularity, which he faced in the most\r\nstolid and unbending fashion. At last the Portuguese Army was up to\r\nstrength, and had learnt to obey as well as to fight. The teaching\r\nhad been by the most drastic methods: Beresford cashiered officers,\r\nand shot deserters or marauders in the rank and file, with a rigid\r\ndisregard alike for personal and court influence, and for public\r\nopinion, which Wellington himself could not have surpassed. He was,\r\nindeed, an honest, inflexible, and hard-working administrator; but\r\nwith this and with a personal courage that ran almost to excess his\r\ncapacities ended. His virtue in Wellington’s eyes was that, after one\r\nshort tussle of wills, he completely and very wisely submitted himself\r\nto be the mere instrument of his greater colleague, and did everything\r\nthat he was told to do, working the Portuguese army to the best effect\r\nas an auxiliary force to the British, and making no attempt to assert\r\nan independent authority. Instead of being kept under his hand in a\r\nbody, it was cut up into brigades, each of which, with few exceptions,\r\nwas simply attached to a British division.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beresford’s Limitations]\r\n\r\nIt was no doubt because Beresford showed himself so obedient and loyal,\r\nand exhibited such complete self-abnegation, that Wellington, both\r\nin 1809 and 1811, entrusted him with the command of large detached\r\nforces at a distance from the main army. But the marshal was by no\r\nmeans up to the task entrusted to him, and after the unhappy experiment\r\nof the first siege of Badajoz, and the ill-fought battle of Albuera,\r\nWellington removed him from separate command, on the excuse that more\r\norganizing was needed at Lisbon, and kept him either there, or with the\r\nmain army (where he had no opportunities of separate command) till the\r\nlast year of the war. In 1814 he was for a few weeks entrusted with the\r\nconduct of the expedition to Bordeaux, but as it was unopposed by the\r\nenemy—and was bound to be so, as Wellington well knew—this was giving\r\nhim no great responsibility. During the three last years of the war\r\nhe was really in a rather otiose and equivocal position, as titular\r\nCommander-in-Chief of an army which was not treated as a unit, but\r\ndispersed abroad among the British divisions. Occasionally he was used\r\nas a corps commander under Wellington’s own eye, as at Toulouse, where\r\nhe led the turning column of the 4th and 6th Divisions which broke\r\ndown Soult’s flank defences. For such a task, when hard fighting and\r\nobedience to orders was all that was needed, he was a fully competent\r\nlieutenant. It was when thrown on his own resources and forced to make\r\ndecisions of his own that he showed himself so much inferior to his\r\nsuccessor Hill.\r\n\r\nBeresford was a very tall and stalwart man of herculean strength—every\r\none knows of his personal encounter with a Polish lancer at Albuera:\r\nhe parried the Pole’s thrust, caught him by the collar, and jerked him\r\nout of his saddle and under his horse’s feet, with one twist of his\r\npowerful arm. His features were singularly rough-cast and irregular,\r\nand a sinister appearance was given to his face by a discoloured and\r\nuseless left eye, which had been injured in a shooting accident when\r\nhe was quite a young man. The glare of this injured optic is said to\r\nhave been discomposing to culprits whom he had to upbraid and admonish,\r\na task which he always executed with thoroughness. He had been forced\r\nto trample on so many misdemeanants, small and great, during his\r\nfive years in command of the Portuguese army, that he enjoyed a very\r\ngeneral unpopularity. But I have never found any case in which he can\r\nbe accused of injustice or oppression; the fact was that he had a\r\ngreat many unsatisfactory subordinates to deal with. His own staff and\r\nthe better officers of the Portuguese service liked him well enough,\r\nand the value of his work cannot be too highly praised. He came\r\nlittle into contact with the British part of the army, but I note that\r\nthe 88th, whom he had commanded before the war in Spain began, much\r\npreferred him to their later chief, Picton, and had a kindly memory\r\nof him. There are singularly few tales or anecdotes connected with\r\nhis name, from which I deduce that in British military circles he was\r\nneither much loved nor much hated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early Career of Graham]\r\n\r\nA far more picturesque figure is the third of the three generals to\r\nwhom, at one time or another, Wellington committed the charge of a\r\ndetached corps, Thomas Graham of Balgowan, later created Lord Lynedoch.\r\nI have already alluded to him in my preface, as in one way the most\r\ntypical figure of the epoch—the personification of all that class of\r\nBritons who took arms against France when the Revolutionary War broke\r\nout, as a plain duty incumbent upon them in days when the country and\r\nCrown were in danger. He had seen the Jacobin mob face to face in its\r\nfrenzy, in a sufficiently horrid fashion. In 1792 he had taken his\r\ninvalid wife—the beautiful Mrs. Graham of Gainsborough’s well-known\r\npicture—to the Riviera, in the vain hope that her consumption might be\r\nstayed. She died, nevertheless, and he started home towards Scotland\r\nwith her coffin, to lay her in the grave of his ancestors. On the way\r\nhe passed through a town where the crazy hunt after impossible royalist\r\nconspiracies was in full swing. A crowd of drunken National Guards were\r\nseized with the idea that he was an emissary in disguise, bearing arms\r\nto aristocrats. The coffin, they declared, was probably full of pistols\r\nand daggers, and while the unhappy husband struggled in vain to hold\r\nthem off, they broke it open, and exposed his wife’s long-dead corpse.\r\nAfter this incident Thomas Graham not unnaturally conceived the idea\r\nthat his one duty in life was to shoot Jacobins. When he had buried his\r\nwife at Methven he was ready for that duty, and the war with France\r\nbreaking out only five months after, his opportunity was at hand.\r\nThough a civilian, a Whig member of Parliament, and forty-four years\r\nof age, though he had no knowledge of military affairs, and had never\r\nheard a shot fired in anger, he went to the front at once, and fought\r\nthrough the siege of Toulon as a sort of volunteer aide-de-camp to Lord\r\nMulgrave. It is odd that both Julius Cæsar and Oliver Cromwell started\r\nat this same age as soldiers. This was the first of an endless series\r\nof campaigns against the French; Graham got a quasi-military status by\r\nraising at his own expense the 90th Foot, or Perthshire Volunteers, of\r\nwhich he was in reward made honorary colonel. With the curious rank of\r\nhonorary colonel—he never held any lower—he went as British attaché\r\nto the Austrian Army of Italy, getting the post because Englishmen\r\nwho could speak both German and Italian were rare. He saw the unhappy\r\ncampaigns of 1796–97 under Beaulieu, Würmser, and the Archduke Charles,\r\nbeing thus one of the few British observers who witnessed Bonaparte’s\r\nfirst essays in strategy. Then he held staff appointments during the\r\noperations in Minorca and Malta, and again served with the Austrians\r\nin Italy in 1799. After much more service, the last of it as British\r\nattaché with the army of Castaños in Spain, during the Tudela campaign,\r\nhe was at last informed that—all precedents notwithstanding—from an\r\nhonorary colonelcy he was promoted to be a major-general on the regular\r\nestablishment, on account of his long and distinguished service. Down\r\nto 1809 he had seen more fighting than falls to most men, without\r\nowning any proper military rank, for his colonelcy of 1794, which he\r\nhad held for fifteen years, was only titular and temporary, and gave\r\nhim no regular rank. He had technically never been more than a civilian\r\nwith an honorary title!\r\n\r\nYet in 1810 he was entrusted with the important post of commander of\r\nthe British troops in Cadiz, and commenced to take an important part in\r\nthe Peninsular War. He was now sixty-two years of age, and would have\r\nbeen counted past service according to eighteenth century notions.\r\nBut his iron frame gave no signs of approaching decay, no fatigue or\r\nprivation could tire him, and he was one of the boldest riders in the\r\narmy. His portrait shows a man with a regular oval face, a rather\r\nmelancholy expression—there is a sad droop in the eyelids—and abundant\r\nwhite hair, worn rather long. His mouth is firm and inflexible, his\r\ngeneral expression very resolute, but a little tired—that of a man\r\nwho has been for nearly twenty years crusading against an enemy with\r\nwhom no peace must be made, and who does not yet see the end in sight,\r\nbut proposes to fight on till he drops. He was a fine scholar, knew\r\nsix languages, had travelled all over Europe, and was such a master\r\nof his pen that both his dispatches and his private letters and diary\r\nare among the best-written and most interesting original material that\r\nexists for this period.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Graham at Barrosa]\r\n\r\nThe crowning exploit of Graham’s life was the victory which he won,\r\nwith every chance against him, at Barrosa on March 7th, 1811, a\r\nwonderful instance of the triumph of a quick eye, and a sudden resolute\r\nblow over long odds. Caught on the march by a sudden flank attack of\r\nMarshal Victor, owing to the imbecile arrangements of the Spanish\r\nGeneral La Peña, under whose orders he was serving, Graham, instead of\r\nwaiting to be attacked, which would have been fatal, took the offensive\r\nhimself. His troops were strung out on the line of march through a\r\nwood, and there was no time to form a regular order of battle, for the\r\nFrench were absolutely rushing in upon him. Victor thought that he had\r\nbefore him an easy victory, over a force surprised in an impossible\r\nposture. But Graham, throwing out a strong line of skirmishers to hold\r\nback the enemy for the few necessary minutes, aligned his men in the\r\nedge of the wood, without regard for brigade or even for battalion\r\nunity, and attacked the French with such sudden swiftness that it\r\nwas Victor, and not he, who was really surprised. The enemy was\r\nassailed before he had formed any line of battle, or deployed a single\r\nbattalion, and was driven off the field in an hour after a most bloody\r\nfight. Graham led the centre of his own left brigade like a general of\r\nthe Middle Ages, riding ten yards ahead of the line with his plumed hat\r\nwaving in his right hand, and his white hair streaming in the wind.\r\nThis was not the right place for a commanding officer; but the moment\r\nwas a desperate one, and all depended on the swiftness and suddenness\r\nof the stroke; there was no manœuvring possible, and no further orders\r\nsave to go straight on. Improvising his battle-order in five minutes,\r\nwith only 5000 men against 7000, and attacking rather uphill, he won a\r\nmagnificent victory, which would have ended in the complete destruction\r\nof the French if the Spaniard La Peña had moved to his aid. But that\r\nwretched officer remained halted with his whole division only two miles\r\nfrom the field, and did not stir a man to aid his colleague.\r\n\r\nA few months after Barrosa, Graham was moved from Cadiz to join the\r\nmain army in Portugal, at the request of Wellington, who gave him the\r\ncommand of his left wing during the autumn campaign of 1811, and again\r\nthrough the whole of that of 1813. For the greater part of that of 1812\r\nGraham was away on sick leave, for the first time in his life, his eyes\r\nhaving given out from long exposure to the southern sun. Unluckily\r\nfor him, his promotion to command a wing of the grand army meant that\r\nhe was generally under Wellington’s own eye, with small opportunity\r\nof acting for himself. But his chief chose him to take charge of the\r\nmost critical operation of the Vittoria campaign, the long flank march\r\nthrough the mountains of the Tras-os-Montes, which turned the right\r\nwing of the French and forced them out of position after position in\r\na running fight of 200 miles. Still outflanking the enemy, it was he\r\nwho cut in across the high-road to France at Vittoria, and forced the\r\nbeaten army of Jourdan to retire across by-paths, with the loss of all\r\nits artillery, train, baggage, and stores.\r\n\r\nFor the dramatic completeness of this splendid old man’s career, we\r\ncould have wished that it had ended in 1813. But the Home Government,\r\nseeking for a trustworthy officer to command the expedition to Holland\r\nin the following winter, chose Graham to conduct it, and his last\r\ncampaign was marred by a disaster. He drove, it is true, the remnants\r\nof the French army out of Holland, though his force was small—only\r\n7000 men, and formed of raw second battalions hastily collected from\r\nEnglish garrisons. But his daring attempt to escalade the great\r\nfortress of Bergen-op-Zoom, the one stronghold still held by the enemy,\r\nwas a sad failure. Taking advantage of a hard frost, which had made\r\nthe marsh-defences of that strong town useless for the moment, Graham\r\nplanned a midnight attack by four columns, of which two succeeded in\r\ncrossing all obstacles and entering the place. But when all seemed\r\nwon, the general’s part of the scheme having succeeded to admiration,\r\nthe officers in immediate charge of the attack ignored many of their\r\norders, dispersed their men in unwise petty enterprises, and finally\r\nwere attacked and driven out of the town piecemeal by the rallied\r\ngarrison. The loss was terrible, fully 2000 men, of whom half were\r\nprisoners. But the bold conception of the enterprise rather than its\r\nfailure should be put down to Graham’s account. The mismanagement by\r\nhis subordinates was incredible. Wellington, looking over the fortress\r\na year later, is said to have observed that it must have been extremely\r\ndifficult to get in. “But,” he added, “when once in, I wonder how the\r\ndevil they ever suffered themselves to be beaten out again.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE III._\r\n\r\nGENERAL THOMAS GRAHAM, BARON LYNEDOCH, G.C.B., G.C.M.G.\r\n\r\n_From the picture by Sir George Hayter._]\r\n\r\nGraham’s last campaign was marred by this check. But, in the general\r\ndistribution of rewards at the peace of 1814, he was given a peerage,\r\nby the title of Lord Lynedoch, and shared in the other honours of\r\nthe Peninsular Army. Though sixty-six years old when the war ended,\r\nhe survived till 1843, when he had reached the patriarchal age of\r\nninety-six. He did a good service to his old comrades by founding\r\nthe United Service Club, which he originally designed as a place of\r\nrendezvous for old Peninsular officers, of whom he had noticed that\r\nmany were lonely men without family ties, like himself, while others,\r\nstranded in London for a few days, had no central spot where they could\r\ncount on meeting old friends.[106] His portrait hangs, as is right, in\r\nthe most prominent place in the largest room of the institution which\r\nhe founded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Graham and his Admirers]\r\n\r\nI have never found one unkindly word about General Graham, in the\r\nnumerous diaries and autobiographies of the officers and men who\r\nserved under him. All comment on his stately presence, his thoughtful\r\ncourtesy, and his unfailing justice and benevolence. “I may truly say\r\nhe lives in their affections; they not only looked up to him with\r\nconfidence as their commander, but they esteemed and respected him\r\nas their firm friend and protector, which, indeed, he always showed\r\nhimself to be.”[107] “What could not Britons do, when led by such a\r\nchief?” asks another.[108] I might make a considerable list of the\r\nnames of British officers who relate their personal obligation to his\r\nkindness;[109] but perhaps the most convincing evidence of all is\r\nthat of the French Colonel Vigo-Roussillon, one of the enemies whom\r\nhe captured at Barrosa, who has no words strong enough to express the\r\ndelicate generosity with which he was treated while a wounded prisoner\r\nat Cadiz. Graham came to visit him on his sick bed, sent his own\r\nphysician to attend him, and made copious provision for his food and\r\nlodging. For a conscientious hatred for French influence, whether that\r\nof the red Jacobin republic, or that of the Napoleonic despotism, did\r\nnot prevent him from showing his benevolence to individual Frenchmen\r\nthrown upon his mercy.[110]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWELLINGTON’S LIEUTENANTS—PICTON, CRAUFURD, AND OTHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Graham had no enemies, and was loved by every one with whom he\r\ncame in contact, the same cannot be said of the two distinguished\r\nofficers with whom I have next to deal, General Robert Craufurd and Sir\r\nThomas Picton. They were both men of mark, Craufurd even more so than\r\nPicton; they both fell in action at the moment of victory; they were\r\nboth employed by Wellington for the most responsible services, and he\r\nowed much to their admirable executive powers; but both of them were\r\noccasionally out of his good graces. Each of them had many admiring\r\nfriends and many bitter enemies, whose reasons for liking and disliking\r\nthem it is not hard to discover. Both of them were to a certain extent\r\nembittered and disappointed men, who thought that their work had never\r\nreceived adequate recognition, a view for which there was considerable\r\njustification. In other respects they were wholly unlike; their\r\ncharacters differed fundamentally, so much so that when they met it was\r\nnot unfrequently to clash and quarrel.\r\n\r\nPicton, a Welsh country gentleman by birth, was a typical eighteenth\r\ncentury soldier, who had (after the old fashion) entered the army at\r\nthirteen years of age, and had gone on foreign service at fifteen.\r\nHis manners, we gather, were those of the barrack-room; he was a hard\r\ndrinking, hard swearing, rough-and-ready customer. Wellington, who\r\nwas not squeamish, called him “a rough, foul-mouthed devil as ever\r\nlived,[111] but he always behaved extremely well on service.” The\r\nnotorious Duke of Queensberry, “Old Q,” was his friend and admirer, and\r\nleft him a good legacy of £5000 in his will. Old Q’s model heroes were\r\nnot of the Wesleyan Methodist type. One of the strongest impressions\r\nleft on one’s mind by the diaries of those who served under him is that\r\nof his astounding power of malediction. Kincaid’s account of the sack\r\nof Ciudad Rodrigo is dominated by “the voice of Sir Thomas Picton,\r\nwith the power of twenty trumpets proclaiming damnation to all and\r\nsundry.”[112] But if he was destitute of all the graces and some of the\r\nvirtues, Picton was a very fine soldier, with a quick eye, unlimited\r\nself-confidence, and the courage of ten bulldogs. He had, when once\r\nthe Revolutionary War commenced, made his way to the front with great\r\nrapidity. A captain in 1794, he had become a brigadier-general by\r\n1799, and his promotion had been won by undeniable good service. For\r\nhis ultimate misfortune, he was made in 1797 governor of the newly\r\nconquered Spanish island of Trinidad in the West Indies, while still\r\nonly a colonel. This was the beginning of his troubles; the post was\r\nlucrative, dangerous, and difficult. The garrison was insufficient,\r\nand the island was swarming with disbanded Spanish soldiers, runaway\r\nnegro slaves, French adventurers, and privateers and pirates of all\r\nnations from the Spanish Main. Picton had to create order from chaos,\r\nand then to keep it up; his methods were drastic: the lash and the\r\npillory, the branding-irons, and, where necessary, military execution.\r\nIt does not appear on impartial examination that he ever showed himself\r\nself-seeking, partial, or corrupt in his administration; he merely\r\ntried, in his own rough way, to dragoon into order a very unruly and\r\nlawless community. The majority of the better classes approved his\r\nrule, which, as one of them said, “was of the sort required by the\r\ncolony” where a governor “had to make himself feared as well as\r\nbeloved.” Naturally he made many enemies, white, black, and brown,\r\nEnglish and Spanish, adventurers and officials. They kept up a rain\r\nof petitions against him at the Colonial Office, in which he was\r\nrepresented as a sort of Nero. The most acrid and ingenious of them, a\r\nColonel Fullarton, succeeded in finding a method of attack which was\r\ncertain to have a great vogue when tried in England. The old Spanish\r\nlaw still ran in Trinidad, and under it various forms of durance and\r\ntorture were permitted against suspected persons under arrest. A\r\ncase had happened in which a mulatto girl, who had been concerned in\r\nstealing 2000 dollars from a Spanish tobacco merchant, was put to the\r\nbarbarous punishment of picketing (standing with the heels on a stake)\r\nby the local magistrates, to make her confess who had taken the money,\r\nand where it was hidden. After a few minutes she admitted that her\r\nlover had stolen it, with her aid and consent; and this was proved to\r\nbe the fact. Thus under Picton’s rule, and (as it turned out) with his\r\nknowledge, a woman had been put to the torture, though the torture was\r\nslight and the woman guilty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Picton in Trinidad]\r\n\r\nPicton, on returning to England, was therefore accused by Colonel\r\nFullarton of many tyrannical acts, but, above all, of having put\r\na woman to the torture in order to extract a confession, a thing\r\nabhorrent alike to the laws of England and to the common sentiments\r\nof humanity. There followed a long political trial, (for it became a\r\nmatter of Whig and Tory partizanship), in which the Government finally\r\ndropped the prosecution, because it was amply proved that Spanish, not\r\nEnglish, law was running in Trinidad in 1801, since the island had not\r\nbeen annexed till the peace of Amiens in the following year, and that\r\nthe governor had simply allowed the local magistrates to act according\r\nto their usual practice. The other charges all fell through.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the mud stuck, as Fullarton had intended, and Picton\r\nwas generally remembered as the man who had permitted a woman to be\r\ntortured. The trial had dragged over several years, and had been\r\nmost costly to the accused. Since there had been no verdict, owing\r\nto the prosecution having simply been dropped, he had not even the\r\nsatisfaction of being able to say that he had been acquitted by a jury\r\nof his countrymen. There was a sort of slur, however unjust, upon his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nIt therefore argued considerable independence and disregard of public\r\nopinion on the part of Wellington, when he wrote home to ask that\r\nPicton might be sent out to him to command a division,[113] purely on\r\nhis military record as a hard fighter. The general came out to Portugal\r\nwith a name unfavourably known, and to colleagues and subordinates\r\nwho were prepared to view him with a critical eye. “It is impossible\r\nto deny,” writes an officer who served under him, “that a very strong\r\ndislike towards the general was prevalent. His conduct in the island of\r\nTrinidad ... had impressed all ranks with an unfavourable opinion of\r\nthe man. His first appearance was looked for with no little anxiety.\r\nWhen he reached the ground, accompanied by his staff, every eye was\r\nturned towards him, and his appearance and demeanour were closely\r\nobserved. He looked to be a man between fifty and sixty, and I never\r\nsaw a more perfect specimen of a splendid-looking soldier. In vain did\r\nthose who had set him down as a cruel tyrant seek to find out such a\r\ndelineation in his countenance. On the contrary, there was a manly\r\nopen frankness in his appearance that gave a flat contradiction to the\r\nslander. And in truth Picton was _not_ a tyrant, nor did he ever act\r\nas such during the many years that he commanded the 3rd Division. But\r\nif his countenance did not depict him as cruel, there was a sarcastic\r\nseverity about it, and a certain curl of the lip, that marked him as\r\none who despised rather than courted applause. The stern countenance,\r\nrobust frame, caustic speech, and austere demeanour told in legible\r\ncharacters that he was one not likely to say a thing and then not do\r\nas he had said. In a word, his appearance denoted him a man of strong\r\nmind and strong frame.”[114]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Picton and the 88th Foot]\r\n\r\nIt was considered characteristic that he ended his first inspection of\r\nthe division by holding a drum-head court-martial on two soldiers who\r\nhad stolen a goat, and witnessing their punishment. He then rode up to\r\nthe regiment to which the culprits belonged, the 88th, and “in language\r\nnot of that bearing which an officer of his rank should use,” said,\r\n“You are not known in the army by the name of Connaught Rangers, but\r\nby the name of Connaught _footpads_,” with some unnecessary remarks on\r\ntheir country and their religion.\r\n\r\nThis untoward incident was the commencement of a long feud between\r\nPicton and the 88th, which endured all through the war, and led, at\r\nthe end of it, to the Rangers refusing to subscribe to the laudatory\r\naddress and plate which the rest of the 3rd Division offered to their\r\ngeneral, after nearly five years of glorious service. Yet the feud was\r\nnot incompatible with a good deal of reluctant esteem on both sides.\r\nOn the morning after the storm of Ciudad Rodrigo, in which the Rangers\r\nhad taken a most gallant part, we are told that some of the men, more\r\nthan usually elated in spirits, called out to their commander, “Well,\r\ngeneral, we gave you a cheer last night: it’s your turn now.” Picton,\r\nsmiling, took off his hat and said, “Here, then, you drunken set of\r\nbrave rascals, hurrah! And we’ll soon be at Badajoz,” to which scene of\r\neven greater glory for the 3rd Division he did conduct them within a\r\nfew weeks.\r\n\r\nThe considerable string of stories, true, half-true, or apocryphal,\r\nwhich cling round the name of Picton relate in about equal proportions,\r\non the one hand, to his extreme intrepidity and coolness in action,\r\nand, on the other, to his vehemence alike of language and of action,\r\nwhich struck terror into the objects of his wrath. The best of the\r\nformer with which I am acquainted comes from the same diarist,\r\nGrattan, of the 88th, whom I have already been quoting. It relates\r\nto the day of El Bodon (September 25, 1811), when the 3rd Division,\r\ncaught in a somewhat isolated position owing to one of Wellington’s few\r\ntactical slips, was retreating in column across a level upland, beset\r\nby Montbrun and three brigades of French cavalry. “For six miles across\r\na perfect flat, without the slightest protection from any incident of\r\nthe ground, without artillery, almost without cavalry, did the 3rd\r\nDivision continue its march. During the whole time the French cavalry\r\nnever quitted us, and six light guns, advancing with them and taking\r\nthe division in flank and rear, poured in a frightful fire of grape\r\nand canister. General Picton conducted himself with his accustomed\r\ncoolness. He rode on the left flank of the column, and repeatedly\r\ncautioned the different battalions to mind the quarter distance and the\r\n‘tellings off.’ At last we got within a mile of our entrenched camp at\r\nFuente Guinaldo, when Montbrun, impatient lest his prey should escape\r\nfrom his grasp, ordered his troopers to bring up their right shoulders\r\nand incline towards our column. The movement was not exactly bringing\r\nup his squadrons into line, but it was the next thing to it. They were\r\nwithin half pistol-shot of us. Picton took off his hat, and holding it\r\nover his eyes as a shade from the sun, looked sternly but anxiously at\r\nthe French. The clatter of the horses and the clanking of the scabbards\r\nwere so great, as the right squadron moved up, that many thought it the\r\nforerunner of a general charge. Some mounted officer called out, ‘Had\r\nwe not better form square?’ ‘No,’ replied Picton; ‘it is but a _ruse_\r\nto frighten us, and it _won’t do_.’ In half an hour more we were safe\r\nwithin our lines.”[115]\r\n\r\nThis was a fine example of cool resolution, and ended happily what\r\nhad been a very anxious hour for Wellington. But I imagine that the\r\noccasion on which the Commander-in-Chief owed most to the commander of\r\nthe 3rd Division was the storm of Badajoz. It will be remembered that\r\non that bloody night the main attack on the breaches failed completely,\r\ndespite of the desperate exertions of the 4th and Light Divisions.\r\nThe attempt by escalade upon the towering walls of the castle, which\r\nproved successful and caused the fall of the fortress, had not been in\r\nWellington’s original plan, but was suggested to him by Picton, who\r\nhad viewed the breaches, and had not been convinced that they could\r\nbe carried. Picton pleaded that he might be allowed to try the castle\r\nwith his own division as a subsidiary operation.[116] He succeeded\r\ntriumphantly, and so saved the day. If he had not made his offer, the\r\nchance of the city’s falling would have been infinitely less, even\r\nthough a brigade of the 5th Division did succeed in entering Badajoz at\r\nanother point remote from the fatal breaches. Though Picton got plenty\r\nof praise for his courage on this night, it was not generally known\r\nthat he ought to have been praised even more for his prescience.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Picton at Badajoz]\r\n\r\nNumberless instances of Picton’s skill and tenacity might be quoted,\r\nall through the six years of his service under Wellington. But the\r\nanecdote which best illustrates his Spartan courage is one which\r\nbelongs to the last three days of his life. At Quatre Bras, where his\r\ndivision so long held back the vehement attacks of Ney, he received\r\na musket ball in his left side, which, though it gave a somewhat\r\nglancing blow and did not penetrate, broke two of his ribs. Believing\r\nthat the battle would be continued next day, he resolved not to return\r\nhimself as wounded, lest the surgeons should insist on sending him to\r\nthe rear. He roughly bound up the wound with the assistance of his\r\nsoldier servant, and was on his horse throughout June 17, conducting\r\nthe retreat of his division. On the 18th, as every one knows, he was\r\nkilled—shot through the head—while leading the decisive charge which\r\nbeat d’Erlon’s corps from the heights of Mont St. Jean. Only when his\r\nbody was stripped, to be laid in the coffin, was it discovered that\r\nhe had gone into action at Waterloo with a dangerous, perhaps mortal,\r\nwound two days old upon him. For his side was so swollen and blackened\r\naround the broken ribs, that the surgeons thought that the neglected\r\nwound might very possibly have caused his death, if he had come\r\nunharmed through the battle of June 18.\r\n\r\nSuch virtues were not incompatible with grave faults. Picton’s violent\r\nlanguage and reckless disregard of common forms of propriety form the\r\nsubject of many tales. When he thought that the assistant engineer who\r\nguided the 3rd Division at the storm of Badajoz had led them astray, he\r\ndrew his sword, and with an oath said that he would cut the blind fool\r\ndown if he had gone wrong. This we have on the first-hand evidence of\r\nthat officer, who was fortunately able to demonstrate that the right\r\npath had been taken.[117] A better-known tale is that of Picton and\r\nthe commissary, a story which has also been attributed to Craufurd,\r\nand recently by Mr. Fortescue to General Sherbrooke. The commissary\r\nhad been ordered, during one of Wellington’s long marches, to have the\r\nrations of the 3rd Division ready at a certain spot at a certain hour.\r\nThey were not forthcoming, but only a series of excuses, to account\r\nfor their non-arrival. Picton grimly pointed to a neighbouring tree\r\nand said, “Well, sir, if you don’t get the rations for my division to\r\nthe place mentioned by twelve o’clock to-morrow, I will hang you on\r\nit at half-past.” The commissary rode straight to Lord Wellington and\r\ncomplained, with much injured dignity, of the general’s violent and\r\nungentlemanly language. His lordship coolly remarked, “Oh, he said\r\nthat he’d _hang_ you, did he?” “Yes, my lord.” “Well, General Picton\r\nis a man of his word. I think you’d better get the rations up in\r\ntime.” Further advice was unnecessary; the rations were there to the\r\nmoment.[118] It is odd to find that many years after Picton’s death\r\na question was asked in Parliament, and a controversy raged in the\r\nnewspapers, as to which of three named commissaries was the object of\r\nPicton’s anger.\r\n\r\nIt would be wrong, however, to paint Picton as a mere vial of wrath,\r\nfoaming into ungovernable rage in and out of season. When he was\r\nangry he generally had good cause; it was only the over-vehemence of\r\nhis language that caused him to become a centre of legends. Odd as\r\nit may seem, the rank and file did not consider him a tyrant; it was\r\nacknowledged that he was very just, that he never punished without\r\nhearing the defence, that he was capable of pardoning, that when he\r\nhit hard he did so not without reason. A sergeant of the 45th wrote on\r\nhim thus: “He was strict sometimes, especially about plunder, always\r\ntalking about how wrong it was to plunder the poor people because\r\ncountries happened to be at war. He used to flog the men when they were\r\nfound out; but where he flogged, many generals took life. Besides this,\r\nthe men thought that he had their welfare at heart. Every soldier in\r\nthe division knew that if he had anything to complain of, ‘Old Picton’\r\nwould listen to his story, and set him right if he could. On the whole,\r\nour fellows always thought him a _kind_ general, in spite of his strong\r\nlanguage.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Picton and Wellington]\r\n\r\nThis same sense of justice is brought out in the diaries of several\r\nofficers, who speak in feeling terms of his endeavours to get obscure\r\nmerit rewarded, and to keep down jobbery in promotion,[119] or tyranny\r\nof senior officers over their juniors. He was very accessible, and\r\neven friendly and considerate, to his subordinates. This familiarity,\r\nwhich endeared him to subalterns, was (as we have already noticed) not\r\nagreeable to Lord Wellington. Their intercourse was formal and not very\r\nfrequent. Wellington once went out of his way to say that it was not\r\ntrue that he had ever had a quarrel with Picton, or been on anything\r\nbut good terms with him. But while acknowledging his services, he\r\nnever pretended that he had any personal liking for him.\r\n\r\nPicton always thought that he suffered grave injustice at the end of\r\nthe war, by not being included in the list of five Peninsular officers\r\nwho were made peers for their services. “If the coronet were lying\r\non the crown of a breach, I should have as good a chance as any of\r\nthem,” was his caustic remark. The explanation formally given for his\r\nomission was that all the five generals honoured, Beresford, Hill,\r\nGraham, Hope, and Stapleton Cotton, had held for some time “distinct\r\ncommands,” and that Picton had not. But though this explanation held\r\ngood for the first three, it did not really cover the cases of Hope and\r\nCotton, whose independent commands had been little more than nominal;\r\nand Picton had on several occasions—notably in the Pyrenees—exercised\r\nindependent authority in a very similar way. The fact was that he was\r\nan unpopular man, and that the Ministry omitted him, while Wellington\r\nmade no effort to push his claims. He showed his displeasure by\r\nannouncing his intention to retire from the army in 1814, and would\r\nhave done so in the next year, if Napoleon’s return from Elba had not\r\ncalled him into the field, to die at Waterloo.\r\n\r\nTo finish our sketch of this curious and contradictory character, we\r\nmust mention that Picton was a profound despiser of all sorts of pomp\r\nand ceremony. His dress, except on gala days, was careless and often\r\nunmilitary. He fought Quatre-Bras, as several witnesses remarked, in a\r\ntall beaver hat, and in the Vittoria campaign, because he was suffering\r\nfrom his eyes, wore a very broad-brimmed variety of the same type.\r\nHis aide-de-camps copied him, as was natural, in their disregard for\r\nappearance, and it is said that from their manners and dress they were\r\nknown as “the bear and ragged staff,”[120] a term that has been applied\r\non several more recent occasions to similar parties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE IV._\r\n\r\nGENERAL SIR THOMAS PICTON, K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Robert Craufurd]\r\n\r\nA very different man from Sir Thomas Picton was the last of the\r\ndivisional generals whose character we have to deal with, Robert\r\nCraufurd. They were both effective weapons in the hands of Wellington,\r\nbut Picton’s efficiency was rather that of the battering ram, while\r\nCraufurd’s was rather that of the rapier. Robert Craufurd, like Picton,\r\ncame to the Peninsula as rather a disappointed man, his grievance\r\nbeing that, despite much brilliant service, he had dropped behind in\r\npromotion, and found himself a junior brigadier-general, when men\r\nseveral years his junior, like Hill, Beresford, and Wellington himself,\r\nwere holding posts of much greater importance. Craufurd was one of\r\nour few scientific soldiers; he had studied so far back as 1782 the\r\ntactics of the army of Frederic the Great at Berlin, and had translated\r\ninto English the official Prussian treatise on the Art of War. His\r\nknowledge of German, which none other of Wellington’s officers save\r\nGraham possessed, had caused him, in 1794, to be given the important\r\npost of military attaché with the Austrian Army in the Netherlands,\r\nand afterwards on the Rhine, and he followed Coburg and the Archduke\r\nCharles for three years through a series of campaigns, in which failure\r\nwas much more frequent than success. When the war broke out once more\r\nbetween Austria and the French republic, he was again sent in 1799 to\r\nserve with his old friends, and accompanied the headquarters of General\r\nHotze’s army in Switzerland, till he was called off to share in the\r\nDuke of York’s ill-managed invasion of Holland in the end of the same\r\nyear. Like Graham, therefore, Craufurd had the sorrow of witnessing\r\na long series of disasters, for which he was not in the least\r\nresponsible. As his reports and dispatches show, he discharged his duty\r\nwith zeal and excellent capacity; but his sarcastic tongue and violent\r\ntemper seem to have stood in the way of his promotion. A major in 1794,\r\nafter thirteen years’ service, he was still only a lieutenant-colonel\r\nin 1801, and during these years had seen numberless comrades climb\r\nover his head, though he had all the while been discharging important\r\nduties in a fashion which won the admiration of all with whom he came\r\ninto personal contact. It looks as if the constant reports of disaster,\r\nwhich he had to make, had connected his name in official circles with\r\nthe notion of ill-luck. In 1801, disappointed of an official post in\r\nIreland for which he had applied, he went on half-pay, and entered\r\nParliament as member for a pocket-borough which chanced to be in his\r\nbrother’s gift.[121] For the next five years he was a constant speaker\r\nin Parliament on military topics, and a very bitter critic of the\r\npolicy of Pitt, Dundas, and Addington. His views as to the proper\r\norganization of the British forces, in first and second line, for the\r\nbeating off of French invasion were set forth at vast length, and\r\nalways clashed with those of ministers. It is only fair to say that he\r\nwas in the main right, and they wrong; he pleaded for the reduction of\r\nthe numberless ill-disciplined volunteer corps, and wished to see in\r\nthe first line a very large regular army raised for short service, and\r\nbehind it the second line, levied by conscription, as a sort of _levée\r\nen masse_ trained for irregular fighting, and not expected to manœuvre\r\nor to take part in pitched battles. Craufurd’s virulent criticism was\r\nvery telling, but hardly likely to help his promotion as a military\r\nman, so long as the Addington and Pitt ministries were in power.\r\nWhen, however, Pitt died, and the Whig administration called “All the\r\nTalents” came into power, the new War Secretary, William Windham, was\r\ndisposed to do everything possible for Craufurd, who was not only his\r\npersonal friend, but often advised him on matters of organization and\r\ntechnical military subjects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Craufurd at Buenos Ayres]\r\n\r\nAt last, after five years spent in rather acrid parliamentary\r\ncriticism, Craufurd was given an opportunity by his friend Windham\r\nto see service in a higher post than had ever before fallen to his\r\nlot. Though only just promoted to a full colonelcy, he was given the\r\ncommand of a brigade of 4000 men, destined for a distant expedition.\r\nThis adventure was one of the most hare-brained of the many futile\r\nschemes of the unlucky cabinet then in power. Craufurd was to take\r\nin hand nothing less than a voyage round Cape Horn, for the conquest\r\nof Chili! He never saw the straits of Magellan, however, for his\r\nforce, after it had sailed, was distracted to form part of the unhappy\r\narmament under General Whitelocke, which made the disastrous attack on\r\nBuenos Ayres in 1807. Placed in the front, in command of Whitelocke’s\r\nLight Brigade, and thrust forward into the tangle of streets among\r\nwhich the incapable general dispersed his troops in many small columns,\r\nCraufurd fought his way so far on that he was surrounded, cut off from\r\nthe main body, and compelled to capitulate with the remnants of his\r\nmen. Thus his first chance of distinction in the field, at the head of\r\na considerable force, ended in absolute disaster. He was acquitted of\r\nall blame at Whitelocke’s court-martial, but the thought that he was\r\nremembered as the officer who had surrendered a British brigade rankled\r\nin his mind, and sat heavy on his soul down to the end of his life.\r\n\r\nThe fact that he was held blameless, however, was marked by his\r\nappointment to the command of a brigade in the Peninsular Army in 1808.\r\nBut his usual ill-luck seemed at first to attend him. He arrived too\r\nlate for Vimeiro; when serving under Moore he was detached from the\r\nmain army, and did not fight at Corunna. In the next year, returning\r\nto serve under Wellesley, he was late for Talavera, though to reach\r\nthe battlefield he made his well-remembered march of forty-three miles\r\nin twenty-six hours, which Napier, by a slip of memory, has converted\r\ninto an impossible achievement—a march of sixty-two miles in that time,\r\nwhich not even Craufurd and the famous 43rd, 52nd, and 95th could have\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Craufurd and the Light Division]\r\n\r\nFrom 1809 onward Craufurd at last got his chance, and for the greater\r\npart of three years[122] was in command of Wellington’s advance, his\r\n“Light Brigade” of 1809 becoming the “Light Division” in 1810. At\r\nlength he got what Fate had denied him in all his earlier career, a\r\npost of great distinction and responsibility, and a sight of victory;\r\nfor fifteen years he had been witnessing nothing but retreats and\r\ndisasters. On his happy days, and they were many, Craufurd was\r\nundoubtedly the most brilliant lieutenant that Wellington ever owned.\r\nYet he was not trusted by his chief as Hill, for example, was trusted,\r\nbecause of his occasional lapses from caution, and from the blind\r\nobedience which his chief exacted. Occasionally he took risks, or\r\nventured to modify the orders given him—the faults of an eager and\r\nambitious spirit in an hour of excitement.\r\n\r\nHis achievements were great and noble. The most splendid of them was\r\nthe protection of the north-east frontier of Portugal throughout the\r\nwhole spring and summer of 1810, when he was set with his own small\r\ndivision and two regiments of cavalry to lie out many miles in front\r\nof the main army, and to watch the assembling host of Masséna, till\r\nthe moment when it should make its forward move for serious invasion.\r\nFor five months he guarded a long front against an enemy of sixfold\r\nforce, without allowing his line to be pierced, or suffering the French\r\nto gain any information as to what was going on in his rear. This\r\nwas a great feat, only accomplished by the most complete and minute\r\norganization of his very modest resources. There were fifteen fords\r\nalong the Agueda, the river whose line he had to keep, all of which had\r\nto be watched in dry weather, and many even when the stream was high.\r\nThe French had 3000 cavalry opposite him in March and April, 5000 in\r\nMay and June, the latter a force exceeding in numbers the total of his\r\nwhole division. Behind the hostile cavalry screen he knew that there\r\nwere two full army corps, or over 40,000 men; and many detachments of\r\nthis infantry lay only four or five miles from Craufurd’s outposts, and\r\nmight attack him at any moment. Yet he never suffered any surprise;\r\nso well were his observation-posts placed and managed, that the least\r\nmovement of the enemy was reported to him in an incredibly short time.\r\nThe whole web of communications quivered at the slightest touch, and\r\nthe Light Division was concentrated ready to fight or to retreat, as\r\nprudence dictated, long before the attack could develop. So wonderfully\r\nhad he trained his troops that any battalion, as Napier records, was\r\nready under arms within seven minutes from the first alarm signal,\r\nand within a quarter of an hour could be in order of battle on its\r\nappointed post, with its baggage loaded and assembled ready for\r\ndeparture at a convenient distance to the rear.\r\n\r\nAs his aide-de-camp, Shaw Kennedy, the historian of this summer,\r\nwrites, “To understand Craufurd’s operations the _calculation_ must\r\nnever be lost sight of, for it was on calculation that he acted all\r\nalong.” Special reports were made of the numerous fords of the Agueda\r\n_every_ morning, and the rapidity of its rises was periodically marked.\r\nBeacons were placed on conspicuous heights, so as to communicate\r\ninformation as to the enemy’s offensive movements. To ensure against\r\nmistakes in the night, pointers were kept at the stations of\r\ncommunication, directed to the beacons. The cavalry regiment at the\r\noutposts was the first Hussars of the King’s German Legion, a veteran\r\ncorps, chosen because its officers were considered superior in scouting\r\npower to that of any other light cavalry unit with the army. Craufurd,\r\nknowing German well, communicated with each of its squadron leaders\r\ndirectly; each knew his own duty for the front that he covered, and\r\neach worked out his part admirably. The general was untiring, could\r\nremain on horseback unwearied for almost any length of time, and knew\r\npersonally every ford, defile, and by-path. Hence nothing was left to\r\nchance.[123]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Craufurd and Wellington]\r\n\r\nIt was a pity that Craufurd ended this splendid piece of service, which\r\nlasted over five months of daily danger, by fighting the unnecessary\r\n“Combat of the Coa” on July 4, 1810. Staying a day too long beyond that\r\nstream despite of Wellington’s clear direction to retire the moment\r\nthat he was hard pressed, he was suddenly attacked by the whole of\r\nNey’s corps, 20,000 men or more, and forced over the Coa, with loss\r\nwhich might have been great but for the excellence of the battalions\r\nhe had trained and the cool-headed tactical skill of his regimental\r\nofficers. He held the bridge of the Coa successfully when he had\r\ncrossed it, and lost no more than 300 men; but he had disobeyed orders\r\nand risked his division. Wellington was justly displeased, and let\r\nhis lieutenant know it. But he did not rebuke him in his dispatches,\r\nand continued him in his command. He wrote home in a confidential\r\nletter, “You will say, ‘Why not accuse Craufurd?’ I answer, ‘Because\r\nif I am to be hanged for it, I cannot accuse a man who meant well,\r\nand whose error was one of judgment, not of intention.’” But for the\r\nfuture he kept Craufurd nearer to himself, and did not place him so\r\nfar away that he had much chance of trying strategical experiments on\r\nhis own responsibility. Even so, there were other occasions on which\r\nthe general’s proneness to think for himself got him into trouble.\r\nOne was on September 25, 1811, on the day of the combat of El Bodon,\r\nwhen Craufurd, thrown forward into a hazardous position by his chief’s\r\norders, was twelve hours late in joining the main army. He had been\r\ntold to make a night march, but waited till dawn, because he was moving\r\nin a difficult and broken country full of ravines and torrents, where\r\nhe judged that movement in the dark was dangerous. By his delay the\r\narmy was concentrated half a day later than Wellington intended. “I\r\nam glad to see you safe,” observed the Commander-in-Chief with some\r\nasperity, as the Light Division filed into the scantily manned position\r\nat Fuente Guinaldo. “Oh, I was in no danger, I assure you.” “But _I_\r\nwas, from your conduct,” answered Wellington. Whereupon Craufurd\r\nremarked to his staff, “He’s d——d crusty to-day.”[124] In this case\r\nit must be remarked, in justice to Craufurd, that it was his chief\r\nwho had placed him in the hazardous position, not himself, and that\r\nhis judgment that the night march was impracticable was very probably\r\ncorrect. But he had disobeyed an order, and it was remembered against\r\nhim by the inflexible Wellington.\r\n\r\nAgainst these lapses must be set a long career of careful and\r\nscientific soldiering, with movements of brilliant manœuvring, and\r\nsudden strokes, in which no other Peninsular general could vie with\r\nhim. The repulse of Ney’s corps at Bussaco was perhaps the most\r\nglorious exploit of Craufurd and his Light Division. The way in which\r\nthe French on this occasion were detained and harassed by light troops,\r\nand then, just as they reached the crest of the position, charged and\r\nswept downhill by the rush of a much inferior force, launched at the\r\nright moment, was a beautiful example of tactics. The most astonishing\r\npart of it was that, by his careful choice of a position, and judicious\r\nconcealment of his line till the critical minute, Craufurd beat his\r\nenemy with hardly any loss; he had only 177 casualties, the French\r\nopposed to him over 1200. Yet there was another feat which, though less\r\nshowy, was probably an even greater example of tactical skill than\r\nthe stroke at Bussaco. This was the advance and retreat of the Light\r\nDivision at Fuentes de Oñoro (May 5, 1811), when Craufurd was sent out\r\nof the main British position to rescue the 7th Division, which was cut\r\noff and nearly surrounded by an overwhelming force of French cavalry.\r\nHaving disengaged the compromised division, Craufurd had to retreat\r\nback to the main body with five brigades of fine cavalry, aided by\r\nhorse artillery, surging round him on all sides, and seeking for an\r\nopportunity to burst in. To retreat in square across two miles of open\r\nplateau, very well adapted for the action of horsemen, was a delicate\r\nand dangerous task. Yet Craufurd achieved it with perfect security,\r\nand brought in his whole division to Wellington’s position with a loss\r\nof less than fifty men. As an exhibition of nerve and skill it even\r\nexceeded Picton’s retreat at El Bodon, for the French horse on this\r\noccasion were more numerous, and flushed with previous success, and the\r\nLight Division was a smaller body than the 3rd division by 4000 men to\r\n5200. The distance covered, however, during the crisis of retreat at\r\nFuentes was much shorter, only two miles to seven at El Bodon.\r\n\r\nCraufurd fell in action before 1812 was many days old, being killed\r\nby a chance shot while watching and directing the storm of the lesser\r\nbreach at Ciudad Rodrigo from the further side of the glacis (January\r\n19). Otherwise his peculiar talents would no doubt have been exhibited\r\nin commanding the rear-guard during the retreat from Burgos, and the\r\nadvance during the campaign of Vittoria. The character of the fighting\r\nin the Pyrenees would also have suited admirably his particular style\r\nof management. He was bitterly missed by his officers, Charles Alten,\r\nhis successor in command of the Light Division being a general of much\r\nmore pedestrian quality,[125] who might never fail to make an attempt\r\nto obey Wellington’s orders to the best of his ability, but could\r\nnever supplement them by any improvisation of his own, of which he was\r\nincapable. The operations of the Light Division after Craufurd’s death\r\nwere always admirable so far as the conduct of officers and men went,\r\nbut there was no longer any genius in the way in which they were led.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Craufurd’s Faults]\r\n\r\nCraufurd, unlike Hill or Graham, and like his rival Picton, had many\r\nenemies. He was a strict disciplinarian, to his officers even more\r\nthan to his men, and had a quick temper and a caustic tongue. His\r\nanger used to vent itself not in bursts of swearing, such as Picton\r\nwould indulge in, but by well-framed and lucid speeches of bitter\r\nsarcasm, which probably gave more offence than any amount of oaths.\r\nBeing a highly educated man, and a practised parliamentary speaker,\r\nhe could put an amount of polished contempt into a rebuke which was\r\nnot easily forgotten. It was probably this trick that made enemies of\r\nthe Napiers, both of whom speak very bitterly of him in their diaries\r\nand other writings, though William Napier in his history gives him the\r\ndue credit for his many brilliant achievements.[126] Several others of\r\nhis officers speak bitterly of his intellectual arrogance; one calls\r\nhim a “tyrant”; another says that he never forgot a grudge. But he had\r\nno fewer friends than enemies; many of the best of his subordinates,\r\nlike Shaw Kennedy and Campbell, loved him well, and (what is more\r\nsurprising) the rank and file, on whom his wrath often fell in the form\r\nof the lash, felt not only confidence but enthusiasm for him. The best\r\nof all his eulogies comes from a 95th man, Rifleman Harris, and is well\r\nworth quoting, for its simple manliness.\r\n\r\n“I do not think I ever admired any man who wore the British uniform\r\nmore than I did General Craufurd. I could fill a book with descriptions\r\nof him, for I frequently had my eye upon him in the hurry of action.\r\nThe Rifles liked him, but they feared him, for he could be terrible\r\nwhen insubordination showed itself in the ranks. ‘You think because\r\nyou are riflemen that you may do whatever you think proper,’ said he\r\none day to the miserable and savage crew around him on the retreat to\r\nCorunna; ‘but I’ll teach you the difference before I have done with\r\nyou.’ I remember one evening during that retreat he detected two men\r\nstraying away from the main body; it was in an early stage of that\r\ndisastrous flight, and Craufurd knew that he must keep his division\r\ntogether. He halted the brigade with a voice of thunder, ordered a\r\ndrum-head court-martial on the instant, and they were sentenced to a\r\nhundred a-piece. While the hasty trial was taking place, Craufurd,\r\ndismounting from his horse, stood in the midst, looking stern and angry\r\nas a worried bulldog. He did not like retreating, that man.\r\n\r\n“When the trial was over, it was too dark to inflict the punishment.\r\nHe marched all night on foot, and when morning dawned his hair, beard,\r\nand eyebrows were covered with the frost; we were all in the same\r\ncondition. Scarcely had dawn appeared when the general called a halt,\r\namong the snow on the hills. Ordering a square to be formed, he spoke\r\nto the brigade.\r\n\r\n“‘Although I shall obtain the good will neither of the officers nor of\r\nthe men here by so doing, I am resolved to punish those men according\r\nto the sentence awarded, even though the French are at our heels. Begin\r\nwith Daniel Howans.’\r\n\r\n“The men were brought out, and their Lieutenant-Colonel, Hamilton Wade,\r\nat the same time stepped forward, and lowering his sword, requested he\r\nwould forgive these men, as they were both of them good soldiers, who\r\nhad fought in all the battles of Portugal. ‘I order _you_, sir,’ said\r\nthe general, ‘to do your duty. These men shall be punished.’ After\r\nseventy-five lashes, Craufurd stopped the flogging. But before he put\r\nthe brigade in motion again, he gave us another short address, pretty\r\nmuch after this style—\r\n\r\n“‘I give you all notice that I shall halt the brigade again the very\r\nfirst moment I perceive any man disobeying my orders, and try him by\r\ncourt-martial on the spot.’ He then gave the word, and we resumed our\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Craufurd’s Severity]\r\n\r\n“Many who read this may suppose that it was a cruel and unnecessary\r\nseverity, under the dreadful and harassing circumstances of that\r\nretreat: but I, who was there, a common soldier in the regiment to\r\nwhich these men belonged, say that it was quite necessary. No man but\r\none formed of stuff like General Craufurd could have saved the brigade\r\nfrom perishing altogether. If he flogged two, he saved hundreds from\r\ndeath by his management.”\r\n\r\nThere was a curious anecdote concerning Craufurd’s funeral published in\r\nthe _Saturday Review_ lately,[127] from the unpublished reminiscences\r\nof a contemporary, which illustrates well enough the reverence with\r\nwhich the Light Division looked upon its old chief. One of his\r\nstrongest principles had been that troops on the march must never\r\nmake a detour to avoid fordable streams or deep mud, nor break their\r\nranks to allow each man to pick shallow water, or hard stones among\r\nthe wet. The delay so caused was, he held, such a hindrance to rapid\r\nmovement that it must not be allowed. He had been known to flog men who\r\nstraggled from the ranks in the water, in order to fill their bottles,\r\nor to stoop down to take a long drink.[128] He had even caused an\r\nofficer, whom he caught evading a wetting by riding pick-a-back upon\r\nhis soldier-servant, to be set down with a splash in the middle of a\r\nstream.[129] Coming back from Craufurd’s funeral, the leading company\r\nof the Light Division passed by an excavation at the rear of the siege\r\nworks, half-filled by mud and water. Instead of turning its end to\r\navoid the wet, the men looked at the inundation, pulled themselves\r\ntogether, and marched straight through it, with great regularity and\r\nsteadiness, as if they were passing before a general officer at a\r\nreview. The whole division followed through the slush. It seemed to\r\nthem that the best testimony to their old commander’s memory was to\r\nhonour his best-known theory, when he was no longer there to enforce\r\nits acceptance by his usual drastic methods.\r\n\r\nI could write much more of this notable character, with all its\r\nfaults and merits. But so much must suffice. Nor have I space to tell\r\nof the other senior generals of the Peninsular War, though some of\r\nthem, such as Leith and Cole, were great fighting men, just the tools\r\nthat suited Wellington’s hand. They were, however, never trusted\r\nwith independent commands, so that it is impossible to judge of\r\ntheir full mental stature. I should be inclined to think very highly\r\nof Cole from his conduct at Albuera, for it was he who ordered, on\r\nhis own responsibility, without any permission from Beresford, the\r\nfamous advance of the Fusilier Brigade and Harvey’s Portuguese, which\r\nturned into a victory that most perilous battle.[130] But of most\r\nof Wellington’s divisional officers we can only say that they were\r\ncompetent for the task set them—the vigorous carrying out of orders\r\nwhich were given them, but in whose framing they had no part. At the\r\nmost, tactical skill in execution can be attributed to them, and of\r\nthis there was no lack, as witness details of Salamanca, Vittoria,\r\nand the scattered fighting in the Pyrenees. Almost as much can be\r\npredicated of some of the great brigadiers, who managed their details\r\nwell, but never had the chance of showing their full powers. It would\r\nbe easy to make a long list of them; at least Kempt, Pack, Barns,\r\nMackinnon, Colborne, Hay, Lumley, Ross, Halkett, Byng, Pakenham,\r\nBeckwith, and Barnard should be included in the list. Some of them died\r\nor were invalided early, others commanded brigades at Waterloo again,\r\nbut none, save Byng, of this string of names, was ever given permanent\r\ncommand of a division, though several of them had held the interim\r\ncharge of one in the Peninsula, when their regular chiefs were sick or\r\nabsent. Ross and Pakenham alone were promoted to a separate command,\r\nboth in America. The former had charge of the expedition which went to\r\nthe Potomac and Chesapeake in 1813–14; he took Washington by a vigorous\r\nstroke, but fell in action shortly after, while conducting an attack\r\non Baltimore, which ceased when he fell. Pakenham’s expedition to New\r\nOrleans was a series of misfortunes, of which some part at least must\r\nbe attributed to his own fault. It is certain that Wellington never\r\ntrained a general who proved himself a first-rate exponent of the art\r\nof war; but his system (as we have said above) was not calculated to\r\nfoster initiative or self-reliance among his lieutenants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some Unsatisfactory Subordinates]\r\n\r\nOther subordinates Wellington possessed, of whom we can say that they\r\nwere not up to their work, even in the carrying out of the orders\r\ngiven them with common self-reliance and clear-headedness. Such were\r\nSpencer and Slade, who were only capable of going forward to carry\r\nout a definite order; it was necessary, so to speak, that they should\r\nsimply be put like trams on a line, and shoved forward, or they would\r\nslacken the pace and come to a stop, from want of initiative and moving\r\npower. Some few, like Sir William Erskine, who was Wellington’s pet\r\naversion—yet irremovable because of the political influence that backed\r\nhim—were positively dangerous from a combination of short-sightedness,\r\ncarelessness, and self-will. In one dispatch Wellington says that he\r\nthinks that he is a little wrong in his head.[131] It is astounding\r\nthat after Erskine’s mistakes at Casal Novo and Sabugal, Wellington\r\ndid not get rid of him at all costs; but he simply tried to shunt\r\nhim on to commands where it was unlikely that he could do much harm,\r\nand continued solemnly to rehearse his name with approval in his\r\ndispatches, along with those of all other officers of his rank, till\r\nthe unfortunate man committed suicide, in a moment of insanity,\r\nin the interval between the campaigns of 1812 and 1813. This was\r\nthe strongest case of difficulty which Wellington, for reasons of\r\npolitics and patronage at home, did not care to face by the decisive\r\nstep of sending home the general in disgrace. But there were several\r\nbrigadier-generals whom he had not asked for, whom he disliked, and\r\nwhose departure from the Peninsula he saluted with a small psalm of\r\nthanksgiving in his private letters.[132] It is certainly astonishing\r\nthat, even after 1811, he was not given a free hand to get rid of\r\nsubordinates whom he knew to be incompetent or recalcitrant, any more\r\nthan he was given the power to promote officers without a tedious\r\nreference to the Horse Guards. It is true that in the later years of\r\nthe war his recommendations were generally (but not always) carried\r\nout; yet it took whole months for a request made in a letter from\r\nSalamanca or Madrid to reach London, to be there acceded to, and then\r\nto take effect by a publication of the _Gazette_. The power to punish\r\nor reward with promptness was never granted; there was always a long\r\ndelay. And both punishment and reward lose much of their salutary\r\neffect when there is an interval of months between the act and its\r\nconsequence. Napoleon had a unique advantage in being at once the\r\ncommander-in-chief and the dispenser of favours and chastisement; with\r\nhim there was no time lost in lengthy reference to a home government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF THE ARMY: HEADQUARTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving dealt with the greater personalities among Wellington’s\r\nlieutenants, it remains that we should speak of the organization by\r\nwhich his army was set in motion.\r\n\r\nSome great commanders have trusted much to their staff, and have kept\r\ntheir ablest subordinates about their person. This was pre-eminently\r\nnot the case with Wellington: he was as averse to providing himself\r\nwith a regular chief-of-the-staff, as he was to allowing a formal\r\nsecond-in-command to accompany his army. The duties which would,\r\naccording to modern ideas, fall to the chief-of-the-staff, were by\r\nhim divided between three officers, one of whom was of quite junior\r\nstanding, and only one of whom held a higher rank than that of colonel.\r\nThese officers were the Military Secretary, the Quartermaster-General,\r\nand the Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\nThe Military Secretary was merely responsible for the correct drawing\r\nout, and the transmission to the proper person or department, of the\r\ncorrespondence of the commander-in-chief. The post was held from April\r\n27, 1809, to September 19, 1810, by Lieutenant-Colonel Bathurst, of\r\nthe 60th. On the last-named date he went home on leave, and Captain\r\nLord Fitzroy Somerset was given the status of acting-secretary, and\r\nconfirmed as actual secretary three months later on January 1, 1811.\r\nThis officer, better remembered by his later title as the Lord Raglan\r\nof the Crimean War, held the office till the end of the war—by which\r\ntime he had reached the rank of colonel. He was one of Wellington’s\r\nbest-trusted subordinates, and his personal friend, but being very\r\nyoung, and junior in rank to all heads of departments, he was in no\r\nsense an appreciable factor in Wellington’s conduct of the war. In\r\nfact, he was nothing more than his title of secretary indicated, and\r\nwas in no way responsible for organization, or entitled to offer advice.\r\n\r\nMuch more important were the two great heads of departments, the\r\nQuartermaster-General and Adjutant-General. The former was charged\r\nwith all matters relating to the embarkation or disembarkation,\r\nthe equipment, quartering, halting, encamping, and route-marching\r\nof the various units of the army. He had to convey to all generals\r\nin command of them the orders of the general-in-chief, and for\r\nthis purpose had under his control a number of officers bearing\r\nthe clumsy titles of assistant-quartermaster-generals, and\r\ndeputy-assistant-quartermaster-generals. Of the former there were\r\nfive, of the latter seven, when the army was first organized in April,\r\n1809, but their numbers were continually increasing all through the\r\nwar, for each unit had an assistant-quartermaster-general and a\r\ndeputy-assistant-quartermaster-general attached to it, and as the\r\ndivisions and brigades grew in number, so did the officers of the\r\nQuartermaster-General’s department told off to them. There was also a\r\nparallel growth in the number of those who remained at headquarters,\r\ndirectly attached to their chief.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting minute by Wellington, laying down the relations\r\nbetween the divisional generals and the staff-officers of the\r\ndepartment: he points out that, though the latter are the organs of\r\nheadquarters in dealing with divisions, yet they are under the command\r\nof the divisional general: and the responsibility both for the orders\r\ngiven through them being carried out, and for their acts in general,\r\nlies with the division-commander. “Every staff officer,” he says, “must\r\nbe considered as acting under the direct orders and superintendence of\r\nthe superior officer for whose assistance he is employed, and who is\r\nresponsible for his acts. To consider the relative situation of the\r\ngeneral officer and the staff officer in any other light, would tend to\r\nalter the nature of the Service, and, in fact, might give the command\r\nof the troops to a subaltern staff officer instead of to their general\r\nofficer.”[133]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Quartermaster-General]\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Quartermaster-General’s department, besides their\r\nduties with regard to the moving of the army, or the detachments\r\nof it, had often to undertake independent work at a distance from\r\nheadquarters, and sometimes remote from the theatre of war. It was\r\nthey who made topographical surveys, reports on roads and bridges, and\r\non the resources of districts through which the army might have to\r\nmove in the near or distant future. There was issued early in 1810 a\r\nlittle manual called _Instructions for the officers in the department\r\nof the Quartermaster-General_ which was given to all its members: it\r\ncontains a selection of orders and forms, relating to every possible\r\nduty with which its recipients might be entrusted. The most interesting\r\nsection is that on topographical surveys, to which there is annexed\r\na model report of the road from Truxillo to Merida, containing notes\r\non everything which a staff officer ought to notice,—positions,\r\ndefiles, size of villages, character of sections of the road, amount\r\nof corn-land as opposed to pasture or waste, warnings as to unhealthy\r\nspots, notes as to the depth of rivers and the practicability of fords,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can ascertain, Wellington had only two\r\nQuartermaster-Generals during the whole of the long period of his\r\nsupreme command. Colonel George Murray of the 3rd Guards held the post\r\nfrom April, 1809, to May 28, 1812: he must be carefully distinguished\r\nfrom two other Murrays, who sometimes turn up in the dispatches.\r\nOne is Major-General John Murray, who commanded a brigade in the\r\nOporto campaign, went home because he considered that Beresford had\r\nbeen unjustly promoted over his head, and came out later to the\r\nPeninsula on the Catalan side, where he was responsible for the\r\nmismanaged operations about Tarragona. The other is John Murray, the\r\nCommissary-General. When Wellington sometimes uses such a phrase in his\r\ndispatches as “Murray knows this,” or “see that Murray is informed,”\r\nit is often most difficult to be sure which of the three men is meant.\r\nEarly in 1811 Colonel George Murray became a major-general, and in\r\nthe following May he appears to have gone home. He was replaced as\r\nQuartermaster-General by Colonel James Gordon—who, again, must not be\r\nconfused with Colonel Sir Alexander Gordon, who was one of Wellington’s\r\nsenior aides-de-camp, and was killed at Waterloo. This is another of\r\nthe confusions between homonyms which often give trouble. If a diarist\r\nspeaks of “Colonel Gordon” we have to find which of the two is meant.\r\nJames Gordon, having acted as quartermaster-general from May, 1811, to\r\nJanuary, 1813, went home, and George Murray, returning early in that\r\nyear, worked out the remaining fifteen months of the war in his old\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Adjutant-General]\r\n\r\nParallel with the Quartermaster-General was the other great\r\ndepartmental chief at headquarters, the Adjutant-General, whose sphere\r\nof activity was disciplinary and statistical. He was charged with\r\nall the detail of duties to be distributed, with the collecting and\r\ncompiling for the use of the commander-in-chief of all returns of men\r\nand horses in “morning states,” etc., with the supreme supervision of\r\nthe discipline of the army, and with much official correspondence that\r\ndid not pass to the Military Secretary. Roughly speaking, the internal\r\ncondition of the troops fell to his share, while their movement\r\nbelonged to the Quartermaster-General. He had to aid him on the first\r\norganization of the army in 1809, eight assistant-adjutant-generals\r\nand six deputy-assistant-adjutant-generals, but (as in the\r\nQuartermaster-General’s department) the number of subordinates mounted\r\nup, as the war went on, and new units were from time to time created,\r\nsince an assistant-adjutant-general was attached to each division.\r\n\r\nThe first holder of the office was Major-General the Hon. Charles\r\nStewart (afterwards Lord Londonderry, the earliest historian of the\r\nPeninsular War), who was discharging its functions from April, 1809,\r\ntill April, 1813, just four years. He was then sent on a diplomatic\r\nmission to Berlin, and Wellington offered the post to his own\r\nbrother-in-law, Major-General Edward Pakenham, who, while in charge of\r\nthe 3rd division, had made the decisive charge at Salamanca. Pakenham\r\nwas adjutant-general for the last year of the war, April, 1813, to\r\nApril, 1814, and went straight out from Bordeaux to command the unlucky\r\nNew Orleans expedition, in which he lost his life.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that Wellington had actually only two\r\nQuartermaster-Generals and two Adjutant-Generals under him during the\r\nfive years of his Peninsular command—a sufficient proof that when he\r\nhad found his man he stuck to him. Charles Stewart, who served him\r\nso long, was a person of some political importance, as the brother\r\nand confidant of Lord Castlereagh. In the early part of his tenure of\r\noffice he seems sometimes to have made suggestions to his chief, but\r\nmet little encouragement, for Wellington loved his own way, and was not\r\nto be influenced even by his own highest staff officers.[134] He did\r\nnot wish to have a Gneisenau or a Moltke at his side: he only wanted\r\nzealous and competent chief clerks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minor Heads of Departments]\r\n\r\nAttached to headquarters in addition to the three great functionaries\r\nalready named, were the heads of several other departments of great\r\nimportance. These were—\r\n\r\n(1) The general officer commanding the Royal Artillery, who had a\r\ngeneral supervisory charge of the batteries attached to the divisions,\r\nand a more specific control of the battering-train and reserve\r\nartillery, when these came into existence in 1811, as well as of the\r\nammunition columns. The first artillery chief was Brigadier-General\r\nE. Howarth, who arrived at Lisbon in 1809, about the same time as\r\nWellington himself. He was promoted major-general in 1811, and went\r\nhome that year. The command then went through a rapid succession of\r\nhands. Howarth was followed by Major-General Borthwick, who apparently\r\ncrossed Wellington, and went home in March, 1812, after less than\r\na year’s tenure of the post. Borthwick was succeeded by Colonel H.\r\nFramingham, and he within a few months by Colonel G. B. Fisher, who\r\n(like Borthwick) fell out with the commander-in-chief, and applied for\r\nleave to go home ere 1813 was six months old. Wellington then appointed\r\nColonel Alexander Dickson to the command late in May. This officer had\r\nbeen for the last two years in charge of the Portuguese artillery under\r\nBeresford. He had given such satisfaction at Rodrigo and Badajoz that\r\nWellington re-transferred him to the British service, and finished the\r\ncampaign of 1814 with Dickson in chief charge of this branch.\r\n\r\n(2) After the artillery chief we encounter as a prominent figure at\r\nheadquarters the commanding officer of Royal Engineers. He had the\r\nsuperintending duty over his own staff and the engineer officers\r\nattached to the divisions, and control over the “Royal Military\r\nArtificers,” as the rank and file of the scientific corps were\r\nnamed till 1812, when they changed their title to Royal Sappers\r\nand Miners.[135] The commanding engineer had also charge over the\r\nengineers’ park and the pontoon train. The officer who held this post\r\nfrom 1809 till he was killed at St. Sebastian in September, 1813,\r\nwas Colonel Richard Fletcher, who has left a fame behind him as the\r\ndesigner of the Lines of Torres Vedras. On his death the command fell\r\nto Lieut.-Colonel Elphinstone, who was responsible for the celebrated\r\nbridge of boats across the mouth of the Adour which made the siege of\r\nBayonne possible in 1814.\r\n\r\n(3, 4) At headquarters were also to be found the officers commanding\r\nthe Staff Corps Cavalry, and the Corps of Guides. The former, a small\r\nunit of some 200 men, created in 1812, discharged the police duties of\r\nthe army, and were worked along with the Provost Marshal. They were\r\noccasionally also employed as orderlies, and in other confidential\r\npositions.[136] The Guides were a small body also, some 150 or 200\r\nstrong, partly British, partly Portuguese, the latter preponderating.\r\nThey were detached in twos or threes, to act as interpreters as well\r\nas guides to bodies of troops moving in country not known to them.\r\nFor this reason they had to be bilingual, either English knowing some\r\nPortuguese, or Portuguese knowing some English, as they had always to\r\nbe acting as intermediaries between the army and the peasantry, in\r\nmaking inquiries about roads, supplies, etc. The officer commanding the\r\nGuides had also the charge of the post office, and the transmission of\r\nletters to and from the front.\r\n\r\n(5) The Provost Marshal was also attached to headquarters: he had\r\ncharge of all prisoners to be tried by general court-martial, of\r\ndeserters, and prisoners of war. He had powers of jurisdiction on\r\noffenders caught red-handed, but as Wellington remarks, “Whatever may\r\nbe the crime of which a soldier is guilty, the Provost Marshal has not\r\nthe power of inflicting summary punishment for it, unless he should\r\nsee him in the act of committing it.”[137] Men arrested on evidence\r\nonly, had to be tried by court-martials. For the better management of\r\nthese last, Wellington added a Judge-Advocate-General to his staff in\r\n1812, whose duty was to see that trials were conducted with proper\r\nforms and due appreciation of the validity of evidence—in which the\r\ncommander-in-chief considered that they had often failed. Mr. Francis\r\nLarpent, who has left an interesting diary of his duties and his\r\npersonal adventures, discharged the function of this office from his\r\narrival late in 1812 down to the end of the war.[138]\r\n\r\nAs to aides-de-camp, Wellington kept a very limited number of them—he\r\nonly employed some twenty in the course of the war, and not more than\r\neight or ten at once. They were nearly all young men of the great\r\npolitical families,[139] nearly half of them were Guards’ officers, and\r\nthe rest mostly belonged to the cavalry. The Prince of Orange served\r\namong them in 1811–12. None of them, save Lord Fitzroy Somerset (Lord\r\nRaglan) and Colonel Cadogan, came to any very great military position\r\nor reputation.\r\n\r\nSo much for the military side of headquarters. There were also attached\r\nto it seven civil departments, small and great, of which it may be\r\nwell to give a list. On one or two of these we shall have to speak at\r\nsome length in later chapters—notably the Commissariat and the Medical\r\ndepartment. They consisted of—\r\n\r\n(1) The Medical Department under an Inspector of Hospitals, who was in\r\ngeneral charge of the physicians, surgeons, assistants, etc., attached\r\nto the various units of the army. There is an excellent account of\r\nthe management of this department, and all its difficulties, in the\r\n_Autobiography_ of Sir James McGrigor, chief of the Medical Staff in\r\n1812–13–14. His predecessor since Wellington’s first landing in 1809\r\nwas Dr. Frank, who was invalided in the autumn of 1811.\r\n\r\n(2) The Purveyor’s Department was independent of the medical, though it\r\nmight well have been attached to it: the establishment consisted of a\r\nPurveyor to the Forces, with deputies and assistants, who had charge of\r\nthe hospitals and all the material and details required for them—from\r\nthe drugs for the sick to the burial expenses of the dead.\r\n\r\n(3) The Paymaster-General, with his assistants, was responsible for the\r\ntransmission of the money received to the regimental paymasters of the\r\nvarious units. He was a much-worried man, generally from three to six\r\nmonths in arrears with his specie, from no fault of his own, but from\r\nthe immense difficulty of obtaining the hard dollars, doubloons, and\r\n“cruzados novos,” which alone had currency in the Peninsula till a late\r\nperiod in the war. It was useless to issue English money to the troops,\r\nfor the natives would not accept crowns and guineas, and refused even\r\nto look at the one-pound notes which were almost the sole circulating\r\nmedium in Great Britain during this period. It was only in a late year\r\nof the war that the gold guinea was at last tariffed by the Spanish and\r\nPortuguese Governments, and became readily current.[140]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Commissariat]\r\n\r\n(4) Most important of all the Civil Departments was the\r\nCommissariat, under the Commissary-General, who had\r\nunder him Deputy-Commissary-Generals, Assistant and\r\nDeputy-Assistant-Commissaries, Commissariat Clerks, and many other\r\nsubordinates. The department was divided into two branches, stores and\r\naccounts. The post of Commissary-General was successively held by John\r\nMurray (already mentioned above) from 1809 to June, 1810, by Kennedy\r\nfrom June, 1810, to September, 1811, and by Bisset from September,\r\n1811, onward. An assistant commissary was attached to each brigade of\r\ninfantry and each regiment of cavalry, but a single official had to\r\nattend to the needs of the whole of the artillery with the army, and\r\nanother to the needs of headquarters.[141]\r\n\r\nThe whole future of the army in 1809 depended on whether the\r\nCommissariat Department would be able to rise to the height of its\r\nduties. It was absolutely necessary that Wellington should be able to\r\nkeep his army concentrated, if this small force of 20,000 or 30,000\r\nmen was to be of any weight in the conduct of the war in the Peninsula.\r\nThe much-cursed and criticized Commissariat succeeded in doing its\r\nduty, and the length of time for which the British army could keep\r\nconcentrated was the envy of the French, who, living on the country,\r\nwere forced to disperse whenever they had exhausted the resources of\r\nthe particular region in which they were massed. In a way this fact was\r\nthe key to the whole war. Wellington’s salvation lay in the fact that\r\nhe could hold his entire army together, while his adversaries could\r\nnot. On this advantage he relied again and again: his whole strategy\r\ndepended upon it. How the Commissariat worked we shall show in a later\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n(5) The Storekeeper-General had charge of the field equipments, tents,\r\nand heavy baggage of the army. Often the heavy baggage was left at\r\nLisbon, and all through 1809–10–11 no tents were taken to the front. It\r\nwas only in the Vittoria and South-French campaigns that the whole army\r\nregularly carried them. In the days when the transport trains were not\r\nfully organized, it was necessary to leave even valuable impedimenta\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n(6) To the Controller of Army Accounts all departments, save the\r\nCommissariat, rendered their statistics of money received and spent.\r\n\r\n(7) Last, we may name the Press, for a travelling Press and a small\r\nstaff of military printers accompanied the headquarters when possible,\r\nand printed general orders, and other documents and forms, of which\r\nmany copies were required. I have seen much of its work at the Record\r\nOffice,[142] but have never come across an account of its organization,\r\nor of any anecdotes of its wandering life, in which it must have passed\r\nthrough many vicissitudes. The press was under the general supervision\r\nof the Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF THE ARMY: BRIGADES AND DIVISIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will probably surprise some readers to learn that Sir Arthur\r\nWellesley fought out the first campaign in which he held supreme\r\ncommand, that of Oporto in May, 1809, with no higher organized unit\r\nthan the brigade. But this is the fact: the 18,000 infantry of which\r\nhe could dispose were distributed into eight brigades of two or three\r\nbattalions each, varying in strength from 1400 up to 2500 bayonets. But\r\nWellesley was not so belated, in failing to form divisions, as might\r\nbe thought. They were still rather an abnormal than a usual unit for a\r\nBritish army: indeed, in the large majority of the expeditions in which\r\nGreat Britain had been engaged since 1793, the numbers were so small\r\nthat no unit above the brigade had been necessary. But it is notable\r\nthat neither in the Duke of York’s first expedition to the Netherlands\r\nin 1793–94, nor in his second in 1799, nor in Abercrombie’s Egyptian\r\nCampaign of 1801 had divisions been formed—though in each of these\r\ncases a very large force had been assembled. When several brigades\r\nacted together, not under the immediate eye of the commander-in-chief,\r\nthe senior brigadier present took temporary charge of the assemblage.\r\nIn the Low Countries York generally speaks of his army as being\r\ndivided into “columns” of two or three brigades each,[143] but there\r\nwas no fixity in the arrangement. Abercrombie, on the other hand,\r\nin the last dispatch which he wrote before his victory and death at\r\nAlexandria, lays down the theoretical organization that the army is to\r\nbe considered as being divided into three “lines”—the first composed\r\nof three brigades, the second and third of two each. If the _word_\r\ndivision is used in any official documents of these campaigns, the\r\nterm has no technical military sense, but is used as a vague synonym\r\nfor a section or part of the army.[144] Indeed, so far as I know, the\r\nfirst British force during the great French War which was formed into\r\ndivisions, in the proper modern sense, was the army which went on the\r\nCopenhagen Expedition of 1807, which was regularly distributed into\r\nfour of such units, each under a lieutenant-general, and each composed\r\nof two, three, or four weak brigades, generally of only two battalions.\r\nThis was a force of some 26,000 men.\r\n\r\nThe original Peninsular Army of 1808, which landed at the mouth of the\r\nMondego, and won the battle of Vimeiro, was not far, therefore, from\r\nbeing the first British force organized in divisions. It may be noted\r\nthat they were rather theoretical than real, for several brigades\r\nhad not yet landed when Vimeiro was fought, and Wellesley, while in\r\ntemporary command, worked the incomplete army on a brigade system:\r\nno trace whatever of the use of the divisions as real units will be\r\nfound in that battle. Indeed, even the theoretical composition of\r\nsome of the brigades differed from that actually seen in action. No\r\ngenuine divisions were formed in the Peninsula, till Sir John Moore\r\ntook command of the army from which its old chiefs, Dalrymple, Burrand\r\nand Wellesley himself had been removed and sent home. We must not,\r\ntherefore, be surprised to find that for three months after he landed\r\nat Lisbon in April, 1809, Wellesley worked his 21,000 British troops in\r\ndetached brigades, only connected in a formal and temporary way, under\r\nthe senior brigadier, when two or more chanced to form a marching or\r\nfighting unit.\r\n\r\nBut two other points concerning Wellesley’s Oporto campaign deserve\r\nnotice. This was the first and only occasion on which he tried the\r\nexperiment of mixing British and Portuguese regiments in the same\r\nbrigade.[145] To five of the eight brigades forming his infantry a\r\nPortuguese battalion was attached, picked as being one of the best\r\nof the rather disorderly assembly which Beresford had collected at\r\nAbrantes and Thomar. Though the Portuguese fought not amiss during\r\nthis short campaign, and are mentioned with praise in Wellesley’s\r\ndispatches, yet the experiment was not continued, evidently because it\r\nwas found not to work happily. The five Portuguese battalions were sent\r\nback to Beresford not long after the fall of Oporto.\r\n\r\nThe other point to be noted in considering Wellesley’s organization\r\nof his army in the Oporto campaign, is that already he had begun the\r\nsystem of strengthening his skirmishers by the addition to them of a\r\nrifle company per brigade, all taken from the 5/60th. The importance of\r\nthis arrangement in the general scheme of his tactics has been already\r\nexplained in an earlier chapter.[146]\r\n\r\nSo much for Wellesley’s first organization of his army. It did not\r\nendure for so much as three months, for on June 18, 1809, a General\r\nOrder, dated from the Adjutant-General’s office at Abrantes, gave to\r\nthe army the organization in divisions, under which it was to win all\r\nits subsequent victories. In the midst of some insignificant directions\r\nas to forage and ammunition, appears the clause that “as the weather\r\nnow admits of the troops hutting, and they can move together in large\r\nbodies, brigades can be formed into divisions, as follows.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Original Four Divisions]\r\n\r\nThe original disposition was for four divisions only, of which the\r\nfirst consisted of four brigades, the other three of two brigades each.\r\nAll the battalions in them were in the British service, no Portuguese\r\nbeing included. The four line battalions of the King’s German Legion\r\nwere arranged first as one, and then as two brigades of the First\r\nDivision. Of the ten brigades into which the infantry of the army were\r\nnow divided, seven had two battalions only, the other three three\r\nbattalions each. The cavalry, which had recently been increased by the\r\narrival of two regiments from England, was organized as a division of\r\nthree brigades of two regiments each. The artillery, of which only five\r\nfield batteries (or “companies” as they were then called) had reached\r\nthe front, was not yet told off to the individual divisions in a\r\npermanent fashion, though certain units are generally found acting with\r\nthe same division.\r\n\r\nAs to the command of the divisions, Wellington contemplated that\r\neach should ultimately be in the charge of a lieutenant-general; but\r\nas he had only three officers of such rank at his disposition—Hill,\r\nSherbrooke, and the cavalry commander Payne—the General Order directs\r\nthat “the senior general officers of brigades will respectively take\r\nthe command of the division in which their brigades are placed, till\r\nother lieutenant-generals shall join the army.” This placed two\r\nbrigadiers, McKenzie and A. Campbell, in temporary charge of the\r\n3rd and 4th divisions, Sherbrooke taking the 1st, and Hill the 2nd.\r\nSherbrooke went home before a year was out, but Hill was to remain\r\nin command of the 2nd division throughout the war, except during the\r\nshort periods when he was on leave. But during his last three years\r\nin the Peninsula, when he was practically acting as commander of\r\nan army corps, the 2nd division was, in fact, under the leadership\r\nof William Stewart as his substitute. The only modification caused\r\nin internal organization by the creation of the new divisions was\r\nthat an assistant-adjutant-general, and quartermaster-general, and a\r\nprovost-marshal were attached to each of them, and that the brigadiers\r\nacting as division-commanders were authorized to take on some extra\r\naides-de-camp.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rearrangements after Talavera]\r\n\r\nIt was with this organization that Wellington’s army went through the\r\nTalavera campaign, and the retreat to the Guadiana which terminated\r\nit. The whole force was British, no single Portuguese battalion\r\naccompanying it. The troops of that nation were being employed under\r\nBeresford during this summer, to cover the frontier of Beira, between\r\nthe Douro and the Tagus. Long before the campaign was over, more\r\nBritish reinforcements had begun to arrive at Lisbon, and had been\r\npushed forward some distance into the interior. One brigade, that\r\ncomposed of the three light battalions,[147] under Robert Craufurd,\r\nafterwards to be famous in Peninsular annals as the nucleus of the\r\n“Light Division,” got to the front after a tremendous march—somewhat\r\nexaggerated by Napier and by tradition—only a day after the battle\r\nof Talavera. Wellesley incorporated it for a movement in the 3rd\r\ndivision, in which it finished the campaign. There were seven other\r\nbattalions[148] which did not get so far forward, and ultimately\r\njoined Beresford’s Portuguese on the frontier of Spain. In September\r\nWellington drew down these troops to join him in Estremadura, and made\r\nfrom them a third brigade each for his 2nd and 4th Divisions. But there\r\nwas about this time a shifting about of battalions from division to\r\ndivision, which it would be tedious to give in detail. The net result\r\nwas that at the end of 1809 Wellington had four much stronger divisions\r\nthan he had possessed in the summer, the 1st counting nine battalions\r\ninstead of its old eight, the 2nd ten instead of six, the 3rd still\r\nsix, but the 4th eight instead of five.\r\n\r\nThe early months of 1810 were spent by Wellington in an expectant\r\nattitude, behind the Portuguese frontier, as he waited for the\r\ninevitable French invasion under Masséna, so long announced and so long\r\ndelayed. In this time of long-deferred anxiety, while the Lines of\r\nTorres Vedras were being busily urged towards completion, Wellington\r\ncarried out some most important changes in the organization of his\r\narmy, which made it (except in the matter of mere numbers) exactly what\r\nit was to remain till the end of the war.\r\n\r\nThe most notable of these changes was that he made up his mind to\r\nrevert to his old plan of April, 1809, for mixing the Portuguese\r\nand British troops. It took a new form, however: instead of placing\r\nbattalions of each nationality side by side in his brigades, he\r\nattached a Portuguese brigade of four or five battalions to most of\r\nhis British divisions, as a distinct unit. This system was started\r\nwith the 3rd and 4th Divisions on Feb. 22, 1810. A complete Portuguese\r\nbrigade consisted of two line regiments (each of two battalions) and\r\none caçador or rifle battalion. The latter was always employed for the\r\nbrigade’s skirmishing work; when joined by the four light companies of\r\nthe line battalions, it gave a very heavy proportion of light troops to\r\nthe unit. This Wellington considered necessary, because of the untried\r\nquality of the whole Portuguese Army, which had not yet taken a serious\r\npart in any general action. In the autumn they justified Wellington’s\r\nconfidence in them at the battle of Bussaco, where all of them, and\r\nespecially the two caçador battalions attached to the Light Division,\r\nplayed a most creditable part.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Light Division]\r\n\r\nThe second great innovation made in the spring of 1810 was the creation\r\nof the celebrated Light Division, which came into existence on Feb.\r\n22, 1810; it was formed by taking Robert Craufurd’s brigade, the\r\n1/43rd, 1/52nd, and 1/95th out of the 3rd division, and adding to them\r\nthe above-mentioned two Portuguese caçador battalions. Wellington’s\r\ndesign was to produce for the whole army, by the institution of this\r\nnew unit, what he had already done for the individual brigades when\r\nhe added their rifle companies to them in April, 1809. The Light\r\nDivision was to be, as it were, the protective screen for the whole\r\narmy,—its strategical skirmishing line, thrown out far in front of the\r\nrest of the host, to keep off the French till the actual moment of\r\nbattle, and to hide the dispositions of the main body. At the head of\r\nthis small corps of picked light troops was placed Robert Craufurd,\r\nwhom Wellington rightly considered his best officer for outpost and\r\nreconnaissance work. How well this trusted subordinate discharged\r\nthe duty laid upon him has been told in the chapter dealing with his\r\ncharacter and exploits. All through the war Wellington used the Light\r\nDivision as his screen, for his advanced guard when he was moving to\r\nthe front, for his rearguard when he was on the retreat, and he was\r\nnever betrayed by it, even after Craufurd’s death had left its conduct\r\nin the hands of chiefs who were not always men of special ability.\r\n\r\nAfter the creation of the Light Division, Wellington had five instead\r\nof four divisions, and another was added to them in the summer of\r\n1810, when in August he created the 5th Division, so long commanded by\r\nGeneral Leith. This was formed by adding to a British brigade, newly\r\narrived from England,[149] two of the hitherto unattached Portuguese\r\nbrigades. A second British brigade was provided in October for Leith,\r\nfrom troops newly come from Cadiz.[150] These having come to hand, the\r\n5th Division dropped one of its Portuguese brigades, and became a unit\r\nof the normal shape and size, two-thirds British, one-third Portuguese.\r\nIt did not, however, receive its caçador battalion (drawn from the\r\nLusitanian Legion) till 1811.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign of Bussaco, therefore, Wellington had six\r\ndivisions—the old ones numbered 1st to 4th, the Light Division, and\r\nthe newly-created 5th. In addition to the Portuguese brigades which\r\nhad now been absorbed into the divisions, there remained six more\r\nbrigades of that nation which were still unattached. Of these two,\r\nunder the Brigadiers Archibald Campbell and Fonseca, were formed into a\r\ndivision under General Hamilton, which always marched with Hill’s 2nd\r\nDivision, but was never formally made part of it. But since Hamilton\r\ninvariably moved along with Hill, this pair of units, with their ten\r\nBritish and eight Portuguese battalions, practically formed a double\r\ndivision, or a small army corps, if a term which Wellington never\r\nused in the Peninsula may be applied to it.[151] There remained four\r\nmore independent Portuguese brigades, those of Pack, Alex. Campbell,\r\nColeman, and Bradford. By the next year these were reduced to two, as\r\none brigade was withdrawn to serve with the new British 7th division,\r\nand another with the 2nd. The surviving units continued as unattached\r\nbrigades till the end of the war, under a series of commanding\r\nofficers, whose succession is sometimes hard to follow.[152] They often\r\naccompanied the main army, but were sometimes separated from it for\r\nspecial duties, when some force less than a division was wanted, as a\r\ndetachment for a subsidiary operation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Creation of the 6th and 7th Divisions]\r\n\r\nThe completion of the Peninsular Army in its final shape, which was not\r\nagain to be varied, took place during its stay by the Lines of Torres\r\nVedras, in the winter of 1810–11. It was then that the two junior\r\ndivisions were created, the 6th in October, the 7th early in March.\r\nTheir appearance in the field was, of course, due to the arrival of a\r\nconsiderable number of fresh battalions from England during the autumn\r\nand winter. But Wellington did not take all the new-comers and build up\r\nfresh divisions from them. The 6th Division was made by taking an old\r\nbrigade (Archibald Campbell’s) from the 4th Division, and uniting it\r\nto the extra Portuguese brigade of the 5th Division.[153] The second\r\nBritish brigade of the 6th division was provided some months later\r\nfrom newly-arrived troops from England.[154] The 4th Division was\r\ncompensated for the brigade it had given to the 6th by taking over a\r\nbrigade (Pakenham’s) from the 1st Division—while the 1st Division, to\r\nreplace this last unit, received three battalions[155] which had just\r\ncome out from home.\r\n\r\nThis was a complicated shift and transfer, intended to secure a level\r\nquality in the divisions by the mixture of recently arrived and veteran\r\nbattalions. But in organizing his last creation, the 7th Division,\r\nWellington was prevented by circumstances from carrying out the same\r\nwise plan. Much belated in their arrival at Lisbon by contrary winds,\r\nthe last batch of reinforcements sent to him for the campaign of 1811,\r\nlanded when the main army was already in pursuit of Masséna, who had\r\njust started on his retreat from Santarem. Wellington was forced to\r\nkeep them together, since he had no time to distribute them when the\r\ntroops were all on the move. The 7th division was at first very weak,\r\ncontaining only one brigade in British pay, consisting of two English\r\nand two foreign corps,[156] and one Portuguese brigade (Coleman).\r\nTwo more foreign corps belonging to the German Legion[157] formed\r\nthe second brigade of the 7th Division, but did not join it till the\r\nsummer, being distracted meanwhile to another field of operations.\r\n\r\nThe 7th Division was for some time looked on as the “ugly duckling,”\r\nor backward child of the army. Having only two British to four foreign\r\nbattalions, it was sometimes called “the Mongrels;” its first début\r\nin action at Fuentes de Oñoro was not a very happy one, as it was\r\nthe outlying flank force that was turned and partly cut up by French\r\ncavalry. After this it was never seriously engaged in battle for more\r\nthan a year. Moreover, its foreigners earned a bad reputation for their\r\nhabit of desertion—a habit not altogether unnatural, for they had been\r\nlargely recruited from the pontoons and prison-camps in England.[158]\r\nHence a cruel joke in the list of divisional nicknames given by\r\nseveral Peninsular diarists. The sobriquets run: Light Division, _The_\r\nDivision; no doubt the title given to it by its own proud members.\r\nFirst Division: “The Gentlemen’s Sons,” because it contained one,\r\nand afterwards two, brigades of the Foot Guards. The Second Division\r\nis called “the Observing Division,” because it was so often detached\r\nas a containing force against Soult, on the side of Estremadura and\r\nAndalusia, while the main body was more actively engaged on the side\r\nof Leon. So much was this its duty that it was only present at one\r\ngeneral action, Albuera, between the autumn of 1810 and the summer of\r\n1813. There were some brilliant episodes between those dates, such\r\nas the surprise of Arroyo dos Molinos, and the storming of the forts\r\nat Almaraz. The 3rd Division was called “the Fighting Division,” its\r\nfiery leader, Picton, having led it into the forefront of the battle\r\nboth at Bussaco and Fuentes de Oñoro, not to speak of smaller fights\r\nlike Redinha or El Bodon; it had also done the hardest of work at the\r\nstorms of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz. The 4th Division was called the\r\n“Supporting Division;” I suppose because it was sent off to support\r\nthe 2nd in Estremadura, and most effectually discharged that duty\r\nat Albuera.[159] The 5th division was called “the Pioneers,” a name\r\nwhose source I cannot explain: possibly it refers to some road-making\r\nwork done in 1810. The 6th was the “Marching Division,” mainly, I\r\nbelieve, so-called because down to Salamanca it was accompanying all\r\nWellington’s great movements from north to south and south to north,\r\nyet never had the good fortune to get into the thick of the battle. At\r\nSalamanca, however, it had as much fighting as any man could crave.\r\nThe note to the 7th Division, however, is very malicious, being “We\r\nhave _heard_ that there is a Seventh Division, but we have never\r\n_seen_ it.” The fact is, that after its mishap at Fuentes, and some\r\nunsuccessful siege work at the second leaguer of Badajoz, this unit was\r\nvery little engaged for two years. In 1813, however, it was gloriously\r\nprominent in the battles of the Pyrenees, and the dash at the French\r\nline, made by Barns’s brigade, was called by Wellington about the best\r\nand most effective attack that he had ever seen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rearrangement of Units]\r\n\r\nAfter the creation of the 7th Division in March, 1811, Wellington never\r\nagain organized a new divisional unit. He received, of course, a great\r\nnumber of new battalions during the years 1811–12–13, but contented\r\nhimself with adding them in ones or twos to existing brigades, or at\r\nmost gave two or three of them as a fresh brigade to one of the old\r\ndivisions. The former practice was the more usual: the only instances\r\nof the latter that I recall being that in 1812 the 1st Division got a\r\nsecond Guards brigade, and in 1813 a new line brigade (Lord Aylmer’s)\r\nfrom reinforcements that had just come out. The increase of the total\r\nnumber of battalions at the front was not so great as might have been\r\nexpected, because from time to time corps that had got thinned down\r\nalmost to the point of extinction, were sent back to England to be\r\nrecruited and reorganized. The number of British battalions (including\r\nthe King’s German Legion and two other foreign corps) with Wellington’s\r\nfield army in March, 1811, was fifty-eight; in March, 1814, it was no\r\nmore than sixty-five, a gain of only seven units. There had been a\r\nconsiderable exchange of service between the 1st and 2nd battalion of\r\nregiments—in several cases when the 2nd battalion had been the original\r\nunit in the Peninsular Army, it went home when the first battalion\r\ncame out, returning as a mere _cadre_ of officers and sergeants, after\r\nturning over its serviceable rank and file to the newly-arrived sister\r\nunit.[160]\r\n\r\nThere was only two more considerable rearrangements of the internal\r\norganization of a division. One took place in May, 1811, owing to the\r\nfearful losses suffered by the 2nd Division at Albuera. Of the seven\r\nbattalions forming the brigades of Colborne and Hoghton, which had\r\nbeen so dreadfully mauled in holding the all-important heights, two\r\nwere sent home, and the four others shrank into a single brigade. To\r\nfill the place of the vanished unit a whole brigade (Howard’s) was\r\ntransferred from the 1st to the 2nd Division, and became part of it for\r\nthe rest of the war. There was also a shifting about of two brigades\r\nfrom one unit to another during the winter of 1812–13, after the Burgos\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nThe normal divisional organization, however, remained unchanged from\r\n1811 onwards, viz. with three exceptions, each division for the\r\nremaining three years of the war consisted of two British brigades\r\nand one Portuguese, the former having usually three battalions each,\r\nand the latter five. This rule worked for the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th,\r\n7th divisions. The Light Division, smaller than the rest, had only\r\nthree (or three and a half) British battalions, and two of Portuguese\r\ncaçadores. The 1st Division alone had no Portuguese attached, but one\r\nof its three (after 1813 _four_) brigades was foreign, consisting of\r\nthe line battalions of the King’s German Legion. The 2nd Division (as\r\nexplained above) had three British brigades and no Portuguese, but to\r\nit was attached Hamilton’s (and in 1812–14 Ashworth’s) Portuguese, so\r\nthat it did not vary from the normal arrangement so much as the 1st\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\nIt would not be quite accurate to say that a British brigade always\r\nhad precisely three battalions. Several had four, one five, a few\r\nappeared with only two, but Wellington generally made these last up to\r\nthe three-battalion total as soon as he was able, save in two cases.\r\nIn the Guards brigades of the 1st Division the two battalions were\r\nalways so strong that between them they gave 1800 or 2000 bayonets at\r\nthe beginning of a campaign—which was as much as most three-battalion\r\nbrigades produced. Moreover, there was an objection to brigading\r\ntogether units of the Guards and of the line. In the Light Division the\r\n1/43rd and 1/52nd were also very strong and well recruited: each formed\r\nthe nucleus of a small brigade, of which the rest was composed of a\r\nPortuguese caçador battalion and a certain number (often six) companies\r\nof the 95th Rifles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Anglo-Portuguese Division]\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, then, an Anglo-Portuguese division usually amounted\r\nto something under 6000 men, save the Light Division, which numbered\r\nunder 4000, and the 1st Division, which in 1810, and again in 1813,\r\nhad four brigades, and over 7000 men. Of the 5500 or 5800 men in one\r\nof the normal divisions about 3500 were British and 2000 (or a little\r\nmore) Portuguese. The 2nd Division, however, was a double-unit, with\r\n5500 British, and attached to it 6500 of Hamilton’s and Ashworth’s\r\nPortuguese.\r\n\r\nThe mixture of nationalities in the divisions, normal with the\r\ninfantry, was nearly unknown in the cavalry arm. The very few\r\nPortuguese regiments which took the field—never more than seven, I\r\nbelieve—often four only—were normally kept separate. Wellington, for\r\nthe first three years of the war, had so few cavalry regiments of\r\neither nation that there was no possibility of dividing them into\r\ndivisions. In 1809, as has been already stated,[161] there were only in\r\nthe Peninsula six British cavalry regiments, divided into three weak\r\nbrigades. Only one more corps joined them in 1810, and in the spring\r\ncampaigns of 1811, when he had left three regiments with Beresford in\r\nthe south, he had only four to take with him for the pursuit of Masséna\r\nand the battle of Fuentes de Oñoro—a miserable provision—1500 sabres\r\nfor an army of over 30,000 men, about a fourth of the proper proportion\r\nin those days.\r\n\r\nIt was not till later in 1811 that Wellington got cavalry\r\nreinforcements which more than doubled his mounted strength, bringing\r\nhim up to fifteen regiments of British and German horse. He did then at\r\nlast divide them into two divisions, one of eleven regiments, which\r\nfollowed his main army, the other of four regiments only, which he left\r\nwith Hill in Estremadura. But no Portuguese regiments were put into\r\neither—though he took one brigade with himself (D’Urban’s) for the\r\nSalamanca campaign, and left two brigades (or four regiments) with the\r\nsouthern force (those of Otway and Madden).\r\n\r\nBut the organization in two cavalry divisions was dropped in the spring\r\nof 1813—Wellington had had sickening experience of the incapacity of\r\nGeneral Erskine, who commanded the small second division, and, Erskine\r\nbeing now dead, for the rest of the war all the seven cavalry brigades\r\nwere theoretically again made into one division, under Wellington’s\r\nchosen cavalry leader, Sir Stapleton Cotton. As a matter of fact,\r\nCotton was not allowed any independent command of them, and the\r\nbrigades were moved in twos and threes under the direct orders of the\r\ncommander-in-chief. Wellington never used his cavalry in mass for any\r\ngreat separate manœuvre. He employed them for scouting, for covering\r\nhis front, and for protecting his flanks, sometimes (but rarely and in\r\nsmall units) for a blow in battle, such as that which Le Marchant’s\r\nheavy dragoons gave at Salamanca, or Bock’s Germans at Garcia Hernandez\r\non the following day. But of this we have already spoken when dealing\r\nwith the general character of Wellington’s tactics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Distribution of Batteries]\r\n\r\nThe rule of the combination of British and Portuguese units which\r\nprevailed in the infantry, though not in the cavalry, was to be found\r\nin the artillery also. In 1810, when Wellington drafted a Portuguese\r\nbrigade of foot into each of his divisions, he also attached to several\r\nof them batteries of Portuguese artillery. So small was his allowance\r\nof British gunners, that in 1811, when he had created his two last\r\ninfantry divisions, he would not have been able to provide one field\r\nbattery for each of his eight units, unless he had drawn largely\r\nfor help on his allies. At the time of Fuentes de Oñoro and Albuera\r\nthere were in the field only three British horse artillery batteries\r\n(attached to the cavalry and the Light Division) and five British field\r\nbatteries attached to infantry divisions. The 3rd and 7th Divisions\r\nhad only Portuguese guns allotted to them. But by utilizing the very\r\nefficient artillery of the allied nation, to the extent of eight\r\nunits, Wellington was able to put thirteen field batteries in line,\r\nwhich enabled him to provide the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, and Hamilton’s\r\nPortuguese divisions with two batteries apiece, the 1st, 4th, and 7th\r\nwith one each. The two nations were worked as successfully in unison in\r\nthe artillery as in the infantry organization.\r\n\r\nOwing to the arrival of new batteries from home Wellington was able, in\r\n1812, not only to allot one or two field batteries to every division\r\nexcept the Light (which kept its old horse artillery troop, that of\r\nMajor Ross), but to collect a small reserve which belonged to the whole\r\narmy and not to any particular division. In 1813–14 he was stronger\r\nstill, though the mass of guns of which he could dispose was never\r\nso powerful in proportion to his whole army as that which Napoleon\r\nhabitually employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF THE ARMY: THE REGIMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1809, when Wellington assumed command in Portugal, the\r\ninfantry of the British Army consisted of 3 regiments of Foot Guards\r\nand 103 regiments of the line, beside 10 battalions of the King’s\r\nGerman Legion, the 8 West India regiments, the 8 Veteran Battalions,\r\nand some ten more miscellaneous foreign and colonial corps. Of the\r\n103 regiments of the line the majority, 61, had 2 battalions. Of the\r\nremainder one (the 60th or Royal Americans) had 7 battalions, one (the\r\n1st Royal Scots) 4, three (the 14th, 27th, and 95th) 3 each, while the\r\nremaining 37 were single-battalion regiments.[162] As the 1st Foot\r\nGuards had 3 battalions, and the Coldstream and Scots Fusiliers 2 each,\r\nthe total number of British battalions embodied was 186.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the curious discrepancy between the number of battalions\r\nin the various regiments was that (putting aside the Guards, the Royal\r\nScots, and the Royal Americans, who had always more battalions than\r\none, even in the eighteenth century) the British Army at the time\r\nof the rupture of the Peace of Amiens in 1803 had been composed of\r\nsingle-battalion regiments. On the outbreak of war fifty regiments in\r\nthe British Isles and other home stations were ordered to raise second\r\nbattalions,[163] and a little later the same directions were given\r\nto a few more. Two corps (the 14th and 27th) succeeded in raising two\r\nfresh battalions, as did also the Royal Scots, which was already a\r\ndouble battalion corps. But few of the regiments serving beyond seas\r\nwere ordered to carry out the same expansion, owing to their remoteness\r\nfrom recruiting centres; they remained single-battalion regiments, save\r\nthat the 35th, 47th, and 78th, though they were quartered respectively\r\nin Malta, Bermuda, and India, provided themselves with a second\r\nbattalion. Seven new regiments raised in or after 1804 (these numbered\r\n97 to 103) remained from the first to the last single-battalion corps.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of the corps which were on foreign or colonial\r\nservice in 1803–4 had returned to Great Britain since that time. But\r\nthey were never, save in a very few cases, able to raise additional\r\nbattalions, the number of such created after 1805 being only eight[164]\r\nin all. Hence the regiments from which Wellington’s Peninsular Army\r\nwas drawn must be divided with care into one-battalion corps and those\r\nwhich owned more than one battalion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Establishment of the Line]\r\n\r\nThe Estimates presented to the House of Commons in 1809 show that there\r\nwere several “establishments” of varying strength for regiments in\r\nGreat Britain and other European stations. For corps absent in the East\r\nIndies there was a wholly different set.[165]\r\n\r\nA regiment of two battalions, with both of them on active service,\r\nstands on the higher establishment at either 2250 or 2031, or\r\nthereabouts. When the senior battalion was sent on active service it\r\nwas generally completed to 1000 rank and file, which, with sergeants,\r\nofficers, and musicians, should have made up a total of over 1100. Its\r\nless effective men were drafted into the second battalion, which, if\r\nthe establishment was full (which was by no means always the case),\r\nwould have left somewhat over 900 for the second battalion. And,\r\nindeed, we find such figures as 906, 929, 916, etc., given for the\r\nstrength of several second battalions whose senior sister-unit had gone\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Weakness of Second Battalions]\r\n\r\nBut these 900 and odd men of all ranks now included not only the weak\r\nand ineffective men of the second battalion, but also those of the\r\nfirst. Therefore if a second battalion was sent out to the war, it\r\nhad to leave behind a disproportionately large number of men unfit\r\nfor active service, and would be lucky if it sailed for Portugal with\r\n700 bayonets. Many cases are on record where a far smaller number\r\ndisembarked at Lisbon or elsewhere. More than 200 would often have to\r\nbe left behind to form the depôt, wherefore second battalions were\r\nusually much weaker than first battalions when at the front.\r\n\r\nFor single-battalion regiments, such as the 2nd, 29th, 51st or 97th, we\r\nfind very various “establishments” given in the Army Estimates of 1809.\r\nThey vary down from 1151 to 696; one or two exceptional corps are even\r\nsmaller. As a rule, it may be taken that the ideal would be to recruit\r\nsuch a corps, when it was sent on active service, up to the higher\r\nfigure: but having to leave 200 men or so at home—the inefficients who\r\nwere drafted off for the depôt—it would be lucky if it landed 800 in\r\nthe Peninsula. And to keep up the battalion the depôt could not always\r\nsuffice; it was full of unserviceable men, and could only send out\r\nrecruits newly gathered.\r\n\r\nSingle-battalion regiments not on active service are those which are\r\nfound with the smaller establishments—of such figures as 716, 696, etc.\r\nNot being expected to take the field, they have not been brought up\r\nto the higher establishment, either by drafts from the militia or by\r\nspecially vigorous recruiting.\r\n\r\nThe three regiments of Foot Guards had much higher establishments than\r\nany line battalion. The three battalions of the 1st Guards mustered no\r\nless than 4619 of all ranks, the Coldstream and Scots Fusiliers each\r\n2887. Thus the former could easily send abroad two strong battalions\r\nof 1100 or 1200 men apiece, and the two latter one each, while leaving\r\nbehind a battalion and a big depôt on which to draw for recruits for\r\nthe active service units. Therefore a Guards battalion in the Peninsula\r\nseldom fell under 800 men, and was sometimes up to 1000. The Cadiz\r\ndetachment of the Guards, which fought at Barrosa, was made up from the\r\nhome battalions as a sort of extra contribution. It consisted of six\r\ncompanies of the 1st Guards, two of the Coldstream, and three of the\r\nScots Fusiliers. They are sometimes called a brigade—for which they\r\nwere too small in reality—sometimes a provisional regiment. Their total\r\nforce was about 1200 or 1300 of all ranks.\r\n\r\nWith these figures before us, we begin to see why individual battalions\r\ncame and went in the Peninsular Army. A regiment which had two\r\nbattalions, one at home and one in Portugal, was always able to keep\r\nup the strength of the service unit by regular and copious drafts from\r\nthe home unit. Or if the original one serving in the Peninsula was a\r\n_second_ battalion, the first could be sent out to relieve it. Second\r\nbattalions were never sent out to replace first battalions, it being\r\nalways the rule that the senior unit had a right to preference for\r\nactive service. But occasionally both battalions of a regiment were\r\nabsent from Great Britain, and in a few cases they were both in the\r\nPeninsula.[166] When this happened the second battalion was invariably\r\nsent home after a time, discharging its effective rank and file into\r\nthe sister battalion, and returning to Great Britain as a _cadre_\r\nof officers and sergeants, with a few old, unserviceable, or nearly\r\ntime-expired rank and file.\r\n\r\nHaving laid down these general rules, we shall see how it came to pass\r\nthat of Wellington’s original army of 1809 some battalions stopped with\r\nhim for the whole war, while others were successively sent away and\r\nreplaced by fresh units.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the British Army which had been in the Peninsula\r\nin 1808 went home from Corunna at the end of Sir John Moore’s retreat.\r\nOf these units some never came back at all to share in Wellington’s\r\ntriumphs;[167] others returned only in time to see the end of the\r\nwar in 1812, 1813, and 1814.[168] Only Craufurd’s three famous light\r\ninfantry battalions, the 1/43rd, 1/52nd, and 1/95th came back, after an\r\nabsence of no more than a few months, in the summer of 1809.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Original Peninsular Regiments]\r\n\r\nThe real nucleus of the permanent Peninsular Army was composed, not\r\nof the regiments which had operated under Moore, but of that small\r\nfragment of the original landing force of 1808 which had not followed\r\nMoore to Salamanca, Sahagun, and Corunna, but remained behind in the\r\nPeninsula.[169] To this mere remnant of eleven battalions and one\r\ncavalry regiment there were added the reinforcements which preceded or\r\naccompanied Sir Arthur Wellesley when he came to take up the command\r\nin April, 1809, which amounted to twelve battalions more, with four\r\nregiments of cavalry.[170] The whole, when first divided into brigades\r\nand organized as an operating force at Coimbra on May 4, 1809, only\r\namounted to 23,000 men—a modest nucleus for the army which was destined\r\nnot only to save Portugal, but ultimately to thrust out of Spain a\r\nbody of invaders which at this moment amounted to over 200,000 men,\r\nand which in 1810–11 was brought up to 300,000, a figure which it\r\nmaintained till drafts began to be made upon it for the Russian War in\r\n1812.[171]\r\n\r\nMoore’s host had been, as he himself wrote to Castlereagh in a\r\nnoteworthy dispatch, not so much _a_ British army as the _only_ British\r\narmy fit for the field. Since no more than an infinitesimal fraction\r\nof this picked force was able to return to the Peninsula at once, it\r\nfollowed that Wellesley’s army of 1809 was composed, for its greater\r\npart, of troops that had been considered of secondary quality, and less\r\nfit for service than the battalions which had been put _hors de combat_\r\nfor a long space by the exhaustion which they had suffered in the\r\nterrible retreat to Corunna. Excluding the Guards and the King’s German\r\nLegion units, Wellesley’s Field Army in July contained eighteen British\r\nbattalions, of which only six were first battalions of regiments of\r\nfull strength, two (the 29th and 97th) were single-battalion corps,\r\nand the remaining ten were junior battalions, _i.e._ were the usually\r\ndepleted home-service units of regiments which already had one\r\nbattalion abroad, or of which the first battalion had just returned\r\nfrom Corunna unfit for immediate use.[172] It was an army whose quality\r\nwas notably inferior to that of the force which had marched into\r\nSpain under Moore six months before. And the second battalions were\r\ninvariably under strength, because they had, until their unexpected\r\nembarkation for the front, been engaged in supplying their sister units\r\nabroad with the necessary drafts for foreign service. Many of them\r\nwere woefully weak in numbers, showing, instead of the theoretical 900\r\nbayonets, such figures as 638, 680, 749, 776, which, after deducting\r\nsick and men on command, meant under 600 for the field. Indeed, a few\r\nmonths later, at Talavera,[173] six of the second battalions and both\r\nthe single-battalion corps showed less than that number present, all\r\nranks included.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the fact that a British regiment, owing to the\r\ndifficulties of recruiting, in a time when men were scarce and bounties\r\nhigh, could not as a rule provide drafts to keep up to strength more\r\nthan one battalion on active service, we can already foresee the fates\r\nthat were destined to attend the battalions of Wellington’s original\r\nPeninsular Army. Nearly all the second battalions in time were worn\r\ndown by the exhaustion of war to a figure so low that they could no\r\nlonger be worked as regular battalion units. When they had reached this\r\nstage one of two things happened to them. If their first battalions\r\nwere available, being on home service and fit for the field, they came\r\nout to the Peninsula and replaced the depleted second battalions. But\r\nif the first battalion of any corps was already abroad in India or\r\nelsewhere, the Peninsular battalion was, during the earlier years of\r\nthe war, sent home to recruit, and its regimental number disappeared\r\nfrom Wellington’s muster-rolls. In the later years of the war this was\r\nnot so regularly done: for reasons which will be explained, several of\r\nthe veteran second battalions, which had survived at the front till\r\n1812, were retained with the army, but cut down to four companies each,\r\nand worked together in pairs to make a unit of serviceable size. Of the\r\neight original second battalions of 1809, two were drafted into their\r\nfirst battalion, which had come out to the Peninsula;[174] one (2/87th)\r\nwas sent away for a time to Cadiz, though it returned to the field\r\narmy in 1812; four were cut down in 1811–12 to half battalions.[175]\r\nOnly one, the 2/83rd, remained continuously in the Peninsula as a full\r\nbattalion till the end of the war.\r\n\r\nThe same fate attended the single-battalion regiments, which had no\r\nsister battalion at home to draw upon, but only a depôt. Both the 29th\r\nand the 97th went home, reduced to skeletons, in 1811.\r\n\r\nBut the six first-battalions present with the field army in May, 1809,\r\nwere still at the front in fair strength at the termination of the\r\nwar in 1814, and this, though two of them had been among the worst\r\nsufferers in the bloody field of Albuera. Indeed, there is throughout\r\nthe war, I believe, only one case in which the first battalion of a\r\ncomplete regiment went out to the front, and was sent away before the\r\nend of the campaigning in 1814.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reinforcements from Home]\r\n\r\nThe reinforcements which were sent out to Wellington from 1810 to 1812\r\nmay be divided into two sections, of which the larger was composed of\r\nthe reorganized and recruited battalions of Moore’s Corunna army. Of\r\nthese, six battalions came out in 1810, nine in 1811, eight in 1812,\r\nand three in 1813–14. The greater number of them were first battalions,\r\nor putting aside the Guards and German Legion units, fifteen out of\r\ntwenty-three: of these all save one (the 1/26th) fought out the rest\r\nof the war. Of single-battalion regiments there were four (2nd, 51st,\r\n20th, 76th); of junior battalions belonging to corps which already\r\nhad one battalion abroad, there were also only three (3/1st, 2/52nd,\r\n2/59th). Of these two last classes the 2/52nd was soon sent home, after\r\ndrafting its men into the 1/52nd. The 2nd got so depleted that it\r\nwas cut down to four companies, and put into a provisional battalion\r\nin 1812 till the end of the war. The 76th on its return was only in\r\nthe field for a few months in 1813–14, so that it had no time to get\r\nworked down. The 3/1st, though a junior battalion, belonged to a large\r\nregiment of four battalions, and for that reason never shrank below\r\nits proper size, there being a sister unit at home to send it drafts.\r\nWe may therefore say that, of the eight battalions which were not\r\nfirst battalions of full regiments, only three saw long service, yet\r\nsurvived unimpaired to the peace of 1814 (20th, 51st, 2/59th); and of\r\nthese three two only came out in 1812, and were less than two years\r\nin the Peninsula. It is clear, then, that the same rule prevailed in\r\nthe reinforcements as in the original 1809 army; only first battalions\r\ncould be relied upon not to melt.\r\n\r\nThe battalions sent out as reinforcements to Wellington which had not\r\nformed part of Moore’s Corunna army, were decidedly less numerous\r\nthan the other class, amounting to only nineteen. Of these six were\r\nfirst battalions,[176] eight second battalions,[177] and five single\r\nbattalion corps.[178] All of the first-named category fought out the\r\nwhole war: but several of the other two were sent home, either when\r\nthey had been depleted to reinforce their first battalions, or for\r\nother reasons. The proportion would have been larger but for the fact\r\nthat several of them were among the last arrivals in the Peninsula, who\r\nonly joined in the later autumn and winter campaigns of 1813–14, and\r\nhad not time to get worn down.[179] One second battalion (2/58th) was\r\nworked as a four-company unit during the last two years of the war.\r\n\r\nThe net result of all the interchange of battalions, and of the sending\r\nhome of weak units, was that in 1814, when the struggle with Napoleon\r\nhad come to its end, out of fifty-six British line battalions present\r\nat the front, only thirteen were second battalions, and of these last\r\nfive[180] were (as has been already mentioned) so depleted in numbers\r\nthat they were being worked in pairs, being each only four companies\r\nstrong, and not mustering more than 250 or 300 men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Walcheren Regiments]\r\n\r\nThat such weak half-units were detained in the Peninsula was due to a\r\nresolve of Wellington’s, made after the campaign of 1811. During the\r\nlatter part of that year the chief of his worries was that he had been\r\nsent out among his reinforcements a number of corps which had served\r\nin the Walcheren expedition, where almost every man had the seeds of\r\nague in him, from a sojourn in the marshes of Holland. The heat of\r\nthe Portuguese summer and the torrential rains of the autumn at once\r\nbrought out the latent weakness in the constitution of men who were\r\nlittle more than convalescents, and regiments which had landed at\r\nLisbon in July 850 strong showed only 550 in the ranks in October.[181]\r\nSo appalling was the accumulation of fever and ague cases in the\r\nhospitals[182] that Wellington wrote home to beg that not another unit\r\nwhich had been at Walcheren might be sent out to him. He now made up\r\nhis mind to keep old regiments, even when they had dwindled rather low\r\nin numbers, rather than to send them home to recruit, and to receive\r\nnew battalions in their stead. The reason was that it took a corps many\r\nmonths before it learnt to shift for itself, and to grow acclimatized.\r\nDuring their first few months in the Peninsula, newly arrived units\r\nalways showed too many sick and too many stragglers. For men fresh\r\nfrom barrack life in England were at first prostrated by the heat of\r\nthe climate and the length of the marches. They had still to pick up\r\nthe old campaigner’s tricks, and were very helpless. Veteran troops\r\nwere so superior in endurance to new regiments from England, most of\r\nwhom had been on the pestilential Walcheren expedition, and were still\r\nfull of rickety convalescents, that Wellington determined to keep\r\neven remnants of old corps accustomed to the air of the Peninsula,\r\nrather than to ask for more unacclimatized battalions from home. Hence\r\ncame the institution, in the end of 1812, of two of the “provisional\r\nbattalions” already mentioned.[183] At an earlier period of the war\r\nthey would undoubtedly have been sent back to England.[184] But now\r\nthese fractions of depleted veteran corps were taken, with excellent\r\nresults, all through the campaign of 1812–13–14.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fate of Second Battalions]\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps worth while to make a note how curious was Wellington’s\r\nattitude in face of that rather exceptional occurrence the appearance\r\nof two strong battalions of the same regiment in his army. If the\r\nsecond battalion was weak, he soon drafted it into the first and sent\r\nit home. But when, from some chance, both had full ranks, it did not\r\nby any means always strike him as necessary to brigade them together.\r\nFor example, the 1/7th and 2/7th were both at the front from October,\r\n1810, to July, 1811; but for several months of the time one was in the\r\n4th Division, the other in the 1st. A still more striking instance\r\nis that of the 48th. Its two battalions were both from their first\r\narrival placed in the 2nd Division, but they served from June, 1809,\r\nto May, 1811, in different brigades of it.[185] The occasions when\r\nthe two battalions of the same regiment served for any time in one\r\nbrigade were very rare—I only know of the cases of the 1st and 3rd\r\nbattalions of the Foot Guards in 1813–14, of the two battalions of the\r\n52nd between March, 1811, and March, 1812, and of those of the 7th\r\nFusiliers, who (after some service apart) had been brigaded together\r\nin the 4th Division six months before Albuera. In the last two cases\r\nthe first battalion presently absorbed the second, which was sent home\r\nas a skeleton _cadre_ when its strength at last began to run low. All\r\nother cases of juxtaposition were so short that it would seem that\r\nWellington only brought the two battalions together for the purpose of\r\ndrafting the second into the first at the earliest convenient moment.\r\nIn this way the 2/88th (long in garrison at Lisbon) were brought up to\r\nthe front to be amalgamated in less than four months with the 1/88th\r\n(March-July, 1811). The 1/5th, coming out in the summer of 1812, seems\r\nto have served along with the 2/5th for about the same number of\r\nmonths, the latter being sent home in October. The 1/38th similarly\r\narrived at about the same time, and served from June to November beside\r\nthe 2/38th, which then departed. These are very different cases from\r\nthose of the two battalions of the 7th, the 48th, and the 52nd, all of\r\nwhich were present for a year or more together in the army.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE V._\r\n\r\nOFFICER OF RIFLES.\r\n\r\n1809.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE, INFANTRY OF THE LINE.\r\n\r\n1809.]\r\n\r\nThe working unit of the Peninsular Army was always the ten-company\r\nbattalion, commanded by a lieutenant-colonel. When, as in the\r\nexceptional cases just named, it chanced that two battalions of a\r\nregiment got together, the senior of the two commanding officers\r\nhad no authority over the other. Both were directly responsible to\r\nthe brigadier. The battalion theoretically had thirty-five officers\r\nand 1000 rank and file, besides sergeants and drummers. A pestilent\r\npractice prevailed in all British general returns, of giving in\r\nstatistics of the larger sort only the number of rank and file (_i.e._\r\ncorporals and privates), officers, sergeants, and musicians being all\r\nomitted. To bring the figures up to the real general total in such a\r\ncase, an allowance of about one-eighth or one-ninth has to be added to\r\nthe number given. Fortunately detailed returns of all ranks are always\r\navailable, when absolute correctness is required, from the fortnightly\r\ngeneral states at the Record Office.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical establishment of about 1150 of all ranks for a first\r\nbattalion was, of course, hardly ever seen in the field. Regiments\r\nwhich landed at Lisbon with a full complement soon dwindled, even\r\nbefore they got to the front, and nothing was rarer than a battalion in\r\nline of battle with a total strength in the four figures.[186] A good\r\nwell-managed corps which had not been in action of late, and had not\r\nbeen stationed in an unhealthy cantonment, might keep up to 700 and\r\neven 800 men throughout a campaign. The Guards battalions, which had a\r\ndecidedly larger establishment than those of the line, were frequently\r\nup to 900 men or more.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a battalion which had seen much fighting, which had\r\nnot received its drafts regularly, and had long starved on the bleak\r\nmountains of Beira, or sweltered in the pestilential valley of the\r\nGuadiana, often worked down to 450 men or less, even if it were a first\r\nbattalion which had landed with its full 1000 rank and file. A second\r\nbattalion under similar circumstances might shrink to 250 or 300. At\r\nthe end of the very fatiguing campaign of 1811, which had included\r\nthe toilsome pursuit of Masséna, the Fuentes de Oñoro fighting, and\r\nthe long tarrying on the Caya during the unhealthy summer heats, of\r\nforty-six battalions present with Wellington’s main army only nine (all\r\nsave one first-battalions, and two of them belonging to the Guards)\r\nshowed more than 700 of all ranks present. Sixteen more had between\r\n500 and 700, ten between 400 and 500. No less than eleven were down to\r\nthe miserable figure of under 400 men, and it is to be noted that of\r\nthese nearly all were either second battalions or single-battalion\r\nregiments; there were six of the former three of the latter among them.\r\nThe average of the whole, it may be seen, was about 550 men per unit;\r\nthe extreme variation was between 1005 for the strongest battalion and\r\n263 for the weakest.[187] At this time, it should be noted, the army\r\nwas more sickly than it had ever been before, having over 14,000 men\r\nin hospital to 29,300 present with the colours. Wellington was never\r\nagain so encumbered with sick, save for one period of a few weeks—that\r\nwhich followed the end of the retreat from Burgos to Ciudad Rodrigo\r\nin October-November, 1813. During the first months of this winter the\r\ntroops, tired by incessant marching in the rain, and low feeding, sent\r\ninto hospital a number of cases not less distressing than those which\r\nhad been seen in September, 1811. But a short period of rest served to\r\nre-establish their health, and in 1813–14 the troops were very healthy,\r\neven during the trying weeks when many of them were cantoned high among\r\nthe snows of the Pyrenean passes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cavalry Regiments]\r\n\r\nSo much for the infantry regiments. A few words as regards the cavalry\r\nmust be added to this chapter on organization. From first to last\r\nWellington had under him twenty-one regiments of British horse, besides\r\nfour more of the light and heavy cavalry of the King’s German Legion.\r\nBut at no time had he such a force as would be represented by this\r\ntotal. He started in 1809 with eight regiments. Before he had been\r\nmany weeks in command one of his units (a fractional one, composed\r\nof two squadrons of the 20th Light Dragoons) was taken from him and\r\nshipped off to Sicily. Before the end of the year another (23rd Light\r\nDragoons), which had been badly cut up at Talavera, and lost half\r\nits strength there, was sent home to recruit. Thus he had only six\r\nregiments[188] on January 1, 1810, and as only one joined him that\r\nyear,[189] seven was his total force, till he at last received large\r\nreinforcements in the late summer and autumn of 1811. But he started\r\nthe campaign of 1812 with sixteen regiments,[190] which was almost the\r\nhighest figure that he was to own. For although during the campaign of\r\n1813 he was sent four new Hussar regiments, yet at the same time four\r\ndepleted corps were sent home to be recruited and reorganized. This\r\nwould have left his total at the same figure of sixteen units as in\r\n1812, if he had not also received a large composite regiment (or weak\r\nbrigade) composed of two squadrons from each of the three units of the\r\nHousehold Cavalry. By this addition alone did his cavalry force in\r\n1813–14 exceed that which he had possessed in 1812. If we reckon the\r\nHousehold squadrons as roughly equivalent to two units, the total at\r\nthe end of the war was eighteen regiments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Faults of Raw Cavalry]\r\n\r\nUnlike the infantry, the cavalry of the British Army was organized\r\nwithout exception in isolated units, as it is to-day. A corps sent\r\nto the Peninsula left a depôt squadron behind it, and there was no\r\nsource except this depôt from which it could draw recruits. Nothing\r\nresembling the sister-unit on which an infantry battalion depended was\r\nin existence. Hence if a cavalry regiment sank low in numbers, and\r\nexhausted the drafts which the depôt squadron could send out, it had\r\nto return to England to recruit. During the whole war only one corps\r\n(the 23rd Light Dragoons at Talavera) suffered a complete disaster,\r\ncorresponding to that which the 2nd Infantry Division incurred at\r\nAlbuera, and this unlucky regiment was sent home that autumn, when the\r\nBritish Army had retreated to the Portuguese frontier. But four others\r\nworked down so low in strength, and especially in horses, during the\r\ncampaign of 1812, that, although they had none of them been thinned\r\ndown in a single action like the 23rd, they had become ineffective,\r\nand had to quit the Peninsula. It is most noteworthy that all of these\r\nfour corps were comparatively recent arrivals; they had come out in\r\n1811, and in little over a single year had fallen into a state of\r\ninefficiency far exceeding that of the regiments whose service dated\r\nback to 1809, and who had seen two years more of hard campaigning.[191]\r\nThe moral to be drawn is the same that we have noted with the infantry:\r\nthe regiments which had served Wellington since his first arrival had\r\nbecome acclimatized, and had learnt the tricks of the old soldier.\r\nThey could shift for themselves, and (what was no less important)\r\nfor their horses, far better than any newly-arrived corps. We find\r\nbitter complaints of the defective scouting and outpost work of the\r\nnew-comers. After a petty disaster to the outlying pickets of two\r\nof the lately-landed regiments Wellington wrote: “This disagreeable\r\ncircumstance tends to show the difference between old and new troops.\r\nThe old regiments of cavalry throughout all their service, with all\r\ntheir losses put together, have not lost so many men as the 2nd Hussars\r\nof the Legion and the 11th Light Dragoons in a few days. However, we\r\nmust try to make the new as good as the old.”[192] This was evidently\r\nnot too easy to accomplish; at any rate, at the end of the next year it\r\nwas four of the new corps[193] which were sent home as depleted units,\r\nnot any of the seven old ones. All these, without exception, endured\r\nto the last campaign of 1814, though they nearly all[194] had to be\r\nreduced from a four-squadron to a three-squadron establishment in\r\nthe autumn of 1811, owing to their shrunken effective. But they never\r\nfell so low as the four corps condemned to return to England in the\r\nnext year. No more regiments went home after the winter of 1812–13;\r\nthe campaign of Vittoria and the Pyrenees did not bear heavily on the\r\ncavalry, most of whom, during the mountain fighting in the autumn, were\r\ncomfortably cantoned in the Ebro Valley. They only moved forward again\r\nin the spring of 1814 for that invasion of France which was brought to\r\nsuch an abrupt end by the fall of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical establishment of the regiments of cavalry (putting\r\naside the Household Cavalry) was in 1809 fixed at 905 men in nearly\r\nevery case. But a large depôt was always left behind in England, and if\r\na regiment landed 600 sabres in Portugal, in four squadrons, it was up\r\nto the average strength. At the front it would seldom show more than\r\n450, as horses began to die off or go sick the moment that they felt\r\nthe Peninsular air and diet. A regiment which had been reduced from\r\nfour squadrons to three might show only 300 men on parade in the middle\r\nof a campaign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE VI._\r\n\r\nOFFICER OF LIGHT DRAGOONS.\r\n\r\nUNIFORM OF 1809.\r\n\r\nOFFICER OF LIGHT DRAGOONS.\r\n\r\nUNIFORM OF 1813.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nINTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF THE REGIMENT: THE OFFICERS\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto we have been dealing with the regiment considered as a whole,\r\nand mainly with its place in the brigade and division to which it had\r\nbeen allotted. We must now pass on to consider it not as a whole, but\r\nas an assemblage of parts—officers, staff, sergeants, rank and file,\r\nand musicians.\r\n\r\nTo understand the mechanism of a regiment it is first necessary to\r\nsay something about the establishment of officers. Battalions and\r\ncavalry regiments were normally commanded by a lieutenant-colonel:\r\nthere were very few full colonels with the army, and almost the only\r\nones who commanded a unit were those of the brigades of Guards, where\r\nowing to the “double rank” which made all lieutenants “captains in\r\nthe army,” all captains lieutenant-colonels, and all majors and\r\nlieutenant-colonels _full_ colonels, it resulted that the battalion\r\ncommander always held a colonelcy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Devolution of Command]\r\n\r\nWhen the lieutenant-colonel in a battalion was dead, wounded, or sick,\r\nthe unit was often commanded by the senior major—there were normally\r\ntwo of them—sometimes for many months at a time, till the absent\r\nofficer returned, or his place was filled by promotion. Cases were\r\nknown where, owing to great mortality or invaliding in the senior\r\nranks, a captain might be found in command of the battalion for a\r\ncertain space. I note that about the time of Bussaco the “morning\r\nstate” of the army shows two units (both of the Guards) commanded by\r\ncolonels, 30 by lieutenant-colonels, 16 by majors, one by a captain,\r\nand this, I think, was a fairly normal proportion.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the colonel and the two majors, an infantry battalion at\r\nfull strength would possess ten captains and twenty subalterns, or a\r\ntrifle more, giving the allowance of three officers per company, with a\r\nfew over. How many of the subalterns would be lieutenants and how many\r\nensigns (called 2nd lieutenants in the rifle regiments) was a matter of\r\nmere chance, but the lieutenants were nearly always in a majority.[195]\r\nA glance down the morning state of the Bussaco army of September, 1811,\r\nshows that one battalion (1/45th) had no more than one ensign, another\r\n(the 74th) as many as eleven. It was very rare for a regiment to have\r\nits full establishment of ten captains present; there were nearly\r\nalways one or two companies commanded by their senior lieutenants.\r\nIn addition to its company officers every battalion had its “staff,”\r\ncomposed of the adjutant, paymaster, quartermaster, and the surgeon,\r\nwith his two assistant surgeons. The adjutant was usually a lieutenant,\r\nbut occasionally an ensign; in the Guards (where most ranks counted\r\na step higher than in the line), he was usually a “lieutenant and\r\ncaptain.” In addition to the officers regularly commissioned, a\r\nbattalion had often with it one or two “volunteers”—young men who\r\nwere practically probationers; they were allowed to come out to an\r\nactive-service battalion on the chance of being gazetted to it without\r\npurchase, on their own responsibility. They carried muskets and served\r\nin the ranks, but were allowed to wear uniforms of a better cloth than\r\nthat given to the rank and file, and messed with the officers.\r\n\r\nThe most astonishing case of devolution of acting rank through the\r\ndeath or wounding of many seniors was at the battle of Albuera. On\r\nthe morning after that action the wrecks of the second brigade of\r\nthe 2nd Division, temporarily united into one battalion because of\r\nthe dreadful losses which had fallen on every one of the three units\r\nof which it consisted, were commanded by the senior captain of the\r\n1/48th regiment—and he (as it chanced) was a French _emigré_, with the\r\nsomewhat lugubrious name of Cimitière. The brigade had been reduced\r\n(it may be remarked) from a strength of 1651 to 597 in the battle, no\r\nless than 1054 officers and men being killed, wounded, or missing,\r\nand the brigadier, with five lieutenant-colonels and majors senior to\r\nCimitière having been killed or wounded.[196] But the Albuera losses\r\nwere, of course, the record in the way of heavy casualties; there is\r\nnothing that can be compared to them in the annals of Wellington’s army\r\nfor general slaughter extending all through an army, though certain\r\nindividual regiments in particular engagements suffered almost as\r\nheavily—_e.g._ in the storm of Badajoz and at Waterloo.\r\n\r\nThe chances of temporary command were sometimes curious. The gallant\r\nColborne, whom I have already had occasion to mention, though only\r\na lieutenant-colonel, commanded a brigade at Albuera, owing to the\r\nabsence of the brigadier—he being the senior of four battalion\r\ncommanders. He then commanded his own regiment only during 1811–13, but\r\nsucceeded as senior lieutenant-colonel to the charge of a brigade of\r\nthe Light Division for the last six months of the war. Though he had\r\nthus twice commanded a brigade with distinction in the Peninsula, we\r\nfind him in the Waterloo campaign once more at the head of his own 52nd\r\nFoot, in Adam’s brigade. It is true that with his single battalion he\r\nthere did more than most of the generals, by giving the decisive stroke\r\nwhich wrecked the attack of the French Guard.\r\n\r\nNot only did lieutenant-colonels practically become brigadiers, in an\r\ninterim fashion, pretty frequently, but once at least an officer with\r\nno higher rank commanded a whole division for some months. This was\r\nColonel Andrew Barnard, who after Craufurd fell at Ciudad Rodrigo,\r\nand the only other general with the division (Vandeleur) was wounded,\r\nhad charge of the most precious unit of Wellington’s whole army for\r\nnearly five months, and headed it at the storm of Badajoz. There seems\r\nto have been a similar, but a shorter phenomenon of this sort with the\r\n3rd Division, after the fall of Badajoz, when, Generals Picton and\r\nKempt being both disabled, Colonel Wallace of the Connaught Rangers\r\ncommanded the division for a week or two—till Wellington drafted in his\r\nbrother-in-law, General Pakenham, to lead it, which he did with great\r\ndistinction at Salamanca.[197]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Purchase System]\r\n\r\nPromotion in the British Army at this period was working in the most\r\nirregular and spasmodic fashion, there being two separate influences\r\noperating in diametrically opposite ways. The one was the purchase\r\nsystem, the other the frequent, but not by any means sufficiently\r\nfrequent, promotion for merit and good service in the field. The\r\npractice at the Horse Guards was that casualties by deaths in\r\naction were filled up inside the regiment, without money passing,\r\nbut that for all other vacancies the purchase system worked. When a\r\nlieutenant-colonelcy, majority, or captaincy was vacant, the senior\r\nin the next lower rank had a moral right to be offered the vacancy at\r\nthe regulation price. But there were many cases in which more than the\r\nregulation could be got. The officer retiring handed over the affair\r\nto a “commission broker,” and bidding was invited. A poor officer at\r\nthe head of those of his own rank could not afford to pay the often\r\nvery heavy price, and might see three or four of his juniors buy their\r\nway over his head, while he vainly waited for a vacancy by death, by\r\nwhich he would obtain his step without having to pay cash. The system\r\nof exchanges, which prevailed on the largest scale, also pressed very\r\nhardly on the impecunious; officers from other corps, where there\r\nwas a block in promotion, managed for themselves a transference into\r\nbattalions where there seemed to be a likelihood of a more rapid\r\nchange of rank, by paying large differences for an exchange to those\r\nwho stood at the head of the list. But there was also a good deal of\r\nexchanging for other reasons—officers whose regiments were ordered\r\nto unhealthy or unpopular stations, such as the West Indies or New\r\nSouth Wales, offered considerable sums to others who were ready to\r\naccept the ineligible destination in return for hard cash. By careful\r\nmanagement of this sort, a wealthy officer could procure himself very\r\nrapid promotion—_e.g._ a lieutenant might buy a captaincy in a West\r\nIndia regiment for a comparatively modest sum, and then, as a captain\r\nin such a corps, exchange on a second payment with a broken or needy\r\ncaptain in some other regiment on a European station, to whom money was\r\nall-important, and so get well established in his new rank, without\r\never really having quitted home, or served in the corps into and out\r\nof which he had rapidly come and gone—on paper only. It is said that\r\none young officer, who had the advantages of being wealthy, a peer,\r\nand possessed of great family influence in Parliament, was worked up\r\nfrom a lieutenancy to a lieutenant-colonelcy in a single year. This,\r\nof course, was a very exceptional case, and happened long ere the\r\nPeninsular War began; but it may be remembered that Wellington himself,\r\nwas, through similar advantages on a smaller scale, enabled to move\r\nup from ensign on March 7, 1787, to lieutenant-colonel in September,\r\n1793—five steps in seven years, during which he had been moved through\r\nas many regiments—two of horse and five of foot. He was only nineteen\r\nmonths a captain and six months a major, and he had seen no war service\r\nwhatever when he sailed for Flanders in command of the 33rd at the age\r\nof twenty-three! The Duke of York later insisted on a certain minimum\r\nservice in each rank before promotion could be obtained.\r\n\r\nContrast with such promotion that of the poor and friendless officer\r\nwho, after twenty-five years of service, six Peninsular campaigns, and\r\ntwo wounds, found himself still a captain at the age of 43![198] But\r\nthere were plenty of unlucky men who at the end of the war were still\r\nonly lieutenants after six campaigns, and were placed on half-pay as\r\nsuch, at the great disbandment of the second battalions which took\r\nplace in 1816–17. The juxtaposition of rapid promotion obtainable by\r\ninfluence and the purchase of steps, with absolute stagnation in a\r\nlow rank, which often fell on the impecunious officer, whose regiment\r\ndid not chance to have many casualties in action, was appalling and\r\nmonstrous.\r\n\r\nI take it that the most pernicious of all the disturbing causes\r\nwhich told against the right distribution of promotion was political\r\ninfluence. As a contemporary pamphleteer wrote: “Instances are very\r\nfew indeed of preferment being obtained by other corrupt means[199]\r\ncompared to the omnipotence of Parliamentary interest. Thence\r\noriginates the shameful practice of thrusting boys into a company\r\nover the heads of all the lieutenants and ensigns of the regiment.\r\nThe Duke of York has done something to check it, but he can never\r\nremove the Colossus of Parliamentary interest, an interest that\r\ndisdains solicitation, and imperiously _demands_ from the minister of\r\nthe day that which no minister ever found it convenient to deny. To\r\nthis species of influence the commander-in-chief must give way—for it\r\nis capable, when slighted, of removing both commander-in-chief and\r\nminister.”[200]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The King’s Hard Bargains]\r\n\r\nIt was to the unscrupulous use by great men of their parliamentary\r\ninfluence upon the ministry of the day that the army owed a great\r\nproportion of its “King’s hard bargains” in the commissioned\r\nranks. The obscure but necessary instruments of one of the great\r\nborough-mongers—Whig no less than Tory—were often paid by the\r\nnomination of their sons or other young relatives to a commission, by\r\nthe influence of their patron: and the families that did the dirty\r\nwork of a great politician were not likely to be distinguished for\r\nhigh morals or uprightness. Sometimes the nominations were absolutely\r\nshameful—it is said that the son of the keeper of a fashionable\r\ngaming-house in St. James’ was slid into the list of ensigns on one\r\noccasion, by a politician whom his father had obliged. Whether this\r\nbe true or not, it is certain that there was a sprinkling of officers\r\nwho were not gentlemen in any sense of the term serving throughout the\r\nwar.[201] Others about whose gentle blood there was no doubt, were\r\nundesirable in other ways—prominent among them a section of young\r\nIrish squireens with the bullying and duelling habits, as well as\r\nthe hard-drinking, which were notoriously prevalent among the less\r\ncivilized strata of society beyond St. George’s Channel. I find in\r\none memoir a note of a newly-joined ensign after mess addressing the\r\nassembled officers as follows: “By Jasus, gentlemen, I am conscious you\r\nmust have the meanest opinion of my courage. Here have I been no less\r\nthan six weeks with the regiment, and the divil of a duel have I fought\r\nyet. Now, Captain C., you are the senior captain, and if you please I\r\nwill begin with you first: so name your time and place.” As the diarist\r\nvery wisely writes, “one could not be too guarded in one’s conduct with\r\nsuch heroes.”[202]\r\n\r\nDuels, I may remark in passing, were much less frequent in the\r\nPeninsular Army than might have been expected. Wellington (though long\r\nafter he most foolishly “went out” with Lord Winchelsea in 1829) set\r\nhis face against them on active service, because he could not afford to\r\nlose good officers on account of personal quarrels. There certainly\r\nwere much fewer duels proportionately in the Peninsula than in England\r\nat the time—not to speak of Ireland and India, where they were beyond\r\nall reason common. I have only found records of four fatal duels in the\r\nrecords of court-martials, and though non-fatal ones could have been\r\n(and were) hushed up, they cannot have been very numerous, for one may\r\nread through scores of memoirs and diaries without running upon the\r\nmention of one. It is curious to note that when they did occur, and a\r\ncourt-martial followed, that body invariably found that though there\r\nwas no doubt that Captain A. or Lieutenant B. was dead, yet there was\r\nno conclusive proof that he had been killed by C. or D.—the mouths of\r\nthe seconds being sealed by the fact that they were also on their trial\r\nfor having acted in such a capacity.[203] The whole matter was clearly\r\na solemn farce. But the fact remains that duels were not frequent,\r\nand that duellists had a bad mark against them. Good commanding\r\nofficers took immense trouble to prevent a duel from arising over silly\r\nmess-table quarrels, exerting every influence to make one party, or\r\nboth, apologize for words spoken in anger, or in liquor.[204]\r\n\r\nThe body of officers of a Peninsular regiment was often a very odd\r\nparty—there might be a lieutenant-colonel of twenty-six, who had risen\r\nrapidly by purchase or interest, and captains of fifty or even sixty; I\r\nfound a note of one who had attained that age in the 73rd. At the head\r\nof each rank there might be several impecunious and disappointed men,\r\nwaiting for the promotion that could only come by casualties in action,\r\nsince they could never hope to purchase their step. Nevertheless, the\r\nfeuds that might have been expected to follow such a situation do not\r\nseem to have been so many, or so bitter, as might have been expected.\r\nThe grudge was set against the system rather than the individual, in\r\nmost cases, and the sight of a mess cut up into cliques and coteries\r\nof enemies, though it can be found recorded occasionally, was quite\r\nexceptional.[205] The saving fact was that there was always the chance\r\nof promotion for merit, in reward of some specially gallant deed, and\r\nit often came—though the Duke was occasionally incomprehensible in the\r\nway in which he mentioned or did not mention officers in dispatches.\r\nThe lieutenant who brought down the French flag from the castle of\r\nBadajoz, and who was sent with it by Picton to the commander-in-chief,\r\nwas thanked and asked to dinner, but was still a lieutenant years\r\nafter, in spite of his general’s vehement remonstrances.[206] Dozens of\r\nsuch instances could be quoted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Professional Training]\r\n\r\nProfessional training for officers had perforce been non-existent in\r\nthe early years of the French war. There was no institution which\r\nsupplied it, and all military knowledge had to be acquired by rule\r\nof thumb at regimental headquarters. An improvement of the greatest\r\nimportance was made by the establishment in December, 1801, of the\r\n“Royal Military College” at High Wycombe for the use of young officers,\r\nfollowed by the creation of its “Junior Department” in May, 1802,\r\n“for the instruction of those who from early life are intended for\r\nthe military profession.” The latter, the origin of the college at\r\nSandhurst, to which the department was removed in 1811, accepted boys\r\nas early as thirteen. Its first inspector-general was the French\r\n_emigré_ Jarry, to whom we owe the “Instructions for Light Infantry\r\nin the Field” of 1804, while Colonel John Gaspard Le Marchant was\r\n“Lieutenant-governor and Superintendant General.” This was the\r\naccomplished cavalry officer who fell in 1812, at the head of his\r\nbrigade, in the crisis of the battle of Salamanca, when he had just\r\ndelivered a decisive charge. The military college men were already\r\nnumerous when the Peninsular War began.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The “Belemites”]\r\n\r\nThe French General, Foy, a witness whose authority can hardly be\r\ncalled in question, for he is making grudging admissions, says that he\r\nconsidered the general mass of the British officers excellent.[207] The\r\nmore we study detailed records, the more willingly do we acknowledge\r\nthat his praise is well deserved. The weaker brethren were very few—so\r\nfew that an enemy did not even notice them. Misconduct on the field was\r\nthe rarest of offences; there are hardly half a dozen court-martials\r\nfor suspected slackness, among the hundreds that were held for other\r\noffences. There were an appreciable number of officers “broke” for\r\nfaults that came from hard drinking, “incapable when on duty,” and so\r\nforth, or brawling, and a very few for financial irregularities; but\r\nconsidering the unpromising material that was sometimes pitchforked\r\ninto a regiment by the unscrupulous exercise of patronage at home,\r\nthey were exceedingly few. The only class of failures who had any\r\nappreciable numbers, and earned a special name, were the “Belemites,”\r\nso called from the general depôt at the convent of Belem in the suburbs\r\nof Lisbon. This was the headquarters of all officers absent from the\r\nfront as convalescents or on leave, and the limited proportion who\r\nstayed there over-long, and showed an insufficient eagerness to return\r\nto their regiments, were nicknamed from the spot where they lingered\r\nbeyond the bounds of discretion. Wellington occasionally gave an order\r\nto Colonel Peacocke, the military governor of Lisbon, to rout up this\r\ncoterie—there were always a sprinkling there who were not over-anxious\r\nto resume the hard life of campaigning, and loved too much the\r\ngambling-hells and other sordid delights of Lisbon.[208] Occasionally\r\nthe notices which appear in General Orders about these gentry are\r\nrather surprising—one would not have thought that such men could even\r\nhave obtained a commission. Take, for example, “The commanding officer\r\nat Lisbon (or the commanding officer of any station at which Captain\r\n—— of the 88th may happen to be found), will be pleased to place that\r\nofficer under arrest, and send him to join his regiment, he having been\r\nabsent for several months without leave, and having been in Portugal\r\nsince October 20th last, without reporting himself to or communicating\r\nwith his commanding officer.”[209]\r\n\r\nWellington in his moments of irritation sometimes wrote as if the\r\nmajority of his officers were slack and disobedient. Such men existed;\r\nbut, as one who knew the Duke well observed, “by long exercise of\r\nabsolute power he had become intolerant of the slightest provocation,\r\nand every breach of discipline, no matter how limited its range,\r\nmade him furious with the whole army. Hence frequent General Orders,\r\nas violent as they were essentially unjust, wherein, because of the\r\nmisdeeds of a few, all who served under him were denounced—the officers\r\nas ignorant of their duty, the rank and file as little better than a\r\nrabble.”[210]\r\n\r\nBut the duty-shirking officer, and still more the disreputable officer\r\nwas, after all, a very rare exception. The atmosphere of contempt which\r\nsurrounded him in his regiment as a rule sufficed to make him send\r\nin his papers, after a longer or a shorter period of endurance, in\r\nproportion as his skin was tough or thin. Opinion was not so hard upon\r\nthe man who was merely quarrelsome and ungentlemanly in his cups. But\r\nthere were limits even to the boisterousness permitted to the tippler,\r\nand drunkenness when in face of the enemy, or in a position of military\r\nresponsibility, was always fatal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Officers from the Ranks]\r\n\r\nThere was, throughout the war, a perceptible proportion of officers who\r\nhad risen from the ranks. Meritorious service, showing good capacity as\r\nwell as courage, not unfrequently led to the promotion of a sergeant\r\nto an ensigncy. A well-remembered case is that of the Sergeant Newman\r\nof the 43rd who rallied the stragglers during the march from Lugo to\r\nBetanzos, in the Corunna retreat, and beat off the pursuing French\r\ndragoons. Another is that of Sergeant Masterson of the 2/87th, who\r\ncaptured the eagle of the _8th Ligne_ at Barrosa. Many more might be\r\nquoted, though none of them is so striking as that of a man who did not\r\nserve in the Peninsula, but in contemporary campaigns in India, the\r\ncelebrated John Shipp. He was _twice_ given a commission for deeds of\r\nexceptional daring. After winning his first ensigncy in the storming\r\nparty at the Siege of Bhurtpoor in 1805, he was forced to “sell out”\r\na little later by improvident living. He enlisted as a private in\r\nanother regiment, and was again promoted from the ranks for a single\r\ncombat with a Nepaulese chief during the first Goorkha War of 1815.\r\nConducting himself with more wisdom on his second chance, he served\r\nlong as an officer, and when he went on half-pay became chief-constable\r\nof Liverpool. His autobiography is an artless and interesting piece of\r\nwork well worth perusal.\r\n\r\nWhen a regiment had greatly distinguished itself in the field,\r\nWellington not unfrequently directed its colonel to recommend a\r\nsergeant for a commission. This, for example, was done for all three\r\nbattalions of the Light Division after their splendid exploit at\r\nBussaco. Yet he did not approve of this system of promotion as anything\r\nbut a very exceptional measure, and in his table-talk with Lord\r\nStanhope we find some very harshly worded verdicts on old rankers,\r\n“their origin would come out, and you could never perfectly trust\r\nthem,”[211] especially in the matter of drink. This seems to be a\r\ntypical instance of the Duke’s aristocratic prejudices—but there was\r\nsomething in what he said. The position of the promoted sergeants was\r\ncertainly difficult, and it required a man of exceptional character to\r\nmake it good. As a rule, they drifted into the position of paymasters,\r\nrecruiting officers, barrack masters, and such-like posts. But many of\r\nthem made useful and efficient adjutants. In command they were not as a\r\nrule successful,[212] and I have only come on a single case of one who\r\nreached the rank of full colonel, and of two who were fortunate enough\r\nto obtain a majority. It is clear that the purchase system pressed\r\nvery hardly upon them: with no private resources it was impossible for\r\nthem ever to buy a step, and, after reaching the rank of captain, they\r\nalmost invariably went upon half-pay or looked for employment in some\r\ncivil or semi-civil capacity.\r\n\r\nConcerning the equipment of the officer, his baggage, his horses and\r\nmules, and his servants, information will be found in another chapter.\r\nHere we are dealing with him as an item in the machinery of the\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nINTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF THE REGIMENT: THE RANK AND FILE\r\n\r\n\r\nHe who would make himself acquainted in detail with the many\r\nexperiments by which British Governments, from the rupture of the Peace\r\nof Amiens onward, strove to keep on foot in full numbers the very large\r\narmy that it had raised, must satisfy his curiosity by studying the\r\nadmirable volumes of Mr. Fortescue. Here we are concerned only with\r\nthe methods which prevailed from 1809 till 1814, and gave Wellington\r\nthe invincible, though often attenuated, battalions which conquered at\r\nTalavera and Bussaco, at Salamanca and Toulouse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Volunteers from the Militia]\r\n\r\nIn the Peninsular Army the system of territorial names prevailed for\r\nnearly all the regiments of the line, but in most cases the local\r\ndesignation had no very close relation with the actual _provenance_ of\r\nthe men. There were a certain number of regiments that were practically\r\nnational, _e.g._ most of the Highland battalions, and nearly all of\r\nthe Irish ones, were very predominantly Highland and Irish as to\r\ntheir rank and file: but even in the 79th or the 88th there was a\r\ncertain sprinkling of English recruits. And in some nominally Scottish\r\nregiments like the 71st Highland Light Infantry, or the 90th Perthshire\r\nVolunteers,[213] the proportion of English and Irish was very large.\r\nSimilarly in almost all the nominally English regiments there was a\r\nlarge sprinkling of Irish, and a few Scots. This came partly from the\r\nfact that, though the corps recruited in their own districts, yet they\r\nwere often allowed to send recruiting parties to great centres like\r\nLondon, Bristol, Liverpool, Glasgow, or Dublin. But still more was it\r\ndue to the fact that the larger half of the recruits were raised not in\r\nthe old normal fashion, but by volunteering from the embodied militia,\r\nand that in this system practically no attempt was made to confine\r\nthe choice of militiamen wishing to join the regular army to their\r\nterritorial regiment. Nothing, for example, was more usual than to\r\nfind such things as 100 of the King’s County Militia joining the 31st\r\nor Huntingdonshire Regiment. When the 77th or East Middlesex Regiment\r\nreturned from India in 1808, it was completed, before going out to the\r\nPeninsula, from the 1st West York, North and South Mayo, Northampton,\r\nand South Lincoln Militia, but did not get a single man from the\r\nMiddlesex Militia.[214] The Shropshire Regiment (53rd) when allowed in\r\na similar case to call for volunteers, did get 99 from its own county\r\nmilitia, but 144 more from the Dorset, East York, and Montgomery local\r\ncorps.[215] The 81st or Loyal Lincoln was filled up in 1808, before\r\nsailing for Portugal, from the Dublin, King’s County, South Devon, and\r\nMontgomery Militia. Instances might be multiplied _ad nauseam_. It was\r\nquite exceptional for any English corps to contain a preponderance of\r\nmen from its own nominal district, and nearly all of them had from a\r\nfifth to a fourth of Irish.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to exaggerate the advantage to the Peninsular Army\r\nof the system, the invention of Castlereagh when War Minister, which\r\nenabled it to draw in such a heavy proportion on the militia for\r\nrecruits.[216] The men thus obtained had all had at least twelve\r\nmonths’ drill and discipline, in a corps which had been under arms for\r\nmany years: they were trained soldiers of some little experience, much\r\nsuperior in fact to the recruits who had been procured in other ways.\r\nThe permanent militia represented the force raised by the counties by\r\nballot, though substitutes rather than principals were procured by\r\nthat device. Being forced to serve at home for a period of years, the\r\nmilitiamen freely volunteered into the line, from love of adventure,\r\ndislike of dull country quarters in England or Ireland,[217] and,\r\nit must be added, the temptation of the enormous bounty, running at\r\nvarious times from £16 up to £40, which was given to those changing\r\ntheir service.[218]\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to make a point, as some writers have done, of the fact\r\nthat many regiments appeared in Spain with their ranks “full of raw\r\nmilitiamen, who sometimes still bore their old militia badges on their\r\nknapsacks.” So far from their being ineligible recruits, they were the\r\nvery best, for the militia of 1808–14 was not a body called out for\r\nshort service during one month of the year, but a permanent institution\r\nwhich practically formed a second line to the field army. And no man\r\nwas allowed to volunteer into the regulars till he had served a full\r\nyear in the local corps in which he had enlisted. A regiment must get\r\ndrafts on active service, and these were the very best sort that could\r\nbe obtained. Of course a corps filled up hastily with a great number\r\nof them, would want a little time to shake down, but it would take\r\nfar longer to assimilate a corresponding number of ordinary recruits,\r\nhurried out from its regimental depôt—for these men would neither\r\nhave had a whole year’s drill, nor would they have been accustomed to\r\nthe daily economy of a full regiment—depôts seem to have been slackly\r\nadministered, in many cases by officers and sergeants invalided and\r\npast service, or who had of their own desire shirked the service at the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Normal Recruit]\r\n\r\nThe other moiety of the recruits who came out to the Peninsula, to\r\nfill up the never-ending gaps in the ranks of a battalion at the\r\nfront, were on the whole worse material than the militiamen. They\r\nwere the usual raw stuff swept in by the recruiting sergeant—all\r\nthose restless spirits who were caught by the attraction of the red\r\ncoat, country lads tired of the plough, or town lads who lived on the\r\nedge of unemployment, and to whom a full stomach had been for some\r\ntime a rarity. We have autobiographies of runaway apprentices who\r\nhad bolted from a hard master,[219] and of village Lotharios who had\r\nevaded an entanglement by a timely evasion.[220] Sons of hard fathers,\r\nand stepsons of intolerable stepmothers drifted in, and still more\r\nfrequently the rowdy spirits who were “wanted” by the constable for\r\nassault and battery, or for some rural practical joke which had set the\r\nparish in an uproar. The oddest cause of enlisting that I have come\r\nupon is that of a son of a respectable Edinburgh tradesman’s family,\r\nwhose account of the fortunes of the 71st in 1808–15 is one of the best\r\nwritten of all the soldier-biographies. A stage-struck youth with a\r\nlittle money in his pocket, he had often gone on (no doubt as a super)\r\nat the Theatre Royal, carrying a banner or a five-word message. At last\r\nthe summit of his ambition came—a friendly manager gave him a short\r\npart, where he had actually some share in the action. He invited all\r\nhis friends to the performance to see his glory, came on the boards,\r\nand was suddenly struck with stage fright, so that he stood gaping and\r\nsilent before the audience, and heard the laughter and hooting begin.\r\nThe poor wretch bolted straight away from the stage in his costume\r\nand paint, ran down to Leith, and enlisted with a sergeant of the\r\n71st, whose party was sailing that night for the South. Anything was\r\npreferable to him rather than to face next morning the jeers of the\r\nfriends to whom he had boasted of his histrionic powers, and who had\r\ncome to see his début.[221]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Undesirable Recruits]\r\n\r\nBut these were the better spirits. There was a much lower stratum\r\namong the recruits, drawn from the criminal or semi-criminal classes,\r\nwhom the enormous bounty offered for volunteers had tempted into\r\nthe service—generally with the purpose of getting out of it again\r\nas soon as possible. Not only were there poachers, smugglers, and\r\nstreet-corner roughs, who had been offered by the local authorities\r\nthe choice between enlistment and the jail, but pickpockets, coiners,\r\nand footpads, who had made London or some other great town too hot\r\nfor them, often enlisted as a _pis aller_, intending to desert and\r\n“jump another bounty” when they could. But sergeants were lynx-eyed\r\nwhen they found that they had enlisted a slippery customer, and the\r\nevasive recruit often found himself kept under lock and key in a fort,\r\nand shipped off to Spain before he got his opportunity to abscond. The\r\nnumber of these “King’s hard bargains” varied much between different\r\nregiments, but Colborne, a good authority, says that the battalion was\r\nlucky which had not its fifty irreclaimable bad characters, drunkards,\r\nplunderers, stragglers, would-be deserters, actual criminals “whom\r\nneither punishment nor any kind of discipline could restrain; for the\r\nsystem of recruiting was defective and radically bad.”[222] It was this\r\nscum, a small proportion of the whole, but always swimming to the top\r\nwhen there was mischief to be done—peasants to be plundered or churches\r\nto be pillaged—that provided the subject-matter for court-martials,\r\nand engrossed the majority of the attention of the Provost Marshal.\r\nOfficers of undoubted humanity, and men in the ranks who knew what they\r\nwere talking about, unite in stating that there was a residuum in the\r\nPeninsular Army which could only be governed by the lash.\r\n\r\nThis small percentage of irreclaimables provided the nucleus around\r\nwhich misconduct sometimes grew to a great scale, in moments of\r\nspecial privation or temptation. In abominable orgies like the sack of\r\nBadajoz, or the lesser but still disgraceful riots at Ciudad Rodrigo\r\nand San Sebastian, it was the criminals who started the game, but the\r\ndrunkards—a far more numerous class—who took it up. When the drink\r\nwas in them, the mob was capable of any freak of wanton mischief or\r\ncruelty. Wellington more than once complained that the most reckless\r\nand ungovernable of his rowdies were the newly-joined Irish recruits.\r\nIt seems that when in liquor they became irresponsible madmen, and\r\nhad not undergone enough of discipline to get them into a habit of\r\nobedience, which might serve as a substitute for moral sense. And I can\r\nwell believe this from casual evidence picked up in the diaries of his\r\nobscure subordinates. The account of the difficulties of officers and\r\nsergeants in getting a large draft of Irish recruits from Cashel to\r\nDeal, which I met in one soldier-diary reads like a nightmare[223]—or\r\na glimpse of some primitive pagan heaven, in which all was objectless\r\nfighting in the intervals between frequent and limitless potations.\r\nAs a side-light on the national failing, I may quote the fact that\r\ngoing through the complete record of general court-martials for the\r\nwhole period 1809–14, I found that after putting aside all trials of\r\nofficers, non-combatants, and foreign auxiliaries (the last almost\r\nalways for desertion) there was an unmistakable over-percentage of men\r\nwith Irish names, just as there was an under-percentage of Scots. The\r\noffences for which the former were tried were generally desertion and\r\ncrimes of violence, plundering or maltreating the peasantry.[224]\r\n\r\nThe way in which the habitually criminal element makes itself visible\r\nin this list of court-martials is in the not infrequent cases of\r\nscientific and habitual burglary, robbery of the convoys going to\r\nthe military chest, or of the private property of officers, and the\r\nstealing of church plate—all offences often punished with death, for\r\nWellington rarely pardoned the professional thief, though he sometimes\r\nlet off a deserter with a sound flogging. But the queerest glimpse\r\ninto the lowest stratum of the army is the curious anecdote recorded\r\nin Napier’s fifth volume. Nonplussed in the winter of 1813–14 by the\r\nrefusal of the French peasantry to accept the dollars or the guineas\r\nwhich were all that he could offer, Wellington determined to set up\r\na mint of his own, which should melt down Spanish and Portuguese\r\nsilver and recoin it in the form of five franc pieces. He sent private\r\nappeals to the colonels to find him all the professional coiners that\r\nthey could discover in the ranks, collected as many as forty at St.\r\nJean de Luz, and with their aid struck a large quantity of money, of\r\nwhich he was careful to see that the weight and the purity were both\r\ncorrect.[225]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Gentleman-Ranker]\r\n\r\nOccasionally the gentleman-ranker was to be found in a Peninsular\r\nregiment. He was generally an “undesirable,” who had enlisted in\r\nconsequence of some disgraceful quarrel with a family who had refused\r\nto do anything more for him. Persistent drink, gambling, or dishonesty\r\nwere the usual causes that had broken him—not undeserved misfortune or\r\ndire poverty. Occasionally he pulled himself together, became a good\r\nsoldier, and was ultimately promoted to a commission. More often he\r\nsank into a persistent drunkard or a criminal. Surtees of the 95th,\r\nin an interesting chapter, gives the biographies of the four privates\r\nof this class that he had known.[226] One conducted himself well for\r\nsome years, became a paymaster-sergeant, and then broke out into a\r\nwild fit of dissipation, embezzled the company’s money, and committed\r\nsuicide on detection. The second was always in scrapes: finally he was\r\ncaught deserting to the French, and was lucky to get off with penal\r\nservitude for life instead of death. The third, “always excessively\r\nwild,” was once made a corporal, but was not fit for that or any other\r\nrank. The fourth was one of the exceptional cases—being a retired\r\nlieutenant without friends or means, who had enlisted as a private in\r\nsheer poverty. He was an exemplary and deserving man, who was soon made\r\nsecretary, or private clerk, to his colonel, behaved excellently, and\r\nwas in the end restored to his former rank in the army by interest made\r\nin his behalf.\r\n\r\nA regiment on Peninsular service depended for its strength on the\r\nregularity with which it was fed from its home-battalion or its depôt.\r\nWhenever a convoy sailed from Spithead, it contained an immense number\r\nof small detachments, varying from a few scores to over a hundred men,\r\nunder charge of officers newly gazetted to the service battalion, or\r\nreturning from sick leave. There was often much wrangling on shipboard\r\n(unless the weather reduced every one to the same level of nausea\r\nand helplessness), not only between the men but between the young\r\nofficers in charge of them. After an angry comparison of the exact\r\ndate of commissions, which settled seniority in the choice of berths,\r\nand in dealing with the transport-captain, two ensigns in charge of\r\ndetachments would often settle down to a feud destined to last for the\r\nwhole voyage to Lisbon. Their men gleefully joined in the wrangle.\r\nThere are some absurd sidelights, in court-martials, on these frequent\r\nshipboard quarrels, which sometimes ended in affrays and “conduct\r\nunbecoming an officer and a gentleman.”\r\n\r\nWhen a detachment landed at Lisbon, the officer in charge, often\r\na lad of sixteen, had to shepherd his flock to the front, perhaps\r\nover 200 miles of mountain roads. Neither officers nor men knew a\r\nword of Portuguese, or had the slightest notion of the manners,\r\ngovernment, prejudices, or food of the peasantry. They went forward\r\nin a perpetual haze of mistakes and misunderstandings. Every draft\r\nhad its percentage of undesirables, or even of criminals. Hence the\r\nyoung officer, responsible for their safe delivery at the front, found\r\nhimself embroiled in constant disputes with the natives, often ending\r\nin his arrest on his final arrival at headquarters. We must feel\r\nnothing but sympathy for the unfortunate young man who delivered only\r\ntwenty-nine out of a detachment of forty-one entrusted to him; or the\r\nother who found that fourteen men out of twenty had privately disposed\r\nof their new blankets.[227] The only way of managing the draft was by\r\nreliance on the sergeant or two who formed a part of it: and if the\r\nsergeant was himself a sluggard or a tippler, ill fared his superior.\r\nImagine the feelings of the second-lieutenant who having left his\r\none non-commissioned officer behind, to hunt up footsore stragglers,\r\nfound no one arrive at the nightly billet, and returning for miles to\r\nseek the lost ones, discovered his sergeant dead drunk and snoring in\r\nthe middle of the high-road.[228] Ability to conduct a draft to the\r\nbattalion was one of the greatest tests of the character and capacity\r\nof a junior officer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Concerning Sergeants]\r\n\r\nThe responsibility of the non-commissioned officer cannot be\r\nexaggerated. It was easy to make sergeants, but not easy to secure them\r\nof the proper quality. Too often the man promoted for an act of courage\r\nor of quick cleverness had to be reduced to the ranks again, for some\r\nhopeless failing—he was prone to drink,[229] or he was an over-harsh or\r\nan over-slack administrator of discipline. One of the commoner types of\r\ncourt-martial was that of the non-commissioned officer who connived at\r\nand profited by the misdeeds of the men under his charge—whose silence\r\nwas bought by a percentage, when peasants were plundered, or convoys\r\nlightened of food, shoes, or clothing. It was often difficult to get at\r\nhim—to prove that he had known of what was going on, and had contrived\r\nto see nothing. But the numbers of reductions to the ranks were\r\nnotable, and lashes were often added when part of the _corpus delicti_\r\nwas found in the sergeant’s pack.\r\n\r\nHowever, the ideal sergeant was not unfrequently found, and when\r\nfound he was invaluable; he had to be a steady man with a modicum of\r\neducation and a sense of duty, who could be relied upon neither to\r\nconnive at his men’s graver faults, nor, on the other hand, to be\r\nperpetually spying on them and reporting them to their captains for\r\nevery minute breach of discipline. Tact was as necessary as the power\r\nto get orders carried out. The bullying sergeant would, in the end,\r\nget left in some quandary or dilemma by the men that he was always\r\nharrying, while the considerate sergeant would get the benefit of his\r\npopularity by receiving loyal and intelligent service instead of mere\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nMost important of all non-commissioned officers was the sergeant-major,\r\nconcerning whose position I cannot do better than quote the homily of a\r\nHighland soldier more given to philosophical disquisitions than most of\r\nthe diarists from the ranks.[230]\r\n\r\n“The sergeant-major has an arduous duty to perform; in all the\r\narrangements of regimental duty he takes, or ought to take, the most\r\nactive concern. He has, of course, been considered by his colonel a\r\nmeritorious man, before he appoints him to this highest step to which\r\na non-commissioned officer can attain: and, as it is frequently found\r\nnecessary to consult him on the interior economy of the regiment, if\r\nhe is possessed of any talents they are sure to be seen and called\r\nforth. Fortunate is the regiment which possess a good sergeant-major.\r\nHis rank is not such as to make him above associating with and advising\r\nthe other non-commissioned officers: his own personal example is\r\nthe means of swaying their actions: he cautions them against unjust\r\noppression, yet shrinks not from pointing out the cases which require\r\ncoercive measures. He recommends for promotion those who meritoriously\r\naspire to rise from the ranks. His commanding officer is seldom\r\ntroubled with complaints, for he settles them to the satisfaction of\r\nthe accuser and accused. No mercenary motive actuates his conduct\r\nin reconciling differences, and his hands are never soiled with the\r\ngift of an inferior. To those who are unacquainted with the influence\r\nwhich sergeant-majors generally possess this may seem a hyperbole;\r\nbut to me it appears a fact; I speak not of one regiment but of many.\r\nA sergeant-major, on the other hand, can be a little tyrant in the\r\ncorps, without the knowledge of his colonel: his unnecessary acts of\r\noppression may be made to appear to his superiors as laudable zeal, and\r\nhis severity as merit deserving reward.... If the commanding officer\r\nbe of an easy, complying turn, or again of a repulsive, haughty,\r\n_don’t-trouble-me_ disposition, and the adjutant (which is often the\r\ncase) not over well informed, the sergeant-major is consulted on all\r\noccasions. His opinion is asked as to character, he can establish or\r\ninjure at pleasure, for who will be called in to contradict him? In\r\nshort he has much more to say between the non-commissioned officers\r\nand the colonel, concerning the poor soldiers’ conduct, than all the\r\ncaptains and subalterns of the regiment.”[231]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sergeant’s Self-Respect]\r\n\r\nThe gap between the sergeant and the men in the ranks was necessarily a\r\nwell-marked one. The non-commissioned officers kept together and formed\r\nmesses of their own. “Pride and propriety” kept them from joining in\r\nthe carouses of the rank and file. “He who has once joined the company\r\nof sergeants is disincluded for any other,”[232] writes one veteran\r\nproud of well-deserved promotions. The non-commissioned officer who was\r\ntoo familiar with his inferiors was generally one of those who profited\r\nby their misdeeds, and would some day be convicted of sharing their\r\nplunder, or conniving at their excesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE AUXILIARIES: THE GERMANS AND THE PORTUGUESE\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the two classes of foreign troops which assisted to make up the\r\ninvincible divisions of the Peninsular Army, the one formed at the\r\ntime an integral part of the British military establishment; the other\r\nwas the contingent of an allied Power, placed at the disposition of\r\nWellington, and incorporated with the units of his host, but preserving\r\nits own national individuality.\r\n\r\nWe must deal with the first class before we proceed to explain the\r\nposition of the second. Copying old British precedent, the governments\r\nof George III. had taken into pay a number of foreign corps from the\r\nvery commencement of the Revolutionary War. They were the successors of\r\nthe Hanoverians against whom the elder Pitt had railed so fiercely in\r\nhis hot youth, and of the Hessians who had taken such a prominent part\r\nin the War of American Independence.\r\n\r\nThe regiments raised in the early years of the great struggle with\r\nFrance had mainly been composed of Swiss, or of French royalist\r\n_emigrés_. Most of these corps had disappeared by 1809, and of those\r\nof them which survived the majority were doing garrison duty in the\r\nMediterranean and elsewhere.[233] Wellington never had them under his\r\nhand. The foreign troops which came under his command were nearly all\r\nGerman, and consisted of regiments raised after the rupture of the\r\nPeace of Amiens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The King’s German Legion]\r\n\r\nBy far the largest number of them belonged to that admirable corps the\r\nKing’s German Legion, whose history was written with great care and\r\nenthusiasm by Ludlow Beamish, while the generation which fought in the\r\nPeninsula was still alive. They were the legitimate representatives of\r\nthe old Electoral army of Hanover, the comrades of the British troops\r\nin many a fight of the War of the Austrian Succession and of the Seven\r\nYears’ War. When in June, 1803, Napoleon invaded Hanover, and overran\r\nit with the troops of Mortier, the 15,000 men who formed the standing\r\narmy of the electorate could make no effective resistance. They laid\r\ndown their arms in accordance with the Convention of Lauenburg (July\r\n5, 1803), which disbanded them, and permitted officers and men to go\r\nwhere they pleased, with the proviso that none of them would bear arms\r\nagainst France till they should have been exchanged for French officers\r\nor men in the hands of the English Government.[234]\r\n\r\nThe best and most loyal of the Hanoverian officers began at once\r\nto betake themselves to England, and by the end of the year were\r\nstreaming thither by dozens and scores. Men soon began to follow in\r\nconsiderable numbers, and after two provisional infantry regiments had\r\nbeen formed in August, a larger organization, to be called the King’s\r\nGerman Legion, was authorized in December. It included light and line\r\ninfantry, heavy and light cavalry, artillery and engineers. All through\r\n1804 new units were being rapidly created, mainly from Hanoverians, but\r\nnot entirely, for other recruits of German nationality were accepted.\r\nBut all the officers, nearly all the sergeants, and the large majority\r\nof the rank and file came from the old Electoral army. By January,\r\n1805, there were in existence a dragoon and a hussar regiment, four\r\nLine and two Light battalions, and five batteries of artillery.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1805, when Lord Cathcart’s expedition sailed for the\r\nWeser, to make a diversion in favour of Austria, the whole German\r\nLegion went with him. For a few short weeks the invaders were in\r\npossession of Bremen and Verden, Stade, and Hanover city, before\r\nthe news of the disastrous peace that followed Austerlitz came to\r\nhand. During this space immense numbers of Hanoverians flocked to\r\nthe colours, some old soldiers, others volunteers who had not served\r\nbefore. When the army evacuated Hanover in February, 1806, it brought\r\nback so many recruits that the Legion was raised to ten battalions of\r\ninfantry and five regiments of horse.\r\n\r\nThese were almost the last genuine Hanoverians that were raised for\r\nservice in the corps, for when the electorate was annexed to Jerome\r\nBonaparte’s “Kingdom of Westphalia,” it became part of the French\r\nImperial system, and was subjected to the conscription for Jerome’s\r\nservice. Only a few individuals henceforth succeeded in getting to\r\nEngland and joining the Legion by circuitous ways. But there were\r\nsome good recruits obtained at Stralsund and in Denmark during the\r\nCopenhagen Expedition at the end of 1807, when the Legion was for some\r\nweeks in the Baltic.\r\n\r\nThe battalions and squadrons were still mainly Hanoverian, when, in\r\n1808, the larger half of them was sent to the Peninsula. In that year\r\none Hussar regiment (the 3rd), two Light and four Line battalions (Nos.\r\n1, 2, 5, 7), landed in Portugal. Of these only the two Light battalions\r\nand the Hussars marched with Moore, and re-embarked for England after\r\nhis disastrous retreat. The four Line battalions remained in Portugal,\r\nas did two German batteries, and made part of Wellesley’s original\r\narmy of 1809. They were joined in the spring of that year by the 1st\r\nHussars, who (as has been already mentioned) were considered the most\r\nefficient light cavalry regiment in Portugal, and were long the chosen\r\ncomrades of Craufurd’s Light Division.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recruiting the K.G.L.]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1811 the K.G.L. contingent in Portugal was increased\r\nby the 2nd Hussars and the two Light Battalions, who returned about two\r\nyears after their departure in the company of Moore. In the winter of\r\n1811–12 the two heavy dragoon regiments joined Wellington’s army. Thus\r\nin the beginning of 1812 four of the five cavalry regiments, and five\r\n(the 7th Line battalion had gone home) of the ten infantry battalions\r\nwere serving in Spain. But at the end of the year the 2nd Hussars were\r\ndrafted back to England, owing to depleted numbers.\r\n\r\nIt had now become impossible to keep the ranks of the Legion filled\r\nwith the genuine Hanoverians who had been its original nucleus.\r\nCommunication with the electorate was completely cut off, and German\r\nrecruits of any kind had to be accepted. Many of them were volunteers\r\nfrom the English prison camps, where thousands of Napoleon’s German\r\ntroops were lying. Of these only a fraction were Hanoverians born.\r\nThe large majority could not, of course, share in the loyalty and\r\nenthusiasm of the original legionaries, being subjects of all manner of\r\nsovereigns in the Rheinbund, who had marched at Napoleon’s orders. The\r\nquality of men was much worse, and many enlisted only to escape from\r\nprison life, and readily deserted when they reached the front, having\r\nno interest in the cause for which they were fighting. From 1811 onward\r\ndesertion, not at all usual in the early years of the Legion, became\r\nvery common, and plunder and misconduct (previously very rare) were\r\nalso rife. Matters became still worse when, later in the war, German\r\nrecruits of any sort became so hard to obtain that Poles, Illyrians,\r\nand miscellaneous foreigners of any sort[235] were drafted out to\r\nfill the shrinking ranks. But the splendid Hanoverian officers still\r\ncontinued to get good service out of a rank and file that was no longer\r\nso homogeneous or loyal as it had been when the war began, and the\r\nregiments of the German Legion, the cavalry in especial, continued to\r\nbe among Wellington’s most trusted troops. The charge of Bock’s Heavy\r\nDragoons at Garcia Hernandez, on the day after Salamanca, was, as has\r\nbeen already stated, considered by Foy to have been the most brilliant\r\nand successful cavalry attack made in the whole Peninsular War. After\r\nthe peace of 1814 all the “mongrels” were discharged, and the officers\r\nand native-born Hanoverian rank and file became the nucleus on which\r\nthe new Royal Army of Hanover was built up. The fact that the aliens\r\nhad been discharged in 1814 was the cause of all the K.G.L. battalions\r\nappearing at Waterloo in the following year with very small effectives,\r\nin no case reaching 500 of all ranks.\r\n\r\nAnother foreign corps which served under Wellington from the end of\r\n1810 till 1814 had an origin and a history much resembling that of the\r\nGerman Legion. This was the Brunswick Oels Jägers, whose history starts\r\nfrom 1809. The hard-fighting Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick, the\r\nnephew of George III., had made a gallant diversion in Northern Germany\r\nduring the Wagram Campaign. At the head of a small body of adventurers,\r\nhe had thrown himself into the middle of Jerome Bonaparte’s Kingdom\r\nof Westphalia, and had stirred up an insurrection there, particularly\r\nin his own old hereditary states. He was joined by several thousands\r\nof patriotic volunteers, and inflicted a series of small defeats on\r\nthe Westphalians. But surrounded in the end by overwhelming numbers\r\nof enemies, he cut his way to the sea, and embarked the remnants of\r\nhis followers aboard English ships at Brake on the Frisian coast.\r\nThe British Government at once offered to take the refugees into its\r\nservice, and from them organized the Brunswick Oels Jäger and Hussar\r\nregiments, whose black uniform reproduced that of the duke’s old\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Brunswick Oels Jägers]\r\n\r\nThe kernel of this corps was originally excellent—the officers were\r\nNorth-Germans, largely Prussians, who had risked their lives by joining\r\nan insurrection contrary to the orders of their sovereign, and could\r\nnever return to their homes: while the rank and file had been patriotic\r\nvolunteers. But, like the German Legion, the Brunswick regiment could\r\nfind no more recruits of this sort when it had left Germany, and soon\r\nhad to depend for the continuance of its existence on the men in the\r\nEnglish prison camps, who could be induced to buy a release from\r\nconfinement by enlisting in the British service. It is clear that the\r\nGerman Legion got the best of these turncoats, and that the worst fell\r\nto the lot of the Brunswick corps. Not only Germans but Poles, Swiss,\r\nDanes, Dutch, and Croats were drafted into it. They were a motley crew,\r\nmuch given to desertion—on several occasions large parties went off\r\ntogether. One great court-martial in 1811 sat on ten Brunswick Oels\r\ndeserters in a body, and ordered four to be shot and the rest to be\r\nflogged. Such men had all the vices of the mercenary, though in time of\r\nbattle they displayed many of the virtues. Their officers had a hard\r\ntask to keep them together, and they could never be trusted at the\r\noutposts. But the regiment was full of good shots and bold adventurers,\r\nand furnished several of the detached rifle companies with which\r\nWellington strengthened the light infantry of his brigades.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one foreign regiment which was even more tiresome\r\nto manage than the Black Brunswickers. This was the _Chasseurs\r\nBritanniques_, a corps formed early in the Revolutionary War from\r\nFrench royalists, and taken into the British Service in 1801. It was\r\nrecruited entirely from deserters of all sorts when it came out to\r\nPortugal in the spring of 1811. At absconding it was far worse than\r\nthe Brunswickers—the latter were raised from many races, but at least\r\nthey were not born Frenchmen as were the most important section of the\r\nChasseurs. A glance down the names of the rank and file of the corps\r\nseems to show that after Frenchmen the next most important section\r\nwere Italians, and that there were a few Poles and some Swiss, the\r\nlatter supplying the men with Teutonic names. It seems to have been\r\nthe working rule with the officers who accepted volunteers from the\r\nprison-camps to draft French and Italians into the Chasseurs, while\r\nGermans of all sorts went into the Legion or the Brunswick Corps,\r\nand Swiss partly into the Chasseurs, partly into Watteville’s old\r\nSwiss regiment: Poles and Croats went anywhere. Now a German prisoner\r\nwho volunteered into the British service might do so from patriotic\r\nmotives, and make an excellent soldier. A Swiss or an Italian or an\r\nIllyrian could not be very heavily blamed for desertion—he had been\r\nconscribed, and sent to fight for Napoleon, in a quarrel that was\r\nnot his own. But the French deserter was no longer an old royalist,\r\nlike the _emigré_ soldiers of 1794, but one of two things. Either he\r\nwas a man who enlisted in the Chasseurs simply to get a chance of\r\ndeserting back to his own friends, or else he was a _mauvais sujet_,\r\na man without patriotic feeling or morality, who was ready to fight\r\nagainst his own countrymen for pay or plunder. Both classes were amply\r\nrepresented: the former fled back to the French ranks when they could,\r\noften taking valuable information with them. The latter were the worst\r\nclass of mercenaries, since they had no inspiring cause to keep them\r\ntrue to their colours, while individually they were for the most part\r\nbad characters who had been the curse of their regiments while in the\r\nFrench service.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chasseurs Britanniques]\r\n\r\nThe unenviable task of keeping together this body of deserters and\r\nadventurers fell to a body of officers who were almost without\r\nexception furious French royalists, the second generation of the\r\n_emigrés_. They looked upon the war with Bonaparte as a family feud,\r\nin which they fought under any colours (many of their kin were in the\r\nRussian or the Austrian, or the Spanish service) in order to avenge the\r\ndeath of Louis XVI., the atrocities of the Terror, or the Massacres\r\nof Quiberon. With old loyalty to the Bourbons, and personal hatred\r\nfor the new French _régime_ as their inspiration, they were fierce\r\nand desperate fighters. They kept the miscellaneous horde committed\r\nto their charge under an iron discipline, and used the lash freely.\r\nAll that their personal courage could accomplish was done, to make\r\nthe Chasseurs an efficient fighting force. But they could not stop\r\ndesertion, nor frequent misconduct. The most astonishing court-martial\r\nin the war was that held on October 5, 1812, upon no less than 18\r\nChasseurs who had deserted in a body, two corporals and 16 men, of whom\r\nall but two bore Italian names.[236] This was only the largest case of\r\na constant series of defections. The regiment melted away whenever it\r\ncame near the French lines, and Wellington had a standing order that it\r\nmust never be trusted with the outposts. Yet as a fighting body it had\r\nno bad record—as witness Fuentes de Oñoro and many other fields. This\r\nwas the work of the zealous service of its officers—and was indeed a\r\nwonderful _tour de force_. The material with which they had to work was\r\ndetestable.\r\n\r\nThese were the only foreign corps, strictly speaking, in Wellington’s\r\narmy, but there were two more units which had a large, indeed a\r\npreponderating, German element in them, though they were numbered\r\nin the British line. These were the 5/60th, the rifle battalion of\r\nthe “Royal Americans,” and the 97th, a single-battalion corps which\r\nstarted its existence as Stuart’s “Minorca Regiment,” but got a place\r\nin the British line in 1804 as the “Queen’s Germans.” Neither of these\r\nbattalions were purely German either in officers or men: of the 5/60th\r\nthe disembarkation roll on its original landing in Portugal shows\r\neighteen officers with German and ten with British names.[237] The\r\ncolonel, De Rottenbourg, was a foreigner, but the second in command,\r\nDavy, an Englishman. The British element was not proportionally so\r\nstrong in the rank and file at the commencement of the war, but was\r\napparently increasing as it went on. English and Irish recruits were\r\ndrafted in, in order that such a fine corps might not be spoilt with\r\nthe bad class of German recruit such as was alone procurable in 1812 or\r\n1813. When the corps returned from the Peninsula in 1814 it had only\r\nnine officers with German names and twelve with British, and I fancy\r\nthe balance in the rank and file between the nationalities had changed\r\nin the same way. When amalgamated with the 1/60th, after the end of the\r\nwar it had certainly 400 British to something under 300 Germans in its\r\nranks.\r\n\r\nThis was a most distinguished corps: the green-coated rifle companies\r\nwhich it supplied to many brigades of the Peninsular Army were\r\nuniversally praised for their cool courage and admirable marksmanship.\r\nThe battalion had very few deserters save for one period in 1808–9,\r\nwhen it had received a batch of recruits from Junot’s Army of Portugal,\r\nwho proved unsatisfactory. It would be an absolute insult to the 5/60th\r\nto class them with the Brunswickers or the Chasseurs Britanniques.\r\n\r\nThe 97th being a single-battalion corps, with nothing to maintain\r\nit but a depôt which could only collect German recruits in the same\r\nfashion as the K.G.L., wasted down to a very small remnant after two\r\nyears of war, and was sent back to England in 1811, with a handsome\r\nepitaph of praise by Wellington. It never got to the front again,\r\nremained at home on a very weak establishment, and was disbanded at the\r\nend of the war. Like the 5/60th it was not wholly German; among the\r\nofficers we find individuals with British names like Carter, Biscoe,\r\nWilson, Lyon. Its colonel and one of its two majors were English, and\r\nthere was a proportion of non-Germans among its rank and file. Its\r\nPeninsular record if short was distinguished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Portuguese Army in 1809]\r\n\r\nIt remains to speak about the Portuguese, who formed about two-fifths\r\nof Wellington’s fighting force. We have already had occasion to\r\nspeak of the way in which they were distributed among the British\r\ntroops, when dealing with the character of Beresford,[238] and the\r\ncomposition of the Peninsular divisions.[239] But the inner mechanism\r\nof the Portuguese army remains to be detailed. It consisted in 1809 of\r\ntwenty-four regiments of infantry of the line, each of two battalions,\r\nsave the 21st which had been cut up at Soult’s storm of Oporto in\r\nMarch, and only mustered one.[240] There were also six light infantry\r\nbattalions of caçadores, all raised in 1808–9, and twelve weak\r\nregiments of horse. The artillery, divided into four local regiments\r\nof unequal strength (those of Lisbon, Oporto, Elvas, and Algarve),\r\nsupplied nine or ten field batteries, and a number of garrison\r\ncompanies which manned the guns of Elvas, Almeida, Abrantes, Peniche,\r\nand many other minor fortresses. There was in addition an abnormal\r\ncorps, the Loyal Lusitanian Legion, raised by Sir Robert Wilson at\r\nOporto in 1808, which furnished three battalions of light infantry, a\r\nsquadron of horse and an incomplete battery. This legion, which had\r\ndone very good service in 1809–10, was absorbed into the regular army\r\nin 1811, its three battalions becoming the 7th, 8th, and 9th caçadores.\r\nAt the same time Wellington ordered the raising of three new light\r\nbattalions bearing the numbers 10, 11, and 12.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a Portuguese two-battalion line regiment was\r\nnominally 1540 men, that of a caçador battalion 770 men: they were\r\neach divided into six strong companies. The cavalry regiments, with a\r\nnominal effective of 590 men, seldom showed 300 apiece in the field.\r\nThe infantry corps, with the conscription to keep their ranks full,\r\ncould from 1809 onward generally take the field with over 1200 of all\r\nranks, not including men in hospital or detached, and very seldom\r\nshrank as low as 1000. The caçador battalions were generally somewhat\r\nweaker in proportion to their nominal effective, rarely showing more\r\nthan 500 men in line.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Portuguese Army was made on a strictly local\r\nbasis, each of the twenty-four line regiments having its proper\r\nrecruiting district. Two corps were furnished by the province of\r\nAlgarve, five by the Alemtejo, four by Lisbon city and its surrounding\r\ndistrict, three by the rest of Portuguese Estremadura, four by\r\nthe Beira, four by Oporto and the Entre-Douro-e-Minho, and two by\r\nTras-os-Montes.[241] Some of the recruiting-districts being less\r\npopulous than others, had a greater difficulty in keeping up their\r\nterritorial regiments. This was especially the case with the five corps\r\nof the Alemtejo, where the waste bears a greater proportion to the\r\ninhabited land than in other provinces of Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe caçador battalions were mainly raised in the better peopled north,\r\nwhich supplied not only the three (Nos. 7, 8, 9), formed from the\r\nLusitanian Legion (all raised in and about Oporto), but also numbers 3,\r\n4, 6, and after 1811 the additional numbers 10, 11, 12. The southern\r\nprovinces only provided numbers 1, 2, 5. These brown and dark green\r\nbattalions, whose sombre colours contrasted strongly with the bright\r\nblue and white of the Portuguese line,[242] supplied, along with the\r\ngreen British riflemen, the main skirmishing line of Wellington’s army.\r\nEight of the twelve were raised and commanded by British officers, only\r\nthe remaining four by Portuguese colonels.\r\n\r\nPortugal is not a country abounding in horses, and of the twelve\r\ndragoon regiments of which its cavalry consisted, three (Nos. 2, 3,\r\n12) were never put into the field at all, but utilized as dismounted\r\ntroops in garrison duty. Of the other nine corps several were mere\r\nfragments, and none ever took anything like its establishment of 500\r\nsabres to the front. Three hundred was as much as was usually shown:\r\nin the 1811 campaign the two regiments which Wellington used in the\r\nFuentes de Oñoro campaign had not 450 mounted men between them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beresford’s Work]\r\n\r\nBeresford’s conversion of the disorganized and depleted army of which\r\nhe took the command in 1809 into a serviceable and well-disciplined\r\nforce was a remarkable achievement. He found it in a chaotic\r\nstate—Junot had disbanded the whole, save a few battalions which he\r\nsent to France to serve Napoleon. The regiments had collected again\r\nas best they could, but the cadres were incomplete, and the corps of\r\nofficers left much to be desired. The Portuguese army before 1808 had\r\nall the typical faults of an army of the _ancien régime_ which had\r\nrusted in a long period of peace. It was full of old or incapable\r\nofficers put into place by court intrigues or family influence.\r\nPromotion was irregular and perfectly arbitrary; the lower commissioned\r\nranks of the regiments were choked with officers whose want of\r\neducation and military knowledge made them unfit for higher posts. They\r\nhad often grown grey as lieutenants, and were perfectly useless in a\r\ncrisis. The pay was very low, and the temptation to make up for the\r\nwant of it by petty jobbing and embezzlement too strong.\r\n\r\nWhen Beresford took command, in the early spring of 1809, he had found\r\nabout 30,000 regular troops in arms on an establishment which ought\r\nto have shown nearly 60,000. The deficiency in mere numbers could be\r\nremedied by a stringent use of the conscription: but the deficiencies\r\nof organization could not. Beresford complained that “Long habits of\r\ndisregard of duty, and consequent laziness, made it not only difficult\r\nbut almost impossible to induce many senior officers to enter into any\r\nregular and continued attention to the duties of their situations, and\r\nneither reward nor punishment would induce them to bear up against the\r\nfatigue.”[243] In the lower ranks there was a good deal of zeal, there\r\nbeing great numbers of young officers from the higher classes, who had\r\njust accepted commissions from patriotic motives; but there was also a\r\nheavy dead-weight of old and slack officers, and an appalling want of\r\nprofessional knowledge.\r\n\r\nBeresford made it a condition of accepting his post that he should\r\nbe allowed a free hand to retain, dismiss, or promote, and should\r\nbe permitted to introduce a certain amount of British officers into\r\nthe army. The Regency granted his request, of necessity and not with\r\nenthusiasm. He then proceeded to use his permission with great energy.\r\nA vast number of old officers, both in the higher and lower ranks,\r\nwere put on half pay: only a minority of the colonels and generals\r\nwere retained on active service. All the regiments which had been\r\ncursed with notoriously inefficient commanders were placed in charge\r\nof British officers, of whom four or five were drafted into every\r\nunit. Beresford’s system was that “since national feeling required\r\nmanagement,” and “he must humour and satisfy the pride of the nation,”\r\na sufficient number of the higher places must be left to natives, but\r\neach must have British officers either immediately over or immediately\r\nunder him. Where a Portuguese general commanded a brigade, it was\r\nmanaged that the colonels of his two regiments should both be English.\r\nWhere there was a Portuguese colonel, his senior major was English;\r\nwhere an English colonel, his senior major was Portuguese. In addition\r\nthere were two, three, or four British captains in each regiment, but\r\nhardly any subalterns. For, to encourage good officers to volunteer\r\ninto the Portuguese service, it was provided that every one doing so\r\nshould receive a step in promotion, lieutenants becoming captains, and\r\ncaptains majors. This system seems to have worked well, though friction\r\nwas bound to occur, since the blow to Portuguese national pride, when\r\nso many high posts were given to foreigners, was a heavy one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Portuguese Officers]\r\n\r\nYet according to those who had the working of the newly organized army\r\nin their hands, the effect was very satisfactory. “The Portuguese\r\ncaptains are piqued into activity and attention, when they see their\r\ncompanies excelled in efficiency by those under English, and do from\r\nemulation what a sense of duty would never, perhaps, bring them to.\r\nThere are a variety of oblique means and by-paths by which the parts\r\nof a Portuguese corps are constantly, and almost insensibly, tending\r\nto return to their old habits, to which they are so much attached. To\r\nnip this tendency, from time to time, in the bud, it is necessary to be\r\naware of it: without the constant surveillance of English subordinate\r\nofficers (who ever mingling with the mass of the men cannot but be\r\naware of what is going on) the commanding officer can rarely be warned\r\nin time.”[244] D’Urban, the author of this memorandum, adds that one\r\nof his great difficulties was to secure that the junior officers of\r\nthe old noble families were kept up to their work. “Even supposing\r\na sufficient energy of character in a native officer, he does not,\r\nand will not, unless he be a _fidalgo_ himself, exercise coercive or\r\nstrong measures to oblige one of that class to do his duty. He is aware\r\nthat by doing so he will make a powerful enemy, and all the habits of\r\nthought in which he has been educated inspire him with such a dread of\r\nthis, that no sense of duty will urge him to encounter it. Whenever\r\na regiment is commanded by a non-_fidalgo_ it never fails to suffer\r\nextremely: the noblemen are permitted to do as they please, and set a\r\nvery bad example.” The only remedy was to see that any regiment where\r\nthe _fidalgos_ were numerous had an English colonel.\r\n\r\nSuch were the difficulties under which Beresford and the body of picked\r\nBritish officers whom he selected as his subordinates built up the\r\narmy, which by 1811 was fit to take its place in battle line along with\r\nits allies, and in 1812–14 did some of the most brilliant service of\r\nthe Peninsular War. Some of the exploits of the Portuguese brigades\r\nhardly obtain in Napier’s history the prominence that is their due.\r\nWhile he acknowledges the good service of the Light Division caçadores\r\nat Bussaco and elsewhere, there is scarcely praise enough given to\r\nHarvey’s brigade at Albuera, who received and repulsed _in line_ the\r\ncharge of Latour-Maubourg’s dragoons, a feat of which any British\r\ntroops would have been proud. And the desperate resistance for many\r\nhours of Ashworth’s Portuguese at St. Pierre near Bayonne is hardly\r\nnoticed with sufficient gratitude—forming the centre of Hill’s thin\r\nline, pressed upon by overwhelming numbers, and with both flanks turned\r\nfrom time to time, they fought out a whole long morning of battle, and\r\nnever gave way an inch, though their line was reduced to a thin chain\r\nof skirmishers scattered along a hedge and a coppice. The advance of\r\nthe 13th and 24th Portuguese at the storm of St. Sebastian, across a\r\nford 200 yards wide and waist-deep, swept by artillery fire from end\r\nto end, does however receive from Napier its due meed of admiration.\r\nThis was a great achievement—every wounded man was doomed to drowning:\r\non the other side was the blazing breach, where the British assault\r\nhad come to a dead stop after dreadful slaughter, but the Portuguese\r\nregiments won their way over the deadly water, and took their share in\r\nthe final assault with unflinching courage.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the caçador battalions had the finest record in the\r\nPortuguese Army, the cavalry the least satisfactory. Some good work\r\nis recorded of them, _e.g._ the charge of Madden’s squadrons saved\r\nthe whole of La Romana’s army at the combat of Fuente del Maestre in\r\n1810, and that of D’Urban’s brigade gave efficient help to Pakenham’s\r\ngreat flank attack at Salamanca in 1812. But there were some “untoward\r\nincidents,” such as the general bolt at the battle of the Gebora, and\r\nthe panic at the combat of Majadahonda, just before Wellington’s entry\r\ninto Madrid. Of the last D’Urban writes,[245] “My poor fellows are\r\nstill a most daily and uncertain sort of fighting people. At Salamanca\r\nthey followed me into the enemy’s ranks like British dragoons;\r\nyesterday they were so far from doing their duty that in the first\r\ncharge they just went far enough to land me in the enemy’s ranks. In\r\nthe second, which (having got them rallied) I rashly attempted, I could\r\nnot get them within 20 yards of the enemy—they left me alone, and\r\nvanished before the French helmets like leaves before the autumn wind.\r\nThey require a little incentive of shouts, and the inspiring cheers\r\nof a British line advancing near them. I am afraid they will never be\r\nquite _safe_ by themselves, or in silence.” These are bitter words, but\r\nthe record of Majadahonda is not a creditable one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Portuguese Militia]\r\n\r\nOf the Portuguese militia and the irregular levies of the Ordenança\r\nit is not necessary to speak here at length. They formed part of\r\nWellington’s tools for carrying on the war, but not of his army. For,\r\nexcepting in the Lines of Torres Vedras, he never put the militia\r\nside by side with the regulars, but always left them out in the open\r\ncountry, to watch frontiers or harass French lines of communication.\r\nThey were under strict orders not to fight—orders which enterprising\r\nofficers like Silveira and Trant sometimes disobeyed, to their own\r\nsorrow. Their duty was to screen the countryside against small French\r\ndetachments, to make the movement of the enemy save in large bodies\r\nimpossible, to capture convoys, or to cut off stragglers. Their most\r\nbrilliant exploit was the capture of Masséna’s hospitals at Coimbra in\r\n1810. More could not be expected from levies only intermittently under\r\narms, not furnished with proper uniforms, and officered by civilians,\r\nor by the inefficients weeded out of the regular army. They were a\r\nvaluable asset in Wellington’s hands, but not a real fighting force.\r\nEven far on in the war, so late as 1812, whole brigades of them broke\r\nup in panic in face of a very small force of cavalry—as at the unhappy\r\ncombat of Guarda, where Trant and Wilson tried to do too much with\r\nthese amateurs.\r\n\r\nAs to the ordenança or _levée en masse_, it had not even the\r\norganization of the militia, and was largely armed with pikes for want\r\nof muskets. Its only duty was to infest the countryside and prevent\r\nthe enemy from foraging. The French shot them as “brigands” whenever\r\ncaught; it was their natural practice to retaliate by making away with\r\nall stragglers and marauders who fell into their hands. Wellington\r\noffered a bounty for prisoners, but it was not very often asked for, or\r\npaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nDISCIPLINE AND COURT-MARTIALS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the chapters that dealt with the officers and the men of the\r\nPeninsular Army, we have had occasion to speak of the percentage of\r\nundesirables that were to be found in every rank, and of their special\r\nweaknesses and crimes. It is necessary to explain the way in which the\r\nBritish military code of the day dealt with them.\r\n\r\nFor the officers there was a long gradation of punishments, ranging\r\ndown from a simple reprimand to discharge from the service with\r\nignominy. For the non-commissioned officers reduction to the ranks\r\nwas the most usual chastisement inflicted; but in cases of a\r\nparticularly disgraceful sort, the lash was not infrequently allotted\r\nas an additional penalty. For the rank and file flogging was the\r\nuniversal panacea; the amount of strokes might range up from a\r\nminimum twenty-five strokes—which was a mere nothing to the habitual\r\noffender, but a serious thing for the good soldier who lost much of\r\nhis _morale_ when once he had “gone to the halberds,” even for such a\r\nlight punishment. The maximum, a very unusual one, was 1200 strokes,\r\nan amount calculated to kill many men, and to permanently disable many\r\nmore. But this awful tale of lashes was not very frequently awarded,\r\nbeing reserved for bad cases of desertion to the enemy, robbery with\r\nviolence, or striking an officer, all of them offences which might have\r\nhad death as their punishment. As far as I can count, 1200 lashes were\r\nonly awarded nine or ten times by general court-martial during the\r\nwhole six years of the war. The hardly less severe sentence of 1000\r\nlashes was given more frequently—over 50 cases may be reckoned up—the\r\noffences were the same as those which earned the still heavier maximum\r\namount. During the latter years of the war, from 1811 onward, two\r\nadditional forms of punishment for very serious crimes were invented.\r\nThe first, mainly reserved for deserters who had not gone over to the\r\nenemy, but had simply left the colours and hidden themselves in the\r\nPeninsula, was long service in a colonial corps, such as the African or\r\nthe New South Wales Regiment. The other, a much more severe sentence,\r\nwas that of penal servitude, either for a term of years (seven was the\r\nusual period), or for life. The penal settlement to which the convict\r\nwas sent is generally stated, and is almost invariably New South Wales.\r\nThis sentence was generally awarded for cases of repeated desertion\r\n(not to the enemy) and habitual theft without violence. The moment that\r\nviolence was added to robbery, the offender came within a near distance\r\nof the gallows or of the much-dreaded 1000 lashes—which often had the\r\nsame meaning in the end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cashiering of Officers]\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to give some account of the various causes for\r\nwhich an officer might incur the heaviest penalty that could be laid\r\non him—to be cashiered. This sentence was awarded some thirty times\r\nduring the war. Twice only was it the reward of shirking or cowardice.\r\nIn three or four cases it was inflicted for swindling merchants; in\r\nas many more for embezzling public money or stores. Five or six were\r\ninstances of insulting or openly disobeying a commanding officer. Three\r\nor four cashierings were the direct result of drink—the offender having\r\nbeen found intoxicated and incapable while on duty in a responsible\r\nposition. The most repulsive case of the whole list was one where\r\ndrunkenness was the indirect, but not the actual, cause of disgrace.\r\nThree young officers, at the break up of a debauch, found the corpse\r\nof a priest lying in state in a room in the quarters where two of\r\nthem were lodged. They mishandled it, and cast it forth, stripping\r\noff the vestments, and breaking the candles, etc., with which it was\r\nlaid out.[246] This disgusting freak, apparently caused by drunken\r\nresentment at finding a corpse in close proximity to their bedroom,\r\ndrew down a commentary from Wellington as to the noxious effects of\r\ndrink—which not only makes men incapable of performing their duty, but\r\nrenders them “unaware of the nature or effect of their actions.”\r\n\r\nThe remaining cases of cashiering were for such offences as public\r\nand disgraceful brawling, violently resisting arrest, and flagrant\r\nimmorality.[247] There is just one case of dismissal from the service\r\nfor tyranny—that of a colonel who habitually bullied his officers and\r\ninflicted arbitrary and illegal punishments on his men.[248] Of this I\r\nshall have to say more in its place.\r\n\r\nAll the thirty cashierings cited above are those of combatant\r\nofficers. There are about an equal number of cases in which persons\r\nemployed under the civil departments of the army were dismissed the\r\nservice—commissaries, purveyors, surgeons, hospital mates, etc. In the\r\ncommissariat department (as might have been foreseen) embezzlement\r\nwas the snare to unscrupulous men, often far from the eye of their\r\nsuperior—it was too easy to issue false vouchers as to the number of\r\nmen or horses rationed, or to make corrupt agreements with contractors\r\nor local authorities, certifying that a larger amount of food or forage\r\nhad been supplied than had really been given in. Selling public mules\r\nor horses, and returning them as dead, was another profitable fraud.\r\nTwo non-combatant employés of the army (a paymaster and a conductor of\r\nstores) were “broken” for absconding from the army during the battle of\r\nTalavera, and spreading false reports of disaster in the rear.\r\n\r\nThe medical staff, not nearly such frequent offenders as the\r\ncommissariat staff, are occasionally dismissed the service for brawling\r\nand drunkenness, which last inevitably resulted in the neglect of the\r\nwounded on the march or in hospital.\r\n\r\nAfter cashiering, the next most serious punishment inflicted on an\r\nofficer was suspension from pay and rank for a term of months, six and\r\nthree were the usual periods named. This might be inflicted for any\r\none of a great variety of offences. By far the most frequent fault was\r\nneglect of details of duty, such as quitting the regiment or detachment\r\nfor many hours without leave, allowing a convoy or a draft to straggle,\r\npermitting the rank and file to pull down cottages for firewood, or to\r\nwaste crops, or to fell fruit trees. Sleeping away from the company, in\r\na rather distant house or village, was another frequent misdemeanour.\r\nWe may place second in the category of offences the one that may be\r\ncalled quarrelling with native authorities. Owing to high-handed\r\naction on the one side, and provocative sulkiness on the other, these\r\nwrangles were very common. Officers in charge of detachments fell\r\nout with a _juiz de fora_ or a _corregidor_, or the governor of some\r\npetty garrison, about billets or payments due, and ended by insulting,\r\noccasionally by assaulting, him. This generally cost the offender six\r\nmonths’ suspension, for Wellington was resolved that the officers of\r\nhis army must not override lawful local authority, and sometimes, in\r\nhis comments on a court-martial sentence, asks what would be thought of\r\na lieutenant who should treat in such a fashion the mayor of an English\r\nborough, or the commandant of an English fort.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington and Petty Quarrels]\r\n\r\nThe third list of offences which were usually visited with shorter\r\nor longer “suspension” may be put together under the general head of\r\nrelations of officers to each other. This includes equally oppressive\r\nor insulting acts of superiors to inferiors, and insubordinate conduct\r\nof inferiors to superiors. The latter was far the more common failing,\r\nif the statistics of court-martials may be trusted. But no doubt\r\nallowance must be made for many cases in which a bullied subaltern\r\npreferred to hold his tongue, rather than to appeal against the\r\nacts or language of his captain or colonel—the failure of his case\r\nwould leave him in a very dangerous and unpleasant position for the\r\nfuture. Intemperate language, or “improper” letters from inferiors to\r\nsuperiors, are a not uncommon cause of court-martials. Even colonels\r\noccasionally wrote or spoke in insubordinate terms to generals.[249]\r\nBut “answering back” on the part of subalterns to captains or majors\r\nwas of course far more frequent. Wellington grew, on occasion,\r\nexceedingly wrath at reading the reports of court-martials on petty\r\ncases of this kind. We may give a typical comment.\r\n\r\n“I cannot but consider the transaction which has been the subject\r\nof this court-martial as simply a private quarrel, it has as little\r\nconnection with the public service or the discipline and subordination\r\nof the army, as any that has ever come under my notice. It is certainly\r\ntrue that the private quarrels of officers may be proper subjects for\r\nthe investigation of a court-martial. But the complainant, in order\r\nto obtain a decision in his favour, must come with a fair case. He\r\nmust not himself have been guilty of any breach of the general order\r\nof the army, or of discipline. His authority as a superior must not\r\nhave been exerted over his inferior (of whom he complains) in order\r\nto enjoy the advantage of his own improper conduct. Above all, he\r\nmust have refrained from the use of abusive or improper language and\r\ngestures.”[250]\r\n\r\nAnother comment is—\r\n\r\n“The Commander of the Forces cannot but feel that both his time, and\r\nthat of the officers composing court-martials, is occupied very little\r\nto the advantage of the public service, in considering the unbecoming\r\nand ungentlemanlike behaviour of officers to each other.”[251]\r\n\r\nThe mildest form of punishment for officers was the reprimand, which\r\nvaried much in shape. It might amount to no more than the publication\r\nof the fact that an officer _was_ reprimanded in the General Orders,\r\nwithout any further publicity. Or, on the other hand, the sentence of\r\nthe court-martial might be directed to be read out to his regiment,\r\nor even to his division, in the most public fashion. And to the\r\nsentence there might be added a caustic and scathing postscript by the\r\nCommander-in-Chief. Take, for example, “This person may think himself\r\nvery fortunate that the sentence of the court has been so lenient. A\r\ndifferent view of the evidence on the charge would have rendered his\r\ndismissal from the service necessary under the Articles of War. The\r\nCommander of the Forces hopes that he will take warning by what has\r\noccurred, and will in future conduct himself on all occasions as a\r\ngentleman should. This reprimand is to be read to him by the commanding\r\nofficer at the station where he may happen to be, in presence of the\r\nofficers and troops, paraded for that purpose.”[252]\r\n\r\nReprimands were generally the punishment for the smaller derelictions\r\nof duty, such as failing to report arrival at a station, striking a\r\nsoldier who was insolent instead of arresting him, brawling with a\r\ncivilian or a Portuguese militia officer, or boisterous and unseemly\r\nconduct in the streets when off duty.\r\n\r\nThere was no court-martial on an officer for desertion during the\r\nwhole war, and only one case of the sort in the commissioned ranks.\r\nThis was that of an Irish lieutenant who passed over to the French\r\noutposts while Masséna’s army was lying behind the lines of Santarem\r\nin February, 1811. He was discovered to be insane or suffering from\r\ndelusions, being captured during Masséna’s retreat, while wandering in\r\nan objectless way in the rear of the enemy’s march: he was sent to a\r\nmad-house.[253]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Executions for Desertion]\r\n\r\nAs to the punishments of the soldier, the heaviest was death, either\r\nby the bullets of a firing party, or by the Provost Marshal’s gallows.\r\nShooting was almost exclusively reserved for the military offence of\r\ndesertion to the enemy; but it was two or three times awarded for\r\nmutiny and striking an officer or sergeant, and once only (as far as\r\nI can make out) to a non-commissioned officer for robbing valuable\r\nstores which he had been set to guard.[254] It would have been more\r\nusual to hang for the latter offence, and I do not know why this\r\nparticular case was punished with shooting. There seem to have been\r\n78 men shot in all during the war, of whom 52 were British, and 26\r\nforeigners. The disproportion, of course, is enormous, as there were\r\nsome fifty or sixty British battalions in the army, and only ten\r\nforeign battalions.[255] Among the last the main body of deserters\r\nwere supplied by two battalions only, the _Chasseurs Britanniques_ and\r\nBrunswick Oels Jägers, both of which corps were largely recruited, as\r\nhas been already explained, from Germans, Italians, Poles, and other\r\naliens from prison camps at home. They had volunteered into the British\r\nservice in order to get the chance of escape, and took it at the first\r\nopportunity. The deserters from the King’s German Legion were in\r\nproportion very few. During the last two years of the war many of these\r\nforeign deserters were not shot, but given life service in a colonial\r\ncorps, in places such as New South Wales, from which they could not\r\ndesert again. Some others got off with a heavy sentence of flogging.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Punishment of Hanging]\r\n\r\nHanging was the penalty for practically all capital offences except\r\ndesertion to the enemy. It was not so frequent as shooting. The records\r\nof the General Court-Martials show a total of about forty executions,\r\nand a few more were apparently carried out by the Provost Marshal on\r\ncriminals caught _flagrante delicto_ murdering or wounding peasants.\r\n\r\nThe punishment of hanging covered many offences. It is rather\r\nsurprising to find that two men who killed their officers (one in the\r\nBuffs, one in the 42nd) were hanged rather than shot—but apparently\r\neach case was ruled to be one of private spite, and not of mutiny, and\r\nwas treated as simple murder. There were six or eight instances of men\r\nwho slew a comrade in the ranks, by deliberate assassination, not in\r\na quarrel, and were hanged for it. It may be noted, however, that one\r\nprivate who stabbed an unfaithful wife, at the moment of detection,\r\nwas found guilty of manslaughter and given one year’s imprisonment\r\nonly. Far the most frequent cause for the use of the gallows, however,\r\nwas the killing or wounding of peasants who attempted to defend their\r\nhouses or cattle from plunder. This was a crime for which Wellington\r\nseldom if ever gave pardon; he was as inflexible on the point in the\r\nhostile land of France as in the friendly Spain and Portugal. It did\r\nnot matter whether the peasants were killed or not—the use of musket or\r\nbayonet against them in pursuit of plunder was the thing that mattered.\r\nThere are certainly some most atrocious cases in the list, where a\r\nwhole family had been murdered or left for dead. But in others, where\r\nthe violence had been no more than a blow with a butt-end, or a bayonet\r\nprod in the shoulder, the offenders seem to have been unlucky in not\r\ngetting off with a sound flogging. But in Wellington’s code petty\r\nstealing without violence was punished with the lash, but armed robbery\r\nwith death.\r\n\r\nIn an age when in England theft to the value of over forty shillings\r\nwas still punishable in theory with death, (though the penalty was\r\nmore often evaded than not), it is not surprising to find that some\r\nof the cases of hanging in Wellington’s army were for mere stealing.\r\nBut it was always for stealing on a large scale, or under aggravated\r\ncircumstances. Mere petty larceny led to the lash only. The most\r\nnotable achievement in this line was that of two foreigners who\r\nsucceeded in breaking open the commissary-general’s chest and stole no\r\nless than £2000 from it; others were those of a soldier-servant who\r\nabsconded with his master’s mule, baggage, and purse; of a sentry over\r\nthe tent of a brigadier, who took the opportunity of making off with\r\nthe general’s silver camp-equipage and plate; and of a man who being\r\non treasure-escort, succeeded in opening a barrel and stealing some\r\nhundreds of dollars from it. In two or three instances large sums of\r\n£40 or £60, burglariously stolen from the house or tent of an officer,\r\na commissary, or a sutler, brought men to the gallows. Finally, there\r\nwas one case of hanging for the crime of sodomy—which was still a\r\ncapital offence in English law for more than thirty years after the\r\nPeninsular War ended.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two instances on record of rather surprising leniency\r\nin the sentences inflicted by court-martial for crimes which in most\r\nother cases entailed the death-penalty—_e.g._ plundering and wounding\r\na peasant was on two occasions in 1814 punished with 900 and 1000\r\nlashes only, and three artillerymen, who stole the watch, purse, and\r\npapers of the Spanish General Giron, got off with transportation to New\r\nSouth Wales, instead of suffering the hanging that was usual for such\r\na serious offence. A dragoon convicted of rape in 1814 was lucky also\r\nin receiving no more than a heavy flogging. No doubt there was in such\r\nlight sentences some consideration of previous good conduct and steady\r\nservice on the part of the offenders.\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of the penalties which came next after death\r\nin the list—the terrible 1200 and 1000 lash awards, and of the crimes\r\nwhich usually earned them. Much more frequent were the 700, 500, and\r\n300 lash sentences, which are to be numbered by the hundred, and\r\nwere awarded, as a rule, for casual theft without violence, making\r\naway with necessaries (_e.g._ selling blankets or ball-cartridge to\r\npeasants), or “embargoing” carts and oxen, _i.e._ pressing transport\r\nfrom the countryside without leave, to carry baggage or knapsacks\r\nwhen a small party, without an officer in charge, was on the move.\r\nPurloining shoes or food from a convoy was another frequent offence,\r\nworth about 500 lashes to the detected culprit. The bee-hive stealers\r\nof the retreat from Talavera got 700 lashes each—a heavy sentence for\r\nsuch a crime. The tale concerning them is too good to be omitted.\r\n\r\nAfter the general order against plundering from the peasantry was\r\nissued at Jaraicejo to the half-starved army, Sir Arthur Wellesley, in\r\na cross-country ride, saw a man of the Connaught Rangers posting along\r\nas fast as his legs could carry him, with his great coat wrapped around\r\nhis head, and a bee-hive balanced upon it, with a swarm of furious bees\r\nbuzzing around. Furious at such a flagrant breach of orders issued\r\nonly on the previous day, the Commander-in-Chief called out to him,\r\n“Hullo, sir, where did you get that bee-hive?” Pat could not see his\r\ninterlocutor, having completely shrouded his face to keep off stings:\r\nhe did not pay sufficient heed to the _tone_ of the question, which\r\nshould have warned him, and answered in a fine Milesian brogue, “Just\r\nover the hill there, and, by Jasus, if ye don’t make haste they’ll be\r\nall gone.”[256] The blind good-nature of the reply stayed the General’s\r\nanger; he let Pat pass, and told the story at dinner with a laugh. But\r\nthe order was no joke to the men of the 53rd caught at the same game a\r\nfew days after.[257] They got the nickname of the “honeysuckers” along\r\nwith their flogging.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charles Reilly’s Excuse]\r\n\r\nThere is another tale of “embargoing” belonging to the regimental\r\nhistory of the Connaught Rangers, which may serve as a pendant to that\r\nabout the bee-hives.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1812 a commissary had pressed country carts to go to the\r\nDouro, to bring back pipes of wine for the troops. On such occasions,\r\nwith a hilly country and very tedious work, the men would often\r\ncontrive, in spite of the vigilance of the subaltern in charge of the\r\nconvoy, to let the driver escape with his bullocks for a pecuniary\r\nconsideration. Other carts were then illegally pressed as substitutes.\r\nOn one of these occasions a detachment of the 88th regiment was sent to\r\nSt. João da Pesqueira for some wine. On their return, the commissary\r\nobserved that the two fine white bullocks, which he had sent with one\r\ncart, had been exchanged for two very inferior blacks. He made his\r\nregular complaint, and the two men in charge, a corporal and private,\r\nwere brought to a court-martial. On the trial everything was proved,\r\nsave the act of receiving money from the driver to allow the white\r\nbullocks to escape; and the president, on summing up the evidence of\r\nthe commissary, said to the prisoners, “It is quite useless denying\r\nthe fact; it is conclusive. You started from hence with a pair of fine\r\nwhite bullocks, and you brought back a pair of lean blacks. What can\r\nyou have to say to that?” Private Charles Reilly, noways abashed at\r\nthis, which every one thought a poser, and ready with any excuse to\r\nsave himself from punishment, immediately exclaimed, “Och! plaise your\r\nhonour, and wasn’t the white beasts lazy, and didn’t we bate them until\r\nthey were black?” The court was not quite satisfied of the truth of\r\nthis wonderful metamorphosis, and they were condemned to be punished\r\n(_see_ General Order, Freneda, January 22, 1812)—the corporal to be\r\nbroke and get 700 lashes, Reilly to get 500. But in consideration\r\nof the great gallantry displayed by the 88th at the storm of Ciudad\r\nRodrigo a few days before, the culprits were in the end pardoned.\r\n\r\nAll these cases quoted are from records of general court-martials. But\r\nof course the huge majority of floggings were inflicted by regimental\r\ncourts, which had jurisdiction over all minor offences, such as\r\ndrunkenness, disobedience, and petty breaches of discipline inside the\r\nregiment, but could not give the heavier sentences such as death or\r\ntransportation, or the 1000 lashes.\r\n\r\nA glance through the records of court-martials shows that some\r\nbattalions gave much more than their proper percentage of criminals,\r\nsome much less. Two main causes governed the divergence: the first was\r\nthat some corps got more than their share of bad recruits—wild Irish\r\nor town scum; but I fancy that the character of the commanding officer\r\nwas even more important than the precise proportion of undesirables\r\ndrafted into the ranks. A colonel who could make himself loved as\r\nwell as feared could reclaim even very unpromising recruits: a tyrant\r\nor an incapable could turn even well-disposed men into bad soldiers.\r\nIt is clear that an excessively easy-going and slack commanding\r\nofficer, who winked at irregularities, and discouraged zeal among his\r\nofficers, ruined a battalion as surely as the most inhuman martinet.\r\nAmong the court-martials of the Peninsular Army there are very few on\r\ncolonels—not half a dozen. But one chances to be on a tyrant, and the\r\nother on a _fainéant_, and the evidence seems to show that the latter\r\ngot his corps into quite as wretched condition as the former. Though\r\nhe received over the regiment, as every one allowed, in excellent\r\norder, in a few months of slack administration and relaxed discipline,\r\nit became not only drunken and slovenly, but so slow on the march,\r\nand at the rendezvous, that the other units in the brigade had always\r\nto be waiting for it, and the brigadier complained that he could not\r\ntrust it at the outposts. The officers, gradually coming to despise\r\ntheir colonel, treated him with contempt, and finally sent in a\r\nround-robin to the Horse Guards, accusing him not only of incapacity\r\nbut of cowardice, which last, in the court-martial which followed, was\r\nheld to be an unfounded charge.[258] The colonel, as a result of the\r\ninvestigation, was reprimanded, and put on half-pay; his subordinates,\r\nfor grave breach of discipline, were all drafted into other regiments,\r\nand a new body of picked officers was brought together, to reorganize\r\na corps which was evidently in a thoroughly demoralized condition; the\r\nnew-comers got the nickname of the “Elegant Extracts.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Tyrannical Colonel]\r\n\r\nThe reverse-picture, of a regiment ruined by arbitrary strictness and\r\ninhuman exaggeration of punishments, may be studied in the records\r\nof a court-martial held in the spring of 1813.[259] In this case a\r\ncommanding officer was found guilty not only of “violent conduct”\r\nand “using intemperate and improper language to his officers, being\r\nin breach of good discipline, and unbecoming the character of an\r\nofficer and a gentleman,” but of inflicting corporal punishment at\r\nlarge without any form of trial, when there were sufficient officers\r\npresent to form a proper regimental court-martial; of disobeying the\r\ndirection of the Commander-in-Chief by piling up sentences of flogging\r\npassed on men on different occasions, so as to inflict several separate\r\npunishments at the same time, and of releasing men sentenced to\r\npunishment in order to send them into action, and then returning them\r\nto arrest after the battle in order to receive their lashes. This last\r\nwas specially in conflict with Wellington’s orders, for he held that\r\ngood conduct in action ought to work out a sentence, pronounced but not\r\ninflicted, and that no man convicted of a disgraceful offence ought to\r\nbe put into line till he had expiated it by undergoing his punishment.\r\nThis officer was dismissed the service, but, in consideration of a good\r\nfighting record in the past, was allowed the value of his commission as\r\nmajor.\r\n\r\nOne diary from the ranks, that of Donaldson of the 94th, gives a very\r\ninteresting and complete picture of the fate of a battalion which, by\r\nthe invaliding of its colonel, had fallen into the hands of a major who\r\nhad the soul of a tyrant. This was a case of an old ranker who knew\r\ntoo much of soldiers’ tricks, and had a sort of system of espionage\r\nthrough men who were prepared to act as his toadies and secret\r\ninformers. “By this eaves-dropping he knew all the little circumstances\r\nwhich another commanding officer would have disdained to listen to,\r\nand always made a bad use of his knowledge. When he got command of\r\nthe regiment he introduced flogging for every trivial offence, and in\r\naddition invented disgraceful and torturing modes of inflicting the\r\nlash. But this was not enough—he ordered that all defaulters should\r\nhave a patch of black and yellow cloth sewed on to the sleeve of their\r\njacket, and a hole cut in it for every time they were punished. The\r\neffect was soon visible: as good men were liable to be punished for the\r\nslightest fault, the barrier between them and hardened ill-doers was\r\nbroken down, and those who had lost respect in their own eyes became\r\nbroken-hearted and inefficient soldiers, or else grew reckless and\r\nlaunched out into real crime. Those who were hardened and unprincipled\r\nbefore, being brought by the prevalence of punishments nearer to a\r\nlevel with the better men, seemed to glory in misconduct. In short,\r\nall idea of honour and character was lost, and listless apathy and\r\nbad conduct became the prevailing features of the corps. Reckless\r\npunishment changed the individual’s conduct in two ways—he either\r\nbecame broken-hearted and useless, or else shameless and hardened....\r\nThe real method of accomplishing the desired end of keeping good\r\ndiscipline, is for the officers to make themselves acquainted with the\r\npersonal character and disposition of each man under their command.\r\nA commanding officer has as good a right to make himself acquainted\r\nwith the disposition of his men, as the medical officer with their\r\nconstitutions.”[260] When the colonel came back from sick leave he was\r\nshocked to find the men he had been so proud of treated in this manner.\r\nHis first act was to cut off the yellow badge; his second to do away\r\nwith the frequent punishments. But though the regiment was again on a\r\nfair footing, it was long before the effect of a few months’ ill-usage\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Good-Conduct Medals]\r\n\r\nWhat certain misguided officers tried to maintain by a reign of terror,\r\nwas sought in other ways by wiser men. It is to the Peninsular War\r\nperiod that we owe the first of our “Long Service and Good Conduct”\r\nmedals—all at first regimental, and not given by the State. Honorary\r\ndistinctions for the well-conducted man are both a more humane and a\r\nmore rational form of differentiation between good and bad than the\r\nblack and yellow badge for every man punished for any cause, which the\r\ndetestable major quoted above tried to introduce.[261] In addition\r\nsome regiments instituted a division of the men into classes, of which\r\nthe best behaved had graduated privileges and benefits. Any man after\r\na certain period of certified good conduct could be moved up into a\r\nhigher class, and the emulation not to be left among the recognized\r\nblack-sheep had a very good effect.[262] But even without “classes” or\r\ngood-conduct medals, the best could be got out of any regiment by wise\r\nand considerate conduct on the part of the officers. There were corps\r\nwhere the lash was practically unknown,[263] and others where it had\r\nonly been felt by a very small minority of hopeless irreclaimables.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is a record or two of punishments in a\r\nunit, inflicted by officers who do not seem to have been regarded by\r\npublic opinion as specially tyrannical or heartless, which fills the\r\nreader with astonishment. I have analysed the list of men noted for\r\nchastisement in one battery of artillery, where on an effective of 4\r\nsergeants and 136 rank and file, three of the former had been “broken,”\r\nand 57 of the latter had received punishments varying downwards\r\nfrom 500 lashes, in the space of twelve months (July, 1812, to July,\r\n1813), over which the record extends. Though some of the offences were\r\nserious enough, there were others for which the use of the cat appears\r\naltogether misplaced and irrational. As an observer in another corps\r\nwrote “the frequency of flogging at one time had the effect of blinding\r\nthe judgment of officers who possessed both feeling and discrimination.\r\nI have known one who shed tears when his favourite horse was injured,\r\nand next day exulted in seeing a poor wretch flogged whose offence was\r\nbeing late in delivering an order.”\r\n\r\nFloggings were inflicted by the drummers of the regiment, under the\r\nsuperintendence of the drum-major and the adjutant. The culprit was\r\nbound by his extended arms to two of three sergeants’ halberds,\r\nplanted in the ground in a triangle, and lashed together at the top.\r\nThe strokes were inflicted at the tap of a drum beaten in slow time.\r\nEach of the wielders of the cat retired after having given twenty-five\r\nlashes. The surgeon was always present, to certify that the man’s\r\nlife was not in danger by the further continuance of the punishment,\r\nand the prisoner was taken down the moment that the medical man\r\ndeclared that he could stand no more. Often this interference saved\r\na culprit from the end of his punishment, as if the tale was fairly\r\ncomplete he might never be called upon to undergo the balance. But in\r\ngrave cases the prisoner was merely sent into hospital till he was\r\nsufficiently convalescent to endure the payment of the remainder of\r\nhis account. Inhuman commanding officers sometimes refused to allow of\r\nany abatement, even when the crime had not been a very serious one,\r\nand insisted that the whole sentence should be executed, even if the\r\nculprit had to go twice into hospital before it was completed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Memory of a Flogging]\r\n\r\nThe autobiographical record of a flogging is rather rare—the diarist in\r\nthe ranks was generally a steady sort of fellow, who did not get into\r\nthe worst trouble. The following may serve as an example, however. It\r\nis that of William Lawrence of the 1/40th, who in 1809 was a private,\r\nthough he won his sergeant’s stripes in 1813.\r\n\r\n“I absented myself without leave from guard for twenty-four hours, and\r\nwhen I returned I found I was in a fine scrape, for I was immediately\r\nput in the guard-room. It was my first offence, but that did not screen\r\nme much, and I was sentenced to 400 lashes. I found the regiment\r\nassembled all ready to witness my punishment: the place chosen for it\r\nwas the square of a convent. As soon as I had been brought up by the\r\nguard, the sentence of the court-martial was read over to me by the\r\ncolonel, and I was told to strip, which I did firmly, and without using\r\nthe help that was offered me, as I had by that time got hardened to my\r\nlot. I was then lashed to the halberds, and the colonel gave the order\r\nfor the drummers to commence, each one having to give me twenty-five\r\nlashes in turn. I bore it very well until I had received 175, when I\r\ngot so enraged with the pain that I began pushing the halberds, which\r\ndid not stand at all firm (being planted on stones), right across the\r\nsquare, amid the laughter of the regiment. The colonel, I suppose\r\nthinking then that I had had sufficient, ‘ordered the sulky rascal\r\ndown’ in those very words. Perhaps a more true word could not have been\r\nspoken, for indeed I was sulky. I did not give vent to a sound the\r\nwhole time, though the blood ran down my trousers from top to bottom. I\r\nwas unbound, and a corporal hove my shirt and jacket over my shoulder,\r\nand convoyed me to hospital, presenting as miserable a picture as I\r\npossibly could.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it was as good a thing for me as could then have happened, as\r\nit prevented me from committing greater crimes, which might at last\r\nhave brought me to my ruin. But I think a good deal of that punishment\r\nmight have been abandoned, with more credit to those who then ruled\r\nthe army.”[264] Yet to be absent twenty-four hours when on guard was\r\ncertainly a serious crime.\r\n\r\nLawrence got off with 175 lashes out of 400 ordered, but was in\r\nhospital nearly three weeks. But 300 or 400 lashes were often inflicted\r\nat a time, and there were men who could take them without a groan.\r\n\r\n“Corporal punishment was going on all the year round,” writes a veteran\r\nofficer of the 34th,[265] “men were flogged for the small offences, and\r\nfor the graver ones often flogged to death—the thousand lashes were\r\noften awarded by court-martial. I have seen men suffer 500 and even 700\r\nbefore being ‘taken down,’ the blood running down into their shoes,\r\nand their backs flayed like raw red-chopped sausages. Some of them\r\nbore this awful punishment without flinching for 200 or 300 lashes,\r\nchewing a musket ball or a bit of leather to prevent or stifle the\r\ncry of agony: after that they did not seem to feel the same torture.\r\nSometimes the head drooped over to one side, but the lashing still went\r\non, the surgeon in attendance examining the patient from time to time\r\nto see what more he could bear. I _did_ see, with horror, one prisoner\r\nreceive the 700 before he was taken down. This was the sentence of\r\na court-martial, carried into effect in the presence of the whole\r\nbrigade, for an example.[266] We certainly had very bad characters sent\r\nout to fill the gaps in our ranks, sweepings of prisons in England\r\nand Ireland: but such punishments were inhuman, and I made up my mind\r\nthat, if ever I had the chance of commanding a regiment, I would act\r\non another principle. That time _did_ come. I _did_ command a gallant\r\ncorps for eleven years, and I abolished the lash.”\r\n\r\nBut enough of such horrors. The memory of them is a nightmare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE ARMY ON THE MARCH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is rare in Peninsular literature to find any general descriptions\r\nof the normal working of the military machine. In personal diaries\r\nor reminiscences the author takes for granted a knowledge of the\r\ndaily life of the army, which was so familiar to himself, and only\r\nmakes remarks or notes when something abnormal happened. Official\r\ndocuments, on the other hand, are nearly always concerned with changes\r\nor modifications in routine. They explain and comment upon the reasons\r\nwhy some particular detail of practice must be abandoned, or be more\r\nstrictly enforced, but they do not give descriptive accounts of the\r\nwhole system of which that detail is a part. A notion as to the methods\r\non which Wellington’s army was moved could be got together by the\r\ncomparison of a great many of his “General Orders.” But, fortunately,\r\nwe are spared much trouble in the compilation of such a sketch by the\r\nfact that, for once, it is possible to lay one’s hand on a careful\r\ndetailed narrative of how the army marched. It is to be found in the\r\nanonymous introduction to the second edition of _Selected General\r\nOrders_, which Gurwood published in 1837. It was apparently not by\r\nthe editor himself, as he states in his introductory note that it\r\n“was written, as a critique, at the suggestion of the author of a\r\ndistinguished periodical review; but being found too long and too\r\nprofessional for columns usually destined to literature or politics, it\r\nwas not inserted.”[267] Since authors do not review their own books,\r\nit is clear that this critique was written by some friend, not by\r\nGurwood himself. It extends to about thirty-seven pages, of which nine\r\nare devoted to the long and interesting sketch of Wellington’s army on\r\nthe march, which is reproduced in the following paragraphs. The author,\r\nwriting for the general public, not for the professional public, tells\r\nus precisely what we want to know.\r\n\r\n“The orders for movement from the Commander of the Forces were\r\ncommunicated by the Quarter Master General to the General Officers\r\ncommanding divisions, who detailed them, through their Assistant\r\nQuarter Master Generals, to the Generals of brigades, who gave them out\r\nimmediately to the battalions of their brigades, through the Brigade\r\nMajors. The drum, the bugle and the trumpet sounded the preparation\r\nfor the march at a certain hour, generally one hour and a half before\r\ndaylight, in order that the several battalions might be assembled on\r\nthe brigade alarm-posts, so as to be ready to march off from the ground\r\nprecisely at daylight. It must be observed that the alarm-post is the\r\nplace of assembly in the event of alarm; it was generally, and should\r\nalways be, the place of parade.\r\n\r\n“It is singular to refer to these orders to see how a division of 6000\r\nmen, and so on in any proportion, rolled up in their blankets ‘in\r\nthe arms of Murphy,’ were all dressed, with blankets rolled, packed,\r\nequipped, squadded, paraded in companies, told off in subdivisions,\r\nsections, and sections of threes, marched by companies to the\r\nregimental alarm-posts, and finally to that of the brigade, formed in\r\nclose columns, all by sounds as familiar to the soldier as the clock at\r\nthe Horse Guards to a corporal of the Blues. Guns were paraded, baggage\r\npacked and loaded, Commissariat mules with the reserve biscuit, the\r\nStorekeeper with the spare ammunition-bullocks placed under charge, all\r\nassembled with the same precision and order, ready to march off under\r\nthe direction of the Assistant Quarter Master General attached to the\r\ndivision or corps, who had previously assembled the guides, whom he\r\nattached to the column or columns directed to be marched to the points\r\nor towns named in the Quarter Master General’s instructions. In the\r\nmean time the formidable Provost Marshal attached to the division made\r\nhis patrols.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Starting the March]\r\n\r\n“The report of ‘All Present’ being made in succession by the Brigade\r\nMajors to the Assistant Adjutant General, and by him to the General\r\ncommanding the column, the word ‘By sections of threes, march,’ was\r\ngiven, from the right or left, as directed in the Quarter Master\r\nGeneral’s instructions, the whole being formed either right or\r\nleft in front, according to the views of the General in command of\r\nthe army. The advanced guard of the column was then formed under\r\nthe superintendence of the Brigade Major of the Brigade, right or\r\nleft in front. This advanced guard consisted of one company of\r\nvarying strength. The whole was marched off at sloped arms, with the\r\ngreatest precision and regularity, and remained in that order until\r\nthe word ‘March at ease’ was given to the leading battalion, which\r\nwas successively taken up by the others in the rear. The women, in\r\ndetached parties, either preceded the column or followed it—none were\r\npermitted to accompany it; they generally remained with the baggage,\r\nexcepting when their finances enabled them to make little speculations\r\nin bread and _comfort_ in the villages or towns in the neighbourhood\r\nof the line of march. The Assistant Provost Marshal with his guard\r\nand delinquents brought up the rear of the column, followed by the\r\nrear guard, under an officer who took up all the stragglers, whom he\r\nlodged in the main guard on his arrival, where those who had received\r\ntickets of permission to fall out were directed to join their corps,\r\nnon-commissioned officers being in waiting to receive them.\r\n\r\n“The first halt was generally made at the expiration of half an hour\r\nfrom the departure, and afterwards once an hour; each halt lasted at\r\nleast five minutes after the men had piled their arms; this might vary\r\na little, as the weather, distance, or other circumstances of the\r\nmarch might point out. The object of halting was for the purpose of\r\nallowing those who had fallen out to rejoin their companies, which,\r\nexcepting in cases of sickness, usually occurred; as a man wanting to\r\nfall out was obliged to obtain a ticket from the officer commanding his\r\ncompany so to do, and to leave his pack and his firelock to be carried\r\nby his comrades of his section of threes; he therefore lost no time\r\nto return to his rank, and give back his ticket. This first halt was\r\ngenerally passed in eating a piece of bread or meat set aside for the\r\nmarch—arranging the accoutrements, pack, haversack, and canteen, so as\r\nto sit well—in jokes about the last night’s quarters or bivouac, or in\r\nthe anticipations of the next. At the expiration of the halt the drum\r\nor bugle sounded the ‘Fall-in,’ and, by word of command, the leading\r\nbattalion proceeded in the same order as in the beginning of the march;\r\nthe other battalions following in succession, always with music; then\r\n‘March at ease’ as before; but when the word ‘Attention’ was given, the\r\nwhole sloped arms and marched in the same order as at a field-day; this\r\nwas always done in formations previous to the halt.\r\n\r\n“When the army was not near the enemy, two officers preceded each\r\nbattalion on its march, one of them twenty-four hours before the\r\nbattalion, and, on his arrival at the station pointed out, received the\r\nnecessary information from the Assistant Quarter Master General. The\r\nother officer marched the same day in charge of the camp-colour men of\r\neach company, so as to arrive early, and take over the quarters from\r\nthe officer who went on the day before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Distribution of Billets]\r\n\r\n“The Deputy Assistant Quarter Master General always preceded these\r\nofficers, to make arrangements with the magistrates as to quarters: and\r\nthe town was parcelled out by him, in proportion to the strength of the\r\nseveral battalions or corps, to their respective officers; they divided\r\nit according to their judgment to the ten orderlies, who chalked on the\r\ndoors the letter of the company and number of men to occupy, as also\r\nthe officers’ quarters, which invariably were in the quarters of the\r\ncompany. The officer first marked off the quarters of the Commanding\r\nOfficer, staff, orderly-room, guard-room, Quarter Master’s stores, all\r\nin the most central position in the quarters of the regiment. The first\r\nofficer then proceeded to the next station; the second officer and the\r\nten orderlies proceeded to the road by which the troops were to arrive,\r\nand accompanied them to the alarm-post fixed for them: which spot the\r\nAssistant Quarter Master General, under the direction of the General\r\nin command, had pointed out, either in front or in rear of the town.\r\nHere they halted in column, as also assembled the following morning,\r\nor at any other time that the alarm or assembly might be sounded. The\r\nbrigades, the battalions, and the companies each had their respective\r\nalarm-posts or places of formation in the most central parts of their\r\nquarters. The officers commanding companies then put their men up,\r\nand made reports to the Officer Commanding as to the accommodation,\r\nor the want of it, the officers commanding battalions to those\r\ncommanding brigades, and the Generals of Brigades to the General of the\r\nDivision. The Assistant Quarter Master General was always ready to be\r\nappealed to, in case of a battalion being crowded, to afford further\r\naccommodation, as there was generally some building or street reserved\r\nin a central position for this purpose, or in the event of detachments\r\nof other corps arriving.\r\n\r\n“When the column was to bivouac in huts, or, as afterwards, encamp\r\nin tents, there occurred less difficulty. On arrival on the position\r\npointed out in the Quarter Master General’s instructions, the General\r\ncommanding chose what he considered the most favourable ground in\r\naccordance with needs as to front, communications with his flanks\r\nand rear, reference to wood and water, and the health of the ground,\r\navoiding proximity to marshes, where the night damps might affect\r\nthe troops. The Assistant Quarter Master General disposed of this\r\nground to the several officers sent on in advance by the battalions\r\nfor that purpose, as before described in quarters. The General then\r\nproceeded to the front, and indicated where he wished his advanced\r\npiquets to be posted, to be in communication with the outposts of the\r\ncavalry in front, or, if there were none, to cover all the approaches\r\nwith detached posts and sentries, so that nothing should be able to\r\narrive by any of them without being seen and stopped; or if patrols\r\nor other movements of the enemy should take place, either by night or\r\nday, that the same might be made known by the chain of sentries to the\r\ndetached posts and outlying piquets, and communicated to the main body,\r\nif thought necessary, by the Field Officer of the outlying piquets.\r\nPreconcerted signals of setting fire to beacons, or a certain number of\r\nmusket shots fired, communicated the alarm more quickly, and allowed\r\nthe troops more time to get under arms, until the precise cause of the\r\nalarm was ascertained.\r\n\r\n“The division having arrived on its ground, the outlying piquets\r\nwere immediately marched off to take the covering of the front just\r\ndescribed. The temporary division-hospital, and the Commissariat\r\nmagazines, being pointed out to the Commanding Officers, Surgeons,\r\nand Quarter Masters, the brigades and battalions proceeded to their\r\nrespective alarm-posts and ground for the encampment or bivouac,\r\naccompanied by the officers and the camp-colour men as before stated.\r\nThe quarter and rear guards were then mounted, to be relieved always\r\nin two hours afterwards by fresh troops. The sentries from the quarter\r\nguards watched the communications to the front, and to the detached\r\nposts between the camp and the outlying piquets, to communicate alarm\r\nif announced in any manner from the front.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tents and Huts]\r\n\r\n“If the troops were to encamp, the tent mules, which always immediately\r\nfollowed the column, under charge of an officer, preceding all other\r\nbaggage, were unloaded, and the company’s tents pitched in column on\r\nthe alignment given to the battalion, brigade, and division.\r\n\r\n“If there were no tents, then the bill-hooks came speedily into play:\r\nregular squads were formed for cutting branches, others for drawing\r\nthem to the lines, and others as the architects for constructing\r\nthe huts: this was an amusement more than a duty, and it was quite\r\nwonderful to see how speedily every one was under cover. It was the\r\npride of each company that their officers’ huts should be the first and\r\nthe best built. The soldier became quite re-invigorated by the mere act\r\nof piling arms, getting off his accoutrements, pack, haversack, and\r\nother incumbrances, which weigh generally about sixty pounds, and set\r\nto work in right earnest at the hut-building. Although the huts were\r\nnot quite so speedily erected, or pitched with the same regularity,\r\nas the tents, yet still the order and alignment were preserved when\r\nthe ground permitted. This might not have been essential, yet still no\r\nopportunity should be allowed to escape in inculcating the habit of\r\norder and regularity in whatever is done by the soldier; and, however\r\nsimple the act, it should be impressed on his mind, that what is\r\nordered is the easiest, and that what is his duty is his interest.\r\n\r\n“The regular fatigue parties for bread, meat, and spirits were\r\nregularly told off and warned, before the companies were dismissed to\r\npitch tents or build huts. These parties consisted generally of two or\r\nthree men per company, under a corporal, for each particular article\r\nof provisions, to be ready to turn out when that article was called at\r\nthe quarter guard. A company’s guard or watch, of a corporal and four\r\nprivates, furnishing one sentry with side arms only, always remained in\r\nthe lines of the company to repeat communications and preserve order.\r\n\r\n“The Commanding Officers made their reports through the Majors of\r\nbrigade, that their respective battalions had received bread, meat,\r\nspirits, and forage, specifying the number of days for each; that they\r\nhad marched off one or more companies, of such and such strength, for\r\nthe outlying piquets, to the posts directed under the orders of the\r\nField Officer of the outlying piquets; and that the orderlies who had\r\naccompanied them had returned, knowing where to find them. The outlying\r\npiquets were under the Field Officer of the day, who again received his\r\ninstructions from the Assistant Adjutant General of the division. The\r\nCommanding Officers at the same time reported the force of the company\r\nor inlying piquet, which were ready to turn out to support the outlying\r\npiquet in the event of being required, and were under the Field Officer\r\nof the day of the inlying piquets, and kept on their accoutrements,\r\nalthough in other respects, like the remaining companies, not on duty,\r\nand in their tents or huts. The company on inlying piquet, as also the\r\nField Officer of the day in charge of the whole of the companies of the\r\nbrigade, were always first for the outlying piquet.\r\n\r\n“All particular duties were taken by companies, under their own\r\nofficers, and not by the old way of individual roster of so many men\r\nper company; such were the company for outlying piquet; the company\r\nfor inlying piquet, which gave the quarter and rear guards within the\r\nlines; the first company for general fatigue, from which the Quarter\r\nMaster’s fatigues were taken for ammunition, equipment, working\r\nparties, and all other fatigues, excepting rations; all these duties\r\nwere taken by the roster of companies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On Drawing Rations]\r\n\r\n“The issue of rations was regulated by the Quarter Master and\r\nCommissariat, agreeably to the instructions of the General commanding\r\nthe division or brigade, communicated in orders to the battalions,\r\nand was done regimentally by individuals from all the companies, and\r\nnot by the company on general fatigue. On the issue of any article,\r\nsuch as bread, meat, wine, or forage, the fatigue parties from each\r\ncompany, as before described, were summoned from the quarter guard\r\nby the Quarter Master, who called out the watch in the lines of each\r\ncompany; those previously warned for each article turned out under\r\ntheir respective non-commissioned officers, and assembled under the\r\nofficer of the inlying piquet named in the orders at the quarter guard.\r\nHe then proceeded with the Quarter Master or Quarter Master Sergeant\r\nto the place of issue; after the delivery he returned to the quarter\r\nguard, reported to the Captain of the Day, who was the captain of the\r\ninlying piquet, the regularity or irregularity of the particular issue\r\nunder his superintendence, and then dismissed the parties under their\r\nseveral non-commissioned officers to their respective companies, where\r\nthe delivery was immediately made under the orderly Officer of each\r\ncompany. The same routine took place when in quarters; and, although\r\nthe recapitulation may appear tedious, still the whole was performed\r\nwith a celerity which leaves more time to the soldier when in camp than\r\nin any other situation.\r\n\r\n“At an appointed hour the sick reports were gathered from the\r\ncompanies, and the men paraded for the inspection of the Surgeon;\r\nhe reported to the Staff Surgeon, who, in his turn, reported to\r\nthe General commanding the division, sending his own report to the\r\nInspector General of Hospitals.\r\n\r\n“The General commanding the division made his reports to the Adjutant\r\nand Quarter Master Generals for the information of the Commander of the\r\nForces, according to the importance of the report and the circumstances\r\nof the moment.\r\n\r\n“When before the enemy, the issue of the provisions and the cooking\r\nwere attended to with every consideration to the position of things,\r\nso that what was to be done should be done with speed as well as\r\nprecaution; for it would be bad management to throw away the soup\r\nbefore it was well made, or swallow it boiling hot, in case of\r\ninterruption, and still worse to leave it to the enemy. All this is\r\nsufficiently dwelt upon in the Duke’s ‘Circular Letter,’ and in the\r\nadmirable orders of General Robert Craufurd, from whence the greater\r\npart of the foregoing details were learned and proved in the field.[268]\r\n\r\n“The new tin camp-kettle, carried alternately by the men of each\r\nsquad, was a great improvement upon the old Flanders iron cauldron,\r\nwhich required a whole tree, or the half of a church door, to make it\r\nboil; and which, being carried on the camp-kettle mule (afterwards\r\nappropriated to carry the tents), only arrived with the baggage. This\r\nimprovement, as the Duke truly observed in his ‘October Minute,’ left\r\nmuch valuable time disposable for other purposes. It is to be hoped\r\nthat in any future wars some improvement will also take place in the\r\nweight and temper of the old bill-hook, which, in the early part of\r\nthe Peninsular War, was immoderately heavy, and had edges which, on\r\nattempting to cut any wood not absolutely green, bent like lead: many\r\nof the men threw these away, but the more prudent _exchanged_ them for\r\nthe lighter and better tempered bill-hook used by the Portuguese in\r\ntheir vineyards, exchange being no robbery with our fellows.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Miseries of Wet Weather]\r\n\r\n“In the camp or bivouac, in fine weather, all went on merrily, but\r\nthere came moments of which the mere remembrance even now recalls\r\nancient twitches of rheumatism, which the iron frame of the most hardy\r\ncould not always resist. On the night previous to General Craufurd’s\r\naffair on the Coa, on those previous to the battle of Salamanca and the\r\nbattle of Waterloo, and on many other less anxious nights, not hallowed\r\nby such recollections, deluges of rain not only drenched the earth, but\r\nunfortunately all that rested or tried to rest upon it; the draining\r\nthrough the hut from above by some ill-placed sticks in the roof, like\r\nlightning conductors, conveyed the subtle fluid where it was the least\r\nwanted; while the floods coursing under, drove away all possibility\r\nof sleep: repose was, of course, out of the question, when even the\r\nworms would come out of the earth, it being far too wet for them. ‘In\r\nsuch a night as this’ it was weary work to await the lagging dawn with\r\na craving stomach; and, worse still, to find nothing but a bellyful\r\nof bullets for breakfast. But, on the Pyrenees, in the more fortunate\r\nand healthy days of tents, it was not unusual, when the mountain blast\r\nand torrents of rain drew up the pegs of the tents, for them to fall,\r\nas nothing in nature falls, squash on the soldier, who lay enveloped\r\nand floundering in the horrible wet folds of canvas. Then nothing but\r\nthe passing joke ‘Boat a-hoy!’ or the roars of laughter caused by some\r\nwag, who made this acme of misery into mirth, could re-animate to the\r\nexertion of scrambling out of these clammy winding-sheets. These are\r\nrecollections, however, which, notwithstanding the sufferings in the\r\nexperience of them, and their legacies of rheumatism, still afford\r\npleasurable feelings to the old soldier, now laid up by his Christmas\r\nfireside.”\r\n\r\nTo this long and lively description by an anonymous Peninsular veteran\r\n(probably from the Light Division) of the way in which Wellington’s\r\narmy moved, we need only add a few words by way of caution and\r\nsupplement. The smoothly-working regularity which it described could\r\nnot always be secured in actual practice. There were marches where\r\nthe system could not be carried out, by reason of hurry, unexpected\r\nchanges of direction, and the vagaries of the weather. When some\r\nsudden movement of the French forced the Duke to throw his army on a\r\nroute that he had not intended to take, the elaborate provision of\r\nofficers going before to act as harbingers could not be carried out.\r\nWhen a division halted, late at night, at some unforeseen destination,\r\nthere could be neither the selection of billets, nor (in the open\r\nfield) the erection of huts described above. All had to be done more\r\nor less haphazard in the dark. In hot or stormy weather stragglers\r\nwere numerous, and the “ticket” routine broke down altogether. The\r\ndescription above will do for long orderly movements like the advance\r\non Madrid in 1812, or the march to Vittoria, in 1813, but it fails to\r\nreproduce the impression of confusion and misery caused by the perusal\r\nof any good narrative of the Burgos retreat, or of the disorder in\r\nthe hasty marches to intercept Soult on the eve of the battles of\r\nthe Pyrenees. A quotation from a diarist in the ranks,[269] giving a\r\npicture of the first-named march may suffice to give the reverse of\r\nthe shield.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Retreat from Burgos]\r\n\r\n“Retreating before the enemy at any time is a grievous business, but\r\nin such weather as that of November, 1812, it was doubly so. The rain\r\npouring down in torrents drenched us to the skin, the road, composed\r\nof clay soil, stuck to our shoes so fast that they were torn off our\r\nfeet. The nights were dismally dark, the cold winds blew in heavy\r\ngusts, and the roads became gradually worse. After marching in this\r\nstate for hours, we halted in a field by the roadside, piled our arms,\r\nand were allowed to dispose of ourselves as we best could. The moon,\r\nwading through dense masses of clouds, sometimes threw a momentary\r\ngleam on the miserable beings huddled together in every variety of\r\nposture, and trying to rest or to screen themselves from the cold. Some\r\nwere lying on the wet ground rolled in wetter blankets, some placed\r\ntheir knapsack on a stone, and sat on it, with their blankets wrapped\r\nabout them, their heads resting on their knees, their teeth chattering\r\nwith cold. Long before daylight we were again ordered to fall in, and\r\nproceeded on our retreat. The rain still continued to fall, the roads\r\nwere now knee-deep in mud. Many men got fatigued and could not follow:\r\nthe spring waggons could not hold them all; they dropped behind to\r\nfall into the hands of the French cavalry. By some mismanagement the\r\ncommissary stores had been sent on ahead with the baggage, toward\r\nRodrigo, and we were without food. The feeling of hunger was very\r\nsevere: some oxen that had remained with the division were killed and\r\nserved out to us, but our attempts to kindle cooking fires with wet\r\nwood were abortive. Sometimes we just managed to raise a smoke, and\r\nnumbers would gather round a fire, which then would go out, in spite of\r\ntheir efforts.\r\n\r\n“A savage sort of desperation took possession of our minds: those\r\nwho lived on most friendly terms with each other in better times now\r\nquarrelled with each other, using the most frightful imprecations on\r\nthe slightest offence. A misanthropic spirit took possession of every\r\nbreast. The streams from the hills were swollen into rivers, which we\r\nhad to wade, and vast numbers fell out, among them even officers. It\r\nwas piteous to see the men, who had long dragged their limbs after\r\nthem with a determined spirit, finally fall down in the mud unable to\r\nproceed further. The despairing looks that they gave us, when they saw\r\nus pass on, would have pierced the heart at any other time; but our\r\nfeelings were steeled, and we had no power to assist, even had we felt\r\nthe inclination.\r\n\r\n“At last the rain somewhat abated, but the cold was excessive: at\r\nthe nightly halt many men threw themselves down in the mud, praying\r\nfor death to relieve them from their misery. And some prayed not in\r\nvain, for next morning, starting in the dark, we stumbled over several\r\nwho had died in the night. Setting my foot inadvertently on one, I\r\nstooped down to feel, and I shall never forget the sickening thrill\r\nthat went to my heart, as my hand touched his cold, clammy face. This\r\nday we halted earlier than usual, and the weather being clearer, got\r\nfires lighted; but there was nothing to eat save acorns from a wood in\r\nwhich we encamped—we greedily devoured them, though they were nauseous\r\nin the extreme. Next day’s sufferings were of the same nature—only\r\nmore aggravated, till at last we neared Rodrigo in the dark, halted,\r\nand heard at last the well-known summons of ‘Turn out for biscuit,’\r\nring in our ears. We had got to food at last. Instead of the usual\r\norderly division each man seized what he could get, and began to allay\r\nthe dreadful gnawing pain which had tormented us for four days of\r\nunexampled cold and fatigue.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nIMPEDIMENTA: THE BAGGAGE—LADIES AT THE FRONT\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Baggage Animals]\r\n\r\nThe train of Wellington’s army was very heavy. In addition to the long\r\ndroves of mules and ox-waggons which carried public stores, there was\r\na very large accumulation of private baggage. The field equipment\r\nof officers—especially of officers of the higher ranks—strikes the\r\nmodern student as very heavy, and was much commented on by French\r\nobservers at the time. “To look at the mass of impedimenta and\r\ncamp-followers trailing behind the British,” says Foy, “you would\r\nthink you were beholding the army of Darius. Only when you have met\r\nthem in the field do you realize that you have to do with the soldiers\r\nof Alexander.” The cause of this accumulation was partly a survival\r\nof the lax customs of the eighteenth century, but it resulted still\r\nmore from the character of the country over which Wellington’s host\r\nmoved. In the interior of Spain or Portugal absolutely nothing was to\r\nbe procured. The simplest small luxuries, tea, sugar, coffee, were\r\nungettable, save in the largest towns; to renew clothing was equally\r\nimpossible. He who required anything must carry it with him. It was\r\nnot like campaigning in France, Belgium, Germany, or Italy. At the\r\ncommencement of his term of command Wellington laid down the rule[270]\r\nthat no private baggage was to be carried upon carts: “those who have\r\nbaggage to carry, must be provided with mules and horses.” This order\r\nis repeated again and again during later years.[271] A regular scale\r\nof the amount of horses and mules allowed to officers of different\r\nrank was shortly produced. Two subalterns must share one sumpter-beast\r\nbetween them, a captain was allowed a whole mule or horse, and so on,\r\nin a mounting scale.[272] But as early as September 1, 1809, it would\r\nseem that a more liberal allowance was made legal. In a “general order”\r\nof that day we get an elaborate table of rations of forage for all\r\nranks, from the commander-in-chief downwards. While subalterns are\r\nallowed one ration each, the number rises enormously for the seniors,\r\na captain commanding a company is set down for five rations, a major\r\nfor seven, a lieutenant-colonel in charge of a battalion for ten, the\r\nAdjutant-General for twenty, etc., etc. This was a far too liberal\r\nallowance for the senior ranks, and led to an accumulation of beasts,\r\nboth riding horses and pack-mules, far surpassing what was reasonable.\r\nTo enable them to equip themselves for field service, all officers\r\n(whether staff or regimental) when ordered for the first time to join\r\nthe army, were allowed to draw 200 days “bât, baggage, and forage\r\nmoney.” This presumably would go towards the purchase of their animals.\r\nThe forage allowed was 14 lbs. of hay or straw of the country, and 12\r\nlbs. of oats, or 10 lbs. of barley or Indian corn. When English hay was\r\nprocurable (as at Lisbon) only 10 lbs. of it might be issued instead of\r\nthe 14 lbs. of native stuff. On this system the captain would provide\r\nhimself with a riding horse, generally a small Portuguese nag, and have\r\na mule for his baggage. The subaltern must walk if he kept a mule:\r\nbut it seems that very soon the juniors also took to riding. At any\r\nrate, lieutenants and other juniors often appear with a riding horse.\r\nNothing is more common in a diary than to find, on his first arrival in\r\nPortugal the young officer procuring himself not one but two beasts,\r\ngenerally a nag and a mule. Sometimes he brought out a horse of his own\r\nfrom England.[273] More usually he bought—\r\n\r\n       “A mule for baggage, and a ‘bit of blood’”[274]\r\n\r\nin the horse-market at Lisbon, of which one who had been through the\r\nbusiness writes:—\r\n\r\n“The only convenient opportunity to make the purchase was at a sort of\r\nfair held every Tuesday in the lower part of the town. There horses,\r\nmules, and asses were bought and sold, and (as in all markets) the\r\nprice chiefly depended on the demand. The Portuguese horse-dealer has\r\nall the avidity of the English jockey to pick your pocket, but is\r\nnot so _au fait_ at the business. At this Fair you buy or sell your\r\nanimal, the bargain is struck, the money paid, and the contract is\r\nindissoluble. English guineas had no attraction: the dollar or the\r\nmoidore was the medium; but since the guinea has been introduced in\r\nthe payment of the army (1813) the Portuguese begin to appreciate its\r\nvalue. It was customary for officers who wanted cash to give their\r\ndraft on some house in London; but it was purchasing money very dearly,\r\ngiving at the rate of six and sixpence for a dollar that would only\r\nbring five shillings, so losing eighteen pence on every crown.”[275]\r\n\r\nGood and large Spanish mules cost as much, or almost as much, as the\r\nsmall horses of the country. Fifty to ninety dollars was an ordinary\r\nprice. Thirty to forty-five pounds was considered cheap for an English\r\nriding horse.[276] A Portuguese nag might be bought for fifteen or\r\ntwenty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Concerning Messes]\r\n\r\n“In consequence of the difficulty of transporting baggage,” writes\r\none of the liveliest commentators on daily life at the front, “a\r\nregiment on active service could not keep up a regular mess, as in\r\nEngland. Each officer was obliged to manage for himself: they generally\r\ndivided themselves into mess-parties by twos and threes. This greatly\r\nincommoded the subaltern: allowed only the carriage of half an animal\r\n[or at the most of one] it was not possible to admit, for the purpose\r\nof having extra eatables, any addition to his share of baggage. The\r\nmere ration was all that he got, with a camp-kettle for culinary\r\npurposes. Besides we must recollect the difficulty of getting extra\r\nfood, and also the want of money. So the bit of beef and the ration of\r\nbiscuit was frequent fare for perhaps two-thirds of the officers—with\r\nthe allowance of ration-rum or wine (generally execrable stuff). The\r\nprime luxuries were a drop of brandy and a segar. With respect to\r\narticles of dress, the contents of a small portmanteau being all that\r\ncould be taken about, if a subaltern wore out or lost his regimental\r\njacket, he had to improvise a substitute, _e.g._ his great coat.\r\nWaistcoats were as fancy directed, black, blue, or green, silk or\r\nvelvet.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless, though the officer, or at least the junior officer,\r\nthought himself much stinted in baggage, the private mules of the\r\nregiment, and in particular those of the senior officers, made up\r\nquite a drove—at least some thirty or forty. In addition there were\r\nthe public mules of the corps, some thirteen in number—one for each\r\ncompany’s camp kettles, one for entrenching tools, one for the\r\npaymaster’s books, one for the surgeon’s medical paniers. If we add to\r\nthese the private riding horses of the senior officers and such of\r\nthe juniors as could afford them, there was quite a cavalcade—enough\r\nto block a road or to encumber a ford. And unfortunately the mules\r\nand horses presupposed drivers and attendants. Wellington set his\r\nface against the withdrawal from the ranks of soldier-servants to act\r\nas muleteers.[277] Each officer, of course, had one; but they were\r\nsupposed to be available for service, and could only look to their\r\nmaster’s business in the halts and encampments. Hence native servants\r\nhad to be hired—even the poorest pair of ensigns wanted a Portuguese\r\nboy to look after their single mule. The colonel had probably three or\r\nfour followers. Thus to take charge of its baggage, private and public,\r\neach battalion had a following of twenty or thirty such attendants, a\r\nfew English, the large majority Spanish or Portuguese.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Camp Followers]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that these fellows had a villainous reputation, and\r\nlargely deserved it. Though many decent peasant lads were picked up in\r\nthe countryside by the earlier comers, and made trustworthy and loyal\r\nservants, the majority were not satisfactory. The sort of followers\r\nwhom the officers of a newly-landed regiment engaged at short notice\r\nupon the quays of Lisbon, when only two or three days were given them\r\nfor selection, were mostly “undesirables.” If there were a few among\r\nthem who were merely “broken men,”—ruined peasants seeking bread at any\r\nhand that would give it,—the majority were the scum of a great harbour\r\ncity, ruffians of the lowest sort. The best of the Portuguese were with\r\nthe army: the net of the conscription was making wide sweeps, and few\r\nyoung men of the decent class escaped the line or the militia. Personal\r\nservice under an English officer, who was certainly an incomprehensible\r\nforeigner, and might well be a hard and unreasonable master, was not so\r\nattractive as to draw the pick of the Portuguese working classes. It\r\ndid, on the other hand, appeal to needy rascals who wanted the chance\r\nof cheating an employer who knew nothing of the country, its customs,\r\nand its prices. There was splendid opportunity for embezzlement.\r\nMoreover, many looked for more lucrative, if more dangerous gains. The\r\ndiaries show that a very considerable proportion of the hastily-hired\r\nmuleteers and servants absconded, after a few days, with their master’s\r\nmule and portmanteau, and were never seen again. Those who did not,\r\nwere looking after the plunder of the battlefield, the camp, and\r\nthe wayside. It was they who robbed drunken soldiers, ill-guarded\r\ncommissary stores, or lonely villages. They slunk out at night to\r\nmake privy plunder in the lines of the regiments in which they were\r\nnot employed. On the battlefield they were ruthless strippers of the\r\nwounded—English and Portuguese no less than French—as well as of the\r\ndead. Unless report much mistreats them, they habitually knocked\r\na wounded Frenchman on the head, if they were out of sight of the\r\nred-coats.[278] Considering the atrocities of which the French had been\r\nguilty in Portugal, this might pass for not unnatural retaliation; but\r\nit is certain that the British wounded were also frequently plundered,\r\nand there is more than a suspicion that they were sometimes murdered.\r\nThe Spanish camp-followers passed as being even more blood-thirsty than\r\nthe Portuguese. Of course it was not the officers’ private employés\r\nalone who were guilty of these misdemeanours; the public muleteers\r\nof the commissariat staff, and other hangers-on of the army, had an\r\nequally bad reputation. The most daring theft of the whole war, as has\r\nbeen already mentioned, was done by two “authorized followers,” who\r\nburglariously entered the house of the Commissary-General in 1814,\r\nand got off with no less than £2000 in gold. They were detected, and\r\nnaturally suffered the extreme punishment of the law. By their names\r\none would seem to have been French, the other a Spaniard. There is an\r\nawful story, told in two diaries, of a camp follower who in a time of\r\nstarvation sold to British soldiers as pork slices cut off a French\r\ncorpse.[279] He got away before he could be caught and shot. But enough\r\nof these ghouls!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Soldiers’ Wives]\r\n\r\nThe followers of a British army were by no means exclusively foreign.\r\nOne of the worst impediments to the free movement of the host came from\r\nthe unhappy practice that then prevailed of allowing corps on foreign\r\nservice to take with them a proportion of soldiers’ wives—four or six\r\nper company. Forty or sixty of these women, mostly mounted on donkeys,\r\nformed the most unmanageable portion of every regimental train. They\r\nwere always straggling or being left behind, because they could not\r\nkeep up with the long marches that the army had often to take. Wayside\r\ntragedies of this sort are to be found recorded in almost every\r\nPeninsular memoir—often of the most harrowing sort. In especial we\r\nmay mention the number of these poor women who dropped in the Corunna\r\nretreat, and died in the snow, or fell into the hands of the French.\r\nThe interesting little book of a married sergeant of the 42nd, who took\r\nhis wife about with him during the last three years of the war, is full\r\nof curious little shifts and anxieties that they went through.[280] The\r\nbest description of this curious stratum of the Peninsular Army that I\r\nknow is in the autobiography of Bell of the 34th.[281]\r\n\r\n“The multitude of soldiers’ wives stuck to the army like bricks: averse\r\nto all military discipline, they impeded our progress at times very\r\nmuch, particularly in retreats. They became the subject of a General\r\nOrder, for their own special guidance. They were under no control, and\r\nwere always first mounted up and away, blocking up narrow passes and\r\nchecking the advance of the army with their donkeys, after repeated\r\norders to follow in rear of their respective corps, or their donkeys\r\nwould be shot. On the retreat from Burgos I remember Mrs. Biddy Flyn\r\nremarking, ‘I would like to see the man that wud shoot _my_ donkey:\r\nfaith, I’ll be too early away for any of ’em to catch me. Will you\r\ncome wid me, girls?’ ‘Aye, indeed, every one of us.’ And away they\r\nstarted at early dawn, cracking their jokes about divisional orders,\r\nWellington, commanding officers, and their next bivouac. Alas! the\r\nProvost Marshal was in advance—a man in authority, and a terror to evil\r\ndoers: he was waiting a mile or two on, in a narrow turn of the road,\r\nfor the ladies, with a party all loaded. He gave orders to shoot the\r\nfirst two donkeys _pour exemple_. There was a wild, fierce and furious\r\nyell struck up, with more weeping and lamentation than one usually\r\nhears at an Irish funeral, with sundry prayers for the _vagabone_ that\r\nhad murdered the lives of the poor darling innocent _crathers_. ‘Bad\r\nluck to the ugly face of the Provost, the spy of the camp, may he niver\r\nsee home till the vultures have picked his eyes out, the born varmint,’\r\nand so on. The victims picked up what they could carry, and marched\r\nalong with the regiment, crying and lamenting their bitter fate. It\r\nwas wonderful what they endured—but in spite of this warning they were\r\nforemost on the line of march next morning again. As Mrs. Skiddy, their\r\nleader, said, ‘We must risk something to be in before the men, to have\r\nthe fire and a _dhrop_ of tay ready for them after their load and their\r\nlabour: and sure if we went in the _rare_ the French, bad luck to them,\r\nwould pick me up, me and my donkey, and then Dan Skiddy would be lost\r\nentirely without me.’”\r\n\r\nThe soldiers’ wives were indeed an extraordinary community—as hard as\r\nnails, expert plunderers, furious partisans of the supreme excellence\r\nof their own battalion, much given to fighting. Many of them were\r\nwidows twice and even thrice over—for when a married man was shot, and\r\nhis wife was a capable and desirable person, she would receive half a\r\ndozen proposals before her husband was forty-eight hours in his grave.\r\nAnd since the alternative was a hazardous voyage back to relatives in\r\nEngland or Ireland, who had probably broken off with the “girl who ran\r\naway with a soldier,” most of the widows concluded to stop with the\r\nbattalion, with a new spouse and a new name. As the war dragged on many\r\nof the men picked up Portuguese and Spanish helpmates, who joined the\r\nregimental drove, and made it strangely polyglot. At the end of the\r\nstruggle in 1814 there was a most harrowing scene at Bordeaux, when the\r\ngeneral order was issued that all these foreigners who could not prove\r\nthat they had been legitimately married to soldiers, with the colonel’s\r\nleave, were to be refused transport to the British Isles.[282] There\r\nwere hundreds of them, and only in a few cases could the men find money\r\nto get them taken home in private merchantmen. The bulk marched back\r\nto the Peninsula in charge of a brigade of homeward bound Portuguese—a\r\nmost melancholy and distressful assembly.[283]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ladies at the Front]\r\n\r\nIt is extraordinary to find that a sprinkling of the officers of the\r\nPeninsular Army were unwise enough to take their wives with them to the\r\nfront—thereby securing a life of wearing anxiety for both, and of dire\r\nhardship for the poor ladies. One of the best known cases was that of\r\nHill’s senior aide-de-camp, Captain Currie, whose wife I have found\r\nmentioned half a dozen times as making tea for the second division\r\nstaff, and holding a little reception whenever the division was settled\r\ndown for a few days. Another was Mrs. Dalbiac, wife of the colonel\r\nof the 4th Dragoons, whose adventures on the field of Salamanca are\r\nmentioned by Napier.[284] But the best chronicle of the ups and downs\r\nof a young married couple may be found in the breezy autobiography\r\nof Sir Harry Smith, then a subaltern in the 95th Rifles. His tale is\r\nwell known—he rescued a young Spanish lady among the horrors of the\r\nsack of Badajoz, married her two days later, and had her with him for\r\nthe remaining three years of the war. The story of their Odyssey, as\r\nrelated by him, is one of the most touching narratives of loyal love,\r\nand hardship cheerfully borne, that any man can read. They lived\r\ntogether for forty years in storm and sunshine, and she survived to\r\nchristen the town of Ladysmith by her name, while her husband was\r\ncommanding the forces in South Africa. He gave his name to the sister\r\ntown of Harrismith, less well remembered now than the long-besieged\r\nplace with which the memory of Juana Smith is linked.\r\n\r\nThere is a sketch in Paris by the well-known artist, Colonel Lejeune,\r\nwho, when a prisoner at Elvas, made a drawing of an English military\r\nfamily which passed him. As he describes it in his diary, “The captain\r\nrode first on a very fine horse, warding off the sun with a parasol:\r\nthen came his wife very prettily dressed, with a small straw hat,\r\nriding on a mule and carrying not only a parasol, but a little black\r\nand tan dog on her knee, while she led by a cord a she-goat, to\r\nsupply her with milk. Beside madame walked her Irish nurse, carrying\r\nin a green silk wrapper a baby, the hope of the family. A grenadier,\r\nthe captain’s servant, came behind and occasionally poked up the\r\nlong-eared steed of his mistress with a staff. Last in the procession\r\ncame a donkey loaded with much miscellaneous baggage, which included a\r\ntea-kettle and a cage of canaries; it was guarded by an English servant\r\nin livery, mounted on a sturdy cob and carrying a long posting-whip,\r\nwith which he occasionally made the donkey mend its pace.”[285] If\r\nthis picture is not exaggerated, it certainly helps us to understand\r\nthe strong objection which Wellington had for ladies at the front, and\r\nall forms of impedimenta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nA NOTE ON SIEGES\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that the record of the Peninsular Army in the matter\r\nof sieges is not the most brilliant page in its annals. It is not to\r\nthe orgies that followed the storm of Badajoz or San Sebastian that\r\nallusion is here made, but to the operations that preceded them, and to\r\nthe unhappy incidents that accompanied the luckless siege of Burgos.\r\nCourage enough and to spare was lavished on those bloody leaguers;\r\nperseverance was shown in no small measure; and to a certain extent\r\nprofessional skill was not lacking. But the tale compares miserably\r\nwith the great story of the triumphs of Wellington’s army in the open\r\nfield. Reckless bravery had to supply the place of the machinery and\r\norganization that was lacking, and too much blood was spilt, and\r\nsometimes spilt to no effect.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for these facts is hard to distribute. As is\r\ngenerally the case when failures are made, it is clear that a system\r\nwas to blame rather than any individual, or body of individuals.\r\nGreat Britain had been at war with France for some sixteen years;\r\nbut in all her countless expeditions she had never, since 1794, been\r\ncompelled to undertake regular sieges on a large scale. The battering\r\nof old-fashioned native forts in India, the blockades of Malta or\r\nAlexandria, the bombardments of Flushing or Copenhagen, need hardly\r\nbe mentioned. They were not operations such as those which Wellington\r\nhad to carry out in 1811 or 1812. For a long time the Peninsular War\r\nhad been considered as a purely defensive affair; it was concerned\r\nwith the protection of Portugal, almost (we might say) of Lisbon, from\r\nthe French invader. The home Government kept sending reinforcements to\r\nWellington, but they were under the impression that an over-powerful\r\ncombination of the enemy’s forces might some day force him to\r\nre-embark. He himself regarded such a contingency as by no means\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington’s Battering Train]\r\n\r\nBut in the spring of the year 1811 it became clear that a defensive\r\nwar may have offensive episodes. After Masséna’s retreat from before\r\nthe Lines of Torres Vedras, Wellington had to protect the frontiers\r\nof Portugal; and to guard them efficiently he needed possession of\r\nAlmeida, Ciudad Rodrigo, and Badajoz, which had all been in the hands\r\nof the allies in the summer of 1810, but were now French fortresses. To\r\nsubdue these three places he required a large battering-train, properly\r\nequipped for movement, and such a thing was not at his disposition.\r\nThere were a number of heavy guns mounted on the Lines of Torres\r\nVedras, and on the ramparts of Elvas, Abrantes, and Peniche. There were\r\nalso many companies of Portuguese gunners attached to those guns, and\r\na lesser number of British companies which had been immobilized in the\r\nLisbon lines. But heavy guns and gunners combined do not complete a\r\nbattering train. An immense amount of transport was required, and in\r\nthe spring of 1811 it was not at Wellington’s disposition. Well-nigh\r\nevery available ox-cart and mule in Portugal was already employed\r\nin carrying the provisions and baggage of the field army. And water\r\ntransport, which would have been very valuable, could only be used for\r\na few miles of the lower courses of the Tagus and Douro. To begin a\r\nregular siege of Almeida in April, 1811, was absolutely impossible,\r\nnot because there were not guns or gunners in Portugal, but because\r\nthere were no means of moving them at the time. Wellington did not\r\neven attempt it, contenting himself with a mere blockade. On the other\r\nflank an endeavour was made to besiege Badajoz, but this was only\r\npossible because within a few miles of that city lay the Portuguese\r\nfortress of Elvas, from whose walls was borrowed the hastily improvised\r\nand imperfect battering-train with which the Spanish stronghold was\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\nThe first two sieges of Badajoz in 1811 were lamentable failures,\r\nprecisely because this haphazard battering-train was wholly inadequate\r\nfor the end to which it was applied. Alexander Dickson, the zealous\r\nand capable officer placed in charge of the artillery, was set an\r\nimpossible task. He had about 400 Portuguese and 120 English gunners,\r\nall equally untrained in siege duty, to work a strange collection of\r\nantiquated and unserviceable cannon. The pieces borrowed from Elvas\r\nwere of irregular calibre and ancient pattern. Almost incredible as\r\nit may appear, some of these long brass 24-pounders were nearly two\r\nhundred years old—observers noted on them the arms and cyphers not only\r\nof John IV. the first king of the Braganza dynasty, but of Philip III.\r\nand Philip IV. of Spain, the contemporaries of our James I. and Charles\r\nI.[286] Even the better guns were of obsolete eighteenth-century types.\r\nNo two had the same bore, nor were the shot supplied for them uniform\r\nin size; it was necessary to cull and select a special heap of balls\r\nfor each particular gun. The whole formed, indeed, a sort of artillery\r\nmuseum rather than an effective battering-train. The guns shot wildly\r\nand weakly, and their gunners were inexperienced. No wonder that their\r\neffect was poor.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all: indeed, the inefficiency of the guns was perhaps\r\nthe secondary rather than the primary cause of the failure of the two\r\nearly sieges of Badajoz. More important still was it that Wellington\r\nwas as weak in the engineer as in the artillery arm. The number of\r\ntrained officers of engineers with the Peninsular Army was very\r\nsmall—not much over thirty; but of rank and file to serve under them\r\nthere were practically none. Of the corps called the “Royal Military\r\nArtificers,” the ancestors of the “Royal Sappers and Miners,” there\r\nwere actually only thirty-four attached to the army in 1810, and it\r\nwas far on in 1811 before their numbers reached a hundred. Many of them\r\nwere with Wellington’s field army on the distant frontier of Beira,\r\nand before Badajoz, in May, there were little more than a score. For\r\nthe trench-work of the siege untrained volunteers had to be borrowed\r\nfrom the line battalions, and to be instructed by the engineer officers\r\nactually under the fire of the French guns. Their teachers were almost\r\nall as ignorant of practical siege operations as themselves; the\r\nBritish Army, as has already been remarked, had done little work of the\r\nsort for many years.\r\n\r\nThe officers, it is true, were zealous and often clever; the men\r\nwere recklessly brave, if unpractised in the simplest elements of\r\nsiegecraft. But good-will could not atone for want of experience, and\r\nit seems clear that in these early sieges the plans were often unwise,\r\nand the execution unskilful. The points of attack selected at Badajoz\r\nwere the strongest and least accessible points of the fortress, not\r\nthose against which the French had operated in their earlier siege in\r\nFebruary with success. This choice had been made because the British\r\nwere working “against time”; there were French armies collecting\r\nfor the relief of Badajoz, and if the leaguer took many weeks, it\r\nwas certain that an overwhelming force would be brought against the\r\nbesiegers and compel them to depart. Hence the engineer officers,\r\nin both the unsuccessful sieges, tried to break in at points where\r\nvictory would be decisive; they thought it would be useless to begin\r\nby capturing outworks, or by making a lodgment in the lower parts of\r\nthe city, which would leave its stronger points intact and capable of\r\nfurther defence. They battered the high-lying fort of San Cristobal,\r\nand the citadel on its precipitous height, arguing that if they could\r\ncapture either of them the whole fortress was at their mercy. Both\r\nthe points assailed turned out to be too strong: the stony hill of\r\nSan Cristobal proved impossible for trench work; desperate attempts\r\nto storm the fort that crowned it, by columns advancing across the\r\nopen, were beaten off with heavy loss. The castle walls, after long\r\nbattering, refused to crumble into practicable breaches. Before\r\nanything decisive had been accomplished, the French armies of succour\r\ncame up. Beresford beat the first at Albuera in May and renewed the\r\nsiege; the second (Soult and Marmont combined) was so strong that\r\nWellington dared not face it, and withdrew from his abandoned trenches\r\nto within the Portuguese frontier in July.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colonel Dickson’s Work]\r\n\r\nA great change for the better in Wellington’s position as regards\r\nsieges had been made by the autumn of 1811. He had at last received\r\na number of good modern British iron guns, much superior to the old\r\nPortuguese brass 24-pounders. And with infinite trouble and delay he\r\nhad at last created a battering-train that could move. This was the\r\nwork of Alexander Dickson, already mentioned, who was occupied from\r\nJuly to November in accumulating at the obscure town of Villa da\r\nPonte, behind Almeida, masses of waggon-transport and trains of mules\r\nand oxen, for the moving of the heavy cannon and the immense store of\r\nammunition belonging to them. The guns were brought up the Douro to\r\nLamego, where the river ceased to be navigable, and then dragged over\r\nthe hills by oxen. Several companies of Portuguese and British gunners\r\nwere attached to the park, and instructed, so far as was possible, in\r\nsiege work. At the same time the military artificers—still far too few\r\nin numbers—were instructing volunteers from the line in the making of a\r\ngreat store of gabions, platforms, fascines, and other necessaries.\r\n\r\nThis long preparation, which was almost unsuspected by the French,\r\nbecause it was unostentatious and made at a great distance from the\r\nfront, enabled Wellington to execute the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in\r\nJanuary, 1812, with unexampled rapidity and success. The fortress\r\nwas not one of the first class, the garrison was rather weak, the\r\nbattering-train was now ample for the task required of it, and, to the\r\nsurprise and dismay of Marmont, Rodrigo fell after a siege of only\r\ntwelve days at midwinter (January 7–19) long before he could collect\r\nhis scattered divisions for its relief.\r\n\r\nThe third attack on Badajoz, in March-April, 1812, turned out a much\r\nless satisfactory business, though it ended in a triumphant success.\r\nLike the two sieges of the preceding year, it was conducted “against\r\ntime”; Wellington being fully aware that if it went on too long the\r\nrelieving armies would be upon him. The means employed were more\r\nadequate than those of 1811, though only a part of the battering-train\r\nthat had subdued Ciudad Rodrigo could be brought across the hills from\r\nthe distant frontier of Beira. The remainder was composed of ship-guns\r\nborrowed from Lisbon. But though the artillery was not inadequate, and\r\nthe walls were thoroughly well breached, both the trench-work and the\r\nstorm cost over-many lives. Indeed, the main assault on the breaches\r\nfailed, and the town fell because two subsidiary attacks by escalade,\r\none carried out by Picton, the other by General Walker with a brigade\r\nof the 5th Division, were both triumphantly successful. Wellington laid\r\nthe blame of the fearful loss of life upon the fact that his engineers\r\nhad no trained sappers to help them, and were unskilled in siegecraft.\r\nThey had attacked a point of the defences far more promising than those\r\nbattered in 1811, and had opened up immense gaps in the defences, but\r\nnevertheless he was not satisfied with their direction. In a private\r\nletter to Lord Liverpool, which is not printed in either of the two\r\nseries of his dispatches, he wrote:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE VII._\r\n\r\nPRIVATE OF HEAVY DRAGOONS.\r\n\r\n1809.\r\n\r\nOFFICER OF FIELD ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\n1809.]\r\n\r\n“The capture of Badajoz affords as strong an instance of the gallantry\r\nof our troops as has ever been displayed. But I anxiously hope that I\r\nshall never again be the instrument of putting them to such a test as\r\nthat to which they were put last night. I assure your lordship that it\r\nis quite impossible to carry fortified places by ‘_vive force_’ without\r\nincurring great loss, and being exposed to the chance of failure,\r\nunless the army should be provided with a sufficient trained corps\r\nof sappers and miners.... The consequence of being so unprovided with\r\nthe people necessary to approach a regularly fortified place are,\r\nfirst, that our engineers, though well-educated and brave, have never\r\nturned their minds to the mode of conducting a regular siege, as it\r\nis useless to think of that which it is impossible, in our service,\r\nto perform. They think they have done their duty when they have\r\nconstructed a battery with a secure communication to it, which can\r\nbreach the place. Secondly, these breaches have to be carried by _vive\r\nforce_, at an infinite sacrifice of officers and soldiers.... These\r\ngreat losses could be avoided, and, in my opinion, time gained in every\r\nsiege, if we had properly trained people to carry it on. I declare that\r\nI have never seen breaches more practicable in themselves than the\r\nthree in the walls of Badajoz, and the fortress must have surrendered\r\nwith these breaches open, if I had been able to ‘approach’ the place.\r\nBut when I had made the third breach on the evening of the 6th, I could\r\ndo no more. I was then obliged either to storm or to give the business\r\nup, and when I ordered the assault, I was certain that I should lose\r\nour best officers and men. It is a cruel situation for any person to be\r\nplaced in, and I earnestly recommend to your lordship to have a corps\r\nof sappers and miners formed without loss of time.”[287]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington and His Engineers]\r\n\r\nThe slaughter of Badajoz, then, in Wellington’s estimation, was due\r\npartly to the fact that the British Army, unlike all other armies,\r\nlacked regular companies of sappers and miners, and partly to the\r\ninexperience of the engineer officers in carrying out the last stages\r\nof a siege—the advance towards the glacis and the ditch by scientific\r\ntrench-work. They did not, he says, “turn their mind” towards such\r\noperations, because they had never been furnished with skilled workmen\r\nto carry them out. That sappers and miners did not exist as yet was not\r\nthe fault of Wellington, nor of the ministers, but of the professional\r\nadvisers of the administration, who should long ago have pointed out\r\nthat such a corps was wanted. That the Liverpool ministry was not\r\nslow to take advice was shown by the fact that they at once converted\r\nthe already existing “Military Artificers” into sappers. On April 23,\r\nless than three weeks after Badajoz fell, a warrant was issued for\r\ninstructing the corps in military field works, and shortly after six\r\ncompanies were ordered to be sent to the Peninsula the moment that they\r\nshould have received such training. On August 4 the name of the whole\r\ncorps was changed from Royal Military Artificers to Royal Sappers and\r\nMiners.[288] It was not, of course, till very late in the year that the\r\nfirst of the new sapper companies joined Wellington, but by the next\r\nspring he had 300 trained men with him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they had of course arrived too late for the siege of\r\nBurgos, the most unhappy of all Wellington’s leaguers, where the\r\nwhole trench-work was conducted by volunteers from the line directed\r\nby precisely eight of the old artificers—of whom one was killed and\r\nthe remaining seven wounded. The story of the Burgos operations reads\r\nlike an exaggerated repetition of the first siege of Badajoz. The\r\nbattering-train that took Badajoz had been left behind, and to attack\r\nBurgos (whose strength was undervalued) Wellington had with him no\r\nproper means. Only eight guns were brought up—because the transport\r\nwith the army could only provide a few spare teams, and the whole of\r\nCastile had been swept clear of draught-beasts. This ridiculously weak\r\ntrain proved wholly insufficient for the work set it. “Had there been\r\na siege establishment with the army even moderately efficient, so as\r\nto have admitted of the performance of the rudiments of the art, the\r\nattack (even with the inadequate artillery) might have been carried\r\nthrough,” writes the historian of the Peninsular sieges.[289] But there\r\nwere only five engineer officers present, just eight artificers, no\r\ntools save regimental picks and shovels borrowed from line regiments,\r\nno _material_ save wood requisitioned from the town of Burgos, and so\r\nlittle transport that the fire had sometimes to cease, to allow fresh\r\nammunition to be brought up from the distant Madrid. Wellington ordered\r\nrepeated assaults on the inadequately battered walls; they all failed,\r\nand he finally retired after thirty-two days of open trenches, and with\r\nthe loss of nearly 2000 men, from before a “bicocque,” as the French\r\ncalled it, which could not have withstood a proper battering-train for\r\na third of that time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Failure at Burgos]\r\n\r\nThe fact is that Wellington had undervalued the strength of Burgos;\r\nhe thought it would fall easily. If he had known that it would hold\r\nout for more than a month, he could have procured more guns from the\r\ncaptured French arsenal at Madrid, and might have requisitioned all\r\nthe beasts of the army to draw them. But by the time that it began to\r\nbe seen that Burgos was not about to yield to a mere demonstration, it\r\nwas too late to get up the necessary means of reducing it. Finally, the\r\nFrench armies mustered for its relief, and the British had to retire.\r\nIt may be added that the besieging troops, thoroughly disgusted with\r\nthe inadequate means used to prepare the way for them, did not act with\r\nthe same energy that had been shown at Rodrigo or Badajoz. Several of\r\nthe assaults were not pushed well home, and the trench-work was slack.\r\nWellington wrote, in his General Orders for October 3, a stiff rebuke,\r\nto the effect that “the officers and soldiers of this army should know\r\nthat to work during a siege is as much a part of their duty as to\r\nengage the enemy in the field; and they may depend upon it that unless\r\nthey perform the work allotted to them with due diligence, they cannot\r\nacquire the honour which their comrades have won in former sieges....\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief hopes he shall have no reason to complain in\r\nfuture.”[290]\r\n\r\nThe leaguer of San Sebastian, the last of Wellington’s sieges, bore\r\na great likeness to the last siege of Badajoz. It was conducted in\r\na time of considerable anxiety, while the army of Soult was making\r\nvigorous and repeated efforts to frustrate it. The place was strong\r\nby nature—a towering castle with the town at its foot joined to the\r\nmainland only by a narrow sandy spit; the defences of this isthmus\r\nwere short, and reached from sea to sea: they were fully commanded by\r\nthe castle behind. The first great assault (July 25, 1813) was made\r\nwhile the trenches were still far from the walls, and while the fire\r\nof the besieged had not been silenced. It failed with heavy loss. The\r\nsecond assault (August 31) was successful, but very bloody—2000 men\r\nwere killed or wounded. The most authoritative commentator writes:\r\n“The operations against San Sebastian afford a most impressive lesson\r\non the advantages of proceeding step by step, and with due attention\r\nto science and rule. The attempt there made to overcome or trample on\r\nsuch restrictions caused a certain operation of twenty days to extend\r\nto sixty. It bears strong testimony to the truth of the maxim laid down\r\nby Marshal Vauban: ‘La précipitation dans les sièges ne hâte point\r\nla prise des places, la retarde souvent, et ensanglante toujours la\r\nscène.’”[291]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trench Work]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that siege-work was loathed by the rank and file,\r\nnot so much for its danger—there was never any lack of volunteers for\r\na forlorn hope—but for its discomfort. There was a sort of underlying\r\nfeeling that entrenching was not soldier’s but navvy’s work; the\r\nlong hiding under cover in cramped positions, which was absolutely\r\nnecessary, was looked upon as a sort of skulking. With an unwise\r\ndisregard for their personal safety, which had a touch of bravado and\r\nmore than a touch of sulkiness in it, the men exposed themselves far\r\nmore than was necessary. I fancy that on some occasions, notably at\r\nthe early sieges of Badajoz and at Burgos, there was a general feeling\r\nthat matters were not being scientifically or adequately conducted, and\r\nthat too much was being asked of the rank and file, when they were\r\nmade to attempt a hard task without the proper means. It must have been\r\nclear to them that there were too few engineer officers, not enough\r\nartillery, and no proper provision of tools. Hence came a spirit of\r\nanger and discontent.\r\n\r\nAt Ciudad Rodrigo, and at the third and last leaguer of Badajoz, the\r\nweather was so abominable that the siege-work was long looked back\r\non as a perfect nightmare. At Rodrigo, in the high upland of Leon,\r\nthe month of January was a combination of frost and rain; the water\r\naccumulated in the trenches and there often froze, so that the men\r\nwere standing ankle-deep in a mixture of ice and mud, and since they\r\ncould not move about, because of the enemy’s incessant fire, suffered\r\nhorribly from cold. At Badajoz there was no frost: but incessant\r\nchilling rain was almost as bad during the early weeks of the siege;\r\nthe trenches were often two feet deep in water, and the work of the\r\nspade was almost useless, since the liquid mud that was shovelled\r\nup ran away in streams out of the gabions into which it was cast,\r\nand refused to pile up into parapets for the trenches, spreading out\r\ninstead into mere broad accumulations of slime, which gave no cover,\r\nand had no resisting power against the round shot of the garrison.\r\nI imagine that the desperate and dirty toil in those operations,\r\nprotracted over many days of abominable discomfort as well as danger,\r\naccounts in great measure for the ferocious spirit shown by the victors\r\nboth at Rodrigo and Badajoz. The men were in a blind rage at the misery\r\nwhich they had been enduring, and it found vent, after the storm was\r\nover, in misconduct far surpassing that which would have followed a\r\npitched battle where the losses had been equally great. One observer\r\nwrites: “The spirit of the soldiers rose to a frightful height—I say\r\nfrightful because it was not of that sort which denoted exultation at\r\nthe prospect of achieving an exploit which was about to hold them up\r\nto the admiration of the world; there was a certain _something_ in\r\ntheir bearing which told plainly that they had suffered fatigues of\r\nwhich they had not complained, and seen their comrades and officers\r\nslain around them without repining, but that they had smarted under\r\nthe one and felt acutely for the other. They smothered both, so long\r\nas body and mind were employed, but now, before the storm, they had a\r\nmomentary licence to think, and every fine feeling vanished—plunder and\r\nrevenge took their place.... A quiet but desperate calm replaced their\r\nusual buoyant spirits, and nothing was observable in their manner but a\r\ntiger-like expression of anxiety to seize upon their prey.”[292]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Waiting for the Storm]\r\n\r\nPreparation for the storm affected different men in different ways:\r\nsome tried to make up old quarrels and exchanged words of forgiveness;\r\na good many wrote letters home, which were to be delivered only in\r\nthe case of their falling. “Each arranged himself for the combat\r\nin such manner as his fancy would admit of: some by lowering their\r\ncartridge-boxes, others by turning them to the front for more\r\nconvenient use; others unclasped their stocks or opened their shirt\r\ncollars; others oiled their bayonets. Those who had them took leave\r\nof their wives and children—an affecting sight, but not so much so as\r\nmight have been expected, because the women, from long habit, were\r\naccustomed to such scenes of danger.”[293]\r\n\r\nOne intelligent sergeant speaks of the moment of waiting for the order\r\nto storm as full of a stress that nothing else could produce: “We felt\r\na dead weight hanging on our minds; had we been brought hurriedly into\r\naction, it would have been quite different, but it is inconsistent with\r\nthe nature of man not to feel as I have described. The long warning,\r\nthe dark and silent night, the known strength of the fortress, the\r\nimminent danger of the attack, all conspired to produce this feeling.\r\nIt was not the result of want of courage, as was shown by the calm\r\nintrepidity of the advance when we came in range of the French\r\ncannon.”[294] That the revulsion from the long waiting took the shape\r\nof frenzied violence, when the men were at last let loose, was not\r\nunnatural. A certain amount of the horrors which took place at Badajoz\r\nand San Sebastian may be ascribed to mere frenzy, if the rest was due\r\nto more deliberate wickedness on the part of the baser spirits of the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nUNIFORMS AND WEAPONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout going into the niceties of regimental detail, which were fully\r\ndeveloped by 1809, it is necessary to give a certain attention to the\r\ndress of the army—we might almost add, to its occasional want of dress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Concerning Head-Gear]\r\n\r\nThe Peninsular Army was fortunate in having started just late enough\r\nto be rid of the worst of the unpractical clothing—the legacy of the\r\neighteenth century—which had afflicted the troops of the earlier years\r\nof the war. The odd hat, shaped something like a civilian beaver,\r\nwith a shaving-brush at the side, which had been worn in Holland and\r\nEgypt, had just been superseded for the rank and file by a light felt\r\nshako, with brass plate in front,[295] and a woollen tuft with the\r\nregimental colours (worn sometimes in front, sometimes at the side),\r\nand ornamented with white loops and tassels.[296] This was a light\r\nhead-dress, compared with what had gone before, and no less with the\r\nheavy, bell-topped leather shakos that were to come after. Wellington\r\nprotested against an early attempt to introduce these, saying that he\r\nalways knew his own troops at a distance, even when great-coated, by\r\nthe fact that their shakos were narrower at the crown than the base,\r\nwhile the French headgear was always bell-topped, swelling out from the\r\nbottom to the crown, and the distinction was useful. The felt shako\r\nhad a peak to protect the eyes from the sun, and a chin-strap. It was a\r\nserviceable head-dress, whose only fault was that, after long wear, and\r\nexposure to much rain, the felt became soft and might crease or bulge,\r\nand then dry into unsightly and lop-sided shapes.[297]\r\n\r\nDown to 1811, officers of the line, except in rifle and light infantry\r\ncorps, were wearing cocked hats, as had been the custom since the\r\neighteenth century. The new clothing which came out in 1812 had\r\nshakos (of a more ornamental sort) for officers as well as men. The\r\nvery sensible reason for the change was that obvious difference in\r\ndress between commissioned and non-commissioned ranks enabled the\r\nenemy’s marksmen to single out the officers, and to give them more\r\nthan their fair share of bullets. The discarded cocked hat had been\r\na stupid survival—a “burlesque of a _chapeau_ usually topped by some\r\nextraordinary-looking feather,” says one wearer of it, while others\r\nwore it without any feather at all. The “cut-down” hat, exactly a span\r\nin height, was all the rage in the Lines of Torres Vedras during the\r\nwinter of 1810–11.[298] The felt shako was an enormous improvement in\r\nevery way. After 1811, only generals and staff officers, engineers,\r\ndoctors, commissaries, and drum-majors retained the cocked hat. The\r\nlast case that I remember of its being used in the line was that of\r\nLieutenant Maguire, of the 4th, who, leading the “forlorn hope” at the\r\nstorm of San Sebastian (Aug., 1813) put on a cocked hat with a white\r\nfeather “to make himself conspicuous and recognizable.” Clearly this\r\nhead-dress was by that date wholly abnormal.[299]\r\n\r\nAnother evil which the Peninsular Army escaped also belonged to the\r\nhead. Pigtails and hair-powder went out in 1808—an immense boon. As one\r\nwho had endured them says, “The hair required to be soaped, floured,\r\nand frizzed, in order to be tortured into an uncouth shape, which gave\r\nthe man acute pain, and robbed him of the power of turning his head\r\neasily, unless he brought his body round with it.” The grease and flour\r\nmatted the hair, and inclined towards all sorts of scalp diseases.\r\nWellington, who had discarded hair-powder and dressing long before\r\nmost officers,[300] must have been rejoiced when it became legally\r\npermissible to do without it in all ranks. It was not every one who\r\nagreed with him—a few old-fashioned men still wore pigtails and powder\r\nfor some time in the Peninsula; but they soon died out.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1808, that these monstrosities vanished another\r\naffliction was relieved. Trousers of a blue-grey colour were\r\nsubstituted for breeches and gaiters, as service dress, just before the\r\nfirst brigades sailed, in 1808. The many-buttoned gaiters to the knee\r\nhad been an intolerable nuisance; there was every temptation not to\r\nstrip them off at all, when it took twelve minutes to button them up\r\nefficiently, more if they were wet through. Hence troops liable to be\r\nalarmed at any moment were tempted not to take them off at all for many\r\ndays, which led to uncleanliness and diseases in the legs. Trousers\r\nwere a great improvement—they were less tight, and could be easily\r\nslipped into and out of. Under the trousers short boots (often called\r\nshoes) were worn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Regimental Coat]\r\n\r\nThe coat for all ranks in the infantry was cut short in front,\r\nand had fairly small tails; it still preserved, more or less, the\r\nlate eighteenth century cut in this respect, but differed from the\r\nearlier type in having the stiff upstanding collar supported by a\r\nleather stock, an evil device which constricted the neck and tended\r\nto apoplexy. On hard service, such as storming parties, the men\r\nunbuttoned their collars and threw their stocks aside.[301] The most\r\ncharacteristic point that strikes the eye in pictures of the rank and\r\nfile of the Peninsular period is the series of white stripes across the\r\nfront of the coat, caused by the ornamental prolongation of the button\r\nguards. Bayonet and cartouche box were supported by the broad white\r\nleather cross-belts, ornamented with a brass plate with the regimental\r\nbadge. The very heavy knapsack, normally of oilskin or glazed canvas,\r\nwas supported by a separate attachment of straps passing under the\r\narm-pits. The whole kit weighed some sixty pounds, when the canteen\r\nand haversack are taken into consideration. Officers had only a single\r\nleather belt coming from the right shoulder to the left hip, to sustain\r\nthe sword, and wore their red silk sashes girt tight, in several turns\r\naround their waists.\r\n\r\nOne of Wellington’s most sensible traits was an intense dislike of\r\nworrying officers or men about details of uniform on active service.\r\n“Provided we brought our men into the field well appointed,” says\r\nGrattan of the 88th, “with their sixty rounds of ammunition each, he\r\nnever looked to see whether trousers were black, blue, or grey: and\r\nas to ourselves, we might be rigged out in any colour of the rainbow\r\nif we fancied it.” The consequence was that scarcely any two officers\r\nwere dressed alike! Some wore grey braided coats, others brown: some\r\nagain liked blue; many (from choice, or perhaps necessity) stuck to the\r\n“old red rag.” Some wore long-skirted frock-coats, as better protection\r\nto the loins than the orthodox regimental cut. There are some curious\r\nrecords of the odd clothing in which officers finished a campaign. One\r\nrecords that he did the Burgos retreat in a garment improvised from the\r\ncassock of a priest, slit up and cut short and furnished with buttons.\r\nAnother, a captain in the 29th, landing in Great Britain in a braided\r\npelisse and a fancy waistcoat with silver buttons of Spanish filigree\r\nwork, was taken for some sort of French prisoner by a worthy general,\r\nwho congratulated him on being allowed such freedom in the place of\r\nhis captivity.[302] As to the men, they wore anything that could be\r\ngot: a quantity of French trousers found at the capture of Madrid, in\r\nthe Retiro fort, were issued to some corps. A more rough expedient was\r\nthat of a colonel with a very ragged regiment in the winter of 1813–14,\r\nwho allowed blankets to be cut up by the regimental tailors, to make\r\nup into trousers for such of the men as were absolutely disreputable\r\nin appearance. The battalion made some sensation when it marched into\r\nMont-de-Marsan a few days later.[303]\r\n\r\nAll this did not vex Wellington’s soul in the least—from Picton’s\r\ntall beaver hat to the blanket-trousers, he saw and disregarded every\r\ndetail. He himself was the most simply dressed man in the army, with\r\nhis small cocked hat unornamented save by the English and Portuguese\r\ncockades, his blue, tight-buttoned frock-coat, and the short cloak with\r\ncape which has been immortalized by a score of statues and pictures.\r\n\r\nI ought, perhaps, to mention that the winter-clothing for the infantry\r\nwas a grey pepper-and-salt coloured great coat, of very thick cloth,\r\nwith a cape reaching down to nearly the elbow, so as to give a double\r\nthickness of protection to the shoulders. There was also an oilskin\r\ncover to the felt shako, which could not always be easily adjusted to\r\nthe latter, when it had got distorted in shape from much wear. Plate\r\nNo. 8 gives an illustration of this costume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE VIII._\r\n\r\nSERGEANT AND PRIVATE OF INFANTRY IN WINTER MARCHING ORDER.\r\n\r\n1813.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Peninsular Army first started on its campaigns, the heavy\r\ndragoons were the most archaic-looking corps in it, for they still wore\r\nthe broad and heavy cocked hats, which had prevailed in all armies\r\nduring the middle years of George III., and jack boots up to the knee.\r\nThis headgear, which after a single campaign in the tropical rains\r\nof the Peninsula always became sodden and shapeless, and hung down\r\nlimply towards the shoulders, was fortunately abolished by a royal\r\nwarrant of August, 1812, and during the following winter many of the\r\nheavy dragoon regiments received brass helmets of a classical shape,\r\nwith a crest and plume, which, though rather heavy, were an immense\r\nimprovement on their former shapeless hats. At the same time they were\r\ngiven instead of jack-boots (which had made skirmishing on foot almost\r\nimpossible) grey cloth overalls, with a broad red stripe, and short\r\nboots. This was the dress of the heavies in 1813–14 and during the\r\nWaterloo campaign.\r\n\r\nThe light dragoons had gone to the Peninsula in 1808 with the black\r\njapanned helmet with a bearskin crest along its crown, which had been\r\nin use since the time of the American War. With it they wore blue coats\r\nwith white froggings, and buckskin breeches with Hessian boots. The\r\ngeneral effect was handsome, and in use the dress was not unpractical.\r\nGeneral Foy mentions it with approval in his history. The French\r\noutposts were much puzzled when, at the commencement of the Vittoria\r\ncampaign, the English vedettes and outposts appeared in a new uniform,\r\nwhich was introduced for light cavalry at the same time as the changes\r\nmade for heavy cavalry just mentioned above. It was at first suspected\r\nthat new regiments had been joining from England. The 1813 uniform\r\nsubstituted, for the black helmet with fur, a shako with a small\r\nupright plume, slightly bell-topped in shape, and with ornamental cord\r\nand tassels. It looks as if it had been suggested by the head-dress of\r\nthe French _chasseurs à cheval_, and was much too like it to please\r\nWellington. At the same time the blue jacket barred with white lace\r\nwas changed for a blue coat, with a very broad plastron of the colour\r\nof the regimental facings in front, extending from collar to waist,\r\nand the buckskin breeches were replaced by tight-fitting breeches of\r\nwebbing. This was the Waterloo uniform of all light dragoon regiments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cavalry Uniforms]\r\n\r\nThe large majority of the British cavalry regiments in the Peninsula\r\nwere light dragoons: for the first three years of Wellington’s command\r\nthere were only three heavy dragoon regiments in the field, and no\r\nBritish hussars. Of the latter, a new introduction in the national\r\nArmy, there was one brigade present in 1808 during Sir John Moore’s\r\noperations,[304] and the same regiments came out in 1813, to see the\r\nlast year of the war.[305] During the greater part of Wellington’s\r\ncampaigns the only hussars present with the army were Hanoverians,\r\nthe very efficient corps belonging to the King’s German Legion. The\r\nfantastic hussar uniform of the period, a development from a much\r\nsimpler Hungarian original, is well known. Over a jacket fitting\r\ntight to the body, was worn the furred and braided pelisse, which was\r\nusually not completely put on, but flung back, so as to hang over the\r\nleft shoulder. It flapped behind, and was a hindrance rather than a\r\ncovering. On the legs long overalls were worn. The head-dress was a\r\nvery large fur cap, or, as it would have been called later, a busby.\r\nI find very severe criticisms on this head-gear. One officer says,\r\n“These flimsy, muff-like appendages encumber the heads of our soldiers.\r\nThe awkward cap, being constructed partly of pasteboard, soaks up a\r\ngreat quantity of wet during the violent rains of this country, and\r\nso becomes unbearably heavy and disagreeable, while it affords no\r\nprotection to the wearer. At all times it can be cut down to his skull\r\nwith the greatest ease.”[306] The cause of its adoption seems to have\r\nbeen rather the Prince Regent’s eye for splendour in military costume\r\nthan anything else. For strength and protection, no less than comfort,\r\nthe light helmet of the early dragoons was universally preferred by\r\ncritics. Later improvements made the busby more solid and less heavy,\r\nbut in 1808 it was evidently a most unsatisfactory head-dress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Artillery Uniforms]\r\n\r\nArtillery uniform may be described in a few words. That of the horse\r\nartillery was a close copy of that of the original light dragoon—black\r\njapanned helmet with fur crest, blue jacket laced with gold (instead\r\nof the dragoon’s silver) and buckskin breeches. Field artillery, on\r\nthe other hand, were clothed almost exactly like infantry of the\r\nline, save that their coats were blue instead of red. Their tall felt\r\nshako and tuft, trousers, and coat with white stripes, were exactly\r\nsimilar to those of the linesmen. Engineer officers wore a dress like\r\nthat of line officers before the shako came in, having a cocked hat\r\ndown to the end of the war, and trousers. The rank and file of that\r\ndepartment—Royal Military Artificers down to 1812,[307] Royal Sappers\r\nand Miners after—had shako and blue coat down to 1813, but changed the\r\nlatter for a red coat, like that of the line, in the last-named year.\r\nIt was braided with yellow across the front instead of white, the only\r\npractical difference in appearance.\r\n\r\nDoctors and commissaries down to the end of the war were wearing a\r\ncocked hat, like that of a general or a staff officer. Hence some queer\r\nmistakes, when these peaceful gentlemen were mistaken for combatant\r\nofficers, the colour of their plume, the one differentiating point,\r\nfailing to be observed in the dusk or in dirty weather. It is said that\r\nsome young commissaries were prone to pass themselves off as staff\r\nofficers on the Spanish and Portuguese peasantry, and even on local\r\nauthorities. A ridiculous anecdote is told of Doctor Maurice Quill,\r\nthe surgeon of the Connaught Rangers, who was the best-known humorist\r\nin the army.[308] A general, who caught a glimpse of his cocked hat\r\nbehind a hedge, took him for a staff-officer shirking, and hunted him\r\nfor some time from cover to cover, the doctor meanwhile shouting back\r\nto him, “I’m off; seen plenty of fighting for one day.” It was only\r\nwhen he took refuge with his mules and medical panniers, that his irate\r\npursuer discovered that he was not a combatant officer. Other wearers\r\nof the cocked hat were the drum-majors of the line, who are said to\r\nhave had much adulation paid to them by the country-folk, because of\r\ntheir enormous gold-laced head-dress and lavish display of braiding,\r\nwhich caused them to be taken for brigadiers at the least.\r\n\r\nThe most distinctive infantry uniform in the whole army was that of\r\nthe rifle battalions, whose sombre colours contrasted in the most\r\nmarked way with the red of the British and the bright blue of the\r\nPortuguese line. The dress of the 5/60th and the two light battalions\r\nof the K.G.L. differed from that of the three battalions of the 95th,\r\nin that while both wore the dark rifle-green jacket, the three German\r\nunits had grey-blue trousers not unlike those of the line, while the\r\nlatter were in green from head to foot. All wore black shakos of a\r\nhigh shape, like those of other regiments, and with a green tuft or\r\nball at the front. The accoutrements were all black, in order to avoid\r\nthe showing of light or shining points on the body, when the men were\r\ndispersed in skirmishing. In the head-dress of the officers there was\r\na certain variety, the 5/60th and 1st Light battalion K.G.L. having a\r\ntall shako similar to that of their rank and file, while those of the\r\n95th and the 2nd Light battalion K.G.L. had a peculiar head-dress,\r\nsomething like that of an eighteenth-century hussar; it was a tall,\r\nnarrow cap, much adorned with diagonal twists of braid, and destitute\r\nof the peak to shade the eyes which formed part of the normal shako;\r\nit had a green tuft at the front. The 95th officers for some time wore\r\nover their tight jackets a black furred and braided pelisse, in the\r\nhussar style—surely a most absurd and inconvenient encumbrance for men\r\nwho were continually scrambling through hedges, and working among\r\nthick brushwood. When thrown back, as it seems generally to have been,\r\nit must have caught in every possible twig. The officers’ jackets were\r\ndistinguished from the plain-breasted coat of the rank and file by\r\nhaving a great quantity of narrow braiding across the front: they all\r\nwore falling “wings,” instead of epaulettes. The Portuguese caçador\r\nuniform, save that it was brown and not bottle-green, reproduced very\r\nclosely the cut and form of that of the 5/60th.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “Brown Bess”]\r\n\r\nA word as to armament naturally follows on notes concerning uniform.\r\nThe weapon that mainly won the Peninsular victories was the “Tower\r\nmusket” of the line battalions, the famous “Brown Bess.” It was a heavy\r\nflint-lock, fitted with a pan, and weighing about nine pounds. Its\r\neffective range was about 300 yards, but no accurate shooting could be\r\nrelied upon at any range over 100. Indeed, the man who could hit an\r\nindividual at that distance must not only have been a good shot, but\r\nhave possessed a firelock of over average quality. Compared with the\r\nrifle, already a weapon of precision, it was but a haphazard sort of\r\narm. At any distance over the 100 yards the firing-line relied upon the\r\ngeneral effect of the volley that it gave, rather than on the shooting\r\nof each man. Nevertheless, the British musket was decidedly a stronger,\r\nbetter made and more accurate weapon than that used by Continental\r\narmies, and was much preferred by our Spanish and Portuguese allies to\r\nthose of their own manufacture. Its calibre was sixteen, its missile\r\nwas a round leaden bullet (a little heavier than the French ball,\r\nwhose weight was twenty to the pound), and made up with a stout paper\r\ncartridge, of which each man normally carried sixty. In order to secure\r\ncertain ignition by the snapping of the flint, the butt-end of the\r\ncartridge had to be torn open by the teeth, before it was placed in the\r\nmusket barrel, and a splash of powder had to be thrown into the pan\r\nto catch the spark and communicate it to the cartridge. The latter\r\nwas driven down the barrel by an iron ramrod. Raw recruits in a moment\r\nof excitement, firing too fast, are said not infrequently to have\r\nforgotten to withdraw the ramrod after loading, and to have shot it\r\naway—which left them helpless.\r\n\r\nThe greatest hindrance to good musketry was wet. Long-continued\r\nrain might penetrate the cartouch box, and damp all the powder, so\r\nthat every cartridge missed fire. But even a sudden heavy squall\r\nmight drench the particular cartridge that was being handled, and\r\nmake its torn-open end incapable of ignition. Or it might wash the\r\npriming-powder out of the pan, or damp it into a paste, so that it\r\ncould not catch fire. In either case, infantry fighting in a rainstorm\r\ncould not count on any certain fire-effect; not one shot in four might\r\ngo off, and troops surprised in open order by cavalry would be very\r\nhelpless. Their only chance of salvation would be to form square and\r\ntrust to the defensive power of the bayonet. The latter weapon was\r\nlong, triangular, and rather heavy; its weight did not make accurate\r\nshooting easier, when it was fixed.\r\n\r\nThere was a somewhat lighter and more carefully made weapon for light\r\ninfantry battalions, called the light infantry musket; except that its\r\nsights were more accurately seen to, and that its length was slightly\r\nless, I cannot find that it greatly differed from the normal Tower\r\nmusket. The same may be said of the _fusil_, which was an older type\r\nof light musket, which had originally given its name to all fusiliers.\r\nThe last time that it occurs in use, was when it was given during the\r\nlatter years of the war to the experimental home battalions, into which\r\nboys under seventeen were drafted. To suit their short stature and\r\nyounger muscles, fusils instead of full-sized muskets were served out\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Baker Rifle]\r\n\r\nQuite different from all muskets were the rifles served out to the\r\n5/60th, the 95th, and the Light Battalions of the K.G.L. The pattern\r\nwas called the Baker rifle, from its inventor. It was a short weapon\r\nwith a barrel two and a half feet long, furnished with seven grooves\r\nwithin, which made a quarter-turn in the length of the barrel. Its\r\ncalibre was a twenty bore, and it was stiff to load. An interesting\r\nletter from one of the majors of the 5/60th to the assistant\r\nadjutant-general at Cork, written just before the battalion sailed\r\nfor Portugal, makes a demand for 450 small mallets, for the purpose\r\nof forcing the bullet down the barrel. “They should be made of hard\r\nwood, with a handle about six inches long, pierced with a hole at the\r\nextremity for fastening a string to it.” Major Davy adds that “the\r\ninstrument is absolutely necessary,” and a mallet for every two men\r\nshould be furnished.[309] These tools, however, were in use only for a\r\nfew months, were found not indispensable, and were finally withdrawn.\r\nBut to ram the ball home was always a hard job, owing to the grooves.\r\nThe rifleman carried no bayonet, his second weapon being a very short\r\nand curved sword, more useful for wood-chopping than anything else.\r\n\r\nSergeants were not yet armed like the rank and file, except in\r\nthe rifle battalions, where they carried the normal weapon of the\r\n“Baker” type. In the Guards and line alike they had a seven-foot\r\nspear with a cross-piece below the head, to prevent over-penetration\r\nafter a thrust.[310] The names of pike and halberd were used for it\r\nindifferently, though the former was the more correct, the original\r\nhalberd having been a cut-and-thrust weapon with an edge as well as\r\na point. In addition, the sergeant carried a brass-hilted sword at\r\nhis left side. I have never found any mention of its being used, the\r\nhalberd being always the preferred weapon—though in action a sergeant\r\noften picked up a dead man’s musket, and joined in the firing.[311]\r\nBut, _en revanche_, I have found a confession by a newly made sergeant\r\nof his having caught it between his legs, and had a nasty fall, on\r\nhis first appearance with the three stripes. The weapon was slightly\r\ncurved, and meant for cutting rather than thrusting.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the infantry officer’s sword was quite straight and\r\nrather light, a thrusting weapon essentially. There are many complaints\r\nthat it was too slight for its work—_e.g._ it had no chance against a\r\nFrench cavalry sword, which would always batter it down, when the two\r\nclashed in stroke and parry. I have found it called a “toasting-fork,”\r\nand other insulting names. Many officers provided themselves with\r\nforeign weapons of a heavier make, and better adapted for cutting; no\r\nobjection was made to this departure from the regulations. Mounted and\r\nstaff officers carried a different sword—a curved broad-bladed sabre,\r\nof the type of that used by light cavalry. Rifle officers also used a\r\ncurved sabre, of a rather short make, and not the straight infantry\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nHeavy cavalry used the broad-sword with steel hilt and guard, straight\r\nand very heavy. It could be used for the thrust as well as for the\r\ncut, but it would seem that the British dragoons (unlike the French\r\ncuirassiers) always preferred the edge to the point. The sabre of\r\nthe light dragoon and the hussar was a markedly curved weapon, very\r\nbroad in the blade, and only suitable for the stroke, though very\r\noccasionally we hear of a thrust being made.[312] From the enormous\r\nproportion of wounded to killed in engagements where the French and\r\nEnglish light cavalry met, it is clear that the sabres of both sides\r\nwere better suited to maim than to slay. The thrusting sword of the\r\ncuirassiers had a much more terrible reputation.\r\n\r\nThe rank and file of the Royal Sappers and Miners carried muskets\r\nand bayonets like infantry of the line, and their sergeants the\r\nregulation halberd. Horse artillery gunners had sabres of the light\r\ndragoon type; but field artillery only very short curved swords, like\r\nthose of the rifle regiments. The drivers, who were organized as a\r\nseparate corps, had no weapons at all, in order that their attention\r\nmight not be distracted from their horses. This seems to have been a\r\nvery doubtful expedient, leaving them absolutely helpless if attacked\r\nby hostile cavalry. It may have originated from the fact that the\r\ndriver, far into the eighteenth century, had not been a soldier at all,\r\nbut a “waggoner,” a civilian without uniform or arms. It was only in\r\n1794 that the corps of Artillery Drivers was formed upon this rather\r\nunpromising basis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regimental Colours]\r\n\r\nThis is probably the place in which mention should be made of the\r\nstandards under which the army fought.[313] Cavalry banners or\r\n_guidons_ had just gone out—if used at all in the Peninsular War, it\r\nwas only in its first year. Reports from the later years show that all\r\nregiments had left them either at their depôt in England, or in some\r\ncases at Lisbon. But infantry regiments, with few exceptions, took\r\ntheir flags into the field, as was the custom with their successors\r\ndown to the last generation. It was only in the 1880’s that they\r\nfinally ceased to be displayed on active service. The Rifles, always\r\ndestined to fight in extended order, never had colours, and the\r\nregimental annals of some Light Infantry corps (the 68th and 71st)\r\nshow that for similar reasons they had left their standards behind in\r\nEngland. But this was not the case with all Light Infantry: the famous\r\n43rd and 52nd carried them all through the war.\r\n\r\nOf the two battalion colours the one or “King’s Colour” was a large\r\nUnion Jack, with the regiment’s number on a shield or medallion, often\r\nencompassed with a wreath, and sometimes also with the badge of the\r\ncorps, when such existed. The second or Regimental colour was of the\r\nsame hue as the facings of the corps, and only had a small Union Jack\r\nin its upper left corner, next the pole. On the plain silk of the main\r\nsurface of the flag were disposed the number of the regiment, often\r\nin a wreath, and its badges and battle-honours, where such existed.\r\nSince facings had many hues, the main effect of the two flags was very\r\ndifferent, the large Union Jack of the King’s Colour being contrasted\r\nwith the yellow, green, crimson, or white, etc., of the Regimental\r\nColour.\r\n\r\nThe colours were borne in battle by the two junior ensigns of\r\nthe battalion, who had assigned to them for protection several\r\ncolour-sergeants. It was the duty of these non-commissioned officers to\r\ntake charge of the flag if the proper bearer were slain or hurt, and\r\nin many battles both colours came out of action in sergeants’ hands.\r\nThe post of colour-sergeant was honourable but dangerous, for the\r\nenemy’s fire always beat hardest about the standards in the centre of\r\nthe battalion line. Sergeant Lawrence of the 40th notes, in his simple\r\ndiary, that at Waterloo he was ordered to the colours late in the day,\r\nbecause both the ensigns and all the colour-sergeants had been hit.\r\n“Though used to warfare as any one, this was a job I did not like.\r\nThere had been before me that day _fourteen_ sergeants already killed\r\nor wounded around them, and both staff and colours were almost cut to\r\npieces.”[314] This was, of course, very exceptional carnage; but the\r\nposts of junior ensign and colour-sergeant were always exceptionally\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE COMMISSARIAT\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have already had occasion to remark, when dealing with the central\r\norganization of the Peninsular Army, of all the departments which had\r\ntheir representatives at Head Quarters that which was under the charge\r\nof the Commissary-General was the most important.[315] It is not too\r\nmuch to say that, when the long struggle began, the whole future of\r\nthe war depended on whether the hastily organized and inexperienced\r\nCommissariat Department could enable Wellington to keep his army\r\nconcentrated, and to move it freely in any direction.\r\n\r\nSpain and Portugal are countries where large armies cannot be supplied\r\nfrom local resources, except in a few favoured districts. Any attempt\r\nto live on requisitions was bound to fail in the end, as the French\r\nrealized to their sorrow, after a long series of endeavours to subsist\r\non the countryside in the Peninsula, as they were wont to do in Italy\r\nor Germany. Wellington from the first forbade it, and resolved that\r\nthe main dependence of the troops must be on regular stores brought\r\nup from the base of operations. Requisitions were only a subsidiary\r\nresource; they could only be made by an authorized commissary, and\r\nmust be paid for at once. It was his misfortune that specie was often\r\nnot forthcoming, and the payments had to be made by Treasury orders\r\nor other paper, which the peasants who received them found hard to\r\nnegotiate. But payment in some form was always made.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: All-Importance of Convoys]\r\n\r\nAt the best, requisitions were only a secondary aid, and the army\r\nrelied for the staple of its provisions on the stores which the\r\nCommissary-General had to bring up from Lisbon or other bases. This\r\nwas a hard task for him, when it is remembered that the cross roads of\r\nthe Peninsula were mule-tracks, on which heavy wheeled traffic could\r\nnot pass; and that the army was often operating at a distance of 150\r\nor 200 miles from its depôts. Moreover, in 1809, the staff of the\r\nCommissariat had all their work to learn—no British army for many years\r\nhad been operating in heavy force, and for many months on end, in a\r\nthinly-peopled continental theatre of war. The difficulty of bringing\r\nup the daily food of the troops seemed at first almost insuperable.\r\nAt the end of the Talavera campaign the men were well-nigh famished,\r\nsimply because the attempt had been made to depend more than was\r\npossible on local resources, to the neglect of convoys from the base.\r\nAfter this experience Wellington resolved that he must live on his own\r\nstores, and this principle was remembered throughout the war. Hence\r\nthe work which fell on the commissariat, in collecting and forwarding\r\nfood from the base, was appalling. Most of it had to be conveyed by\r\nbrigades of pack-mules with native drivers, who were hard to manage\r\nand prone to desert. The rest came up on country carts—ox-waggons for\r\nthe most part. That mistakes and delays occurred, that a brigade or a\r\ndivision was occasionally foodless for several days, and forced to halt\r\nin the middle of a critical operation, is not wonderful. But on the\r\nwhole after much toil and trouble the Commissariat succeeded in doing\r\nits duty, and the length of time for which the British army could keep\r\nconcentrated was the envy of the French, who, living on the country,\r\nwere forced to disperse whenever they had exhausted the resources of\r\nthe particular region in which they were massed.\r\n\r\nAll through the years 1811–12 the central fact in the Peninsula was\r\nthat if the French armies of Portugal and the North concentrated at\r\nSalamanca and Rodrigo, or if (on the other hand) those of Portugal and\r\nAndalusia joined on the Guadiana, in the region of Badajoz and Merida,\r\nthe Anglo-Portuguese were too weak to face the combination. Wellington\r\nhad to abandon the offensive, and to seek refuge behind the Portuguese\r\nfrontier. But when he did so, as in June, 1811, and again in September\r\nof the same year, he knew that the overwhelming force in front of him\r\ncould not hold itself together for more than a very short period of\r\ndays. Troops brought from enormous distances, and destitute of any\r\nadequate magazines or transport, could not live on the countryside for\r\nmore than a limited period. They were forced to disperse, in order to\r\nfeed, and so the threatening conjunction passed, and, when the enemy\r\nhad drawn apart, the allied army could once more abandon the defensive,\r\nand take some positive project in hand. The same was the case in\r\nthe late autumn of 1812, during the retreat from Burgos. Wellington\r\non this occasion had on his hands the largest combination of French\r\ntroops that he ever faced—the four armies of Portugal, the North, the\r\nCentre, and Andalusia were all pressing in upon him. It would have\r\nbeen hopeless to fight, and so retreat was persevered in, so long as\r\nthe enemy continued to advance. But Wellington knew that the progress\r\nof the 100,000 men now pursuing him must inevitably come to an end,\r\nfor in their rapid course they could bring no stores with them, and in\r\nthe war-worn country between Salamanca and Rodrigo they could obtain\r\nnothing. Where his own troops, though returning toward their base\r\nand their depôts, were hard put to it for food, the French must be\r\nsuffering even more. Wherefore he retreated, waiting for the inevitable\r\nmoment when the pursuit could be no longer urged. It mattered little\r\nwhether it stopped at Salamanca, or a march or so beyond (as actually\r\nhappened), or whether it might get a little further, as far as the\r\nPortuguese frontier. It was certain, within a period of days, that it\r\nmust break down. Meanwhile he himself was retreating on to his stores,\r\nand could depend upon them: after Rodrigo the men were getting their\r\nfull rations once more.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the Commissariat may be divided into three sections—the\r\nfirst was the accumulation of great masses of sea-borne stores at the\r\nregular bases, the second was the distribution of those stores to the\r\ntroops at the front by an immense system of convoys; the third and\r\nsubsidiary task was the supplementing of these base-stores, by getting\r\nin what could be procured in the countryside, where the army was\r\noperating; for, of course, every _fanega_ or _arroba_ of food-stuff\r\nthat could be obtained at the front was helpful. It had not to be\r\ncarried far, it saved convoy work, and it kept the magazines at the\r\nbase from depletion. Yet, as has been already remarked, what was got\r\nin the countryside was always considered as the secondary source of\r\nsupply; the main reliance was on the food-ships, which poured into the\r\nbase-depôt of Lisbon corn sought in the ends of the earth, not only in\r\nsuch limited parts of Europe as could be drawn upon in the days of the\r\nContinental System, but in Morocco, Turkey in Asia, and America.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of the Peninsular War entirely depended on the naval\r\npredominance of Great Britain in all seas; if the army of Wellington\r\nhad not been able to draw freely on distant resources, his position\r\nwould have been little better than that of his French enemies. Hence\r\nit was that, in one sense, the greatest danger that he ever incurred\r\nwas the American War of 1812–14, which turned loose upon his line\r\nof communications, in the North Atlantic, many scores of active and\r\nenterprising privateers, who did considerable damage among British\r\nshipping, and for the first time since the war began made the high\r\nseas insecure. But fortunately the commencement of the American War\r\nexactly synchronized with the beginnings of Napoleon’s downfall, and\r\nthe struggle in Europe took a favourable turn just as the peril on the\r\nocean came into being. If the American War had broken out in 1809 or\r\n1810, its significance would have been of much higher importance.\r\n\r\nThe normal condition of commissariat affairs, during the first four\r\nyears of the war, was that there were daily arriving in Lisbon supplies\r\nof all sorts, not only food but clothing, munitions, and weapons of\r\nwar, which had to be got forward to the army as quickly as possible.\r\nIn the winter of 1810–11, when the whole of Wellington’s host lay\r\nconcentrated behind (or later in advance of) the Lines of Torres\r\nVedras, the problem was comparatively simple, as the troops were close\r\nto the magazines. But during the remainder of the years 1811–12 the\r\nBritish divisions were lying out at a long distance from their base—by\r\nGuarda, Celorico, or Almeida, or at other times near Merida, Campo\r\nMayor, and Portalegre. In 1812, when Wellington moved forward as far as\r\nMadrid and Burgos, the _étapes_ between the base-depôt and the field\r\narmy were even greater.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Water Transport]\r\n\r\nThe Commissary-General’s duty was to see that convoys went regularly\r\nto the front, so that the army should never be in want. This was a\r\nhard business, since most of the transfer had to be made on mule-back,\r\nand the rest on ox-carts of primitive construction and small capacity.\r\nWater-carriage, which would have been comparatively easy, could only\r\nbe utilized on a limited scale; the Tagus was generally navigable\r\nto Abrantes, and when the main army lay in Estremadura this was a\r\ngreat help, since stores could be sent up in barges and country boats\r\nwith much greater ease than by road. When unloaded at Abrantes, they\r\nhad a comparatively short way to travel by mule or ox-cart to Elvas\r\nor Portalegre. But usually only Hill’s two divisions were on the\r\nEstremadura frontier, and Wellington with the main force was somewhere\r\non the Beira frontier, in the direction of Guarda, Sabugal, and the\r\nCoa. These regions are 150 miles or more from Lisbon, and the roads\r\nbeyond Coimbra on the one side and Abrantes on the other were rugged\r\nand badly kept. It was a trying business to secure the constant and\r\nregular forwarding of the necessary convoys, and the return of beasts\r\nand men to the base, when they had discharged their loads at the\r\nfront. A very slight assistance was got by using the river Douro as a\r\nsecondary line of water carriage—but it was only navigable to Peso da\r\nRegoa near Lamego, which was so far from the Spanish frontier and the\r\nnormal haunts of the army, that little was gained by sending stores to\r\nOporto as a secondary base-depôt. In 1811 the only large consignments\r\nforwarded on that line were the heavy guns and ammunition, which\r\nwere to form the siege-train that Dickson was organizing at Villa da\r\nPonte,[316] which is comparatively close to Lamego, though the roads\r\nbetween them were very bad. In 1812 Wellington’s engineers, by patient\r\nblasting and dredging in the bed of the Douro, made it navigable as far\r\nas Castro de Alva, which is forty miles up-stream from Peso da Regoa,\r\nand lies not very remote from Almeida. After this the Douro became\r\nmuch more useful as a line of supply, and it was largely used for the\r\nforwarding of stores before the opening of the campaign of 1813. But,\r\njust as it had become available on a better scale, Wellington started\r\nthe great march to Vittoria, whose success took him away for ever\r\nfrom Portugal. During the last year of the war he suddenly shifted\r\nhis base, and made Santander and Passages his base-ports, so that the\r\nimprovements in the navigation of the Douro were of no further utility.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mule-Train]\r\n\r\nA great part of the Commissary-General’s staff was kept at Lisbon,\r\nwith a smaller sub-department at Oporto, receiving from the ships,\r\nunloading, and repacking the immense stores that came to hand.\r\nEvery few days a convoy started for the front, under the charge of\r\na deputy-assistant-commissary, a commissariat-clerk, or some such\r\nsubordinate. It would usually consist of a large drove of hired\r\nmules, worked by their owners, who generally acted together in gangs\r\nor parties, of which a _capataz_ or head-driver, chosen by his\r\ncomrades, was the chief, and did the bargaining with the commissariat\r\nauthorities. The convoy would probably consist of the gangs of five\r\nor six _capatazes_, and would number many scores of beasts. The\r\ncommissariat official in charge had no easy task to make the muleteers\r\nget over a reasonable daily stretch of road, and to see that they did\r\nnot steal from the stores, or (what was not unknown when there was a\r\nquarrel) desert with their beasts. When the convoy got near the front,\r\nit would have to be provided with an escort—generally convalescents\r\nreturning to their battalions, or drafts newly arrived from England.\r\nBut the escorts were not an unmixed blessing—they were terribly prone\r\nto picking and stealing from the stores, with or without the connivance\r\nof the muleteers. There was nearly always trouble when a small escort,\r\nwithout an officer to keep his men in hand, got associated with a mule\r\ntrain. Brawls were frequent between soldiers and muleteers, and the\r\nassistant-commissary in charge could not get the escort to obey him:\r\nsergeants looked upon him as a mere civilian in a cocked hat, who\r\nmight be contemned. Nor was the task of such an unfortunate official\r\nrendered more easy by the fact that, owing to sheer want of hard cash,\r\nhis muleteers were usually in long arrears of their stipulated hire.\r\nThey naturally grumbled, but on the whole stuck to their service far\r\nmore faithfully than might have been expected; there were times when\r\nthe whole body of them were many months unpaid, yet only a small\r\nproportion disappeared. Probably the fact that they escaped the\r\nconscription by being registered as authorized followers of the British\r\nArmy had something to do with their long-suffering: probably also real\r\npatriotism had some share, for they all loyally hated the French, and\r\nwere prone to cut the throats of their wounded, if left unshepherded\r\nnear a recent battlefield.\r\n\r\nWheeled transport was much less satisfactory than the mule trains for\r\ncontinuous movement. The British waggons sent out to the Peninsula\r\nturned out to be quite useless for Portuguese by-roads. Wellington\r\nfinally gave up all idea of relying on them for load-carrying, and\r\nmainly employed them for his sick and wounded. A few of the “spring\r\nwaggons” (as they were called to distinguish them from the springless\r\nPortuguese vehicles)[317] were attached to each brigade for the\r\ncarriage of invalids, and the “Royal Waggon Train” in the later years\r\nof the war seem to have been almost treated as an ambulance corps.\r\nCertainly the army would have been in evil case, if it had been forced\r\nto rely on them for the moving of its food.\r\n\r\nSuch stores as did move upon wheels, and not upon mule-back, were\r\ncarried on Portuguese ox-waggons, to which Wellington was compelled to\r\nhave recourse for want of better vehicles. These were very primitive\r\nstructures—the sides of wicker work, the wheels made of solid circles\r\nof wood bounded with iron, turning axle and all, which made their\r\ngrinding noise almost intolerable. The excruciating thrills caused to\r\nthe ear by a train of such carts are mentioned with disgust by nearly\r\nevery Peninsular diarist, on his first introduction to life at the\r\nfront. The only advantages of ox-waggons were that they were light,\r\neasy to repair, and specially built for the bad roads of the country:\r\nmoreover, every peasant knew how to drive them, or to mend them at a\r\npinch. Their weak points were that they were intolerably slow—two miles\r\nan hour was a full allowance—and that they were too small to carry\r\nmuch. However, they had to serve for want of better vehicles—and the\r\narmy could not have lived without their service. An immense amount of\r\nthem were employed, some on regular and long terms of hire, as part of\r\nthe permanent transport of the army, others in a more temporary way,\r\nby requisition from the district. These last were always difficult\r\nto manage; professional muleteers would not object to travel, but\r\nimpressed peasants loathed quitting their own district, fearing that\r\nthey might be taken far afield—perhaps into Spain—before they were\r\nreleased. They were always trying to abscond with their precious\r\nbullocks, abandoning the comparatively worthless cart and its stores.\r\nA picture of the sort may be taken from Hennegan’s lively narrative of\r\na march in 1809, when he had to take an unwilling train of “embargoed”\r\nwaggoners across the mountains of Northern Beira.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Desertion of Drivers]\r\n\r\n“Leaning on their oxen at nightfall, they contemplated in mute dismay\r\non one side the gigantic hill which they had just descended, on the\r\nother the roaring torrent of the Douro, which in its impetuous course\r\nseemed to threaten with destruction the temerity that would brave its\r\npower. The _Santa Marias_ of some were answered by the more emphatic\r\n_carajos!_ of others, but even these died away before the necessities\r\nof the moment, and unyoking the oxen, to afford them the shelter of\r\ntrees, the drivers spread their large cloaks in the empty sheds, and\r\nsoon in sleep seemed to forget their disappointment. The poor men,\r\ntaken from their homes for our service, risked in the loss of their\r\noxen the only means of support for themselves and families.\r\n\r\n“The following morning, however, presented a curious scene. There stood\r\nthe wains, securely packed, but looking as if the earth had brought\r\nthem forth, for no vestige remained of the means by which they had been\r\nbrought to this lonely spot. The rumour of the proximity of the French\r\nhad determined these Portuguese on sacrificing the wains, if only they\r\ncould ensure the preservation of themselves and oxen. What was now to\r\nbe done?”[318]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the non-plussed guardian of the deserted convoy\r\nhad to remain motionless for many days, risking the possible arrival of\r\nthe French, till at last he procured boats on the Douro, and shipped\r\nhis charge down to Oporto. Hennegan’s peasants got away with their\r\nbullocks—he and his escort were evidently sleepy and unsuspecting: but\r\noften a good watch was kept on the teams, and sentries placed over\r\nthem. In such cases, if the weather was bad, or the French too near,\r\nthe drivers would often sacrifice even their loved beasts, and simply\r\nabscond themselves, abandoning their means of livelihood.\r\n\r\nIt says much for the general zeal of the Commissariat Department\r\nthat, even with such difficulties about them, they usually succeeded\r\nin keeping the army supplied with food. Occasionally there were\r\ndesperate pinches of starvation, when the army had out-marched its\r\nconvoys—this, for example, happened on the Alva in March, 1811, when\r\nhalf of the army, in pursuit of Masséna, had to stop dead for several\r\ndays, because their rapid advance had left the slow-moving mule-trains\r\nseveral marches behind. To press the French would have been most\r\nprofitable—but if the troops had gone on, through the depopulated\r\nland before them, they must have perished of sheer want of food, and\r\nWellington reluctantly halted till the convoys began to creep up\r\nto the front. Another period of empty stomachs was seen during the\r\nretreat from Burgos, from the opposite cause; forced to give back,\r\nWellington started his train betimes for Ciudad Rodrigo, to get it out\r\nof the proximity of the oncoming enemy. Hence the rear divisions, who\r\nhad to contain the pursuers and to move slowly, found, when they had\r\neaten what was in their haversacks, that the convoys were all several\r\nmarches ahead of them. They suffered terribly, and existed for two days\r\nmainly on acorns gleaned from the oak forests through which they were\r\nmarching. But mischances of this kind were hardly to be considered the\r\nfault of the Commissariat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Resources of the Country]\r\n\r\nAs I have already had to remark, the duty of the officers of this\r\ndepartment did not merely consist in bringing up and distributing\r\nfood forwarded from the base depôts. They had also, as a subsidiary\r\nresource, to get what they could out of the countryside. A good\r\nassistant-commissary was always casting about, through the villages on\r\neither side of the route of the brigade to which he was attached, to\r\nfind cattle and corn that could be bought. He was forced to pay for\r\nthem, since Wellington strictly forbade requisition without value\r\ngiven. When the commissary had dollars the matter was not so difficult,\r\nfor the peasants were generally ready to sell. But when, as often\r\nhappened, the military chest was empty, and payment could only be made\r\nin _vales_—paper promises to pay—the inhabitants soon got wind of the\r\nfact, hid their corn, and drove their oxen up into the hills. The good\r\ncommissary was the man, who, under such circumstances could discover\r\nand get possession of the concealed resources of the land. But even if\r\nthere was money in hand, a good deal of tact was required in dealing\r\nwith the natives, and it was not every one who would make the most of\r\nhis store of cash or paper for the benefit of his brigade. How the\r\ningenious man worked may be gathered from a note of Commissary Dallas,\r\ndealing with a march through Northern Andalusia in 1812.[319]\r\n\r\n“Having made careful inquiries as to the properties and farms which lay\r\nat some distance to right or left of the road, our plan was to seek\r\nthem, not saying a word of our object, but simply asking hospitality. I\r\ndo not remember that this was ever refused, though sometimes we failed\r\nto gain anything. We usually began with talking of the horrors of the\r\nFrench, of which Andres had many terrible chapters to relate. This led\r\nto expressions of grief as to the ravages that the enemy had made: by\r\ndegrees we introduced a word of rejoicing that some people had so well\r\nknown how to hide their property from such rapacious robbers. It often\r\nhappened that at the word _esconder_, to hide, there were indications\r\non the countenances of some of the party which led to further\r\ninquiries. On many occasions we drew out hints from various members of\r\nthe community which enabled us to jump to conclusions, which surprised\r\nother members, as to the concealment of stores of wheat, barley, Indian\r\ncorn, etc. The difficulty was to obtain access to the supplies, when we\r\nhad become aware of their existence; but I had power to give a good\r\nprice, and was armed with plenary authority of Spanish officials to say\r\nthat my drafts would be honoured in due course.\r\n\r\n“An incident or two will illustrate the manner in which we got\r\nsupplies. At one distant solitary house of poor appearance Andres\r\ndiscovered that, while everything looked poverty-stricken about the\r\nplace, there was somewhere in a thick wood a barn which contained\r\nconcealed stores. I told the mistress of the house of the very high\r\nprice that I would give for wheat, Indian corn, or forage. In the grey\r\nOctober dawn I was awoke by her husband, who told me he could supply\r\nwhat I wanted, if I would give a certain price, which he named. I said\r\nthat I must see the supplies before I gave money. He bade me rise, and\r\nhe would show me. He led me two miles to a thick wood, in which was a\r\ndeep ravine; here he brought me safely to a receptacle of much hidden\r\nstore, which I took at his own price, and gave him the proper document.\r\nIn one part of the Sierra Morena we heard of a considerable flock of\r\nsheep secreted in the depth of a forest. I obtained the permission of\r\nthe owner to possess them for a certain price _if I could get them_,\r\nfor he himself could not point out the spot where they were to be\r\nfound. After gathering what information I could, I set forth in the\r\nhope of finding them, and did so by following a track of sheep till I\r\narrived in the middle of the flock. I told the two shepherds that I had\r\npurchased them—they were doubtful and one very refractory. But at last\r\none of them drove the sheep to the open plain outside the forest, and\r\nthen disappeared among the trees with his dog, leaving me to drive the\r\nflock as I could. It was no easy task—but I got them into an enclosure\r\na considerable way off.”[320]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Unpopular Commissary]\r\n\r\nIf these were the experiences of a Commissariat official who had been\r\nthree years in Spain, and knew the language well, it is easy to guess\r\nhow inefficient a newly landed clerk or assistant must have been,\r\nwhen he was sent to sweep the countryside for what he could discover.\r\nIt was a thankless task—often the seeker came back empty, to be\r\nfrowned upon by his departmental chief and the brigadier. When he did\r\ndiscover food, it was taken for granted, and he was little thanked.\r\nThe fighting men seem to have had a general prejudice against their\r\nproviders—they were accused of being timid, arrogant, and selfish,\r\nand the embezzlements of certain black sheep were made to cover a\r\ngeneral charge of dishonesty against the whole tribe, which was\r\nfar from being justified. Misfeasance there certainly was, when an\r\nunscrupulous commissary credited a peasant with more _fanegas_ than he\r\nhad received, and divided the balance of cash with the seller. But on\r\nthe whole the work was well done, despite of the many complaints of the\r\nmilitary—from Wellington himself downwards. That the Peninsular War was\r\nsuccessfully maintained in 1810–11–12 was surely, at bottom, the work\r\nof the much-maligned commissaries, and the motley band of ill-paid and\r\nsometimes ruffianly muleteers and waggoners, who, through a thousand\r\ndifficulties,[321] generally got the biscuit and the rum-barrels, the\r\ndroves of bullocks, and the packs of clothing and shoes, to their\r\nappointed destination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nA NOTE ON THINGS SPIRITUAL\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter of this volume I had occasion to remark that\r\nWellington’s army had in its ranks a considerable sprinkling of men\r\nof religion, and that three or four of the better Peninsular memoirs\r\nwere written by them. Some were Methodists, some Churchmen, so that\r\nboth sides of the great spiritual movement which had started about the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century were represented in their diaries. The\r\nspiritual side of the soldier’s life during the great war has had so\r\nlittle written about it, that a few illustrative pages on this topic\r\nmust not be omitted.\r\n\r\nWe may trace the existence of the admirable class of men who have\r\nleft us these memoirs to two separate causes. The one, of course, was\r\nthe way in which the movement started by the Wesleys had influenced\r\nall ranks of life, from the lowest upward. Its effects had not\r\nbeen confined to avowed Methodists, but had led to the rise of the\r\nEvangelical party within the Church of England, which was developing\r\nvery rapidly all through the days of the Great War. But I think that\r\neven if the Wesleys had never lived, there would yet have been a\r\nstrong reaction in favour of godly living and the open profession of\r\nChristianity, in consequence of the blasphemous antics of the French\r\nRevolution. Nothing in that movement so disgusted Englishmen (even\r\nthose of them who were not much given to practical religion) as the\r\nstory of the “Goddess of Reason,” enthroned on the high-altar of\r\nNotre Dame, at the time when an orgy of bloodshed was making odious\r\nthe flatulent talk about humanitarianism and liberty which was the\r\nstaple of Revolutionary oratory. The peculiar combination of insult\r\nto Christianity, open evil living, and wholesale judicial murder,\r\nwhich distinguished the time of the Terror, had an effect on observers\r\ncomparable to nothing else that has been seen in modern times. Even\r\nmen who had not hitherto taken their religion very seriously, began to\r\nthink that a hell was logically necessary in the scheme of creation\r\nfor beings like Chaumette or Hébert, Fouquier Tinville or Carrier of\r\nthe _Noyades_. And, we may add, a personal devil was surely required,\r\nto account for the promptings of insane wickedness which led to the\r\nactions of such people. A tightening up of religious observances, such\r\nas the use of family prayer and regular attendance at Church, was a\r\nmarked feature of the time. It required some time for the movement to\r\nspread, but its effect was soon observable. It naturally took shape\r\nin adhesion to Evangelical societies within the Church of England, or\r\nMethodist societies without it; since these were the already existing\r\nnuclei round which those whose souls had been stirred by the horrors in\r\nFrance and the imminent peril of Great Britain would group themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effects of the French Revolution]\r\n\r\nVery soon the day was over in which “enthusiasm” was the dread of all\r\nnormal easy-going men. Something more than the eighteenth century\r\nreligious sentimentalism, and vague spiritual philosophy, was needed\r\nfor a nation which had to fight for life and empire against the French\r\nRepublic and all its works. Those methods of thought were sufficiently\r\ndiscredited by the fact that there was a touch of Rousseau in them:\r\nit was easy to look over the Channel, and see to what a belief in\r\nsome nebulous Supreme Being, and in the perfectibility and essential\r\nrighteousness of mankind at large, might lead. The God of the Old\r\nTestament was a much more satisfactory object of worship to the men\r\nwho had to face the Jacobin, and Calvinism has always proved a good\r\nfighting creed. If ever there was a justification for a belief that\r\nthe enemy were in a condition of complete reprobation, and that to\r\nsmite them was the duty of every Christian man, it was surely at\r\nthis time. The conviction of the universality of sin and the natural\r\nwickedness of the human heart was the exact opposite and antidote\r\nto the optimistic philosophy of the eighteenth century, and to its\r\nbelief that man is essentially a benevolent being, and that if he\r\nsometimes breaks out into deplorable violence “_tout comprendre est\r\ntout pardonner_.” As a working hypothesis for an enemy of the French\r\nRevolution the Calvinistic theory had everything in its favour.\r\n\r\nThe army, like English society in general, contained an appreciable\r\nproportion of those whom the stress and terror of the times had made\r\nanxious about their souls. Some took their religious experience\r\nquietly, and found sufficient edification in accepted forms. Many,\r\nhowever, filled with a fervent belief in original sin and in the\r\nblackness of their own hearts, only got comfort by “conversion” in\r\nthe prevalent form of the day, and in subsequent reliance on complete\r\nJustification by Faith.\r\n\r\n“Conversion” was frequently a matter of dire spiritual agony and\r\nwrestling, often accompanied by fits of horrible depression, which\r\nwere generally fought down, but sometimes ended in religious mania.\r\nSergeant Donaldson of the 94th, whom I have often had to quote in other\r\nchapters, tells a terrible tale from his own regiment of a man whose\r\nweak point had been a violent temper, and a tendency to use his fists.\r\nBeing under strong religious emotion, and having determined never again\r\nto offend in this way, he had the misfortune to break out once more\r\nin unjustifiable blows, administered to his peasant landlord in the\r\nvillage of Ustaritz. Ashamed of his backsliding he fell into a fit of\r\ndespair, and brooding over the text “if thy right hand offend thee, cut\r\nit off,” he resolved that this was the only cure for his irascibility.\r\nWhereupon he went, and without any display of emotion or eccentricity,\r\nvery quietly borrowed a felling-axe from one of the regimental\r\npioneers, placed his right hand upon a window-sill, and cut it off with\r\na single blow delivered very dexterously with his left. He then went\r\nand reported his act and its reason to the regimental surgeon, with\r\ngreat calmness and lucidity.[322]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Agonies of Conversion]\r\n\r\nSuch incidents as this were rare among those who were undergoing the\r\nprocess of Conversion, but it was generally accompanied by long spasms\r\nof conviction of sin, when, as one memoir-writer records, “all the\r\ncrimes of his life passed before him in black array, when he felt\r\nthat if he could but bury himself in a cave or den of the earth, and\r\nforego all intercourse with mankind, it would be to purchase pardon\r\nand peace easily and cheaply.... Life was but the dreadful expectation\r\nof that fatal hour when the fiend would be commissioned to seize and\r\ncarry off the guilty soul to its abode of everlasting misery.”[323]\r\nAnother diarist records that, as he went down toward the great breach\r\nof Badajoz, he was repeating to himself very forcibly, “You will be in\r\nhell before daylight” all the time, till he received a disabling wound.\r\nThis rifleman, when he experienced conversion, received therewith an\r\nunexpected gift of metrical exposition. His autobiography is curiously\r\nsprinkled with his impromptu verses such as—\r\n\r\n       “Then why let our minds be encumbered\r\n        ’Bout what such poor worms may befall,\r\n        When the hairs of our head are all numbered\r\n        By Him who reigns King over all?”\r\n\r\nAnd again—\r\n\r\n       “I shall go where duty calls me,\r\n        Patient bearing what befalls me,\r\n        Jesus Christ will bring me through!\r\n        Bullets, cannon balls or death\r\n        Cannot hurt ‘the better part,’\r\n        So I’ll list to what He saith\r\n        Till He bids me home depart.”[324]\r\n\r\nThis ecstatic confidence of the converted man is very clearly expressed\r\nin many a little book. A Guards’ sergeant, whose memoirs I have had\r\noccasion to quote in earlier chapters, mentions that, all through the\r\nhard experience of his brigade at Talavera, he was comforted by the\r\nthought that, however disastrous the day was looking, “the Lord can\r\nsave us now.”\r\n\r\n“Standing between the enemy and my own men, with the shot ploughing up\r\nthe ground all about me, the Lord kept me from all fear, and I got back\r\nto my place in the line without injury and without agitation. Indeed,\r\nwho should be so firm as the Christian soldier, who has the assurance\r\nin his breast that to depart and to be with Christ is far better than\r\nto continue toiling here below?”[325] On another occasion this diarist,\r\nin a long waiting spell before a dangerous disembarkation, found\r\nWesley’s two hundred and twenty-seventh hymn running in his mind all\r\nthe morning, to the inexpressible comfort of his soul during an anxious\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThis kind of comfortable ecstasy did not by any means preclude a ready\r\nand competent employment of musket and bayonet. One or two of the\r\nnotable personal exploits of the Peninsular War were done by “saints.”\r\nThere is a special mention in several diaries, regimental and general,\r\nof John Rae, of the 71st, a well-known Methodist, who at the combat of\r\nSobral (October 14, 1810), being the last man of the skirmishers of his\r\nbattalion to retire, was beset by three French _tirailleurs_, on whom\r\nhe turned, and shot one and bayoneted the other two in the twinkling of\r\nan eye. He received a medal for his conduct from his brigadier, who had\r\nbeen an eye-witness of the affair.[326]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wellington’s Views on Religion]\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Wellington toward religion at large, and religious\r\nsoldiers in particular, was very much what one might have expected\r\nfrom his peculiar blend of personal characteristics. He was a sincere\r\nbeliever in Christianity as presented by the Church of England, but he\r\nhad not been in the least affected by recent evangelical developments,\r\nand his belief was of a rather dry and official sort; an officer who\r\ntook to public preaching and the forming of religious societies was\r\nonly two or three degrees less distasteful to him than an officer who\r\nwas foul-mouthed in his language and openly contemned holy things.\r\nI fancy that the Duke would have been inclined to regard both as\r\n“ungentlemanly.” Religion with him was the due recognition of the fact\r\nthat man has a Creator, who has imposed upon him a code of laws and a\r\nsystem of morality which it is man’s duty to remember, and so far as he\r\nmay, to observe. He was quite ready to acknowledge that he had his own\r\nfailings, but trusted that they were not unpardonable ones. The two or\r\nthree Evangelical enthusiasts who had the courage to tackle him in his\r\nlater days on the subject of his soul, got small profit thereby.[327]\r\n\r\nIt is highly to his credit that he made from 1810 onward a serious\r\nattempt to organize a system of brigade chaplaincies for his army, and\r\nto see that the men should not lack the possibility of public worship.\r\nDown to that year the chaplains’ department had been much neglected:\r\nlarge expeditions had gone out without a single clergyman attached, and\r\nin the first Peninsular Army of 1808 there had been very few—though\r\ntwo of them, Ormsby and Bradford, happen to have left interesting\r\nbooks behind them, the latter’s beautifully illustrated by sketches.\r\nWellington complained that the provision that he found in 1809 was\r\nwholly inadequate, asked for and obtained an additional establishment,\r\nand made arrangements for regular Sunday services in each brigade.\r\n\r\nThe letter of February 6, 1811, in which he explains his views to\r\nthe Adjutant General at the Horse Guards is a very characteristic\r\ndocument. “The army should have the advantage of religious instruction,\r\nfrom a knowledge that it is the greatest support and aid to military\r\ndiscipline and order.” But there are not enough chaplains, and those\r\nthat exist are not always “respectable.” The prospects of a military\r\nchaplain are not attractive enough; on retirement he is much worse\r\noff than he would have been “if he had followed any other line of the\r\nclerical profession besides the army.” Hence few good men are obtained.\r\nFor want of sufficiently numerous and influential official teachers,\r\nspontaneous religious life has broken out in the army. There are three\r\nMethodist meetings in the 1st Division alone. In the 9th regiment two\r\nofficers are preaching, in despite of their colonels’ dissuasions.\r\n\r\n“The meeting of soldiers in their cantonments to sing psalms, or to\r\nhear a sermon read by one of their comrades is, in the abstract,\r\nperfectly innocent; it is a better way of spending their time than many\r\nothers to which they are addicted. But it may become otherwise, and\r\nyet, till the abuse has made some progress, their commanding officer\r\nwould have no knowledge of it, nor could he interfere.”\r\n\r\nOfficial religious instruction is the proper remedy. A “respectable\r\nclergyman” is wanted, who “by his personal influence and advice, and\r\nby that of true religion, would moderate the zeal and enthusiasm of\r\nthose people, and prevent meetings from becoming mischievous, even if\r\nhe could not prevail upon them to discontinue them entirely.” Wherefore\r\nthe Adjutant General must provide for a larger establishment of\r\n“respectable and efficient clergymen.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chaplains]\r\n\r\nThe Horse Guards complied at once: chaplains, it was replied, should be\r\nsent out “selected with the utmost care and circumspection by the first\r\nprelates of the country.” Their pay was raised, and they were directed\r\nto conclude every service with a short practical sermon, suited to\r\nthe habits and understanding of soldiers. “Good preaching,” adds the\r\nAdjutant General, “is more than ever required at a time peculiarly\r\nmarked by the exertions and interference of sectaries of various\r\ndenominations.”[328]\r\n\r\nThe chaplains duly appeared. There were good men among them, but\r\nthey were not, taken as a whole, a complete success. Perhaps the\r\nidea, equally nourished by Wellington and by the Horse Guards, that\r\n“respectable” clergymen rather than enthusiasts should be drafted out,\r\nwas the cardinal mistake; the sort of men that were really wanted\r\nat the front were precisely the enthusiasts, like that Rev. T. Owen\r\n(afterwards secretary of the British and Foreign Bible Society), of\r\nwhom we are told that he was in days of action so far forward in the\r\nfield that officers warned him that he would infallibly be killed. His\r\nreply was that his primary duty was “to be of service to those now\r\ndeparting this life.”[329] This sort of laudable energy, I am bound to\r\nsay, does not seem to have been the most common characteristic of the\r\nchaplains, if we may trust the diaries of the time.\r\n\r\nA good many of them were sent straight out from a country curacy to the\r\nfront, had no special knowledge of soldiers and their ways, and were\r\nappalled at having to face the great facts of life and death in their\r\ncrudest form day after day. There is one distressing picture of a young\r\nclergyman suddenly confronted in the guard-tent with five deserters\r\nwho were to be shot that afternoon. They were all criminals who had\r\nbeen actually taken in the French ranks, fighting against their old\r\ncomrades, at the storm of Ciudad Rodrigo. The chaplain helplessly read\r\nprayers at them, felt that he could do no more with callous ruffians\r\nwho had met the death-sentence with an oath, and followed them to the\r\nexecution-place looking very uncomfortable, quite useless, and much\r\nashamed of himself.\r\n\r\nIt was almost as trying, if not so horrible, to be tackled by a\r\nCalvinist in the throes of conversion, who gave glowing pictures of\r\nhell-fire, and asked for the means of avoiding it, refusing to take as\r\nan answer any dole of chapters from the New Testament or petitions from\r\nthe Prayer Book. Here is a picture of the situation from the point of\r\nview of the penitent, Quartermaster Surtees, whom I have already had\r\noccasion to quote.\r\n\r\n“From the clergyman, though a kind and sympathizing man, I, alas!\r\nderived but little benefit. He did not direct me to the only source of\r\na sin-sick being’s hopes—the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of\r\nthe world. He tried to make my hopes centre more on good resolutions,\r\nand after-doings. How thankfully would I have accepted the true method\r\nof salvation pointed out in the gospel; but already I was but too much\r\n(as the natural man always is) inclined to expect pardon from the\r\nacts of penitence which, if God spared me, I intended to perform. The\r\nkind gentleman wrote me out prayers, and seemed much interested in my\r\nwelfare. But reading and praying seemed more like an irksome task than\r\nan exercise which brought spiritual profit.... Indeed the Scriptures\r\nwere still at this time a ‘sealed book’ to me; until the grace of God\r\nhas dispelled our darkness there is no light in anything.”[330]\r\n\r\nClearly the Quartermaster had come upon one of those sensible and\r\ncommonplace clergy whom Wellington had requisitioned from the\r\nChaplain-general’s department, when he wanted an Evangelist who would\r\nhave preached to him Justification by Faith in its simplest form.\r\n\r\nThere are a good many humorous anecdotes concerning the race of\r\nChaplains preserved in the Peninsular diaries, not for the most part\r\nimputing to them any serious moral failing—though several are accused\r\nof having become “Belemites,”[331] and of shirking the front—but\r\ntending to prove that they often failed to rise to the occasion in\r\ntheir difficult calling. This was indeed to be expected when most of\r\nthem had not the least knowledge of military life and customs, and\r\nwere wandering about for many months in a world quite new to them.\r\nClearly only men of experience should have been sent—but (as Wellington\r\nremarks in one of his letters) the pay offered was so small that\r\nonly enthusiasts or very poor men could be expected to take it—and\r\nenthusiasts, for other reasons, the commander-in-chief did not like.\r\nThe soldier seems often to have been struck by the helplessness of the\r\nchaplain—he let himself be robbed by his servants, wandered outside the\r\npicquets and got captured by the French, or was deceived by obvious\r\nhypocrites. There is one ridiculous story of a young clergyman who,\r\nwhen first brought forward to take a brigade Sunday service, and placed\r\nbehind the big-drum, which was to serve him as a sort of central mark,\r\nmistook its function for that of a pulpit, and endeavoured to mount\r\nupon it, with disastrous results, and to the infinite laughter of the\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Methodists]\r\n\r\nNot unfrequently the chaplains fell out with the Methodists among\r\ntheir flocks. They had been specially imported by Wellington in order\r\nthat they might discourage the prayer meetings—“getting up little\r\nconventicles” as one of them called these assemblies. “The Church\r\nservice is sufficient for the instruction of mankind,” said another,\r\nand “the zeal for preaching” tended to self-sufficiency and incipient\r\npharisaism. On the whole, however, there was no regular or normal\r\nopposition between Church of England and Methodist soldiers; they were\r\nin such a minority among the godless that it would have been absurd\r\nfor them to have quarrelled. The Methodists regularly received the\r\nsacrament from the chaplains along with the churchmen, and the latter\r\nwere frequently to be found at the prayer meetings of the former.\r\n\r\nSergeant Stevenson’s memoir, a mine of useful information in this\r\nrespect, informs us that the regular organized prayer meeting of the\r\nWesleyans in the 1st Division was begun in a gravel-pit just outside\r\nthe walls of Badajoz, in September, 1809, and never ceased from that\r\ntime forward. During the long sojourn behind the Lines of Torres Vedras\r\nit was held for many weeks in a large wine-press, holding more than a\r\nhundred men, behind the village of Cartaxo, quite close to Wellington’s\r\nheadquarters, where indeed the hymns sung could be clearly heard.\r\nThere were similar associations in other divisions, some mainly Church\r\nof England, some (as in the 79th regiment) Presbyterian. Stevenson\r\nsays that he never heard of any opposition on the part of commanding\r\nofficers, save in the case of one captain, whose preaching was finally\r\nended by a course of persecution on the part of his colonel. But of\r\ncourse the “saints” had to endure a good deal of ridicule from their\r\ncomrades, more especially those of them who took occasion to testify\r\nagainst drunkenness or blasphemy. Stevenson gives a verse of his own,\r\nwhich he says that he pasted up in the sergeants’ room of the 3rd\r\nGuards, to discourage profane swearing at large.\r\n\r\n       “It chills the blood to hear the Blest Supreme\r\n        Rashly appealed to on each trifling theme,\r\n        Maintain your rank: vulgarity despise;\r\n        To swear is neither _brave_, _polite_, nor _wise_.”\r\n\r\nWe may observe a certain canny appeal to the self-respect of the\r\nnon-commissioned officer, in the insinuation that by blasphemy he\r\nlowers himself to the ranks, and is guilty of vulgarity and want of\r\npoliteness. It is to be feared that these couplets might have been not\r\ninappropriately hung up in the mess rooms of certain regiments whose\r\ncolonels were by no means choice in their language.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Soldier-Parsons]\r\n\r\nAmong the senior officers of the Peninsular Army there were a good\r\nnumber who were not merely like Wellington, conformists of an official\r\nsort, but zealous Christians, such were Hill, Le Marchant,[332]\r\nColborne, and John Beckwith—the Light Division colonel, who devoted\r\nhis later years to taking care of the Waldenses of Piedmont, among\r\nwhom he settled down in the evening of his life. Quite a sprinkling\r\nof the younger officers took orders when the war was over, after the\r\ngreat disbandment of 1816–17, when all the second battalions were\r\ndisembodied. Such were three men who have left us excellent Peninsular\r\ndiaries, Gleig of the 85th, the author of “The Subaltern,” and other\r\nworks, afterwards Chaplain-General to the forces; Dallas, who made a\r\ngreat name as an evangelist at Burford, was another soldier-parson;\r\nBoothby, who wrote a good journal concerning Maida, Corunna, and\r\nTalavera, was a third. The type generally ran to strong Evangelicalism,\r\nas was natural, considering that this was the really live and vigorous\r\nelement in the Church of that day.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the religious condition of regiments varied\r\nextremely—that in some the influence of serious and devout officers\r\nand men was large, in others practically invisible. The character of\r\nthe colonel made some difference for good or bad, but I imagine that\r\nmore depended on the existence or non-existence of some small knot of\r\nofficers or sergeants who did not fear to let their views be known,\r\nand formed a nucleus around which steady men gathered. Their names\r\nare mostly forgotten, the record of their witnessing has perished, or\r\nemerges only in some obscure corner of a little-read biography or an\r\nold religious magazine. I could wish that some sympathetic hand could\r\ndevote a whole book to collecting and recording that which I have only\r\nbeen able to touch upon in this short chapter. It is a side of the life\r\nof the Peninsular Army which well deserves recording, since without\r\nsome notice of it the picture of military society during the great war\r\nis wholly incomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\n\r\n(A.)

Putting aside the regiments with many\r\nbattalions (the 1st, 14th, 27th, 60th, 95th), the remainder fall into\r\ntwo-battalion and single-battalion corps.\r\n\r\nOf the 61 double-battalion regiments--\r\n\r\n   9 were at a strength of 2250 or thereabouts.[338]\r\n  17 were at a strength of 2031 or thereabouts.[339]\r\n  16 were at a strength of 1820 or thereabouts.[340]\r\n  12 were at a strength of 1610 or thereabouts.[341]\r\n   7 were at a strength of under 1600.[342]\r\n\r\nAll the regiments on the two higher establishments (with one exception)\r\nhad both battalions on active service in 1809, either one in the Indies\r\nand one in Europe, or both in Europe. Hence it was necessary to keep\r\nthem at a very high figure.\r\n\r\nThose with 1820 or 1610 men were nearly all regiments which had one\r\nbattalion on active service and one on home service, though a very few\r\nhad both overseas (such as the 18th, 34th, 39th, 62nd); in such cases\r\nthe 2nd battalion, though on service, was very weak.\r\n\r\nThe two-battalion corps with under 1600 men were almost invariably\r\nregiments which had one battalion in the Indies, worked down to very\r\nlow numbers by disease, and had failed to keep up its strength (the\r\n15th, 25th, 96th in the West, the 59th, 69th in the East Indies).\r\n\r\nThe 37 single-battalion regiments stood on the following\r\nestablishments--\r\n\r\n   6 were at a strength of 1126 or thereabouts.[343]\r\n  13 were at a strength of 940 or thereabouts.[344]\r\n  15 were at a strength of 700–730 or thereabouts.[345]\r\n   3 were at a strength of under 600.[346]\r\n\r\nThose corps on the two higher establishments are either actually\r\nserving, or are designated for immediate service abroad, and have\r\ntherefore their establishments fixed high. Those on the lower\r\nestablishments (730 or under) fall into two classes: either they are\r\nregiments in the East or West Indies which have died down to a low\r\nfigure [_e.g._ 16th, 37th, 46th, 54th, 55th, 65th, 68th, 70th, 86th]\r\nor they are battalions quartered in peaceful stations and not expected\r\nto be sent on active service, [_e.g._ 41st, 99th, 100th, 103rd, in\r\nCanada and Bermuda] or at home [74th, 75th, 77th, 85th, 94th]. All the\r\nlast-named five, on home service, were raised to a higher establishment\r\nand sent to the front in 1810–12.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that of the one hundred and three 1st battalions,\r\nor single-battalion regiments, a great many were not available, viz.\r\ntwenty-one in the East Indies, twenty-one in the West Indies (including\r\nBermuda), eleven in the Mediterranean Garrisons, five at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, six in Canada, two in (or bound for) New South Wales. There\r\nwere only twenty-five 1st battalions at home, and of these twenty\r\nhad served under Moore in the Corunna retreat and then went on the\r\nWalcheren expedition, so that in 1809 they were unavailable. Three\r\nmore battalions which had not served under Moore had shared in the\r\nsame descent on the Scheldt (74th, 77th, 85th). There were actually\r\nonly two single-battalion corps which had neither gone to Corunna nor\r\nto Walcheren and were available at home (75th and 94th).[347] In the\r\nway of the strongly organized first battalions, therefore, there was\r\nabsolutely nil to send to Wellington in 1809 save Craufurd’s three\r\nLight Infantry battalions, which though they had been with Moore in\r\nJanuary were back in the Peninsula by July (1/43rd, 1/52nd, 1/95th).\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see, therefore, that there was the greatest possible\r\ndifficulty in finding battalions with which Wellesley’s Peninsular Army\r\ncould be reinforced. Of troops which had not gone to Walcheren there\r\nwere left in Great Britain only the 75th and 94th, with twenty-eight\r\n2nd (or junior) battalions which had not joined in the expedition to\r\nthe Scheldt. These were almost without exception very weak units, the\r\nfirst battalions of ten of these were in the Indies, then of five more\r\nalready in the Peninsula, all their strength was used up in keeping\r\ntheir senior battalions full, of the remaining thirteen only two\r\n(2/5th 2/34th, 2/38th), were strong enough to be sent to Portugal. The\r\nreinforcements which Wellington was given in the autumn of 1809 and\r\nthe summer of 1810 were largely scraped up from foreign garrisons—the\r\n1/7th from Nova Scotia, the 1/11th from Madeira, the 1/57th from\r\nGibraltar. But in 1810 Walcheren battalions began to come out, such\r\nas the 3/1st, 1/9th, 1/50th, 1/71st, 1/79th, and to load Wellington’s\r\nhospitals with ague-stricken convalescents.

The troops sent to Cadiz early in 1810\r\nwere detachments, viz. 4 companies of the 2/1st Guards, 3 of the 2/2nd,\r\n3 of the 2/3rd.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS CORPS.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the regular units shown in these lists, there are on\r\nthe estimates of 1809 twelve veteran battalions, with effectives\r\nranging from 693 to 1129, and eight garrison battalions, mostly with\r\nan establishment of 906. Most of these were at home, but a few in the\r\nMediterranean garrisons.\r\n\r\nThere were also the foreign corps of Meuron, de Roll, Watteville,\r\nDillon, _Chasseurs Britanniques_, Royal Malta, Royal Corsicans and\r\nthe Sicilian regiment, all in the Mediterranean, with the York Light\r\nInfantry, York Rangers, and Royal West India Rangers in the West\r\nIndies. These were all single battalion corps ranging from 1361 men\r\n(de Roll) to 694 (York L. I.). The black regiments, eight West India\r\nbattalions with 1125 men each, could only be used in their own regions.\r\n\r\nOf the King’s German Legion there were at home the two Heavy Dragoon\r\nRegiments with an establishment of 694 each, and the 2nd and 3rd\r\nHussars, with the same numbers. The 3rd Hussars were just back from\r\nthe Corunna Retreat: the 2nd went to Walcheren. Of the ten infantry\r\nbattalions, four (1st, 2nd, 5th, 7th Line) were with the Peninsular\r\nField Army, as was the 1st Hussars; four (3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th Line) were\r\nin Sicily; 1st and 2nd Light battalions (just back from Corunna) were\r\nat home, and went to Walcheren. Four battalions had establishments of\r\n1062, six of 902, of all ranks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nDIVISIONAL AND BRIGADE ORGANIZATION AND CHANGES.\r\n\r\n1809–1814.\r\n\r\nBY C. T.

Anson,\r\n        composed of 23rd Light Dragoons and 1st Hussars K.G.L.\r\n\r\n        On November 1 Granby Calcroft was commanding A for Fane, absent.\r\n\r\n        By November 24 1st Dragoons (who arrived at Lisbon in October)\r\n        replaced the 16th Light Dragoons in B, now under Slade,\r\n        as Cotton was assisting Payne in command of the division;\r\n        16th Light Dragoons were transferred to C _vice_ 23rd Light\r\n        Dragoons, ordered home after their losses at Talavera.\r\n\r\n        _1st Division._ 1/40th, from Seville, replaced 2/9th before\r\n        June 21, 2/9th going to Gibraltar and relieving 1/61st, who\r\n        joined before Talavera, on which 1/40th were transferred to\r\n        IV B.\r\n\r\n        After Talavera 2/24th and 2/42nd were added to I B, 2/83rd\r\n        being sent down to Lisbon.\r\n\r\n        At Talavera, H. Campbell was wounded, Stopford replacing him\r\n        in command of the division and brigade, but from November 8\r\n        to December 15, Hulse had the brigade. Langwerth having been\r\n        killed at Talavera, Beck of 1st Line K.G.L. succeeded to his\r\n        brigade, but the two K.G.L. brigades were amalgamated under Löw\r\n        from November 1.\r\n\r\n    _2nd Division._ By June 21 Tilson (from III B) had taken over\r\n        Hill’s own brigade. Before Talavera 1/48th (arrived at Lisbon\r\n        June 22, on being relieved at Gibraltar by 2/30th) had been\r\n        added to II B.\r\n\r\n        In September, a new brigade, C, under Catlin Craufurd, was\r\n        added, composed of 2/28th, 2/34th, 2/39th, and about the same\r\n        time 2/31st (from III A) was added to II A. By November 1,\r\n        1/57th (from Gibraltar) replaced 1st Detachments in II B, the\r\n        Battalions of Detachments having been broken up.\r\n\r\n        From December 15 on II A was under command of Duckworth of\r\n        2/48th.\r\n\r\n    _3rd Division._ Tilson, moving to II A, was replaced by Donkin\r\n        (June 21).\r\n\r\n        Before Talavera 2/24th replaced 3/27th (sent down to Lisbon) in\r\n        III A.\r\n\r\n        Mackenzie was killed at Talavera, and the division passed\r\n        under the command of R. Craufurd, whose brigade, 1/43rd,\r\n        1/52nd and 1/95th, arrived just too late for the battle, and\r\n        was apparently added to the division in place of Mackenzie’s\r\n        brigade which was amalgamated with Donkin’s. On September 15,\r\n        2/87th was ordered down to Lisbon for garrison duty, 2/24th\r\n        being transferred to II B and 2/31st to II A about the same\r\n        time.\r\n\r\n        In October, Donkin gave up his brigade, Mackinnon obtaining\r\n        command.\r\n\r\n    _4th Division._ Myers of 2/7th seems to have commanded IV A for\r\n        A. Campbell.\r\n\r\n        By Talavera 1/40th had been added to IV B, of which Kemmis had\r\n        taken command vice Sontag.\r\n\r\n        At Talavera A. Campbell was wounded, and had to go home, the\r\n        division being without a definite G.O.C. till the arrival of\r\n        Lowry Cole in October.\r\n\r\n        In September 1/11th (arrived at Lisbon from Madeira in August)\r\n        was added to IV A. On the Battalions of Detachments being sent\r\n        home (October), 3/27th, in garrison at Lisbon since after the\r\n        Douro, replaced the 2nd Battalion in IV B.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes in 1810]\r\n\r\n1810.\r\n\r\n On January 1, the composition of the Army was as follows:--\r\n\r\n    _Cavalry._ G.O.C., Payne; Cotton, second in command.\r\n\r\n        A [Fane], 3rd Dragoon Guards, 4th Dragoons; B [Slade], 1st\r\n        Dragoons, 14th Light Dragoons; C [G.

Two\r\n        troops of the regiment went to Cadiz, but rejoined the regiment\r\n        in September.\r\n\r\n        Before the end of the year Fane seems to have gone home ill.\r\n\r\n    _1st Division._ On April 26 Cotton was posted to the command of\r\n        the division, _vice_ Sherbrooke, gone home ill, but gave place\r\n        to Spencer, June 3, on getting the Cavalry Division.\r\n\r\n        In the “States” of March 8 to August 1, no brigadier is given\r\n        for I B. On August 4 Lord Blantyre (of 2/42nd) was appointed to\r\n        command I B “during the absence of Brigadier-General Cameron.”\r\n        Cameron was back in command from October 1, but on November 26\r\n        he was invalided home, Blantyre probably commanding again.\r\n\r\n        By the Orders of September 12, 1/79th (just arrived from\r\n        Cadiz), was posted to I B _vice_ 1/61st, to be transferred to a\r\n        new brigade to form part of the 1st Division. These orders were\r\n        suspended from September 14, and at Bussaco 1/7th (arrived from\r\n        Halifax before end of July), and 1/79th formed a brigade (I D)\r\n        under Pakenham.\r\n\r\n        On October 6, orders were given for the transfer of Pakenham’s\r\n        brigade to the 4th Division, the exchange between the 1/61st\r\n        and 1/79th having been carried out previously, and a new\r\n        brigade was added under Erskine, comprising 1/50th (arrived\r\n        September 24), 1/71st (arrived September 26), 1/92nd (arrived\r\n        in October, before the 6th), and 1 company 3/95th.\r\n\r\n    _2nd Division._ On June 20 Leith was appointed to command\r\n        “Tilson’s brigade,” and to command the division “under Hill,”\r\n        but in the “State” of July 8 his name appears as commanding\r\n        the brigade composed of 3/1st, 1/9th, and 2/38th. On August 8\r\n        orders were issued to W. Stewart to take command of Tilson’s\r\n        brigade and of the division under Hill. In November Hill went\r\n        on sick leave.\r\n\r\n        Leith’s name ceases to appear in the returns as commanding\r\n        II A from July 8, and W. Stewart’s name appears in his place\r\n        from July 27. When Stewart commanded the division, Colborne of\r\n        2/66th had the brigade. C. Craufurd died in September, and at\r\n        Bussaco Wilson of 2/39th commanded II C. On September 30 Lumley\r\n        was posted to command it.\r\n\r\n        Before September 1 R. Stewart had gone home ill, and at\r\n        Bussaco Inglis (of 1/57th) commanded II B. On October 8 Hoghton\r\n        was posted to it.\r\n\r\n    _3rd Division._ From January 8 on 5/60th no longer appear in\r\n        the Returns as belonging to the division, and their place in\r\n        the brigade was taken by 74th, who arrived at Lisbon February\r\n        8, and are mentioned in Orders on February 22 as in III B.\r\n\r\n        On February 22 the division was reorganized, R. Craufurd’s\r\n        brigade becoming, with two battalions of Caçadores, the\r\n        Light Division. Mackinnon’s brigade now became III A, and\r\n        Lightburne’s brigade was transferred from the 4th Division and\r\n        became III B. The headquarters and three companies 5/60th were\r\n        posted to Lightburne’s brigade, the remaining companies having\r\n        been posted to I A, I B, II A, II B, II C, IV A, IV B. At the\r\n        same time a Portuguese brigade composed of the 9th and 21st\r\n        Regiments (under Harvey) was added to the division.\r\n\r\n        At Bussaco Champlemond was in command of the Portuguese\r\n        brigade, by October 29 Sutton had it, Champlemond being wounded\r\n        at Bussaco.\r\n\r\n        On September 12 2/83rd was posted to III B, 2/88th having\r\n        arrived from Cadiz to relieve them September 4. Hurrying to\r\n        the front they joined their brigade before Bussaco. When they\r\n        did join, 2/58th was detached from III B for garrison duty at\r\n        Lisbon. 94th (arrived from Cadiz September 20), were added to\r\n        III B on October 6, and on October 10 Colville was posted to\r\n        command the brigade _vice_ Lightburne, who went home.\r\n\r\n    _4th Division._ On the transfer of Lightburne’s brigade to\r\n        the 3rd Division the other two brigades exchanged places,\r\n        Kemmis’ becoming IV A, and being Cole’s brigade, but under the\r\n        immediate command of Kemmis. A. Campbell, who had rejoined,\r\n        took command of his old brigade.\r\n\r\n        The 3rd and 15th Portuguese were added to the division in\r\n        February, as a brigade under Collins.\r\n\r\n        At Bussaco the Portuguese brigade consisted of the 11th and\r\n        23rd, the 3rd and 15th having been removed to the 5th Division.\r\n\r\n        On October 6 A. Campbell’s brigade was removed from the\r\n        division to become the nucleus of the newly-formed 6th\r\n        Division, its place being taken by Pakenham’s from the 1st\r\n        Division, _i.e._ 1/7th, 1/61st, to which the Brunswick Oels\r\n        Light Infantry (arrived Lisbon September 17) were added.\r\n\r\n        On November 12 the Brunswick Oels were removed to the Light\r\n        Division, but one company was posted to IV B, two more being\r\n        detached to provide the newly-formed 5th Division, with extra\r\n        light troops. Their place in IV B was taken by the newly\r\n        arrived 1/23rd from Halifax, Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\n        On November 17 2/7th and 1/61st were ordered to exchange, IV B\r\n        thus becoming the Fusilier Brigade.\r\n\r\n    _Light Division._ Formed on February 22 by the removal of\r\n        R. Craufurd’s brigade from the 3rd Division, the 1st and\r\n        3rd Portuguese Caçadores being added to it. On August 4 it\r\n        was broken up into two brigades, as follows: A [Beckwith of\r\n        1/95th] 1/43rd, 4 companies 1/95th, 1st Caçadores; B [Barclay\r\n        of 1/52nd] 1/52nd, 4 companies 1/95th, 3rd Caçadores. Barclay\r\n        having been wounded at Bussaco, Wynch of 1/4th got the brigade\r\n        (in Orders of November 14th).\r\n\r\n        A company of 2/95th (from Cadiz) was added to A before October\r\n        1. On November 12 nine companies Brunswick Oels joined B.\r\n\r\n    _5th Division._ Officially this division first appears in the\r\n        “State” of August 8, when the 3/1st, 1/9th, and 2/38th,[349]\r\n        are first called the “Fifth Division,” a Portuguese brigade,\r\n        Spry’s (_i.e._ 3rd and 15th Line), being added, and Leith being\r\n        G.O.C.\r\n\r\n        On August 4 J. S. Barns of 3/1st was appointed to command the\r\n        British brigade, being superseded by Hay September 30.\r\n\r\n        On October 6 orders were issued that Leith should command\r\n        the 5th Division, and that it should be composed of\r\n        Brigadier-General Hay’s brigade, a brigade made up of 1/4th\r\n        (from England, they first appear in the “State” of November\r\n        15), 2/30th (from Cadiz), and 2/44th (from Cadiz), and Spry’s\r\n        Portuguese.\r\n\r\n        On November 5 Dunlop was posted to V B, hitherto under its\r\n        senior battalion commander.\r\n\r\n        On November 12 a company of the Brunswick Oels was posted to\r\n        each of the British brigades.\r\n\r\n    _6th Division._ Ordered to be formed October 6, by taking A.\r\n        Campbell’s brigade out of the 4th Division and adding Eben’s\r\n        Portuguese (_i.e._ 8th Line and Lusitanian Legion) to it: A.\r\n        Campbell being G.O.C.\r\n\r\n        On November 14, Hulse was posted to A. Campbell’s brigade.\r\n\r\n        On November 17 1/61st from IV B exchanged with 2/7th.\r\n\r\n    In addition to the Portuguese brigades attached to the 3rd,\r\n        4th, 5th, and 6th Divisions there were at least five others,\r\n        two of which, the 4th under Archibald Campbell (=4th and 10th\r\n        Line), and 2nd under Fonseca (=2nd and 14th Line) formed a\r\n        division under Hamilton, which acted throughout under Hill.\r\n        Wellington says that he intended to organize this division like\r\n        the rest, but the heavy losses at Albuera and the consequent\r\n        necessity of reforming the 2nd Division made it impossible for\r\n        him to carry out his resolve. [Cf. _Wellington Dispatches_,\r\n        viii. 111.]\r\n\r\n        The remaining brigades were the 1st (Pack’s), consisting of the\r\n        1st and 16th Line and 4th Caçadores, the 5th (A. Campbell’s),\r\n        6th and 18th Line, and 6th Caçadores; the 6th (Coleman’s), 7th\r\n        and 19th Line and 2nd Caçadores. On the formation of the 7th\r\n        Division in March, 1811, Coleman’s brigade was posted to it,\r\n        the other two remaining unattached.\r\n\r\n        The 12th and 13th Line and 5th Caçadores seem to have formed\r\n        yet another brigade under Bradford, but in October the 13th\r\n        Line was in garrison at Abrantes.\r\n\r\n        Spry’s brigade ranked at the 3rd, Eben’s as the 7th, Sutton’s\r\n        as the 8th, and Collins’ as the 9th.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: State of January 1, 1811]\r\n\r\n1811.\r\n\r\n  On January 1 the Army was organized as follows:--\r\n\r\n    _Cavalry._ G.O.C., Cotton.

Hussars, commanded C.\r\n\r\n        On March 19 Long was posted to command the cavalry of the\r\n        force usually under Hill, but commanded by Beresford during\r\n        Hill’s absence. At Albuera Lumley (of II C) was in command\r\n        of Beresford’s cavalry, Long’s conduct not having given\r\n        satisfaction to the Marshal. On May 11 Erskine was appointed to\r\n        command “the cavalry south of the Tagus.”\r\n\r\n        On June 13 a new brigade, D, was formed under Long, composed of\r\n        13th Light Dragoons and 2nd Hussars K.G.L., two squadrons of\r\n        which had landed April 8. On June 18 the 11th Light Dragoons\r\n        (arrived June 1) replaced the 13th, transferred to Slade’s\r\n        brigade.\r\n\r\n        On June 19 a reorganization of the cavalry in two divisions was\r\n        ordered, as follows:--\r\n\r\n        1st Cavalry Division. G.O.C., Cotton. B [Slade], 1st Dragoons,\r\n            13th and 14th Light Dragoons; C [G. Anson], 16th Light\r\n            Dragoons, 1st Hussars, K.G.L.; also Madden’s Portuguese.\r\n\r\n        2nd Cavalry Division. G.O.C., Erskine. A [de Grey], 3rd Dragoon\r\n            Guards, 4th Dragoons; D [Long], 11th Light Dragoons, 2nd\r\n            Hussars, K.G.L.\r\n\r\n        On July 19 another reorganization took place, the final result\r\n        being as follows:--\r\n\r\n        1st Cavalry Division. G.O.C., Cotton. B [Slade], 1st Dragoons,\r\n            12th Light Dragoons (arrived July 1), vice 13th (to C) and\r\n            14th (to D); C [G. Anson], 13th and 16th Light Dragoons;\r\n            E [V. Alten, a new brigade], 11th Light Dragoons (from D)\r\n            and 1st Hussars, K.G.L. (from C); Madden’s Portuguese.\r\n\r\n        2nd Cavalry Division. A [de Grey], 3rd Dragoon Guards, 4th\r\n            Dragoons; D [Long], 14th Light Dragoons, 2nd Hussars, K.G.L.\r\n\r\n        On August 1, 9th Light Dragoons (newly arrived) were posted\r\n        to Long’s brigade, together with 13th Light Dragoons, which\r\n        exchanged from C with 14th.\r\n\r\n        On August 30, a new brigade, F, was added, comprising 4th\r\n        Dragoon Guards, arrived August 15, and 3rd Dragoons, arrived\r\n        before August 20, its commander being Le Marchant. By October\r\n        1, 5th Dragoon Guards had been added to this brigade.\r\n\r\n        On October 5 de Grey’s brigade was transferred to the 1st\r\n        Cavalry Division, to which Le Marchant’s was attached by Orders\r\n        of November 8, the Portuguese brigade being struck off that\r\n        division.\r\n\r\n        From December 8 on the States do not give any G.O.C. for the\r\n        2nd Cavalry Division.\r\n\r\n    _1st Division._ On January 23 Nightingale was posted to I B: on\r\n        February 6 Howard obtained I D, when Erskine was transferred to\r\n        the command of the 5th Division. On June 8 H. Campbell’s name\r\n        is given in the “State” as in command of I A, Stopford being\r\n        transferred to IV B (in Orders for this June 18). Nightingale\r\n        departing to Bengal before June 25 his brigade had no permanent\r\n        commander till July 28, when Stopford got it.\r\n\r\n        Owing to the heavy losses of the 2nd Division at Albuera and\r\n        its consequent reconstruction, Howard’s brigade was transferred\r\n        to it on June 6, and at the same time the detachment of the\r\n        Light Battalions of the K.G.L., hitherto in I C, rejoined those\r\n        battalions, which had been posted to VII A.\r\n\r\n        On June 26 orders were issued for the 7th Line K.G.L., to go\r\n        home, its rank and file being drafted into the other three\r\n        battalions. On July 21 1/26th were added to I B, having\r\n        recently arrived from England.\r\n\r\n        On August 9, Graham was appointed to command the division,\r\n        Spencer having gone home in July, he received leave July 25.\r\n        From December 1 onward I B appears in the “States” as having no\r\n        G.O.C.\r\n\r\n    _2nd Division._ The heavy losses at Albuera led to the\r\n        reorganization of the division, detailed in Orders June 6.\r\n        Howard’s brigade of the 1st Division was transferred to the\r\n        2nd Division, becoming II A. The remainder of the brigades\r\n        of Colborne and Hoghton (who was killed) were formed into a\r\n        Provisional Battalion, less 1/48th and 2/48th; 1/48th, to which\r\n        the rank and file of 2/48th were drafted (the cadre of 2/48th\r\n        going home), was transferred to IV B.\r\n\r\n        This Provisional Battalion was placed in Lumley’s brigade,\r\n        of which Abercromby (of 2/28th) had had temporary command at\r\n        Albuera, while Lumley was in charge of the cavalry. At the same\r\n        time, Ashworth’s Portuguese brigade was definitely attached to\r\n        it: this was the 5th Brigade, which had been under A. Campbell\r\n        in October, 1810, but had come under Ashworth by March 11; it\r\n        comprised the 6th and 18th Line and 6th Caçadores. Cf. also\r\n        _Wellington Dispatches_, viii, 566, and S. D. vii. 135.\r\n\r\n        Before the end of May Hill returned and took over command\r\n        of the division, as well as of the whole force commanded by\r\n        Beresford at Albuera.\r\n\r\n        On July 22 1/28th (newly arrived from Gibraltar) was posted to\r\n        Lumley’s brigade.\r\n\r\n        On August 7 orders were issued for 1/3rd and 1/57th to resume\r\n        their separate formations, large drafts having arrived from\r\n        their second battalions in England. The division was again\r\n        formed in three brigades, Howard’s being II A, and 1/3rd,\r\n        1/57th, and the Provisional Battalion, [_i.e._ 29th (3\r\n        companies), 2/31st (4 companies) and 2/66th (3 companies)]\r\n        forming II B, apparently under Inglis of 1/57th, while 1/28th,\r\n        2/28th, 2/34th, and 2/39th under Lumley formed II C.\r\n\r\n        On August 21 2/28th was drafted into 1/28th, and sent home,\r\n        and the company 3/95th, hitherto in Howard’s brigade, were\r\n        transferred to Beckwith’s brigade of the Light Division, being\r\n        replaced in II A by a company of 5/60th, there being three with\r\n        the division.\r\n\r\n        On September 21 Byng was posted to command II B, and on October\r\n        9 Wilson was appointed to command II C, Lumley having gone home\r\n        sick early in August.\r\n\r\n        On October 3 orders were issued for 29th to go home to recruit;\r\n        on October 20 1/39th, just arrived from Sicily, was added to II\r\n        C, 2/39th being drafted into it and sent home by Orders issued\r\n        December 17.\r\n\r\n    _3rd Division._ Orders of March 5 direct the transfer of the\r\n        headquarter companies 5/60th to III A, 2/88th, on garrison duty\r\n        at Lisbon since September 4, 1810, being added to III B. On\r\n        July 10, 2/88th was ordered to be drafted into 1/88th, and the\r\n        cadre sent home.\r\n\r\n        On July 22 the 77th were added to III B.\r\n\r\n        From July 1 to October 31 Mackinnon was absent from his\r\n        brigade, ill, Wallace of 1/88th commanding it in his place.\r\n\r\n        On December 22 Colville was transferred to the command of the\r\n        4th Division, in Cole’s absence on leave, J. Campbell of the\r\n        94th getting III B.\r\n\r\n        Champlemond had the Portuguese brigade on March 19; but by\r\n        Fuentes Power had it.\r\n\r\n    _4th Division._ By February 1 the headquarters and 9 companies\r\n        Brunswick Oels had been added to IV A, having been removed from\r\n        the Light Division, but on the formation of the 7th Division\r\n        (March 5), they were removed to it.\r\n\r\n        On January 23 Houston was appointed to IV B _vice_ Pakenham,\r\n        but left the brigade again March 5, on being appointed to\r\n        command the 7th Division: Myers would seem to have commanded IV\r\n        B till Albuera, where he was killed. On June 18 Stopford was\r\n        appointed to command IV B, but was transferred to I B on July\r\n        28, Pakenham again getting IV B. From November 15 onwards the\r\n        “States” do not give any brigadier for IV B, but it continued\r\n        to be described as “Pakenham’s.”\r\n\r\n        After Albuera 2/7th was drafted into 1/7th, the remnants being\r\n        sent home June 26; 1/48th from the 2nd Division was added to IV\r\n        B June 6. On October 3, the 97th, a single battalion regiment,\r\n        was ordered home in consequence of its severe losses.\r\n\r\n        On December 22 Colville was appointed to command the division,\r\n        Cole having gone home ill.\r\n\r\n        At Albuera Harvey was in command of the Portuguese brigade of\r\n        the division, to which 1st battalion Loyal Lusitanian Legion\r\n        had been added on March 14: by September this unit was renamed\r\n        7th Caçadores, the brigade was then again under Collins, who at\r\n        Albuera had led a provisional brigade from the Elvas garrison\r\n        [5th Line, 5th Caçadores].\r\n\r\n    _5th Division._ From February 1 to February 6 the division was\r\n        without a G.O.C., Leith being absent: on February 6, Erskine\r\n        was appointed to command it, but was transferred to the command\r\n        of the advanced guard (the Light Division and cavalry), from\r\n        March 7 to April 22. During this period Dunlop seems to have\r\n        commanded the division, Egerton of 2/44th commanding V B.\r\n\r\n        On May 11 Erskine was appointed to the 2nd Cavalry Division,\r\n        and Dunlop again had temporary command of the division until\r\n        October 2, when G. T. Walker was appointed to command his\r\n        brigade. By December 1 Leith was again in command of the\r\n        division.\r\n\r\n        On March 14 the 2nd Battalion Loyal Lusitanian Legion had been\r\n        added to Spry’s Portuguese brigade. By September it had been\r\n        renamed 8th Caçadores.\r\n\r\n    _6th Division._ Orders of March 5 directed the addition to the\r\n        division of a new brigade under Burne (of 1/36th), comprising\r\n        2nd and 1/36th.\r\n\r\n        It seems to have been intended to put the Brunswick Oels into\r\n        the 6th Division, but on the formation of the 7th Division\r\n        (March 5), they were put in C. Alten’s brigade.\r\n\r\n        On July 21 1/32nd, arrived at Lisbon before July 8, was posted\r\n        to VI B.\r\n\r\n        A. Campbell leaving for India in November, the division was\r\n        without a definite G.O.C. till the end of the year, Burne\r\n        commanding it temporarily.\r\n\r\n        On March 14 the Loyal Lusitanian Legion was removed from the\r\n        Portuguese brigade of the division, and distributed as Caçador\r\n        battalions to the 4th and 5th Divisions, being replaced by the\r\n        12th Line, formerly in Bradford’s brigade. At Fuentes Madden\r\n        commanded the brigade.\r\n\r\n    _Light Division._ Wynch dying January 6, the 2nd Brigade was\r\n        without a commander till February 7, when Drummond (of 1/52nd)\r\n        was appointed to it. Craufurd having gone home on leave before\r\n        February 8, the division had no G.O.C., but was under Erskine\r\n        from March 7 on, together with the Cavalry who also were in the\r\n        advanced guard.\r\n\r\n        On March 5 2/52nd, newly arrived at Lisbon, was added to\r\n        Drummond’s brigade.\r\n\r\n        R. Craufurd returned April 22 and took over the division from\r\n        Erskine.\r\n\r\n        By August 1 Beckwith had been invalided home, Andrew Barnard of\r\n        the 95th commanding the brigade in his place.\r\n\r\n        On August 21 the headquarters and four companies of the 3/95th,\r\n        which had gone out to Cadiz in 1810, arrived at Lisbon, and\r\n        were added to the 1st Brigade, the company 3/95th hitherto with\r\n        II A being also added to the same brigade.\r\n\r\n        Drummond dying before September 8, Vandeleur was appointed\r\n        to the vacant brigade on September 30. By October 1 another\r\n        company 2/95th had been added to the 1st Brigade.\r\n\r\n    _7th Division._ Orders were issued on March 5 for the formation\r\n        of this division, to be composed of two British brigades\r\n        under C. Alten and Long, and Coleman’s Portuguese, _i.e._\r\n        7th and 19th Line and 2nd Caçadores. The composition of the\r\n        British brigades is not given, but General Orders say that\r\n        the Brunswick Oels should be in Alten’s brigade, and the\r\n        Chasseurs Britanniques (arrived at Lisbon from Cadiz, January\r\n        28) in Long’s. The other regiments in the division were 51st\r\n        (arrived during February), 85th (arrived March 4), which were\r\n        in Long’s brigade, and the 1st and 2nd Light Battalions,\r\n        K.G.L., in Alten’s. These last only landed on March 21, and\r\n        did not join the division till it came down with Wellington\r\n        from Almeida to the Guadiana Valley for the second siege of\r\n        Badajoz. Till then they had been attached to the force under\r\n        Beresford: Schwertfeger (_Geschichte der K.G.L._, i. 317) says\r\n        the battalions formed part of the 2nd Division, but this does\r\n        not seem accurate. As they had no casualties at the siege of\r\n        Badajoz, in which the 7th Division suffered severely, one may\r\n        presume that they finally joined the division after the siege\r\n        was raised.\r\n\r\n        Thus the British brigade (at first there was only one) was\r\n        51st, 85th, Chasseurs Britanniques, Brunswick Oels. On March\r\n        31 Sontag was posted to it _vice_ Long, removed to command\r\n        Beresford’s cavalry, March 19.\r\n\r\n        On July 19 68th (just arrived) was posted to VII B.\r\n\r\n        Houston was invalided home before August 1, Sontag commanding\r\n        the division. By October he too was invalided (his A.D.C.\r\n        received orders to rejoin his regiment on October 29). Alten\r\n        was in temporary command, C. Halkett commanding his brigade.\r\n        VII B was without a G.O.C. from October 15 till de Bernewitz\r\n        got it on December 23.\r\n\r\n        On October 3 85th (a single-battalion regiment) was ordered to\r\n        go home to recruit.\r\n\r\n        Le Cor was posted to Coleman’s brigade on March 14; at Fuentes\r\n        Doyle had it.\r\n\r\n    _Portuguese._ No changes seem to have taken place in Hamilton’s\r\n        division, or in Pack’s brigade, but the other unattached\r\n        brigade was under McMahon in September, and included the 13th\r\n        and 22nd Line and 5th Caçadores, the 12th Line having been\r\n        transferred to the 6th Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Organization on January 1, 1812]\r\n\r\n1812.\r\n\r\n  On January 1 the organization of the Army was as follows:--\r\n\r\n    _Cavalry._ 1st Division.

Alten was again in command of his brigade.\r\n\r\n        Several changes took place under orders issued January 29; the\r\n        3rd and 4th Dragoon Guards were posted to Slade’s brigade, from\r\n        which the 12th Light Dragoons were removed to G. Anson’s, the\r\n        4th Dragoons replaced the 4th Dragoon Guards in Le Marchant’s,\r\n        and de Grey’s brigade disappeared. F. Ponsonby of the 12th\r\n        Light Dragoons took command of C in Anson’s absence.\r\n\r\n        By April 8 Erskine had resumed command of the 2nd Cavalry\r\n        Division, to which Slade’s brigade was transferred April 14,\r\n        Bock’s joining the 1st Division.\r\n\r\n        On July 1, an exchange was ordered between the 11th and 14th\r\n        Light Dragoons: G. Anson, who had resumed command of his\r\n        brigade, having 11th, 12th and 16th Light Dragoons, V. Alten\r\n        14th Light Dragoons and 1st Hussars, K.G.L.\r\n\r\n        At Salamanca Cotton was wounded, and Le Marchant killed. While\r\n        Cotton was disabled, Bock commanded the Cavalry, de Jonquières\r\n        having his brigade. W. Ponsonby, of 5th Dragoon Guards,\r\n        succeeded to Le Marchant’s brigade (by orders of July 23).\r\n        Cotton rejoined before October 15, but had to go home again\r\n        in December invalided. From August 1 V. Alten was absent, but\r\n        rejoined by the middle of September.\r\n\r\n        By Orders of October 17, 2nd Hussars, K.G.L., were transferred\r\n        to V. Alten’s brigade.\r\n\r\n    _1st Division._ Stopford resumed command of I B before February\r\n        1, but was gone again by April 8. On May 7 Wheatley was\r\n        appointed to command the brigade until Stopford’s return.\r\n\r\n        1/26th, being too sickly for field service, was out of I B\r\n        before March 8, being sent down to Lisbon, and thence to\r\n        Gibraltar to relieve 1/82nd. Their place in I B was taken by\r\n        1/42nd, just arrived from England and posted to I B April 23.\r\n        On May 19 2/42nd was ordered home, drafting its rank and file\r\n        into 1/42nd. 2/58th was posted to I B by Orders of April 2;\r\n        on June 1 its transfer to V B was ordered, but “orders will\r\n        hereafter be given as to the regiment joining the brigade.” It\r\n        seems to have remained with I B till after the retreat from\r\n        Burgos.\r\n\r\n        Graham going home ill July 6, H. Campbell was appointed to\r\n        command the division, Fermor getting I A.\r\n\r\n        Wheatley died September 1, Stirling (of 1/42nd) being appointed\r\n        to I B September 11.\r\n\r\n        On October 11 E. Paget was posted to command the division, but\r\n        he was taken prisoner November 17, his place being taken by W.\r\n        Stewart, who had just returned to the Peninsula.\r\n\r\n        After the retreat from Burgos the division was reorganized. A\r\n        new brigade of Guards was added, composed of 1/1st (Grenadier)\r\n        Guards, who arrived at Corunna from England October 1 and\r\n        joined the army on the Carrion October 24, and 3/1st Guards,\r\n        who had been at Cadiz, and came up to Madrid with Skerrett’s\r\n        column. This was ordered October 17, but cannot have been\r\n        carried out till later. On November 10 Howard was transferred\r\n        from II A to command this brigade. On November 11 Stirling’s\r\n        brigade was ordered to be removed to the 6th Division, the\r\n        company of 5/60th attached to it remaining in the 1st Division.\r\n        On December 6 the 1st and 2nd Light Battalions, K.G.L., were\r\n        removed from VII A to the K.G.L. brigade of the 1st Division.\r\n\r\n    _2nd Division._ In Orders of April 14, Tilson-Chowne (formerly\r\n        Tilson) was appointed to command the division, “under Hill,”\r\n        but though present at Almaraz in May does not seem to have been\r\n        present to the end of the year. Howard being transferred to the\r\n        1st Division, November 10, Cadogan (of 1/71st) took command of\r\n        II A.\r\n\r\n    _3rd Division._ At Ciudad Rodrigo Mackinnon was killed (January\r\n        19), his brigade going to Kempt—in Orders February 8.\r\n\r\n        At Badajoz Picton and Kempt were wounded (April 6), Wallace\r\n        taking over Kempt’s brigade, and also having temporary command\r\n        of the division when Picton was disabled: Forbes (of 1/45th)\r\n        then commanded III A.\r\n\r\n        After the fall of Badajoz 77th (a single battalion regiment)\r\n        was sent down to Lisbon, being much reduced.\r\n\r\n        On June 28 Pakenham was appointed to command “Colville’s\r\n        brigade in the 3rd Division,” _i.e._ III B. At Salamanca he\r\n        commanded the division, Picton having gone sick again, Wallace\r\n        and J. Campbell having the brigades.\r\n\r\n        1/5th, which arrived in May, was posted to III B June 1, both\r\n        battalions were at Salamanca, but on July 27 2/5th was drafted\r\n        into 1/5th, the skeleton going home in October.\r\n\r\n        By Orders of October 17 2/87th, which had come up from\r\n        Cadiz with Skerrett, was posted to III B, then still called\r\n        “Colville’s.”\r\n\r\n        Wallace was invalided home after the retreat from Burgos.\r\n\r\n        Pakenham was to retain command of the division till the return\r\n        of “Colville or some other” (_W. D._, v. 399), his name does\r\n        not appear in the States as commanding III B after November\r\n        1: Colville apparently came back before the end of the year:\r\n        _D. N. B._ says in October.\r\n\r\n        On April 8 Power took over the Portuguese brigade, Champlemond,\r\n        who had it _vice_ Palmeirim by March 17, having been wounded at\r\n        Badajoz: 12th Caçadores were added to it on April 8.\r\n\r\n    _4th Division._ On February 9, Bowes was appointed to command\r\n        “the brigade late under Pakenham,” _i.e._ IV B. In April\r\n        Colville was wounded at Badajoz, and the division was without a\r\n        G.O.C. till Cole returned—before July 8.\r\n\r\n        At Salamanca (July 22), Cole was wounded, and was absent in\r\n        consequence till October 15. In Cole’s absence W. Anson,\r\n        who was appointed to IV A April 9, would have commanded the\r\n        division. The vacancy in IV A was caused by the departure\r\n        of Kemmis—before April 1: at Badajoz Harcourt (of 1/40th)\r\n        commanded IV A.\r\n\r\n        Bowes was transferred to the 6th Division May 2, and it would\r\n        appear that Ellis (of 1/23rd) commanded IV B temporarily. He\r\n        certainly was in charge of it at Salamanca, and apparently kept\r\n        it till Skerrett took charge of it. It was then still described\r\n        as “Pakenham’s,” as was also the case as late as November 28.\r\n        Skerrett was appointed to it on October 17, but his force from\r\n        Cadiz only joined Hill on October 26, and the arrangements\r\n        ordered on October 17 can hardly have been carried out at once.\r\n\r\n        Skerrett’s brigade (3/1st Guards, 2/47th, 2/87th and 2\r\n        companies 2/95th) seems to have acted with IV after joining\r\n        Hill’s force, but was broken up when operations ceased.\r\n\r\n        Orders of October 17 directed 1/82nd, which had come up from\r\n        Gibraltar in June and was with the 4th Division at Madrid, to\r\n        join IV B, but the battalion was transferred to VII A by Orders\r\n        of November 28, the 20th which arrived in December being posted\r\n        to IV B instead. On 1/82nd joining, 1/48th was transferred to\r\n        IV A.\r\n\r\n        On December 6 the 2nd Provisional Battalion (_i.e._ 2nd and\r\n        1/53rd) was posted to IV A.\r\n\r\n        By Salamanca Stubbs had taken over command of the Portuguese\r\n        Brigade, which had been under Harvey by March 17 and at the\r\n        siege of Badajoz.\r\n\r\n    _5th Division._ At Badajoz Walker was wounded (April 6): his\r\n        brigade had no regular G.O.C. till Pringle was appointed to it\r\n        June 28.\r\n\r\n        On May 10 2/4th, arrived at Lisbon during April, was posted\r\n        to V B. In June 1/38th came out and was present at Salamanca,\r\n        apparently with V A, but it only appears as part of that\r\n        brigade in the “States” of August 8 and afterwards.\r\n\r\n        Orders of June 1 directed 2/58th to join V B, but the battalion\r\n        seems to have been with I B till reorganized as part of the 3rd\r\n        Provisional Battalion in December.\r\n\r\n        Hay was absent from June 8, Greville of 1/38th commanding the\r\n        brigade till July 31, when Hulse was transferred to it. Hulse\r\n        must have also commanded the division, as Leith was wounded\r\n        at Salamanca and invalided home. Hulse dying (September 6),\r\n        Pringle commanded the division, until Oswald was appointed to\r\n        it (October 25), when Pringle reverted to his brigade, of which\r\n        Brooke (of 4th) had been in command.\r\n\r\n        Orders of June 18 directed 1/9th to exchange with 2/30th and\r\n        2/44th, but these were cancelled June 28. E. Barnes was in\r\n        Orders to command V A October 28, but seems to have been with\r\n        the brigade at Villa Muriel three days earlier. On December\r\n        6 he was transferred to VII A. Hay appears to have returned\r\n        before December 31.\r\n\r\n        On December 6 Orders directed the drafting 2/4th into 1/4th\r\n        and 2/38th into 1/38th, the skeletons being sent home, also\r\n        for forming 2/30th and 2/44th into a Provisional Battalion,\r\n        the 4th. By Orders of October 17 2/47th of Skerrett’s column\r\n        had been posted to V B, which was then described as Walker’s\r\n        brigade.\r\n\r\n    _6th Division._ On February 9 H. Clinton was appointed to\r\n        command the division.\r\n\r\n        By April 1 VI B was without a brigadier: Bowes was appointed\r\n        to it May 2, but he was killed in the attack on the Salamanca\r\n        forts (June 24). On this Hinde, of 32nd, commanded the brigade,\r\n        being appointed definitely to it September 30, but ante-dated\r\n        to June.\r\n\r\n        On Hulse being transferred to V A, July 31, VI A was without a\r\n        brigadier, Bingham, of 2/53rd, being actually in command, until\r\n        the amalgamation of the two brigades by Orders of November\r\n        11. At the same time Stirling’s brigade was transferred from\r\n        the 1st Division to the 6th, 1/91st, which arrived at Corunna\r\n        October 8, being added to it by Orders of November 28—it\r\n        actually joined December 14.\r\n\r\n        On December 6 orders were issued for the formation of 2nd and\r\n        2/53rd as the 2nd Provisional Battalion, and of 2/24th, and\r\n        2/58th as the 3rd Provisional Battalion, and for their transfer\r\n        to IV A and VII A respectively.\r\n\r\n        The Portuguese Brigade was under Eben till April 30, when the\r\n        Conde de Rezende took command. It was joined by 9th Caçadores\r\n        on April 10. Rezende was invalided in November, and succeeded\r\n        by Madden.\r\n\r\n    _7th Division._ On May 2 Alten was transferred to command the\r\n        Light Division: John Hope being given command of the 7th.\r\n        Halkett of 2nd Light Battalion, K.G.L. seems to have commanded\r\n        VII A, though in the “States” no brigadier is named from May 2\r\n        till December 6, when E. Barnes was appointed to it.\r\n\r\n        Hope having to quit the army on account of his health September\r\n        23, the division had no G.O.C. till October 25, when Lord\r\n        Dalhousie was appointed to it, having been put on the Staff of\r\n        the Army September 12.\r\n\r\n        On November 28, 1/6th, newly arrived from England, was added to\r\n        VII A, then called “Colonel Halkett’s,” and 1/82nd, from IV B,\r\n        was added to VII B.\r\n\r\n        Orders of December 6 directed the transfer of the Light\r\n        Battalions, K.G.L., to the 1st Division, the 3rd Provisional\r\n        Battalion (_i.e._ 2/24th and 2/58th) being added to VII A.\r\n\r\n        The Portuguese Brigade was under Palmeirim in March: later it\r\n        seems to have been under Doyle of the 19th Line.\r\n\r\n    _Light Division._ At Ciudad Rodrigo (January 19), Craufurd was\r\n        killed, and Vandeleur wounded; Barnard then took command of the\r\n        division, and Gibbs of 1/52nd of the 2nd Brigade. By April 15\r\n        Vandeleur had resumed command, 2/52nd was drafted to 1/52nd by\r\n        Orders of February 23, the skeleton being sent home.\r\n\r\n        On May 2 C. Alten received command of the division.\r\n\r\n        By May 8 1/95th had been united in the 2nd Brigade, but Orders\r\n        of August 24 again divided it, 3 companies in each brigade:\r\n        before the end of the year it was again united and placed in\r\n        the 1st Brigade.\r\n\r\n        Two more companies 2/95th came out from England in May, and\r\n        joined those already out, the four being in the 2nd Brigade.\r\n        Two more came up from Cadiz with Skerrett, and joined the\r\n        brigade.\r\n\r\n        3/95th seems to have been transferred temporarily to the 2nd\r\n        Brigade, but was back in the 1st by the end of the year.\r\n\r\n        The 20th Portuguese, which had come up with Skerrett, were\r\n        posted to “Beckwith’s brigade,” October 17.\r\n\r\n    _Portuguese._ In April, 1812, Power had replaced Arch. Campbell\r\n        in command of the 4th Brigade, while Bradford had the 11th\r\n        _vice_ McMahon: this now included the 5th Caçadores, 13th and\r\n        24th Line.\r\n\r\n        By July Power had exchanged the 4th Brigade for the 8th, which\r\n        was in the 3rd Division. A. Campbell would seem to have again\r\n        commanded the 4th, to which on April 8 the 10th Caçadores were\r\n        added.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes in 1813]\r\n\r\n1813.\r\n\r\n  On January 1 the Army was organized as follows:--\r\n\r\n    _Cavalry._ 1st Division.

A [no brigadier present:\r\n        still called Beckwith’s], 1/43rd, 1/95th, 3/95th, 1st\r\n        Caçadores; B [Vandeleur], 1/52nd, 2/95th, 3rd Caçadores,? 20th\r\n        Portuguese.\r\n\r\n    _Portuguese._ Hamilton’s division, brigades under (?) Fonseca\r\n        and Campbell. Unattached brigades, Pack’s and Bradford’s.\r\n\r\n  Subsequent changes were:--\r\n\r\n    _Cavalry._ By January 25 a new brigade (H) was added, composed\r\n        of two squadrons each of 1st and 2nd Life Guards and Royal\r\n        Horse Guards, O’Loghlin had apparently been appointed to\r\n        command it, but by Orders of November 28, 1812, F. S. Rebow\r\n        was appointed to command it in his place. It ranked as 3rd\r\n        Brigade, 2nd Division, but was transferred to the 1st on\r\n        February 5. In March it was under Sir Robert Hill, Rebow having\r\n        gone home.\r\n\r\n        Orders of March 13 directed the distribution among the\r\n        regiments remaining in the Peninsula of the horses of 4th\r\n        Dragoon Guards, 9th and 11th Light Dragoons, and 2nd K.G.L.\r\n        Hussars, these regiments going home. Their place was taken by\r\n        a new brigade (I), under Colquhoun Grant, of 15th Hussars,\r\n        composed of the 10th, 15th and 18th Hussars: this first appears\r\n        in the “States” on April 15.\r\n\r\n        Orders were issued April 21 for the amalgamation of the two\r\n        divisions, “under the command of Sir S. Cotton”: Cotton did\r\n        not, however, rejoin till June 25, and in his absence Bock\r\n        seems to have commanded the cavalry, his brigade being under\r\n        Bülow.\r\n\r\n        On May 20 Fane, appointed a Major-General on the Staff April\r\n        24, was given B vice Slade, who had been ordered home April 23.\r\n\r\n        On July 2 orders were issued to transfer the 18th Hussars to V.\r\n        Alten’s brigade, vice the 14th Light Dragoons moved to Long’s,\r\n        which had been reduced to one regiment by the departure of\r\n        the 9th Light Dragoons (out of the “States” by April 4). Lord\r\n        E. Somerset at the same time was given command of the Hussar\r\n        brigade _vice_ Grant and Vandeleur, that of C _vice_ G. Anson,\r\n        removed to the Home Staff.\r\n\r\n        On September 6 Grant was appointed to take over Long’s\r\n        brigade, Long having apparently gone home before the battles\r\n        of the Pyrenees, as his name was not among the commanders of\r\n        Cavalry brigades thanked by Parliament on November 8 for those\r\n        operations. On November 24 Hussey Vivian was appointed to take\r\n        Grant’s place.\r\n\r\n        7th Hussars arrived in Spain in September, and were added to\r\n        the Hussar brigade. They would seem to have been with the\r\n        brigade by October 21, but were not in Orders till November 24.\r\n\r\n        In October O’Loghlin seems to have taken over the Household\r\n        Brigade, he had been placed on the Staff June 17.\r\n\r\n    _1st Division._ In March Howard replaced W. Stewart in command,\r\n        but on May 19 Graham was appointed to command the division\r\n        Howard acting as his assistant while Graham commanded the left\r\n        wing of the army. On October 8 Graham resigned command and went\r\n        home ill. Sir John Hope[351] took his place: he was placed on\r\n        the Staff October 10, as from September 25.\r\n\r\n        While Howard commanded the division his brigade was under\r\n        Lambert; it missed Vittoria, being too sickly to take the field\r\n        with the army and only joined in August.\r\n\r\n        On July 2 Lambert was transferred to VI B, and Maitland got the\r\n        brigade.\r\n\r\n        Löw went home May 6, the K.G.L. being certainly one brigade\r\n        only at Vittoria, where Halkett commanded them.\r\n\r\n        Lord Aylmer’s brigade (76th, 2/84th and 85th) which is first\r\n        mentioned in Orders on July 23, and joined the army during\r\n        August, may be reckoned as part of the 1st Division with which\r\n        it always acted. By Orders of October 17 2/62nd was added to it\r\n        vice 2/84th transferred to V B. On November 24 the 77th (from\r\n        Lisbon) was added to it.\r\n\r\n        On October 20 Hinüber was appointed to command the K.G.L.\r\n        infantry.\r\n\r\n    _2nd Division._ On March 25 W. Stewart was appointed to command\r\n        the division “under Hill’s direction.” At the same time G. T.\r\n        Walker got Howard’s brigade, on the latter taking over the 1st\r\n        Division from Stewart.\r\n\r\n        Wilson died in January and O’Callaghan of 39th commanded the\r\n        brigade till July 23, when Pringle was appointed to it. On May\r\n        1 Wellington had written that he was keeping it vacant for\r\n        Oswald, should Leith come out and take over the 5th Division.\r\n\r\n        At Vittoria Cadogan was killed and J. Cameron of 92nd took\r\n        over II A; he was wounded at Maya (July 25), and Fitzgerald of\r\n        5/60th commanded, till Walker actually joined in August. On\r\n        November 18 Walker was transferred to command the 7th Division,\r\n        Barnes being appointed to II A November 20.\r\n\r\n    _3rd Division._ Pakenham was transferred to the 6th Division\r\n        January 26, the division being under Colville who had returned\r\n        before that date. Picton rejoined in May, Colville reverting\r\n        to the command of his brigade. Picton was again absent from\r\n        September 8, but returned just before the end of the year.\r\n        Colville was in command at the Nivelle (November), but was\r\n        transferred to command the 5th Division, when Picton came back\r\n        in December.\r\n\r\n        The 11th Caçadores were posted to Power’s brigade before April\r\n        26, taking the place of the 12th.\r\n\r\n        Brisbane, appointed to Staff of Army January 7, was given\r\n        command of III A, _vice_ Kempt, March 25.\r\n\r\n        Colville being given temporary command of the 6th Division on\r\n        August 8, Keane commanded III B, as also when Colville came\r\n        back to the division.\r\n\r\n    _4th Division._ By Orders of July 2 Skerrett was transferred to\r\n        the Light Division, his brigade going to Ross of 20th.\r\n\r\n        By September 1 the Portuguese brigade was under Miller: at the\r\n        Nivelle (November 10) Vasconcellos had it.\r\n\r\n    _5th Division._ While Hay commanded the division Greville of\r\n        38th had his brigade. In April Oswald took over the division\r\n        and commanded it till Leith returned—August 30. Leith was\r\n        wounded at San Sebastian on September 1, and Oswald again took\r\n        command; but at the Bidassoa, (October 9) Hay was in command,\r\n        Greville having V A. On March 9 Robinson was appointed to\r\n        “Walker’s brigade,” _i.e._ V B.\r\n\r\n        On April 12 2/59th from Cadiz was added to V B; on May 10\r\n        the 4th Provisional Battalion was ordered to return home. On\r\n        October 17 2/84th from Lord Aylmer’s brigade was added to V B,\r\n        2/47th being transferred to V A. Robinson was wounded before\r\n        Bayonne December 10, and his successor, Piper of 4th, being\r\n        wounded next day the command passed to Tonson of 2/84th.\r\n\r\n        At the passage of the Bidassoa the Portuguese brigade was\r\n        commanded by de Regoa and until the end of the year.\r\n\r\n    _6th Division._ On January 26 Pakenham was appointed to command\r\n        the division in Clinton’s absence. On June 25 he was appointed\r\n        Adjutant-General, and Clinton returned and resumed command. By\r\n        July 22 Clinton was again absent, Pack getting the division.\r\n        At Sorauren (July 28) Pack was wounded, and Pakenham took over\r\n        the division temporarily, giving it over to Colville before\r\n        August 8, Colville seems to have still been in command at the\r\n        passage of the Bidassoa (October 9), but Clinton then returned,\r\n        Colville reverting to the 3rd Division.\r\n\r\n        Pack had been appointed to command VI A, _vice_ Stirling,\r\n        July 2, Lambert at the same time getting VI B, _vice_ Hinde.\r\n        Stirling commanded VI A when Pack got the division, but went\r\n        home in October.\r\n\r\n        The Portuguese brigade was under the command of Madden till the\r\n        autumn: Douglas of the 8th Line had it at the Nivelle.\r\n\r\n    _7th Division._ By April 16 de Bernewitz was no longer in\r\n        command of his brigade, to which Inglis was appointed May 21,\r\n        though at Vittoria Grant of 1/82nd commanded it, but Inglis\r\n        took charge before the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\n        Le Cor received command of the Portuguese brigade on March 9.\r\n        When he was promoted in November Doyle had it.\r\n\r\n        Dalhousie went home after the Bidassoa, October 9, and at the\r\n        Nivelle (November 9) Le Cor was in command. On November 18\r\n        G. T. Walker was given command “in Dalhousie’s absence.” Le Cor\r\n        would seem to have been transferred to command the Portuguese\r\n        division formerly under Hamilton.\r\n\r\n        On Barnes returning to the 2nd Division November 20, his\r\n        brigade seems to have gone to Gardiner.\r\n\r\n    _Light Division._ On March 23 Kempt was appointed to A. On July\r\n        2 Vandeleur was transferred to a cavalry brigade, Skerrett\r\n        getting B. At the passage of the Bidassoa and to the end of the\r\n        year Colborne of 52nd was in command of B, vice Skerrett, who\r\n        went home in September.\r\n\r\n        The 20th Portuguese never joined the division: in place of them\r\n        on April 26 the 17th Portuguese appear in its “State.”\r\n\r\n    _Portuguese._ Hamilton had had to give up command of his\r\n        Portuguese division in February, owing to ill-health, upon\r\n        which it was under Silveira, the brigades being under Da\r\n        Costa and Campbell during the battles of the Pyrenees. By\r\n        the passage of the Nivelle (November 9) Hamilton was again in\r\n        command, Buchan had Da Costa’s brigade, but during the fighting\r\n        on the Nive (December 9–11), Le Cor had the division and Buchan\r\n        and Da Costa the brigades. Buchan was ordered to transfer\r\n        himself to the Portuguese Brigade of the 7th Division on Nov.\r\n        9, but this move was countermanded.\r\n\r\n        When Pack was moved to a British command (July 2) his brigade\r\n        went to Wilson, who commanded it at the Bidassoa, but had been\r\n        replaced by A. Campbell by the Nive (December 9), Wilson having\r\n        been wounded November 18.\r\n\r\n        Bradford seems to have retained the other unattached brigade\r\n        all the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Organization on Jan. 1, 1814]\r\n\r\n1814.\r\n\r\n  On January 1 the organization was as follows:--\r\n\r\n    _Cavalry._ G.O.C., Cotton.

Unattached brigades under A. Campbell and\r\n        Bradford.\r\n\r\n  Subsequent changes were:--\r\n\r\n    _Cavalry._ By January 16 several changes had taken place: V.\r\n        Alten had gone and Vivian had been transferred to his brigade,\r\n        Fane having transferred from B to D (late Vivian’s). Bock also\r\n        went (he was drowned off the coast of Brittany in February)\r\n        about the same time.\r\n\r\n        From January 25 W. Ponsonby was absent, Lord C. Manners of 3rd\r\n        Dragoons commanding his brigade.\r\n\r\n        By March 25 Arentschildt (of 1st K.G.L. Hussars) had been\r\n        given Bock’s old brigade: on Vivian being wounded (April 8)\r\n        Arentschildt was transferred to E, and Bülow got the “German\r\n        Heavy Brigade.”\r\n\r\n        Fane’s name appears in the “States” both as commanding B and\r\n        D. According to the _Regimental History of the 14th Hussars_\r\n        (by Col. H. B. Hamilton) he commanded both, working them\r\n        practically as a division, the brigades being respectively\r\n        commanded by Clifton of the Royals (B), and Doherty of the 13th\r\n        Light Dragoons (D).\r\n\r\n    _1st Division._ 1/37th joined Aylmer’s brigade before March 25.\r\n        On April 14 Stopford was wounded at Bayonne and his division\r\n        went to Guise.\r\n\r\n    _2nd Division._ On February 15 Pringle was wounded and\r\n        O’Callaghan commanded the brigade.\r\n\r\n        It was arranged that when Lord Dalhousie rejoined, and resumed\r\n        command of the 7th Division, Walker should revert to II A and\r\n        Barnes take over III B, but Walker was wounded at Orthez and\r\n        went home, so the arrangement was never carried out.\r\n\r\n        By January 16 Harding had replaced Ashworth in command of the\r\n        5th Portuguese brigade.\r\n\r\n    _3rd Division._ No changes: Brisbane was slightly wounded at\r\n        Toulouse.\r\n\r\n    _4th Division._ Ross was wounded at Orthez (February 27) and\r\n        the brigade was without a G.O.C.\r\n\r\n    _5th Division._ After February 1 Robinson was absent. Hay was\r\n        killed before Bayonne April 14.\r\n\r\n    _6th Division._ Pack was wounded at Toulouse, as was also\r\n        Douglas.\r\n\r\n        1/32nd missed Toulouse, being at San Jean de Luz refitting.\r\n\r\n    _7th Division._ Walker was wounded at Orthez and went home:\r\n        Dalhousie arriving almost immediately after the battle and\r\n        resuming command.\r\n\r\n        By January 16, the Portuguese brigade was under Doyle (he may\r\n        have got it when Le Cor obtained command of the Portuguese\r\n        division.)\r\n\r\n    _Light Division._ 1/43rd and 1/95th both missed Orthez, being\r\n        away refitting.\r\n\r\n    _Portuguese._ Da Costa was ordered back to Portugal before\r\n        March 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III.\r\n\r\nPENINSULAR AUTOBIOGRAPHIES, JOURNALS, LETTERS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subjoined list, which includes all the printed autobiographies,\r\ndiaries, journals, and series of letters utilized in this volume, makes\r\nno pretensions to be exhaustive. It contains, however, all the more\r\nimportant original sources of this character, as opposed to formal\r\nhistories, controversial monographs, and biographies of Peninsular\r\nofficers written by authors who were not themselves engaged in the war.\r\nBut I have added to the list those later biographies which contain a\r\ngreat proportion of original and contemporary letters or diaries, such\r\nas Delavoye’s _Life of Lord Lynedoch_, Rait’s _Life of Lord Gough_,\r\nWrottesley’s _Life of Sir John Burgoyne_, and C. Vivian’s _Life of Lord\r\nVivian_. Much valuable first-hand information is imbedded in such works.\r\n\r\nThe books are arranged under headings according to the position which\r\nthe writer held in the Peninsular War, mainly by regiments, but partly\r\nunder departmental sections [staff, commissariat, medical, etc.]. I\r\ntrust that the list may be found useful for those wishing to compile\r\nregimental, brigade, or divisional annals of any part of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

London, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] John Shipp’s is the only book from the ranks which has been\r\nreprinted within the last ten years, I believe. Mr. Fitchett reproduced\r\na few chapters of Anton and others in his rather disappointing\r\n_Wellington’s Men_.\r\n\r\n[2] Kincaid, _Random Shots from a Rifleman_, p. 8.\r\n\r\n[3] This was Woodberry of the 18th Hussars.\r\n\r\n[4] _Sir William Gomm’s Life_, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[5] See his curious dispatch from Cartaxo dated February 6th, 1811,\r\nconcerning preaching officers.\r\n\r\n[6] He describes himself as “rolling on the floor like one distracted,\r\nwith the pains of hell getting hold, and hope seeming to be for ever\r\nshut out of my mind.”—_Surtees_, p. 172.\r\n\r\n[7] He calls his little book _Memoir of a Sergeant late of the 43rd\r\nLight Infantry, previously to and during the Peninsular War, including\r\nan account of his Conversion from Popery to the Protestant Religion_.\r\n\r\n[8] John Stevenson of the Scots Fusilier Guards.\r\n\r\n[9] _Life of Sir W. Napier_, i. 235, 236.\r\n\r\n[10] _Dispatches_, vii. p. 559.\r\n\r\n[11] _Ibid._ vi. p. 485.\r\n\r\n[12] This preposterous remark may be found on p. 28 of vol. vi.\r\n\r\n[13] Only printed in 1894.\r\n\r\n[14] Edited by Col. Willoughby Verner.\r\n\r\n[15] Published 1881. Invaluable as a private record for the staff.\r\n\r\n[16] Edited by his kinsman, the present Provost of Eton.\r\n\r\n[17] Larpent was a lawyer who acted as Wellington’s Judge Advocate.\r\n\r\n[18] It is hardly necessary to mention Jones’s slight Sketch (1818) or\r\nGoddard’s mass of undigested contemporary material (1814).\r\n\r\n[19] _Journal_ in Girod de l’Ain, p. 98.\r\n\r\n[20] His well-written two volumes (issued 1829) are said to have been\r\nvery largely the work of his aide-de-camp, St. Cyr-Nugues.\r\n\r\n[21] Vacani’s Italian general history of the war is very slight on the\r\nEnglish side, being mainly devoted to the doings of the Italians in\r\nCatalonia.\r\n\r\n[22] Published under the rather romantic title of _A Boy in the\r\nPeninsular War_ (which suggests a work of fiction), by Julian Corbett,\r\nin 1899.\r\n\r\n[23] Published in the _Revue Hispanique_ in 1907.\r\n\r\n[24] See p. 7.\r\n\r\n[25] Published 1831. A first-rate authority for Rifle Brigade and Light\r\nDivision matters.\r\n\r\n[26] Of the 29th Regt. Published only in 1887.\r\n\r\n[27] Published 1867.\r\n\r\n[28] Not to be confused with Sir _George_ Bell.\r\n\r\n[29] See for a dissection and disproof of this story Ropes’s\r\n_Waterloo_, pp. 238–242, 3rd edition. Mr. Horsburgh (p. 138) and\r\nothers accept the story. But despite Lady Shelley’s note it is really\r\nincredible.\r\n\r\n[30] For a dissection of Marbot’s blunders see the essay on his methods\r\nin Holland Rose’s _Pitt and Napoleon_, pp. 156–166.\r\n\r\n[31] Blakeney wrote about 1835, at Paxos in the Ionian Isles; Smith in\r\n1844, in India; Kincaid in 1847.\r\n\r\n[32] His extraordinarily vivid narrative of the fortunes of Browne’s\r\nprovisional battalion at Barrosa conflicts in detail with contemporary\r\nevidence which there is no reason to doubt, _e.g._ as to the numbers of\r\nthe battalion, and as to the exact behaviour of General Whittingham.\r\n\r\n[33] A strong case is that of the sergeant of the 43rd, mentioned\r\nabove, on p. 7, who lets in scraps of Napier into his patchwork with\r\nthe most unhappy effect.\r\n\r\n[34] But only published by Constable & Co. in 1828.

Cohorn’s column at\r\nEbersburg was not so deep, only a brigade. But it had to defile over a\r\nbridge 200 yards long.\r\n\r\n[73] _E.g._: this was the formation of the 3rd corps at Lützen, see\r\nFabry, _Journal des 3^{me} et 5^{me} Corps en 1813_, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[74] Foy’s _Vie Militaire_, ed. Girod de l’Ain, p. 107.\r\n\r\n[75] Habitually but not invariably: _e.g._ for a use of eight\r\nskirmishing companies from five battalions at Villamuriel in Oct.\r\n12, by Maucune, see Béchaud’s _Journal_, pp. 406–7, in _Études\r\nNapoléoniemes_ I.\r\n\r\n[76] Sir James Sinclair in his _Observations on the Military System of\r\nGreat Britain, so far as respects the formation of Infantry_, deals\r\nwith this idea at great length, and proposes to have 160 skirmishers to\r\neach battalion of 640 men.\r\n\r\n[77] See Fortescue, _British Army_, iv. p. 921.\r\n\r\n[78] See the anecdote of the 28th regiment at Alexandria, whose rear\r\nrank faced about, and fought back-to-back with the front rank, when\r\nunexpectedly assailed from behind by French cavalry which had passed\r\nthrough a gap in the line. Hence the grant of the double shako-plate,\r\nbefore and behind, made to the regiment.\r\n\r\n[79] Till lately I had supposed that Reynier had at least his left\r\nwing, or striking _échelon_, in columns of battalions, but evidence\r\nshown me by Col. James proves that, despite of the fact that the French\r\nnarratives do not show it, the majority at least of Reynier’s men were\r\ndeployed. This is borne out by Bunbury’s narrative, p. 244, where it is\r\ndefinitely stated, as well as by Boothby’s, p. 78.\r\n\r\n[80] Those of Reynier. See my _Peninsular War_, Bussaco chapter.\r\n\r\n[81] See Stanhope’s _Conversations with the Duke of Wellington_, p. 109.\r\n\r\n[82] The phrase comes from the _De Ros Manuscript_, quoted in Maxwell’s\r\n_Life of Wellington_, ii. p. 20.\r\n\r\n[83] Foy’s _Vie Militaire_, ed. Girod de l’Ain, pp. 270, 271.\r\n\r\n[84] Donkin’s Brigade, Wellington’s last reserve, which was never\r\nengaged with infantry all day, lost 195 men without firing a shot—save\r\nby its skirmishers.\r\n\r\n[85] See Fortescue, iv. p. 841.\r\n\r\n[86] The interesting circular to Brigadiers conveying this information\r\nruns, “The Commander of the Forces recommends the companies of the\r\n5/60th regiment to the particular care of the officers commanding\r\nthe brigades to which they are attached: they will find them to be\r\nmost useful, active, and brave troops in the field, and they will add\r\nessentially to the strength of their brigades.”—_General Orders_, p.\r\n262.\r\n\r\n[87] These “independent rifle companies” of the K.G.L., which appear\r\nin so many “morning states,” were isolated men left behind (mainly, no\r\ndoubt, in hospital) by the two “Light Battalions” of the K.G.L. when\r\nthey left Portugal in company with Sir John Moore.\r\n\r\n[88] To descend into detail, in May, 1811, the 5/60th supplied light\r\ncompanies to Stopford’s, Nightingale’s, Mackinnon’s (3 companies),\r\nMyers’, Hulse’s, Colborne’s, Hoghton’s, and Abercrombie’s brigades. The\r\nBrunswick Oels Jägers supplied the extra company to Hay’s and Dunlop’s\r\nbrigades, while the rest of the battalion was in Sontag’s brigade. The\r\n3/95th gave a company to Howard’s brigade, while the other battalions\r\nof this famous rifle corps were in the two brigades of the Light\r\nDivision. The German brigade of Löwe had its own “independent light\r\ncompanies.” Only Colville’s and Burne’s brigades had no such provision\r\nin the whole army.\r\n\r\n[89] Save in Hamilton’s Portuguese division, which did not get its\r\nCaçador battalions till 1812.\r\n\r\n[90] In 1811 of the armies opposed to Wellington (Soult’s and\r\nMarmont’s) there was one division of 6 battalions, one of 9, two of\r\n10, one of 11, seven of 12, one of 13. The battalions varied from 400\r\napiece in the 5th corps to over 600 in the 1st corps. The average was\r\nabout 500, not including men detached or in hospital. A _voltigeur_\r\ncompany would have varied between 80 and 110 men.\r\n\r\n[91] Note especially Vigo-Roussillon’s account of Barrosa, where he\r\nspeaks of his regiment having pierced the first British line, when\r\nall that it really did was to thrust back four companies of the 95th\r\nrifles, and two of the 20th Portuguese. Similarly Reynier’s report on\r\nBussaco says that Merle’s division broke the front line of Picton, and\r\nonly failed before his second. But the “front line” was only five light\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n[92] Wellington to Beresford, _Dispatches_, vii. p. 427.\r\n\r\n[93] If the _ordre mixte_ was formed by a regiment of three battalions\r\nof 600 men each, only 634 men out of 1800 were in the front two ranks.\r\nIf by a regiment of four battalions (two deployed, two in column in the\r\nflanks), the slightly better result of 1034 men out of 2400 able to use\r\ntheir muskets would be produced.\r\n\r\n[94] This I have from a document in the archives of the Ministry of War\r\nat Paris, which says that “the line of attack was formed by a brigade\r\nin column of attack. To its right and left the front line was in a\r\nmixed formation; that is to say, on each side of the central column\r\nwas a battalion deployed in line, and on each of the outer sides of\r\nthe deployed battalions was a battalion or regiment in column, so that\r\nat each end the line was composed of a column ready to form square, in\r\ncase hostile cavalry should attempt to fall upon one of our flanks.”\r\n\r\n[95] A phrase used by a French marshal at Bussaco!\r\n\r\n[96] Reprinted by General Trochu in his _Armée française en 1867_, pp.\r\n239, 240.\r\n\r\n[97] See page 87 above.\r\n\r\n[98] For details see below, in the chapter dealing with General Picton,\r\np. 134.\r\n\r\n[99] Though a few depleted regiments also went home, so that the total\r\nstrength never was over 18 regiments, 9000 horse or under, to 70,000\r\nmen in all.

This was\r\na vicious duplication of parallel organizations.\r\n\r\n[137] _General Order_, Freneda, Nov. 1, 1811.\r\n\r\n[138] _Private Journal of Judge-Advocate Larpent, 1812–14_, published\r\nLondon, 1853.\r\n\r\n[139] Names may suffice to show the class from which they were drawn:\r\nMarquis of Worcester, Lord March, Bathurst, Bouverie, Burghersh,\r\nCanning, Manners, Stanhope, Fremantle, Gordon, de Burgh, Cadogan,\r\nFitzroy Somerset.\r\n\r\n[140] See note on page 270 of chapter xvi on “Impedimenta.”\r\n\r\n[141] See _General Order_ of May 4, 1809.\r\n\r\n[142] Its most ambitious efforts were a small volume of maps printed at\r\nCambray, during the occupation of France after Waterloo, with notes by\r\nCol. Carmichael Smith, R.E., and the _General Orders_ for 1815, printed\r\nat Paris, by Sergeant Buchan, 3rd Guards, head printer to the Army of\r\nOccupation.\r\n\r\n[143] See, for example, York’s Alkmaar dispatch of Oct. 6, 1799.\r\n\r\n[144] _E.g._ in Walsh’s _Expedition to Holland_ in 1799, p. 22, the\r\nwhole original landing force of the British, 15,000 bayonets, is called\r\nthe “first division,” but only in contrast to the troops not yet\r\nlanded, not technically.\r\n\r\n[145] With the exception, of course, that the 1st and 3rd Caçador\r\nbattalions served all through the war in the two brigades of the Light\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n[146] See p. 83.\r\n\r\n[147] 1/43rd, 1/52nd, 1/95th.\r\n\r\n[148] 2/5th, 1/11th, 2/28th, 2/34th, 2/39th, 2/42nd, 2/58th. The 1/40th\r\nand 2/24th joined Wellington in time for Talavera.\r\n\r\n[149] The original British brigade of the 5th division consisted of the\r\n3/1st, 1/9th, and 2/38th.\r\n\r\n[150] The 2/30th and 2/44th, to which the 1/4th was subsequently added.\r\n\r\n[151] The name Army-Corps appears first in the Waterloo Campaign of\r\n1815.\r\n\r\n[152] The succession of brigadiers seems to have been, in the one\r\nbrigade, Pack followed by Wilson and Alex. Campbell; in the other\r\nBradford continued almost through the whole war, but McMahon was in\r\ncommand in part of 1811–12. After June, 1811, Ashworth’s Brigade was\r\nregularly attached to the 2nd division.\r\n\r\n[153] Now no longer wanted, as Leith had received his second British\r\nbrigade.\r\n\r\n[154] 2nd, 1/36th, and (added long months after) the 1/32nd.\r\n\r\n[155] 1/50th, 1/71st, and 1/92nd.\r\n\r\n[156] 51st, 85th, with the Chasseurs Britanniques and the Brunswick\r\nOels Jägers. The 68th joined in July, but the 85th went home in October.\r\n\r\n[157] 1st and 2nd Light Battalions, K.G.L., which landed very late,\r\njoined Beresford’s army in Estremadura, and only united with their\r\nproper division in June.\r\n\r\n[158] See notes on these battalions in the chapter on “The Auxiliaries.”\r\n\r\n[159] After Albuera their nickname was changed to “the Enthusiastics.”\r\n\r\n[160] This happened with the 5th, 28th, 38th, 39th, 42nd. The 2/4th and\r\n2/52nd came out for a short time, and then discharged their serviceable\r\nmen into their 1st battalion, and went home.\r\n\r\n[161] See p. 166.\r\n\r\n[162] These thirty-seven were the 2nd, 12th, 13th, 16th, 17th, 19th,\r\n20th, 22nd, 29th, 33rd, 37th, 41st, 46th, 49th, 51st, 54th, 55th, 64th,\r\n65th, 68th, 70th, 74th, 75th, 76th, 77th, 80th, 85th, 86th, 93rd, 94th,\r\nand 97th to 103rd.\r\n\r\n[163] Which were intended for home service only, and were called the\r\n“Army of Reserve.” But ere long they were utilized for general service.\r\n\r\n[164] The regiments which raised belated second battalions were the\r\n12th (in 1813), the 22nd (in 1814), the 37th (in 1811), the 41st (in\r\n1814), the 73rd (in 1809), the 86th (in 1814), the 93rd (in 1814). The\r\n95th (in 1809), and the 56th in 1813, raised a _third_ battalion.\r\n\r\n[165] For all the establishments see Table in Appendix I.\r\n\r\n[166] This was the case with the 7th, 48th, 52nd and 88th in 1811.\r\n\r\n[167] The 3rd Hussars, K.G.L., 2/14th, 2/23rd, 2/43rd, 2/81st, never\r\nreturned to serve under Wellington in 1809–14.\r\n\r\n[168] In 1810 the following returned to Portugal 3/1st, 1/4th, 1/9th,\r\n1/50th, 1/71st, 1/79th. In 1811 the following: 2nd, 1/26th, 1/28th,\r\n1/32nd, 1/36th, 51st, 2/52nd, 1st and 2nd Light K.G.L. In 1812 the\r\nfollowing: 1/5th, 1/6th, 20th, 1/38th, 1/42nd, 2/59th, 1/82nd, 1/91st.\r\nIn 1813 the 7th, 10th, 15th, 18th Hussars, the first and third\r\nbattalions of the 1st Foot Guards, and the 76th.\r\n\r\n[169] These were the 1/3rd, 2/9th, 29th, 1/40th, 1/45th, 5/60th, 97th,\r\nthe 1st, 2nd, 5th, 7th Line Battalions of the K.G.L., and the 20th\r\nLight Dragoons, the last-named incomplete.\r\n\r\n[170] The regiments which arrived with Wellesley, or before him, during\r\nthe spring and the preceding winter of 1808–1809, were 3/27th, 2/31st,\r\nand 14th Light Dragoons, during the winter; in April, 1st Coldstream\r\nGuards, 1st Scots Fusilier Guards, 2/7th, 2/30th, 2/48th, 2/53rd,\r\n2/66th, 2/83rd, 2/87th, 1/88th, 16th Light Dragoons, 3rd Dragoon\r\nGuards, 4th Dragoons.\r\n\r\n[171] Since April there had come out the 23rd Light Dragoons, 1st\r\nHussars, K.G.L., 1/61st, 1/48th, 2/24th; but the 20th Light Dragoons\r\nhad been deducted (sent to Sicily), while the 2/9th and 2/30th had been\r\nsent back to Lisbon, for passage to Gibraltar. The net gain, therefore,\r\nbetween April and July was only one cavalry regiment.\r\n\r\n[172] To recapitulate again. 1st battalions: 1/3rd, 1/40th, 1/45th,\r\n1/48th, 1/61st, 1/88th. 2nd battalions: 2/7th, 2/31st, 2/24th, 2/48th,\r\n2/53rd, 2/66th, 2/83rd, 2/87th. Other junior battalions: 3/27th (left\r\nat Lisbon), 5/60th. Single battalion regiments, 29th, 97th. There were\r\nalso two “Battalions of Detachments.”\r\n\r\n[173] The strongest battalions at Talavera were 1/3rd Foot Guards 1019,\r\n1st Coldstream 970, 1/48th 807; the weakest were 2/66th 526, 97th 502,\r\n2/83rd 535.\r\n\r\n[174] Viz. 2/7th, 2/48th.\r\n\r\n[175] 2/24th, 2/31st, 2/53rd, 2/66th. The first battalions of three of\r\nthese were in the East Indies, that of the fourth in Sicily.\r\n\r\n[176] 1/7th, 1/11th, 1/23rd, 1/37th, 1/39th, 1/57th.\r\n\r\n[177] 2/5th, 2/34th, 2/38th, 2/44th, 2/47th, 2/58th, 2/62nd, 2/84th.\r\n\r\n[178] 68th, 74th, 77th, 85th, 94th.\r\n\r\n[179] This was the case with the 2/62nd, 77th, 1/37th, 2/84th.\r\n\r\n[180] The sixth of the units of the provisional battalions being a\r\nsingle battalion corps, the 2nd Foot or Queen’s.\r\n\r\n[181] Typical figures are 77th, landed in July 859 of all ranks—had\r\nonly 560 present in September. The 68th, landed about the same time,\r\nhad 233 sick to 412 effective: the 51st, landed in April, 246 sick\r\nto 251 effective! But the 51st had lost men in the second siege of\r\nBadajoz. The other two regiments had not seen much service.\r\n\r\n[182] Over 14,000 men in October, 1811.\r\n\r\n[183] Wellington wrote to the Secretary of War (Lord Bathurst), “I\r\nassure you that some of the best battalions with the army are the\r\nprovisional battalions. I have lately seen two of these engaged, that\r\nformed of the 2/24th and 2/58th, and that formed from the 2nd Queen’s\r\nand 2/53rd: it is impossible for any troops to behave better. The same\r\narrangement could now be applied with great advantage to the 51st and\r\n68th, and also to other regiments” (_Dispatches_, x. p. 629). There was\r\nanother “provisional battalion” composed of the 2/30th and 2/44th for a\r\nshort time in 1812–13.\r\n\r\n[184] Probably a year later Wellington would not have allowed the 29th\r\nand 97th, both old single battalion regiments sent home after Albuera,\r\nto depart, but would have worked them together as a “provisional\r\nbattalion.” He expresses great regret in his private correspondence at\r\nlosing two excellent units because they had fallen to about 250 men\r\neach.\r\n\r\n[185] After Albuera, where they both suffered heavily, the 2nd was sent\r\nhome, discharging its serviceable men into the 1st, which was the first\r\nconnection with the sister-battalion that it had.\r\n\r\n[186] Such figures are, however, occasionally found, _e.g._ the 1/4th\r\nat Bussaco, and the 1/43rd in September, 1811, had over 1000 of all\r\nranks. So had the 1/42nd at Salamanca.\r\n\r\n[187] These chanced to be the 1/43rd and the 2/38th respectively. The\r\ntwo Guards battalions were each just under 900 of all ranks at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[188] 3rd Dragoon Guards, 1st and 4th Dragoons, 14th and 16th Light\r\nDragoons, 1st Hussars, K.G.L.\r\n\r\n[189] 13th Light Dragoons.\r\n\r\n[190] 3rd, 4th, 5th Dragoon Guards; 1st, 3rd, and 4th Dragoons;\r\n9th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 16th Light Dragoons; 1st and 2nd Heavy\r\nDragoons, K.G.L.; 1st and 2nd Hussars, K.G.L.\r\n\r\n[191] Tomkinson in his diary observes (p. 230) that the 11th Light\r\nDragoons was not in such bad state as the other condemned regiments,\r\nbut that their colonel was so senior that he stood in the way of the\r\npromotion of several more capable officers to command brigades—hence\r\nWellington resolved to get him out of the country.\r\n\r\n[192] _Dispatches_, vii. p. 58. To Lord Liverpool.\r\n\r\n[193] 9th and 11th Light Dragoons, 4th Dragoon Guards, 2nd Hussars,\r\nK.G.L.\r\n\r\n[194] Viz. the 1st Royals, 13th, 14th, and 16th Light Dragoons, and 1st\r\nHussars, K.G.L. See _General Orders_, October 2, 1811.\r\n\r\n[195] In the Talavera army, taking the general totals, there were 536\r\nlieutenants to 259 ensigns; in the Bussaco army 624 to 237; in the 1811\r\narmy (March) 739 to 323—in each case more than two to one.\r\n\r\n[196] Viz. killed, the Brigadier-Gen. Hoghton and one major, wounded\r\ntwo lieutenant-colonels and two majors.\r\n\r\n[197] Picton, though wounded in the foot at Badajoz, rode with his\r\ndivision for some time after it marched from Estremadura for the North,\r\nbut the wound getting inflamed he was compelled to go into hospital,\r\nand Wallace had his place for some weeks in June, Pakenham appearing as\r\ndivisional commander in July.\r\n\r\n[198] See the bitter remarks on pp. 367–369 on Blakeney’s\r\nAutobiography. For a number of illustrative anecdotes see Leach’s\r\ncurious little book, _Rambles on the Banks of Styx_, which is full of\r\nPeninsular grievances.\r\n\r\n[199] The allusion is to the obscure business of influence in\r\ndistributing commissions said to have been used by the Duke of York’s\r\nmistress, Mrs. Mary Ann Clarke.\r\n\r\n[200] For more of this pamphlet, see Stocqueler’s _Personal History of\r\nthe Horse Guards_, pp. 60–67.\r\n\r\n[201] For an astounding story of an ensign who had been a\r\nbilliard-marker in Dublin, and who was ultimately cashiered for theft,\r\nsee Col.

The former prosecuted the senior major for embezzlement,\r\nwhile at the same moment a subaltern was “broke” for alleging that the\r\njunior major had shown cowardice in the field. The Horse Guards finally\r\ndispersed all the officers into different corps, as the only way of\r\nending the feud.\r\n\r\n[206] See pp. 121–2 of vol. ii. of Robinson’s _Life of Picton_.\r\n\r\n[207] Letter printed in _Vie Militaire_, _ed._ Girod de l’Ain, p. 98.\r\n\r\n[208] See the heading “Lisbon” in the collected volume of _General\r\nOrders_, pp. 206, 207.\r\n\r\n[209] _General Orders_, Freneda, December 4, 1811.

If these inducements were not effectual in getting men,\r\ncoercive measures were adopted: the militia colonel would put on\r\nheavy and long drills and field exercises, which were so tedious and\r\noppressive that many men would embrace the alternative, and volunteer\r\nfor the regulars” (p. 13).\r\n\r\n[218] A canny Scot makes his explanation for volunteering in a fashion\r\nwhich combines patriotism, love of adventure, and calculation. “In the\r\nmilitia I serve secure of life and limb, but with no prospect of future\r\nbenefit for old age (pension) to which I may attain. It is better to\r\nhazard both abroad in the regular service, than to have poverty and\r\nhard-labour accompanying me to a peaceful grave at home.” Anton’s\r\n_Retrospect of a Military Life_, p. 39.\r\n\r\n[219] See the amusing narrative of Lawrence of the 20th and his two\r\nevasions from his stone-mason employer.\r\n\r\n[220] See Stanhope’s _Conversations with Wellington_, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[221] Journal of T. S. of the 71st in Constable’s _Memorials of the\r\nLate War_, i. p. 25.\r\n\r\n[222] Note by Colborne on p. 396 of his _Life_ by Moore-Smith.\r\n\r\n[223] _Rifleman Harris_, pp. 10–16.\r\n\r\n[224] In the Court-Martials on privates printed in _General Orders_,\r\nout of 280 trials I make out 80 certainly Irish names, and a good many\r\nmore probably Irish—while there are only 23 Scots. There were certainly\r\nnot four times as many Irish as Scots in the Peninsular Army, though\r\nthere were more than twice as many.\r\n\r\n[225] See also Stanhope’s _Conversations with Wellington_, p. 6.\r\n\r\n[226] _Twenty-five Years in the Rifle Brigade_, pp. 47, 48.\r\n\r\n[227] Both court-martialled, of course: see _General Orders_, vol. vii.\r\n\r\n[228] This incident occurs in the unprinted letters of F. Monro, R.A.,\r\nlent to me by his kinsfolk of to-day.\r\n\r\n[229] One of the Duke’s acrid generalizations on this point was “the\r\nnon-commissioned officers of the Guards regularly got drunk once a day,\r\nby eight in the evening, and got to bed soon after—but they always took\r\ncare to do first what they were bid.”—Stanhope’s _Conversations with\r\nthe Duke of Wellington_, p. 18.\r\n\r\n[230] See Anton’s (42nd, Black Watch) _Retrospect of a Military Life_,\r\npp. 239, 240.\r\n\r\n[231] _Retrospect of a Military Life_, pp. 57, 58.\r\n\r\n[232] _Memoirs of Sergeant Morley, 5th Foot_, p. 101.\r\n\r\n[233] The survivors in 1809 were the regiments of de Meuron, Rolle,\r\nDillon, and de Watteville.\r\n\r\n[234] This proviso was neither submitted to nor approved by the British\r\nGovernment, who refused to take notice of it. Napoleon, during many\r\ndisputes as to the exchange of prisoners in later years, always found\r\na good excuse for breaking off negociations in the fact that he held\r\nthat 4000 or 5000 Hanoverians of the K.G.L. should be reckoned as men\r\nrequiring exchange.\r\n\r\n[235] I note among the deserters from the German Legion in 1812–14 the\r\nstrange and non-Teutonic names of Gormowsky, Melofsky, Schilinsky,\r\nWutgok, Prochinsky, Borofsky, Ferdinando, Panderan, Kowalzuch,\r\nMatteivich, etc.\r\n\r\n[236] The other two names are one Swiss the other Croatian.\r\n\r\n[237] Names such as Davy, Woodgate, Galiffe, Andrews, McKenzie, Holmes,\r\nLinstow, Wynne, Joyce, Gilbert are unmistakably British. See Colonel\r\nRigaud’s _History of the 5/60th_, Appendix i.\r\n\r\n[238] See p. 120.\r\n\r\n[239] See pp. 168–9.\r\n\r\n[240] This corps only raised its second battalion in 1811.\r\n\r\n[241] Algarve, Nos. 2 (Lagos) and 14 (Tavira).

And under the orders of Sir John Cradock, which\r\nhave been the rule for this army, the subalterns were allowed a horse\r\nor mule between them” (_General Orders_, p. 122).\r\n\r\n[273] I find, _e.g._, in diaries, that 2nd Lieut. Hough, R.A., got “two\r\ndomestics, a country horse, and a mule” immediately on landing. Geo.\r\nSimmons and Harry Smith of the 95th were certainly habitually riding\r\nwhen only lieutenants. So was Grattan of the 88th. Bell of the 34th\r\nbeing impecunious had “only half a _burro_ along with another lad.”\r\nBunbury of the Buffs had half a horse and half a mule in conjunction\r\nwith another subaltern. Hay of the 52nd was just in the regulation with\r\none mule to himself, on his first campaign, but bought a Portuguese\r\nmare before he had been a year in the field.\r\n\r\n[274] From that amusing piece of doggerel (strictly contemporary) _The\r\nMilitary Adventures of Johnny Newcome_.\r\n\r\n[275] Notes to _Johnny Newcome_, p. 30.\r\n\r\n[276] Grattan of the 88th, selling his horse on leaving the Peninsula\r\nat the Lisbon Horse-Fair, says that he got 125 dollars for it,\r\nequalling at the then rate of exchange £31 5_s._ Boothby, R.E., buying\r\na red English stallion, considers himself very lucky to get it for 30\r\nguineas. A donkey fetched about 15 dollars only.\r\n\r\n[277] There are several court-martials on officers who (disregarding\r\nthis order) kept a soldier-servant or bâtman out of the ranks.\r\n\r\n[278] One officer relates that he came upon his own mule-boy, aged ten\r\nor twelve, deliberately beating out the brains of a wounded Frenchman,\r\nat Salamanca, with a large stone. Another diarist speaks of making\r\na wounded Frenchman comfortable while he went for a surgeon, and\r\nreturning to find him stabbed and stripped. A third (F. Monro, R.A.)\r\nsays, “I found myself among the dead and dying, to the shame of human\r\nnature be it said, _both_ stripped, some half-naked, some wholly so,\r\nand this done principally by those infernal devils in mortal shape,\r\nthe cruel, cowardly Portuguese followers, unfeeling ruffians. The\r\nPortuguese pillaged and plundered _our own wounded officers_ before\r\nthey were dead!”\r\n\r\n[279] See Ross Lewin’s _With the 32nd in the Peninsular War_, p. 205.\r\n\r\n[280] Sergeant Anton’s _Retrospect of a Military Life_, pp. 60, 61.\r\n\r\n[281] _Rough Notes of an Old Soldier_, vol. i. pp. 74, 75.\r\n\r\n[282] Wellington (General Order of April 26, 1814) makes the concession\r\nthat colonels may permit “a few who have proved themselves useful and\r\nregular,” to accompany the soldiers to whom they are attached “with a\r\nview to being ultimately married.”\r\n\r\n[283] For details see Donaldson’s _Eventful Life of a Soldier_, pp.\r\n231, 232.\r\n\r\n[284] _History of the Peninsular War_, vol. iv. p. 276.

His hair\r\nwas cropped close. I have heard him say that hair powder was very\r\nprejudicial to the health, as impeding perspiration, and he was no\r\ndoubt right.”\r\n\r\n[301] See for example the description of the 43rd preparing to storm\r\nRodrigo, in Grattan, p. 145.\r\n\r\n[302] _Military Journal of Col.

It was\r\nnot unlike, however, the hat of the Marines. For illustration of it see\r\nthe plates in Connolly’s _History of the Royal Sappers and Miners_,\r\nvol. i.\r\n\r\n[308] There are plenty of stories about him in Grattan’s _With the\r\nConnaught Rangers_. This one, however, is from Bell’s _Rough Notes_, i.\r\n95.\r\n\r\n[309] See the letter in General Rigaud’s _History of the 5/60th_.\r\n\r\n[310] See illustration in Plate 8 of a sergeant and private in winter\r\nmarching order.\r\n\r\n[311] There is a curious anecdote in the diary (p. 28) of Cooper of\r\nthe 1/7th, of a sergeant, who, running with the point of his pike low,\r\ncaught it in the ground, and fell forward on its butt-end, which went\r\nright through his body.\r\n\r\n[312] _E.g._ there is a Waterloo story of a sergeant of the 18th\r\nHussars, who long engaged with a cuirassier, and unable to get at him\r\nbecause of his armour and helm, ultimately killed him with a thrust in\r\nthe mouth. I should not like to take it as certain.\r\n\r\n[313] For ample details about them see Mr. Milne’s _Standards and\r\nColours of the Army_, Leeds, 1893.\r\n\r\n[314] _Autobiography of Sergt.

spelling were made consistent when a\r\npredominant preference was found in this book.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced quotation marks\r\nwere corrected when the change was obvious.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.\r\n\r\nThe index was not systematically checked for proper alphabetization or\r\ncorrect page references.\r\n\r\nSidenotes in this eBook contain the text of running headers in the\r\noriginal book. They have been placed between paragraphs that were\r\nnear those headers. Like the original headers, the sidenotes are not\r\nnecessarily at the beginnings of the topics to which they refer.\r\n\r\nPage 193: “lost so many men as the 2nd” was misprinted with a gap where\r\nthe word “as” should have been; corrected here.\r\n\r\nPage 252: “to two of three” was printed that way.\r\n\r\nPage 295: Transcriber added a missing closing quotation mark after “if\r\nwe fancied it.” The correct position may be later in the paragraph.\r\n\r\nTables on pages 333, 340 and 341: Asterisks in these tables are not\r\nreferences to footnotes; their purpose is explained on page 333: “The\r\nstar * affixed to a battalion’s station means that it had just returned\r\nfrom Sir John Moore’s Corunna Campaign.”\r\n\r\nPage 339: “only two (2/5th 2/34th, 2/38th)” was printed that way, with\r\n“two” and no comma after the first number.\r\n\r\nFootnote 344, originally on page 338: “97th, 90th, 101st, 102nd”\r\nprobably includes a misprint, as “90th” is out of sequence and already\r\nwas mentioned in Footnote 341.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Wellington's Army 1809-1814, by Charles Oman",
