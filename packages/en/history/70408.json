It scattered thousands of Frenchmen over Europe, some in fact as\r\nfar as America and India, while, on the other hand, it attracted men of\r\nall nationalities to France. It was mainly a centrifugal, but it was\r\npartly a centripetal force, especially during the Empire; never before\r\nor since was France so much as then the focus of political and social\r\nlife. Men of all ranks shared in both these movements. If princes and\r\nnobles were driven from France there were some who were attracted\r\nthither even in the early stages of the Revolution, while Napoleon\r\nlater on drew around him a galaxy of foreign satellites.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the centrifugal action, history furnishes no parallel to\r\nsuch an overturn of thrones and flight of monarchs. With the exception\r\nof England, protected by the sea, Scandinavia and Russia by distance,\r\nand Turkey by Oriental lethargy, every dynasty of Europe was shaken or\r\nshattered by the volcano. The Bourbons became wanderers on the face of\r\nthe earth. Louis XVI.’s two brothers went hither and thither\r\nbefore finding a secure resting-place on British soil. The elder,\r\n‘Monsieur,’ Comte de Provence (afterwards Louis XVIII.),\r\nfled from Paris simultaneously with his crowned brother, but, more\r\nfortunate than poor Louis, safely reached Belgium. The younger, Comte\r\nd’Artois (afterwards Charles X.), had preceded him by nine\r\nmonths. Both re-entered France in 1792 with the German and Royalist\r\ninvaders, but had soon to retreat with them. Monsieur betook himself\r\nfirst to Ham in Westphalia, and next to Verona, but the Doge of Venice,\r\nfearful of displeasing revolutionary France, ‘invited’ him to withdraw.\r\nRussian hospitality likewise proved ephemeral, but in England, first\r\nat Gosfield, then at Wanstead, and lastly at Hartwell, he was able\r\nquietly to await the downfall of the Corsican usurper. D’Artois found\r\nhalting-places at Venice, Mantua, Brussels, and St. Petersburg, and for\r\na few days he was a second time on French soil in the island of Yeu;\r\nbut the failure of the expedition to western France soon obliged him\r\nto recross the Channel, where Holyrood and eventually London afforded\r\nhim a refuge. Of the jealousies of these two exiled princes, and of\r\nthe mortifications and dissensions of their retinues, it is needless\r\nto speak. The Duke of Orleans (the future Louis Philippe), deserting\r\nthe Republican army along with Dumouriez, after teaching in a school\r\nin Switzerland, and after a visit to America, where he spent a night\r\nin an Indian wigwam, also repaired to England. There he was doomed to\r\nlong years of inactivity, though he would fain have joined the English\r\nforces in Spain, in which case, as having fought against France, he\r\ncould scarcely have grasped the French crown. The Duc de Bourbon\r\nlikewise settled in England, and it would have been well had his\r\nunfortunate son, the Duc d’Enghien, followed his example. The king’s\r\ntwo aunts, one of them the reputed mother of the Comte de Narbonne,\r\nhimself escorting them and destined to ten years of exile, found their\r\nway to Rome, but driven thence by the French, after many buffetings\r\nthey ended their wanderings and their lives at Trieste.\r\n\r\nThese banished French princes had the doubtful consolation of seeing\r\nother regal or princely personages equally storm-tost. The Statthalter\r\nof Holland had to pass many years of banishment in England, and\r\neven stooped to soliciting a pecuniary indemnity from Napoleon. The\r\nAustrian and Prussian monarchs, though not actually driven out of\r\ntheir dominions, saw their capitals occupied by French armies, and had\r\nto bow to the stern dictates of the Conqueror. The rulers of German\r\nprincipalities were swept away by the hurricane. The Spanish royal\r\nfamily were consigned to the custody of Talleyrand at Valençay. The\r\nPortuguese princes took refuge in Brazil. Italian monarchs fared no\r\nbetter. The sovereigns of Piedmont had to retire to the island of\r\nSardinia, the only possession remaining to them. The King of Naples\r\nwas likewise driven from his continental dominions, British protection\r\nensuring him a footing in Sicily. Italian dukes were rudely supplanted\r\nby Napoleon’s relatives or other puppets. Ferdinand III. of\r\nTuscany was driven to Vienna, though subsequently assigned a duchy\r\nin Germany. Even the Papacy, which had long been unscathed by war or\r\nrevolution, was overwhelmed by the current. Forced away from Rome, one\r\nPope died in the French fortress of Valence, while another became a\r\nprisoner at Savona.\r\n\r\nIn France not merely the princes, but almost the entire nobility, were\r\nfugitives. England, Germany, Switzerland, and Russia were inundated\r\nwith aristocrats, who at first, counting on a speedy and triumphant\r\nreturn, formed little colonies, in one of which Fanny Burney found a\r\nhusband; but the exhaustion of their resources soon scattered them\r\nhither and thither. Some were descendants of Jacobite refugees, who\r\nfound shelter in the very country whence their ancestors had fled.\r\nAdversity, in this as in other cases, brought out the best qualities\r\nof some and the worst of others. Frivolity and gravity, self-denial\r\nand selfishness, heroism and poltroonery, intrigue and probity, honour\r\nand unscrupulousness, existed side by side. Some formed royalist corps\r\nsubsidised by foreign governments, or actually joined foreign armies,\r\npersuading themselves that they were thus fighting not against France\r\nbut against a usurpation. The few who went to America, whether from\r\nchoice, like the epicure Brillat Savarin, or from compulsion like\r\nTalleyrand, were spared this sad necessity of accepting foreign alms\r\nor serving foreign states. The Comte d’Estaing took office under an\r\nIndian rajah. Reduced to penury, those who remained in the Old World\r\nresorted to every conceivable expedient. The women were naturally the\r\ngreatest sufferers. Delicate fingers which had never done a stroke of\r\nwork had to busy themselves in dressing dolls, in embroidery, in flower\r\nor portrait painting, in nursing the sick, and even in milking cows\r\nand making butter for sale. Men brought up in luxury deemed themselves\r\nfortunate if they could earn a livelihood as journalists, translators,\r\nor teachers. More frequently they had to become book-keepers or\r\ntailors, to keep wine shops, to sing at music-halls, to act as\r\nprompters at theatres, and even to be water-carriers. Some, alas! with\r\nthe connivance at least for a time of their princes, forged assignats.\r\nWelcomed in some quarters, mobbed or even expelled as vagabonds in\r\nothers, they had to exchange palaces for cottages, sumptuous diet\r\nfor the roughest fare, jewels and finery for rags. No wonder that\r\nhumiliation and anguish drove some to suicide, and the lives of many\r\nothers must have been shortened by privations. Yet many, with the\r\ntraditional light-heartedness of Frenchmen,\r\n\r\n    ‘Laughed the sense of misery away.’\r\n\r\nBesides the _noblesse_, which included the episcopate, there were\r\nthousands of priests and hundreds of nuns, who, fleeing from relentless\r\npersecution, found succour from Protestant governments and Protestant\r\nphilanthropy. There were also ex-deputies and publicists, whom the\r\ndungeon, and probably the guillotine, would otherwise have claimed.\r\nLally Tollendal, the younger Mirabeau, Mounier, and Montlosier, had\r\nsat in the National or Constituent Assembly. Mallet du Pan, Etienne\r\nDumont, Antraigues, driven to suicide, Lafayette, consigned to an\r\nAustrian fortress, and Dumouriez, offering military counsels to the\r\nEnglish, may also be mentioned. It need hardly be said that wealthy\r\nforeigners like Quintin Craufurd, who had become numerous in Paris\r\nbefore the Revolution, were frightened away, leaving their property to\r\nbe confiscated, for the Jacobins did not even recognise their right to\r\nquit France, which had become not merely inhospitable but dangerous.\r\nNot until the Consulate and the Empire did France again attract wealthy\r\nforeigners, or recover a portion of its then much impoverished nobility.\r\n\r\nAs for the immigration, though far less important in numbers and\r\nquality, it was not inconsiderable. Men of all nationalities hurried\r\nto Paris between 1789 and 1792 to see or serve the Revolution. There\r\nwere English men and women like Paine (or shall we reckon him an\r\nAmerican?), George Grieve, General Money, Thomas Christie, John Oswald,\r\nHelen Williams, and Mary Wollstonecraft. There were Americans like\r\nBarlow, Eustace, Paul Jones, and Joshua Barney; Germans like Cloots,\r\nTrenck, and George Forster; Belgians and Dutchmen like de Kock, father\r\nof the novelist, and Proly, a natural son of the Austrian statesman\r\nKaunitz; Poles like Wittinghoff; Russians like Strogonoff; Italians\r\nlike Rotondo, Cerutti, and Buonarotti; Spaniards like Olavide and\r\nMiranda. Most of these men embraced the cause of the Revolution as a\r\nreligion, and were quite ready to fight in its behalf, in defence as\r\nthey imagined of liberty and enlightenment, even against their native\r\ncountries. Some of them paid the penalty of their enthusiasm by the\r\ndungeon or the guillotine. It is true that when Napoleon seized the\r\nreins such illusions could scarcely have remained, but even then there\r\nwere numerous foreigners eager to serve him for the sake of lucre or\r\nadventure, not to speak of Irish refugees and Poles, whom he lured by\r\nthe expectation of achieving their independence. Prince Leopold of\r\nSaxe-Coburg, little foreseeing his marriage with our Princess Charlotte\r\nor his elevation to the crown of Belgium, was anxious to become one of\r\nhis aides-de-camp. Some men fought by turns for and against him. The\r\nRevolution indeed, though it ended by making Europe nationalist, made\r\nit for a time cosmopolitan. Napoleon did much, moreover, to eradicate\r\npatriotism, especially in the military class. Hence Bernadotte was not\r\nthe only soldier who changed sides from personal pique or according\r\nto the prospects of victory, and he did not even imagine that by his\r\nappearance as an invader he would disqualify himself for supplanting\r\nNapoleon on the French throne. Jomini, a Swiss, after serving Napoleon\r\nin high rank, offered his sword to Russia, though Napoleon was\r\ncompelled to acquit him of having treacherously revealed his military\r\nsecrets. And Talleyrand, while accepting Napoleon’s pay, intrigued\r\nwith his foes, doubtless salving his conscience, if indeed he had a\r\nconscience, with the notion that he was thus promoting the interests of\r\nFrance. Few men were so scrupulous as the Duc de Richelieu, a future\r\nFrench statesman, in stipulating that Russia should not send him to\r\nfight against his countrymen. As to the rank and file, they had of\r\ncourse no choice. Belgians, Dutchmen, Germans, Poles, Italians, had to\r\njoin or combat French armies according to the political exigencies of\r\nthe moment or the periphery of French rule. Napoleon’s armies were thus\r\na medley of nationalities, and the only wonder is that defections so\r\nrarely occurred.\r\n\r\nSuch was the France, such the Europe, to which this book relates. It\r\nis a chapter in the history both of England and of Napoleon. We first\r\nsee Englishmen pouring over to Paris during the interlude or truce\r\nof Amiens, to make or renew acquaintance with it after ten years\r\nof hostilities, or to recover confiscated property. Peers, M.P.’s,\r\nsoldiers and sailors, philosophers, scholars, merchants, were all eager\r\nto see the young Corsican who had already accomplished so much and was\r\nevidently marked out to accomplish much more. We next see hundreds of\r\nthese non-combatants detained for eleven years on the paltry pretext\r\nof their being liable to militia service at home, and in defiance of\r\nall international courtesies. We see some of them not merely shifted\r\nfrom place to place, now permitted to reside in Paris, now relegated to\r\nprovincial towns, but actually incarcerated in fortresses. We find the\r\nBritish Government standing on principle, and declining to exchange the\r\nthousands of French captives for these unfortunates, though there were\r\nnot wanting men who urged on it the expediency of stooping to deal with\r\nNapoleon as with a mountain brigand or a barbarous chief, especially\r\nas he was arbitrarily imprisoning without trial Frenchmen whom he\r\nsuspected or feared. We meet with cases of crying heartlessness among\r\nthese detentions, relieved only by a very rare gleam of humanity or\r\nmagnanimity. We then see the sudden collapse of this gigantic tyranny\r\nand the liberation, as from an immense aviary suddenly thrown open,\r\nof grey-headed and despondent captives. This flight of caged birds is\r\nquickly followed by, we might almost say is coincident with, an influx\r\nof fresh visitors, mostly so unmindful of the past as to take for\r\ngranted the stability of the restored monarchy. We see a few tourists\r\nrepairing to Elba to get a glimpse of the dethroned Emperor, one or\r\ntwo of them sagacious enough to forebode that reappearance on French\r\nsoil which was to scare away nearly all their countrymen. The curtain\r\nfalls on the Hundred Days, but it is just raised to show us Napoleon\r\npathetically trying with little success at St. Helena to master the\r\nlanguage of his jailers.\r\n\r\nThe centenary of the Peace of Amiens seemed a suitable occasion for\r\nwriting, not a political history of that truce, for on this there is\r\nnothing new to be said, but an account of its social aspects, of the\r\nvisits paid to Paris by Englishmen, which had never before been so\r\nnumerous, of the impression made on each other by guests and hosts,\r\nand of the experiences of those who on the resumption of hostilities\r\nfound themselves detained as prisoners. French writers have shown how\r\nNapoleon treated his own subjects; it completes the picture of him to\r\nsee how he treated Englishmen, who never, except his guardians at St.\r\nHelena when jailer had become prisoner, came into such close relations\r\nwith him. I may fairly claim to have broken new ground. It is true that\r\nI gave two brief chapters on this subject in 1889 in my _Englishmen\r\nin the French Revolution_, but I have since met in the French\r\nNational Archives and elsewhere with a mass of additional materials\r\nwhich enable me to go into much greater detail. The starting-point of\r\nmy researches was the discovery, for which and for other communications\r\nI am indebted to M. Léonce Grasilier, of a register of the principal\r\nforeign arrivals.[1] I have also been favoured with information from\r\nthree correspondents in reply to questions respecting their ancestors,\r\nand the _Dictionary of National Biography_ has of course much\r\nassisted me, though in some instances the dates of birth given or left\r\nin doubt by it may be supplied or corrected by the register above\r\nmentioned, while visits to Paris have sometimes escaped the notice of\r\nits contributors. I have likewise consulted at the Record Office the\r\ndespatches of Anthony Merry, the predecessor of Lord Whitworth at the\r\nParis Embassy, though these, like the Whitworth series edited by Mr.\r\nOscar Browning, seldom stoop from political to social incidents. But\r\nthe most vivid picture of the life and treatment of the captives is\r\ngained from the police bulletin daily prepared for Napoleon and now\r\npreserved in the French Archives.[2] They also throw a flood of light\r\non the character of Napoleon’s internal rule, yet, so far as I know, no\r\nFrench historian has as yet utilised them, and I have every reason to\r\nbelieve that I am the first English writer who has consulted them. They\r\nhave furnished me with most of the data respecting the captives.\r\n\r\nAs for printed sources, the reports of the Historical Manuscripts\r\nCommission have thus far brought to light but few letters written by\r\nvisitors to their friends, yet many of these may still be in existence.\r\nThe literature of the Verdun and other captives is disappointing.\r\nSturt, Forbes, Pinkerton, Lawrence, and Blayney necessarily give\r\nindividual experiences rather than a general history of the detentions.\r\nNot one of these writers, moreover, ventured on keeping a journal,\r\nwhich would have been obviously unsafe, and some of them, publishing\r\ntheir recollections while comrades were still in captivity, naturally\r\nomitted details which might have lessened the pity felt in England by\r\nrevealing the failings of a small minority, or which might have goaded\r\nthe jailers to increased rigour. The police bulletins, on the other\r\nhand, written for perusal by one man, a man whom it was dangerous to\r\nattempt to hoodwink, had no reason for reticence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n                             THE VISITORS\r\n\r\n   No Thoroughfare--Occasional Visitors--Negotiations--Fox--M.\r\n   P.’s--Ex-and Prospective M.

Since the outbreak of\r\nhostilities in 1793 the ‘grand tour’ had been suspended. Maritime\r\nascendency, indeed, had always ensured our communications with\r\nNorth Germany and Italy, but the risk of capture by privateers such\r\nas befell Richard (afterwards the Marquis) Wellesley, the Duke of\r\nWellington’s elder brother, on his return from Lisbon in 1794, coupled\r\nwith intermittent campaigns and conquests by France, had virtually\r\nput a stop to foreign travel. Young noblemen in charge of tutors or\r\n‘bear-wards’ had ceased to traverse the Continent, and French schools\r\nhad ceased to receive British students. The schools, moreover, had\r\nmostly been closed by the Revolution. An Arthur Wellesley, even if\r\ninclined, could not have studied horsemanship at Angers, nor could a\r\nGilbert Elliot have been the comrade of a Mirabeau at Fontainebleau.\r\nSo also as to girls. Pentemont Abbey in Paris, where daughters of such\r\naristocratic families as Annesley, Hobart, De Ros and De Bathe had been\r\neducated between 1780 and 1789, was shut, preparatory to conversion\r\ninto a barrack,[3] while the English Austin convent, where for 150\r\nyears Towneleys, Dormers, and Fermors had been pupils, sometimes\r\nwhen adults returning as nuns, though still in the possession of the\r\ncommunity, had not yet been reopened as a school. London newspapers\r\ncomplacently calculated the money thus prevented from leaving the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt it true that a few of the Englishmen arrested as hostages for Toulon\r\nin the autumn of 1793, though released after the Terror, had been\r\nunable or unwilling to quit France. Christopher Potter, ex-M.P. for\r\nColchester, in 1796 offered Lord Malmesbury, on behalf of Barras, to\r\nsecure peace for a bribe of half a million. Captain Henry Swinburne,\r\ncommissioner for exchanging prisoners, a collateral ancestor of the\r\npoet, likewise found in Paris about that date Mrs. Grace Dalrymple\r\nElliott, ex-mistress of ‘Egalité’ Orleans, who remained till 1801,\r\nAdmiral Rodney’s Portuguese wife and her two daughters, Richard\r\nChenevix, grand-nephew of a Bishop of Waterford, Walter Smythe, brother\r\nof the famous Mrs. Fitzherbert, two sons of the Whitehall preacher\r\nCharles Este, and George Hamilton, a Jamaica planter whose wife, a\r\ndaughter of Lord Leven, was afterwards, as we shall see, the companion\r\nof Sir Herbert Croft; but of course there had been scarcely any\r\nfresh arrivals. Indeed it was illegal for British subjects, unless\r\nwith special permission, to cross over to France.[4] They were liable\r\nat home to punishment for the attempt, just as they were liable if\r\nthey reached the French shore to being prevented from landing or to\r\nincarceration as spies. Lord Camelford, Pitt’s eccentric cousin, who\r\nthreatened if Horne Tooke was refused admission as a clergyman to the\r\nseat for Old Sarum,[5] to nominate in his place his negro servant--a\r\nblack man in lieu of a black coat--was arrested in February 1799 when\r\non the point of crossing the Channel; but as his object was to examine\r\nthe Mediterranean ports he was liberated, being, however, deprived of\r\nhis naval post. We shall hear of him again. Boyd and Ker, bankers of\r\nwhom too we shall hear again, made their way back to Paris in 1797 in\r\nthe hope of recovering confiscated property, but were promptly packed\r\noff. A London newspaper of that year mentions that two men who had\r\npaid a Prussian captain eighty guineas for a passage from Dover to\r\nCalais were also unceremoniously expelled. Braham, however, and Miss\r\nStorace got to Paris and gave concerts in 1797. Thomas Hardy, the\r\nradical shoemaker, managed to send Thomas Paine a pair of shoes so good\r\nthat Paine lent them as a model to a Parisian craftsman, but Hardy\r\nwould not have found it easy to carry them over himself. Fishermen and\r\nsmugglers, it is true, kept up intermittent communications, conveying\r\nnewspapers or merchandise, but they seldom ran the risk of taking\r\npassengers. Even fishing-boats, moreover, which on both sides had been\r\nunmolested, were in January 1801 declared by the British Government\r\nliable to capture; but Bonaparte’s threat of recalling Otto, the\r\ncommissioner of exchanges, from a country where the laws and usages\r\nof war were disregarded and violated,[6] coincidentally with the\r\nresignation of Pitt on account of George III.’s objection to\r\nCatholic emancipation, led to this order being rescinded. Indeed the\r\nexplanations given on this point by the new Addington Administration\r\npaved the way for peace negotiations.\r\n\r\nThere had been, it is true, isolated opportunities for Englishmen\r\nof forming or communicating impressions of France. Malmesbury[7]\r\nhad not only been at Paris in 1796, but at Lille in 1797, on both\r\noccasions receiving an offer from Barras through a Bostonian named\r\nMelville--probably the son of Major Thomas Melville, one of the Boston\r\ntea-party, the last American to wear a cocked hat--to conclude peace\r\nfor £450,000.[8] Malmesbury[9] and his staff on their return assuredly\r\nfound much avidity for information on the France transformed by the\r\nRevolution. That staff consisted at Paris of George Ellis, of the\r\n_Anti-Jacobin_, Lord Granville Leveson-Gower, of whom we shall\r\nhear again, and James Talbot, afterwards Secretary of Legation in\r\nSwitzerland.[10] To avoid being mobbed they were obliged to wear the\r\nrepublican cockade whenever they appeared in the street. At Lille\r\nMalmesbury was accompanied not only by Ellis and Talbot, but by Henry\r\nWellesley, afterwards Earl Cowley, and by Lord Morpeth, afterwards\r\nEarl of Carlisle. Not merely Swinburne but Captain James Cotes and\r\nGeneral Knox were also sent to Paris between 1796 and 1799 to effect\r\nan exchange of prisoners. They must have been eagerly questioned on\r\ntheir return. The notorious Governor Wall, who, living in the south of\r\nFrance, had been refused service in the French army,[11] went back to\r\nEngland in 1797, but clandestinely, and it would have been better for\r\nhim had he remained on the Continent. He had to conceal his identity\r\nand his experiences.[12] But Sir Sidney Smith had escaped from the\r\nTemple in 1798 after two years’ incarceration, and Napoleon in the\r\nfollowing year released some English prisoners, sending them home with\r\nprofessions of a desire for peace. Sir Robert Barclay, a diplomatist\r\ncaptured at sea, was also, after half an hour’s conversation, liberated\r\nby him. Lord Carysfort, whose mutinous crew had taken him to Brest, was\r\nlikewise permitted, in November 1800, after nine months’ detention,\r\nto visit his family on parole. Masquerier managed, moreover, in that\r\nyear to visit Paris and to sketch Napoleon’s portrait for exhibition in\r\nLondon. Tallien, on the other hand, captured by the English on his way\r\nback from Egypt, had been allowed in March 1800 to return to France,\r\nwhere he could give a glowing account of the attentions paid him by the\r\nOpposition leaders, and of his presence, the observed of all observers,\r\nat parliamentary debates. On re-entering Paris he found that his\r\nhandsome wife, Thérése Cabarrus, had become the mistress of the army\r\ncontractor Ouvrard, and she never rejoined him.\r\n\r\nBut, broadly speaking, Englishmen and Frenchmen had for nearly a\r\ndecade been perfect strangers, so that a British cartoon entitled ‘The\r\nFirst Kiss this Ten Years’ depicted Monsieur François stooping to kiss\r\nBritannia with the words, ‘Madam, permit me to pay my profound esteem\r\nto your engaging person and to seal on your divine lips my everlasting\r\nattachment.’ To which Britannia replies, ‘Monsieur, you are truly a\r\nwell-bred gentleman, and though you make me blush, yet you kiss so\r\ndelicately that I could not refuse you, though I was sure that you\r\nwould deceive me again.’\r\n\r\nThe peace preliminaries were signed on the 1st October 1801. England,\r\nwithout waiting for the ratifications, released her 14,000 French\r\nprisoners,[13] and on the 23rd October Boulogne, for the first time for\r\nnearly nine years, saw the arrival of an English vessel bringing 160 of\r\nthese captives.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to enter into the details of the negotiations, nor\r\nneed I dwell on the rejoicings for the peace. Cobbett in London had his\r\nwindows smashed for refusing to illuminate, and the jury recommended\r\nto mercy three of the delinquents, but Cobbett, though invited by\r\nthe judge to join in this recommendation, declined, stating that he\r\nexpected justice. The London mob took the horses out of Otto’s carriage\r\nand drew it, while Lauriston, grand-nephew of the famous speculator\r\nLaw,[14] on coming over with the ratifications received ovations. On\r\nthe 1st November Lord Cornwallis, ex-Governor of India, accompanied\r\nby his son, Lord Brome (afterwards the second and last marquis),\r\nby his illegitimate son, Colonel (eventually General Sir Miles)\r\nNightingale,[15] his son-in-law, Captain Singleton, Colonel Littlehales\r\n(afterwards Sir E. Littlehales Baker), and Francis (brother of Sir\r\nJohn) Moore, started for Paris.[16]\r\n\r\nAmiens had been chosen for the negotiations, but Napoleon, evidently\r\nwishing Lord Cornwallis to see how firmly the Consulate was\r\nestablished, had invited him to come round by Paris on the plea of\r\nshowing him the illuminations of the 9th November in celebration of the\r\npeace with Austria. The road from Calais to Paris, which had since 1793\r\nbeen almost deserted, was hastily put in repair for him, and was soon\r\nto be dotted with mail-coaches and post-chaises. Cornwallis arrived\r\non the 7th November; he alighted at the Hotel Grange Batelière, the\r\nfinest in Paris, it being an old mansion with spacious grounds, and\r\nhe was received by Napoleon on the 10th. Napoleon suggested to him\r\na reciprocal expulsion of foreign conspirators, the Bourbon princes\r\nto be packed off by England, and the United Irishmen by France; but\r\nCornwallis naturally evaded so delicate a question. Napoleon did not\r\ninvite him to dinner, and did not rise to receive Lord Brome in his\r\nbox at the Opera, an incivility much commented upon. Cornwallis gave\r\na dinner on the 16th to Lord Minto, who was on his way home from the\r\nVienna Embassy, and five other fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\n   ‘After dinner,’ says the _Times_, ‘the company went to the\r\n   Opera, where the performance was the _Mysteries of Isis_.\r\n   Every part of the house was so crowded that numbers were unable\r\n   to procure places. Some couplets were sung in celebration of\r\n   the union of the two nations, which excited an enthusiasm that\r\n   displayed itself by universal and repeated bursts of applause.\r\n\r\n   ‘Lord Cornwallis was so extremely affected by the scene, that he\r\n   shed tears! On his rising to go away, the audience recommenced\r\n   their testimonies of applause. His Lordship showed how much he\r\n   was flattered by the reception he had met with, by bowing to\r\n   them in the most affecting manner. The following may be given as\r\n   a specimen of the verses sung upon this occasion:--\r\n\r\n    “Anglais, Français, restez unis,\r\n    Qu’à vos chants l’Univers réponde:\r\n    Quand de tels rivaux sont amis,\r\n    Qui peut troubler la paix du monde?”’\r\n\r\nCornwallis also dined with Talleyrand, and Francis James Jackson,\r\nwriting to Speaker Abbot (afterwards Lord Colchester), says:--\r\n\r\n   ‘What do you think of Lord Cornwallis, with all his dignity of\r\n   decorum, dining the other day at a table of thirty covers with\r\n   the kept mistresses, and being obliged to hand out the ugliest\r\n   and frailest of them, because she was in keeping of the minister\r\n   for Foreign Affairs?’\r\n\r\nOn the 28th Cornwallis left for Amiens. There Joseph Bonaparte\r\nconducted the negotiations, and he speaks highly of Cornwallis’s\r\nstraightforwardness. Cornwallis carried back with him to England\r\ncotton-velvet goods, to show his countrymen the superiority of Amiens\r\nlooms, and the Calais municipality gave him a banquet before he\r\nembarked.[17]\r\n\r\nAnthony Merry, who had been Consul in Spain, had been sent to Paris\r\nin July 1801, succeeding Cotes as Commissioner of Exchanges, but he\r\nassisted Cornwallis at Amiens, and during his absence from Paris\r\nFrancis James Jackson, who had been Secretary of Legation first at\r\nMadrid, then at Berlin, and afterwards at St. Petersburg, and had\r\nbeen secretary to Pitt, acted as _chargé d’affaires_. Jackson\r\nwas accompanied by his brother George, to whom Parisian sights were\r\na novelty, and by Dawson Warren[18] and Hill as _attachés_.\r\nJackson, in reporting his arrival in November, stated that he had been\r\nloaded with attentions such as ‘the most refined system of civility\r\ncould suggest.’ On the 4th January 1802 he presented his credentials\r\nto Napoleon, who said, ‘I am very glad to see an English minister\r\nhere; it is essential to the civilisation of the world.’[19] Merry\r\nreturning from Amiens, Jackson left on the 18th April 1802,[20] and\r\nMerry remained at the head of the embassy till December 1802. He was\r\nreproached with giving no dinner on George III.’s birthday\r\non the 4th of June, but he was expecting to be superseded by Lord\r\nWhitworth, and his stipend probably did not allow of much display.\r\nThe embassy was installed, as before the Revolution, in the Caraman\r\nmansion, faubourg du Roule.\r\n\r\nWhitworth, formerly at St. Petersburg, had been appointed ambassador\r\nas early as April 1802, but on account of the delay in the nomination\r\nof the French Envoy to London his instructions were not drawn up till\r\nthe 10th September, and he did not start till the 10th November. He\r\nwent by Southampton and Havre, and was accompanied by his newly-married\r\nwife, the Duchess of Dorset, widow of the Ambassador to Paris of 1789,\r\nand by her two daughters. Her son, the young Duke of Dorset, remained\r\nat Harrow, where he was the schoolfellow and friend of Byron, but\r\nas we shall see he went over to Paris for the Easter holidays.[21]\r\nWhitworth’s staff consisted of his brother, Colonel Whitworth, James\r\nTalbot, James Henry Mandeville,[22] Captain Edward Pierrepont,[23] and\r\nBenjafield, with the Rev. Thomas Hodgson as chaplain, and Dr. Maclaurin\r\nas physician. The Duchess of Dorset’s retention of her first husband’s\r\ntitle greatly puzzled the Parisians, many of whom actually believed\r\nthat she was not married to Whitworth. According to Maria Edgeworth,\r\nthe latter had at Paris the same house, the same wife, and the same\r\nhorses as the Duke of Dorset had had in 1789, but the line should\r\ndoubtless be drawn at the horses. He took with him six carriages, one\r\nof which had been the admiration of Londoners, though it was less\r\nimposing than that taken over by a Dr. Brodum, whose object was to\r\npromote the sale of his syrup for ensuring longevity. He presented his\r\ncredentials on the 6th December 1802, and remained as we shall see till\r\nthe 12th May 1803.[24]\r\n\r\nThe Dover and Calais mail packets did not recommence running till\r\nthe 18th November 1801, but English visitors had begun to arrive as\r\nearly as September or October, and Savary tells us that these pioneers\r\nfacilitated the conclusion of peace, for they returned with assurances\r\nof the stability of the consular government. Napoleon on the 14th\r\nOctober instructed Fouché freely to admit English visitors, taking\r\ncare, however, that they had Foreign Office passports, and were not\r\nFrench _émigrés_. One of them unfortunately lost his life. Charles\r\nJohn Clarke, of Hitchin Priory, had gone over with his wife. Their\r\nonly child had died two years before, and they sought relief for their\r\nsorrow, intending to go on to Italy. Clarke was on a stand witnessing\r\nthe fireworks of the 9th November in the Tuileries gardens when it gave\r\nway, and its eighty occupants were injured, Clarke so seriously, his\r\nspine being fractured, that after lingering nearly a month he expired.\r\nNapoleon sent his surgeon to make inquiries and offer his services,\r\nstating that he should himself call as soon as the patient was well\r\nenough to receive visitors. Clarke, who had been six years married,\r\nwas only thirty-one years of age. His widow, several years his junior,\r\ncarried his remains home.\r\n\r\nNever before had there been such an influx of English visitors as\r\nduring these eighteen months. ‘All the idle captives of the land of\r\nfogs,’ says M. Sorel, ‘shook their damp wings and prepared to take\r\ntheir flight towards the regions of pleasure and brightness.’ Even the\r\ninfluenza or _grippe_, which prevailed in January and February\r\n1803, did not deter them, and they mostly escaped the malady, an escape\r\nattributed to their being habituated to humidity. ‘Ours,’ says Samuel\r\nRogers, who was one of the visitors, ‘is a nation of travellers, and no\r\nwonder, when the elements, air, water, and fire attend at our bidding\r\nto transport us from shore to shore, when the ship rushes into the\r\ndeep, her track the foam as of some mighty torrent, and in three hours\r\nor less we stand gazing and gazed at among a foreign people. None want\r\nan excuse. If rich, they go to enjoy; if poor, to retrench; if sick,\r\nto recover; if studious, to learn; if learned, to relax from their\r\nstudies.’[25] This, though written in 1839, is, with the exception of\r\nthe reference to steam, applicable to the influx of 1801–1803. A few\r\nwent for health, taking Paris as a stage to Montpellier, then still in\r\nrepute, Nice, or Italy, others to recover property or for business, a\r\nfew for study, most for pleasure. The current steadily swelled all\r\nthe winter, spring, and summer. One of the earliest packets brought\r\nsixty-three ladies, and the Calais hotels were packed, seven hundred\r\nand ninety-eight passengers landing in ten days. In the last decade of\r\nPrairial (June 1802) there were ninety-one arrivals, in the last decade\r\nof Thermidor (August) ninety-seven, in the last decade of Fructidor\r\n(September) one hundred and fifty-six.[26] This last average of fifteen\r\na day seems small to us, but was surprising for that time. Merry states\r\nthat there were once as many as five thousand English in Paris, and\r\nthat when he left in December there were one thousand nine hundred.\r\nIn the autumn he sent home long lists of persons to whom he had given\r\nreturn passports, and he had complained in May that he was so busy\r\nin issuing them as to have no time to attend properly to diplomatic\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe cost of a trip to Paris was what in those days seemed moderate.\r\nFor £4, 13s. you could get a through ticket by Dover and Calais,\r\nstarting either from the City at 4.30 A.M. by the old and\r\nnow revived line of coaches connected with the rue Notre Dame des\r\nVictoires establishment in Paris, or morning and night by a new line\r\nfrom Charing Cross.[27] Probably a still cheaper route, though there\r\nwere no through tickets, was by Brighton and Dieppe, the crossing\r\ntaking 10 or 15 hours. By Calais it seldom took more than 8 hours,\r\nbut passengers were advised to carry light refreshments with them.\r\nThe diligence from Calais to Paris, going only four miles an hour,\r\ntook 54 hours for the journey, but a handsome carriage drawn by three\r\nhorses, in a style somewhat similar to the English post-chaise, could\r\nbe hired by four or five fellow-travellers, and this made six miles an\r\nhour. £30 would cover the expense of a seven weeks’ visit, including\r\nhotels, sight-seeing, and restaurants.[28] As for fashionable people,\r\neven if they went by coach to Dover, they posted from Calais to Paris,\r\nespecially if they formed a family party and took servants with them.\r\nSome, like Lord Guilford, even shipped their own carriages, but he had\r\nto hire four sorry steeds at Calais, for horses were not allowed to\r\nland.[29]\r\n\r\nLord Elgin had four servants, Lord Yarmouth, with his wife and two\r\nchildren, had eight, Thomas Hope three, and Lady Maynard two. The\r\njourney occupied four days, if we may judge by the French General\r\nHardy, who, captured in Ireland in 1798, had been exchanged--there\r\nbeing no English prisoner of equal rank--for four officers, four\r\nnon-commissioned officers, and ten privates. It took him a day to get\r\nfrom London to Dover, another day for the crossing, and two days for\r\nthe journey from Calais to Paris.\r\n\r\nPassengers by Boulogne if arriving at low tide were landed in a\r\nsingular fashion. Thomas Manning, of whom we shall hear presently, in a\r\nletter to his father communicated to me by his grand-nephew, Mr. E. B.\r\nHarris, says:--\r\n\r\n   ‘The tide having ebbed, we were obliged to land without entering\r\n   the inner harbour of Boulogne. It was night before the sluggish\r\n   boat that the Boulogne mariners sent off could land us all, and\r\n   a strange landing it seemed to me. The boat rowed towards the\r\n   nearest shore till it ran aground, which happened in the midst\r\n   of the breakers. In an instant the boathead was surrounded by a\r\n   throng of women up to their middles and over, who were there to\r\n   carry us on shore. Not being aware of this manœuvre, we did not\r\n   throw ourselves into the arms of these sea-nymphs so instantly\r\n   as we ought, whereby those who sat at the stern of the boat were\r\n   deluged with sea spray. For myself I was in front, and very\r\n   quickly understood the clamour of the mermaids. I flung myself\r\n   upon the backs of two of them without reserve, and was safely\r\n   and dryly borne on shore, but one poor gentleman slipped through\r\n   their fingers and fell over head and ears into the sea.’\r\n\r\nThis primitive mode of landing had been noted in 1792 by William\r\nHunter, who states that one of the ‘mermaids,’ unequal to the weight\r\nof a stout Englishman who had been reserved to the last, dropped him\r\nmidway. Lanterns dimly lit up this curious scene.[30]\r\n\r\nThe return voyage had to be made on French bottoms, in order that the\r\nmercantile marine might be encouraged, and this regulation had its\r\ninconvenience, not to say dangers. The _Times_ of 12th January,\r\n1803, says:--\r\n\r\n   ‘A navy Officer, who recently returned from Calais, where he\r\n   had spent a few days, was actually under the necessity of giving\r\n   directions, and afterwards exerting himself with alacrity, to\r\n   preserve his own life and that of the other passengers. The\r\n   master of the vessel, who was very much afraid of the violence\r\n   of the wind, sat half-way down to the cabin, with his head under\r\n   the companion, and covered with a huge night-cap, to prevent its\r\n   reaching him, as he was (he said) grievously afflicted with the\r\n   rheumatism; and to the repeated demands of the passengers, why\r\n   he did not come upon deck and give orders for the safety of the\r\n   vessel, he answered, deliberately, taking the pipe out of his\r\n   mouth, that there was no immediate danger, and if any should\r\n   arise, he had a good sea-boat, which would carry him and all his\r\n   crew safe to land.’\r\n\r\nLet us now see who were the visitors, beginning not with the earliest\r\nbut by far the most eminent of them, Fox. He had not seen France\r\nsince 1788, when he passed through with Mrs. Armistead on his way\r\nto Switzerland and Italy. Waiting, like many other M.P.’s, till his\r\nelection was over, he started at Dover on the 31st July 1802, again\r\naccompanied by the so-called Mrs. Armistead (only now for the first\r\ntime publicly figuring as his wife, though they had been privately\r\nmarried some years previously), by St. Andrew (afterwards Lord) St.\r\nJohn, M.P., and by John Bernard Trotter, his secretary.[31] His nephew\r\nLord Holland had engaged rooms for him in the faubourg St. Germain, but\r\nhe seems to have removed to the hotel Grange Batelière and eventually\r\nto the hotel Richelieu, the mansion erected and formerly occupied\r\nby the notorious _roué_, Marshal (grand-nephew of Cardinal)\r\nRichelieu, who had entertained him in 1788. Fox’s chief object was\r\nto consult French records for his life of James II., his\r\nancestor, and he daily frequented the National Archives for that\r\npurpose, in company with St. John, Robert (afterwards Sir Robert)\r\nAdair, and Trotter. Talleyrand, after his return to England, sent him\r\na complete copy of Barillon’s despatches, which Fox had declared to be\r\nworth their weight in gold.\r\n\r\nMany people in England fancied, however, that he was mainly bent on\r\nseeing Napoleon, and the caricaturists did not neglect so tempting\r\na subject. Gillray, in a cartoon entitled ‘Introduction of Citizen\r\nVolpone and his suite at Paris,’ represented Bonaparte as seated on\r\na chair surrounded by Mamelukes, while Fox and his wife,[32] both\r\nextremely corpulent, are bowing and curtseying, Erskine, in legal\r\ncostume with his hand on his heart, and Lord and Lady Holland making\r\nup the group. Another caricaturist depicted the reception by the First\r\nConsul of Fox, Erskine, and Combe. To Fox he says, ‘Fox, ha! How old\r\nare you?’ To Combe, ‘A brewer, Lord Mayor, ha! great pomp,’ and to\r\nErskine, ‘Mr. Brief, ha! a great lawyer; can talk well. There, you may\r\ngo.’[33] Trotter tells us what really occurred:--\r\n\r\n   ‘Bonaparte, of a small and by no means commanding figure,\r\n   dressed plainly though richly in the embroidered consular coat,\r\n   without powder in his hair, looked like a private gentleman,\r\n   indifferent as to dress, and devoid of all haughtiness in his\r\n   air. The English ambassador, after the presentation of some\r\n   English noblemen, announced to him Mr. Fox. He was a good deal\r\n   flurried, and after indicating considerable emotion said--“Ah,\r\n   Mr. Fox; I have heard with pleasure of your arrival, I have\r\n   desired much to see you. I have long admired in you the orator\r\n   and friend of his country, who, in constantly raising his voice\r\n   for peace, consulted that country’s best interests, those of\r\n   Europe, and of the human race. The two great nations of Europe\r\n   require peace. They have nothing to fear [from each other]. They\r\n   ought to understand and value [esteem] one another. In you,\r\n   Mr. Fox, I see with much satisfaction that great statesman who\r\n   recommended peace because there was no just object of war, who\r\n   saw Europe desolated to no purpose and who struggled for its\r\n   relief.”’\r\n\r\nTrotter adds that Fox, averse to compliments, neither replied to nor\r\nreciprocated them, and that a few questions and answers respecting his\r\ntour terminated the interview.\r\n\r\nNapoleon afterwards invited Fox to a dinner of two hundred guests,\r\nto which he went unpowdered. John King, of whom we shall presently\r\nhear, thought it inconsistent of Fox to accept such attentions, which\r\nacceptance he attributes to a desire to please his wife; but Fox\r\nobviously could not decline an invitation from the ruler of the land\r\nwhose hospitality he was enjoying, though he felt perfectly free to\r\nrefuse to lunch with the brewer Santerre, notorious for his part in the\r\nexecution of Louis XVI. According to the Rev. Stephen Weston,\r\nNapoleon complimented Fox as the greatest man of a great nation. Fox,\r\nas was to be expected, combated Napoleon’s accusations against Pitt,\r\nand especially against Windham, of complicity in the infernal-machine\r\nplot of 1800. Thiers gives an account of Fox being taken by Napoleon to\r\nthe Industrial Exhibition at the Louvre, when a courtier sarcastically\r\npointed on a globe to the small space occupied by England, whereupon\r\nFox, spreading his arms round the globe, said, ‘Yes, but though we all\r\nspring from there we grasp the whole world.’ The truth is that though\r\nNapoleon and Fox happened to be simultaneously at the Exhibition they\r\ndid not come across each other.[34] It was Chaptal who conducted Fox\r\nover the Exhibition, and he tells us that Fox admired the specimens,\r\nbut thought them too dear for common use, upon which Chaptal took him\r\nto the cutlery department, where Fox filled his pockets with cheap\r\nknives, and then to a watch stall, where he bought half a dozen watches\r\nat 13 f. a piece.[35] He frequented the theatres. Not only, however,\r\nwas his French very imperfect, but he committed a great breach of\r\ndecorum by not calling on the two minor consuls, Cambacérès and Lebrun.\r\nHe had to apologise through Merry. Lebrun overlooked the blunder and\r\nreceived Fox on his reparatory visit, but Cambacérès was ruffled, and\r\ninsisted that Fox should make an unceremonious call as though he had\r\nbeen before.\r\n\r\nWe learn this from a secret agent of the Bourbons,[36] who also\r\ntells us that Fox, after his conversation with Napoleon, said, ‘It’s\r\nall up with liberty.’ He could scarcely, however, have needed that\r\nconversation to form this judgment, for Napoleon on the 2nd August\r\nhad been elected consul for life. Fox must have felt much more at\r\nhome with Lafayette, with whom he spent a fortnight at La Grange,\r\nplanting ivy round the newly-erected towers as a memento. He dined\r\nin Paris with Talleyrand and Junot, and went shooting with General\r\nBerthier. Madame Junot thought he looked with his dark grey coat like\r\na Devonshire farmer, but when talking his countenance was radiant with\r\nintelligence, sagacity, and eloquence.[37] On the 16th September he\r\nattended a sitting of the Tribunat, when the captain on guard, Boyer,\r\nthanked him for having in 1795 obtained the unfettering, and all but\r\nthe liberation, of two hundred French officers at Porchester, a benefit\r\nwhich they would never forget. ‘Our chains were broken,’ said Boyer:\r\n‘we were almost free.’[38] At Versailles, on entering a room which he\r\nwas told had long been shut up, he found his own bust, along with those\r\nof Algernon Sidney, Hampden, Chatham, and Washington.[39] But was this\r\na stratagem of Napoleon to flatter him? Curiously enough, Napoleon on\r\nhis dressing-table at the Tuileries had, as the Edgeworths noticed, the\r\nbust not only of Fox but of Nelson, for whom he also entertained great\r\nadmiration. He asked Mrs. Damer for a second bust of Fox, a commission\r\nwhich the lady could not execute till 1815.\r\n\r\nFox was criticised in England for taking tea with Helen Maria Williams,\r\nfor it had been erroneously imagined, by Boswell among others, that\r\nshe had marched exultantly over the bodies of the Swiss massacred in\r\n1792. He was also twitted with meeting Arthur O’Connor, the United\r\nIrish exile. The fact was that he and Erskine went to dine with\r\nMadame Tallien without knowing that O’Connor would be there. Fox with\r\ngreat tact made the best of what he considered an unlucky incident by\r\ntreating O’Connor exactly like the other guests, but Erskine was more\r\nembarrassed, for as counsel on his trial at Maidstone in 1798 he had\r\nvouched for O’Connor’s loyalty, whereas the latter had since made a\r\nconfession of conspiracy.\r\n\r\nFox remained till the 11th November. ‘I have certainly,’ he wrote,\r\n‘seldom spent a time pleasanter than at Paris, but I never in my life\r\nfelt such delight in returning home.’ In 1806 he reciprocated the\r\ncivilities shown him by sending word to Talleyrand that a Frenchman\r\ncalled Guillet had called on him and offered to kidnap Napoleon.\r\nGuillet was consequently arrested in Paris, and consigned, not to\r\nprison, but to Bicêtre lunatic asylum, where he died twelve months\r\nafterwards. Canning was guilty of the bad taste, not to say ignominy,\r\nof censuring Fox in Parliament for giving this warning, the generosity\r\nof which was warmly appreciated by Napoleon, as he told Lord Ebrington\r\nat Elba in 1814.\r\n\r\nThe general election had come rather inopportunely for visits to\r\nParis, Parliament being dissolved on the 29th June, and the new House\r\nmeeting on the 16th November. Elections, moreover, were much less\r\nexpeditiously despatched than nowadays. Nevertheless about eighty\r\nM.P.’s, mostly Foxites, as Liberals were then called, but some Pittites\r\nor Ministerialists, went over either before or after the elections.\r\nSome of these M.P.’s are entitled to notice.[40]\r\n\r\nAcheson, who in 1807 became Lord Gosford, revisited Paris in 1814,\r\nand became Governor of Canada. Adair, as we have seen, was the friend\r\nof Fox, and indeed was destined to be his last surviving friend. When\r\nvisiting St. Petersburg in 1791 his letters home were in cipher, but\r\nforwarded through Whitworth, the ambassador, and he was absurdly\r\nsuspected of having been sent thither by Fox to thwart Pitt’s\r\npolicy.[41] Barclay, as already mentioned, was a diplomatist, and\r\nhad been a prisoner in France. He had just married a German lady at\r\nHamburg. Baring was the famous banker, and though deaf from his youth\r\nsat and voted in Parliament. Benfield and Boyd not only come together\r\nalphabetically, but had been partners in a London bank which was wound\r\nup in 1799. Paul Benfield went out to India in the Company’s service,\r\nand there made a fortune, partly by trade, partly by fortification\r\ncontracts and by loans. He advanced money to the Nawab of the Carnatic,\r\non conditions for which Burke afterwards, with his customary vehemence,\r\nbranded him as ‘a criminal who ought long since to have fattened the\r\nkites with his offal.’ In 1777 he was ordered to quit India, but he\r\nwas subsequently reinstated in his post, and returned to Madras. In\r\n1780 he became M.P. for Cricklade, and in 1796 he exchanged that seat\r\nfor Shaftesbury, another of his five pocket-boroughs. He was also\r\nrecorder for Shaftesbury, such appointments being sometimes conferred\r\non or sold by corporations to men not even lawyers. In 1796 he assigned\r\nthe second seat to Walter Boyd, whose sleeping partner he had become\r\nin 1793. Boyd had had a bank in Paris, and had been an agent for the\r\nFrench Revolutionary Government in paying for corn from England; but\r\nthreatened with arrest in October 1792 he had fled, with his partner\r\nWalter Ker. It was alleged in December 1794 that he had sold to the\r\nFrench Treasury drafts for ten million francs on London, boasting that\r\nthey would be dishonoured; but the Finance Committee, on investigation,\r\ndeclared the charge unfounded. In 1795 Boyd contracted for an English\r\nloan, but in 1797 his bank fell into difficulties. Boyd had entered\r\ninto imprudent speculations, and when he went to Paris, calculating\r\non the restitution of his property, the change of government there\r\nfrustrated his hopes, and he was expelled. In 1799 Pitt, apparently\r\nin order to extricate him from his embarrassments, concluded a second\r\nloan with him without inviting tenders from any other firm, on the plea\r\nthat this had been promised him in 1793. A select committee of inquiry\r\nseverely condemned this transaction, but an obsequious House of Commons\r\ncondoned it. It did not, however, avert Boyd’s bankruptcy. The two\r\npartners were now among the earliest visitors to Paris. They went at\r\nthe close of 1801, Boyd still hoping to recover property. They were on\r\nthe point of losing their seats for Shaftesbury, Benfield having sold\r\nthat borough for £40,000 to a Colonel Wood. We shall see by and by how\r\nthey sped in France.\r\n\r\nBest, who became successively Serjeant Best, Sir Thomas Best, and Lord\r\nWynford, reached the judicial bench in 1818, and in 1824 was made\r\nChief-Justice of the Common Pleas. Originally a Whig, he ended as a\r\nviolent Tory. Brodrick was Secretary to the (India) Board of Control.\r\nBurdett speaks for himself, as when, on being greeted at Calais as the\r\nfriend of Fox, he exclaimed, ‘No, the friend of liberty.’ In the summer\r\nof 1793 he had attended the clubs and the Convention. Father of Lady\r\nBurdett-Coutts, he began as a demagogue and ended as a reactionary. He\r\nboasted of his election for Middlesex having cost him £100,000. He,\r\nwith his friend Bosville, called on Thomas Paine, giving him £240 to\r\nclear off his debts and return to America. He also called, with his old\r\ntutor Lechevalier, on La Réveillère Lepaux, the theophilanthropist, on\r\nwhom he made no favourable impression.[42] Burdett, who had witnessed\r\nthe early stage of the Revolution with more curiosity than sympathy,\r\ntold Arthur Young, who had likewise seen something of that upheaval,\r\nthat the Consulate was the completest military despotism that had ever\r\nexisted.[43]\r\n\r\nLord George Cavendish became in 1831 Earl of Burlington, and succeeded\r\nhis brother as Duke of Devonshire. Alderman Combe had been Sheriff of\r\nLondon in 1792 and Lord Mayor in 1799. Fox and Sheridan were godfathers\r\nto the son born to him during his mayoralty. Napoleon, according to\r\nWeston, said to him, ‘You were Lord Mayor in a year of dearth. I\r\nknow what it is to have to keep people quiet when bread is dear.’\r\nUnsuccessful at a by-election for the City in 1795, he had been elected\r\nin 1796. In 1800 he had convened a common hall to petition for peace.\r\nIn 1805 he gave a dinner in his brewery to the Duke and Duchess of\r\nYork, the Duke of Cambridge, Lady Anne Fitzroy, and other aristocratic\r\nguests. He ultimately resigned his aldermanic gown and seat in\r\nParliament and confined himself to his business. He died in 1818.\r\n\r\nCowper was the son of Earl Cowper. Dallas, on returning home from\r\nthe service of the East India Company, was the champion of Warren\r\nHastings, and in 1793 and 1799 had written pamphlets against the French\r\nGovernment. The Marquis of Douglas, son of the Duke of Hamilton, was\r\nsent in 1807 as Ambassador to St. Petersburg. Ellis was afterwards Lord\r\nSeaford, taking his title from the little Sussex town for which he and\r\nhis brother sat. Erskine, of whom we have already heard, became Lord\r\nChancellor in the thirteen months’ Administration of ‘All the Talents.’\r\nHis son David, who accompanied him, succeeded him in the peerage.\r\n\r\nFitzpatrick, the intimate friend of Fox and the uncle of Lord Holland,\r\nwas, like Fox, fond both of the classics and of gambling. He was an\r\namateur actor and a wit. He had made an impressive speech in 1796\r\nin favour of Lafayette, then a prisoner in Austria, and now visited\r\nhim at La Grange. In 1806 he became Secretary for War. John Leslie\r\nFoster became an Irish Judge and lived till 1842. Philip Francis, the\r\nIndian councillor commonly regarded as the author of the _Letters\r\nof Junius_, escorted three of his children, Philip, Elizabeth, and\r\nHarriet, who went on to Nice for the benefit of Harriet’s health.\r\nWe have no letters from Francis himself, but young Philip tells us\r\nthat Bonaparte renewed (?) acquaintance with his father and was very\r\ncivil. He likewise tells us that at Madame Bonaparte’s reception he\r\nsaw Bonaparte, after watching her play for some time from behind her\r\nchair, drop a purse into her lap as he moved away. Francis, with his\r\ndaughter Catherine, was again in Paris in January 1803, apparently from\r\nalarm at the miscarriage of letters from Nice, and while there heard\r\nof Harriet’s death. The Miss Berrys had been very kind to her. Francis\r\nhad twice visited Paris in 1791, and his son had learned French at\r\nRouen in the summer of 1792.[44] Lord Granville Leveson-Gower became\r\nthe first Earl Granville and Ambassador to France. His son we all\r\nremember as Foreign Secretary. Graham, the Ripon Graham, was the father\r\nof Sir James Graham the statesman. Hare, who sat from 1781 to 1804 for\r\nthe Duke of Devonshire’s borough of Knaresborough, was a wit and a\r\nclassical scholar who broke down in his maiden speech and thenceforth\r\nremained silent. He went to Paris for his health or fell ill when\r\nthere, and Fox called on the invalid, who died shortly after his\r\nreturn. Jekyll, too, who had visited France in 1775, was a famous wit\r\nand a great diner-out. He also sat for a pocket-borough from 1787 to\r\n1816, but his wit did not come out in his frequent speeches. The Prince\r\nRegent, fond of good talkers, made him in 1805 his Solicitor-General,\r\nand procured for him a commissionership in lunacy and a mastership in\r\nChancery.\r\n\r\nJohnston had been British Resident at Lucknow, and was an authority on\r\nIndia. Kinnaird, who in 1803 succeeded to the peerage, being intimately\r\nconnected with the Bonapartists, had information in 1817 of Cantillon’s\r\nintended attack on the Duke of Wellington, and sent him an anonymous\r\nwarning. He and his wife afterwards went to Paris to give information\r\non the subject, and the latter was arrested as an accomplice. Kinnaird\r\nnaturally complained of this as a violation of a virtual safe-conduct.\r\nHe had been expelled from France in the previous year as a political\r\nintriguer. He eventually lived in Italy on an allowance from his\r\ncreditors.[45] Long, afterwards Lord Farnborough, had been Secretary\r\nto the Treasury, became a Commissioner of the Treasury in 1804, and\r\nin 1806 was made Secretary for Ireland. He had written pamphlets on\r\nthe French Revolution in 1795. Eventually he was known as an art\r\nconnoisseur, and George iv. sought his advice on architecture. His\r\nfather-in-law, Sir Abraham Hume, accompanied him.\r\n\r\nLord Lovaine in 1830 succeeded his father as Earl of Beverley, and\r\neventually in 1865, two years before his death, became Duke of\r\nNorthumberland. He was the father of the Duke who adopted Irvingism\r\nand married Henry Drummond’s daughter. He went on to Naples with his\r\nnewly married wife, Louisa Wortley, and his father, and on their\r\nreturn they found themselves, as we shall see, prisoners. Macpherson\r\nhad in 1785 been Governor-General of India. Sir C. Morgan became\r\nJudge-Advocate. Lord Morpeth became Earl of Carlisle and father of the\r\ndistinguished statesman. Nicholl, a frequent speaker and a strenuous\r\nopponent of the war with France, had visited that country in 1788–1789\r\nand had made the acquaintance of the Abbé Raynal and other economists.\r\nPaget, afterwards Sir Edward Paget, son of the Earl of Uxbridge, was\r\ndestined, as we shall find, to pay a second and involuntary visit. He\r\nhad already served in Flanders, Minorca, and Egypt. He had been one of\r\nthe hostages given to the French at Cairo till they embarked in July\r\n1801. He afterwards served in Sicily and the Peninsula and was Governor\r\nof Ceylon. Parnell was the great-uncle of the Home Rule leader. He\r\nbecame Secretary for War, Paymaster-General, and Treasurer of the Navy,\r\nand in 1841 was created Lord Congleton. Lord Henry Petty, Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer at the age of twenty-five, and Pitt’s successor\r\nin the representation of Cambridge University (where he defeated\r\nLord Palmerston), became on his brother’s death in 1809 Marquis of\r\nLansdowne. After filling various high offices he survived till 1863\r\nto the age of eighty, the Nestor of the House of Lords. Pollen, the\r\naccomplished son of a Surrey clergyman, had by one vote defeated the\r\nDuke of Norfolk’s nominee at Leominster. He afterwards raised a corps\r\nof Fencibles, whom he accompanied to Nova Scotia. On his way home\r\nin 1808, after several years’ travel in Russia and other countries,\r\nhe was wrecked and drowned off Memel at the age of thirty-two. His\r\nwife applied for permission to return home through France, but the\r\nfavourable answer being delayed, she embarked at Königsberg for\r\nEngland.[46] St. John, as we have seen, was the companion of Fox, and\r\nafterwards succeeded to a peerage. Scott was the elder son of Lord\r\nChancellor Eldon, but predeceased his father, leaving a son to succeed\r\nto the title.\r\n\r\nJohn Spencer Smith, page in his youth to Queen Charlotte, was a\r\ndiplomatist. He was asked by Napoleon whether he was not Sidney Smith’s\r\nbrother, and Napoleon, on being answered in the affirmative, rejoined,\r\n‘He is a good fellow and a good officer.’ Spencer Smith had been\r\n_chargé d’affaires_ at Constantinople from 1796 to 1799, and there\r\nwas a legend of his having married a rich Turkish widow. The truth is,\r\nhis wife was daughter of the Austrian Baron Ratzbael. While staying at\r\nVenice for her health with her two sons in 1806, she was arrested as\r\nan alleged spy, and was to have been sent on to Valenciennes, but at\r\nBrescia, through the Marquis di Salvo, a friendly Sicilian, she escaped\r\nby a ladder from the window and made her way first to Austria and\r\nRussia, and ultimately to England.[47] Napoleon had at the same time\r\ntried to arrest her husband, then Ambassador at Würtemberg, but burning\r\nhis papers he fled in time. Occupying himself with archæology, Smith\r\nultimately settled at Caen, where he died.\r\n\r\nWilliam Smith interests us as the grandfather of Miss Florence\r\nNightingale, and also of George Eliot’s friend, Barbara Smith, Madame\r\nBodichon, whose husband introduced the eucalyptus into Algeria. He is\r\nsaid to have been the only English Nonconformist in the Parliament\r\nof 1802, and his name was given to an Act of 1819, which relieved\r\nUnitarians from speaking of the Trinity in the marriage-service\r\nresponses. Lord Hardwicke’s Act of 1752, while repressing irregular\r\nmarriages, had inflicted a grievance on Dissenters by requiring\r\nall marriages except those of Quakers and Jews to be solemnised in\r\nchurches. Smith, in 1822, tried to follow up his success of 1819 by\r\nintroducing civil marriage, but his bill, though passing through\r\nthe Commons, was shelved in the Lords, so that it was not till 1836\r\nthat Lord John Russell revived and carried it. A London merchant,\r\nSmith had sat for Sudbury and Camelford. On his standing in 1802\r\nfor Norwich, where Dissenters were and still are numerous, Thomas\r\nGrenville, foreseeing that he would oust Windham, directed his brother\r\nthe Duke of Buckingham to return Windham for St. Mawes. ‘Smith,’ said\r\nGrenville, ‘was cooping up voters in barns and houses, where they are\r\nkept drunk till the day of poll; and in short, trying all the means\r\nof mischief that his fertile talents can supply in the mysteries of\r\nelectioneering.’[48] Smith, who was much respected, sat for Norwich\r\ntill his death in 1835, and was succeeded by his son, Benjamin Smith.\r\n\r\nSturt, member for Bridport since 1784, was bred to the sea, but came\r\nunexpectedly into possession of the family estate in Dorsetshire. He\r\nretained, however, his liking for the water, had a narrow escape in a\r\ncutter race, and in 1800 was awarded the Humane Society’s medal for\r\nrescuing a man from drowning. He now went to stay at Havre. In 1801 he\r\nhad obtained £100 damages from the Marquis of Blandford, son of the\r\nDuke of Marlborough, for the seduction of his wife, Lady Mary Anne\r\nAshley, daughter of the Earl of Shaftesbury, whom he had married in\r\n1788. The damages were small because Sturt himself had had an intrigue\r\nwith Madame Krumholz, a famous harpist. Sturt’s sister, and he himself\r\ndoubtless, had known Madame Dubarry on her visit to London in search of\r\nher stolen jewels. His nephew and namesake was an eminent Australian\r\nexplorer. His grandson was in 1876 created Lord Alington.\r\n\r\nThe brothers Thellusson were sons of the Swiss merchant Pierre\r\nThellusson, who settled in England, married in 1761 Anne Woodford\r\nof Southampton, and died in 1797, leaving a strange will, by which\r\ntwo-thirds of his property was to accumulate until the death of his\r\nnine then living descendants for the benefit of the eldest male\r\ndescendant of his three sons. The sons disputed the will, but it\r\nwas pronounced valid, though an Act of 1800 prevented any similar\r\neccentricities. The testator’s object, moreover, deservedly failed,\r\nfor the litigation of 1856–1859 on the construction of the will\r\ndevoured a large portion of the inheritance, which meanwhile had not\r\ninordinately increased. In visiting Paris the Thellussons may have\r\nhoped to recover money due to their father, for he had been French\r\nConsul in London, and was denounced by John Oswald at the Jacobin\r\nClub on the 30th September 1792, on the authority of Paine and Frost,\r\nas a vilifier of the Revolution and a friend of Pitt. Thellusson,\r\nOswald alleged, had refused to forward consignments of arms to France.\r\nIf we are to believe a scurrilous pamphlet by Rutledge, Necker, who\r\nwas originally clerk to Thellusson’s brother George in Paris, made\r\nthe acquaintance of his future wife, Suzanne Curchod, through her\r\nbeing governess to the children of the Thellussons’ sister, Madame de\r\nVermeron. Fournier[49] suggests that the testator’s object was not for\r\nthe money to accumulate, but to meet the possible claims of descendants\r\nof guillotined Frenchmen who had intrusted funds to him; but this is\r\nobviously far-fetched. The eldest son, who did not visit Paris, was in\r\n1806 created Lord Rendlesham.\r\n\r\nThompson, if, as seems probable, the same man as the M.P. for Midhurst\r\n1807–1818, was the father of General Thomas Perronet Thompson, M.P.,\r\nthe free-trade orator. Tierney spent the summer and autumn of 1802 at\r\nBoulogne, but did not go on to Paris. One would have expected him,\r\nhowever, to search there for traces of his father, who died during the\r\nRevolution after thirty years’ residence in that capital. Tyrrwhitt\r\nwas secretary to the Prince of Wales, and was afterwards Usher of the\r\nBlack Rod. He was knighted in 1814. Villiers, eventually third Earl of\r\nClarendon, was famous for telling long-winded stories. He was Envoy\r\nto Portugal from 1808 to 1810, and was uncle to the diplomatist of\r\nour own time. On his honeymoon in 1791, on his way to Rome, he saw\r\nthe French king and queen dine in public at the Tuileries. Coulson\r\nWalhope, son of the Earl of Portsmouth, was on his honeymoon trip,\r\nfrom which, as we shall see, he never returned. Sir Thomas Wallace had\r\npreviously visited Italy. He subsequently held various public posts,\r\nand in 1828 became Lord Wallace. Wyndham was brother of Lord Egremont;\r\nhis other brother William, ambassador at Florence, had visited Paris\r\nin 1791. Lord Yarmouth, son and successor of the Marquis of Hertford,\r\nwas destined to be depicted in _Vanity Fair_ as Lord Steyne and\r\nin _Coningsby_ as Lord Monmouth. He had in 1798 married Maria\r\nFagniani, putative daughter of John Baptist Fagniani. Her paternity was\r\nclaimed both by George Selwyn and the Marquis of Queensberry, commonly\r\nknown as ‘Old Q.’ The latter bequeathed his property to Lord and Lady\r\nYarmouth, a codicil which reduced the amount to £250,000 being declared\r\ninvalid.\r\n\r\nEight of these M.P.’s, Erskine, Fitzpatrick, Francis, Jekyll, St. John,\r\nWilliam Smith, Lord R. Spencer, and Thompson had voted with Fox in 1794\r\nfor peace with France.\r\n\r\nSeveral ex-M.P.’s may be here mentioned. Passing over Beckford,\r\nof whom we shall speak hereafter, there was Philip Champion de\r\nCrespigny, King’s Proctor, who sat for Sudbury in 1796. Sir Harry\r\nFeatherstonehaugh had sat in two Parliaments for Portsmouth. Sir\r\nAbraham Hume, an F.R.S., had represented Petersfield from 1774 to 1780.\r\nHe collected old paintings, fossils, and minerals, and ultimately\r\npublished a biography of Titian. Sir Elijah Impey, ex-Chief-Justice of\r\nBengal, had sat for New Romney in 1790. He was solicitous of recovering\r\nmoney invested in the French funds, and Madame Grand is said to have\r\nwelcomed his arrival as likely to facilitate proof of the divorce\r\nrequired for her marriage to Talleyrand, for Impey had tried Grand’s\r\nsuit against her. Sir John Ingilby was elected for East Retford in\r\n1781. Temple Luttrell, who sat for Melbourne Port from 1774 to 1780,\r\nwas son of Lord Irnham and brother to the Earl of Carhampton. His\r\nsister Anne, widow of Christopher Horton, had married the Duke of\r\nCumberland, so that when Luttrell was arrested at Boulogne in 1793 he\r\nwas styled George III.’s brother-in-law. In 1789, as a member of the\r\nJamaica Council, he drew up a remonstrance to Parliament against the\r\nsuppression of the slave-trade. He had shown more enlightenment in the\r\nHouse of Commons in advocating conciliation to the American colonies\r\nand in predicting their indomitable resistance. Matthew Montagu, nephew\r\nand heir of the great society leader Elizabeth Montagu (_née_\r\nRobinson), to whose gatherings the term blue-stocking was first\r\napplied, had sat in Parliament from 1786 to 1790 and was destined to\r\nre-enter it in 1806. In 1820 he succeeded his brother as Lord Rokeby.\r\nRichard Oliver had in 1790 represented the County Limerick, for which\r\nhis son now sat; we shall hear of him again. William Maule Ramsay,\r\nyounger son of the Earl of Dalhousie, regained his seat in Parliament\r\nin 1805. In 1831 he was created Lord Panmure, and afterwards succeeded\r\nhis cousin in the title of Lord Dalhousie. We shall hear of him, too,\r\nagain. Henry Seymour, a kinsman of the Duke of Somerset, had been the\r\npenultimate lover of Madame Dubarry.[50] He arrived with his daughter\r\nGeorgina, widow of Comte de Durfort, as early as the 1st November\r\n1801, but did not think it necessary or feasible, it seems, to claim\r\nthe restitution of his private papers, confiscated on his flight in\r\n1792. Even if he had claimed them he would have missed a bundle of\r\nMadame Dubarry’s love-letters, which had somehow been abstracted, and\r\nwas discovered many years afterwards in a Paris bookstall. Possibly\r\nhaving been registered as an _émigré_, as though a foreigner could\r\nlogically be so treated, he feared that to claim his papers might have\r\nentailed a denial of his right to revisit France. His French wife, whom\r\nhe had dismissed on good grounds, was probably the ‘Lady’ Seymour who\r\nin 1806 was living on a handsome income at Cleves. Sir Robert Smyth,\r\nwho had been unseated at Cardigan in 1775, but had sat for Colchester\r\nin 1785–1790, had, like Luttrell, suffered imprisonment in Paris during\r\nthe Revolution, but through Paine, with whom his wife corresponded\r\nwhile he was in prison, had in 1796 obtained a passport for Hamburg.\r\nHe now returned to Paris to open a bank, but making a journey back to\r\nLondon he suddenly died there in April 1802.\r\n\r\nProspective M.P.’s may here be mentioned. There was Lord Althorp,\r\nwho, just of age, was sent by his father Earl Spencer, the great\r\nbibliophile, to France and Italy in order to cease running into\r\ndebt and to acquire polish; but he refused to go into Continental\r\nsociety, was bored by pictures, and came home as unmannerly as ever,\r\nwithout having even learned French. He nevertheless developed into a\r\nprominent Whig statesman, and was Chancellor of the Exchequer in the\r\nGrey Cabinet. His accession to the Upper House in 1835 gave William\r\nIV. a pretext for dismissing the ministry. He then retired\r\ninto private life. Alexander Baring, son of Sir Francis and afterwards\r\nLord Ashburton, sat in the House of Commons from 1806 to 1835, was\r\nPresident of the Board of Trade in 1834, and in 1842 negotiated\r\nthe Maine Boundary Treaty with America. A Mr. Benyon was probably\r\nBenjamin Benyon, M.P. for Stafford in 1819. Lord Blayney, who in 1806\r\nwas returned for Old Sarum, was shortly destined to revisit France\r\nagainst his will. Sir Charles Burrell, another visitor, was elected in\r\nthe same year for Shoreham. Arthur Harrington Champernowne, elected\r\nfor Saltash in 1806, was a friend of Samuel Rogers. Cæsar Colclough,\r\nwho, imprisoned in 1793–1794,[51] had apparently remained in France,\r\nbecame in 1818 M.P. for Wexford. William Congreve, the inventor of the\r\nrocket bearing his name, became in 1812 member for Gatton, and in\r\n1814 succeeded to his father’s baronetcy. Sir Arthur Chichester sat\r\nfor Carrickfergus in 1812. General Sir Charles Grogan Craufurd, son\r\nof Sir Alexander and nephew of Quintin Craufurd, translated Tieck’s\r\n_History of the Seven Years’ War_, and in 1800 had married the\r\nDowager-Duchess of Newcastle. Sent as Commissioner to the Austrian\r\narmy, he was wounded, and resigned his post in favour of his brother\r\nRobert, M.P. for East Retford in 1806. He died in 1821.\r\n\r\nLord Duncannon, who in 1844 succeeded his father as Earl of\r\nBessborough, but in 1802 was only just of age, supported Catholic\r\nEmancipation, introduced O’Connell to the House of Commons when he\r\nrefused to take the oath, and helped to frame the Reform Bill. In\r\n1831 he was Commissioner of Woods and Forests; in 1834 he was called\r\nup to the Lords, and from 1846 till his death in 1848 he was Lord\r\nLieutenant of Ireland. Robert Ferguson of Raith was a Scottish member\r\nin 1806–1807 and again in 1831–1841. Of him we shall hear, not to his\r\ncredit. Hudson Gurney, a Norwich banker, of a famous Quaker family, had\r\nan uncle Bartlett Gurney, F.S.A., who in 1796 all but defeated Windham\r\nat Norwich. Bartlett had turned Unitarian, but in 1803 was buried with\r\nthe Quakers. Hudson also renounced Quakerism, or rather Quakerism\r\nrenounced him, on account of his contributing to the war patriotic fund\r\nof 1804, yet friendly relations were afterwards revived. He sat in six\r\nparliaments, and died in 1864 at the age of eighty-nine. I remember\r\nseeing him as a corpulent old man, who had to be lifted in and out of\r\nhis carriage.\r\n\r\nWilliam Haldimand, son of a Swiss merchant settled in London, was so\r\nprecocious a financier that at twenty-five years of age--seven years\r\nafter his Paris visit--he became a director of the Bank of England.\r\nHis brother, who accompanied him, apparently died young. William\r\nrepresented Ipswich from 1820 to 1826. He was munificent in his gifts\r\nto charities and to the Greek war of liberation. In 1828 he retired\r\nto Lausanne, and on his death in 1862 bequeathed most of his property\r\nto a blind asylum there. His sister was Mrs. Marcet, the friend of\r\nSydney Smith, and well known as a populariser of science and political\r\neconomy. Hugh Hamersley, M.P. for Helston in 1812, will come under\r\nanother category. Richard Heber, elder brother of the bishop, and a\r\ngreat book-collector, was member for Oxford University from 1821 to\r\n1826. Sir Thomas Liddell, elected for Durham in 1806, became Lord\r\nRavensworth and father of a Dean of Christchurch. James Mackintosh, who\r\nin 1813, on his return from Bombay, where he had been recorder, was\r\nelected for Nairn, and retained the seat till his death in 1832, was\r\nthe author of the famous answer to Burke. Napoleon, unaware that he had\r\nsince ‘abhorred, abjured, and for ever renounced the French Revolution,\r\nthe greatest scourge of the world, and the chief stain upon human\r\nannals,’ complimented Mackintosh on his pamphlet,--or rather intended\r\nto have done so--for the order of presentations having been altered he\r\naddressed the compliment to some other Englishman. Shortly after his\r\nreturn Mackintosh defended Peltier, prosecuted for libelling Napoleon.\r\nViscount Maitland, afterwards Earl of Lauderdale, was returned for\r\nCamelford in 1806. William (afterwards Sir William) Oglander sat for\r\nBodmin. Viscount Ossulston sat for Berwick in 1820. Samuel Romilly,\r\nwho in 1806 became Solicitor-General and M.P. for Queensborough, was\r\nthe great advocate of the mitigation of the penal code, so as to limit\r\ncapital punishment to cases of murder. He had seen Paris in August\r\n1789. Sir William Rowley represented Suffolk in 1812, Sir Thomas\r\nTurton, Southwark in 1810–1820, and Sir Walter Stirling, St. Ives in\r\n1807. William Young, whose father wrote a history of Athens, sat for\r\nSt. Mawes and became Governor of Tobago.\r\n\r\nThere was a perfect swarm of peers and peers’ sons;[52] the elderly\r\nor middle-aged anxious to see how Paris looked after the Revolution,\r\nthe younger eager to make acquaintance with it. Some, moreover, were\r\non their way to Italy, for Lemaitre found at Naples, in February\r\n1803, Lords Aberdeen, Mount Cashell, Grantham, Althorp, Brooke, and\r\nBeverley, besides Sir Charles Douglas, Sir Thomas Tancred, and the\r\nCheshire Egertons, with Lady Hester Stanhope in their charge. The\r\nDowager-Duchess of Cumberland, whose marriage led to the Royal Marriage\r\nAct, a widow since 1790, was also on her way to Nice, but stayed a\r\nmonth in Paris for medical advice. According to the _Times_ she\r\npaid a hundred guineas a month for second-rate apartments, and not\r\nhaving been presented at the Court of St. James’s was not received by\r\nMadame Bonaparte, although previously to the Revolution she had been\r\ntreated at Metz as a royal personage.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Bedford interests us chiefly as the father of Lord John\r\nRussell, then a boy of eleven, who was left behind with his two\r\nbrothers at school. The Duke was not a stranger to France. In March\r\n1788 he and his wife, the latter on the verge of her confinement,\r\nwere staying at Montpellier and waiting for that event. Her father,\r\nViscount Torrington, who was apparently living in Paris, wrote to Louis\r\nXVI.’s Minister of the Household to ask what should be done\r\nto certify the expected birth. This was of some importance, for the\r\ntraveller’s elder brother was unlikely to marry. The Minister advised\r\nhim to call in two local notaries, adding that it might be well to get\r\na certificate also from the British Embassy at Paris.[53] The child was\r\nborn on the 13th May, and became heir to the Duke of Bedford, for his\r\nfather had in March 1802 succeeded his brother, who bequeathed £5000\r\nto Fox. He had learned French when a youth at Orleans, together with\r\nthe Duke of Cleveland, and the Duke of Dorset then took them both to\r\nVersailles, where Marie Antoinette played billiards with them. Both\r\nwent on to Rome where they went to Cardinal York’s weekly receptions.\r\nSir Harry Featherstonehaugh was now his travelling companion. The\r\nDuke’s arrival on the 20th April 1803 was considered a sign of the\r\nduration of peace, but he apparently went over to fetch the Duchess\r\nof Gordon and her daughter Lady Georgina, whom he, a widower since\r\nOctober 1801, took for his second wife five weeks after his return.\r\nGeorgina had been engaged to his deceased brother, who left her a\r\nlock of his hair, and her mother made her go into mourning for him,\r\nsaying, ‘It is a feather in a girl’s cap to have been intended for\r\nthe Duke of Bedford.’[54] The Duchess was reported to have said that\r\nshe hoped to see Napoleon breakfast in Ireland, dine in London, and\r\nsup at Gordon Castle, but this is a manifest invention. There may be\r\nmore truth in the story that she obtained recruits in 1794 for her\r\nson’s Highland regiment (now the 2nd Gordon Highlanders) by placing\r\na shilling between her lips to be kissed by them, yet this seems a\r\nvariation of the Duchess of Devonshire’s kiss to a Westminster elector.\r\nShe died in 1812. As for her daughter Georgina, who had an illness in\r\nParis, she was a great dancer, and frequently danced, as Napoleon told\r\nLord Ebrington at Elba in 1814, with his step-son Eugène Beauharnais.\r\nThe _Times_, indeed, insinuated that she set her cap at the\r\nstep-father himself. ‘It is certain,’ said that journal on the 12th\r\nJanuary 1803,\r\n\r\n   ‘that some of our travelling Nudes of Fashion intended to\r\n   conquer the Conqueror of the Continent. What glory would it\r\n   have brought to this Country, if it could have boasted of\r\n   giving a Mistress, or a Wife, to the First CONSUL. How\r\n   pretty would sound Lady G---- (we mean Lady GODIVA)\r\n   BONAPARTE?’\r\n\r\nWraxall’s story that the Duchess wanted to wed her daughter to Eugène\r\nis confirmed by Maurice Dupin, George Sand’s father, who met them at a\r\ndinner-party, and wrote to his mother that they were in love with each\r\nother, but that Napoleon would not listen to the match. Georgina, he\r\nadded, was reputed a beauty, but like Eugène lacked a good mouth and\r\nteeth.[55]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle, afterwards famous for justifying the eviction at\r\nNewark of forty tenants who refused to vote for his nominee by saying,\r\n‘May I not do what I will with my own?’ was destined to give Gladstone\r\nhis first seat in the House of Commons; which Gladstone, however,\r\nresigned in 1846 on joining Peel in free-trade. The Duke was yet only a\r\nyouth of seventeen, in charge of his step-father Sir Charles Craufurd,\r\nwho has been already mentioned. The Duke of Somerset deserves notice\r\nonly as the father of the Duke of our time, who was first Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty and an agnostic writer.\r\n\r\nThe Marchioness of Donegal was accompanied by her sisters Mary and\r\nPhilippa Godfrey, friends of Thomas Moore. The Marquis and Marchioness\r\nof Tweeddale (she was daughter of Lord Lauderdale) took with them their\r\nyoung son, Lord James Hay.\r\n\r\nOf the Earls, Aberdeen--Byron’s ‘travelled thane, Athenian\r\nAberdeen’--was the future Prime Minister of 1852. His six weeks in\r\nParis were said to have cost him £3000. Lady Bessborough had been\r\nat school at Versailles before the Revolution, and had been noticed\r\nby Marie Antoinette. Beverley, a son of the Duke of Northumberland,\r\nhad been created a peer in 1790. He had distinguished himself by his\r\ncourage during the riots of 1780, and we have already heard of his\r\nson. Cadogan had divorced his wife in 1796, so that she travelled\r\nby herself. Camelford had refused to illuminate for the peace, and\r\nhis house had consequently been sacked. He pretended in 1801 to be\r\nan American named Rushworth, but was arrested, and after some days\r\nexpelled. In March 1803 he again landed at Calais, but was discovered\r\nand apprehended, for he was said to have boasted in London that he\r\nwould kill Bonaparte. He wrote, however, from the Temple prison an\r\nabject letter to Napoleon, pleading that his mother would die if she\r\nheard of his arrest. He also threw out of the window a letter to\r\nLord Grenville, which the picker-up was requested to forward, but it\r\nwas intercepted. He was sent to Boulogne and shipped to England.[56]\r\nJackson was afraid of his committing suicide, so that he must have\r\nshown symptoms of the mental derangement which led in 1804 to a fatal\r\nduel with Captain Best. He was reputed to be the best shot in England.\r\nCarhampton had in 1796 been commander-in-chief in Ireland. It was\r\nreported that incensed at having, in company with other English, to\r\nwait three hours in an anteroom without chairs, before being received\r\nby Talleyrand, he went next day to the Tuileries in colonel’s uniform\r\nwithout epaulettes. Bonaparte asked him therefore whether he was a\r\nmilitia officer. ‘No,’ he proudly replied. ‘Then what is your rank in\r\nthe army?’ ‘I was Commander-in-Chief when the French army under General\r\nHoche endeavoured to land in Ireland.’[57] It was scarcely fair of\r\nCarhampton thus to retaliate on Napoleon for Talleyrand’s discourtesy.\r\n\r\nCavan had just returned from Egypt, where he had commanded a division\r\nunder Abercromby. The Cholmondeleys had been in Paris in 1791, their\r\nson and heir being born there. We shall hear presently of their\r\nequipages. The Countess (afterwards Marchioness) Conyngham is notorious\r\nfor her _liaison_ with George IV. Egremont was long a prominent figure\r\nin London society, but is more deserving of notice as one of the\r\nearliest patrons of Turner the artist. Elgin, of marble fame, was on\r\nhis way home from the Constantinople embassy. We shall have to speak\r\nhereafter of his wife and her paramour Ferguson. Fife, afterwards a\r\ndistinguished general in the Peninsular War, wounded at Talavera and\r\nCadiz, was great-uncle of the present Duke of Fife. Fitzwilliam had in\r\n1794 been Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, where his three months’ rule was\r\nlooked back to with regret. Lady Granard, sister of the Earl of Moira,\r\non her honeymoon in 1780 had seen Cardinal York, and had also witnessed\r\na review by Frederic II. Guilford was the son of the Lord North who\r\nlost us our American colonies. He stayed seven months, and would have\r\nremained longer but for the rupture.\r\n\r\nLady Kenmare (Mary, daughter of Michael Aylmer) was known for her\r\nSunday evening receptions in London, and for a romantic story of her\r\nhusband’s attachment to her before his first wife’s death, or even\r\nbefore his first marriage. A Gerald Aylmer, who also visited Paris,\r\nwas probably her kinsman. The Countess of Kingston, who must not be\r\nconfused with the Duchess of Kingston, the notorious bigamist, was\r\naccompanied by two unmarried daughters, probably also by her other\r\ndaughter, Lady Mount Cashell. One of these daughters had in 1798 been\r\nthe occasion of a duel in which her brother shot his adversary. Lady\r\nLanesborough, daughter of the Earl of Belvedere, had, as we shall\r\nsee, found a second and plebeian husband. Lauderdale had witnessed\r\nand sympathised with the Revolution, Dr. (father of Sir John) Moore\r\nthen accompanying him as physician. His Whig opinions had made him\r\nlose his seat as a Scottish representative peer in the House of Lords,\r\nand his anxiety for the maintenance of peace made Whitworth shut\r\nhis door to him as one of ‘our rascally countrymen.’[58] His son,\r\nmoreover, a youth of eighteen, styled himself ‘citizen’ Maitland.[59]\r\nMinto, the Gilbert Elliot who, ward of David Hume, was at school\r\nwith Mirabeau, and was consequently sent over in 1790 to bribe him\r\ninto keeping France neutral in our threatened quarrel with Spain\r\nover Nootka Sound, had been Governor of Corsica. He was one of the\r\nearliest visitors, was on his way home from the Vienna Embassy, and was\r\ndestined to be Viceroy of India. Mount Edgecumbe was an amateur actor\r\nand musical composer. His wife,[60] with their young daughter Emma\r\nSophia, afterwards Countess Brownlow and writer of _Reminiscences of\r\na Septuagenarian_, had previously been to Spa, where she met the\r\nDuchess of Gordon, the Conynghams, the Bradfords, Charles and Lady\r\nCharlotte Greville, and Dudley and Lady Susan Ryder. She had a serious\r\nillness in Paris. Lord Oxford had a great admiration for Napoleon\r\nand also for Murat. His wife, who required change of climate, was\r\nvery handsome, though not rivalling Madame Tallien. Pembroke was the\r\nfather of Sidney Herbert, the statesman of our time, and in 1806 was\r\nAmbassador at Vienna. He stayed three months, and being an excellent\r\nobserver and a patient listener, his account of Paris was eagerly\r\nsought for. Shaftesbury, uncle of the philanthropist of our day, took\r\nhis wife, a daughter of Sir John Webb, and their daughter. Winchilsea\r\nwas the father of the fanatical Orangeman who in 1829 fought a duel,\r\non account of Catholic Emancipation, with Wellington, but happily\r\nwithout bloodshed. Viscount Falkland, less fortunate, was killed in\r\na duel in 1809. Viscountess Maynard was the notorious Nancy Parsons\r\nwhom Lord Maynard had married in 1766, in spite of her antecedents.\r\nShe had been a widow since 1775, and had been the mistress of the late\r\nDuke of Bedford, who, by his will, continued his annuity to her of\r\n£2000. Lord Monck, who took over his wife and two daughters, was the\r\ngrandfather of the Viceroy of Canada. He died shortly after his return,\r\nin June 1802. Viscount Strangford was afterwards Ambassador at Lisbon,\r\nStockholm, Constantinople, and St. Petersburg, and translated Camoëns’\r\n_Lusiad_. Moore, Rogers, and Croker were among his friends.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the lowest grade of the peerage. Barrington, leaving a\r\nwife behind, but taking a mistress with him, probably went, from what\r\nwe afterwards hear, to escape his English creditors; but we shall find\r\nthat he got into debt in France. Blayney has been already mentioned\r\namong prospective M.P.’s, for, being an Irish peer like Palmerston, he\r\nwas eligible for the Lower House. Cahir, who crossed over as early as\r\nJune 1801, was afterwards created Earl of Glengall; he remained till\r\nApril 1802. Invitations to Madame Bonaparte’s receptions were commonly\r\nobtained through his wife’s good offices. Lady Carington was the wife\r\nof one of Pitt’s banker peers. There was a rumour that Pitt intended\r\nto marry her eldest daughter. It was her grandson who, in 1872, having\r\nhorsewhipped Grenville Murray on the steps of the Reform Club on\r\naccount of a scurrilous article on his family in _Broad Arrow_,\r\nwas convicted of assault at Clerkenwell sessions, but was simply bound\r\nover to keep the peace. Murray shortly afterwards became an outlaw.\r\nCloncurry in 1859 published his reminiscences. He was accompanied by\r\nhis three sisters, of whom more anon. He dined with Napoleon, and made\r\nacquaintance with Kosciusko, Helen Williams, and Madame Récamier.\r\nHe invited the two Emmets to dinner the day before Robert’s return\r\nto Ireland, from which he could not be dissuaded. Cloncurry in the\r\nwinter of 1802 proceeded to Italy, where he presented a telescope to\r\nCardinal York, who gave him one of his medals, and he returned home\r\nafter the rupture by way of Germany.[61] Lady Crofton, widow of Sir\r\nThomas Crofton, was a baroness in her own right. Her daughter Frances\r\naccompanied her. Grantham, who was on his way to Italy, in 1833\r\nsucceeded his aunt in the De Grey earldom. He was first Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty in 1834–1835, and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1841–1844,\r\nwas a collector of sculptures, was President of the Institution of\r\nBritish Architects, and published _Characteristics of the Duke\r\nof Wellington_. He was uncle of the present Marquis of Ripon,\r\nex-Viceroy of India. Holland, who had seen Paris in 1791, protested in\r\n1815 against Napoleon’s captivity at St. Helena, and Lady Holland, the\r\ndivorced wife of Sir Godfrey Webster, forwarded the prisoner books,\r\nin gratitude for which kindness Napoleon sent her an antique diamond\r\npresented to him by the Pope. Lady Holland’s receptions were afterwards\r\nfamous. Hutchinson had succeeded Sir Ralph Abercromby in Egypt. On his\r\nbrother’s death he became Earl of Donoughmore. In the autumn of 1789\r\nhe had applied at Paris for an escort to go and rejoin his family near\r\nAmiens, disturbances having broken out there, but was told that order\r\nhad been restored. He was Lafayette’s aide-de-camp from 1789 to 1792.\r\nNorthwick was an art connoisseur. Stawell was Surveyor of Customs for\r\nthe Port of London.\r\n\r\nOf the eldest sons or other successors of peers, Eardley deserves\r\nnotice on account of the history of his family. Sampson Gideon, a\r\nPortuguese Jew, made a fortune in London, and as a reward for financial\r\nservices obtained a baronetcy, not for himself, for a Jew was then\r\ndeemed ineligible, but for his son, then at Eton, at the age of\r\nfifteen. That son, Sampson the second, was brought up a Christian by\r\nhis English mother, and was nicknamed ‘Mr. Pitt’s Jew.’ In 1789 he was\r\nmade an Irish peer as Lord Eardley, a title explained by his having\r\nmarried, in 1766, Maria, the daughter of Sir John Eardley Wilmot,\r\nChief-Justice of the Common Pleas. He was elected first for Coventry\r\nand afterwards for Wallingford, but retired in 1802. He had two sons,\r\nSampson and William; the former was the visitor to Paris, but both\r\ndied before their father, with whom the peerage expired in 1824. His\r\nthree daughters married Lord Say and Sele, Sir Culling Smith, M.P.,\r\nand Colonel Childers. Childers, the well-known member of the Gladstone\r\nCabinet, was doubly descended from Pitt’s Jew, for his father was an\r\nEardley Childers, and his mother a Culling Smith. Colonel Molesworth\r\nwas drowned with his wife on his way to the Cape in 1815.\r\n\r\nThe younger sons of peers comprised Arthur Annesley (son of Viscount\r\nAnnesley), Lord William Bentinck, afterwards Viceroy of India (Duke of\r\nPortland), William Brodrick (Viscount Midleton), Lord John Campbell\r\n(Duke of Argyll), Lord George Cavendish (Duke of Devonshire), Robert\r\nClifford (Lord Clifford), Colonel Robert Clive (Lord Clive), Edward\r\nSpencer Cowper (Earl Cowper), Keppel Craven (Lord Craven), Francis\r\nCust (Earl Brownlow), Henry Dillon (Viscount Dillon), Lord Robert\r\nStephen Fitzgerald (Duke of Leinster), Lord Archibald Hamilton (Duke of\r\nHamilton), William Hill (Lord Berwick), John King (Lord King), George\r\nKnox (Lord Northland), Lord Frederic Montagu (Duke of Manchester),\r\nAugustus John Francis Moreton (Earl of Ducie), Arthur Paget (Lord\r\nUxbridge), Henry Pierrepont (Viscount Newark), Lord Arthur Somerset\r\n(Duke of Beaufort), John Talbot (Baroness Talbot de Malahide), and John\r\nTrevor (Viscount Hampden). Charles James Fox, Edward Paget, General\r\nFitzpatrick, Lord Robert Spencer, and Charles Wyndham, have been\r\nalready mentioned as M.P.’s.\r\n\r\nThere were also several daughters of peers. Lady Elizabeth Foster,\r\nwidow of John Thomas Foster, M.P., was daughter of the Earl of\r\nBristol, and there were strange stories of her relations with the\r\nDuke of Devonshire. According to the generally accepted version[62]\r\nthe Duchess, famous in election annals, was forced by her parents, at\r\nsixteen years of age, to marry the Duke, though she was in love with\r\nthe Duke of Hamilton, who killed himself in despair. She refused,\r\nhowever, to allow him the rights of a husband, and Lady Elizabeth\r\nFoster, living harmoniously with them, had several children by the\r\nDuke, who were brought up under an assumed name. In 1789, however, the\r\nDuchess losing £100,000 at play at Spa, the Duke went over and paid\r\nher debts on condition of consummating the marriage. The result was\r\nthe birth of a son and heir at Paris in January 1790. The Duchess died\r\nin 1806, and three years afterwards Lady Elizabeth agreed to marry\r\nthe widower. Gainsborough painted her as Lady Foster in the picture\r\nmysteriously stolen in London in 1875 and recovered in America in\r\n1900. She was now accompanied to Paris by her legitimate son, Augustus\r\nJohn Foster, who was just of age. In 1811 he was sent as Envoy to\r\nWashington, in 1814 to Copenhagen, and in 1824 to Turin. In 1831 he\r\nreceived a baronetcy. Lady Isabel Style, daughter of Lord Powerscourt,\r\nand widow since 1774 of Sir Charles Style, had been a prisoner in\r\nFrance in 1793, and now revisited France. Lady Anne Saltmarsh was\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Fingall. Lady Hester Stanhope, daughter of Earl\r\nStanhope, who was not yet her uncle Pitt’s housekeeper, was, to avoid a\r\nstepmother, travelling with the Egertons, probably Sir Peter Warburton\r\nEgerton.\r\n\r\nThere was also Lady Mary Whaley, _née_ Lawless, the widow since\r\n1800 of an Irish M.P., nicknamed Jerusalem Whaley, for, having said\r\nin joke that he was going to Jerusalem, he won a bet (of £15,000 it\r\nis said) that he would really go thither. At sixteen years of age\r\nthis Thomas Whaley, inheriting £15,000 from his father, was sent to\r\nParis with a ‘bear-leader’ to learn French. He there bought a town and\r\ncountry house, kept a pack of hounds, entertained company, and gambled,\r\nlosing £14,000 at a sitting. He returned to Ireland, compounded with\r\nhis creditors, and squandered the Jerusalem bet money. He revisited\r\nParis in 1791, and witnessed the King’s return from Varennes. He became\r\na cripple for life by jumping from a drawing-room window on to the\r\nroof of a passing hackney-coach, or, as we should now say, cab.[63]\r\nHe gambled at Newmarket, Brighton, and London, and eventually settled\r\nin the Isle of Man, where he brought up an illegitimate family.[64]\r\nHe married, in January 1800, Lady Mary Catherine Lawless, daughter\r\nof Lord Cloncurry, but died in the following November. His widow\r\nlived till 1831. She was accompanied by her sister, Lady Valentia\r\nLawless, who afterwards married Sir Francis Burton, Lord Conyngham’s\r\nhalf-brother, and by Lady Charlotte, who became Lady Dunsany. There\r\nwas likewise a Lady Giffard, probably Lady Charlotte Courtenay,\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Devon, who in 1788 had married Thomas Giffard\r\nof Chillington, Staffordshire. Lady Charlotte Greville, _née_\r\nCharlotte Bentinck, daughter of the Duke of Portland, was there with\r\nher husband Charles Greville, father of the diarist. Miss Caroline\r\nVernon, maid of honour to the Queen, was a daughter of Lord Vernon and\r\ndied in 1815. Lady Catherine Beauclerk was daughter of the Duke of St\r\nAlbans.\r\n\r\nThe baronets included, besides several already mentioned, William Call,\r\nJohn Chichester, Simon Clark, John Coghill, William Cooper, James\r\nCraufurd, Herbert Croft, Thomas Clavering, Michael Cromie, George\r\nDallas, James De Bathe, Beaumont Dixie, N. Dukinfield, Alexander Grant,\r\nJohn Honywood, John Hope, John Ingilby, William James, Richard Jodrell,\r\nThomas Lavie, John Morshead, George Prescott, George Shipley, Charles\r\nTalbot, Thomas Tancred, Grenville Temple, Henry Tichborne, Thomas Webb,\r\nRobert John Wilmot, and Charles Wolseley.\r\n\r\nSome of these will be mentioned hereafter. At present we need speak\r\nonly of Sir Charles Wolseley, who, like Sir Francis Burdett, boxed the\r\npolitical compass. He witnessed, and apparently took part in, the\r\ncapture of the Bastille. In 1819 the Birmingham Radicals nominated\r\nhim their so-called ‘legislatorial attorney,’ and in the following\r\nyear he was sentenced to eighteen months’ imprisonment for a seditious\r\nspeech at Stockport. He ultimately gave up political life, embraced\r\nCatholicism in 1837, and died in 1846.\r\n\r\nThen there were also sons of baronets: William Abdy, who succeeded to\r\nthe title in July 1803, Ashby Apreece, who predeceased his father in\r\n1807, Alexander Don, Charles Jerningham, Raymond Pelly, John Wombwell,\r\nformerly a merchant at Alicante, Ralph Woodford, afterwards Governor of\r\nBermuda, John Broughton, and William Oglander, who, already mentioned,\r\nsucceeded to the title in 1806, while there were two future baronets,\r\nThomas Hare and Charles Cockerell.\r\n\r\nNext to legislators and aristocrats, military men were the most\r\nnumerous class of visitors. Some passed through Paris on their way home\r\nfrom Egypt, which had just been evacuated, and others were actuated\r\nnot so much by curiosity or love of dissipation as by professional\r\nduty, for they did not know how soon they might not have to encounter\r\nBonaparte’s legions. Of this swarm of visitors I can only mention a\r\nfew. There were the two sons of Sir Ralph Abercromby, who had been\r\nkilled at Alexandria. The elder was General George already mentioned,\r\nwho, eventually succeeding his mother in the peerage, became Lord\r\nAbercromby. The younger, Colonel Sir John, served with distinction, but\r\ndied at forty-four years of age without reaching the highest grade.\r\nSir Charles Ashworth became a general. Captain Benjamin Bathurst,\r\nson of the Bishop of Norwich, then eighteen years of age, was the\r\ndiplomatist who in 1809 mysteriously disappeared on returning from a\r\nmission to Vienna. Napoleon was accused of having him murdered, but the\r\nprobability is that he was killed for the sake of his valuables by the\r\nostler of a German inn who was afterwards unaccountably affluent. His\r\ndaughter Rose, at the age of seventeen, was drowned at Rome in 1824 by\r\nher horse slipping backwards into the Tiber, and his brother in a race\r\nat Rome was killed by a fall from his horse. Three disasters in one\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bosville, commonly styled Colonel, though he had only been a\r\nlieutenant in the Guards, must be ranked with soldiers for want of any\r\nother suitable category, though he was more wit than soldier. He had,\r\nhowever, served in the American War. He dined every Sunday with Horne\r\nTooke, and, as we have seen, accompanied Sir F. Burdett, whose election\r\nhe had zealously promoted. He dressed like a courtier of George II.’s\r\ntime. He visited Cobbett in prison and presented him with £1000. Paine,\r\non reaching the United States, sent a message to ‘my good friend\r\nBosville.’ Francis Burke, who had been in the Franco-Irish brigade,\r\nbecame a British general.\r\n\r\nGeneral James Callender had served in the Seven Years’ War and had been\r\nSecretary to the Paris Embassy under the Duke of Dorset, who, on his\r\nrecall in October 1789, deputed him to wind up his accounts. He had\r\nmore recently been Inspector-General at Naples, and had been sent by\r\nNelson to the Ionian Islands, where he remained till the peace. While\r\nin Paris he made the acquaintance of a Madame Sassen, a German, and\r\non being detained he sent her to Scotland with a power of attorney,\r\nstyling her his beloved wife, to see after his affairs. When released,\r\nhowever, he denied having married her, and the Court of Session\r\ndeclared the marriage not proven, but awarded the lady £300 damages.\r\nThis latter decision was annulled by the House of Lords, and the lady\r\npassed the rest of her life in fruitless litigation. Callender, who\r\nmarried three times, died in 1832 at the age of eighty-seven. The\r\nFrench Police Register describes him, the reason why is not obvious,\r\nas a swindler. On succeeding in 1810 to the estates of his cousin, Sir\r\nAlexander Campbell, he assumed the baronetcy also, but without right\r\nto it.[65] General John Francis Cradock had served in India and in\r\nEgypt, was destined to serve in Spain, and in 1819 became Lord Howden.\r\nHe altered the spelling of his name to Caradoc. His son, aide-de-camp\r\nto Wellington in Paris in 1814, and afterwards military _attaché_\r\nat the Paris Embassy, there married in 1830 the widow of the Russian\r\nGeneral Bagration, an ex-mistress of Metternich. In July 1830 he\r\nwas deputed by the Duke of Orleans to follow the fugitive Charles\r\nX. and ask him to confide to him his grandson that he might\r\nbe proclaimed king. Charles was inclined to consent, but the child’s\r\nmother, the Duchess of Berri, dissuaded him, not thinking that her\r\nboy would be in safe keeping. On Caradoc reporting his failure Louis\r\nPhilippe accepted the crown.\r\n\r\nJames Ferrier, brother of Susan the novelist, had figured in the\r\nsiege of Seringapatam, and was questioned about it by Napoleon,\r\nalways interested in India, which he thought he should have conquered\r\nbut for Sir Sidney Smith and Acre. ‘When he speaks,’ Ferrier wrote\r\nhome to his sister, ‘he has one of the finest expressions possible.’\r\nGeneral Dalrymple had visited Paris in 1791. General Henry Edward Fox\r\nwas a brother of the great statesman. He was on his way home from\r\nEgypt, where he had refused to allow Lord Cavan to ship Cleopatra’s\r\nneedle.[66] Cavan had dug it out of the sand of centuries and set it\r\nupright, but Fox seems to have thought Cavan’s love of antiquities an\r\nabsurd craze, and the needle consequently had to wait seventy years\r\nfor transport to England. Afterwards Commander-in-Chief in Ireland,\r\nAmbassador at Palermo, and Governor of Portsmouth, Fox was accompanied\r\nby his son Stephen, also destined for diplomacy. General George\r\nHigginson, who married in 1825 a daughter of Lord Kilmorey, lived till\r\n1866, and his widow reached the age of ninety-eight, surviving till\r\n1890. General Baron Charles Hompesch was a Hanoverian in the English\r\nservice. Very shortsighted, in 1806 he brushed against a man named\r\nRichardson and two ladies in a London street, and a duel ensued, in\r\nwhich his antagonist was wounded. On his death in 1822, at the age of\r\nsixty-six, he could boast of having taken part in three sieges, seven\r\npitched battles, and thirteen minor engagements. Robert Lovelace,\r\nprobably a son of Robert Lovelace of Clapham, was reminded by Napoleon\r\nthat he bore the name of Richardson’s hero. Napoleon at eighteen\r\nhad devoured _Clarissa Harlowe_, but at St. Helena he found it\r\nunreadable.\r\n\r\nGeneral John Money served in America under Burgoyne, and not finding\r\nemployment at home had fought for the Belgian insurgents in 1788, had\r\njoined the French army in 1792, and had witnessed the capture of the\r\nTuileries. The German Œlsner, who met him at Verdun in October 1792,\r\ndescribes him as a thoroughly English Hotspur (_degenkopf_).[67]\r\nIn 1761, aide-de-camp to General Townshend, he was famed for standing\r\non a horse’s back without a saddle and then leaping with it at full\r\nspeed over a five-barred gate. Hyde Park was the scene of his feats of\r\nhorsemanship. He had a perilous balloon ascent in 1785, being nearly\r\ndrowned in the North Sea. George Monro, probably a son of Sir Harry\r\nMonro, M.P., was apparently the Captain George Monro who was sent\r\nto Paris in September 1792 to send reports after the suspension of\r\ndiplomatic relations.[68] He had to pretend to fraternise with the\r\nBritish Jacobins in Paris, but he became suspected and left in January\r\n1793. In 1796 he complained that though promised a handsome provision\r\nno fresh post had been conferred on him.[69] General George Morgan, who\r\nwent on to Nice, had been Commander-in-Chief in India, Sir Hildebrand\r\nOakes, afterwards Governor of Malta, had served in America and Egypt.\r\nCaptain Charles John O’Hara was doubtless one of the illegitimate sons\r\nof the general who should have married Mary Berry, and who was captured\r\nby the French at Toulon in 1793. Captain Samuel Owens was an equerry to\r\nGeorge III. Major William Norman Ramsay had served in Egypt,\r\nwas afterwards in the Peninsula, and was killed at Waterloo. Colonel\r\nJohn Rowley, of the Engineers, was an F.R.S. and inspector-general of\r\nfortifications. He became a general in 1821, and died in 1824. General\r\nSir Charles Shipley, a distinguished military engineer, became in 1813\r\nGovernor of Granada. Colonel Edward Stack, a native of Kerry, had\r\nserved in the Franco-Irish brigade before the Revolution, had been\r\naide-de-camp to Louis XV., and had accompanied Lafayette to\r\nAmerica. He was on board Paul Jones’s _Bonhomme Richard_ when it\r\ncaptured the _Serapis_. He belonged to the orders of St. Louis and\r\nCincinnatus. He joined the _émigrés_ at Coblentz, but afterwards\r\nentered the English army, in which he rose during his detention in\r\nFrance to be major-general. He was arrested as a spy in May 1803,\r\nbut was liberated on parole. If his age is correctly registered as\r\nforty-five in 1802, he was seventy-six at his death at Calais in 1833.\r\n\r\nCaptain Francis Tulloch, of the Artillery, had in singular\r\ncircumstances made the acquaintance of Chateaubriand. Converted to\r\nCatholicism in London in 1790 by the Abbé Nagot, he had been induced to\r\nresign his commission and to sail with Nagot and three other priests\r\nfrom St. Malo for Baltimore, in order to become a priest and settle\r\nin America. Chateaubriand, a fellow-passenger, remonstrated with him,\r\nurging that, however ardent a Catholic, he ought not to abandon his\r\nfamily and his profession. The young man seemed to listen to him,\r\nbut the priests recovered their ascendency, and on reaching port he\r\nleft with them, not even bidding Chateaubriand farewell. He must,\r\nnevertheless, have changed his purpose, for in 1802 he was still in\r\nthe army, and he eventually married and had seven children, two of\r\nwhom wedded French noblemen. In 1822 Tulloch renewed acquaintance with\r\nChateaubriand, then Ambassador at London. In 1827 there were family\r\ndifferences among his children, which gave rise to recriminatory\r\npamphlets. Lastly, there was John Alexander Woodford, son of Sir Ralph\r\nWoodford (afterwards Governor of Trinidad, Envoy to the Hanse towns,\r\nand to Denmark). He was apparently the Colonel Woodford who in 1815\r\nbegan digging up the bones of the killed at the battle of Agincourt,\r\nexciting such a commotion in the district that the French Government\r\nasked the Duke of Wellington to stop him.\r\n\r\nNaval officers had less inducement to visit Paris, yet a number of\r\nthem figure on the register. One of them, moreover, was a claimant to\r\na French dukedom. Philippe d’Auvergne, a Jersey man, son of a navy\r\nlieutenant, had been adopted in 1788 by the last Duc de Bouillon, a\r\ndescendant of Turenne, as a remote kinsman and heir (his only son being\r\nan idiot), in preference to nearer relations whom he disliked.[70]\r\nThe fascinating young sailor, whose elder brother had declined the\r\nheirship, lived with the old duke till the Revolution, when he rejoined\r\nthe English navy, and from his station at Montorgueil in Jersey\r\nsuperintended the despatch of men and money to assist the Chouans.\r\nThe duke having died in 1802, d’Auvergne now went over to try and\r\nrecover his confiscated estates, but the French Government arrested\r\nhim in September 1802 on the ground of his co-operation in the civil\r\nwar. If a French duke he was of course liable to punishment, but if\r\nstill or again a British subject he could not be prosecuted for the\r\nperformance of professional duties. Merry, his letter to whom was at\r\nfirst suppressed, claimed him as a British subject, and he was released\r\nafter about a week from the Temple but expelled. Major Dumaresq, a\r\nfellow Jersey man, had been arrested with him. D’Auvergne rose to be\r\nan admiral, but the Congress of Vienna rejected his pretensions to the\r\ndukedom. His romantic career ended in 1816 at the age of seventy-one.\r\nAdmiral Tollemache (afterwards Lord Huntingtower) had an adventure at\r\nParis. He was playing billiards when a French bully nudged his arm\r\nand spoilt his stroke. On the man doing this a second time Tollemache\r\npitched him out of the window and then, warned by the landlord, ran\r\nfor his life.[71] Other actual or prospective admirals included Sir\r\nEliab Harvey, who fought at Trafalgar, Francis Ommaney, William Hoste,\r\nRobert Dudley Oliver, John (afterwards Sir John) Talbot, John Temple,\r\nSir John West, Sir James Hawkins Whitshed, and Sir Edward Berry.\r\nNelson, on being condoled with by George III. on the loss of\r\nhis right arm, presented Berry as his right hand, and it was Berry who\r\ncaught him in his arms when wounded at the battle of the Nile.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting and tragic naval visitor was Captain John\r\nWesley Wright, an Irishman and secretary to Sir Sidney Smith. He had\r\nin 1796 been captured and imprisoned with Smith, and had escaped\r\nwith him by means of a forged order. He was sent in March 1803 as an\r\n_attaché_ to the Paris Embassy, albeit Whitworth pointed out to\r\nhis Government that this was a very injudicious selection. Whether he\r\nremained at the embassy till Whitworth’s departure is not clear, but in\r\nMay 1804 he was again captured off the coast, where he had been landing\r\nroyalist insurgents. He was consequently regarded as an accomplice\r\nof Georges in the conspiracy to assassinate Napoleon, and was again\r\nconfined in the Temple. Gravina, the Spanish Ambassador, interceded\r\nfor his being treated as a prisoner of war, but Napoleon replied that\r\nas a criminal he could not be exchanged for an honest French officer,\r\nthough he might be given up to the British Government to be dealt with\r\nas it chose, he being convinced that Lord Hawkesbury (afterwards Lord\r\nLiverpool) was alone responsible for having thrice landed conspirators\r\nagainst his life. This overture, if indeed it was an overture, came\r\nto nothing, and at Georges’ trial Wright was brought up as a witness.\r\nHe was threatened with sentence of death by court-martial if he\r\nrefused to give testimony, but he insisted on the status of a prisoner\r\nof war, responsible solely to his own Government for his acts. In\r\nOctober 1805 he attempted to escape, whereupon Napoleon ordered the\r\n‘wretched assassin’ to be immured in a cell in lieu of having the run\r\nof the building. On the 25th October he was found dead in his cell.\r\nHe seems to have been a religious man, and a few days before, on his\r\nmathematical instruments being taken from him, he had emphatically\r\nrepudiated resort to suicide. Moreover he had on the previous day\r\nordered three shirts and a French conversation book. The French\r\nGovernment, however, maintained that he had killed himself on hearing\r\nof the defeat and surrender of the Austrian army at Ulm. Sidney Smith,\r\non revisiting France after Waterloo, made minute inquiries, and all\r\nthe documents were shown him, but he could come to no positive result.\r\nLewis Goldsmith says he was told by Réal and Desmarets that Wright had\r\nbeen tortured like Pichegru in order to extract evidence from him, and\r\nconsequently could not have been released without this infamy committed\r\nby Fouché being exposed; but he was certainly not tortured prior to\r\nGeorges’ trial, and why should he have been tortured afterwards, or,\r\nif tortured, why should he have been allowed to live till October\r\n1805? Sidney Smith erected a monument over his tomb in Père Lachaise.\r\nIt had a long Latin inscription which, without directly accusing\r\nthe Napoleonic authorities, insinuated foul play, for it described\r\nSmith as ‘confined in the Temple, a prison infamous for its midnight\r\nmurders.’ Strange to say this monument is now undiscoverable, and the\r\ncemetery keepers deny that Wright is on their registers, yet the record\r\nof his interment was found and duly copied in 1814.[72] Mystery is thus\r\nadded to mystery.\r\n\r\nWilliam Sidney Smith, nephew of Sir Sidney, was captured along with\r\nWright and was sent to Verdun. His knowledge of French proved useful in\r\n1814, when on board the vessel which conveyed Napoleon to Elba.\r\n\r\nDiplomatists and other public functionaries took the opportunity of\r\nmaking acquaintance with France or French statesmen. Francis Drake,\r\nbearing the name of the Elizabethan hero, but claiming descent from\r\nan older family, had been at the Copenhagen legation, and was in\r\n1794 Minister at Genoa, whence he sent Grenville letters from Paris\r\nfurnished to him by the royalist agent d’Antraigues, who was then\r\nat Venice, and at first in the service of Spain; but the agency\r\nwas transferred to ‘Monsieur’ (afterwards Louis XVIII.),\r\nwho was living at Verona.[73] D’Antraigues employed correspondents\r\nor spies in Paris who, whether from credulity or knavery, sent him\r\nthe most fabulous stories written in sympathetic ink or in cipher.\r\nThe letters of which Drake thus received copies were published in\r\nthe second volume of the _Dropmore Papers_ of the Historical\r\nManuscripts Commission, where they were heralded with a flourish, but\r\ntheir worthlessness has been exposed by M. Aulard, the most competent\r\nFrench critic. This royalist agency in Paris was discovered in 1797,\r\nand on Napoleon’s advance into Italy Drake fled to Udine. Temporarily\r\nunemployed by the Foreign Office, Drake in 1802 seems to have visited\r\nnot only France but Italy. In 1803 he was Minister at Munich, and was\r\nenticed by Napoleon into dealings with Méhée de la Touche, a spy who\r\nsold himself to all parties and betrayed all. Méhée was for a time\r\na secretary to the Paris Commune and had a long career of trickery.\r\nNapoleon, always anxious to bring British diplomacy into ridicule, gave\r\norders that a suitable man should be found to entrap Drake, and Méhée\r\nanswered his purpose admirably. He pretended to give information of\r\npolitical feeling in France and to concert a royalist rising for the\r\noverthrow, if not for the kidnapping (a euphemism for assassination),\r\nof Napoleon. Drake advanced money to this pretended spy, who took all\r\nthe letters to Paris, where they were forthwith published, bringing\r\nodium and derision on the English Foreign Office. An attempt was also\r\nmade to capture Drake, as well as Spencer Smith, who was slightly\r\nimplicated; but he fled precipitately, and the Elector of Bavaria\r\nat the instance of Napoleon refused any longer to recognise him as\r\nenvoy. He had obviously broken the eleventh commandment, so vital in\r\ndiplomacy, ‘thou shalt not be found out,’ and neither he nor Spencer\r\nSmith was again sent abroad. Wickham, however, who had equally\r\ncommitted himself, became in 1802 Chief Secretary for Ireland, and\r\nwould have been sent as Envoy to Austria and Prussia, but that those\r\npowers, afraid of offending Napoleon, declined to receive him. He\r\nconsequently retired on a pension of £1800. English diplomacy was\r\nno match for Napoleon with his flagrant violation of traditions and\r\ncourtesies. Retiring to his Somerset home, Drake was highly esteemed\r\nby his neighbours; for his tombstone at St. Cuthbert’s, Wells, speaks\r\nof his integrity and firmness as a magistrate and as recorder of that\r\ncity.[74] He married a daughter of Sir Herbert Mackworth, an ancestor\r\nof the poet Mackworth Praed.\r\n\r\nAlexander Cockburn, consul at Hamburg, took the opportunity of visiting\r\nParis with his Creole wife, Yolande de Vignier, and his son, the future\r\nLord Chief-Justice, was born in France during this visit. Cockburn\r\nwas in 1825 appointed Minister to the Central American Republics.\r\nSir John Craufurd, another nephew of Quintin Craufurd, was Minister\r\nto Lower Saxony from 1795 to 1803. He had visited Paris in 1791, and\r\nhe now repeated his visit. We shall see that he stayed longer than\r\nhe liked and took French leave. Charles Richard Vaughan, afterwards\r\nknighted, made a tour in France and Germany, and then accompanied Sir\r\nCharles Stuart (ultimately Lord Stuart de Rothesay) to Spain, where\r\nhe wrote an account of the siege of Saragossa. He rejoined Stuart as\r\nSecretary at the Paris Embassy at the Restoration, and was eventually\r\nEnvoy to Washington. Arthur Paget, son of Lord Uxbridge, was one of\r\nthe earliest visitors, being allowed a passport through France in\r\nSeptember 1801 on his way to succeed Minto at Vienna. He reported to\r\nLord Hawkesbury that he found the roads much better than he expected\r\nand the land well cultivated, but the towns manufacturing silk and\r\nvelvet complained of bad trade, and peace with England was universally\r\ndesired. Bonaparte, he said, was generally liked, for people dreaded a\r\nrevolution, yet Sieyès, he was told at Vienna, had declared that the\r\nConsulate would not last through the winter.[75] George Stuart, his\r\nchief subordinate at Vienna, also visited Paris. Sir Robert Liston,\r\noriginally tutor to Gilbert and Hugh Elliot at Paris, and afterwards\r\nsecretary to the latter, was Ambassador in America from 1796 to 1802,\r\nwas afterwards sent to Holland and Turkey, and lived to the age of\r\nninety-three. Colonel Neil was Consul at Lisbon. We may also mention a\r\nfuture diplomatist, Charles (afterwards Sir Charles) Oakley, son of the\r\nex-Governor of Madras, who, when at the Washington legation, offered\r\nto marry Madame Patterson, and she was not then disinclined to accept\r\na suitable successor to Jerome Bonaparte. Those who were or had been\r\nin other departments of the public service included Thomas Steele,\r\nPaymaster-General, John King, Under-Secretary at the Home Office, Henry\r\nWilliam Bentinck, Governor of St. Vincent, Perkins Magra, Consul at\r\nMalta and naturally interested in the fate of that island, Donkin,\r\nsecretary to George III., and Brook, head of the London detective\r\nforce, who was sent to report on the Paris system, while Napoleon sent\r\na French detective to see what was done in London. There were also\r\nSir Charles Warre Malet, ex-acting Governor of Bombay, and Sir Robert\r\nChambers, late Chief-Justice of Calcutta, who before going out to India\r\nhad been intimate with Dr. Johnson. This, as we shall see, proved to be\r\nhis last journey.\r\n\r\nLaw, physic, and divinity were not numerously represented. Besides\r\nErskine and other barristers sitting or destined to sit in the House\r\nof Commons, there was John Campbell, a future Lord Chief-Justice\r\nand Lord Chancellor, and the biographer of his class. He saw the\r\n‘little Corsican,’ and visited Tallien. Thomas Wilde, afterwards Lord\r\nChancellor Truro, was registered, doubtless in joke by himself or his\r\ncompanions, as M.P., though he was as yet only twenty years of age.\r\nCurran, who had been before in 1787, dined with Fox. Deploring the\r\nfailure of the Revolution, he disliked Napoleon. He little foresaw\r\nthat he was about meanly to disown his daughter Sarah on account of\r\nher attachment to Emmet.[76] Stewart Kyd, a friend of Horne Tooke,\r\nprosecuted with other Radicals in 1794, had passed four months in the\r\nTower, but had now sobered down and become a legal writer. The French\r\npolice suspected him of being a spy. He had, in 1796, assisted Erskine\r\nin defending Thomas Williams, the publisher of Paine’s _Age of\r\nReason_. A native of Arbroath, he died in London in 1811. William\r\nDuppa is best known as brother of the artist and as the biographer of\r\nMichael Angelo. Charles Henry Okey ultimately settled in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe physicians included Charles Maclean, who had been with Lord Elgin\r\nat Constantinople, and had also been in the East India Company’s\r\nservice, but had been sent home by Wellesley on account of his\r\nquarrelsome disposition. Landing at Hamburg in 1801, he proceeded\r\nthrough Holland to Paris, in order to advocate the establishment at\r\nConstantinople of an international institute for the study of the\r\nplague. He was anxious for information on French suicides, and Holcroft\r\nhad recommended him to apply not to a specialist but to Fauriel, the\r\nSanscrit scholar. He denied the contagiousness of epidemics, and his\r\nmedical crotchets, coupled with his controversial temper, prevented\r\nhis being employed by the Government, wherefore he considered himself\r\nan ill-used man. George Birkbeck, the future founder of mechanics’\r\ninstitutes, must be reckoned among the doctors: he accompanied Curran.\r\nPeter Mark Roget, a nephew of Romilly and a friend of Bentham, as yet\r\nSwiss rather than English, went as travelling tutor to the two sons\r\nof John Philips, a Manchester merchant, Edgeworth’s son accompanying\r\nthem. His _Treasury of English Synonyms_ is well known. William\r\nWoodville, the disciple of Jenner, and physician to the Smallpox\r\nHospital, had been with Nowel to Boulogne in the summer of 1801, at the\r\nsolicitation of Dr. Antoine Ambert, to introduce vaccination during\r\na smallpox epidemic. He was an accomplished botanist. Dr. Wickham,\r\nanother visitor, was likewise a friend of Jenner. On the other hand\r\nthere were two strong opponents of vaccination. William Rowley,\r\nphysician to the Marylebone Infirmary and an accoucheur of repute,\r\nand Benjamin Moseley, of Chelsea Hospital, who had been trained in\r\nParis, and who had a strange theory that the changes of the moon\r\ninfluenced hemorrhage of the lungs. Tuthill (afterwards Sir George\r\nTuthill) took over his handsome wife, of whom we shall hear again.\r\nJames Carrick Moore, brother of Sir John, became director of Jenner’s\r\nvaccine institute. Benjamin Travers, as yet articled pupil to Sir\r\nPaston Cooper, was the first hospital surgeon to make of ophthalmia a\r\nspecial study. Thomas Young was inspector-general of hospitals. Of his\r\ndistinguished homonym, although also a doctor, we shall speak among\r\nscientists. Of John Bunnell Davis and Farrell Mulvey we shall hear\r\nlater on. James Carmichael Smyth, physician to George III.,\r\nwas destined to be the step-grandfather of Thackeray, for his son Major\r\nHenry Carmichael Smyth married Thackeray’s mother in India, and ‘sat’\r\nfor the character of Colonel Newcome. The physician received £5000 from\r\nParliament for curing a jail distemper at Winchester in 1796 by nitrous\r\nacid; albeit a Dr. Johnston and a Frenchman also claimed the discovery.\r\nJames Chichester Maclaurin, physician to the Paris Embassy 1790–1792,\r\nreturned in the same capacity in 1802. He died in 1804 at the age of\r\nthirty-nine. His predecessor Macdonnal also revisited Paris. Michael\r\nO’Ryan had practised at Lyons, where Louis Badger, a silk-spinner of\r\nEnglish descent, one of the victims of the Revolution--mistaken for his\r\nbrother Pierre, he refused to undeceive his executioners, but Pierre\r\nwas shot a week later--had married his wife’s sister. Fleeing from the\r\nRevolution back to Ireland, O’Ryan now went and settled in Paris. He\r\nwas a great advocate of quinine.\r\n\r\nCardinal Charles Erskine, by virtue of his rank, claims priority among\r\nthe clerical visitors. His father, Colin Erskine, son of Sir Charles,\r\na Fifeshire baronet, was an artist at Rome, where he married a Roman\r\nlady. A letter to the French Government of 1808 giving an account of\r\nthe College of Cardinals says:--\r\n\r\n   ‘Erskine, 65 years of age, affects the greatest indifference to\r\n   the present state of things (Napoleon’s rule), speaking of the\r\n   Emperor with apparent moderation, but a dangerous man, perhaps\r\n   the most dangerous of all; educated at the English college.’[77]\r\n\r\nHe was on his way back to Rome, after having been a kind of legate in\r\nEngland, where in 1801 he had had the invidious task of requiring the\r\nresignations of the French _émigré_ bishops on account of the\r\nConcordat. Fourteen, however, out of the eighteen, headed by Arthur\r\nDillon, Archbishop of Narbonne, refused to comply, and seven colleagues\r\non the Continent followed their example. A good scholar, excellent\r\ncompany, and a loyal Briton, Erskine died in 1811 in Paris, having been\r\ninterned there by Napoleon, and was buried in the Pantheon.[78] Dr.\r\nGregory Stapleton, Bishop of the English midland district, went to St.\r\nOmer to try and recover the property of the English college of which\r\nhe had been the head until the Revolution, but he died there, without\r\nhaving continued his journey to Paris, on the 5th April 1802. A fellow\r\nprelate was Dr. Troy, President of Maynooth, and ultimately Catholic\r\nArchbishop of Dublin, who was anxious to obtain fuller restitution of\r\nthe confiscated property of the Irish colleges in France and to re-open\r\nthem, for Maynooth with its two hundred seminarists was insufficient.\r\nHe went to Lord Cornwallis, who, however, was unable to help him.\r\nA staunch loyalist, he had assisted in carrying the Union, and was\r\nconsequently in receipt of a State pension. William Walsh until the\r\nRevolution had been the head of the Irish college in Paris. Driven away\r\nby that event, he eventually recovered his post. Father Peter Flood,\r\nwho had narrowly escaped the massacre of September 1792,[79] was sent\r\nover by the Irish Catholic bishops to effect the fusion of all the\r\nFranco-Irish colleges. Tuite, who till the Revolution had been head of\r\nthe English college at Paris, found that building converted to secular\r\nuses. John Chetwode Eustace, formerly chaplain to the Jerninghams,\r\na Maynooth professor and a very liberal Catholic, had visited Paris\r\nin 1790, and was destined to pay a third visit in company with Lord\r\nBrownlow, Robert Rushbrooke, and Philip Roche.\r\n\r\nEdward Stanley, the future Bishop of Norwich, and father of Dean\r\nStanley, represented the Church of England, for he had just been\r\nordained. He was on his way to Switzerland, and was disappointed at\r\nnot seeing Napoleon. He was over again in 1816, when he heard drunken\r\nEnglish soldiers singing on the boulevards:\r\n\r\n    ‘Louis Dix-huit, Louis Dix-huit,\r\n    We’ve licked all your armies\r\n      and sunk all your fleet.’\r\n\r\nAnd the French royalists imagined the song to be complimentary.[80]\r\n\r\nAnglicanism was also represented by Stephen Weston, grandson of a\r\nbishop, who had been to Paris in 1791, and published rather flippant\r\naccounts of both trips. Then there was John Glasse, rector of Hanwell,\r\na good classical scholar, whose sermon in 1793 on behalf of the French\r\n_émigré_ priests made light of the differences between Catholicism\r\nand Protestantism. Hanwell is associated with lunacy, and Glasse in\r\n1810, in a fit of mental derangement, hung himself at the Bull and\r\nMouth Inn, London. John Sanford was a witness of the scene between\r\nNapoleon and Lord Whitworth on the 13th March 1803, and in _Notes and\r\nQueries_ of the 3rd April 1852, as the only surviving witness--for\r\nthe Duchess of Gordon, her daughters, and Mrs. Greatheed were then\r\ndead--he gave an account of it. W. Hughes, landing at Dieppe in June\r\n1802, visited Rouen, Caen, Blois, and other provincial towns before\r\nproceeding to Paris. Of John Maude, fellow of Queen’s College, Oxford,\r\nwe shall hear hereafter, as also of Churchill.\r\n\r\nThe Church of Scotland may be credited with John Paterson, for he was\r\nprobably the future missionary to Russia and Scandinavia. Alexander and\r\nJoseph Paterson may have been his brothers.\r\n\r\nNonconformity was represented by William Shepherd of Gatacre,\r\nLancashire, an intimate friend of Brougham, author of a life of Poggio,\r\nand also of a history of the American Revolution. The latter work\r\nLord John Russell read in manuscript before publication. Shepherd\r\nhad educated one of Roscoe’s sons, and was now escorting members\r\nof the Roscoe family. He took with him a letter of introduction to\r\nMiss Williams, at whose house he met Carnot and Kosciusko, spending\r\na most agreeable evening. On repeating his visit in 1814, however,\r\nhe apparently, judging by the silence of his _Paris in 1802 and\r\n1814_, neglected to renew the lady’s acquaintance.\r\n\r\nTurning to philosophers, scholars, and scientists, priority is due to\r\nJeremy Bentham and Malthus. Bentham exercised the French citizenship\r\nconferred on him in 1792 by voting for Bonaparte’s life-consulate, an\r\nact not very consistent with his radical doctrines.[81] His father had\r\ntaken him over to France in 1764. Malthus, who, though a clergyman,\r\nshould be classed as a philosopher or economist, little imagined how\r\nFrenchmen, mostly without having heard of him, would practise his\r\nprinciple. He revisited the Continent in 1825. Richard Chenevix,\r\nthe mineralogist, who had witnessed and been imprisoned during the\r\nRevolution, had taken Brussels and Jena on his way to Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Institute had in December 1801 elected as foreign associates Banks,\r\nPriestley, Herschel, Neville Maskelyne, James Rennell, the geographer,\r\nand Henry Cavendish in the class of physics and mathematics; Fox in\r\nthat of history and classics, and Sir Benjamin West in that of art.\r\nThere had apparently been an idea of also electing Arthur Young,\r\nHorne Tooke, Sheridan, Watt, and Sir John Sinclair. Herschel, Fox,\r\nand West were the only three of the eight nominees who acknowledged\r\nthe compliment in person. Herschel had the more reason for doing so\r\nas he had in 1790 been elected an associate of the old Academy of\r\nSciences before it was swept away by the Revolution. Sir Charles\r\nBlagden, Secretary of the Royal Society, whose name is attached to\r\nthe law of congelation, was presented to Napoleon, who told him that\r\nBanks was much esteemed in France, and indeed Banks had repeatedly\r\nobtained the restitution of consignments to the Jardin des Plantes\r\ncaptured at sea by the English.[82] Blagden seems, though a scientist,\r\nto have had a mission from the English Government, for Andreossi,\r\nthe French Ambassador at London, writing to Regnier on the 8th April\r\n1803, reported a statement of General Miranda, who was intimate\r\nwith Blagden: ‘He is in the pay of the Government; they were not at\r\nfirst satisfied with his reports, but he has changed his tone, and\r\nthey are now better pleased.’ Andreossi added: ‘I am certain that he\r\nhas spread it about here (in London) that I was in treaty on behalf\r\nof the Minister of the Interior for the purchase of a machine for\r\n“dividing” mathematical instruments, an object of great advantage to\r\nFrench industry, and requiring some precautions in order to be carried\r\nout.’ Blagden doubtless renewed his acquaintance with Desgenettes,\r\nthe army doctor, who since his visit as a young man to London in 1784\r\nhad accompanied Napoleon to Egypt, and was destined to accompany him\r\nto Moscow. Blagden, pronounced by Dr. Johnson ‘a delightful fellow,’\r\nwas also acquainted with Count Rumford, for whose daughter’s hand\r\nhe was an unsuccessful suitor.[83] After Waterloo he spent half the\r\nyear in France and died there. Bonnycastle, Professor of Mathematics\r\nat Woolwich Academy, described by Leigh Hunt as rather vain of his\r\nacquirements, but a good fellow, fond of quoting Shakespeare and of\r\ntelling stories, was another visitor, probably in the company of his\r\nfriend Fuseli. Dr. John Fleming, Professor of Natural Philosophy at\r\nAberdeen, published in 1842 a _History of British Animals_.\r\nOsborn, an F.R.S., was living in 1806 at Weimar, where he explained to\r\nGoethe the battle of Trafalgar. Edward Pigott, the discoverer of the\r\nvariable star in Sobieski’s belt or sword, had observed the transit\r\nof Venus at Caen in 1769, and that of Mercury at Louvain in 1786. He\r\ndated an astronomical paper from Fontainebleau in 1803, and in 1807\r\nhe observed the great comet, but the date and place of his death are\r\nuncertain.[84]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most eminent man of this category, scarcely less eminent\r\nthan Herschel (though the latter discovered the planet now named after\r\nhim, but originally styled by him the Georgium Sidus and by Frenchmen,\r\nNapoleon), was Thomas Young. He was the author of the undulatory theory\r\nof light, ridiculed at the time in the _Edinburgh Review_ by that\r\nshallow scientist Brougham, yet now almost universally accepted, and he\r\nwas the first to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics. His uncle, Richard\r\nBrocklesby, the physician and friend of Johnson, Burke, Reynolds,\r\nand Wilkes, bequeathed him £10,000, besides his house, library, and\r\npictures. In 1801 Young, originally tutor to Hudson Gurney--both being\r\nthen Quakers, but both destined to renounce Quakerism--and a medical\r\npractitioner, had found his true vocation as Professor of Natural\r\nPhilosophy at the Royal Institution and editor of the _Nautical\r\nAlmanac_. He has a nephew, a rent-collector at Bristol, who, however\r\ntells me that he was not born till after his illustrious uncle’s death.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to draw an exact line between scholars, connoisseurs,\r\nand savants. Charles Towneley was famous, like Elgin, for his marbles,\r\nthe fruits of his Italian travels from 1765 to 1772, and purchased\r\nafter his death in 1805 by the British Museum. Turberville Needham, the\r\nscientist, had been his tutor in Paris in 1752, when his uncle John,\r\ntranslator of _Hudibras_ into French verse, seems to have looked\r\nafter him. Sir Abraham Hume, who has been already mentioned, was a\r\nfamous collector of minerals and precious stones, and had purchased\r\npictures by the old masters at Vienna and Bologna. He was one of the\r\nfounders of the Geological Society, and lived to be at eighty-eight\r\nthe senior F.R.S. Joseph Ritson, the antiquary, had been in Paris in\r\n1791, when he was enthusiastic for the Revolution, and he actually\r\nadopted the Jacobin calendar. A strict vegetarian and an avowed\r\nmaterialist, he was latterly insane. Stephen Martin-Leake, herald\r\nand numismatist, sent over three of his sons, William, Stephen, and\r\nJohn, the two last likewise heralds. William Taylor, the friend of\r\nSouthey, son of a Norwich manufacturer, and educated by Mrs. Barbauld,\r\nat Palgrave, Suffolk, had been sent on the Continent by his father in\r\n1779, went again in 1788, and now repeated his visit. He was one of the\r\nfirst to introduce German literature to English readers. He met Paine\r\nat a dinner given by Holcroft, and had an introduction to Lafayette\r\nfrom his uncle Dyson, a Norfolk man whose son had taught Lafayette\r\nfarming.[85] Taylor went back an anti-Bonapartist. Paine had probably\r\nopened his eyes to Napoleon’s tyranny. Alexander Hamilton, a future\r\nF.R.S., had been in the East India Company’s service in Bengal, and on\r\nreturning to England, after accompanying Lord Elgin to Constantinople,\r\nhad continued his Sanscrit studies. He took with him his Creole wife\r\nand a promising son. Few as were then the students of Sanscrit, fewer\r\nstill were the students of Chinese. Thomas Manning was one of them.\r\nSon of the rector of Diss, Norfolk, in whose church Wesley preached a\r\nfew weeks before his death, though all other church pulpits had long\r\nbeen closed to him, Manning was also at Holcroft’s dinner, and we\r\nmay imagine his being questioned about Diss by Paine, who had been a\r\njourneyman staymaker there. In his letters to his father--all beginning\r\n‘Honoured sir,’ and subscribed ‘your dutiful son’--he mentions the Abbé\r\nSicard, the teacher of the deaf and dumb, Carnot, Madame de Staël,\r\nChateaubriand, and Laharpe. Manning, who suggested to Charles Lamb his\r\nroast pig essay, and was also intimate with Coleridge, is buried, like\r\nMalthus, in Bath Abbey.\r\n\r\nArtists flocked to Paris to see the spoils from Italy collected at\r\nthe Louvre. There was West (not yet Sir Benjamin West), with his son\r\nRaphael, who was expected to prove himself worthy of his Christian\r\nname, but failed to do so. It was this visit, perhaps, which left\r\nWest no time to send a new picture to the Royal Academy exhibition in\r\n1803; but he should not have attempted to palm off as new a ‘Hagar\r\nand Ishmael’ which he had exhibited in 1776. President though he was,\r\nthe Academy insisted on its withdrawal. Opie was there with his wife,\r\nAmelia Alderson, who years afterwards gave an account of her visit in\r\n_Tait’s Magazine_. Seated on the boulevards, the future Quakeress\r\nsang ‘Fall, tyrants, fall,’ a pæan on the Revolution singularly\r\nout of place under the iron rule of Napoleon; but she had not yet\r\ndiscovered him to be a tyrant. Opie was so dazzled the first day by\r\nthe white glare of Paris houses that he talked of leaving at once to\r\navoid blindness, but the alarm soon passed off. Bertie Greatheed,\r\nthe dramatist, was accompanied by his son, who copied assiduously at\r\nthe Louvre, besides sketching a capital likeness of Napoleon. His\r\ncopies were said to be so good that Napoleon refused at first to\r\nlet them leave France, but relented on the young man’s death.[86]\r\nErskine also induced Napoleon to sit for his portrait to Philips,\r\nR.A., who finished it through the courtesy of Josephine while her\r\nhusband was at supper. The portrait was sold at Erskine’s death and\r\nwas apparently purchased by Lord Howden. Howden, who latterly lived at\r\nBayonne, bequeathed it to the sub-prefecture of that town, where it\r\nstill hangs, but not in a prominent place, so that it escaped notice\r\ntill 1895, when, in a controversy on the colour of Napoleon’s eyes,\r\nattention was called to it.[87] Richard Cosway, the miniaturist, and\r\nhis wife, the musician and historical painter, repeated their visit\r\nof 1786, when Richard was trying to sell to Louis XVI. some\r\nRaphael cartoons which he had bought of Bonfield. André Chénier, the\r\npoet destined to the guillotine, was then passionately in love with\r\nMrs. Cosway. He addressed verses to her, some in her name in full,\r\nothers inscribed ‘d. r.,’ a contraction for d’Arno, on the banks of\r\nwhich river she was born. A Polish poet, Niemcewics, likewise enamoured\r\nof her, went to see her in London in 1787. She now studied at the\r\nLouvre, next went to Lyons, and then to Lodi.[88] She subsequently\r\nstarted a school in Paris, which did not succeed, went again to Lyons,\r\nand eventually became head of a convent near that city. Daughter\r\nof an English hotelkeeper at Leghorn, she thus played many parts.\r\nAnother female artist, Mrs. Damer, had been captured by a French\r\nprivateer in 1779, but gallantly allowed to proceed to Jersey, where\r\nher father, Field-Marshal Conway, was governor. Josephine, whom she\r\nhad known before her marriage, introduced her to Napoleon, who, as\r\npreviously stated, bespoke a bust of Fox. Strawberry Hill House had\r\nbeen bequeathed to her by Horace Walpole. John Claude Nattes, one of\r\nthe earliest of water-colourists and a topographical draftsman, took\r\nviews of Paris, Versailles, and St. Denis. For unaccountably exhibiting\r\ndrawings not his own, he was in 1807 expelled from the Water Colour\r\nSociety, but he then resumed sending to the Royal Academy. Masquerier,\r\nof whom we have already heard, was again in Paris. Let it suffice to\r\nname Sir Martin Shee, President of the Royal Academy; Fuseli; Flaxman,\r\nwho with his wife accompanied West; Duppa, who had witnessed French\r\nspoliation at Rome in 1798; Farrington, who accompanied Rogers;\r\nBowyer, the fashionable portrait painter and illustrator of Hume’s\r\n_History_; Edward Hayes, the miniaturist, and his father, the\r\nmore distinguished painter, Michael Angelo Hayes; George Bryant,\r\nengaged by the sportsman Thornton; William Dickinson, with his son,\r\nof whom we shall hear later on; Boddington; Hoppner, the naturalised\r\nGerman;[89] Thomas Daniell; William Turner; Andrew Wilson; John Wright;\r\nRobert Flin; William Sherlock, who forty years before had studied in\r\nParis, the illustrator of Smollett’s _History_, B. D. Wyatt, the\r\narchitect; Abraham Raimbach, the engraver; Charles and James Heath\r\nand Jervis, also engravers; and Thomas Richard Underwood. Likewise\r\nan artist in her way was Mary Linwood, who in 1798 had opened an\r\nexhibition of art needlework, viz. copies of a hundred pictures of old\r\nmasters and modern painters, and who went on working till the age of\r\nseventy-five, when eyesight failed her. Her Napoleon in woolwork is now\r\nin the South Kensington Museum.\r\n\r\nBut few actors had time--they can scarcely have lacked inclination--to\r\nvisit Paris. John Philip Kemble, however, described in the register as\r\n_rentier_, went to see his old college at Douai, which he found so\r\ndilapidated that he had not the heart to inspect his old room. Arriving\r\nin Paris in July 1802, he made the acquaintance of Talma, who showed\r\nhim, with his companions Lords Hollands and Cloncurry, over the Louvre.\r\nHe then proceeded to Madrid to study Spanish acting. His brother\r\nCharles likewise went to Paris on his way to Vienna and St. Petersburg,\r\nnot reappearing in London till September 1803. Their father Roger, a\r\nless accomplished actor, who never played but once in London, and then\r\nfor the benefit of his son Stephen, is said to have spent from May 1799\r\nto October 1802 in Italy and France; but this seems unlikely at his\r\nage, for at his death in December 1802 he was over eighty. Edmond John\r\nEyre, the son of a clergyman, had left Cambridge without a degree in\r\norder to take to the stage. He was, however, an indifferent actor at\r\nBath and Bristol. He published his _Observations made at Paris_.\r\n\r\nWe may couple with the Kembles and Eyre Mrs. Charlotte Atkyns, though\r\nshe had long left Drury Lane where she was known as ‘the pretty Miss\r\nWalpole.’ She married in 1779, at the age of twenty-five, Edward\r\nAtkyns of Ketteringham Hall, Norfolk, who died in 1794. She was in\r\nParis during the Revolution, and was one of those who endeavoured to\r\neffect the escape of Marie Antoinette. In 1809 she celebrated George\r\nIII.’s Jubilee by a feast to the villagers of Ketteringham, at\r\nwhich she herself proposed the loyal toasts. The death of her only son\r\nin 1804 had then left her sole mistress of Ketteringham, but she seems\r\nultimately to have lost her property. She was an ardent believer in\r\nthe sham Dauphin Bruneau, but was nevertheless pensioned after 1815 by\r\nLouis XVIII. and died in Paris about 1829.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to inventors. Congreve has been already named. James\r\nWatt had not seen France since 1786, when his advice was called for\r\non the Marly aqueduct. This time he does not appear to have had any\r\nprofessional purpose, albeit that aqueduct was again out of repair.\r\nThomas Wedgwood, one of the three sons of the great potter, was the\r\nfuture inventor of photography. An invalid in search of health, he\r\nrequired change of scene. He deserves mention for settling an annuity\r\non Coleridge, and as the friend of Sydney Smith. He first went to\r\nBrussels, joined Poole in Paris, went on with him to Switzerland, and\r\nreturned home in August 1803. Greathead, another inventor, doubtless\r\nwished to introduce his lifeboat. Robert Salmon, steward to the Duke\r\nof Norfolk and clerk of the works at the rebuilding of Carlton House,\r\nhad invented a chaff-cutting machine, and probably wished to make it\r\nknown in France, while William Story took out a patent for a blue dye.\r\n\r\nThere were also men of business and men who went over on business. Sir\r\nElijah Impey, who has been named among the ex-M.P’s, had been chosen\r\nas delegate by a meeting in London of claimants for compensation for\r\nconfiscated property, an article in the treaty having stipulated that\r\nsuch claims should be promptly settled by the tribunals. The article\r\nwas nominally applicable to both countries, but England, of course, had\r\nhad no revolution and had confiscated little, if any, French property.\r\nNo such claims were settled before the renewal of hostilities, for\r\nWhitworth, reporting a conversation with Napoleon on the 23rd February\r\n1803, says:--\r\n\r\n   ‘I alleged as a cause of mistrust and jealousy the impossibility\r\n   of obtaining justice or any kind of redress for any of His\r\n   Majesty’s subjects. He asked me in what respect. I told him that\r\n   since the signing of the treaty not one British claimant had\r\n   been satisfied, though every Frenchman of that description had\r\n   been so within one month after that period.’\r\n\r\nThe claims, as we shall see, were revived in 1815, when France gave\r\na lump sum of sixty millions, leaving the English authorities to\r\nadjudicate on the separate claims. The claims certainly presented\r\ndifficulties, for Merry, on the 12th May 1802, speaks of ‘clamorous\r\ndemands,’ and on the 23rd June of ‘incessant and sometimes intemperate\r\napplications’; while on taking his departure in December he expressed\r\nmortification at having the claims unredressed.[90] Even private papers\r\nwere not restored, perhaps because being mostly tradesmen’s bills they\r\nwere not thought worth reclaiming, but possibly because troublesome\r\nformalities were necessary. Merry had been directed to back the claim\r\nof the Duke of Richmond to the Aubigny estates conferred by Louis\r\nXIV. on his ancestress, Charles _II._’s mistress, but in January 1803\r\nNapoleon decreed that no British subject could possess landed property\r\nin France, and in 1807 Aubigny was definitely confiscated.\r\n\r\nAmong the business men, bankers may be allowed precedence. I do\r\nnot reckon Rogers among them, for his visit had no more to do with\r\nbanking than that of his brother-in-law Sutton Sharpe with brewing.\r\nBut there were Boyd and Benfield, of whom I have already spoken. I\r\nhave also mentioned Sir Francis Baring and his son Alexander. Hugh\r\nHamersley, son of an Oxfordshire clergyman, and named Hugh on account\r\nof descent from Sir Hugh Hamersley, Lord Mayor of London in 1627,\r\nwas one of the earliest lovers of Théroigne de Méricourt. According\r\nto her confessions or interrogatories when a prisoner in Austria, he\r\npromised her marriage, and she remained with him till 1785; but on\r\ncoming into possession of his patrimony he took her to Paris, there\r\nindulged in dissipation, and returned without her, but settled 200,000\r\nf. on her. Such a statement of course requires verification, but the\r\ntradition at her birthplace is that she eloped with an Englishman in\r\nthe hope of becoming a public singer in London, for she had a fine\r\nvoice. (Œlsner states, however, that after bearing a son to Persan de\r\nDoublet, who dismissed her with an annuity of 12,000 f., she went to\r\nLondon and lived with the Italian singer Carducci, a eunuch whom she\r\ninduced to take with him to Italy, but they quarrelled and parted at\r\nGenoa.[91] Œlsner is likely to have ascertained the true version of her\r\nantecedents. Did Hamersley inquire for the poor lunatic in 1802?[92]\r\nHe had been agent for the French Government in the maintenance of\r\nFrench prisoners in England until it changed its system and left\r\nEngland to support them. Madame Dubarry, on recovering her stolen\r\njewels in London, deposited them with Hamersley. He subscribed £315 to\r\nthe patriotic fund of 1803, and in 1812 was M.P. for Helston. On his\r\ndeath in 1840 his bank was wound up and yielded only 10s. in the pound.\r\nHe had married in 1810 Margaret, daughter of John Bevan, a Quaker\r\nbanker, and I remember his nephew or cousin as Chairman of Oxfordshire\r\nQuarter Sessions. Herries, brother of Sir Charles Herries, probably\r\nwent to fetch his wife, who had been an eyewitness of the Revolution.\r\nThornton and Power, English bankers at Hamburg and other Continental\r\ntowns, opened a branch at Paris in 1802, and in 1805 John Power applied\r\nfor French citizenship; but the police reported unfavourably on the\r\napplication, alleging that the Hamburg bank acted for the English\r\nGovernment and that the Paris branch had furnished money to the\r\nconspirator Georges, though pleading ignorance of his criminal purpose.\r\nThornton, they added, was an illegitimate son of the well-known M.P.\r\nand writer on finance.[93] Thornton and Power seem to have amalgamated\r\nwith Perregaux, who had dealings with London banks. Kensington was\r\nanother London banker. William Dawes, assistant secretary to the\r\nBank of England, was probably commissioned to report on the newly\r\nestablished Bank of France, and Mollien relates how Napoleon, on being\r\nshown an intercepted letter from a Paris to an English banker advising\r\nhim to subscribe for its shares, exclaimed, ‘Such are merchants!\r\nDisputes between governments do not disturb their alliances.’\r\n\r\nSpeaking of merchants, William Ewart was the eminent Liverpool merchant\r\nafter whom Gladstone was named on account of his father’s intimacy\r\nwith him, while Judah, Henry, and Abraham Salomons were doubtless the\r\nuncles of Sir David Salomons, the first Jew returned to Parliament.\r\nThere were also Joseph,[94] Leon, and Moses Montefiore, of Bologna\r\norigin, the first of them already the father of Sir Moses Montefiore\r\nthe philanthropist, then a youth of eighteen. This Moses Montefiore was\r\non his way to Leghorn. James and Thomas Payne, eminent booksellers of\r\nthe second generation, were doubtless bent on picking up rare volumes.\r\nJames, succeeding to the business of Elmsley, had already profited\r\nby the dispersion of such treasures in the Revolution--the Lamoignon\r\ncollection for instance. He had secured many prizes for Lord Spencer\r\nto enrich the famous Althorp collection, which in 1899 was purchased\r\nby Mrs. Rylands and presented to Manchester. He also had dealings with\r\nthe British Museum and the Bodleian; and had supplied some rare English\r\nbooks to the Paris National Library, and helped in its catalogue.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hayes was another bookselling tourist, and there was John\r\nNichols, the printer and publisher, the biographer of Hogarth and for\r\nnearly half a century editor of the _Gentleman’s Magazine_. He\r\nhad just retired from business, and with his two daughters went to the\r\nsouth of France. Then there was Thomas Poole, the friend of Paine, the\r\nfriend also of Coleridge and Sir Humphry Davy. He went to hear the Abbé\r\nSicard lecture to the deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\nFrom books to horses is a long jump. Edward Tattersall had been sent\r\nover in 1775 on an invitation from M. de Mezières, equerry to Louis\r\nXVI., and had much enjoyed himself. His father Richard, who\r\nsupplied horses for the French royal stud, told the French host not\r\nto spoil the boy, but to make him keep his place, as he would have\r\nto earn his own livelihood.[95] The mention of Tattersall naturally\r\nsuggests Philip Astley, who hoped to recover ten years’ rent for his\r\nold circus, which had been converted into barracks; but while engaged\r\nin securing this, his London circus, in which he had introduced French\r\nperformances, was burnt down. William Boffin Kennedy was a well-known\r\nflorist who had Josephine as a customer, for in 1801, in a letter to\r\nOtto at London, she sent a list of flowers to be ordered of him. Lastly\r\nthere was Dorant, proprietor of the York Hotel, Albemarle Street,\r\nLondon, who went over to cash £2000 in assignats, but found them worth\r\njust 12 f. He acted as cicerone, familiar as he was with Paris, to\r\nyoung George Jackson of the Embassy.\r\n\r\nWe now come to authors, whom we have reserved till nearly the last,\r\nnot because they were the least important, rather the reverse, but\r\nbecause they are the most numerous. They may be conveniently divided\r\ninto writers on Paris--chiels taking notes--and writers on other\r\nsubjects. As to the former, it must be confessed that few of these\r\naccounts of Paris possess much merit or interest. There are, however,\r\nsome notable exceptions. Thomas Holcroft, as ‘dogmatic, virulent,\r\nand splenetic as ever’ says King, had been prosecuted in 1794; but\r\non the acquittal of Horne Tooke and others the case against him was\r\nabandoned. He had been to Paris in 1783, and again in 1785 to fetch\r\nhis son back from school, when along with Bonneville, Paine’s future\r\nhost, he wrote down Beaumarchais’s _Figaro_ from hearing it at\r\nthe theatre, being unable otherwise to procure a copy in order to have\r\nit performed in London. He had paid a third visit in 1799–1801, and he\r\nwas now accompanied by his second wife Louise Mercier, who was born\r\nin France but brought up in England.[96] He also took his daughter\r\nFanny, the future novelist and translator, who married first Dr. Badams\r\nand secondly Danton’s nephew Merget. Holcroft in his _Travels from\r\nHamburg to Paris_ (1804) gives a good picture of Parisian society.\r\nJ. G. Lemaistre, who went to claim a legacy, was one of the earliest\r\nvisitors, for he started in October or November 1801, remaining\r\ntill May 1802. In the latter year he published a _Rough Sketch of\r\nParis_. He went on to Switzerland, Italy, and Germany, and in his\r\n_Travels after the Peace of Amiens_ (1806) he gave a curious\r\naccount of his dining with Cardinal York, then already getting into\r\nhis dotage. Lemaistre was the son of an Indian judge, was described\r\nby Erskine as ‘a most agreeable, good-natured, sensible man,’ and was\r\nobviously of French or Channel Isle descent. Sir John Carr, a Rugby\r\nscholar, wrote numerous books of travel, his _Stranger in France_\r\n(1803) being his first attempt. In 1898 it was translated into French\r\nby M. Albert Babeau. No other visitor of 1802 has had a similar honour,\r\nbut _Paris as it was and as it is_ by Francis William Blagdon, a\r\nteacher of languages, was translated at the time into German.\r\n\r\nJohn King, the author of _Letters from France_, reprinted I\r\nthink from the _True Briton_, had a singular career. He was\r\nthe son of poor Jewish parents, was apparently named (not of course\r\nchristened) Isaac, and was brought up at a Jewish charity school.\r\nThomas Paine, with whom he was afterwards to break lances, knew\r\nhim young, penniless, and friendless, a flaming Radical. Clerk in a\r\nJewish counting-house, he made use of his good abilities and started\r\nas a money-lender and bill-discounter, advancing money on post-obits\r\nto spendthrift heirs. He was also a frequent speaker at a debating\r\nclub in Carlisle Street. In 1783 he published, dedicating it to Fox,\r\n_Thoughts on the Difficulties and Distresses in which the Peace\r\nof 1783 has involved the People of England_. He lived in style,\r\nand is described as a banker at Egham, but seems to have been simply\r\na broker. As such, nicknamed ‘Jew King’ or ‘King of the Jews,’ he\r\nbecame notorious for litigation, figuring frequently in the courts\r\nas plaintiff, defendant, or witness, and he was roughly handled by\r\ncross-examining counsel. He was, moreover, twice imprisoned for debt.\r\nHe had previously visited France, and in December 1792 he had denounced\r\nthe Revolution. Twitted by Paine with his change of opinions, he\r\nreplied that the Revolution, not he himself, had changed. At Paris\r\nhe was accompanied or joined by his wife the Dowager-Countess of\r\nLanesborough, a widow since 1779, and is said to have procured her son\r\na rich wife.[97] In any case he himself had obtained a potentially\r\nrich wife, for the Countess in 1814 came into possession for life of\r\nthe estates of her brother, the Earl of Belvedere. A police note by\r\nDesmarest of the 2nd October 1802 gives no flattering account of King:--\r\n\r\n   ‘This Englishman, a branded swindler, has just incurred another\r\n   disgrace. His daughter, daughter of Lady Lanesborough his wife,\r\n   last night quitted King’s house to rejoin her husband M. de\r\n   Marescote (Marquis Luigi Marescotti) of Bologna. King for nine\r\n   years had detained this young woman from her husband, and had\r\n   always refused to give her up. He required Marescote to fetch\r\n   her in England, because he would then have presented heavy\r\n   bills, which he would have forced him to pay even by litigation.\r\n   Madame M. took advantage of her stay in Paris to rejoin her\r\n   husband. All this happened under the eyes and with the approval\r\n   of the Italian Minister, Marescalchi, who beforehand informed\r\n   the Minister of Justice. Mr. King has confined himself to\r\n   preferring a charge of robbery against Miss Oliver, Madame\r\n   M.’s lady’s-maid. King pretends to have had promises from two\r\n   ministers for starting a rival English paper in Paris. He wrote\r\n   some days ago to General Moreau, Santerre, Tallien, and a fourth\r\n   person to invite them to dine with him, which they refused. It\r\n   is presumed that his object was simply to obtain answers from\r\n   them which he hoped to produce in London and thus make fresh\r\n   dupes. He is always careful to write his letters in his own name\r\n   and that of Lady Lanesborough, the latter name procuring him\r\n   deference and answers. Senator Perregaux (a banker) who has been\r\n   consulted respecting this foreigner, regards him as a swindler\r\n   and as a dangerous man.’\r\n\r\nThis report must be a mixture of fact and fiction, for even if King,\r\non Lady Lanesborough’s departure from Paris in October 1802, was left\r\nin charge of her daughter, he could not have been sequestrating her\r\nfor nine years. Marescotti, moreover, when arrested at Cassel in 1807\r\nand incarcerated at Bouillon, is described in another police report\r\nas a needy adventurer employed by the English Government. A German\r\ntranslation of Goldsmith’s book on Napoleon was in his possession,\r\nand he was charged with circulating pamphlets of the same kind. He was\r\nreleased in the following year, on the understanding that his brother\r\nat Bologna would keep him out of mischief.[98] No mention is made of\r\nhis wife, who had probably quitted him. Thomas Moore met her at Bologna\r\nin 1819 (her mother also he saw in Paris in 1821), and she lived till\r\n1840. King’s banking partner Lathrop Murray, who pretended to be a\r\nbaronet, became bankrupt in the summer of 1802, pleading in excuse that\r\nhe had fallen a prey in Paris to King’s wiles, backed by French wines\r\nand by Lady Lanesborough’s attractions. Returning to England, King was\r\narrested for debt in 1802, but published his book in 1803, and in the\r\nfollowing year he issued a pamphlet entitled _Oppressions deemed no\r\nInjustice toward Some Individuals_. This was a protest against his\r\nrough handling in the Law Courts. He also published a _Universal\r\nSystem of Arithmetic_, but after his wife’s accession to her\r\nbrother’s property, he lived abroad with her in good style. He died at\r\nFlorence in 1823, and his wife, aged eighty-seven, in 1828.[99] His\r\n_Letters from France_ are not without interest. He mentions that\r\nSanterre, when lunching with him, justified his beating the drums at\r\nLouis XVI.’s execution, his object being to prevent royalist\r\ncries which would have led to bloodshed.\r\n\r\nKing naturally brings us to his fellow Hebrew, Lewis Goldsmith.\r\nBorn at Richmond, Surrey, about 1773, he seems to have been in\r\n1792 at Frankfort and in 1794 in Poland, whence he wrote to Lord\r\nStanhope, urging him to bring the Polish cause before Parliament.\r\nStanhope, however, though sympathising with Kosciusko, stated that\r\nthe Anglo-Prussian alliance debarred him from doing so. In 1795\r\nGoldsmith, as a friend of Joel Barlow, wrote a preface to the second\r\npart of Barlow’s _Advice to the Privileged Orders_, an exhortation\r\nto kings and aristocrats to renounce their doomed prerogatives.\r\nAccording to Lord Campbell, Goldsmith had been an emissary of all the\r\ngreat European powers, yet in 1801 he published a pamphlet entitled\r\n_The Crimes of Cabinets_, in which he denounced the British\r\nand Continental Governments as bent on dismembering France. It was\r\nto escape prosecution for this tirade that he went to Paris, his\r\nwife Rebecca with their daughter joining him. He alleges, but it is\r\ndifficult to believe him, that he was taken to Dieppe in order to be\r\ngiven up to England as a conspirator in exchange for Peltier, and that\r\nno such exchange being feasible he was sent back to Paris. There, it\r\nis clear, he offered his services to Napoleon, who conceived the idea\r\nof starting an English newspaper in Paris to circulate his ideas in\r\nEngland and its colonies. Curiously enough Napoleon was an unconscious\r\nplagiary of the Commonwealth, which in 1650 founded or supported a\r\nFrench weekly newspaper, _Nouvelles Ordinaires de Londres_,\r\nfor circulation on the Continent.[100] That newspaper lasted only\r\neight years, and the Paris _Argus_ lasted about as long. There\r\nmust have been a staff of English compositors to bring it out. It\r\ngave copious extracts from the London journals, but was violently\r\nanti-English or at least anti-ministerial in its tone. Goldsmith\r\nafterwards disclaimed responsibility for its diatribes, insisting that\r\nhe simply inserted the articles sent him. In November 1802 Napoleon\r\nordered five hundred copies to be regularly sent to the French West\r\nIndies in order thence to reach the neighbouring British colonies.\r\nThe paper was described by Merry as a ‘despicable publication.’ But\r\nin February 1803 Goldsmith was dismissed, which Whitworth notified\r\nas a sign of peace, the paper having changed its tone. His successor\r\nwas Thomas Hutton, ex-editor of the _Dramatic Censor_, who soon\r\nincurred disgrace and imprisonment. Goldsmith, pleading penury,\r\nasked for 7000 f. compensation. He had, he said, been promised the\r\nproprietorship, and had been put to great expense by his wife bringing\r\nover her furniture from England. He had also paid in advance for his\r\ndaughter’s schooling,[101] and being threatened with assassination\r\nby the English in Paris he was anxious to leave.[102] He remained,\r\nhowever, for in 1804–1805 he published with Barère the _Memorial\r\nAnti-Britannique_. He also translated Blackstone into French, and he\r\nadvertised in the _Petites Affiches_ in 1805–1806 as a pupil of\r\nScott and Schabracq, London notaries, and as a sworn interpreter ready\r\nto undertake translations and other business.\r\n\r\nReturning in 1809 to England with a passport from Dunkirk for America,\r\nhe was imprisoned for a short time in Tuthill Fields, but on his\r\nrelease began to write violently against Napoleon. Goldsmith published\r\nin 1811 the _Secret History of the Cabinet of Bonaparte_, and he\r\nproposed in 1815 that a price should be set on Bonaparte’s head. In\r\nspite of these provocative, not to say scurrilous, publications, he\r\nafter Waterloo settled down quietly in Paris till his death in 1846 as\r\nsolicitor to the British Embassy. One of his duties was to hand over\r\nthe letters or parcels which in those days of dear postage and carriage\r\nwere franked by the Foreign Office, and a friend of mine, sent as a\r\nyoung man to Paris to get a French polish, remembers how Goldsmith\r\nused to quiz or banter him on the supposed feminine source of such\r\nconsignments. But the most romantic event in Goldsmith’s career, a\r\nkind of parallel to King’s marriage, was the marriage in 1837 of his\r\nhandsome daughter Georgiana, born in Paris in 1807, to Lord Lyndhurst,\r\nex-Lord Chancellor. ‘I lived in Paris,’ she told Augustus Hare in\r\n1881, ‘with my father, and I was nobody. I never expected to marry.\r\nWhy should I? I had no fortune and no attractions.’ Lyndhurst first\r\nsaw her when visiting Paris with his first wife. He went over again,\r\na widower, in 1837 and made her an offer. Hare speaks of her ‘clever\r\nvivacity acquired by her early life in France.’ ‘I had,’ she told\r\nhim, ‘twenty-six years of the most perfect happiness ever allotted to\r\nwoman.’ Both husband and wife were curious links with the past, for the\r\nformer, son of the artist Copley, was born at Boston, U.S., in 1772,\r\nfour years before the Declaration of Independence, while the widow\r\nsurvived till 1891.\r\n\r\nAnother man who boxed the political compass was James Redhead Yorke.\r\nVisiting Paris in 1792, full of enthusiasm for the Revolution,[103]\r\nand imprisoned for sedition at Dorchester, he not only fell in love\r\nwith his jailer’s daughter, whom he married on his release, but turned\r\nanti-Gallican. He nevertheless in 1802 renewed acquaintance with Paine,\r\nwho said to him, ‘Do you call this a republic? Why, they are worse off\r\nthan the slaves in Constantinople.’ Yet Paine had originally, like\r\nmany intelligent Frenchmen, admired Napoleon. Yorke’s _Letters from\r\nFrance_ were reprinted, like King’s, from a newspaper.\r\n\r\nA fourth erratic journalist was William Playfair, brother of the\r\nEdinburgh geologist. He had helped to capture the Bastille, but was so\r\ndisillusioned with the Revolution that on returning to London in 1792\r\nhe advocated flooding France with forged assignats as the surest means\r\nof overturning the Republic. For this Louis Blanc has pilloried him,\r\nbut reprehensible as the scheme was, Playfair--what an irony in his\r\nname!--was not even entitled to originality, for forged Congressional\r\nnotes had been circulated during the American War of Independence.\r\nAlthough the English Government did not act on Playfair’s suggestion\r\nthe royalist _émigrés_ did so, and Napoleon, as we shall see,\r\nfollowed the evil example by counterfeiting English, Austrian, and\r\nRussian notes. Playfair on this second visit to Paris had no literary\r\npurpose, but in 1820 he published a criticism on Lady Morgan’s book on\r\nFrance. His editorship of _Galignani’s Messenger_, his inventions,\r\nnever lucrative, and his pecuniary troubles need not be detailed.\r\nLike King and Goldsmith he must be pronounced an adventurer and a\r\nweathercock.\r\n\r\nAnother journalist, James Parry, had just disposed of the\r\n_Courier_, and settled in France. If, as Lord Malmesbury and\r\nGoldsmith allege, he had been in the pay of the Directory he deserved,\r\nif contempt, forbearance, yet as we shall find he did not obtain any.\r\n\r\nColonel Thomas Thornton had visited France before the Revolution, and\r\nhad shown hospitality in England to _émigrés_. He was the only\r\nvisitor whose object was sport, and he took fourteen hounds with him,\r\nalbeit game was scarce, as for twelve years the peasants had had it all\r\ntheir own way. Wolves, however, still existed. He published in 1806\r\n_A Sporting Tour through France_, and going again after Waterloo\r\nhe purchased Pont-sur-Seine. The mansion, indeed, had been destroyed\r\nby the Cossacks, but the outbuildings were capable of habitation. He\r\nsold the property, however, in 1821 to Casimir Périer, the grandfather\r\nof the future President of the Republic, and died in Paris seven years\r\nlater, leaving a will in favour of an illegitimate daughter which was\r\nannulled by the English tribunals.\r\n\r\nWe now come to two lady writers. One was Frances Elizabeth, daughter\r\nof Sir Francis Bernard, Governor of Massachusetts, and wife of the\r\nRev. Richard King, a Cambridgeshire clergyman. She was intimate with\r\nHannah More, and founded district visiting societies and schools. She\r\npublished a _Tour in France_ in which she mentions that Boulogne\r\nwas full of English who had remained there during the Revolution, and\r\nthat you could scarcely enter a shop there without being addressed in\r\nEnglish. She spent seven months in Paris. The other was Anne Plumptree,\r\nnovelist and translator, daughter of a Huntingdonshire clergyman, and\r\ngranddaughter of a Cambridge don. She accompanied the Opies. Though\r\na democrat, she admired Napoleon and actually wished him to invade\r\nEngland. Her _Narrative of a Three Years’ Residence in France_\r\n(1810) relates chiefly to provincial life, which is an agreeable change\r\nafter so many books on Paris. I have already mentioned Francis William\r\nBlagdon, a prolific author, who, having previously visited France in\r\n1784, published _Paris as it was and as it is_. I may also mention\r\nWilliam Thomas Williams, author in 1807 of _The State of France_;\r\nDavid Morrice, a schoolmaster, with his _View of Modern France_\r\nand _Practical Guide from London to Paris_; Stewarton who wrote\r\nanonymously or otherwise against Napoleon and Talleyrand; and Israel\r\nWorsley, with his _State of France_ (1806). Worsley went back to\r\nDunkirk after Waterloo to re-open a school. In 1828 he undertook to\r\nprove the descent of the American Indians from the lost tribes. George\r\nTappen, who was interested in painting and architecture, published a\r\n_Tour through France and Italy_.\r\n\r\nJohn Dean Paul, a banker and future baronet, went over in August 1802\r\nas one of a party of five, accompanied by two servants and a courier.\r\nHe tells us in his anonymous book, _Journal of a Party of Pleasure to\r\nParis_, that a young friend of his in the uniform of the Wiltshire\r\nMilitia was tapped on the shoulder in the Louvre and asked to what\r\nregiment he belonged. The inquirer was Bonaparte, who frequently thus\r\naccosted British officers. Paul’s son and heir, then an infant, became\r\nunpleasantly notorious fifty years later. His daughter married in\r\n1827 Edward Fox Fitzgerald, son of Lord Edward. She lived till 1891.\r\nWilliam Beckford, the author of _Vathek_, had paid several visits\r\nto Paris. In October 1782 he passed through it on his way home from\r\nNaples. ‘A little impertinent, purse-proud puppy,’ Samuel Meek styled\r\nhim in his diary, for though staying at the same hotel he had refused\r\nto answer an inquiry respecting a nephew of Meek at Naples. He was\r\nagain in Paris from April 1791 to June 1792, when he ordered a tapestry\r\nfor his London house, and went on to Lausanne, where he purchased\r\nGibbon’s library. He paid a third visit in February 1793, and left in\r\nMay with a passport from the municipality viséd by Lebrun, the Foreign\r\nMinister; but the Calais authorities detained him until the Convention\r\nhad been consulted. He left behind him his two riding-horses, which\r\nwere seized for military baggage trains. The General Safety Committee,\r\ndeclaring them unfit for such work, ordered them to be restored,[104]\r\non the ground that Beckford had offered to present two cart-horses\r\nwhich would be much more serviceable, and that from love of liberty he\r\nhad lived much in France. We hear no particulars of his visit of May\r\n1802.\r\n\r\nAs for authors on non-French subjects, their name is legion. Let us\r\nbegin with poets. Wordsworth, it is true, did not go further than\r\nCalais, but I have already named Rogers, who had also seen Paris\r\nduring the Revolution, and now paid it a second visit. He described\r\nNapoleon as having a very strong profile, a sallow but not disagreeable\r\ncomplexion, light grey eyes, and scarcely perceptible eyebrows. Fox\r\ncommissioned Rogers to buy andirons for him in the Palais Royal\r\nArcades. Then there was Walter Savage Landor, who started with\r\nadmiration for Napoleon, but found ‘not an atom of liberty left.’\r\nHe witnessed the festival in the Tuileries gardens in honour of the\r\nlife-consulate, and he wrote to his brother: ‘I expected that the sky\r\nwould have been rent with acclamations. On the contrary, he (Bonaparte)\r\nexperienced such a reception as was given to Richard III. He\r\nwas sensibly mortified. All bowed, but he waved to and fro, and often\r\nwiped his face with his handkerchief. He retired in about ten minutes.’\r\nOn returning home and reprinting his _Gebir_, Landor appended a\r\nqualifying note to his line:\r\n\r\n    ‘A mortal man above all mortal praise.’\r\n\r\nHe called on Paine, and in his _Imaginary Conversations_ (fifth series,\r\nXI.) introduced a minute description of him. He represents him as\r\nuncombed, unshaven, and unwashed, and as solacing his misfortunes by\r\nbrandy, yet he makes him foresee Napoleon’s inordinate ambition and\r\nfall. Landor revisited Paris in 1814 and 1840. Paine, by the way, was\r\nescorted to Havre at the end of August 1802 on his way to America by\r\nThomas, or ‘Clio,’ Rickman, a versifier if not exactly a poet, who\r\nnamed his six sons Paine, Washington, Franklin, Rousseau, Petrarch,\r\nand Volney. They were surely to be pitied. Another versifier was\r\nWilliam Parsons, who in 1785 had published a magazine at Florence and\r\nhad associated there with Madame Piozzi, Robert Merry, and Bertie\r\nGreatheed. Greatheed, as we have seen, was also now in Paris.\r\n\r\nAmongst other writers of works of imagination were Thomas Hope, the\r\nauthor of _Anastasia_, art connoisseur, and father of Beresford\r\nHope;[105] William Combe, who had married Mrs. Cosway’s sister, author\r\nof _Dr. Syntax_, a book widely read in its day; and Edgeworth,\r\nwho was arrested and but for Whitworth’s remonstrance would have been\r\nexpelled. He fancied that he had been taken for a brother of the Abbé\r\nEdgeworth, Louis XVI.’s confessor, a distant kinsman whom he\r\nhad never even seen; but the police register[106] states that he had\r\nindulged in ‘indiscreet talk.’ His eldest son Lovell, as we shall find,\r\ndid not come off so lightly. Edgeworth was accompanied by his fourth\r\nwife, his distinguished daughter Maria, and her younger half-sister\r\nCharlotte. He had intended to stay two years, but happily left in time.\r\nMaria revisited Paris in 1820.\r\n\r\nMore matter-of-fact writers included Anthony Aufrere, an art\r\nconnoisseur, a contributor to the _Gentleman’s Magazine_, a\r\ntranslator from the German and Italian, and editor of _Lockhart’s\r\nLetters_. Hazlitt, the critic and essayist, who was introduced to\r\nProsper Merimée’s father, the artist, copied at the Louvre, and paid a\r\nsecond visit in 1824. Filon fancifully suggests that the unborn Prosper\r\nwas influenced by his mother’s impression of Hazlitt. There was also\r\nJohn Allen, the Edinburgh Reviewer, a ‘man of vast information and\r\ngreat conversational powers,’ says Macaulay, but who, living with Lord\r\nHolland from 1801 till his death in 1843, wrote little. John Gifford,\r\nthe Tory pamphleteer, editor of the _Anti-Jacobin Review_, a\r\ncontinuation of the famous _Anti-Jacobin_, had been the author,\r\nconcocter, or arranger of _Letters from France in 1792_. His\r\nvisits to France did not lessen his insular prejudices. In contrast to\r\nhim there was David Williams, Nonconformist minister and schoolmaster,\r\nbut now best known as founder and secretary of the Royal Literary\r\nFund. He had been in Paris in the winter of 1792, but seemingly did\r\nnot attend the British dinner at which an address to the Convention\r\nwas adopted. Madame Roland regretted that he had not been elected a\r\nmember of that body in lieu of Paine, but he had reason to congratulate\r\nhimself on this. Lebrun, Minister of Foreign Affairs, entrusted him\r\nwith a letter to Grenville regretting the imminence of hostilities and\r\nsuggesting that, as in the previous war, a few packets might continue\r\nto ply between Dover and Calais;[107] but the letter received no\r\nanswer. James Anderson, whose extensive view ranged from chimneys to\r\ncattle-breeding and political economy, had corresponded with Washington\r\non ‘moral philosophy and agricultural topics.’ Last, but far from\r\nleast, was Henry Hallam, as yet a young man of twenty-five.\r\n\r\nWe now come to four men who made France their home. Quintin Craufurd,\r\na nabob from Manila, acting on his maxim, ‘Make your fortune where\r\nyou like, but enjoy it at Paris,’ settled there in 1780. He provided\r\nthe carriage in which the royal family in 1791 attempted to escape.\r\nHe himself had gone to Brussels, perhaps expecting to meet them,\r\nand not venturing to return, his furniture was confiscated. He was\r\nnow able to resume life in Paris, and frequently played whist with\r\nTalleyrand, for cards were his passion. Herbert Croft, nominally a\r\nclergyman as well as a baronet, though he had little of the reverend\r\nabout him, and was dependent on a Government pension of £200, had been\r\nthe friend of Johnson, whom he furnished with a life of Chatterton.\r\nHe, like Boswell, was duped by the Ireland forgeries. Just too late\r\nto succour Chatterton, he was also just too late to succour a French\r\npoet, Grainville, a cousin of Bernardin de St. Pierre; but he happily\r\ndid not foresee a more direct connection with a third suicide, that of\r\nhis brother and successor in the title, Princess Charlotte’s surgeon.\r\nHe wrote in the _Argus_ in 1805 in favour of peace. Becoming the\r\ncompanion of Lady Mary Hamilton, daughter of Lord Leven, another state\r\npensioner (but only to the amount of £80), Croft in 1809 engaged\r\nCharles Nodier as his secretary, and Nodier for two years turned into\r\nFrench his and the lady’s productions. Both these amateur authors died\r\nin 1816.\r\n\r\nThe third Anglo-Frenchman was John Fraser Frisell, a Glasgow student\r\nwho in 1792, at the age of sixteen, went to France to complete his\r\neducation. Enthusiastic for the Revolution, he was imprisoned for\r\nfifteen months at Dijon during the Terror. That imprisonment, however,\r\nprocured him the lifelong friendship of fellow-captives, Guitant and\r\nhis wife, who offered him a home from 1794 to 1802, and he thus became\r\nintimate with Chateaubriand and Joubert. Chateaubriand styled him the\r\nGreek Englishman. Marrying a Frenchwoman, he indulged his passion for\r\nGreek authors, for the chase, and for travelling. On the death of a\r\ndaughter in 1832, Chateaubriand, then himself a political prisoner,\r\nwrote an elegy on her. Frisell published in French a treatise on the\r\nBritish constitution, and presented a copy of it to Louis Napoleon\r\nin Switzerland, who promised him in return his own sketch of a\r\nFrench constitution. Frisell also contributed to the _Journal des\r\nDébats_.[108] He turned Catholic just before his death, which took\r\nplace at Torquay in 1846.\r\n\r\nThe fourth Anglo-Frenchman was Henry Grey MacNab, a scion of a\r\nScotch-Irish family who had studied under Reid at Glasgow University.\r\nWhen detained in 1803 he went to Montpellier for eleven years, there\r\nstudying medicine, political economy, and pedagogy. Before quitting\r\nEngland he had published a pamphlet against a proposed tax on coal,\r\nand in Paris in 1808 he wrote on education, on Robert Owen, of whom\r\nhe was an enthusiastic admirer, and on the state of the world at the\r\nbeginning of the 19th century. He was honorary physician to the Duke\r\nof Kent, to whom he dedicated his book on Owen and whose portrait he\r\nprefixed to the French translation. He died in Paris in 1823, leaving\r\nan unfinished work on premature burial.\r\n\r\nSome visitors deserve notice on account of kinsmen or friends.\r\nThere are Mary and Agnes Berry, for instance, the ‘sister-wives’ of\r\nHorace Walpole, one of whom, born in 1743, survived till 1852. They\r\naccompanied their father. Mrs. Damer introduced them to Napoleon, his\r\nmother, Josephine, and Madame de Staël. This last lady thought Mary\r\nby far the cleverest Englishwoman she had met. The Berrys had seen\r\nParis in 1791. They must have been pleased with their visit in the\r\nspring of 1802, for they went again in October with Mrs. Damer on\r\ntheir way to Nice and Geneva, passing through Germany and embarking at\r\nHamburg for England in May. We may dispose more summarily of Francis\r\n(brother of Sir John) Moore; William Monsell, whose son, successively\r\nPaymaster-General, Postmaster-General, and Vice-President of the Board\r\nof Trade, became Lord Emly; and Sir Herbert Pakington, grandfather of\r\nthe Secretary for War of 1867–1868. Henry Bickersteth, surgeon, was the\r\nfather of the hymnologist and of Lord Langdale, Master of the Rolls,\r\nwhile Sir Henry Tichborne and his brother James were respectively\r\ngreat-uncle and grandfather of the Roger Tichborne personated by\r\nArthur Orton. Henry Herbert Southey, a youth of nineteen studying\r\nmedicine at Norwich, had there made the acquaintance of William Taylor,\r\nwhom he now accompanied. His brother, the poet, had, on a visit to\r\nNorwich in 1798, formed a friendship with Taylor, in spite of their\r\npolitical and religious differences. Young Southey became physician\r\nto George iv. and Queen Adelaide.[109] Timothy Priestley must have\r\nbeen the son of Timothy, brother of the famous Priestley. The two\r\nbrothers, both Nonconformist ministers, differed in doctrine. James\r\nWollstonecraft was probably one of the three brothers of Mary. He was a\r\nLondon merchant, and in 1798 had been expelled from Paris, apparently\r\nas a suspected spy. A Mr. Adderley was probably Charles Bowyer\r\nAdderley, great-uncle of the present Lord Norton, but he may have been\r\nThomas Adderley, an Irish M.P. in 1790. Mrs. Peploe of Herefordshire,\r\nwho accompanied her husband, was the aunt of Sir George Cornewall\r\nLewis. Anthony Storer, Secretary of the Paris Embassy in 1783, was\r\napparently the nephew and heir of Anthony Morris Storer of Purley, a\r\nman of fashion and a bibliophile, an M.P. in 1772. General Scott was\r\nprobably the father-in-law of Canning and of the Duke of Portland; he\r\nwas reputed to have made money at previous visits by gambling, and\r\nCanning’s wife had a bequest of £100,000. Shuckburgh Ashby Apreece had\r\na fascinating wife, the widow of a John Kerr. Her literary receptions\r\nat Edinburgh were famous, and people fancied she was the original of\r\nMadame de Staël’s _Corinne_. Again a widow, she married in 1812\r\nSir Humphry Davy. A Mr. Tilt was probably the father of John Tilt, a\r\nBrighton physician who introduced into England the speculum, with which\r\nhe had become acquainted through Récamier. Denis Disney Ffytche was\r\ndoubtless the nephew of Dr. John Disney, a Lincolnshire vicar related\r\nI think to the Tennysons, who became a noted Unitarian minister in\r\nLondon, and also of Lewis Disney of Swinderby, who added his wife’s\r\nname of Ffytche. If so, he must have been bent on recovering his\r\nuncle’s property at Chambourcy, near Paris, for Lewis Disney, leaving\r\nfor Switzerland with his two daughters and their governess in March\r\n1793, had been classed as an _émigré_ and had vainly pleaded for\r\nrestitution. James Forbes, a nabob of whom we shall hear again, was the\r\ngrandfather of Montalembert, the French historian. Of Richard Trench,\r\na barrister, father of Archbishop Trench, we shall also hear later on.\r\nJohn Sympson Jessopp, a landowner and barrister, was destined to be\r\nthe father of Dr. Augustus Jessopp. He was accompanied by his younger\r\nbrother, and we shall hear of them too again.\r\n\r\nShould we reckon among Englishmen George Francis Grand, Madame\r\nTalleyrand’s first husband? He was a native of Lausanne, but entered\r\nthe East India Company’s service, started an English factory, and\r\nmarried in India Catherine Noel Judde, daughter of Peter John Worle, a\r\nDane, harbour-master of Chandernagor. He divorced her in India, and in\r\n1798, having returned to Europe in straitened circumstances, obtained\r\na French, divorce likewise. He now repaired to Paris, to solicit\r\nthrough his ex-wife’s influence a Government appointment; but he was\r\nunjustly suspected of seeking to extort money from Talleyrand. It was\r\nalleged, indeed, that he exacted 80,000 f. by a threat of disputing the\r\nvalidity of the divorce, and that on returning to London he demanded\r\nan additional £10,000. ‘Never did a husband,’ writes a Bourbon agent,\r\n‘make so much profit out of his wife’s infidelity, and never did a man\r\nplay so pitiful a role as M. de Talleyrand.’[110] What is certain is\r\nthat Grand was assigned a post at the Cape under the so-called Batavian\r\nrepublic, really a French dependency. When England seized the Cape he\r\nremained there till his death in 1821.[111] He is said to have married\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThere were fugitives from law or justice, and other black sheep.\r\nWilliam Ward, yeoman and land-agent of Benenden, Kent, who had been\r\nenthusiastic for the French Revolution, got into difficulties--‘through\r\nslovenly book-keeping’ says Mr. C. F. Hardy, editor of the _Benenden\r\nLetters_,--and took refuge in France, where he died in 1821, aged\r\nninety-three. He had settled at Valenciennes, and under the Berlin\r\ndecree of 1807 was for five years, in spite of his age, treated as a\r\nprisoner of war. His honesty seems unimpeachable, but as much cannot\r\nbe said for another land-agent, Thomas Stone, who had acted for the\r\nDuke of Bedford and for Lord Digby. They had every apparent reason to\r\ntrust him, for he was an Enclosure Commissioner and was employed by\r\nthe Board of Agriculture in writing county reports. His love of style\r\nand conviviality, however, led him astray, and he now absconded to\r\nParis with his wife and five children, leaving a large sum due to Lord\r\nDigby. He for a time lived in luxury, affected to be bent on improving\r\nFrench agriculture, and talked of buying and stocking a large farm.\r\nIn reality he had no money, and in 1804 he was charged with forging a\r\ncheque, but was acquitted. He more than once applied for permission to\r\nvisit Normandy to buy sheep, but was refused.[112] Latterly dependent\r\non the earnings of his wife and daughter, he died in Paris in 1815, at\r\nthe age of eighty-three. Speaking of land-agents reminds me that some\r\nsmall English land-owners, as the Marquis of Buckingham was informed,\r\nsold their property, invested part of the proceeds in the funds, so as\r\nto ensure the same income as before, and had settled in France on land\r\npurchased at ten and a half years’ rental. Such cases, however, must\r\nhave been very rare, and Napoleon, as we have seen, debarred foreigners\r\nfrom holding real property; but Thomas Talbot, brother of an admiral,\r\nmay have had the idea of colonisation in France, though he ultimately\r\nobtained a grant of 5000 acres on the shore of Lake Erie, where he\r\nfounded Port Talbot. As for artisans who went over, enticed by reports\r\nof high wages and cheap living, they were speedily disillusioned and\r\nwere glad to return.\r\n\r\nWe may include among the outlaws, though he was not of English birth,\r\nBodini, who had been editor of _Bell’s Messenger_ and had been\r\nexpelled under the Alien Act. He joined the staff of the _Argus_\r\nin Paris. A note of the French police describes him as a man of\r\ncaustic speech, turning everything into ridicule, and consequently\r\nhaving no friends. He pretended, it says, to have made important\r\nrevelations to Napoleon, for whom, according to another account, he\r\ndissected, so to speak, the London newspapers.\r\n\r\nWe come lastly to _émigrés_ who took the opportunity of returning\r\nto France, for several of them were Britons by birth, while others,\r\nhaving resided in England, possess some interest for us. There was\r\nCharles Jerningham, who had served in the French army, and now,\r\nreclaiming confiscated papers, pleaded that he had never in exile\r\nfought against France.[113] Lady Jerningham, his mother, however,\r\nwas so patriotic an Englishwoman that on the renewal of the war she\r\nproposed to raise and head a body of six hundred men, who, in case of\r\ninvasion, should drive all the cattle from the East Anglian coast into\r\nthe interior of the country. Daniel Charles O’Connell, of Darrynane,\r\nstyled in France Count O’Connell, uncle of the Liberator, was one of\r\nthe earliest arrivals. Entering the French army in 1762 at the age\r\nof seventeen, he had taken part in the siege of Gibraltar in 1766,\r\nand in 1788 had drawn up articles of war by which the French army is\r\nstill governed. On the fall of the monarchy he went to England, where\r\nin 1796 he married the Countess Bellevue, an exile like himself. In\r\nFebruary 1802 he repaired to Paris with his wife and two stepdaughters,\r\nin the hope of recovering her property in St. Domingo. He calculated\r\non returning in August, but he stayed, as we shall see, too long.\r\nHe was naturalised in 1818, and was made a French peer; he died in\r\n1835. Another _émigré_ was Arthur Dillon, a connection of the\r\nguillotined general of that name, who had with difficulty escaped\r\nfrom France during the Terror. Curiously enough Réné de Montalembert,\r\nthough an _émigré_, visited Paris as an English officer, for\r\nin 1799 he had entered the British army, and had served in the West\r\nIndies and Egypt. He afterwards served in India and Spain, rising to\r\nthe rank of lieutenant-colonel, but after Waterloo returned to France\r\nand was appointed to an embassy at Stuttgart. He had married in 1808\r\nJames Forbes’s daughter, Eliza Rose, and their son, mostly brought\r\nup by Forbes, was the historian of whom Pasquier aptly said, ‘he is\r\nan Anglo-Saxon Frenchman.’ Fagan, ex-captain in Dillon’s regiment,\r\nwho also re-entered France, was despatched in 1810 by Fouché, without\r\nNapoleon’s knowledge, to discuss peace with Lord Wellesley. This\r\noccasioned Fouché’s dismissal. Alexander d’Arblay preceded his English\r\nwife, the famous Fanny Burney. His friend Lauriston had arranged that,\r\nafter serving a year in St. Domingo, he should retire from the French\r\narmy on a pension; but on his writing an indiscreet letter to Napoleon\r\nto say that he could never bear arms against England he was struck off\r\nthe roll. Hoping, however, that Napoleon’s irritation would evaporate,\r\nhe sent for his wife and child in April 1802, and on war breaking out\r\nthey were unable, being French subjects, to return to England till\r\n1812, when, during the Emperor’s absence, d’Arblay managed to procure\r\na passport for them. He himself had meanwhile obtained a post in the\r\nMinistry of the Interior. Lally Tollendal, who went over to obtain\r\nrestitution of his property, had also married an Englishwoman, Amelia\r\nHardcastle, and in April 1802 she rejoined her husband and his daughter\r\nby his first wife.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent of the returning exiles was Calonne, Louis\r\nXVI.’s Minister of Finance. He was the man who, when asked\r\nby Marie Antoinette to do something which she acknowledged to be\r\ndifficult, replied, ‘If it is merely difficult, madam, you may consider\r\nit already done: if it is impossible it shall be done.’ Shortly after\r\nhis dismissal from office he had married Madame Haveley, widow of a\r\nrich Paris financier. She is described as English, but I am unable to\r\nascertain her maiden name. Taking refuge in England in 1788, and there\r\nassisting Madame La Motte in her scurrilous pamphlet on the diamond\r\nnecklace, Calonne was at first very bountiful to his fellow-exiles, but\r\nhe soon quarrelled with them. He went to Paris in May 1802, but must\r\nhave intended returning to England, for he had applied to Merry for\r\na passport when he was taken ill, and expired on the 30th September.\r\nAnother prominent politician was Montlosier, the member of the National\r\nAssembly who, in opposing the confiscation of the bishops’ revenues,\r\nexclaimed, ‘You deprive them of their gold crosses, but they will\r\ntake the wooden cross which has saved the world.’ He had edited the\r\n_Courrier de Londres_, which was so favourable to Napoleon that he\r\nwas allowed to return from exile and have his paper partly printed in\r\nParis. It was, however, suppressed after a few weeks, and Montlosier\r\nwas appointed editor of the _Bulletin de Paris_, in which he\r\nrequited British hospitality by vilifying the English. In all other\r\nrespects his political career down to his death in 1838 was highly\r\ncreditable. Cazalès, who before emigrating had deprecated violent\r\nmeasures in the National Assembly, also re-entered France, and was\r\noffered, but declined, office under the Consulate.\r\n\r\nThe Duke and Duchess de Fitz-James--he was a descendant of James\r\nII. with the bend sinister--were _émigrés_ of a different\r\nstamp, being staunch royalists. So also, I believe, was Colonel\r\nO’Mahony. Patrick Wall, who at eighteen had in 1745 been with the\r\nYoung Pretender, had been wounded at Culloden, and had then entered\r\nthe French army, in like manner returned to France. An uncle, also a\r\nJacobite refugee, had bequeathed him a handsome property. He died at\r\nChatillon-sur-Seine in 1809.\r\n\r\nThe returning exiles included a multitude of priests. Sir John Carr\r\ncrossed over from Southampton to Havre with some of them, one being,\r\nhe says, ninety-five years of age, who was scarcely expected to land\r\nalive. There were also wives and daughters of Toulon refugees. It\r\nis unpleasant to read in Henri Martin’s history that some of these\r\nclerical passengers afterwards repaid the hospitality they had enjoyed,\r\nby vilifying England in episcopal pastorals, in order to curry favour\r\nwith Napoleon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                      AMUSEMENTS AND IMPRESSIONS\r\n\r\n   Parisian Attractions--Napoleon--Foreign Notabilities--Mutual\r\n   Impressions--Marriages and Deaths--Return Visits.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now time to ask what was seen and done by the visitors. The\r\nrue de Rivoli did not yet exist, and a labyrinth of dingy streets\r\nseparated the Tuileries from the Louvre, but the Champs Elysées were\r\nan agreeable promenade, though of course not yet terminated by the Arc\r\nde Triomphe, and the Bois de Boulogne had recovered from the vandalism\r\nof the Revolution, while on Sundays, when Napoleon held receptions at\r\nSt. Cloud, the road thither was as crowded with carriages as that to\r\nVersailles before 1789. Lovers of art had the opportunity of inspecting\r\nthe spoils of Italy, a portion of which had to be restored in 1815,\r\nthough but for Napoleon’s escape from Elba restitution would not have\r\nbeen demanded. He told Lord Ebrington who, as will be seen, visited\r\nhim in that island that he felt some remorse at having thus despoiled\r\nItaly, but he had then thought only of France. Not only was the Louvre\r\nthus enriched with paintings and sculptures,[114] but the bronze\r\nlion and horses of Venice had been placed on pedestals outside the\r\nTuileries. The biennial Salon also opened at the Louvre in September\r\n1802, and in another part of the building was the Industrial Exhibition\r\nvisited, as we have seen, by Fox. This, according to a police report,\r\nparticularly interested the English. ‘Among them,’ it says, ‘have been\r\nnoticed artisans, who were never tired of examining and admiring, while\r\nothers tried to understand the mechanism of the objects exhibited.\r\nSome observers conclude that this study may lead to imitation of\r\nthese productions in England.’ But the visitors might be proud of\r\nseeing several of their countrymen among the medallists, viz., Hall,\r\nwho had a pottery at Montereau, near Fontainebleau, and Christopher\r\nPotter, of whom more anon. Engraving on glass, too, had been carried\r\nto perfection by Robert May O’Reilly, an Irishman whose factory\r\nattracted visitors. He published in 1803 a monthly magazine on arts\r\nand manufactures. A member of the British Club at Paris in 1792–1793,\r\nhe had since served in the French army. He audaciously visited London\r\nduring the peace, thus risking arrest for high treason.[115] There\r\nwas also the opportunity of witnessing Fulton’s steamboat experiments\r\non the Seine. Fulton mostly lived in Paris from 1799 to 1804, vainly\r\ntrying to interest the Government first in torpedoes and then, with a\r\nview to the invasion of England, in steam navigation. He lived with\r\nJoel Barlow, with whom he speculated in panoramas, then a popular\r\nnovelty. Both, however, went over to England in the summer of 1802.\r\nMerry granted a passport to Barlow, but did so by mistake in ignorance\r\nof his relations with English agitators, and he suggested that a\r\nlist of obnoxious foreigners should be sent him, so that he might in\r\nfuture refuse such applications. Yet Barlow after all used an American\r\npassport. In notifying a passport to Fulton, Merry, mindful of his\r\nproposal for blowing up English vessels, added the warning, ‘verbum\r\nsap.’ Fulton was back in Paris in August in 1803, for in that month\r\nhis steamboat, in the presence of Carnot and Volney, went up and down\r\nthe Seine for an hour and a half. Another, but much less important,\r\nimprovement in locomotion was the first attempt, at the instance of\r\nDillon, a Hiberno-Neapolitan engineer, to introduce foot pavements.\r\nGuizot married his daughter as his second wife. Professor Charles,\r\nwhose future young wife was Lamartine’s _innamorata_, lectured on\r\nchemistry, moreover, to fashionable audiences. His electrifying machine\r\nand scientific apparatus at the Louvre were inspected by Carr. Dupuis,\r\nwho had sat in the Convention, could be heard expounding his cosmical\r\nexplanation of myths, which had been enthusiastically adopted by his\r\nfriend Lalande and by the Abbé Barthélémi. Dupuis also claimed to have\r\nin 1778 invented semaphore signals.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Morellet, last survivor of the Encyclopedists, might be met\r\nin society, full of revolutionary and pre-revolutionary experiences;\r\nand Roget de l’Isle, the author of the Marseillaise, frequented\r\nFrascati gardens. Henri Beyle was also in Paris, having just quitted\r\nthe army, and was taking lessons in English from Dawtram and an Irish\r\nFranciscan whom he calls ‘Jeki,’ but nobody could foresee in him\r\nthe future Stendhal, who was to illumine French literature; nor did\r\nSutton Sharpe, junior, till long afterwards make his acquaintance.\r\nSénancour was probably in Paris, superintending the publication of\r\n_Obermann_, but he was not likely to be seen in the frivolous or\r\nfashionable circles frequented by the English. A few of the visitors,\r\nindeed, attended lectures,[116] listening attentively and putting\r\nquestions to Laplace, Lalande, or Cuvier, but the great majority\r\nwere bent on pleasure. Frascati, Tivoli, the hotel Richelieu (the\r\n_roué’s_ old mansion and grounds, now used not only for a hotel\r\nbut for balls and concerts), and the so-called Hameau Chantilly were\r\nthronged, not to speak of the theatres, which had a very profitable\r\nseason. Molé, it is true, retired in April 1802, dying in the following\r\nDecember, but there were such tragedians as Talma, Raucourt, Contat,\r\nMars, and George, such dancers as Vestris, who was about, however,\r\nto retire, such vocalists as Cherubini, such instrumentalists as\r\nKreutzer. In February 1802 there was the opportunity of witnessing\r\nDuval’s _Edouard en Écosse_, which (though intended only as a\r\nglorification of the Young Pretender, who in France was always styled\r\nEdward) was so boisterously applauded by royalists as applicable\r\nto the Bourbons, that Napoleon, present at the second performance,\r\nsuppressed it. Blangini taught singing, and among his pupils were Miss\r\nWhitworth, Quintin Craufurd’s wife and step-daughter, Lady Conyngham,\r\nLady Annesley, and Lady Liddell. The _Journal des Dames_ of May\r\n10, 1802, speaking of the influx of parents anxious for their children\r\nto learn accomplishments, says:--‘In what other European city could\r\na pupil have two musicians like Garat and Plantade for singing, two\r\nprofessors like Staybelt and Puppo for the piano, two virtuosi like\r\nBode and Kreutzer for the violin, two composers like Paesiello and\r\nMéhul for music, and a man like Deshayes for dancing?’ Paris, moreover,\r\nin spite of the Revolution again set the fashions, and though its\r\ntransparent dresses, ‘worn with such grace,’ says George Jackson, ‘as\r\nto reconcile you to them,’ had never, whether on account of modesty or\r\nclimate, been adopted in England, the _Times_ in 1801 described\r\nthe way in which Parisian ladies wore their hair. Lap-dogs were\r\nfrequently to be seen under the arms of promenaders, or in fine weather\r\nrunning at their heels.[117] Shoe-buckles and knee-breeches, though not\r\nwigs, had been revived, and foreign ambassadors were resplendent with\r\ndecorations and diamonds; yet ‘muddy boots and dirty linen were seen\r\nat Madame Fouché’s receptions,’ ‘the roughnesses of the Revolution,’\r\nsays Jackson, ‘not being yet polished off.’ Mademoiselle Bertin, Marie\r\nAntoinette’s dressmaker, had returned from exile. Bonaparte, too, had\r\nimposed costumes on all public functionaries, and Paris had never seen\r\nmore brilliant uniforms. His two hundred Mamelukes had been sent up\r\nto Paris to figure in the review of the 14th July, which was then, as\r\nit is now again, the national festival, and in honour of the peace he\r\nreviewed 14,000 troops in the Carrousel.\r\n\r\nNapoleon took particular note of the British military uniforms at his\r\nreceptions, and many British officers witnessed a grand review by\r\nMoreau on the 8th September 1802. Maurice Dudevant, the future father\r\nof George Sand, wrote to his mother:--\r\n\r\n   ‘All these young lords, who are soldiers at home, question me\r\n   with avidity on our army. I reply by the recital of our immortal\r\n   exploits (in Italy), which they cannot sufficiently admire.’\r\n\r\nAs for private and official festivities, visitors were all anxious\r\nto see Madame Tallien, ‘our Lady of Thermidor,’ now, as I have said,\r\nthe mistress of the army contractor Ouvrard. Madame Récamier gave\r\nmusical parties at Clichy, she herself playing on the piano. Madame\r\nde Montesson, morganatic widow of the Duke of Orleans, Madame Lebrun,\r\nwife of the consul, and Madame Junot (Duchess d’Abrantès) also gave\r\nentertainments. At some of these Garat’s inimitable voice was to be\r\nheard, though he no longer sang in public. Madame de Genlis, though\r\nnot able on her pension of 6600 f. to afford dinners, received callers.\r\nTalleyrand had been, or was about to be, forced by Napoleon to marry\r\nMadame Grand, as the only alternative to dismissing her, in order that\r\nambassadors’ wives might visit his house, and he was very hospitable\r\nto English notabilities, though there is no reason to think that our\r\nGovernment had given him the £16,000 on which, as Francis Jackson\r\nwrote to Speaker Abbot, he counted for having concluded peace. Spain,\r\nhowever, had given him a like sum, and Jackson satirically suggested\r\nthat such presents would serve as a _trousseau_ for the lady on\r\nthe arrival of the dispensation from Rome. But Talleyrand received\r\na dispensation, not from the vow of celibacy, but merely from the\r\nobligation of daily reciting the breviary. Whitworth was therefore\r\nmistaken in justifying his wife’s acceptance of Madame Talleyrand’s\r\ninvitations on the ground that the church had sanctioned her marriage.\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ of January 13, 1803, says:--\r\n\r\n   ‘Monsieur, or rather Madame, Talleyrand’s dinners, exceed all\r\n   others in Paris; about 80 persons sat down to the last dinner.\r\n   On the table was placed every delicacy possible to be had, and a\r\n   servant in livery, belonging to the house, behind every chair.\r\n   The second course, put on like magic, more elegant than the\r\n   first; around the room, in niches made for the purpose, were\r\n   statues of the finest marble, each supporting a basket on its\r\n   head, holding a branch of lustres of about ten lights each,\r\n   altogether making more than four hundred lights in the room;\r\n   the furniture of velvet and gold, corresponding with the other\r\n   elegancies; three rooms were fitted up in this manner, forming a\r\n   most complete suit. A very handsome salary is allowed to this\r\n   Minister, exclusively for the support of his table.’\r\n\r\nTalleyrand doubtless allowed his guests plenty of time to do justice\r\nto his sumptuous fare, whereas Napoleon unpleasantly hurried over his\r\ndinners in half an hour. He deputed prefects, however, to preside in\r\nhis place at less expeditious state banquets.\r\n\r\nLechevalier, of the Foreign Office, who had lived in England and had\r\ntaught French to Sir F. Burdett and his wife and her sisters, also laid\r\nhimself out to be agreeable to British visitors. There was a rage for\r\ndancing, not dancing on a volcano ready to explode, as was said in July\r\n1830, but on the ashes of an extinct one.\r\n\r\nConversation, on the other hand, as we learn from German visitors,\r\nlanguished. The salons of the old monarchy, where brilliant paradox\r\nand ruthless scepticism had flourished, found no successors. It was\r\nnot safe to talk politics, for spies abounded, and even the Institute\r\nhad to avoid philosophy, legislation, or sociology.[118] Riddles were\r\nconsequently in vogue. But La Métherie, the mineralogist, and his\r\nguests ventured to condemn the tyranny of the Consulate, and Besnard\r\nrelates how Lord Archibald Hamilton, after hearing one of these\r\noutbursts, exclaimed, ‘Too fortunate Frenchmen! You have apricots,\r\npeaches, cheap and good wine, and yet you complain,’ while, turning\r\nto Besnard, he whispered: ‘A peach with us costs 4/ or 5/ and a\r\nbottle of champagne or burgundy a guinea.’ The old nobility, indeed,\r\nsuch of them as had remained or returned, were too impoverished to\r\nlive in great style, but the _nouveaux riches_, financiers and\r\ncontractors, had installed themselves in rural mansions, yet did not\r\nsucceed in imitating the old aristocracy. They were lavish in some\r\nthings, parsimonious in others. Stables, gardens, and woods were\r\nallowed to become slovenly. ‘There is at present no veritable society,’\r\nsays a contemporary, and nobody in the country kept open house.[119]\r\n‘Those people who chose to be presented at Bonaparte’s court,’ says\r\nMrs. Villiers (afterwards Lady Clarendon), ‘were invited to many\r\nmagnificent dinners and assemblies (balls) given by the ministers, but\r\nas ourselves, with a very few other exceptions, did not feel inclined\r\nto pay homage to Bonaparte, the theatres and the entertainments given\r\nby foreigners were mostly our resources.’[120] Mrs. Villiers was\r\ncertainly, as she says, an exception, as also were Montagu and Ryder,\r\na future peer who declined to be introduced to Napoleon, for it was\r\nnot till the renewal of the war that admiration turned to hatred and\r\nthat Bonaparte became a bogey with which children were frightened. Even\r\nthen no Englishman would have gone the length of saying, as a French\r\necclesiastic has done nearly a century afterwards, that ‘Napoleon was\r\nthe greatest enemy of God and of mankind. Would that his name could be\r\neffaced from human memories!’[121] A royalist agent remarks:--\r\n\r\n   ‘M. de Calonne states that in England the enthusiasm for\r\n   Bonaparte is not only general, but carried to an extent which it\r\n   is difficult to conceive. The Court and the city, the capital\r\n   and the provinces, all classes of citizens, from ministers to\r\n   artisans, are agreed to publish his praises and vie in chanting\r\n   his victories and the lustre of his rule.’[122]\r\n\r\nYet Phillips’s _Practical Guide during a Journey from London to\r\nParis_, the first book of its kind, had said:--\r\n\r\n   ‘We shall only express our wish that the great man who has done\r\n   so much for France and mankind may moderate his ambition and\r\n   make the illustrious Washington his political model.’\r\n\r\nEnglishmen anxious to see republican forms and manners were satirically\r\nrecommended by the _Times_, December 1, 1802, to lose no time in\r\nvisiting Paris, or the whole ancient system of the court, with all its\r\nformalities and regulations, would arrive before them. ‘The ladies of\r\nthe old court,’ it added,--\r\n\r\n   ‘are in great request in the circle of Madame Bonaparte, and\r\n   several of the most pronounced royalists among the emigrants are\r\n   already _bien acclimatés_ at the _Thuilleries_. In the\r\n   gardens of this palace, no persons are admitted to walk in the\r\n   Jacobin costume. _Cocked hats_ are indispensable to all who\r\n   would not be turned out by the sentries. The high _ton_\r\n   and extravagance of dress are generally restored, and the\r\n   fashions at least are as Anti-Jacobin as possible. _Tu_ and\r\n   _Toi_, and _Citoyen_, which for some time have been\r\n   banished to the Faux-bourghs and the Offices, are totally out of\r\n   use in addressing the Consul or Ministers, and would pass for\r\n   the grossness of disaffection at Court. In short, everything\r\n   is returning rapidly to that gaiety, splendour, and urbanity,\r\n   which is the characteristic of the nation. It was the ingenious\r\n   expression of a distinguished lady a few nights since at the\r\n   _Thuilleries_--that “she saw the whole of the ancient\r\n   monarchy excepting the Bourbons!”’\r\n\r\nThis reminds us of Victor Hugo’s well-known couplet:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Ce siècle avait deux ans, Rome remplaçait Sparte,\r\n    Dejâ Napoléon perçait sous Bonaparte.’\r\n\r\nA letter from an officer published in the same journal on the 9th\r\nFebruary 1803 says:--\r\n\r\n   ‘Nothing can be more wretched or discontented than all\r\n   descriptions of people; all ruined except a few upstarts, who\r\n   are immediately self-interested in the present system. It is\r\n   completely a military government, and the country is kept quiet\r\n   by the bayonet alone:--taxed at half their income, and more\r\n   taxes to be laid on.\r\n\r\n   ‘The roads wretched--cut up by the artillery and\r\n   ammunition-waggons, and in no places repaired, but a little\r\n   picked in on the straight road from Calais to Paris for Lord\r\n   Cornwallis. Crowded with turnpikes, the produce of which is\r\n   applied to the public purse, and not to mend their ways. The\r\n   Inns, as formerly, dirty, and good eating and drinking very\r\n   dear. The lower classes are civil,--the higher very haughty.\r\n\r\n   ‘Yet notwithstanding the distress and poverty of the country,\r\n   there are no less than 26 theatres open and crowded every night\r\n   in Paris, independent of shows, jugglers, etc. Nobody can form\r\n   an idea of what an _Opera_ is, unless they have seen the\r\n   present style of one in Paris--so superb.\r\n\r\n   ‘The Bishop of Durham would expire at seeing the dresses of the\r\n   performers. The ladies are almost quite naked, and really not\r\n   covered enough to give the least idea of modesty. There cannot\r\n   be anything so profligate, so debauched, or so immoral, as the\r\n   ideas or manners of all ranks of people, particularly the higher\r\n   class; and poor Virtue and Decency are entirely banished their\r\n   Calendars.\r\n\r\n   ‘The daughter of Madame Bonaparte sits every night in a crimson\r\n   and gold box at the Opera. The Consul in one directly below,\r\n   with a gilded grating towards the audience, who see very little\r\n   of him. He leaves the house before the dropping of the curtain,\r\n   and escorted by a strong guard of cavalry and torches sets off\r\n   full gallop for Malmaison, where he sleeps.’\r\n\r\nAnother visitor is reported by the _Times_ as describing Paris as\r\n‘more immersed in luxury than at any former period. The theatres are\r\nevery night full, and the political coffee-houses, unless on particular\r\noccasions, nearly empty. Provisions of every kind are cheap and\r\nplentiful, and the best wine may be had at three livres the bottle.’\r\n\r\nWhether by way of entertaining one another or of reciprocating French\r\nhospitality, some of the British visitors gave receptions and balls.\r\nMaurice Dudevant speaks of Lady Higginson’s balls, where he seems to\r\nhave heard French nobles decrying their own country, and he warned\r\nEnglishmen against judging France by this unpatriotic class. He may\r\nhave been one of Lord Robert Spencer’s guests at Robert’s famous\r\nrestaurant. The Duchess of Gordon and Mrs. Orby Hunter were prominent\r\nfor their entertainments, and a Paris newspaper mentions those of Lady\r\n‘Shumley,’ a phonetic approximation to Cholmondeley. Jerningham speaks\r\nof the Duchess of Gordon’s balls, and of her addiction to playing\r\nat _hasard_, at which she rattled the dice, and whenever she\r\nlost exclaimed, ‘God damn!’ Eliza Orby Hunter, aged twenty-three, was\r\napparently the wife of George Orby Hunter, who afterwards, living at\r\nDieppe, translated Byron into French verse, and died in 1843.[123] The\r\nOrby Hunter family were owners of Croyland, Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\n‘Paris,’ wrote Colonel Ferrier to his sister, ‘is certainly the place\r\nof all others for young men. Plenty of amusement without dissipation;\r\nno drinking; if a gentleman was seen drunk here he would be looked upon\r\nas a perfect _bête_.’[124] If, however, there was less drinking\r\nthan in London, there was clearly more gambling. John Sympson Jessopp\r\nleft with the impression that debauchery abounded. With the natural\r\nEnglish desire to see everything, he found himself one night, with his\r\nyounger brother, in a magnificent gambling-house. Somebody who had lost\r\nheavily fell upon the croupier, snatched his rake from him, laid about\r\nhim furiously, then hit out at a huge chandelier, with scores of wax\r\ncandles in it, and frantically smashed it. There was terrible panic\r\nand confusion. One of the croupiers slipped out through a door leading\r\nto a staircase to fetch the police. Jessopp, plucking his brother by\r\nthe sleeve, managed to get down the stairs and into the street, where\r\nthey concealed themselves in a doorway. In a few minutes a company\r\nof gendarmes hastened up, and leaving two of their comrades at the\r\ndoor mounted the stairs, arrested every soul on the premises, and\r\ncarried them off to the lock-up. The two young Englishmen, watching\r\ntheir opportunity, hurried back to their hotel. The sequel they never\r\nheard.[125] Francis Jackson, moreover, writing to Abbot, described\r\nParis life as an uninterrupted picture of vulgarity and profligacy, and\r\nthe _Times_ of the 23rd September says:--\r\n\r\n   ‘Paris, under the Regent of Orleans, was not so profligate\r\n   and corrupt as it appears to our best travellers at present.\r\n   Gambling, debauchery, intemperance, and the insatiable\r\n   desire after public spectacles, with all the vices in the\r\n   train of indolence and licentiousness, form the monotonous\r\n   indiscriminable character of the Citizens.’\r\n\r\nSome of the visitors must have shared in the stupefaction felt on the\r\n21st January 1803 at seeing the Madeleine draped in crape in memory\r\nof the anniversary of Louis XVI.’s death, but they were as\r\nignorant as the rest of the world that this audacious celebration was\r\nthe act of a man of English parentage, Hyde de Neuville. The Madeleine,\r\nas Holcroft tells us, was then ‘a grand colonnade of lofty uncorniced\r\npillars, rising about roofless, half-finished walls.’\r\n\r\nBritish visitors had the opportunity of mixing with some of their\r\ncountrymen. There was Paine, until his return in September 1802 to\r\nAmerica, where his friend Jefferson had become President, and we have\r\nseen that Redhead Yorke and Rickman renewed acquaintance with him. He\r\nhad had to wait, not only for funds, but for a safe passage without\r\nfear of British cruisers. When Redhead Yorke with some difficulty\r\nrecalled himself to his remembrance, Paine thus unbosomed himself:--\r\n\r\n   ‘Who would have thought that we should meet [again after the\r\n   lapse of ten years] at Paris?... They (the French) have shed\r\n   blood enough for liberty, and now they have it in perfection!\r\n   This is not a country for an honest man to live in. They do\r\n   not understand anything at all of the principles of free\r\n   government, and the best way (for foreigners) is to leave them\r\n   to themselves. You see they have conquered all Europe only to\r\n   make it more miserable than it was before....\r\n\r\n   ‘Republic! Do you call this a republic? Why they are worse off\r\n   than the slaves at Constantinople, for they are ever expecting\r\n   to be bashaws in Heaven by submitting to be slaves below; but\r\n   here they believe neither in Heaven nor Hell, and yet are slaves\r\n   by choice. I know of no republic in the world except America,\r\n   which is the only country for such men as you and I. It is my\r\n   intention to get away from this place as soon as possible,\r\n   and I hope to be off in autumn. You are a young man, and may\r\n   see better times, but I have done with Europe and its slavish\r\n   politics.’\r\n\r\nPaine, it may be feared, experienced another disillusion on recrossing\r\nthe Atlantic. Yorke does not seem to have told him of his own change of\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nNext to Paine in celebrity comes Helen Maria Williams, an eyewitness\r\nof the Revolution, whose reminiscences of Madame Roland must have been\r\ninteresting. She was visited by Sharpe, Rogers, Lord Holland, Kemble,\r\nPoole, and Mrs. Cosway, though some English held aloof or even sneered\r\nat her. Her attire and manners were certainly open to ridicule,[126]\r\nand her cohabitation with John Hurford Stone, the refugee printer, even\r\nassuming a secret marriage, exposed her to misconstruction. Stone’s\r\nbrother William, ruined by twenty-one months’ imprisonment and arrested\r\nfor debt on his acquittal for treason, had also gone to France, where\r\nhe became overseer of a paper-hanging factory. We shall hear of him\r\nagain. There was the widow of Sir Robert Smyth, who remained in Paris\r\nafter her husband’s death. She and her young children had been painted\r\nby Reynolds, and one of those children now married Lambton Este, a son\r\nof Charles Este, by turns actor, clergyman, and journalist. Smyth’s old\r\npartner, James Millingen, son of a Dutch merchant settled in London,\r\nhad remained in Paris after the Revolution, though his brother John\r\nGideon had become an English naval official. He was afterwards an\r\neminent archæologist, and his son Michael, archæologist and physician,\r\nattended Byron on his deathbed. Anastasia Howard, Baroness Stafford,\r\nan ex-nun, had likewise stayed in Paris after her release at the\r\nend of the Terror,[127] though her fellow-nuns had in 1800 found a\r\nretreat in England. She died in 1807 at the age of eighty-four. Her\r\nnephew Charles Jerningham called on her, but though in good health,\r\nsenility scarcely allowed her to recognise him. This reminds us of her\r\nco-religionists at the Austin convent. They, too, had survived the\r\nRevolution, and the Superior, Frances Lancaster, must have had much\r\nto tell Sir John Carr of how the nunnery was turned into a crowded\r\npolitical prison. Arabella Williams, daughter of David Mallet, author\r\nof _Northern Antiquities_, had had more recent troubles. She\r\nhad spent most of her life in Paris, but visits to London to obtain\r\nher share of her mother, Lucy Estob’s, property brought on her the\r\nsuspicion of the police and she was arrested. The banker Perregaux\r\nand others had to exonerate her from the charge of espionage.[128]\r\nAnother but more recent resident, representing the _demi-monde_,\r\nthough that term had not yet been invented, was Mrs. Lindsay, the\r\nEllenore of Benjamin Constant’s _Adolphe_, that romance of the\r\nWerther and Corinne school, in which the heroine, depicted as a Pole\r\nwho deserts her old paramour and her children by him, clings to a man\r\nanxious to discard her. We do not even know her Christian name, unless\r\nshe was the ‘Lady Florence Lindsay’ whom Lady Morgan met at Florence\r\nin 1819. She is said to have been Irish on the father’s and French on\r\nthe mother’s side; handsome and sprightly, she had been brought up\r\nin good society. She had lived in Paris from 1786 to 1792, and her\r\nconfiscated tradesmen’s bills, still in the Archives,[129] indicate\r\nthat she was then the mistress of Comte de Melfort, a man of Scottish\r\nJacobite ancestry. Another of her lovers was Vicomte Chrétien de\r\nLamoignon, who, the last of his family, was wounded at Quiberon, and\r\nafter the Restoration was created a peer. She left France in 1792, and\r\nin 1795 Chateaubriand made her acquaintance in London, where she was on\r\nvisiting terms with the French aristocratic exiles. He styles her _la\r\ndernière des Ninon_. On his going to France in disguise in 1800 she,\r\nhaving meanwhile returned to Paris, met him at Calais, escorted him,\r\nand hired temporary lodgings for him near her own house. She paid half\r\nthe rent and another friend the remainder. Constant met her in 1804,\r\nand after passing an agreeable evening with her, received a letter in\r\nwhich she said that they strikingly resembled each other, but ‘this\r\nis perhaps one reason the less against our suiting each other. It is\r\nbecause men resemble each other that Heaven created women, who do not\r\nresemble them.’[130] Constant would have married her, however, but\r\nfor her age and for her two illegitimate children. Charles Constant,\r\nBenjamin’s cousin, describes her as intelligent but devoid of culture.\r\nIn 1801 she translated into French Cornelia Knight’s _Life of the\r\nRomans_. It is commonly stated that she died at Angoulême in 1820;\r\nbut if so it was under an assumed name, for I have ascertained that\r\nthere is no Lindsay on the register. Then there was Mrs. Harvey,\r\n_née_ Elizabeth Hill, naturalised in Tuscany, who in 1805 was\r\narrested on an unfounded charge of complicity in Georges’ plot. Her\r\ndaughter Henrietta, a miniature painter, petitioned for her release\r\nand the restitution of her papers, the petition being backed by Denon,\r\ncurator of the Louvre. Scipio du Roure, son of the Marquis de Grisac\r\nand grandson of the Countess of Catherlough, Bolingbroke’s sister,\r\nmay almost be regarded as an Englishman, for he had been educated\r\nat Oxford. He eloped with a Mrs. Sandon, who fired at her pursuing\r\nhusband, whereupon du Roure was prosecuted as the delinquent. A flaw\r\nin the indictment secured his acquittal, but he had to take refuge in\r\nFrance. He arrived in the middle of the Revolution and was a member of\r\nthe Paris Jacobin Commune, but was imprisoned in the Terror. He was\r\nnow studying jurisprudence and translating Cobbett’s _Grammar_.\r\nHe went back to London to claim his mother’s property and that of a\r\nhalf-brother named Knight, and died there in 1822.\r\n\r\nThe war, putting a stop to British imports, had given a stimulus to\r\nFrench manufactures, several of which were carried on by Englishmen.\r\nThese were mostly in the provinces, and English tradesmen had scarcely\r\nyet reappeared in Paris. Henry Sykes, for instance, unable to continue\r\nselling Wedgwood’s pottery in the rue St. Honoré, had in 1792 started\r\ncotton-spinning at St. Rémy, though he had originally applied for\r\nand obtained the use of the unfinished Madeleine as a factory. The\r\nConvention, on the 29th April 1795, granted him a site for the erection\r\nof cotton mills at La Magdelaine, near Verneuil (Eure). He was joined\r\nin 1802 by his future son-in-law, William Waddington, of Walkeringham,\r\nNotts, a descendant of Charles II.’s Pendrells. Waddington,\r\nthe grandfather of the French statesman of our day, apparently had a\r\nvisit from his brother Samuel, a hop merchant at Tunbridge, who had\r\npublished an answer to Burke’s famous pamphlet, and in 1801 had been\r\nsentenced to £500 fine and a month’s imprisonment for ‘forestalling.’\r\nHis fellow hop-merchants gave him an ovation on his release. Then there\r\nwas Christopher Potter, who had been an army victualler and whose\r\nelection for Colchester in 1784 led to the Act disqualifying Government\r\ncontractors from sitting in Parliament. His successful opponent was Sir\r\nRobert Smyth, and the two rivals may have met in Paris. He reopened\r\nduring the Revolution the porcelain factory at Chantilly formerly\r\ncarried on by the Condé princes, thus justifying his name--_nomen\r\nomen_--but he had now removed to Montereau. A police report of the\r\n8th March 1796 thus denounced him:--\r\n\r\n   ‘The Anglo-Pitts purchase nearly all the national property which\r\n   is sold in the department of the Oise. Their chief broker is a\r\n   man named Poter (_sic_), owner of the porcelaine factory\r\n   at Chantilly, a man who was deep in debt two years ago, but who\r\n   has now paid up and is worth more than two millions. He was\r\n   twice arrested under the revolutionary government. This man was\r\n   twice M.P. in England, and belonged to the Court party. There\r\n   is no doubt that he is in France the secret agent of Pitt, with\r\n   whom he has been closely connected since the Revolution. He\r\n   made many visits to England in 1792 and 1793. Since that time\r\n   he has remained at Paris or Chantilly, where he daily makes\r\n   purchases.’[131]\r\n\r\nThis report was made by an ‘observer’ named Martin, whose chief, Marné,\r\nsent it in as usual to the Directory. That body, or probably Barras,\r\nwho seems to have examined these daily reports, instructed Marné to\r\ninquire whether Potter really visited England in 1792–1793, whether\r\nthere was any proof of his connection with the court party, whether\r\nthere was any probability of his being Pitt’s agent, and what purchases\r\nhe had made. Martin replied to this veiled rebuke on the 13th March:--\r\n\r\n   ‘I have learned nothing further on Poter. My object was not to\r\n   denounce him. I do not know him intimately. I have merely had to\r\n   do my duty as observer, and to call attention to him, according\r\n   to notices which have been transmitted to me by persons whom I\r\n   believe to have no interest in calumniating him. My guarantee of\r\n   all the facts is therefore solely for the purpose of my mission.\r\n   It is then for the Government to watch any particular person.\r\n   Here, however, is my reply to the various questions which have\r\n   been submitted to me by citizen Marné, and which I subjoin.\r\n\r\n   ‘1. Poter paid visits to England in 1792 and 1793, without this\r\n   implying that he was betraying our cause, for our relations with\r\n   England were not suspended till the middle of 1793 if I remember\r\n   rightly.\r\n\r\n   ‘2. The real fact, and which Poter cannot contradict, is that\r\n   he was twice M.P., and that the kind of popularity which he\r\n   had gained induced the Court to place him on the list of\r\n   candidates in 1783 or 1784 for making him a Minister. Pitt\r\n   was the successful man. After that he fought a duel with the\r\n   latter.[132] Was it because he was not a Minister?\r\n\r\n   Thus the question whether he had then thrown himself into the\r\n   Court party remains to be solved. It would not perhaps be\r\n   difficult to ascertain the fact, for it is well known that Fox,\r\n   driven from office, became more popular than ever. It is also\r\n   known that he drew the Prince of Wales into the Opposition.\r\n\r\n   ‘3. As to this I will repeat what I have said above. It is for\r\n   the Government to order its agents to watch him. As for me I\r\n   promise to neglect nothing in Paris, and if any positive facts\r\n   reach me I will transmit them to the Directory. Only yesterday I\r\n   ascertained where he lives and the places which he frequents.\r\n\r\n   ‘4. It is quite certain that Poter has made purchases besides\r\n   his Chantilly factory. To ascertain this it will merely be\r\n   necessary to apply to the Senlis district. I remember having\r\n   stated in my report of the 16th (_sic_) that Poter eighteen\r\n   months ago was in everybody’s debt, and that now he had settled\r\n   with everybody. This is perhaps what has given rise to the\r\n   belief that he might have dealings with Pitt in France, for in\r\n   fact his fortune at this moment is marvellous; but it may be the\r\n   result of great speculations or of stock-jobbing, which in the\r\n   last twenty months has made the fortune of so many.\r\n\r\n   ‘I think I have dwelt enough on this subject. I repeat that my\r\n   sole object has been to do my duty as surveillant. I will add\r\n   this. Formerly entrusted with powers by the General Security\r\n   Committee in the department of the Oise, I ascertained that\r\n   Poter did much good at Chantilly, that he professed republican\r\n   principles, and that I had even occasion to render him justice\r\n   before the committee against the persecution which for eleven\r\n   months he had been undergoing from the Chantilly revolutionary\r\n   committee.’\r\n\r\nThese reports seem to have induced Barras to make Potter’s acquaintance\r\nand to send him first to Malmesbury[133] in Paris in 1796, and next to\r\nLondon in 1797, with an offer to conclude peace for a handsome bribe.\r\nOn his return he warned the Directory that one of its members regularly\r\ncommunicated its deliberations to England. These relations with Barras\r\nprobably protected him from further molestation during the Directory,\r\nbut on the 13th December 1800 a police bulletin again denounced him as\r\nan English emissary sent to ruin French pottery and hat-making.[134] In\r\n1800 he was a first-class medallist at the Paris Industrial Exhibition,\r\nand in 1802 he was one of the gold medallists to whom Napoleon gave a\r\ndinner. His Montereau factory, an old monastery where he employed a\r\nhundred men, was burnt down in 1802. He probably remained in France\r\ntill 1814; he died in England three years later.\r\n\r\nAmong the silver medallists in 1802 was White, a mechanical inventor,\r\nprobably the uncle or grandfather of Dupont White, sub-Minister of\r\nJustice in 1848, President Carnot’s father-in-law. The exhibits also\r\nincluded a filter by Smith, an Englishman, perhaps the James Smith who\r\nin 1813 succeeded to Stone’s printing business.\r\n\r\nThere were of course teachers of English. They included Robert, of whom\r\nNapoleon might have learned the language at the Paris military school,\r\na lost opportunity which he regretted; Mrs. Galignani, _née_\r\nParsons, who had married an Italian ex-priest, ultimately the founder\r\nof the newspaper bearing his name; and Samuel Baldwin, employed before\r\nthe Revolution in the French Foreign Office, who was arrested as a spy\r\nin the Terror, and having been inscribed on a long list of prisoners\r\nfor trial would, but for Robespierre’s fall, have been guillotined.\r\nHe had taught English to the Royal Family before 1789, and he was\r\naccused of associating with priests and receiving frequent letters\r\nfrom Calais. He latterly published English and Spanish lesson books,\r\nand died in 1804, aged seventy-nine. There were also Cresswell,\r\nDavies, Fox, Hickie, Boswell, Macdermott, who kept a school, Stubbs,\r\nwho had a reading-room with such English newspapers as were allowed\r\nto enter France, and Roche, probably Hamilton Roche, teacher at the\r\nmilitary school, whose son Eugenius became a journalist in London.\r\nThere were also two maiden ladies named Haines, ultimately joined by a\r\nMrs. Poppleton, who carried on a school. She was probably the wife or\r\nwidow of George Poppleton, who had taught English. There was likewise\r\nthe daughter of a Scotsman named James Mather Flint, the widow of\r\nthe clever but unprincipled anti-revolutionary pamphleteer Rivarol.\r\nFlint and his wife settled about 1734 in France, where their daughter\r\nLouisa in 1768 translated into French one of Shakespeare’s plays with\r\nDr. Johnson’s notes,[135] and Johnson wrote to her in French a letter\r\nof thanks, in which he humorously rallied her on detaining in Paris\r\nthe sister of Sir Joshua Reynolds. Fanny Reynolds had apparently gone\r\nto lodge with the Flints, for Northcote is incorrect in stating that\r\nLouisa accompanied her to France. Reynolds himself in the following\r\nyear, when visiting Paris, called on the Flints. On the death of his\r\nwife, Flint, who had embraced Catholicism, entered the priesthood\r\nand received a small benefice which was supplemented by a pension of\r\n200 francs from the General Assembly of the Clergy. This pension he\r\nenjoyed till the Revolution, and he must have died before 1793, for\r\nhis daughter alone was then arrested as an Englishwoman. She had, it\r\nis true, in 1780 married Rivarol and had given birth to a son, but\r\nRivarol had long deserted her, leaving her and her infant in such\r\ndistress that the Montyon prize, much to his mortification, was awarded\r\nin 1788 to a Frenchwoman who had kindly succoured them. Madame Rivarol\r\nafterwards tried to maintain herself by translations from the English.\r\nHer faithless husband died in Germany as an _émigré_ in 1810, and\r\nher son Daniel was now serving till his death in 1810 in the Danish or\r\nRussian army. She herself survived till 1821. She is not likely to have\r\nbeen hunted up by any of her fellow-Britons in 1802 or 1814.\r\n\r\nNor were political refugees likely to be sought by them, otherwise\r\nthey might have made numerous acquaintances. Most of them were Irish,\r\nbut King mentions two Englishmen, Ashley, an ex-member of the London\r\nCorresponding Society, who had a flourishing business in Paris, and\r\n‘Hodgson,’ a hatter, either Richard Hodson, one of the Reformers\r\nprosecuted in 1794, or William Hodson, who in December 1793 incurred\r\ntwelve months’ imprisonment and a fine of £200 for saying that the\r\nworld would not be happy till there were no more kings. There was\r\nalso one Scot, Robert Watson, who had crossed the Channel in 1798,\r\nsecretary and biographer of Lord George Gordon, alleged teacher\r\nof English (but more probably ‘skimmer’ of English newspapers) to\r\nNapoleon, rescuer from rain and rats of the Stuart papers at Rome; his\r\ncareer was full of romance, and it ended in the tragedy of suicide at\r\na London inn at the age of eighty-eight. As for the Irish, some had\r\nbeen long domiciled in France, while others had just been liberated\r\nunder a secret article, or at least a secret understanding, of the\r\nTreaty of Amiens. They would, according to French documents, have been\r\nexecuted in Ireland but for the threat of reprisals against General\r\nSir George Don, who, as will be explained hereafter, had been arrested\r\nin France.[136] These ex-prisoners included James Napper Tandy, given\r\nup by Hamburg, along with James Blackwell, Hervey Montmorency Morris,\r\nand Wm. Corbett, to Sir James Craufurd, but all claimed by Napoleon\r\nas French officers.[137] Tandy landed at Bordeaux in March 1802,\r\nand died there in the following year, not having been allowed to go\r\nto Paris. In December 1802, describing himself as a French general,\r\nhe sent a challenge to Elliott, an English M.P., who had spoken of\r\nhim as an ‘arch traitor,’ and on Elliott taking no notice of his\r\nletter he denounced him as a coward.[138] Morris, who had fought for\r\nAustria against the Turks before fighting for the French Revolution,\r\nafter a visit to Paris returned to Ireland, but in 1811 rejoined the\r\nFrench army. Corbett had escaped from Kilmainham prison, an episode\r\nutilised by Miss Edgeworth in one of her stories. He, too, joined\r\nthe French army, became a general, and later on helped to liberate\r\nGreece. Blackwell, who, a student in the Irish College, had joined in\r\nthe attack on the Bastille, was penniless on now landing in France,\r\nand Napoleon first gave him 6000 francs and then a pension of 3000\r\nfrancs ‘for his services to liberty,’ Napoleon not having yet ceased\r\nto talk of liberty. In 1803 Blackwell commanded Napoleon’s Irish\r\nlegion, Corbett serving under him, as also John Devereux,[139] who,\r\nthough a conspirator of 1798, waited on Lord Whitworth with a letter\r\nof introduction from Lord Moira. He was permitted in 1819 to enlist\r\nrecruits for Bolivar at Dublin, the British authorities being doubtless\r\nglad thus to get rid of restless spirits. He became a general in the\r\nservice of Colombia, and in 1825 revisited Paris, where, as a ‘most\r\nactive and dangerous man,’ his movements were suspiciously watched\r\nby detectives.[140] Arthur O’Connor, nephew of Lord Longueville and\r\nex-M.P. for Cork, has been already mentioned. He married Condorcet’s\r\ndaughter, and latterly devoted himself to agriculture and to his\r\nvillage mayoralty. He just lived to see the French empire restored.\r\nRobert Emmet returned to Dublin in October 1802, and was executed for\r\na fresh conspiracy. So also was Thomas Russell, who while a soldier\r\nin Ireland became acquainted with Tone and was won over to his views.\r\nThomas Addis Emmet, Robert’s brother, went in 1804 to New York, where\r\nhe became a barrister. William James Macnevin likewise crossed the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nOther Irishmen had been or were now employed in the French civil\r\nservice. Aherne, an ex-priest, had served under Delacroix or Carnot.\r\nNicholas Madgett was in the Foreign Office under the Directory, as\r\nalso a nephew, Sullivan, who had been a professor of mathematics\r\nat La Flèche and had gone with Hoche’s expedition to Ireland.[141]\r\nEdward Joseph Lewins, who had dubbed himself first Luines and then de\r\nLuynes, as though related to the French duke of that name, had been\r\neducated at the Irish College, Paris. Sent by the United Irishmen to\r\nFrance, he was employed by the Directory in missions and reports,\r\nand on the abandonment of French expeditions to Ireland he joined\r\nthe Duc de Larochefoucault-Liancourt in industrial enterprises,\r\nto carry on which he applied for the reimbursement of his secret\r\nservice expenses. Talleyrand endorsed this application.[142] He was\r\nafterwards the _soi-disant_ Thompson who, according to Goldsmith,\r\nwas employed in opening English letters at the post-office, for he\r\nhad been originally in the Irish post-office. He subsequently had\r\nappointments in the Foreign and Education Offices. He was still\r\nliving in Paris in 1824, but his son refused, doubtless for cogent\r\nreasons, to give any information on him to Madden for his history of\r\nthe United Irishmen. William Duckett, one of the instigators of the\r\nmutiny of the Nore, had been employed by the diplomatic committee of\r\nthe Convention, but eventually turned pedagogue. Patrick Lattin, so\r\nbrilliant in conversation, according to Lady Morgan, as to reduce\r\nCurran and Sheil to silence, had served in the Franco-Irish brigade\r\ntill 1791, and was in the carriage when Theobald Dillon was murdered\r\nby his troops at Lille in 1792. He had settled near Lyons, but\r\noccasionally visited Paris, where he died about 1849. But it is not\r\nalways easy to distinguish him from another Lattin. John Fitzgerald,\r\nalso a Franco-Irish officer, had emigrated at the Revolution but\r\nreturned in 1802, and his dinners from 1823 to 1836 drew the best\r\nBritish and French company.[143] William Putnam M’Cabe, one of Lord\r\nEdward Fitzgerald’s bodyguard in 1798, was now starting a cotton mill\r\nnear Rouen, but sold it in 1806 to Waddington. He had hairbreadth\r\nescapes from arrest on repeated visits to England and Ireland, and died\r\nin Paris in 1821. He had been intimate with Tone,[144] the funeral of\r\nwhose daughter Mira in March 1803 drew together all the Irish refugees.\r\nTone’s son had entered the French army, but after Waterloo went to\r\nAmerica with his mother, who then married an old Scottish friend,\r\nHugh Wilson of Bordeaux. In 1803 she took out a patent for clarifying\r\nliquids. Wilson, after a roaming life, ended his days at Santa Cruz in\r\n1829.\r\n\r\nThe English, of course, found many foreigners in Paris, though except\r\nin the aggregate in much smaller numbers than themselves. The Russians\r\nwere already noted for their prodigality. Swedes were tolerably\r\nnumerous. The Germans were mostly economical. Among Americans were\r\nRufus King, Livingston, Jay, the Ambassador at London, and the future\r\npresident, Monroe. There was also Colonel James Swan, a native of\r\nDunfermline, but one of the ‘Boston tea-party,’ whose contracts with\r\nthe French Government had involved him in litigation with his partner\r\nSchweizer, and who, rather than meet what he considered an unjust\r\nclaim, was to undergo twenty-two years’ imprisonment in a Paris\r\ndebtors’ prison.[145] Count Rumford, the inventor, now likewise settled\r\nin Paris.[146] The visitor of highest rank was the Prince of Orange,\r\nafterwards suitor to our Princess Charlotte and ultimately King of\r\nHolland. His father had sent him from London to claim an indemnity\r\nfor the loss of the statthalterate, and he appears to have succeeded\r\nin his mission. Charlotte’s eventually successful suitor, Leopold of\r\nSaxe-Coburg, also visited Paris, but not till 1810, when he offered, it\r\nis said, to be aide-de-camp to Napoleon. Higher destinies awaited him.\r\nThe Russians and Poles included Count Zamoiski, Count Potocki, Prince\r\nTroubetski, Prince Galitzin, and Princess Demidoff, an accomplished\r\ndancer. Nor should we forget Kosciusko, who had failed to liberate\r\nPoland. Shepherd found him in a cottage near the barriers, with a small\r\ngarden which he cultivated himself. He must have been able to relate\r\nPolish imitations of the French Revolution--a massacre of prisoners, a\r\nrevolutionary tribunal, pillages, and confiscations; but he could claim\r\ncredit for Stanislas having been honourably treated as a captive, in\r\nlieu of having been executed like Louis XVI. Possibly a South\r\nAmerican youth, Bolivar, the future Liberator, made his acquaintance.\r\nThere was also Madame de Krudener, the Delphine of Madame de Staël’s\r\nstory, now famous for her beauty and her gallantries, not yet for the\r\nmysticism which was to captivate the Tsar Alexander and the Queen of\r\nPrussia. She was at this time enamoured of the singer Garat, but was\r\nshortly to accompany her sick husband who, before reaching Aix, his\r\ndestination, died of apoplexy. Madame de Staël herself, described\r\nin a police note as known for her love of intrigue, was not yet\r\nbanished from the capital outside which she was miserable, and there\r\nwas her satellite, Benjamin Constant, not yet much known, though he\r\nhad been arrested in 1796 for declaring that France needed a king. A\r\nfellow Swiss visitor was Pestalozzi, the educationist, noted by the\r\npolice as having an English pension. Another educationist was the\r\nGerman Campe, who in 1792, along with Cloots, Paine, Priestley, and\r\nothers, had received French citizenship. He was surprised to find the\r\nParisians taciturn and apathetic, instead of being lively, talkative,\r\nand enthusiastic as in 1792. Science was represented by Oersted,\r\nwho, however, was as yet merely a youth who had gained a travelling\r\nscholarship.\r\n\r\nAlexander Humboldt did not arrive from South America till 1804, but\r\nhis brother William, statesman and philologist, was spending three\r\nyears in Paris. Germany also sent the Landgrave of Hesse Rothenburg\r\nand Princess Hohenzollern, the latter anxious to purchase the field in\r\nwhich her guillotined brother, Prince Salm Kyrburg, had been buried.\r\nPrince Emanuel of Salm, apparently her uncle, accompanied her on\r\nher pious mission. Adam Gottlob von Moltke, a cousin of the famous\r\nstrategist and like him a Dane, was a versifier of the Klopstock school\r\nand was intimate with Niebuhr. On the outbreak of the French Revolution\r\nhe had styled himself Citizen Moltke. He helped to draw up the\r\nSchleswig-Holstein constitution. Another Danish visitor was Baggesen,\r\nwho had witnessed the Revolution, imitated Klopstock and Wieland, and\r\nenjoyed a pension from his sovereign. Samson Heine, father of the\r\npoet, a Dusseldorf merchant, was a visitor on business, like several\r\nof his Jewish co-religionists. His son was too young to accompany him.\r\nAnother business visitor was Johann Maria Farina, who opened depôts for\r\nhis ‘veritable eau de Cologne.’ Frederic Jacobi, a friend of Richter,\r\nwent in vain quest of health. He revived his acquaintance with Count\r\nSchlabrendorf, whom he had met in London in 1786. ‘For eight years,’\r\nsaid Schlabrendorf, reviewing his revolutionary experiences, ‘it was\r\nhere all a scuffle like a village beershop, everybody pitching into\r\neach other. Then came Bonaparte with a “stop that.” The first thing\r\nhe did was to blow out the candles. He wanted no questions settled,\r\nbut merely the stoppage of disputes. Liberty or no liberty, religion\r\nor no religion, morality or no morality, was all immaterial to him.\r\nLiberty and equality remain, and now nobody opens his mouth or\r\nstrikes another.’ I may here remark that the comparison of Bonaparte\r\nto Cromwell, obvious as it now appears to us, was not made by any\r\nEnglish observer, though it did not escape German visitors. Jacobi\r\nalso went to see St. Martin, the disciple of Boehme and Swedenborg,\r\nwho had known William Law in England in 1787, and regarded the French\r\nRevolution as a precursor of the Day of Judgment. St. Martin, who\r\nwas living in seclusion till his death in October 1803, said to him,\r\n‘Everybody has told you I am mad, but you see that I am at least a\r\nhappy madman. If, moreover, some madmen should be fettered there are\r\nothers to be left unfettered, and I think myself one of the latter.’ A\r\ndisciple of Jacobi, Jacob Frederic Fries, who had been educated by the\r\nMoravians and was ultimately a professor at Jena, was also a visitor.\r\nHis democratic opinions for a time occasioned his suspension from his\r\npost. Frederic Schlegel, an intimate friend of Novalis, studied at the\r\nLouvre, was taught Sanscrit by Alexander Hamilton, and lectured on\r\nGerman literature and philosophy. He and his Jewish wife, a daughter\r\nof Moses Mendelssohn, embraced Catholicism in 1803. Less eminent than\r\nhis brother Augustus, he was an orientalist and art critic. Living with\r\nthem at Montmartre was Helmine von Klenke, who had made an unfortunate\r\nmarriage with Baron Hastfer, and having divorced him was destined to be\r\nbut little more successful with a second mate, Chézy, to whom Schlegel,\r\nhis teacher of Persian, introduced her. Helmine was cured of a violent\r\nheadache by Mesmer, who sat beside her at dinner, and unobserved by the\r\nother guests made some passes over her forehead. Mesmer, unlike what\r\nhappened to him in 1781 and 1785, attracted no curiosity. Helmine also\r\nmet Hardenberg, the future Prussian statesman, Achim von Arnim, a poet\r\nand novelist, and Mademoiselle Rodde, daughter of a Swiss professor,\r\nand herself at seventeen adorned with a doctor’s degree.[147]\r\nReichardt, the composer, and Fabricius, the Danish naturalist, should\r\nalso be mentioned. Dietrich Heinrich von Bülow, who had twice visited\r\nAmerica, had there embraced Swedenborgianism, had been ruined by a\r\nglass speculation, and was now dependent on his pen, likewise visited\r\nParis. An admirer of Napoleon, this historian and pamphleteer had had\r\nadventures, and was destined to have others. Julius von Voss, poet and\r\nnovelist, was another visitor.\r\n\r\nLast but not least among the German visitors comes Schopenhauer. His\r\nfather, Henry Florian Schopenhauer, a Hamburg merchant, with his wife\r\nand son, went to London in July 1802. Leaving Arthur at school with\r\nthe Rev. Thomas Lancaster at Wimbledon, the parents travelled about\r\nEngland and Scotland. They got back to London in October, and after a\r\nsix weeks’ stay all three embarked for Rotterdam. Mercier, the prolific\r\nwriter, showed them the sights of Paris. In January 1803 they proceeded\r\nto Bordeaux. Thence father and son returned to Hamburg, while the\r\nmother went to Toulouse, Toulon, Hyères, and Switzerland, an account of\r\nwhich trip she published. Pecuniary losses affected the father’s mind,\r\nand in 1805, at the age of fifty-nine, he fell or threw himself into\r\na canal. Griesbach denies that he committed suicide, alleging that he\r\nslipped through a trap-door in his warehouse into the canal. He was an\r\nhabitual reader of the _Times_, a taste inherited by his son.\r\n\r\nThe Italians include Bartolini, sculptor of a colossal bust of\r\nNapoleon, and a daughter of Beccaria, the Italian philosopher, who had\r\ninherited his intelligence and love of liberty, and possessed beauty\r\ninto the bargain. She had divorced her insane husband. Helen Williams\r\nin 1794–1795 had found her residing by the lake of Lugano. She seems\r\nto have settled in Paris in 1798, and Paine then made acquaintance\r\nwith her. She presented Redhead Yorke with a portrait of her father,\r\nand Holcroft was now struck by her intelligence and affability.\r\nAt her house he met Melzi, who had presented the keys of Milan to\r\nNapoleon on his entering that city, and who had scandalised lovers of\r\nliberty by accepting the vice-presidency of the so-called Cisalpine\r\nrepublic, though Napoleon soon superseded him by his step-son Eugène\r\nde Beauharnais. Another well-known Italian, though born in Paris, was\r\nCaraccioli, the author of _Pope Ganganelli’s Letters_ and many\r\nother works; but he was an octogenarian and died in 1803. Then there\r\nwas Casti, canon and poet, an imitator of Boccaccio. Prince Jerome\r\nMoliterno Pignatelli had figured in Neapolitan politics, and was now\r\nconspiring to deliver the Neapolitan ports to England. Though Merry\r\ngranted him a passport he was stopped at Calais and incarcerated in\r\nthe Temple, along with his English wife or mistress, a Mrs. Dorinda\r\nNewnham, an Irishwoman,[148] possibly the wife of a London alderman and\r\nex-M.P. She was again arrested at Rome in 1809, but liberated as being\r\nboth ill and mad. It was thought, however, that she had been forewarned\r\nof arrest and had burnt her papers.[149] Ultimately both of them got to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nHow did the English demean themselves and what was the impression\r\nproduced on both sides? Francis Jackson, writing on 2nd February 1802\r\nto Speaker Abbot, says:--\r\n\r\n   ‘I only wish you would extend the efforts of your police to keep\r\n   at home a parcel of disorderly women who come abroad without\r\n   bringing anything with them that does credit to the national\r\n   character. There is Lady C. (Cholmondeley), who is one day taken\r\n   up by the police and carried to the chief lock-up for persisting\r\n   to drive in the Champs Elysées at forbidden hours and through\r\n   forbidden roads. Another day she quarrels with people at the\r\n   masquerade. A third she invites a dozen Frenchmen and women to\r\n   her house and abuses them all for slaves. Then we have Lady M.\r\n   (Monck), whose dear friend would welcome H. M. Williams and who\r\n   gets into all the bad company in Paris. You must suppose it is\r\n   very bad when here it is reckoned _mauvais ton_. You really\r\n   should keep these people at home. As for your swindlers, of whom\r\n   there has been a nest here for some time, they are not near so\r\n   troublesome, for there are swindlers in all countries and the\r\n   police here is very good.’[150]\r\n\r\nThere is evidently a little exaggeration here, but we have already seen\r\nthat Lord Whitworth shut his doors against some of his countrymen whose\r\ninordinate admiration of Napoleon was not conducive to the maintenance\r\nof peace, since it must have given the impression that there was a\r\nstrong French party in England, so that Napoleon might dictate his own\r\nterms. Whitworth acknowledged that the Duke of Bedford, fully alive to\r\nNapoleon’s projects, conducted himself very properly, adding, ‘I wish I\r\ncould say as much of many of my countrymen and countrywomen.’[151] Lady\r\nOxford even considered Napoleon handsome--an opinion, says a royalist\r\nspy, not shared by a single Frenchwoman. The Duchess of Gordon, though\r\nanother of his admirers--pointing to his portrait she would say to the\r\nwife of Consul Lebrun, ‘Voilà mon zéro (héros)’--went rather beyond the\r\nbounds of politeness when, seated between Berthier and Decrès,[152]\r\nMinisters of War and Marine, she said, ‘I am always frightened when\r\nI look at you (Berthier), but fortunately you (turning to Decrès)\r\nreassure me.’[153] This, however, might pass for one of her usual\r\nsallies, intimating that the French army was formidable, but not the\r\nnavy. Yet Thibaudeau says:--\r\n\r\n   ‘Paris was infatuated with the arrival of these foreigners.\r\n   It was a scramble among all classes to give them the best\r\n   reception. It was the height of fashion to dine and amuse them\r\n   and give them balls; the women especially were enamoured of\r\n   the English and had a rage for their fashions. In short France\r\n   seemed to eclipse itself before a few thousands of these proud\r\n   and unprofitable foreigners, towards whom the attentions of\r\n   hospitality were carried to a ridiculous excess. Frenchmen of\r\n   the old school did not share this intoxication, but sighed over\r\n   this forgetfulness of national dignity.’[154]\r\n\r\nAnd Reichardt speaks of French fops parading English garments, horses,\r\nand dogs. Even Napoleon, he says, sent to England for horses and\r\nhounds. Frenchmen, with their keen sense of the ludicrous, were amused,\r\nhe tells us, with the middle-class Englishman, who had never previously\r\nvisited Paris. Caricaturists depicted him standing open-mouthed in\r\nfront of public buildings, with the wife in insular toilette or\r\ngrotesquely aping French fashions. A short play entitled _l’Anglais\r\nà Paris_, which was apparently never printed, doubtless made\r\ngood-humoured fun of the visitors.\r\n\r\nAt a theatre two of these were once so unceremonious as to take off\r\ntheir coats on a hot July night, whereupon there was a scene. They were\r\nobdurate, alleging that this was allowable in London, until a police\r\ninspector arrived and expostulated with them. Their habit of carrying\r\numbrellas and their nankeen or black gaiters were, however, adopted by\r\nthe French, but their beverages probably found less favour, albeit an\r\nEnglish tea-warehouse had been opened, as also a beershop which boasted\r\nof its _aile_ (sic) as especially suitable for cool or damp\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nVernet drew a caricature of the Duchess of Gordon as a stout woman\r\nholding her daughter by the hand. There were other family parties.\r\n‘English women,’ says the _Journal des Débats_ (Sept. 1, 1802),\r\n‘are readily to be distinguished. If their grave and becoming demeanour\r\nwere not sufficiently marked, the group of children accompanying\r\nthem would be more than enough to show the difference between them\r\nand Parisian ladies.’ Although tradesmen were glad to see English\r\ncustomers, they missed the extravagant _milords_ of old times.\r\nThe Cholmondeleys, indeed, had astonished Calais by their lavishness,\r\nrequiring five-and-twenty horses for their coaches to Paris, where they\r\nwere doubtless equally prodigal, and Lord Aberdeen was also lavish; but\r\nmost of the visitors haggled about prices, bought only cheap goods, and\r\nfrequented cheap restaurants. Even rich nabobs seemed bent on spending\r\nas little as possible. A royalist agent, while remarking that all\r\nEurope was infected with the enthusiasm for Bonaparte and hastened to\r\nParis to behold the great man at least once, says:--\r\n\r\n   ‘It is easy to see that curiosity alone attracts foreigners,\r\n   especially the English. The proof is that they never make a long\r\n   stay among us. They come to see the First Consul, attend the\r\n   parade and theatres, visit the museums and other curiosities;\r\n   then they leave. Paris is thus for foreigners merely a huge inn,\r\n   where they come to examine the consequences of the Revolution\r\n   and admire the masterpieces stolen from Italy and Flanders.’[155]\r\n\r\nThis is corroborated by a Weimar magazine, _London und Paris_,\r\nwhich speaks of the wealthiest visitors as apparently resolved on\r\neconomising, beating down shopkeepers and chiefly frequenting the\r\nmuseums and other gratuitous spectacles, or gaping from morning to\r\nnight in the squares and on the bridges. Campe speaks of a fortnight as\r\nthe average stay, and accepting the obviously exaggerated calculation\r\nof a Paris newspaper that there were 32,000 English arrivals a month,\r\nhe estimated that each spent 30 guineas and that Paris was the richer\r\nby 960,000 guineas a month. Reichardt estimated 20 guineas as the cost\r\nof the journey and of ten days’ stay in Paris.\r\n\r\nAs for English impressions of France a few words will suffice. Most\r\nof the ‘chiels’ who took notes were struck with the liveliness of\r\nFrench society. The absence of roughness and hustling in the crowds at\r\nfireworks and regattas also then, as now, attracted notice. Eyre speaks\r\nof the readiness with which Parisian crowds made way for foreigners.\r\nOn the other hand, the frequency of divorce and of _liaisons_\r\nexcited comment. King speaks of obscenity, immorality, and profligacy\r\nas universal in Paris, a remark which we might attribute to British\r\ncant but for his statement that he also saw drunken Englishmen\r\nreeling in the Palais Royal arcades. The term _monsieur_ had\r\nbeen generally revived, though in the public offices _citoyen_\r\nwas still retained. Madame Récamier showed visitors of both sexes\r\nher sumptuously furnished bedroom. Pinkerton and Hughes were charmed\r\nwith the affability and grace of Frenchwomen, and Williams wished\r\nFrance and England could bestow on each other the one gaiety the other\r\nseriousness, while Miss Plumptree vindicated the virtue of the great\r\nmajority of Frenchwomen. Miss Edgeworth was struck by the absence of\r\nbeggars on the coach-roads--in Paris, however, carriages were beset\r\nby them--and by the good manners of the lower orders. Forbes found\r\nthe coachdrivers so polite as to stop and allow their fair passengers\r\nto sketch the landscape. Eyre was delighted with the Palais Royal,\r\nwhereas Redhead Yorke styles it a den of iniquity, and Miss Plumptree\r\nconsidered its erection a greater sin of Égalité Orleans than even his\r\nJacobinical delinquencies.\r\n\r\nHolcroft, who had a French wife and had paid previous visits, tells us\r\nmore than other writers of comparative manners. He himself was taught a\r\nlesson of politeness. He was leaning against the mantelpiece apparently\r\nmonopolising the fire, when a girl came up and in lieu of saying ‘You\r\nare in my way,’ employed the delicate periphrasis of ‘I am in your\r\nway.’ He took the hint and moved, but this was not all. She touched\r\na cup and saucer on the mantelpiece, expecting him to remove it. He\r\ndid not perceive her meaning, whereupon she took the cup and saucer\r\nand handed it to him. Again when a friend was lolling in a chair with\r\nhis hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out, a French lady\r\nremarked to Mrs. Holcroft, ‘Look at that Englishman, he is anything but\r\nsqueamish.’ Yet Holcroft saw Frenchmen in similar attitudes, not to\r\nspeak of their spitting on the floor or pulling out white handkerchiefs\r\nbedaubed with snuff. The French were scandalised at the appearance at\r\nthe Tuileries of an officer in Highland costume; but Holcroft observed\r\nwomen in male attire in the streets and also at the theatres, where\r\nthey thus evaded the regulation excluding women from the pit. He saw\r\na married couple undistinguishable in point of dress, but he admits\r\nthat the woman showed timidity and the utmost propriety. On another\r\noccasion, however, he sat behind a girl in male dress who, manifestly\r\nto attract his notice, pretended to be making love to a female friend\r\nby her side. Little girls, moreover, were frequently dressed as boys,\r\nwhile boys had all sorts of outlandish costumes. Naughty children were\r\noften threatened with being sent back to their nurses on the ground\r\nthat they must be changelings, and putting children out to nurse was so\r\nuniversal that in eighteen months Holcroft, except among the poor, saw\r\nonly two infants in arms in the streets. He found French politeness in\r\nseveral respects wanting. Shopkeepers were the reverse of obsequious,\r\nand when his heels were trodden upon or his coat soiled by a cane or\r\numbrella carried under the arm he seldom received an apology. If,\r\nmoreover, at a theatre a neighbour borrowed his copy of the play it\r\nwould have been retained till the end of the performance if Holcroft\r\nhad not asked for it back.\r\n\r\nThere were marriages and deaths among the visitors. Lady Catherine\r\nBeauclerk, daughter of the Duke of St. Albans, was married at the\r\nEmbassy to the Rev. James Burgess, the Duchess of Cumberland being\r\npresent; she died nine months afterwards at Florence. The Baroness\r\nCrofton’s daughter was married to St. George Caulfeild of the county\r\nRoscommon, probably the ex-Guardsman and man of fashion who on\r\nthe 2nd February 1803 appeared at Covent Garden as Hamlet. He was\r\n‘well-proportioned and genteel,’ but too laboured in his attitudes and\r\ngesticulations. Richard Trench married Miss St. George. Lady Isabel\r\nStyle died at St. Omer in December 1802, Champion de Crespigny in Paris\r\non New Year’s Day, 1803, and Luttrell in the same month. Sir Robert\r\nChambers, ex-Chief Justice of Bengal, who had intended going south,\r\ndied in Paris in May 1803, and was buried in the Temple Church, London.\r\nMrs. Charles Ellis, granddaughter of the Earl of Bristol, Lady Mary\r\nEyre, relict of Thomas Eyre and sister of the Earl of Uxbridge, Lady\r\nAnne Saltmarsh, and Colonel Alexander Malcolm also died in Paris or the\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to the renewal of the war, I may mention some of\r\nthe return visits to London. These were sufficiently numerous for\r\nsheets of voting-papers on Napoleon’s life-consulate to be sent over\r\nto the French Embassy. Let us hope that one of these was not filled\r\nup by the most prominent visitor, Grégoire, Constitutional Bishop of\r\nBlois, who had sat in the Convention, but was happily absent in Savoy\r\nat the time of Louis XVI.’s trial. He was no doubt eagerly\r\nquestioned on the events of the Revolution and on the horrors from\r\nwhich he had rather unaccountably escaped. He plumed himself on being\r\nthe first Catholic prelate who since 1688 had promenaded in St. James’s\r\nPark in full costume, and he wittily remarked to Fulton, ‘The English\r\nare a magnanimous, hospitable, and kindly people, and the country\r\nwould be enchanting if it had but pleased God to give it sunshine and\r\nFrench cookery.’ Sir Joseph Banks showed him the sights of London.\r\nMadame Récamier was welcomed at London and Bath. She was noticed by\r\nthe Prince of Wales, and made or renewed acquaintance with the Duchess\r\nof Devonshire, Lady Elizabeth Foster, the Marquis of Douglas, his\r\nsister the Duchess of Somerset, the Duke of Orleans (afterwards Louis\r\nPhilippe), and his brothers. Her portrait was in great request, but she\r\nwas mobbed in Kensington Gardens on account of her transparent French\r\ncostume.[156] Her husband, the banker, joined her in London in May\r\n1802. Madame Vigée-Lebrun, who had painted Marie Antoinette, went in\r\nApril 1802 and stayed three years. The Prince of Wales and Lord Byron\r\nwere among her sitters. Madame Tussaud, an artist of another order,\r\nsettled permanently in London with her waxwork collections. Delille\r\nrecited his verses, but was addicted to eating jellies meanwhile, which\r\nwith his rapid pace made it difficult to understand him. He returned\r\nin August 1802, and had obtained or was about to obtain dispensation\r\nfrom deacon’s orders so as to marry his housekeeper. Garnerin,\r\nthe aeronaut, made a long stay, and ascending at Ranelagh Gardens\r\nalighted at Colchester. He made another ascent at Bath. Félissent, the\r\nworthless second husband of the great singer Mrs. Billington, had to\r\nher surprise followed her from Italy to London; but the Government,\r\ndoubtless out of friendliness to her, expelled him under the Alien\r\nAct. Was he anxious to share the 4000 guineas which she was earning\r\nthat season, or was he jealous, and not without cause, of the Duke of\r\nSussex? Talleyrand shamelessly gave his brother, Colonel Archambaud\r\n(afterwards Duc de Talleyrand), a letter to the Prime Minister,\r\nAddington, requesting him to procure the payment of a considerable sum\r\ndue to him while commanding a regiment of _émigrés_ in English\r\npay. Archambaud returned with the money, but the London newspapers\r\nrevealing his _incognito_ mission, Napoleon banished him from\r\nParis, as also another Bozon, who had likewise fought against France\r\nbut had since cringed to Napoleon. Fiévée, the press censor, was\r\nsent to write letters on or rather against England in the _Mercure\r\nde France_,[157] as also Colonel Beauvoisin, who on his return was\r\nordered by Napoleon to write against Pitt, Grenville, and the Court. He\r\nwas sent on a second visit with directions not only to write letters to\r\nhis paper (apparently the _Débats_), and to send all anti-French\r\npamphlets, but to ‘find pretexts for traversing the whole coast from\r\nthe Thames to beyond Plymouth, the Bristol Channel, Edinburgh and the\r\nScotch coasts.’ He was to ‘have a fixed salary, and extra pay whenever\r\nhe answers the expectations formed of his talents and fidelity.’[158]\r\nBeauvoisin, according to Goldsmith, was intimate with Despard, the\r\nconspirator. Bonnecarrère, Madame Bonneuil, who had previously had a\r\nmission to Russia, Madame Visconti, mistress of General Berthier, and\r\nMadame Gay, are also mentioned by Goldsmith as Napoleon’s emissaries.\r\nMilitary men were also appointed by him as consuls at London, Bristol,\r\nHull, Glasgow, Dublin, Cork, and Jersey; but a letter from Talleyrand\r\nto Fauvelet at Dublin, instructing him to make plans of Irish harbours,\r\nwas intercepted, whereupon the English Government insisted on the\r\nwithdrawal of these spies, a demand the more easily made by it as it\r\nhad not itself appointed any consuls to France. A more legitimate\r\nvisitor was Coquebert, a scientist and diplomatist who was deputed to\r\ndiscuss a commercial treaty, but failed to effect an agreement.\r\n\r\nSome of the visitors were of an undesirable class, for in September\r\n1803, when a royal proclamation ordered a general expulsion, the\r\n_Times_ said:--\r\n\r\n   ‘What did France send to us? With the exception of a few persons\r\n   who came on commercial speculations, she sent a multitude of\r\n   adventurers, who were starving at home and hastened hither,\r\n   impelled by the reports of our riches and the simplicity of our\r\n   character; and in return for the wealth which our nobility and\r\n   gentry carried over to their country, they came among us with no\r\n   other possessions than their vices.’\r\n\r\nShall we reckon among French visitors Maurice Drummond, a descendant\r\nof the Jacobite Drummonds, who took over with him his wife, daughter\r\nof Lord Elphinstone, and his daughter Clementina, destined as Lady\r\nClementina Davies to write _Recollections of Society_? She went at\r\nEdinburgh to a school kept by the sister of Professor Playfair, and her\r\nbrother was born in 1807 on British soil. The latter, in 1841, proved\r\nhis right to the French title of Duke of Melfort and Perth, while in\r\n1853 an Act of Parliament, reversing the attainder, restored to him his\r\nancestral British title of Earl of Perth and Melfort. He survived till\r\n1902, when, his son and grandson having predeceased him, the earldom\r\npassed to Viscount Strathallan.\r\n\r\nA less doubtful British immigrant was John Gamble, probably brother\r\nof the James Gamble who witnessed the Revolution. He had been in\r\npartnership as a paper-maker at Essonne with Jules Didot St. Léger,\r\nwho had married his sister Maria.[159] Accompanied by Nicolas Louis\r\nRobert, the Essonne overseer, inventor of a machine for endless\r\npaper-making, he started paper-mills in 1804 at Frogmore, Herts, but\r\nthese did not succeed. Didot himself, however, was more fortunate at\r\nTwo Waters, Hemel Hempstead, where he remained from 1802 till 1816.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\n                               CAPTIVITY\r\n\r\n   The Rupture--Detentions--Flights and Narrow\r\n   Escapes--Life at Verdun--Extortion--Napoleon’s\r\n   Rigour--M.P.’s--The _Argus_--Escapes and\r\n   Recaptures--Diplomatists--Liberations--Indulgences--Women and\r\n   Children--Captures in War--Rumbold--Foreign Visitors--British\r\n   Travellers--Deaths--The Last Stage--French Leave--Unpaid Debts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to discuss the causes of the renewal of the\r\nwar. M. Martin Phippson, in the _Revue Historique_, March\r\nto June 1901, contends that though England, owing to Addington’s\r\nincapacity, was seemingly the aggressor, Napoleon was really so,\r\nalbeit desirous at the last moment of postponing the rupture till\r\nhis armaments were completed. Of all the explanations of the rupture\r\nthe strangest, yet the most recent, is that of M. Albert Sorel, who,\r\nquoting some anonymous English writer, represents the renewal of the\r\nwar as necessary to the English ruling classes in order to avert the\r\nestablishment of a government like the French.[160] The truth is that\r\nall reflecting Englishmen perceived Napoleon to be a tyrant, and Paine,\r\nas we have seen, regarded Frenchmen as worse off than the slaves of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Amiens, moreover, had never been more than a truce.\r\nWhitworth had never appeared to instal himself for a permanency, and\r\nEnglish visitors consequently complained of his want of hospitality. On\r\nthe 13th March 1803 Napoleon rudely apostrophised him at Joséphine’s\r\nreception. Whitworth’s own account of this has been published by\r\nMr. Oscar Browning, but Napoleon’s version addressed to Andréossi,\r\nwhich seems to have been overlooked in England, is to be found in his\r\ncorrespondence. It reads thus:--\r\n\r\n   ‘The First Consul being at the presentation of foreigners\r\n   which took place to-day at Madame Bonaparte’s, and finding\r\n   Lord Whitworth and M. de Markoff side by side, said to them,\r\n   “We have been fighting fifteen years (_sic_). It seems\r\n   that a storm is brewing at London, and that they want to fight\r\n   another fifteen years. The King of England says in his message\r\n   that France is preparing offensive armaments. He has been\r\n   misled. There is no considerable armament in the French ports,\r\n   all having started for St. Domingo. He says that differences\r\n   exist between the two Cabinets; I know of none. It is true that\r\n   England should evacuate Malta. His Majesty is pledged to this by\r\n   treaty. The French nation may be destroyed but not intimidated.”\r\n\r\n   ‘Going round and finding himself alone with M. de Markoff, he\r\n   said in a low tone that the discussion related to Malta, that\r\n   the British Ministry wanted to keep it seven years, and that you\r\n   should not sign treaties when you would not execute them. At the\r\n   end of the circle, the English minister being near the door, he\r\n   said to him: “Madame Dorset has spent the bad season at Paris;\r\n   I ardently hope that she may spend the fine one; but if it is\r\n   true that we are to have war, the entire responsibility in the\r\n   eyes of God and man will be on those who repudiate their own\r\n   signature and refuse to execute treaties.”’\r\n\r\nThis storm blew over, and on the 30th March the young Duke of Dorset,\r\nthe Harrow schoolboy, set off to spend Easter with his mother, his\r\ntwo little sisters, and his step-father at Paris. It was also stated\r\nthat the Embassy was about to be newly furnished. But in April matters\r\nagain looked threatening. Madame de Rémusat tells us that people\r\ncollected outside the British Embassy, to judge by the preparations for\r\ndeparture whether there was to be peace or war. Whitworth[161] left\r\nParis on the 12th May and landed at Dover on the 20th. His staff met\r\nwith some obstacles. Talbot, on his way to Calais, was stopped at St.\r\nDenis because his passport had expired. He acknowledged that he ought\r\nto have renewed it, but the Prefect of Police, on being consulted,\r\nsaid he was exempt from the decree, and after a few hours’ delay\r\nTalbot, who admitted that he had been courteously treated, proceeded\r\non his journey.[162] Mandeville not being allowed, probably for the\r\nsame informality, to embark at Calais, returned temporarily to Paris.\r\nHodgson, the chaplain, and Maclaurin, the physician to the Embassy,\r\nalso encountered difficulties. On the 6th May it had been announced in\r\nthe House of Commons that Andréossi had asked for his passports. On\r\nthe 17th messages to both Houses and a notification in the _London\r\nGazette_ dated the 16th announced an embargo on all French and\r\nDutch vessels in British ports, together with the issue of letters of\r\nmarque. On the 19th two French vessels laden with timber and salt were\r\ncaptured off Brest. On the 23rd a decree was communicated to the French\r\nChambers providing that all Englishmen enrolled in the militia or\r\nholding commissions in the army or navy should be detained as reprisals\r\nfor this embargo and capture prior to the declaration of war on the\r\n18th. The decree was even extended by being made applicable to all\r\npersons between eighteen and sixty, even if, like clergymen and others,\r\nnot enrolled in the militia. Talbot before leaving wrote a letter of\r\nremonstrance to Talleyrand, who stated that Talbot having no longer any\r\nofficial status he could not reply.\r\n\r\nThe only precedents for this detention were the arrest in 1746, without\r\nany apparent reason, of all the English in Paris on the return of\r\nthe Young Pretender, and that of all Englishmen in France in 1793 as\r\nhostages for Toulon. Thomas Moore heard Lord Holland in 1819 justify\r\nNapoleon, but Mackintosh maintained that the seizure of vessels was\r\nwarranted by international law, and a French jurist, Miot de Mélito,\r\ndescribes the detention as a ‘violent measure unusual even in the\r\nbitterest wars,’ while Henri Martin, the French historian, charges both\r\nGovernments with having violated international law. The truth is that\r\nNapoleon acted in a passion, and as in the case of the Duc d’Enghien\r\nwas too proud ever to acknowledge a mistake. As to an embargo, he\r\nhimself as early as the 13th May had despatched orders for the seizure\r\nof British vessels in Holland, Genoa, and Tuscany. If, moreover, we\r\nare to believe Madame Junot, Napoleon’s decree was due to his having\r\nbeen informed that Colonel James Green had in a café threatened in\r\nhis cups to assassinate him, and though Junot, being acquainted with\r\nGreen, vouched for his having left Paris prior to the date of the\r\nalleged threat, Napoleon refused to cancel the decree. So swiftly was\r\nit enforced that the _Prince of Wales_ packet and the cutter\r\n_Nancy_, which had made their usual passage from Dover to Calais,\r\nwere seized and their crews detained. When a few weeks afterwards\r\nNapoleon visited Calais, Captain Sutton, of the _Prince of Wales_,\r\npetitioned him for release, but he met with a peremptory refusal, and\r\nNapoleon, on the two vessels being pointed out to him in the harbour,\r\nsaid, ‘You have plenty of mud there; let them lie and rot.’\r\n\r\nThe aggregate number of the British captives, represented by the French\r\nas seven thousand five hundred, was really only seven hundred, four\r\nhundred of them, according to Sturt, being small tradesmen. Napoleon,\r\naccording to Maclean, was much disappointed at the smallness of the\r\nhaul. Everything indeed had been done to induce the visitors to stay.\r\nThe _Argus_ had on the 10th May remonstrated against any fear\r\nof detention as in 1793, France, it said, being no longer under a\r\nRobespierre, and provincial authorities had given assurances that\r\nexpulsion with reasonable notice was the worst that could befall.\r\nIt was unfair, however, to accuse Napoleon of having ‘enticed’ the\r\nEnglish to remain. His assurances of safety were probably sincere at\r\nthe time, but his moral sense did not impress upon him the sacredness\r\nof such a virtual pledge. He had no scruples as to suddenly changing\r\nhis mind to the detriment of persons who had trusted him. Most of the\r\nvisitors, however, had deemed it prudent to return home while the\r\nissue was still uncertain. As late indeed as May arrivals in Paris had\r\ncontinued. From May 10th to 19th there were 48, and from the 20th to\r\nthe 29th there were 38, but in the next ten days the number fell to 17\r\nand in the following ten days to 6. Most of these visitors, moreover,\r\nmust have come up from the provinces on their way home, while others\r\ncame to fetch relatives. There were some narrow escapes. Sir William\r\nCall was just in time to leave Geneva, and Miss Berry and Mrs. Damer,\r\nwarned by Lord John Campbell, hurried away from that city, forgetting\r\nor possibly not thinking it safe to pass on the warning to others. The\r\nDuke of Bedford, the Duchess of Gordon and her daughter, and Sir Harry\r\nFeatherstonehaugh left Paris four days after Whitworth. The son of Sir\r\nG. Burrell and a companion escaped by making their valet pass for an\r\nAmerican and themselves for his servants. Young Edgeworth, on the other\r\nhand, received his father’s letter of warning just too late, and was\r\ndetained till 1814, though his companions, Roget as a Swiss and the\r\nPhilips boys as below the age, obtained exemption. Yet not only had\r\nmen been detained when over sixty, but some youths of ten or twelve,\r\nand therefore well under the limit of sixteen, had been stopped on the\r\nplea of their producing no certificates of birth. Augustine Sayer,\r\naged thirteen, whom his parents had apparently placed in a school,\r\nwas not allowed to return home, but was forced to maintain himself by\r\ntuition. He was eventually physician to the Duke of Kent and to the\r\nLock Hospital, dying in 1861. He may have been one of the English boys\r\nsent to Dubufe’s school, for Dubufe, a member of the London Society of\r\nArts, contradicting a statement that Protestants were refused admission\r\nto French schools, mentioned that he had received such pupils. John\r\nCharles Tarver, the future educationist and teacher of French at\r\nEton, might surely, however, have been sent to his parents in London\r\nbetween 1794 and 1802, even if this was impossible after 1803. Farel,\r\nthe engineer, in whose care he had been left by them on their release\r\nfrom captivity at Dieppe after the Terror, had virtually adopted him.\r\nBorn at Dieppe in 1790, he had practically been naturalised, and Farel\r\nin 1805 got him into the French civil service. He remained in it till\r\nMarch 1814, when, obtaining leave of absence, he went to London and\r\nfound his mother, brothers, and sisters still living; but he returned\r\nto France during the Hundred Days, intending apparently to resume his\r\nofficial post. Disappointed in this hope, he recrossed the Channel and\r\nfound a more distinguished career open to him.\r\n\r\nBefore entering into details respecting the captives, I should speak\r\nof the unusual bitterness given to the war by Napoleon. Anglophobia,\r\nindeed, had been displayed by him even during the peace. The publishers\r\nof the _Almanach National_ were sharply rebuked for proposing\r\nto insert ‘Angleterre’ with its royal family at the head of the\r\nalphabetical list of foreign powers. They had to relegate it lower down\r\nas ‘Grande Bretagne,’ and curiously enough British representatives at\r\ninternational Congresses are to the present day seated according to\r\nthis nomenclature. Napoleon, moreover, during his tour in Normandy\r\nscolded his minister Chaptal for speaking of ‘_jardins anglais_.’\r\n‘Why,’ he vehemently exclaimed, ‘do you call them English gardens? Do\r\nyou not know that this style of gardening came to us from China, that\r\nit was brought to perfection in France, and that no good Frenchman can\r\ncredit England with it? Bear in mind that “French gardens” is the only\r\nproper term for them, and never again grate on my ears with “English\r\ngardens.”’[163]\r\n\r\nHis animosity was naturally intensified on the resumption of\r\nhostilities. The theatres were forbidden to perform pieces containing\r\nallusions complimentary to England, while plays of an opposite\r\ncharacter were ordered to be performed not only in Paris but at\r\nBoulogne, Bruges, and other ports where troops were being collected for\r\nthe invasion. A corps of Irish interpreters was formed, and Chaptal was\r\ndirected to get some invasion songs written and set to music. Pamphlets\r\ndemonstrating the facility of the invasion or vilifying the English\r\nwere likewise published. One of them was entitled, ‘The English people,\r\nswollen with pride, beer, and tea, tried by the tribunal of reason.’\r\nThis was a reprint of Montlosier’s articles, but issued without his\r\nconsent. Caricatures were also multiplied. One of them represented\r\nGeorge III. as dragged on the ground by his hair by a French\r\nsoldier. His crown tumbles off, and the soldier, striking him with his\r\nfist, says, ‘Look to thy crown and defend thy coasts.’[164] The Bayeux\r\ntapestry was brought over to Paris to suggest the practicability or\r\nimminency of a landing in England, and the Joan of Arc celebration at\r\nOrleans, suspended since the Revolution, was revived. Even indeed in\r\nFebruary, three months before the rupture, Napoleon had emphatically\r\napproved, if not suggested, the erection by the Orleans municipality\r\nof a statue of the heroine. This gave the _Times_ a text for\r\ncommenting on the anomaly of the glorification by a usurper of the\r\nmaiden who restored the French crown to its rightful owner. Napoleon\r\nmight, however, have rejoined that he had not usurped the crown, but\r\nhad picked it out of the gutter of the Revolution. The teaching of\r\nEnglish in schools, too, as Lamartine testifies, was forbidden. Yet\r\nit is but fair to say that French was discouraged, as Lord Malmesbury\r\ntells us, in English schools, and that the _Times_ of January 4,\r\n1803, contained the following curious article:--\r\n\r\n   The political ill-consequences of the spread of the French\r\n   language throughout Europe are admitted; and we do not conceive\r\n   that its bad effects upon the morals and character of other\r\n   countries will be disputed. We have no hesitation to add, that\r\n   a nation which adopts the language of a superior is prepared to\r\n   admit its yoke. There is no better or quicker road to dominion,\r\n   than by imposing the necessity, or compassing the mode, of\r\n   making a language general. In this word are comprised the\r\n   ideas, character, and love of the people whose idiom you prefer\r\n   to your own.\r\n\r\n   We never heard it alleged as _unwise_ in the Government\r\n   of _China_, to intercept all communication between its\r\n   subjects and foreigners.\r\n\r\n   Except as a _first step_ and beginning of mischief, all\r\n   apprehensions from the representation of a French Comedy are\r\n   ridiculous. It is as the _mali labes_, the first spot\r\n   and eruption, that we are induced to contend against anything\r\n   so contemptible as the pic-nickery and nick-nackery--the pert\r\n   affectation, and subaltern vanity of rehearsing to an audience\r\n   that cannot understand, in a language one cannot pronounce!\r\n\r\n   Does any one advantage result to the community of Great Britain,\r\n   from the practice of teaching French indiscriminately to every\r\n   girl whose parents can send her to a boarding-school?\r\n\r\n   Does any advantage result from its being taught to shopkeepers’\r\n   sons, at a day-school, for fear foreigners should not pawn or\r\n   buy, for want of understanding them?\r\n\r\n   Are not the great part of the female sex, and of the uninformed\r\n   part of ours, exposed, by this practice, to the moral and\r\n   political corruptions of another country? Is not the business of\r\n   French Emissaries facilitated by the half-understanding of low\r\n   and ignorant Englishmen?\r\n\r\n   Ought a girl to be able to read any book that her father cannot?\r\n   Ought she to converse in a gibberish, which her mother cannot\r\n   detect?\r\n\r\n   Ought the mass of a virtuous and happy people to be educated to\r\n   form ideas different from the manners, habits, and institutions\r\n   of their own country? Ought it to be in the power of an enemy to\r\n   poison their minds, corrupt their principles, and seduce them\r\n   from their allegiance and religion?\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s letters show how jealously he watched over the detention of\r\nthe English, and over everything relating to England. Thus in 1806 he\r\nordered all Englishmen to be expelled from the Papal States, and this\r\norder perhaps accounts for Coleridge’s belief that he had a narrow\r\nescape from being seized on account of his articles in the _Morning\r\nPost_. It is extremely unlikely, however, that Napoleon ever heard\r\nof Coleridge. He likewise decreed that English civilians found in any\r\ncountry occupied by his troops should be prisoners, and all English\r\nproperty or merchandise confiscated. Even any neutral vessel which had\r\nentered an English port was also to be forfeited. Lord Oxford, Lord\r\nMount Cashell, and General Morgan would have been arrested at Florence\r\nbut for the refusal of the Queen Regent to act as Napoleon’s policeman.\r\nAgain in 1806 Napoleon writes, ‘I do not know why English prisoners\r\nhave been placed at Arras; no doubt to be near home so that they may\r\nescape.’ He writes eight months later from Posen: ‘Issue a circular\r\nand take measures that throughout the Empire all letters coming from\r\nEngland or written in English and by Englishmen shall be destroyed. All\r\nthis is very important, for England must be completely isolated.’ In\r\n1807 he complains that English prisoners still received letters. Two\r\nyears later, on a report that the English at Arras and Valenciennes\r\nwere meditating escape, he ordered their removal further inland. This\r\nmeasure was extended in 1811 to the prisoners at Brussels. The daily\r\npolice report, which constantly spoke of the English prisoners, was\r\nevidently scanned by him, even when absent from Paris, with great\r\nattention; and seemingly anxious that no other eye should see these\r\ndocuments, he directed that during his absence in Russia they should\r\nbe destroyed. There is consequently a gap of four months in 1812.\r\nEven to the last the prisoners were never forgotten by him, for on\r\nthe 6th January 1814 he ordered their removal from Verdun to Orleans,\r\nmanifestly to prevent their release by the allied armies. Only in one\r\ninstance do I find his severity relenting. On the 12th November 1812 at\r\nGivet he remarked English prisoners (captured soldiers or sailors, of\r\ncourse, not _détenus_) who had been set to repair a swivel bridge.\r\nEight or ten of them jumped with alacrity into a boat to help to make\r\nthe mechanism work. He directed that these men should be picked out,\r\npresented with 100 francs each, and sent back to England. An English\r\nclergyman at Givet who had petitioned for a three months’ visit home\r\nwas to escort them. A petition from another Englishman there was also\r\nto be favourably considered. It is pleasant to find Napoleon for once\r\ngood-humoured and generous.[165] When, in 1812, he directed that the\r\nsmuggling of coffee and sugar into Corsica by English vessels should\r\nbe winked at, and that sugar and coffee seized in British bottoms\r\nshould not, like British manufactured goods, be burnt, he was obviously\r\ninspired by more selfish considerations. French fishing-boats were\r\nforbidden to pass the night out at sea, lest they should smuggle\r\nEnglish goods, yet they were authorised to smuggle (the French had\r\nadopted the word _smogler_) spirits into England. Fishing-boats\r\non both sides were unmolested, unless indeed they had clandestine\r\npassengers on board; and the _Times_, running a light cutter in\r\nthe Channel, procured from them Paris newspapers. Letters were probably\r\nconveyed occasionally in the same way. England had not retaliated\r\nagainst French products, for in 1807 the _Monthly Review_ appealed\r\nto British patriots not to continue spending a million and a half a\r\nyear on French brandies and other goods. But Cancale must have been\r\nunable to continue sending its oysters, one hundred and nineteen\r\nmillions of which had been forwarded in the twenty months of peace. The\r\nexport of oysters from Granville and St. Malo was, however, permitted\r\nby Napoleon in 1810.\r\n\r\nThe Irish refugees, whom Napoleon, as we have seen, had offered\r\nCornwallis to expel, now became his cats-paws. In July 1803, while\r\ndeclining to see Arthur O’Connor, he deputed General Truguet to treat\r\nwith him and Berthier to advance him small sums of money. He promised\r\nto send 25,000 troops to Ireland, and if 20,000 Irishmen would join\r\nthem he pledged himself to make Irish independence a condition of\r\npeace. But he found that the Irish refugees or emissaries were split\r\ninto two parties, not always on speaking terms, O’Connor accepting,\r\nthe Emmets rejecting, the idea of a French protectorate. In July 1804,\r\nhaving read a memoir by the Emmets, Lewins, and other exiles, he\r\ndecreed that all Irishmen accompanying the projected expedition should\r\nbe considered Frenchmen, and if not treated when captured as prisoners\r\nof war reprisals would be exercised.[166] Robert Emmet had had an\r\naudience of Napoleon previously to the peace, and an Irish legion was\r\nformed in November 1803. MacSheehy organised it at Brest, and on the\r\nEmperor’s coronation it was presented, like the French regiments, with\r\nan eagle and colours. Irish dissensions, however, are proverbial, and a\r\nduel between MacSheehy and O’Mealy led to the former being transferred\r\nto a French regiment and to the latter resigning and apparently\r\nreturning to Baltimore. In 1806 the legion was ordered to Landau and\r\nhad to pass through Verdun.\r\n\r\n   The governor [says Myles Byrne] took upon himself to lodge\r\n   the Irish legion in a suburb, lest its presence might not be\r\n   agreeable to the British prisoners. At daybreak he had the\r\n   drawbridge let down and the gates opened to let the legion march\r\n   through before the English prisoners could have light to see\r\n   and contemplate our green flag and its beatific inscription, so\r\n   obnoxious to them, ‘the independence of Ireland.’ Our march,\r\n   however, through the town at that early hour attracted great\r\n   notice. As our band played up our national air of Patrick’s Day\r\n   in the Morning we could see many windows opened and gentlemen in\r\n   their shirts inquiring across the street in good English what\r\n   was meant by this music at such an early hour.\r\n\r\nSome months later the legion was ordered to Boulogne, to be ready for\r\nthe invasion of England, and at Arras ‘the governor,’ says Byrne, ‘had\r\nthe good sense to make the English sleep one night in the citadel\r\nuntil we marched out in the morning.’ The legion was eventually sent\r\nto Spain. The experiment of inviting English prisoners to join it\r\ndid not succeed, and in 1810 Napoleon stopped it. ‘I do not want any\r\nEnglish soldiers,’ he wrote; ‘I prefer their being prisoners to answer\r\nfor my prisoners in England; moreover the majority desert.’ This had\r\napparently happened in Spain. In 1811 Napoleon directed Clarke to\r\nsend for O’Connor and his fellow-exiles in Paris and try to revive\r\nan insurrection. He was ready to send 30,000 troops if sure of a\r\nrising and if England continued to send forces to Portugal. O’Connor\r\naccordingly sent Napoleon a preliminary memoir, whereupon in September\r\nhe commissioned Clarke to despatch agents to Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his ostentatious preparations Napoleon told Metternich in\r\n1810 that he had never been mad enough to think of invading England\r\nunless in the wake of an insurrection, the Boulogne army being all\r\nalong aimed at Austria. The latest and fullest French writer on the\r\nsubject, Colonel Desbrières, from an examination of the confused orders\r\nand counterorders, so unlike the rest of Napoleon’s plans, comes to\r\nthe same conclusion.[167] All that Napoleon could have intended was\r\nto disquiet England, and thus prevent her from despatching troops to\r\nthe Continent. This was legitimate strategy, and he was obviously,\r\nmoreover, as much entitled to use the Irish as pawns as England had\r\nbeen to use the Vendeans, but his manufacture of counterfeit notes is\r\nless excusable. A manufactory of forged notes in Paris, enshrouded\r\nin mystery, was superintended by Lale, a clerk in the engraving\r\ndepartment of the War Office, Fouché, Savary, and Desmarest being the\r\nonly confidants of the secret. A Hamburg Jew named Malchus and two\r\nFrenchmen, Blanc and Bernard, were sent to buy merchandise with the\r\nnotes. They were instructed to go to Scotland and Ireland, so as to\r\ndisappear before the fraud was discovered. They were ostensibly told\r\nto destroy what they bought, but they naturally preferred smuggling it\r\ninto France, and this was winked at, so that they made large profits.\r\nThe fraud was, however, soon discovered. Malchus was hanged. His\r\nconfederates escaped in an English smuggling boat which was captured by\r\na French revenue vessel. They were at first imprisoned at Boulogne, but\r\nSavary promptly ordered their release, together with funds to return\r\nto Paris for further employment. Napoleon, at a later date, practised\r\nthe same trick on Russia and Austria. On the restoration of peace with\r\nthe latter in 1810, he offered an excuse or rather defence of the act\r\nto Metternich. He had at that time just ordered Fouché to resume the\r\nforgery of English notes.[168]\r\n\r\nNapoleon, it may be remarked, attributed the rupture of 1803 to his\r\nrefusal to conclude a commercial treaty ‘which would necessarily\r\nhave been detrimental to the manufactures and industry of his\r\nsubjects,’[169] and he never relaxed stringency in excluding British\r\nmerchandise. As late as 1810 such goods were seized and burned at\r\nRoscoff, Bâle, and Strasburg, though the prefect of Strasburg suggested\r\nthat textiles should be utilised in hospitals and ambulances. The war\r\nthus gave a stimulus to French manufactures, except to those hampered\r\nby want of raw materials. The ports, however, suffered severely through\r\nthe English blockade, especially Nantes and other towns which had had\r\na large trade with the West Indies. During the short peace Nantes had\r\nsent out merchantmen, and sixty of these, unable to get back, were\r\ncaptured. Marseilles also suffered, but the blockade could not entirely\r\nstop its trade.\r\n\r\nEven some Englishmen long resident in France were declared prisoners\r\nand had to plead for exemption. Chalmers, a Bordeaux merchant, Scottish\r\non the father’s side, French on the mother’s; James Macculloch, who had\r\nbeen in Brittany for thirty-five years; James Smith, Stone’s successor\r\nas printer; and James Milne, who taught cotton-spinning at the Arts\r\net Métiers, were in this position. Chalmers found naturalisation\r\nthe only resource. Smith and Milne, perhaps also Macculloch, were\r\nstruck off the list of captives. As a rule rich residents as well\r\nas manufacturers and artisans were unmolested, for Napoleon was not\r\ninsensible of the advantage thus accruing to Parisian tradesmen. Thus\r\nFrancis Henry Egerton, brother and eventual successor of the Earl of\r\nBridgewater, an eccentric clergyman or ex-clergyman of whom we shall\r\nhear anon, was not disquieted. According to a French writer he had\r\ncreated a scandal which necessitated expatriation, but this assertion\r\nI have not been able to verify. His chess parties in 1807 excited much\r\nnotice. In 1813 he visited Italy. Quintin Craufurd was also unmolested,\r\nalong with his _quasi_-wife Mrs. Sullivan, who, according to\r\na French police register, was originally an Italian ballet-dancer,\r\nmarried John O’Sullivan, Under-Secretary for War and the Colonies,\r\nand eloped with Craufurd. Another version, however, states that she\r\nhad been the mistress or morganatic wife of the King of Würtemberg,\r\non whose legitimate marriage she withdrew with her daughter to Paris,\r\nsubsequently marrying Sullivan. What is certain is that she had\r\ncohabited with Craufurd in Paris as long ago as 1787, for in that year\r\nshe had had to fetch him home at 9 A.M. from the British\r\nEmbassy after a whole night at the card-table. Nothing worse now befell\r\nCraufurd than a robbery. Madame de Genlis writes on the 23rd March 1811\r\nto her adopted son, Casimir Becker:--\r\n\r\n   That poor Mr. Craufurd was robbed yesterday while he was playing\r\n   whist at Madame de Talleyrand’s. All his superb jewels, caskets,\r\n   rings, gold medals, 300 louis d’or, etc. The window was opened\r\n   by means of a hole cut in the shutter, and the desk was forced.\r\n   But it is believed from several indications that what was done\r\n   to the window was merely a feint and that the thief belonged to\r\n   the house.[170]\r\n\r\nEven Craufurd, however, being uncle, as we have seen, of two British\r\ndiplomatists, incurred the suspicions of Fouché’s spies, for their\r\nreport of the 22nd May 1804 says:--\r\n\r\n   It may be supposed that this old man, now _blasé_, has\r\n   no longer the activity which formerly rendered his house at\r\n   Frankfort a centre of political movements very hostile to\r\n   France, but he is still under the influence of Madame Sullivan,\r\n   that foreigner of easy virtue who facilitated the departure of\r\n   Louis XVI. and started the same day for Brussels.[171]\r\n\r\nTalleyrand’s protection nevertheless ensured him against molestation,\r\nand he was even permitted to procure books from England. In 1816 he\r\nobtained the restitution of his papers,[172] seized, like his other\r\neffects, in 1793, and he claimed 2,230,000 francs compensation for his\r\nlosses. A smaller sum was probably awarded him. He continued living\r\nin Paris till his death in November 1819. A painful episode disturbed\r\nhis last months. Sir James Craufurd went over, and as far as can be\r\njudged endeavoured to extort from the sick uncle a will or a bequest of\r\n£48,000 in his favour. Though forbidden entrance, he flourished pistols\r\nin the faces of two servants and forced his way in. He next prosecuted\r\nMrs. Craufurd and several of her fashionable friends for spreading\r\nreports of his conduct, and in court he indulged in such personalities\r\nthat he had to be expelled. He also charged the servants with\r\nassaulting him, but this, like the other accusations, was dismissed,\r\nand he was eventually twice sentenced by default to six months’\r\nimprisonment for libellous pamphlets, in one of which he accused Mrs\r\nCraufurd of bigamy.[173] Quintin Craufurd was very charitable to the\r\npoor of Paris. Though primarily a man of fashion, he ranks as an author\r\nby works on India, Mary Stuart, and Marie Antoinette, some of them in\r\nFrench. His widow, retaining to the age of eighty-four her vivacity\r\nand charm, died in Paris about 1832. Her daughter[174] married Count\r\nAlbert d’Orsay, one of Napoleon’s generals, and thus became the mother\r\nof Count Alfred d’Orsay, the handsome fop, spendthrift, and amateur\r\npainter, who in 1827 married Lady Harriet Gardner, step-daughter of the\r\nfamous Lady Blessington. Sir James (latterly Sir James Grogan) Craufurd\r\ndied in 1839.\r\n\r\nFraser Frisell, who, except for a brief visit to his native Scotland in\r\n1802, had lived in France since 1792, was likewise allowed full liberty.\r\n\r\nAmericans, it may be mentioned, were liable to be arrested as English,\r\nfor the latter sometimes attempted to pass themselves off as Americans.\r\nGeorge Matthew Paterson, a cousin of Madame Paterson-Bonaparte’s\r\nfather, was detained as a British subject. He had, indeed, been born\r\nin Ireland. He was sent to Valenciennes, and then to Lille, whence\r\nhe wrote letters to Madame Paterson-Bonaparte complimenting her on\r\nher marriage with Jerome and desiring to make her acquaintance.[175]\r\nWilliam Russell was at least half American. He had got up the Bastille\r\ndinner at Birmingham in 1790, whereupon his house was burnt down by\r\nthe mob. He had gone to America in 1795, but in 1802, being in France\r\non his way to England, he was detained till 1814.\r\n\r\nJunot, who as Governor of Paris had to carry out the order of\r\ndetention, was, according to his wife’s memoirs, very reluctant to do\r\nso, and consented only under great pressure. He seems, indeed, by all\r\naccounts to have been inclined to leniency, and Forbes tells us that he\r\nsuggested his obtaining exemption by pretending to be a sexagenarian.\r\nFor a time some captives were allowed to remain in Paris, but this did\r\nnot last long. Napoleon, in this as in other cases, interested himself\r\nin the smallest details. On the 3rd July he ordered a hundred of the\r\nEnglish in Paris to be sent off. They were allowed to choose between\r\nMelun, Meaux, Fontainebleau, Nancy, and Geneva, only twenty-five,\r\nmostly Irishmen, being permitted to remain in Paris. He complained too\r\nof having found English at Boulogne and Calais. Accordingly forty-eight\r\nhours’ notice was given them--that is to those not of the age to be\r\nprisoners--to embark for England or to remove into the interior. On\r\nthe 7th July Napoleon gave orders that the English officers should be\r\nsent to Fontainebleau or some other town: only forty were to remain in\r\nParis; ‘the presence of so great a number of English in Paris cannot\r\nbut cause and does cause great mischief.’[176] On the 23rd November he\r\nordered that officers, old men, and men with wives and children should\r\nbe interned at Verdun. The prisoners at Fontainebleau, Phalsbourg,\r\nand Marsal were accordingly transferred thither. Persons giving cause\r\nof complaint were to be confined at Bitche,[177] Sedan, or Sarrelouis,\r\nwhile privates and sailors were to be imprisoned at Charlemont and\r\nValenciennes.\r\n\r\nVerdun was obviously chosen because its distance from the sea rendered\r\nescape difficult. It was a town of ten thousand inhabitants, and the\r\ninflux of English, mostly in affluent or at least easy circumstances,\r\nwas a windfall for it. A French newspaper compared them in fact to\r\nsheep enclosed in a fold to manure the soil, and it suggested that\r\nother towns should share the advantage. The mayor of Metz, indeed,\r\napplied on behalf of that city, but ineffectually. Verdun retained a\r\nkind of monopoly, a regulated monopoly, for Napoleon in one of his\r\nletters (Nov. 24, 1804) warned the municipality that unless it kept\r\ndown the price of lodgings, which had risen from 36 to 300 francs\r\na month, the English would be sent elsewhere. Some of the army or\r\nnavy officers and captains of merchantmen captured during the war\r\nwere, of course, without means, and they had the option of gratuitous\r\naccommodation in the barracks. Another reason for the choice of Verdun\r\nmay have been the absence of any upper class with whom the captives\r\ncould mix, whereas at Nancy, the former capital of Lorraine and still\r\na kind of provincial Paris, they had much more congenial surroundings.\r\nAustrian and Russian prisoners there joined them in 1804 in celebrating\r\nCarnival. The number of captives at Verdun from 1803 to 1814 varied\r\nfrom six to eleven hundred, but the highest number included captives\r\nmade at sea or on battlefields. They procured remittances from England\r\nthrough Perregaux, the Paris banker, and some obtained permission for\r\ntheir families to join them. They had to give their parole not to\r\nescape as a condition of being allowed to hire their own lodgings, a\r\nbreach of parole entailing incarceration. They had to answer to the\r\nroll-call morning and night. They beguiled their captivity as best they\r\ncould. There were amateur theatricals, cock-fights, and horse-races.\r\nThe prisoners were described by the _Argus_ in January 1804 as\r\n‘playing, dancing, singing, and drinking all day long.’\r\n\r\nTwo clubs were formed, one English at Concannon’s house,[178] the other\r\nIrish at Carron’s, but the latter was broken up on account of Hibernian\r\nquarrels in 1807. Lady Cadogan gave entertainments, and on the Prince\r\nof Wales’s birthday in 1804 Mrs. Concannon issued a hundred and twenty\r\ninvitations to a ball and supper, when the costly toilettes of Mrs.\r\nClive, wife of Colonel Robert Clive, and those of Mrs. Annesley, were\r\nmuch remarked. In 1807 the townspeople were invited by four captives to\r\na masquerade ball.[179]\r\n\r\n‘Young Englishmen,’ wrote George Call in his diary, after passing\r\nthrough Verdun in 1810, ‘are much the same whether prisoners or\r\nat home, playing, driving, and shooting each other (_sic_)\r\n... One might fancy oneself in London.’ The richer prisoners gave\r\nmonthly subscriptions for their poorer brethren or for schools, and\r\nthe Birmingham Quakers in 1807 opened a subscription for them, an\r\nexample followed in 1811 by London. The English Government, moreover,\r\nat the instance of Robson, sent £2000. Dr. Davis gave gratuitous\r\nmedical services to the poorer prisoners. Maude and Jordan held\r\nChurch of England services in the college hall, and solemnised\r\nmarriages the validity of which was afterwards disputed. When fellow\r\nof Queen’s College, where he died in 1852, Maude used to relate his\r\nexperiences.[180] Captivity reveals character, and there was not\r\nunbroken harmony or unalloyed respectability. Some speedily got into\r\ndebt, and the authorities had to consider whether imprisonment for\r\ndebt could be resorted to. This seems to have been at first settled\r\nin the negative. Lord Barrington, in June 1804, gave a Frenchman a\r\ndraft on London which was dishonoured. The holder thereupon sued him\r\nand obtained judgment, but on appeal this was reversed, on the ground\r\nthat being detained Barrington could not have arranged for an extension\r\nof time. Ultimately, however, we find arrests for debt made, and in\r\n1807 Napoleon ordered that such judgments should be enforced. Waring\r\nKnox was in a debtors’ prison at Saargemünd when, on the intercession\r\nof the Grand Duke of Berg, he received permission to live at Melun,\r\nprovided his creditors agreed to his exit. While in prison for debt\r\nat Valenciennes in 1811, he asked for 200 louis and a passport that\r\nhe might go to England, where, having been brought up with the Prince\r\nRegent, he could procure a confidential post and could discover and\r\nreveal the secret projects of the British Government. General Clarke,\r\nwhose Irish extraction and knowledge of England, where he had found\r\nhis first wife,[181] made him a good judge of such applications,\r\nbelieved, however, that he simply wanted to escape from his numerous\r\nFrench creditors. Whether the offer was sincere or not it was almost\r\nequally contemptible. Yet we ultimately hear of his giving his poorer\r\ncountrymen a daily meal at Valenciennes, where he died in a debtors’\r\nprison in December 1813, just before release would have come. It is\r\nsignificantly stated that Sir William Cooper and Lady Cadogan, on\r\nbeing allowed to quit Verdun for Nancy, left no debts behind them,\r\nwhereas half a dozen others had left half a million francs unpaid.\r\nPolice reports of 1804–1805 mention one Wilson as behaving indecently\r\nwith his French mistress at the theatre, and striking the officer\r\nwho reprimanded him. He was deservedly sent to Bitche. Wilbraham was\r\ncharged with forgery and with swindling his fellow-countrymen. We hear,\r\ntoo, of a duel between ‘Gold’ (Valentine Goold, or Francis Goold, a\r\nsurgeon?) and Balbi, the keeper of the gaming-tables, in which the\r\nlatter was wounded. ‘Gold’ was consequently confined in the fortress,\r\nbut Napoleon (this proves that he looked into everything) ordered his\r\nliberation. ‘A prisoner of war,’ he said, ‘may fight a duel.’ One of\r\nthe brothers Mellish, interned at Orleans, actually challenged the\r\nprefect to an encounter. A duel in 1806 between Captain Walpole and\r\nLieutenant Miles, both of the navy, in which the latter was killed,\r\nprobably arose out of a gaming quarrel. In the gaming-room figured the\r\nnotice, ‘This bank is kept for the English; the French are forbidden to\r\nplay at it.’[182]\r\n\r\nThe gaming-tables, Lord Blayney was told, cost the English prisoners\r\n£50,000 a year, but they were eventually closed. A Captain Cory, in\r\none of his drunken fits, assaulted a French soldier. Colonel William\r\nWhaley, probably the brother of ‘Jerusalem’ Whaley, who indulged in\r\nquarrelling, duelling, and betting, was in 1808 sent to Moulins. He is\r\ndescribed as ‘notorious for immorality and extravagant conduct, and\r\ncapable of the most desperate enterprises.’ The English Government had\r\nrefused him a passport for France, but he had managed to get there,\r\nand after six months’ incarceration in the Temple at Paris, where he\r\nexcited a mutiny among the prisoners, had been sent to Verdun. There\r\nin 1811, to revenge himself for a refusal to receive him, he denounced\r\nBlayney as having clandestinely procured plans of French fortresses.\r\nThe charge was investigated and declared unfounded. There were other\r\nmen base enough falsely to denounce fellow-captives. Morshead and\r\nEstwicke in 1808 were fined 20,000 francs for calumny and swindling.\r\nSir Thomas Wallace was denounced out of revenge by MacCarthy as being\r\ndeep in debt and meditating escape or suicide.[183] In August 1813\r\nthere was a scuffle between prisoners and townsmen, which gendarmes\r\nhad to repress. Hutchinson, a teacher of languages, was sent to Bitche\r\nfor insulting a French officer. A Captain Hawker and a man named\r\nRaineford, who entered a jeweller’s shop on pretence of paying a bill,\r\nand seriously assaulted him, were sentenced in 1808 to twelve and six\r\nmonths’ imprisonment respectively. ‘Restless spirits,’ says Call, ‘do\r\ntheir best to compel the French to treat the prisoners harshly.’\r\n\r\nSome captives, indeed, brought punishments on themselves. Thomas\r\nDevenish, having inveighed against Napoleon, was sent to Doullens\r\nfortress, but after a time was allowed to return, and Brodie, who\r\nhad taught English at Blois, audaciously sent General Wirion, the\r\ncommandant at Verdun, a letter of diatribes against Napoleon, for which\r\nhe was relegated to Bitche. A surgeon named Simpson, who at the theatre\r\nhissed a bust of Napoleon and next day boasted of the act, pleaded\r\ninebriation, but was consigned to the fortress. On the other hand\r\nNeilson, captain of a merchantman, obviously tried to curry favour by\r\nnaming his infant Napoleon, and Felix Ellice, a prisoner at Thionville,\r\ncomposed four sonnets and an ode on the birth of the King of Rome.\r\nWilliams, imprisoned at Bitche, who had been employed by the Admiralty\r\ntill 1799, but had apparently been dismissed, offered in 1804 and again\r\nin 1808 to detect the spies acting for England, but his overtures were\r\nrefused, it being believed that the spies had been changed. Two navy\r\nlieutenants were imprisoned for fourteen days in 1805 for striking a\r\nFrench officer. A Captain Bannatyne and two officers got up theatricals\r\non the plea of intending to pay debts, but in reality, it was said, to\r\nswindle their countrymen. Captain Nanney was sent to Arras for seducing\r\na townsman’s wife, but escaped in August 1809. Gentlemen’s servants\r\nare not always of exemplary behaviour, and we hear of ten valets being\r\npacked off from Verdun.\r\n\r\nThese black sheep were of course exceptions, and we hear on the\r\nother hand of Colonel Reilly Cope indulging in botanising, of Forbes\r\nhaving his daughter taught to dance, and of Captain Molyneux Shuldham\r\nconstructing a carriage propelled by sails at seven or eight miles an\r\nhour. Horses, however, being frightened by this monster, and a cart\r\nbeing overturned by it, it was hissed and stoned by the peasantry.\r\nShuldham also invented a boat which, placed on a kind of skates, slid\r\nover the ice.[184] He and others likewise amused themselves with\r\nrowing, but anglers complained that they frightened away the fish, and\r\nthe pastime was consequently forbidden.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wirion, the commandant of Verdun, had clearly no enviable\r\nposition. Not only had he to keep the captives in order and prevent\r\nescapes, but he had to deal with a swarm of French adventurers of\r\nboth sexes who sought to make money by facilitating escapes. It was\r\naccordingly ordered in July 1805 that all suspicious women should be\r\nexpelled, and that no passports should be allowed to Verdun unless\r\ngood reasons were shown. Frenchmen, like foreigners, could not then\r\ngo freely from one town to another.[185] Women who had caused quarrels\r\namong the captives were expelled, but some of them then settled in the\r\nneighbouring villages. An honourable commandant would have found his\r\npost unpleasant and irksome, and Wirion, the son of a pork butcher, was\r\nnot even an honourable man. He recognised Lord Barrington’s mistress,\r\nMadame St. Amand, who was at first passed off as his wife, by calling\r\non her, and he took money for winking at illicit amours. He is said\r\nto have recommended housekeepers or mistresses who were his spies,\r\nand in one case an Englishman who had foolishly told his mistress his\r\nplans of escape was betrayed by her. Wirion may have thought this a\r\nlegitimate stratagem, but he likewise unblushingly levied blackmail,\r\nand his subordinates followed suit. He would invite himself or be\r\ninvited to dinner with the wealthier captives, and they would allow him\r\nto win from them at cards, in order to obtain small favours or to avoid\r\nbeing sent to Bitche, to which they were liable at his mere caprice.\r\nHe inflicted a fine of 3 francs on men failing to present themselves\r\nat the roll-call morning and night, but not finding many able to pay\r\n6 francs a day for late rising and an evening promenade he commuted\r\nthis for 6 francs or 12 francs a month. In the winter of 1804, however,\r\nhe made one roll-call a day suffice, and allowed exceptionally good\r\nprisoners to appear only every fifth day.[186] He received, according\r\nto Sturt, 600 francs or 1000 francs a month from the gaming-tables as\r\nthe price of his protection, and he is said to have extorted no less\r\nthan 136,000 francs from a prisoner named Garland.\r\n\r\nWirion’s gendarmes got up lotteries for articles which sometimes\r\ndid not exist, and prisoners had to take tickets as the price of\r\nsmall favours. Complaints of his extortion were unavailing until the\r\nappointment as Minister of War of General Clarke. Wirion was thereupon\r\nsummoned to Paris in 1810, and rather than face a court-martial he shot\r\nhimself in the Bois de Boulogne. No French newspaper, indeed, records\r\nthis, and though affirmed by Lord Blayney, who arrived at Verdun\r\nshortly afterwards, I should have felt doubts of its accuracy but for\r\nfinding a passage in _Letters from the Cape_, a pamphlet dictated\r\nby Napoleon at St. Helena in 1817. It says:--\r\n\r\n   The English prisoners detained at Verdun were treated with great\r\n   attention (_sic_), and a French officer who commanded\r\n   that depôt having been guilty of some extortions upon them,\r\n   an inquiry was in consequence ordered by the Emperor, and the\r\n   culprit was so much afraid of his anger that he committed\r\n   suicide.\r\n\r\nI have, moreover, discovered in the police bulletin of April 8, 1810,\r\nthe following record:--\r\n\r\n   General Wirion went yesterday morning at ten o’clock in a\r\n   hackney coach to the Bois de Boulogne. Alighting a few steps\r\n   from the Porte Maillot, he blew out his brains. Upon him was\r\n   found a letter to his wife and another to the doctor, asking him\r\n   to attend to her in these sad circumstances. It appears that\r\n   impatience at the apparent tardiness of the commission deputed\r\n   to investigate the complaints against him was the reason of the\r\n   suicide.[187]\r\n\r\nWirion’s chief subordinate and successor, Colonel Courselles, though\r\nfar from immaculate, was more cautious and moderate in his extortions.\r\nHe confined himself to a monopoly of the wine supply, charging\r\nexorbitant rates, and to paying the allowance to the poorer prisoners\r\nin _livres tournois_ in lieu of francs, thus clearing a profit.\r\nCourselles, in his turn, was called to account, but he threw the blame\r\non his subordinates, one of whom, Lieutenant Massin, shot himself\r\nthrough apprehension of a court-martial. He had simply by Courselles’\r\norders destroyed incriminating documents, but thus thrown over by his\r\nchief he left a note stating that though innocent he could not face\r\nthreatened dishonour. It is satisfactory to learn that Courselles was\r\nlikewise removed, that his successor was so upright a man that on his\r\ndeath in 1813 all the English attended the funeral, and that the next\r\ncommandant was still more indulgent, allowing captives to live not\r\nmerely in the outskirts of Verdun but in neighbouring towns.\r\n\r\nThe captives were popular at Verdun. Some of the inhabitants were\r\nsuspected of allowing letters under cover to be directed to them in\r\norder to evade their being opened and read. It is true that a boy five\r\nyears old, on being jocularly asked by Eyre whether he would go with\r\nhim to England, replied, ‘No, all Englishmen are bad’; but when in\r\n1805 a hundred and seventy of them were transferred to Valenciennes,\r\nGivet, and Sarrelouis, two hundred inhabitants collected to see them\r\noff. Women shook hands, even gave kisses, and exclaimed, ‘Poor young\r\nfellows!’ a proof, says Wirion, that the prisoners had gained great\r\ninfluence and that their removal was urgent.[188]\r\n\r\nThree M.P.’s being among the captives, it will naturally be asked\r\nwhether they retained their seats. They could not or did not resign,\r\nbut in those days a constituency did not suffer much from going without\r\na representative. The next general election did not take place till\r\n1806. Lord Yarmouth was then re-elected for the Irish pocket borough of\r\nLisburn, and continued--we can hardly say to sit--for it. In 1822 he\r\nwas called to the Upper House. Lord Lovaine, in like manner, remained\r\nmember for Beeralston, Devonshire. He was even nominated in 1804 a\r\nLord of the Treasury, and in 1807 an India Commissioner. Thomas Brooke\r\nwas likewise again re-elected for Newton in 1806, but he, as we shall\r\nsee, had escaped from Valenciennes. Green, who is described in the\r\npolice register as a man of letters, and Sturt were not re-elected.\r\nTufton, who with his brother Charles was detained at Fontainebleau, and\r\nThompson, who at Orleans inveighed against Napoleon, had ceased to be\r\nM.P.’s.\r\n\r\nOne of the privations of detention was not merely the censorship\r\nexercised over correspondence but the total deprivation of English\r\nnewspapers. Even before the rupture, indeed, only one paltry Sunday\r\npaper in the pay of Napoleon[189] was allowed to pass through the\r\npost-office, though the Embassy of course could be subject to no\r\nsuch restriction, and other journals could be clandestinely perused.\r\nNapoleon in August 1802 rebuked Talleyrand for allowing English\r\nnewspapers to reach ‘a large number of persons’ by being addressed\r\nunder cover to the Foreign Office,[190] and Galignani’s newly opened\r\nreading-room must have undergone unforeseen restrictions. When the\r\nwar broke out Napoleon repeated his order that reading-rooms should\r\nbe allowed only one particular English paper, which was supplied\r\nthem gratuitously. Madame de Rémusat says he had, however, largely\r\nsubsidised English journalists and writers, apparently to little\r\npurpose, but this may be considered an exaggeration. Galignani’s\r\n_Monthly Repertory of English Literature_, started in 1807, did\r\nnot compensate for the absence of newspapers. Even the _Morning\r\nPost_, though siding with France, was not admitted.\r\n\r\nAs long as the _Argus_ lasted the captives were fain to subscribe\r\nto it, for ‘infamous’ as Forbes styles it, it gave copious extracts\r\nfrom the London press, but in 1810 Napoleon suppressed it, and the\r\nprisoners became dependent on the meagre and carefully manipulated\r\nintelligence of the Paris papers. In 1804–1805 several prisoners had\r\nsent the _Argus_ letters and verses in favour of peace, hoping\r\nthus, perhaps, to procure release.\r\n\r\nFor a time the captives were buoyed up by the expectation of being\r\nexchanged for French soldiers and sailors, the balance of numbers\r\nbeing always largely against France; but the British Government\r\nrefused to exchange combatants for civilians, as this would have\r\nbeen a recognition of the validity of the detention. In the autumn\r\nof 1805 the prisoners petitioned the Electress (afterwards Queen) of\r\nWürtemberg, Princess Royal of England, to intercede for them, but she\r\ndid not venture to comply, sending word that the matter was one for the\r\ntwo Governments.[191] There was again a gleam of hope in 1806, when,\r\nas we shall presently see, Lord Yarmouth went to Paris to negotiate,\r\nbut the sky was soon overcast. The temptation to escape became stronger\r\nas time elapsed and as it became clear that the fall of Napoleon\r\nwould alone bring liberation. Some broke their parole. Others thought\r\nthey satisfied honour by sending word just before starting that they\r\nwithdrew their parole. Sir James Craufurd, who had been allowed to go\r\nfor two months to Aix-la-Chapelle to take the waters, did not return,\r\nbut got round to England by Sweden, justifying himself on the ground\r\nthat his wife was ill and that a lucrative post had been given to\r\nanother man in his absence. The police bulletin scouted his alleged\r\nanxiety for his wife (a daughter of General Gage), stating that he\r\nhad scandalously treated her, that she had consequently gone home,\r\nand that he had been living with a mistress.[192] Lord Yarmouth was\r\ninformed by a correspondent that the King turned his back on Craufurd\r\nat a levée, telling him that prisoners ought to keep their parole; the\r\nletter added that Craufurd was universally despised in England.[193] A\r\nlater report, however, represented him as receiving £1000 a year from\r\nthe Government, and the Duke of York was reported to have said that\r\nin such arbitrary detention the parole was not binding. Colombine de\r\nJersey, allowed a month in England, also did not return. Lord Archibald\r\nHamilton escaped in January 1804. Sir Beaumont Dixie disappeared from\r\nVerdun in September 1804, leaving his clothes on the river bank as\r\nthough he had been drowned; but he had falsified a passport and had\r\nbeen assisted by neighbouring villagers in his flight.[194] He was,\r\nhowever, recaptured and sent to Bitche, for attempts to escape or\r\nother misdemeanours entailed removal to that or some other fortress.\r\n‘There,’ says the late Mr. Childers, ‘the younger members of this\r\nunlucky colony appear to have amused themselves _more Britannico_\r\nin cutting deeply their names and descriptions on the outer stone walls\r\nof the barrack which formed their prison, and I read more than one name\r\nbelonging to well-known English, Scottish, or Irish families.’[195]\r\nFox and Addison, doctors on board merchantmen, let themselves down by\r\na rope from Verdun citadel, but being unable to get across the canal\r\nat the foot they had to give themselves up. Two other doctors, Thomas\r\nClarke and Farrell Mulvey, were likewise recaptured and sent to the\r\nfortress of Metz, Mulvey, however, in 1806 being allowed to return\r\non parole to Verdun. Three surgeons, Baird, Cameron, and Hawthorn,\r\nescaped. In 1807 a midshipman named Temple escaped by crouching at the\r\nextremity of a carriage, so as to be concealed by two women, his French\r\nmistress and her maidservant. The carriage got to Strasburg, where the\r\nmistress, being a native of the town, obtained a passport, and Temple\r\nwas smuggled in the same manner to Austria, whence he wrote to Colonel\r\nArthur Annesley expressing a hope that nobody had been molested as an\r\naccomplice. Unfortunately he was not equally solicitous or scrupulous\r\nwith regard to his creditors, for he left so many debts behind him that\r\nsome of the principal prisoners, revolted by his dishonesty, forwarded\r\na memorial to the British Government, praying for his dismissal from\r\nthe navy. Annesley himself, whose honeymoon had ended in captivity, got\r\naway in December 1811. A Dr. Alderson, married to a Frenchwoman, not\r\nobtaining an answer to an application for a visit to England to recover\r\n£400, took French leave, but his large farm near Lille was consequently\r\nconfiscated. Leviscourt, a navy lieutenant, who after several years at\r\nlarge on parole had been confined in the fortress and was no longer\r\non parole, endeavoured to escape, but being recaptured was dragged by\r\ngendarmes through Verdun, with a heavy cannon-ball fastened to his\r\nleg. Worsley, the schoolmaster, escaped from Mons to Holland. James\r\nHenry Lawrence, son of a Jamaica planter and himself a Knight of Malta,\r\nescaped in 1810 by pretending on the road to be a German. He had lived\r\nseveral years in Germany, and had published in German a Malabar\r\nstory, which on his arrival in England he issued in English, as also a\r\n_Picture of Verdun_. He subsequently led a roving life, chiefly\r\non the Continent, and died in 1840. His father remained a captive.\r\nAnother foreign knight, of the Order of Maria Theresa, Baron Charles\r\nBlount, obtained permission to reside at Bonn, but went to Cleves\r\nand fled. He was, however, recaptured and sent to Coblentz fortress.\r\nFrom Valenciennes there were forty escapes, and Lawrence says, ‘Every\r\nmorning those who came upon the promenade inquired who had decamped in\r\nthe preceding night.’ Fortunately there was yet no electric telegraph\r\nto give the hue and cry. Colonel Hill, of the Shropshire militia,\r\nprobably a brother of Lord Hill, escaped and rejoined his regiment.\r\nBrooke, M.P. for Newton, Lancashire, quitting a large dinner-party at\r\nValenciennes in October 1804, audaciously drove through the town with\r\nhis French valet, who had obtained a passport for two merchants, and\r\nsafely reached Cologne. Francis and Thomas Jodrell waited in December\r\n1803 on the commandant of Valenciennes, told him they withdrew their\r\nparole, and drove off. Colonel Smyth accompanied them. All three were\r\nrecaptured in the duchy of Berg, albeit Bavarian soil, and Napoleon had\r\nordered a court-martial, but they giving a sentry the slip got clear\r\noff. Francis was High Sheriff of Cheshire in 1813; Thomas was killed\r\nat Rosetta in 1807. Philip de Crespigny, who had been married at the\r\nDanish Embassy in 1809, escaped from St. Germain in 1811. Wright, a\r\nmidshipman, brother of the unfortunate Captain John Wesley Wright,\r\nfacilitated the escape of a friend by holding the rope with which he\r\ndescended from the ramparts at Verdun, whereupon he was consigned to\r\nthe fortress. So also was Knox, he having become surety for a Captain\r\nBrown, who escaped but was recaptured.\r\n\r\nWirion, by Napoleon’s orders, gave notice in 1805 after three escapes\r\nthat the captives must be responsible for one another if they wished\r\nto be treated as men of honour, and that at the first escape all\r\nwould be sent to fortresses. In 1806, moreover, a reward of 50 francs\r\nfor the capture of any fugitive was offered at Valenciennes. It was\r\nvery hard on the sureties to be shut up in a fortress if the men for\r\nwhom they were answerable did not return on the expiration of their\r\nleave of absence, but this may in some cases have been preconcerted.\r\nWhen in 1807 the Arras and Valenciennes captives were removed to\r\nVerdun, Wirion gave warning that the first man attempting to escape\r\nwould be shot, such being the legal punishment for breach of parole.\r\nThis excited murmurs against terror and tyranny. Yet very shortly\r\nafterwards he reported escapes, and it does not appear that he ever\r\nenforced his threat, although Napoleon in January 1811 ordered that\r\nattempted escapes should be punished with death and that the sentences\r\nshould be placarded.[196] It is obvious, indeed, that England would\r\nhave threatened reprisals. Sentences of six years’ confinement in\r\nirons were, however, inflicted on private soldiers and sailors, for\r\nI find that in 1812 Thomas Hudson, who by means of a forged passport\r\nhad attempted in 1808 to escape from Metz, had the remainder of\r\nthe penalty remitted on the ground that he had been instigated by a\r\nfellow-prisoner.[197] Had such punishments been imposed on captives\r\nof higher status England would manifestly have retaliated. Alexander\r\nDon, heir to a Scottish baronetcy, escaped from Paris in 1810. In 1808\r\nhe had been required to leave that city for either Verdun or Melun,\r\nbut must have obtained leave to return. An Italian lady, claiming to\r\nhave been married to him in Paris, but suspected of being merely his\r\nmistress, was living at Florence in 1812. He became intimate with Sir\r\nWalter Scott, who speaks of his literary and artistic tastes, his\r\nlively manners, his love of sport, and his oratorical powers, while\r\nLockhart describes him as courteous, elegant, accomplished, and the\r\nmodel of a cavalier. He was latterly M.P. for Roxburghshire, and died\r\nin 1826 at the age of forty-seven. His uncle, General Sir George Don,\r\nhad been captured and detained at Lille in 1799, when he went with\r\na flag of truce to General Daendels bearing a proclamation from the\r\nexiled Statthalter. The French Government threatened to shoot him in\r\nreprisals if Napper Tandy and his companions were executed. An exchange\r\nfor Don with Tandy was declined by England, as also an exchange with a\r\nFrench general. England in 1800 claimed his unconditional release, on\r\npain of imprisoning the French generals at liberty on parole. His wife,\r\nseeing no prospect of his release, applied for a passport to join him.\r\nHe continued a captive till June 1800. John, afterwards General Sir\r\nJohn Broughton, a Staffordshire baronet’s heir, got off in the guise of\r\na courier.\r\n\r\nTwo sailors named Henson and Butterfield escaped from Verdun, traversed\r\nall France, and reached the Mediterranean coast, but were there\r\narrested and sent to Bitche. Philip Astley, the circus owner whose\r\narrival in Paris has been mentioned, obtained a passport for Savoy on\r\npretence of wishing to open a circus there, but he went on to Italy\r\nand thence escaped. He was destined to revisit and be buried in Paris\r\nin 1814. James Callender or Campbell of Ardinglas, endeavouring to\r\nescape, was sent to Ham, the fortress in store forty years later for\r\nLouis Napoleon. While there he became the successor to a cousin’s\r\nestates of £3000 a year, but it was several years before he heard of\r\nit. He offered to present his horse to Napoleon, thinking thus to be\r\nliberated, but Napoleon insisted on his fixing a price and then sent\r\nhim double the sum. Campbell revisited Paris in 1815 and was sent by\r\nNapoleon to the Conciergerie. This was probably at the instigation of\r\nhis alleged wife.[198] Captain Charles Cunliffe Owen, father of Sir\r\nPhilip of South Kensington fame, seems in 1811 to have shammed lunacy\r\nand was consequently placed in an asylum at Valenciennes.[199] He\r\nhad cut a vein, but not dangerously, and had denounced an imaginary\r\nplot for seizing Belleisle. He was transferred to a private asylum in\r\nParis, whence in July 1812 he escaped. Captain Francis Tulloch, who in\r\n1808 had been removed from Cambrai to Verdun, effected his escape in\r\nDecember 1810.\r\n\r\nJohn Harvie Christie, who had gone to France to economise, after\r\nspending three weeks in Paris repaired to Bordeaux. Returning after two\r\nmonths to the capital, he found that arrests had just been ordered.\r\nHe went to the Norman coast, hoping to embark as an American, but was\r\napprehended at Fécamp, having unluckily in his possession a manuscript\r\ncopy of satirical verses on Napoleon and Josephine.[200] He was tried\r\non the charge of espionage, and though acquitted remained a prisoner.\r\nHenry Dillon and Lynch were arrested at Caen in 1809, and Poppleton,\r\nthe teacher of English, who with three Frenchwomen had abetted their\r\nescape, was sent to prison for two months.[201] John Giffard, arrested\r\nin 1811 on the point of embarking at Honfleur, was consigned to a\r\nlunatic asylum. William Throckmorton, a friend of Miss Berry, was\r\nalso recaptured at Honfleur in the same year. Another fugitive bore\r\nthe appropriate name of Hurry, and Wirion being just then absent, his\r\nsubordinate Courselles was suspected of having been bribed. Hurry was\r\na freemason, and with a hundred of the captives had been admitted into\r\nthe Verdun lodge. Wirion recommended that such admissions should be\r\nforbidden, for a French mason had confessed in private conversation\r\nthat he should have felt bound, had Hurry applied to him, to facilitate\r\nhis escape.[202] But non-masons also promoted escapes, for filthy\r\nlucre’s sake. Indeed this became a trade, and in 1811 two captains\r\nat Bruges were arrested for visiting the _dépôts_ and offering\r\npassports.[203] In 1809 six inhabitants of Arras were prosecuted for\r\nfacilitating the escape of an English lord, and at Verdun a breach was\r\ndiscovered in the walls just in time to prevent escapes. These had\r\nbeen so numerous among captains and officers of merchantmen that, with\r\nthe exception of those above fifty years of age or those having their\r\nwives with them, they were ordered to sleep in the citadel. Permission\r\nto go outside the town within four miles was also revoked, but was\r\nafterwards renewed on condition of mutual suretyship. Augustus Bance,\r\nat Valenciennes, applied for French citizenship and for permission to\r\nopen a soap factory at Antwerp. The latter application was refused,\r\non the ground of Antwerp being too near the frontier, but while the\r\nnaturalisation question was pending he escaped.\r\n\r\nMogg and three companions escaped from Arras in 1810, concealing\r\nthemselves in the day-time and guided at night by the moon towards\r\nthe coast. In a wood near Boulogne, they cut down trees and made a\r\nsmall boat, which a layer of suet rendered watertight, and they had\r\nbrought sails and rope with them. They were, however, discovered.\r\nThe authorities ordered the boat to be launched as an experiment,\r\nand there was not the slightest leakage. The men’s ingenuity was\r\nadmired, and they told the police inspector that if the Emperor was\r\ninformed of their daring scheme he would certainly grant them their\r\nliberty. One of them was accordingly taken before Napoleon, who asked\r\nhim whether his motive had not been a desire to rejoin a mistress.\r\n‘No,’ he replied, ‘it was to see my aged mother.’ Thereupon Napoleon,\r\nremarking that she must be a good mother to have such a son, released\r\nhim, giving him a small sum for his mother. We are not told whether\r\nhis companions were also liberated. Equally venturesome was William\r\nWright. He became interpreter to General Brabançon, and ultimately\r\ncontrived to get on board an English flag-of-truce vessel. He crept\r\ninto a trunk till the usual search before departure was over, and after\r\npassing an hour in this uneasy posture was safe. In his _Narrative\r\nof the Situation and Treatment of the English arrested by order of\r\nthe French Government_, Wright states that at Valenciennes an\r\nEnglish hotelkeeper, King, who had resided there for twenty years, was\r\nvery kind to his captive countrymen. Prisoners without money, says\r\nWright, were harshly treated, but the officials were open to bribes.\r\nWilliam Hamilton, according to a Boulogne tradition, was assisted in\r\nan unsuccessful attempt to escape by his jailer’s daughter, whom he\r\nafterwards married. He had entered the navy in 1803, and was captured\r\nin 1805. In 1817 he was appointed Consul at Flushing, in 1818 at\r\nOstend, in 1820 at Nieuport, and in 1822 at Boulogne. He was knighted\r\non his retirement in 1873, and died in 1877, aged eighty-eight, being\r\nprobably the last survivor of Napoleon’s prisoners.\r\n\r\nStewart Kyd, the ex-radical, and Dr. Barklimore escaped, but the two\r\nbankers, Boyd and Benfield, had to undergo the full time of detention.\r\nBenfield died in Paris, in straitened circumstances, in 1810. One of\r\nhis daughters married Grantley Berkeley. According to a police bulletin\r\nBenfield was a nullity, whereas Boyd was acquiring a thorough knowledge\r\nof French institutions. He arbitrated on a claim against the French\r\nGovernment by Schweizer, Swan’s partner and antagonist, who pronounced\r\nhim to be a man of great culture and acknowledged probity. He also\r\nwrote pamphlets on financial subjects. He was indemnified for French\r\nconfiscation, and from 1828 to 1830 was M.P. for Lymington. He died\r\nin 1837. Another man who made good use of his time was Tuckey, who,\r\ncaptured in 1805, compiled a maritime geography in three volumes. He\r\nhad previously published an account of a voyage to Botany Bay with a\r\ncargo of convicts. He died while exploring the River Congo in 1816.\r\n\r\nIn several instances besides those already mentioned detention was\r\nfollowed up by actual incarceration. James Smith, the filter-maker, was\r\nsent to the Temple in 1804 for talking against the French and extolling\r\nthe defences of England, to which he had paid frequent visits.[204]\r\nColonel Stack was charged in the same year with espionage. It is even\r\nalleged, but this cannot be verified, that he was condemned to be\r\nshot as an accomplice of the Due d’Enghien, but was reprieved. What\r\nis certain is that he spent three years in Bitche citadel, afterwards\r\nremaining a prisoner at Verdun till 1814. Colonel William Edwards,\r\na Jamaica planter, brother I think of Bryan Edwards, M.P., was\r\nimprisoned seven years on suspicion of having facilitated escapes. The\r\nyoungest of his twenty-nine children, born at Bruges in 1800, was Milne\r\nEdwards, the eminent French naturalist.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the liberations and permissions to visit or settle\r\nin various towns, for each of which Napoleon’s express sanction was\r\nnecessary, and we may begin with Lord Yarmouth, since he owed his\r\nliberty to negotiations, albeit fruitless, for peace. He had become a\r\nprisoner under trying circumstances. He went over to fetch his wife and\r\nchildren just as the rupture had occurred, and he inquired at Calais\r\nwhether he might safely land. He was answered in the affirmative, yet\r\nno sooner had he done so than he, with all his fellow-passengers,\r\nwas declared a prisoner. Curiously enough, however, he professed to\r\nconsider the detentions as justified by the embargo in England. He\r\nwas sent to Verdun, but it was alleged in March 1804 that he had been\r\nseen in Paris. Wirion, reproached with laxity on this account, denied,\r\nhowever, that he had gone further afield than Clermont on an affair\r\nof gallantry. He had been exempted, indeed, from the twice-a-day\r\nroll-call till all exemptions had been abolished, and he had also\r\nbeen allowed to go out shooting; but Wirion urged that permission\r\nto go outside the town tended to prevent escapes by rendering them\r\ndishonourable, and if such permissions were to be refused the garrison\r\nshould be strengthened, the walls being so dilapidated that egress was\r\neasy.[205] Yarmouth’s mother had been in favour with the Prince of\r\nWales, and he himself had then, as a youth, been admitted to Carlton\r\nHouse. When, therefore, Fox in 1806, on the death of Pitt, became\r\nForeign Secretary, the Prince asked him to intercede with Talleyrand\r\nfor Yarmouth’s release. Napoleon is said to have imagined that Fox was\r\nhimself interested in Yarmouth. He consequently not only gave Yarmouth\r\nunlimited leave of absence, but suggested that negotiations should be\r\nopened through this channel. In August 1805 Yarmouth had already been\r\nauthorised to quit Verdun for six months and to live near, but not at,\r\nParis. He announced that he chose Versailles, but nevertheless joined\r\nhis wife in Paris. This contravention was reported by the police, but\r\nwas winked at for a time.[206] In September, however, he was ordered to\r\nrepair to Melun. In May 1806 he was allowed, together with Lord Elgin,\r\nGeneral Abercromby, and Captain Leveson-Gower, to embark at Morlaix\r\nfor England. He returned _viâ_ Calais in June with credentials\r\nauthorising him to negotiate. He was not a novice in diplomacy, for\r\nin 1793 he had been sent on a mission to Prussia, charging only his\r\nexpenses. The police bulletins show how closely all his movements\r\nwere now watched. They tell us how he went to the Opera, and how he\r\nwanted to buy French rentes to the amount of a million francs at one\r\nstroke, but could only purchase first 100,000 francs and then 500,000\r\nfrancs. He called on Quintin Craufurd, Mrs. Sullivan being a friend\r\nof Lady Yarmouth, and he was said to be in love with her daughter,\r\nthe so-called Mademoiselle de Dorset.[207] In case of the success of\r\nhis mission he was said to intend buying up all the French brandy in\r\nthe market and selling it at triple price. A man of pleasure and an\r\nart connoisseur, Yarmouth could scarcely be much of a diplomatist, and\r\nin August Lord Lauderdale was sent to join him. He was believed to\r\nfeel annoyance at this. Lauderdale, as we have seen, was a follower\r\nof Fox and had always advocated peace. At the end of August Yarmouth\r\nwas recalled, announcing, however, that he should return in January,\r\nand hoped then to conclude peace, but Lauderdale had really superseded\r\nhim. Lauderdale nevertheless had committed a mistake at the outset. He\r\nhad asked to be presented to Napoleon, and had had to be told that it\r\nwas not customary for a plenipotentiary of a country still at war to\r\nbe allowed an audience, yet it was evidently no fault of his if the\r\nnegotiations proved abortive. According to a French writer who had\r\nstudied the documents of the French Foreign Office,[208] Yarmouth on\r\nthe 17th July submitted to Champagny a draft treaty by which England\r\ngave up Sicily to Joseph Bonaparte and recognised Napoleon’s conquests\r\nin Holland, Germany, and Italy; but Napoleon, instead of closing with\r\nso advantageous an offer, awaited the result of his negotiations with\r\nRussia. All August was consequently wasted in futile discussions of\r\nformalities, and when the Russian negative answer arrived Napoleon\r\ngave vent to his exasperation by breaking off the negotiations with\r\nEngland, so that Lauderdale at the beginning of October quitted Paris.\r\nThe last police bulletin in which he is mentioned absurdly describes\r\nhim as a spy, who had doubtless sent home information of military\r\nmovements and of public feeling in Paris.\r\n\r\nBoth he and Yarmouth now disappear from the scene, but Lady Yarmouth\r\nremained in France, being allowed to pay occasional visits to\r\nEngland.[209] Lady Hester Stanhope alleges that she had a French lover.\r\nIf this scandal has any foundation Yarmouth shared the fate of Lord\r\nElgin, who, as we have seen, was liberated with him. His too was a\r\nhard case. Returning from the Constantinople Embassy, he had passports\r\nfrom French consuls in Italy, and though not reaching Paris till after\r\nWhitworth’s departure had been assured by Talleyrand that he might\r\nsafely remain, and he doubtless hoped French waters might relieve\r\nhis chronic rheumatism. Lord Hawkesbury (afterwards Lord Liverpool),\r\nwho, according to Trotter’s _Life of Fox_, had in 1802 accepted\r\na handsome Sèvres dinner-service from Napoleon, in his diplomatic\r\ncircular of the 30th April 1804 made a pointed allusion to Elgin when\r\nhe said:--\r\n\r\n   ‘They (the French Government) promised their protection to such\r\n   of the subjects of England as were resident in France who might\r\n   be desirous of remaining there after the recall of His Majesty’s\r\n   ambassador. They revoked this promise without any previous\r\n   notice, and condemned these very persons to be prisoners of war,\r\n   and still retain as such in defiance of their own engagements\r\n   and of the universal usage of all civilised nations. They\r\n   applied this new and barbarous rule even to individuals who had\r\n   the protection and authority of French ambassadors and ministers\r\n   at foreign courts to return in safety through France to their\r\n   own country.’\r\n\r\nTalleyrand, in his annotations to this circular in the _Moniteur_\r\nof the 5th November 1804, and in his counter-circular, was\r\nsignificantly silent on this passage, which indeed was obviously\r\nunanswerable. Elgin, at first detained with sixty fellow-captives\r\nat Orleans, was allowed to go to Barèges and to send to England in\r\nOctober 1803 for Dr. William Scott, on whose report he was permitted\r\nto repair to Paris. Owing, however, to an unfounded rumour that\r\nGeneral Boyer was incarcerated in Scotland, whereas he was really on\r\nparole at Chesterfield, Elgin was ordered back to the Pyrenees. His\r\nwife remained in Paris, and he was not allowed to go thither to her\r\nconfinement, which took place on the 4th March 1804; but the infant\r\nexpired on the 20th April. He arranged, however, for daily tidings of\r\nher. When Thiébault delivered a message from him to her she showed\r\nno sign of affection, and General Sebastiani was then lolling on her\r\nsofa as though quite at home. She had, however, already made the\r\nacquaintance of Robert Ferguson of Raith, son of William Ferguson, who\r\nin 1793 had succeeded to the property of his uncle Robert Ferguson, a\r\nrich China merchant. Being also one of the British captives, Ferguson\r\nwas frequently invited to the Elgins’ Paris house. He was released\r\nas an F.R.S. and a mineralogist in 1805. Lady Elgin, who had joined\r\nher husband at Barèges in June 1804, went over to England in 1806 to\r\ntry and get her husband exchanged for General Boyer. Thence she wrote\r\naffectionate letters, and Ferguson also wrote as though interested\r\nin the exchange. But Elgin on his release in 1807 discovered letters\r\naddressed to her by Ferguson, which Garrow, Ferguson’s counsel at\r\nthe _crim. con._ trial, described as ‘a most ridiculous medley\r\nof love and madness, or love run mad.’ ‘They would disgrace,’ he\r\nsaid, ‘the worst novel of the last century.’ £10,000 damages were\r\nawarded. Ferguson married the frail lady--Anne Nesbit was her maiden\r\nname[210]--got into Parliament for Fife in 1806, and died in 1841. He\r\nwas cousin to the Miss Berrys, and had once been engaged to Agnes.\r\nBefore leaving Elgin, it should be stated that Napoleon, styling him\r\n‘one of the greatest enemies of the nation,’ had rebuked General\r\nOlivier for showing him attentions at Livourne. Napoleon had a grudge\r\nagainst Elgin, who, he imagined, sent the information which enabled\r\nNelson to follow the French fleet and destroy it at Aboukir. Elgin\r\nmarried again in 1810, was the father of Dean Stanley’s wife, and died\r\nin Paris in 1841.\r\n\r\nLady Elgin was not the only faithless wife, for in 1808 Scott, formerly\r\nvice-consul at Naples, declined to take back his wife, who had been\r\narrested while cohabiting with an Englishman at Saarlibre, and he\r\nrecommended her being sent to England, as he had long disowned her\r\nand she was penniless.[211] Lady Webb, letting herself down from a\r\nwindow in Paris, is said, moreover, to have eloped with Fursy-Guesdon,\r\na novelist, and grandson of the actor Préville.[212] She knew Madame\r\nRécamier and Chateaubriand.\r\n\r\nLord Beverley and Lord Lovaine, the eldest of his fourteen children,\r\nfound more indulgence. Though not released, they were permitted in 1805\r\nto reside at Moulins, which Lovaine liked so well that he remained with\r\nhis young family after 1814, though no longer a captive. He was fond\r\nof hunting, lived in style, and was very charitable. At the age of\r\neighty-seven he became Duke of Northumberland, but enjoyed the honour\r\nonly two years. Just after the capitulation of Paris in 1814 he and two\r\nof his sons lunched with Josephine, who told him that the English were\r\nthe only people generous enough to speak respectfully of the fallen\r\nNapoleon. In order to have done with peers, let me here note that Lord\r\nDuncannon must have been released before November 1805, when he married\r\nin England, and that the Duke of Newcastle, who came just within the\r\nage of Napoleon’s terrible decree, was released with his mother in\r\n1807. The mother had pleaded ill-health and family affairs, had offered\r\na profusion of compliments to Napoleon, and had adduced her succour to\r\nFrench prisoners previously to the peace. She had been allowed in 1804\r\nto go to the Pyrenees and in 1806 to settle at Tours.\r\n\r\nSome scientists, scholars, and physicians owed their release to Banks\r\nand Jenner on the one hand, and Carnot, Cuvier, and French doctors\r\non the other. Lord Shaftesbury appears to have been liberated as an\r\nF.R.S., but possibly as a friend of Fox. James Forbes, another F.R.S.,\r\nwho with his wife and daughter arrived in Paris from Brussels the very\r\nday after the decree was issued, was liberated in June 1804 through\r\nCarnot. He had previously been allowed to visit at Tours his brother\r\nMajor Charles Forbes, with his wife and five children.[213] Pinkerton,\r\nthe geographer, was likewise released in 1805. Dr. Carmichael Smyth,\r\nhaving in early life travelled in France and kept up a correspondence\r\nwith French physicians, profited by their intervention.[214] Dr.\r\nMaclean urged that he had not been in England for ten years, and this\r\nplea availed him. Jenner sent a letter to Napoleon in behalf of William\r\nThomas Williams, which Napoleon at first cast aside, but Josephine\r\npicking it up told him it was from Jenner. ‘Ah,’ he then exclaimed,\r\n‘I can refuse nothing to so great a man.’ Williams, who on watching\r\nNapoleon for a full hour at the Paris Opera had noticed that he never\r\nonce smiled, thought his countenance, on seeing him again at Nancy in\r\n1805, mild, though haughty. Jenner, a correspondent of the Institute\r\nin 1808 and a foreign associate of it on the death of Maskelyne in\r\n1811, also secured the release of Dr. Wickham,[215] and through\r\nCorvisart, the Emperor’s physician, that of Nathaniel Garland and\r\nValentine Goold. Corvisart likewise intervened for Dr. Burrell Davis,\r\nwho after graduating in medicine at Montpellier had been relegated to\r\nVerdun, and who published a striking pamphlet against premature burial.\r\nThis he forwarded to Corvisart, along with a petition to Napoleon.\r\nDoctors indeed, as was but right, were less harshly treated. They were\r\npermitted to make journeys to English patients, and in 1810 nine were\r\ngranted passports for England. Alexander Hamilton, though not yet an\r\nF.R.S., doubtless owed his release to having catalogued the Sanscrit\r\nmanuscripts in the Paris Library. Colclough became a member of a\r\nliterary society at Nîmes, in order to procure release as a scholar,\r\nbut whether this availed him is doubtful, for we do not hear of him as\r\na resident Irish landlord till after Napoleon’s fall.\r\n\r\nJohn Spencer Stanhope, of Cannon Hall, Yorkshire, treacherously\r\ndelivered up in 1810 by a Gibraltar privateer, was liberated in March\r\n1813, at the intercession of the Institute, in order to make an\r\narchæological visit to Greece: but literary or artistic accomplishments\r\ndid not always secure release. Joseph Forsyth discovered this to his\r\ncost. An Elgin man, his father intimate with Isaac Watts, he had\r\neagerly embraced the opportunity of visiting Italy. Starting as early\r\nas October 1801, he reached Nice on Christmas Day and spent seventeen\r\nmonths in Italy, but on re-entering France in May 1803 he found himself\r\na prisoner and was confined at Nîmes. Attempting in the winter to\r\nescape, he was relegated to Bitche, where for two years he was in close\r\nconfinement. He was then allowed to go on parole to Verdun. There he\r\nprepared and published in London an account of his artistic tour, and\r\nhad copies sent to France in the hope that it would serve him a good\r\nturn. But from want of interest, perhaps too on account of his unlucky\r\nattempt to escape, he could obtain no greater favour than permission\r\nto live in Paris, and even this after four months was revoked. He had\r\nto repair to Valenciennes and wait till 1814. He died in the following\r\nyear. Curiously enough, he regretted the publication of his book,\r\nalbeit it possessed considerable merit.\r\n\r\nMonroe, author of the famous ‘doctrine,’ then American Ambassador at\r\nLondon, was applied to by prisoners’ friends to solicit their liberty\r\nthrough his Paris colleague Livingston, whose dispatches to Washington\r\nwere sent by flag of truce through Morlaix. Ferguson, Lady Elgin’s\r\nparamour, seems to have been thus released, and a Colonel Johnston was\r\nthus allowed to go to France to see a kinsman named Oliphant.\r\n\r\nBut while release came to some after a few months, it did not come to\r\nothers till after long years. Robson, ex-M.P., confined at Nîmes, must\r\nhave had influential friends to obtain permission to embark at Emden as\r\nearly as November 1803. Sir Thomas Hare and young Augustus Foster were\r\napparently indebted to friends in high quarters for release. A wife’s\r\nheroic efforts, which, however, are not particularised, also effected\r\nthe liberation of General Sir Charles Shipley.\r\n\r\nChenevix, whose friendship with Berthollet stood him in good stead,\r\nin July 1803 read a paper before the Institute on ‘palladium,’ the\r\nmetal discovered in platinum ore by Wollaston, and sent articles to a\r\nFrench chemical journal. He was one of the original contributors to\r\nthe _Edinburgh Review_, in which, according to Thomas Moore, who\r\nmet him at Paris in 1821, he wrote against France. He was able without\r\nhindrance to visit Germany and Spain, as well as the Black Sea. In 1812\r\nhe married a French countess, and remained in France until his death in\r\n1830.\r\n\r\nOne of the likeliest ways of obtaining release was to petition Napoleon\r\nor Josephine in person. Mrs. Tuthill managed to present her petition to\r\nthe Emperor while out hunting, and he could not deny a lady, especially\r\na great beauty. Mrs. Cockburn obtained an introduction to her\r\nfellow-Creole Josephine, whereupon Napoleon[216] in July 1803 wrote,\r\n‘Do what is proper for Coxburn’ (_sic_). It was not, however, till\r\n1805 that he obtained permission to go to England for twelve months,\r\ndoubtless a euphemism for release. Cockburn, like Yarmouth, had been\r\nallowed to go out hunting at Verdun. John Maunde, an old Bluecoat\r\nscholar, was released in 1807, whereupon he went to Oxford to study for\r\nthe Church, became curate of Kenilworth, and formed an intimacy with\r\nLucien Bonaparte, in his turn a captive, whose poem he was translating\r\ninto English when he died in 1813.\r\n\r\nSir Grenville Temple was allowed in 1804 to go to Switzerland, and in\r\n1810 to embark for America with his rich Bostonian wife and their four\r\nchildren. Sampson Eardley was released in March 1806. Captain Walter\r\nStirling was liberated in time to testify at the Elgin trial to the\r\nconjugal harmony which had previously existed. Colonel Molesworth in\r\n1804 had permission to visit England, which probably meant release.\r\nJohn Parry, more fortunate than his brother James, was struck off the\r\nlist of captives. He alleged that he had been expelled from England for\r\nwriting in favour of peace, and he solicited and obtained permission in\r\n1809 to go and see after his brother’s property, intending to return\r\nand marry at Tours. Henry Seymour, the ex-M.P. and lover of Madame\r\nDubarry, was allowed in 1809 to go to Switzerland. He had previously\r\nbeen permitted to reside at Melun and Paris. Richard Trench, who had\r\nbeen married at the British Embassy in March 1803 to Melesina, daughter\r\nof the Rev. Philip Chenevix and widow of Colonel St. George, was\r\nallowed in August 1803, on account of ill-health, to go to Orleans,\r\nhis wife having managed through influence to save her husband from\r\nbeing sent to Verdun. From Orleans she made repeated visits to Paris\r\nto intercede for him. Her husband once in 1805 accompanied her, and\r\nin a secluded part of the Bois de Boulogne meeting the Emperor, told\r\nhim which way the stag had gone. Napoleon, however, was angry at thus\r\nmeeting alone a tall young Englishman who had come to Paris without\r\nleave, and after a night in prison Trench was ordered to Verdun. He\r\nwas soon allowed to live in Paris, but it was not till 1807 that Mrs.\r\nTrench, by personally presenting her petition, secured her husband’s\r\nrelease.[217] Meanwhile she had given birth to Francis, a theological\r\nwriter whom I remember as rector of Islip, but Richard, the archbishop,\r\nwas not born till 1808, after her return to Dublin.\r\n\r\nThere is no record in the police bulletins of the release of Thomas\r\nManning, who hastened to Paris from Angers on hearing of the rupture.\r\nThe family tradition is that he owed his deliverance to Carnot and\r\nTalleyrand. Let us hope that he got back in time to be one of the Diss\r\nvolunteers who in October 1803 received notice to be in readiness to\r\nmarch to London on the first notification of a French invasion--an\r\ninvasion, however, which, argued a letter in the _Times_, should\r\nbe welcomed as ensuring a grand haul of prisoners. In 1817, on his way\r\nback from Tibet, he stopped at St. Helena and presented the captive\r\nEmperor--their positions had been almost reversed--with tea, coffee,\r\ntobacco, two silk pocket-handkerchiefs, and two feather fans.[218] He\r\nhad been strictly charged to address Napoleon as ‘general,’ but when\r\nasked by whom his passport in 1803 had been signed, he replied, ‘By\r\nyourself, by the Emperor.’ Napoleon’s face lit up at this recognition\r\nof his rank by an Englishman. Impey was released in July 1804, perhaps\r\nthrough Madame Talleyrand, whom he must have known at Calcutta. Sir\r\nJames de Bathe is said to have procured the intercession of the Pope,\r\nto whom it was represented that his children in England might in his\r\nabsence be made Protestants. His son and heir was then only a boy of\r\nten. Sir James died in 1808. Greathead, the lifeboat inventor, was\r\nreleased in December 1804, quite cured of democracy, it was said, by\r\nhis French treatment. Greatheed, with whom he must not be confused,\r\nwas allowed with his son to go to Dresden and thence to Italy. The son\r\ndied at Vicenza in 1804 at the age of twenty-three. Granby Sloper, who\r\nhad settled at Paris in 1789 and had been imprisoned there in 1794,\r\nthough struck off the list of captives in 1803 and allowed to live in\r\nParis, had been arrested in 1806 as an accomplice of Wickham; but on\r\nproof that he had simply when at Berne asked the latter for a passport\r\nfor England he was liberated.[219] William Stone, who, as already\r\nstated, had taken refuge in France after his acquittal of high treason\r\nin London in 1796, was unmolested, and became eventually steward to an\r\nEnglishman named Parker at Villeneuve St. George.\r\n\r\nOne of the most singular cases of lenity is the permission given\r\nin 1808, on the recommendation of a Paris professor, to the two\r\nbrothers Lambert to leave Givet and exhibit themselves all over\r\nFrance. For several generations their family had had a scaly or horny\r\nepidermis.[220]\r\n\r\nThere is a solitary case of refusal to accept release. Richard Oliver,\r\nex-M.P. for the county of Limerick, though in ill-health and anxious\r\nto leave with his mother and sister, declined without consulting them\r\non learning that the passport had been granted at the instance of\r\nArthur O’Connor, whom he had formerly known. He disdained to be under\r\nobligation to a conspirator.\r\n\r\nIt would have been strange if money as well as influence had not\r\nsometimes secured release. The Rev. W. H. Churchill, of Colliton,\r\nDevon, was on his way to Lyons in May 1803 when he was stopped and\r\nordered to return to Paris. There he was dismayed to learn that all the\r\nEnglish had been consigned to Verdun. He pleaded for leave to escort\r\nan invalid brother home, but was told by Junot that unless he repaired\r\nto Verdun he would be sent to the Temple prison. He nevertheless\r\nresolved to wait and see what would happen. A gendarme duly appeared\r\nwith an order to take him to the Temple, but the name was misspelt,\r\nand the gendarme for a consideration withdrew, promising to say that\r\nhe had not found the man. Churchill then feigned illness, and a French\r\ndoctor prescribed for an ulcerated throat. In January 1804 Churchill,\r\nthrough bribery, as is believed, was permitted to escort his invalid\r\nbrother.[221]\r\n\r\nNext to freedom the greatest favour was leave to visit or reside where\r\nthe prisoners chose. Ill-health was naturally one of the commonest\r\ngrounds for such applications, and naturally these were viewed with\r\nsome scepticism. Lawrence states that Dr. Madan at Verdun made money\r\nby giving certificates of indisposition for exemption from morning\r\nroll-call. Two ex-M.P.’s, Nicholl and Waller, obtained permission\r\nto repair respectively to Lyons and Nîmes. Nicholl’s son was also\r\nallowed to go to a neighbouring town to marry a Miss Mount.[222] He\r\nwas ultimately released. The bookseller Payne was authorised to go to\r\nPlombières and Barèges. We thus see that watering-places profited, as\r\nwell as Verdun, by the detentions.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas and Lady Webb were in 1809 allowed to go to Savoy. Lady\r\nWebb, a convert to Catholicism, adopted in 1813 a little English girl\r\nseemingly lost by her parents and found among a troop of jugglers at\r\nLyons.[223] The waif, after being educated and apprenticed, became\r\na nun. Macnab was permitted to study medicine at Montpellier. James\r\nHeath, the engraver, was allowed in 1810 two months at Paris to copy\r\narchitectural designs. In that year also visits to the capital were\r\npermitted to two clergymen, Maude and Lancelot Lee, as well as to Lord\r\nShaftesbury, Captain Lovelace, Colonel de Blaquiere, and the brothers\r\nTichborne, Henry being in ill-health. In June 1810, however, all or\r\nnearly all permissions for Paris were revoked. But in 1813 Halpin\r\nwas allowed to return to Paris to complete his art studies. Colonel\r\nPhillips, who had accompanied Cook round the world, was permitted to\r\nvisit England in the summer of 1804, and General Scott was allowed to\r\nvisit his family at Versailles; but on refusing to name a man who had\r\nextorted money from him by pretending to have obtained such permission\r\nhe was ordered back to Verdun.[224] Sir Thomas Clavering, whose father\r\nhad been one of Warren Hastings’ opponents at Calcutta, had married a\r\nFrenchwoman, the daughter of an Angers dressmaker, and was consequently\r\nallowed to remain at Orleans. There he drove his own carriage and\r\nhad fine English horses. He was friendly with his neighbour, the\r\nactress Raucourt, and once took young Bonneval (afterwards Marquis\r\nand General) to her house, where there was much card-playing and the\r\nyouth lost all his pocket-money. In 1808 he was permitted to live at\r\nSt. Germain. In 1810 he sent his wife to England to try and effect an\r\nexchange. Meanwhile he was at Paris, living with a Vaudeville actress,\r\nArsène. She treacherously sent the police an anonymous letter warning\r\nthem that he talked against Napoleon and intended to escape. Cuthbert\r\nSharpe, through Regnier, Minister of Justice, was in 1804 struck\r\noff the list of captives, allowed to live in Paris, and ultimately\r\nliberated. Cramer, a man of a good Irish Protestant family, though\r\noriginally detained at Verdun, had leave, on its being known that he\r\nwas against the war, to travel freely about France. Settling at Tours,\r\nhe married a Mademoiselle Fereau and made the acquaintance of Courier,\r\nthe future pamphleteer. He died at Florence in 1827. Edward Dillon,\r\na naval cadet, being related to General Clarke, was permitted to\r\ncomplete his education in Paris. Sir John Morshead had permission to\r\ngo to Versailles to undergo an operation, and was ultimately released.\r\nAs near the end of the war as January 1814, Colonel William Cox,\r\nex-governor of Almeida, solicited permission to visit Paris.\r\n\r\nAmong the _détenus_ permitted to visit or reside in Paris between\r\n1806 and 1811[225] were Colonel Arthur Annesley, Charles Jerningham,\r\nLovell Edgeworth, Charlotte, Elizabeth, and Henry (sisters and son of\r\nSir William) Wolseley, John Daniel, ex-president of Douai College,\r\nThomas William Atkinson, Theobald, Henry, and William Dillon, the Rev.\r\nRobert Bland, Count Daniel O’Connell, and George Woodyatt, a student\r\nfrom Westphalia, afterwards a doctor at Worcester, and grandfather of\r\nGeorge Woodyatt Hastings, president of the Social Science Association,\r\nthe M.P. who misappropriated his ward’s money, making the usual plea\r\nthat he intended to refund it. They also included General Lord John\r\nMurray, General Sir Edward Paget, Sir Herbert Croft, Archdall Cope and\r\nhis brother, students in Paris since their childhood, Blount, another\r\nstudent, Atkinson, a medical student, John Jervis, the engraver,\r\nTerence M’Mahon, Christopher Potter, Smith, an engraver, Laurence\r\nStoddart, a paralytic Scotsman, Edward Hayes, the miniature painter,\r\nand his father, Sir John Coghill, and Benfield, the banker.\r\n\r\nAlthough women and children were not included in the decree they\r\ncould not always leave without difficulty. In July 1803 some girls,\r\nwho had been imprudently sent to school at Rouen, had got to Calais\r\non their way home when an order came to detain them as hostages for\r\na young nephew and niece of Madame Bonaparte who had apparently been\r\ncaptured on their voyage from Martinique. There may have been some\r\ndelay in the passage to France of this ‘Master and Miss la Pagerie,’\r\nas the _Times_ styled them; but assuredly England had no thought\r\nof detaining children, and it may be presumed that the exchange\r\nwas promptly effected. As for women, Anne Plumptre, as free in her\r\nmovements as at home, easily procured a passport in 1805; but her\r\nFrancomania was in her favour. The divorced wife of Comte de Melfort\r\n(she was sister of the Earl of Barrymore, and her husband a descendant\r\nof the Scottish Drummonds) was allowed in 1810 to go to England with\r\nher two daughters to look after property, leaving behind her two sons,\r\none page to the Emperor, and the other at St. Cyr military college.\r\nShe is said to have had a _liaison_ with the Prince Regent, and\r\nMelfort alleged that his marriage at the British Embassy had been\r\ninvalid on account of the difference of religion; but he was himself\r\na debauchee. Arrested in London for debt, he found a titled lady to\r\npay the amount and elope with him to France. Lady Donegal[226] and her\r\nsisters, Mary and Philippa Godfrey, got back to England as early as\r\nOctober 1803. Lady Maynard and Lady Ancram also obtained passports.\r\nA woman named Thompson, ninety-two years of age, captured in 1809\r\non board a merchantman which stranded off Calais, was at once, in\r\nconsideration of her age, sent back to England.\r\n\r\nSometimes women who had gone home on business did not find return an\r\naltogether easy matter. Thus Mrs. Clarke, who had obtained a passport\r\nfor England _viâ_ Holland in April 1807, was arrested by the\r\nEnglish authorities on attempting to return, was sent in custody to\r\nLondon, and was interrogated on suspicion of being a spy in the French\r\nservice. She easily cleared herself, but then waited to see her elder\r\ndaughter Eleanor married to Frewen-Turner, M.P. for Athlone, and in\r\n1808 she landed in France from Jersey. She was arrested, however, at\r\nSt. Lô, and had to give an account of herself. She stated that in 1791\r\nshe visited Toulouse with her daughter and her mother, Mrs. Hay,[227]\r\nand that in 1801 she took her mother and a younger daughter Mary to\r\nToulouse; that they removed to Paris two days before Whitworth’s\r\ndeparture, that her visit to England had been purely on business,\r\nand that had she not got a passage from Jersey she should have tried\r\ngoing round by America. She was allowed, on her story being verified,\r\nto rejoin her mother and daughter.[228] The latter as Madame Mohl,\r\nultimately famous for her receptions in Paris, coquettishly concealed\r\nher age, not liking to confess to seniority to her German husband. At\r\nher death in 1883 she was ninety years of age. Miss Lemprière, probably\r\nsister of the author of the _Classical Dictionary_, was permitted\r\nto return. Mary Masquerier, a governess, sister, doubtless, of the\r\nartist already named, was allowed in 1812 to embark at Morlaix for\r\nLondon. A Mrs. Cornuel in the same year obtained permission to go to\r\nEngland to fetch her two daughters, one of whom had for ten years been\r\nin the charge of an uncle in London, and all three returned on board\r\na smuggling vessel.[229] A girl named Warren, eleven years of age,\r\non board a vessel captured by a privateer in 1805, was restored to\r\nher father, quartermaster at Malta. Three children named Crane, aged\r\nfrom ten to sixteen, who had been sent to school in Paris in 1802,\r\nbut whose father could no longer afford to pay for their education,\r\nwere permitted in 1805 to embark at Rotterdam.[230] Mrs. Story and her\r\nfour little children, also captured by a privateer, were liberated in\r\nDecember 1813, as likewise ‘Madame Kirkpatrick’ with her four children\r\nand two nieces, who had all been residing in Paris. We shall hear\r\npresently of her husband. Catherine Russell, a young woman captured\r\nin 1812 by a privateer and landed at Amsterdam, showed such despair\r\nat being parted from her friends that she was allowed to return\r\nto England.[231] Mrs. Mary Bishop in 1813 had leave with her four\r\ndaughters to pay a visit to England, ostensibly to obtain possession\r\nof property, but really, so she alleged after the Restoration when\r\nappealing to Louis XVIII. for recompense, on a mission from\r\nroyalists. Lady Boyle had like permission in July 1813, but her\r\nhusband, the future Earl of Glasgow, could merely obtain leave to visit\r\nParis. Occasionally the English authorities objected to the landing\r\nof such passengers. Thus a Mrs. Borel, wife of a London merchant, was\r\nrefused permission to land at Dartmouth in 1813 for want of a formal\r\npermit; she took passage on another vessel for Portsmouth in the\r\nhope of there finding less difficulty.[232] The English Government\r\napparently suspected that some of these arrivals might be spies in\r\nFrench pay.\r\n\r\nEnglishwomen, sometimes accompanied by little children, having obtained\r\nleave from both Governments, mostly in order to rejoin captive\r\nhusbands, continued to land at Morlaix up to 1813. Thus Mrs. Dorothy\r\nSilburn, who had liberally befriended French _émigré_ priests in\r\nEngland, was authorised in 1807 to settle at Roscoff, where she spent\r\nthe remainder of her life, her tomb being still prominent in the old\r\nchurchyard. The Countess Bruce, separated wife of Puschkin--he made\r\nin 1810 curious experiments in galvanism, as it was then called--went\r\nfrom Venice to Paris in 1811 to solicit the pardon of a negro servant\r\nwho had been condemned to death for the murder of a female servant,\r\nwhereas the two domestics had agreed to die together because they\r\ncould not legally marry. He accordingly shot her, and wounded, but\r\nfailed to kill, himself. Among the arrivals was also the notorious Lady\r\nCraven, Margravine of Anspach. This fair but frail lady, who had sat\r\nto Reynolds and Romney, had visited the Austrian and Russian Courts,\r\nhad immediately on becoming a widow married the Margrave, a nephew\r\nof Frederick II., and had lived with him at Hammersmith,\r\nbut had been cold-shouldered by London society and even by her own\r\ndaughters. She had paid a short visit to Paris in 1802, and she went\r\nagain in 1807 to take possession of her second husband’s property. We\r\nhear little more of her till her death at Naples in 1828, where she\r\nhad settled in 1805, being joined by one of her sons, Keppel Craven,\r\nof whom we have already heard.[233] Another restless woman, wife of\r\nColonel Henry (brother of Viscount) Dillon, arrived in Paris in 1808,\r\nostensibly to join her husband but really to bring over letters from\r\nroyalist exiles, perhaps also to meet her lover, Latour du Pin. She\r\nwas arrested, and her husband disowned her. In 1810 he notified the\r\npolice that she had taken her children from Bordeaux and gone with them\r\nwithout his knowledge to England, where he feared she would divulge his\r\noffer to join the French army. Sir Robert Adair’s French wife in 1808\r\nobtained leave to remove from Vienna to Rheims, in order to bring up\r\nher daughters by her former marriage.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Pamela, widow of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, was allowed\r\nin 1810 to come to Paris, Napoleon directing Fouché to ‘pump’ her on\r\nEnglish and Irish affairs,[234] as also probably on Count Stahremberg,\r\nAustrian Ambassador at London, her reputed lover, for she had quitted\r\nher second husband Pitcairn, American Consul at Hamburg. Her daughter\r\nby the latter, who survived till a few years ago, seems to have been\r\nleft behind, either in Germany or in England.\r\n\r\nJulia Sayers, who had been a visitor in 1802, was allowed in 1805 to\r\ncome over and marry Pougens, the blind author,[235] natural son of\r\nthe Prince de Conti, to whom she had been introduced in London in\r\n1786. His fortune had disappeared in the Revolution, and he had turned\r\nbookseller. She was a niece of Admiral Boscawen and of the Duchess of\r\nBeaufort.\r\n\r\nWives were sometimes, however, refused permission to come over and\r\njoin their captive husbands. Margaret Stuart, who in 1806 had married\r\nHingston Tuckey, both having been captured at sea, on returning in 1810\r\nfrom a visit to England was unceremoniously shipped back. Sir Thomas\r\nLavie, stranded on the French coast in 1806, was refused his wife’s\r\ncompany, whereupon England forbade the wives of French prisoners to\r\nland in England. This retaliation apparently brought the French to\r\nreason, for as late as January 1813--so little was Napoleon’s fall\r\nforeseen--Englishwomen landed at Morlaix.[236]\r\n\r\nNor did women always escape imprisonment. A Mrs. Moore was arrested in\r\n1810 on the charge of facilitating her husband’s escape from Bitche.\r\nShe was, however, soon released. Again in 1812 an Englishwoman named\r\nTaylor, living at Rouen, returning to Morlaix after a visit to England,\r\nmet at the inn three sailors who had just been liberated from British\r\npontoons. ‘Ah,’ said she, ‘you only come from one prison to enter\r\nanother. You will be forced to serve in the French navy, and will be no\r\nbetter off than in English prisons. You will never be better off till\r\nBonaparte’--here she made a gesture indicating the guillotine. On being\r\narrested for this imprudent speech she at first denied everything, but\r\non being confronted with the sailors admitted all except the remark on\r\nBonaparte. She was ordered to be sent back to England.[237]\r\n\r\nThe banker Coutts wrote in 1810 to Lafayette, asking him to obtain\r\npassports for the south of France for his invalid daughter, Lady\r\nBute, her husband[238] and two children, a doctor and two servants.\r\nLafayette, in endorsing the application, stated that Coutts was banker\r\n(he should have said son-in-law) to Burdett, who had rendered service\r\nto the French prisoners. Lady Bute and her sister had been educated in\r\nParis previously to the Revolution by Madame Daubenton. Lord Bute died\r\nat Geneva in November 1814, and his remains were conveyed to England.\r\nCoutts also obtained permission for another son-in-law, Lord Guilford,\r\nto revisit France, but Guilford died before being able to profit by it.\r\nHe had long suffered from injury to the spine, occasioned by a fall\r\nfrom his horse in the act of presenting a basket of fruit to his future\r\nwife. His brother, who succeeded to the title, established himself at\r\nCorfu during the Greek struggle for independence, and was attired like\r\na Greek professor.\r\n\r\nJ. Cleaver Bankes was allowed, on the recommendation of Benjamin\r\nConstant, to come and examine Sanscrit manuscripts at the National\r\nLibrary. In 1813 Sir Humphry Davy and his wife, with his secretary\r\nyoung Faraday, passed through Paris on their way to Italy. They\r\nvisited the laboratory of Chevreul (not the future centenarian) at the\r\nJardin des Plantes, and at Malmaison were shown by Josephine books\r\nand extracts relating to Cromwell, marked in pencil by Napoleon. The\r\ninstitute had in 1809 awarded Davy the £60,000 prize for electrical\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bathurst and her brother, George Call, were allowed to pass\r\nthrough France in 1810, on their search for her husband. Call on\r\nhis way back solicited an audience of Napoleon,[239] whose portrait\r\nadorned his snuff-box, a request which shows that he had not the\r\nslightest idea of accusing Napoleon. His belief, indeed, and that of\r\nthe widow, was that Bathurst had been wrecked in the Baltic.[240]\r\nColonel Macleod of Colbeck, uncle of Lord Moira, after being liberated,\r\nactually in 1810 asked leave to settle in France. He was described by\r\nthe police bulletin as honest but weak-minded, and as having incurred\r\nunpleasantness in Scotland by his liking for France and his advocacy of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nShirley, a Jamaica planter, was also allowed in 1806 to settle in\r\nthe south, and Colonel Vesey, on the recommendation of the King of\r\nPrussia, was permitted to go to Barèges on account of his wound.\r\nThe British blockade of course barred the way by sea. The Marquis of\r\nDouglas in 1808 was allowed to pass through France on his way home\r\nfrom Russia, his health being unequal to a sea passage. Talleyrand\r\nhad recommended him as favourable to France. Father Gordon in 1810\r\nsolicited leave to return to Paris to urge his reinstatement as head\r\nof the Scots College. He apparently did not know that that institution\r\nhad been fused with the Irish College, where Walsh had, it seems, been\r\nreinstated, for in 1807 Walsh had asked permission for some students\r\nto come over from Ireland. Walsh himself, however, along with other\r\nIrish priests, was not allowed by the British Government to return in\r\n1811 to Ireland, such journeys to and fro being considered suspicious.\r\nFive quasi-Britons--Admiral Alexis Greig, born in Russia of Scottish\r\nparents; Admiral Robert Elphinstone, a native of Plymouth; Captain\r\nThomas Candler, of Dublin; Moffat, of Dalkeith; and William Crowe--all\r\nin the Russian navy, were authorised in 1808 to pass through France on\r\ntheir way back from Lisbon.\r\n\r\nTurning to involuntary visitors, precedence is due to Lord Blayney,\r\nwho, sent with troops to Malaga in 1810, imprudently allowed himself\r\nto be captured by the French immediately on landing. His book gives an\r\ninteresting account of his journey across Spain and France to Verdun.\r\nHe was treated with great respect, and in Spain could hunt and make\r\nexcursions without restriction. He does not tell us much, however, of\r\nlife at Verdun, where he passed three years. In 1812 England offered\r\nto exchange for him General Simon, who had been wounded and required\r\nmineral waters, but Napoleon apparently did not consider him equal in\r\nrank to Blayney, although assured by General Clarke that the latter had\r\nnot held a high military post.[241] Another general captured in Spain\r\nwas Sir Edward Paget, who had previously lost his right arm in battle,\r\nbut was able, after about three years’ detention, to resume active\r\nservice. He had in 1806 resigned his seat for Carnarvon. Lord John\r\nMurray seems likewise to have been captured in Spain. Sir Thomas Lavie,\r\nas already mentioned, who was wrecked on the French coast, was for\r\nsome months confined in the citadel of Montmédy and debarred writing\r\nmaterials. He was very kind to his fellow-captives at Verdun, and was\r\nallowed to go to Melun. Governor of the Royal Naval Asylum, he died in\r\n1821.\r\n\r\nRoger Langton, captured at sea in 1808, made an unsuccessful attempt\r\nto escape, and remained at Verdun till 1814.[242] Aytoun, an Edinburgh\r\nman, captured in an Austrian vessel in 1806 and sent to Verdun, was\r\nprobably a kinsman--perhaps Richard the father--of William Edmonstoune\r\nAytoun, the champion of Mary Stuart.\r\n\r\nAnother involuntary visitor was Captain Donat Henchy O’Brien, of the\r\nHussars, who was wrecked off Brest in February 1804, and was sent\r\nfirst to Bitche and ultimately to Verdun. Two unsuccessful attempts to\r\nescape--the first time he was recaptured at Étaples, and the second,\r\nafter crouching among a drove of oxen to pass the Rhine, he was\r\ngiven up by the German authorities at Lindau--entailed incarceration\r\nin filthy and stifling casemates, but in a third attempt in 1808 he\r\nreached the Austrian frontier and was able to resume service. He\r\npublished a full account of his adventures,[243] which was reprinted\r\nin 1902. Another sailor, Miller, captured in 1804 in the man-of-war\r\n_Wolverine_, escaped in 1811, and published an anonymous\r\nnarrative. Moir, a naval surgeon captured at sea, was joined by his\r\nwife, who in 1808 gave birth to a son, destined to become the ‘father’\r\nof the Royal College of Physicians, and to reach the age of ninety-one.\r\nThat son, John Moir, a prominent Free Churchman, remembered being\r\ntaken in his mother’s arms or by her hand when she waited on Napoleon\r\nto entreat her husband’s liberation, but we are not told whether she\r\nwas successful. Moir on regaining his liberty settled in Edinburgh.\r\nFrancis Milman, brother of the future Dean, was captured in Spain, and\r\ndetained at Verdun till January 1814,[244] when Jenner obtained his\r\nrelease. Edward Boyse, midshipman of the _Phœbe_, was captured\r\nin July 1803 in a boat off Toulon, and conducted first to Verdun and\r\nthen to Valenciennes; but with two comrades he escaped from the latter\r\nfortress.[245]\r\n\r\nClandestine visitors were naturally suspected of being spies.[246] Thus\r\nthe son of Dickinson, the artist, ex-secretary to the Ottoman Embassy\r\nin London, entered France under the name of Lambert in 1805, apparently\r\nin order to join his father in Paris; but he had given up painting and\r\nhad been in the employ of the British Government. He proved that he\r\nhad come to see a Madame Gourbillon, of whom he had been enamoured in\r\nLondon, but the authorities suspected that he might occupy his leisure\r\nin sending reports to England, and he was consequently despatched to\r\nVerdun,[247] albeit his sister was companion to Madame Talleyrand. But\r\nhe must have been liberated, for we hear of another visit in 1810.\r\n\r\nThomas Graham, arrested at Pepignan in 1810, had entered France from\r\nSpain, but having a mission to General Clarke and Arthur O’Connor he\r\nwas released. William Hayne, lace-maker of Nottingham, and having an\r\nextensive continental trade, was arrested in Paris in 1807, having a\r\nstock of lace in his possession. What was done with this venturesome\r\ntrader is not stated. Nathaniel Parker Forth, a diplomatic emissary,\r\nthe satellite of the Duke of Orleans who procured Pamela for Madame\r\nde Genlis, was reported to be in Paris in 1805, and was ordered to\r\nbe watched;[248] but if such ‘a consummate intriguer’ had really\r\nbeen there he would certainly have been arrested and expelled. James\r\nMathews, another diplomatic interloper, who had been arrested in Paris\r\nin 1793, landed at Havre without a passport in 1807 and vainly tried\r\nto pass for an American. The notorious swindler, Lisle Semple, was\r\nalso reported to have been seen in Paris in 1805, yet this too is\r\nunconfirmed. He had been expelled as a spy in 1802.\r\n\r\nThere was even a report in Paris in 1805 that six English officers had\r\ncome over to witness the coronation, but this seems highly improbable.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s long arm reached not only to Hamburg but to Italy. In 1806\r\nall Englishmen found there were ordered to be arrested, and Graham,\r\nconsequently apprehended at Venice, was sent to Valenciennes. Edward\r\nDodwell, living at Rome, had to apply for leave to visit England in\r\norder to publish a work on Greece. John Wilson, a native of Liverpool,\r\nresiding in Italy, was authorised in 1810, on account of his health,\r\nto live at Geneva. He afterwards asked permission to become partner in\r\na firm at Bordeaux.[249] The Earl of Bristol, Bishop of Derry, would\r\nprobably have been arrested, as he had been in 1798, had he not died at\r\nAlbano on the 8th July 1803, before Napoleon had had time to look so\r\nfar afield for his prey.\r\n\r\nSir George Rumbold, British Minister at Hamburg and son of Warren\r\nHastings’ opponent at Calcutta, was seized by order of Napoleon in\r\n1804. It is believed by the Rumbold family that this was instigated\r\nby the famous Pamela, Lady Edward Fitzgerald, who was then at Hamburg\r\nand in league with the Irish exiles there, to whom Rumbold’s vigilant\r\nobservation was very irksome.[250] If so, she was guilty of treachery,\r\nfor she had been very intimate with him.\r\n\r\nRumbold lived in a neighbouring village, going twice a week into\r\nHamburg on mail days. A hundred soldiers under Major Maison landed at\r\nnight on the coast, and ten or twelve of them drove in two carriages to\r\nthe spot to surround the house and prevent any alarm. A sentinel was\r\nplaced in front of every door and window. On the arrival of the rest\r\nof the detachment, a German civilian knocked at the door and stated\r\nthat he had brought despatches. A servant bade him deliver them at the\r\nwindow, but the door was forced open and Rumbold was arrested in his\r\nbed. He expected nothing less than to be shot, as the Duc d’Enghien had\r\nbeen six months before, but Maison assured him that his life was safe.\r\nAll his papers were seized, and these were expected to implicate the\r\nBritish Government in plots to assassinate Napoleon, an expectation,\r\nhowever, which was not realised. The Prince Regent, moreover, according\r\nto a police bulletin of 1805, referring to such plots, had said, ‘Let\r\nus meet Bonaparte like men, not like assassins.’[251] Rumbold, on being\r\ntaken to Paris, was induced on the promise of the restitution of his\r\npapers to sign an engagement never to approach on non-British territory\r\nwithin a hundred miles of any post occupied by French troops. In Paris,\r\nif we may credit a police report, his terror revived. He asked for time\r\nto pray and to write to his family, adding that for eighteen months he\r\nhad been disgusted with politics, and but for his children’s interests\r\nwould have thrown up his appointment. He passed ten days in the Temple,\r\nand here is the description given of him:--\r\n\r\n   ‘5 ft. 11 in. Hair brownish grey. Eyebrows dark grey. Forehead\r\n   ordinary. Eyes greyish brown. Nose short, slim above and rather\r\n   thick below. Mouth medium. Lips thick. Chin round. Face oval and\r\n   full. A small mark on the left cheek.’\r\n\r\nThe King of Prussia had remonstrated against such a violation of German\r\nterritory, and had ordered his Ambassador to Paris to demand his\r\npassports unless Rumbold were released. Accordingly the preposterous\r\nintention of trying him for conspiracy, if ever entertained, was\r\nabandoned, and he was escorted to Cherbourg, where, not without\r\nrenewed apprehensions of being shot, he was handed over to a British\r\nfrigate. He had already repented of signing the engagement, an act\r\nof cowardice, he said, tantamount to resignation. The gendarme major\r\ntold him he might keep the matter secret, but Rumbold replied that he\r\nshould be bound to inform his Government. He also expressed regret at\r\nhis family affairs being pried into in his papers.[252] Rumbold, if\r\nthe French reports are to be trusted, certainly showed pusillanimity,\r\nbut the recent fate of the Duc d’Enghien was in his mind. The promise\r\nof restoring his papers was not fulfilled, and being censured by the\r\nEnglish Government for the engagement entered into by him, he offered\r\nto go back to France and revoke that engagement. This, of course, was\r\nnot allowed. In the following spring he repaired to Berlin to thank\r\nthe King of Prussia for his intervention, and he followed the royal\r\nfamily in their retreat to Memel. There, tended by Prince Augustus when\r\nattacked with fever, he expired in December 1807. His widow in 1810\r\nmarried Sir Sidney Smith, who likewise had had experience of the Temple\r\nprison. Both she and Sir Sidney ended their days in Paris.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 Sir Horace Rumbold obtained permission to inspect his\r\ngrandfather’s confiscated papers in the French Archives, but found\r\nthe family matters in them very meagre, while he suspected that the\r\npolitical portions had been withheld from him.[253]\r\n\r\nTalleyrand, in a diplomatic circular justifying such high-handed\r\nacts, charged England with prostituting the functions of ambassadors\r\nby making them instigate the assassination of the Emperor; but Lord\r\nHawkesbury in reply, while indignantly denying the charge, insisted\r\nthat a belligerent was entitled to have dealings with malcontents,\r\nand he twitted France with incitement of Irish rebellions. Napoleon’s\r\nevident maxim, however, was that all was fair on his own side, and it\r\nmust be confessed that, whereas no Irishman proposed to assassinate\r\nGeorge III., French malcontents looked for no success unless\r\nthrough Napoleon being kidnapped or murdered.\r\n\r\nA Colonel Butler was also arrested at Hamburg in November 1806. In\r\nthe French Dragoons until the Revolution, he had for eleven or twelve\r\nyears, along with Dutheil, been an agent for the Bourbons and had paid\r\nsecret visits to Paris. Two of his many children were there and were\r\nrich with their mother’s property. What became of him is not stated.\r\nPossibly he escaped.\r\n\r\nJames Smithson, natural son of the Duke of Northumberland, born in\r\nFrance in 1765, and future founder of the Smithsonian Institute at\r\nWashington, was likewise arrested at Hamburg in 1809, but at the\r\nsolicitation of Banks received a passport for England. He had visited\r\nParis in 1791, when he wrote--‘The office of king is not yet abolished,\r\nbut they daily feel the inability or rather the great inconvenience\r\nof continuing it. May other nations at the time of their reforms\r\nbe wise enough to cast off at first the contemptible incumbrance!’\r\nSmithson, who must by this time have been sadly disillusioned with the\r\nRevolution, died at Genoa in 1829, having mostly spent his later years\r\nin Paris.\r\n\r\nGeorge Sinclair, eldest son of Sir John, the great agriculturist, in\r\n1806, at the age of sixteen, was arrested by the French as a spy,\r\nhaving been found between the French and German lines just before the\r\nbattle of Jena. Sinclair, who became a general and lived till 1868,\r\npublished in 1826 in the _Representative_ an interesting account\r\nof his interview at Auma with Napoleon, before whom he was taken,\r\ntogether with his companion, a German named Rigel, by Count Frohberg.\r\nHe found Napoleon in a dressing-gown and white night-cap, and he was\r\nrequired not only to show that he had been on purely private business,\r\nbut to trace all his movements on a map and to answer questions as\r\nto the German troops through which he had passed. ‘All Napoleon’s\r\nquestions,’ he says, ‘were remarkable by their perfect clearness. He\r\nomitted nothing that was necessary; he asked nothing superfluous.’\r\n‘What guarantee can I have,’ said Napoleon, ‘of the truth of your\r\nstory? Englishmen do not usually travel on foot and without a servant\r\nand in such a dress.’ Sinclair was wearing a coarse brown overcoat. ‘It\r\nis true, sire,’ he replied, ‘that my conduct may seem a little odd, but\r\nimperative circumstances and the impossibility of procuring a horse\r\nforced me to do all that I have done.’ He produced some family letters,\r\nwhich Napoleon asked Frohberg to skim, and one of them was from Sir\r\nJohn Sinclair, commending his study of Greek and Latin and exhorting\r\nhim to master German and French. Thereupon Napoleon, softening his\r\ntone, said, ‘So you have learned Latin and Greek. What authors have you\r\nread?’ Surprised at such a question, Sinclair named Homer, Thucydides,\r\nCicero, and Horace. It was well he could not or did not name Tacitus,\r\nthe object of Napoleon’s aversion. ‘Very good, very good,’ he rejoined,\r\nand turning to General Berthier, he said, ‘I do not think this young\r\nman is a spy, but the other is probably less innocent, and they must be\r\nkept together to avoid suspicion.’ A nod indicated that the interview\r\nwas over, and Sinclair, bowing, withdrew. ‘When taken before him,’ he\r\nwrites, ‘I had the strongest prejudice against him. I considered him\r\nthe enemy of my country and the oppressor of the rest of Europe. On\r\nquitting him, the grace and fascination of his smile and that superior\r\nintelligence which illumined his face had entirely subjugated me.’\r\nNapoleon directed Frohberg to tell the young man he was much pleased\r\nwith the frankness of his answers. Rigel in like manner exonerated\r\nhimself, and both, subjected to a few days’ honourable detention, were\r\nliberated after the battle of Jena, a place which Sinclair had passed\r\non his route and had pointed out to Napoleon on the map.\r\n\r\nShould we reckon among the British--she was at any rate among the\r\nnotable--involuntary visitors the Countess of Albany, widow of the\r\nYoung Pretender, quasi-widow of the poet Alfieri, and quasi-wife of\r\nFabre of Montpellier? She started from Florence for Paris in 1806, with\r\nthe view of publishing Alfieri’s works, but turned back at Turin on\r\nfinding that François Xavier Fabre, as an _émigré_, would not be\r\nallowed to re-enter France. In the autumn of 1809, however, Napoleon\r\nrequired her to come to Paris to exculpate herself from a charge of\r\nintrigues with England. All that she had really done had been to refuse\r\nto receive Clarke when French Minister at Florence, and to apply to\r\nthe English Government for an annuity to compensate the one lost by\r\nthe death of her brother-in-law, Cardinal York, the titular Henry\r\nIX. She had accordingly been granted £1000 a year. She easily\r\ncleared herself, and Napoleon seems to have been a little ashamed of\r\ndisturbing so inoffensive a woman. He jestingly told her that her\r\ninfluence on Florentine society hampered the fusion desired by him\r\nbetween Tuscans and French. This, he said, was why he had summoned\r\nher to live in Paris, where she would have more ample opportunity of\r\ngratifying her artistic tastes. The interview lasted only a quarter of\r\nan hour, Napoleon gave her his box at the theatre one night that she\r\nmight see Talma. It was not till the end of 1810 that she was permitted\r\nto return to Florence.[254] A letter addressed to her in 1814\r\npiquantly contrasted her husband’s expulsion from France in 1748 with\r\nher own enforced residence there, adding, ‘You have left many regrets\r\nin the great Babylon.’\r\n\r\nSuch of the English as were allowed to inhabit Paris, the permits for\r\nwhich, however, were, as we have seen, grudgingly granted and liable to\r\nbe cancelled by wholesale, had the slender consolation of reflecting\r\nthat they were in the ‘hub’ of the universe, for Paris in the height\r\nof Napoleon’s rule was more the centre of fashion and business than\r\nit has ever been since. It swarmed with Jews--bankers, jewellers, and\r\nmerchants--to whom the war afforded many opportunities of enriching\r\nthemselves. It also swarmed with adventurers of all nationalities, so\r\nthat in February 1803 the regulations as to visitors, whether French\r\nor foreign, were made almost as stringent as those issued during the\r\nRevolution. A list of the inmates had not indeed, as then, to be\r\nplacarded outside every house, but every householder was required to\r\nnotify the police of the arrival of any visitor or lodger and to send\r\nin the passport. This had to be applied for within three days by such\r\nguest or lodger, to whom a permit to stay in or quit Paris was then\r\ngranted. A foreigner’s permit was conditional on the certificate of\r\nhis ambassador, or, in default of an ambassador, by a banker or two\r\nwell-known citizens.[255]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there was no lack of celebrities or of men who\r\ninterest us on account of distinguished descendants. Let us begin with\r\nPius VII., the first Pope who had touched French soil since\r\nthe return to Rome from Avignon in 1408. Like the Doge of Genoa at\r\nVersailles, he must have thought himself the most surprising object\r\nin Paris. Manzoni, the Italian poet and novelist, Oersted, the Danish\r\nscientist, and Francis Arago, the future astronomer, whose family\r\nhad sought at Perpignan a refuge from Spanish commotions, may next\r\nbe noted. Spurzheim, the phrenologist, comes considerably lower down\r\nin eminence. The statesmen include Baron Hardenberg, destined to\r\nregenerate Prussia, and Count Nesselrode, the future author of the Holy\r\nAlliance and the Crimean War. The Poles include Prince Constantine\r\nCzartoryski, who, though a member of a great patriotic family, served\r\nin the Russian army, Count John Wielopolski, and Stanislas Wolowski,\r\nprobably a collateral ancestor of the economist who sat in the French\r\nNational Assembly of 1871. Marquis Emanuel del Campo, Spanish Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs, ex-ambassador at London and in 1795 at Paris, was\r\nthe natural son of a Spanish grandee, an envoy also to London, by an\r\nEnglishwoman named Field, a name which he had turned into Campo. He\r\ncommenced life in an orphanage. James and Julius Beccaria were probably\r\nkinsmen of the Milanese philosopher. Count Tolstoi, the Russian\r\nambassador, and Andrew Tolstoi, apparently his son, may have been\r\nancestors of the great novelist. Ferdinand de Hérédia was probably the\r\nfather of the French Minister of Public Works in 1887, and grandfather\r\nof the academician and poet. Dias and Emanuel Oliveira, the former a\r\nmerchant at Oporto, the latter a doctor, were probably ancestors of\r\nthe Benjamin Oliveira who in the House of Commons anticipated Cobden by\r\nadvocating reduced tariffs on foreign wines. Joseph Samuda, a Barcelona\r\nmerchant, was probably uncle of the great East London shipbuilder and\r\nM.P. Philip Gavazzi, an Italian merchant, may have been the father of\r\nthe anti-papal ecclesiastic who joined Garibaldi in Naples and died in\r\n1889.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen domiciled, if not naturalised, abroad were not subject to\r\ndetention, which indeed was not prospective in the decree, but was\r\nlimited to persons then on French soil. The Berlin decree of 1807\r\nordered, it is true, the capture of all British subjects irrespective\r\nof sex or age found in territories occupied by French or allied\r\ntroops; but this does not seem to have been enforced. Hence the\r\npolice registers[256] show visits to Paris between 1806 and 1813 by\r\nEnglishmen settled on the Continent, but it is not always easy to\r\ndistinguish these from men of English names, descendants of Jacobites\r\nor other emigrants, born abroad. In any case the registers are evidence\r\nthat British subjects or men of British descent were sprinkled all\r\nover Europe, some as soldiers of fortune, others as manufacturers or\r\nartisans, and a few as land-owners. Thus the register of Spaniards\r\ngives us Colonel Peter Aylmer, Patrick MacMahon, a merchant at San\r\nSebastian, Thomas Moore, a landowner born in Spain, William Mulvey, a\r\nnative of Cadiz, O’Farrill, Ambassador to Berlin, William Stirling, a\r\nmerchant born at Barcelona, Charles Willcox, a landowner also born\r\nthere, and Colonel Charles Augustus Joseph Walsh de Serrant, one of\r\nwhose family conveyed the Young Pretender to Scotland in 1745. The\r\nso-called Portuguese included Henry Gallwey and Joseph O’Moran, latter\r\na commercial traveller.\r\n\r\nThe Dutchmen comprise General O’Connor, a native of Holland, Benjamin\r\nJohn Hopkinson, a domiciled landowner, and Robert Twiss, a merchant,\r\napparently the father of Francis and Richard Twiss, and the grandfather\r\nof Horace Twiss. The Belgians were considered Frenchmen, or we should\r\nhave heard of William Cockerill, one of the three sons of the man who\r\nfounded the famous ironworks at Seraing. The Prussians and Poles, who\r\nare classed together, comprise William Flint and Augustus and John\r\nSimpson, merchants, Catherine and Richard Fitzgerald, land-owners,\r\nnatives of Dublin, Samuel Turner, ‘president of canton,’ whatever that\r\nmay mean, also from Dublin, and Baron Butler, a major captured in the\r\nfield. Among Danes are Edmund de Bourke, Ambassador to Spain, and\r\nDavid Turnbull, a manufacturer at Altona. The Russians include Baron\r\nJohn Richard Bourke, Reuben Beasley, a merchant, Dr. William Birt, and\r\nWilliam Lind, surgeon, both natives of St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nAmong Swiss are John Archer and Walter and David Johnston, two sons\r\nof a wine merchant at Bordeaux who had not yet been naturalised\r\nin France, but was unmolested and allowed in 1812 to visit Paris.\r\nLast but not least is William Kirkpatrick, a son of the Scottish\r\n(Closeburn) baronet, who was a winemerchant at Malaga, and had married\r\nFrançoise de Grévignée, daughter of a Walloon, also settled at Malaga.\r\nKirkpatrick, who had been appointed Consul at Hamburg by the Grand Duke\r\nof Oldenburg, was in Paris in 1808 and was anxious to return to Malaga,\r\nbut the French police suspected him of relations with England and had\r\narrested his partner Turnbull. His daughter Maria Emanuele, born in\r\n1796, was destined to be the mother of the Empress Eugénie, while her\r\nmother’s sister, wife of Mathieu de Lesseps, was destined to be the\r\nmother of Ferdinand de Lesseps.\r\n\r\nThere were of course in eleven years deaths, and even tragical deaths,\r\namong the captives. The Marquis and Marchioness of Tweeddale were\r\nallowed to visit Paris in November 1803, but were soon relegated to\r\nVerdun, and the gendarme who escorted them thither insisted, Lawrence\r\ntells us, on riding inside the carriage and even on dining with them.\r\nLady Tweeddale, sister of Lord Lauderdale, died at Verdun in 1804, and\r\nher husband, while awaiting permission to have her buried in England,\r\nwas also taken ill, and died two months afterwards.[257] Napoleon’s\r\noffer, ‘as a mark of respect for Fox,’ of twelve months’ leave, came\r\ntoo late. James Parry, ex-editor of the _Courier_, had been\r\nimprisoned in 1799 for six months for an article animadverting on the\r\nTsar, whom the British Government then wished to court; he had sold\r\nhis newspaper to Daniel Stuart, proprietor of the _Morning Post_,\r\nand in 1802 had settled at Arles. Though for three years a paralytic\r\nhe was mercilessly ordered to Verdun and died there. His young son was\r\nadopted by Ginguené, the eminent literary critic.\r\n\r\nJames Payne, the bookseller, died in Paris in 1809 at the age of\r\nforty-three, leaving a young widow who went back to England in 1811.\r\nShe was escorted by the Widmers, nephews of the calico-printer\r\nOberkampf, who thus returned the long compulsory stay with their uncle\r\nof Robert Hendry. Hendry was a Glasgow dyer, whom Napoleon on a visit\r\nto Oberkampf’s calico-factory allowed to return home, nominally for a\r\nvisit; but this was doubtless an euphemism for release. John Leatham,\r\nformerly of Madras, died at Nantes in 1811. Peter Colombine, of London,\r\ndied in Paris in 1813. He was probably the brother of the Norwich\r\nalderman known to Mrs. Opie, who in 1802 was defrauded of his property\r\nand reduced to accepting an annuity of £100 from the Corporation of\r\nthat city.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. Bentinck, an Oxonian who is said to have been promised a\r\nbishopric, died at Paris in June 1804. The Rev. John Dring, rector\r\nof Heathfield, Sussex, died at Orleans in 1806. Coulson Walhope,\r\nex-M.P., was subjected to special surveillance, apparently on account\r\nof a report, doubtless calumnious, that he had visited France just\r\nafter Napoleon’s return from Egypt with the design of shooting him.\r\nWalhope likewise ended his days at Verdun in 1807, shortly after\r\ngiving a dinner-party. A doctor captured at sea committed suicide in\r\n1805, leaving a bottle inscribed, ‘No more medicine after this.’ A\r\nthird clergyman, White of Lancaster, died at Verdun in 1806, and a\r\nfourth, Annesley, at Geneva in 1807, his widow being then allowed a\r\npassport for England. He was probably a kinsman of the colonel already\r\nmentioned, but I cannot trace him in the Annesley pedigree. Thomas\r\nTalbot, aged twenty-eight, suffocated himself by charcoal at Paris in\r\n1806, leaving a letter to his mother with a list of his debts (probably\r\nat cards) which he begged her to discharge.[258] Dr. Walter Kirby also\r\ndied at Paris. A man named Burgh or Burke, on account of gambling\r\ndebts, shot himself at Paris in August 1813.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of incurable prisoners had been sent back by\r\nEngland, and in 1810 there were negotiations for an exchange. Colin\r\nAlexander Mackenzie[259] was sent to Morlaix for that purpose, with\r\nWilliam Dickinson as his secretary. He went on to Paris, to witness\r\nNapoleon’s marriage festivities. France proposed an exchange _en\r\nmasse_, with payment of a sum of money to cover the difference\r\nin numbers. On this being declined, she suggested an exchange, man\r\nfor man, grade for grade, and offered to throw 20,000 Spaniards into\r\nthe bargain. She wished 3000 Frenchmen to be exchanged for 1000\r\nEnglish and 2000 Spaniards. England offered to give 3000 French for\r\n17,000 Hanoverians, but France insisted on 6000 of the former. As\r\nfor the _détenus_, the British Government, reluctantly waiving\r\nthe legality of their arrest, proposed that Lord Lovaine should be\r\nexchanged for a general, sons of peers or privy councillors for\r\ncolonels or navy captains, baronets and knights for officers, untitled\r\ngentlemen for captains of the line or naval lieutenants, tradesmen\r\nfor subalterns, servants and mechanics for privates or seamen. There\r\nwas a difficulty, however, as to Hanoverians and Spaniards, and no\r\nagreement was arrived at. Mackenzie, who had arrived on the 24th April,\r\naccordingly left on the 6th November. During his stay at Morlaix his\r\nmovements had been closely watched, and objection was taken to his\r\nwolf-hunting expeditions, as though these might screen confabulations\r\nwith royalists or observations on privateers. There had been, however,\r\nand continued to be, individual liberations. England continued to send\r\nback prisoners incurably ill, and on the other hand a sailor who had\r\nbecome blind was released in 1809 by France. He took with him a book\r\nin which a number of Verdun captives had written messages to friends.\r\nPowell, vicar of Abergavenny, having shown much kindness to French\r\nprisoners there, Clarke recommended, let us hope successfully, the\r\nexchange of an English sailor in whom the vicar was interested.[260]\r\nAdmiral Villeneuve in 1806 was exchanged at Morlaix, but unwilling to\r\nface Napoleon after his defeat, he committed suicide at Rennes on the\r\nway to Paris. There was also an offer to exchange Admiral Jurien de\r\nla Gravière for two colonels, but this was not accepted. The balance\r\nof prisoners was always largely against France, while the balance of\r\nescapes was--shall we say in favour?--of France. Thus in 1812 the\r\nBritish Government published a list of 270 escapes and 590 attempted\r\nescapes by French officers, whereupon the _Moniteur_ gave a\r\nlist of 355 English escapes, which it was urged was a much greater\r\nproportionate number. Sir James Craufurd figured at the head of the\r\nlist. But the great majority of these English fugitives were officers\r\nor sailors of merchant vessels captured at sea after the resumption of\r\nhostilities. Some of the French escapes were effected through a noted\r\nEnglish smuggler named Robinson; we do not hear of his assisting any of\r\nhis own countrymen, as this would obviously have stopped his favourable\r\nreception in France.\r\n\r\nApplications for release or for permission to visit England latterly\r\nbecame numerous. Release was besought in many instances on the plea of\r\nage and infirmity (and we may suppose that doctors were complaisant\r\nin granting such certificates) or for having rescued French citizens\r\nfrom fire or shipwreck. Two sailors who in a rescue from the waves had\r\nactually been captured had irresistible claims not so much to clemency\r\nas to gratitude. Poor Colonel Cope’s botanical studies, moreover, had\r\nnot apparently warded off insanity, on which ground his sister in 1813\r\npetitioned for his release. William Story, the chemist, had reached\r\nthe age of sixty-three, and Napoleon’s decree had fixed sixty as the\r\nlimit of detention. He applied for six months’ leave of absence to\r\ntake possession of property bequeathed to him. Viscountess Kirkwall\r\nurged that unless her brother, whose father’s death had made him Lord\r\nDe Blaquiere, was allowed to settle affairs in person, the family\r\nwould be ruined. Lord Lovaine, with his sons Algernon and Percy, born\r\nin France, likewise petitioned for a business visit.[261] Sir Michael\r\nCromie in 1811, pleading that he had been a friend of Fox, and had\r\npurchased property in France, asked leave to go to England to his\r\ndaughter’s wedding.[262] Samuel Hayes, who in 1802 had come over with\r\nhis children that they might learn French, was allowed in 1813, having\r\nbecome nearly blind, to return home. As late as the 18th March 1814,\r\nsixteen released prisoners embarked at Morlaix.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, an escaped prisoner was sent back by the English\r\nGovernment on the very eve of the termination of the war. It is the\r\nonly case on record. A Lieutenant Sheehy, aged twenty-seven, of the\r\n89th Infantry, had escaped from Verdun in October 1813, but the Prince\r\nRegent and the Commander-in-Chief, rebuking him for breach of parole,\r\ndespatched him by flag of truce to Morlaix, where he arrived on the\r\n5th March 1814. The Morlaix commissary reported that he denounced the\r\nPrince Regent as a sot, and that if he had talked like this in England\r\nit might account for his being returned, but that such talk might be a\r\nblind for some secret mission. Pending instructions from Paris, Sheehy\r\nwas kept in custody, and we hear no more of him.[263]\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Mackenzie negotiations must have been a terrible\r\ndisappointment for captives who had already waited nine years and a\r\nhalf. As late as 1812 there was so little prospect of deliverance\r\nthat a prisoner at Briançon amused himself by scratching a sun-dial\r\non a slate, appending to the motto ‘Rule Britannia’ imprecations\r\nagainst Napoleon.[264] In April 1813, twenty-five chests of Bibles and\r\nTestaments had been sent by a flag of truce, apparently by the Bible\r\nSociety, to Morlaix for distribution among the captives. They were\r\ndetained at the custom-house pending a decision, and we do not hear\r\nthe result,[265] but in any case the books could scarcely have reached\r\ntheir intended recipients.\r\n\r\nYet although nobody foresaw the end of the war, Napoleon seems to have\r\nshown a little more leniency, while England in 1813 sent back 8000\r\ninvalided prisoners, and agreed, moreover, to occasional exchanges\r\neven of soldiers for civilians. Thus in 1812 she offered to exchange\r\na French captain for the banker Boyd, but this offer must have been\r\ndeclined, for in 1814 Boyd pleaded the loss of the sight of one eye as\r\nground for repeating it.[266] Release must soon have ensued without\r\nthe necessity of an exchange. In December 1813, fourteen English\r\ndoctors were exchanged for French prisoners, and we may hope that these\r\nincluded Moir, Armstrong, Watt, Campbell, Hogarth, and Jones, whose\r\nvolunteer services to the French wounded had been notified to Napoleon\r\nby General Clarke, as a hint for their release.[267]\r\n\r\nThe allies having entered France on the north-east and Wellington on\r\nthe south, the Verdun, Arras, and other captives were removed further\r\ninland. Napoleon, writing on the 11th January 1814 to Clarke, said,\r\n‘I suppose you have removed the English from Verdun’; but it was not\r\ntill the following day that the first detachment started for Blois.\r\nPrisoners with means provided their own vehicles or horses, but others,\r\nmostly captains and officers of merchantmen, seem to have been marched\r\non foot. Most of them, Lord Blayney[268] says, were accompanied by\r\nFrench mistresses who had acquired a surprising mastery of English\r\nsailors’ oaths. A second detachment set out next day. This sudden\r\nremoval had caused consternation, for though many had been captured\r\nduring the war, many others had been at Verdun ever since 1803, and\r\nhad got to feel at home there. Those, moreover, just under sixty when\r\noriginally detained, were getting into years and disinclined to stir.\r\nLogically, of course, they should have been released on reaching that\r\nage, but logic was not to be looked for from Napoleon. Tradesmen and\r\nhouse-owners, moreover, had given numerous prisoners credit, yet the\r\nlatter, if out of funds, had perforce to leave their creditors in the\r\nlurch. They could not wait for remittances, the order for departure in\r\nthree days being imperative. Some, indeed, borrowed money of friends,\r\nbut when the Verdun shopkeepers collected at the gate to make a last\r\ndemand for their dues, some of the prisoners who could have paid coolly\r\nshowed their purses to their creditors and then returned them to their\r\npockets, sarcastically remarking that the Cossacks would discharge the\r\ndebt. Five Arras captives made their way to the coast in lieu of going\r\nsouth, but finding no boat gave themselves up. Two others succeeded in\r\ntheir purpose. On the way to Blois, the younger child of Tuckey fell\r\nill and died. On reaching their supposed destination, the prisoners\r\nwere ordered on to Guéret. That town on the 11th of March 1814 had\r\nno less than 1064 English prisoners. Tidings of Wellington’s advance\r\nnaturally created restlessness among them. Sixty-four escaped from\r\nthe convent at Périgueux, to which they had been consigned, although\r\nthe officers had some days before, lest they should head a rising,\r\nbeen transferred to Cahors. A hundred and one escaped in a body from\r\nAngoulême, and as many more, under a negro named Louis, conspired\r\nto follow suit, but were detected in time. The gendarmerie captain\r\nrecommended their removal to spots more out of reach of the English\r\narmy.[269] There had, moreover, been escapes on the way south. In\r\nFebruary seven men, ordered from Arras to Tours, gave their convoy the\r\nslip, but were arrested in a barn near St. Valéry. Five other fugitives\r\nwere apprehended near Montreuil. A Frenchman at Dunkirk was arrested\r\nfor offering to facilitate escapes.\r\n\r\nNews soon arrived of Napoleon’s abdication. The Bitche prisoners, who\r\nhad been sent to Chatellerault, would but for that event have been sent\r\non to Rennes. A few of the English in Paris had obtained permission to\r\nremain, and were there witnesses of the short siege and the entrance\r\nof the allies. One of these was James Richard Underwood, for whom\r\nthe dethroned Josephine had interceded. He published in the _London\r\nMagazine_ an account of the siege and capitulation.\r\n\r\nArticle 3 of the treaty of peace of 1814 stipulated ‘that the\r\nrespective prisoners of war shall be bound to pay before their\r\ndeparture from the place of their detention any private debts which\r\nthey may have contracted there, or at least to give satisfactory\r\nsecurity.’ This doubtless took effect in England, where prisoners could\r\nnot leave without the knowledge or sanction of the authorities, but in\r\nFrance, occupied by foreign armies, there were obviously no means of\r\nenforcing it. Hence it is not surprising to find that at Verdun there\r\nwere indignant creditors. We do not hear of complaints in any other\r\ntown, but at Bitche and other fortresses the captives were lodged and\r\nvictualled by the French Government, and though clothes must have\r\nworn out, the shopkeepers were probably chary of giving credit, while\r\nthe captives on parole in Paris, Orleans, and other towns were men of\r\nmeans and doubtless of a high sense of honour. The eight or eleven\r\nhundred prisoners at Verdun, on the other hand, were of all sorts and\r\nconditions. Some could not, others would not, pay. When, therefore,\r\nVerdun learned that the sixty millions paid by France to England to\r\nsatisfy claims for compensation for confiscation had left a balance of\r\nnine millions, it perceived an opportunity for sending in its bill.\r\nWhat could be more legitimately paid out of this balance than the three\r\nand a half million debts of the prisoners? Negotiations were carried\r\non from 1837, and in October 1839, doubtless by the advice of the\r\nFrench Government, Routhier, a barrister, empowered to represent the\r\ncreditors, went over to London. On a second visit he was accompanied by\r\nfour townsmen, themselves apparently creditors. The memorial drawn up\r\nby them said:--\r\n\r\n   ‘During twelve years’ residence in a town in which they were\r\n   debarred the opportunity of procuring aid from their families\r\n   and their country,[270] the English prisoners could not but\r\n   contract debts and obligations, and they will doubtless\r\n   acknowledge that the kindness and generosity of the inhabitants\r\n   may have helped them to forget the disasters and misfortunes\r\n   of war.... At the moment of the invasion the majority of the\r\n   prisoners waited neither for official orders to depart nor\r\n   for the conclusion of treaties. They quitted the country with\r\n   all the facilities which circumstances naturally afforded. By\r\n   depriving the creditors of their pledge, by sending the general\r\n   officers, some to India, others to China, in the service of\r\n   His Britannic Majesty, and thus rendering it impossible for\r\n   the inhabitants of Verdun to sue their debtors, the English\r\n   Government made itself responsible for the payment of the debts.\r\n   The inhabitants put forward their claim from the outset, and\r\n   from the outset notes on the subject were exchanged between\r\n   the different Ministers.... If in that list there should prove\r\n   to be a single usurious debt, one that cannot be verified by\r\n   proper vouchers, let it be immediately rejected.... The number\r\n   of prisoners always exceeded 1200, and frequently amounted to\r\n   2000.’[271]\r\n\r\nThe memorial asked for an instalment of 5000 francs ‘to relieve the\r\nmost urgent cases of distress’ pending examination of the claims by a\r\nmixed commission.\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ of October 18, 1839, says:--\r\n\r\n   ‘A deputation from the inhabitants of Verdun in France has just\r\n   arrived in London to claim the payment of £140,000, the amount\r\n   of private debts incurred by English prisoners detained in that\r\n   city during the war. The deputation, composed of MM. Routhier,\r\n   Quentin, Leorat, Massé, and Trebout has, we are assured, been\r\n   most kindly received by Lord Palmerston, who seems to have\r\n   impressed the members of the deputation with the belief that no\r\n   time will be lost in submitting the demand of the inhabitants of\r\n   Verdun to a mixed commission charged with the liquidation of the\r\n   debts. Marshal Soult,[272] we understand, has written personally\r\n   to Lord Palmerston to suggest that a part of the nine million\r\n   francs (the unappropriated balance of a sum of sixty millions\r\n   paid by France in 1815 in liquidation of the claims of British\r\n   subjects) ought to be applied in payment to the inhabitants of\r\n   Verdun.’\r\n\r\nBut nothing came of this mission, and we hear of no further attempt\r\nby Verdun to obtain satisfaction. Thus ends the history of these\r\ninvoluntary guests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n                           TWO RESTORATIONS\r\n\r\n   The Restoration--Aristocrats and Commoners--Unwelcome\r\n   Guests--Wellington in Danger--Misgivings--Napoleonic\r\n   Emblems--Spectacles--Visits to Elba--Egerton’s Siege--St.\r\n   Helena--Eyewitnesses and Survivors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the fall of Napoleon thus enabled numbers of Englishmen to return\r\nhome, it allowed and tempted a smaller but yet considerable number to\r\nmake or renew acquaintance with France. According to Wansey, there were\r\nfour or five hundred of these,[273] scarcely any, however, staying\r\nmore than a fortnight or three weeks. The through fare from London was\r\nnow £5. The visitors had the interesting spectacle of the restoration\r\nof the Bourbons, while the very few who made a more lengthened stay\r\nwitnessed also the Hundred Days’ reign of Napoleon, and his second\r\nand final fall. Never surely in Europe in modern times were more\r\nstartling vicissitudes crowded into so brief a period. Even Spain\r\nwith its _pronunciamientos_ was not destined to present such a\r\nkaleidoscope. For a parallel we must go forward to the Central American\r\nrepublics or backward to the time when the pretorians made and unmade\r\nRoman emperors.\r\n\r\nThese visitors, like those who hurried over in 1802, included all sorts\r\nand conditions of men. There were statesmen like Castlereagh, anxious\r\nto weigh the chances of stability of the reinstated dynasty. He paid\r\ntwo visits, the first in August 1814 on his way to the Vienna Congress,\r\nthe second in February 1815. It was probably on the first visit that\r\nNey, dining with him and with officers of the allied armies, had the\r\nbad taste or want of tact to argue that an invasion of England, which\r\nhe said he had strenuously urged on Napoleon, would certainly have\r\nsucceeded. There were subordinate officials like Wellesley Pole, Master\r\nof the Mint and brother to Wellington, and Croker who, as we learn from\r\nthe police bulletins, preferred a complaint that American privateers\r\nwere still being sheltered at Bordeaux. It was not at this visit but\r\nat a subsequent one in July 1815 that Croker inspected the memorable\r\nscenes of the Revolution, discovered in the possession of Marat’s old\r\nprinter Colin a large collection of pamphlets, and was introduced\r\nby him to Marat’s sister, whom he found as repulsive-looking as her\r\nbrother. ‘Colin,’ said Croker, ‘had in some small dark rooms up two or\r\nthree flights of stairs an immense quantity of brochures of the earlier\r\ndays of the Revolution. What he had least of were the works of Marat,\r\neven those which he himself printed, which he accounted for naturally\r\nenough by saying that there were times in which it might be somewhat\r\nhazardous to possess them.’ Croker induced the British Museum in 1817\r\nto purchase the collection, and he afterwards formed a collection\r\nof his own which ultimately had the same destination. There were\r\npoliticians like Grey, F. J. Robinson, Fazakerley, Grattan, Whitbread,\r\nand Brougham. Brougham attended the sittings of the Institute, of\r\nwhich he was afterwards to be an associate, saw Laplace, and had a\r\nlong conversation with Carnot. This was his first visit to France, for\r\nhis step-grandson Sir Edward Malet is mistaken in stating that he once\r\nheard Mirabeau speak. ‘I never,’ says Brougham, ‘spent any time by half\r\nso delightful. My fortnight passed like a day.’ Are we to attribute to\r\nthis visit the birth of an infant afterwards known as Madame Blaze de\r\nBury, who died in 1894 at the age of eighty, and who in spite of her\r\nalleged birth as a Stewart in Scotland was believed to be Brougham’s\r\ndaughter by a French mother? She strongly resembled him both physically\r\nand mentally. Her husband had an English mother named Bury; her\r\ndaughter, like herself a writer, died in December 1902.\r\n\r\nThere was Thelwall, the acquitted Radical of 1794, who had temporarily\r\nrenounced politics and taken to the cure of stammering. There was\r\nArthur Thistlewood, who, it is said, had visited Paris in 1794, and\r\nwho soon entered into conspiracies, the last of which, named from\r\nCato Street, resulted in his conviction and execution in 1820. He was\r\ndecidedly an exception among the visitors, yet the Paris air may have\r\nhelped to lead him astray, for it was an atmosphere of conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThere were philosophers and historians such as Sir James Mackintosh,\r\nwho was anxious to explore the French archives, taking ten copyists\r\nwith him; but these formidable preparations not unnaturally\r\noccasioned obstruction from a suspicious curator, Hauterive,[274]\r\nso that Wellington had to urge that no mischief could result from\r\nthe disclosure of political secrets half a century old. Mackintosh’s\r\nson-in-law, Claudius James Rich, the traveller, accompanied him, and\r\nthe transcripts then made are now in the British Museum. They are\r\nlimited to the times of the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nArchibald Alison, the future historian, accompanied by a fellow Scot\r\nand fellow historian, Patrick Fraser Tytler, also went in May 1814,\r\nreturning by Flanders. It is not clear from their joint narrative\r\nwhether both or Tytler alone went in the autumn to Aix, staying till\r\nthe eve of Napoleon’s return.\r\n\r\nThere were three poets, Rogers, Moore, and Campbell, the last stopping\r\nat Rouen to see his brother Daniel, from whom he had parted at Hamburg\r\nin 1800. Mrs. Siddons took over her daughter Cecily, who did not\r\ncontinue her mother’s fame, but married a Scottish lawyer, George\r\nCombe. Kemble escorted her, with Mrs. Twiss, whose brother-in-law\r\nRichard had seen Paris in 1792. There was Mrs. Damer, the artist, of\r\nwhom we have already heard and shall hear again. There was the more\r\neminent sculptor Chantrey, who made the acquaintance of Canova. There\r\nwas Curran, who had just resigned his judgeship, and Serjeant Best,\r\nnot yet a judge. The Duke of Sussex had given Curran an introduction\r\nto the future Charles X. Everything he heard intensified\r\nhis hatred of Napoleon.[275] There were military men like General\r\nRamsay, Bruce, destined to assist in the escape of Lavalette, and\r\nLord Cathcart, who had taken part in the expedition to Copenhagen and\r\nwas subsequently Ambassador to St. Petersburg. Madame Junot, in whose\r\nhouse Cathcart was quartered, and who speaks highly of his courtesy,\r\nhad also to receive Lord and Lady Cole, who sent for Eliza Bathurst.\r\nShe was the handsome daughter of the diplomatist who so mysteriously\r\ndisappeared. Another military visitor was Colonel William Carmichael\r\nSmyth, who had accompanied his father in 1802; but Count Nugent, though\r\nborn in Ireland, was an Austrian officer. The Navy was represented by\r\nSir Sidney Smith, who was bound for the Congress of Vienna to plead for\r\nthe reinstatement of Gustavus IV. on the throne of Sweden. He\r\nalso advocated an international expedition against the piratical Dey\r\nof Algiers, of which he would himself have taken the command. Nothing\r\ncame of either scheme, but he got up a subscription dinner, attended\r\nby royal and other celebrities, the proceeds of which were devoted to\r\nthe redemption of prisoners in Algiers. Science was represented by a\r\nScottish professor, John (afterwards Sir John) Leslie, an Edinburgh\r\nReviewer and eminent mathematician, who formed the habit of paying\r\nyearly visits to the Continent. There were philanthropists like\r\nClarkson, who, as on his visit in 1789, was eager to obtain the consent\r\nof the new French Government to the abolition of the slave-trade,\r\nwhile Wilberforce and Zachary Macaulay, the historian’s father, were\r\ninteresting themselves at home in the same cause, the latter sending\r\nover, or taking advantage of the presence of, his brother General\r\nMacaulay. Clarkson found sympathy from Lafayette, Bishop Grégoire, and\r\nMadame de Staël. The antiquary and connoisseur, James Millingen, passed\r\nthrough Paris on his way to or from Florence, as also William Stewart\r\nRose, translator of Ariosto, friend of Ugo Foscolo, Walter Scott, and\r\nthe Countess of Albany. He was destined to find a wife at Venice. There\r\nwere painters like Stothard, Wilkie, and Haydon, to the last of whom we\r\nare indebted for the liveliest account of Paris, though this, like the\r\nrest of his journal, was not published till after his tragical death.\r\nHe represents Wilkie as constantly exclaiming, ‘What a fool Napoleon\r\nwas to lose such a country! dear, dear!’ Both Wilkie and Haydon sang\r\n‘God save the King’ in the streets of Rouen, to the amazement or\r\namusement of the townsmen, one of whom said they were English milords.\r\nIn Paris Wilkie tried to sell his prints, and had frequent disputes at\r\nrestaurants about change. Another note-taker was Thomas Raikes, brother\r\nof the founder of Sunday-schools, but unfortunately his diary does not\r\nbegin till 1832. A third diarist was Henry Crabb Robinson, to whom\r\nstreet urchins at Dieppe shouted ‘Be off!’ and who in a Rouen theatre\r\nheard a line against England applauded. He spent five weeks in Paris\r\nwithout a moment’s _ennui_, yet left it without a moment’s regret,\r\ntravelling to Boulogne in company with Copleston, ‘a very sensible,\r\nwell-informed clergyman,’ just elected Provost of Oriel at Oxford, and\r\ndestined to be Bishop of Llandaff. Stephen Weston and William Shepherd\r\nwent doubtless with the intention of again reporting their adventures.\r\nWilliam D. Fellowes found material for one of his books, and on another\r\nvisit in 1817 he visited the old monastery of La Trappe. There were\r\nagriculturists like Morris Birkbeck of Wanborough. There were doctors\r\nlike Hume, chief physician to the army, and Williams the oculist.\r\n\r\nAmong the aristocratic visitors were Viscount Ponsonby, afterwards\r\nAmbassador to Constantinople and Vienna, and the Duke and Duchess of\r\nRutland, parents of the present Duke of Rutland, the Duke publishing\r\nhis fortnight’s journal and receiving many attentions from Count\r\nDillon. There were also the Earl of Charlemont, the Earl of Bradford,\r\nLord Forbes, Lord Lucan, the Earl of Oxford, Lord Kinnaird, Lady\r\nAldborough (who remained till after Waterloo), the Marquis and\r\nMarchioness of Lansdowne, the Marquis of Downshire, Lord Ilchester,\r\nLord Hill, the Marquis and Marchioness of Bath, the Earl and Countess\r\nof Hardwicke, Lord and Lady Coventry, the Duke and Duchess of Richmond,\r\nLord Binning (afterwards Earl of Haddington), Lord Compton, the Marquis\r\nof Exeter, Lord and Lady Ranelagh, the Duke of Portland, Lord Gosford,\r\nLord Trimleston, the Earl and Countess Darnley, the Duke of Devonshire,\r\nhis stepmother, Lord and Lady Morpeth, Lord Geo. Leveson-Gower, Sir\r\nJohn Sebright, M.P. for Hertfordshire, Lord Sunderland, grandson of\r\nthe Duke of Marlborough, Sir John and Lady Stepney, Lady Augusta\r\nCotton, Lord and Lady Holland, the Earl of Clare, Lord Carington, Lord\r\nBrownlow, Lady Bentinck, the notorious Lady Hamilton, the aged Duchess\r\nof Melfort with her son, the Marquis of Aylesbury, Lord Miltown,\r\nwho, paralysed in his legs from childhood, went about in a chair,\r\nWilliam Henry (afterwards Lord) Lyttelton, Lord Burghersh (as Earl of\r\nWestmorland he became a diplomatist), Lord Apsley, son and heir of\r\nEarl Bathurst, the Earl of Essex,[276] Sir John and Lady Knatchbull,\r\nSir W. Clayton, Bagot (afterwards Sir Charles), and the Marquis of\r\nClanricarde, who married Canning’s daughter, was famous for gymnastic\r\nfeats, and was afterwards Ambassador to Russia, Postmaster-General,\r\nand Lord Privy Seal. Edward John Littleton, M.P. for Staffordshire,\r\na classical scholar, was accompanied by his handsome wife, Hyacinth\r\nMary, natural daughter of the Marquis Wellesley, but recognised by the\r\nWellesley family. Lady Priscilla Wellesley, daughter of the Earl of\r\nMornington, another but legitimate niece of Wellington, just of age\r\nand destined to be Lady Burghersh and Countess of Westmorland, was in\r\ntime to see d’Artois enter Paris. She survived till 1879.[277] Lord\r\nFitzroy Somerset, son of the Duke of Beaufort, in 1852 became Lord\r\nRaglan and was destined to die before Sebastapol. He married in August\r\n1814 Wellington’s other favourite niece, Lady Emily Wellesley. The Earl\r\nof Harrowby was accompanied by Wellesley Pole and Gerald Wellesley,\r\nson of Sir Henry and afterwards Prebendary of Durham. Lord Aberdeen,\r\nAmbassador at Vienna, who had accompanied the Austrian army in its\r\nmarch into France, was one of the English diplomatists who signed the\r\nTreaty of Paris of May 1814. John William Ward, afterwards Viscount\r\nand Earl of Dudley, a contributor to the _Quarterly_ and M.P. for\r\nIlchester, was also in Paris on his way to Italy. He rated Napoleon\r\nabove Alexander and Cæsar. Ward’s travelling companion from Calais was\r\nGeneral Montagu Mathew, M.P. for Tipperary, brother of the Earl of\r\nLandaff and a strenuous advocate of Catholic Emancipation. Thompson,\r\nM.P. for Midhurst--it is not clear whether he was the ex-M.P. for\r\nEvesham, a captive in 1803--was second on the 9th February 1815 in a\r\nbloodless duel between Colonels Quentin and Palmer, the latter firing\r\nin the air after his antagonist had fired and missed.\r\n\r\nWe should not omit among the visitors Anne Perry, the wife of James\r\nPerry of the _Morning Chronicle_. Perry himself had spent a year\r\nin Paris in 1792, sending of course letters to his paper, and he may be\r\nregarded as the earliest of Paris correspondents. He had, moreover, for\r\nthe previous twelve months obtained the services of a French barrister\r\nnamed Sanchamau, the translator of several English works. Sanchamau\r\nat first found a seat on sufferance in the Assembly, in the gallery\r\nallotted to the _suppléants_, that is to say, the men destined\r\nto fill up vacancies from death or other causes; but he applied on\r\nthe 22nd January 1792 for a permanent seat in the new journalists’\r\ngallery.[278] To return to Perry’s wife, she was captured by Algerian\r\npirates on her way home from Lisbon, and although soon released,\r\ncaptivity and seventeen weeks of a boisterous sea aggravated her\r\nalready precarious health. She expired at Bordeaux in February 1815, at\r\nthe age of thirty-eight. We do not hear whether her husband attended\r\nher deathbed.\r\n\r\nEven London shopkeepers went over for a week. John Scott, editor of\r\nthe _Champion_, encountered one full of anti-French prejudices,\r\nignorant of the language, unprovided even with a passport, and equipped\r\nonly with Bank of England notes.[279]\r\n\r\nTo accommodate the visitors, an Anglican service was held in a chapel\r\nof the Protestant Oratoire, probably the upper room which was hired\r\nfrom about 1860 to 1885 by the Church of Scotland, and _Galignani’s\r\nMessenger_ was started, an edition of which, after Waterloo and\r\nduring the stay of the British garrison, was published at Cambrai.\r\n\r\n‘The English at that time,’ says Madame de Chastenay, ‘almost did us\r\nthe honours of Paris’; that is to say, they seemed hosts rather than\r\nguests, and after the first ball both sexes discarded their eccentric\r\ncostumes. Yet they did not find themselves altogether welcome. The\r\nmiddle classes feared an English monopoly of trade, returned prisoners\r\ntold stories of ill-treatment in England, and the populace resented the\r\narrogance of conquerors. Miss Anne Carter must have been strangely\r\nmistaken in writing to her sister, ‘It is impossible to describe the\r\nenthusiasm with which we are everywhere received as English.’[280]\r\nThomas Campbell, on the other hand, had been hooted at Dieppe, which\r\nhe found incensed against the English, yet he does not speak of any\r\nincivility in Paris, where he danced attendance for nearly two months\r\non Mrs. Siddons.[281]\r\n\r\nA confidential police bulletin of the 17th October 1814 says:--\r\n\r\n   ‘The attention of the police has been called to the multitude\r\n   of English who inundate Paris, and whose obscure station\r\n   occasions uneasiness as to their destination and intentions.\r\n   It is remembered on this point that after the Treaty of Amiens\r\n   the French Government made an official complaint that the\r\n   London police had vomited (_sic_) six or seven hundred\r\n   persons, the scum of England, who secretly influenced trade,\r\n   public opinion, and police. We see collected here a number\r\n   of disreputable people who appear to be without means of\r\n   subsistence, and whose arrival from England seems an enigma.’\r\n\r\nAgain on the 4th November:--\r\n\r\n   ‘It is positively stated that on Saturday last Lord Wellington\r\n   complained to the King of the mortification and ill-treatment\r\n   which various Englishmen have experienced and are daily\r\n   experiencing in Paris, as well as of the lack of supervision\r\n   shown by the French authorities in putting an end to these\r\n   dangerous aggressions. It is a fact that at the Café Tortoni,\r\n   the Opera, the restaurants, and in other public places,\r\n   Englishmen are constantly affronted. These disorders are\r\n   attributed to a troop of half-pay officers or to some turbulent\r\n   men discharged from the Guard of Honour. It seems certain,\r\n   moreover, that Lord Wellington has expressly enjoined the\r\n   English who are in Paris to behave very circumspectly, and not\r\n   to notice provocations which might disturb the harmony necessary\r\n   between the two nations.’\r\n\r\nAnd on 19th December:--\r\n\r\n   ‘Every day there are fresh occasions of remarking the hatred of\r\n   the Parisians for the English. Yesterday at the Salon the most\r\n   violent language was used respecting them, and that to their\r\n   faces.’\r\n\r\nIn flat contradiction, however, to the police bulletins, Wansey\r\ndescribes the Parisians as glad to see English visitors once more\r\namongst them.[282] The British milord was good-naturedly burlesqued,\r\nas Weston tells us, in a farce called _La Route de Paris_. A\r\nprovincial innkeeper welcomes milord and miladi. His bad French and her\r\nveil excite amusement. The lord asks for beefsteak for dinner. The lady\r\nis enchanted with everything. The lord cries ‘God dem, vive la paix,’\r\nwhile the lady remarks that French and English have always been near\r\nenough to shake hands. The landlord rejoices that the lily after twenty\r\nyears’ preservation in an English conservatory is as flourishing as\r\never. Birkbeck, moreover, testifies to the welcome given to Englishmen\r\nat Montpellier, which he attributed to the kindness shown to French\r\nprisoners in England. Yet Haydon relates that on the performance of\r\nDucis’ _Hamlet_ at the Comédie Française, the whole pit rose and\r\napplauded a line against England, shouting ‘Bravo, à bas les Anglais,’\r\nand pointing to the English present.\r\n\r\nIf the French authorities looked askance on English visitors, it is but\r\nfair to say that some of the latter sympathised with Napoleon. Lord and\r\nLady Holland were doubtless among them, for Lord Holland subsequently\r\nprotested against the transportation to St. Helena, and Lady Holland,\r\nas already stated, forwarded books thither to the captive. They were\r\nnot likely, when in Paris, to parade their anti-Bourbon sentiments,\r\nbut Hervey Montmorency Morris was less scrupulous. He, on the 19th\r\nApril 1814, presented his newly born infant at the mairie of the tenth\r\narrondissement, and gave its name as Napoleon.[283] A young Irishman\r\nnamed Charles Honoré Lyster, describing himself as a student, a few\r\nmonths later landed at Toulon from Elba, and the authorities very\r\nnaturally ordered him to be watched. Lord Oxford’s papers, moreover,\r\nwere seized, and Wellington acknowledged that this was justified by\r\nhis conduct and conversation, and by the Bonapartist correspondence of\r\nwhich he had taken charge.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of Wellington, but it should be stated that the Embassy\r\nwas at first filled by Sir Charles Stuart, afterwards Lord Stuart de\r\nRothesay. He presented his credentials to Louis XVIII. on the\r\n22nd June, but was soon transferred to The Hague. Wellington arrived\r\nwith his troops from Spain on the 7th May, but went back to Madrid to\r\nsee the Spanish dynasty restored, returned to England to take his seat\r\nin the Lords as Duke, and was then appointed ambassador. He presented\r\nhis credentials on the 24th August, but with much greater pomp than\r\nStuart. Three royal carriages, each drawn by eight horses, escorted\r\nfrom the Embassy his three carriages, each drawn by six horses. He was\r\naccompanied by Major Fremantle and Major Percy. On reaching the foot\r\nof the throne he made a profound reverence, whereupon the King rose,\r\nthen sat down again, putting on his hat and motioning to Wellington and\r\nthe princes of the blood to cover also. The crowd murmured at these\r\nhonours, though they were also accorded to all the other ambassadors,\r\nwhile the ultra-royalists professed indignation at the Duke’s fixing\r\na ball in honour of Queen Charlotte’s birthday for the 18th January\r\n1814, as being a date too close to the 21st, the anniversary of Louis\r\nXVI.’s execution. They were also suspicious of his intimacy\r\nwith the Duke of Orleans. He paid a visit to the Abbé Sicard’s deaf\r\nand dumb boys, who were not, however, dumb, for they articulated\r\n‘Vive notre bon roi Louis XVIII.!’ The Duchess of Wellington\r\nwas presented by the King with a Sèvres dinner-service. The British\r\nGovernment was very uneasy lest Wellington should be ‘kidnapped’--an\r\neuphemism for being murdered--in some military rising. Anxious,\r\ntherefore, for him to leave, its first idea was to send him to America\r\nto command in the short war with the United States. He himself,\r\nhowever, wished to remain in Paris, thinking that his departure\r\nwould weaken Louis XVIII. A mission to the Vienna Congress\r\nhe considered a poor pretext, but the Government persisted, though\r\nallowing him to choose his own time for departure. General Macaulay\r\nmeanwhile went back to London with alarming reports. Wellington,\r\nwriting to Lord Liverpool on the 23rd October, said:--\r\n\r\n   ‘It appears to me that Macaulay considers the danger of a revolt\r\n   more certain and more likely to occur than I do, that is to say,\r\n   he believes it certainly will occur within a very short period\r\n   of time. I think it may occur any night, but I know of no fact\r\n   to induce me to believe it is near, excepting the general one\r\n   of great discontent and almost desperation among a very daring\r\n   class of men.’\r\n\r\nMacaulay feared that the royal family would be massacred and Wellington\r\n‘detained.’ Wellington stayed, however, till the 22nd January.\r\nMeanwhile he was besieged with all sorts of applications. Hervey\r\nMontmorency Morris asked permission to return to Ireland, promising\r\nto be a loyal subject. Wellington demurred, suggesting that in spite\r\nof his good intentions he would fall back into the company of his old\r\nassociates through the disinclination of loyalists to associate with\r\nhim. Morris accordingly remained in the French army, was naturalised in\r\nNovember 1816, and remained in France till his death in 1839.\r\n\r\nA man designating himself representative of De Beaune, who in 1790\r\nnegotiated a loan for the three English royal dukes, also called on\r\nWellington. He stated that the bondholders were pressing him for\r\npayment of the principal and of the twenty years’ arrears of interest.\r\nWellington forwarded his documents to London, but nothing more is\r\nheard of the affair. Impey was there again on the same errand as in\r\n1802, and Long, ex-president of the Irish College, went over to seek\r\nrestitution; but these claims all stood over till after the Hundred\r\nDays. The Scottish College, however, was restored to its owners, and on\r\nthe 13th December Robertson, bishop-coadjutor of Dublin and inventor\r\nof a process of embossing books for the blind, solemnised a _Te\r\nDeum_ there in the presence of numerous British ecclesiastics.\r\nQuintin Craufurd likewise sent in a statement of British claims to\r\ncompensation, and he obtained the restitution of eighty pictures,\r\nengravings, and sculptures confiscated in 1792.\r\n\r\nWellington received directions to prevent Princess Caroline from\r\nrepairing from Strasburg to Paris, though his own opinion was that she\r\nmight safely have been permitted to amuse herself. Louis XVIII., out of\r\nconsideration for the Prince Regent, had resolved not to receive her.\r\nShe nevertheless in October paid an incognito visit.\r\n\r\nBut few of the English visitors could have been in time to see the\r\nTsar, with his sons Constantine and Nicholas, the Emperor of Austria,\r\nand the King of Prussia, with his two sons, one of them the future\r\nWilliam I., destined to re-enter Paris as a conqueror in 1871,\r\nfor their stay was very short. The Russian and Prussian sovereigns\r\nwent on to England in June, while the Austrian Emperor pleaded Italian\r\naffairs as preventing him from also going. The brilliant uniforms\r\nof their officers, however, continued to enliven the streets of the\r\ncapital. Louis had pressed the Prince Regent to come over, telling\r\nhim that the three monarchs seconded the invitation, but the Prince,\r\n‘fat, fair, and forty,’ or rather, as Leigh Hunt had been imprisoned\r\nfor describing him, ‘an Adonis of fifty,’ probably shrank from the\r\nfatigue of the journey, or possibly he was not too confident of the\r\nstability of the restored dynasty. He made the excuse that a Regency\r\nAct would be necessary if he left his realm, yet his ancestors had paid\r\nvisits to Hanover. His subjects were of course eager to be presented at\r\nCourt. Shepherd speaks of Louis as ‘uncomfortably corpulent and seemed\r\nvery infirm in his feet, but his countenance is extremely pleasing,\r\nand if any reliance is to be placed on physiognomy, he is a man of a\r\nvery benevolent disposition.’[284] Shepherd went in clerical costume,\r\nfancying that this would be sufficient, but Stuart telling him the\r\ncontrary, he had to hurry off to a tailor to get properly equipped.\r\n\r\nDr. Williams presented the King with portraits of George III.\r\nand the Prince Regent, ‘two princes to whom,’ Louis said, ‘he had vowed\r\nthe most faithful remembrance.’ Sir Herbert Croft presented to him\r\nverses addressed to the Duchess of Angoulême. Galignani, who, though\r\nan Italian ex-priest, may be considered an Englishman by marriage\r\nand adoption, presented thirty volumes of his English reprints, his\r\n_Paris Guide_, and his _Modern Spectator_. Street, editor and\r\npart proprietor of the _Courier_, also had an audience, and was\r\ncomplimented on his journal’s ten years’ advocacy of the cause of the\r\nBourbons.[285]\r\n\r\nThose visitors who were not presented at Court had an opportunity\r\nof seeing the King on his way to chapel. Haydon, who describes him\r\nas ‘keen, fat, and eagle-eyed,’ joined in shouting ‘Vive le roi!’\r\nHe remarked that Napoleon’s initials still dotted the vestibule of\r\nthe chapel. The Duke of Rutland also remarked that the draperies of\r\nthe Tuileries were dotted with bees, and that ‘N’ or an eagle was\r\nvisible on all the furniture. This was a perpetual reminder to the\r\nBourbons of the dethroned ruler. But few of these emblems appear\r\nto have been at first effaced in Paris, lest this should provoke\r\ncounter-demonstrations, though provincial authorities displayed more\r\nzeal and less tact. Yet Stephen Weston speaks of thousands of workmen\r\nbeing employed in removing them, and Birkbeck observed men busily\r\neffacing Napoleon’s name and eagles from public buildings, which he\r\nthought very pitiful, while Scott noticed ingenious attempts to turn\r\n‘N’ into ‘L’ or ‘H’ in honour of Louis XVIII. or Henri IV. He also\r\nspeaks of a sign ‘Café de l’Empereur’ being converted into ‘Café des\r\nEmpereurs’ in honour of the Russian and Austrian monarchs.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st January, the anniversary of Louis XVI.’s execution, there\r\nwas an imposing procession on the transfer of his and his Queen’s\r\nremains to St. Denis, and requiem masses were celebrated all over\r\nFrance, the Protestant pastors Monod and Marron also holding services,\r\nalbeit the latter had flattered Napoleon. These masses were ordered\r\nto be annual, but were never repeated. There were other spectacles.\r\nThere was the proclamation of peace by a herald on the 1st June with\r\nall the revived formalities of the old Monarchy. The spoils of Italian\r\nart, including the Venetian horses, still embellished Paris, though\r\ndestined to removal as a punishment for the Hundred Days. Sunday and\r\nfestival observance was enforced on shops and factories, by a decree\r\nof the Prefect of Police on the 7th June. The host, for the first time\r\nsince the Revolution, was carried through the streets on Corpus Christi\r\nday, all houses on the route having to be draped, and bystanders being\r\nexpected, if not required, to uncover as it passed. The streets, says\r\nHaydon, were hung with tapestries, and altars were erected at various\r\npoints. It was the first Sunday since the Revolution that shops had\r\nbeen shut, yet the gaming-tables were open as usual. Parisians did\r\nnot fail to remark that these measures were decreed by a notorious\r\nsceptic, Beugnot. When Corpus Christi day came round again on the 25th\r\nMay 1815, Napoleon was once more on the throne. On the 29th August the\r\nKing paid a State visit to the Hotel de Ville, in honour of which Paris\r\nilluminated. The fountains in the Champs Elysées poured forth wine for\r\nall comers, and comestibles were also gratuitous.[286]\r\n\r\nThe London newspapers expressed distrust in the stability of the new\r\ngovernment, and doubtless on that account were prohibited admission to\r\nFrance. English officials seem to have shared this sentiment, for in\r\nJuly 1814 Admiral Mackenzie, who had brought over the Duc de Berri,\r\nsuddenly renounced his intended wintering in the south and recrossed\r\nthe Channel. Crabb Robinson remarked that when the King reviewed\r\nthe National Guard the cheers were very faint, and that there were\r\nsome cries of ‘Vive l’Empereur!’ Even the Rev. R. W. Wake, curate of\r\nMaidstone, who, having only a week’s holiday, went no further than\r\nCalais and Boulogne, was struck by the regret with which Napoleon’s\r\nfall was spoken of.[287] Yet some of the visitors descried no troubles\r\nahead. Wansey, who was in Paris in June, going thither by Dieppe and\r\nreturning by Boulogne, says:--\r\n\r\n   ‘That there are many dissatisfied with the new order of things,\r\n   particularly among the military, there is no doubt, and we may\r\n   expect to hear of partial insurrections and commotions among the\r\n   men returned from the wars.... But a Government that employs\r\n   men of such talents as those I have mentioned (Talleyrand,\r\n   Fouché, Louis, and Montesquiou) will not be easily overturned,\r\n   particularly as the leaders of the army are with the Court; and\r\n   as to the return of Napoleon, he ran the full length of his\r\n   tether. You will hear no more of his rule in France.’[288]\r\n\r\nJohn Scott, however, in the diligence between Dieppe and Paris, heard\r\nan officer with Napoleon’s portrait on his snuff-box say, in reply to\r\nEnglish expressions of satisfaction at the peace, ‘All very well, this\r\ntranquillity of Europe is a fine thing, but will it not keep me always\r\na captain?’ Another officer, though originally forced away from the\r\nstudy of medicine into the army, spoke with enthusiasm of Napoleon,\r\nand the mass of the people, while admitting Napoleon’s faults, were in\r\nScott’s judgment in his favour. ‘Ah but he was a great man!’ was the\r\ncommon phrase.\r\n\r\nRichard Boyle Bernard, M.P., son of the Earl of Bandon, remarked that\r\nLouis XVIII., passing on his way to mass, was repeatedly greeted\r\nwith cries of ‘Vive le roi!’ and he believed the most respectable\r\nportion of the nation to be loyal; but the number of discontented\r\nspirits would, he thought, necessitate prolonged vigilance. At Calais\r\ntheatre, moreover, on his way back in the autumn, Bernard heard a\r\npassage expressing satisfaction with the peace hissed by the officers\r\npresent.[289] He was struck, too, by the dislike felt in France for the\r\nEnglish, which was in striking contrast to their cordial welcome in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nWard, who saw Louis XVIII. enter Paris, remarked that the\r\napplause was neither long nor vehement, and that the Bourbons were\r\nreceived with cold acquiescence.[290]\r\n\r\nEustace, the Catholic priest, likewise gives no hint of another\r\noverturn, yet his visits of 1790 and 1802 should have taught him the\r\ninstability of French politics. Moreover, a sentry told him that\r\nthe Emperor had in ten years done more to embellish Paris than the\r\nBourbons in a century, and that had he reigned ten years longer he\r\nwould have made it the finest city in the world. Jones, chaplain on\r\nboard the _Blenheim_ at anchor off Marseilles, was more excusable\r\nin regarding the fall of Napoleon as definitive, yet the very parallel\r\nwhich he drew in his 29th May sermon between the English and the French\r\nRestoration might have reminded him that 1660 was reversed by 1688.\r\nWeston, however, was struck not by any feeling in favour of Napoleon,\r\nbut by the sarcasms heaped on him; and Shepherd, though he doubted the\r\nallegiance of the army, thought the mass of the people friendly to the\r\nBourbons. The smallest spark amid so much inflammable matter might,\r\nhe knew, produce an extensive conflagration. Some of the numerous\r\npamphlets on Napoleon which, pending the institution of a censorship,\r\nwere freely hawked in the streets, were the work of admirers, and the\r\nGrand Duke Constantine heard Louis XVIII. gravely reply,\r\nwhen the rest of the royal family had been disparaging Napoleon,\r\n‘Napoleon has done wonders for the glory and welfare of France, and\r\nif I can render her happy it will be by following the documents which\r\nhe has left. I should like to have as good a head as he whose chair\r\nI am occupying and whose table is serving me to write at, for I feel\r\nmyself inferior to him.’[291] But even pessimists, while apprehending a\r\nrevolution, had no fear of Napoleon’s return.\r\n\r\nReturn however he did, and those Englishmen who had visited him at\r\nElba cannot have been among the most startled. As early as the 29th\r\nJuly, less than three months after Napoleon’s arrival in his little\r\nrealm, General Spallannchi reported from Florence that some Englishmen\r\nhad gone out of curiosity to Elba but had returned in ill-humour, the\r\nfallen monarch having barely allowed them to see him and that only in\r\nhis garden. It seems from the statement of Vice-Consul Innes that the\r\nparty numbered seven, including one lady, and that after being kept\r\na long time waiting for an answer the garden interview was assigned\r\nthem for the next day. A Warwickshire man who had passed through\r\nParis and whose letter, intercepted by the Leghorn police, was signed\r\n‘Richard,’ evidently his Christian name, sailed from Leghorn with his\r\nsister on the 24th November, but was told that Napoleon refused to\r\nreceive curiosity-mongers. Not easily to be foiled, however, he made a\r\nsecond voyage and on alighting at an hotel at Porto Ferrajo on the 2nd\r\nDecember found covers laid for thirty Corsican functionaries in honour\r\nof the anniversary of Napoleon’s coronation in 1804. Such a celebration\r\ndid not argue renunciation of empire. On the following day he was\r\nallowed an audience, but nothing having been said about his sister he\r\nhad to leave her outside. Napoleon, whom he found standing in a small\r\nroom, advanced with an affable air and asked, ‘Where do you come from?’\r\n\r\n‘Warwickshire.’\r\n\r\n‘I do not remember the name.’\r\n\r\n‘It is in the very centre of England.’\r\n\r\n‘What is your occupation?’\r\n\r\n‘General commerce, but chiefly manufactures.’\r\n\r\n‘Do you find much custom in Italy?’\r\n\r\n‘Tolerable.’\r\n\r\n‘None in France, eh?’\r\n\r\n‘None at present, for want of a commercial treaty.’\r\n\r\n‘A commercial treaty would suit you?’\r\n\r\n‘Certainly, but I do not think we shall get it.’\r\n\r\n‘I did your commerce much mischief.’\r\n\r\n‘Not so much as was supposed. Our trade found outlets out of Europe\r\nwhich were very profitable.’\r\n\r\n‘The troubles in Spain will open up their colonies to you?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, but at first they will be jealously closed.’\r\n\r\n‘Your licence system was bad. It was semi-robbery.’\r\n\r\n   ‘This kind of conversation’ (says Richard), ‘lasted about an\r\n   hour, and then turned on France.... He asked me whether I was\r\n   in Paris during the Peace of Amiens. “Yes.” “You found it now\r\n   much altered?” “Yes, much larger than in 1802.” “It is a fine\r\n   city,” he added.... I took the opportunity of reminding him of\r\n   my sister, but he took no notice. He then conversed for a few\r\n   minutes, making altogether half an hour. On getting up to leave\r\n   he asked me to introduce my sister, whom he received with the\r\n   greatest affability, keeping up a conversation with her till a\r\n   carriage was heard coming, when he bowed and we retired.... He\r\n   frequently put his fingers into a small snuff-box, but did not\r\n   seem to take much notice of its contents. He asked me whether\r\n   I thought the Bourbons were really popular in France. He told\r\n   me he had found the heat more trying in Russia in the month of\r\n   August than in any other part of Europe, and he explained the\r\n   reason. I remarked evident signs of interest and inquisitiveness\r\n   when speaking of the Bourbons. He twice asked me whether they\r\n   were popular in France and what was said of them, and was not\r\n   satisfied with a vague reply.’[292]\r\n\r\nFrederick Douglas, M.P., son of Lord Glenbervie, on his way home from\r\nAthens had a courteous reception, which did not however prevent him\r\nfrom speaking and voting in 1815 for the renewal of the war.\r\n\r\n‘Why have you come?’ asked Napoleon.\r\n\r\n‘To see a great man.’\r\n\r\n‘Rather to see a wild beast,’ rejoined Napoleon, who inquired whether\r\nDouglas had seen Murat or the Pope. The latter, said Napoleon, ‘is an\r\nobstinately resigned old man. I did not treat him properly. I did not\r\ngo the right way to work with him.’ As to the state of France, Douglas\r\nreported that there was much enthusiasm for the Bourbons, though there\r\nwere a few malcontents. ‘Yes,’ remarked Napoleon, ‘people who belong\r\nto whatever party pays them and make much stir in order to get money.’\r\nNapoleon went on to complain of the treachery of his officers, of the\r\npamphleteers who styled him a usurper, of his brothers for not having\r\nseconded him, and of the sovereigns who had abandoned him. Douglas\r\nreported that he could no longer mount a horse, and that he had fallen\r\ninto profound apathy. Perhaps Napoleon intentionally gave him this\r\nerroneous impression, knowing that he was on his way to Paris, which he\r\nreached in January 1815.[293]\r\n\r\nLord William Bentinck, afterwards Viceroy of India, with a friend were\r\nsumptuously regaled, but we have no record of the conversation, and an\r\nEnglish lady ‘of angelical beauty,’ whom Pons does not name, but who\r\nmay have been Lady Jersey, for he says she showed the Emperor continued\r\nsympathy during the St. Helena captivity, was received with marked\r\nfavour. When, on her return to London, she saw the Russian and Prussian\r\nsovereigns pass by, she said to the fashionable gathering round her,\r\n‘Those men cannot seem imposing to persons who like me have had a close\r\nview of the Emperor Napoleon.’ Another visitor in September 1814 was\r\nJohn Barber Scott, of Bungay, Suffolk, ultimately a Fellow of Emmanuel\r\nCollege, Cambridge, but then a graduate twenty-two years of age, who\r\nwas accompanied by Major (Patrick?) Maxwell, R.A., Colonel (afterwards\r\nGeneral) John Lemoine, R. A., Captain Smith, and Colonel Niel Douglas.\r\n\r\nThey encountered Napoleon as he was out riding, and on their saluting\r\nhim he stopped for a few minutes to question them. They thought he\r\nlooked more like a crafty priest than a hero. On being told that Scott\r\nwas a Cantab he said, ‘What, Cambridge, Cambridge? Oh yes, you are a\r\nyoung man; you will be a lawyer. Eh, eh, you will be Lord Chancellor?’\r\nBeing told by Douglas that he belonged to a Highland regiment, Napoleon\r\nasked whether they did not wear kilts (_jupes_). On Douglas\r\nreplying in the affirmative, Napoleon asked whether he had brought his\r\nkilt with him, as he should like to see it, but Douglas was unable to\r\ngratify his curiosity.[294]\r\n\r\nEqually short, or even shorter, had been the interview of Sir Gilbert\r\nStarling and a Mr. Campbell.[295]\r\n\r\nOne visitor said he was as pleased to have spent nine days at Elba\r\nas if he had won £30,000. Napoleon, however, refused audiences to\r\nEnglishmen whom he suspected of simple curiosity or of exultation at\r\nhis fall.[296] When he went to Longone, the second town in the island,\r\nthere were numerous English visitors, and it was remarked to him that\r\nthey followed him wherever he went. He replied, ‘I am an object of\r\ncuriosity; let them satisfy themselves. They will go home and amuse the\r\ngentlemans (_sic_) by describing my acts and gestures.’ He added\r\nin a sad tone, ‘They have won the game; they hold the dice.’\r\n\r\nYet so far from showing him disrespect, Pons states that these sixty\r\nvisitors of all classes vied in extolling him. Pons also acknowledges\r\nthat Colonel Campbell, though deputed by his Government to watch\r\nNapoleon, veiled his supervision so carefully that only the closest\r\nobservation could detect it.[297]\r\n\r\nBut the principal visitor, and the only one invited to dinner, was\r\nLord Ebrington, afterwards Earl of Fortescue and in 1839–1841 Viceroy\r\nof Ireland. He first waited on the Emperor at 8 P.M. on the\r\n6th December, and for three hours walked up and down the room with\r\nhim. ‘You come from France; tell me frankly,’ said Napoleon, ‘whether\r\nthe French are satisfied.’ ‘Only so-so,’ replied Ebrington. ‘It cannot\r\nbe otherwise,’ rejoined Napoleon; ‘they have been too much humiliated\r\nby the peace. The appointment of the Duke of Wellington as Ambassador\r\nmust have seemed an insult to the army, as also the special attentions\r\nshown him by the King. If Lord Wellington had come to Paris as a\r\nvisitor, I should have had pleasure in showing him the attentions due\r\nto his great ability, but I should not have liked his being sent to me\r\nas Ambassador.’\r\n\r\nThe justice of this remark is obvious. Napoleon extolled the House of\r\nLords as the bulwark of the English constitution. He denounced the\r\nduplicity of the Emperor Alexander, expressed esteem for the Austrian\r\nEmperor, and spoke slightingly of the King of Prussia. ‘How should I\r\nbe treated,’ he asked Ebrington, ‘if I went to England? Should I be\r\nstoned?’ Ebrington replied that he would run no risk, and that the\r\nirritation formerly existing against him was daily dying out. ‘I think,\r\nhowever,’ rejoined Napoleon, ‘that there would be some danger from your\r\nmob’--he used the English word--‘at London.’\r\n\r\n‘The grace of his smile and the simplicity of his manner,’ says\r\nEbrington, ‘had put me quite at my ease. He himself appeared to wish\r\nme to question him. He replied without the least hesitation, with a\r\npromptitude and clearness which I have never seen equalled in any other\r\nman.’\r\n\r\nNext day, just as Ebrington was preparing to sail, came an invitation\r\nto dinner, and this second interview lasted from seven till eleven.\r\nNapoleon inquired for the Duke and Duchess of Bedford, Whitworth,\r\nErskine, and Holland, and spoke especially of Fox. Informed that Fox\r\nfelt much flattered at his reception in 1802, Napoleon said, ‘He had\r\nreason to be so. He was everywhere received like a divinity because\r\nhe was known to be in favour of peace.’ ‘Tell Lord Grenville,’ added\r\nNapoleon, ‘to come and see me. I wager that you in England thought me\r\na devil, but now that you have seen me and France also you must be\r\nsomewhat disabused.’ He justified the detentions of 1803. Ebrington,\r\nhowever, maintained that the embargo on French shipping in British\r\nports prior to the formal declaration of war was in accordance with\r\nprecedent, on which Napoleon replied, ‘Yes, you considered it right\r\nbecause it was to your advantage; other nations who lost by it thought\r\nit wrong. I am sure that at heart you in England approved me for\r\nshowing force of character. Do you not see that I am a bit of a pirate\r\nlike yourselves?’\r\n\r\nNapoleon half in earnest advocated polygamy, especially in the\r\ncolonies, where a planter might have a wife of each colour, so that the\r\ntwo families might grow up together harmoniously. He inquired for ‘my\r\ngood friend Ussher’--Captain, afterwards Sir Thomas Ussher--who had\r\nconveyed him to Elba.\r\n\r\nOn surprise being expressed by Ebrington at his calm endurance of\r\nadversity, Napoleon said, ‘It is because everybody was more surprised\r\nat it than myself. I have not too good an opinion of mankind, and\r\nhave always distrusted fortune. Moreover, I had little enjoyment. My\r\nbrothers were much more kings than I was. They tasted the sweets of\r\nroyalty, while I had only the worries and cares.’[298]\r\n\r\nLord John Russell, the future statesman, then twenty-three years of\r\nage, being taken by his father to Florence in the autumn of 1814,\r\nembraced the opportunity of visiting Elba. ‘When I saw Napoleon,’ he\r\nsays, ‘he was in evident anxiety respecting the state of France and his\r\nchances of again seizing the crown which he had worn for ten years. I\r\nwas so struck with his restless inquiry that I expressed in a letter\r\nto my brother in England my conviction that he would make some fresh\r\nattempts to disturb France and govern Europe.’[299]\r\n\r\nBut by far the most curious incident of Napoleon’s reign at Elba was\r\nhis presence at an entertainment in honour of George III.’s\r\nbirthday, given on the 4th June 1814 by Captain Tower on board\r\nthe frigate _Undaunted_. Napoleon, on reaching Fréjus after\r\nhis abdication in April, had embarked in the _Undaunted_ in\r\npreference to a French vessel assigned for his passage to Elba, and\r\nhad taken a fancy to the captain, Ussher. The _Undaunted_ went\r\nto and from Elba and Leghorn, and it might have celebrated the royal\r\nbirthday at the latter port. Napoleon afterwards thought that Colonel\r\n(ultimately Sir Neil) Campbell purposely planned the celebration at\r\nElba. When, however, Towers invited him to come on board, and sent\r\nround invitations to the principal inhabitants of Porto Ferrajo, he\r\nreadily accepted the invitation, and directed his courtiers, if such a\r\nphrase can be used, to do likewise. One of these, Pons de l’Hérault,\r\nto whom we are indebted for the fullest account of the festival--not\r\npublished, however, till 1897[300]--was inclined indeed to regard the\r\ninvitation as an insult and the festival as a bravado; but his master\r\ntold him that it was the duty of British sailors to observe their\r\nsovereign’s birthday wherever they might happen to be. A ‘throne,’\r\nsays Pons, had been prepared for the Emperor on the bridge; and he\r\ncontinues:--\r\n\r\n   ‘The Emperor arrived, and the ship’s officers received him at\r\n   the top of the ladder. Guns could not be fired, as they were\r\n   not mounted, but the crew, clustered on the rigging, gave him\r\n   three hearty cheers, and the Emperor looking up at them raised\r\n   his hat. He then passed to the quarter-deck. There all were\r\n   ranged in a circle, and the Emperor, as though quite at home,\r\n   his left hand as usual in his fob, put the trivial questions\r\n   which he nearly always employed on such occasions, for he did\r\n   not bother himself with finding remarks appropriate to each\r\n   particular individual. It was not his moment for parade. When\r\n   the circle had broken up the Emperor asked for an interpreter\r\n   and went to talk to the sailors, especially to a mate with whom\r\n   he had several times conversed during his passage from Fréjus\r\n   to the isle of Elba. The entire crew seemed eager to see him\r\n   again. The countenances of these good fellows expressed the very\r\n   contrary of the perversity of their Government. Captain Tower\r\n   sincerely admired the Emperor, and watched all his movements\r\n   with a gaze full of respect and interest. He had one of those\r\n   open countenances which inspire confidence. The Emperor said\r\n   to me ... “The English Government will never forgive me for\r\n   having been the most determined Frenchman in breaking down its\r\n   supremacy. Not that hatred actuated me, it was duty, it was love\r\n   of country.[301]\r\n\r\n   All well-bred Englishmen consequently honour me. If I went to\r\n   England the English Government would be afraid of my popularity\r\n   and would pack me off.” ... The same cheers accompanied the\r\n   Emperor on his departure, and he responded with the same\r\n   salute.’[302]\r\n\r\nPons, with his wife and children and the other guests, remained to\r\nthe dinner and ball. Unfortunately, two of the ship’s officers drank\r\na little too much, and so misbehaved themselves as to oblige several\r\nof the ladies to withdraw. It is pathetic to think that Napoleon’s\r\nnext and last acquaintance with British tars was when, thirteen months\r\nlater, he gave himself up to the _Bellerophon_, and was conveyed\r\nas a captive in the _Northumberland_ to St. Helena.\r\n\r\nOne Englishman at least was a spectator of Napoleon’s departure from\r\nElba. A Mr. Grattan (probably the father of Thomas Colley Grattan, the\r\ntraveller and novelist) had landed on the island on the 24th February.\r\nOn the evening of the 26th he noticed unusual bustle, as though\r\nsomething was about to happen, and at 9 P.M. he saw Napoleon, escorted\r\nby General Bertrand, come out in his sister Pauline’s four-horse\r\ncarriage, enter a boat, and go on board the brig _Inconstant_.\r\nThereupon the whole flotilla got under way, the soldiers shouting ‘Vive\r\nl’Empereur!’ Scarcely believing his eyes, Grattan hired a boat to go\r\nalongside the brig, and thence he saw Napoleon in his grey overcoat\r\nand round hat pacing the quarter-deck. One of the boatmen, however,\r\ncried out that there was an Englishman on board, upon which an officer\r\non the poop of the _Inconstant_ demanded who he was and what he\r\nwanted. Grattan had to explain that he had merely come to have a look\r\nat the Emperor, whereupon he was told to be off, and he complied with\r\nalacrity, expecting every instant to be fired at or arrested.[303]\r\n\r\nUp to the 20th March the _Moniteur_ had continued publishing loyal\r\naddresses to Louis XVIII., but on the 21st it announced, ‘The\r\nKing and the Princes left last night. His Majesty the Emperor arrived\r\nthis evening at eight o’clock in his palace of the Tuileries.’ One of\r\nNapoleon’s first inquiries to a lady of his court was whether there\r\nwere many English in Paris. On being told that nearly all had left\r\nhe exclaimed, ‘Ah, they recollect what I did before, but those times\r\nare past. You do not repeat yourself.’ John Cam Hobhouse, Byron’s\r\nfriend, afterwards Lord Broughton, tells us this, and he adds that\r\nthe detentions of 1802 were against French feeling and could not\r\nhave been repeated in 1815 in defiance of such a feeling. Napoleon,\r\nmoreover, may have thought there was a chance of his recognition by\r\nthe allies,[304] and the detention of foreigners would have been a\r\nvirtual declaration of war. Yet the stampede was obviously prudent,\r\nand the principal Englishman who remained did not escape molestation.\r\nFrancis Henry Egerton, as we have seen, had come over to Paris in\r\n1802, and he had apparently continued to reside uninterruptedly, for\r\nhe published several works there, both in English and French, between\r\n1812 and 1826. He had hired a house till 1814, but on the restoration\r\nof the Bourbons he purchased the mansion of the Noailles family in\r\nthe rue St. Honoré, and to show his sympathy with the new Government\r\nhe paid up at once, on the 2nd March 1815, in lieu of by instalments,\r\nthe stamp duty of 30,000 francs. This seems to have marked him out for\r\nNapoleon’s resentment. The house with its contents was requisitioned\r\nto serve for a Government office. Egerton resisted, stood a kind of\r\nsiege, and appealed to the tribunals. He could not, it is obvious, have\r\npermanently withstood Napoleon, but he seems to have held his ground\r\nuntil Waterloo arrived and put an end to the affair. He lost no time in\r\nsecuring legal domicile and civic rights, for in default of the latter\r\none alien could not bequeath property to another, such property being\r\nforfeit to the French Crown. His support of the Bourbons should have\r\nshielded him from further annoyance, but in 1818 he had an unpleasant\r\nepisode. Workmen who were placing flower-pots on the pillars of the\r\nTuileries gardens found it convenient to fasten ropes to the wall of\r\nhis back garden in the rue de Rivoli. Egerton drove out in his carriage\r\nand required them to desist. An altercation ensued, there were cries of\r\n‘Down with the Englishman!’ and he was dragged out of his carriage to\r\nthe guardhouse. Though promptly released, he was very punctilious in\r\nexacting an apology for this indignity, threatening otherwise to quit\r\nFrance. He was very eccentric in his latter years, if we are to believe\r\nthat cats and dogs dressed up as human beings sat at his dinner-table,\r\nand that he kept rabbits and partridges in his garden in order to have\r\nshooting on his own premises. He died as Duke of Bridgewater in 1829,\r\naged seventy-nine, and left £8000 for eight prize treatises which were\r\nnamed after him. The Hôtel St. James, into which his house has been\r\nconverted, contains the original staircase and other relics of the\r\nmansion in which Marie Antoinette welcomed Lafayette and Noailles on\r\ntheir return from America.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen who, like Egerton, remained or arrived during the Hundred\r\nDays witnessed curious scenes. Hobhouse in his passport of 1814 had\r\nseen the word _empire_ erased and _royaume_ substituted. He\r\nnow found a contrary change made. He saw Napoleon review the National\r\nGuard on the 16th April, and attend the Comédie Française on the\r\n21st, on both which occasions his reception was enthusiastic. He also\r\nwitnessed the ceremony on the Champ de Mars, when Napoleon closely\r\nscrutinised the crowd with his eyeglass during the mass on which he\r\nhad resolved in order to show that the Empire was not anti-catholic.\r\nHobhouse, though strenuously opposed to the renewal of the war by the\r\nallies, acknowledges that Napoleon was not popular in Paris except\r\nwith the military, and that the cheers were very faint. Yet he courted\r\npopularity by visiting public institutions and by walking about almost\r\nunattended and conversing with people of all classes. He removed on\r\nthe 17th April from the Tuileries, where, however, he still held his\r\ncouncils, to the Elysée, close to the Borghese palace which Wellington\r\nhad purchased for the British Embassy. The latter was of course\r\nvacant, for all the ambassadors had followed Louis XVIII. to\r\nGhent, Fitzroy Somerset assuring him previously to his flight that\r\nEngland would stand by him. In the absence of ambassadors foreigners\r\ncould not of course be formally presented, but Mrs. Damer obtained an\r\ninterview to give Napoleon the bust of Fox, which she had promised\r\nhim in 1802. The jewelled snuff-box bearing his own portrait which he\r\ngave her in return is now in the British Museum. Up to the 4th May,\r\nif not later, the Calais and Dover mail-packets continued to run, and\r\ntook many French passengers. When Corpus Christi festival arrived the\r\nprocessions, as from the Revolution till 1813 and as ever since, were\r\nconfined in Paris to the churches or their enclosures.\r\n\r\nNapoleon affected liberal views, not only by summoning Benjamin\r\nConstant to his councils, but by inviting to return to Paris his friend\r\nMadame de Staël, who had not joined in the exultation at his fall,\r\nand indeed had sent him warning to Elba, through his brother Joseph,\r\nof a plot against his life. She did not accept the invitation, but\r\nwrote to Quintin Craufurd a letter intended for transmission to the\r\nEnglish Government, in which she affirmed the sincerity of his liberal\r\nprofessions. Yet she might justly have distrusted these.\r\n\r\nAmong the Frenchmen who fled to England was one whose Irish extraction\r\nentitles him to mention. Jean Baptiste Lynch, whose Jacobite ancestors\r\nhad settled at Bordeaux, was imprisoned during the Revolution. In 1808\r\nNapoleon made him Mayor of Bordeaux, and in 1810 created him a Count.\r\nLynch was lavish in his professions of fidelity to the Empire, but in\r\n1813 he had secret dealings with a royalist emissary, and in 1814, on\r\nthe approach of Wellington’s army, he proclaimed Louis XVIII.\r\nat Bordeaux. He was the first man in France to do this, and he also\r\nsent a deputation to Louis in England. On hearing of Napoleon’s return\r\nfrom Elba and unopposed march on Paris, he despatched the Duchess of\r\nAngoulême to England to be out of his reach, and he himself followed\r\nher. He was at Newcastle on a visit to a relative when news of Waterloo\r\narrived, and he was cheered by the populace.[305] Louis, who in 1814\r\nhad awarded him the grand cross of the Legion of Honour, thus giving\r\nhim a Napoleonic decoration for deserting Napoleon, made him a peer. In\r\na letter written to a Bordeaux editor in 1816 Lynch urged the justice\r\nof Catholic emancipation, but deprecated Irish independence, and\r\nexpressed a wish to go and deliver loyalist speeches in Ireland, that\r\nhe might render service to his ancestral as he had done to his native\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nNo foreigners applied during the Hundred Days for domicile or\r\nnaturalisation, whereas previously Philip Dormer Stanhope had obtained\r\ndomicile,[306] as also James George Hartley, a law student, and\r\nnaturalisation had been accorded to two Irish officers in the French\r\nservice--Julius Terence O’Reilly and William Corbett.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th June Napoleon left for the frontier, and a period of\r\nsuspense followed. Hobhouse started on the following day for Geneva,\r\nbut found he could not pass through the armies, and accordingly\r\nreturned to Paris on the 28th. ‘I cannot help wishing,’ he says in his\r\nletters to Byron, which the _Quarterly_ characterised as ‘infamous\r\nlibels on the English name and character,’ ‘that the French may meet\r\nwith as much success as will not compromise the military character of\r\nmy own countrymen; but as an Englishman I cannot be witness of their\r\ntriumph; as a lover of liberty I would not be a spectator of their\r\nreverses.’ This was an utterance published after the event. Perhaps\r\nHobhouse at the time, like Byron, was nevertheless sorry to hear of\r\nWaterloo. He seems to have quitted Paris before the re-entry of Louis\r\nXVIII., but British residents like Helen Williams, Croft,\r\nCraufurd, and Egerton, witnessing the first fall of Napoleon, the\r\naccession of Louis, his flight, the arrival of Napoleon, his return\r\nfrom Waterloo, and the re-accession of Louis, beheld in the short space\r\nof fourteen months a series of vicissitudes unexampled in human annals.\r\n\r\nNo Englishman who saw Napoleon in Paris after Waterloo, if any such\r\nthere were, has left any record of it. It is obvious, indeed, that\r\nthe few Englishmen then in Paris would shun observation during those\r\ndays of suspense. An Englishwoman, daughter of one of the officers\r\ndetained in 1803 and herself born in captivity, may, however, have then\r\nseen him. In any case her husband, Legouvé, the Academician who died\r\nin March 1903, at the age of ninety-four, was in all probability the\r\nlast survivor of those who had seen Napoleon in Paris, for he was six\r\nyears of age in 1815. The last survivor who had mixed in his society\r\nat St. Helena was Madame Hortense Eugénie Thayer, daughter of General\r\nBertrand by Henrietta, daughter of General Arthur Dillon. This was one\r\nof Napoleon’s compulsory marriages, but Bertrand succeeded in gaining\r\nhis unwilling bride’s affection. Hortense, born at Paris in 1810, was\r\npresented by Napoleon at St. Helena with a pair of earrings, and he\r\nwitnessed the boring of her ears for this purpose, complimenting her on\r\nher composure during the operation. She married Amédée Thayer, a French\r\nSenator under the Second Empire, of American extraction. Dying in 1890,\r\nshe bequeathed to Prince Victor Bonaparte a red damask coat presented\r\nto her by Napoleon for a spencer to be made out of it, but preserved\r\nintact, together with other relics. We do not hear what became of the\r\nearrings. Her mother gave Napoleon lessons in English at St. Helena,\r\nand I subjoin a short article on this subject published by me in the\r\n_Atlantic Monthly_, November 1895:--\r\n\r\n   A recent exhibition of Napoleonic relics in Paris comprised,\r\n   among numerous specimens of handwriting--one of them the draft\r\n   abdication of Fontainebleau, another the draft ‘Themistocles’\r\n   letter to the Prince Regent--a lesson in translating French\r\n   into English. Pitying Napoleon as we must, though conscious\r\n   that captivity alone secured France and Europe against another\r\n   Hundred Days, his attempt to learn English is irresistibly\r\n   pathetic. We are reminded of Ovid learning to speak, and even\r\n   to versify, in Dacian, but Napoleon does not seem to have\r\n   mastered English sufficiently to be able to write in prose\r\n   without numerous mistakes. He had been acquainted from his\r\n   youth, by translations, with several English authors. He was\r\n   fond of Ossian, and a collection of thirty-four books, given\r\n   him by his sister Pauline to take with him to Egypt, included\r\n   Bacon’s Essays, in which he marked in pencil two passages:\r\n   one in the chapter Of Great Place, from the third sentence,\r\n   ‘It is a strange desire to seek power and to lose liberty,’\r\n   to the sentence preceding the lines from Seneca; the other in\r\n   the chapter Of Kingdoms and Estates, from ‘triumph amongst\r\n   the Romans’ to the end. Patronised by the younger Robespierre\r\n   and by Barras, he had already exemplified the saying, ‘By\r\n   indignities men come to dignities’; and he was destined also,\r\n   like Bacon himself, to find that ‘the standing is slipping, and\r\n   the regression is either a downfall or at least an eclipse.’ He\r\n   never, apparently, saw acted even an adaptation of Shakespeare,\r\n   yet on the eve of the rupture of the Treaty of Amiens he\r\n   surprised his Council of State by diverging from a coinage\r\n   question into a tirade against both Shakespeare and Milton.\r\n   Too busy, even if inclined, to study English, he would, had he\r\n   invaded England in 1803 and commissioned Sir Francis Burdett\r\n   to organise a republic, have taken with him one hundred and\r\n   seventeen interpreter guides, in red coats and white trousers--a\r\n   corps which he expected to recruit from Irish and other\r\n   refugees. One of these refugees, the notorious Lewis Goldsmith,\r\n   read the London newspapers for him. But Napoleon was not fated\r\n   to get nearer to English soil than William III.’s\r\n   landing-place, Torbay.\r\n\r\n   Captivity afforded him the requisite leisure and also a strong\r\n   inducement, for he was anxious, not to acquaint himself with\r\n   English literature, but to see what was said of himself in the\r\n   English press. Accordingly, on the six weeks’ voyage to St.\r\n   Helena, he took two lessons from Las Cases, who, when himself an\r\n   exile, had taught French and learned English in London. It seems\r\n   likely that he had acquired just a smattering before Waterloo,\r\n   if not before Elba; for while waiting at Balcombe House till\r\n   Longwood was ready for him, he occasionally spoke English\r\n   (desiring her to correct his mistakes) to the lively Betsy\r\n   Balcombe, that _enfant terrible_ who coolly questioned\r\n   him not only as to his supposed atheism, but as to the ‘happy\r\n   dispatch’ of the wounded French at Jaffa and as to the execution\r\n   of the Duc d’Enghien. He sent, moreover, for some English books,\r\n   one of them an edition of Æsop, and, pointing to the picture\r\n   of the ass kicking the sick lion, he remarked in English, ‘It\r\n   is me (_sic_) and your governor’ (Sir Hudson Lowe). His\r\n   accent then, and probably to the last, was very peculiar, and\r\n   he usually talked and joked with Betsy in French, though her\r\n   French was not of the best. He got her to translate to him Dr.\r\n   Warden’s account of the voyage of the _Northumberland_.\r\n   Though addicted to teasing, he had so won her affection that\r\n   she shed many tears on quitting the island, where, according\r\n   to a recent French visitor, the recollections of Napoleon have\r\n   been effaced by a wild-beast show, a visitor quite as rare as an\r\n   imperial captive. When settled at Longwood, Napoleon resolved\r\n   on seriously renewing the study. Las Cases gave him a daily\r\n   lesson; sometimes finding him a diligent scholar, at other\r\n   times so inattentive that Napoleon would himself laughingly\r\n   ask his teacher whether he did not deserve the rod, regarded\r\n   by him as an essential adjunct to education. He even wrote\r\n   several letters in English to Las Cases, but the irregular verbs\r\n   overtaxed his patience. He managed, however, to read after a\r\n   fashion, and, according to Las Cases, might at a push have made\r\n   himself understood in writing; but it does not appear that\r\n   the lessons went on more than a few weeks. They had probably\r\n   ceased long before December 1816, when Las Cases had to quit the\r\n   island. A scrap of paper, presented by him to a friend, and also\r\n   included in the exhibition, is the only trace of these lessons.\r\n   We read on it, in his pupil’s handwriting: ‘Gone out, _aller\r\n   dehors_, _sortir_. Opened, _ouvert_. To see,\r\n   _voire_ (_sic_), _regarder_.’\r\n\r\n   Napoleon’s next professor, after how long an interval we cannot\r\n   tell, was Countess Bertrand, daughter of General Arthur Dillon\r\n   by Anne Laure Girardin, cousin to the Empress Josephine. She had\r\n   never even visited England, but her father, guillotined when\r\n   she was eight years of age, had probably taught her his native\r\n   tongue. Napoleon, disposing of rich heiresses with Oriental\r\n   despotism, had required her to marry Bertrand, one of his\r\n   generals; and though the poor girl was at first in despair and\r\n   refused to see her suitor, she speedily became attached to him,\r\n   and they lived happily ever after. One of their children, named\r\n   Arthur, not, as one of the St. Helena narratives states, after\r\n   the Duke of Wellington, but after the grandfather--was born on\r\n   the island in January 1817, and archly introduced by the mother\r\n   to Napoleon as ‘the first Frenchman who had entered Longwood\r\n   without a pass from Sir Hudson Lowe.’ She was extremely fond\r\n   of society, and though, with her husband, she had accompanied\r\n   the Emperor to Elba, she was so averse to St. Helena that she\r\n   stormed at Napoleon for involving Bertrand and his family in his\r\n   banishment, and even tried to throw herself overboard. This,\r\n   unlike some of her other antipathies, she never overcame, and\r\n   at the time of Napoleon’s death she was arranging for a return\r\n   to France, on the plea of getting her children educated. One\r\n   of those children, whose ears were bored in Napoleon’s presence\r\n   that he might present her with earrings, survived, as Madame\r\n   Thayer, widow of one of Napoleon III.’s senators, till\r\n   1890. Madame Bertrand, apparently, gave a specimen of Napoleon’s\r\n   lessons to Madame Junot, whose granddaughter, Madame de la\r\n   Ferrière, lent it to the recent exhibition. A sheet of letter\r\n   paper, yellow with age, contains alternate lines of French and\r\n   English; but it will be more convenient to give first the theme,\r\n   and then the translation, which has never yet been published.\r\n   The italics in brackets indicate the erasures.\r\n\r\n   ‘Quand serez-vous sage?\r\n\r\n   ‘Quand je ne serai plus dans cette île. Mais je le deviendrai\r\n   après avoir passé la ligne.\r\n\r\n   ‘Lorsque je débarquerai en france, je serai très content. Ma\r\n   femme viendra près de moi, mon fils sera grand et fort, il\r\n   pourra boire sa bouteille de vin à dîner, je trinquerai avec\r\n   lui. Ma mère sera vieille, mes sœurs seront laides, ce qui ne\r\n   leur sera pas agréable, elles seront _toujours_ coquettes,\r\n   car les femmes se croient toujours jolies.’\r\n\r\n   ‘When will you be wise?\r\n\r\n   ‘Never [_then that_] as long as I [_should_] could\r\n   be in this isle, but I shall become vise after [_have_]\r\n   having passed the line. When I shall [_landed_] land in\r\n   france I shall be very content. Mi [_wive_] wife shall\r\n   come [_after_, _bef_-] near me. Mi son shall be great\r\n   and [_fort_] strong. He [_shall get_] will be able to\r\n   take his bottle of wine at dinner. I shall trink with him. Mi\r\n   mother shall be olde, mi sisters shall ... for the women believe\r\n   they....’\r\n\r\n   The pronoun _I_ is uniformly written _j_. The\r\n   corrections are mostly inserted above the line, but some are\r\n   a continuation of the line, showing that the translation was\r\n   written in Madame Bertrand’s presence. The first sentence, it\r\n   is evident, had been playfully uttered by her on account of\r\n   Napoleon’s teasing her for being boisterously gay; for it is\r\n   the question addressed to obstreperous or fretful children,\r\n   and Napoleon himself used to say to Betsy Balcombe, ‘Quand\r\n   seras-tu sage?’ _Sage_ does not here mean wise, but good\r\n   or well behaved. Madame Bertrand passed over this and some\r\n   other obvious blunders, either because her own English was\r\n   defective, or because she would not discourage her pupil by too\r\n   many corrections. At one corner of the sheet is a rude drawing\r\n   of a ship, the imaginary ship in which Napoleon was to return\r\n   to France, and in another corner is a sketch apparently meant\r\n   for a line of muskets extended for firing. There are also the\r\n   words, ‘Qui vous a apporté cette lettre? (Who has brought you\r\n   this letter?) The writing is small and cramped, but fairly\r\n   legible; much more so than other specimens at the exhibition,\r\n   such as the audit of Napoleon’s accounts. The allegation that he\r\n   wrote a scrawl to conceal his bad spelling seems far-fetched.\r\n   Like many people, he had a hasty scrawl for drafts, which he was\r\n   sometimes himself unable to decipher, and a plainer hand for his\r\n   correspondents.\r\n\r\nTo quote from Manzoni’s famous ode:--\r\n\r\n    ‘He vanished, in a narrow isle\r\n    His vacant days to keep,\r\n    Object of boundless envy once,\r\n    Now of compassion deep,\r\n    Of inextinguishable ire\r\n    And of unconquered love.’\r\n\r\nThere still survive two English witnesses of Napoleon’s funeral, for\r\n_Public Opinion_ of the 28th March 1903 contained a letter from\r\nMr. G. B. Bennett of Cape Town, who states that he was born at St.\r\nHelena on the 30th November 1816, that he attended the funeral, and\r\nthat his sister, three and a half months old, was also present in her\r\nnurse’s arms.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Sir Hudson Lowe, born at St. Helena in 1818, is also\r\nstill living, unmarried, at Balham, near London. Considering, however,\r\nthe strained relations between her father and Napoleon, she is scarcely\r\nlikely, in her nurse’s arms, to have seen the caged lion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_PS._--Miss Clara Lowe died at Tooting on the 7th May 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _A_ (see p. 34)\r\n\r\n                         MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n    _Asterisks indicate members not re-elected in 1802, and italics\r\n                             new members._\r\n\r\n    Acheson, Arch., Armagh.\r\n\r\n    Adair, Robert, Camelford.\r\n\r\n    _Barclay, Sir Robert_, Newton, Hants.\r\n\r\n    Baring, Sir F., Chipping Wycombe.\r\n\r\n    *Benfield, Paul, Shaftesbury.\r\n\r\n    _Best, Wm.

Rollo Russell with a copy, and\r\npermission to publish it, of the letter addressed in 1868 by his\r\nfather, Earl Russell, to the eminent Belgian statesman, M. Van de\r\nWeyer. A few copies were then printed for private distribution.\r\n\r\n                                   PEMBROKE LODGE: _Nov. 28, 1868_.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR VAN DE WEYER,\r\n\r\n   You wish to have some account of my visit to the First Napoleon\r\n   at Elba.\r\n\r\n   It is long since I paid that visit, and I can give you only\r\n   glimmering recollections.\r\n\r\n   I was at Florence in December 1814, with my father and his\r\n   family.\r\n\r\n   I wished very much to see Napoleon; some of my friends had been\r\n   to Elba; a cousin of mine by marriage, Mr. Whitmore, was going\r\n   there.\r\n\r\n   I was told that the season was bad, and that I should do well to\r\n   put off my journey till the spring. But I determined to go then.\r\n\r\n   Colonel Campbell, the Commissioner of the British Government,\r\n   was usually resident at Florence; he was then returning to Elba,\r\n   and a brig-of-war had been placed at his disposal. I was glad to\r\n   take advantage of the opportunity. He told us on the way that\r\n   Napoleon had sate up late at night, revising the list of the\r\n   Municipal Council of Porto Ferrajo for the ensuing year. Colonel\r\n   Campbell seemed to consider this circumstance a proof that the\r\n   deposed Emperor could be as busy upon a trifling affair as on\r\n   the destinies of Europe. But no doubt Napoleon wished to have a\r\n   municipality on whom he could rely in case of need.\r\n\r\n   The first person Whitmore and I saw at Porto Ferrajo was General\r\n   Bertrand, and he introduced us to his wife, a Dillon by birth.\r\n\r\n   In conversation with General Bertrand, he asked us the meaning\r\n   of a paragraph in the _Courier_ newspaper, sent him by\r\n   Colonel Campbell, to the effect that the Congress of Vienna had\r\n   it in contemplation to send the Emperor to St. Helena. We had\r\n   not seen the paragraph, and could not account for it. I have\r\n   never referred to the _Courier_ newspaper of that period\r\n   to ascertain its wording, or guess at its origin. But it had\r\n   evidently made a great impression on General Bertrand.\r\n\r\n   In the evening of that day, about eight o’clock, I went to the\r\n   house at the top of the town where Napoleon resided. He received\r\n   me in his drawing-room. He was dressed in uniform--a green coat,\r\n   single-breasted, white breeches, and silk stockings. I was much\r\n   struck with his countenance--eyes of a muddy colour and cunning\r\n   expression; the fine features which we all know in his bust and\r\n   on his coins; and, lastly, a most agreeable and winning smile.\r\n   He was very courteous in his manner. I was with him for a long\r\n   time--I think an hour and a half. He stood the whole time, only\r\n   sometimes leaning on the chimney-piece.\r\n\r\n   What struck me most in his conversation was a certain uneasiness\r\n   about his position--a suspicion that something serious was about\r\n   to happen to him, and he seemed to have a desire to entrap me\r\n   into giving him information which I was neither able nor willing\r\n   to afford. With this view, as I supposed, he asked me a number\r\n   of questions of little interest to him--such as, whether I was\r\n   in the House of Commons or the House of Lords, whether my father\r\n   had kept up much state as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and\r\n   whether the Lady-Lieutenant had any _dame d’honneur_ in her\r\n   suite? When I replied that she had only a young lady, who was\r\n   her cousin, in the house with her, he remarked, ‘_C’était une\r\n   dame de compagnie, pas une dame d’honneur_.’ These questions\r\n   he would intersperse with eager enquiries respecting the state\r\n   of France; and when I replied that I had not come through\r\n   France, but by sea from Portugal, he would not let me off, but\r\n   asked me what Lord Holland, whom I had seen at Florence, thought\r\n   of French opinion--enquiring, with much emphasis, ‘_L’armée\r\n   est-elle contente?_’\r\n\r\n   He spoke also of Italy; and when I said that Italy had no union,\r\n   and therefore would probably remain quiet, he said, ‘_C’est\r\n   vrai_.’ I told him that I had heard everywhere, that during\r\n   his reign the robberies and pillage, which had been so common\r\n   before, had almost ceased; he said quickly, ‘_C’était la\r\n   gendarmerie_.’\r\n\r\n   He seemed alarmed regarding his own safety, asking me, more than\r\n   once, whether our Minister at Florence was a man to be trusted;\r\n   whether fearing that he might be carried off by force, or\r\n   wishing to obtain some assurance of safety and protection from\r\n   Lord Burghersh, the British Minister, I cannot tell. I told him\r\n   that Lord Burghersh had been attached, as a military officer, to\r\n   one of the allied armies which had invaded France; but of this\r\n   he seemed to know nothing.\r\n\r\n   It was evident to me that the paragraph in the _Courier_,\r\n   which had been mentioned to me by General Bertrand, had been\r\n   shown to Napoleon, and had produced a great impression upon\r\n   him. He seemed to me to be meditating some enterprise, and yet\r\n   very doubtful whether he should undertake it. When we heard\r\n   afterwards of his expedition from Elba, the Count de Mosbourg,\r\n   a minister of Murat, was asked what could have induced Napoleon\r\n   to run so great a hazard; ‘_Un peu d’espoir et beaucoup de\r\n   désespoir_,’ was his reply. Such appeared to me to be, when I\r\n   saw him, the state of his mind; and when I got to Rome, I wrote\r\n   to my brother, Lord Tavistock, that I was sure Napoleon was\r\n   thinking of some fresh attempt.\r\n\r\n   Napoleon seemed very curious on the subject of the Duke of\r\n   Wellington. He said it was a great mistake in the English\r\n   Government to send him Ambassador to Paris. ‘_On n’aime pas\r\n   voir un homme par qui on a été battu_.’ He had never sent as\r\n   Ambassador to Vienna a man who had entered Vienna as an officer\r\n   of the French invading army. (Count Lebzeltern, the Austrian\r\n   Ambassador at Rome, denied the truth of this assertion.) As\r\n   I had seen a good deal of the Duke of Wellington in Spain,\r\n   Napoleon asked me what were likely to be his occupations. I\r\n   answered that during his campaigns the Duke had been so much\r\n   absorbed by his attention to the war that I did not well\r\n   understand how he could give his mind to other subjects. He\r\n   remarked, rather sharply, as if he thought I was inclined to\r\n   think lightly of military talents, ‘_Eh bien, c’est un grand\r\n   jeu, belle occupation!_’ He spoke at some length of his\r\n   plans respecting Spain. He would have divided the large landed\r\n   properties in the hands of the grandees, of the monasteries,\r\n   and of the clergy. He would have introduced into Spain the\r\n   enlightened principles of religious toleration and facilitated\r\n   commercial intercourse in the interior, etc.\r\n\r\n   I said that I thought Spain was not ready for such changes,\r\n   and that the Spanish people would resist them. ‘_Ils\r\n   succomberaient_,’ he said, and then the subject dropped.\r\n\r\n   He asked me whether I knew anything of what was passing at the\r\n   Congress of Vienna. I said, ‘Nothing.’ He said he expected that\r\n   each Power would have confirmed to it by treaty the territories\r\n   which its forces occupied. In respect to the three great\r\n   military Powers, Austria, Russia, and Prussia, this prediction\r\n   was nearly verified. Mr. Pitt, however, had intended, in 1805,\r\n   to give Belgium to Prussia; Lord Castlereagh gave it to the\r\n   Netherlands.\r\n\r\n   Napoleon spoke of Lord Ebrington, whom he had recently seen,\r\n   and said he was ‘_un homme fort instruit; du moins, il m’a\r\n   paru un homme fort instruit_.’ It struck me afterwards that\r\n   while he had spoken to Lord Ebrington of great events of his\r\n   past life--of Jaffa, of the execution of the Duc d’Enghien,\r\n   and other acts on which the world had passed its judgment--he\r\n   spoke to me almost entirely of the existing aspect of affairs.\r\n   His past history had ceased to be his main object, and his mind\r\n   was busy with the present and the future. He said, ‘You must be\r\n   very well satisfied, you English, to have finished the war so\r\n   successfully.’ I answered, ‘Yes, Sire, especially as at one time\r\n   we thought ourselves in great danger.’\r\n\r\n   He burst out laughing, ‘_Ha! ha! ha! C’était le système\r\n   continental, eh?_’\r\n\r\n   I said, ‘Yes, Sire; but as that system did not ruin us, it did\r\n   us a great deal of good. For men are much governed by their\r\n   physical wants.’\r\n\r\n   The interview ended soon after this. The next morning I was\r\n   told that a horse from the Emperor’s stable was at my disposal,\r\n   and I rode to a villa which he was constructing for his summer\r\n   occupation.\r\n\r\n   The day after I embarked, in the gun-brig in which I had come,\r\n   for Civita Vecchia.\r\n\r\n          I remain, my dear Van de Weyer,\r\n\r\n                                                Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                                        RUSSELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord J. Russell in his diary, wrote of Napoleon:--\r\n\r\n   ‘His manner is very good-natured, and seems studied to put\r\n   one at one’s ease by its familiarity; his smile and laugh are\r\n   very agreeable; he asks a number of questions without object,\r\n   and often repeats them, a habit which he has no doubt acquired\r\n   during fifteen years of supreme command. To this I should also\r\n   attribute the ignorance he seems to show at times of the most\r\n   common facts. When anything that he likes is said, he puts his\r\n   head forward and listens with great pleasure ... but when he\r\n   does not like what he hears, he turns away as if unconcerned,\r\n   and changes the subject. From this one might conclude that he\r\n   was open to flattery and violent in his temper.’\r\n\r\nSir Spencer Walpole in his _Life of Lord J. Russell_, adds:--\r\n\r\n   Lord John was with him [Napoleon] an hour and a half, conversing\r\n   on many subjects--the Russell family, Lord John’s own allowance\r\n   from the Duke, the state of Spain and Italy, the character\r\n   of the Duke of Wellington, and the arrangements likely to be\r\n   made at Vienna for the pacification of Europe. He used to say\r\n   in his old age, that as the Emperor became interested in his\r\n   conversation, he fell into the singular habit which he had\r\n   acquired, and pulled him by the ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            INDEX OF NAMES\r\n\r\n         (_Members of a family are mostly indexed together_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Abbot, Speaker, 20, 132, 139, 161.\r\n\r\n    Abdy, W., 65.\r\n\r\n    Abercromby, 56, 60, 65, 219, 279, 318.\r\n\r\n    Aberdeen, Lord, 51, 54, 164, 317.\r\n\r\n    Abrantès. _See_ Junot.\r\n\r\n    Acheson. _See_ Gosford.\r\n\r\n    Adair, Sir R., 29, 34, 240, 316.\r\n\r\n    Adderley, 118.\r\n\r\n    Addington, Hy., 170, 174.\r\n\r\n    Adelaide, Queen, 118.\r\n\r\n    Albany, Countess, 254, 276.\r\n\r\n    Aldborough, Lady, 277.\r\n\r\n    Alderson, Dr., 209.\r\n\r\n    Alexander I., 156, 286, 298.\r\n\r\n    Alfieri, F., 254.\r\n\r\n    Alison, Sir A., 274.\r\n\r\n    Allen, John, 114.\r\n\r\n    Althorp, Lord, 48, 51, 99, 318.\r\n\r\n    Ambert, Dr. Antoine, 80.\r\n\r\n    Ancrum, Lady, 236, 318.\r\n\r\n    Anderson, James, 115.\r\n\r\n    Andreossi, General, 86, 175.\r\n\r\n    Anglesey. _See_ Paget.\r\n\r\n    Angoulême, Duchess, 287, 307.\r\n\r\n    Annesley, 13, 61, 130, 196, 209, 235, 261, 318.\r\n\r\n    Anspach, Margrave, 239.\r\n\r\n    Antraigues, Comte d’, 6, 75.\r\n\r\n    Apreece, S.

Being arrested, he\r\napplied to her previous lover Lauzun to procure his release, but was\r\nliberated without any necessity of mediation and returned to London.\r\n\r\n[8] Pitt was inclined in 1797 to entertain the overture, but the\r\nFrench _coup d’état_ put an end to negotiations. See _Fortescue\r\nPapers_, iii. pp. 356–357. The French authorities ordered Melville’s\r\narrest, but he apparently fled in time, and coolly revisited Paris in\r\n1802.\r\n\r\n[9] The Jacobins were scandalised at the pomp with which he entered\r\nParis, where the market-women waited on him to make and receive\r\npresents.\r\n\r\n[10] Talbot, when acting at Berne in Wickham’s absence in 1797,\r\nadvanced money to French conspirators for a scheme of massacring the\r\nmembers of the Directory at the Luxembourg, and he applied to his\r\nGovernment for further funds for that purpose; but Grenville and\r\nCanning refused to countenance the scheme and directed him to get back\r\nthe money (Martel, _Historiens Fantaisistes_). Though thus rebuked\r\nTalbot was not dismissed.\r\n\r\n[11] J. F. Neville, _Leisure Moments_.\r\n\r\n[12] Detected in 1802 he was hanged for the murder of Sergeant\r\nArmstrong at Goree in 1782.\r\n\r\n[13] This was a saving of expense, for Napoleon had refused to pay the\r\n£2,000,000 demanded for their maintenance.\r\n\r\n[14] It is pleasant to think that Lauriston, Macdonald, and Clarke,\r\nthree men of British extraction, were among the few French generals who\r\non Napoleon’s return from Elba remained faithful to the Bourbons.\r\n\r\n[15] M.P. for Eye in 1820.\r\n\r\n[16] The suit of carriages for the use of Marquis Cornwallis in France\r\nconsists of a town coach, the body yellow, with arms, supporters,\r\ncrests, and the Order of the Garter, surrounded with mantles, all\r\nhighly emblazoned. The lining morocco with rich silk lace, and\r\nreclining cushions of silk and morocco. The carriage crane-neck;\r\nthe hammer-cloth a bear-skin ornamented with silver paws. A town\r\nchariot painted to correspond, with arms, supporters, crests, and\r\nthe Garter, but no mantles; crane-neck. A travelling coach, painted\r\nthe same; crane-neck with imperials, etc. Harness has been made\r\nfor twelve horses ornamented with silver in coronets, crests, and\r\nthe Garter, with reins, tassels, and toppings, decorated with silk\r\nbutton-hangers.--_Times._\r\n\r\n[17] The termination of the Congress at Amiens was an object of the\r\ndeepest regret to the Prefects and officers, civil as well as military.\r\nThe establishment of each ambassador had its particular merit. That\r\nof Marquis Cornwallis was distinguished for the magnificence of his\r\nliveries, and the splendour of his table and equipage. On all his grand\r\ndinners, his Lordship had twelve servants in rich liveries, besides six\r\n_Valets-de-Chambre_ also in a kind of scarlet uniform.\r\n\r\nBut in regard to the luxuries of the table, and the choice of his\r\nwines, citizen Schimmelpenninck, the Batavian plenipotentiary, outdid\r\nall other competition. He had his turbot and eels from Holland,\r\npike and perch from the Rhine; and the heaths and woods of Provence\r\nsupplied him with game. No wonder that the absence of such a man\r\nshould be lamented by the _Mayor and Common Council_ of that\r\ncity.--_Times_, April 2, 1802.\r\n\r\n[18] The Warrens and the Jacksons were kinsmen, for in 1796 a Rev.\r\nDawson Warren had married Caroline Jackson.\r\n\r\n[19] Despatches, Record Office.\r\n\r\n[20] In 1809 he was appointed minister at Washington.\r\n\r\n[21] He died from a hunting accident in 1815.\r\n\r\n[22] Afterwards minister to the Argentine Republic.\r\n\r\n[23] Son of Lord Pierrepont (created Earl Manvers in 1806).\r\n\r\n[24] The embassy apparently required a Frenchman to translate or\r\ncorrect its letters to Talleyrand, for in 1804 François Soulès, who had\r\nlived twelve years in England and had translated English works, applied\r\nfor the Legion of Honour on the ground that he had not only helped to\r\ncapture the Bastille, but had been employed by Whitworth.\r\n\r\n[25] Rogers, _Italy_.\r\n\r\n[26] A. F. 1539–1543.\r\n\r\n[27] The return coach left Paris at 6 A.M., but from July 1802\r\nthere was also a _berline_ with six places which started at 4\r\nP.M., travelled all night, and arrived as soon as the morning\r\ncoach.\r\n\r\n[28] _Practical Guide ...

King, _Tour in France_.\r\n\r\n[30] In 1814, according to Kirwan, the fishwives no longer carried\r\npassengers on their backs, but wading through the water tugged or\r\npushed small boats ashore. But Richard Bernard Boyle was carried ashore\r\nby three men, one holding each leg and the third pushing behind.\r\n\r\n[31] Also his biographer.
