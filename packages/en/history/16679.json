TO THE DEATH OF EDWARD III.\r\n(1216-1377)\r\n\r\nBY\r\nT.F. TOUT, M.A.\r\nProfessor of Mediæval and Modern History\r\nin the University of Manchester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICAL HISTORY OF ENGLAND IN TWELVE VOLUMES\r\n\r\nSeventy-six years have passed since Lingard completed his HISTORY OF\r\nENGLAND, which ends with the Revolution of 1688. During that period\r\nhistorical study has made a great advance. Year after year the mass of\r\nmaterials for a new History of England has increased; new lights have\r\nbeen thrown on events and characters, and old errors have been\r\ncorrected. Many notable works have been written on various periods of\r\nour history; some of them at such length as to appeal almost\r\nexclusively to professed historical students. It is believed that the\r\ntime has come when the advance which has been made in the knowledge of\r\nEnglish history as a whole should be laid before the public in a single\r\nwork of fairly adequate size. Such a book should be founded on\r\nindependent thought and research, but should at the same time be\r\nwritten with a full knowledge of the works of the best modern\r\nhistorians and with a desire to take advantage of their teaching\r\nwherever it appears sound.\r\n\r\nThe vast number of authorities, printed and in manuscript, on which a\r\nHistory of England should be based, if it is to represent the existing\r\nstate of knowledge, renders co-operation almost necessary and certainly\r\nadvisable. The History, of which this volume is an instalment, is an\r\nattempt to set forth in a readable form the results at present attained\r\nby research. It will consist of twelve volumes by twelve different\r\nwriters, each of them chosen as being specialty capable of dealing with\r\nthe period which he undertakes, and the editors, while leaving to each\r\nauthor as free a hand as possible, hope to insure a general similarity\r\nin method of treatment, so that the twelve volumes may in their\r\ncontents, as well as in their outward appearance, form one History.\r\n\r\nAs its title imports, this History will primarily deal with politics,\r\nwith the History of England and, after the date of the union with\r\nScotland, Great Britain, as a state or body politic; but as the life of\r\na nation is complex, and its condition at any given time cannot be\r\nunderstood without taking into account the various forces acting upon\r\nit, notices of religious matters and of intellectual, social, and\r\neconomic progress will also find place in these volumes. The footnotes\r\nwill, so far as is possible, be confined to references to authorities,\r\nand references will not be appended to statements which appear to be\r\nmatters of common knowledge and do not call for support. Each volume\r\nwill have an Appendix giving some account of the chief authorities,\r\noriginal and secondary, which the author has used. This account will be\r\ncompiled with a view of helping students rather than of making long\r\nlists of books without any notes as to their contents or value. That\r\nthe History will have faults both of its own and such as will always in\r\nsome measure attend co-operative work, must be expected, but no pains\r\nhave been spared to make it, so far as may be, not wholly unworthy of\r\nthe greatness of its subject.\r\n\r\nEach volume, while forming part of a complete History, will also in\r\nitself be a separate and complete book, will be sold separately, and\r\nwill have its own index, and two or more maps.\r\n\r\nVol. I. to 1066.

The arrival of Louis of France,\r\neldest son of King Philip Augustus, had enabled the barons to win back\r\nmuch of the ground lost after John's early triumphs had forced them to\r\ncall in the foreigner. Beyond the Humber the sturdy north-country\r\nbarons, who had wrested the Great Charter from John, remained true to\r\ntheir principles, and had also the support of Alexander II., King of\r\nScots. The magnates of the eastern counties were as staunch as the\r\nnortherners, and the rich and populous southern shires were for the\r\nmost part in agreement with them. In the west, the barons had the aid\r\nof Llewelyn ap Iorwerth, the great Prince of North Wales. While ten\r\nearls fought for Louis, the royal cause was only upheld by six. The\r\ntowns were mainly with the rebels, notably London and the Cinque Ports,\r\nand cities so distant as Winchester and Lincoln, Worcester and\r\nCarlisle. Yet the baronial cause excited little general sympathy. The\r\nmass of the population stood aloof, and was impartially maltreated by\r\nthe rival armies.\r\n\r\nJohn's son Henry had at his back the chief military resources of the\r\ncountry; the two strongest of the earls, William Marshal, Earl of\r\nPembroke, and Randolph of Blundeville, Earl of Chester; the fierce\r\nlords of the Welsh March, the Mortimers, the Cantilupes, the Cliffords,\r\nthe Braoses, and the Lacys; and the barons of the West Midlands, headed\r\nby Henry of Neufbourg, Earl of Warwick, and William of Ferrars, Earl of\r\nDerby. This powerful phalanx gave to the royalists a stronger hold in\r\nthe west than their opponents had in any one part of the much wider\r\nterritory within their sphere of influence. There was no baronial\r\ncounterpart to the successful raiding of the north and east, which John\r\nhad carried through in the last months of his life. A baronial centre,\r\nlike Worcester, could not hold its own long in the west. Moreover, John\r\nhad not entirely forfeited his hereditary advantages. The\r\nadministrative families, whose chief representative was the justiciar\r\nHubert de Burgh, held to their tradition of unswerving loyalty, and\r\njoined with the followers of the old king, of whom William Marshal was\r\nthe chief survivor. All over England the royal castles were in safe\r\nhands, and so long as they remained unsubdued, no part of Louis'\r\ndominions was secure. The crown had used to the full its rights over\r\nminors and vacant fiefs. The subjection of the south-west was assured\r\nby the marriage of the mercenary leader, Falkes de Bréauté, to the\r\nmother of the infant Earl of Devon, and by the grant of Cornwall to the\r\nbastard of the last of the Dunstanville earls. Though Isabella,\r\nCountess of Gloucester, John's repudiated wife, was as zealous as her\r\nnew husband, the Earl of Essex, against John's son, Falkes kept a tight\r\nhand over Glamorgan, on which the military power of the house of\r\nGloucester largely depended. Randolph of Chester was custodian of the\r\nearldoms of Leicester and Richmond, of which the nominal earls, Simon\r\nde Montfort and Peter Mauclerc, were far away, the one ruling Toulouse,\r\nand the other Brittany. The band of foreign adventurers, the mainstay\r\nof John's power, was still unbroken. Ruffians though these hirelings\r\nwere, they had experience, skill, and courage, and were the only\r\nprofessional soldiers in the country.\r\n\r\nThe vital fact of the situation was that the immense moral and\r\nspiritual forces of the Church remained on the side of the king.\r\nInnocent III. had died some months before John, but his successor,\r\nHonorius III., continued to uphold his policy. The papal legate, the\r\nCardinal Gualo, was the soul of the royalist cause. Louis and his\r\nadherents had been excommunicated, and not a single English bishop\r\ndared to join openly the foes of Holy Church. The most that the\r\nclerical partisans of the barons could do was to disregard the\r\ninterdict and continue their ministrations to the excommunicated host.\r\nThe strongest English prelate, Stephen Langton, Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, was at Rome in disgrace. Walter Grey, Archbishop of York,\r\nand Hugh of Wells, Bishop of Lincoln, were also abroad, while the\r\nBishop of London, William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise, was incapacitated by\r\nillness. Several important sees, including Durham and Ely, were vacant.\r\nThe ablest resident bishop, Peter des Roches of Winchester, was an\r\naccomplice in John's misgovernment.\r\n\r\nThe chief obstacle in the way of the royalists had been the character\r\nof John, and the little Henry of Winchester could have had no share in\r\nthe crimes of his father. But the dead king had lately shown such rare\r\nenergy that there was a danger lest the accession of a boy of nine\r\nmight not weaken the cause of monarchy. The barons were largely out of\r\nhand. The war was assuming the character of the civil war of Stephen's\r\ndays, and John's mercenaries were aspiring to play the part of feudal\r\npotentates. It was significant that so many of John's principal\r\nsupporters were possessors of extensive franchises, like the lords of\r\nthe Welsh March, who might well desire to extend these feudal\r\nimmunities to their English estates. The triumph of the crown through\r\nsuch help might easily have resolved the united England of Henry II.\r\ninto a series of lordships under a nominal king.\r\n\r\nThe situation was saved by the wisdom and moderation of the papal\r\nlegate, and the loyalty of William Marshal, who forgot his interests as\r\nEarl of Pembroke in his devotion to the house of Anjou. From the moment\r\nof John's death at Newark, the cardinal and the marshal took the lead.\r\nThey met at Worcester, where the tyrant was buried, and at once made\r\npreparations for the coronation of Henry of Winchester. The ceremony\r\ntook place at St. Peter's Abbey, Gloucester, on October 28, from which\r\nday the new reign was reckoned as beginning. The marshal, who had\r\nforty-three years before dubbed the \"young king\" Henry a knight, then\r\nfor a second time admitted a young king Henry to the order of chivalry.\r\nWhen the king had recited the coronation oath and performed homage to\r\nthe pope, Gualo anointed him and placed on his head the plain gold\r\ncirclet that perforce did duly for a crown.[1] Next day Henry's leading\r\nsupporters performed homage, and before November 1 the marshal was made\r\njusticiar.\r\n\r\n    [1] There is some conflict of evidence on this point, and Dr.\r\n    Stubbs, following Wendover, iv., 2, makes Peter of Winchester\r\n    crown Henry. But the official account in _Fædera, i._, 145, is\r\n    confirmed by _Ann. Tewkesbury_, p. 62; _Histoire de G. le\r\n    Maréchal_, lines 15329-32; _Hist. des ducs de Normandie, et des\r\n    rois d'Angleterre_, p. 181, and _Ann. Winchester_, p. 83.\r\n    Wykes, p. 60, and _Ann. Dunstable_, p. 48, which confirm\r\n    Wendover, are suspect by reason of other errors.\r\n\r\nOn November 2 a great council met at Bristol. Only four earls appeared,\r\nand one of these, William of Fors, Earl of Albemarle, was a recent\r\nconvert. But the presence of eleven bishops showed that the Church had\r\nespoused the cause of the little king, and a throng of western and\r\nmarcher magnates made a sufficient representation of the lay baronage.\r\nThe chief business was to provide for the government during the\r\nminority. Gualo withstood the temptation to adopt the method by which\r\nInnocent III. had ruled Sicily in the name of Frederick II. The king's\r\nmother was too unpopular and incompetent to anticipate the part played\r\nby Blanche of Castile during the minority of St. Louis. After the\r\nprecedents set by the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem, the barons took the\r\nmatter into their own hands. Their work of selection was not an easy\r\none. Randolph of Chester was by far the most powerful of the royalist\r\nlords, but his turbulence and purely personal policy, not less than his\r\nexcessive possessions and inordinate palatine jurisdictions, made him\r\nunsuitable for the regency. Yet had he raised any sort of claim, it\r\nwould have been hardly possible to resist his pretensions.[1] Luckily,\r\nRandolph stood aside, and his withdrawal gave the aged earl marshal the\r\nposition for which his nomination as justiciar at Gloucester had\r\nalready marked him out. The title of regent was as yet unknown, either\r\nin England or France, but the style, \"ruler of king and kingdom,\" which\r\nthe barons gave to the marshal, meant something more than the ordinary\r\nposition of a justiciar. William's friends had some difficulty in\r\npersuading him to accept the office. He was over seventy years of age,\r\nand felt it would be too great a burden. Induced at last by the legate\r\nto undertake the charge, from that moment he shrank from none of its\r\nresponsibilities. The personal care of the king was comprised within\r\nthe marshal's duties, but he delegated that branch of his work to Peter\r\ndes Roches.[2] These two, with Gualo, controlled the whole policy of the\r\nnew reign. Next to them came Hubert de Burgh, John's justiciar, whom\r\nthe marshal very soon restored to that office. But Hubert at once went\r\nback to the defence of Dover, and for some time took little part in\r\ngeneral politics.\r\n\r\n    [1] The fears and hopes of the marshal's friends are well\r\n    depicted in _Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal_, lines\r\n    15500-15708.\r\n\r\n    [2] The panegyrist of the marshal emphasises strongly the fact\r\n    that Peter's charge was a delegation, _ibid._, lines\r\n    17993-18018.\r\n\r\nOn November 12, the legate and the regent issued at Bristol a\r\nconfirmation of the Great Charter. Some of the most important articles\r\naccepted by John in 1215 were omitted, including the \"constitutional\r\nclauses\" requiring the consent of the council of barons for\r\nextraordinary taxation. Other provisions, which tied the hands of the\r\ngovernment, were postponed for further consideration in more settled\r\ntimes. But with all its mutilations the Bristol charter of 1216 marked a\r\nmore important moment than even the charter of Runnymede. The\r\ncondemnation of Innocent III. would in all probability have prevented\r\nthe temporary concession of John from becoming permanent. Love of\r\ncountry and love of liberty were doubtless growing forces, but they were\r\nstill in their infancy, while the papal authority was something ultimate\r\nagainst which few Christians dared appeal. Thus the adoption by the free\r\nwill of the papal legate, and the deliberate choice of the marshal of\r\nthe policy of the Great Charter, converted, as has well been said, \"a\r\ntreaty won at the point of the sword into a manifesto of peace and sound\r\ngovernment\".[1] This wise change of policy cut away the ground from under\r\nthe feet of the English supporters of Louis. The friends of the young\r\nHenry could appeal to his innocence, to his sacred unction, and to his\r\nrecognition by Holy Church. They offered a programme of limited\r\nmonarchy, of the redress of grievances, of vested rights preserved, and\r\nof adhesion to the good old traditions that all Englishmen respected.\r\nFrom that moment the Charter became a new starting-point in our history.\r\n\r\n    [1] Stubbs, _Const. Hist._, ii., 21.\r\n\r\nIn strange contrast to this programme of reform, the aliens, who had\r\nopposed the charter of Runnymede, were among the lords by whose counsel\r\nand consent the charter of Bristol was issued. In its weakness the new\r\ngovernment sought to stimulate the zeal both of the foreign mercenaries\r\nand of the loyal barons by grants and privileges which seriously\r\nentrenched upon the royal authority. Falkes de Bréauté was confirmed in\r\nthe custody of a compact group of six midland shires, besides the\r\nearldom of Devon, and the \"county of the Isle of Wight,\"[1] which he\r\nguarded in the interests of his wife and stepson. Savary de Mauléon, who\r\nin despair of his old master's success had crossed over to Poitou before\r\nJohn's death, was made warden of the castle of Bristol. Randolph of\r\nChester was consoled for the loss of the regency by the renewal of\r\nJohn's recent grant of the Honour of Lancaster which was by this time\r\ndefinitely recognised as a shire.[2]\r\n\r\n    [1] _Histoire des ducs de Normandie_, etc., p. 181.\r\n\r\n    [2] Tait, _Medieval Manchester and the Beginnings of\r\n    Lancashire_, p. 180.\r\n\r\nThe war assumed the character of a crusade. The royalist troops wore\r\nwhite crosses on their garments, and were assured by the clergy of\r\ncertain salvation. The cruel and purposeless ravaging of the enemy's\r\ncountry, which had occupied John's last months of life, became rare,\r\nthough partisans, such as Falkes de Bréauté, still outvied the French\r\nin plundering monasteries and churches. The real struggle became a war\r\nof castles. Louis endeavoured to complete his conquest of the\r\nsouth-east by the capture of the royal strongholds, which still limited\r\nhis power to the open country. At first the French prince had some\r\nsuccesses. In November he increased his hold on the Home counties by\r\ncapturing the Tower of London, by forcing Hertford to surrender, and by\r\npressing the siege of Berkhampsted. As Christmas approached the\r\nroyalists proposed a truce. Louis agreed on the condition that\r\nBerkhampsted should be surrendered, and early in 1217 both parties held\r\ncouncils, the royalists at Oxford and the barons at Cambridge. There\r\nwas vague talk of peace, but the war was renewed, and Louis captured\r\nHedingham and Orford in Essex, and besieged the castles of Colchester\r\nand Norwich. Then another truce until April 26 was concluded, on the\r\ncondition that the royalists should surrender these two strongholds.\r\n\r\nBoth sides had need to pause. Louis, at the limit of his resources, was\r\nanxious to obtain men and money from France. He was not getting on well\r\nwith his new subjects. The eastern counties grumbled at his taxes.\r\nDissensions arose between the English and French elements in his host.\r\nThe English lords resented the grants and appointments he gave to his\r\ncountrymen. The French nobles professed to despise the English as\r\ntraitors. When Hertford was taken, Robert FitzWalter demanded that its\r\ncustody should be restored to him. Louis roughly told him that\r\nEnglishmen, who had betrayed their natural lord, were not to be\r\nentrusted with such charges. It was to little purpose that he promised\r\nRobert that every man should have his rights when the war was over. The\r\nprospects of ending the war grew more remote every day. The royalists\r\ntook advantage of the discouragement of their opponents. The regent was\r\nlavish in promises. There should be no inquiry into bygones, and all\r\nwho submitted to the young king should be guaranteed all their existing\r\nrights. The result was that a steady stream of converts began to flow\r\nfrom the camp of Louis to the camp of the marshal. For the first time\r\nsigns of a national movement against Louis began to be manifest. It\r\nbecame clear that his rule meant foreign conquest.\r\n\r\nLouis wished to return to France, but despite the truce he could only\r\nwin his way to the coast by fighting. The Cinque Ports were changing\r\ntheir allegiance. A popular revolt had broken out in the Weald, where a\r\nwarlike squire, William of Cassingham,[1] soon became a terror to the\r\nFrench under his nickname of Wilkin of the Weald. As Louis traversed the\r\ndisaffected districts, Wilkin fell upon him near Lewes, and took\r\nprisoners two nephews of the Count of Nevers. On his further march to\r\nWinchelsea, the men of the Weald broke down the bridges behind him,\r\nwhile on his approach the men of Winchelsea destroyed their mills, and\r\ntook to their ships as avowed partisans of King Henry. The French prince\r\nentered the empty town, and had great difficulty in keeping his army\r\nalive. \"Wheat found they there,\" says a chronicler; \"in great plenty,\r\nbut they knew not how to grind it. Long time were they in such a plight\r\nthat they had to crush by hand the corn of which they made their bread.\r\nThey could catch no fish. Great store of nuts found they in the town;\r\nthese were their finest food.\"[2] Louis was in fact besieged by the\r\ninsurgents, and was only released by a force of knights riding down from\r\nLondon to help him. These troops dared not travel by the direct road\r\nthrough the Weald, and made their way to Romney through Canterbury. Rye\r\nwas strongly held against them and the ships of the Cinque Ports\r\ndominated the sea, so that Louis was still cut off from his friends at\r\nRomney. A relieving fleet was despatched from Boulogne, but stress of\r\nweather kept it for a fortnight at Dover, while Louis was starving at\r\nWinchelsea. At last the French ships appeared off Winchelsea. Thereupon\r\nthe English withdrew, and Louis finding the way open to France returned\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n    [1] Mr. G.J. Turner has identified Cassingham with the modern\r\n    Kensham, between Rolvenden and Sandhurst, in Kent.\r\n\r\n    [2] _Histoire des ducs de Normandie_, etc., p. 183.\r\n\r\nA crowd of waverers changed sides. At their head were William\r\nLongsword, Earl of Salisbury, the bastard great-uncle of the little\r\nking, and William, the young marshal, the eldest son of the Earl of\r\nPembroke. The regent wandered from town to town in Sussex, receiving\r\nthe submission of the peasantry, and venturing to approach as near\r\nLondon as Dorking. The victorious Wilkin was made Warden of the Seven\r\nHundreds of the Weald. The greatest of the magnates of Sussex and\r\nSurrey, William, Earl Warenne, followed the example of his tenantry,\r\nand made his peace with the king. The royalists fell upon the few\r\ncastles held by the barons. While one corps captured Odiham, Farnham,\r\nChichester, and other southern strongholds, Falkes de Bréauté overran\r\nthe Isle of Ely, and Randolph of Chester besieged the Leicestershire\r\nfortress of Mount Sorrel. Enguerrand de Coucy, whom Louis had left in\r\ncommand, remained helpless in London. His boldest act was to send a\r\nforce to Lincoln, which occupied the town, but failed to take the\r\ncastle. This stronghold, under its hereditary warden, the valiant old\r\nlady, Nichola de Camville,[1] had already twice withstood a siege.\r\n\r\n    [1] On Nichola de Camville or de la Hay see M. Petit-Dutaillis\r\n    in _Mélanges Julien Havet_, pp. 369-80.\r\n\r\nLouis found no great encouragement in France, for Philip Augustus, too\r\nprudent to offend the Church, gave but grudging support to his\r\nexcommunicated son. When, on the eve of the expiration of the truce,\r\nLouis returned to England, his reinforcements comprised only 120\r\nknights. Among them, however, were the Count of Brittany, Peter\r\nMauclerc, anxious to press in person his rights to the earldom of\r\nRichmond, the Counts of Perche and Guînes, and many lords of Picardy,\r\nArtois and Ponthieu. Conscious that everything depended on the speedy\r\ncapture of the royal castles, Louis introduced for the first time into\r\nEngland the _trébuchet_, a recently invented machine that cast great\r\nmissiles by means of heavy counterpoises. \"Great was the talk about\r\nthis, for at that time few of them had been seen in France.\"[1] On April\r\n22, Louis reached Dover, where the castle was still feebly beset by the\r\nFrench. On his nearing the shore, Wilkin of the Weald and Oliver, a\r\nbastard of King John's, burnt the huts of the French engaged in watching\r\nthe castle. Afraid to land in their presence, Louis disembarked at\r\nSandwich. Next day he went by land to Dover, but discouraged by tidings\r\nof his losses, he gladly concluded a short truce with Hubert de Burgh.\r\nHe abandoned the siege of Dover, and hurried off towards Winchester,\r\nwhere the two castles were being severely pressed by the royalists. But\r\nhis progress was impeded by his siege train, and Farnham castle blocked\r\nhis way.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Histoire des ducs de Normandie, etc._, p. 188; cf.\r\n    _English Hist. Review_, xviii. (1903), 263-64.\r\n\r\nSaer de Quincy, Earl of Winchester, joined Louis outside the walls of\r\nFarnham. Saer's motive was to persuade Louis to hasten to the relief of\r\nhis castle of Mount Sorrel. The French prince was not in a position to\r\nresist pressure from a powerful supporter. He divided his army, and\r\nwhile the Earl of Winchester, along with the Count of Perche and Robert\r\nFitzWalter, made their way to Leicestershire, he completed his journey\r\nto Winchester, threw a fresh force into the castles, and, leaving the\r\nCount of Nevers in charge, hurried to London. There he learnt that\r\nHubert de Burgh at Dover had broken the truce, and he at once set off\r\nto renew the siege of the stronghold which had so continually baulked\r\nhis plans. But little good came of his efforts, and the much-talked-of\r\n_trébuchet_ proving powerless to effect a breach, Louis had to resign\r\nhimself to a weary blockade. While he was besieging Dover, Saer de\r\nQuincy had relieved Mount Sorrel, whence he marched to the help of\r\nGilbert of Ghent, the only English baron whom Louis ventured to raise\r\nto comital rank as Earl of Lincoln. Gilbert was still striving to\r\ncapture Lincoln Castle, but Nichola de Camville had resisted him from\r\nFebruary to May. With the help of the army from Mount Sorrel, the\r\ncastle and its _châtelaine_ were soon reduced to great straits.\r\n\r\nThe marshal saw that the time was come to take the offensive, and\r\nresolved to raise the siege. Having no field army, he stripped his\r\ncastles of their garrisons, and gave rendezvous to his barons at\r\nNewark. There the royalists rested three days, and received the\r\nblessing of Gualo and the bishops. They then set out towards Lincoln,\r\ncommanded by the regent in person, the Earl of Chester, and the Bishop\r\nof Winchester, whom the legate appointed as his representative. The\r\nstrong water defences of the rebel city on the south made it\r\nunadvisable for them to take the direct route towards it. Their army\r\ndescended the Trent to Torksey, where it rested the night of May 19.\r\nEarly next day, the eve of Trinity Sunday, it marched in four \"battles\"\r\nto relieve Lincoln Castle.\r\n\r\nThere were more than 600 knights besieging the castle and holding the\r\ntown, and the relieving army only numbered 400 knights and 300\r\ncross-bowmen. But the barons dared not risk a combat that might have\r\ninvolved them in the fate of Stephen in 1141. They retreated within the\r\ncity and allowed the marshal to open up communications with the castle.\r\nThe marshal's plan of battle was arranged by Peter des Roches, who was\r\nmore at home in the field than in the church. The cross-bowmen under\r\nFalkes de Bréauté were thrown into the castle, and joined with the\r\ngarrison in making a sally from its east gate into the streets of the\r\ntown. While the barons were thus distracted, the marshal burst through\r\nthe badly defended north gate. The barons taken in front and flank\r\nfought desperately, but with no success. Falkes' cross-bowmen shot down\r\ntheir horses, and the dismounted knights soon failed to hold their own\r\nin the open ground about the cathedral. The Count of Perche was slain\r\nby a sword-thrust through the eyehole of his helmet. The royalists\r\nchased the barons down the steep lanes which connect the upper with the\r\nlower town. When they reached level ground the baronial troops rallied,\r\nand once more strove to reascend the hill. But the town was assailed on\r\nevery side, and its land defences yielded with little difficulty. The\r\nEarl of Chester poured his vassals through one of the eastern gates,\r\nand took the barons in flank. Once more they broke, and this time they\r\nrallied not again, but fled through the Wigford suburb seeking any\r\nmeans of escape. Some obstruction in the Bar-gate, the southern exit\r\nfrom the city, retarded their flight, and many of the leaders were\r\ncaptured. The remnant fled to London, thinking that \"every bush was\r\nfull of marshals,\" and suffering severely from the hostility of the\r\npeasantry. Only three persons were slain in the battle, but there was a\r\ncruel massacre of the defenceless citizens after its close. So vast was\r\nthe booty won by the victors that in scorn they called the fight the\r\nFair of Lincoln![1]\r\n\r\n    [1] For a discussion of the battle, see _English Hist. Review_,\r\n    xviii. (1903), 240-65.\r\n\r\nLouis' prospects were still not desperate. The victorious army\r\nscattered, each man to his own house, so that the marshal was in no\r\nposition to press matters to extremities. But there was a great rush to\r\nmake terms with the victor, and Louis thought it prudent to abandon the\r\nhopeless siege of Dover, and take refuge with his partisans, the\r\nLondoners. Meanwhile the marshal hovered round London, hoping\r\neventually to shut up the enemy in the capital. On June 12, the\r\nArchbishop of Tyre and three Cistercian abbots, who had come to England\r\nto preach the Crusade, persuaded both parties to accept provisional\r\narticles of peace. Louis stipulated for a complete amnesty to all his\r\npartisans; but the legate declined to grant pardon to the rebellious\r\nclerks who had refused to obey the interdict, conspicuous among whom\r\nwas the firebrand Simon Langton, brother of the archbishop. Finding no\r\ncompromise possible, Louis broke off the negotiations rather than\r\nabandon his friends. Gualo urged a siege of London, but the marshal saw\r\nthat his resources were not adequate for such a step. Again many of his\r\nfollowers went home, and the court abode first at Oxford and afterwards\r\nat Gloucester. It seemed as if the war might go on for ever.\r\n\r\nBlanche of Castile, Louis' wife, redoubled her efforts on his behalf. In\r\nresponse to her entreaties a hundred knights and several hundred\r\nmen-at-arms took ship for England. Among the knights was the famous\r\nWilliam des Barres, one of the heroes of Bouvines, and Theobald, Count\r\nof Blois. Eustace the Monk, a renegade clerk turned pirate, and a hero\r\nof later romance, took command of the fleet. On the eve of St.\r\nBartholomew, August 23, Eustace sailed from Calais towards the mouth of\r\nthe Thames. Kent had become royalist; the marshal and Hubert de Burgh\r\nheld Sandwich, so that the long voyage up the Thames was the only way of\r\ntaking succour to Louis. Next day the old earl remained on shore, but\r\nsent out Hubert with the fleet. The English let the French pass by,\r\nand then, manoeuvring for the weather gage, tacked and assailed them\r\nfrom behind.[1] The fight raged round the great ship of Eustace, on\r\nwhich the chief French knights were embarked. Laden with stores, horses,\r\nand a ponderous _trébuchet_, it was too low in the water to manoeuvre or\r\nescape. Hubert easily laid his own vessel alongside it. The English, who\r\nwere better used to fighting at sea than the French, threw powdered lime\r\ninto the faces of the enemy, swept the decks with their crossbow bolts\r\nand then boarded the ship, which was taken after a fierce fight. The\r\ncrowd of cargo boats could offer little resistance as they beat up\r\nagainst the wind in their retreat to Calais; the ships containing the\r\nsoldiers were more fortunate in escaping. Eustace was beheaded, and his\r\nhead paraded on a pole through the streets of Canterbury.\r\n\r\n    [1] This successful attempt of the English fleet to manoeuvre\r\n    for the weather gage, that is to secure a position to the\r\n    windward of their opponents, is the first recorded instance of\r\n    what became the favourite tactics of British admirals. For the\r\n    legend of Eustace see _Witasse le Moine_, ed. Förster (1891).\r\n\r\nThe battle of St. Bartholomew's Day, like that of Lincoln a triumph of\r\nskill over numbers, proved decisive for the fortunes of Louis. The\r\nEnglish won absolute control of the narrow seas, and cut off from Louis\r\nall hope of fighting his way back to France. As soon as he heard of the\r\ndefeat of Eustace, he reopened negotiations with the marshal. On the\r\n29th there was a meeting between Louis and the Earl at the gates of\r\nLondon. The regent had to check the ardour of his own partisans, and it\r\nwas only after anxious days of deliberation that the party of\r\nmoderation prevailed. On September 5 a formal conference was held on an\r\nisland of the Thames near Kingston. On the 11th a definitive treaty was\r\nsigned at the archbishop's house at Lambeth.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Lambeth repeated with little alteration the terms\r\nrejected by Louis three months before. The French prince surrendered\r\nhis castles, released his partisans from their oaths to him, and\r\nexhorted all his allies, including the King of Scots and the Prince of\r\nGwynedd, to lay down their arms. In return Henry promised that no\r\nlayman should lose his inheritance by reason of his adherence to Louis,\r\nand that the baronial prisoners should be released without further\r\npayment of ransom. London, despite its pertinacity in rebellion, was to\r\nretain its ancient franchises. The marshal bound himself personally to\r\npay Louis 10,000 marks, nominally as expenses, really as a bribe to\r\naccept these terms. A few days later Louis and his French barons\r\nappeared before the legate, barefoot and in the white garb of\r\npenitents, and were reconciled to the Church. They were then escorted\r\nto Dover, whence they took ship for France. Only on the rebellious\r\nclergy did Gualo's wrath fall. The canons of St. Paul's were turned out\r\nin a body; ringleaders like Simon Langton were driven into exile, and\r\nagents of the legate traversed the country punishing clerks who had\r\ndisregarded the interdict. But Honorius was more merciful than Gualo,\r\nand within a year even Simon received his pardon. The laymen of both\r\ncamps forgot their differences, when Randolph of Chester and William of\r\nFerrars fought in the crusade of Damietta, side by side with Saer of\r\nWinchester and Robert FitzWalter. The reconciliation of parties was\r\nfurther shown in the marriage of Hubert de Burgh to John's divorced\r\nwife, Isabella of Gloucester, a widow by the death of the Earl of\r\nEssex, and still the foremost English heiress. On November 6 the\r\npacification was completed by the reissue of the Great Charter in what\r\nwas substantially its final form. The forest clauses of the earlier\r\nissues were published in a much enlarged shape as a separate Forest\r\nCharter, which laid down the great principle that no man was to lose\r\nlife or limb for hindering the king's hunting.\r\n\r\nIt is tempting to regard the defeat of Louis as a triumph of English\r\npatriotism. But it is an anachronism to read the ideals of later ages\r\ninto the doings of the men of the early thirteenth century. So far as\r\nthere was national feeling in England, it was arrayed against Henry. To\r\nthe last the most fervently English of the barons were steadfast on the\r\nFrench prince's side, and the triumph of the little king had largely\r\nbeen procured by John's foreigners. To contemporary eyes the rebels\r\nwere factious assertors of class privileges and feudal immunities.\r\nTheir revolt against their natural lord brought them into conflict with\r\nthe sentiment of feudal duty which was still so strong in faithful\r\nminds. And against them was a stronger force than feudal loyally. From\r\nthis religious standpoint the Canon of Barnwell best sums up the\r\nsituation: \"It was a miracle that the heir of France, who had won so\r\nlarge a part of the kingdom, was constrained to abandon the realm\r\nwithout hope of recovering it. It was because the hand of God was not\r\nwith him. He came to England in spite of the prohibition of the Holy\r\nRoman Church, and he remained there regardless of its anathema.\"\r\n\r\nThe young king never forgot that he owed his throne to the pope and his\r\nlegate. \"When we were bereft of our father in tender years,\" he declared\r\nlong afterwards, \"when our subjects were turned against us, it was our\r\nmother, the Holy Roman Church, that brought back our realm under our\r\npower, anointed us king, crowned us, and placed us on the throne.\"[1]\r\nThe papacy, which had secured a new hold over England by its alliance\r\nwith John, made its position permanent by its zeal for the rights of his\r\nson. By identifying the monarchy with the charters, it skilfully\r\nretraced the false step which it had taken. Under the ægis of the Roman\r\nsee the national spirit grew, and the next generation was to see the\r\ntemper fostered by Gualo in its turn grow impatient of the papal\r\nsupremacy. It was Gualo, then, who secured the confirmation of the\r\ncharters. Even Louis unconsciously worked in that direction, for, had he\r\nnot gained so strong a hold on the country, there would have been no\r\nreason to adopt a policy of conciliation. We must not read the history\r\nof this generation in the light of modern times, or even with the eyes\r\nof Matthew Paris.\r\n\r\n    [1] Grosseteste, _Epistolæ_, p. 339.\r\n\r\nThe marshal had before him a task essentially similar to that which\r\nHenry II had undertaken after the anarchy of Stephen's reign. It was\r\nwith the utmost difficulty that the sum promised to Louis could be\r\nextracted from the war-stricken and famished tillers of the soil. The\r\nexchequer was so empty that the Christmas court of the young king was\r\ncelebrated at the expense of Falkes de Bréauté. Those who had fought\r\nfor the king clamoured for grants and rewards, and it was necessary to\r\nhumour them. For example, Randolph of Blundeville, with the earldom of\r\nLincoln added to his Cheshire palatinate and his Lancashire Honour, had\r\nacquired a position nearly as strong as that of the Randolph of the\r\nreign of Stephen. \"Adulterine castles\" had grown up in such numbers\r\nthat the new issue of the Charter insisted upon their destruction. Even\r\nthe lawful castles were held by unauthorised custodians, who refused to\r\nyield them up to the king's officers. Though Alexander, King of Scots,\r\npurchased his reconciliation with Rome by abandoning Carlisle and\r\nperforming homage to Henry, the Welsh remained recalcitrant. One\r\nchieftain, Morgan of Caerleon, waged war against the marshal in Gwent,\r\nand was dislodged with difficulty. During the war Llewelyn ap Iorwerth\r\nconquered Cardigan and Carmarthen from the marchers, and it was only\r\nafter receiving assurances that he might retain these districts so long\r\nas the king's minority lasted that he condescended to do homage at\r\nWorcester in March, 1218.\r\n\r\nIn the following May Stephen Langton came back from exile and threw the\r\nweight of his judgment on the regent's side. Gradually the worst\r\ndifficulties were surmounted. The administrative machinery once more\r\nbecame effective. A new seal was cast for the king, whose documents had\r\nhitherto been stamped with the seal of the regent. Order was so far\r\nrestored that Gualo returned to Italy. He was a man of high character\r\nand noble aims, caring little for personal advancement, and curbing his\r\nhot zeal against \"schismatics\" in his desire to restore peace to\r\nEngland. His memory is still commemorated in his great church of St.\r\nAndrew, at Vercelli, erected, it may be, with the proceeds of his\r\nEnglish benefices, and still preserving the manuscript of legends of\r\nits patron saint, which its founder had sent thither from his exile.\r\n\r\nAt Candlemas, 1219, the aged regent was smitten with a mortal illness.\r\nHis followers bore him up the Thames from London to his manor of\r\nCaversham, where his last hours were disturbed by the intrigues of\r\nPeter of Winchester for his succession, and the importunity of selfish\r\nclerks, clamouring for grants to their churches. He died on May 14,\r\nclad in the habit of the Knights of the Temple, in whose new church in\r\nLondon his body was buried, and where his effigy may still be seen. The\r\nlandless younger son of a poor baron, he had supported himself in his\r\nyouth by the spoils of the knights he had vanquished in the\r\ntournaments, where his successes gained him fame as the model of\r\nchivalry. The favour of Henry, the \"young king,\" gave him political\r\nimportance, and his marriage with Strongbow's daughter made him a\r\nmighty man in England, Ireland, Wales, and Normandy. Strenuous and\r\nupright, simple and dignified, the young soldier of fortune bore easily\r\nthe weight of office and honour which accrued to him before the death\r\nof his first patron. Limited as was his outlook, he gave himself\r\nentirely to his master-principle of loyally to the feudal lord whom he\r\nhad sworn to obey. This simple conception enabled him to subordinate\r\nhis interests as a marcher potentate to his duty to the English\r\nmonarchy. It guided him in his difficult work of serving with unbending\r\nconstancy a tyrant like John. It shone most clearly when in his old age\r\nhe saved John's son from the consequences of his father's misdeeds. A\r\nhappy accident has led to the discovery in our own days of the long\r\npoem, drawn up in commemoration of his career[1] at the\r\ninstigation of his son. This important work has enabled us to enter\r\ninto the marshal's character and spirit in much the same way as\r\nJoinville's _History of St. Louis_ has made us familiar with the\r\nmotives and attributes of the great French king. They are the two men\r\nof the thirteenth century whom we know most intimately. It is well that\r\nthe two characters thus portrayed at length represent to us so much of\r\nwhat is best in the chivalry, loyalty, statecraft, and piety of the\r\nMiddle Ages.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Histoire de Guillaume le Maréchal_, published by P. Meyer\r\n    for the Soc. de l'histoire de France. Petit-Dutaillis, _Étude\r\n    sur Louis VIII._ (1894), and G.J. Turner, _Minority of Henry\r\n    III._, part i, in _Transactions of the Royal Hist. Soc._, new\r\n    ser., viii. (1904), 245-95, are the best modern commentaries on\r\n    the history of the marshal's regency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE RULE OF HUBERT DE BURGH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Marshal had recognized that the regency must end with him.\r\n\"There is no land,\" he declared, \"where the people are so divided as\r\nthey are in England. Were I to hand over the king to one noble, the\r\nothers would be jealous. For this reason I have determined to entrust\r\nhim to God and the pope. No one can blame me for this, for, if the land\r\nis not defended by the pope, I know no one who can protect it.\" The\r\nfortunate absence of Randolph of Chester on crusade made it easy to\r\ncarry out this plan. Accordingly the king of twelve years was supposed\r\nto be capable of acting for himself. But the ultimate authority resided\r\nwith the new legate Pandulf, who, without any formal designation, was\r\nthe real successor of the marshal. This arrangement naturally left\r\ngreat power to Peter des Roches, who continued to have the custody of\r\nthe king's person, and to Hubert the justiciar, who henceforth acted as\r\nPandulf's deputy. Next to them came the Archbishop of Canterbury.\r\nLangton's share in the struggle for the charters was so conspicuous,\r\nthat we do not always remember that it was as a scholar and a\r\ntheologian that he acquired his chief reputation among his\r\ncontemporaries. On his return from exile he found such engrossing\r\noccupation in the business of his see, that he took little part in\r\npolitics for several years. His self-effacement strengthened the\r\nposition of the legate.\r\n\r\nPandulf was no stranger to England. As subdeacon of the Roman Church he\r\nreceived John's submission in 1213, and stood by his side during nearly\r\nall his later troubles. He had been rewarded by his election to the\r\nbishopric of Norwich, but was recalled to Rome before his consecration,\r\nand only came back to England in the higher capacity of legate on\r\nDecember 3, 1218, after the recall of Gualo. He had been the cause of\r\nLangton's suspension, and there was probably no love lost between him\r\nand the archbishop. It was in order to avoid troublesome questions of\r\njurisdiction that Pandulf, at the pope's suggestion, continued to\r\npostpone his consecration as bishop, since that act would have\r\nsubordinated him to the Archbishop of Canterbury. But neither he nor\r\nLangton was disposed to push matters to extremities. Just as Peter des\r\nRoches balanced Hubert de Burgh, so the archbishop acted as a makeweight\r\nto the legate. When power was thus nicely equipoised, there was a\r\nnatural tendency to avoid conflicting issues. In these circumstances the\r\ntruce between parties, which had marked the regency, continued for the\r\nfirst years after Earl William's death. In all doubtful points the will\r\nof the legate seems to have prevailed. Pandulf's correspondence shows\r\nhim interfering in every matter of state. He associated himself with the\r\njusticiar in the appointment of royal officials; he invoked the papal\r\nauthority to put down \"adulterine castles,\" and to prevent any baron\r\nhaving more than one royal stronghold in his custody; he prolonged the\r\ntruce with France, and strove to pacify the Prince of North Wales; he\r\nprocured the resumption of the royal domain, and rebuked Bishop Peter\r\nand the justiciar for remissness in dealing with Jewish usurers; he\r\nfilled up bishoprics at his own discretion. Nor did he neglect his own\r\ninterests; his kinsfolk found preferment in his English diocese, and he\r\nappropriated certain livings for the payment of his debts, \"so far as\r\ncould be done without offence\". But in higher matters he pursued a wise\r\npolicy. In recognising that the great interest of the Church was peace,\r\nhe truly expressed the policy of the mild Honorius. For more than two\r\nyears he kept Englishmen from flying at each other's throats. If they\r\npaid for peace by the continuance of foreign rule, it was better to be\r\ngoverned by Pandulf than pillaged by Falkes. The principal events of\r\nthese years were due to papal initiative.[1] Honorius looked askance on\r\nthe maimed rites of the Gloucester coronation, and ordered a new\r\nhallowing to take place at the accustomed place and with the accustomed\r\nceremonies. This supplementary rite was celebrated at Westminster on\r\nWhitsunday, May 17, 1220. Though Pandulf was present, he discreetly\r\npermitted the Archbishop of Canterbury to crown Henry with the diadem of\r\nSt. Edward. \"This coronation,\" says the Canon of Barnwell, \"was\r\ncelebrated with such good order and such splendour that the oldest\r\nmagnates who were present declared that they had seen none of the king's\r\npredecessors crowned with so much goodwill and tranquillity.\" Nor was\r\nthis the only great ecclesiastical function of the year. On July 7\r\nLangton celebrated at Canterbury the translation of the relics of St.\r\nThomas to a magnificent shrine at the back of the high altar. Again the\r\nlegate gave precedence to the archbishop, and the presence of the young\r\nking, of the Archbishop of Reims, and the Primate of Hungary, gave\r\ndistinction to the solemnity. It was a grand time for English saints.\r\nWhen Damietta was taken from the Mohammedans, the crusaders dedicated\r\ntwo of its churches to St. Thomas of Canterbury and St. Edmund the King.\r\nA new saint was added to the calendar, who, if not an Englishman, had\r\ndone good work for the country of his adoption. In 1220 Honorius III.\r\ncanonised Hugh of Avalon, the Carthusian Bishop of Lincoln, on the\r\nreport of a commission presided over by Langton himself.\r\n\r\n    [1]: H.R. Luard, _On the Relations between England and Rome\r\n    during the Earlier Portion of the Reign of Henry III._ (1877),\r\n    illustrates papal influence at this period.\r\n\r\nNo real unity of principle underlay the external tranquillity. As time\r\nwent on Peter des Roches bitterly resented the growing preponderance of\r\nHubert de Burgh. Not all the self-restraint of the legate could commend\r\nhim to Langton, whose obstinate insistence upon his metropolitical\r\nauthority forced Pandulf to procure bulls from Rome specifically\r\nreleasing him from the jurisdiction of the primate. In these\r\ncircumstances it was natural for Bishop Peter and the legate to join\r\ntogether against the justiciar and the archbishop. Finding that the\r\nlegate was too strong for him, Langton betook himself to Rome, and\r\nremained there nearly a year. Before he went home he persuaded Honorius\r\nto promise not to confer the same benefice twice by papal provision,\r\nand to send no further legate to England during his lifetime. Pandulf\r\nwas at once recalled, and left England in July, 1221, a month before\r\nhis rival's return. He was compensated for the slight put upon him by\r\nreceiving his long-deferred consecration to Norwich at the hands of the\r\npope. There is small reason for believing that he was exceptionally\r\ngreedy or unpopular. But his withdrawal removed an influence which had\r\ndone its work for good, and was becoming a national danger. Langton\r\nhenceforth could act as the real head of the English Church. In 1222,\r\nhe held an important provincial council at Oseney abbey, near Oxford,\r\nwhere he issued constitutions, famous as the first provincial canons\r\nstill recognised as binding in our ecclesiastical courts. He began once\r\nmore to concern himself with affairs of state, and Hubert found him a\r\nsure ally. Bishop Peter, disgusted with his declining influence,\r\nwelcomed his appointment as archbishop of the crusading Church at\r\nDamietta. He took the cross, and left England with Falkes de Bréauté as\r\nhis companion. Learning that the crescent had driven the cross out of\r\nhis new see, he contented himself with making the pilgrimage to\r\nCompostella, and soon found his way back to England, where he sought\r\nfor opportunities to regain power.\r\n\r\nRelieved of the opposition of Bishop Peter, Hubert insisted on\r\ndepriving barons of doubtful loyalty of the custody of royal castles,\r\nand found his chief opponent in William Earl of Albemarle. In dignity\r\nand possessions, Albemarle was not ill-qualified to be a feudal leader.\r\nThe son of William de Fors, of Oléron, a Poitevin adventurer of the\r\ntype of Falkes de Bréauté, he represented, through his mother, the line\r\nof the counts of Aumâle, who had since the Conquest ruled over\r\nHolderness from their castle at Skipsea. The family acquired the status\r\nof English earls under Stephen, retaining their foreign title,\r\nexpressed in English in the form of Albemarle, being the first house of\r\ncomital rank abroad to hold an earldom with a French name unassociated\r\nwith any English shire. During the civil war Albemarle's\r\ntergiversations, which rivalled those of the Geoffrey de Mandeville of\r\nStephen's time, had been rewarded by large grants from the victorious\r\nparty. Since 1219 he suffered slight upon slight, and in 1220 was\r\nstripped of the custody of Rockingham Castle. Late in that year Hubert\r\nresolved to enforce an order, promulgated in 1217, which directed\r\nAlbemarle to restore to his former subtenant Bytham Castle, in South\r\nKesteven, of which he was overlord, and of which he had resumed\r\npossession on account of the treason of his vassal. The earl hurried\r\naway in indignation from the king's Christmas court, and in January,\r\n1221, threw himself into Bytham, eager to hold it by force against the\r\nking. For a brief space he ruled over the country-side after the\r\nfashion of a baron of Stephen's time. He plundered the neighbouring\r\ntowns and churches, and filled the dungeons of Castle Bytham with\r\ncaptives. On the pretext of attending a council at Westminster he\r\nmarched southwards, but his real motive was disclosed when he suddenly\r\nattacked the castle of Fotheringhay. His men crossed the moat on the\r\nice, and, burning down the great gate, easily overpowered the scanty\r\ngarrison. \"As if he were the only ruler of the kingdom,\" says the Canon\r\nof Barnwell, \"he sent letters signed with his seal to the mayors of the\r\ncities of England, granting his peace to all merchants engaged in\r\nplying their trades, and allowing them free licence of going and coming\r\nthrough his castles.\" Nothing in the annals of the time puts more\r\nclearly this revival of the old feudal custom that each baron should\r\nlord it as king over his own estates.\r\n\r\nAlbemarle's power did not last long. He incurred the wrath of the\r\nChurch, and both in Kesteven and in Northamptonshire set himself\r\nagainst the interests of Randolph of Chester. Before January was over\r\nPandulf excommunicated him, and a great council granted a special\r\nscutage, \"the scutage of Bytham,\" to equip an army to crush the rebel.\r\nEarly in February a considerable force marched northwards against him.\r\nThe Earl of Chester took part in the campaign, and both the legate and\r\nthe king accompanied the army. Before the combined efforts of Church\r\nand State, Albemarle dared not hold his ground, and fled to Fountains,\r\nwhere he took sanctuary. His followers abandoned Fotheringhay, but\r\nstood a siege at Bytham. After six days this castle was captured on\r\nFebruary 8. Even then secret sympathisers with Albemarle were able to\r\nexercise influence on his behalf, and Pandulf himself was willing to\r\nshow mercy. The earl came out of sanctuary, and was pardoned on\r\ncondition of taking the crusader's vow. No effort was made to insist on\r\nhis going on crusade, and within a few months he was again in favour.\r\n\"Thus,\" says Roger of Wendover, \"the king set the worst of examples,\r\nand encouraged future rebellions.\" Randolph of Chester came out with\r\nthe spoils of victory. He secured as the price of his ostentatious\r\nfidelity the custody of the Honour of Huntingdon, during the nonage of\r\nthe earl, his nephew, John the Scot.\r\n\r\nA tumult in the capital soon taught Hubert that he had other foes to\r\nfight against besides the feudal party. At a wrestling match, held on\r\nJuly 25, 1222, between the city and the suburbs, the citizens won an\r\neasy victory. The tenants of the Abbot of Westminster challenged the\r\nconquerors to a fresh contest on August 1 at Westminster. But the\r\nabbot's men were more anxious for revenge than good sport, and seeing\r\nthat the Londoners were likely to win, they violently broke up the\r\nmatch. Suspecting no evil, the citizens had come without arms, and were\r\nvery severely handled by their rivals. Driven back behind their walls,\r\nthe Londoners clamoured for vengeance. Serlo the mercer, their mayor, a\r\nprudent and peace-loving man, urged them to seek compensation of the\r\nabbot. But the citizens preferred the advice of Constantine FitzAthulf,\r\nwho insisted upon an immediate attack on the men of Westminster. Next\r\nday the abbey precincts were invaded, and much mischief was done. The\r\nalarm was the greater because Constantine was a man of high position,\r\nwho had recently been a sheriff of London, and had once been a\r\nstrenuous supporter of Louis of France. It was rumoured that his\r\nfollowers had raised the cry, \"Montjoie! Saint Denis!\" The quarrels of\r\nneighbouring cities were as dangerous to sound rule as the feuds of\r\nrival barons, and Hubert took instant measures to put down the\r\nsedition. With the aid of Falkes de Bréauté's mercenaries, order was\r\nrestored, and Constantine was led before the justiciar. Early next day\r\nFalkes assembled his forces, and crossed the river to Southwark. He\r\ntook with him Constantine and two of his supporters, and hanged all\r\nthree, without form of trial, before the city knew anything about it.\r\nThen Falkes and his soldiers rushed through the streets, capturing,\r\nmutilating, and frightening away the citizens. Constantine's houses and\r\nproperty were seized by the king. The weak Serlo was deposed from the\r\nmayoralty, and the city taken into the king's hands. It was the last\r\ntime that Hubert and Falkes worked together, and something of the\r\nviolence of the _condottiere_ captain sullied the justiciar's\r\nreputation. As the murderer of Constantine, Hubert was henceforth\r\npursued with the undying hatred of the Londoners.\r\n\r\nDuring the next two years parties became clearly defined. Hubert more\r\nand more controlled the royal policy, and strove to strengthen both his\r\nmaster and himself by marriage alliances. Powerful husbands were sought\r\nfor the king's three sisters. On June 19, 1221, Joan, Henry's second\r\nsister, was married to the young Alexander of Scotland, at York. At the\r\nsame time Hubert, a widower by Isabella of Gloucester's death, wedded\r\nAlexander's elder sister, Margaret, a match which compensated the\r\njusticiar for his loss of Isabella's lands. Four years later, Isabella,\r\nthe King of Scot's younger sister, was united with Roger Bigod, the\r\nyoung Earl of Norfolk, a grandson of the great William Marshal, whose\r\neldest son and successor, William Marshal the younger, was in 1224\r\nmarried to the king's third sister, Eleanor. The policy of\r\nintermarriage between the royal family and the baronage was defended by\r\nthe example of Philip Augustus in France, and on the ground of the\r\ndanger to the royal interests if so strong a magnate as the earl\r\nmarshal were enticed away from his allegiance by an alliance with a\r\nhouse unfriendly to Henry.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] _Royal Letters_, i., 244-46.\r\n\r\nThe futility of marriage alliances in modifying policy was already made\r\nclear by the attitude of Llewelyn ap Iorwerth, the husband of Henry's\r\nbastard sister Joan. This resourceful prince had already raised himself\r\nto a high position by a statecraft which lacked neither strength nor\r\nduplicity. Though fully conscious of his position as the champion of a\r\nproud nation, and, posing as the peer of the King of Scots, Llewelyn\r\nsaw that it was his interest to continue the friendship with the\r\nbaronial opposition which had profited him so greatly in the days of\r\nthe French invasion. The pacification arranged in 1218 sat rightly upon\r\nhim, and he plunged into a war with William Marshal the younger that\r\ndesolated South Wales for several years. In 1219 Llewelyn devastated\r\nPembrokeshire so cruelly that the marshal's losses were currently,\r\nthough absurdly, reported to have exceeded the amount of the ransom of\r\nKing Richard. There was much more fighting, but Llewelyn's progress was\r\nimpeded by difficulties with his own son Griffith, and with the princes\r\nof South Wales, who bore impatiently the growing hold of the lord of\r\nGwynedd upon the affections of southern Welshmen. There was war also in\r\nthe middle march, where in 1220 a royal army was assembled against\r\nLlewelyn; but Pandulf negotiated a truce, and the only permanent result\r\nof this effort was the fortification of the castle and town at\r\nMontgomery, which had become royal demesne on the extinction of the\r\nancient house of Bollers a few years earlier. But peace never lasted\r\nlong west of the Severn, and in 1222 William Marshal drove Llewelyn out\r\nof Cardigan and Carmarthen. Again there were threats of war. Llewelyn\r\nwas excommunicated, and his lands put under interdict. The marshal\r\ncomplained bitterly of the poor support which Henry gave him against\r\nthe Welsh, but Hubert restored cordiality between him and the king. In\r\nthese circumstances the policy of marrying Eleanor to the indignant\r\nmarcher was a wise one. Llewelyn however could still look to the active\r\nfriendship of Randolph of Chester. While the storm of war raged in\r\nSouth Wales, the march between Cheshire and Gwynedd enjoyed unwonted\r\npeace, and in 1223 a truce was patched up through Randolph's mediation.\r\n\r\nEarl Randolph needed the Welsh alliance the more because he definitely\r\nthrew in his lot with the enemies of Hubert de Burgh. In April, 1223, a\r\nbull of Honorius III. declared Henry competent to govern in his own\r\nname, a change which resulted in a further strengthening of Hubert's\r\npower. Towards the end of the year Randolph joined with William of\r\nAlbemarle, the Bishop of Winchester and Falkes de Bréauté, in an\r\nattempt to overthrow the justiciar. The discontented barons took arms\r\nand laid their grievances before the king. They wished, they said, no\r\nill to king or kingdom, but simply desired to remove the justiciar from\r\nhis counsels. Hot words passed between the indignant Hubert and Peter\r\ndes Roches, and the conference broke up in confusion. The barons still\r\nremained mutinous, and, while the king held his Christmas court at\r\nNorthampton, they celebrated the feast at Leicester. At last Langton\r\npersuaded both parties to come to an agreement on the basis of king's\r\nfriends and barons alike surrendering their castles and wardships. This\r\nwas a substantial victory for the party of order, and during the next\r\nfew months much was done to transfer the castles to loyal hands.\r\nRandolph himself surrendered Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth.\r\n\r\nComparative peace having been restored, and the judicial bench purged\r\nof feudal partisans, private persons ventured to complain of outrageous\r\nacts of \"novel disseisin\", or unlawful appropriation of men's lands. In\r\nthe spring of 1224 the king's justices went throughout the country,\r\nhearing and deciding pleas of this sort. Sixteen acts of novel\r\ndisseisin were proved against Falkes de Bréauté. Despite all the\r\nefforts of Langton and Hubert, that able adventurer, though stripped of\r\nsome of his castles, fully maintained the position which he first\r\nacquired in the service of John. He was not the man to put up tamely\r\nwith the piecemeal destruction of his power by legal process, and,\r\nbacked up secretly by the feudal leaders, resolved to take the law into\r\nhis own hands. One of the most active of the judges in hearing\r\ncomplaints against him was Henry of Braybrook. Falkes bade his brother,\r\nWilliam de Bréauté fall upon the justice, who had been hearing suits at\r\nDunstable, and take him prisoner. William faithfully fulfilled his\r\nbrother's orders, and on June 17 the unlucky judge was safely shut up\r\nin a dungeon of Bedford Castle, of which William had the custody, as\r\nhis brother's agent. So daring an outrage on the royal authority was\r\nworse than the action of William of Albemarle four years before. Hubert\r\nand the archbishop immediately took strong measures to enforce the\r\nsanctity of the law. While Langton excommunicated Falkes and his\r\nabettors, Hubert hastily turned against the traitor the forces which\r\nwere assembling at Northampton with the object of reconquering Poitou.\r\nBraybrook was captured on Monday. On Thursday the royal troops besieged\r\nBedford.\r\n\r\nThe siege lasted from June 20 to August 14. The \"noble castle of\r\nBedford\" was new, large, and fortified with an inner and outer baily,\r\nand two strong towers. Falkes trusted that it would hold out for a year,\r\nand had amply provided it with provisions and munitions of war. In\r\neffect, though William de Bréauté and his followers showed a gallant\r\nspirit, it resisted the justiciar for barely two months. When called\r\nupon to surrender the garrison answered that they would only yield at\r\ntheir lord's orders, and that the more as they were not bound to the\r\nking by homage or fealty. Nothing was left but a fight to the death. The\r\nroyalists made strenuous efforts. A new scutage, the \"scutage of\r\nBedford,\" was imposed on the realm. Meanwhile Falkes fled to his\r\naccomplice, the Earl of Chester, and afterwards took refuge with\r\nLlewelyn. But the adventurer found such cold comfort from the great men\r\nwho had lured him to his ruin that he perforce made his way back to\r\nEngland, along with a motley band of followers, English and French,\r\nScottish and Welsh.[1] A hue and cry was raised after him, and, like\r\nWilliam of Albemarle, he was forced to throw himself into sanctuary,\r\nwhile Randolph of Chester openly joined the besiegers of Bedford. In his\r\nrefuge in a church at Coventry, Falkes was persuaded to surrender to the\r\nbishop of the diocese, who handed him over to Langton.\r\n\r\n    [1] The names of his _familia_ taken with him are in _Patent\r\n    Rolls of Henry III._, 1216-1227, pp. 461-62.\r\n\r\nDuring Falkes's wanderings his brother had been struggling valiantly\r\nagainst overwhelming odds. _Petrariae_ and mangonels threw huge stones\r\ninto the castle, and effected breaches in keep and curtain. Miners\r\nundermined the walls, while over-against the stronghold two lofty\r\nstructures of wood were raised, from which the crossbowmen, who manned\r\nthem, were able to command the whole of the interior. At last the\r\ncastle was captured in four successive assaults. In the first the\r\nbarbican was taken; in the next the outer baily was stormed; in the\r\nthird the interior baily was won; and in the last the keep was split\r\nasunder. The garrison then allowed the women and captives, including\r\nthe wife of Falkes and the unlucky Braybrook, to make their way to the\r\nenemies' lines. Next day the defenders themselves surrendered. The only\r\nmercy shown to these gallant men was that they were allowed to make\r\ntheir peace with the Church before their execution. Of the eighty\r\nprisoners, three Templars alone were spared.\r\n\r\nFalkes threw himself upon the king's mercy, appealing to his former\r\nservices to Henry and his father. He surrendered to the King the large\r\nsums of money which he had deposited with his bankers, the Templars of\r\nLondon, and ordered his castellans in Plympton and the other\r\nwest-country castles of his wife to open their gates to the royal\r\nofficers. In return for these concessions he was released from\r\nexcommunication. His life was spared, but his property was confiscated,\r\nand he was ordered to abjure the realm. Even his wife deserted him,\r\nprotesting that she had been forced to marry him against her will. On\r\nOctober 26 he received letters of safe conduct to go beyond sea. As he\r\nleft England, he protested that he had been instigated by the English\r\nmagnates in all that he had done. On landing at Fécamp he was detained\r\nby his old enemy Louis, then, by his father's death, King of France.\r\nBut Louis VIII. was the last man to bear old grudges against the Norman\r\nadventurer, especially as Falkes's rising had enabled him to capture\r\nthe chief towns of Poitou.\r\n\r\nEven in his exile Falkes was still able to do mischief. He obtained his\r\nrelease from Louis' prison about Easter, 1225, on the pretence of going\r\non crusade. He then made his way to Rome where he strove to excite the\r\nsympathy of Honorius III., by presenting an artful memorial, which\r\nthrows a flood of light upon his character, motives, and hopes.\r\nHonorius earnestly pleaded for his restitution, but Hubert and Langton\r\nstood firm against him. They urged that the pope had been misinformed,\r\nand declined to recall the exile. Honorius sent his chaplain Otto to\r\nEngland, but the nuncio found it impossible to modify the policy of the\r\nadvisers of the king. Falkes went back from Italy to Troyes, where he\r\nwaited for a year in the hope that his sentence would be reversed. At\r\nlast Otto gave up his cause in despair, and devoted himself to the more\r\nprofitable work of exacting money from the English clergy. Falkes died\r\nin 1226. With him disappears from our history the lawless spirit which\r\nhad troubled the land since the war between John and his barons. The\r\nforeign adventurers, of whom he was the chief, either went back in\r\ndisgust to their native lands, or, like Peter de Mauley, became loyal\r\nsubjects and the progenitors of a harmless stock of English barons. The\r\nten years of storm and stress were over. The administration was once\r\nmore in English hands, and Hubert enjoyed a few years of well-earned\r\npower.\r\n\r\nNew difficulties at once arose. The defeat of the feudalists and their\r\nWelsh allies involved heavy special taxation, and the king's honour\r\nrequired that an effort should be made both to wrest Poitou from Louis\r\nVIII., and to strengthen the English hold over Gascony. Besides\r\nnational obligations, clergy and laity alike were still called upon to\r\ncontribute towards the cost of crusading enterprises, and in 1226 the\r\npapal nuncio, Otto, demanded that a large proportion of the revenues of\r\nthe English clergy should be contributed to the papal coffers. To the\r\nEnglishman of that age all extraordinary taxation was a grievance quite\r\nirrespective of its necessity. The double incidence of the royal and\r\npapal demands was met by protests which showed some tendency towards\r\nthe splitting up of the victorious side into parties. It was still easy\r\nfor all to unite against Otto, and the papal agent was forced to go\r\nhome empty handed, for councils both of clergy and barons agreed to\r\nreject his demands. Whatever other nations might offer to the pope,\r\nargued the magnates, the realms of England and Ireland at least had a\r\nright to be freed from such impositions by reason of the tribute which\r\nJohn had agreed to pay to Innocent III. The demand of the king's\r\nministers for a fifteenth to prosecute the war with France was\r\nreluctantly conceded, but only on the condition of a fresh confirmation\r\nof the charters in a form intended to bring home to the king his\r\npersonal obligation to observe them. Hubert de Burgh, however, was no\r\nenthusiast for the charters. His standpoint was that of the officials\r\nof the age of Henry II. To him the re-establishment of order meant the\r\nrestoration of the prerogative. There he parted company with the\r\narchbishop, who was an eager upholder of the charters, for which he was\r\nso largely responsible. The struggle against the foreigner was to be\r\nsucceeded by a struggle for the charters.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1227, a council met at Oxford. The king, then nearly twenty\r\nyears old, declared that he would govern the country himself, and\r\nrenounced the tutelage of the Bishop of Winchester. Henry gave himself\r\nover completely to the justiciar, whom he rewarded for his faithful\r\nservice by making him Earl of Kent. In deep disgust Bishop Peter left\r\nthe court to carry out his long-deferred crusading vows. For four years\r\nhe was absent in Palestine, where his military talents had ample scope\r\nas one of the leaders of Frederick II.'s army, while his diplomatic\r\nskill sought, with less result, to preserve some sort of relations\r\nbetween the excommunicated emperor and the new pope, Gregory IX., who\r\nin this same year succeeded Honorius. In April Gregory renewed the bull\r\nof 1223 in which his predecessor recognised Henry's competence to\r\ngovern.\r\n\r\nThus ended the first minority since the Conquest. The successful\r\nrestoration of law and order when the king was a child, showed that a\r\nstrong king was not absolutely necessary for good government. From the\r\nexercise of royal authority by ministers without the personal\r\nintervention of the monarch arose the ideas of limited monarchy, the\r\nresponsibility of the official, and the constitutional rights of the\r\nbaronial council to appoint ministers and control the administration.\r\nWe also discern, almost for the first time, the action of an inner\r\nministerial council which was ultimately to develop into the _consilium\r\nordinarium_ of a later age.\r\n\r\nNo sudden changes attended the royal majority. Those who had persuaded\r\nHenry to dismiss Bishop Peter had no policy beyond getting rid of a\r\nhated rival. The new Earl of Kent continued to hold office as justiciar\r\nfor five years, and his ascendency is even more marked in the years\r\n1227 to 1232 than it had been between 1224 and 1227. Hubert still found\r\nthe task of ruling England by no means easy. With the mitigation of\r\nhome troubles foreign affairs assumed greater importance, and England's\r\ndifficulties with France, the efforts to establish cordial relations\r\nwith the empire, the ever-increasing aggressions of Llewelyn of Wales,\r\nand the chronic troubles of Ireland, involved the country in large\r\nexpenses with little compensating advantage. Not less uneasy were the\r\nresults of the growing encroachments of the papacy and the increasing\r\ninability of the English clergy to face them. Papal taxation, added to\r\nthe burden of national taxation, induced discontent that found a ready\r\nscapegoat in the justiciar. The old and the new baronial opposition\r\ncombined to denounce Hubert as the true cause of all evils. The\r\nincreasing personal influence of the young king complicated the\r\nsituation. In his efforts to deal with all these problems Hubert became\r\ninvolved in the storm of obloquy which finally brought about his fall.\r\n\r\nAt the accession of Henry III., the truce for five years concluded\r\nbetween his father and Philip Augustus on September 18, 1214, had still\r\nthree years to run. The expedition of Louis to England might well seem\r\nto have broken it, but the prudent disavowal by Philip II. of his son's\r\nsacrilegious enterprise made it a point of policy for the French King\r\nto regard it as still in force, and neither John nor the earl marshal\r\nhad a mind to face the enmity of the father as well as the invasion of\r\nthe son. Accordingly the truce ran out its full time, and in 1220\r\nHonorius III., ever zealous for peace between Christian sovereigns,\r\nprocured its prolongation for four years. Before this had expired, the\r\naccession of Louis VIII. in 1223 raised the old enemy of King Henry to\r\nthe throne of France. Louis still coveted the English throne, and\r\ndesired to complete the conquest of Henry's French dominions in France.\r\nHis accession soon involved England in a new struggle, luckily delayed\r\nuntil the worst of the disorders at home had been overcome.\r\n\r\nPeace was impossible because Louis, like Philip, regarded the\r\nforfeiture of John as absolute, and as involving the right to deny to\r\nHenry III. a legitimate title to any of his lands beyond sea. Henry, on\r\nthe other hand, was still styled Duke of Normandy, Count of Anjou,\r\nCount of Poitou, and Duke of Aquitaine. Claiming all that his father\r\nhad held, he refused homage to Philip or Louis for such French lands as\r\nhe actually possessed. For the first time since the Conquest, an\r\nEnglish king ruled over extensive French territories without any feudal\r\nsubjection to the King of France. However, Henry's French lands, though\r\nstill considerable, were but a shadow of those once ruled by his\r\nfather. Philip had conquered all Normandy, save the Channel Islands,\r\nand also the whole of Anjou and Touraine. For a time he also gained\r\npossession of Poitou, but before his death nearly the whole of that\r\nregion had slipped from his grasp. Poitiers, alone of its great towns,\r\nremained in French hands. For the rest, both the barons and cities of\r\nPoitou acknowledged the over-lordship of their English count. Too much\r\nimportance must not be ascribed to this revival of the English power.\r\nHenry claimed very little domain in Poitou, which practically was\r\ndivided between the feudal nobles and the great communes. So long as\r\nthey maintained a virtual freedom, they were indifferent as to their\r\noverlord. If they easily transferred their allegiance from Philip to\r\nHenry, it was because the weakness of absentee counts was less to be\r\ndreaded than the strength of a monarch near at hand. Meanwhile the\r\nbarons carried on their feuds one against the other, and all alike\r\njoined in oppressing the townsmen.\r\n\r\nDuring Henry's minority the crown was not strong enough to deal with\r\nthe unruly Foitevins. Seneschals quickly succeeded each other; the\r\nbarons expected the office to be filled by one of their own order, and\r\nthe towns, jealous of hostile neighbours, demanded the appointment of\r\nan Englishman. At last, in 1221, Savary de Mauléon, one of King John's\r\nmercenaries, a poet, and a crusader against infidels and Albigenses,\r\nwas made seneschal. His English estates ensured some measure of\r\nfidelity, and his energy and experience were guarantees of his\r\ncompetence, though, as a younger member of the great house of Thouars,\r\nhe belonged by birth to the inner circle of the Poitevin nobility,\r\nwhose treachery, levity, and self-seeking were proverbial. The powerful\r\nViscounts of Thouars were constantly kept in check by their traditional\r\nenemies the Counts of La Marche, whose representative, Hugh of\r\nLusignan, was by far the strongest of the local barons. His cousin, and\r\nsometime betrothed, Isabella, Countess of Angoulême, the widow of King\r\nJohn, had left England to resume the administration of her dominions.\r\nEarly in 1220 she married Hugh, justifying herself to her son on the\r\nground that it would be dangerous to his interests if the Count of La\r\nMarche should contract an alliance with the French party. But this was\r\nmere excuse. The union of La Marche and Angoulême largely increased\r\nCount Hugh's power, and he showed perfect impartiality in pursuing his\r\nown interests by holding a balance between his stepson and the King of\r\nFrance. Against him neither Savary nor the Poitevin communes could\r\ncontend with success. The anarchy of Poitou was an irresistible\r\ntemptation to Louis VII. \"Know you,\" he wrote to the men of Limoges,\r\n\"that John, king of England, was deprived by the unanimous judgment of\r\nhis peers of all the lands which he held of our father Philip. We have\r\nnow received in inheritance all our father's rights, and require you to\r\nperform the service that you owe us.\" While the English government\r\nweakly negotiated for the prolongation of the truce, and for the pope's\r\nintervention, Louis concluded treaties with the Poitevin barons, and\r\nmade ready an army to conquer his inheritance. Foremost among his local\r\npartisans appeared Henry's stepfather.\r\n\r\nThe French army met at Tours on June 24, 1224, and marched through\r\nThouars to La Rochelle, the strongest of the Poitevin towns, and the\r\nmost devoted to England. On the way Louis forced Savary de Mauléon to\r\nyield up Niort, and to promise to defend no other place than La\r\nRochelle, before which city he sat down on July 15. At first Savary\r\nresisted vigorously. The siege of Bedford, however, prevented the\r\ndespatch of effective help from England, and Savary was perhaps already\r\nsecretly won over by Louis. Be this as it may, the town surrendered on\r\nAugust 3, and with it went all Aquitaine north of the Dordogne. Savary\r\ntook service with the conqueror, and was made warden of La Rochelle and\r\nof the adjacent coasts, while Lusignan received the reward of his\r\ntreachery in a grant of the Isle of Oléron. When Louis returned to the\r\nnorth, the Count of La Marche undertook the conquest of Gascony. He\r\nsoon made himself master of St. Emilion, and of the whole of Périgord.\r\nThe surrender of La Réole opened up the passage of the Garonne, and the\r\ncapture of Bazas gave the French a foothold to the south of that river.\r\nOnly the people of Bordeaux showed any spirit in resisting Hugh. But\r\ntheir resistance proved sufficient, and he withdrew baffled before\r\ntheir walls.\r\n\r\nThe easiness of Louis' conquests showed their instability. \"I am sure,\"\r\nwrote one of Henry's officers, \"that you can easily recover all that you\r\nhave lost, if you send speedy succour to these regions.\" After the\r\ncapture of Bedford, Hubert undertook the recovery of Poitou and the\r\ndefence of Gascony. Henry's younger brother Richard, a youth of sixteen,\r\nwas appointed Earl of Cornwall and Count of Poitou, dubbed knight by his\r\nbrother, and put in nominal command of the expedition despatched to\r\nGascony in March, 1225. His experienced uncle, William Longsword, Earl\r\nof Salisbury, and Philip of Aubigny, were sent with him as his chief\r\ncounsellors. Received with open arms by Bordeaux, he boasted on May 2\r\nthat he had conquered all Gascony, save La Réole, and had received the\r\nallegiance of every Gascon noble, except Elie Rudel, the lord of\r\nBergerac. The siege of La Réole, the only serious military operation of\r\nthe campaign, occupied Richard all the summer and autumn, and it was not\r\nuntil November 13 that the burgesses opened their gates. As soon as the\r\nFrench had retired, the lord of Bergerac, \"after the fashion of the\r\nPoitevins,\" renounced Louis and professed himself the liegeman of Earl\r\nRichard. Then the worst trouble was that Savary de Mauléon's ships\r\ncommanded the Bay of Biscay, and rendered communication between Bordeaux\r\nand England very difficult.[1] Once more the men of the Cinque Ports\r\ncame to the king's aid, and there was severe fighting at sea, involving\r\nmuch plunder of merchant vessels and dislocation of trade.\r\n\r\n    [1] The names of his _familia_ taken with him are in _Patent\r\n    Rolls of Henry III._, 1216-1227, pp. 461-62.\r\n\r\nThe English sought to supplement their military successes by diplomacy.\r\nRichard of Cornwall made an alliance with the counts of Auvergne, and\r\nthe home administration negotiated with all possible enemies of the\r\nFrench King. A proposal to affiance Henry's sister, Isabella, to Henry,\r\nKing of the Romans, the infant son of Frederick II., led to no results,\r\nfor the Archbishop of Cologne, the chief upholder of the scheme in\r\nGermany, was murdered, and the young king found a bride in Austria. Yet\r\nthe project counteracted the negotiations set on foot by Louis to\r\nsecure Frederick II. for his own side, and induced the Emperor to take\r\nup a position of neutrality. An impostor appeared in Flanders who gave\r\nout that he was the old Count Baldwin, sometime Latin Emperor of the\r\nEast, who had died in prison in Bulgaria twenty years before. Baldwin's\r\ndaughter, Joan, appealed to Louis for support against the false\r\nBaldwin, whereupon Henry recognised his claims and sought his alliance.\r\nNothing but the capture and execution of the impostor prevented Henry\r\nfrom effecting a powerful diversion in Flanders. Peter Mauclerc, Count\r\nof Brittany, was won over by an offer of restitution to his earldom of\r\nRichmond, and by a promise that Henry would marry his daughter Iolande.\r\nIntrigues were entered into with the discontented Norman nobles, and\r\nthe pope was importuned to save Henry from French assaults at the same\r\nmoment that the king made a treaty of alliance with his first cousin,\r\nthe heretical Raymond VII. of Toulouse. Honorius gave his ward little\r\nsave sympathy and good advice. His special wish was to induce Louis to\r\nlead a French expedition into Languedoc against the Albigensian\r\nheretics. As soon as Louis resolved on this, the pope sought to prevent\r\nHenry from entering into unholy alliance with Raymond. It was the\r\ncrusade of 1226, not the good-will of the Pope or the fine-drawn\r\nEnglish negotiations, which gave Gascony a short respite. Louis VIII.\r\ndied on November 8 in the course of his expedition, and the Capetian\r\nmonarchy became less dangerous during the troubles of a minority, in\r\nwhich his widow, Blanche, strove as regent to uphold the throne of\r\ntheir little son, Louis IX.\r\n\r\nThe first months of Louis IX.'s reign showed how unstable was any\r\nedifice built upon the support of the treacherous lords of Poitou.\r\nWithin six weeks of Louis VIII.'s death, Hugh of Lusignan, the viscount\r\nof Thouars, Savary de Mauléon, and many other Poitevin barons,\r\nconcluded treaties with Richard of Cornwall, by which in return for\r\nlavish concessions they went back to the English obedience. In the\r\nspring of 1227, however, the appearance of a French army south of the\r\nLoire caused these same lords to make fresh treaties with Blanche.\r\nPeter of Brittany also became friendly with the French regent, and gave\r\nup his daughter's English marriage. With allies so shifty, further\r\ndealings seemed hopeless. Before Easter, Richard patched up a truce and\r\nwent home in disgust. The Capetians lost Poitou, but Henry failed to\r\ntake advantage of his rival's weakness, and the real masters of the\r\nsituation were the local barons. Fifteen more years were to elapse\r\nbefore the definitive French conquest of Poitou.\r\n\r\nDuring the next three years the good understanding between the Bretons,\r\nthe Poitevins, and the regent Blanche came to an end, and the progress\r\nof the feudal reaction against the rule of the young King of France\r\nonce more excited hopes of improving Henry's position in south-western\r\nFrance. Henry III. was eager to win back his inheritance, though Hubert\r\nde Burgh had little faith in Poitevin promises, and, conscious of his\r\nking's weakness, managed to prolong the truce, until July 22, 1229.\r\nThree months before that, Blanche succeeded in forcing the unfortunate\r\nRaymond VII. to accept the humiliating treaty of Meaux, which assured\r\nthe succession to his dominions to her second son Alfonse, who was to\r\nmarry his daughter and heiress, Joan. The barons of the north and west\r\nwere not yet defeated, and once more appealed to Henry to come to their\r\naid. Accordingly, the English king summoned his vassals to Portsmouth\r\non October 15 for a French campaign. When Henry went down to Portsmouth\r\nhe found that there were not enough ships to convey his troops over\r\nsea. Thereupon he passionately denounced the justiciar as an \"old\r\ntraitor,\" and accused him of being bribed by the French queen. Nothing\r\nbut the intervention of Randolph of Chester, Hubert's persistent enemy,\r\nput an end to the undignified scene.\r\n\r\nCount Peter of Brittany, who arrived at Portsmouth on the 9th, did\r\nhomage to Henry as King of France, and received the earldom of Richmond\r\nand the title of Duke of Brittany which he had long coveted, but which\r\nthe French government refused to recognise. He persuaded Henry to\r\npostpone the expedition until the following spring. When that time came\r\nHenry appointed Ralph Neville, the chancellor, and Stephen Segrave, a\r\nrising judge, as wardens of England, and on May 1, 1230, set sail from\r\nPortsmouth. It was the first time since 1213 that an English king had\r\ncrossed the seas at the head of an army, and every effort was made to\r\nequip a sufficient force. Hubert the justiciar, Randolph of Chester,\r\nWilliam the marshal, and most of the great barons personally shared in\r\nthe expedition, and the ports of the Channel, the North Sea, and the\r\nBay of Biscay were ransacked to provide adequate shipping. Many Norman\r\nvessels served as transports, apparently of their owners' free-will.\r\n\r\nOn May 3 Henry landed at St. Malo, and thence proceeded to Dinan, the\r\nmeeting-place assigned for his army, the greater part of which landed at\r\nPort Blanc, a little north of Tréguier. Peter Mauclerc joined him, and a\r\nplan of operations was discussed. The moment was favourable, for a great\r\nnumber of the French magnates were engaged in war against Theobald, the\r\npoet-count of Champagne, and the French army, which was assembled at\r\nAngers, represented but a fraction of the military strength of the land.\r\nFulk Paynel, a Norman baron who wished to revive the independence of the\r\nduchy, urged Henry to invade Normandy. Hubert successfully withstood\r\nthis rash proposal, and also Fulk's fatal suggestion that Henry should\r\ndivide his army and send two hundred knights for the invasion of\r\nNormandy. Before long the English marched through Brittany to Nantes,\r\nwhere they wasted six weeks. At last, on the advice of Hubert, they\r\njourneyed south into Poitou. The innate Poitevin instability had again\r\nbrought round the Lusignans, the house of Thouars, and their kind to the\r\nFrench side, and Henry found that his own mother did her best to\r\nobstruct his progress. He was too strong to make open resistance safe,\r\nand his long progress from Nantes to Bordeaux was only once checked by\r\nthe need to fight his way. This opposition came from the little town and\r\ncastle of Mirambeau, situated in Upper Saintonge, rather more than\r\nhalf-way between Saintes and Blaye.[1] From July 21 to 30 Mirambeau\r\nstoutly held out, but Henry's army was reinforced by the chivalry of\r\nGascony, and by a siege-train borrowed from Bordeaux and the loyal lords\r\nof the Garonne. Against such appliances of warfare Mirambeau could not\r\nlong resist. On its capitulation Henry pushed on to Bordeaux.\r\n\r\n    [1] E. Berger, _Bibl. Ecole des Chartes_, 1893, _pp. 35-36_,\r\n    shows that Mirambeau, not Mirebeau, was besieged by Henry; see\r\n    also his _Blanche de Castille_ (1895).\r\n\r\nUseless as the march through Poitou had been, it was then repeated in\r\nthe reverse way. With scarcely a week's rest, Henry left the Gascon\r\ncapital on August 10, and on September 15 ended his inglorious campaign\r\nat Nantes. Although he was unable to assert himself against the\r\nfaithless Poitevins, the barons of the province were equally impotent\r\nto make head against him. On reaching Brittany, Hubert once more\r\nstopped further military efforts. After a few days' rest at Nantes,\r\nHenry made his way by slow stages through the heart of Brittany. It was\r\nsaid that his army had no better occupation than teaching the local\r\nnobles to drink deep after the English fashion. The King had wasted all\r\nhis treasure, and the poorer knights were compelled to sell or pawn\r\ntheir horses and arms to support themselves. The farce ended when the\r\nKing sailed from St. Pol de Leon, and late in October landed at\r\nPortsmouth. He left a portion of his followers in Brittany, under the\r\nEarls of Chester and Pembroke. Randolph himself, as a former husband of\r\nConstance of Brittany, had claims to certain dower lands which\r\nappertained to Count Peter's mother-in-law. He was put in possession of\r\nSt. James de Beuvron, and thence he raided Normandy and Anjou. By this\r\ntime the coalition against the count of Champagne had broken down, and\r\nBlanche was again triumphant. It was useless to continue a struggle so\r\nexpensive and disastrous, and on July 4, 1231, a truce for three years\r\nwas concluded between France, Brittany, and England. Peter des Roches,\r\nthen returning through France from his crusade, took an active part in\r\nnegotiating the treaty. Just as the king was disposed to make the\r\njusticiar the scapegoat of his failure, Hubert's old enemy appeared\r\nonce more upon the scene. The responsibility for blundering must be\r\ndivided among the English magnates, and not ascribed solely to their\r\nmonarch. If Hubert saved Henry from reckless adventures, he certainly\r\ndeserves a large share of the blame for the Poitevin fiasco.\r\n\r\nThe grave situation at home showed the folly of this untimely revival\r\nof an active foreign policy. The same years that saw the collapse of\r\nHenry's hopes in Normandy and Poitou, witnessed troubles both in\r\nIreland and in Wales. In both these regions the house of the Marshals\r\nwas a menace to the neighbouring chieftains, and Hugh de Lacy, Earl of\r\nUlster, and Llewelyn ap Iorwerth, made common cause against it and\r\nvigorously attacked their rivals both in Leinster and in South Wales.\r\nNor was this the only disturbance. The summons of the Norman chieftains\r\nof Ireland to Poitou gave the king of Connaught a chance of attacking\r\nthe justiciar of Ireland, Geoffrey Marsh, who ultimately drove the\r\nIrish back with severe loss. Llewelyn was again as active and hostile\r\nas ever. Irritated by the growing strength of the new royal castle of\r\nMontgomery, he laid siege to it in 1228. Hubert de Burgh, then\r\ncastellan of Montgomery, could only save his castle by summoning the\r\nlevies of the kingdom. At their head Hubert went in person to hold the\r\nfield against Llewelyn, taking the king with him. The Welsh withdrew as\r\nusual before a regular army, and Hubert and the king, late in\r\nSeptember, marched a few miles westwards of Montgomery to the vale of\r\nKerry, where they erected a castle. But Llewelyn soon made the English\r\nposition in Kerry untenable. Many of the English lords were secretly in\r\nleague with him, and the army suffered severely from lack of food. In\r\nthe fighting that ensued the Welsh got the better of the English,\r\ntaking prisoner William de Braose, the heir of Builth, and one of the\r\ngreatest of the marcher lords. At last king and justiciar were glad to\r\nagree to demolish the new castle on receiving from Llewelyn the\r\nexpenses involved in the task. The dismantled ruin was called \"Hubert's\r\nfolly\". \"And then,\" boasts the Welsh chronicler, \"the king returned to\r\nEngland with shame.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1230 Llewelyn inflicted another slight upon his overlord. William de\r\nBraose long remained the Welsh prince's captive, and only purchased his\r\nliberty by agreeing to wed his daughter to Llewelyn's son, and\r\nsurrendering Builth as her marriage portion. The captive had employed\r\nhis leisure in winning the love of Llewelyn's wife, Joan, Henry's\r\nhalf-sister. At Easter, Llewelyn took a drastic revenge on the\r\nadulterer. He seized William in his own castle at Builth, and on May 2\r\nhanged him on a tree in open day in the presence of 900 witnesses.\r\nFinding that neither the king nor the marchers moved a finger to avenge\r\nthe outrage done to sister and comrade, Llewelyn took the aggressive in\r\nregions which had hitherto been comparatively exempt from his assaults.\r\nIn 1231 he laid his heavy hand on all South Wales, burning down\r\nchurches full of women, as the English believed, and signalling out for\r\nspecial attack the marshal's lands in Gwent and Pembroke. Once more the\r\nking penetrated with his barons into Mid Wales, while the pope and\r\narchbishop excommunicated Llewelyn and put his lands under interdict.\r\nYet neither temporal nor spiritual arms were of avail against the\r\nWelshman. Henry's only exploit in this, his second Welsh campaign, was\r\nto rebuild Maud's Castle in stone. He withdrew, and in December agreed\r\nto conclude a three years' truce, and procure Llewelyn's absolution.\r\nHubert once more bore the blame of his master's failure.\r\n\r\nOn July 9, 1228, Stephen Langton died. Despite their differences as to\r\nthe execution of the charters, his removal lost the justiciar a\r\nmuch-needed friend. Affairs were made worse by the unteachable folly of\r\nthe monks of Christ Church. Regardless of the severe warning which they\r\nhad received in the storms that preceded the establishment of Langton's\r\nauthority, the chapter forthwith proceeded to the election of their\r\nbrother monk, Walter of Eynsham. The archbishop-elect was an ignorant\r\nold monk of weak health and doubtful antecedents, and Gregory IX.\r\nwisely refused to confirm the election. On the recommendation of the\r\nking and the bishops, Gregory himself appointed as archbishop Richard,\r\nchancellor of Lincoln, an eloquent and learned secular priest of\r\nhandsome person, whose nickname of \"le Grand\" was due to his tall\r\nstature. The first Archbishop of Canterbury since the Conquest directly\r\nnominated by the pope--for even in Langton's case there was a form of\r\nelection--Richard le Grand at once began to quarrel with the justiciar,\r\ndemanding that he should surrender the custody of Tunbridge castle on\r\nthe ground of some ancient claim of the see of Canterbury. Failing to\r\nobtain redress in England, Richard betook himself to Rome in the spring\r\nof 1231. There he regaled the pope's ears with the offences of Hubert,\r\nand of the worldly bishops who were his tools. In August, Richard's\r\ndeath in Italy left the Church of Canterbury for three years without a\r\npastor.\r\n\r\nWhile Gregory IX. did more to help Henry against Louis than Honorius\r\nIII., the inflexible character and lofty hierarchical ideals of this\r\nnephew of Innocent III. made his hand heavier on the English Church\r\nthan that of his predecessor. Above all, Gregory's expenses in pursuing\r\nhis quarrel with Frederick II. made the wealth of the English Church a\r\nsore temptation to him. With his imposition of a tax of one-tenth on\r\nall clerical property to defray the expenses of the crusade against the\r\nemperor, papal taxation in England takes a newer and severer phase. The\r\nrigour with which Master Stephen, the pope's collector, extorted the\r\ntax was bitterly resented. Not less loud was the complaint against the\r\nincreasing numbers of foreign ecclesiastics forced into English\r\nbenefices by papal authority, and without regard for the rights of the\r\nlawful patrons and electors. A league of aggrieved tax-payers and\r\npatrons was formed against the Roman agents. At Eastertide, 1232, bands\r\nof men, headed by a knight named Robert Twenge, who took the nickname\r\nof William Wither, despoiled the Romans of their gains, and distributed\r\nthe proceeds to the poor. These doings were the more formidable from\r\ntheir excellent organisation, and the strong sympathy everywhere\r\nextended to them. Hubert, who hated foreign interference, did nothing\r\nto stop Twenge and his followers. His inaction further precipitated his\r\nruin. Archbishop Richard had already poisoned the pope's mind against\r\nhim, and his suspected connivance with the anti-Roman movement\r\ncompleted his disfavour. Bitter letters of complaint arrived in England\r\ndenouncing the outrages inflicted on the friends of the apostolic see.\r\nIt is hard to dissociate the pope's feeling in this matter from his\r\nrejection of the nomination of the king's chancellor, Ralph Neville,\r\nBishop of Chichester, to the see of Canterbury, as an illiterate\r\npolitician.\r\n\r\nThe dislike of the taxes made necessary by the Welsh and French wars,\r\nsuch as the \"scutage of Poitou\" and the \"scutage of Kerry,\" swelled the\r\noutcry against the justiciar. So far back as 1227 advantage had been\r\ntaken of Henry's majority to exact large sums of money for the\r\nconfirmation of all charters sealed during his nonage. The barons made\r\nit a grievance that his brother Richard was ill-provided for, and a\r\nrising in 1227 extorted a further provision for him from what was\r\nregarded as the niggardliness of the justiciar. Nor did Hubert, with\r\nall his rugged honesty, neglect his own interests. He secured for\r\nhimself lucrative wardships, such as the custody for the second time of\r\nthe great Gloucester earldom, and of several castles, including the not\r\nvery profitable charge of Montgomery, and the important governorship of\r\nDover. On the very eve of his downfall he was made justice of Ireland.\r\nHis brother was bishop of Ely, and other kinsmen were promoted to high\r\nposts. He was satisfied that he spent all that he got in the King's\r\nservice, in promoting the interests of the kingdom, but his enemies\r\nregarded him as unduly tenacious of wealth and office. All classes\r\nalike grew disgusted with the justiciar. The restoration of the malign\r\ninfluence of Peter of Winchester completed his ruin. The king greedily\r\nlistened to the complaints of his old guardian against the minister who\r\novershadowed the royal power. At last, on July 29, 1232, Henry plucked\r\nup courage to dismiss him.\r\n\r\nWith Hubert's fall ends the second period of Henry's reign. William\r\nMarshal expelled the armed foreigner. Hubert restored the\r\nadministration to English hands. Matthew Paris puts into the mouth of a\r\npoor smith who refused to fasten fetters on the fallen minister words\r\nwhich, though probably never spoken, describe with sufficient accuracy\r\nHubert's place in history: \"Is he not that most faithful Hubert who so\r\noften saved England from the devastation of the foreigners and restored\r\nEngland to England?\" Hubert was, as has been well said, perhaps the\r\nfirst minister since the Conquest who made patriotism a principle of\r\npolicy, though it is easy in the light of later developments to read\r\ninto his doings more than he really intended. But whatever his motives,\r\nthe results of his action were clear. He drove away the mercenaries,\r\nhumbled the feudal lords, and set limits to the pope's interference. He\r\nrenewed respect for law and obedience to the law courts. Even in the\r\nworst days of anarchy the administrative system did not break down, and\r\nthe records of royal orders and judicial judgments remain almost as\r\nfull in the midst of the civil war as in the more peaceful days of\r\nHubert's rule. But it was easy enough to issue proclamations and writs.\r\nThe difficulty was to get them obeyed, and the work of Hubert was to\r\nensure that the orders of king and ministers should really be respected\r\nby his subjects. He made many mistakes. He must share the blame of the\r\nfailure of the Kerry campaign, and he was largely responsible for the\r\nsorry collapse of the invasion of Poitou. He neither understood nor\r\nsympathised with Stephen Langton's zeal for the charters. A\r\nstraightforward, limited, honourable man, he strove to carry out his\r\nrather old-fashioned conception of duty in the teeth of a thousand\r\nobstacles. He never had a free hand, and he never enjoyed the hearty\r\nsupport of any one section of his countrymen. Hated by the barons whom\r\nhe kept away from power, he alienated the Londoners by his high-handed\r\nviolence, and the tax-payers by his heavy exactions. The pope disliked\r\nhim, the aliens plotted against him, and the king, for whom he\r\nsacrificed so much, gave him but grudging support. But the reaction\r\nwhich followed his retirement made many, who had rejoiced in his\r\nhumiliation, bitterly regret it.\r\n\r\nThree notable enemies of Hubert went off the stage of history within a\r\nfew months of his fall. The death of Richard le Grand has already been\r\nrecorded. William Marshal, the brother-in-law of the king, the gallant\r\nand successful soldier, the worthy successor of his great father, came\r\nhome from Brittany early in 1231. His last act was to marry his sister,\r\nIsabella, to Richard of Cornwall. Within ten days of the wedding his\r\nbody was laid beside his father in the Temple Church at London. In\r\nOctober, 1232, died Randolph of Blundeville, the last representative of\r\nthe male stock of the old line of the Earls of Chester, and long the\r\nforemost champion of the feudal aristocracy against Hubert. The contest\r\nbetween them had been fought with such chivalry that the last public act\r\nof the old earl was to protect the fallen justiciar from the violence of\r\nhis foes. For more than fifty years Randolph had ruled like a king over\r\nhis palatine earldom; had, like his master, his struggles with his own\r\nvassals, and had perforce to grant to his own barons and boroughs\r\nliberties which he strove to wrest from his overlord for himself and his\r\nfellow nobles. He was not a great statesman, and hardly even a\r\nsuccessful warrior. Yet his popular personal qualities, his energy, his\r\nlong duration of power, and his enormous possessions, give him a place\r\nin history. His memory, living on long in the minds of the people,\r\ninspired a series of ballads which vied in popularity with the cycle of\r\nRobin Hood,[1] though, unfortunately, they have not come down to us. His\r\nestates were divided among his four sisters. His nephew, John the Scot,\r\nEarl of Huntingdon, received a re-grant of the Chester earldom; his\r\nLancashire lands had already gone to his brother-in-law, William of\r\nFerrars, Earl of Derby; other portions of his territories went to his\r\nsister, the Countess of Arundel, and the Lincoln earldom, passing\r\nthrough another sister, Hawise of Quincy, to her son-in-law, John of\r\nLacy, constable of Chester, raised the chief vassal of the palatinate to\r\ncomital rank. None of these heirs of a divided inheritance were true\r\nsuccessors to Randolph. With him died the last of the great Norman\r\nhouses, tenacious beyond its fellows, and surpassing in its two\r\ncenturies of unbroken male descent the usual duration of the medieval\r\nbaronial family. Its collapse made easier the alien invasion which\r\nthreatened to undo Hubert's work.\r\n\r\n    [1] \"Ich can rymes of Robyn Hode, and of Randolf erl of\r\n    Chestre,\" _Vision of Piers Plowman_, i., 167; ii., 94.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE ALIEN INVASION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the dismissal of Hubert on July 29, 1232, Peter des Roches resumed\r\nhis authority over Henry III. Mindful of past failures, the bishop's\r\naim was to rule through dependants, so that he could pull the wires\r\nwithout making himself too prominent. His chief agents in pursuing this\r\npolicy were Peter of Rivaux, Stephen Segrave, and Robert Passelewe. Of\r\nthese, Peter of Rivaux was a Poitevin clerk, officially described as\r\nthe bishop's nephew, but generally supposed to have been his son.\r\nStephen Segrave, the son of a small Leicestershire landholder, was a\r\nlawyer who had held many judicial and administrative posts, including\r\nthe regency during the king's absence abroad in 1230. He abandoned his\r\noriginal clerical profession, received knighthood, married nobly, and\r\nwas the founder of a baronial house in the midlands. His only political\r\nprinciple was obedience to the powers that were in the ascendant.\r\nPasselewe, a clerk who had acted as the agent of Randolph of Chester\r\nand Falkes of Bréauté at the Roman court, was, like Segrave, a mere\r\ntool.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Winchester began to show his hand. Between June 26 and\r\nJuly 11, nineteen of the thirty-five sheriffdoms were bestowed on Peter\r\nof Rivaux for life. As Segrave was sheriff of five shires, and the\r\nbishop himself had acquired the shrievalty of Hampshire, this involved\r\nthe transference of the administration of over two-thirds of the\r\ncounties to the bishop's dependants. On the downfall of Hubert, Segrave\r\nbecame justiciar. He was not the equal of his predecessors either in\r\npersonal weight or in social position, and did not aspire to act as\r\nchief minister. The appointment of a mere lawyer to the great Norman\r\noffice of state marks the first stage in the decline, which before long\r\ndegraded the justiciarship into a simple position of headship over the\r\njudges, the chief justiceship of the next generation. Hubert's offices\r\nand lands were divided among his supplanters. Peter of Rivaux became\r\nkeeper of wards and escheats, castellan of many castles on the Welsh\r\nmarch, and the recipient of even more offices and wardships in Ireland\r\nthan in England. The custody of the Gloucester earldom went to the\r\nBishop of Winchester. The last steps of the ministerial revolution were\r\ncompleted at the king's Christmas court at Worcester. There Rivaux, who\r\nhad yielded up before Michaelmas most of his shrievalties, was made\r\ntreasurer, with Passelewe as his deputy. Of the old ministers only the\r\nchancellor, Ralph Neville, Bishop of Chichester, was suffered to remain\r\nin office. Finally the king's new advisers imported a large company of\r\nPoitevin and Breton mercenaries, hoping with their help to maintain\r\ntheir newly won position. The worst days of John seemed renewed.\r\n\r\nThe Poitevin gang called upon Hubert to render complete accounts for\r\nthe whole period of his justiciarship. When he pleaded that King John\r\nhad given him a charter of quittance, he was told that its force had\r\nended with the death of the grantor. He was further required to answer\r\nfor the wrongs which Twenge's bands had inflicted on the servants of\r\nthe pope. He was accused of poisoning William Earl of Salisbury,\r\nWilliam Marshal, Falkes de Bréauté, and Archbishop Richard. He had\r\nprevented the king from contracting a marriage with a daughter of the\r\nDuke of Austria; he had dissuaded the king from attempting to recover\r\nNormandy; he had first seduced and then married the daughter of the\r\nKing of Scots; he had stolen from the treasury a talisman which made\r\nits possessor invincible in war and had traitorously given it to\r\nLlewelyn of Wales; he had induced Llewelyn to slay William de Braose;\r\nhe had won the royal favour by magic and witchcraft, and finally he had\r\nmurdered Constantine FitzAthulf.\r\n\r\nMany of these accusations were so monstrous that they carried with them\r\ntheir own refutation. It was too often the custom in the middle ages to\r\noverwhelm an enemy with incredible charges for it to be fair to accuse\r\nthe enemies of Hubert of any excessive malignity. The substantial\r\ninnocence of Hubert is clear, for the only charges brought against him\r\nwere either errors of judgment and policy, or incredible crimes.\r\nNevertheless he was in such imminent danger that he took sanctuary with\r\nthe canons of Merton in Surrey. Thereupon the king called upon the\r\nLondoners to march to Merton and bring their ancient foe, dead or\r\nalive, to the city. Randolph of Chester interposed between his fallen\r\nenemy and the royal vengeance. He persuaded Henry to countermand the\r\nmarch to Merton and to suffer the fallen justiciar to leave his refuge\r\nwith some sort of safe conduct. But the king was irritated to hear that\r\nHubert had journeyed into Essex. Again he was pursued, and once more he\r\nwas forced to take sanctuary, this time in a chapel near Brentwood.\r\nFrom this he was dragged by some of the king's household and brought to\r\nLondon, where he was imprisoned in the Tower. The Bishop of London\r\ncomplained to the king of this violation of the rights of the Church,\r\nand Hubert was allowed to return to his chapel. However, the levies of\r\nEssex surrounded the precincts, and he was soon forced by hunger to\r\nsurrender. He offered to submit himself to the king's will, and was for\r\na second time confined in the Tower. On November 10, he was brought\r\nbefore a not unfriendly tribunal, in which the malice of the new\r\njusticiar was tempered by the baronial instincts of the Earls of\r\nCornwall, Warenne, Pembroke, and Lincoln. He made no effort to defend\r\nhimself, and submitted absolutely to the judgment of the king. It was\r\nfinally agreed that he should be allowed to retain the lands which he\r\nhad inherited from his father, and that all his chattels and the lands\r\nthat he had acquired himself should be forfeited to the crown. Further,\r\nhe was to be kept in prison in the castle of Devizes under the charge\r\nof the four earls who had tried him.\r\n\r\nPeter des Roches was soon in difficulties. The earls who had saved\r\nHubert began to oppose the whole administration. Their leader was\r\nRichard, Earl of Pembroke, the second son of the great regent, and\r\nsince his brother's death head of the house of Marshal. Richard was\r\nbitterly prejudiced against the king and his courtiers by an attempt to\r\nrefuse him his brother's earldom. A gallant warrior, handsome and\r\neloquent, pious, upright, and well educated, Richard, the best of the\r\nmarshal's sons, stood for the rest of his short life at the head of the\r\nopposition. He incited his friends to refuse to attend a council\r\nsummoned to meet at Oxford, on June 24, 1233. The king would have\r\nsought to compel their presence, had not a Dominican friar, Robert\r\nBacon, when preaching before the court, warned him that there would be\r\nno peace in England until Bishop Peter and his son were removed from\r\nhis counsels. The friar's boldness convinced him that disaffection was\r\nwidespread, and he promised the magnates at a later council at London\r\nthat he would, with their advice, correct whatever he found there was\r\nneed to reform. Meanwhile the Poitevins brought into England fresh\r\nswarms of hirelings from their own land, and Peter des Roches urged\r\nHenry to crush rebellion in the bud. As a warning to greater offenders,\r\nGilbert Basset was deprived of a manor which he had held since the\r\nreign of King John, and an attempt was made to lay violent hands upon\r\nhis brother-in-law, Richard Siward. The two barons resisted, whereupon\r\nall their estates were transferred to Peter of Rivaux. Yet Richard\r\nMarshal still continued to hope for peace, and, after the failure of\r\nearlier councils, set off to attend another assembly fixed for August\r\n1, at Westminster. On his way he learnt from his sister Isabella, the\r\nwife of Richard of Cornwall, that Peter des Roches was laying a trap\r\nfor him. In high indignation he took horse for his Welsh estates, and\r\nprepared for rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe king summoned the military tenants to appear with horses and arms\r\nat Gloucester on the 14th. There Richard Marshal was declared a traitor\r\nand an invasion of his estates was ordered. But the king had not\r\nsufficient resources to carry out his threats, and October saw the\r\nbarons once more wrangling with Henry at Westminster, and claiming that\r\nthe marshal should be tried by his peers. Peter of Winchester declared\r\nthat there were no peers in England as there were in France, and that\r\nin consequence the king had power to condemn any disloyal subject\r\nthrough his justices. This daringly unconstitutional doctrine provoked\r\na renewed outcry. The bishops joined the secular magnates, and\r\nthreatened their colleague with excommunication. A formidable civil war\r\nbroke out. Siward and Basset harried the lands of the Poitevins, while\r\nthe marshal made a close alliance with Llewelyn of Wales. The king\r\nstill had formidable forces on his side. Richard of Cornwall was\r\npersuaded by Bishop Peter to take up arms for his brother, and the two\r\nnew earls, John the Scot of Chester, and John de Lacy of Lincoln,\r\njoined the royal forces. Hubert de Burgh took advantage of the\r\nincreasing confusion to escape from Devizes castle to a church in the\r\ntown. Dragged back with violence to his prison, he was again, as at\r\nBrentwood, restored to sanctuary through the exertions of the bishop of\r\nthe diocese. There he remained, closely watched by his foes, until\r\nOctober 30, when Siward and Basset drove away the guard, and took him\r\noff with them to the marshal's castle of Chepstow.\r\n\r\nThe tide of war flowed to the southern march of Wales. Llewelyn and\r\nRichard Marshal devastated Glamorgan, which, as a part of the\r\nGloucester inheritance, was under the custody of the Bishop of\r\nWinchester. They took nearly all its castles, including that of\r\nCardiff. Thence they subdued Usk, Abergavenny, and other neighbouring\r\nstrongholds, while an independent army, including the marshal's\r\nPembrokeshire vassals and the men of the princes of South Wales, wasted\r\nmonths in a vain attack on Carmarthen. The king's vassals were again\r\nsummoned to Gloucester, whence Henry led them early in November towards\r\nChepstow, the centre of the marshal's estates in Gwent. Earl Richard\r\ndevastated his lands so effectively that the king could not support his\r\narmy on them, and was compelled to move up the Wye valley towards the\r\ncastles of Monmouth, Skenfrith, Whitecastle, and Grosmont, the strong\r\nquadrilateral of Upper Gwent which still remained in the hands of the\r\nking's friends. Marching to the most remote of these, Grosmont, on the\r\nupper Monnow, Henry spent several days in the castle, while his army\r\nlay around under canvas. On the night of November 11, the sleeping\r\nsoldiers were suddenly set upon by the barons and their Welsh allies;\r\nthey fled unarmed to the castle, or scattered in confusion. The\r\nassailants seized their horses, harness, arms and provisions, but\r\nrefrained from slaying or capturing them. The royal forces never\r\nrallied. Many gladly went home, giving as their excuse that they were\r\nunable to fight since they had lost their equipment. Henry and his\r\nministers withdrew to Gloucester. More convinced than ever of the\r\ntreachery of Englishmen, the king entrusted the defence of the border\r\ncastles to mercenaries from Poitou.\r\n\r\nThe fighting centred round Monmouth, which Richard approached on the\r\n25th with a small company. A sudden sortie almost overwhelmed the\r\nlittle band. The marshal held his own heroically against twelve, until\r\nat last Baldwin of Guînes, the warden of the castle, took him prisoner.\r\nThereupon Baldwin fell to the ground, his armour pierced by a lucky\r\nbolt from a crossbow. His followers, smitten with panic, abandoned the\r\nmarshal, and bore their leader home. By that time, however, the bulk of\r\nthe marshal's forces had come upon the scene. A general engagement\r\nfollowed, in which the Anglo-Welsh army drove the enemy back into\r\nMonmouth and took possession of the castle. This set the marshal free\r\nto march northwards and join Llewelyn in a vigorous attack upon\r\nShrewsbury. In January, 1234, they burnt that town and retired to their\r\nown lands loaded with booty. Meanwhile Siward devastated the estates of\r\nthe Poitevins and of Richard of Cornwall. Afraid to be cut off from his\r\nretreat to England the king abandoned Gloucester, where he had kept his\r\nmelancholy Christmas court, and found a surer refuge in Bishop Peter's\r\ncathedral city. Thereupon Gloucestershire suffered the fate of\r\nShropshire. \"It was a wretched sight for travellers in that region to\r\nsee on the highways innumerable dead bodies lying naked and unburied,\r\nto be devoured by birds of prey, and so polluting the air that they\r\ninfected healthy men with mortal sickness.\"[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] Wendover, iv., 291.\r\n\r\nThe king swore that he would never make peace with the marshal, unless\r\nhe threw himself on the royal mercy as a confessed traitor with a rope\r\nround his neck. Having, however, exhausted all his military resources,\r\nhe cunningly strove to entice Richard from Wales to Ireland. The two\r\nPeters wrote to Maurice Fitzgerald, then justiciar of Ireland, and to\r\nthe chief foes of the marshal, urging them to fall upon his Irish\r\nestates and capture the traitor, dead or alive. Many of the most\r\npowerful nobles of Ireland lent themselves to the conspiracy. The Lacys\r\nof Meath, his old enemies, joined with Fitzgerald, Geoffrey Marsh, and\r\nRichard de Burgh, the greatest of the Norman lords of Connaught, and\r\nthe nephew of Hubert, in carrying out the plot. The confederates fell\r\nsuddenly upon the marshal's estates and devastated them with fire and\r\nsword. On hearing of this attack Richard immediately left Wales, and,\r\naccompanied by only fifteen knights, took ship for Ireland. On his\r\narrival Geoffrey Marsh, the meanest of the conspirators, received him\r\nwith every profession of cordiality, and urged him to attack his\r\nenemies without delay. Geoffrey was an old man; he had long held the\r\ngreat post of justiciar of Ireland; and he was himself the liegeman of\r\nthe marshal. Richard therefore implicitly trusted him, and forthwith\r\ntook the field.\r\n\r\nThe first warlike operations of Earl Richard were successful. After a\r\nshort siege he obtained possession of Limerick, and his enemies were\r\nfain to demand a truce. Richard proposed a conference to be held on\r\nApril 1, 1234, on the Curragh of Kildare. The conference proved\r\nabortive, for Geoffrey Marsh cunningly persuaded the marshal to refuse\r\nany offer of terms which the magnates would accept, and Richard found\r\nthat he had been duped into taking up a position that he was not strong\r\nenough to maintain. Marsh withdrew from his side, on the ground that he\r\ncould not fight against Lacy, whose sister he had married. The marshal\r\nforesaw the worst. \"I know,\" he declared, \"that this day I am delivered\r\nover to death, but it is better to die honourably for the cause of\r\njustice than to flee from the field and become a reproach to\r\nknighthood.\"\r\n\r\nThe forsworn Irish knights slunk away to neighbouring places of\r\nsanctuary or went over to the enemy. When the final struggle came, later\r\non the same April 1, Richard had few followers save the faithful fifteen\r\nknights who had crossed over with him from Wales. The little band,\r\noutnumbered by more than nine to one, struggled desperately to the end.\r\nAt last the marshal, unhorsed and severely wounded, fell into the hands\r\nof his enemies. They bore him, more dead than alive, to his own castle\r\nof Kilkenny, which had just been seized by the justiciar. After a few\r\ndays Richard's tough constitution began to get the better of his wounds.\r\nThen his enemies, showing him the royal warranty for their acts, induced\r\nhim to admit them into his castles. An ignorant or treacherous surgeon,\r\ncalled in by the justiciar, cauterised his wounds so severely that his\r\nsufferings became intense. He died of fever on the 16th, and was buried,\r\nas he himself had willed, in the Franciscan church at Kilkenny. No one\r\nrejoiced at the death of the hero save the traitors who had lured him to\r\nhis doom and the Poitevins who had suborned them. Their victim, the weak\r\nking, mourned for his friend as David had lamented Saul and Jonathan.[1]\r\nThe treachery of his enemies brought them little profit. While Richard\r\nMarshal lay on his deathbed, a new Archbishop of Canterbury drove the\r\nPoitevins from office.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Dunstable Ann._, p. 137.\r\n\r\nIn the heyday of the Poitevins' power the Church sounded a feeble but\r\nclear note of alarm. The pope expostulated with Henry for his treatment\r\nof Hubert de Burgh, and Agnellus of Pisa, the first English provincial\r\nof the newly arrived Franciscan order, strove to reconcile Richard\r\nMarshal with his sovereign in the course of the South-Welsh campaign.\r\nMore drastic action was necessary if vague remonstrance was to be\r\ntranslated into fruitful action. The three years' vacancy of the see of\r\nCanterbury, after the death of Richard le Grand, paralysed the action\r\nof the Church. After the pope's rejection of the first choice of the\r\nconvent of Christ Church, the chancellor, Ralph Neville, the monks\r\nelected their own prior, and him also Gregory refused as too old and\r\nincompetent. Their third election fell upon John Blunt, a theologian\r\nhigh in the favour of Peter des Roches, who sent him to Rome, well\r\nprovided with ready money, to secure his confirmation. Simon Langton,\r\nagain restored to England, and archdeacon of Canterbury, persuaded the\r\npope to veto Blunt's appointment on the ground of his having held two\r\nbenefices without a dispensation. His rejection was the first check\r\nreceived by the Poitevin faction. It was promptly followed by a more\r\ncrushing blow. Weary of the long delay, Gregory persuaded the Christ\r\nChurch monks then present at Rome to elect Edmund Rich, treasurer of\r\nSalisbury. Edmund, a scholar who had taught theology and arts with\r\ngreat distinction at Paris and Oxford, was still more famous for his\r\nmystical devotion, for his asceticism and holiness of life. He was\r\nhowever an old man, inexperienced in affairs, and, with all his\r\ngracious gifts, somewhat wanting in the tenacity and vigour which\r\nleadership involved. Yet in sending so eminent a saint to Canterbury,\r\nRome conferred on England a service second only to that which she had\r\nrendered when she secured the archbishopric for Stephen Langton.\r\n\r\nBefore his consecration as archbishop on April 2, 1234, Edmund had\r\nalready joined with his suffragans on February 2 in upholding the good\r\nfame of the marshal and in warning the king of the disastrous results\r\nof preferring the counsels of the Poitevins to those of his\r\nnatural-born subjects. A week after his consecration Edmund succeeded\r\nin carrying out a radical change in the administration. On April 9 he\r\ndeclared that unless Henry drove away the Poitevins, he would forthwith\r\npronounce him excommunicate. Yielding at once, Henry sent the Bishop of\r\nWinchester back to his diocese, and deprived Peter of Rivaux of all his\r\noffices. The followers of the two Peters shared their fate, and Henry,\r\ndespatching Edmund to Wales to make peace with Llewelyn and the\r\nmarshal, hurried to Gloucester in order to meet the archbishop on his\r\nreturn. His good resolutions were further strengthened by the news of\r\nEarl Richard's death. On arriving at Gloucester he held a council in\r\nwhich the ruin of the Poitevins was completed. A truce, negotiated by\r\nthe archbishop with Llewelyn, was ratified. The partisans of the\r\nmarshal were pardoned, even Richard Siward being forgiven his long\r\ncareer of plunder. Gilbert Marshal, the next brother of the childless\r\nEarl Richard, was invested with his earldom and office, and Henry\r\nhimself dubbed him a knight. Hubert de Burgh was included in the\r\ncomprehensive pardon. Indignant that his name and seal should have been\r\nused to cover his ex-ministers' treachery to Earl Richard, Henry\r\noverwhelmed them with reproaches, and strove by his violence against\r\nthem to purge himself from complicity in their acts. The Poitevins\r\nlurked in sanctuary, fearing for the worst. Segrave forgot his\r\nknighthood, resumed the tonsure, and took refuge in a church in\r\nLeicester. The king's worst indignation was reserved for Peter of\r\nRivaux. Peter protested that his orders entitled him to immunity from\r\narrest, but it was found that he wore a mail shirt under his clerical\r\ngarments, and, without a word of reproach from the archbishop, he was\r\nimmured in a lay prison on the pretext that no true clerk wore armour.\r\nOf the old ministers Ralph Neville alone remained in office.\r\n\r\nWith Bishop Peter's fall disappeared the last of the influences that\r\nhad prevailed during the minority. The king, who felt his dignity\r\nimpaired by the Poitevin domination, resolved that henceforward he\r\nwould submit to no master. He soon framed a plan of government that\r\nthoroughly satisfied his jealous and exacting nature. Henceforth no\r\nmagnates, either of Church or State, should stand between him and his\r\nsubjects. He would be his own chief minister, holding in his own hands\r\nall the strings of policy, and acting through subordinates whose sole\r\nduly was to carry out their master's orders. Under such a system the\r\njusticiarship practically ceased to exist. The treasurership was held\r\nfor short periods by royal clerks of no personal distinction. Even the\r\nchancellorship became overshadowed. Henry quarrelled with Ralph Neville\r\nin 1238, and withdrew from him the custody of the great seal, though he\r\nallowed him to retain the name and emoluments of chancellor. On\r\nNeville's death the office fell into abeyance for nearly twenty years,\r\nduring which time the great seal was entrusted to seven successive\r\nkeepers. Like his grandfather, Henry wished to rule in person with the\r\nhelp of faithful but unobtrusive subordinates. This system, which was\r\nessentially that of the French monarchy, presupposed for success the\r\nconstant personal supervision of an industrious and strong-willed king.\r\nHenry III was never a strenuous worker, and his character failed in the\r\nrobustness and self-reliance necessary for personal rule. The magnates,\r\nwho regarded themselves as the king's natural-born counsellors, were\r\nbitterly incensed, and hated the royal clerks as fiercely as they had\r\ndisliked the ministers of his minority. Opposed by the barons,\r\ndistrusted by the people, liable to be thrown over by their master at\r\neach fresh change of his caprice, the royal subordinates showed more\r\neagerness in prosecuting their own private fortunes than in consulting\r\nthe interests of the State. Thus the nominal government of Henry proved\r\nextremely ineffective. Huge taxes were raised, but little good came\r\nfrom them. The magnates held sullenly aloof; the people grumbled; the\r\nChurch lamented the evil days. Yet for five and twenty years the\r\nwretched system went on, not so much by reason of its own strength as\r\nbecause there was no one vigorous enough to overthrow it.\r\n\r\nThe author of all this mischief was a man of some noble and many\r\nattractive qualities. Save when an occasional outburst of temper showed\r\nhim a true son of John, Henry was the kindest, mildest, most amiable of\r\nmen. He was the first king since William the Conqueror in whose private\r\nlife the austerest critics could find nothing blameworthy. His piety\r\nstands high, even when estimated by the standards of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. He was well educated and had a touch of the artist's\r\ntemperament, loving fair churches, beautiful sculpture, delicate\r\ngoldsmith's work, and richly illuminated books. He had a horror of\r\nviolence, and never wept more bitter tears than when he learned how\r\ntreacherously his name had been used to lure Richard Marshal to his\r\ndoom. But he was extraordinarily deficient in stability of purpose. For\r\nthe moment it was easy to influence him either for good or evil, but\r\neven the ablest of his counsellors found it impossible to retain any\r\nhold over him for long. One day he lavished all his affection on Hubert\r\nde Burgh; the next he played into the hands of his enemies. In the same\r\nway he got rid of Peter des Roches, the preceptor of his infancy, the\r\nguide of his early manhood. Jealous, self-assertive, restless, and\r\ntimid, he failed in just those qualities that his subjects expected to\r\nfind in a king. Born and brought up in England, and never leaving it\r\nsave for short and infrequent visits to the continent, he was proud of\r\nhis English ancestors and devoted to English saints, more especially to\r\nroyal saints such as Edward the Confessor and Edmund of East Anglia.\r\nYet he showed less sympathy with English ways than many of his\r\nforeign-born predecessors. Educated under alien influences, delighting\r\nin the art, the refinement, the devotion, and the absolutist principles\r\nof foreigners, he seldom trusted a man of English birth. Too weak to\r\nact for himself, too suspicious to trust his natural counsellors, he\r\nfound the friendship and advice for which he yearned in foreign\r\nfavourites and kinsmen. Thus it was that the hopes excited by the fall\r\nof the Poitevins were disappointed. The alien invasion, checked for a\r\nfew years, was renewed in a more dangerous shape.\r\n\r\nDuring the ten years after the collapse of Peter des Roches, swarms of\r\nforeigners came to England, and spoiled the land with the king's entire\r\ngood-will. Henry's marriage brought many Provençals and Savoyards to\r\nEngland. The renewed troubles between pope and emperor led to a renewal\r\nof Roman interference in a more exacting form. The continued\r\nintercourse with foreign states resulted in fresh opportunities of\r\nalien influence. A new attempt on Poitou brought as its only result the\r\nimportation of the king's Poitevin kinsmen. The continued close\r\nrelationship between the English and the French baronage involved the\r\nfrequent claim of English estates and titles by men of alien birth.\r\nEven such beneficial movements as the establishment of the mendicant\r\norders in England, and the cosmopolitan outlook of the increasingly\r\nimportant academic class contributed to the spread of outlandish ideas.\r\nAs wave after wave of foreigners swept over England, Englishmen\r\ninvolved them in a common condemnation. And all saw in the weakness of\r\nthe king the very source of their power.\r\n\r\nThe first great influx of foreigners followed directly from Henry's\r\nmarriage. For several years active negotiations had been going on to\r\nsecure him a suitable bride. There had also at various times been talk\r\nof his selecting a wife from Brittany, Austria, Bohemia, or Scotland,\r\nand in the spring of 1235 a serious negotiation for his marriage with\r\nJoan, daughter and heiress of the Count of Ponthieu, only broke down\r\nthrough the opposition of the French court. Henry then sought the hand\r\nof Eleanor, a girl twelve years old, and the second of the four\r\ndaughters of Raymond Berengar IV., Count of Provence, and his wife\r\nBeatrice, sister of Amadeus III., Count of Savoy. The marriage contract\r\nwas signed in October. Before that time Eleanor had left Provence under\r\nthe escort of her mother's brother, William, bishop-elect of Valence.\r\nOn her way she spent a long period with her elder sister Margaret, who\r\nhad been married to Louis IX. of France in 1234. On January 14, 1236,\r\nshe was married to Henry at Canterbury by Archbishop Edmund, and\r\ncrowned at Westminster on the following Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe new queen's kinsfolk quickly acquired an almost unbounded\r\nascendency over her weak husband. With the exception of the reigning\r\nCount Amadeus of Savoy, her eight maternal uncles were somewhat\r\nscantily provided for. The prudence of the French government prevented\r\nthem from obtaining any advantage for themselves at the court of their\r\nniece the Queen of France, and they gladly welcomed the opportunity of\r\nestablishing themselves at the expense of their English nephew.\r\nSelf-seeking and not over-scrupulous, able, energetic, and with the\r\nvigour and resource of high-born soldiers of fortune, several of them\r\nplay honourable parts in the history of their own land, and are by no\r\nmeans deserving of the complete condemnation meted out to them by the\r\nEnglish annalists.[1] The bishop-elect of Valence was an able and\r\naccomplished warrior. He stayed on in England after accomplishing his\r\nmission, and with him remained his clerk, the younger son of a house of\r\nAlpine barons, Peter of Aigueblanche, whose cunning and dexterity were\r\nas attractive to Henry as the more martial qualities of his master.\r\nWeary of standing alone, the king eagerly welcomed a trustworthy\r\nadviser who was outside the entanglements of English parties, and made\r\nBishop William his chief counsellor. It was believed that he was\r\nassociated with eleven others in a secret inner circle of royal\r\nadvisers, whose advice Henry pledged himself by oath to follow. Honours\r\nand estates soon began to fall thickly on William and his friends. He\r\nmade himself the mouthpiece of Henry's foreign policy. When he\r\ntemporarily left England, he led a force sent by the king to help\r\nFrederick II. in his war against the cities of northern Italy. His\r\ninfluence with Henry did much to secure for his brother, Thomas of\r\nSavoy, the hand of the elderly countess Joan of Flanders. With Thomas\r\nas the successor of Ferdinand of Portugal, the rich Flemish county,\r\nbound to England by so many political and economic ties, seemed in safe\r\nhands, and preserved from French influence. In 1238 Thomas visited\r\nEngland, and received a warm welcome and rich presents from the king.\r\n\r\n    [1] For Eleanor's countrymen see Mugnier, _Les Savoyards en\r\n    Angleterre au XIIIe siècle, et Pierre d'Aigueblanche, évêque\r\n    d'Héreford_ (1890).\r\n\r\nDespite the establishment of the Savoyards, the Poitevin influence began\r\nto revive. Peter des Roches, who had occupied himself after his fall by\r\nfighting for Gregory IX. against the revolted Romans, returned to\r\nEngland in broken health in 1236, and was reconciled to the king. Peter\r\nof Rivaux was restored to favour, and made keeper of the royal wardrobe.\r\nSegrave and Passelewe again became justices and ministers. England was\r\nnow the hunting-ground of any well-born Frenchmen anxious for a wider\r\ncareer than they could obtain at home.[1] Among the foreigners attracted\r\nto England to prosecute legal claims or to seek the royal bounty came\r\nSimon of Montfort, the second son of the famous conqueror of the\r\nAlbigenses. Amice, the mother of the elder Simon, was the sister and\r\nheiress of Robert of Beaumont, the last of his line to hold the earldom\r\nof Leicester. After Amice's death her son used the title and claimed the\r\nestates of that earldom. But these pretensions were but nominal, and\r\nsince 1215 Randolph of Chester had administered the Leicester lands as\r\nif his complete property. However, Amaury of Montfort, the Count of\r\nToulouse's eldest son, ceded to his portionless younger brother his\r\nclaims to the Beaumont inheritance, and in 1230 Simon went to England to\r\npush his fortunes. Young, brilliant, ambitious and attractive, he not\r\nonly easily won the favour of the king, but commended himself so well to\r\nEarl Randolph that in 1231 the aged earl was induced to relax his grasp\r\non the Leicester estates. In 1239 the last formalities of investiture\r\nwere accomplished. Amaury renounced his claims, and after that Simon\r\nbecame Earl of Leicester and steward of England. A year before that he\r\nhad secured the great marriage that he had long been seeking. In\r\nJanuary, 1238, he was wedded to the king's own sister, Eleanor, the\r\nchildless widow of the younger William Marshal. Simon was for the moment\r\nhigh in the affection of his brother-in-law. To the English he was\r\nsimply another of the foreign favourites who turned the king's heart\r\nagainst his born subjects.\r\n\r\n    [1] This is well illustrated by Philip de Beaumanoir's\r\n    well-known romance, _Jean de Dammartin et Blonde d'Oxford_ (ed.\r\n    by Suchier, Soc. des anciens Textes français, and by Le Roux de\r\n    Lincy, Camden Soc.).\r\n\r\nIn 1238 Peter des Roches died. With all his faults the Poitevin was an\r\nexcellent administrator at Winchester,[1] and left his estates in\r\nsuch a prosperous condition that Henry coveted the succession for the\r\nbishop-elect of Valence, though William already had the prospect of the\r\nprince-bishopric of liege. But the monks of St. Swithun's refused to\r\nobey the royal order, and Henry sought to obtain his object from the\r\npope. Gregory gave William both Liege and Winchester, but in 1239 death\r\nended his restless plans. William's death left more room for his\r\nkinsfolk and followers. His clerk, Peter of Aigueblanche, returned to\r\nthe land of promise, and in 1240 secured his consecration as Bishop of\r\nHereford. William's brother, Peter of Savoy, lord of Romont and\r\nFaucigny, was invited to England in the same year. In 1241 he was\r\ninvested with the earldom of Richmond, which a final breach with Peter\r\nof Brittany had left in the king's hands. Peter, the ablest member of\r\nhis house, thus became its chief representative in England.[2]\r\n\r\n    [1] See H. Hall, _Pipe Roll of the Bishop of Winchester_,\r\n    1207-8.\r\n\r\n    [2] For Peter see Wurstemberger, _Peter II., Graf von Savoyen_\r\n    (1856).\r\n\r\nWith the Provençals and Savoyards came a fresh swarm of Romans. In 1237\r\nthe first papal legates _a latere_ since the recall of Pandulf landed\r\nin England. The deputy of Gregory IX. was the cardinal-deacon Otto, who\r\nin 1226 had already discharged the humbler office of nuncio in England.\r\nIt was believed that the legate was sent at the special request of\r\nHenry III., and despite the remonstrances of the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury. Those most unfriendly to the legate were won over by his\r\nirreproachable conduct. He rejected nearly all gifts. He was unwearied\r\nin preaching peace; travelled to the north to settle outstanding\r\ndifferences between Henry and the King of Scots, and thence hurried to\r\nthe west to prolong the truce with Llewelyn. His zeal for the\r\nreformation of abuses made the canons of the national council, held\r\nunder his presidency at St. Paul's on November 18, 1237, an epoch in\r\nthe history of our ecclesiastical jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nDespite his efforts the legate remained unpopular. The pluralists and\r\nnepotists, who feared his severity, joined with the foes of all\r\ntaxation and the enemies of all foreigners in denouncing the legate. To\r\navoid the danger of poison, he thought it prudent to make his own\r\nbrother his master cook. During the council of London it was necessary\r\nto escort him from his lodgings and back again with a military force.\r\nIn the council itself the claim of high-born clerks to receive\r\nbenefices in plurality found a spokesman in so respectable a prelate as\r\nWalter of Cantilupe, the son of a marcher baron, whom Otto had just\r\nenthroned in his cathedral at Worcester, and the legate, \"fearing for\r\nhis skin,\" was suspected of mitigating the severity of his principles\r\nto win over the less greedy of the friends of vested interests. His\r\nRoman followers knew and cared little about English susceptibilities,\r\nand feeling was so strong against them that any mischance might excite\r\nan explosion. Such an accident occurred on St. George's day, April 23,\r\n1238, when the legate was staying with the Austin Canons of Oseney,\r\nnear Oxford, while the king was six miles off at Abingdon. Some of the\r\nmasters of the university went to Oseney to pay their respects to the\r\ncardinal, and were rudely repulsed by the Italian porter. Irritated at\r\nthis discourtesy, they returned with a host of clerks, who forced their\r\nway into the abbey. Amongst them was a poor Irish chaplain, who made\r\nhis way to the kitchen to beg for food. The chief cook, the legate's\r\nbrother, threw a pot of scalding broth into the Irishman's face. A\r\nclerk from the march of Wales shot the cook dead with an arrow. A\r\nfierce struggle followed, in the midst of which Otto, hastily donning\r\nthe garb of his hosts, took refuge in the tower of their church, where\r\nhe was besieged by the infuriated clerks, until the king sent soldiers\r\nfrom Abingdon to release him. Otto thereupon laid Oxford under an\r\ninterdict, suspended all lectures, and put thirty masters into prison.\r\nEnglish opinion, voiced by the diocesan, Grosseteste, held that the\r\ncardinal's servants had provoked the riot, and found little to blame in\r\nthe violence of the clerks.\r\n\r\nIn 1239 Gregory IX. began his final conflict with Frederick II., and\r\ndemanded the support of all Europe. As before, from 1227 to 1230, the\r\npressure of the papal necessity was at once felt in England. The legate\r\nhad to raise supplies at all costs. Crusaders were allowed to renounce\r\ntheir vows for ready money. Every visitation or conference became an\r\nexcuse for procurations and fees. Presents were no longer rejected, but\r\nrather greedily solicited. On the pretence that it was necessary to\r\nreform the Scottish Church, \"which does not recognise the Roman Church\r\nas its sole mother and metropolitan,\" Otto excited the indignation of\r\nAlexander II. by attempts to extend his jurisdiction to Scotland,\r\nhitherto unvisited by legates. In England his claims soon grew beyond\r\nall bearing. At last he demanded a fifth of all clerical goods to\r\nenable the pope to finance the anti-imperial crusade. Even this was\r\nmore endurable than the order received from Rome that 300 clerks of\r\nRoman families should be \"provided\" to benefices in England in order\r\nthat Gregory might obtain the support of their relatives against\r\nFrederick. Both as feudal suzerain and as spiritual despot, the pope\r\nlorded it over England as fully as his uncle Innocent III.\r\n\r\nWeakness, piety, and self-interest combined to make Henry III.\r\nacquiesce in the legate's exactions. \"I neither wish nor dare,\" said\r\nhe, \"to oppose the lord pope in anything.\" The union of king and legate\r\nwas irresistible. The lay opposition was slow and feeble. Gilbert\r\nMarshal, though showing no lack of spirit, was not the man to play the\r\npart which his brother Richard had filled so effectively. Richard, Earl\r\nof Cornwall, who constituted himself the spokesman of the magnates,\r\nmade a special grievance of the marriage of Simon of Montfort with his\r\nsister Eleanor. England, he said, was like a vineyard with a broken\r\nhedge, so that all that went by could steal the grapes. He took arms,\r\nand subscribed the first of the long series of plans of constitutional\r\nreform that the reign was to witness, according to which the king was\r\nto be guided by a chosen body of counsellors. But at the crisis of the\r\nmovement he held back, having accomplished nothing.\r\n\r\nThere was more vigour in the ecclesiastical opposition. Robert\r\nGrosseteste,[1] a Suffolk man of humble birth, had already won for\r\nhimself a position of unique distinction at Oxford and Paris. A teacher\r\nof rare force, a scholar of unexampled range, a thinker of daring\r\noriginality, and a writer who had touched upon almost every known\r\nsubject, he was at the height of his fame when, in 1235, his appointment\r\nas Bishop of Lincoln gave the fullest opportunities for the employment\r\nof his great gifts in the public service. He was convinced that the\r\npreoccupation of the clergy in worldly employment and the constant\r\naggressions of the civil upon the ecclesiastical courts lay at the root\r\nof the evils of the time. His conviction brought him into conflict with\r\nthe king rather than the legate, though for the moment his absorption in\r\nthe cares of his diocese distracted his attention from general\r\nquestions. The bishops generally had become so hostile that Otto shrank\r\nfrom meeting them in another council, and strove to get money by\r\nnegotiating individually with the leading churchmen. The old foe of\r\npapal usurpations, Robert Twenge, renewed his agitation on behalf of the\r\nrights of patrons, and the clergy of Berkshire drew up a remonstrance\r\nagainst Otto's extortions.\r\n\r\n    [1] For Grosseteste, see F.S. Stevenson, _Robert Grosseteste,\r\n    Bishop of Lincoln_ (1899).\r\n\r\nArchbishop Edmund saw the need of opposing both legate and king; but he\r\nwas hampered by his ecclesiastical and political principles, and still\r\nmore, perhaps, by the magnitude of the rude task thrown upon him. He\r\nhad set before himself the ideal of St. Thomas, not only in the\r\nasceticism of his private life, but in his zeal for his see and the\r\nChurch. But few men were more unlike the strong-willed and bellicose\r\nmartyr of Canterbury than the gentle and yielding saint of Abingdon. A\r\nplentiful crop of quarrels, however, soon showed that Edmund had, in\r\none respect, copied only too faithfully the example of his predecessor.\r\nHe was engaged in a controversy of some acerbity with the Archbishop of\r\nYork, and he was involved in a long wrangle with the monks of his\r\ncathedral, which took him to Rome soon after the legate's arrival. He\r\ngot little satisfaction there, and found a whole sea of troubles to\r\noverwhelm him on his return. At last came the demand of the fifth from\r\nOtto. Edmund joined in the opposition of his brethren to this exaction,\r\nbut his attitude was complicated by his other difficulties. Leaning in\r\nhis weakness on the pope, he found that Gregory was a taskmaster rather\r\nthan a director. At last he paid his fifth, but, broken in health and\r\nspirits, he was of no mind to withstand the demands of the Roman clerks\r\nfor benefices. If he could not be another St. Thomas defending the\r\nliberties of the Church, he could at least withdraw like his prototype\r\nfrom the strife, and find a refuge in a foreign house of religion.\r\nSeeking out St. Thomas's old haunt at Pontigny, he threw himself with\r\nardour into the austere Cistercian life. On the advice of his\r\nphysicians, he soon sought a healthier abode with the canons of Soisy,\r\nin Brie, at whose house he died on November 16, 1240. His body was\r\nburied at Pontigny in the still abiding minster which had witnessed the\r\ndevotions of Becket and Langton, and miracles were soon wrought at his\r\ntomb. Within eight years of his death he was declared a saint; and\r\nHenry, who had thwarted him in life, and even opposed his canonisation,\r\nwas among the first of the pilgrims who worshipped at his shrine. It\r\nneeded a tougher spirit and a stronger character than Edmund's to\r\ngrapple with the thorny problems of his age.\r\n\r\nThe retirement of the archbishop enabled Otto to carry through his\r\nbusiness, and withdraw from England on January 7, 1241. On August 21\r\nGregory IX. died, with his arch-enemy at the gates of Rome and all his\r\nplans for the time frustrated. High-minded, able and devout, he wagered\r\nthe whole fortunes of the papacy on the result of his secular struggle\r\nwith the emperor. In Italy as in England, the spiritual hegemony of the\r\nRoman see and the spiritual influence of the western Church were\r\ncompromised by his exaltation of ecclesiastical politics over religion.\r\n\r\nThe monks of Christ Church won court favour by electing as archbishop,\r\nBoniface of Savoy, Bishop-elect of Belley, one of the queen's uncles.\r\nThere was no real resistance to the appointment, though a prolonged\r\nvacancy in the papacy made it impossible for him to receive formal\r\nconfirmation until 1243, and it was not until 1244 that he condescended\r\nto visit his new province. Meanwhile his kinsmen were carrying\r\neverything before them. Richard of Cornwall lost his first wife,\r\nIsabella, daughter of William Marshal, in 1240, an event which broke\r\nalmost the last link that bound him to the baronial opposition. He\r\nwithdrew himself from the troubles of English politics by going on\r\ncrusade, and with him went his former enemy, Simon of Leicester.\r\nRichard was back in England early in 1242, and on November 23, 1243,\r\nhis marriage with Sanchia of Provence, the younger sister of the queens\r\nof France and England, completed his conversion to the court party.\r\n\r\nHenry III.'s cosmopolitan instincts led him to take as much part in\r\nforeign politics as his resources allowed. In 1235 he married his\r\nsister Isabella to Frederick II., and henceforth manifested a strong\r\ninterest in the affairs of his imperial brother-in-law. His relations\r\nwith France were still uneasy, and he hoped to find in Frederick's\r\nsupport a counterpoise to the steady pressure of French hostility. All\r\nEngland watched with interest the progress of the emperor's arms. Peter\r\nof Savoy led an English contingent to fight for Frederick against the\r\nMilanese, and Matthew Paris, the greatest of the English chroniclers,\r\nnarrates the campaign of Corte Nuova with a detail exceeding that which\r\nhe allows to the military enterprises of his own king. Frederick\r\nconstantly corresponded with both the king and Richard of Cornwall, and\r\nit was nothing but solicitude for the safely of the heir to the throne\r\nthat led the English magnates to reject the emperor's request that\r\nRichard should receive a high command under him. Even Frederick's\r\nbreach with the pope in 1239 did not destroy his friendship with Henry.\r\nThe situation became extremely complicated, since Innocent IV. derived\r\nlarge financial support for his crusade from the unwilling English\r\nclergy, while Henry still professed to be Frederick's friend. The king\r\nallowed Otto to proclaim Frederick's excommunication in England, and\r\nthen urged the legate to quit the country because the emperor strongly\r\nprotested against the presence of an avowed enemy at his\r\nbrother-in-law's court. Neither pope nor emperor could rely upon the\r\nsupport of so half-hearted a prince. Renewed trouble with France\r\nexplains in some measure the anxiety of Henry to remain in good\r\nrelations with the emperor despite Frederick's quarrel with the pope.\r\n\r\nThe position of the French monarchy was far stronger than it had been\r\nwhen Henry first intervened in continental politics. Blanche of Castile\r\nhad broken the back of the feudal coalition, and even Peter Mauclerc had\r\nmade his peace with the monarchy at the price of his English earldom.\r\nLouis IX. attained his majority in 1235, and his first care was to\r\nstrengthen his power in his newly won dominions. If Poitou were still in\r\nthe hands of the Count of La Marche and the Viscount of Thouars, the\r\nroyal seneschals of Beaucaire and Carcassonne after 1229 ruled over a\r\nlarge part of the old dominions of Raymond of Toulouse. In 1237 the\r\ntreaty of Meaux was further carried out by the marriage of Raymond's\r\ndaughter and heiress, Joan, to Alfonse, the brother of the French king.\r\nIn 1241 Alfonse came of age, and Louis at once invested him with Poitou\r\nand Auvergne. The lords of Poitou saw that the same process which had\r\ndestroyed the feudal liberties of Normandy now endangered their\r\ndisorderly independence. Hugh of Lusignan and his wife had been present\r\nat Alfonse's investiture, and the widow of King John had gone away\r\nhighly indignant at the slights put upon her dignity.[1] She bitterly\r\nreproached her husband with the ignominy involved in his submission.\r\nEasily moved to new treasons, Hugh became the soul of a league of\r\nPoitevin barons formed at Parthenay, which received the adhesion of\r\nHenry's seneschal of Gascony, Rostand de Sollers, and even of Alfonse's\r\nfather-in-law, the depressed Raymond of Toulouse. At Christmas Hugh\r\nopenly showed his hand. He renounced his homage to Alfonse, declared his\r\nadhesion to his step-son, Richard of Cornwall, the titular count of\r\nPoitou, and ostentatiously withdrew from the court with his wife. The\r\nrest of the winter was taken up with preparations for the forthcoming\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n    [1] See the graphic letter of a citizen of La Rochelle to\r\n    Blanche, published by M. Delisle in _Bibliothèque de l'Ecole\r\n    des Chartes_, série ii., iv., 513-55 (1856).\r\n\r\nUntaught by experience, Henry III. listened to the appeals of his\r\nmother and her husband. Richard of Cornwall, who came back from his\r\ncrusade in January, 1242, was persuaded that he had another chance of\r\nrealising his vain title of Count of Poitou. But the king had neither\r\nmen nor money and the parliament of February 2 refused to grant him\r\nsums adequate for his need, so that, despairing of dealing with his\r\nbarons in a body, Henry followed the legate's example of winning men\r\nover individually. He made a strong protest against the King of\r\nFrance's breach of the existing truce, and his step-father assured him\r\nthat Poitou and Gascony would provide him with sufficient soldiers if\r\nhe brought over enough money to pay them. Thereupon, leaving the\r\nArchbishop of York as regent, Henry took ship on May 9 at Portsmouth\r\nand landed on May 13 at Royan at the mouth of the Gironde. He was\r\naccompanied by Richard of Cornwall, seven earls, and 300 knights.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Louis IX. marshalled a vast host at Chinon, which from April\r\nto July overran the patrimony of the house of Lusignan, and forced many\r\nof the confederate barons to submit. Peter of Savoy and John Mansel,\r\nHenry's favourite clerk, then made seneschal of Gascony, assembled the\r\nAquitanian levies, while Peter of Aigueblanche, the Savoyard Bishop of\r\nHereford, went to Provence to negotiate the union between Earl Richard\r\nand Sanchia, and, if possible, to add Raymond Berengar to the coalition\r\nagainst the husband of his eldest daughter. Henry hoped to win tactical\r\nadvantages by provoking Louis to break the truce, and mendaciously\r\nprotested his surprise at being forced into an unexpected conflict with\r\nhis brother-in-law. Towards the end of July, Louis, who had conquered\r\nall Poitou, advanced to the Charente, and occupied Taillebourg. If the\r\nCharente were once crossed, Saintonge would assuredly follow the\r\ndestinies of Poitou; and the Anglo-Gascon army advanced from Saintes to\r\ndispute the passage of the river. On July 21 the two armies were in\r\npresence of each other, separated only by the Charente. Besides the\r\nstone bridge at Taillebourg, the French had erected a temporary wooden\r\nstructure higher up the stream, and had collected a large number of\r\nboats to facilitate their passage. Seeing with dismay the oriflamme\r\nwaving over the sea of tents which, \"like a great and populous city,\"\r\ncovered the right bank, the soldiers of Henry retreated precipitately\r\nto Saintes. There was imminent danger of their retreat being cut off,\r\nbut Richard of Cornwall went to the French camp, and obtained an\r\narmistice of a few hours, which gave his brother time to reach the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nNext day Louis advanced at his ease to the capital of Saintonge. The\r\nAnglo-Gascons went out to meet him, and, despite their inferior numbers,\r\nfought bravely amidst the vineyards and hollow lanes to the west of the\r\ncity. But the English king was the first to flee, and victory soon\r\nattended the arms of the French. Immediately after the battle, the lords\r\nof Poitou abandoned Richard for Alfonse. Henry fled from Saintes to\r\nPons, from Pons to Barbezieux, and thence sought a more secure refuge at\r\nBlaye, leaving his tent, the ornaments of his chapel, and the beer\r\nprovided for his English soldiers as booty for the enemy. The outbreak\r\nof an epidemic in the French army alone prevented a siege of Bordeaux,\r\nby necessitating the return of St. Louis to the healthier north. Henry\r\nlingered at Bordeaux until September, when he returned to England.[1]\r\nMeanwhile the French dictated peace to the remaining allies of Henry. On\r\nthe death of Raymond of Toulouse, in 1249, Alfonse quietly succeeded to\r\nhis dominions. The next twenty years saw the gradual extension of the\r\nFrench administrative system to Poitou, Auvergne, and the Toulousain.\r\nEnglish Gascony was reduced to little more than the districts round\r\nBordeaux and Bayonne. Even a show of hostility was no longer useful, and\r\non April 7, 1243, a five years' truce between Henry and Louis was signed\r\nat Bordeaux. The marriage of Beatrice of Provence, the youngest of the\r\ndaughters of Raymond Berengar, to Charles of Anjou, Louis' younger\r\nbrother, removed Provence from the sphere of English influence. On his\r\nfather-in-law's death in 1245, Charles of Anjou succeeded to his\r\ndominions to the prejudice of his two English brothers-in-law, and\r\nbecame the founder of a Capetian line of counts of Provence, which\r\nbrought the great fief of the empire under the same northern French\r\ninfluences which Alfonse of Poitiers was diffusing over the lost\r\ninheritances of Eleanor of Aquitaine and the house of Saint-Gilles.\r\n\r\n    [1] The only good modern account of this expedition is that by\r\n    M. Charles Bémont, _La campagne de Poitou, 1242-3_, in _Annales\r\n    du Midi_, v., 389-314 (1893). For the Lusignans see Boissonade,\r\n    _Quomodo comites Engolismenses erga reges Angliæ et Franciæ\r\n    se gesserint_, 1152-1328 (1893).\r\n\r\nA minor result of Louis' triumph was the well-deserved ruin of Hugh of\r\nLusignan and Isabella of Angoulême. The proud spirit of Isabella did\r\nnot long tolerate her humiliation. She retired to Fontevraud and died\r\nthere in 1246. Hugh X. followed her to the tomb in 1248. Their eldest\r\nson, Hugh XI., succeeded him, but the rest of their numerous family\r\nturned for support to the inexhaustible charity of the King of England.\r\nThus in 1247 a Poitevin invasion of the king's half-brothers and\r\nsisters recalled to his much-tried subjects the Savoyard invasion of\r\nten years earlier. In that single year three of the king's brothers and\r\none of his sisters accepted his invitation to make a home in England.\r\nOf these, Guy, lord of Cognac, became proprietor of many estates.\r\nWilliam, called from the Cistercian abbey in which he was born William\r\nof Valence, secured, with the hand of Joan of Munchensi, a claim to the\r\ngreat inheritance that was soon to be scattered by the extinction of\r\nthe male line of the house of Marshal. Aymer of Valence, a very\r\nunclerical churchman, obtained in 1250 his election as bishop of\r\nWinchester, though his youth and the hostility of his chapter delayed\r\nhis consecration for ten years. Alice their sister found a husband of\r\nhigh rank in the young John of Warenne, Earl of Warenne or Surrey,\r\nwhile a daughter of Hugh XI. married Robert of Ferrars, Earl of Ferrars\r\nor Derby. Others of their kindred flocked to the land of promise. Any\r\nPoitevin was welcome, even if not a member of the house of Lusignan.\r\nThus the noble adventurer John du Plessis, came over to England,\r\nmarried the heiress of the Neufbourg Earls of Warwick, and in 1247 was\r\ncreated Earl of Warwick. The alien invasion took a newer and more\r\ngrievous shape.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the war were still to be paid; and in 1244 Henry\r\nassembled a council, declaring that, as he had gone to Gascony on the\r\nadvice of his barons, they were bound to make him a liberal grant\r\ntowards freeing him from the debts which he had incurred beyond sea.\r\nPrelates, earls, and barons each deliberated apart, and a joint\r\ncommittee, composed of four members of each order, drew up an\r\nuncompromising reply. The king had not observed the charters; previous\r\ngrants had been misapplied, and the abeyance of the great offices of\r\nstate made justice difficult and good administration impossible. The\r\ncommittee insisted that a justiciar, a chancellor, and a treasurer\r\nshould forthwith be appointed. This was the last thing that the jealous\r\nking desired. Helpless against a united council, he strove to break up\r\nthe solidarity between its lay and clerical elements by laying a papal\r\norder before the prelates to furnish him an adequate subsidy. The leader\r\nof the bishops was now Grosseteste, who from this time until his death\r\nin 1253 was the pillar of the opposition. \"We must not,\" he declared,\r\n\"be divided from the common counsel, for it is written that if we be\r\ndivided we shall all die forthwith.\" At last a committee of twelve\r\nmagnates was appointed to draw up a plan of reform. The unanimity of all\r\norders was shown by the co-operation on this body of prelates such as\r\nBoniface of Savoy with patriots of the stamp of Grosseteste and Walter\r\nof Cantilupe, while among the secular lords, Richard of Cornwall and\r\n'Simon of Leicester worked together with baronial leaders like Norfolk\r\nand Richard of Montfichet, a survivor of the twenty-five executors of\r\nMagna Carta. The obstinacy of the king may well have driven the estates\r\ninto drawing up the remarkable paper constitution preserved for us by\r\nMatthew Paris.[1] By it the execution of the charters and the\r\nsupervision of the administration were to be entrusted to four\r\ncouncillors, chosen from among the magnates, and irremovable except with\r\ntheir consent. It is unlikely that the scheme was ever carried out; but\r\nits conception shows an advance in the claims of the opposition, and\r\nanticipates the policy of restraining an incompetent ruler by a\r\ncommittee responsible to the estates, which, for the next two centuries,\r\nwas the popular specific for royal maladministration. For the moment\r\nneither side gained a decided victory. Though the barons persisted in\r\ntheir refusal of an extraordinary grant, they agreed to pay an aid to\r\nmarry the king's eldest daughter to the son of Frederick II.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Chron. Maj_., iv., 366-68.\r\n\r\nFurther demands arose from the quarrel between Innocent IV.' and the\r\nemperor. A new papal envoy, Master Martin, came to England to extort\r\nfrom the clergy money to enable Innocent to carry on his war against\r\nFrederick. The lords told Martin that if he did not quit the realm\r\nforthwith he would be torn in pieces. In terror he prayed for a safe\r\nconduct. \"May the devil give you a safe conduct to hell,\" was the only\r\nreply that the angry Henry vouchsafed. Even his complaisance was\r\nexhausted by Master Martin.\r\n\r\nOn July 26, 1245, a few weeks before Martin's expulsion, Innocent IV.\r\nopened a general council at Lyons, in which Frederick was deposed from\r\nthe imperial dignity. Grosseteste, the chief English prelate to attend\r\nthe gathering, was drawn in conflicting directions by his zeal for pope\r\nagainst emperor and by his dislike of curialist exactions. This\r\nattitude of the bishop is reflected in the remonstrance, in the name of\r\nthe English people, laid before Innocent, declaring the faithfulness of\r\nEngland to the Holy See and the wrongs with which her fidelity had been\r\nrequited. The increasing demands for money, the intrusion of aliens\r\ninto English cures, and Martin's exactions were set forth at length.\r\nInnocent refused to entertain the petition, forced all the bishops at\r\nLyons to join in the deprivation of the emperor, and required every\r\nEnglish bishop to seal with his own seal the document by which John had\r\npledged the nation to a yearly tribute. No one could venture to stand\r\nup against the successor of St. Peter, and so, despite futile\r\nremonstrance, Innocent still had it all his own way. In 1250\r\nGrosseteste again met Innocent face to face at Lyons, and urged him to\r\n\"put to flight the evils and purge the abominations\" which the Roman\r\nsee had done so much to foster. But this outspoken declaration was\r\nequally without result. Bold as were Grosseteste's words, he fully\r\naccepted the curialist theory which regarded the pope as the universal\r\nbishop, the divinely appointed source of all ecclesiastical\r\njurisdiction. He could therefore do no more than protest. If the pope\r\nchose to disregard him, there was nothing to be done but wait patiently\r\nfor better times. The plague of foreign ecclesiastics was still to\r\ntorment the English Church for many a year.\r\n\r\nThe king's difficulties were increased by fresh troubles in Scotland\r\nand Wales. The friendship between Henry and his brother-in-law,\r\nAlexander II., was weakened by the death of the Queen of Scots and by\r\nAlexander's marriage to a French lady in 1239. At last, in 1244,\r\nrelations were so threatening that the English levies were mustered for\r\na campaign at Newcastle. However, on the mediation of Richard of\r\nCornwall, Alexander bound himself not to make alliances with England's\r\nenemies, and the trouble passed away. In Wales the difficulties were\r\nmore complicated. Llewelyn ap Iorwerth died in 1240, full of years and\r\nhonour. In the last years of his reign broken health and the revolts of\r\nhis eldest son Griffith made the old chieftain anxious for peace with\r\nEngland, as the best way of securing the succession to all his\r\ndominions of David, his son by Joan of Anjou. Henry III., anxious that\r\nDavid as his nephew should inherit the principality, granted a\r\ntemporary cessation of hostilities. After Llewelyn's death David was\r\naccepted as Prince of Snowdon, and made his way to Gloucester, where he\r\nperformed homage, and was dubbed knight by his uncle. Next year,\r\nhowever, hostilities broke out, and Henry, disgusted with his nephew,\r\nmade a treaty with the wife of Griffith, Griffith himself being David's\r\nprisoner. In 1241 Henry led an expedition from Chester into North\r\nWales, and forced David to submit. He surrendered Griffith to his\r\nuncle's safe keeping and promised to yield his principality to Henry if\r\nhe died without a son. Three years later Griffith broke his neck in an\r\nattempt to escape from the Tower. The death of his rival emboldened\r\nDavid to take up a stronger line against his uncle. A fresh Welsh\r\nexpedition was necessary for the summer of 1245, in which the English\r\nadvanced to the Conway, but were speedily forced to retire. David held\r\nhis own until his death, without issue, in March, 1246, threw open the\r\nquestion of the Welsh succession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL RETROGRESSION AND NATIONAL PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ten years from 1248 to 1258 saw the continuance of the\r\nmisgovernment, discontent, and futile opposition which have already\r\nbeen sufficiently illustrated. The history of those years must be\r\nsought not so much in the relations of the king and his English\r\nsubjects as in Gascony, in Wales, in the crusading revival, and in the\r\nculmination of the struggle of papacy and empire. In each of these\r\nfields the course of events reacted sharply upon the domestic affairs\r\nof England, until at last the failures of Henry's foreign policy gave\r\nunity and determination to the party of opposition whose first\r\norganised success, in 1258, ushered in the Barons' War.\r\n\r\nThe relations between England and France remained anomalous. Formal\r\npeace was impossible, since France would yield nothing, and the English\r\nking still claimed Normandy and Aquitaine. Yet neither Henry nor Louis\r\nhad any wish for war. They had married sisters: they were personally\r\nfriendly, and were both lovers of peace. In such circumstances it was\r\nnot hard to arrange truces from time to time, so that from 1243 to the\r\nend of the reign there were no open hostilities. In 1248 the friendly\r\nfeeling of the two courts was particularly strong. Louis was on the eve\r\nof departure for the crusade and many English nobles had taken the\r\ncross. Henry, who was himself contemplating a crusade, was of no mind\r\nto avail himself of his kinsman's absence to disturb his realm.\r\n\r\nThe French could afford to pass over Henry's neglect to do homage, for\r\nGascony seemed likely to emancipate itself from the yoke of its English\r\ndukes without any prompting from Paris. After the failure of 1243, a\r\nlimited amount of territory between the Dordogne and the Pyrenees alone\r\nacknowledged Henry. This narrower Gascony was a thoroughly feudalised\r\nland: the absentee dukes had little authority, domain, or revenue: and\r\nthe chief lordships were held by magnates, whose relations to their\r\noverlord were almost formal, and by municipalities almost as free as\r\nthe cities of Flanders or the empire. The disastrous campaign of\r\nTaiilebourg lessened the prestige of the duke, and Henry quitted\r\nGascony without so much as attempting to settle its affairs. In the\r\nfollowing years weak seneschals, with insufficient powers and quickly\r\nsucceeding each other, were unable to grapple with ever-increasing\r\ntroubles. The feudal lords dominated the countryside, pillaged traders,\r\nwaged internal war and defied the authority of the duke. In the\r\nautonomous towns factions had arisen as fierce as those of the cities\r\nof Italy. Bordeaux was torn asunder by the feuds of the Rosteins and\r\nColons. Bayonne was the scene of a struggle between a few privileged\r\nfamilies, which sought to monopolise municipal office, and a popular\r\nopposition based upon the seafaring class. The neighbouring princes\r\ncast greedy eyes on a land so rich, divided, and helpless. Theobald\r\nIV., the poet, Count of Champagne and King of Navarre, coveted the\r\nvalley of the Adour. Gaston, Viscount of Béarn, the cousin of Queen\r\nEleanor, plundered and destroyed the town of Dax. Ferdinand the Saint\r\nof Castile and James I. of Aragon severally claimed all Gascony. Behind\r\nall these loomed the agents of the King of France. Either Gascony must\r\nfall away altogether, or stronger measures must be taken to preserve\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn this extremity Henry made Simon of Montfort seneschal or governor of\r\nGascony, with exceptionally full powers and an assured duration of\r\noffice for seven years. Simon had taken the crusader's vow, but was\r\npersuaded by the king to abandon his intention of following Louis to\r\nEgypt. He at once threw himself into his rude task with an energy that\r\nshowed him to be a true son of the Albigensian crusader. In the first\r\nthree months he traversed the duchy from end to end; rallied the royal\r\npartisans; defeated rebels; kept external foes in check, and\r\nadministered the law without concern for the privileges of the great.\r\nIn 1249 he crushed the Rostein faction at Bordeaux. The same fate was\r\nmeted out to their partisans in the country districts. Order was\r\nrestored, but the seneschal utterly disregarded impartiality or\r\njustice. He sought to rule Gascony by terrorism and by backing up one\r\nfaction against the other. It was the same with minor cities, like\r\nBazas and Bayonne, and with the tyrants of the countryside. The\r\nViscount of Fronsac saw his castle razed and his estates seized. Gaston\r\nof Béarn, tricked by the seneschal out of the succession of Bigorre,\r\nwas captured, sent to England, and only allowed to return to his home,\r\nhumiliated and powerless to work further evil. The lesser barons had to\r\nacknowledge Simon their master. On the death of Raymond of Toulouse in\r\n1249, his son-in-law and successor, Alfonse of Poitiers, had all he\r\ncould do to secure his inheritance, and was too closely bound by the\r\npacific policy of his brother to give Simon much trouble. The truce\r\nwith France was easily renewed by reason of St. Louis' absence on a\r\ncrusade. The differences between Gascony and Theobald of Navarre were\r\nmitigated in 1248 at a personal interview between Leicester and the\r\npoet-king.\r\n\r\nGascony for the moment was so quiet that the rebellious hordes called\r\nthe _Pastoureaux_, who had desolated the royal domain, withdrew from\r\nBordeaux in terror of Simon's threats. But the expense of maintaining\r\norder pressed heavily on the seneschal's resources, and his master\r\nshowed little disposition to assist him. Moreover Gascony could not\r\nlong keep quiet. There were threats of fresh insurrections, and the\r\nwhole land was burning with indignation against its governor.\r\nComplaints from the Gascon estates soon flowed with great abundance\r\ninto Westminster. For the moment Henry paid little attention to them.\r\nHis son Edward was ten years of age, and he was thinking of providing\r\nhim with an appanage, sufficient to support a separate household and so\r\nplaced as to train the young prince in the duties of statecraft. Before\r\nNovember, 1249, he granted to Edward all Gascony, along with the\r\nprofits of the government of Ireland, which were set aside to put\r\nGascony in a good state of defence. Simon's strong hand was now more\r\nthan ever necessary to keep the boy's unruly subjects under control.\r\nThe King therefore continued Simon as seneschal of Gascony, though\r\nhenceforth the earl acted as Edward's minister. \"Complete happily,\"\r\nHenry wrote to the seneschal, \"all our affairs in Gascony and you shall\r\nreceive from us and our heirs a recompense worthy of your services.\"\r\nFor the moment Leicester's triumph seemed complete, but the Gascons,\r\nwho had hoped that Edward's establishment meant the removal of their\r\nmasterful governor, were bitterly disappointed at the continuance of\r\nhis rule. Profiting by Simon's momentary absence in England, they once\r\nmore rose in revolt. Henry wavered for the moment. \"Bravely,\" declared\r\nhe to his brother-in-law, \"hast thou fought for me, and I will not deny\r\nthee help. But complaints pour in against thee. They say that thou hast\r\nthrown into prison, and condemned to death, folk who have been summoned\r\nto thy court under pledge of thy good faith.\" In the end Simon was sent\r\nback to Gascony, and by May, 1251, the rebels were subdued.\r\n\r\nNext year Gaston of Béarn stirred up another revolt, and, while Simon\r\nwas in England, deputies from the Aquitanian cities crossed the sea and\r\nlaid new complaints before Henry. A stormy scene ensued between the\r\nking and his brother-in-law. Threatened with the loss of his office,\r\nSimon insisted that he had been appointed for seven years, and that he\r\ncould not be removed without his own consent. Henry answered that he\r\nwould keep no compacts with traitors. \"That word is a lie,\" cried\r\nSimon; \"were you not my king it would be an ill hour for you when you\r\ndared to utter it.\" The sympathy of the magnates saved Leicester from\r\nthe king's wrath, and before long he returned to Gascony, still\r\nseneschal, but with authority impaired by the want of his sovereign's\r\nconfidence. Though the king henceforth sided with the rebels, Simon\r\nremained strong enough to make headway against the lord of Béarn.\r\nBefore long, however, Leicester unwillingly agreed to vacate his office\r\non receiving from Henry a sum of money. In September, 1252, he laid\r\ndown the seneschalship and retired into France. While shabbily treated\r\nby the king, he had certainly shown an utter absence of tact or\r\nscruple. But the tumults of Gascony raged with more violence than ever\r\nnow that his strong hand was withdrawn. Those who had professed to rise\r\nagainst the seneschal remained in arms against the king. Once more the\r\nneighbouring princes cast greedy eyes on the defenceless duchy. In\r\nparticular, Alfonso the Wise, King of Castile, who succeeded his father\r\nFerdinand in 1252, renewed his father's claims to Gascony.\r\n\r\nThe only way to save the duchy was for Henry to go there in person.\r\nLong delays ensued before the royal visit took place, and it was not\r\nuntil August, 1253, that Bordeaux saw her hereditary duke sail up the\r\nGironde to her quays. The Gascon capital remained faithful, but within\r\na few miles of her walls the rebels were everywhere triumphant. It\r\nrequired a long siege to reduce Bénauge to submission, and months\r\nelapsed before the towns and castles of the lower Garonne and Dordogne\r\nopened their gates. Even then La Réole, whither all the worst enemies\r\nof Montfort had fled, held out obstinately. Despairing of military\r\nsuccess, Henry fell back upon diplomacy. The strength of the Gascon\r\nrevolt did not lie in the power of the rebels themselves but in the\r\nsupport of the neighbouring princes and the French crown. By renewing\r\nthe truce with the representatives of Louis, Henry protected himself\r\nfrom the danger of French intervention, and at the same time he cut off\r\na more direct source of support to the rebels by negotiating treaties\r\nwith such magnates as the lord of Albret, the Counts of Comminges and\r\nArmagnac, and the Viscount of Béarn. His master-stroke was the\r\nconclusion, in April, 1254, of a peace with Alfonso of Castile, whereby\r\nthe Spanish king abandoned his Gascon allies and renounced his claims\r\non the duchy. In return it was agreed that the lord Edward should marry\r\nAlfonso's half-sister, Eleanor, heiress of the county of Ponthieu\r\nthrough her mother, Joan, whom Henry had once sought for his queen. As\r\nEdward's appanage included Aquitaine, Alfonso, in renouncing his\r\npersonal claims, might seem to be but transferring them to his sister.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1254, Queen Eleanor joined Henry at Bordeaux. With her went her\r\ntwo sons, Edward and Edmund, her uncle, Archbishop Boniface, and a great\r\ncrowd of magnates. In August Edward went with his mother to Alfonso's\r\ncourt at Burgos, where he was welcomed with all honour and dubbed to\r\nknighthood by the King of Castile, and in October he and Eleanor were\r\nmarried at the Cistercian monastery of Las Huelgas. His appanage\r\nincluded all Ireland, the earldom of Chester, the king's lands in Wales,\r\nthe Channel Islands, the whole of Gascony, and whatsoever rights his\r\nfather still had over the lands taken from him and King John by the\r\nKings of France. Thus he became the ruler of all the outlying\r\ndependencies of the English crown, and the representative of all the\r\nclaims on the Aquitanian inheritance of Eleanor and the Norman\r\ninheritance of William the Conqueror. The caustic St. Alban's chronicler\r\ndeclared that Henry left to himself such scanty possessions that he\r\nbecame a \"mutilated kinglet\".[1] But Henry was too jealous of power\r\nutterly to renounce so large a share of his dominions. His grants to his\r\nson were for purposes of revenue and support, and the government of\r\nthese regions was still strictly under the royal control. Yet from this\r\nmoment writs ran in Edward's name, and under his father's direction the\r\nyoung prince was free to buy his experience as he would. Soon after his\r\nson's return with his bride, Henry III. quitted Gascony, making his way\r\nhome through France, where he visited his mother's tomb at Fontevraud\r\nand made atonement at Pontigny before the shrine of Archbishop Edmund.\r\nOf more importance was his visit to King Louis, recently returned from\r\nhis Egyptian captivity. The cordial relations established by personal\r\nintercourse between the two kings prepared the way for peace two years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n    [1] Matthew Paris, _Chron. Maj._, v., 450.\r\n\r\nEdward remained in Gascony about a year after his father. He checked\r\nwith a stern hand the disorders of his duchy, strove to make peace\r\nbetween the Rosteins and Colons, and failing to do so, took in 1261 the\r\ndecisive step of putting an end to the tumultuous municipal\r\nindependence of the Gascon capital by depriving the jurats of the right\r\nof choosing their mayor.[1] Thenceforth Bordeaux was ruled by a\r\nmayor nominated by the duke or his lieutenant. Edward's rule in Gascony\r\nhas its importance as the first experiment in government by the boy of\r\nfifteen who was later to become so great a king. Returning to London in\r\nNovember, 1255, he still forwarded the interests of his Gascon\r\nsubjects, and an attempt to protect the Bordeaux wine-merchants from\r\nthe exactions of the royal officers aroused the jealousy of Henry, who\r\ndeclared that the days of Henry II. had come again, when the king's\r\nsons rose in revolt against their father. Despite this characteristic\r\nwail, Edward gained his point. Yet his efforts to secure the well-being\r\nof Gascony had not produced much result. The hold of the English duke\r\non Aquitaine was as precarious under Edward as it had been in the days\r\nof Henry's direct rule.\r\n\r\n    [1] See Bémont, _Rôles Gascons_, i., supplément, pp.\r\n    cxvi.-cxviii.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Wales and Cheshire involved Edward in responsibilities\r\neven more pressing than those of Gascony. On the death of John the Scot\r\nwithout heirs in 1237, the palatinate of Randolph of Blundeville became\r\na royal escheat. Its grant to Edward made him the natural head of the\r\nmarcher barons. The Cheshire earldom became the more important since\r\nthe Welsh power had been driven beyond the Conway. Since the death of\r\nDavid ap Llewelyn in 1246, divisions in the reigning house of Gwynedd\r\nhad continued to weaken the Welsh. Llewelyn and Owen the Red, the two\r\nelder sons of the Griffith ap Llewelyn who had perished in attempting\r\nto escape from the Tower, took upon themselves the government of\r\nGwynedd, dividing the land, by the advice of the \"good men,\" into two\r\nequal halves. The English seneschal at Carmarthen took advantage of\r\ntheir weakness to seize the outlying dependencies of Gwynedd south of\r\nthe Dovey. War ensued, for the brothers resisted this aggression. But\r\nin April, 1247, they were forced to do homage at Woodstock for Gwynedd\r\nand Snowdon. Henry retained not only Cardigan and Carmarthen, but the\r\ndebatable lands between the eastern boundary of Cheshire and the river\r\nClwyd, the four cantreds of the middle country or Perveddwlad, so long\r\nthe scene of the fiercest warfare between the Celt and the Saxon. Thus\r\nthe work of Llewelyn ap Iorwerth was completely undone, and his\r\ngrandsons were confined to Snowdon and Anglesey, the ancient cradles of\r\ntheir house.\r\n\r\nIt suited English policy that even, the barren lands of Snowdon should\r\nbe divided. As time went on, other sons of Griffith ap Llewelyn began\r\nto clamour for a share of their grandfather's inheritance. Owen, the\r\nweaker of the two princes, made common cause with them, and David,\r\nanother brother, succeeded in obtaining his portion of the common\r\nstock. Llewelyn showed himself so much the most resourceful and\r\nenergetic of the brethren that, when open war broke out between them in\r\n1254, he easily obtained the victory. Owen was taken prisoner, and\r\nDavid was deprived of his lands. Llewelyn, thus sole ruler of Gwynedd,\r\nat once aspired to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather. He\r\noverran Merioneth, and frightened the native chieftains beyond the\r\nDovey into the English camp. His ambitions were, however, rudely\r\nchecked by the grant of Cheshire and the English lands in Wales to\r\nEdward.\r\n\r\nBesides the border palatinate, Edward's Welsh lands included the four\r\ncantreds of Perveddwlad, and the districts of Cardigan and Carmarthen.\r\nYoung as he was, he had competent advisers, and, while he was still in\r\nAquitaine, designs were formed of setting up the English shire system\r\nin his Welsh lands, so as to supersede the traditional Celtic methods\r\nof government by feudal and monarchical centralisation. Efforts were\r\nmade to subject the four cantreds to the shire courts at Chester; and\r\nGeoffrey of Langley, Edward's agent in the south, set up shire-moots at\r\nCardigan and Carmarthen, from which originated the first beginnings of\r\nthose counties. The bitterest indignation animated Edward's Welsh\r\ntenants, whether on the Clwyd or on the Teivi and Towy. They rose in\r\nrevolt against the alien innovators, and called upon Llewelyn to\r\nchampion their grievances. Llewelyn saw the chance of extending his\r\ntribal power into a national principality over all Wales by posing as\r\nthe upholder of the Welsh people. He overran the four cantreds in a\r\nweek, finding no resistance save before the two castles of Deganwy and\r\nDiserth. He conquered Cardigan with equal ease, and prudently granted\r\nout his acquisition to the local chieftain Meredith ap Owen. Nor were\r\nEdward's lands alone exposed to his assaults. In central Wales Roger\r\nMortimer was stripped of his marches on the upper Wye, and Griffith ap\r\nGwenwynwyn, the lord of upper Powys, driven from the regions of the\r\nupper Severn. In the spring of 1257 the lord of Gwynedd appeared in\r\nregions untraversed by the men of Snowdon since the days of his\r\ngrandfather. He devastated the lands of the marchers on the Bristol\r\nChannel and slew Edward's deputy in battle. \"In those days,\" says\r\nMatthew Paris, \"the Welsh saw that their lives were at stake, so that\r\nthose of the north joined together in indissoluble alliance with those\r\nof the south. Such a union had never before been, since north and south\r\nhad always been opposed.\" The lord of Snowdon assumed the title of\r\nPrince of Wales.\r\n\r\nEdward was forced to defend his inheritance. Henry III. paid little\r\nheed to his misfortunes, and answered his appeal for help by saying:\r\n\"What have I to do with the matter? I have given you the land; you must\r\ndefend it with your own resources. I have plenty of other business to\r\ndo.\" Nevertheless, Henry accompanied his son on a Welsh campaign in\r\nAugust, 1257. The English army got no further than Deganwy, and\r\ntherefore did not really invade Llewelyn's dominions at all. After\r\nwaiting idly on the banks of the Conway for some weeks, it retired\r\nhome, leaving the open country to be ruled by Llewelyn as he would, and\r\nhaving done nothing but revictual the castles of the four cantreds.\r\nNext year a truce was made, which left Llewelyn in possession of the\r\ndisputed districts. Troubles at home were calling off both father and\r\nson from the Welsh war, and thus Llewelyn secured his virtual triumph.\r\nThough fear of the progress of the lord of Gwynedd filled every marcher\r\nwith alarm, yet the dread of the power of Edward was even more nearly\r\npresent before them. The marcher lords deliberately stood aside, and\r\nthe result was inevitable disaster. Edward found that the territories\r\nhanded over to him by his father had to be conquered before they could\r\nbe administered, and Henry III.'s methods of government made it a\r\nhopeless business to find either the men or the money for the task.\r\n\r\nEngland still resounded with complaints of misgovernment, and demands\r\nfor the execution of the charters. Before going to Bordeaux in 1253,\r\nHenry obtained from the reluctant parliament a considerable subsidy,\r\nand pledged himself as \"a man, a Christian, a knight, and a crowned and\r\nanointed king,\" to uphold the charters. During his absence a\r\nparliament, summoned by the regents, Queen Eleanor and Richard of\r\nCornwall, for January, 1254, showed such unwillingness to grant a\r\nsupply that a fresh assembly was convened in April, to which knights of\r\nthe shire, for the first time since the reign of John, and\r\nrepresentatives of the diocesan clergy, for the first occasion on\r\nrecord, were summoned, as well as the baronial and clerical grandees.\r\nNothing came of the meeting save fresh complaints. The Earl of\r\nLeicester became the spokesman of the opposition. Hurrying back from\r\nFrance he warned the parliament not to fall into the \"mouse-traps\" laid\r\nfor them by the king. In default of English money, enough to meet the\r\nking's necessities was extorted from the Jews, recently handed over to\r\nthe custody of Richard of Cornwall. After his return from France at the\r\nend of 1254, Henry's renewed requests for money gave coherence to the\r\nopposition. Between 1254 and 1258 the king's exactions, and an\r\neffective organisation for withstanding them, developed on parallel\r\nlines. To the old sources of discontent were added grievances\r\nproceeding from enterprises of so costly a nature that they at last\r\nbrought about a crisis.\r\n\r\nThe foremost grievance against the king was still his co-operation with\r\nthe papacy in spoiling the Church of England. Though the death of the\r\nexcommunicated Frederick II. in 1250 was a great gain for Innocent IV.,\r\nthe contest of the papacy against the Hohenstaufen raged as fiercely as\r\never. Both in Germany and in Italy Innocent had to carry on his\r\nstruggle against Conrad, Frederick's son. After Conrad's death, in\r\n1254, there was still Frederick's strenuous bastard, Manfred, to be\r\nreckoned with in Naples and Sicily. Innocent IV. died in 1254, but his\r\nsuccessor, Alexander IV., continued his policy. A papalist King of\r\nNaples was wanted to withstand Manfred, and also a papalist successor\r\nto the pope's phantom King of the Romans, William of Holland, who died\r\nin 1256.\r\n\r\nCandidates to both crowns were sought for in England. Since 1250\r\nInnocent IV. had been sounding Richard, Earl of Cornwall, as to his\r\nwillingness to accept Sicily. The honourable scruple against hostility\r\nto his kinsman, which Richard shared with the king, prevented him from\r\nsetting up his claims against Conrad. But the deaths both of Conrad and\r\nof Frederick II.'s son by Isabella of England weakened the ties between\r\nthe English royal house and the Hohenstaufen, and Henry was tempted by\r\nInnocent's offer of the Sicilian throne for his younger son, Edmund, a\r\nboy of nine, along with a proposal to release him from his vow of\r\ncrusade to Syria, if he would prosecute on his son's behalf a crusading\r\ncampaign against the enemies of the Church in Naples. Innocent died\r\nbefore the negotiations were completed, but Alexander IV. renewed the\r\noffer, and in April, 1255, Peter of Aigueblanche, Bishop of Hereford,\r\naccepted the preferred kingdom in Edmund's name. Sicily was to be held\r\nby a tribute of money and service, as a fief of the holy see, and was\r\nnever to be united with the empire. Henry was to do homage to the pope\r\non his son's behalf, to go to Italy in person or send thither a\r\ncompetent force, and to reimburse the pope for the large sums expended\r\nby him in the prosecution of the war. In return the English and\r\nScottish proceeds of the crusading tenth, imposed on the clergy at\r\nLyons, were to be paid to Henry. On October 18, 1255, a cardinal\r\ninvested Edmund with a ring that symbolised his appointment. Henry\r\nstood before the altar and swore by St. Edward that he would himself go\r\nto Apulia, as soon as he could safely pass through France.\r\n\r\nThe treaty remained a dead letter. Henry found it quite impossible to\r\nraise either the men or the money promised, and abandoned any idea of\r\nvisiting Sicily in person. Meanwhile Naples and Sicily were united in\r\nsupport of Manfred, and discomfited the feeble forces of the papal\r\nlegates who acted against him in Edmund's name. At last the Archbishop\r\nof Messina came from the pope with an urgent request for payment of the\r\npromised sums. It was in vain that Henry led forth his son, clothed in\r\nApulian dress, before the Lenten parliament of 1257, and begged the\r\nmagnates to enable him to redeem his bond. When they heard the king's\r\nspeech \"the ears of all men tingled\". Nothing could be got save from\r\nthe clergy, so that Henry was quite unable to meet his obligations. He\r\nbesought Alexander to give him time, to make terms with Manfred, to\r\nrelease Edmund from his debts on condition of ceding a large part of\r\nApulia to the Church,--to do anything in short save insist upon the\r\noriginal contract. The pope deferred the payment, but the respite did\r\nHenry no good. Edmund's Sicilian monarchy vanished into nothing, when,\r\nearly in 1258, Manfred was crowned king at Palermo. Before the end of\r\nthe year, Alexander cancelled the grant of Sicily to Edmund. Yet his\r\ndemands for the discharge of Henry's obligations had contributed not a\r\nlittle towards focussing the gathering discontent.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] For Edmund's Sicilian claims, see W.E. Rhodes' article on\r\n    _Edmund, Earl of Lancaster_, in the _English Historical\r\n    Review_, x. (1895), 20-27.\r\n\r\nWhile Henry was seeking the Sicilian crown for his son, his brother\r\nRichard was elected to the German throne. Since William of Holland's\r\ndeath in January, 1256, the German magnates, divided between the\r\nHohenstaufen and the papalist parties, had hesitated for nearly a year\r\nas to the choice of his successor. As neither party was able to secure\r\nthe election of its own partisan, a compromise was mooted. At last the\r\nname of Richard of Cornwall was brought definitely forward. He was of\r\nhigh rank and unblemished reputation; a friend of the pope yet a kinsman\r\nof the Hohenstaufen; he was moderate and conciliatory; he had enough\r\nmoney to bribe the electors handsomely, and he was never likely to be so\r\ndeeply rooted in Germany as to stand in the way of the princes of the\r\nempire. The Archbishop of Cologne became his paid partisan, and the\r\nCount Palatine of the Rhine accepted his candidature on conditions. The\r\nFrench party set up as his rival Alfonso X. of Castile, who, despite his\r\nnewly formed English alliance, was quite willing to stand against\r\nRichard. At last, in January, 1257, the votes of three electors,\r\nCologne, Mainz, and the Palatine, were cast for Richard, who also\r\nobtained the support of Ottocar, King of Bohemia. However, in April,\r\nTrier, Saxony, and Brandenburg voted for Alfonso. The double election of\r\ntwo foreigners perpetuated the Great Interregnum for some sixteen years.\r\nAlfonso's title was only an empty show, but Richard took his appointment\r\nseriously. He made his way to Germany, and was crowned King of the\r\nRomans on May 17, 1257, at Aachen. He remained in the country nearly\r\neighteen months, and succeeded in establishing his authority in the\r\nRhineland, though beyond that region he never so much as showed his\r\nface.[1] The elevation of his brother to the highest dignity in\r\nChristendom was some consolation to Henry for the Sicilian failure.\r\n\r\n    [1] See for Richard's career, Koch's _Richard von Cornwallis_,\r\n    1209-1257, and the article on _Richard, King of the Romans_, in\r\n    the _Dictionary of National Biography_.\r\n\r\nThe nation was disgusted to see maladministration grow worse and worse;\r\nthe nobles were indignant at the ever-increasing sway of the\r\nforeigners; and several years of bad harvests, high prices, rain,\r\nflood, and murrain sharpened the chronic misery of the poor. The\r\nwithdrawal of Earl Richard to his new kingdom deprived the king and\r\nnation of an honourable if timid counsellor, though a more capable\r\nleader was at last provided in the disgraced governor of Gascony. Simon\r\nstill deeply resented the king's ingratitude for his services, and had\r\nbecome enough of an Englishman to sympathise with the national\r\nfeelings. Since his dismissal in 1253 he had held somewhat aloof from\r\npolitics. He knew so well that his interests centred in England that he\r\ndeclined the offer of the French regency on the death of Blanche of\r\nCastile. He prosecuted his rights over Bigorre with characteristic\r\npertinacity, and lawsuits about his wife's jointure from her first\r\nhusband exacerbated his relations with Henry. It cannot, however, be\r\nsaid that the two were as yet fiercely hostile. Simon went to Henry's\r\nhelp in Gascony in 1254, served on various missions and was nominated\r\non others from which he withdrew. His chosen occupations during these\r\nyears of self-effacement were religious rather than political; his\r\ndearest comrades were clerks rather than barons.\r\n\r\nAmong Montfort's closer intimates, Bishop Grosseteste was removed by\r\ndeath in 1253. But others of like stamp still remained, such as Adam\r\nMarsh, the Franciscan mystic, whose election to the see of Ely was\r\nquashed by the malevolence of the court; Eudes Rigaud, the famous\r\nArchbishop of Rouen, and Walter of Cantilupe, Bishop of Worcester, who\r\nformed a connecting link between the aristocracy and the Church.\r\nDespite the ineffectiveness of the clerical opposition to the papacy,\r\nthe spirit of independence expressed in Grosseteste's protests had not\r\nyet deserted the churchmen. Clerks had felt the pinch of the papal\r\nexactions, had been bled to the uttermost to support the Sicilian\r\ncandidature, and had seen aliens and non-residents usurping their\r\nrevenues and their functions. More timid and less cohesive than the\r\nbarons, they had quicker brains, more ideas, deeper grievances, and\r\nbetter means of reaching the masses. If resentment of the Sicilian\r\ncandidature was the spark that fired the train, the clerical opposition\r\nshowed the barons the method of successful resistance. The rejection of\r\nHenry's demands for money in the assemblies of 1257 started the\r\nmovement that spread to the baronage in the parliaments of 1258. In the\r\ntwo memorable gatherings of that year the discontent, which had\r\nsmouldered for a generation, at last burst into flame. In the next\r\nchapter we shall see in what fashion the fire kindled.\r\n\r\nThe futility of the political history of the weary middle period of the\r\nreign suggests, to those who make the history of the state the\r\ncriterion of every aspect of the national fortunes, a corresponding\r\nbarrenness and lack of interest in other aspects of national life. Yet\r\na remedy for Henry's misrule was only found because the age of\r\npolitical retrogression was in all other fields of action an epoch of\r\nunexampled progress. The years during which the strong centralised\r\ngovernment of the Angevin kings was breaking down under Henry's weak\r\nrule were years which, to the historian of civilisation, are among the\r\nmost fruitful in our annals. In vivid contrast to the tale of misrule,\r\nthe historian can turn to the revival of religious and intellectual\r\nlife, the growing delight in ideas and knowledge, the consummation of\r\nthe best period of art, and the spread of a nobler civilisation which\r\nmake the middle portion of the thirteenth century the flowering time of\r\nEnglish medieval life. It is part of this strange contrast that Henry,\r\nthe obstacle to all political progress, was himself a chief supporter\r\nof the religious and intellectual movements which were so deeply\r\ninfluencing the age.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said of the alien invasion, and of the strong national\r\nopposition it excited. But insularity is not a good thing in itself,\r\nand the natural English attitude to the foreigners tended to confound\r\ngood and bad alike in a general condemnation. Even the Savoyards were\r\nby no means as evil as the English thought them, and Henry in welcoming\r\nhis kinsmen was not merely moved by selfish and unworthy motives; he\r\nbelieved that he was showing his openness to ideas and his welcome to\r\nall good things from whencesoever they came. There were, in fact, two\r\ntendencies, antagonistic yet closely related, which were operative, not\r\nonly in England but all over western Europe, during this period.\r\nNations, becoming conscious and proud of their unity, dwelt, often\r\nunreasonably, on the points wherein they differed from other peoples,\r\nand strongly resented alien interference. At the same time the closer\r\nrelations between states, the result of improved government, better\r\ncommunications, increased commercial and social intercourse, the\r\nstrengthening of common ideals, and the development of cosmopolitan\r\ntypes of the knight, the scholar, and the priest, were deepening the\r\nunion of western Christendom on common lines. Neither the political nor\r\nthe military nor the ecclesiastical ideals of the early middle ages\r\nwere based upon nationality, but rather on that ecumenical community of\r\ntradition which still made the rule of Rome, whether in Church or\r\nState, a living reality. In the thirteenth century the papal tradition\r\nwas still at its height. The jurisdiction of the papal _curia_ implied\r\na universal Christian commonwealth. World-wide religious orders united\r\nalien lands together by ties more spiritual than obedience to the papal\r\nlawyers. The academic ideal was another and a fresh link that connected\r\nthe nations together. To the ancient reasons for union--symbolised by\r\nthe living Latin speech of all clerks, of all scholars, of all engaged\r\nin serious affairs-were added the newer bonds of connexion involved in\r\nthe common knightly and social ideals, in the general spread of a\r\ncommon art and a common vernacular language and literature.\r\n\r\nAs Latin expressed the one series of ties, so did French represent the\r\nother. The France of St. Louis meant two things. It meant, of course,\r\nthe French state and the French nationality, but it meant a great deal\r\nmore than that. The influence of the French tongue and French ideals\r\nwas wider than the political influence of the French monarchy. French\r\nwas the common language of knighthood, of policy, of the literature\r\nthat entertained lords and ladies, of the lighter and less technical\r\nsides of the cosmopolitan culture which had its more serious\r\nembodiments in Latin. To the Englishman of the thirteenth century the\r\nFrench state was the enemy; but the English baron denounced France in\r\nthe French tongue, and leant a ready ear to those aspects of life\r\nwhich, cosmopolitan in reality, found their fullest exposition in\r\nFrance and among French-speaking peoples. In the age which saw\r\nhostility to Frenchmen become a passion, a Frenchman like Montfort\r\ncould become the champion of English patriotism, English scholars could\r\nreadily quit their native land to study at Paris, the French vernacular\r\nliterature was the common property of the two peoples, and French words\r\nbegan to force their way into the stubborn vocabulary of the English\r\nlanguage, which for two centuries had almost entirely rejected these\r\nalien elements. In dwelling, however briefly, on the new features which\r\nwere transforming English civilisation during this memorable period, we\r\nshall constantly see how England gained by her ever-increasing\r\nintercourse with the continent, by necessarily sharing in the new\r\nmovements which had extended from the continent to the island, no\r\nlonger, as in the eleventh century, to be described as a world apart.\r\nNeither the coming of the friars, nor the development of university\r\nlife and academic schools of philosophy, theology, and natural science,\r\nnor the triumph of gothic art, nor the spread of vernacular literature,\r\nnot even the scholarly study of English law nor the course of English\r\npolitical development-not one of these movements could have been what\r\nit was without the close interconnexion of the various parts of the\r\nEuropean commonwealth, which was becoming more homogeneous at the same\r\ntime that its units were acquiring for themselves sped characteristics\r\nof their own.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of Henry III.'s reign, a modest alien invasion\r\nanticipated the more noisy coming of the Poitevin or the Provençal. The\r\nmost remarkable development of the \"religious\" life that the later\r\nmiddle age was to witness had just been worked out in Italy. St.\r\nFrancis of Assisi had taught the cult of absolute poverty, and his\r\nexample held up to his followers the ideal of the thorough and literal\r\nimitation of Christ's life. Thus arose the early beginnings of the\r\nMinorite or Franciscan rule. St. Dominic yielded to the fascination of\r\nthe Umbrian enthusiast, and inculcated on his Order of Preachers a\r\ncomplete renunciation of worldly goods which made a society, originally\r\nlittle more than a new type of canons regular, a mendicant order like\r\nthe Franciscans, bound to interpret the monastic vow of poverty with\r\nsuch literalness as to include corporate as well as individual\r\nrenunciation of possessions, so that the order might not own lands or\r\ngoods, and no member of it could live otherwise than by labour or by\r\nalms. In the second chapter of the Dominican order, at Whitsuntide,\r\n1221, an organisation into provinces was carried out; and among the\r\neight provinces, each with its prior, then instituted, was the province\r\nof England, where no preaching friar had hitherto set foot, and over it\r\nGilbert of Freynet was appointed prior. Then Dominic withdrew to\r\nBologna, where he died on August 6. Within a few days of the saint's\r\ndeath, Friar Gilbert with thirteen companions made his way to England.\r\nIn the company of Peter des Roches the Dominican pioneers went to\r\nCanterbury, where Archbishop Langton was then residing. At the\r\narchbishop's request Gilbert preached in a Canterbury church, and\r\nLangton was so much delighted by his teaching that henceforth he had a\r\nspecial affection for the new order. From Canterbury the friars\r\njourneyed to London and Oxford. Mindful of the work of their leaders at\r\nParis and Bologna, they built their first English chapel, house, and\r\nschools in the university town. Soon these proved too small for them,\r\nand they had to seek ampler quarters outside the walls. From these\r\nbeginnings the Dominicans spread over England.\r\n\r\nThe Franciscans quickly followed the Dominicans. On September 10, 1224,\r\nthere landed at Dover a little band of four clerks and five laymen,\r\nsent by St. Francis himself to extend the new teaching into England. At\r\ntheir head was the Italian, Agnellus of Pisa, a deacon, formerly warden\r\nof the Parisian convent, who was appointed provincial minister in\r\nEngland. His three clerical companions were all Englishmen, though the\r\nfive laymen were Italians or Frenchmen. Like the Dominican pioneers,\r\nthe Franciscan missionaries first went to Canterbury, where the favour\r\nof Simon Langton, the archdeacon, did for them what the goodwill of his\r\nbrother Stephen had done for their precursors. Leaving some of their\r\nnumber at Canterbury, four of the Franciscans went on to London, and\r\nthence a little later two of them set out for Oxford. Alike at London\r\nand at Oxford, they found a cordial welcome from the Dominicans, eating\r\nin their refectories, and sleeping in their dormitories, until they\r\nwere able to erect modest quarters in both places. The brethren of the\r\nnew order excited unbounded enthusiasm. Necessity and choice combined\r\nto compel them to interpret their vow of poverty as St. Francis would\r\nhave wished. They laboured with their own hands at the construction of\r\ntheir humble churches. The friars at Oxford knew the pangs of debt and\r\nhunger, rejected pillows as a vain luxury, and limited the use of boots\r\nand shoes to the sick and infirm. The faithful saw the brethren singing\r\nsongs as they picked their way over the frozen mud or hard snow, blood\r\nmarking the track of their naked feet, without their being conscious of\r\nit. The joyous radiance of Francis himself illuminated the lives of his\r\nfollowers. \"The friars,\" writes their chronicler, \"were so full of fun\r\namong themselves that a deaf mute could hardly refrain from laughter at\r\nseeing them.\" With the same glad spirit they laboured for the salvation\r\nof souls, the cure of sickness, and the relief of distress. The\r\nemotional feeling of the age quickly responded to their zeal. Within a\r\nfew years other houses had arisen at Gloucester, at Nottingham, at\r\nStamford, at Worcester, at Northampton, at Cambridge, at Lincoln, at\r\nShrewsbury. In a generation there was hardly a town of importance in\r\nEngland that had not its Franciscan convent, and over against it a\r\nrival Dominican house.\r\n\r\nThe esteem felt for the followers of Francis and Dominic led to an\r\nextraordinary extension of the mendicant type. New orders of friars\r\narose, preserving the essential attribute of absolute poverty, though\r\ndiffering from each other and from the two prototypes in various\r\nparticulars. Some of these lesser orders found their way to England. In\r\nthe same year as Agnellus, there came to England the Trinitarian\r\nfriars, called also the Maturins, from the situation of their first\r\nhouse in Paris, an order whose special function was the redemption of\r\ncaptives. In 1240 returning crusaders brought back with them the first\r\nCarmelite friars, for whom safer quarters had to be found than in their\r\noriginal abodes in Syria. This society spread widely, and in 1287, to\r\nthe disgust of the older monks, it laid aside the party-coloured habit,\r\nforced upon it in derision by the infidels, and adopted the white robe,\r\nwhich gave them their popular name of White Friars. Hard upon these, in\r\n1244, came also the Crutched Friars, so called from the red cross set\r\nupon their backs or breasts; but these were never deeply rooted in\r\nEngland. The multiplication of orders of friars became an abuse, so\r\nthat, at the Council of Lyons of 1245, Innocent IV abolished all save\r\nfour. Besides Dominicans and Franciscans the pope only continued the\r\nCarmelites, and an order first seen in England a few years later, the\r\nAustin friars or the hermits of the order of St. Augustine. These made\r\nup the traditional four orders of friars of later history. Yet even the\r\ndecree of a council could not stay the growth of new mendicant types.\r\nIn 1257 the Friars of the Penance of Jesus Christ, popularly styled\r\nFriars of the Sack, from their coarse sackcloth garb, settled down in\r\nLondon, exempted by papal dispensation from the fate of suppression;\r\nand even later than this King Richard's son, Edmund of Cornwall,\r\nestablished a community of Bonhommes at Ashridge in Buckinghamshire.\r\n\r\nThe friars were not recluses, like the older orders, but active\r\npreachers and teachers of the people. The parish clergy seldom held a\r\nstrong position in medieval life. The estimation in which the monastic\r\nideal was held limited their influence. They were, as a rule, not much\r\nraised above the people among whom they laboured. If the parish priest\r\nwere a man of rank or education, he was too often a non-resident and a\r\npluralist, bestowing little personal attention on his parishioners. Nor\r\nwere the numerous parishes served by monks in much better plight. The\r\nmonastery took the tithes and somehow provided for the services; but the\r\nefforts of Grosseteste to secure the establishment of permanent\r\nstipendiary vicarages in his diocese exemplify the reluctance of the\r\nreligious to give their appropriations the benefit of permanent pastors,\r\npaid on an adequate scale. It was an exceptional thing for the parish\r\nclergymen to do more than discharge perfunctorily the routine duties of\r\ntheir office, and preaching was almost unknown among them. The friars\r\nthrew themselves into pastoral work with such devotion as to compel the\r\nreluctant admiration of their natural rivals, the monks. \"At first,\"\r\nsays Matthew Paris,[1] \"the Preachers and the Minorites lived a life of\r\npoverty and extreme sanctity. They busied themselves in preaching,\r\nhearing confessions, the recital of divine service, in teaching and\r\nstudy. They embraced voluntary poverty for God's sake, abandoning all\r\ntheir worldly goods and not even reserving for themselves their food for\r\nto-morrow.\" A special field of labour was in the crowded suburbs of the\r\nlarger towns, where so often they chose to erect their first convents.\r\nThe care of the sick and of lepers was their peculiar function. Their\r\nsympathy and charity carried everything before them, and they remained\r\nthe chief teachers of the poor down to the Reformation. They ingratiated\r\nthemselves with the rich as much as with the poor. Henry III. and Edward\r\nselected mendicants as their confessors. The strongest and holiest of\r\nthe bishops, Grosseteste, became their most active friend. Simon of\r\nMontfort sought the advice and friendship of a friar like Adam Marsh.\r\nThe mere fact that Stephen Langton and Peter des Roches were their first\r\npatrons in England shows how they appealed alike to the best and worst\r\nclerical types of the time.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Chron. Maj._, v., 194.\r\n\r\nMen and women of all ranks, while still living in the world and\r\nfulfilling their ordinary occupations, associated themselves to the\r\nmendicant brotherhoods. Besides these _tertiaries_, as they were\r\ncalled, still wider circles sought the friars' direction in all\r\nspiritual matters and showed eagerness to be buried within their\r\nsanctuaries. Nor did the friars limit themselves to pastoral care. They\r\nwon a unique place in the intellectual history of the time. They made\r\nthemselves the spokesmen of all the movements of the age. They were\r\neager to make peace, and Agnellus himself mediated between Henry III.\r\nand the earl marshal. They were the strenuous preachers of the\r\ncrusades, whether against the infidel or against Frederick II. The\r\nFranciscans taught a new and more methodical devotion to the Virgin\r\nMother. The friars upheld the highest papal claims, were constantly\r\nselected as papal agents and tax-gatherers, and yet even this did not\r\ndeprive them of their influence over Englishmen. Their zeal for truth\r\noften made them defenders of unpopular causes, and it was much to their\r\nhonour that they did not hesitate to incur the displeasure of the\r\nLondoners by their anxiety to save innocent Jews accused of the murder\r\nof Christian children. The parish clergy hated and envied them as\r\nsuccessful rivals, and bitterly resented the privilege which they\r\nreceived from Alexander IV of hearing confessions throughout the world.\r\nNot less strong was the hostility of the monastic orders which is often\r\nexpressed in Matthew Paris's free-spoken abuse of them. They were\r\naccused of terrorising dying men out of their possessions, of laxity in\r\nthe confessional, of absolving their friends too easily, of overweening\r\nambition and restless meddlesomeness. They were violent against\r\nheretics and enemies of the Church. They answered hate with hate. They\r\ndespised the seculars as drones and the monks as lazy and corrupt. The\r\ndissensions between the various orders of friars, and particularly\r\nbetween the sober and intellectual Dominicans and the radical and\r\nmystic Franciscans, were soon as bitter as those between monks and\r\nfriars, or monks and seculars. But when all allowances have been made,\r\nthe good that they wrought far outbalanced the evil, and in England at\r\nleast, the mendicant orders exhibited a nobler conception of religion,\r\nand of men's duly to their fellowmen than had as yet been set before\r\nthe people. If the main result of their influence was to strengthen\r\nthat cosmopolitan conception of Christendom of which the papacy was the\r\nhead and the friars the agents, their zeal for righteousness often led\r\nthem beyond their own rigid platform, and Englishmen honoured the\r\nwandering friar as the champion of the nation's cause.\r\n\r\nLike the religious orders, the universities were part of the world\r\nsystem and only indirectly represented the struggling national life.\r\nThe ferment of the twelfth century revival crystallised groups of\r\nmasters or doctors into guilds called universities, with a strong class\r\ntradition, rigid codes of rules, and intense corporate spirit. The\r\nschools at Oxford, whose continuous history can be traced from the days\r\nof Henry II., had acquired a considerable reputation by the time that\r\nhis grandson had ascended the throne. Oxford university, with an\r\nautonomous constitution of its own since _1214_, was presided over by a\r\nchancellor who, though in a sense the representative of the distant\r\ndiocesan at Lincoln, was even in the earliest times the head of the\r\nscholars, and no mere delegate of the bishop. Five years earlier the\r\nOxford schools were sufficiently vigorous to provoke a secession, from\r\nwhich the first faint beginnings of a university at Cambridge arose. A\r\ngeneration later there were other secessions to Salisbury and\r\nNorthampton, but neither of these schools succeeded in maintaining\r\nthemselves. Cambridge itself had a somewhat languid existence\r\nthroughout the whole of the thirteenth century, and was scarcely\r\nrecognised as a _studium generale_ until the bull of John XXII. in 1318\r\nmade its future position secure. In early days the university owed\r\nnothing to endowments, buildings, social prestige, or tradition. The\r\ntwo essentials was the living voice of the graduate teacher and the\r\nconcourse of students desirous to be taught. Hence migrations were\r\ncommon and stability only gradually established. When, late in Henry\r\nIII.'s reign, the chancellor, Walter of Merton, desired to set up a\r\npermanent institution for the encouragement of poor students, he\r\nhesitated whether to establish it at Oxford, or Cambridge, or in his\r\nown Surrey village. Oxford, though patriots coupled it with Paris and\r\nBologna, only gradually rose into repute. But before the end of Henry\r\nIII.'s reign it had won an assured place among the great universities\r\nof western Europe, though lagging far behind that of the supreme\r\nschools of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe growing fame of the university of Oxford was a matter of national\r\nimportance. Down to the early years of the thirteenth century a young\r\nEnglish clerk who was anxious to study found his only career abroad,\r\nand was too often cut off altogether from his mother country. Among the\r\nlast of this type were the Paris mathematician, John of Holywood or\r\nHalifax, Robert Curzon, cardinal, legate, theologian, and crusader, and\r\nAlexander of Hales. Stephen Langton, who did important work in revising\r\nthe text of the Vulgate, might well have been one of those lost to\r\nEngland but for the wisdom of Innocent III who restored him, in the\r\nfulness of his reputation and powers, to the service of the English\r\nChurch. Not many years younger than Langton was his successor Edmund of\r\nAbingdon, but the difference was enough to make the younger primate a\r\nstudent of the Oxford schools in early life. Though he left Oxford for\r\nParis, Edmund returned to an active career in England, when experience\r\nconvinced him of the vanity of scholastic success. Bishop Grosseteste,\r\nanother early Oxford teacher of eminence, probably studied at Paris,\r\nfor so late as 1240 he held up to the Oxford masters of theology the\r\nexample of their Paris brethren for their imitation. The double\r\nallegiance of Edmund and Grosseteste was typical. A long catalogue of\r\neminent names adorned the annals of Oxford in the thirteenth century,\r\nbut the most distinguished of her earlier sons were drawn away from her\r\nby the superior attractions of Paris. England furnished at least her\r\nshare of the great names of thirteenth century scholasticism, but of\r\nvery few of these could it be said that their main obligation was to\r\nthe English university. It was at Paris that the academic organisation\r\ndeveloped which Oxford adopted. At Paris the great intellectual\r\nconflicts of the century were fought. There the ferment seethed round\r\nthat introduction of Aristotle's teaching from Moorish sources which\r\nled to the outspoken pantheism of an Amaury of Bène. There also was the\r\nreconciliation effected between the new teacher and the old faith which\r\nmade Aristotle the pillar of the new scholasticism that was to justify\r\nby reason the ways of God to man. In Paris also was fought the contest\r\nbetween the aggressive mendicant friars and the secular doctors whom\r\nthey wished to supplant in the divinity schools.\r\n\r\nThere is little evidence of even a pale reflection of these struggles\r\nin contemporary Oxford. English scholars bore their full share in the\r\nfight. It was the Englishman Curzon who condemned the heresies of\r\nAmaury of Bène. Another Englishman, Alexander of Hales, issued in his\r\n_Summa Theologiæ_ the first effective reconciliation of Aristotelian\r\nmetaphysic with Christian doctrine which his Paris pupils, Thomas\r\nAquinas, the Italian, and Albert the Great, the German, were to work\r\nout in detail in the next generation. Hales was the first secular\r\ndoctor in Europe who in 1222, in the full pride of his powers,\r\nabandoned his position in the university to embrace the voluntary\r\npoverty of the Franciscans and resume his teaching, not in the regular\r\nschools but in a Minorite convent. And at the same time another English\r\ndoctor at Paris, John of St. Giles, notable as a physician as well as a\r\ntheologian, dramatically marked his conversion to the Dominican order\r\nby assuming its habit in the midst of a sermon on the virtues of\r\npoverty. All these famous Englishmen worked and taught at Paris, and it\r\nwas only a generation later that their successors could establish on\r\nthe Thames the traditions so long upheld on the banks of the Seine.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Dominicans and Franciscans at Oxford gave an\r\nimmense impetus to the activity of the university. The Franciscans\r\nappointed as the first _lector_ of their Oxford convent the famous\r\nsecular teacher Grosseteste, who ever after held the Minorites in the\r\nclosest estimation. Grosseteste was the greatest scholar of his day,\r\nknowing Greek and Hebrew as well as the accustomed studies of the\r\nperiod. A clear and independent thinker, he was not, like so many of\r\nhis contemporaries, overborne by the weight of authority, but appealed\r\nto observation and experience in terms which make him the precursor of\r\nRoger Bacon. Grosseteste's successor as _lector_ was himself a\r\nMinorite, Adam Marsh, whose reputation was so great that Grosseteste\r\nwas afraid to leave him when sick in a French town, lest the Paris\r\nmasters should persuade him to teach in their schools. Adam's loyalty\r\nto his native university withstood any such temptation, and from that\r\ntime Oxford began to hold up its head against Paris. Even before this,\r\nGrosseteste persuaded John of St. Giles to transfer his teaching from\r\nParis to Oxford, where he remained for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nThe intense intellectual activity of the thirteenth century flowed in\r\nmore than one channel, and Englishmen took their full share both in\r\nbuilding up and in destroying. Two Englishmen of the next generation\r\nmark in different ways the reaction against the moderate\r\nAristotelianism and orthodox rationalism which their countryman Hales\r\nfirst brought into vogue. These were the Franciscan friars, Roger Bacon\r\nand Duns Scotus. Bacon, though he studied at Paris as well as at\r\nOxford, is much more closely identified with England than with the\r\nContinent. His sceptical, practical intellect led him to heap scorn on\r\nHales and his followers and to plunge into audacities of speculation\r\nwhich cost him long seclusions in his convent and enforced abstinence\r\nfrom writing and study. In his war against the Aristotelians, the\r\nintrepid friar upheld recourse to experiment and observation as\r\nsuperior to deference to authority, in language which stands in strange\r\ncontrast to the traditions of the thirteenth century. Grosseteste, who\r\nalso had preferred the teachings of experience to the appeal to the\r\nsages of the past, was the only academic leader that escaped Bacon's\r\nscathing censure. When his order kept him silent, Roger was bidden to\r\nresume his pen by Pope Clement IV. A generation still later, Duns\r\nScotus, probably a Lowland Scot, who taught at Paris and died at\r\nCologne in 1308, emphasised, sharply enough, but in less drastic\r\nfashion, the reaction against the teaching of Hales and Aquinas, by\r\naccepting a dualism between reason and authority that broke away from\r\nthe Thomist tradition of the thirteenth century and prepared the way\r\nfor the scholastic decadence of the fourteenth. After France, England\r\ntook a leading part in all these movements; and even in France English\r\nscholars had a large share in making that land the special home of the\r\n_Studium_, as Italy was of the _Sacerdotium_ and Germany of the\r\n_Imperium_.\r\n\r\nThis intellectual ferment had its results on practical life. Though the\r\nuniversity was cosmopolitan, the individual members of it were not the\r\nless good citizens. A patriot like Grosseteste strove to his uttermost\r\nto keep Englishmen for Oxford or to win them back from Paris. Oxford\r\nclerks fought the battle of England against the legate Otto, and we\r\nshall see them siding with Montfort. The eminently practical temper of\r\nthe academic class could not neglect the world of action for the\r\nabstract pursuit of science. Eager as men were to know, to prove, and\r\nto inquire, the age had little of the mystical temperament about it.\r\nThe studies which made for worldly success, such as civil and canon\r\nlaw, attracted the thousands for whom philosophy or theology had little\r\nattraction. Never before was there a career so fully opened to talent.\r\nThe academic teacher's fame took him from the lecture-room to the\r\ncourt, from the university to the episcopal throne, and so it was that\r\nthe university influenced action almost as profoundly as it influenced\r\nthought, and affected all classes of society alike. The struggles of\r\npoor students like Edmund of Abingdon or Grosseteste must not make us\r\nthink that the universities of this period were exclusively frequented\r\nby humble scholars. The academic career of a rich baron's son like\r\nThomas of Cantilupe, living in his own hired house at Paris with a\r\ntrain of chaplains and tutors, receiving the visits of the French king,\r\nand feeding poor scholars with the remnants from his table, is as\r\ncharacteristic as the more common picture of the student begging his\r\nway from one seat of learning to another, and suffering the severest\r\nprivations rather than desert his studies. Yet the function of the\r\n_studium_ as promoting a healthy circulation between the various orders\r\nof medieval society, must not be ignored.\r\n\r\nPartly to help on the poor, partly to encourage men to devote\r\nthemselves to the pursuit of knowledge, endowments began to arise which\r\nsoon enhanced the splendour of universities though they lessened their\r\nmobility and their freedom. The mendicant convents at Paris and Oxford\r\nprepared the way for secular foundations, at first small and\r\ninsignificant, like that which, in the days of Henry III., John Balliol\r\nestablished at Oxford for the maintenance of poor scholars, but soon\r\nincreasing in magnitude and distinction. The great college set up by\r\nSt. Louis' confessor at Paris for the endowment of scholars, desirous\r\nof studying the unlucrative but vital subject of theology, was soon\r\nimitated by the chancellor of Henry III. Side by side with Robert of\r\nSorbon's college of 1257, arose Walter of Merton's foundation of 1263,\r\nand twenty years later Bishop Balsham's college of Peterhouse extended\r\nthe \"rule of Merton\" to Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThe academic movement was not all clear gain. The humanism, of the\r\ntwelfth century was crushed beneath the weight of the specialised\r\nscience and encyclopædic learning of the thirteenth. We should seek in\r\nvain among most theologians or the philosophers of our period for any\r\nspark of literary art; and the tendency dominant in them affected for\r\nevil all works written in Latin. Even the historians show a falling\r\naway from the example of William of Malmesbury or of Roger of Hoveden.\r\nThe one English chronicler of the thirteenth century who is a\r\nconsiderable man of letters, Matthew Paris, belongs to the early half\r\nof it, before the academic tradition was fully established, and even\r\nwith him prolixity impairs the art without injuring the colour of his\r\nwork. The age of Edward I., the great time of triumphant scholasticism,\r\nis recorded in chronicles so dreary that it is hard to make the dry\r\nbones live. Walter of Hemingburgh, the most attractive historian of the\r\ntime, belongs to the next generation: and his excellencies are only\r\ngreat in comparison with his fellows. Something of this decadence may\r\nbe attributed to the falling away of the elder monastic types, whose\r\nhigher life withered up from want of able recruits, for the secular and\r\nmendicant careers offered opportunities so stimulating that few men of\r\npurpose, or earnest spiritual character, cared to enter a Benedictine\r\nor a Cistercian house of religion. Something more may be assigned to\r\nthe growing claims of the vulgar tongue on literary aspirants. But the\r\nchief cause of the literary defects of thirteenth century writers must\r\nbe set down to the doctrine that the study of \"arts\"--of grammar,\r\nrhetoric and the rest--was only worthy of schoolboys and novices, and\r\nwas only a preliminary to the specialised faculties which left little\r\nroom for artistic presentation. Science in short nearly killed\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nIt was the same with the vulgar tongues as with Latin. French remained\r\nthe common language of the higher classes of English society, and the\r\nhistory of French literature belongs to the history of the western\r\nworld rather than to that of England. The share taken in it by\r\nEnglish-born writers is less important than in the great age of romance\r\nwhen the contact of Celt and Norman on British soil added the Arthurian\r\nlegend to the world's stock of poetic material. The practical motive,\r\nwhich destroyed the art of so many Latin writers, impaired the literary\r\nvalue of much written in the vernacular. We have technical works in\r\nFrench and even in English, such as Walter of Henley's treatise on\r\n_Husbandry_, composed in French for the guidance of stewards of manors,\r\nand translated, it is said by Grosseteste, into English for the benefit\r\nof a wider public. Grosseteste is also said to have drawn up in French\r\na handbook of rules for the management of a great estate, and he\r\ncertainly wrote French poetry. The legal literature, written in Latin\r\nor French, and illustrated by such names as Bracton, Britton, and\r\n\"Fleta,\" shows that there was growing up a school of earnest students\r\nof English law who, though anxious, like Bracton, to bring their\r\nconclusions under the rules of Roman jurisprudence, began to treat\r\ntheir science with an independence which secured for English custom the\r\nopportunity of independent development. Of more literary interest than\r\nsuch technicalities were the rhyming chronicles, handed on from the\r\nprevious age, of which one of the best, the recently discovered history\r\nof the great William Marshal, has already been noticed. The spontaneity\r\nof this poem proves that its language was still the natural speech of\r\nthe writer, and impels its French editor to claim for it a French\r\norigin. As the century grew older there was no difficulty in deciding\r\nwhether French works were written by Englishmen or Frenchmen. The\r\nYorkshire French of Peter Langtoft's _Chronicle_, and the jargon of the\r\n_Year Books_, attest how the political separation of the two lands, and\r\nthe preponderance in northern France of the dialect of Paris, placed\r\nthe insular French speech in strong contrast to the language of polite\r\nsociety beyond the Channel. Yet barbarous as Anglo-French became, it\r\nretained the freshness of a living tongue, and gained some ground at\r\nthe expense of Latin, notably in the law courts and in official\r\ndocuments.\r\n\r\nEnglish was slowly making its way upwards. There was a public ready to\r\nread vernacular books, and not at home with French. For their sake a\r\ngreat literature of translations and adaptations was made, beginning\r\nwith Layamon's English version of Wace's _Brut_, which by the end of\r\nthe century made the cycle of French romance accessible to the English\r\nreader. Many works of edification and devotion were written in English;\r\nand Robert of Gloucester's rhyming history appealed to a larger public\r\nthan the Yorkshire French of Langtoft. It is significant of the trend\r\nof events that the early fourteenth century saw Langtoft himself done\r\ninto English by Robert Mannyng, of Bourne. While as yet no continuous\r\nworks of high merit were written in English, there was no lack of\r\nexperiments, of novelties, and of adaptations. Much evidence of depth\r\nof feeling, power of expression, and careful art lies hidden away in\r\nhalf-forgotten anonymous lyrics, satires, and romances. The language in\r\nwhich these works were written was steadily becoming more like our\r\nmodern English. The dialectical differences become less acute; the\r\ninflections begin to drop away; the vocabulary gradually absorbs a\r\nlarger romance element, and the prosody drops from the forms of the\r\nWest Saxon period into measures and modes that reflect a living\r\nconnexion with the contemporary poetry of France. Thus, even in the\r\nliterature of a not too literary age, we find abundant tokens of that\r\nstrenuous national life which was manifesting itself in so many\r\ndifferent ways.\r\n\r\nArt rather than literature reflected the deeper currents of the\r\nthirteenth century. Architecture, the great art of the middle age, was\r\nin its perfection. The inchoate gothic which the Cistercians brought\r\nfrom Burgundy to the Yorkshire dales, and William of Sens transplanted\r\nfrom his birthplace to Canterbury, was superseded by the more developed\r\nart of St. Hugh's choir at Lincoln. In the next generation the new\r\nstyle, imported from northern France, struck out ways of its own, less\r\nsoaring, less rigidly logical, yet of unequalled grace and\r\npicturesqueness, such as we see in Salisbury cathedral, which\r\naltogether dates from the reign of Henry III. Here also, as in\r\nliterature, foreign models stood side by side with native products.\r\nHenry III.'s favourite foundation at Westminster reproduced on English\r\nsoil the towering loftiness, the vaulted roofs, the short choir, and\r\nthe ring of apsidal chapels, of the great French minsters. This was\r\neven more emphatically the case with the decorations, the goldsmith's\r\nand metal work, the sculpture, painting, and glass, which the best\r\nartists of France set up in honour of the English king's favourite\r\nsaint. In these crafts English work would not as yet bear a comparison\r\nwith foreign, and even the glories of the statuary of the façade of\r\nWells cannot approach the sculptured porches of Amiens or Paris. As the\r\ncentury advanced some of the fashions of the French builders, notably\r\nas regards window tracery, were taken up in the early \"Decorated\" of\r\nthe reign of Edward I.; and here the claims of English to essential\r\nequality with French building can perhaps be better substantiated than\r\nin the infancy of the art. But all these comparisons are misleading.\r\nThe impulse to gothic art came to England from France, like the impulse\r\nto many other things. Its working out was conducted on English local\r\nlines, ever becoming more divergent from those of the prototype, though\r\nnot seldom stimulated by the constant intercourse of the two lands.\r\n\r\nThe new gothic art enriched the medieval town with a splendour of\r\nbuildings hitherto unknown, which symbolised the growth of material\r\nprosperity as well as of a keener artistic appreciation. In the greater\r\ntowns the four orders of friars erected their large and plain churches,\r\ndesigned as halls for preaching to great congregations. The development\r\nof domestic architecture is even more significant than the growth of\r\necclesiastical and military buildings. Stone houses were no longer the\r\nrare luxuries of Jews or nobles. Never were the towns more prosperous\r\nand more energetic. They were now winning for themselves both economic\r\nand administrative independence. Magnates, such as Randolph of Chester,\r\nfollowed the king's example by granting charters to the smaller towns.\r\nEven the lesser boroughs became not merely the abodes of agriculturists\r\nbut the homes of organised trading communities. It was the time when\r\nthe merchant class first began to manifest itself in politics, and the\r\npower of capital to make itself felt. Capital was almost monopolised by\r\nJews, Lombards, or Tuscans, and the fierce English hatred of the\r\nforeigner found a fresh expression in the persecution of the Hebrew\r\nmoney-lenders and in the increasing dislike felt for the alien bankers\r\nand merchants who throve at Englishmen's expense. The fact that so much\r\nof English trade with the continent was still in the hands of Germans,\r\nFrenchmen, and Italians made this feeling the more intense. But there\r\nwere limits even to the ill-will towards aliens. The foreigner could\r\nmake himself at home in England, and the rapid naturalisation of a\r\nMontfort in the higher walks of life is paralleled by the absorption\r\ninto the civic community of many a Gascon or German merchant, like that\r\nArnold Fitz Thedmar,[1] a Bremen trader's son, who became alderman\r\nof London and probably chronicler of its history. Yet even the greatest\r\nEnglish towns did not become strong enough to cut themselves off from\r\nthe general life of the people. They were rather a new element in that\r\nrich and purposeful nation that had so long been enduring the rule of\r\nHenry of Winchester. The national energy spurned the feebleness of the\r\ncourt, and the time was at hand when the nation, through its natural\r\nleaders, was to overthrow the wretched system of misgovernment under\r\nwhich it had suffered. Political retrogression was no longer to bar\r\nnational progress.\r\n\r\n    [1] See for Arnold the _Chronica majorum et vicecomitum\r\n    Londoniarum_ in _Liber de antiquis legibus_, and Riley's\r\n    introduction to his translation of _Chronicles of the Mayors\r\n    and Sheriffs of London_ (1863).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE BARONS' WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the early months of 1258, the aliens ruled the king and realm,\r\nadded estate to estate, and defied all attempts to dislodge them. Papal\r\nagents traversed the country, extorting money from prelates and\r\nchurches. The Welsh, in secret relations with the lords of the march,\r\nthreatened the borders, and made a confederacy with the Scots. The\r\nFrench were hostile, and the barons disunited, without leaders, and\r\nhelpless. A wretched harvest made corn scarce and dear. A wild winter,\r\nfollowed by a long late frost, cut off the lambs and destroyed the\r\nfarmers' hopes for the summer. A murrain of cattle followed, and the\r\npoor were dying of hunger and pestilence. Henry III. was in almost as\r\nbad a plight as his people. He had utterly failed to subdue Llewelyn. A\r\npapal agent threatened him with excommunication and the resumption of\r\nthe grant of Sicily. He could not control his foreign kinsfolk, and the\r\nrivalry of Savoyards and Poitevins added a new element of turmoil to\r\nthe distracted relations of the magnates. His son had been forced to\r\npawn his best estates to William of Valence, and the royal exchequer\r\nwas absolutely empty. Money must be had at all risks, and the only way\r\nto get it was to assemble the magnates.\r\n\r\nOn April 2 the chief men of Church and State gathered together at\r\nLondon. For more than a month the stormy debates went on. The king's\r\ndemands were contemptuously waved aside. His exceptional misdeeds, it\r\nwas declared, were to be met by exceptional measures. Hot words were\r\nspoken, and William of Valence called Leicester a traitor. \"No, no,\r\nWilliam,\" the earl replied, \"I am not a traitor, nor the son of a\r\ntraitor; your father and mine were men of a different stamp,\" An\r\nopposition party formed itself under the Earls of Gloucester,\r\nLeicester, Hereford, and Norfolk. Even the Savoyards partially fell\r\naway from the court, and a convocation of clergy at Merton, presided\r\nover by Archbishop Boniface, drew up canons in the spirit of\r\nGrosseteste. In parliament all that Henry could get was a promise to\r\nadjourn the question of supply until a commission had drafted a\r\nprogramme of reform. On May 2 Henry and his son Edward announced their\r\nacceptance of this proposal; parliament was forthwith prorogued, and\r\nthe barons set to work to mature their scheme.\r\n\r\nOn June 11 the magnates once more assembled, this time at Oxford. A\r\nsummons to fight the Welsh gave them an excuse to appear attended with\r\ntheir followers in arms. The royalist partisans nicknamed the gathering\r\nthe Mad Parliament, but its proceedings were singularly business-like.\r\nA petition of twenty-nine articles was presented, in which the abuses\r\nof the administration were laid bare in detail. A commission of\r\ntwenty-four was appointed who were to redress the grievances of the\r\nnation, and to draw up a new scheme of government. According to the\r\ncompact Henry himself selected half this body. It was significant of\r\nthe falling away of the mass of the ruling families from the monarchy,\r\nthat six of Henry's twelve commissioners were churchmen, four were\r\naliens, three were his brothers, one his brother-in-law, one his\r\nnephew, one his wife's uncle. The only earls that accepted his\r\nnomination were the Poitevin adventurer, John du Plessis, Earl of\r\nWarwick, and John of Warenne, who was pledged to a royalist policy by\r\nhis marriage to Henry's half-sister, Alice of Lusignan. The only\r\nbishops were, the queen's uncle, Boniface of Canterbury, and Fulk\r\nBasset of London, the richest and noblest born of English prelates,\r\nwho, though well meaning, was too weak in character for continued\r\nopposition. Yet these two were the most independent names on Henry's\r\nlist. The rest included the three Lusignan brothers, Guy, William, and\r\nAymer, still eight years after his election only elect of Winchester;\r\nHenry of Almaine, the young son of the King of the Romans; the\r\npluralist official John Mansel; the chancellor, Henry Wingham; the\r\nDominican friar John of Darlington, distinguished as a biblical critic,\r\nthe king's confessor and the pope's agent; and the Abbot of\r\nWestminster, an old man pledged by long years of dependence to do the\r\nwill of the second founder of his house. In strong contrast to these\r\ncreatures of court favour were the twelve nominees of the barons. The\r\nonly ecclesiastic was Walter of Cantilupe, Bishop of Worcester, and the\r\nonly alien was Earl Simon of Leicester. With him were three other\r\nearls, Richard of Clare, Earl of Gloucester, Roger Bigod, earl marshal\r\nand Earl of Norfolk, and Humphrey Bohun, Earl of Hereford. Those of\r\nbaronial rank were Roger Mortimer, the strongest of the marchers, Hugh\r\nBigod, the brother of the earl marshal, John FitzGeoffrey, Richard\r\nGrey, William Bardolf, Peter Montfort, and Hugh Despenser.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-four drew up a plan of reform which left little to be\r\ndesired in thoroughness. The Provisions of Oxford, as the new\r\nconstitution was styled, were speedily laid before the barons and\r\nadopted. By it a standing council of fifteen was established, with\r\nwhose advice and consent Henry was henceforth to exercise all his\r\nauthority. Even this council was not to be without supervision. Thrice\r\nin the year another committee of twelve was to treat with the fifteen\r\non the common affairs of the realm. This rather narrow body was\r\ncreated, we are told, to save the expense involved in too frequent\r\nmeetings of the magnates. A third aristocratic junto of twenty-four was\r\nappointed to make grants of money to the crown. All aliens were to be\r\nexpelled from office and from the custody of royal castles. New\r\nministers, castellans, and escheators were appointed under stringent\r\nconditions and under the safeguard of new oaths. The original\r\ntwenty-four were not yet discharged from office. They had still to draw\r\nup schemes for the reform of the household of king and queen, and for\r\nthe amendment of the exchange of London. Moreover, \"Be it remembered,\"\r\nran one of the articles, \"that the estate of Holy Church be amended by\r\nthe twenty-four elected to reform the realm, when they shall find time\r\nand place\".\r\n\r\nFor the first time in our history the king was forced to stand aside\r\nfrom the discharge of his undoubted functions, and suffer them to be\r\nexercised by a committee of magnates. The conception of limited\r\nmonarchy, which had been foreshadowed in the early struggles of Henry's\r\nlong reign, was triumphantly vindicated, and, after weary years of\r\nwaiting, the baronial victors demanded more than had ever been\r\nsuggested by the most free interpretation of the Great Charter. The\r\nbody that controlled the crown was, it is true, a narrow one. But\r\nwhatever was lost by its limitation, was more than gained by the\r\nabsolute freedom of the whole movement from any suspicion of the\r\nseparatist tendencies of the earlier feudalism. The barons tacitly\r\naccepted the principle that England was a unity, and that it must be\r\nruled as a single whole. The triumph of the national movement of the\r\nthirteenth century was assured when the most feudal class of the\r\ncommunity thus frankly abandoned the ancient baronial contention that\r\neach baron should rule in isolation over his own estates, a tradition\r\nwhich, when carried out for a brief period under Stephen, had set up\r\n\"as many kings or rather tyrants as lords of castles\". The feudal\r\nperiod was over: the national idea was triumphant. This victory becomes\r\nspecially significant when we remember how large a share the barons of\r\nthe Welsh march, the only purely feudal region in the country, took in\r\nthe movement against the King.\r\n\r\nThe unity of the national government being recognised, it was another\r\nsign of the times that its control should be transferred from the\r\nmonarch to a committee of barons. At this point the rigid conceptions\r\nof the triumphant oligarchy stood in the way of a wide national policy.\r\nSince the reign of John the custom had arisen of consulting the\r\nrepresentatives of the shire-courts on matters of politics and finance.\r\nIn 1258 there is not the least trace of a suggestion that parliament\r\ncould ever include a more popular element than the barons and prelates.\r\nOn the contrary, the Provisions diminished the need even for those\r\nperiodical assemblies of the magnates which had been in existence since\r\nthe earliest dawn of our history. For all practical purposes small\r\nbaronial committees were to perform the work of magnates and people as\r\nwell as of the crown. Yet it must be recognised that the barons showed\r\nself-control, as well as practical wisdom, in handing over functions\r\ndischarged by the baronage as a whole to the various committees of\r\ntheir selection. The danger of general control by the magnates was that\r\na large assembly, more skilled in opposition than in constructive work,\r\nwas almost sure to become infected by faction. By strictly limiting and\r\ndefining who the new rulers of England were to be, the barons\r\napproached a combination of aristocratic control with the stability and\r\ncontinuity resulting from limited numbers and defined functions. It is\r\nlikely, however, that in bestowing such extensive powers on their\r\nnominees, they were influenced by the well-grounded belief that the new\r\nconstitution could only be established by main force, and that, even\r\nwhen abandoned by the king, the aliens would make a good fight before\r\nthey gave up all that they had so long held in England. The success of\r\nthe new scheme largely depended upon the immediate execution of the\r\nordinance for the expulsion of the foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe first step taken to carry out the Provisions was the appointment of\r\nthe new ministers. The barons insisted on the revival of the office of\r\njusticiar, and a strenuous and capable chief minister was found in Hugh\r\nBigod. It was advisable to go cautiously, and some of the king's\r\nministers were allowed to continue in office. An appeal to force was\r\nnecessary before the new constitution could be set up in detail. The\r\nSavoyards bought their safety by accepting it; but the Poitevins,\r\nseeing that flight or resistance were the only alternatives before\r\nthem, were spirited enough to prefer the bolder course. They were\r\nspecially dangerous because Edward and his cousin, Henry of Almaine,\r\nthe son of the King of the Romans, were much under their influence. In\r\nthe Dominican convent at Oxford the baronial leaders formed a sworn\r\nconfederacy not to desist from their purpose until the foreigners had\r\nbeen expelled. There were more hot words between Leicester and William,\r\nthe most capable of the Lusignans. The Poitevins soon found that they\r\ncould not maintain themselves in the face of the general hatred. On\r\nJune 22 they fled from Oxford in the company of their ally, Earl\r\nWarenne. They rode straight for the coast, but failing to reach it,\r\noccupied Winchester, where they sought to maintain themselves in\r\nAymer's castle of Wolvesey. The magnates of the parliament then turned\r\nagainst them the arms they professed to have prepared against the\r\nWelsh. Headed by the new justiciar, Hugh Bigod, they besieged Wolvesey.\r\nWarenne abandoned the aliens, and they gladly accepted the terms\r\noffered to them by their foes. They were allowed to retain their lands\r\nand some of their ready money, on condition of withdrawing from the\r\nrealm and surrendering their castles. By the middle of July they had\r\ncrossed over to France. With them disappeared the whole of the\r\norganised opposition to the new government. Edward, deprived of their\r\nsupport, swore to observe the Provisions.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the flight of the Lusignans the council of Fifteen was\r\nchosen after a fashion which seemed to give the king's friends an equal\r\nvoice with the champions of the aristocracy. Four electors appointed\r\nit, and of these two were the nominees of the baronial section, and two\r\nof the royalist section of the original twenty-four. The result of\r\ntheir work showed that there was only one party left after the Wolvesey\r\nfiasco. While only three of the king's twelve had places on the\r\npermanent council, no less that nine of the fifteen were chosen from\r\nthe baronial twelve. It was useless for Archbishop Boniface, John\r\nMansel, and the Earl of Warwick to stand up against the Bishop of\r\nWorcester, the Earls of Leicester, Norfolk, Hereford, and Gloucester,\r\nagainst John FitzGeoffrey, Peter Montfort, Richard Grey, and Roger\r\nMortimer. Moreover, of the three, John Mansel alone could still be\r\nregarded as a royalist partisan. There were three of the fifteen chosen\r\nfrom outside the twenty-four. Of these, Peter of Savoy, Earl of\r\nRichmond, might, like his brother Boniface, be regarded as an alien,\r\nthough hatred of the Poitevins had by this time made Englishmen of the\r\nSavoyards. The other two, the marcher-lord James of Audley and William\r\nof Fors, Earl of Albemarle, were of baronial sympathies. It was the\r\nsame with the other councils.\r\n\r\nInquiry was made as to abuses. Gradually the royal officials were\r\nreplaced by men of popular leanings. The sheriffs were changed and were\r\nstrictly controlled, and four knights from each shire assembled in\r\nOctober to present to the king the grievances of the people against the\r\nout-going sheriffs. The custody of the castles was put into trusty and,\r\nfor the most part, into English hands. Finally the king was forced to\r\nissue a proclamation, in which he commanded all true men \"steadfastly\r\nto hold and to defend the statutes that be made or are to be made by\r\nour counsellors\". This document was issued in English as well as in\r\nFrench and Latin. A copy of the English version was sent to every\r\nsheriff, with instructions to read it several times a year in the\r\ncounty court, so that a knowledge of its contents might be attained by\r\nevery man. It is perhaps the first important proclamation issued in\r\nEnglish since the coming of the Normans. Early in 1259 Richard, King of\r\nthe Romans, set out to revisit England. He was met at Saint Omer by a\r\ndeputation of magnates, who told him that he could only be allowed to\r\nland after taking an oath to observe the Provisions. Richard blustered,\r\nbut soon gave in his submission. His adhesion to the reforms marks the\r\nlast step in the revolution.\r\n\r\nThe new constitution worked without interruption until the end of 1259.\r\nThroughout that period domestic affairs were uneventful, and the\r\nefforts of the ministry were chiefly concerned in securing peace\r\nabroad. In 1258 Wales had been in revolt, Scotland unfriendly, and\r\nFrance threatening. A truce, ill observed, was made with Llewelyn, who\r\nfound it worth while to be cautious, seeing that his natural enemies,\r\nbut sometime associates, the marchers, had a preponderant share in the\r\ngovernment. The Scots were easier to satisfy, for there was at the time\r\nno real hostility between either kings or peoples. The chief event of\r\nthis period is the conclusion of the first peace with France since the\r\nwars of John and Philip Augustus. The protracted negotiations which\r\npreceded it took the king and his chief councillors abroad, and that\r\nmade it easier to carry on the new domestic system without friction.\r\n\r\nSince the friendly personal intercourse held between Henry and Louis\r\nIX. in 1254, the relations between England and France had become less\r\ncordial. The revival of the English power in Gascony, the\r\nAnglo-Castilian alliance, and the election of Richard of Cornwall to\r\nthe German kingship irritated the French, to whom the persistent\r\nEnglish claim to Normandy and Anjou, and the repudiation of the\r\nAquitanian homage, were perpetual sources of annoyance. The French\r\nchampionship of Alfonso against Richard achieved the double end of\r\nchecking English pretensions, and cooling the friendship between\r\nEngland and Castile. St. Louis, however, was always ready to treat for\r\npeace, while the revolution of 1258 made all parties in England anxious\r\nto put a speedy end to the unsettled relations between the two realms.\r\nNegotiations were begun as early as 1257, and made some progress; but\r\nthe decisive step was taken immediately after the prorogation of the\r\nreforming parliament in the spring of 1258. During May a strangely\r\nconstituted embassy treated for peace at Paris, where Montfort and Hugh\r\nBigod worked side by side with two of the Lusignans and Peter of Savoy.\r\nThey concluded a provisional treaty in time for the negotiators to take\r\ntheir part in the Mad Parliament. The unsettled state of affairs in\r\nEngland, however, delayed the ratification of the treaty. Arrangements\r\nhad been made for its publication at Cambrai, but the fifteen dared not\r\nallow Henry to escape from their tutelage, and Louis refused to treat\r\nsave with the king himself. There were difficulties as to the relation\r\nof the pope and the King of the Romans to the treaty, while Earl\r\nSimon's wife Eleanor and her children refused to waive their very\r\nremote claims to a share in the Norman and Angevin inheritances, which\r\nher brother was prepared to renounce. As ever, Montfort held to his\r\npersonal rights with the utmost tenacity, and the self-seeking\r\nobstinacy of the chief negotiator of the treaty caused both bad blood\r\nand delay. At last he was bought off by the promise of a money payment,\r\nand the preliminary ratifications were exchanged in the summer of 1259.\r\nOn November 14 Henry left England for Paris for the formal conclusion\r\nof the treaty. There were great festivities on the occasion of the\r\nmeeting of the two kings, but once more Montfort and his wife blocked\r\nthe way. Not until the very morning of the day fixed for the final\r\nceremony were they satisfied by Henry's promise to deposit on their\r\nbehalf a large sum in the hands of the French. Immediately afterwards\r\nHenry did homage to Louis for Gascony.\r\n\r\nThe chief condition of the treaty of Paris was Henry's definitive\r\nrenunciation of all his claims on Normandy, Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and\r\nPoitou, and his agreement to hold Gascony as a fief of the French\r\ncrown. In return for this, Louis not only recognised him as Duke of\r\nAquitaine, but added to his actual possessions there by ceding to him\r\nall that he held, whether in fief or in demesne, in the three dioceses\r\nof Limoges, Cahors, and Périgueux. Besides these immediate cessions,\r\nthe French king promised to hand over to Henry certain districts then\r\nheld by his brother, Alfonse of Poitiers, and his brother's wife Joan\r\nof Toulouse, in the event of their dominions escheating to the crown by\r\ntheir death without heirs. These regions included Agen and the Agenais,\r\nSaintonge to the south of the Charente, and in addition the whole of\r\nQuercy, if it could be proved by inquest that it had been given by\r\nRichard I. to his sister Joan, grandmother of Joan of Poitiers, as her\r\nmarriage portion. Moreover the French king promised to pay to Henry the\r\nsums necessary to maintain for two years five hundred knights to be\r\nemployed \"for the service of God, or the Church, or the kingdom of\r\nEngland.\"[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] For the treaty and its execution see M. Gavrilovitch,\r\n    _Étude sur le traité de Paris de 1259_ (1899).\r\n\r\nThe treaty was unpopular both in France and England. The French\r\nstrongly objected to the surrender of territory, and were but little\r\nconvinced of the advantage gained by making the English king once more\r\nthe vassal of France. English opinion was hostile to the abandonment of\r\nlarge pretensions in return for so small an equivalent. On the French\r\nside it is true that Louis sacrificed something to his sense of justice\r\nand love of peace. But the territory he ceded was less in reality than\r\nin appearance. The French king's demesnes in Quercy, Périgord, and\r\nLimousin were not large, and the transference of the homage of the\r\nchief vassals meant only a nominal change of overlordship, and was\r\nfurther limited by a provision that certain \"privileged fiefs\" were\r\nstill to be retained under the direct suzerainty of the French crown.\r\nAs to the eventual cessions, Alfonse and his wife were still alive and\r\nlikely to live many years. Even the cession of Gascony was hampered by\r\na stipulation that the towns should take an \"oath of security,\" by\r\nwhich they pledged themselves to aid France against England in the\r\nevent of the English king breaking the provisions of the treaty.\r\nPerhaps the most solid advantage Henry gained by the treaty was\r\nfinancial, for he spent the sums granted to enable him to redeem his\r\ncrusading vow in preparing for war against his own subjects. It was,\r\nhowever, an immense advantage for England to be able during the\r\ncritical years which followed to be free from French hostility. If,\r\ntherefore, the French complaints against the treaty were exaggerated,\r\nthe English dissatisfaction was unreasonable. The real difficulty for\r\nthe future lay in the fact that the possession of Gascony by the king\r\nof a hostile nation was incompatible with the proper development of the\r\nFrench monarchy. For fifty years, however, a chronic state of war had\r\nnot given Gascony to the French; and Louis IX. was, perhaps, politic as\r\nwell as scrupulous in abandoning the way of force and beginning a new\r\nmethod of gradual absorption, that in the end gained the Gascon fief\r\nfor France more effectively than any conquest. The treaty of Paris was\r\nnot a final settlement. It left a score of questions still open, and\r\nthe problems of its gradual execution involved the two courts in\r\nconstant disputes down to the beginning of the Hundred Years' War. For\r\nseventy years the whole history of the relations between the two\r\nnations is but a commentary on the treaty of Paris.\r\n\r\nDuring his visit to Paris Henry arranged a marriage between his\r\ndaughter Beatrice and John of Brittany, the son of the reigning duke.\r\nIn no hurry to get back to the tutelage of the fifteen, he prolonged\r\nhis stay on the continent till the end of April, 1260. Yet, abroad as\r\nat home, he could not be said to act as a free man. It was not the king\r\nso much as Simon of Montfort who was the real author of the French\r\ntreaty. Indeed, it is from the conclusion of the Peace of Paris that\r\nSimon's preponderance becomes evident. He was at all stages the chief\r\nnegotiator of the peace and, save when his personal interests stood in\r\nthe way, he controlled every step of the proceedings. If in 1258 he was\r\nbut one of several leaders of the baronial party in England, he came\r\nback from France in 1260 assured of supremacy. During his absence\r\nabroad, events had taken place in England which called for his\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nAfter their triumph in 1258, the baronial leaders relaxed their efforts.\r\nContented with their position as arbiters of the national destinies,\r\nthey made little effort to carry out the reforms contemplated at Oxford.\r\nThe ranks of the victors were broken up by private dissensions. Before\r\nleaving for France, Earl Simon violently quarrelled with Richard, Earl\r\nof Gloucester. It was currently believed that Gloucester had grown\r\nslack, and Simon rose in popular estimation as a thorough-going reformer\r\nwho had no mind to substitute the rule of a baronial oligarchy for the\r\ntyranny of the king. His position was strengthened by his personal\r\nqualities which made him the hero of the younger generation; and his\r\ninfluence began to modify the policy of Edward the king's son, who,\r\nsince the flight of his Poitevin kinsmen, was gradually arriving at\r\nbroader views of national policy. Even before his father's journey to\r\nFrance, Edward took up a line of his own. In the October parliament of\r\n1259, he listened to a petition presented to the council by the younger\r\nnobles[1] who complained that, though the king had performed all his\r\npromises, the barons had not fulfilled any of theirs. Edward thereupon\r\nstirred up the oligarchy to issue an instalment of the promised reforms\r\nin the document known as the Provisions of Westminster. During Henry's\r\nabsence in France the situation became strained. The oligarchic party,\r\nheaded by Gloucester, was breaking away from Montfort; and Edward was\r\nforming a liberal royalist party which was not far removed from\r\nMontfort's principles. Profiting by these discords, the Lusignans\r\nprepared to invade England. The papacy was about to declare against the\r\nreformers. When the monks of Winchester elected an Englishman as their\r\nbishop in the hope of getting rid of the queen's uncle, Alexander IV.\r\nsummoned Aymer to his court and consecrated him bishop with his own\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n    [1] \"Communitas bacheleriae Angliae,\" _Burton Ann_., p. 471.\r\n    _See on_ this, _Engl. Hist. Review_, xvii. (1902), 89-94.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1260, Montfort went back to England and made common cause with\r\nEdward. Despite the king's order that no parliament should be held\r\nduring his absence abroad, Montfort insisted that the Easter parliament\r\nshould meet as usual at London. The discussions were hot. Montfort\r\ndemanded the expulsion of Peter of Savoy from the council, and Edward\r\nand Gloucester almost came to blows. The Londoners closed their gates on\r\nboth parties, but the mediation of the King of the Romans prevented a\r\ncollision. Henry hurried home, convinced that Edward was conspiring\r\nagainst him. The king threw himself into the city of London, and with\r\nGloucester's help collected an army. Meanwhile Montfort and Edward, with\r\ntheir armed followers, were lodged at Clerkenwell, ready for war. Again\r\nthe situation became extremely critical, and again King Richard proved\r\nthe best peacemaker. Henry held out against his son for a fortnight, but\r\nsuch estrangement was hard for him to endure. \"Do not let my son appear\r\nbefore me,\" he cried, \"for if I see him, I shall not be able to refrain\r\nfrom kissing him.\" A reconciliation was speedily effected, and nothing\r\nremained of the short-lived alliance of Edward with Montfort save that\r\nhis feud with Gloucester continued until the earl's death.\r\n\r\nThe dissensions among the barons encouraged Henry to shake off the\r\ntutelage of the fifteen. As soon as he was reconciled with his son, he\r\ncharged Leicester with treason.[1] \"But, thanks _be_ to God, the earl\r\nanswered to all these points with such force that the king could do\r\nnothing against him.\" Unable to break down his enemy by direct attack,\r\nHenry followed one of the worst precedents of his father's reign by\r\nbeseeching Alexander IV. to relieve him of his oath to observe the\r\nProvisions. On April 13, 1261, a bull was issued annulling the whole of\r\nthe legislation of 1258 and 1259, and freeing the king from his sworn\r\npromise.\r\n\r\n    [1] Bémont, _Simon de Montfort_, Appendix xxxvii., pp. 343-53.\r\n\r\nWilliam of Valence was already back in England, and restored to his old\r\ndignities. His return was the easier because his brother, Aymer, the\r\nmost hated of the Poitevins, had died soon after his consecration to\r\nWinchester. On June 14, 1261, the papal bull was read before the\r\nassembled parliament at Winchester. There Henry removed the baronial\r\nministers and replaced them by his own friends. Chief among the\r\nsufferers was Hugh Despenser, who had succeeded Hugh Bigod as\r\njusticiar; and Bigod himself was expelled from the custody of Dover\r\nCastle. In the summer Henry issued a proclamation, declaring that the\r\nright of choosing his council and garrisoning his castles was among the\r\ninalienable attributes of the crown. England was little inclined to\r\nrebel, for the return of prosperity and good harvests made men more\r\ncontented.\r\n\r\nThe repudiation of the Provisions restored unity to the baronage. The\r\ndefections had been serious, and it was said that only five of the\r\ntwenty-four still adhered to the opposition. But the crisis forced\r\nLeicester and Gloucester to forget their recent feuds, and co-operate\r\nonce more against the king. They saw that their salvation from Henry's\r\ngrowing strength lay in appealing to a wider public than that which\r\nthey had hitherto addressed. Still posing as the heads of the\r\ngovernment established by the Provisions, they summoned three knights\r\nfrom each shire to attend an assembly at St. Alban's. This appeal to\r\nthe landed gentry alarmed the king so much that he issued counter-writs\r\nto the sheriffs ordering them to send the knights, not to the baronial\r\ncamp at St. Alban's, but to his own court at Windsor. Neither party was\r\nas yet prepared for battle. The death of Alexander IV, soon after the\r\npublication of his bull tied the hands of the king. At the same time\r\nthe renewed dissensions of Leicester and Gloucester paralysed the\r\nbaronage. Before long Simon withdrew to the continent, leaving\r\neverything in Gloucester's hands. At last, on December 7, a treaty of\r\npacification was patched up, and the king announced that he was ready\r\nto pardon those who accepted its conditions. But there was no\r\npermanence in the settlement, and the king, the chief gainer by it, was\r\nsoon pressing the new pope, Urban IV., to confirm the bull of\r\nAlexander. On February 25, 1262, Urban renewed Henry's absolution from\r\nhis oath in a bull which was at once promulgated in England. Montfort\r\nthen came back from abroad and rallied the baronial party. In January,\r\n1263, Henry once more confirmed the Provisions, and peace seemed\r\nrestored. The death of Richard of Gloucester during 1262 increased\r\nMontfort's power. His son, the young Earl Gilbert, was Simon's devoted\r\ndisciple, but he was still a minor and the custody of his lands was\r\nhanded over to the Earl of Hereford. Montfort's personal charm\r\nsucceeded in like fashion in winning over Henry of Almaine.\r\n\r\nThe events of 1263 are as bewildering and as indecisive as those of the\r\ntwo previous years. Amidst the confusion of details and the violent\r\nclashing of personal and territorial interests, a few main principles\r\ncan be discerned. First of all the royalist party was becoming\r\ndecidedly stronger, and fresh secessions of the barons constantly\r\nstrengthened its ranks. Conspicuous among these were the lords of the\r\nmarch of Wales, who in 1258 had been almost as one man on the side of\r\nthe opposition, but who by the end of 1263 had with almost equal\r\nunanimity rallied to the crown.[1] The causes of this change of\r\nfront are to be found partly in public and partly in personal reasons.\r\nIn 1258 Henry III., like Charles I. in 1640, had alienated every class\r\nof his subjects, and was therefore entirely at the mercy of his\r\nenemies. By 1263 his concessions had procured for him a following, so\r\nthat he now stood in the same position as Charles after his concessions\r\nto the Long Parliament made it possible for him to begin the Civil War\r\nin 1642. A new royalist party was growing up with a wider policy and\r\ngreater efficiency than the old coterie of courtiers and aliens. Of\r\nthis new party Edward was the soul. He had dissociated himself from\r\nEarl Simon, but he carried into his father's camp something of Simon's\r\nbreadth of vision and force of will. He set to work to win over\r\nindividually the remnant that adhered to Leicester. What persuasion and\r\npolicy could not effect was accomplished by bribes and promises. Edward\r\nwon over the Earl of Hereford, whose importance was doubled by his\r\ncustody of the Gloucester lands, the ex-justiciar Roger Bigod, and\r\nabove all Roger Mortimer.\r\n\r\n    [1] On this, and the whole marcher and Welsh aspect of the\r\n    period, 1258-1267, see my essay on Wales and _the March during\r\n    the Barons' Wars_ in _Owens College Historical Essays_, pp.\r\n    76-136 (1902).\r\n\r\nThe change of policy of the marchers was partly at least brought about\r\nby their constant difficulties with the Prince of Wales. During the\r\nperiod immediately succeeding the Provisions of Oxford, Llewelyn ceased\r\nto devastate the marches. A series of truces was arranged which, if\r\nseldom well kept, at least avoided war on a grand scale. Within Wales\r\nLlewelyn fully availed himself of the respite from English war.\r\nTriumphant over the minor chiefs, he could reckon upon the support of\r\nevery Welsh tenant of a marcher lord, and at last grew strong enough to\r\ndisregard the truces and wage open war against the marchers. It was in\r\nvain that Edward, the greatest of the marcher lords, persuaded David,\r\nthe Welsh prince's brother, to rise in revolt against him. Llewelyn\r\ndevastated the four cantreds to the gates of Chester, and at last,\r\nafter long sieges, forced the war-worn defenders of Deganwy and Diserth\r\nto surrender the two strong castles through which alone Edward had\r\nretained some hold over his Welsh lands. It was the same in the middle\r\nmarch, where Llewelyn turned his arms against the Mortimers, and robbed\r\nthem of their castles. Even in the south the lord of Gwynedd carried\r\neverything before him. \"If the Welsh are not stopped,\" wrote a southern\r\nmarcher, \"they will destroy all the lands of the king as far as the\r\nSevern and the Wye, and they ask for nothing less than the whole of\r\nGwent.\" Up to this point the war had been a war of Welsh against\r\nEnglish, but Montfort sought compensation for his losses in England by\r\nestablishing relations with the Welsh. The alliance between Montfort\r\nand their enemy had a large share in bringing about the secession of\r\nthe marchers. Their alliance with Edward neutralised the action of\r\nMontfort, and once more enabled Henry to repudiate the Provisions.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1263, Edward and Montfort both raised armies.\r\nLeicester made himself master of Hereford, Gloucester, and Bristol, and\r\nwhen Edward threw himself into Windsor Castle, he occupied Isleworth,\r\nhoping to cut his enemy off from London, where the king and queen had\r\ntaken refuge in the Tower. But the hostility of the Londoners made the\r\nTower an uneasy refuge for them. On one occasion, when the queen\r\nattempted to make her way up the Thames in the hope of joining her son\r\nat Windsor, the citizens assailed her barge so fiercely from London\r\nBridge that she was forced to return to the Tower. The foul insults\r\nwhich the rabble poured upon his mother deeply incensed Edward and he\r\nbecame a bitter foe of the city for the rest of his life. For the\r\nmoment the hostility of London was decisive against Henry. Once more\r\nthe king was forced to confirm the Provisions, agree to a fresh\r\nbanishment of the aliens, and restore Hugh Despenser to the\r\njusticiarship. This was the last baronial triumph. In a few weeks\r\nEdward again took up arms, and was joined by many of Montfort's\r\nassociates, including his cousin, Henry of Almaine. Even the Earl of\r\nGloucester was wavering. The barons feared the appeal to arms, and\r\nentered into negotiations. Neither side was strong enough to obtain\r\nmastery over the other, and a recourse to arbitration seemed the best\r\nway out of an impossible situation. Accordingly, on December, 1263, the\r\ntwo parties agreed to submit the question of the validity of the\r\nProvisions to the judgment of Louis IX.\r\n\r\nThe king and his son at once crossed the channel to Amiens, where the\r\nFrench king was to hear both sides. A fall from his horse prevented\r\nLeicester attending the arbitration, and the barons were represented by\r\nPeter Montfort, lord of Beaudesert castle in Warwickshire, and\r\nrepresentative of an ancient Anglo-Norman house that was not akin to\r\nthe family of Earl Simon. Louis did not waste time, and on January 23,\r\n1264, issued his decision in a document called the \"Mise of Amiens,\"\r\nwhich pronounced the Provisions invalid, largely on the ground of the\r\npapal sentence. Henry was declared free to select his own wardens of\r\ncastles and ministers, and Louis expressly annulled \"the statute that\r\nthe realm of England should henceforth be governed by native-born\r\nEnglishmen\". \"We ordain,\" he added, \"that the king shall have full\r\npower and free jurisdiction over his realm as in the days before the\r\nProvisions.\" The only consolation to the barons was that Louis declared\r\nthat he did not intend to derogate from the ancient liberties of the\r\nrealm, as established by charter or custom, and that he urged a general\r\namnesty on both parties. In all essential points Louis decided in\r\nfavour of Henry. Though the justest of kings, he was after all a king,\r\nand the limitation of the royal authority by a baronial committee\r\nseemed to him to be against the fundamental idea of monarchy. The pious\r\nson of the Church was biassed by the authority of two successive popes,\r\nand he was not unmoved by the indignation of his wife, the sister of\r\nQueen Eleanor. A few weeks later Urban IV. confirmed the award.\r\n\r\nThe Mise of Amiens was too one-sided to be accepted. The decision to\r\nrefer matters to St. Louis had been made hastily, and many enemies of\r\nthe king had taken no part in it. They, at least, were free to\r\nrepudiate the judgment and they included the Londoners, the Cinque\r\nPorts, and nearly the whole of the lesser folk of England. The\r\nLondoners set the example of rebellion. They elected a constable and a\r\nmarshal, and joining forces with Hugh Despenser, the baronial\r\njusticiar, who still held the Tower, marched out to Isleworth, where\r\nthey burnt the manor of the King of the Romans. \"And this,\" wrote the\r\nLondon Chronicler, \"was the beginning of trouble and the origin of the\r\ndeadly war by which so many thousand men perished.\" The Londoners did\r\nnot act alone. Leicester refused to be bound by the award, though\r\ndefinitely pledged to obey it. It was, he maintained, as much perjury\r\nto abandon the Provisions as to be false to the promise to accept the\r\nMise of Amiens. After a last attempt at negotiation at a parliament at\r\nOxford, he withdrew with his followers and prepared for resistance.\r\n\"Though all men quit me,\" he cried, \"I will remain with my four sons\r\nand fight for the good cause which I have sworn to defend--the honour\r\nof Holy Church and the good of the realm.\" This was no mere boast. The\r\nmore his associates fell away, the more the Montfort family took the\r\nlead. While Leicester organised resistance in the south, he sent his\r\nelder sons, Simon and Henry, to head the revolt in the midlands and the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nThere was already war in the march of Wales when Henry Montfort crossed\r\nthe Severn and strove to make common cause with Llewelyn. But the Welsh\r\nprince held aloof from him, and Edward himself soon made his way to the\r\nmarch. At first all went well for young Montfort. Edward, unable to\r\ncapture Gloucester and its bridge, was forced to beg for a truce.\r\nBefore long he found himself strong enough to repudiate the armistice\r\nand take possession of Gloucester. Master of the chief passage over the\r\nlower Severn, Edward abandoned the western campaign and went with his\r\nmarchers to join his father at Oxford, where he at once stirred up the\r\nking to activity. The masters of the university, who were strong\r\npartisans of Montfort, were chased away from the town. Then the royal\r\narmy marched against Northampton, the headquarters of the younger\r\nSimon, who was resting there, and, on April 4, the king and his son\r\nburst upon the place. Their first assault was unsuccessful, but next\r\nday the walls were scaled, the town captured, and many leading barons,\r\nincluding young Simon, taken prisoner. The victors thereupon marched\r\nnorthwards, devastated Montfort's Leicestershire estates, and thence\r\nproceeded to Nottingham, which opened its gates in a panic.\r\n\r\nLeicester himself had not been idle. While his sons were courting\r\ndisaster in the west and midlands, he threw himself into London, where\r\nhe was rapturously welcomed. The Londoners, however, became very\r\nunruly, committed all sorts of excesses against the wealthy royalists,\r\nand cruelly plundered and murdered the Jews. Montfort himself did not\r\ndisdain to share in the spoils of the Jewry, though he soon turned to\r\nnobler work. He was anxious to open up communications with his allies\r\nin the Cinque Ports. But Earl Warenne, in Rochester castle, blocked the\r\npassage of the Dover road over the Medway. Accordingly Montfort marched\r\nwith a large following of Londoners to Rochester, captured the town,\r\nand assaulted the castle with such energy that it was on the verge of\r\nsurrendering. The news of Warenne's peril reached Henry in the\r\nmidlands. In five days the royalists made their way from Nottingham to\r\nRochester, a distance of over 160 miles. On their approach Montfort\r\nwithdrew into London.\r\n\r\nFlushed with their successes at Northampton and Rochester, the\r\nroyalists marched through Kent and Sussex, plundering and devastating\r\nthe lands of their enemies. Though masters of the open country, they\r\nhad to encounter the resistance of the Clare castles, and the solid\r\nopposition of the Cinque Ports. Their presence on the south coast was\r\nspecially necessary, for Queen Eleanor, who had gone abroad, was\r\nwaiting, with an army of foreign mercenaries, on the Flemish coast, for\r\nan opportunity of sailing to her husband's succour. The royal army was\r\nhampered by want of provisions, and was only master of the ground on\r\nwhich it was camped. As a first fruit of the alliance with Llewelyn,\r\nWelsh soldiers lurked behind every hedge and hill, cut off stragglers,\r\nintercepted convoys, and necessitated perpetual watchfulness. At last\r\nthe weary and hungry troops found secure quarters in Lewes, the centre\r\nof the estates of Earl Warenne.\r\n\r\nMontfort then marched southwards from the capital. Besides the baronial\r\nretinues, a swarm of Londoners, eager for the fray, though unaccustomed\r\nto military restraints, accompanied him. On May 13 he encamped at\r\nFletching, a village hidden among the dense oak woods of the Weald,\r\nsome nine miles north of Lewes. A last effort of diplomacy was\r\nattempted by Bishop Cantilupe of Worcester who, despite papal censures,\r\nstill accompanied the baronial forces. But the royalists would not\r\nlisten to the mediation of so pronounced a partisan. Nothing therefore\r\nwas left but the appeal to the sword.\r\n\r\nThe royal army was the more numerous, and included the greater names.\r\nOf the heroes of the struggle of 1258 the majority was in the king's\r\ncamp, including most of the lords of the Welsh march, and the hardly\r\nless fierce barons of the north, whose grandfathers had wrested the\r\nGreat Charter from John. The returned Poitevins with their followers\r\nmustered strongly, and the confidence of the royalists was so great\r\nthat they neglected all military preparations. The poverty of\r\nMontfort's host in historic families attested the complete\r\ndisintegration of the party since 1263. Its strength lay in the young\r\nenthusiasts, who were still dominated by the strong personality and\r\ngenerous ideals of Leicester, such as the Earl of Gloucester, or\r\nHumphrey Bohun of Brecon, whose father, the Earl of Hereford, was\r\nfighting upon the king's side. Early on the morning of May 14 Montfort\r\narrayed his troops and marched southward in the direction of Lewes.\r\nDawn had hardly broken when the troops were massed on the summit of the\r\nSouth Downs, overlooking Lewes from the north-west.\r\n\r\nLewes is situated on the right bank of a great curve of the river Ouse,\r\nwhich almost encircles the town. To the south are the low-lying marshes\r\nthrough which the river meanders towards the sea, while to the north,\r\neast, and west are the bare slopes of the South Downs, through which\r\nthe river forces its way past the gap in which the town is situated. To\r\nthe north of the town lies the strong castle of the Warennes, wherein\r\nEdward had taken up his quarters, while in the southern suburb the\r\nCluniac priory of St. Pancras, the chief foundation of the Warennes,\r\nafforded lodgings for King Henry and the King of the Romans. When Simon\r\nreached the summit of the downs, his movements were visible from the\r\nwalls. But the royal army was still sleeping and its sentinels kept\r\nsuch bad watch that the earl was able to array his troops at his\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of the hills two great spurs, separated by a waterless\r\nvalley, slope down towards the north and west sides of the town. The\r\nmore northerly led straight to the castle, and the more southerly to\r\nthe priory. Montfort's plan was to throw his main strength on the\r\nattack on the priory, while deluding the enemy into the belief that his\r\nchief object was to attack the castle. He was not yet fully recovered\r\nfrom his fall from his horse, and it was known that he generally\r\ntravelled in a closed car or horse-litter. This vehicle he posted in a\r\nconspicuous place on the northerly spur, and planted over it his\r\nstandard. In front of it were massed the London militia, mainly\r\ninfantry and the least effective element in his host. Meanwhile the\r\nknights and men-at-arms were mustered on the southerly spur under the\r\npersonal direction of Montfort, who held himself in the rear with the\r\nreserve, while the foremost files were commanded by the young Earl of\r\nGloucester, whom Simon solemnly dubbed to knighthood before the\r\nassembled squadrons. Then the two divisions of the army advanced\r\ntowards Lewes, hoping to find their enemies still in their beds.\r\n\r\nAt the last moment the alarm was given, and before the barons\r\napproached the town, the royalists, pouring out of castle, town, and\r\npriory, hastily took up their position face to face to the enemy. All\r\nturned out as Montfort had foreseen. Edward, emerging from the castle\r\nwith his cousin Henry of Almaine, his Poitevin uncles, and the warriors\r\nof the march, observed the standard of Montfort on the hill, and\r\nsupposing that the earl was with his banner, dashed impetuously against\r\nthe left wing of Leicester's troops. He soon found himself engaged with\r\nthe Londoners, who broke and fled in confusion before his impetuous\r\ncharge. Eager to revenge on the flying citizens the insults they had\r\ndirected against his parents, he pursued the beaten militia for many a\r\nmile, inflicting terrible damage upon them. On his way he captured\r\nSimon's standard and horse-litter, and slew its occupants, though they\r\nwere three royalist members of the city aristocracy detained there for\r\nsure keeping. When the king's son drew rein he was many miles from\r\nLewes, whither he returned, triumphant but exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe removal of Edward and the marchers from the field enabled Montfort\r\nto profit by his sacrifice of the Londoners. The followers of the two\r\nkings on the left of the royalist lines could not withstand the weight\r\nof the squadrons of Leicester and Gloucester. The King of the Romans\r\nwas driven to take refuge in a mill, where he soon made an ignominious\r\nsurrender. Henry himself lost his horse under him and was forced to\r\nyield himself prisoner to Gilbert of Gloucester. The mass of the army\r\nwas forced back on to the town and priory, which were occupied by the\r\nvictors. Scarcely was their victory assured when Edward and the\r\nmarchers came back from the pursuit of the Londoners. Thereupon the\r\nbattle was renewed in the streets of the town. It was, however, too\r\nlate for the weary followers of the king's son to reverse the fortunes\r\nof the day. Some threw themselves into the castle, where the king's\r\nstandard still floated; Edward himself took sanctuary in the church of\r\nthe Franciscans; many strove to escape eastwards over the Ouse bridge\r\nor by swimming over the river. The majority of the latter perished by\r\ndrowning or by the sword: but two compact bands of mail-clad horsemen\r\nmanaged to cut their way through to safety. One of these, a force of\r\nsome two hundred, headed by Earl Warenne himself, and his\r\nbrothers-in-law, Guy of Lusignan and William of Valence, secured their\r\nretreat to the spacious castle of Pevensey, of which Warenne was\r\nconstable, and from which the possibility of continuing their flight by\r\nsea remained open. Of greater military consequence was the successful\r\nescape of the lords of the Welsh march, whose followers were next day\r\nthe only section of the royalist army which was still a fighting force.\r\nThis was the only immediate limitation to the fulness of Montfort's\r\nvictory. After seven weary years, the judgment of battle secured the\r\ntriumph of the \"good cause,\" which had so long been delayed by the\r\nweakness of his confederates and the treachery of his enemies. Not the\r\nbarons of 1258, but Simon and his personal following _were_ the real\r\nconquerors at Lewes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE RULE OF MONTFORT AND THE ROYALIST RESTORATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day after the battle, Henry III. accepted the terms imposed upon\r\nhim by Montfort in a treaty called the \"Mise of Lewes,\" by which he\r\npromised to uphold the Great Charter, the Charter of the Forests, and\r\nthe Provisions of Oxford. A body of arbitrators was constituted, in\r\nwhich the Bishop of London was the only Englishman, but which included\r\nMontfort's friend, Archbishop Eudes Rigaud of Rouen; the new papal\r\nlegate, Guy Foulquois, cardinal-bishop of Sabina; and Peter the\r\nchamberlain, Louis IX.'s most trusted counsellor, with the Duke of\r\nBurgundy or Charles of Anjou, to act as umpire. These arbitrators were,\r\nhowever, to be sworn to choose none save English councillors, and Henry\r\ntook oath to follow the advice of his native-born council in all\r\nmatters of state. An amnesty was secured to Leicester and Gloucester;\r\nand Edward and Henry of Almaine surrendered as hostages for the good\r\nbehaviour of the marchers, who still remained under arms. By the\r\nestablishment of baronial partisans as governors of the castles,\r\nministers, sheriffs, and conservators of the peace, the administration\r\npassed at once into the hands of the victorious party. Three weeks\r\nlater writs were issued for a parliament which included four knights\r\nfrom every shire. In this assembly the final conditions of peace were\r\ndrawn up, and arrangements made for keeping Henry under control for the\r\nrest of his life, and Edward after him, for a term of years to be\r\ndetermined in due course. Leicester and Gloucester were associated with\r\nStephen Berkstead, the Bishop of Chichester, to form a body of three\r\nelectors. By these three a Council of Nine was appointed, three of whom\r\nwere to be in constant attendance at court; and without their advice\r\nthe king was to do nothing. Hugh Despenser was continued as justiciar,\r\nwhile the chancery went to the Bishop of Worcester's nephew, Thomas of\r\nCantilupe, a Paris doctor of canon law, and chancellor of the\r\nUniversity of Oxford.\r\n\r\nOnce more a baronial committee put the royal authority into commission,\r\nand ruled England through ministers of its own choice. While agreeing\r\nin this essential feature, the settlement of 1264 did not merely\r\nreproduce the constitution of 1258. It was simpler than its forerunner,\r\nsince there was no longer any need of the cumbrous temporary machinery\r\nfor the revision of the whole system of government, nor for the\r\nnumerous committees and commissions to which previously so many\r\nfunctions had been assigned. The main tasks before the new rulers were\r\nnot constitution-making but administration and defence. Moreover, the\r\nlater constitution shows some recognition of the place due to the\r\nknights of the shire and their constituents. It is less closely\r\noligarchical than the previous scheme. This may partly be due to the\r\ncontinued divisions of the greater barons, but it is probably also in\r\nlarge measure owing to the preponderance of Simon of Montfort. The\r\nyoung Earl of Gloucester and the simple and saintly Bishop of\r\nChichester were but puppets in his hands. He was the real elector who\r\nnominated the council, and thus controlled the government. Every act of\r\nthe new administration reflects the boldness and largeness of his\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nThe pacification after Lewes was more apparent than real, and there\r\nwere many restless spirits that scorned to accept the settlement which\r\nHenry had so meekly adopted. The marchers were in arms in the west, and\r\nwere specially formidable because they detained in their custody the\r\nnumerous prisoners captured at the sack of Northampton. The fugitives\r\nfrom Lewes were holding their own behind the walls of Pevensey, though\r\nEarl Warenne and other leaders had made their escape to France, where\r\nthey joined the army which Queen Eleanor had collected on the north\r\ncoast for the purpose of invading England and restoring her husband to\r\npower. The papacy and the whole official forces of the Church were in\r\nbitter hostility to the new system. The collapse of Henry's rule had\r\nruined the papal plans in Sicily, where Manfred easily maintained his\r\nground against so strong a successor of the unlucky Edmund as Charles\r\nof Anjou. The papal legate, Guy Foulquois, was waiting at Boulogne for\r\nadmission into England, and, far from being conciliated by his\r\nappointment as an arbitrator, was dexterously striving to make the\r\narbitration ineffective, by summoning the bishops adhering to Montfort\r\nto appear before him, and sending them back with orders to\r\nexcommunicate Earl Simon and all his supporters. The only gleam of hope\r\nwas to be found in the unwillingness of the King of France to interfere\r\nactively in the domestic disputes of England. The death of Urban IV.\r\nfor the moment brought relief, but, after a long vacancy, the new pope\r\nproved to be none other than the legate Guy, who in February, 1265,\r\nmounted the papal throne as Clement IV. It was to no purpose that\r\nWalter of Cantilupe assembled the patriotic bishops and appealed to a\r\ngeneral council, or that radical friars like the author of the _Song of\r\nLewes_ formulated the popular policy in spirited verse. The greatest\r\nforces of the time were steadily opposed to the revolutionary\r\ngovernment, and rare strength and boldness were necessary to make head\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of 1264 the vigour of Earl Simon triumphed over some of\r\nhis immediate difficulties. In August he summoned the military forces\r\nof the realm to meet the threatened invasion. Adverse storms, however,\r\ndispersed Queen Eleanor's fleet, and her mercenaries, weary of the long\r\ndelays that had exhausted her resources, went home in disgust. This\r\nleft Simon free to betake himself to the west, and on December 15 he\r\nforced the marcher lords to accept a pacification called the Provisions\r\nof Worcester, by which they agreed to withdraw for a year and a day to\r\nIreland, leaving their families and estates in the hands of the ruling\r\nfaction.\r\n\r\nOn the day after the signature of the treaty, Henry, who accompanied\r\nSimon to the west, issued from Worcester the writs for a parliament\r\nthat sat in London from January to March in 1265. From the\r\ncircumstances of the case this famous assembly could only be a meeting\r\nof the supporters of the existing government. So scanty was its\r\nfollowing among the magnates that writs of summons were only issued to\r\nfive earls and eighteen barons, though the strong muster of bishops,\r\nabbots, and priors showed that the papal anathema had done little to\r\nshake the fidelity of the clergy to Montfort's cause. The special\r\nfeature of the gathering, however, was the summoning of two knights\r\nfrom every shire, side by side with the barons of the faithful Cinque\r\nPorts and two representatives from every city and borough, convened by\r\nwrits sent, not to the sheriff, after later custom, but to the cities\r\nand boroughs directly. It was the presence of this strong popular\r\nelement which long caused this parliament to be regarded as the first\r\nreally representative assembly in our history, and gained for Earl\r\nSimon the fame of being the creator of the House of Commons. Modern\r\nresearch has shown that neither of these views can be substantiated. It\r\nwas no novelty for the crown to strengthen the baronial parliaments by\r\nthe representatives of the shire-moots, and there were earlier\r\nprecedents for the holding meetings of the spokesmen of the cities and\r\nboroughs. What was new was the combination of these two types of\r\nrepresentatives in a single assembly, which was convoked, not merely\r\nfor a particular administrative purpose, but for a great political\r\nobject. The real novelty and originality of Earl Simon's action lay in\r\nhis giving a fresh proof of his disposition to fall back upon the\r\nsupport of the ordinary citizen against the hostility or indifference\r\nof the magnates, to whom the men of 1258 wished to limit all political\r\ndeliberation. This is in itself a sufficient indication of policy to\r\ngive Leicester an almost unique position among the statesmen to whom\r\nthe development of our representative institutions are due. But just as\r\nhis parliament was not in any sense our first representative assembly,\r\nso it did not include in any complete sense a House of Commons at all.\r\nWe must still wait for a generation before the rival and disciple of\r\nMontfort, Edward, the king's son, established the popular element in\r\nour parliament on a permanent basis. Yet in the links which connect the\r\nearly baronial councils with the assemblies of the three estates of the\r\nfourteenth century, not one is more important than Montfort's\r\nparliament of January, 1265.\r\n\r\nThe chief business of parliament was to complete the settlement of the\r\ncountry. Simon won a new triumph in making terms with the king's son.\r\nEdward had witnessed the failure of his mother's attempts at invasion,\r\nthe futility of the legatine anathema, and the collapse of the marchers\r\nat Worcester. He saw it was useless to hold out any longer, and\r\nunwillingly bought his freedom at the high price that Simon exacted. He\r\ntransferred to his uncle the earldom of Chester, including all the\r\nlands in Wales that might still be regarded as appertaining to it. This\r\nmeasure put Simon in that strong position as regards Wales and the west\r\nwhich Edward had enjoyed since the days of his marriage. It involved a\r\nbreach in the alliance between Edward and the marchers, and the\r\nsubjection of the most dangerous district of the kingdom to Simon's\r\npersonal authority. It was safe to set free the king's son, when his\r\nterritorial position and his political alliances were thus weakened.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of his apparent triumph, Montfort's authority began to\r\ndecline. It was something to have the commons on his side: but the\r\nmagnates were still the greatest power in England, and in pressing his\r\nown policy to the uttermost, Simon had fatally alienated the few great\r\nlords who still adhered to him. There was a fierce quarrel in\r\nparliament between Leicester and the shifty Robert Ferrars, Earl of\r\nDerby. For the moment Leicester prevailed, and Derby was stripped of\r\nhis lands and was thrown into prison. But his fate was a warning to\r\nothers, and the settlement between Montfort and Edward aroused the\r\nsuspicions of the Earl of Gloucester. Gilbert of Clare was now old\r\nenough to think for himself, and his close personal devotion to\r\nMontfort could not blind him to the antagonism of interests between\r\nhimself and his friend. He was gallant, strenuous, and high-minded, but\r\nquarrelsome, proud, and unruly, and his strong character was balanced\r\nby very ordinary ability. His outlook was limited, and his ideals were\r\nthose of his class; such a man could neither understand nor sympathise\r\nwith the broader vision and wider designs of Leicester. Moreover, with\r\nall Simon's greatness, there was in him a fierce masterfulness and an\r\ninordinate ambition which made co-operation with him excessively\r\ndifficult for all such as were not disposed to stand to him in the\r\nrelation of disciple to master. And behind the earl were his\r\nself-seeking and turbulent sons, set upon building up a family interest\r\nthat stood directly in the way of the magnates' claim to control the\r\nstate. Thus personal rivalries and political antagonisms combined to\r\nlead Earl Gilbert on in the same course that his father, Earl Richard,\r\nhad traversed. The closest ally of Leicester became his bitterest\r\nrival. The victorious party split up in 1265, as it had split up in\r\n1263. And the dissolution of the dominant faction once more gave Edward\r\na better chance of regaining the upper hand than was to be hoped for\r\nfrom foreign mercenaries and from papal support.\r\n\r\nGloucester was the natural leader of the lords of the Welsh march. He\r\nwas not only the hereditary lord of Glamorgan, but had received the\r\ncustody of William of Valence's forfeited palatinate of Pembroke. He\r\nhad shown self-control in separating himself so long from the marcher\r\npolicy; and his growing suspicion of the Montforts threw him back into\r\nhis natural alliance with them. Even after the treaty of Worcester, the\r\nmarchers remained under arms. They had obtained from the weakness of\r\nthe government repeated prolongations of the period fixed for their\r\nwithdrawal into Ireland. It was soon rumoured that they were sure of a\r\nrefuge in Gloucester's Welsh estates, and Leicester, never afraid of\r\nmaking enemies, bitterly reproached Earl Gilbert with receiving the\r\nfugitives into his lands. Shortly after the breaking up of parliament,\r\nGloucester fled to the march, and a little later William of Valence and\r\nEarl Warenne landed in Pembrokeshire with a small force of men-at-arms\r\nand crossbowmen. There was no longer any hope of carrying out the\r\nProvisions of Worcester, and once more Montfort was forced to proceed\r\nto the west to put down rebellion.\r\n\r\nBy the end of April Montfort was at Gloucester, accompanied by the king\r\nand Edward, who, despite his submission, remained virtually a prisoner.\r\nEarl Gilbert was master of all South Wales, and closely watched his\r\nrival's movements from the neighbouring Forest of Dean. It was with\r\ndifficulty that Earl Simon and his royal captives advanced from\r\nGloucester to Hereford, but Earl Gilbert preferred to negotiate rather\r\nthan to push matters to extremities. He went in person to Hereford and\r\nrenewed his homage to the king. Arbitrators were appointed to settle\r\nthe disputes between the two earls, and a proclamation was issued\r\ndeclaring that the rumour of dissension between them was \"vain, lying,\r\nand fraudulently invented\". For the next few days harmony seemed\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nGloucester's submission lured Leicester into relaxing his precautions.\r\nHis enemies took advantage of his remissness to hatch an audacious plot\r\nwhich soon enabled them to renew the struggle under more favourable\r\nconditions. Since his nominal release, Edward had been allowed the\r\ndiversions of riding and hunting, and on May 28 he was suffered to go\r\nout for a ride under negligent or corrupt guard. Once well away from\r\nHereford, the king's son fled from his lax custodians and joined Roger\r\nMortimer, who was waiting for him in a neighbouring wood. On the next\r\nday he was safe behind the walls of Mortimer's castle of Wigmore, and,\r\nthe day after, met Earl Gilbert at Ludlow, where he promised to uphold\r\nthe charters and expel the foreigners. Valence and Warenne hurried from\r\nPembrokeshire and made common cause with Edward and Gilbert. Edward\r\nthen took the lead in the councils of the marchers, who, from that\r\nmoment, obtained a unity of purpose and policy that they had hitherto\r\nlacked. He and his allies could claim to be the true champions of the\r\nCharters and the Provisions of Oxford against the grasping foreigner\r\nwho strove to rule over king and barons alike.\r\n\r\nMontfort's small force was cut off from its base by the rapidity of the\r\nmarchers' movements. It was in vain that all the supporters of the\r\nexisting government were summoned to the assistance of the hard-pressed\r\narmy at Hereford. Before the end of June, Edward completed the conquest\r\nof the Severn valley by the capture of the town and castle of\r\nGloucester. A broad river and a strong army stood between Montfort and\r\nsuccour from England. Leicester then turned to Llewelyn of Wales, who\r\ntook up his quarters at Pipton, near Hay. There, on June 22, a treaty\r\nwas signed between the Welsh prince and the English king by which Henry\r\nwas forced to make huge concessions to Llewelyn in order to secure his\r\nalliance. Llewelyn was recognised as prince of all Wales. The\r\noverlordship over all the barons of Wales was granted to him, and the\r\nnumerous conquests, which he had made at the expense of the marchers,\r\nwere ceded to him in full possession.\r\n\r\nThus Llewelyn, like his grandfather in the days of the Great Charter,\r\nprofited by the dissensions of the English to obtain the recognition of\r\nhis claims which had invariably been refused when England was united.\r\nThe Welsh prince gained a unique opportunity of making his weight felt\r\nin general English politics, but with all his ability he hardly rose to\r\nthe occasion. Montfort had pressing need of his help. A few days after\r\nthe treaty of Pipton, Gloucester Castle opened its gates to Edward, and\r\nthe marchers advanced westwards to seek out Earl Simon at Hereford.\r\nLeicester fled in alarm before their overwhelming forces. He was driven\r\nfrom the Wye to the Usk, and, beaten in a sharp fight on Newport\r\nbridge, found refuge only by retreating up the Usk valley, whence he\r\nescaped northwards into the hilly region where Llewelyn ruled over the\r\nlands once dominated by the Mortimers. Before long Montfort's English\r\nfollowers grew weary of the hard conditions of mountain warfare. With\r\ntheir heavy armour and barbed horses it was difficult for them to\r\nemulate the tactics of the Welsh, and they revolted against the simple\r\ndiet of milk and meat that contented their Celtic allies. They could\r\nnot get on without bread, and, as bread was not to be found among the\r\nhills, they forced their leader to return to the richer regions of the\r\neast. Llewelyn did little to help them in their need, and did not\r\naccompany them in their march back to the Severn valley, though a large\r\nbut disorderly force of Welsh infantry still remained with Simon as the\r\nfruit of the alliance with their prince.\r\n\r\nBy the end of July, Simon was once more in the Severn valley, seeking\r\nfor a passage over the river. On August 2 he found a ford over the\r\nstream some miles south of Worcester. There he crossed with all his\r\nforces and encamped for the night at Kempsey, one of Bishop Cantilupe's\r\nmanors on the left bank. His skill as a general had extricated him from\r\na position of the utmost peril. All might yet be regained if he could\r\njoin forces with an army of relief which his son Simon had slowly\r\nlevied in the south and midlands. But his quarrel with Gloucester and\r\nhis alliance with the Welsh had done much to undermine Montfort's\r\npopularity, and the younger Simon had no appreciation of the necessity\r\nfor decisive action. Summoned from the long siege of Pevensey by his\r\nfather's danger, he wasted time in plundering the lands of the\r\nroyalists, and only left London on July 8, whence he led his men by\r\nslow stages to Kenilworth. On July 31 young Simon's troops took up\r\ntheir quarters for the night in the open country round Kenilworth\r\ncastle. They had no notion that the enemy was at hand and troubled\r\nneither to defend themselves nor to keep watch. Edward, warned by spies\r\nof their approach, abandoned his close guard of the Severn fords, and\r\nin the early morning of August 1 fell suddenly upon the sleeping host\r\nand scattered it with little difficulty. The younger Simon and a few of\r\nhis followers took refuge in the castle. As a fighting force the army\r\nof relief ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nLeicester, knowing nothing of his son's disaster, made his way, on\r\nAugust 3, from Kempsey to Evesham, where he rested for the night. Next\r\nmorning, after mass and breakfast, the army was about to continue its\r\nmarch, when scouts descried troops advancing upon the town. At first it\r\nwas hoped that they were the followers of young Simon, but their near\r\napproach revealed them to be the army of the marchers. With\r\nextraordinary rapidity Edward led his troops back to Worcester as soon\r\nas he had won the fight at Kenilworth. Learning there that Simon had\r\ncrossed the river in his absence, he at once turned back to meet him,\r\nseeking to elude his vigilance by a long night march by circuitous\r\nroutes. The result was that for the second time he caught his enemy in\r\na trap.\r\n\r\nEvesham, like Lewes, stands on a peninsula. It is situated on the right\r\nbank of a wide curve of the Avon, and approachable only by crossing\r\nover the river, or by way of the sort of isthmus between the two bends\r\nof the Avon a little to the north of the town. Edward occupied this\r\nisthmus with his best troops, and thus cut off all prospect of escape\r\nby land. The other means of exit from the town was over the bridge\r\nwhich connects it with its south-eastern suburb of Bengeworth, on the\r\nleft bank of the river. Edward, however, took the precaution to detach\r\nGloucester with a strong force to hold Bengeworth, and thus prevent\r\nSimon's escape over the bridge. The weary and war-worn host of\r\nMontfort, then, was out-generalled in such fashion that effective\r\nresistance to a superior force, flushed by recent victory, was\r\nimpossible. Simon himself saw that his last hour was come; yet he could\r\nnot but admire the skilful plan which had so easily discomfited him.\r\n\"By the arm of St. James,\" he declared, \"they come on cunningly. Yet\r\nthey have not taught themselves that order of battle; they have learnt\r\nit from me. God have mercy upon our souls, for our bodies are theirs.\"\r\n\r\nEdward and Gloucester both advanced simultaneously to the attack. A\r\nstorm broke at the moment of the encounter, and the battle was fought\r\nin a darkness that obscured the brightness of an August day.\r\nLeicester's Welsh infantry broke at once before the charge of the\r\nmail-clad horsemen, and took refuge behind hedges and walls, where they\r\nwere hunted out and butchered after the main fight was over. But the\r\nmen-at-arms struggled valiantly against Edward's superior forces,\r\nthough they were soon borne down by sheer numbers. Simon fought like a\r\nhero and met a soldier's death. With him were slain his son Henry, his\r\nfaithful comrade Peter Montfort, the baronial justiciar Hugh Despenser,\r\nand many other men of mark. A large number of prisoners fell into the\r\nvictor's hands, and King Henry, who unwillingly followed Simon in all\r\nhis wanderings, was wounded in the shoulder by his son's followers, and\r\nonly escaped a worse fate by revealing his identity with the cry: \"Slay\r\nme not! I am Henry of Winchester, your King.\" The marchers gratified\r\ntheir rage by massacring helpless fugitives, and by mutilating the\r\nbodies of the slain. Earl Simon's head was sent as a present to the\r\nwife of Roger Mortimer; and it was with difficulty that the mangled\r\ncorpse found its last rest in the church of Evesham Abbey. His memory\r\nlong lived in the hearts of his adopted countrymen, and especially\r\namong monks and friars, who despite the ban of the Church, hailed him\r\nas another St. Thomas, for he too had lain down his life for the cause\r\nof justice and religion. Miracles were worked at his tomb; liturgies\r\ncomposed in his honour, and an informal popular canonisation, which no\r\npapal censures could prevent, kept his memory green. His faults were\r\nforgotten in the pathos of his end. His work survived the field of\r\nEvesham and the reaction which succeeded it. His victorious nephew\r\nlearnt well the lesson of his career, and the true successor of the\r\nmartyred earl was the future Edward I.\r\n\r\nNo thoughts of policy disturbed the fierce passion of revenge which\r\npossessed the victorious marchers. On August 7 Henry issued a\r\nproclamation announcing that he had resumed the personal exercise of\r\nthe royal power. The baronial ministers and sheriffs were replaced by\r\nroyalist partisans. The acts of the revolutionary government were\r\ndenounced as invalid. The faithful city of London was cruelly\r\nhumiliated for its zeal for Earl Simon. The exiles, headed by Queen\r\nEleanor and Archbishop Boniface, returned from their long sojourn\r\nbeyond sea. With them came to England a new legate, the Cardinal\r\nOttobon, specially sent from the papal court to punish the bishops and\r\nclergy that had persisted in their adherence to the popular cause. Four\r\nprelates were excommunicated and suspended from their functions,\r\nincluding Berkstead of Chichester and Cantilupe of Worcester. But the\r\naged Bishop of Worcester was delivered from persecution by death;\r\n\"snatched away,\" as a kindly foe says, \"lest he should see evil days\".\r\nHis nephew, Thomas of Cantilupe, the baronial chancellor, fled to\r\nParis, where he forsook politics for the study of theology. The widowed\r\nCountess of Leicester was not saved by her near kindred to the king\r\nfrom lifelong banishment. At last a general sentence of forfeiture was\r\npronounced against all who had fought against Edward, either at\r\nKenilworth or Evesham. There was a greedy scramble for the spoils of\r\nvictory. The greatest of these, Montfort's forfeited earldom of\r\nLeicester, went to Edmund, the king's younger son. Edward took back the\r\nearldom of Chester and all his old possessions. Roger Mortimer was\r\nrewarded by grants of land and franchises which raised the house of\r\nWigmore to a position only surpassed by that of the strongest of the\r\nearldoms.\r\n\r\nAt first the Montfort party showed an inclination to accept the defeat\r\nat Evesham as decisive. Even young Simon of Montfort, who still held\r\nout at Kenilworth, considered it prudent to restore his prisoner, the\r\nKing of the Romans, to liberty. But the victors' resolve to deprive all\r\ntheir beaten foes of their estates, drove the vanquished into fresh\r\nrisings. The first centre of the revolt of the disinherited was at\r\nKenilworth, but before long the younger Simon abandoned the castle to\r\njoin a numerous band which had found a more secure retreat in the isle\r\nof Axholme, amidst the marshes of the lower Trent. There they held\r\ntheir own until the winter, when they were persuaded by Edward to\r\naccept terms. A little later, Simon again revolted and joined the\r\nmariners of the Cinque Ports, whose towns still held out against the\r\nking, save Dover, which Edward had captured after a siege. Under\r\nSimon's leadership the Cinque Ports played the part of pirates on all\r\nmerchants going to and from England. At last in March, 1266, Edward\r\nforced Winchelsea to open its gates to him. He next turned his arms\r\nagainst a valiant freebooter, Adam Gordon, who lurked with his band of\r\noutlaws in the dense beech woods of the Chilterns. With the capture of\r\nAdam Gordon, after a hand-to-hand tussle with Edward in which the\r\nking's son narrowly escaped with his life, the resistance in the south\r\nwas at an end.\r\n\r\nAs one centre of rebellion was pacified other disturbances arose. In\r\nthe spring of 1266, Robert Ferrars, Earl of Derby, newly released from\r\nthe prison into which Earl Simon had thrown him, raised a revolt in his\r\nown county. On May 15, 1266, Derby was defeated by Henry of Almaine at\r\nChesterfield. His earldom was transferred to Edmund, the king's son,\r\nalready Montfort's successor as Earl of Leicester, and in 1267 also\r\nEarl of Lancaster, a new earldom, deriving its name from the youngest\r\nof the shires.[1] Reduced to the Staffordshire estate of\r\nChartley, the house of Ferrars fell back into the minor baronage.\r\nKenilworth was still unconquered. Its walls were impregnable except to\r\nfamine, and before his flight to Axholme young Simon had procured\r\nprovisions adequate for a long resistance. The garrison harried the\r\nneighbourhood with such energy that the whole levies of the realm were\r\nassembled to subdue it. After a fruitless assault, the royalists\r\nsettled down to a blockade which lasted from midsummer to Christmas.\r\nThe legate, Ottobon, appearing in the besiegers' camp to excommunicate\r\nthe defenders, they in derision dressed up their surgeon in the red\r\nrobes of a cardinal, in which disguise he answered Ottobon's curses by\r\na travesty of the censures of the Church.\r\n\r\n    [1] For Edmund's estates and whole career, see W.E. Rhodes'\r\n    _Edmund, Earl of Lancaster_, in _Engl. Hist. Review_, x.\r\n    (1895), 19-40 and 209-37.\r\n\r\nThe blockade soon tried the patience of the barons. It was hard to keep\r\nany medieval army long together, and the lords, anxious to go back to\r\ntheir homes, complained of the harsh policy that compelled their long\r\nattendance. The royalist host split up into two parties, led\r\nrespectively by Roger Mortimer and Earl Gilbert of Gloucester. The\r\ncruel lord of Wigmore was the type of the extreme reaction. Intent only\r\non vengeance, booty, and ambition, Mortimer clamoured for violent\r\nmeasures, and was eager to reject all compromises. Gloucester, on the\r\nother hand, posed as the mediator, and urged the need of pacifying the\r\ndisinherited by mitigating the sentence of forfeiture which had driven\r\nthem into prolonged resistance. In the first flush of victory, Edward\r\nhad been altogether on Mortimer's side, but gradually statecraft and\r\nhumanity turned him from the reckless policy of the marcher. Edward's\r\nadhesion to counsels of moderation changed the situation. While\r\nMortimer pressed the siege of Kenilworth, Edward and Gloucester met a\r\nparliament at Northampton which agreed to uphold the policy of 1258 and\r\nmitigate the hard lot of the disinherited. A document drawn up in the\r\ncamp at Kenilworth received the approval of parliament and was\r\npublished on October 31. The _Dictum de Kenilworth_, as it was called,\r\nwas largely taken up with assertions of the authority of the crown, and\r\ndenunciations of the memory of Earl Simon. More essential points were\r\nthe re-enactment of the Charters and the redress of some of the\r\ngrievances against which the Provisions of 1258 were directed. The\r\nvital article, however, laid down that the stern sentence of forfeiture\r\nagainst adherents of the fallen cause was to be remitted, and allowed\r\nrebels to redeem their estates by paying a fine, which in most cases\r\nwas to be assessed at five years' value of their lands. Hard as were\r\nthese terms, they were milder than those which had previously been\r\noffered to the insurgents. Yet the defenders of Kenilworth could not\r\nbring themselves to accept them until December, when disease and famine\r\ncaused them to surrender. Despite their long-deferred submission, the\r\ngarrison was admitted to the terms of the _Dictum_.\r\n\r\nEven then resistance was not yet over. A forlorn hope of the\r\ndisinherited, headed by John d'Eyville, established themselves about\r\nMichaelmas in the isle of Ely, where they made themselves the terror of\r\nall East Anglia, plundering towns so far apart as Norwich and\r\nCambridge, maltreating the Jews, and holding the rich citizens to\r\nransom. Early in 1267 the north-country baron, John of Vescy, rose in\r\nNorthumberland, and violently resumed possession of his forfeited\r\ncastle of Alnwick. While Henry tarried at Cambridge, Edward went north\r\nand soon won over Vescy by the clemency which made the lord of Alnwick\r\nhenceforth one of his most devoted servants.\r\n\r\nMore formidable than the revolt of Eyville or Vescy was the ambiguous\r\nattitude of Earl Gilbert of Gloucester. Roger Mortimer was once more\r\nintriguing against him, and striving to upset the Kenilworth\r\ncompromise. After a violent scene between the two enemies in the\r\nparliament at Bury, Gloucester withdrew to the march of Wales, where he\r\nwaged war against Mortimer. In April, 1267, he made his way with a\r\ngreat following to London, professing that he wished to hold a\r\nconference with the legate. It was a critical moment. Edward was still\r\nin the north; Henry was wasting his time at Cambridge; the Londoners\r\nwelcomed Earl Gilbert as a champion of the good old cause; the legate\r\ntook refuge in the Tower, and the earl did not hesitate to lay siege to\r\nthe stronghold. Before long Gloucester was joined by Eyville and many\r\nof the Ely fugitives. It seemed as if Gloucester was in as strong\r\nposition as Montfort had ever won, and that after two years of warfare\r\nthe verdict of Evesham was about to be reversed.\r\n\r\nEdward marched south and joined forces with his father, who had moved\r\nfrom Cambridge to Stratford, near London. Everything seemed to suggest\r\nthat the eastern suburbs of London would witness a fight as stubborn as\r\nLewes or Evesham. But Gloucester was not the man to press things to\r\nextremities, and Edward though firm was conciliatory. He delivered\r\nOttobon from the hands of the rebels,[1] and then arranged a peace upon\r\nterms which secured Gloucester's chief object of procuring better\r\nconditions for the disinherited. Not only Earl Gilbert but Eyville and\r\nhis associates were admitted to the royal favour. A few desperadoes\r\nstill held out until July in the isle of Ely, and Edward devoted himself\r\nto tracking them to their lairs. He built causeways of wattles over the\r\nfens, which protected the disinherited in their last refuge. When he had\r\nclearly shown his superiority, he offered the garrison of Ely the terms\r\nof the _Dictum de Kenilworth_. With their acceptance of these conditions\r\nthe English struggle ended, in July, 1267, nearly two years after the\r\nbattle of Evesham.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Engl. Hist. Review_, xvii. (1902), 522.\r\n\r\nLlewelyn still remained under arms. He had profited by the two years of\r\nstrife to deal deadly blows against the marchers. He conquered the\r\nMid-Welsh lands which had been granted to Mortimer, and devastated\r\nEdward's Cheshire earldom. When Gloucester grew discontented with the\r\ncourse of events, the old friend of Montfort became the close ally of\r\nthe man who had ruined Montfort's cause. A Welsh chronicler treats\r\nGloucester's march to London as a movement which naturally followed the\r\nalliance of Gloucester and Llewelyn. On Gloucester's submission,\r\nLlewelyn was left to his own resources. Edward had it in his power to\r\navenge past injuries by turning all his forces against his old enemy.\r\nBut the country was weary of war, and Edward preferred to end the\r\nstruggle. The legate Ottobon urged both Edward and the Welsh prince to\r\nmake peace, and in September, 1267, Henry and his son went down to\r\nShrewsbury, accompanied by Ottobon, who received from the king full\r\npowers to treat with Llewelyn, and a promise that Henry would accept any\r\nterms that he thought fit to conclude. Llewelyn thereupon sent\r\nambassadors to Shrewsbury, and the negotiations went on so smoothly that\r\non September 25 a definite treaty of peace was signed. On Michaelmas day\r\nHenry met Llewelyn at Montgomery, received his homage, and witnessed the\r\nformal ratification of the treaty.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Shrewsbury Llewelyn was recognised as Prince of Wales,\r\nand as overlord of all the Welsh magnates, save the representative of\r\nthe old line of the princes of South Wales. The four cantreds, Edward's\r\nold patrimony, were ceded to him; and though he promised to surrender\r\nmany of his conquests, he was allowed to remain in possession of great\r\ntracts of land in Mid and South Wales, in the heart of the marcher\r\nregion.[1] Substantially the Welsh prince was recognised as holding the\r\nposition which he claimed from Montfort in the days of the treaty of\r\nPipton. Alone of Montfort's friends, Llewelyn came out of an\r\nunsuccessful struggle upon terms such as are seldom obtained even by\r\nvictory in the field. The triumph of the Welsh prince is the more\r\nremarkable because Edward and his ally, Mortimer, were the chief\r\nsufferers by the treaty. But Edward had learnt wisdom during his\r\napprenticeship. He recognised that the exhaustion of the country\r\ndemanded peace at any price, and he dreaded the possibility of the\r\nalliance of Llewelyn and Earl Gilbert. But whatever Edward's motives\r\nmay have been in concluding the treaty, it left Llewelyn in so strong a\r\nposition that he was encouraged to those fresh aggressions which in the\r\nnext reign proved the ruin of his power. The Welsh wars of Edward I.\r\nare the best elucidation of the importance of the treaty of Shrewsbury.\r\nThe Welsh principality, which Edward as king was to destroy, was as\r\nmuch the creation of the Barons' War as the outcome of the fierce\r\nCeltic enthusiasm which found its bravest champion in the son of\r\nGriffith.\r\n\r\n    [1] For the growth of Llewelyn's power see the maps of Wales in\r\n    1247 and 1267 in Owens College _Historical Essays_, pp. 76 and\r\n    135.\r\n\r\nIt was time to redeem the promises by which the moderate party had been\r\nwon over to the royalist cause. The statute of Marlborough of 1267\r\nre-enacted in a more formal fashion the chief of the Provisions of\r\nWestminster of 1259, and thus prevented the undoing of all the progress\r\nattained during the years of struggle. Ottobon in 1268 held a famous\r\ncouncil at London, in which important canons were enacted with a view\r\nto the reformation of the Church. A little later the Londoners received\r\nback their forfeited charters and the disinherited were restored to\r\ntheir estates. After these last measures of reparation, England sank\r\ninto a profound repose that lasted for the rest of the reign of Henry\r\nIII. A happy beginning of the years of peace was the dedication of the\r\nnew abbey of Westminster, and the translation of the body of St. Edward\r\nto the new shrine, whose completion had long been the dearest object of\r\nthe old king's life.\r\n\r\nAt this time Louis IX. was meditating his second crusade, and in every\r\ncountry in Europe the friars were preaching the duty of fighting the\r\ninfidel. Nowhere save in France did the Holy War win more powerful\r\nrecruits than in England. In 1268 Edward himself took the cross, [1] and\r\nwith him his brother Edmund of Lancaster, his cousin Henry of Almaine,\r\nand many leading lords of both factions. Financial difficulties delayed\r\nthe departure of the crusaders, and it was not until 1270 that Edward\r\nand Henry were able to start. On reaching Provence, they learnt that\r\nLouis had turned his arms against Tunis, whither they followed him with\r\nall speed. On Edward's arrival off Tunis, he found that Louis was dead\r\nand that Philip III., the new French king, had concluded a truce with\r\nthe misbelievers. Profoundly mortified by this treason to Christendom,\r\nEdward set forth with his little squadron to Acre, the chief town of\r\nPalestine that still remained in Christian hands. Henry of Almaine\r\npreferred to return home at once, but on his way through Italy was\r\nmurdered at Viterbo by the sons of Earl Simon of Montfort, a deed of\r\nblood which revived the bitterest memories of the Barons' War. Edward\r\nremained in Palestine until August, 1272, and threw all his wonted fire\r\nand courage into the hopeless task of upholding the fast-decaying Latin\r\nkingdom. At last alarming news of his father's health brought him back\r\nto Europe.\r\n\r\n    [1] For Edward's crusade see Riant's article in _Archives de\r\n    l'Orient Latin_, i., 617-32 (1881).\r\n\r\nOn November 16, 1272, Henry III., then in his sixty-sixth year, died at\r\nWestminster. His remains were laid at rest in the neighbouring abbey\r\nchurch, hard by the shrine of St. Edward. With him died the last of his\r\ngeneration. St. Louis' death in August, 1270, has already been recorded.\r\nThe death of Clement IV. in 1268 was followed by a three years' vacancy\r\nin the papacy. This was scarcely over when Richard, King of the Romans,\r\nprostrated by the tragedy of Viterbo, preceded his brother to the tomb.\r\nStill earlier, Boniface of Canterbury had ended his tenure of the chair\r\nof St. Augustine. The new reign begins with fresh actors and fresh\r\nmotives of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY FOREIGN POLICY AND LEGISLATION OF EDWARD I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dominican chronicler, Nicholas Trivet, thus describes the\r\npersonality of Edward I.: \"He was of elegant build and lofty stature,\r\nexceeding the height of the ordinary man by a head and shoulders. His\r\nabundant hair was yellow in childhood, black in manhood, and snowy white\r\nin age. His brow was broad, and his features regular, save that his left\r\neyelid drooped somewhat, like that of his father, and hid part of the\r\npupil. He spoke with a stammer, which did not, however, detract from the\r\npersuasiveness of his eloquence. His sinewy, muscular arms were those of\r\nthe consummate swordsman, and his long legs gave him a firm hold in the\r\nsaddle when riding the most spirited of steeds. His chief delight was in\r\nwar and tournaments, but he derived great pleasure from hawking and\r\nhunting, and had a special joy in chasing down stags on a fleet horse\r\nand slaying them with a sword instead of a hunting spear. His\r\ndisposition was magnanimous, but he was intolerant of injuries, and\r\nreckless of dangers when seeking revenge, though easily won over by a\r\nhumble submission.\"[1] The defects of his youth are well brought out by\r\nthe radical friar who wrote the _Song of Lewes_. Even to the partisan of\r\nEarl Simon, Edward was \"a valiant lion, quick to attack the strongest,\r\nand fearing the onslaught of none. But if a lion in pride and\r\nfierceness, he was a panther in inconstancy and mutability, changing his\r\nword and promise, cloaking himself by pleasant speech. When he is in a\r\nstrait he promises whatever you wish, but as soon as he has escaped he\r\nforgets his promise. The treachery or falsehood, whereby he is advanced,\r\nhe calls prudence; the way whereby he arrives whither he will, crooked\r\nthough it be, he regards as straight; whatever he likes he says is\r\nlawful, and he thinks he is released from the law, as though he were\r\ngreater than a king.\"[2]\r\n\r\n    [1] _Annals_, pp. 181-82.\r\n\r\n    [2] _Song_ of _Lewes_, pp. 14-15, ed. Kingsford.\r\n\r\nHot and impulsive in disposition, easily persuaded that his own cause\r\nwas right, and with a full share in the pride of caste, Edward\r\ncommitted many deeds of violence in his youth, and never got over his\r\ndeeply rooted habit of keeping the letter of his promise while\r\nviolating its spirit. Yet he learnt to curb his impetuous temper, and\r\nfew medieval kings had a higher idea of justice or a more strict regard\r\nto his plighted word. \"Keep troth\" was inscribed upon his tomb, and his\r\nreign signally falsified the prediction of evil which the Lewes\r\nsong-writer ventured to utter. A true sympathy bound him closely to his\r\nnobles and people. His unstained family life, his piety and religious\r\nzeal, his devotion to friends and kinsfolk, his keen interest in the\r\nbest movements of his time, showed him a true son of Henry III. But his\r\nstrength of will and seriousness of purpose stand in strong contrast to\r\nhis father's weakness and levity. A hard-working, clear-headed,\r\npractical, and sober temperament made him the most capable king of all\r\nhis line. He may have been wanting in originality or deep insight, yet\r\nit is impossible to dispute the verdict that has declared him to be the\r\ngreatest of all the Plantagenets.\r\n\r\nThe broad lines of Edward's policy during the thirty-five years of his\r\nkingship had already been laid down for him during his rude schooling.\r\nThe ineffectiveness of his father's government inspired him with a love\r\nof strong rule, and this enabled him to grapple with the chronic\r\nmaladministration which made even a well-ordered medieval kingdom a\r\nhot-bed of disorder. The age of Earl Simon had been fertile in new\r\nideals and principles of government. Edward held to the best of the\r\ntraditions of his youth, and his task was not one of creation so much\r\nas of selection. His age was an age of definition. The series of great\r\nlaws, which he made during the earlier half of his reign, represented a\r\nlong effort to appropriate what was best in the age that had gone\r\nbefore, and to combine it in orderly sequence. The same ideals mark the\r\nconstitutional policy of his later years. The materials for the future\r\nconstitution of England were already at his hand. It was a task well\r\nwithin Edward's capacity to strengthen the authority of the crown by\r\nassociating the loyal nobles and clergy in the work of ruling the\r\nstate, and to build up a body politic in which every class of the\r\nnation should have its part. Yet he never willingly surrendered the\r\nmost insignificant of his prerogatives, and if he took the people into\r\npartnership with him, he did so with the firm belief that he would be a\r\nmore powerful king if his subjects loved and trusted him. Though\r\nclosely associated with his nobles by many ties of kinship and\r\naffection, he was the uncompromising foe of feudal separatism, and\r\nhotly resented even the constitutional control which the barons\r\nregarded as their right. In the same way the unlimited franchises of\r\nthe lords of the Welsh march, the almost regal authority which the\r\ntreaty of Shrewsbury gave to the Prince of Wales, the rejection of his\r\nclaims as feudal overlord of Scotland, were abhorrent to his autocratic\r\ndisposition. True son of the Church though he was, he was the bitter\r\nfoe of ecclesiastical claims which, constantly encroaching beyond their\r\nown sphere, denied kings the fulness of their authority.\r\n\r\nEdward's policy was thoroughly comprehensive. He is not only the\r\n\"English Justinian\" and the creator of our later constitution; he has\r\nrightly been praised for his clear conception of the ideal of a united\r\nBritain which brought him into collision with Welsh and Scots. His\r\nforeign policy lay as near to his heart as the conquest of Wales or\r\nScotland, or the subjection of priests and nobles. He was eager to make\r\nGascony obey him, anxious to keep in check the French king, and to\r\nestablish a sort of European balance of power, of which England, as in\r\nWolsey's later dreams, was to be the tongue of the balance. Yet,\r\ndespite his severe schooling in self-control, he undertook more than he\r\ncould accomplish, and his failure was the more signal because he found\r\nthe utmost difficulty in discovering trustworthy subordinates.\r\nMoreover, the limited resources of a medieval state, and the even more\r\nlimited control which a medieval ruler had over these resources, were\r\nfatal obstacles in the way of too ambitious a policy. Edward had\r\ninherited his father's load of debt, and could only accomplish great\r\nthings by further pledging his credit to foreign financiers, against\r\nwhom his subjects raised unending complaints. Yet, if his methods of\r\nattaining his objects were sometimes mean and often violent, there was\r\na rare nobility about his general purpose.\r\n\r\nEvery precaution was taken to secure Edward's succession and the\r\nestablishment of the provisional administration which was to rule until\r\nhis return. Before leaving England in 1270, Edward had appointed as his\r\nagents Walter Giffard, Archbishop of York, Roger Mortimer, and Robert\r\nBurnell, his favourite clerk. The vacancy of the see of Canterbury\r\nafter Boniface's death placed Giffard in a position of peculiar\r\neminence. Appointed first lord of the council, he virtually became\r\nregent; and he associated with himself in the administration of the\r\nrealm his two colleagues in the management of the new king's private\r\naffairs. Early in 1273 a parliament of magnates and representatives of\r\nshires and boroughs took oaths of allegiance to the king and continued\r\nthe authority of the three regents. By the double title of Edward's\r\npersonal delegation and the recognition of the estates, Giffard,\r\nMortimer, and Burnell ruled the country for the two years which were to\r\nelapse before the sovereign's return. Their government was just,\r\neconomical, and peaceful. Even Gilbert of Gloucester remained quiet,\r\nand, save for the refusal of the Prince of Wales to perform his feudal\r\nobligations, the calm of the last years of the old reign continued. It\r\nis evidence of constitutional progress that the administration was\r\ncarried on with so little friction in the absence of the monarch. Roger\r\nMortimer, the most formidable of the feudal baronage, was himself one\r\nof the agents of this salutary change. The marcher chieftain put down\r\nwith promptitude an attempted revolt of north-country knights which\r\nthreatened public tranquillity.\r\n\r\nEdward first heard of his father's death in Sicily, but the tidings of\r\nthe maintenance of peace rendered it unnecessary for him to hasten his\r\nreturn, and he made his way slowly through Italy. In Sicily he was\r\nentertained by his uncle, Charles of Anjou. Thence he went to Orvieto,\r\nwhere the new pope, Gregory X., who, as archdeacon of Liege, had been\r\nthe comrade of his crusade, was then residing. From king and pope alike\r\nEdward earnestly sought vengeance for the murder of Henry of Almaine.\r\nProceeding northwards, he was received with great pomp by the cities of\r\nLombardy, and made personal acquaintance with Savoy and its count,\r\nPhilip, his aged great-uncle. Crossing the Mont Cenis, he was welcomed\r\nby bands of English magnates who had gone forth to meet him. He was\r\nsoon at the head of a little army, and in the true spirit of a hero of\r\nromance halted to receive the challenge of the boastful Count of\r\nChalon. The tournament between the best knights of England and Burgundy\r\nwas fought out with such desperation that it became a serious battle.\r\nAt last Edward unhorsed the count in a personal encounter, which added\r\ngreatly to his fame. This \"Little Battle of Chalon\" was the last\r\nvictory of his irresponsible youth.\r\n\r\nThe serious business of kingcraft began when Edward met his cousin,\r\nPhilip III., at Paris. The news from England was still so good that\r\nEdward resolved to remain in France with the twofold object of settling\r\nhis relations with the French monarchy and of receiving the homage and\r\nregulating the affairs of Aquitaine. Despite the treaty of Paris of\r\n1259, there were so many subjects of dispute between the English and\r\nFrench kings that, beneath the warm protestations of affection between\r\nthe kinsmen, there was, as a French chronicler said, but a cat-and-dog\r\nlove between them.[1] The treaty had not been properly executed, and the\r\nEnglish had long complained that the French had not yielded up to\r\nEngland their king's rights over the three bishoprics of Limoges,\r\nCahors, and Périgueux, which St. Louis had ceded. New complications\r\narose after the death of Alfonse of Poitiers in the course of the\r\nTunisian crusade. By the treaty of Paris the English king should then\r\nhave entered into possession of Saintonge south of the Charente, the\r\nAgenais, and lower Quercy. But the ministers of Philip III. laid hands\r\nupon the whole of Alfonse's inheritance and refused to surrender these\r\ndistricts to the English. The welcome which Edward received from his\r\ncousin at Paris could not blind him to the incompatibility of their\r\ninterests, nor to the impossibility of obtaining at the moment the\r\ncession of the promised lands. He did not choose to tarry at Paris while\r\nthe diplomatists unravelled the tangled web of statecraft. Nor would he\r\ntender an unconditional homage to the prince who withheld from him his\r\ninheritance. Already a stickler for legal rights, even when used to his\r\nown detriment, Edward was unable to deny his subjection to the overlord\r\nof Aquitaine. He therefore performed homage, but he phrased his\r\nsubmission in terms which left him free to urge his claims at a more\r\nconvenient season. \"Lord king,\" he said to Philip, \"I do you homage for\r\nall the lands which I ought to hold of you.\" The vagueness of this\r\nlanguage suggested that, if Edward could not get Saintonge, he might\r\nrevive his claim to Normandy. The king appointed a commission to\r\ncontinue the negotiations with the French court, and then betook himself\r\nto Aquitaine.[2]\r\n\r\n    [1] \"Hic amor dici potest amor cati et canis,\" _Chron. Limov._,\r\n    in _Recueil des Hist. de la France_, xxi., 784.\r\n\r\n    [2] C.V. Langlois' _Le Règne de Philippe le Hardi_ (1887), and\r\n    Gavrilovitch's _Le Traité de Paris_, give the best modern\r\n    accounts of Edward's early dealings with the French crown.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly ten years since the presence of the monarch had\r\nrestrained the turbulence of the Gascon duchy. Edward had before him\r\nthe task of watching over its internal administration, and checking the\r\nsubtle policy whereby the agents of the French crown were gradually\r\nundermining his authority. Two wars, the war of Béarn and the war of\r\nLimoges, desolated Gascony from the Pyrenees to the Vienne. It was\r\nEdward's first task to bring these troubles to an end. Age and\r\nexperience had not diminished the ardour which had so long made Gaston\r\nof Béarn the focus of every trouble in the Pyrenean lands. He defied a\r\nsentence of the ducal court of Saint Sever, and was already at war with\r\nthe seneschal, Luke of Tany, when Edward's appearance brought matters\r\nto a crisis. During the autumn and winter of 1273-74, Edward hunted out\r\nGaston from his mountain strongholds, and at last the Béarnais,\r\ndespairing of open resistance, appealed to the French king. Philip\r\naccepted the appeal, and ordered Edward to desist from molesting Gaston\r\nduring its hearing. The English king, anxious not to quarrel openly\r\nwith the French court, granted a truce. The suit of Gaston long\r\noccupied the parliament of Paris, but the good-will of the French\r\nlawyers could not palliate the wanton violence of the Viscount of\r\nBéarn. The French, like the English, were sticklers for formal right,\r\nand were unwilling to push matters to extremities. Edward had the\r\nreward of his forbearance, for Philip advised Gaston to go to England\r\nand make his submission. Gratified by his restoration to Béarn in 1279,\r\nGaston remained faithful for the next few years. Edward was less\r\nsuccessful in dealing with Limoges. There had been for many years a\r\nstruggle between the commune of the castle, or _bourg_, of Limoges and\r\nMargaret the viscountess. It was to no purpose that the townsfolk had\r\ninvoked the treaty of Paris, whereby, as they maintained, the French\r\nking transferred to the King of England his ancient jurisdiction over\r\nthem. They were answered by a decree of the parliament of Paris that\r\nthe homage of the commune of Limoges belonged not to the crown but to\r\nthe viscountess, and that therefore the treaty involved no change in\r\ntheir allegiance. Edward threw himself with ardour on to the side of\r\nthe burgesses. Guy of Lusignan, still the agent of his brother abroad,\r\nthough prudently excluded from England, was sent to Limoges, where he\r\nincited the commune to resist the viscountess. In May, 1274, Edward\r\nhimself took up his quarters in Limoges, and for a month ruled there as\r\nsovereign. But the French court reiterated the decree which made the\r\ncommune the vassal of the viscountess. To persevere in upholding the\r\nrebels meant an open breach with the French court in circumstances more\r\nunfavourable than in the case of Gaston of Béarn. Once more Edward\r\nrefused to allow his ambition to prevail over his sense of legal\r\nobligation. With rare self-restraint he renounced the fealty of\r\nLimoges, and abandoned his would-be subjects to the wrath of the\r\nviscountess. This was an act of loyalty to feudal duty worthy of St.\r\nLouis. If Edward, on later occasions, pressed his own legal claims\r\nagainst his vassals, he set in his own case a pattern of strict\r\nobedience to his overlord.\r\n\r\nWhile Edward was still abroad, his friend Gregory X. held from May to\r\nJuly, 1274, the second general council at Lyons, wherein there was much\r\ntalk of a new crusade, and an effort was made, which came very near\r\ntemporary success, towards healing the schism of the Eastern and\r\nWestern Churches. At Gregory's request Edward put off his coronation,\r\nlest the celebration might call away English prelates from Lyons. When\r\nthe council was over, he at last turned towards his kingdom. At Paris\r\nhe was met by the mayor of London, Henry le Waleis, and other leading\r\ncitizens, who set before him the grievous results of the long disputes\r\nwith Flanders, which had broken off the commercial relations between\r\nthe two countries, and had inflicted serious losses on English trade.\r\nEdward strove to bring the Flemings to their senses by prohibiting the\r\nexport of wool from England to the weaving towns of Flanders. The looms\r\nof Ghent and Bruges were stopped by reason of the withholding of the\r\nraw material, and the distress of his subjects made Count Guy of\r\nFlanders anxious to end so costly a quarrel. On July 28 Edward met Guy\r\nat Montreuil and signed a treaty which re-established the old\r\nfriendship between lands which stood in constant economic need of each\r\nother. There was no longer any occasion for further delay, and on\r\nAugust 2 Edward and his queen crossed over to Dover. Received with open\r\narms by his subjects, he was crowned at Westminster on August 19 by the\r\nnew Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Kilwardby, philosopher,\r\ntheologian, and Dominican friar, whom Gregory X. had placed over the\r\nchurch of Canterbury, despite the vigorous efforts which Edward made to\r\nsecure the primacy for Robert Burnell. He had been absent from England\r\nfor four years.\r\n\r\nEdward's sojourn in France was fruitful of results which he was unable\r\nto reap for the moment. Conscious of the inveterate hostility of the\r\nFrench king, he strove to establish relations with foreign powers to\r\ncounterbalance the preponderance of his rival. When the death of\r\nRichard of Cornwall reopened the question of the imperial succession,\r\nCharles of Anjou had been anxious to obtain the prize for his nephew,\r\nPhilip III., on the specious pretext that the headship of Christendom\r\nwould enable the King of France to \"collect chivalry from all the\r\nworld\" and institute the crusade which both Gregory X. and Edward so\r\nardently desired. But the most zealous enthusiast for the holy war\r\ncould hardly be deceived by the false zeal with which the Angevin\r\ncloaked his overweening ambition. It was a veritable triumph for\r\nEdward, when Gregory X., though attracted for a moment by the prospect\r\nof a strong emperor capable of landing a crusade, accepted the choice\r\nof the German magnates who, in terror of France, elected as King of the\r\nRomans the strenuous but not overmighty Swabian count, Rudolf of\r\nHapsburg. As Alfonso of Castile's pretensions were purely nominal, this\r\nelection ended the Great Interregnum by restoring the empire on a\r\nnarrower but more practical basis. Though Gregory strove to reconcile\r\nthe French to Rudolf's accession, common suspicion of France bound\r\nEdward and the new King of the Romans in a common friendship.\r\n\r\nFamily disputes soon destroyed the unity of policy of the Capetian\r\nhouse. Philip III., well meaning but weak, was drifting into complete\r\ndependence on Charles of Anjou, whom Edward distrusted, alike as the\r\nprotector of the murderers of Henry of Almaine and as the supplanter of\r\nhis mother in the Provençal heritage. Margaret of Provence, the widow\r\nof St. Louis, had a common grievance with Edward and his mother against\r\nCharles of Anjou. She hated him the more inasmuch as he was depriving\r\nher of all influence over her son, King Philip. It was easy in such\r\ncircumstances for the two widowed queens of France and England to form\r\ngrandiose schemes for ousting Charles from Provence. Rudolf lent\r\nhimself to their plans by investing Margaret with the county. Edward's\r\nfilial piety and political interests made him a willing partner in\r\nthese designs. In 1278 he betrothed his daughter Joan of Acre to\r\nHartmann, the son of the King of the Romans. The plan of Edward and\r\nRudolf was to revive in some fashion the kingdom of Arles[1] in favour\r\nof the young couple. Though Rudolf was unfaithful to this policy, and\r\nabandoned the proposed English marriage in favour of a match between\r\nhis daughter and the son of the King of Sicily, the two queens\r\npersisted in their plans, and new combinations against Charles and\r\nPhilip for some years threatened the peace of Europe.\r\n\r\n    [1] Fournier's _Le Royaume d'Arles et de Vienne_ (1891) gives\r\n    the best modern account of Edward's relations to the Middle\r\n    Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely that Edward hoped for serious results from schemes so\r\nincoherent and backed with such slender resources. Besides his alliance\r\nwith the emperor, he strove to injure the French king by establishing\r\nclose relations with his brother-in-law, Alfonso of Castile, who since\r\n1276 was at war with the French. Earlier than this, he made himself the\r\nchampion of Blanche of Artois, the widow of Henry III. of Navarre and\r\nChampagne. He wished that Joan, their only child, should bring her\r\nfather's lands to one of his own sons, and, though disappointed in this\r\nambition, he managed to marry his younger brother, Edmund of Lancaster,\r\nto Blanche. Though the French took possession of Navarre, whereby they\r\nalike threatened Gascony and Castile, they suffered Blanche to rule in\r\nChampagne in her daughter's name, and Edmund was associated with her in\r\nthe government of that county. The tenure of a great French fief by the\r\nbrother of the English king was a fresh security against the\r\naggressions of the kings of France and Sicily. It probably facilitated\r\nthe conclusion of the long negotiations as to the interpretation of the\r\ntreaty of Paris, and the partition of the inheritance of Alfonse of\r\nPoitiers. Edward's position against France was further strengthened in\r\n1279 by the death of his wife's mother, Joan of Castile, the widow of\r\nFerdinand the Saint and the stepmother of Alfonso the Wise, whereupon\r\nhe took possession of Ponthieu in Eleanor's name. Scarcely had he\r\nestablished himself at Abbeville, the capital of the Picard county,\r\nthan the negotiations at Paris were so far ripened that Philip III.\r\nwent to Amiens, where Edward joined him. On May 23 both kings agreed to\r\naccept the treaty of Amiens by which the more important of the\r\noutstanding difficulties between the two nations were amicably\r\nregulated. By it Philip recognised Eleanor as Countess of Ponthieu, and\r\nhanded over a portion of the inheritance of Alfonse of Poitiers to\r\nEdward. Agen and the Agenais were ceded at once, and a commission was\r\nappointed to investigate Edward's claims over lower Quercy. In return\r\nfor this Edward yielded up his illusory rights over the three\r\nbishoprics of Limoges, Périgueux, and Cahors. It was a real triumph for\r\nEnglish diplomacy.\r\n\r\nNo lasting peace could arise from acts which emphasised the essential\r\nincompatibility of French and English interests by enlarging the\r\nterritory of the English kings in France. The undercurrent of hostility\r\nstill continued; and the proposal of Pope Nicholas III. that Edward\r\nshould act as mediator between Philip III. and Alfonso of Castile led\r\nto difficulties that deeply incensed Edward, and embroiled him once\r\nmore both with France and Spain. Under Angevin influence, both Philip\r\nand Alfonso rejected Edward's mediation in favour of that of the Prince\r\nof Salerno, Charles of Anjou's eldest son. Disgust at this\r\nunfriendliness made Edward again support the plans of Margaret of\r\nProvence against the Angevins. In 1281 Margaret's intrigues formed a\r\ncombination of feudal magnates called the League of Macon, with the\r\nobject of prosecuting her claims over Provence by force of arms. Edward\r\nand his mother, Eleanor, his Savoyard kinsfolk, and Edmund of Lancaster\r\nall entered into the league. But it was hopeless for a disorderly crowd\r\nof lesser chieftains, with the nominal support of a distant prince like\r\nEdward, to conquer Provence in the teeth of the hostility of the\r\nstrongest and the ablest princes of the age. The League of Macon came\r\nto nothing, like so many other ambitious combinations of a time in\r\nwhich men's capacity to form plans transcended their capacity to\r\nexecute them. Margaret herself soon despaired of the way of arms and\r\nwas bought off by a money compensation. The league mainly served to\r\nkeep alive the troubles that still separated England and France. In\r\n1284 Philip gained a new success in winning the hand of Joan of\r\nChampagne, Count Edmund's step-daughter, for his son, the future Philip\r\nthe Fair. When Joan attained her majority, Edmund lost the custody of\r\nChampagne, which went to the King of France as the natural protector of\r\nhis son and his son's bride. With his brother's withdrawal from Provins\r\nto Lancaster, Edward lost one of his means of influencing the course of\r\nFrench politics.\r\n\r\nA compensation for these failures was found in 1282 when the Sicilian\r\nvespers rang the knell of the Angevin power in Sicily. When the\r\nrevolted islanders chose Peter, King of Aragon, as their sovereign,\r\nCharles, seeking to divert him from Sicily by attacking him at home,\r\ninspired his partisan, Pope Martin IV., to preach a crusade against\r\nAragon. It was in vain that Edward strove to mediate between the two\r\nkings.\r\n\r\nThe only response made to his efforts was a fantastic proposal that\r\nthey should fight out their differences in a tournament at Bordeaux\r\nwith him as umpire, but Edward refused to have anything to do with the\r\npseudo-chivalrous venture. At last, in 1285, Philip III. lent himself\r\nto his uncle's purpose so far as to lead a papalist crusade over the\r\nPyrenees. The movement was a failure. Philip lost his army and his life\r\nin Aragon, and his son and successor, Philip IV., at once withdrew from\r\nthe undertaking. In the year of the crusade of Aragon, Charles of\r\nAnjou, Peter of Aragon, and Martin IV. died. With them the struggles,\r\nwhich had begun with the attack on Frederick II, reached their\r\nculminating point. Their successors continued the quarrel with\r\ndiminished forces and less frantic zeal, and so gave Edward his best\r\nchance to pose as the arbiter of Europe. Though Edward's continental\r\npolicy lay so near his heart that it can hardly be passed over, it was\r\nfuller of vain schemes than of great results. Yet it was not altogether\r\nfruitless, since twelve years of resolute and moderate action raised\r\nEngland, which under Henry III. was of no account in European affairs,\r\nto a position only second to that of France, and that under conditions\r\nmore nearly approaching the modern conception of a political balance\r\nand a European state system than feudalism, imperialism, and papalism\r\nhad hitherto rendered possible.\r\n\r\nIn domestic policy, seven years of monotonous administration had in a\r\nway prepared for vigorous reforms. Edward's return to England in 1274\r\nwas quickly followed by the dismissal of Walter of Merton, the\r\nchancellor of the years of quiescence. He was succeeded by Robert\r\nBurnell, who, though foiled in his quest of Canterbury, obtained an\r\nadequate standing by his preferment to the bishopric of Bath and Wells.\r\nFor the eighteen years of life which still remained to him, Bishop\r\nBurnell held the chancery and possessed the chief place in Edward's\r\ncounsels. The whole of this period was marked by a constant legislative\r\nactivity which ceased so soon after Burnell's death that it is tempting\r\nto assign at least as large a part of the law-making of the reign to\r\nthe minister as to the sovereign. A consummate lawyer and diplomatist,\r\nBurnell served Edward faithfully. Nor was his fidelity impaired either\r\nby the laxity which debarred him from higher ecclesiastical preferment\r\nor by his ambitious endeavours to raise the house of Shropshire squires\r\nfrom which he sprang into a great territorial family. Edward gave him\r\nhis absolute confidence and was blind even to his defects.\r\n\r\nThe first general parliament of the reign to which the king summoned\r\nthe commons was held at Westminster in the spring of 1275. Its work was\r\nthe statute of Westminster the First, a comprehensive measure of many\r\narticles which covered almost the whole field of legislation, and is\r\nespecially noteworthy for the care which its compilers took to uphold\r\nsound administration and put down abuses. Not less important was the\r\nprovision of an adequate revenue for the debt-burdened king. The same\r\nparliament made Edward a permanent grant of a custom on wool,\r\nwool-fells, and leather, which remained henceforth a chief source of\r\nthe regular income of the crown. The later imposition of further duties\r\nsoon caused men to describe the customs of 1275 as the \"Great and\r\nAncient Custom\". It was significant of the economic condition of\r\nEngland that the great custom was a tax on exports, not imports, and\r\nthat, with the exception of leather, it was a tax on raw materials.\r\nGranted the more willingly since the main incidence of it was upon the\r\nforeign merchants, who bought up English wool for the looms of Flanders\r\nand Brabant, the custom proved a source of revenue which could easily\r\nbe manipulated, increased, and assigned in advance to the Italian\r\nfinanciers, willing to lend money to a necessitous king. A new step in\r\nour financial history was attained when this tax on trade steps into\r\nthe place so long held by the taxes on land, from which the Normans and\r\nAngevins had derived their enormous revenue.\r\n\r\nThe statute of Westminster the First had a long series of fellows. Next\r\nyear came the statute of Rageman, which supplemented an earlier inquest\r\ninto abuses by instituting a special inquiry in cases of trespass. In\r\n1277 the first Welsh war interrupted the current of legislation. The\r\nbreak was compensated for in 1278 by the passing of the important\r\nstatute of Gloucester, the consummation of a policy which Edward had\r\nadopted as soon as he set foot on English soil. The troubles of Edward's\r\nyouth had made clear to him the obstacles thrown in the path of orderly\r\ngovernment by the great territorial franchises. He had been forced to\r\nmodify his policy to gratify the lord of Glamorgan, and win over the\r\nhouse of Mortimer by the erection of a new franchise that was a\r\npalatinate in all but name. But such great \"regalities\" were, after all,\r\nexceptional. Much more irritating to an orderly mind were the\r\ninnumerable petty immunities which made half the hundreds in England the\r\nappendages of baronial estates, and such common privileges as \"return of\r\nwrits,\" which prevented the sheriff's officers from executing his\r\nmandates on numerous manors where the lords claimed that the execution\r\nof writs must be entrusted to their bailiffs.[1] These widespread powers\r\nin private hands were the more annoying to the king since they were\r\ncommonly exercised with no better warrant than long custom, and without\r\ndirect grant from him.\r\n\r\n    [1] See on \"return of writs\" and a host of similar immunities,\r\n    Pollock and Maitland's _History of English Law_, i., 558-82.\r\n\r\nBracton had already laid down the doctrine that no prescription can\r\navail against the rights of the crown, and it was a commonplace with the\r\nlawyers of the age that nothing less than a clear grant by royal charter\r\ncould justify such delegation of the sovereign's powers into private\r\nhands. Within a few months of his landing, Edward sent out commissioners\r\nto inquire into the baronial immunities. The returns of these inquests,\r\nwhich were carried out hundred by hundred, are embodied in the precious\r\ndocuments called the Hundred Rolls. The study of these reports inspired\r\nthe procedure of the statute of Gloucester, by which royal officers were\r\nempowered to traverse the land demanding by what warrant the lords of\r\nfranchises exercised their powers. The demand of the crown for\r\ndocumentary proof of royal delegation would have destroyed more than\r\nhalf the existing liberties. But aristocratic opinion deserted Edward\r\nwhen he strove to carry out so violent a revolution. The irritation of\r\nthe whole baronage is well expressed in the story of how Earl Warenne,\r\nunsheathing a rusty sword, declared to the commissioners: \"Here is my\r\nwarrant. My ancestors won their lands with the sword. With my sword I\r\nwill defend them against all usurpers.\" Nor was this mere boasting. The\r\nreturn of the king's officers tells us that Warenne would not say of\r\nwhom, or by what services, he held his Yorkshire stronghold of\r\nConisborough, and that his bailiffs refused them entrance into his\r\nliberties and would not suffer his tenants to answer or appear before\r\nthem.[1] Edward found it prudent not to press his claims. He disturbed\r\nfew men in their franchises, and was content to have collected the mass\r\nof evidence embodied in the _placita de quo warranto_, and thus to have\r\nstopped the possibility of any further growth of the franchises. A few\r\nyears later he accepted the compromise that continuous possession since\r\nthe coronation of Richard I. was a sufficient answer to a writ of _quo\r\nwarranto_. In this lies the whole essence of Edward's policy in relation\r\nto feudalism, a policy very similar to that of St. Louis. Every man is\r\nto have his own, and the king is not to inquire too curiously what a\r\nman's own was. But no extension of any private right was to be\r\ntolerated. Thus feudalism as a principle of political jurisdiction\r\ngradually withered away, because it was no longer suffered to take fresh\r\nroot. The later land legislation of Edward's reign pushed the idea still\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Kirkby's Quest for Yorkshire_, pp. 3, 227, 231, Surtees\r\n    Soc.\r\n\r\nIn 1278 it had been the turn of the barons to suffer. Next came the\r\nturn of the Church. Though Edward was a true son of the Church, he saw\r\nas clearly as William the Conqueror and Henry II. the essential\r\nincompatibility between the royal supremacy and the pretensions of the\r\nextreme ecclesiastics. The limits of Church and State, the growth of\r\nclerical wealth and immunities, and the relations of the world-power of\r\nthe pope to the local authority of the king, were problems which no\r\nstrong king could afford to neglect, and perhaps were incapable of\r\nsolution on medieval lines. Edward saw that the most practical way of\r\ndealing with clerical claims was for him to stand in good personal\r\nrelations to the chief dispensers of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. With\r\na pope like Gregory X. it was easy for Edward to be on friendly terms;\r\nbut it was more difficult to feel any cordiality for the dogmatic\r\ncanonists or the furious Guelfic partisans who too often occupied the\r\nchair of St. Peter. Yet Edward was shrewd enough to see that it was\r\nworth while making sacrifices to keep on his side the power which,\r\nalike under Innocent III. and Clement IV., had given valuable\r\nassistance to his grandfather and father in their struggle against\r\ndomestic enemies. Moreover the enormous growth of the system of papal\r\nprovisions had given the papacy the preponderating authority in the\r\nselection of the bishops of the English Church. It was only by yielding\r\nto the popes, whenever it was possible, that Edward could secure the\r\nnomination of his own candidates to the chief ecclesiastical posts in\r\nhis own realm.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier years of his reign Edward was luckier in his relations\r\nto the popes than to his own archbishops. But he found that his power\r\nat Rome broke down just where he wanted to exercise it most. He was\r\ndisgusted to find how little influence he had in the selection of the\r\nArchbishops of Canterbury. Gregory X. sent to Canterbury the Dominican\r\nRobert Kilwardby, the first mendicant to hold high place in the English\r\nChurch. Kilwardby was translated in 1278 to the cardinal bishopric of\r\nPorto, a post of greater dignity but less emolument and power than the\r\nEnglish archbishopric. A cardinal bishop was bound to reside at Rome,\r\nand the real motive for this doubtful promotion was the desire to\r\nremove Kilwardby from England and to send a more active man in his\r\nplace. Edward's indiscreet devotion to Bishop Burnell led him again to\r\npress his friend's claims, but, though he persuaded the monks of Christ\r\nChurch to elect him, Nicholas III. quashed the appointment, and\r\nselected the Franciscan friar, John Peckham, as archbishop. Peckham, a\r\nfamous theologian and physicist, had been a distinguished professor at\r\nParis, Oxford, and Rome. He was high-minded, honourable and zealous, a\r\nsaint as well as a scholar, an enthusiast for Church reform and a\r\nvigorous upholder of the extremest hierarchical pretensions. Fussy,\r\nenergetic, tactless, he was the true type of the academic ecclesiastic,\r\nand alike in his personal qualities and his wonderful grasp of detail,\r\nhe may be compared to Archbishop Laud. Though received by Edward with a\r\nrare magnanimity, Friar John allowed no personal considerations of\r\ngratitude to interpose between him and his duty. Reaching England in\r\nJune, 1279, he presided, within six weeks of his landing, at a\r\nprovincial council at Reading. In this gathering canons were passed\r\nagainst pluralities which frightened every benefice hunter among the\r\nclerks of the royal household. Orders were also issued for the\r\nperiodical denunciation of ecclesiastical penalties against all\r\nviolators of the Great Charter in a fashion that suggested that the\r\nking was an habitual offender against the fundamental laws of his\r\nrealm.\r\n\r\nEdward wrathfully laid the usurpations of the new primate before\r\nparliament, and forced Peckham to withdraw all the canons dealing with\r\nsecular matters, and particularly those which concerned the Great\r\nCharter. The king set up the counter-claims of the State against the\r\npretensions of the Church, and the estates passed the statute of\r\nMortmain of 1279 as the layman's answer to the canons of Reading. Like\r\nmost of Edward's laws the statute of Mortmain was based on earlier\r\nprecedents. The wealth of the Church had long inspired statesmen with\r\nalarm, and a true follower of St. Francis like Peckham was specially\r\nconvinced of the need of reducing the clergy to apostolic poverty. By\r\nthe new law all grants of land to ecclesiastical corporations were\r\nexpressly prohibited, under the penalty of the land being forfeited to\r\nits supreme lord. The statute was not a mere political weapon of the\r\nmoment. It had a wider importance as a step in the development of\r\nEdward's anti-feudal policy, and may be regarded as a counterpart of\r\nthe inquest into franchises, and as a means of protecting the State as\r\nwell as of disciplining the Church. A corporation never died, and never\r\npaid reliefs or wardships. Its property never escheated for want of\r\nheirs, and, as scutages were passing out of fashion, ecclesiastics were\r\nless valuable to the king in times of war than lay lords. The recent\r\nexigencies of the Welsh war had emphasised the need of strengthening\r\nthe military defences of the crown, and the new statute secured this by\r\npreventing the further devolution of lands into the dead hand of the\r\nChurch. But all medieval laws were rather enunciations of an ideal than\r\nmeasures which practical statesmen aimed at carrying out in detail. The\r\nstatute of Mortmain hardly stayed the creation of fresh monasteries and\r\ncolleges, or the further endowment of old ones. All that was necessary\r\nfor the pious founder was to obtain a royal dispensation from the\r\noperation of the statute. There was little need to fear that the new\r\nlaw would stand in the way of the power of the ecclesiastical estate.\r\n\r\nA more distinct challenge to the Church was provoked by a further\r\naggression of Peckham in 1281. In that year the primate summoned a\r\ncouncil at Lambeth, wherein he sought to withdraw from the cognisance of\r\nthe civil courts all suits concerning patronage and the disposition of\r\nthe personal effects of ecclesiastics. To extend the jurisdiction of the\r\n_forum ecclesiasticum_ was the surest way of exciting the hostility of\r\nthe common lawyers and the king. Once more Edward annulled the\r\nproceedings of a council, and once more the submission of Peckham saved\r\nthe land from a conflict which might have assumed the proportions of\r\nBecket's struggle against Henry II. Four years later Edward pressed his\r\nadvantage still further by the royal ordinance of 1285, called\r\n_Circumspecte agatis_, which, though accepting the supremacy of the\r\nChurch courts within their own sphere, narrowly defined the limits of\r\ntheir power in matters involving a temporal element. Again Peckham was\r\nfain to acquiesce. His policy had not only irritated the king, but\r\nalienated his fellow bishops. He visited his province with pertinacity\r\nand minuteness, and he was the less able to stand up against the king as\r\nhe was engaged in violent quarrels with all his own suffragans. The\r\nleader of the bishops in resisting his claims was Thomas of Cantilupe.\r\nRestored to England by the liberal policy of Edward, Montfort's\r\nchancellor after Lewes had been raised to the see of Hereford, where his\r\nsanctity and devotion won him the universal love of his flock. Involved\r\nin costly lawsuits with the litigious primate, Thomas was forced to\r\nleave his diocese to plead his cause before the papal _curia_. He died\r\nin Italy in 1282, and his relics, carried back by his followers to his\r\nown cathedral, won the reputation of working miracles. A demand arose\r\nfor his canonisation, and Edward before his death had secured the\r\nappointment of the papal commission, which, a few years later, added St.\r\nThomas of Hereford to the list of saints.[1] Thus the chancellor of\r\nMontfort obtained the honour of sanctity through the action of the\r\nvictor of Evesham.\r\n\r\n    [1] The _processus canonisationis_ of Cantilupe, printed in the\r\n    Bollandist _Acta Sanctorum_, Oct. 1, 539-705, illustrates many\r\n    aspects of this period.\r\n\r\nThe second Welsh war interrupted both the conflict between Edward and\r\nthe archbishop, and the course of domestic legislation. Yet even in the\r\nmidst of his campaigns Edward issued the statute of Acton Burnell of\r\n1283, which provided a better way of recovering merchants' debts, and\r\nthe statute of Rhuddlan of 1284 for the regulation of the king's\r\nexchequer. The king's full activity as a lawgiver was renewed after the\r\nsettlement of his conquest by the statute of Wales of 1284, and the\r\nlegislation of his early years culminated in the two great acts of\r\n1285, the statute of Westminster the Second, and the statute of\r\nWinchester. That year, which also witnessed the passing of the\r\n_Circumspecte agatis_, stands out as the most fruitful in lawmaking in\r\nthe whole of Edward's reign.\r\n\r\nThe second statute of Westminster, passed in the spring parliament,\r\npartook of the comprehensive character of the first statute of that\r\nname. There were clauses by which, as the Canon of Oseney puts it,\r\n\"Edward revived the ancient laws which had slumbered through the\r\ndisturbance of the realm: some corrupted by abuse he restored to their\r\nproper form: some less evident and apparent he declared: some new ones,\r\nuseful and honourable, he added\". Among the more conspicuous\r\ninnovations of the second statute of Westminster was the famous clause\r\nDe _donis conditionalibus_, which forms a landmark in the law of real\r\nproperty. It facilitated the creation of entailed estates by providing\r\nthat the rights of an heir of an estate, granted upon conditions, were\r\nnot to be barred on account of the alienation of such an estate by its\r\nprevious tenant. Thus arose those estates for life, which in later ages\r\nbecame a special feature of the English land system, and which, by\r\nrestricting the control of the actual possessor of a property over his\r\nland, did much to perpetuate the worst features of medieval\r\nland-holding. It is a modern error to regard the legitimation of\r\nestates in tail as a triumph of reactionary feudalism over the will of\r\nEdward. Apart from the fact that there is not a tittle of contemporary\r\nevidence to justify such a view, it is manifest that the interest of\r\nthe king was in this case exactly the same as that of each individual\r\nlord of a manor. The greater prospect of reversion to the donor, and\r\nthe other features of the system of entails, which commended them to\r\nthe petty baron, were still more attractive to the king, the greatest\r\nproprietor as well as the ultimate landlord of all the realm. Other\r\narticles of the Westminster statute were only less important than the\r\nclause _De donis_, notable among them being the institution of justices\r\nof _nisi prius_, appointed to travel through the shires three times a\r\nyear to hear civil causes. This was part of the simplification and\r\nconcentration of judicial machinery, whereby Edward made tolerable the\r\ncircuit system which under Henry III. had been a prolific source of\r\ngrievances.\r\n\r\nWhile in the statute of Westminster Edward prepared for the future, the\r\ncompanion statute of Winchester, the work of the autumn parliament,\r\nrevived the jurisdiction of the local courts; reformed the ancient\r\nsystem of watch and ward, and brought the ancient system of popular\r\ncourts into harmony with the jurisdiction emanating from the crown,\r\nwhich had gone so far towards superseding it. This measure marks the\r\nculmination of Edward's activity as a lawgiver. During the five next\r\nyears there were no more important statutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF NORTH WALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Shrewsbury of 1267 had not brought enduring peace to\r\nWales and the march. The pacification was in essentials a simple\r\nrecognition of accomplished facts, but, so far as it involved promises\r\nof restitution and future good behaviour, its provisions were barely\r\ncarried out, even in the scanty measure in which any medieval treaty\r\nwas executed. Moreover, the treaty by no means covered the whole ground\r\nof variance between the English and the Welsh. like the treaty of Paris\r\nof 1259, it was as much the starting-point of new difficulties as the\r\nsolution of old ones. Many troublesome questions of detail had been\r\npostponed for later settlement, and no serious effort was made to\r\ngrapple with them. Even during the life of the old king, there had been\r\nwar in the south between the Earl of Gloucester and Llewelyn. However,\r\nthe Welsh prince paid, with fair regularity, the instalments of the\r\nindemnity to which he had been bound, and there was no disposition on\r\nthe part of the English authorities to question the basis of the\r\nsettlement. Even the marchers maintained an unwonted tranquillity. They\r\nhad lost so much during the recent war that they had no great desire to\r\ntake up arms again. Llewelyn himself was the chief obstacle to peace.\r\nThe brilliant success of his arms and diplomacy seems somewhat to have\r\nturned his brain. Visions of a wider authority constantly floated\r\nbefore him. His bards prophesied the expulsion of the Saxon, and he had\r\ndone such great deeds in the first twenty years of his reign, that a\r\nman of more practical temperament might have been forgiven for\r\nindulging in dreams of future success. Three obstacles stood in the way\r\nof the development of his power. These were his vassalage to the\r\nEnglish crown, the hostility of the marcher barons, and the impatience\r\nwith which the minor Welsh chieftains submitted to his authority. For\r\nfive years he impatiently endured these restraints. He then took\r\nadvantage of the absence of the new king to rid himself of them.\r\n\r\nFive days after the accession of Edward I., the lieutenants of the king\r\nreceived the last payment of the indemnity which Llewelyn condescended\r\nto make. Their demand that the Welsh prince should take an oath of\r\nfealty to his new sovereign was answered by evasive delays. Arrears of\r\nthe indemnity accumulated, and the state of the march became more\r\ndisturbed. The regents showed moderation, though one of them, Roger\r\nMortimer, had himself been the greatest sufferer from the treaty of\r\nShrewsbury. In the south, Humphrey Bohun, grandson of the old Earl of\r\nHereford and earl himself in 1275 by his grandfather's death, was\r\nengaged in private war with Llewelyn. In direct defiance of the terms\r\nof 1267, Humphrey strove to maintain himself in the march of Brecon,\r\nwhich had been definitely ceded to Llewelyn. It was to the credit of\r\nthe regents that they refused to countenance this glaring violation of\r\nthe treaty. Meanwhile Llewelyn busied himself with erecting a new\r\nstronghold on the upper Severn, which was a menace alike to the royal\r\ncastle of Montgomery and to his own vassal, Griffith ap Gwenwynwyn, the\r\ntributary lord of Powys. Yet the regents were content to remonstrate,\r\nand to urge on all parties the need of strict adherence to the terms of\r\nthe treaty. The Earl of Warwick was appointed in the spring of 1274 as\r\nhead of a commission, empowered to do justice on all transgressions of\r\nthe peace, and Llewelyn was ordered to meet him at Montgomery Ford. But\r\nLlewelyn was busy at home, where his brother David had joined hands\r\nwith Griffith ap Gwenwynwyn in a plot against him. Llewelyn easily\r\ncrushed the conspiracy; David, after a feeble attempt to maintain\r\nhimself in his own patrimony, took flight to England, and Griffith of\r\nPowys, driven from his dominions, was also obliged to seek the\r\nprotection of Edward. Henceforth Llewelyn ruled directly over Powys as\r\nwell as Gwynedd. His success encouraged him to persevere in defying his\r\noverlord.\r\n\r\nRash as he was, Llewelyn recognised that he was not strong enough to\r\nstand up single-handed against England. Former experience, however,\r\nsuggested that it was an easy matter to make a party with the barons\r\nagainst the crown. But times had changed since the Great Charter and\r\nthe Barons' War; and a policy, which could obtain concessions from John\r\nor Henry III., was powerless against a king who commanded the\r\nallegiance of all his subjects. Yet there was enough friction between\r\nthe new king and his feudatories to make the attempt seem feasible, and\r\nLlewelyn revived the Montfort tradition, by claiming the hand of\r\nEleanor, Earl Simon's daughter, which had been promised to him since\r\n1265. The alarm created by this shows that Edward perceived the danger\r\nthat it might involve. But his policy of conciliation had now restored\r\nto their estates the last of the \"disinherited,\" and, since the murder\r\nof Henry of Almaine, the name of Montfort was no longer one to conjure\r\nwith. The exiled sons of Earl Simon welcomed Llewelyn's advances, and,\r\nin 1275, Eleanor was despatched from France to Wales under the escort\r\nof her clerical brother Amaury. On their way, Eleanor and Amaury were\r\ncaptured by English sailors. Edward detained the lady at the queen's\r\ncourt, and gave some scandal to the stricter clergy by shutting up\r\nAmaury in Corfe castle. He had foiled the Welsh prince's game, but he\r\nhad given him a new grievance.\r\n\r\nDuring these transactions negotiations had been proceeding between the\r\nEnglish court and Llewelyn. In November, 1274, Edward went to\r\nShrewsbury in the hope of receiving the prince, but he was delayed by\r\nillness, and Llewelyn made this an excuse for non-appearance. Next year\r\nthe king journeyed to Chester with the same object, but his mission was\r\nequally fruitless. Summons after summons was despatched to the\r\nrecalcitrant vassal. Llewelyn heeded them no more than requests to pay\r\nup the arrears which he owed the English crown. After two years of\r\nhesitation Edward lost all patience. Irritated to the quick by\r\nLlewelyn's offer to perform homage in a border town on conditions\r\naltogether impossible of acceptance, the king summoned a council of\r\nmagnates for November 12, 1276, and laid the whole case before them. It\r\nwas agreed that the king should go against Llewelyn as a rebel and\r\ndisturber of the peace; and the feudal levies were summoned to meet at\r\nWorcester on June 24, 1277. As a preliminary to the great effort,\r\nWarwick was sent to Chester, Roger Mortimer to Montgomery, and Payne of\r\nChaworth to Carmarthen. All the available marcher forces and every\r\ntrooper of the royal household were despatched to enable them to\r\noperate during the winter and spring. Their movements were brilliantly\r\nsuccessful. On the reappearance of its ancient lord, the middle march\r\nthrew off the yoke of Llewelyn and went back to its obedience to\r\nMortimer. Griffith ap Gwenwynwyn was restored to upper Powys; the sons\r\nof Griffith of Bromfield cast off their allegiance to Llewelyn and were\r\nreceived back as direct vassals of the king. A Tony was once more\r\nruling in Elvael, a Gifford in Llandovery, and a Bohun in Brecon. Rhys\r\nap Meredith yielded up Dynevor, and was content to be recognised as\r\nlord of the humbler stronghold of Drysllwyn. Chaworth's bands conquered\r\nall Cardiganshire. Thus the wider \"principality\" of Llewelyn was\r\nshattered at the first assault, and when the decisive moment came,\r\nLlewelyn was thrown back upon his hereditary clansmen of Gwynedd. Of\r\nall the acquisitions of the treaty of Shrewsbury, the four cantreds\r\nalone still held for their prince.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] On the whole subject of this chapter Mr. J.E. Morris's\r\n    _Welsh Wars of Edward I._ throws a flood of new light,\r\n    especially on the military history, the organisation of the\r\n    Edwardian army, and the political condition of the march.\r\n\r\nWhen the baronial levies mustered at Worcester, the work was already\r\nhalf accomplished. Of the thousand lances that there assembled, small\r\nforces were detached to help Mortimer in mid Wales and to reinforce the\r\nmarcher army in west Wales, which was now commanded by Edmund of\r\nLancaster, the king's brother. The mass of the troops followed Edward\r\nto Chester, whence the main attack was to be made. Edward's plan of\r\noperations was simplicity itself. He knew that the Welsh desired no\r\npitched battle, and he was indisposed to lose his soldiers in\r\nunnecessary conflict. Swarms of workmen cleared a wide road through the\r\ndense forests of the four cantreds. The route chosen was as near as\r\npossible to the coast, where a strong fleet, mainly from the Cinque\r\nPorts, kept up communications with the land forces. The advance was\r\ncautious and slow, with long halts at Flint and at Rhuddlan, where\r\nhastily erected forts secured the king's base and safe-guarded a\r\npossible retreat. By the end of August the king was at Deganwy, and the\r\nfour cantreds were conquered. During all this time fresh forces were\r\nhurried up. Some 15,000 infantry, largely drawn from southern and\r\ncentral Wales, swelled the king's host.\r\n\r\nLlewelyn was closely shut up in the Snowdon country. His position was\r\nsafe enough from a direct assault, and his only fear was want of\r\nprovisions. He trusted, however, that supplies would come in from\r\nAnglesea, whose rich cornfields were yellowing for the harvest. But the\r\nfleet of the Cinque Ports cut off communications between Anglesea and\r\nthe mainland, and ferried over a strong detachment of Edward's troops,\r\nwhich occupied the island. English harvest-men gathered for Edward the\r\ncrops of Welsh corn, and left Llewelyn to face the beginnings of a\r\nmountain-winter without the means of feeding his followers. By\r\nSeptember the real fight was over. Edward withdrew to Rhuddlan and\r\ndismissed the greater part of his followers. Enough were left to block\r\nthe approaches to Snowdon, and Llewelyn, seeing no gain in further\r\ndelay, made his submission on November 9.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Aberconway, which Edward dictated, reduced Llewelyn to\r\nthe position of a petty North Welsh chieftain, which he had held thirty\r\nyears before. He gave up the homage of the greater Welsh magnates, and\r\nresigned all his former conquests. The four cantreds thus passed away\r\nfrom his power, and even Anglesea was only allowed to him for life and\r\nsubject to a yearly tribute. He was compelled to do homage, and ordered\r\nto pay a crushing indemnity, twice as much as the expenses of the war.\r\nBut Edward was in a generous mood. After Llewelyn's personal submission\r\nat Rhuddlan, the king remitted the indemnity and the rent for Anglesea.\r\nIt was a boon to Llewelyn that the treacherous David received his\r\nreward not' in Gwynedd itself but in Duffryn Clwyd and Rhuvoniog, two\r\nof the four cantreds of the Perveddwlad. Llewelyn's humiliation was\r\ncompleted by his enforced attendance at Edward's Christmas court at\r\nWestminster. Next year, however, he received a further sign of royal\r\nfavour. He was allowed to marry Eleanor Montfort, and Edward himself\r\nwas present at their wedding. But on the morning of the ceremony,\r\nLlewelyn was forced to make a promise not to entertain the king's\r\nfugitives and outlaws.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Aberconway left Edward free to revive in the rest of Wales\r\nthe policy which, when originally begun in 1254,[1] had, like a rising\r\nflood, floated Llewelyn into his wider principality. The lords marchers\r\nresumed their ancient limits. Princes like Griffith of Powys and Rhys of\r\nDrysllwyn sank into a position which is indistinguishable from that of\r\ntheir Anglo-Norman neighbours. David, in the vale of Clwyd had no better\r\nprospects. The heirs of lower Powys were put under the guardianship of\r\nRoger Mortimer's younger son, another Roger, who, on the death of his\r\nwards by drowning, received possession of their lands, and henceforth,\r\nas Roger Mortimer of Chirk, became a new marcher baron. Meanwhile Edward\r\nbusied himself with schemes for establishing settled government in the\r\nconquered territories. To a man of his training and temperament, this\r\nmeant the establishment of English law and administration. He could see\r\nno merits in the archaic Welsh customs which regarded all crimes as\r\ncapable of atonement by a money payment, treated a wrecked ship as the\r\nlawful perquisite of the local proprietor, and hardly distinguished\r\nlegitimate from illegitimate children in determining the descent of\r\nproperty. He convinced himself that the land laws of Wales were already\r\nthose of Anglo-Norman feudalism. He subjected the cantreds of Rhos and\r\nEnglefield to the Cheshire county court, and breathed a new life into\r\nthe decayed shire organisation of Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire.\r\nFlint and Rhuddlan dominated the two former, Aberystwyth and Carmarthen\r\nthe latter. Round the king's castles grew up petty boroughs of English\r\ntraders, who would, it was believed, teach the Welsh to love commerce\r\nand peaceful ways.\r\n\r\n    [1] See page 76.\r\n\r\nFor five years all seemed to go well, though underneath the apparent\r\ncalm a storm was gradually gathering. The Welsh of the ceded districts\r\nbitterly resented the imposition of a strange yoke and complained that\r\nthe king had broken his promise to respect their laws. \"Are the Welsh\r\nworse than Jews?\" was their cry, \"and yet the king allows the Jews to\r\nfollow their own laws in England.\" But Edward coldly answered that,\r\nthough it would be a breach of his coronation oath to maintain customs\r\nof Howel the Good, which were contrary to the Decalogue, he was willing\r\nto listen to specific complaints. It was, however, a very difficult\r\nmatter to persuade Edward's bailiffs and agents to carry out his\r\ncommands, and many acts of oppression were wrought for which there was\r\nno redress. Nobles like David and Rhys found their franchises\r\nthreatened by the encroachments of the neighbouring shire-courts.\r\nLesser Welshmen were liable to be robbed and insulted by the workmen\r\nwho were building Edward's castles, or by the soldiers who were\r\ngarrisoning them. At last even the Welsh who had helped Edward to put\r\ndown Llewelyn saw that they had been preparing their own ruin, and\r\nturned to their former enemy for the redress refused them at\r\nWestminster. David himself made common cause with his brother, and the\r\nspirit of resistance spread among the half-hearted Cymry of the south.\r\nEdward's oppression did more than Llewelyn's triumphs to weld together\r\nthe Welsh clans into a single people. A rising was planned in the\r\nstrictest secrecy; and on the eve of Palm Sunday, March 21, 1282, David\r\nswooped down on Hawarden, a weak castle in private hands, and captured\r\nit. Llewelyn promptly crossed the Conway and turned his arms against\r\nthe royal strongholds of Flint and Rhuddlan, which withstood him,\r\nthough he devastated the countryside in every direction. Meanwhile\r\nDavid hurried south and found the local lords in Cardigan and the vale\r\nof Towy already in arms. With their help he captured the castles of the\r\nupper Towy, but lower down the river Rhys remained staunch to the king,\r\nwhereupon David hurried over the hills to Cardiganshire and took\r\nAberystwyth. North and south were in full revolt.\r\n\r\nEdward, taken unawares, prepared to reassert his authority. Certain\r\nfaithful barons were \"affectionately requested\" to serve the king for\r\npay, and a fairly large army was gathered together, though the\r\nscattered character of the rebellion necessitated its acting in small\r\nbands. Meanwhile the military tenants and the Cinque Ports were\r\nsummoned to join in an attack on Llewelyn on the lines of the campaign\r\nof 1277. Edward's task was more difficult than on the previous\r\noccasion. Though Rhuddlan, not Chester as in 1277, had become his\r\nstarting-point against Gwynedd, he dared not advance so long as David\r\nthreatened his left flank from Denbigh, and the rising in the south was\r\nfar more formidable than that of five years before. A considerable part\r\nof the levies had to be despatched to the help of Earl Gilbert of\r\nGloucester, who was charged with the reconquest of the vale of Towy. On\r\nJune 17 as the earl's soldiers were returning, laden with plunder, to\r\ntheir headquarters at Dynevor, they were suddenly attacked by the Welsh\r\nat Llandilo, and were driven back on their base. Gloucester hastily\r\nretreated to Carmarthen. He was superseded by William of Valence, whose\r\nactivity against the Welsh had been quickened by the loss of his son at\r\nLlandilo. Llewelyn then came south, and pressed the English so hard\r\nthat for several weeks nothing of moment was accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe advance against Gwynedd was delayed until the late summer. Edward\r\nstill tarried at Rhuddlan, with a host constantly varying in numbers,\r\nfor his soldiers had long overpassed the period of feudal service.\r\nEvery effort was made to bring fresh troops to the field, and Luke de\r\nTany, seneschal of Gascony, came upon the scene with a small levy of\r\nthe chivalry of Aquitaine. To Tany was assigned the task of conquering\r\nAnglesey, but it was not until September that he was able to occupy the\r\nisland. In the same month a strenuous effort was made to dislodge the\r\nhostile Welsh in the vale of Clwyd; the Earl of Lincoln at last took\r\nDenbigh from David; Reginald Grey, justice of Chester, captured Ruthin,\r\nhigher up the valley, and Earl Warenne seized Bromfield and Yale. Each\r\nnoble fought for his own hand, and Edward was forced to reward their\r\nservices by immediately granting to them their conquests, and thus\r\ncreated a new marcher interest which, later on, stood in the way of an\r\neffective settlement. But things were getting desperate, and it was\r\nwell for Edward that the security of his left flank at last enabled him\r\nto advance to the Conway. Thereupon Llewelyn returned to Snowdon, where\r\nhe was joined by the homeless David. Meanwhile Tany, then master of\r\nAnglesey, opened up communications with the coast of Arvon by a bridge\r\nof boats over the Menai Straits. Winter was already at hand when\r\nLlewelyn and his brother were at last shut up amidst the fastnesses of\r\nSnowdon.\r\n\r\nLate in October Archbishop Peckham appeared on the scene. He had\r\nexcommunicated Llewelyn at the beginning of the war, but was still\r\nanxious to negotiate a peace. Edward did his best to put him off, but\r\nPeckham's importunity extorted from him a short truce, during which the\r\nprimate visited Snowdon, taking with him an offer of an ample estate in\r\nEngland if the prince would surrender his patrimony. Llewelyn furnished\r\nPeckham with long catalogues of grievances. He was quite willing to\r\ngain time by discussing his wrongs.\r\n\r\nEdward's army shared his irritation at Peckham's interference, and,\r\nwhile the archbishop was still in Snowdon, a breach of the truce\r\ndestroyed any hopes of peace. On November 6 Tany led his troops over\r\nthe bridge of boats at low water and marched inland. But his operations\r\nwere ill-planned, and the Welsh came down from the hills and easily put\r\nhim to flight. Meanwhile the tide had risen and the flood cut off\r\naccess to the bridge over the Menai. In their panic the soldiers rushed\r\ninto the water rather than face the enemy. Many leading men were\r\ndrowned, including Tany himself, the author of the treachery. Flushed\r\nwith this success Llewelyn rejected Peckham's terms. In great disgust\r\nthe archbishop went back to England, bitterly denouncing the Welsh. But\r\ndefeat only strengthened the iron resolution of Edward. He issued fresh\r\nsummonses for men and money. Contrary to all precedent, he determined\r\nto continue the campaign through the winter.\r\n\r\nLlewelyn was probably ignorant of the perilous plight into which the\r\nking had fallen. With the approach of bad weather he became afraid that\r\nhe would be starved out in Snowdon. Any risk was better than being\r\ncaught like a rat in a trap, and, fearing lest a cordon should be drawn\r\nround the mountains, he made his way southwards, leaving David in\r\ncommand. His enemy, Roger Mortimer, was just dead, and Mortimer's\r\neldest son Edmund, a youth brought up for the clerical profession, was\r\nnot likely to hold the middle marches with the same strong grasp as his\r\nfather. Thither accordingly Llewelyn made his way, hoping that on his\r\napproach the tribesmen of the upper Wye, over whom he had ruled so\r\nlong, would abandon their English lord for their Cymric chieftain. A\r\nforce gathered round him, and he occupied a strong position on a hill\r\noverlooking the river Yrvon, which flows into the right bank of the\r\nWye, just above Builth. The right bank of the Yrvon was held by the\r\nEnglish of Builth. But the only way over the stream was by Orewyn\r\nbridge, which was held by a detachment of the Welsh. Their position\r\nseemed so secure that, on December 11, Llewelyn left his troops to\r\nconfer with some of the local chieftains. The English were, however,\r\nshown a ford over the river; a band crossed in safety, and, taking the\r\ndefenders of Orewyn bridge in the rear, opened up the passage over it\r\nto their comrades. The English ascended the hill, their mail-clad\r\nsquadrons interlaced with archers, in order that the Welsh infantry\r\nmight be assailed by missiles before they were exposed to the shock of\r\na cavalry charge. In the absence of their leader, the Welsh were a\r\nhelpless mass of sheep, and were easily put to flight. Meanwhile\r\nLlewelyn, hearing the din of battle, hurried back to direct his\r\nfollowers. On the way he was slain by Stephen of Frankton, a Shropshire\r\nveteran of the Barons' War, who fought under the banner of Roger\r\nl'Estrange. The discovery of important papers on the body first told\r\nthe conquerors the rank of their victim.\r\n\r\nThus perished the able and strenuous chief, who had struggled so long\r\nto win for himself in Wales a position similar to that occupied by the\r\nKing of Scots in the north. His death did not end, but it much\r\nsimplified, the struggle. The south and midland districts were entirely\r\nsubdued, and the interest of the war again shifted to the mountains of\r\nSnowdon, where David strove to maintain himself as Prince of Wales. His\r\nbest chance lay in the exhaustion of his enemy, but Edward stuck grimly\r\nto his task. His coffers were exhausted, and his army for the most part\r\nwent home. Yet Edward tarried at Rhuddlan for over six months, dividing\r\nhis energy between watching the Welsh and replenishing his treasure and\r\ntroops. His treasurer, John Kirkby, wandered from shire to shire\r\nsoliciting voluntary contributions. Then in January, 1283, an anomalous\r\nparliament was summoned, consisting mainly of ecclesiastics, knights of\r\nthe shire, and burgesses, and meeting in two divisions, at York and at\r\nNorthampton, according as the members came from the northern or\r\nsouthern ecclesiastical provinces. The grant of a thirtieth so little\r\nsatisfied the king that he laid violent hands on the crusading-tenth,\r\nwhich was deposited in the Temple. Meanwhile the chivalry of Gascony\r\nand Ponthieu were tempted by high wages to supply the void left by the\r\nretirement of the English.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1283 a gallant force from beyond sea, among which figured the\r\nCounts of Armagnac and Bigorre, reached Rhuddlan. After their arrival\r\nthe king took the offensive, crossed the Conway and transferred his\r\nheadquarters to the Cistercian abbey of Aberconway. Fearful once more\r\nof being enclosed in the mountains, David sought a new hiding-place\r\namong the heights of Cader Idris. He shifted his quarters to the castle\r\nof Bere, hidden away in a remote valley sloping down from the mountain\r\nto the sea. The unwearied Edward once more issued summonses for a fresh\r\ncampaign. David was at the extremity of his resources. Before the new\r\narrivals enabled Edward to move, William of Valence marched up from the\r\nsouth, and in April forced Bere to surrender. David fled before the\r\nsiege began; but he was a fugitive without an army, and the campaign\r\nwas reduced to a weary tracking out of the last little bands that still\r\nscorned to surrender. In June David was betrayed by men of his own\r\ntongue, and Edward summoned for Michaelmas at Shrewsbury a parliament\r\nwhose chief business was the trial of David. On October 3 the last\r\nCymric Prince of Wales suffered the ignominious doom of a traitor, a\r\nmurderer, and a blasphemer. The magnates then adjourned to the\r\nchancellor's neighbouring seat of Acton Burnell, where the rejoicings\r\nincident to the king's visit to his friend's new mansion were combined\r\nwith passing the statute of Merchants.\r\n\r\nEdward's love of thoroughness made him linger in Wales to settle the\r\ngovernment of the newly won lands. His first care was to hold Snowdon\r\nwith the ring of fortresses which, in their ruin, still bear abiding\r\nwitness to the solidity of the conqueror's work. Round each castle\r\narose a new town, created as artificially as were the _bastides_ of\r\nAquitaine, within whose walls English traders and settlers were tempted\r\nby high privileges to take up their abodes, and whose strictly military\r\ncharacter was emphasised by the general provision that the constable of\r\nthe castle was to be _ex officio_ the mayor of the municipality. Chief\r\namong these was Aberconway, whose strategic importance Edward\r\nunderstood so fully that he forced the Cistercian monks to take up new\r\nquarters at Maenan, higher up the valley, in order that there might be\r\nroom for the castle and town which were henceforth to guard the\r\nentrance to Snowdon. Equally important was the future capital of\r\nGwynedd, Carnarvon, where on April 25, 1284, a son was born to Edward\r\nand Eleanor, who seventeen years later was to become the first English\r\nPrince of Wales. Elsewhere fortresses of Welsh origin were rebuilt and\r\nenlarged to complete the stone circuit round the mountains. Such were\r\nCriccieth, the key of Lleyn; Dolwyddelen, which dominated the upper\r\nConway; and Harlech and Bere, the two strongholds that curbed the\r\nmountaineers of Merioneth. In the south the same policy was carried\r\nout. Alike in Gwynedd and in the vale of Towy, both in his castle\r\nbuilding and in his town foundations, Edward was simply carrying on the\r\ntraditions of earlier ages, and applying to his new lands those\r\nprinciples of government which, since the Norman Conquest, had become\r\nthe tradition of the marcher lords. Even in his architectural schemes\r\nthere was nothing novel in Edward's policy. Gilbert of Gloucester at\r\nCaerphilly, and Payne of Chaworth at Kidwelly, had already worked out\r\nthe pattern of \"concentric\" defences that were to find their fullest\r\nexpression in the new castles of the principality. In each of these\r\nstrongholds an adequate garrison of highly trained and well-paid troops\r\nkept the Welsh in check.\r\n\r\nThe civil government of the Edwardian conquests was provided for by the\r\nstatute of Wales, issued on Mid-Lent Sunday, 1284, at Rhuddlan,\r\nEdward's usual headquarters. It declared that the land of Wales,\r\nheretofore subject to the crown in feudal right, was entirely\r\ntransferred to the king's dominion. To the whole of the annexed\r\ndistricts the English system of shire government was extended, though\r\nsuch local customs as appealed to Edward's sense of justice were\r\nsuffered to be continued. Gwynedd and its appurtenances were divided\r\ninto the three shires of Anglesey, Carnarvon, and Merioneth, and were\r\ncollectively put under the justice of Snowdon, whose seat was to be at\r\nCarnarvon, where courts of chancery and exchequer for north Wales were\r\nset up. The shires of Cardigan and Carmarthen were re-organised so as\r\nto include the southern districts which had been subject to Llewelyn,\r\nor to the Welsh lords who had fallen with him. These were put under the\r\njustice of west Wales, whose chancery and exchequer were established at\r\nCarmarthen. It is significant that Edward prepared the way for making\r\nthese districts into shires by persuading his brother Edmund, to whom\r\nthey had been granted, to abandon his claims over them in return for\r\nample compensation elsewhere. Without this step the new shires would\r\nonly have been palatinates of the Glamorgan or Pembroke type, and the\r\ncreation of such franchises was directly contrary to Edward's policy.\r\nIt was different in the vale of Clwyd, where it would have been natural\r\nfor Edward to have extended the shire system to the four cantreds.\r\nMilitary exigences had, however, already erected most of these lands\r\ninto new marcher lordships, and Edward was perforce content with the\r\nunion of some fragments of Rhos to the shire of Carnarvon, and with\r\njoining together Englefield and some adjoining districts in the new\r\ncounty of Flint. This arrangement secured the strongholds of Flint and\r\nRhuddlan for the king. But the district was too small to make it worth\r\nwhile to set up a separate organisation for it, and Flintshire was put\r\nunder the justice and courts of Chester, so that it became a dependency\r\nof the neighbouring palatinate.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] For the shires of Walessee my paper on _The Welsh Shires_\r\n    in _Y Cymmrodor_, ix. (1888), 201-26.\r\n\r\nThe lordships of the march were not directly influenced by this\r\nlegislation. They continued to hold their position as franchises until\r\nthe reign of Henry VIII., and under Edward III. were declared by\r\nstatute to be no part of the principality but directly subject to the\r\nEnglish crown. Yet the removal of the pressure of a native principality\r\nprofoundly affected these districts. The policy of definition made its\r\nmark even here. The liberties of each marcher were defined and\r\ncircumscribed, and, while scrupulously respected, were incapable of\r\nfurther extension. The vague jurisdictions of the sheriffs of the\r\nborder shires were cleared up, and if this process involved some\r\nlimitation of the royal authority in districts like Clun and Oswestry,\r\nwhich virtually ceased to be parts of Shropshire, there was a\r\ncompensating advantage in the increased clearness with which the border\r\nline was drawn and the royal authority consolidated. Gradually the\r\nmarcher lordships passed by lapse into the royal hands, and even from\r\nthe beginning there were regions, such as Montgomery and Builth, which\r\nknew no lord but the king. All this was, however, an indirect result of\r\nthe Edwardian conquest. Strictly speaking it was no conquest of all\r\nWales but merely of the principality, the ancient dominions of\r\nLlewelyn, to which most of the crown lands in Wales were joined.\r\n\r\nEcclesiastical settlement followed the political reorganisation.\r\nPeckham was as zealous as Edward in compelling the conquered to follow\r\nthe law-abiding traditions of the king's ancient inheritance. He\r\nlaboured strenuously for the rebuilding of churches, the preservation\r\nand extension of ecclesiastical property, the education of the clergy,\r\nand the extirpation of clerical matrimony and simony. Despite his\r\nunsympathetic attitude, he did good work for the Welsh Church by his\r\nmanful resistance to all attempts of Edward and his subordinates to\r\nencroach upon her liberties. He quaintly thought it would promote the\r\ncivilisation of Wales if the people were forced to \"learn civility\" by\r\nliving in towns and sending their children to school in England. His\r\nassiduous visitation of the Welsh dioceses in 1284 did something to\r\nkindle zeal, and win the Welsh clergy from the idleness wherein, he\r\nbelieved, lay the root of all their shortcomings.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1284 Edward went on an extended progress in Wales. He\r\npassed through the four cantreds into Gwynedd, and thence worked his\r\nway southwards through Cardigan and Carmarthen, ending his tour by\r\nvisits to the marcher lords of the south. He crossed over from\r\nGlamorgan, where he had been entertained by Gilbert of Clare, to\r\nBristol, where he held his Christmas court. Wales was to see no more of\r\nits new ruler for seven years. During that time the principality gave\r\nEdward little trouble, though the marchers, as will be seen, were a\r\nconstant anxiety to him. In 1287, while Edward was in Gascony, the\r\nregent, Edmund of Cornwall, was called upon to deal with a revolt of\r\nRhys, son of Meredith, the loyalist lord of the vale of Towy, who\r\nresented the authority of the justice of Carmarthen over his patrimony.\r\nHis grievances were those of a marcher rather than those of a Welshman.\r\nYet his rising in 1287 was formidable enough to require the raising of\r\na great army for its suppression. The Welsh chieftain could not long\r\nhold out against the odds brought against him, and the confiscation of\r\nhis lands swelled the district directly depending on the sheriff of\r\nCarmarthen. The support of the countryside enabled Rhys to evade his\r\npursuers for nearly three years. At last he was captured, and with the\r\nexecution of the last of the lords of Dynevor, the triumph of Edward\r\nbecame complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE SICILIAN AND THE SCOTTISH ARBITRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward I. had now attained the height of his fame. He had conquered\r\nLlewelyn; he had reformed the administration; he had put himself as a\r\nlawmaker in the same rank as St. Louis or Frederick II.; and he had\r\nrestored England to a leading position in the councils of Europe.\r\nMoreover, he had won a character for justice and fairness which did him\r\neven greater service, since the several deaths of prominent sovereigns\r\nduring 1285 left him almost alone of his generation among princes of a\r\nlesser stature. Of the chief rulers of Europe in the early years of\r\nEdward's reign, Rudolf of Hapsburg alone survived; and the King of the\r\nRomans had little weight outside Germany many. Edward had outlived his\r\nbrother-in-law Alfonso of Castile, his cousin Philip the Bold, his\r\nuncle Charles of Anjou, and Peter of Aragon. But the conflicts, in\r\nwhich these kings had been engaged, were continued by their successors.\r\nAbove all, the contest for Sicily still raged. The successors of Martin\r\nIV., though deprived of the active support of France, would not abandon\r\nthe claims of the captive Charles of Salerno; and James of Aragon,\r\nPeter's second son, maintained himself in Sicily, despite papal\r\ncensures and despite the virtual desertion of his cause by his elder\r\nbrother, Alfonso III., the new king of Aragon. Each side was at a\r\nstandstill, though each side struggled on. The personal hatreds, which\r\nmade it impossible to reconcile the older generation, were dying out,\r\nand the chief obstacle in the way of a settlement was the stubbornness\r\nof the papacy. If any one could reconcile the quarrel, it was the King\r\nof England; and to him Charles' sons and the nobles of his dominions\r\nappealed to procure his release.\r\n\r\nEdward was anxious to proffer his services as a peacemaker, dream of a\r\nEurope, united for the liberation of the holy places, had not been\r\nexpelled from his mind by his schemes for the advancement of his\r\nkingdom. If he could inspire his neighbour kings with something of his\r\nspirit, the crusade might still be possible. Other matters also called\r\nEdward's attention to the continent. He had to do homage to the new\r\nFrench king; he had to press for the execution of the treaty of Amiens,\r\nand his presence was again necessary in Gascony. His realm was in such\r\nprofound peace that he could safely leave it. Accordingly in May, 1286,\r\nhe took ship for France. With him went his wife Eleanor of Castile, his\r\nchancellor Bishop Burnell, and a large number of his nobles. He\r\nentrusted the regency to his cousin, Edmund, Earl of Cornwall, the son\r\nand successor of Earl Richard; and England saw him no more until\r\nAugust, 1289. Edward first made his way to Amiens, where he met the new\r\nKing of France, Philip the Fair. The two kings went together to Paris,\r\nwhere Edward spent two months. There he performed homage for Gascony,\r\nand made a new agreement as to the execution of the treaty of Amiens,\r\nby which he renounced his claims over Quercy for a money payment, and\r\nwas put in possession of Saintonge, south of the Charente. The\r\nsettlement was the easier as for the moment neither king had his\r\nsupreme interest in Gascony. Edward's real business was to make peace\r\nbetween Anjou and Aragon, and Philip IV. showed every desire to help\r\nhim. Before Edward left Paris, he had negotiated a truce between the\r\nKings of France and Aragon. Soon afterwards he went to Bordeaux. He\r\nmade Gascony his headquarters for three years, and strove with all his\r\nmight to convert the truce into a peace.\r\n\r\nGrave obstacles arose, chief among which was the determination of the\r\npapacy to make no terms with the King of Aragon so long as his brother\r\nstill reigned over Sicily. Honorius IV., in approving Edward's\r\npreliminary action, and exhorting him to obtain the liberation of the\r\nPrince of Salerno, carefully guarded himself against recognising the\r\nschismatic Aragonese. Edward himself was no partisan of either side. He\r\nwas heartily anxious for peace and desirous to free his kinsman from\r\nthe rigours of his long imprisonment. His wish for a close alliance\r\nbetween England and Aragon was unacceptable to the partisanship both of\r\nHonorius IV. and his successor Nicholas IV. Papal coldness, however,\r\ndid not turn Edward from his course. In the summer of 1287 he met\r\nAlfonso at Oloron in Béarn, where a treaty was drawn up by which the\r\nAragonese king agreed to release Charles of Salerno on condition that\r\nhe would either, within three years, procure from the pope the\r\nrecognition of James in Sicily, or return to captivity and forfeit\r\nProvence. Besides this, an alliance between England and Aragon was to\r\nbe cemented by the marriage of one of Edward's daughters to Alfonso.\r\nDelighted with the success of his undertaking, Edward, on his return to\r\nBordeaux, again took the cross and prepared to embark on the crusade.\r\n\r\nNicholas IV. interposed between Edward and his vows by denouncing the\r\ntreaty of Oloron.[1] Though well-meaning, he was not strong enough to\r\nshake himself free from partisan traditions, and though honestly anxious\r\nto bring about a crusade, he could not see that he made the holy war\r\nimpossible by interposing obstacles in the way of the one prince who\r\nseriously intended to take the cross. While denouncing Edward's treaty,\r\nNicholas encouraged his crusading zeal by granting him a new\r\necclesiastical tenth for six years, a tax made memorable by the fact\r\nthat it occasioned the stringent valuation of benefices, called the\r\ntaxation of Pope Nicholas, which was the standard clerical rate-book\r\nuntil the reign of Henry VIII. Despite the pope, Edward still persevered\r\nin his mediation, and in October, 1288, a new treaty for Charles'\r\nliberation was signed at Canfranc, in Aragon, which only varied in\r\ndetails from the agreement of 1287. Charles was released, but he\r\nstraightway made his way to Rome, where Nicholas absolved him from his\r\noath and crowned him King of Sicily. Edward was bitterly disappointed.\r\nHe tarried in the south until July, 1289, usefully employed in promoting\r\nthe prosperity of his duchy, crushing conspiracies, furthering the\r\ncommerce of Bordeaux, and founding new _bastides_. At last tidings of\r\ndisorder at home called him back to his kingdom before the purpose of\r\nhis continental sojourn had been accomplished. But he still pressed on\r\nhis thankless task, and in 1291 peace was made at Tarascon, between\r\nAragon and the Roman see, on the hard condition of Alfonso abandoning\r\nhis brother's cause. On Alfonso's death soon afterwards the war was\r\nrenewed, for James then united the Sicilian and Aragonese thrones and\r\nwould not yield up either. It was not until 1295 that Boniface VIII., a\r\nstronger pope than Nicholas, ended the struggle on terms which left the\r\nstubborn Aragonese masters of Sicily.\r\n\r\n    [1] For his policy, see O. Schiff, _Studien zur Geschichte P.\r\n    Nikolaus IV._ (1897).\r\n\r\nThings had not gone well in England during Edward's absence. Edmund of\r\nCornwall had shown vigour in putting down the revolt of Rhys, but he\r\nwas not strong enough to control either the greater barons or the\r\nofficers of the crown. Grave troubles were already brewing in Scotland.\r\nA fierce quarrel between the Earls of Gloucester and Hereford broke out\r\nwith regard to the boundaries of Glamorgan and Brecon, and the private\r\nwar between the two marchers proved more formidable to the peace of the\r\nrealm than the revolt of the Welsh prince. Even more disastrous to the\r\ncountry was the scandalous conduct of the judges and royal officials,\r\nwho profited by the king's absence to pile up fortunes at the expense\r\nof his subjects. The highest judges of the land forged charters,\r\ncondoned homicides, sold judgments, and practised extortion and\r\nviolence. A great cry arose for the king's return. In the Candlemas\r\nparliament of 1289 Earl Gilbert of Gloucester met a request for a\r\ngeneral aid by urging that nothing should be granted until Englishmen\r\nonce more saw the king's face. Alarmed at this threat, Edward returned,\r\nand landed at Dover on August 12, 1289.\r\n\r\nThe whole situation was changed by the king's arrival. Edward met the\r\ninnumerable complaints against his subordinates by dismissing nearly all\r\nthe judges from office, and appointing a special commission to\r\ninvestigate the charges brought against royal officials of every rank.\r\nThomas Weyland, chief justice of the common pleas, anticipated inquiry\r\nby taking sanctuary with the Franciscan friars of Bury St. Edmunds. A\r\nknight and a married man, he had taken subdeacon's orders in early life\r\nand sought to little purpose to be protected by his clergy. His refuge\r\nwas watched by the local sheriffs; finally, he was starved into\r\nsurrender, and suffered to abjure the realm.[1] He fled to France,\r\nwhence he never returned. For some years the commission investigated the\r\noffences of the ministers of the crown. Though much that was irregular\r\nwas proved against them, many charges broke down under inquiry, and, as\r\ntime went on, the official class saw that their interest lay in\r\ncondoning rather than in punishing scandals. Some of the worst\r\noffenders, such as the greedy and corrupt Adam of Stratton, were never\r\nrestored to office;[2] but Hengham, the chief justice of the King's\r\nBench, was soon reinstated. There were not enough good lawyers in\r\nEngland to make it prudent for Edward to dispense with the services of\r\nsuch a man. A rigorous maintenance of a high standard of official\r\nmorality meant getting rid of nearly all the king's ministers, and any\r\nsuccessors would have been inferior in experience and not superior in\r\nhonesty. Edward had to work with such material as he had, and on the\r\nwhole he made the best of it. Scandalous as were the proceedings of his\r\nagents, their iniquities are but trifles as compared with the offences\r\nof the counsellors of Philip the Fair.\r\n\r\n    [1] For the _abjuratio regni_ see A. Réville in the _Revue\r\n    Historique_, 1. (1892), 1-42.\r\n\r\n    [2] For Adam of Stratton see Hall, _Red Book of the Exchequer_,\r\n    iii., cccxv.-cccxxxi. Extracts from the Assize rolls recording\r\n    the proceedings of the special commission will soon be\r\n    published by the Royal Historical Society.\r\n\r\nFear of Edward drove nobles into obedience as well as ministers into\r\nhonesty. Gloucester desisted unwillingly from his attacks on Brecon,\r\nand was constrained to divorce his wife and marry the king's daughter,\r\nJoan of Acre. In becoming the king's son-in-law, he was forced to\r\nsurrender his estates to the crown, receiving them back entailed on the\r\nheirs of the marriage or, in their default, on the heirs of Joan. Thus\r\nthe system of entails made possible by the statute _De donis_ was used\r\nby Edward to strengthen his hold over the most powerful of his\r\nfeudatories and increase the prospect of his estates escheating to the\r\ncrown. Considered in this light, Gilbert's marriage with the king's\r\ndaughter seems less a reward of loyalty than a punishment for\r\nlawlessness. In the same year as this marriage, Edward passed another\r\nlaw directed against the baronage. This was the statute of Westminster\r\nthe Third, called from its opening words, _Quia emptores_. It enacted\r\nthat, when part of an estate was alienated by its lord, the grantee\r\nshould not be permitted to become the subtenant of the grantor, but\r\nshould stand to the ultimate lord of the fief in the same feudal\r\nrelation as the grantor himself. This prohibition of further\r\nsubinfeudation stopped the creation of new manors and prevented the\r\nrivetting of new links in the feudal chain, which were the necessary\r\ncondition of its strength. Though passed at the request of the barons,\r\nit was a measure much more helpful to the king than to his vassals. It\r\nstood to the barons as the statute of Mortmain stood to the Church.\r\n\r\nEdward was bent on showing that he was master, and his new son-in-law\r\nand the Earl of Hereford became the victims of his policy. He forced the\r\nreluctant Gloucester to admit that the pretensions of the lord of\r\nGlamorgan to be the overlord of the bishop of LLandaff and the guardian\r\nof the temporalities of the see during a vacancy were usurpations.\r\nSeeing that his marcher prerogatives were thus rapidly becoming\r\nundermined, Gloucester put the most cherished marcher right to the test\r\nby renewing the private war with the Earl of Hereford which had\r\ndisturbed the realm during Edward's absence. The king issued peremptory\r\norders for the immediate cessation of hostilities. These mandates\r\nHereford obeyed, but Gloucester did not. Resolved that law not force was\r\nhenceforth to settle disputes in the march, Edward summoned a novel\r\ncourt at Ystradvellte, in Brecon, wherein a jury from the neighbouring\r\nshires and liberties was to decide the case between the two earls in the\r\npresence of the chief marchers. Gloucester refused to appear, and the\r\nmarchers declined to take part in the trial, pleading that it was\r\nagainst their liberties. The case was adjourned to give the\r\nrecalcitrants every chance, and after a preliminary report by the\r\njudges, Edward resolved to hear the suit in person. In October, 1291, he\r\npresided at Abergavenny over the court before which the earls were\r\narraigned. They were condemned to imprisonment and forfeiture. Content\r\nwith humbling their pride and annihilating their privileges, Edward\r\nsuffered them to redeem themselves from captivity by the payment of\r\nheavy fines, and before long gave them back their lands. The king's\r\nvictory was so complete that neither of the earls could forgive it. In\r\n1295, Gloucester died, without opportunity of revenge; but Hereford\r\nlived on, brooding over his wrongs, and in later years signally avenged\r\nthe trial at Abergavenny. Meanwhile the conqueror of the principality\r\nhad shown unmistakably that the liberties of the march were an\r\nanachronism, since the marchers had no longer the work of defending\r\nEnglish interests against the Welsh nation.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] Mr. J.E. Morris in chap. vi. of his _Welsh Wars of Edward\r\n    I._ has admirably summarised this suit. See also G.T. Clark's\r\n    _Land of Morgan_.\r\n\r\nAnother measure that followed Edward's home-coming was the expulsion of\r\nthe Jews. Despite constant odium and intermittent persecution, the\r\nJewish financiers who had settled in England after the Norman conquest\r\nsteadily improved their position down to the reign of Henry III. The\r\npersonal dependants of the crown, they were well able to afford to share\r\ntheir gains from usury with their protectors. They lived in luxury,\r\nbuilt stone houses, set up an organisation of their own, and even\r\npurchased lands. Henry III.'s financial embarrassments forced him to\r\nrely upon them, and the alliance of the Jews and the crown stimulated\r\nthe religious bigotry of the popular party to ill-treat the Jews during\r\nthe Barons' War. Stories of Jews murdering Christian children were\r\neagerly believed; and the cult of St. Hugh of Lincoln and St. William of\r\nNorwich,[1] two pretended victims of Hebrew cruelty, testified to the\r\nhatred which Englishmen bore to the race.\r\n\r\n    [1] See for this saint, Thomas of Monmouth, _Life and Miracles\r\n    of St. William of Norwich_, ed. Jessopp and James (1896).\r\n\r\nUnder Edward I. the condition of the Jews became more precarious. The\r\nking hated them alike on religious and economical grounds. He rigorously\r\ninsisted that they should wear a distinctive dress, and at last\r\naltogether prohibited usury. Driven from their chief means of earning\r\ntheir living, the Jews had recourse to clipping and sweating the coin.\r\nIndiscriminate severities did little to abate these evils. Meanwhile\r\nactive missionary efforts were made to win over the Jews to the\r\nChristian faith. They were compelled to listen to long sermons from\r\nmendicant friars, and their obstinacy in adhering to their own creed was\r\ndenounced as a deliberate offence against the light. Peckham shut up\r\ntheir synagogues, and Eleanor of Provence, who had entered a convent,\r\njoined with the archbishop in urging her son to take severe measures\r\nagainst them. There was a similar movement in France, and Edward, during\r\nhis long stay abroad, had expelled the Jews from Aquitaine. In 1290 he\r\napplied the same policy to England, and their exile was so popular an\r\nact that parliament made him a special grant as a thankoffering. But\r\nthough Edward thus drove the Jews to seek new homes beyond sea, he\r\nallowed them to carry their property with them, and punished the\r\nmariners who took advantage of the helplessness of their passengers to\r\nrob and murder them. Though individual Jews were found from time to time\r\nin England during the later middle ages, their official re-establishment\r\nwas only allowed in the seventeenth century.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] For the Jews see J. Jacobs, _Jews in Angevin England_;\r\n    Tovey, _Anglia Judaica_; J.M. Rigg, _Select Pleas of the Jewish\r\n    Exchequer_; and for their exile B.L. Abrahams, _Expulsion of\r\n    the Jews from England in 1290_.\r\n\r\nTwo generations at least before their expulsion, the Jews had been\r\noutrivalled in their financial operations by societies of Italian\r\nbankers, whose admirable organisation and developed system of credit\r\nenabled them to undertake banking operations of a magnitude quite beyond\r\nthe means of the Hebrews. First brought into England as papal agents for\r\nremitting to Rome the spoils of the Church, they found means of evading\r\nthe canonical prohibitions of usury, and became the loanmongers of\r\nprince and subject alike. To the crown the Italians were more useful\r\nthan the Jews had been. The value of the Jews to the monarch had been in\r\nthe special facilities enjoyed by him in taxing them. The utility of the\r\nItalian societies was in their power of advancing sums of money that\r\nenabled the king to embark on enterprises hitherto beyond the limited\r\nresources of the medieval state. The Italians financed all Edward's\r\nenterprises from the crusade of 1270 to his Welsh and Scottish\r\ncampaigns. From them Edward and his son borrowed at various times sums\r\namounting to almost half a million of the money of the time. In return\r\nthe Italians, chief among whom was the Florentine Society of the\r\nFrescobaldi, obtained privileges which made them as deeply hated as ever\r\nthe Hebrews had been.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] See on this subject E.A. Bond's article in _Archæologia_,\r\n    vol. xxviii., pp. 207-326; W.E. Rhodes, _Italian Bankers in\r\n    England under Edward I. and II._ in _Owens Coll. Historical\r\n    Essays_, pp. 137-68; and R.J. Whitwell, _Italian Bankers and\r\n    the English Crown_ in _Transactions of Royal Hist. Soc._, N.S.,\r\n    xvii. (1903), pp. 175-234.\r\n\r\nAmong the troubles which had called Edward back from Gascony was the\r\ncondition of Scotland, where a long period of prosperity had ended with\r\nthe death of Edward's brother-in-law, Alexander III., in 1286. Alexander\r\nIII. attended his brother-in-law's coronation in 1274, and the\r\nirritation excited by his limiting his homage to his English lordships\r\nof Tynedale and Penrith did not cause any great amount of friction. But\r\nthe homage question was only postponed, and at Michaelmas, 1278,\r\nAlexander was constrained to perform unconditionally this unwelcome act.\r\n\"I, Alexander King of Scotland,\" were his words, \"become the liege man\r\nof the lord Edward, King of England, against all men.\" But by carefully\r\nrefraining from specifying for what he became Edward's vassal, Alexander\r\nstill suggested that it was for his English lordships. Edward with equal\r\ncaution declared that he received the homage, \"saving his right and\r\nclaim to the homage of Scotland when he may wish to speak concerning\r\nit\". Both parties were content with mutual protestations. Edward was so\r\nfriendly to Alexander that he allowed him to appoint Robert Bruce, Earl\r\nof Carrick, his proxy in professing fealty, so as to minimise the king's\r\nfeeling of humiliation. The King of Scots went home loaded with\r\npresents, and for the rest of his life his relations with Edward\r\nremained cordial.\r\n\r\nThe closing years of Alexander's reign were overshadowed by domestic\r\nmisfortunes and the prospects of difficulties about the succession. His\r\nwife, Margaret of England, had died in 1275, and was followed to the\r\ntomb by their two sons, Alexander and David. A delicate girl, Margaret,\r\nthen alone represented the direct line of the descendants of William the\r\nLion. Margaret was married, when still young, to Eric, King of Norway,\r\nand died in 1283 in giving birth to her only child, a daughter named\r\nMargaret. No children were born of Alexander's second marriage; and in\r\nMarch, 1286, the king broke his neck, when riding by night along the\r\ncliffs of the coast of Fife. Before his death, however, he persuaded the\r\nmagnates of Scotland to recognise his granddaughter as his successor.\r\nThe Maid of Norway, as Margaret was called, was proclaimed queen, and\r\nthe administration was put into the hands of six guardians, who from\r\n1286 to 1289 carried on the government with fair success. As time went\r\non, the baronage got out of hand and a feud between the rival\r\nsouth-western houses of Balliol and Bruce foreshadowed worse troubles.\r\n\r\nWilliam Eraser, Bishop of St. Andrews, the chief of the regents, visited\r\nEdward in Gascony and urged the necessity of action. The best solution\r\nof all problems was that the young Queen of Scots should be married to\r\nEdward of Carnarvon, a boy a few months her junior. But both the Scots\r\nnobles and the King of Norway were jealous and suspicious, and any\r\nattempt to hurry forward such a proposal would have been fatal to its\r\naccomplishment. However, negotiations were entered into between England,\r\nScotland, and Norway. In 1289 the guardians of Scotland agreed to\r\nnominate representatives to treat on the matter. Edward took up his\r\nquarters at Clarendon, while his agents, conspicuous among whom was\r\nAnthony Bek, Bishop of Durham, negotiated with the envoys of Norway and\r\nScotland. On November 6 the three powers concluded the treaty of\r\nSalisbury, by which they agreed that Margaret should be sent to England\r\nor Scotland before All Saints' Day, 1290, \"free and quit of all contract\r\nof marriage or espousals\". Edward promised that if Margaret came into\r\nhis custody he would, as soon as Scotland was tranquil, hand her over to\r\nthe Scots as \"free and quit\" as when she came to him; and the \"good folk\r\nof Scotland\" engaged that, if they received their queen thus free, they\r\nwould not marry her \"save with the ordinance, will, and counsel of\r\nEdward and with the agreement of the King of Norway\". In March, 1290, a\r\nparliament of Scots magnates met at Brigham, near Kelso, and ratified\r\nthe treaty. Fresh negotiations were begun for the marriage of Edward of\r\nCarnarvon and the Queen of Scots, resulting in the treaty of Brigham of\r\nJuly 18, which Edward confirmed a month later at Northampton. By this\r\nEdward agreed that, in the event of the marriage taking place, the laws\r\nand customs of Scotland should be perpetually maintained. Should\r\nMargaret die without issue, Scotland was to go to its natural heir, and\r\nin any case was to remain \"separate and divided from the realm of\r\nEngland\".\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Brigham was as wise a scheme as could have been devised\r\nfor bringing about the unity of Britain. In the care taken to meet the\r\nnatural scruples of the smaller nation we are reminded of the treaty of\r\nUnion of 1707. But a nearer parallel is to be found in the conditions\r\nunder which the union between France and Brittany was gradually\r\naccomplished after the marriage of Anne of Brittany. In both cases\r\nalike, in France and in England, the stronger party was content with\r\nsecuring the personal union of the two crowns, and strove to reconcile\r\nthe weaker party by providing safeguards against violent or over-rapid\r\namalgamation. It was left for the future to decide whether the habit of\r\nco-operation, continued for generations, might not ultimately involve a\r\nmore organic union. Unluckily for this island, the policy which\r\nultimately made the stubborn Celts of Brittany content with union with\r\nFrance, never had a chance of being carried out here. Edward made every\r\npreparation for bringing over the Maid of Norway to her kingdom and her\r\nhusband, and neither the Scots nor the Norwegians grudged his leading\r\nshare in accomplishing their common wishes. But the child's health gave\r\nway before the hardships of the journey. Before All Saints' day had come\r\nround, she died in one of the Orkneys, where the ship which conveyed her\r\nhad put in.\r\n\r\nThe death of the queen threatened Scotland with revolution. The regents'\r\ncommission became of doubtful legality, and a swarm of claimants for the\r\nvacant throne arose, whose resources, if not their rights, were\r\nsufficiently evenly balanced to make civil strife inevitable. Since\r\nsouthern Scotland had become a wholly feudal, largely Norman, and partly\r\nEnglish state, there had been no grave difficulties with regard to the\r\nsuccession. Now that they arose, there was doubt as to the principles on\r\nwhich claims to the throne should be settled. There was no legitimate\r\nrepresentative left of the stock of William the Lion. The male line of\r\nhis brother David, Earl of Huntingdon, had died out with John the Scot,\r\nthe last independent Earl of Chester. The nearest claimants to the\r\nsuccession were therefore to be found in the descendants of David's\r\nthree daughters. But there was no certainty that any rights could be\r\ntransmitted through the female line. Moreover there was a doubt whether,\r\nallowing that a woman could transmit the right to rule, the succession\r\nshould proceed according to primogeniture or in accordance with the\r\nnearness of the claimant to the source of his claim. If the former view\r\nwere held then John of Balliol, lord of Barnard castle in Durham and of\r\nGalloway in Scotland, had the best right as the grandson of Earl David's\r\neldest daughter. Yet less than a century before, the passing over of\r\nArthur of Brittany in favour of his uncle John, had recalled to men's\r\nmind the ancient doctrine that a younger son is nearer to the parent\r\nstock than a grandson sprung from his elder brother; and if the view,\r\nthen expressed in the _History of William the Marshal_,[1] was still to\r\nhold good, Robert Bruce, lord of Skelton in Yorkshire, and of Annandale\r\nin the northern kingdom, was the nearest in blood to David of Huntingdon\r\nas the son of his second daughter. Beyond this there was the further\r\nquestion of the divisibility of the kingdom. So fully was southern\r\nScotland feudalised that it seemed arguable that the monarchy, or at\r\nleast its demesne lands, might be divided among all the representatives\r\nof the coheiresses, after the fashion in which the Huntingdon estates\r\nhad been allotted to all the representatives of Earl David. In that case\r\nJohn of Hastings, lord of Abergavenny, put in a claim as the grandson of\r\nEarl David's youngest daughter.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Hist. de Guillaume le Maréchal_, ii., _64_, II. 11899-902.\r\n\r\n        Oil, sire, quer c'est raison\r\n        Quer plus près est sanz achaison\r\n        Le filz de la terre son père\r\n        Que le niês: dreiz est qu'il i père.\r\n\r\nWhen so much was uncertain, every noble who boasted any connexion with\r\nthe royal house safeguarded his interests, or advertised his pedigree,\r\nby enrolling himself among the claimants. Five or six of the competitors\r\nhad no better ground of right than descent from bastards of the royal\r\nhouse, especially from the numerous illegitimate offspring of William\r\nthe Lion. The others went back to more remote ancestors. A foreign\r\nprince, Florence, Count of Holland, demanded the succession as a\r\ndescendant of a sister of Earl David, declaring that David had forfeited\r\nhis rights by rebellion. John Comyn, lord of Badenoch, brought forward\r\nhis descent from Donaldbane, brother of Malcolm Canmore. One claim reads\r\nlike a fairy tale, with stories of an unknown king dying, leaving a son\r\nto be murdered by a wicked uncle, and a daughter to escape to obscurity\r\nin Ireland, where she married and transmitted her rights to her\r\nchildren. There was no authority in Scotland strong enough to decide\r\nthese claims. Once more Robert Bruce raised the standard of disorder,\r\nand the appeal of Bishop Fraser to Edward to undertake the settlement of\r\nthe question showed that the English king's mediation was the readiest\r\nway of restoring order.\r\n\r\nIn 1291 Edward summoned the magnates of both realms, along with certain\r\npopular representatives, to meet at Norham, Bishop Bek's border castle\r\non the Tweed. Trained civilians and canonists also attended, while\r\nabbeys and churches contributed extracts from chronicles, carefully\r\ncompiled by royal order, with a view of illustrating the king's claims.\r\nOn May 10 Edward met the assembly in Norham parish church. Roger\r\nBrabazon, the chief justice, declared in the French tongue that Edward\r\nwas prepared to do justice to the claimants as \"superior and direct lord\r\nof Scotland\". Before, however, he could act, his master required that\r\nhis overlordship should be recognised by the Scots. It is likely that\r\nthis demand was not unexpected. Even in the treaty of Brigham Edward had\r\nbeen careful not to withdraw his claim of superiority, and his action\r\nwith relation to Alexander III.'s homage was well known. But the\r\nsensitiveness which their late king had shown in the face of Edward's\r\nearlier claims was shared by the Scots lords, and shrinking from\r\nrecognising facts which they ought to have faced before they solicited\r\nhis intervention, they begged for delay and drew up remonstrances.\r\nEdward granted them, a respite for three weeks, though he swore by St.\r\nEdward that he would rather die than diminish the rights due to the\r\nConfessor's crown. He had already summoned the northern levies, and was\r\nprepared to enforce his claim by force. His uncompromising attitude put\r\nthe Scots in an awkward position. But they had gone to Norham to get his\r\nhelp, and they were not prepared to run the risk of an English invasion\r\nas well as civil war. Most of the claimants had as many interests in\r\nEngland as in Scotland, and a breach with Edward would involve the\r\nforfeiture of their southern lands as well as the loss of a possible\r\nkingdom in the north. When the magnates reassembled, the competitors set\r\nthe example of acknowledging Edward as overlord. Fresh demands followed\r\ntheir submission, and were at once conceded. Edward was to have seisin\r\nof Scotland and its royal castles, though he pledged himself to return\r\nboth land and fortresses to him who should be chosen king.\r\n\r\nEdward then undertook the examination of the suit. He delegated the\r\nhearing of the claims to a commission, of whom the great majority,\r\neighty, were Scotsmen, nominated in equal numbers by Bruce and Balliol,\r\nthe two senior competitors, while the remaining twenty-four consisted of\r\nEnglishmen, and included many of Edward's wisest counsellors. In\r\ndeference to Scottish feeling, Edward ordered the court to meet on\r\nScottish territory, at Berwick, and appointed August 2 for the opening\r\nday. Meanwhile the full consequences of the Scottish submission were\r\ncarried out. On Edward's taking seisin of Scotland, the regency came to\r\nan end. The nomination of the provisional government resting with\r\nEdward, he reappointed the former regents, and allowed the Scots barons\r\nto elect their chancellor. But with the regents Edward associated a\r\nnorthern baron, Brian Fitzalan of Bedale, and the Scottish bishop, who\r\nwas appointed chancellor, had to act jointly with one of Edward's\r\nclerks. Edward then made a short progress, reaching as far as Stirling\r\nand St. Andrews. He was back at Berwick for the meeting of the\r\ncommissioners on August 2.\r\n\r\nThe first session of the court was a brief one. The twelve competitors\r\nput in their claims, and Bruce and Balliol supported theirs by argument.\r\nHowever, on August 12, the trial was adjourned for nearly a year, until\r\nJune 2, 1292. On its resumption in Edward's presence, the more difficult\r\nissues were carefully worked out. A new and fantastic claim, sent in by\r\nEric of Norway, as the nearest of kin to his daughter, did not delay\r\nmatters. The judges were instructed to settle in the first instance the\r\nrelative claims of Bruce and Balliol, and also to decide by what law\r\nthese should be determined. On October 14, they declared their first\r\njudgment. They rejected Bruce's plea that the decision should follow the\r\n\"natural law by which kings rule,\" and accepted Balliol's contention\r\nthat they should follow the laws of England and Scotland. They further\r\nlaid down that the law of succession to the throne was that of other\r\nearldoms and dignities. They pronounced in favour of primogeniture as\r\nagainst proximity of blood.\r\n\r\nThese decisions practically settled the case, but a further adjournment\r\nwas resolved upon, and upon the reassembling of the court on November 6\r\nthe only question still open, that of whether the kingdom could be\r\ndivided, was taken up. John of Hastings came on the scene with the\r\ncontention that the monarchy should be divided among the representatives\r\nof Earl David's daughters. Bruce had the effrontery to associate himself\r\nwith Hastings' demand. A short adjournment was arranged to settle this\r\nissue, and on November 17 the final scene took place in the hall of\r\nBerwick castle. Besides the commissioners, the king was there in full\r\nparliament, and eleven claimants, who still persevered, were present or\r\nrepresented by proxy. Nine of these were severally told that they would\r\nobtain nothing by their petitions. Bruce was informed that his claim to\r\nthe whole was incompatible with his present claim for a third. It was\r\nlaid down that the kingdom of Scotland was indivisible, and that the\r\nright of Balliol had been established.\r\n\r\nThe seal of the regency was broken: Edward handed over the seisin of\r\nScotland to John Balliol, who three days later took the oath of fealty\r\nas King of Scots, promising that he would perform all the service due to\r\nEdward from his kingdom, Balliol hurried to his kingdom, and was crowned\r\nat Scone on St. Andrew's day. He then returned to England, and kept\r\nChristmas with his overlord at Newcastle, where, on December 26, he did\r\nhomage to Edward in the castle hall. But within a few days a difficulty\r\narose. John resented Edward's retaining the jurisdiction over a law-suit\r\nin which a Berwick merchant, a Scotsman, was a party. He was reassured\r\nby Edward that he only did so, because the case had arisen during the\r\nvacancy, when Edward was admittedly ruling Scotland. But Edward\r\nsignificantly added a reservation of his right of hearing appeals, even\r\nin England; and when the King of Scots went back to his realm, early in\r\nJanuary, he must have already foreseen that there was trouble to come.\r\n\r\nEdward never lost sight of his own interests, and it is clear that he\r\ntook full advantage of the needs of the Scots to establish a close\r\nsupremacy over the northern kingdom. Making allowance for this sinister\r\nelement, his general policy in dealing with the great suit had been\r\nsingularly prudent and correct. He was anxious to ascertain the right\r\nheir; he gave the Scots a preponderating voice in the tribunal; he\r\nrejected the temptation which Bruce and Hastings dangled before him of\r\nsplitting up the realm into three parts, and he restored the land and\r\nits castles as soon as the suit was settled. There is nothing to show\r\nthat up to this point his action had produced any resentment in\r\nScotland, and little evidence that there was any strong national feeling\r\ninvolved. Scottish chroniclers, who wrote after the war of independence,\r\nhave given a colour to Edward's policy which contemporary evidence does\r\nnot justify. From the point of his generation, his action was just and\r\nlegal. He had, in fact, performed a signal service to Scotland in\r\nvindicating its unity; and by maintaining the rigid doctrines of\r\nAnglo-Norman jurisprudence, he rescued it from the vague philosophy\r\nwhich Bruce called natural law, and the recrudescence of Celtic custom\r\nthat gave even bastards a hope of the succession. The real temptation\r\ncame when, after his triumph, Edward sought to extract from the\r\nsubmission of the Scots consequences which had no warranty in custom,\r\nand made Scottish resistance inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe expulsion of the Jews, the reform of the administration, the statute\r\n_Quia emptores_, the treaty of Tarascon, the humiliation of Gloucester,\r\nand the successful issue of the Scottish arbitration, mark the\r\nculminating point in the reign of Edward I. The king had ruled twenty\r\nyears with almost uniform success, and his only serious disappointment\r\nhad been the failure of the crusade. The last hope of the Latin East\r\nfaded when, in 1291, Acre, so long the bulwark of the crusaders against\r\nthe Turks, opened its gates to the infidel. With the fall of Acre went\r\nthe last chance of the holy war. Before long the peace of Europe, which\r\nEdward thought that he had established, was once more rudely disturbed.\r\nDifficulties soon arose with Scotland, with France, with the Church, and\r\nwith the barons. These troubles bore the more severely on the king\r\nbecause this period saw also the removal of nearly all of those in whom\r\nhe had placed special trust. The gracious Eleanor of Castile died in\r\n1290, at Harby, in Nottinghamshire, near Lincoln,[1] and the devotion of\r\nthe king to the partner of his youth found a striking expression in the\r\nsculptured crosses, which marked the successive resting-places of her\r\ncorpse on its last journey from Harby to Westminster Abbey. A few months\r\nlater Edward's mother, Eleanor of Castile, ended her long life in the\r\nconvent of Amesbury, in Wiltshire. The ministers of Edward's early reign\r\nwere also removed by death. Bishop Kirkby, the treasurer, died in 1290,\r\nand Burnell, the chancellor, in 1292, soon after he had performed his\r\nlast public act in the declaration of the king's judgment as to the\r\nScottish succession. Archbishop Peckham died in the same year. New\r\ndomestic ties were formed, and fresh ministers were found, but the\r\nageing king became more and more lonely, as he was compelled to rely\r\nupon a younger and a less faithful generation. Of his old comrades the\r\nchief remaining was Henry Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, while the removal of\r\nBurnell brought forward to the first rank prelates whose position had\r\nhitherto been somewhat obscured by his predominance. Prominent among\r\nthese were the brothers Thomas Bek, Bishop of St. David's, and Anthony\r\nBek, Bishop of Durham, members of a conspicuous Lincolnshire baronial\r\nfamily. Both of these for a time strikingly combined devotion to the\r\nroyal service with loyalty to those clerical and aristocratic traditions\r\nwhich, strictly interpreted, were almost incompatible with faithful\r\nservice to a secular monarch. Even more important henceforth was the\r\nking's treasurer, Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield, the most trusted\r\nminister of Edward's later life, a faithful but not too scrupulous\r\nprelate of the ministerial type, who stood to the second half of the\r\nreign in almost the same close relation as that in which Burnell stood\r\nto the years which we have now traversed.\r\n\r\n    [1] See for this W.H. Stevenson, _Death of Eleanor of Castile_,\r\n    in _English Hist. Review_, iii. (1888), pp. 315-318.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH AND SCOTTISH WARS AND THE CONFIRMATION OF THE CHARTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTroubles arose between France and England soon after Edward had settled\r\nthe Scottish succession. Neither Edward nor Philip the Fair sought a\r\nconflict. Edward was satisfied with his diplomatic successes, and\r\nPhilip's designs upon Gascony were better pursued by chicane than by\r\nwarfare. But questions arose of a different kind from the disputes as to\r\nfeudal right, which had been hitherto the principal matters in debate\r\nbetween the two crowns.\r\n\r\nThere had long been keen commercial rivalry between the Cinque Ports and\r\nthe traders of Normandy. The sailors of Bayonne and other Gascon\r\nharbours had associated themselves with the English against the Normans,\r\nand both sides loudly complained to their respective rulers of the\r\npiracies and homicides committed by their enemies. Edward and Philip did\r\nwhat they could to smooth over matters, but were alike unable to prevent\r\ntheir subjects flying at each other's throats. The story spread that a\r\nNorman ship was to be seen in the Channel with' English sailors and dogs\r\nhanging suspended from her yard-arms: \"And so,\" says Hemingburgh, \"they\r\nsailed over the sea, making no difference between a dog and an\r\nEnglishman\". Indignation at this outrage drove the English to act\r\ntogether in large organised squadrons. The French adopted the same\r\ntactics, and a collision soon ensued. On May 15, 1293, an Anglo-Gascon\r\nmerchant fleet encountered a Norman fleet off Saint Mahe in Brittany. A\r\npitched battle, probably prearranged, at once ensued. It ended in a\r\ncomplete victory for the less numerous English squadron, which\r\nimmediately returned to Portsmouth, laden with booty.\r\n\r\nEven after this, Edward strove to keep the peace, and endeavoured to\r\nexact compensation from his subjects. They answered with a highly\r\ncoloured narrative of the dispute which threw the whole blame upon the\r\nNormans. Philip, changing his policy, took up his subjects' cause, and\r\nsummoned Edward to answer in January, 1294, before the Parliament of\r\nParis for the piracy exercised by his mariners, the misdeeds of his\r\nGascon subjects, and the violent measures taken by his officers against\r\nany who appealed to the court of Paris. Edward sent his brother, Edmund,\r\nto reply for him. As Count of Champagne and the step-father of Philip's\r\nwife, Joan, Edmund seemed a peculiarly acceptable negotiator. After long\r\ndebates, the personal intervention of the French queen, and Philip's\r\nstep-mother, Mary of Brabant, resulted in an agreement being arranged.\r\nThe overlord's grievances could not be denied, and it was urged that the\r\nformal surrender of part of Gascony might be made by way of recognising\r\nthem. French garrisons were therefore to be admitted into six Gascon\r\nstrongholds; twenty Gascon hostages were to be delivered over to Philip,\r\nwhile the seisin of the duchy was also to be transferred to the French\r\nking, who pledged himself not to change the officials nor to occupy the\r\nland in force. The whole business was in fact to be as formal as the\r\ndelivery of the seisin of Scotland to Edward during the suit for the\r\nsuccession. Meanwhile, Edward and Philip were to arrange a meeting at\r\nAmiens to settle the conditions of a permanent peace, by which Edward\r\nwas to take Philip's sister, Margaret, as his second wife, and the\r\nGascon duchy was to be settled upon the offspring of the union. That\r\nEdward or Edmund should ever have contemplated such terms is a strong\r\nproof of their zeal for peace. It soon became clear that Edmund had been\r\noutrageously duped, and that the whole negotiation was a trick to secure\r\nfor Philip the permanent possession of Gascony. The constable of France\r\nappeared on the Aquitanian frontier. The English seneschal surrendered\r\nthe six castles and the seisin of the land. Gradually the French king\r\nbegan to take actual possession of the government. Moreover, after three\r\nmonths, the proceedings against Edward in the parliament of Paris were\r\nresumed; Edward was declared contumacious on the ground of his\r\nnon-appearance, and sentence of forfeiture was passed.\r\n\r\nPhilip's treachery was thus manifest? and in great disgust Edmund\r\nwithdrew from France. Edward was deeply indignant. In a parliament, held\r\nin June, 1294, which was attended by the King of Scots, war was resolved\r\nupon. The feudal tenants were summoned to assemble at Portsmouth on\r\nSeptember 1; and Edward appealed for help to his Gascon subjects,\r\nbeseeching their pardon for having negotiated the fatal treaty, and\r\npromising a speedy effort to restore them to his obedience. He sent them\r\nhis nephew, John of Brittany, as his lieutenant and captain-general,\r\nunder whom John of St. John was to act as seneschal of Gascony.\r\nAmbassadors were despatched to all neighbouring courts to build up a\r\ncoalition against the French. Strenuous efforts were made to get\r\ntogether men and money, and the clergy were forced to make a grant of a\r\nhalf of their spiritual income. Edward overbore their opposition amidst\r\na scene of excitement in which the Dean of St. Paul's fell dead at the\r\nking's feet. The shires were mulcted of a tenth and the boroughs of a\r\nsixth. And besides these constitutional exactions, the king laid violent\r\nhands on all the coined money deposited in the treasuries of the\r\nchurches, and appropriated the wool of the merchants, which he only\r\nrestored on the payment of a heavy pecuniary redemption. Meanwhile,\r\nabout Michaelmas the lieutenant and the seneschal sailed with a fairly\r\nstrong force. Further levies were summoned to assemble at Portsmouth at\r\nlater dates. Besides the ordinary tenants of the crown, writs were sent\r\nto the chief magnates of Ireland and Scotland; and Wales and its march\r\nwere called upon to furnish all the men that could be mustered. The\r\nEarls of Cornwall and Lincoln were appointed to the command, and Edward\r\nhimself proposed to follow them to Gascony as soon as he could.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of the departure of John of Brittany a sudden insurrection\r\nin Wales frustrated Edward's plans. All Wales was ripe for revolt. In\r\nthe principality the Cymry resented English rule, and the sulky marchers\r\nstood aloof in sullen discontent, while their native tenants, seeing in\r\nthe recent humiliation of Gloucester and Hereford the degradation of all\r\ntheir lords, lost respect for such powerless masters. Both in the\r\nprincipality and in the marches, Edward's demand for compulsory service\r\nin Gascony was universally regarded as a new aggression. The intensity\r\nof the resistance to his demand can be measured by the general nature of\r\nthe insurrection, and by the admirable way in which it was organised. As\r\nby a common signal all Wales rose at Michaelmas, 1294. One Madog,\r\nprobably a bastard son of Llewelyn, son of Griffith, raised all Gwynedd,\r\ntook possession of Carnarvon castle, and closely besieged the other\r\nroyal strongholds. In west Wales a chieftain named Maelgwn was equally\r\nsuccessful in Carmarthen and Cardigan. The marches were in arms equally\r\nwith the principality. In the north, Lincoln's tenants in Rhos and\r\nRhuvoniog besieged Denbigh, and threatened the king's fortresses in\r\nFlint. Maelgwn's sphere of operations included the earldom of Pembroke,\r\nwhile Brecon rose against Hereford, and Glamorgan against Gilbert of\r\nGloucester. Morgan, the leader of the Glamorganshire rebels, loudly\r\ndeclared that he did not rebel against the king but against the Earl of\r\nGloucester. With the beginning of winter the state of Wales was more\r\ncritical than in the worst times of the winter of 1282.\r\n\r\nEdward postponed his attack on Philip in order to throw all his energies\r\ninto the reduction of Wales. The levies assembled at Portsmouth for the\r\nGascon expedition were hurried beyond the Severn. The king held another\r\nparliament and exacted a fresh supply. Criminals were offered pardon and\r\ngood wages, if they would serve, first in Wales and then in Gascony.\r\nBefore Christmas about a thousand men-at-arms were mustered at various\r\nborder centres under the royal standards, while every marcher lord was\r\nbusily engaged in putting down his own rebels. Before so great a force\r\nthe Welsh could do but little, and the spring saw the extinction of the\r\nrebellion. But there was hard fighting both in the south and in the\r\nnorth. Edward himself undertook the reconquest of Gwynedd. He was at\r\nConway before the end of the year, and in his haste he threw himself\r\ninto the town while the mass of his army remained on the right bank of\r\nthe river. High tides and winter floods made the crossing of the stream\r\nimpossible, and for a short time the king was actually besieged by the\r\nrebels. Conway was unprepared for resistance and almost destitute of\r\nsupplies. The garrison thought it a terrible hardship that they had to\r\nlive on salt meat and bread, and to drink water mixed with honey. They\r\nwere encouraged by Edward refusing to taste better fare than his\r\ntroopers, and declining to partake of the one small measure of wine\r\nreserved for his use. William Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, conveyed his\r\ntroops across the estuary and raised the siege. Yet the insurgents were\r\nstill able to fight a pitched battle. About January 22, 1295, Warwick\r\nfound the Welsh established in a strong position in a plain between two\r\nwoods. They had fixed the butts of their lances into the ground, hoping\r\nthus to resist the shock of a cavalry charge. Improving on the tactics\r\nof Orewyn bridge, the earl stationed between his squadrons of knights,\r\narchers and crossbowmen, whose missiles inflicted such loss on the Welsh\r\nlines that the cavalry soon found it safe to charge. The Welsh were\r\nutterly broken, and never in a single day did they suffer such enormous\r\nlosses. Even more important than its results in breaking the back of\r\nMadog's insurrection, this battle of Maes Madog--or Madog's field, as\r\nthe Welsh called the place of their defeat--is of the highest importance\r\nin the development of infantry tactics. The order of the victorious\r\nforce strikingly anticipates the great battles in Scotland and France of\r\na later generation. In obscure fights, like Orewyn bridge and Maes\r\nMadog, the English learnt the famous battle array which was to overwhelm\r\nthe Scots in the later years of Edward's reign and prepare the way for\r\nthe triumphs of Crecy and Poitiers.\r\n\r\nMadog still held out, and with the advent of spring, 1295, Edward began\r\nto hunt him from his lairs. Gwynedd was cleared of the enemy and\r\nAnglesey was reconquered. Carnarvon castle arose from its ruins in the\r\nstately form that we still know, while on the Anglesey side of the Menai\r\nthe new stronghold of Beaumaris arose, to ensure the subjection of the\r\ngranary of Gwynedd. In May Edward felt strong enough to undertake a\r\nprogress in South Wales. After receiving the submissions of the rebels\r\nof Cardigan and Carmarthen, he won back for the lords of Brecon and\r\nGlamorgan the lands which, without his help, they had been unable to\r\nconquer. The Welsh chieftains were leniently treated. While Madog was\r\nimprisoned in the Tower, Morgan was at once set at liberty. By July\r\nEdward was able to leave Wales. Yet his triumph had taxed all his\r\nresources, and left him, overwhelmed with debt, to face the irritation\r\nof subjects unaccustomed to such demands upon their loyalty and\r\npatriotism. But nothing broke his dauntless spirit, and once more he\r\nbusied himself in obtaining revenge on the false King of France.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that the Welsh war should have reduced to slender\r\nproportions the expedition of John of Brittany and John of St. John for\r\nthe recovery of Gascony. After a tedious voyage the English expedition\r\nsailed up the Gironde late in October, 1294. Their forces, strong enough\r\nto capture Bourg and Blaye, were not sufficient to attack Bordeaux.\r\nLeaving the capital in the hands of its conquerors, the English sailed\r\npast Bordeaux to Rioms, where they disembarked. The small towns of the\r\nneighbourhood were taken and garrisoned, and the Gascon lords began to\r\nflock to the camp of their duke. Before long the army was large enough\r\nto be divided. John of Brittany remained at Rioms, while John of St.\r\nJohn marched overland to Bayonne. The French garrison was unable to\r\noverpower the enthusiasm of the Bayonnais for Edward, and the capture of\r\nthe second town of Gascony was the greatest success attained by the\r\ninvaders. With the spring of 1295, however, Charles of Valois, brother\r\nof the King of France, was sent to operate against John of Brittany. The\r\nEnglish and Gascons found themselves unable to make head against him.\r\nThere was ill-feeling between the two nations that made up the army, and\r\nalso between the nobly-born knights and men-at-arms and the foot\r\nsoldiers. The infantry mutinied, and John of Brittany fled by night down\r\nthe river from Rioms, leaving many of his knights and all his horses and\r\narmour in the town. Next day Rioms opened its gates to Charles of\r\nValois, who gained immense spoils and many distinguished prisoners. Save\r\nfor the capture of Bayonne, the expedition had been a disastrous\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nEdward failed even more signally in his efforts to defeat Philip by\r\ndiplomacy. He had left no effort unspared to build up a great coalition\r\nagainst the French king. He \"sent a great quantity of sterling money\r\nbeyond the sea,\" and made alliances with all the princes and barons that\r\nhe could find.[1] At first it seemed that he had succeeded. Adolf of\r\nNassau, the poor and dull, but strenuous and hard-fighting King of the\r\nRomans, concluded a treaty with England, and did not think it beneath\r\nthe dignity of the lord of the world to take the pay of the English\r\nmonarch. Many vassals of the empire, especially in the Netherlands, the\r\nRhineland, and Burgundy followed Adolf's example. Edward strengthened\r\nhis party further by marrying three of his daughters to the Duke of\r\nBrabant, the son of the Count of Holland, and the Count of Bar as the\r\nprice of their adherence to the coalition. He made closer his ancient\r\nfriendship with Guy of Dampierre, the old Count of Flanders, by\r\nbetrothing Edward of Carnarvon to his daughter Philippine. At the same\r\ntime he sought the friendship of the lords of the Pyrenees, such as the\r\nCount of Foix, and of the kings of the Spanish peninsula. But nothing\r\ncame of the hopes thus excited, save fair promises and useless\r\nexpenditure. Before long Philip of France was able to build up a French\r\nparty in appearance as formidable-in reality as useless as Edward's\r\nattempted confederation. Edward's most important ally, Guy of Flanders,\r\nwas forced to renounce his daughter's marriage to the heir of England\r\nand hand her over to Philip's custody. The time was not yet come for\r\neffective European coalitions; the real fighting had to be done by the\r\nparties directly interested in the quarrel.\r\n\r\n    [1] See a contemporary notice printed by F. Funck-Brentano in\r\n    _Revue Historique_, xxxix. (1889), pp. 329-30.\r\n\r\nThe command of the sea continued to be a vital question. The Norman\r\nsailors were eager to avenge their former defeats, and Philip saw that\r\nthe best way to preserve his hold over Gascony was to be master of the\r\nChannel and the Bay of Biscay. Edward prepared to meet attack by\r\nestablishing an organisation of the English navy which marks an epoch in\r\nthe history of our admiralty. He divided the vessels told off to guard\r\nthe sea into three classes, and set over each a separate admiral. John\r\nof Botecourt was made admiral of the Yarmouth and eastern fleet; William\r\nof Leyburn was set over the navy at Portsmouth; and the western and\r\nIrish squadron was put under a valiant knight of Irish origin. Meanwhile\r\nthe French planned an invasion of England, and promised James of Aragon\r\nthat, when England was conquered, its king should be considered his\r\npersonal prize. Galleys were hired at Marseilles and Genoa for service\r\nin the Channel, and Sir Thomas Turberville, a Glamorganshire knight\r\ncaptured at Rioms, turned traitor and was restored to England in the\r\nhope that he might obtain the custody of some seaport and betray it to\r\nthe enemy. Turberville strove in vain to induce Morgan to head another\r\nrevolt in Glamorgan, and urged upon Philip the need of an alliance with\r\nthe Scots. At last the invasion was attempted, and the French admiral,\r\nMatthew of Montmorenci, sacked and burnt the town of Dover. Luckily,\r\nhowever, Turberville's treason was discovered, and the Yarmouth fleet\r\nsoon avenged the attack on Dover by burning Cherbourg. In the face of\r\nsuch resistance, Philip IV. abandoned his plan of invasion and tried to\r\nestablish a sort of \"continental blockade\" of English ports in which a\r\nmodern writer has seen an anticipation of the famous dream of\r\nNapoleon.[1] Though nothing came of these grandiose schemes, yet the\r\nefforts made to organise invasion had their permanent importance as\r\nresulting in the beginnings of the French royal navy. As late as 1297 a\r\nGenoese was appointed admiral of France in the Channel, and strongly\r\nurged the invasion of England and its devastation by fire and flame. But\r\nthe immediate result of Philip's efforts to cut off England from the\r\ncontinent was that his Flemish allies found in his policy a new reason\r\nfor abandoning his service. On January 7, 1297, a fresh treaty of\r\nalliance between Edward and Guy, Count of Flanders, was concluded.\r\n\r\n    [1] See for this Jourdain, _Mémoire sur les Commencements de la\r\n    Marine française sous Philippe le Bel_ (1880), and C. de la\r\n    Roncière, _Le Blocus continental de l'Angleterre sous Philippe\r\n    le Bel_ in _Revue des Questions historiques_, lx. (1896),\r\n    401-41.\r\n\r\nMore effective than Philip's efforts to combine the Continent against\r\nthe English were his endeavours to stir up opposition to Edward in\r\nBritain. The Welsh rising of 1294 had taken place independently of him,\r\nbut it was not Philip's fault that Morgan did not once more excite\r\nGlamorgan to rebellion. A better opening for intrigue was found in\r\nScotland. Ever since the accession of John Balliol, there had been\r\nappeals from the Scottish courts to those of Edward. Certain suits begun\r\nunder the regency, which had acted in Edward's name from 1290 to 1292,\r\ngave the overlord an opportunity of inserting the thin end of the wedge;\r\nand it looked as if, after a few years, appeals from Edinburgh to London\r\nwould be as common as appeals from Bordeaux to Paris. But whatever were\r\nthe ancient relations of England and Scotland, it is clear that the\r\ncustom of appeals to the English king had never previously been\r\nestablished. It was no wonder then that what seemed to Edward an\r\ninevitable result of King John's submission, appeared to the Scots an\r\nunwarrantable restriction of their independence.\r\n\r\nThe weakness and simplicity of King John left matters to take their\r\ncourse for a time, but the king, who was not strong enough to stand up\r\nagainst Edward, was not the man to resist the pressure of his own\r\nsubjects. On his return from the London parliament of June, 1294, the\r\nScots barons virtually deposed him. A committee was set up by parliament\r\nconsisting of four bishops, four earls, and four barons which, though\r\nestablished professedly on the model of the twelve peers of France, had\r\na nearer prototype in the fifteen appointed under the Provisions of\r\nOxford. To this body the whole power of the Scottish monarchy was\r\ntransferred, so that John became a mere puppet, unable to act without\r\nthe consent of his twelve masters. Under this new government the\r\nrelations of England and Scotland soon became critical. The Scots denied\r\nall right of appeal to the English courts, and expelled from their\r\ncountry the nobles whose possessions in England gave them a greater\r\ninterest in the southern than in the northern kingdom. Among the\r\ndispossessed barons was Robert Bruce, son of the claimant, by marriage\r\nalready Earl of Carrick, and now by his father's recent death lord of\r\nAnnandale. In defiance of Edward's prohibition the Scots received French\r\nships, and subjected English traders at Berwick to many outrages. At\r\nlast, on July 5, 1295, an alliance was signed between Scotland and\r\nFrance, by which Edward Balliol, the eldest son of King John, was\r\nbetrothed to Joan, the eldest daughter of Charles of Valois, the brother\r\nof the French king. On this, Edward demanded the surrender of three\r\nborder castles, and on the refusal of the Scots, cited John to appear at\r\nBerwick on March 1, 1296. Thus, by a process similar to that which had\r\nembroiled Edward with his French overlord, the King of Scots also was\r\nforced to face the alternative of certain war or humiliating surrender.\r\n\r\nTo Edward a breach with Scotland was unwelcome. In 1294 the Welsh had\r\nprevented him using all his power against France, and in 1295 the Scots\r\ntroubles further postponed his prospects of revenge. But no suggestion\r\nof compromise or delay came from him. On his return to London early in\r\nAugust, 1295, he busied himself with preparing to resist the enemies\r\nthat were gathering around him on every side. It was the moment of the\r\nraid on Dover, and the French question was still the more pressing. In a\r\nparliament of magnates at London, Edmund of Lancaster told the story of\r\nhis Paris embassy with such effect that two cardinal-legates, whom the\r\nnew pope, Boniface VIII., had sent in the hope of making peace, were put\r\noff politely, on the ground that Edward could make no treaty without the\r\nconsent of his ally, the King of the Romans. Edmund was appointed\r\ncommander of a new expedition to Gascony, though his weak health delayed\r\nhis departure. Meanwhile Edward called upon every class of his subjects\r\nto co-operate with him in his defence of the national honour. He was\r\nstatesman enough to see that he could only cope with the situation, if\r\nEngland as a whole rallied round him. His best answer to the Scots and\r\nthe French was the convention of the \"model parliament\" of November,\r\n1295.\r\n\r\nThe deep political purpose with which this parliament was assembled is\r\nreflected even in the formal language of the writs. \"Inasmuch as a most\r\nrighteous law of the emperors,\" wrote Edward, \"ordains that what touches\r\nall should be approved by all, so it evidently appears that common\r\ndangers should be met by remedies agreed upon in common. You know well\r\nhow the King of France has cheated me out of Gascony, and how he still\r\nwickedly retains it. But now he has beset my realm with a great fleet\r\nand a great multitude of warriors, and proposes, if his power equal his\r\nunrighteous design, to blot out the English tongue from the face of the\r\nearth.\" To avert this peril, Edward summoned not only a full and\r\nrepresentative gathering of magnates, but also two knights from every\r\nshire and two burgesses from every borough. Moreover, the lower clergy\r\nwere also required to take part in the assembly, the archdeacons and\r\ndeans in person, the clergy of every cathedral church by one proctor,\r\nthe beneficed clerks of each diocese by two proctors. Thus the assembly\r\nbecame so systematic a representation of the three estates' that after\r\nages have regarded it as the type upon which subsequent popular\r\nparliaments were to be modelled. This gathering marks the end of the\r\nparliamentary experiments of the earlier part of the reign. It met on\r\nNovember 27, and each estate, deliberating separately, contributed its\r\nquota to the national defence. The barons and knights offered an\r\neleventh, and the boroughs a seventh. It was a bitter disappointment to\r\nEdward that the clergy could not be induced to make a larger grant than\r\na tenth. Enough, however, was obtained to equip the two armies which, in\r\nthe spring of 1296, were to operate against the French and the Scots.\r\n\r\nThe Gascon expedition was the first to start. Early in March, 1296,\r\nEdmund of Lancaster, accompanied by the Earl of Lincoln, landed at Bourg\r\nand Blaye. John of St. John was still maintaining himself in that\r\ndistrict as well as at Bayonne. On the appearance of the reinforcements\r\nthe Gascon lords began to flock to the English camp, and a large force\r\nwas at once able to take the field. On March 28 an attempt was made to\r\ncapture Bordeaux by a sudden assault. On its failure Edmund, who did not\r\npossess the equipment necessary for a formal siege, sailed up the river\r\nto Saint-Macaire and occupied the town. But the castle held out\r\ngallantly, and after a three weeks' siege Edmund retired to his original\r\nposition on the lower Gironde. Even there he found difficulty in holding\r\nhis own, and before long shifted his quarters to Bayonne. He had\r\nexhausted his resources, and found that his army could not be kept\r\ntogether without pay. \"Thereupon,\" writes Hemingburgh, \"his face fell\r\nand he sickened about Whitsuntide. So with want of money came want of\r\nbreath too, and after a few days he went the way of all flesh.\" Lincoln,\r\nhis successor, managed still to stand his ground against Robert of\r\nArtois. At last Artois made a successful night attack upon the English,\r\ncaptured St. John, and destroyed all his war-train and baggage. The\r\ndarkness of the night and the shelter of the neighbouring woods alone\r\nsaved the English army from total destruction. \"After this,\" boasted\r\nWilliam of Nangis, \"no Englishman or Gascon dared to go out to battle\r\nagainst the Count of Artois and the French.\" At Easter, 1297, a truce\r\nwas concluded which left nearly all Gascony in French hands.\r\n\r\nSoon after the departure of his brother for Gascony, Edward went to war\r\nagainst the Scots, regarding the non-appearance of King John on March 1\r\nat Berwick as a declaration of hostility. The lord of Wark offered to\r\nbetray his castle to the Scots, and Edward's successful effort to save\r\nit first brought him to the Tweed. Meanwhile the men of Annandale under\r\ntheir new lord, the Earl of Buchan, engaged in a raid on Carlisle, but\r\nfailed to capture the city, and speedily returned home. On March 28, the\r\nday on which his brother attacked Bordeaux, Edward crossed the Tweed at\r\nColdstream, and marched down its left bank towards Berwick. On March 30\r\nBerwick was captured. The townsmen fought badly, and the heroes of the\r\nresistance were thirty Flemish merchants, who held their factory, called\r\nthe Red Hall, until the building was fired, and the defenders perished\r\nin the flames. The garrison of the castle, commanded by Sir William\r\nDouglas, laid down their arms at once.\r\n\r\nEdward spent a month in Berwick, strengthening the fortifications of the\r\ntown, and preparing for an invasion of Scotland. Early in April, King\r\nJohn renounced his homage and, immediately afterwards, the Scots lords\r\nwho had attacked Carlisle devastated Tynedale and Redesdale, penetrating\r\nas far as Hexham. Edward's command of the sea made it impossible for the\r\nraiders to cut off his communications with his base, and they quickly\r\nreturned to their own land, where they threw themselves into Dunbar.\r\nThough the lord of Dunbar, Patrick, Earl of March, was serving with the\r\nEnglish king, his countess, who was at Dunbar, invited them into the\r\nfortress. Dunbar blocked the road into Scotland, and Edward sent forward\r\nEarl Warenne with a portion of the army in the hope of recapturing the\r\nposition. Warenne laid siege to Dunbar, but on the third day, April 27,\r\nthe main Scots army came to its relief. Leaving some of the young nobles\r\nto continue the siege, Warenne drew up his army in battle array. The\r\nScots thought that the English were preparing for flight, and rushed\r\nupon them with loud cries and blowing of horns. Discovering too late\r\nthat the enemy was ready for battle, they fell back in confusion as far\r\nas Selkirk Forest. Next day Edward came up from Berwick and received the\r\nsurrender of Dunbar. Henceforth his advance was but a military\r\npromenade.\r\n\r\nEdward turned back from Dunbar to receive the submission of the Steward\r\nof Scotland at Roxburgh, and to welcome a large force of Welsh infantry,\r\nwhose arrival enabled him to dismiss the English foot, fatigued with the\r\nslight effort of a month's easy campaigning. Thence he made his way to\r\nEdinburgh, which yielded after an eight days' siege. Stirling castle,\r\nthe next barrier to his progress, was abandoned by its garrison, and\r\nthere Edward was reinforced by some Irish contingents. He then advanced\r\nto Perth, keeping St. John's feast on June 24 in St. John's own town. On\r\nJuly 10 Balliol surrendered to the Bishop of Durham at Brechin,\r\nacknowledging that he had forfeited his throne by his rebellion. Edward\r\ncontinued his triumphal progress, preceded at every stage by Bishop Bek\r\nat the head of the warriors of the palatinate of St. Cuthbert. He made\r\nhis way through Montrose up the east coast to Aberdeen, and thence up\r\nthe Don and over the hills to Banff and Elgin, the farthest limit of his\r\nadvance. He returned by a different route, bringing back with him from\r\nScone the stone on which the Scots kings had been wont to sit at their\r\ncoronation. This he presented as a trophy of victory to the monks of\r\nWestminster, where it was set up as a chair for the priest celebrating\r\nmass at the altar over against the shrine of St. Edward, though soon\r\nused as the coronation seat of English kings.\r\n\r\nIn less than five months Edward had conquered a kingdom. On August 22 he\r\nwas back at Berwick, whither he had summoned a parliament of the nobles\r\nand prelates of both kingdoms, in order that the work of organising the\r\nfuture government of Scotland might be completed. Meanwhile a crowd of\r\nScots of every class flocked to the victor's court and took oaths of\r\nfealty to him. Their names, along with those of the persons who made\r\nsimilar recognitions of his sovereignly during his Scottish progress,\r\nwere recorded with notarial precision in one of those formal documents\r\nwith which Edward delighted to mark the stages in the accomplishment of\r\nhis task. This record, popularly styled the Ragman Roll, containing the\r\nnames of about two thousand freeholders and men of substance in\r\nScotland, is of extreme value to the Scottish genealogist and\r\nantiquary.[1] The last entries are dated August 28, the day on which\r\nEdward met his parliament at Berwick. The administration of Scotland was\r\nprovided for. John, Earl Warenne, became the king's lieutenant, Hugh\r\nCressingham, treasurer, and William Ormesby, justiciar. When the land\r\nwas subdued Edward showed a strong desire to treat the people well. The\r\nonly precaution taken by him against the renewal of disturbances was an\r\norder that the former King of Scots, John Comyn of Buchan, John Comyn of\r\nBadenoch, and other magnates of the patriotic party were to dwell in\r\nEngland, south of the Trent, until the conclusion of the war with\r\nFrance. As soon as his business was accomplished at Berwick, Edward\r\nturned his steps southwards. At last he seemed free to lead a great army\r\nagainst Philip the Fair; and, in order to prepare for the French\r\nexpedition, he summoned another parliament to meet at Bury St. Edmunds\r\non the morrow of All Souls' day, November 3. At Bury the barons,\r\nknights, and burgesses made liberal offerings for the war. But a new\r\ndifficulty arose in the absolute refusal of the clergy to vote any\r\nsupplies. Once more the cup of hope was dashed from Edward's lips, and\r\nhe found himself forced to enter into another weary conflict, this time\r\nwith his English liegemen.\r\n\r\n    [1] It is printed by the Bannatyne Club, and summarised in\r\n    _Cal. Doc. Scot._, ii., 193-214.\r\n\r\nSo long as Peckham had lived, there had always been a danger of a\r\nconflict between Church and State. Friar John had ended his restless\r\ncareer in 1292, and Edward showed natural anxiety to secure as his\r\nsuccessor a prelate more amenable to the secular authority and more\r\nnational in his sentiments. The papacy remained vacant after the death\r\nof Nicholas IV. in 1292, so that there was no danger of Rome taking the\r\nappointment into its own hands, and the happy accident, which had given\r\nthe monks of Christchurch a statesmanlike prior in Henry of Eastry,\r\nminimised the chances of a futile conflict between the king and the\r\ncanonical electors. Eastry took care that the archbishop-elect should\r\nbe a person acceptable to the sovereign. Robert Winchelsea, the new\r\nprimate, was an Englishman and a secular clerk, who had taught with\r\ndistinction at Paris and Oxford, but had received no higher\r\necclesiastical promotion than the archdeaconry of Essex and a canonry\r\nof St. Paul's, and was mainly conspicuous for the sanctity of his life,\r\nhis ability as a preacher, and his zeal for making the cathedral of\r\nLondon a centre of theological instruction. The vacancy in, the papacy\r\nforced upon the archbishop-elect a wearisome delay of eighteen months\r\nin Italy; but at last in September, 1294, he received consecration and\r\nthe _pallium_ from the newly elected hermit-pope, Celestine V.\r\nWinchelsea on his return strove to show that a secular archbishop could\r\nbe as austere in life, and as zealous for the rights of Holy Church, as\r\nhis mendicant predecessors. His desire to walk in the steps of Peckham\r\nsoon brought him into conflict with the king, and in this conflict he\r\nshowed an appreciation of the political situation, and a power of\r\ninterpreting English opinion, which made him the most formidable of\r\nEdward's domestic opponents. He gained his first victory in the\r\nparliament of 1295 by preventing the clergy from making a larger grant\r\nthan a tenth. But this triumph sank into insignificance as compared\r\nwith the refusal of all aid by the parliament of Bury.\r\n\r\nA change in the papacy immensely strengthened Winchelsea's position\r\nagainst Edward. In December, 1294, Celestine, overpowered with the\r\nburden of an office too heavy for his strength, made his great\r\nrenunciation and sought to resume his hermit life. The Cardinal\r\nBenedict Gaetano was at once elected his successor and took the style\r\nof Boniface VIII. The son of a noble house of the neighbourhood of\r\nAnagni, a canonist, a politician, and a zealot, the new pope had made\r\npersonal acquaintance with Edward and England from having attended\r\nCardinal Ottobon on his English legation, and was eager to appease\r\ndiscord between Christian princes in order to forward the crusade. He\r\nhated war the more because it was largely waged with the money drawn\r\nfrom the clergy, and was indignant that the custom of taxing the\r\nChurch, which was begun under the guise of crusading tenths, had become\r\nso frequent that both Philip and Edward applied it in order to raise\r\nrevenue from ecclesiastics for frankly secular warfare. Within a few\r\nweeks of his accession he despatched two cardinals to mediate peace\r\nbetween the Kings of France and England, and was disgusted at the long\r\ndelays with which both kings had sought to frustrate his intervention.\r\nOn February 29, 1296, Boniface issued his famous bull _Clericis\r\nlaicos_, in which he declared it unlawful for any lay authority to\r\nexact supplies from the clergy without the express authority of the\r\napostolic see. Princes imposing, and clerics submitting to such\r\nexactions were declared _ipso_ facto excommunicate.\r\n\r\nBoniface's contention had been urged by his predecessors, and it is\r\nimprobable that he sought to do more than assert the ancient law of the\r\nChurch and save the clergy all over the Latin world from exactions\r\nwhich were fast becoming intolerable. His object was quite general,\r\nthough a pointed reference to the extortions of Edward in 1294 showed\r\nthat he had the case of England before his mind. He had no wish to\r\nthrow down the gauntlet to the princes of Christendom, or to quarrel\r\nwith Edward and Philip, between whom he was still conducting\r\nnegotiations. It was his misfortune that he was constantly forced to\r\nface fresh conditions which rendered it almost possible to apply the\r\nancient doctrines. Strong national kings, like Edward and Philip, had\r\nalready shown impatience with such traditions of the Church as limited\r\ntheir temporal authority. The pope's untimely restatement of the\r\ntheories of the twelfth century at once involved him in his first\r\nfierce difference with Philip the Fair, and put him into a position in\r\nwhich he could only win peace by explaining away the doctrine of\r\n_Clericis laicos_. While on the continent the conflict of Church and\r\nState took the form of a dispute between the French king and the\r\npapacy, in England it assumed the shape of a struggle between Edward\r\nand the Archbishop of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1296, at Bury, Winchelsea admitted the justice of the\r\nFrench war, but pleaded the pope's decretal as an absolute bar to any\r\ngrant from the clerical estate. No decision was arrived at, and the\r\nproblem was discussed again in the convocation of Canterbury in\r\nJanuary, 1297. \"We have two lords over us,\" declared the archbishop to\r\nhis clergy, \"the king and the pope; and, although we owe obedience to\r\nboth of these, we owe greater obedience to our spiritual than to our\r\ntemporal lord.\" All that they could do was to entreat the pope's\r\npermission to allow them to pay Cæsar that which Cæsar by himself had\r\nno right to demand. Edward burst into a fury on hearing of this new\r\npretext for delay. He declared that the clergy must pay a fifth, under\r\npenalty of his withdrawing his protection from a body which strove to\r\nstand outside the commonwealth. The clergy remained firm, and separated\r\nwithout making any grant. Thereupon, on January 30, the chief justice,\r\nJohn of Metingham, sitting in Westminster Hall, pronounced the clergy\r\nto be outlays. \"Henceforth,\" he declared, \"there shall be no justice\r\nmeted out to a clerk in the court of the lord king, however atrocious\r\nbe the injury from which he may have suffered. But sentence against a\r\nclerk shall be given at the instance of all who have a complaint\r\nagainst him.\" Winchelsea retaliated by publishing the sentence of\r\nexcommunication against violators of the papal bull. Two days later the\r\nking ordered the sheriffs to take possession of the lay fees held by\r\nclerks in the province of Canterbury. A few ecclesiastics, who\r\nprivately made an offering of a fifth, were alone exempted from this\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nEdward's conflict with the Church was followed within a month by a\r\ndispute of almost equal gravity with a section of the barons. He\r\nsummoned a baronial parliament to assemble on February 24 at Salisbury,\r\nand went down in person to explain his plan of campaign. One force was\r\nto help his new ally, Guy of Flanders, while another was to act in\r\nGascony. Edward himself was to accompany the army to Flanders. He\r\nrequested some of the earls, including Norfolk and Hereford, to fight\r\nfor him in Gascony. The deaths of Edmund of Lancaster, Gilbert of\r\nGloucester, and William of Pembroke had robbed the baronage of its\r\nnatural leaders. Earl Warenne was fully engaged in the north, and\r\nLincoln was devoted to the king's side. The removal of other possible\r\nspokesmen made Norfolk and Hereford the champions of the party of\r\nopposition. For years the friends of aristocratic authority had been\r\nsmarting under the growing influence of the crown. The time was ripe\r\nfor a revival of the baronial opposition which a generation earlier had\r\nwon the Provisions of Oxford. Moreover both the earls had personal\r\nslights to avenge. Hereford bitterly resented the punishment meted out\r\nto him for waging private war against Earl Gilbert in the march.\r\nNorfolk was angry because, during the last Welsh campaign, Edward had\r\nsuspended him from the exercise of the marshalship. The form of\r\nEdward's request at Salisbury gave them a technical advantage which\r\nthey were not slow to seize. Ignoring the broader issues which lay\r\nbetween them and the king, they took their stand on their traditional\r\nrights as constable and marshal to attend the king in person. \"Freely,\"\r\ndeclared the earl marshal, \"will I go with thee, O king, and march\r\nbefore thee in the first line of thy army, as my hereditary duty\r\nrequires.\" Edward answered: \"Thou shalt go without me along with the\r\nrest to Gascony\". The marshal replied: \"I am not bound to go save with\r\nthee, nor will I go\". Edward flew into a passion: \"By God, sir earl,\r\nthou shalt either go or hang\". Norfolk replied with equal spirit: \"By\r\nthat same oath, sir king, I will neither go nor hang\". The parliament\r\nbroke up in disorder. Before long a force of 1,500 men-at-arms gathered\r\ntogether under the leadership of the constable and marshal.\r\n\r\nDuring these stormy times Edward had been straining every nerve to\r\nequip an adequate army for foreign service. Once more he laid violent\r\nhands upon the wool and hides of the merchants, while a huge\r\nmale--tolt, varying from forty shillings a sack for raw wool to\r\nsixty-six shillings and eightpence a sack for carded wool, was exacted\r\nfor such wool as the king's officers suffered to remain in the owner's\r\npossession. Moreover, vast stores of wheat, barley, and oats, salt pork\r\nand salt beef were requisitioned all over the land. Men said that the\r\nking's tyranny could no longer be borne, and that the rights decreed to\r\nall Englishmen by the Great Charter were in imminent danger. The\r\nmovement, which had begun as a defence of feudal right, became a\r\npopular revolt in favour of national liberty. The commons joined the\r\nbarons and clergy in the general opposition to the headstrong king.\r\n\r\nEdward saw that he must divide his enemies if he wished to effect his\r\npurpose. The clergy were the easiest to deal with. Boniface VIII. was\r\nalready yielding in his struggle against Philip the Fair. In the bull\r\n_Romana mater_ of February 2, 1297, he had authorised voluntary\r\ncontributions of the French clergy in the case of pressing necessity,\r\nwithout previous recourse to the permission of the apostolic see. The\r\nsame attitude had already been taken up by the royalist clergy in\r\nEngland, who redeemed their outlawry by offering to the king the fifth\r\nof their revenues. In March Edward made things easier for the\r\nrecalcitrants by suspending the edict confiscating the lay fees of the\r\nChurch. Even Winchelsea saw the wisdom of abandoning his too heroic\r\nattitude. In a convocation, held on March 24, he practically applied\r\nthe doctrine of _Romana mater_ to the English situation. \"Let each\r\nman,\" he declared, \"save his own soul and follow his own conscience.\r\nBut my conscience does not allow me to offer money for the king's\r\nprotection or on any other pretext.\" In the event nearly all the clergy\r\nbought off the king's wrath by the voluntary payment of a fifth.\r\nWinchelsea was obdurate. His estates remained for five months in the\r\nking's hands, and he was forced, like another St. Francis, to depend on\r\nthe charity of the faithful. But even Winchelsea did not hold out\r\nindefinitely. On July 14 he was publicly reconciled with the king\r\noutside Westminster Hall, and a few days later his goods were restored.\r\nOn July 31 Boniface entirely receded from the doctrine of _Cleritis\r\nlaicos_ in the bull _Etsi de statu_. Before this could be known in\r\nEngland, Winchelsea told his clergy that the king had agreed to confirm\r\nthe Great Charter, if they would but make a grant to carry on the\r\nFrench war. A little later Edward of his own authority exacted a third\r\nfrom all clerical revenues. This persistence in his highhanded policy\r\nmade any real reconciliation between Edward and Winchelsea impossible.\r\nThe king never forgave the archbishop, whose action demonstrated to all\r\nEngland the divided allegiance of his clergy between their two masters.\r\nWinchelsea still retained his profound distrust of the king, who had\r\nset at naught the liberties of Church and realm.\r\n\r\nThe baronial opposition was broken up by devices not dissimilar to\r\nthose which neutralised the antagonism of the clergy. By strenuous\r\nefforts Edward obtained a fair sum of money for his expenses. He let it\r\nbe understood that, if he took his subjects' wool, the talleys given in\r\nexchange would be redeemed when better times had arrived, and he\r\nscrupulously paid for the corn and meat that his officers had\r\nrequisitioned. Meanwhile he summoned all possible fighting men from\r\nEngland, Wales, and Ireland to meet at London on July 7. The prospect\r\nof subjects of the crown being forced, whatsoever their feudal\r\nobligations might be, to wage war beyond sea, threatened to provoke a\r\nfresh crisis. But after many long altercations, Edward announced that\r\nneither the feudal tenants nor the twenty-pound freeholders had any\r\nlegal obligation to go with him to Flanders, and offered pay to all who\r\nwere willing to hearken to his \"affectionate request\" for their\r\nservices. Under these conditions a considerable force of stipendiaries\r\nwas levied without much difficulty.\r\n\r\nHereford and Norfolk abandoned active in favour of passive hostility.\r\nThey refused to serve as constable and marshal, and Edward appointed\r\nbarons of less dignity and greater loyalty to act in their place. While\r\nall England was busy with the equipment of troops and the provision of\r\nsupplies, they sullenly held aloof. At last, when all was ready, Edward\r\nissued an appeal to his subjects, protesting the purity of his motives,\r\nand emphasising the inexorable necessity under which he was forced to\r\nplay the tyrant in the interests of the whole realm. By the beginning\r\nof August such barons as were willing to go to Flanders began to\r\nassemble in arms at London. The young Edward of Carnarvon was appointed\r\nregent during his father's absence, and among the councillors who were\r\nto act in his name was the Archbishop of Canterbury. At last the king\r\nset off to embark at Winchelsea. While there, the earls presented to\r\nhim a belated list of grievances. He refused to deal with their demand\r\nfor the confirmation of the charters. \"My full council,\" he declared to\r\nthe envoys of the earls, \"is not with me, and without it I cannot reply\r\nto your requests. Tell those who have sent you that, if they will come\r\nwith me to Flanders, they will please me greatly. If they will not\r\ncome, I trust they will do no harm to me, or at any rate to my\r\nkingdom.\" On August 24 he took ship for Flanders, and a few days later\r\nhe and his troops safely landed at Sluys, whence they made their way to\r\nGhent. Nearly a thousand men-at-arms and a great force of infantry,\r\nlargely Welsh and Irish, swelled the expedition to considerable\r\nproportions. After all his troubles, Edward found that the loyalty of\r\nhis subjects enabled him to carry out the ideal which he had formulated\r\ntwo years before. King and nation were to meet common dangers by action\r\nundertaken in common.\r\n\r\nEverything else was ruthlessly sacrificed in order that the king might\r\ntake an army to Flanders. The Gascon expedition was quietly dropped.\r\nBut the gravest difficulty arose not from Gascony but Scotland.\r\nEdward's choice of agents to carry out his Scottish policy had been\r\nsingularly unhappy. Warenne, the governor, was a dull and lethargic\r\nnobleman more than sixty-six years of age. He complained of the bad\r\nclimate of Scotland, and passed most of his time on his Yorkshire\r\nestates. In his absence Cressingham, the treasurer, and Ormesby, the\r\njusticiar, became the real representatives of the English power.\r\nCressingham was a pompous ecclesiastic, who appropriated to his own\r\nuses the money set aside for the fortification of Berwick, and was\r\nodious to the Scots for his rapacity and incompetence. Ormesby was a\r\npedantic lawyer, rigid in carrying out the king's orders but stiff and\r\nunsympathetic in dealing with the Scots. Under such rulers Scotland was\r\nneither subdued nor conciliated. No real effort was made to track to\r\ntheir hiding-places in the hills the numerous outlaws, who had\r\nabandoned their estates rather than take an oath of fealty to Edward.\r\nWhen the English governors took action, they were cruel and\r\nindiscriminating; and often too were lax and careless. Matters soon\r\nbecame serious. William Wallace of Elderslie slew an English official\r\nin Clydesdale, and threw in his lot with the outlaws. He was joined by\r\nSir William Douglas, the former defender of Berwick. By May, 1297,\r\nScotland was in full revolt. In the north, Andrew of Moray headed a\r\nrising in Strathspey. In central Scotland the justiciar barely escaped\r\ncapture, while holding his court at Scone. The south-west, the home\r\nboth of Wallace and Douglas, proved the most dangerous district. There\r\nthe barons, imitating Bohun and Bigod, based their opposition to Edward\r\non his claim upon their compulsory service in the French wars. Before\r\nlong the son of the lord of Annandale, Robert Bruce, now called Earl of\r\nCarrick, Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow, and other magnates were in\r\narms, and in close association with Douglas and Wallace.\r\n\r\nEdward made light of this rebellion. Resolved to go to Flanders at all\r\ncosts, he contented himself with calling upon the levies of the shires\r\nnorth of the Trent to protect his interests in Scotland. Early in July,\r\nHenry Percy, Warenne's grandson, rode through south-western Scotland,\r\nat the head of the Cumberland musters, and on July 7, the local\r\ninsurgent leaders, with the exception of Wallace, made their submission\r\nto him at Irvine. Moreover, Edward released the two Comyns from their\r\nveiled imprisonment, and sent them back to Scotland to help in\r\nsuppressing the insurrection. Henry Percy boasted that the Scots south\r\nof the Forth had been reduced to subjection. But a few days later\r\nWallace was found to be strongly established in Ettrick forest and was\r\nthreatening Roxburgh. At last Edward stirred up Warenne to return to\r\nhis government. The king took the precaution of leaving some of his\r\nbest warriors in England in case their services were needed against the\r\nrecalcitrant barons or the Scots. Then, as has been said, on August 24\r\nhe crossed over to Flanders.\r\n\r\nThe constable and marshal were still in arms, and Winchelsea, who, in\r\nspite of his reconciliation with Edward, was in close communication\r\nwith them, declined to take an active part on the council of regency.\r\nTwo days before Edward took ship, Hereford and Norfolk appeared in arms\r\nat the exchequer at Westminster, and forbade the officials to continue\r\nthe collection of supplies, until the Great Charter and the Charter of\r\nthe Forest had been confirmed. They strove to win the support of the\r\nLondoners, who had long had a grievance against Edward for depriving\r\nthem of their right to elect their own mayor, and for subjecting the\r\ncity to the arbitrary rule of a warden nominated by the crown. They\r\nforbade their followers to commit acts of violence, but they made it\r\nclear that there could be no peace until the charters were confirmed.\r\n\r\nIn August, Warenne grappled with the Scottish rising, but his own\r\nincompetence, and the half-heartedness of the Scottish magnates, on\r\nwhom he relied, made his task very difficult. Wallace retreated beyond\r\nthe Forth, and Warenne reached Stirling on September 10 in pursuit of\r\nhim. He learnt that Wallace was holding the wooded heights, immediately\r\nto the north of Stirling bridge on the left bank of the Forth, not far\r\nfrom the abbey of Cambuskenneth. The Steward of Scotland, who, after\r\nthe collapse of the revolt in the south-west, served under Warenne,\r\noffered his mediation. But no good result came from his action, and the\r\nEnglish suspected treachery. Wallace took up a bold attitude, scorning\r\neither compromise or retreat. He had only a small following of cavalry,\r\nbut his infantry was numerous and enthusiastic. The English resolved to\r\nattack him on September 11. The Forth at Stirling was crossed by a long\r\nwooden bridge, so narrow that only two horsemen could pass abreast. It\r\nwas madness to send an army over the river by such a means in the face\r\nof a watchful enemy. But not only was the English plan of battle\r\nfoolish it was also carried out weakly. Warenne overslept himself, and\r\nhis subordinates wasted the early morning in useless discussions and\r\naltercations. When at last he woke up, he rejected the advice of a\r\nScottish knight to send part of his cavalry over the river by a ford\r\nwhich thirty horsemen could traverse abreast, and ordered all his\r\ntroops to cross by the bridge.\r\n\r\nWallace, seeing that the enemy had delivered themselves into his hands,\r\nremained in the woods until a fair proportion of the English\r\nmen-at-arms had made their way over the stream. He then suddenly\r\nswooped down upon the bridge, cutting off the retreat of those who had\r\ntraversed it, and blocking all possibility of reinforcement. After a\r\nshort fight the English to the north of the Forth were cut down almost\r\nto a man. The English on the Stirling side, seeing the fate of their\r\ncomrades, fled in terror, and their Scots allies went over to their\r\ncountry men. Among the slain was the greedy Cressingham, whose skin the\r\nScots tanned into leather. Warenne did not draw rein until he reached\r\nBerwick, and in one day all Scotland was lost. The castles of Roxburgh\r\nand Berwick alone upheld the English flag. Wallace and Moray governed\r\nall Scotland as \"generals of the army of King John\". Within a few weeks\r\nof their victory, they raided the three northern counties of England.\r\n\r\nWallace had freed Scotland, but his wonderful success taught the\r\ncontending factions in England the plain duty of union against the\r\ncommon enemy. A new parliament of the three estates was summoned for\r\nSeptember 30. The opposition leaders came armed, and declared that there\r\ncould be no supply of men or money until their demand for the\r\nconfirmation of the charters was granted. No longer content with simple\r\nconfirmation, they drew up, in the form of a statute, a petition\r\nrequiring that no tallage or aid should henceforth be taken without the\r\nassent of the estates. This was the so-called _statutum de tallagio non\r\nconcedendo_ which seventeenth-century parliaments and judges erroneously\r\naccepted as a statute. The helpless regency substantially accepted their\r\ndemands, and, on October 12, issued a confirmation of the charters, to\r\nwhich fresh clauses were added, providing, with less generality than in\r\nthe baronial request, that no male-tolts, or such manner of aids as had\r\nrecently been extorted, should be imposed in the future without the\r\ncommon consent of all the realm, but making no reference to tallage.[1]\r\nLiberal supplies were then voted by all the three estates, and\r\nWinchelsea, who all through these proceedings acted as the brain of the\r\nbaronage, exerted himself to explain away the last of the clerical\r\ndifficulties raised by the _Clericis laicos_.\r\n\r\n    [1] The Latin, _Articuli inserti in magna carta_, given by\r\n    Hemingburgh, ii., 152, is quoted as a statute in the Petition\r\n    of Right of 1628, under the title _De tallagio non concedendo_.\r\n    The view of its relation to the French _Confirmatio cartavum_\r\n    is that taken by M. Bémont, _Chartes des libertés anglaises_,\r\n    especially pp. xliii., xliv. and 87. It is based on Bartholomew\r\n    Cotton's nearly contemporary statement (_Hist. Angl_., p. 337).\r\n\r\nOn November 5 the king ratified, at Ghent, the action of his son's\r\nadvisers. Thus the constitutional struggle was ended by the complete\r\ntriumph of the baronial opposition. And the victory was the more\r\nsignal, because it was gained not over a weak king, careless of his\r\nrights, but over the strongest of the Plantagenets, greedy to retain\r\nevery scrap of authority. It is with good reason that the Confirmation\r\nof the Charters of 1297 is reckoned as one of the great turning points\r\nin the history of our constitution. Its provisions sum up the whole\r\nnational advance which had been made since Gualo and William the\r\nmarshal first identified the English monarchy with the principles\r\nwrested from John at Runnymede. In the years that immediately followed,\r\nit might well seem that the act of 1297, like the submission of John,\r\nwas only a temporary expedient of a dexterous statecraft which\r\nconsented with the lips but not with the heart. But in later times,\r\nwhen the details of the struggle were forgotten and the noise of the\r\nbattle over, the event stood out in its full significance. Edward had\r\nbeen willing to take the people into partnership with him when he\r\nthought that they would be passive partners, anxious to do his\r\npleasure. He was taught that the leaders of the people were henceforth\r\nto have their share with the crown in determining national policy.\r\nCommon dangers were still to be met by measures deliberated in common,\r\nbut the initiative was no longer exclusively reserved to the monarch.\r\nThe sordid pedantry of the baronial leaders and the high-souled\r\ndetermination of the king compel our sympathy for Edward rather than\r\nhis enemies. But all that made English history what it is, was involved\r\nin the issue, and the future of English freedom was assured when the\r\nobstinacy of the constable and marshal prevailed over the resolution of\r\nthe great king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE SCOTTISH FAILURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Edward to Flanders lost its best chance of success\r\nthrough the events which retarded its despatch. While the English king\r\nwas wrangling with his barons, the French king was active. On the news\r\nof the alliance of Count Guy with the English, Robert of Artois was\r\nsummoned from Gascony to the north. While Philip besieged Lille, and\r\nfinally took it, Robert of Artois gained a brilliant victory over the\r\nFlemings at Furnes on August 20. Meanwhile John of Avesnes, Count of\r\nHainault, was closely co-operating with the French, and kept Edward's\r\nson-in-law and ally, John, Duke of Brabant, from sending effective help\r\nto the Flemings. Moreover, the Flemish townsmen, in their dislike of\r\ntheir count, were largely on the side of the French. Edward's little\r\narmy could do nothing to redress a balance that already inclined so\r\nheavily on the other side. The Flemings were disappointed at the scanty\r\nnumbers of the English men-at-arms, and stared with wonder and contempt\r\nat the bare-legged Welsh archers and lancemen, with their uncouth garb,\r\nstrange habits of eating and fighting, and propensity to pillage and\r\ndisorder, though they recognised their hardihood and the effectiveness\r\nof their missiles.[1] The same disorderly spirit that had marred the\r\nRioms campaign still prevailed among the English engaged on foreign\r\nservice. No sooner were the troops landed at Sluys on August 28, than\r\nthe mariners of the Cinque Ports renewed their old feud with the men of\r\nYarmouth, and many ships were destroyed and lives lost in this untimely\r\nconflict. Edward advanced to Bruges, where he was joined by the Count of\r\nFlanders, but the disloyalty of the townsmen and the approach of King\r\nPhilip forced the king and the earl to take shelter behind the stronger\r\nwalls of Ghent. Immediately on their retreat, Philip occupied Bruges and\r\nDamme, thus cutting off the English from the direct road to the sea. The\r\nAnglo-Flemish army was afraid to attack the powerful force of the French\r\nking. But the French had learnt by experience a wholesome fear of the\r\nEnglish and Welsh archers, and did not venture to approach Ghent too\r\nclosely. The ridiculous result followed that the Kings of France and\r\nEngland avoided every opportunity of fighting out their quarrel, and\r\nlay, wasting time and money, idly watching each other's movements.\r\n\r\n    [1] See for Flemish criticisms of the Welsh, L. van Velthem,\r\n    _Spiegel Historiaal_, pp. 215-16, ed. Le Long, partly\r\n    translated by Funck Brentano in his edition of _Annales\r\n    Qandenses_, p. 7, a work giving full details of these\r\n    struggles.\r\n\r\nThe only dignified way of putting an end to this impossible situation\r\nlay in negotiation. Edward's faithful servant, William of Hotham, the\r\nDominican friar whom the pope had appointed Archbishop of Dublin, was\r\nin the English camp. Hotham, who had enjoyed Philip's personal\r\nfriendship while teaching theology in the Paris schools, was an\r\nacceptable mediator between the two kings. A short truce was signed at\r\nVyve-Saint-Bavon on the Lys on October 7. This allowed time for more\r\nelaborate negotiations to be carried on at Courtrai and Tournai, and on\r\nJanuary 31, 1298, a truce, in which the allies of both kings were\r\nincluded, was signed at Tournai, to last until January 6, 1300. It was\r\nagreed to refer all questions in dispute to the arbitration of Boniface\r\nVIII, \"not as pope but as a private person, as Benedict Gaetano\". Both\r\nkings despatched their envoys to Rome, where with marvellous celerity\r\nBoniface issued, on June 30, 1298, a preliminary award. It suggested\r\nthe possibility of a settlement on the basis of each belligerent\r\nretaining the possessions which he had held at the beginning of the\r\nstruggle, and entering into an alliance strengthened by a double\r\nmarriage. Edward was to marry the French king's sister Margaret, while\r\nEdward of Carnarvon was to be betrothed to Philip's infant daughter\r\nIsabella. The latter match involved the repudiation of the betrothal of\r\nEdward of Carnarvon with the daughter of the Count of Flanders. But all\r\nthrough the award there was no mention of the allies of either party.\r\nBoniface was too eager for peace to be over-scrupulous as to the\r\nhonourable obligations of the two kings who sought his mediation.\r\n\r\nThe English regency, which grappled so courageously with the baronial\r\nopposition, showed an equal energy in protecting the northern counties\r\nfrom the Scots. About the time of the confirmation of the charters,\r\nWallace crossed the border and spread desolation and ruin from Carlisle\r\nto Hexham. Warenne and Henry Percy, who had attended the October\r\nparliament at London, were soon back in the north. By December the\r\nlargest army which was ever assembled during Edward I.'s reign[1]\r\nwas collected together on the borders, and preparations were made for a\r\nwinter campaign after the fashion which had proved so effective in\r\nWales. But all that Warenne was able to accomplish was the relief of\r\nRoxburgh. The quality of the troops was not equal to their quantity,\r\nand all his misfortunes had not taught him wisdom. Early in Lent Edward\r\nstopped active campaigning by announcing that no great operations were\r\nto be attempted until his return. Thereupon Warenne sent the bulk of\r\nthe troops home, and remained at Berwick, awaiting the king's arrival.\r\n\r\n    [1] Morris, _Welsh Wars of Edward I._, pp. 284-86.\r\n\r\nEdward landed at Sandwich on March 14, 1298, and at once set about\r\npreparing to avenge Stirling Bridge. He met his parliament on\r\nWhitsunday, May 25, at York. The Scots barons were summoned to this\r\nassembly, but as they neither attended nor sent proxies, their absence\r\nwas deemed to be proof of contumacy. A month later a large army was\r\nconcentrated at Roxburgh. The earls and barons with their retinues\r\nmustered to the number of 1,100 horse, while 1,300 men-at-arms served\r\nunder the king's banners for pay. Though Gascony was still in Philip's\r\nhands, the good relations that prevailed between England and France\r\nallowed the presence in Edward's host of a magnificent troop of Gascon\r\nlords, headed by the lord of Albret and the Captal de Buch, and\r\nconspicuous for the splendour of their armour and the costliness and\r\nbeauty of their chargers. On this occasion Edward set little store on\r\ninfantry, and was content to accept the services of those who came of\r\ntheir own free will. Yet even under these conditions some 12,000 foot\r\nwere assembled, more than 10,000 of whom came from Wales and its march.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the opposition were present in Edward's host. On the eve\r\nof the invasion, the impatient king was kept back by the declaration of\r\nHereford and Norfolk that they would not cross the frontier, until\r\ndefinite assurances were given that the king would carry out the\r\nconfirmation of the charters which he had informally ratified on\r\nforeign soil. Etiquette or pride prevented Edward himself satisfying\r\ntheir demand, but the Bishop of Durham and three loyal earls pledged\r\nthemselves that the king would fulfil all his promises on his return.\r\nThen the two earls suffered the expedition to proceed; and on July 6\r\nthe army left Roxburgh, proceeding by moderate marches to Kirkliston on\r\nthe Almond, where it encamped on the 15th. Here there was a few days'\r\ndelay, while Bishop Bek captured some of the East Lothian castles which\r\nwere threatening the English rear. Already there was a difficulty in\r\nobtaining supplies from the devastated country-side, and northerly\r\nwinds prevented the provision ships from sailing from Berwick to the\r\nForth. The worst hardships fell upon the Welsh infantry, who began to\r\nmutiny and talked of joining the Scots. Matters grew worse on the\r\narrival of a wine ship, for such ample rations of wine were distributed\r\nto the Welsh that very many of them became drunk. So threatening was\r\nthe state of affairs that Edward thought of retreating to Edinburgh. On\r\nJuly 21, however, the news was brought that Wallace and his followers\r\nwere assembled in great force at Falkirk, some seventeen miles to the\r\nwest. The prospect of battle at once restored the courage and\r\ndiscipline of the army, and Edward ordered an advance. That night the\r\nhost bivouacked on the moors east of Linlithgow, \"with shields for\r\npillows and armour for beds\". During the night the king, who was\r\nsleeping in the open field like the meanest trooper, received a kick\r\nfrom his horse which broke two of his ribs. Yet the early morning of\r\nJuly 22, the feast of St. Mary Magdalen, saw him riding at the head of\r\nhis troops through the streets of Linlithgow. At last the Scots lances\r\nwere descried on the slopes of a hill near Falkirk, and the English\r\nrested while the bishop and king heard mass. Then the army, which had\r\neaten nothing since the preceding day, advanced to the battle.\r\n\r\nWallace had a large following of infantry, but a mere handful of\r\nmounted men-at-arms. He ordered the latter to occupy the rear, and\r\ngrouped his pikemen, the flower of his army, into four great circles,\r\nor \"schiltrons,\" which, with the front ranks kneeling or sitting and\r\nthe rear ranks standing, presented to the enemy four living castles,\r\neach with a bristling hedge of pikes, dense enough, it was hoped, to\r\nbreak the fierce shock of a cavalry charge. The spaces between the four\r\nschiltrons were occupied by the archers, the best of whom came from\r\nEttrick Forest. The front was further protected by a morass, and\r\nperhaps also by a row of stout posts sunk into the ground and fastened\r\ntogether by ropes.\r\n\r\nEdward ordered the Welsh archers to prepare the way with their missiles\r\nfor the advance of the men-at-arms. But the Welsh refused to move, so\r\nthat Edward was forced to proceed by a direct cavalry charge. For this\r\npurpose he divided his men-at-arms into four \"battles\". The first of\r\nthese was commanded by the Earl of Lincoln, with whom were the\r\nconstable and marshal, who at last had an opportunity of serving the\r\nking in battle in the offices which belonged to them by hereditary\r\nright. On approaching the morass this first line was thrown into some\r\nconfusion, and paused in its advance. Behind it the second battle,\r\nunder command of the Bishop of Durham, who, perhaps, knew the ground\r\nbetter, wheeled to the east and took the Scots on their left flank. But\r\nBek's followers disobeyed his orders to wait until the rest of the army\r\ncame up, and they suffered heavy losses in attacking the left\r\nschiltron. Before long, however, Lincoln found a way round the morass\r\nwestwards to the enemy's right, while the two rearmost battles, headed\r\nby the king and Earl Warenne, also advanced to the front. The combat\r\nthus became general. The Scots cavalry fled without striking a blow,\r\nand some of the English thought that Wallace himself rode off the field\r\nwith them. The archers between the schiltrons were easily trampled\r\ndown, so that the only effective resistance came from the circles of\r\npikemen. The yeomanry of Scotland steadily held their own against the\r\nfierce charges of the mail-clad knights, and it looked for a time as if\r\nthe day was theirs. But the despised infantry at last made their way to\r\nthe front and poured in showers of arrows that broke down the Scottish\r\nranks. Friend and foe were at such close quarters that the English who\r\nhad no bows threw stones against the Scottish circles. When the way was\r\nthus prepared, the horsemen easily penetrated through the gaps made in\r\nthe circles, and before long the Scottish pikemen were a crowd of\r\npanic-stricken fugitives. Edward's brilliant victory was won with\r\ncomparatively little loss.\r\n\r\nIt was years before the Scots again ventured to meet the English in the\r\nopen field. Yet the king's victory was not followed by any real conquest\r\neven of southern Scotland. Edward advanced to Stirling, where he rested\r\nuntil he had recovered from his accident, while detachments of his\r\ntroops penetrated as far as Perth and St. Andrews. Meanwhile the\r\nsouth-west rose in revolt, under Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick, whose\r\nfather had fought at Falkirk. Late in August, Edward made his way to Ayr\r\nand occupied it, while Bruce fled before him. Provisions were still\r\nscarce, and the army was weary of fighting. The Durham contingent\r\ndeserted in a body,[1] and the earls were so lukewarm that Edward was\r\nfain to return by way of Carlisle, capturing Lochmaben, Bruce's\r\nAnnandale stronghold, on the way. On September 8 the king reached\r\nCarlisle, where the constable and marshal declared that they had lost so\r\nmany men and horses that they could no longer continue the campaign.\r\nEdward tried to stem the tide of desertion by promises of Scottish lands\r\nto those who would remain with his banners. But the distribution of\r\nthese rewards proved only a fresh source of discontent. At last Edward\r\nwas forced to dismiss the greater part of his forces. He lingered in the\r\nnorth until the end of the year, but there was no more real fighting;\r\nwith the beginning of 1299 he returned to the south, convinced that the\r\ndisloyalty of his barons had neutralised his triumphs in the field. The\r\nfew castles which still upheld the English cause in Scotland were soon\r\nclosely besieged.\r\n\r\n    [1] Lapsley, _County Palatine of Durham_, p. 128.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of 1299 Edward was prevented by other work from\r\nprosecuting the war against the Scots. Even the borderers were sick of\r\nfighting, and Bishop Bek, who had hitherto afforded him an unswerving\r\nsupport with all the forces of his palatinate, was forced to desist\r\nfrom warlike operations by the refusal of his tenants to serve any\r\nlonger beyond the bounds of the lands of St. Cuthbert. While the men of\r\nDurham abandoned the war, there was little reason to wonder at the\r\nindifference of the south country as to the progress of the Scots. In\r\nthe Lenten parliament at London, the Earls of Hereford and Norfolk\r\npressed Edward once more to fulfil his promise to carry out the\r\nconfirmation of the charters. The king would not yield to their demand\r\nyet dared not refuse it. In his perplexity he had recourse to evasions\r\nwhich further embittered his relations with them. He promised that he\r\nwould give an answer the next day, but when the morrow came, he\r\nsecretly withdrew from the city. The angry barons followed him to his\r\nretreat and reminded him of his broken promise. Edward coolly replied\r\nthat he left London because his health was suffering from the corrupt\r\nair of the town, and bade the barons return, as his council had his\r\nreply ready. The barons obeyed the king's orders, but their indignation\r\npassed all bounds when they found that the king's promised confirmation\r\nof the charters was vitiated by a new clause saving all the rights of\r\nthe crown, and that nothing was said as to the promised perambulation\r\nof the forests. In bitter wrath the parliament broke up, and the\r\nLondoners, who shared the anger of the barons, threatened a revolt.\r\nAfter Easter these stormy scenes were repeated in a new parliament, and\r\nEdward was at last forced to yield a grudging assent to all the demands\r\nof the opposition, and even to appoint a commission for the\r\nperambulation of the forests. By the time the summer was at hand, the\r\nprogress of the negotiations with France occupied Edward so fully that\r\nhe had abundant excuse for not precipitating a new rupture with his\r\nbarons, by insisting upon a fresh campaign against the Scots.\r\n\r\nA papal legate presided over a congress of English and French\r\nambassadors at Montreuil-sur-mer, which belonged to Edward by right of\r\nthe late queen, Eleanor as Countess of Ponthieu. The outcome of these\r\ndeliberations was the treaty of Montreuil, concluded on June 19, 1299.\r\nIt was not the final pacification which had been hoped for. Edward\r\nindeed abandoned his Flemish allies, but Philip would not relax his\r\nhold upon Gascony, and without that a definitive peace was impossible.\r\nThe treaty of Montreuil was simply a marriage treaty. Edward was\r\nforthwith to marry Margaret, and his son was to be betrothed to\r\nIsabella of France. Neither the prolongation of the truce nor the\r\naffairs of the Flemings were mentioned in it, while all that Philip did\r\nfor the Scots was to provide for the liberation of the deposed King\r\nJohn from his English prison. As soon as the ratifications were\r\nexchanged the king, who was then sixty years of age, and his youthful\r\nbride were married on September 9 at Canterbury by Archbishop\r\nWinchelsea.\r\n\r\nEdward's willingness to marry the sister of the king who still kept him\r\nout of Gascony can best be explained by his overmastering desire to\r\nrenew operations in Scotland. Shortly after his marriage, he again\r\nbusied himself with preparations for the long-delayed Scots campaign.\r\nIt was high time that he took action. The English garrisons were\r\nsurrendering one by one, and the Scottish magnates were deserting the\r\nEnglish cause. Their conversion to patriotic principles was made easier\r\nby the decay of Wallace's power consequent on his defeat at Falkirk.\r\nAfter stormy scenes with his aristocratic rivals, Wallace withdrew from\r\nScotland and went to the continent, where he implored the help of the\r\nKing of France. Philip proved true to his new brother-in-law, and put\r\nWallace in prison, only releasing him that he might go to Rome and\r\nenlist the sympathy of Boniface VIII. Meanwhile the Scots chose a new\r\nregency at the head of which was the younger John Comyn of Badenoch.\r\nUnder these changed conditions the Scottish earls rapidly rallied round\r\nthe national cause. Stirling, Edward's chief stronghold in central\r\nScotland, was so hardly pressed that the men-at-arms were forced to eat\r\ntheir chargers. Yet when the English barons assembled about the\r\nbeginning of winter, in obedience to Edward's summons, they stubbornly\r\ndeclared that they would not endure the hardships of a winter campaign\r\nuntil the king had fulfilled his pledges as regards the charters. Thus\r\nleft to their own resources, the sorely tried garrison of Stirling\r\nsurrendered to the Scots.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1300, Edward met his parliament at Westminster. Despite the\r\nstraits to which he was reduced, he was still unwilling to make a\r\ncomplete surrender. He avoided a formal re-issue of the charters by\r\ngiving his sanction to a long series of articles, drawn up apparently by\r\nthe barons. These articles provided for the better publication of the\r\ncharters, and the appointment in every shire of a commission to punish\r\nall offences against them which were not already provided for by the\r\ncommon law; together with numerous technical clauses \"for the relief of\r\nthe grievances that the people have had by reason of the wars that have\r\nbeen, and for the amendment of their estate, and that they may be more\r\nready in the king's service and more willing to aid him when he has need\r\nof them \". This document was known as _Articuli super cartas_.[1] At the\r\nsame time the forest perambulation, which had long been ordered, was\r\ndirected to be proceeded with at once. For this reason a chronicler\r\ncalls this assembly \"the parliament of the perambulation\".[2] The\r\nreconciliation between the king and his subjects was attested by a grant\r\nof a twentieth.\r\n\r\n    [1] It is published in Bémont's _Chartes_, pp. 99-108, with\r\n    valuable comments; another draft analysed in _Hist. MSS.\r\n    Comm._, 6th Report, i., p. 344.\r\n\r\n    [2] Langtoft, ii, 320.\r\n\r\nEdward's concessions once more enabled him to face the Scots, and the\r\nsummer saw a gallant army mustered at Carlisle, though some of the\r\nearls, including Roger Bigod, still held aloof. A two months' campaign\r\nwas fought in south-western Scotland in July and August. But the\r\npeasants drove their cattle to the hills, and rainy weather impeded the\r\nking's movements. The chief exploit of the campaign was the capture of\r\nCarlaverock castle, though even in the glowing verse of the herald, who\r\nhas commemorated the taking of this stronghold,[1] the military\r\ninsignificance of the achievement cannot be concealed. Edward returned\r\nto the same district in October, but he effected so little that he was\r\nglad to agree to a truce with the Scots, which Philip the Fair urged him\r\nto accept. The armistice was to last until Whitsuntide, and Edward\r\nimmediately returned to England. He had not yet satisfied his subjects,\r\nand was again forced to meet his estates.\r\n\r\n    [1] _The Siege of Carlaverock_, ed. Nicolas (1828).\r\n\r\nA full parliament assembled on January 20, 1301, at Lincoln. The\r\nspecial business was to receive the report of the forest perambulation;\r\nand the first anticipation of the later custom of continuing the same\r\nparliament from one session to another can be discerned in the\r\ndirection to the sheriffs that they should return the same\r\nrepresentatives of the shires and boroughs as had attended the Lenten\r\nparliament of 1300, and only hold fresh elections in the case of such\r\nmembers as had died or become incapacitated. During the ten days that\r\nthe commons were in session stormy scenes occurred. Edward would only\r\npromise to agree to the disafforestments recommended by the\r\nperambulators, if the estates would assure him that he could do so,\r\nwithout violating his coronation oath or disinheriting his crown. The\r\nestates refused to undertake this grave responsibility, and a long\r\ncatalogue of their grievances was presented to Edward by Henry of\r\nKeighley, knight of the shire for Lancashire, and one of the first\r\nmembers of the third estate of whose individual action history has\r\npreserved any trace. The commons demanded a fresh confirmation of the\r\ncharters; the punishment of the royal ministers who had infringed them,\r\nor the _Articuli super cartas_ of the previous session, and the\r\ncompletion of the proposed disafforestments. In addition, the prelates\r\ndeclared that they could not assent to any tax being imposed upon the\r\nclergy contrary to the papal prohibition. Among the ministers specially\r\nsignalled out for attack was the treasurer, Bishop Walter Langton, and\r\nin this Edward discerned the influence of Winchelsea, for he was\r\nLangton's personal enemy. The king's disgust at the primate's action\r\nwas the more complete since Bishop Bek now arrayed himself on the side\r\nof the opposition. Edward showed his ill-will by consigning Henry of\r\nKeighley to prison. But the coalition was too formidable to be\r\nwithstood. The king agreed to all the secular demands of the estates,\r\naccepted the hated disafforestments and directed the re-issue of a\r\nfurther confirmation of the charters, but refused his assent to the\r\ndemand of the prelates. A grant of a fifteenth was then made, and\r\nEdward dismissed the popular representatives on January 30, retaining\r\nthe prelates and nobles for further business. On February 14, the last\r\nconfirmation of the charters concluded the long chapter of history,\r\nwhich had begun at Runnymede.\r\n\r\nEdward strove to separate his baronial and his clerical enemies, and\r\nfound an opportunity, which he was not slow to use, in the\r\nuncompromising papalism of Winchelsea. Boniface VIII. had no sooner\r\nsettled the relations of England and France than he threw himself with\r\nardour into an attempt to establish peace between England and Scotland.\r\nScottish emissaries, including perhaps Wallace himself, gave Boniface\r\ntheir version of the ancient relations of the two crowns. On June 27,\r\n1299, the pope issued the letter _Scimus, fili_, in which he claimed\r\nthat Scotland specially belonged to the apostolic see, on the ground\r\nthat it was converted through the relics of St. Andrew. He denied all\r\nfeudal dependence of Scotland on Edward, and explained away the\r\nsubmissions of 1291 as arising from such momentary fear as might fall\r\nupon the most steadfast. If Edward persisted in his claims, he was to\r\nsubmit them to the judgment of the Roman _curia_ within the next six\r\nmonths. In 1300 Winchelsea, who fully accepted the new papal doctrine,\r\nsought out Edward in the midst of the Carlaverock campaign and presented\r\nhim with Boniface's letter. Edward's hot temper fired up at the\r\narchbishop's ill-timed intervention, and subsequent military failures\r\nhad not smoothed over the situation. His wrath reached its climax when\r\nWinchelsea once more stirred up opposition in the Lincoln parliament,\r\nand his refusal of a demand, which the primate had astutely added to the\r\ncommons' requests, showed that he was prepared for war to the knife.\r\nEdward laid the papal letter before the earls and barons that still\r\ntarried with him at Lincoln. His appeal to their patriotism was not\r\nunsuccessful. A letter was drawn up, which was sealed, then and\r\nsubsequently, by more than a hundred secular magnates, in which Boniface\r\nwas roundly told that the King of England was in no wise bound to answer\r\nin the pope's court as to his rights over the realm of Scotland or as to\r\nany other temporal matter, and that the papal claim was unprecedented,\r\nand prejudicial to Edward's sovereignly. A longer historical statement\r\nwas composed by the king's order in answer to Boniface. It is not\r\ncertain that the two documents ever reached the pope, but they had great\r\neffect in influencing English opinion and in breaking down the alliance\r\nbetween the baronage and the ecclesiastical party.[1] Winchelsea's\r\ninfluence was fatally weakened, and the period of his overthrow was at\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n    [1] See, on the barons' letter, the _Ancestor_, for July and\r\n    October, 1903, and Jan., 1904.\r\n\r\nThe triumph over Winchelsea made Edward's position stronger than it had\r\nbeen during the first days of the Lincoln parliament. That assembly\r\nended amidst the festivities which attended the creation of Edward of\r\nCarnarvon as Prince of Wales, Earl of Chester, and Count of Ponthieu.\r\nThe new prince, already seventeen years of age, had made his first\r\ncampaign in the previous year. But all the pains that Edward took in\r\ntraining his son in warfare and in politics bore little fruit, and\r\nEdward of Carnarvon's introduction to active life was only to add\r\nanother trouble to the many that beset the king.\r\n\r\nWhen the truce with Scotland expired, in the summer of 1301, Edward\r\nagain led an army over the border, in which the Prince of Wales\r\nappeared, at the head of a large Welsh contingent. Little of military\r\nimportance happened. Edward remained in Scotland over the cold season,\r\nand kept his Christmas court at Linlithgow. Men and horses perished\r\namidst the rigours of the northern winter, and, before the end of\r\nJanuary, 1302, the king was glad to accept a truce, suggested by Philip\r\nof France, to last until the end of November. Immediately afterwards he\r\nwas called to the south by the negotiations for a permanent peace with\r\nFrance, which still hung fire despite his marriage to the French king's\r\nsister. The earlier stages of the negotiation were transacted at Rome,\r\nbut it was soon clear to Edward that no good would come to him from the\r\nintervention of the _curia_. The fundamental difficulty still lay in the\r\nrefusal of Philip to relax his grasp on Gascony. Not even the\r\nexaltation, consequent on the success of the famous jubilee of 1300,\r\nblinded Boniface to the patent fact that he dared not order the\r\nrestitution of Gascony. \"We cannot give you an award,\" declared the pope\r\nto the English envoys in 1300. \"If we pronounced in your favour, the\r\nFrench would not abide by it, and could not be compelled, for they would\r\nmake light of any penalty.\" \"What the French once lay hold of,\" he said\r\nagain, \"they never let go, and to have to do with the French is to have\r\nto do with the devil.\"[1] A year later Boniface could do no more than\r\nappeal to the crusading zeal of Edward not to allow his claim on a patch\r\nof French soil to stand between him and his vow. With such commonplaces\r\nthe papal mediation died away.\r\n\r\n    [1] See the remarkable report of the Bishop of Winchester to\r\n    Edward printed in _Engl. Hist. Review_, xvii. (1902), pp.\r\n    518-27.\r\n\r\nTwo events in 1302 indirectly contributed towards the establishment of\r\na permanent peace. These were the successful revolt of Flanders from\r\nFrench domination, and the renewed quarrel between Philip and Boniface.\r\nOn May 18, the Flemings, in the \"matins of Bruges,\" cruelly avenged\r\nthemselves for the oppressions which they had endured from Philip's\r\nofficials, and on July 11 the revolted townsfolk won the battle of\r\nCourtrai, in which their heavy armed infantry defeated the feudal\r\ncavalry of France, a victory of the same kind as that Wallace had\r\nvainly hoped to gain at Falkirk. Even before the Flemish rising, the\r\nreassertion of high sacerdotal doctrine in the bull _Ausculta, fili_\r\nhad renewed the strife between Boniface and the French king. A few\r\nmonths later the bull _Unam sanctam_ laid down with emphasis the\r\ndoctrine that those who denied that the temporal sword belongs to St.\r\nPeter were heretics, unmindful of the teachings of Christ. Thus began\r\nthe famous difference that went on with ever-increasing fury until the\r\noutrage at Anagni, on September 7, 1303, brought about the fall of\r\nBoniface and the overthrow of the Hildebrandine papacy. Meanwhile\r\nPhilip was devoting his best energies to constant, and not altogether\r\nvain, attempts to avenge the defeat of Courtrai, and re-establish his\r\nhold on Flanders. With these two affairs on his hands, it was useless\r\nfor him to persevere in his attempt to hold Gascony.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier stages of his quarrel with Philip, Boniface built great\r\nhopes on Edward's support, and strongly urged him to fight for holy\r\nChurch against the impious French king. But Edward had suffered too\r\nmuch from Boniface to fall into so obvious a trap. His hold over his\r\nown clergy was so firm that Winchelsea himself had no chance of taking\r\nup the papal call to battle. Thus it was that _Unam sanctam_ produced\r\nno such clerical revolt in England as _Clericis laicos_ had done. It\r\nwas Edward's policy to make use of Philip's necessities to win back\r\nGascony, and cut off all hope of French support from the Scottish\r\npatriots. Philip himself was the more disposed to agree with his\r\nbrother-in-law's wishes, because about Christmas, 1302, Bordeaux threw\r\noff the French yoke and called in the English. The best way to save\r\nFrench dignity was by timely concession. Accordingly, on May 20, 1303,\r\nthe definitive treaty of Paris was sealed, by which the two kings were\r\npledged to \"perpetual peace and friendship\". Gascony was restored, and\r\nEdward agreed that he, or his son, should perform liege homage for it.\r\nWith the discharge of this duty by the younger Edward at Amiens, in\r\n1304, the last stage of the pacification was accomplished. For the rest\r\nof the reign, England and France remained on cordial terms. Neither\r\nEdward nor Philip had resources adequate to the accomplishment of great\r\nschemes of foreign conquest. Though Edward got back Gascony, he owed\r\nit, not to his own power, but to the embarrassment of his rival.\r\n\r\nWhile completing his pacification with Philip the Fair, Edward was\r\nbusily engaged in establishing his power at home, at the expense of the\r\nclerical and baronial opposition, which had stood for so many years in\r\nthe way of the conquest of Scotland. Since the parliament of Lincoln,\r\nWinchelsea was no longer dangerous. He failed even to get Boniface on\r\nhis side in a scandalous attack which he instigated on Bishop Langton.\r\nHis constant efforts to enlarge his jurisdiction raised up enemies all\r\nover his diocese and province, and the mob of his cathedral city broke\r\nopen his palace, while he was in residence there. His inability to\r\nintroduce into England even a pale reflection of the struggle of Philip\r\nand the pope showed how clearly he had lost influence since the days of\r\n_Clericis laicos_. A more recent convert to higher clerical pretensions\r\nalso failed. Bishop Bek of Durham lost all his power, and was deprived\r\nof his temporalities by the king in 1302. Two years later the\r\ninsignificant Archbishop of York also incurred the royal displeasure,\r\nand was punished in the same fashion. With Durham, Norhamshire, and\r\nHexhamshire all in the royal hands, the road into Scotland was\r\ncompletely open.\r\n\r\nThe heavy hand of Edward fell upon earls as well as upon bishops. Even\r\nin the early days of his reign when none, save Gilbert of Gloucester,\r\ndared uplift the standard of opposition, Edward had not spared the\r\ngreatest barons in his efforts to eliminate the idea of tenure from\r\nEnglish political life. A subtle extension of his earlier policy began\r\nto emphasise the dependence of the landed dignitaries on his pleasure.\r\nThe extinction of several important baronial houses made this the\r\neasier, and Edward took care to retain escheats in his own hands, or at\r\nleast to entrust them only to persons of approved confidence. The old\r\nleaders of opposition were dead or powerless. Ralph of Monthermer, the\r\nsimple north-country knight who had won the hand of Joan of Acre, ruled\r\nover the Gloutester-Glamorgan inheritance on behalf of his wife and\r\nEdward's little grandson, Gilbert of Clare. The Earl of Hereford died\r\nin 1299, and in 1302 his son and successor, another Humphrey Bohun, was\r\nbribed by a marriage with the king's daughter, Elizabeth, the widowed\r\nCountess of Holland, to surrender his lands to the crown and receive\r\nthem back, like the Earl of Gloucester in 1290, entailed on the issue\r\nof himself and his consort. In the same year the childless earl\r\nmarshal, Roger Bigod, conscious of his inability to continue any longer\r\nhis struggle against royal assumptions and at variance with his brother\r\nand heir, made a similar surrender of his estates, which was the more\r\nhumiliating since the estate in tail, with which he was reinvested, was\r\nbound to terminate with his life. In 1306, on the marshal's death, the\r\nBigod inheritance lapsed to the crown. Much earlier than that, in 1293,\r\nEdward had extorted on her deathbed from the great heiress, Isabella of\r\nFors, Countess of Albemarle and Devon, the bequest of the Isle of Wight\r\nand the adjacent castle of Christchurch. In 1300, on the death of the\r\nking's childless cousin, Earl Edmund, the wealthy earldom of Cornwall\r\nescheated to the crown. To Edward's contemporaries the acquisition of\r\nthe earldoms of Norfolk and Cornwall seemed worthy to be put alongside\r\nthe conquests of Wales and Scotland.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] See John of London, _Commendatio lamentabilis_ in _Chron.\r\n    of Edw. I. and Edw. II._, ii., 8-9. See for the earldoms my\r\n    _Earldoms under Edward I._ in _Transactions of the Royal\r\n    Historical Society, new ser._, viii. (1894), 129-155.\r\n\r\nEven more important as adding to Edward's resources than these direct\r\nadditions to the royal domains, was the increasing dependence of the\r\nremaining earls upon the crown. His sons-in-law of Gloucester and\r\nHereford were entirely under his sway. In 1304 the aged Earl Warenne\r\nhad died, and in 1306 his grandson and successor was bound closely to\r\nthe royal policy by his marriage with Joan of Bar, Edward's\r\ngrand-daughter. In the same way Edward's young nephew, Thomas of\r\nLancaster, ruled over the three earldoms of Lancaster, Derby, and\r\nLeicester, and by his marriage to the daughter and heiress of Henry\r\nLacy, was destined to add to his immense estates the additional\r\nearldoms of Lincoln and Salisbury. Edward of Carnarvon was learning the\r\nart of government in Wales, Cheshire, and Ponthieu. The policy of\r\nconcentrating the higher baronial dignities in the royal family was no\r\nnovelty, but Edward carried it out more systematically and successfully\r\nthan any of his predecessors. He reaped the immediate advantages of his\r\ndexterity in the extinction of baronial opposition and in the zeal of\r\nthe baronial levies against the Scots during the concluding years of\r\nhis reign. Yet the later history of the Middle Ages bears witness to\r\nthe grievous dangers to the wielder of the royal power which lurked\r\nbeneath a system so attractive in appearance.\r\n\r\nThe truce with the Scots ended in November, 1302, and Edward despatched\r\na strong force to the north under John Segrave. On February 24, 1303,\r\nSegrave, attacked unexpectedly by the enemy at Roslin, near Edinburgh,\r\nsuffered a severe defeat. The conclusion of the treaty of Paris gave\r\nEdward the opportunity for avenging the disaster. He summoned his\r\nlevies to assemble at Roxburgh for Whitsuntide and, a fortnight before\r\nthat time, appeared in person in Tweeddale. After seven weary years of\r\nwaiting and failure, he was at last in a position to wear down the\r\nobstinate Scots by the same systematic and deliberate policy that had\r\nwon for him the principality of Wales. The invasion of Scotland was\r\nhenceforth to continue as long as the Scottish resistance. Adequate\r\nresources were procured to enable the royal armies to hold the field,\r\nand a politic negotiation with the foreign merchants resulted in a\r\n_carta mercatoria_ by which additional customs were imposed upon\r\nEnglish exports. These imposts, known as the \"new and small customs,\"\r\nas opposed to the \"old and great customs\" established in 1275, were not\r\nsanctioned by parliamentary grant: but for the moment they provoked no\r\nopposition. Thus Edward was equipped both with men and money for his\r\nundertaking. At last the true conquest of Scotland began.\r\n\r\nNo attempt was made in the Lothians to stop Edward's advance, but the\r\nScots, under the regent, John Comyn of Badenoch, made a vigorous effort\r\nto hold the line of the Forth against him. Their plan seemed to promise\r\nwell, for Stirling castle was still in Scottish hands. Edward crossed\r\nthe river by a ford, and all organised efforts to oppose him at once\r\nceased. Prudently leaving Stirling to itself for the present, he\r\nhurried to Perth. After spending most of June and July at Perth, he led\r\nhis army northwards, nearly following the line of his advance in 1296,\r\nthrough Perth, Brechin, and Aberdeen, to Banff and Elgin. The most\r\nremote point reached was Kinloss, a few miles west of Elgin, in which\r\nneighbourhood he spent much of September. Then he slowly retraced his\r\nsteps and took up his winter quarters at Dunfermline. In all this long\r\nprogress, the only energetic resistance which Edward encountered was at\r\nBrechin. Flushed with his triumph, he ordered Stirling to be besieged,\r\nand from April, 1304, directed the operations himself. The garrison\r\nheld out with the utmost gallantry, but at last a breach was effected\r\nin the walls, and on July 24 the defenders laid down their arms. Long\r\nbefore the Scots people despaired of withstanding the invader, the\r\nnobles grew cold in the defence of their country. In February, 1304,\r\nthe regent and many of the earls made their submission. It was more\r\nthan suspected that this result was brought about by the threat of\r\nEdward to divide their lands among his English followers. But on Comyn\r\nand his friends showing a desire to yield, the king readily promised\r\nthem their lives and estates. Believing that his task was over, Edward\r\nreturned to England in August after an absence of nearly fifteen\r\nmonths. He crossed the Humber early in December, kept his Christmas\r\ncourt at Lincoln, and reached London late in February. As a sign of the\r\ncompletion of the conquest, he ordered that the law courts, which since\r\n1297 had been established at York, should resume their sessions in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nA few heroes still upheld the independence of Scotland. Foremost among\r\nthem was Sir William Wallace, who, since his mission to France in 1298,\r\nhad disappeared from history. The submission of the barons to Edward\r\ngave him another chance. He took a strenuous part in the struggle of\r\n1303-4, and he was specially exempted from the easy pardons with which\r\nEdward purchased the submission of the greater nobles. It was the\r\ndaring and skill of Wallace that prolonged the Scots' struggle until\r\nthe spring of 1305. But he was then once more an outlaw and a fugitive,\r\nonly formidable by his hold over the people, and by the possibility\r\nthat the smallest spark of resistance might at any time be blown into a\r\nflame. At last he was captured through the zeal, or treachery, of a\r\nScot in Edward's service. In August, Wallace was despatched to London\r\nto stand a public trial for treason, sedition, sacrilege, and murder.\r\nHe denied that he had ever become Edward's subject, but did not escape\r\nconviction. With his execution, the last stage of Edward's triumph in\r\nScotland was accomplished. Though the full measure of Wallace's fame\r\nbelongs to a later age rather than his own, yet it was a sure instinct\r\nthat made the Scottish people celebrate him as the popular hero of\r\ntheir struggle for independence. His courage, persistency, and daring\r\nstands in marked contrast to the self-seeking opportunism of the great\r\nnobles, who afterwards appropriated the results of his endeavours. Yet\r\nwe can hardly blame Edward for making an example of him, when he fell\r\ninto his power. Even if Wallace had successfully evaded the oath of\r\nfealty to Edward, it is scarcely reasonable to expect that the king\r\nwould consider this technical plea as availing against his doctrine\r\nthat all Scots were necessarily his subjects since the submission of\r\n1296. It was Wallace's glory that he fought his fight and paid the\r\npenalty of it.\r\n\r\nA full parliament of the three estates sat with the king at Westminster\r\nfrom February 28 to March 21, 1305. The proceedings of this assembly are\r\nknown with a fulness exceeding that of the record of any of the other\r\nparliaments of the reign.[1] Among the matters enumerated in the writs\r\nas specially demanding attention was the \"establishment of our realm of\r\nScotland\". Three Scottish magnates, Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow,\r\nRobert Bruce, Earl of Carrick, and John Mowbray were particularly called\r\nupon to give their advice as to how Scotland was to be represented in a\r\nlater parliament, in which the plans for its future government were to\r\nbe drawn up. They informed the king that two bishops, two abbots, two\r\nbarons, and two representatives of the commons, one from the south of\r\nthe Forth and the other from the north thereof, would be sufficient for\r\nthis purpose. This further \"parliament\" assembled on September 15, three\r\nweeks after the execution of Wallace. It consisted simply of twenty\r\ncouncillors of Edward, and the ten Scottish delegates. From the joint\r\ndeliberations of these thirty sprang the \"ordinance made by the lord\r\nking for the establishment of the land of Scotland\".\r\n\r\n    [1] See _Memoranda, de parliamento_ (1305), ed. F.W. Maitland\r\n    (Rolls Series).\r\n\r\nFollowing the general lines of the settlement of the principality of\r\nWales, the ordinance combined Edward's direct lordship over Scotland\r\nwith a legal and administrative system separate from that of England.\r\nJohn of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, the king's sister's son, was made\r\nEdward's lieutenant and warden of Scotland, and under him were a\r\nchancellor, a chamberlain, and a controller. Scotland was to be split\r\nup for judicial purposes into districts corresponding to its racial and\r\npolitical divisions. Four pairs of justices were appointed for each of\r\nthese regions, two for Lothian, two for Galloway and the south-west,\r\ntwo for the lands \"between Forth and the mountains,\" that is the\r\nLowland districts of the north-east, and two for the lands \"beyond the\r\nmountains,\" that is for the Highlands and islands. Sheriffs \"natives\r\neither of England or Scotland\" were nominated for each of the shires,\r\nand it was significant that the great majority of them were Scots and\r\nthat the hereditary sheriffdoms of the older system were still\r\ncontinued. The \"custom of the Scots and the Welsh,\" that is the Celtic\r\nlaws of the Highlanders and the Strathclyde Welsh, was \"henceforth\r\nprohibited and disused\". John of Brittany was to \"assemble the good\r\npeople of Scotland in a convenient place\" where \"the laws of King David\r\nand the amendments by other kings\" were to be rehearsed, and such of\r\nthese laws as are \"plainly against God and reason\" were to be reformed,\r\nall doubtful matters being referred to the judgment of Edward. The\r\nking's lieutenant was bidden to \"remove such persons as might disturb\r\nthe peace\" to the south of the Trent, but their deportation was to be\r\nin \"courteous fashion\" and after taking the advice of the \"good people\r\nof Scotland\". Care for the preservation of the peace, and for\r\nadministrative reform, is seen in the oath imposed upon officials and\r\nin the pains taken to secure the custody of the castles. The Scots\r\nparliament was to be retained, and recent precedents also suggested the\r\nprobability of Scottish representation in the parliament of England. If\r\nScotland were to be ruled by Edward at all, it would have been\r\ndifficult to devise a wiser scheme for its administration. Yet the\r\nScottish love of independence was not to be bartered away for better\r\ngovernment. Within six months the new constitution was overthrown, and\r\nthe chief part in its destruction was taken by the Scots by whose\r\nadvice Edward had drawn it up.\r\n\r\nEdward at last felt himself in a position to take his long deferred\r\nrevenge on Winchelsea. The primate still kept aloof from the councils of\r\nthe king, and his spirit was as irreconcilable as ever. He gained his\r\nlast victory in the Lenten parliament of 1305, when he prevented the\r\npromulgation of a statute, passed on the petition of the laity, but\r\nagreed to by all the estates, which forbade taxes on ecclesiastical\r\nproperty involving the exportation of money out of the country.[1] At\r\nthis moment the long vacancy of the papacy, which followed the\r\npontificate of Benedict XI., Boniface VIII.'s short-lived successor, had\r\nnot yet come to an end. Soon, however, Winchelsea's zeal on behalf of\r\npapal taxation was to be ill requited. On June 5, 1305, Bertrand de\r\nGoth, a Gascon nobleman who since 1299 had been archbishop of Bordeaux,\r\nwas elected to the papacy as Clement V., through the management of\r\nPhilip the Fair. A dependant of the King of France and a subject of the\r\nKing of England, the new pope showed a complaisance towards kings which\r\nstood in strong contrast to the ultramontane austerity of his\r\npredecessors. He refused to visit Italy, received the papal crown at\r\nLyons, and spent the first years of his pontificate in Poitou and\r\nGascony. Ultimately establishing himself at Avignon, he began that\r\nseventy years of Babylonish captivity of the apostolic see which greatly\r\ndegraded the papacy. Though Clement's main concern was to fulfil the\r\nexacting conditions which, as it was believed, Philip had imposed upon\r\nhim, he was almost as subservient to Edward as to the King of France.\r\nHis deference to his natural lord enabled Edward to renounce the most\r\nirksome of the obligations which he had incurred to his subjects, to\r\npunish Winchelsea, and to restrain Roman authority by laws which\r\nanticipate the legislation of the age of Edward III.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Memoranda de parliamento_, preface, p. li.

II._, i., xcix.-cxiii.\r\n\r\nAt Clement V.'s coronation at Lyons, in November, England was\r\nrepresented by Winchelsea's old enemy, Bishop Walter Langton, and by\r\nthe Earl of Lincoln. The first result of their work was the\r\npromulgation, on December 29, of the bull _Regalis devotionis_, by\r\nwhich the pope annulled the additions made to the charters in 1297 and\r\nsucceeding years, and dispensed Edward from the oath which he had taken\r\nto observe them, on the ground that it was in conflict with his\r\ncoronation vows. Next year Edward took advantage of this bull to revoke\r\nthe disafforestments made by the parliament of Lincoln in 1301. It may\r\nbe a sign either of the moderation, or of the well-grounded fears of\r\nthe king, that he made no further use of the papal absolution. But,\r\nlike his father and grandfather, he used the papal authority to set\r\naside his plighted word, and his conduct in this respect suggests that\r\nit was well for England that the renewal of the Scottish troubles\r\nreduced for the rest of the reign the temptation, which the bull held\r\nout to him, to play fast and loose with the liberties of his subjects.\r\nThe standards of contemporary morality were not, however, infringed by\r\nEdward's action, dishonourable and undignified as it seems to us of\r\nlater times.\r\n\r\nWinchelsea's turn was at last come. On February 12, 1306,\r\nClement suspended him from his office, and summoned him to appear\r\nbefore the _curia_. On March 25 the archbishop humbled himself before\r\nEdward and begged for his protection. But the king overwhelmed him with\r\nreproaches and refused to show him any mercy. Within two months, the\r\nprimate took ship for France and made his way to the papal court, which\r\nwas then established at Bordeaux. He remained in exile, though in the\r\nEnglish king's dominions, for the rest of Edward's life. A less harsh\r\npunishment was meted out to the Bishop of Durham, who then came back\r\nfrom the court of Clement with the magnificent title of Patriarch of\r\nJerusalem. For a second time Edward laid violent hands upon the rich\r\ntemporalities of the see, and Bek, like Winchelsea, remained under a\r\ncloud for the remainder of the reign.\r\n\r\nClement expected to be paid for yielding so much to the king. A papal\r\nagent, William de Testa, was sent to England, and to him Edward gave\r\nthe administration of the temporalities of Canterbury. William's energy\r\nin collecting first-fruits aroused a storm of opposition from the\r\nclergy. The laity, disgusted to find that the king was negotiating for\r\nthe transference of a crusading tenth to himself, associated themselves\r\nwith their protest. Clement thereupon despatched the Cardinal Peter of\r\nSpain to England, that he might attempt to arrange a general\r\npacification, and complete the marriage of the Prince of Wales to\r\nIsabella of France, which had been agreed upon in 1303. Before the\r\ncardinal's arrival, Edward's last parliament met in January, 1307, at\r\nCarlisle. The renewed disturbances in Scotland necessitated a meeting\r\non the border, but the main transactions of the estates bore upon\r\nmatters ecclesiastical. The lords and commons joined in demanding from\r\nthe king a remedy against the oppressions of the apostolic see. A\r\nspirited and strongly worded protest was addressed to the pope. Nor\r\nwere the estates contented with mere remonstrances. The statute of\r\nCarlisle renewed the abortive measure of 1305 _De asportis\r\nreligiosorum_, by prohibiting tallages of religious houses being sent\r\nout of the realm. Had the petition of the estates been drafted into a\r\nstatute, the parliament of Carlisle would have anticipated the statute\r\nof _Praemunire_ and many other anti-papal enactments. But Peter of\r\nSpain arrived, and Edward thought it injudicious to provoke a contest\r\nwith the papacy. Even the petition actually approved was left in\r\nsuspense to await further negotiations between the king and the\r\ncardinal. Before any decision was come to, Edward died, and this\r\nanti-Roman movement, like so many which had preceded it, resulted in\r\nlittle more than brave words. When, two generations later, a more\r\nresolute temper seized upon king and estates, they fell back upon the\r\npetitions and proceedings of the parliament of Carlisle for precedents\r\nfor resisting the papal authority. With all its pitiful conclusion,\r\nEdward's ecclesiastical policy at least marks a step in advance upon\r\nthe dependent attitude of Henry III.\r\n\r\nIn the period of peace after the conquest of Scotland, Edward busied\r\nhimself with strengthening the administration of his own kingdom and\r\nwith enforcing the laws against violence and outrage. Under the\r\nstrongest of medieval kings, the state of society was very disorderly,\r\nand even a ruler like Edward had often to be contented with holding up\r\nin his legislation an ideal of conduct which he was powerless to\r\nenforce in detail. Complaints had long been made that the greater\r\nnobles encroached upon poor men's inheritances, that gangs of marauders\r\nranged over the country, wreaking every sort of violence and outrage,\r\nand that the law courts would give no redress to the sufferers from\r\nsuch outrageous deeds, since judges and juries were alike terrorised by\r\novermighty offenders and dared not administer equal justice.\r\nAccordingly in the Lenten parliament of 1305 was drawn up the ordinance\r\nof Trailbaston, by which the king was empowered to issue writs of\r\ninquiry, addressed to special justices in the various shires, and\r\nauthorising them to take vigorous action against these _trailbastons_,\r\nor men with clubs, whose outrages had become so grievous. It was not so\r\nmuch a new law as an administrative act; but it formed a precedent for\r\nlater times, and the energy of the justices of trailbaston effected a\r\nreal, if temporary, improvement in the condition of the country. So\r\nimportant was the measure that a chronicler calls the year in which\r\nthis was enacted the \"year of trailbaston\".[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] _Liber de antiquis legibus_, p. 250.\r\n\r\nNever did Edward's prospects seem brighter than in the early days of\r\n1306. Scotland was obedient; the French alliance was firmly cemented;\r\nthe pope was complacent; the Archbishop of Canterbury was in exile and\r\nthe Bishop of Durham in disgrace; the commons were grateful for the\r\nbetter order secured by the commissions of trailbaston, and the king\r\nhad in the papal absolution a weapon in reserve, which he could always\r\nuse against a renewal of baronial opposition, though, for the moment,\r\nneither nobles nor commons seemed likely to give trouble. Once more\r\nthere was some talk of Edward leading a crusade, and the French lawyer,\r\nPeter Dubois, at this time dedicated to him the first draft of his\r\nremarkable treatise on the recovery of the Holy Land.[1] Nor did the\r\nproject seem altogether impracticable. Though Edward was sixty-seven\r\nyears of age, he remained slim, vigorous and straight as a palm tree.\r\nHe could mount his horse and ride to the hunt or the field with the\r\nactivity of youth. His eyes were not dimmed with age and his teeth were\r\nstill firm in his jaws.[2] The worst trouble which immediately beset him,\r\nwas the undutiful conduct of the young Prince of Wales, who foolishly\r\nquarrelled with Bishop Langton, and preferred to amuse himself with\r\nunworthy favourites rather than submit himself to the severe training\r\nin arms and affairs to which Edward had long striven to inure him. When\r\nall thus seemed favourable, a sudden storm burst in Scotland which\r\nplunged the old king into renewed troubles.\r\n\r\n    [1] _De recuperatione terre sancte_, ed. C.V. Langlois (1891).\r\n\r\n    [2] John of London, _Commendatio lamentabilis_, pp. 5-6.\r\n\r\nIn 1304 Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick, became by his father's death the\r\nhead of his house. Though he had long adhered to the regency which had\r\ngoverned Scotland in Balliol's name, he had now made terms with Edward,\r\nand had taken a conspicuous part in bringing about the pacification of\r\nScotland under its new constitution. But the double policy, which had\r\ninvolved him in the shifts and tergiversations of his earlier career,\r\nstill dominated the mind of the ambitious earl. At the moment of his\r\nsubmission to Edward, he entered into an intimate alliance with Bishop\r\nLamberton of St. Andrews, the old partisan of Wallace. Lamberton was\r\nthen, like Bruce, on Edward's side, and as John of Brittany had not yet\r\npersonally taken up his new charge, the blind confidence of Edward\r\nentrusted him with the foremost place among the commissioners who acted\r\nas wardens of Scotland during the king's lieutenant's absence. Bruce,\r\nstill remembering his grandfather's claim on the throne, welcomed the\r\ndefinitive setting aside of Balliol. While Edward believed that\r\nScotland was quietening down under its new constitution, Bruce was\r\nsecretly conspiring with the Scottish magnates, with a view to making\r\nhimself king. His chief difficulty was with the late regent, John Comyn\r\nthe Red, lord of Badenoch. The Bruces and the Comyns had long been at\r\nvariance, and the Red Comyn, who was the nephew of the deposed King\r\nJohn, regarded himself as the representative of the Balliol claim to\r\nthe throne, and was not unmindful how his father had withdrawn his\r\npretensions in 1291 rather than divide the Balliol interest. Meanwhile\r\nthe antagonism of the two houses was the best safeguard for the\r\ncontinuance of Edward's rule.\r\n\r\nBruce was violent as well as able and ambitious. He invited Comyn to a\r\nconference for January 10, 1306, in the Franciscan friary at Dumfries.\r\nOn that day the king's justices were holding the assizes in the castle,\r\nand Brace and Comyn, with a few followers, met in the cloister of the\r\nconvent. Hot words were exchanged, and Bruce drew his sword and wounded\r\nComyn. The lord of Badenoch took refuge in the church, and some of\r\nBruce's friends followed him and slew him on the steps of the high\r\naltar. This cruel murder involved a violent breach between Bruce and\r\nthe king. The earl took to the hills, declared himself the champion of\r\nnational independence, and renewed his claim to the crown. He was\r\njoined by a great multitude of the people and by a certain number of\r\nthe magnates. Conspicuous among the latter was Bishop Wishart of\r\nGlasgow, who broke his sixth oath of fealty, using the timber given him\r\nby Edward for building the steeple of his cathedral in constructing\r\nmilitary engines to besiege the castles which were still held for the\r\nEnglish king. Before long Bishop Lamberton, the chief of the Edwardian\r\ngovernment, also went over. The support of the two bishops enabled\r\nBruce to be crowned on March 25 at Scone. All Scotland was soon in\r\nrevolt, and only the garrisons and a few magnates remained faithful to\r\nEdward.\r\n\r\nNews of the death of Comyn and the revolt of Bruce reached Edward,\r\nwhile engaged in hunting in Dorset and Wiltshire. He at once called\r\nupon Church and State to unite against the sacreligious murderer and\r\ntraitor. Clement V. excommunicated the Earl of Carrick, and deprived\r\nLamberton and Wishart of their bishoprics. The warlike zeal of the\r\nEnglish barons was stimulated by liberal grants of the forfeited\r\nestates of Bruce and his partisans. Feeling the infirmities of age\r\ncoming upon him, Edward saw that his best chance of success was to\r\ninspire his son with something of his spirit. The Prince of Wales\r\naccordingly received a grant of Gascony, and on Whitsunday, May 22, was\r\ndubbed knight at Westminster along with over two hundred other\r\naspirants to arms. A magnificent feast in Westminster Hall succeeded\r\nthe ceremony. Two swans, adorned with golden chains, were brought in,\r\nand the old king set to all the revellers the example of vowing on the\r\nswans to revenge the murder of Comyn. Edward swore that when he had\r\nexpiated this wrong to Holy Church, he would never more bear arms\r\nagainst Christian man, but would immediately turn his steps towards the\r\nHoly Land to redeem the Holy Sepulchre. The Prince of Wales' vow was\r\nnever to rest two nights in the same spot until he had reached Scotland\r\nto assist his father in his purpose. Then all the young knights were\r\ndespatched northwards to overthrow the Scottish pretender.\r\n\r\nA liberal grant from the estates facilitated the military preparations.\r\nBut since the beginning of the year, Edward's strength had rapidly\r\nbroken. He was no longer able to ride, and his movements were\r\nconsequently very tedious. His army gathered together with more than\r\nthe usual slowness, and Aymer of Valence, Earl of Pembroke, the king's\r\ncousin, was sent forward as warden of Scotland to meet Bruce with such\r\nforces as were ready. On June 26 Aymer fell upon Bruce at Methven, near\r\nPerth, and inflicted a severe defeat upon him. The power of the\r\npretender died away as rapidly as it had arisen. The Bishops of St.\r\nAndrews and Glasgow were made prisoners, and Bruce's brothers, wife,\r\nand daughter fell into the enemy's hands. The brothers were promptly\r\nbeheaded, though one of them was an ecclesiastic, and the ladies were\r\nconfined in English nunneries. Bruce himself fled to Kintyre, and\r\nthence to Rathlin island, off the coast of Antrim.\r\n\r\nEdward went north in July, and, after a long stay in Northumberland,\r\ntook up his quarters early in October with the Austin canons of\r\nLanercost, near Carlisle. There he remained for above five months. In\r\nJanuary, 1307, the parliament, whose anti-clerical policy has already\r\nbeen recounted, assembled at Carlisle, and remained in session until\r\nMarch. With the spring, Brace crossed over from Ireland, and\r\nre-appeared in his own lands in the south-west. In May he revenged the\r\nrout of Methven by inflicting a bloody check on Aymer of Valence near\r\nAyr, and within three days gained another victory over Edward's\r\nson-in-law, Earl Ralph of Gloucester. These blows only spurred on\r\nEdward to increased efforts. The levies were summoned to meet at\r\nCarlisle and, regardless of his infirmities, the old king resolved to\r\nlead his troops in person. On July 3 he once more mounted his horse and\r\nstarted for the border. But his constitution could not respond to the\r\ndemands made on it by his unbroken spirit. After a journey of two miles\r\nhe was forced to rest for the night. Next day he could only traverse a\r\nsimilar distance, and his exertions so fatigued him that he was\r\ncompelled to remain at his lodgings all the following day. This repose\r\nenabled him to make his way, on July 6, to Burgh-on-Sands, less than\r\nseven miles from Carlisle, where he spent the night. On July 7, as he\r\nwas being raised in his bed by his attendants to take his morning meal,\r\nhe fell back in their arms and expired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nGAVESTON, THE ORDAINERS, AND BANNOCKBURN.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward of Carnarvon was over twenty-three years of age when he became\r\nking. Tall, graceful, and handsome, with magnificent health and\r\nexceptional bodily strength, the young king was, so far as externals\r\nwent, almost as fine a man as his father. Yet no one could have been\r\nmore absolutely destitute of all those qualities which constitute\r\nEdward I.'s claims to greatness. An utter want of serious purpose\r\nblasted his whole career. It was in vain that his father subjected him\r\nto a careful training in statecraft and in military science. Though not\r\nlacking in intelligence, the young prince from the first to the last\r\nconcerned himself with nothing but his own amusements. A confirmed\r\ngambler and a deep drinker, Edward showed a special bent for unkingly\r\nand frivolous diversions. Save in his devotion for the chase, his\r\ntastes had nothing in common with the high-born youths with whom he was\r\neducated. He showed himself a coward on the battlefield, and shirked\r\neven the mimic warfare of the tournament. He repaid the contempt and\r\ndislike of his own class by withdrawing himself from the society of the\r\nnobles, and associating himself with buffoons, singers, play-actors,\r\ncoachmen, ditchers, watermen, sailors, and smiths. Of the befitting\r\ncomrades of his youth, the only one of the higher aristocracy with whom\r\nhe had any true intimacy was his nephew, Gilbert of Clare, while the\r\nonly member of his household for whom he showed real affection was the\r\nGascon knight, Peter of Gaveston.[1] Attributing his son's levity to\r\nGaveston's corrupting influence, the old king had banished the foreign\r\nfavourite early in 1307. But no change in his surroundings could stir\r\nup the prince's frivolous nature to fulfil the duties of his station.\r\nEdward's most kingly qualities were love of fine clothes and of\r\nceremonies. Passionately fond of rowing, driving, horse-breeding, and\r\nthe rearing of dogs, his ordinary occupations were those of the athlete\r\nor the artisan. He was skilful with his hands, and an excellent\r\nmechanic, proficient at the anvil and the forge, and proud of his skill\r\nin digging ditches and thatching roofs. Interested in music, and\r\ndevoted to play-acting, he was badly educated, taking the coronation\r\noath in the French form provided for a king ignorant of Latin. Vain,\r\nirritable, and easily moved to outbursts of childish wrath, he was\r\nhalf-conscious of the weakness of his will, and was never without a\r\nfavourite, whose affection compensated him for his subjects' contempt.\r\nThe household of so careless a master was disorderly beyond the\r\nordinary measure of the time. While Edward irritated the nobles by his\r\nneglect of their counsel, he vexed the commons by the exactions of his\r\npurveyors.\r\n\r\n    [1] That is Gabaston, dep. Basses Pyrénées, cant. Morlaas.\r\n\r\nThe task which lay before Edward might well have daunted a stronger\r\nman. The old king had failed in the great purpose of his life. Scotland\r\nwas in full revolt and had found a man able to guide her destinies. The\r\ncrown was deeply in debt; the exchequer was bare of supplies, and the\r\nrevenues both of England and Gascony were farmed by greedy and\r\nunpopular companies of Italian bankers, such as the Frescobaldi of\r\nFlorence, the king's chief creditors. The nobles, though restrained by\r\nthe will of the old king, still cherished the ideals of the age of the\r\nBarons' War, and were convinced that the best way to rule England was\r\nto entrust the machinery of the central government, which Edward I. had\r\nelaborated with so much care, to the control of a narrow council of\r\nearls and prelates. Winchelsea, though broken in health, looked forward\r\nin his banishment to the renewal of the alliance of baronage and\r\nclergy, and to the reassertion of hierarchical ideals. The papal\r\n_curia_, already triumphant in the last days of the reign of the dead\r\nking, was anticipating a return to the times of Henry III, when every\r\ndignity of the English Church was at its mercy. The strenuous endeavour\r\nwhich had marked the last reign gave place to the extreme of\r\nnegligence.\r\n\r\nEdward at once broke with the policy of his father. After receiving, at\r\nCarlisle, the homage of the English magnates, he crossed the Solway to\r\nDumfries, where such Scottish barons as had not joined Robert Bruce\r\ntook oaths of fealty to him. He soon relinquished the personal conduct\r\nof the war, and travelled slowly to Westminster on the pretext of\r\nfollowing his father's body to its last resting-place. He replaced his\r\nfather's ministers by dependants of his own. Bishop Walter Langton, the\r\nchief minister of the last years of Edward I., was singled out for\r\nspecial vengeance. He was stripped of his offices, robbed of his\r\ntreasure, and thrown into close confinement, without any regard to the\r\nimmunities of a churchman from secular jurisdiction. Langton's place as\r\ntreasurer was given to Walter Reynolds, an illiterate clerk, who had\r\nwon the chief place in Edward's household through his skill in\r\ntheatricals. Ralph Baldock, Bishop of London, was replaced in the\r\nchancery by John Langton, Bishop of Chichester. The barons of the\r\nexchequer, the justices of the high courts, and the other ministers of\r\nthe old king were removed in favour of more complacent successors.\r\nSignal favour was shown to all who had fallen under Edward I.'s\r\ndispleasure. Bishop Bek, of Durham, was restored to his palatinate, and\r\nthe road to return opened to Winchelsea, though ill-health detained him\r\non the Continent for some time longer. Conspicuous among the returned\r\nexiles was Peter of Gaveston, whom the king welcomed with the warmest\r\naffection. He at once invested his \"brother Peter\" with the rich\r\nearldom of Cornwall, which the old king, with the object of conferring\r\nit on one of his sons by his second marriage, had kept in his hands\r\nsince Earl Edmund's death. A little later Edward married the favourite\r\nto his niece, Margaret of Clare, the eldest sister of Earl Gilbert of\r\nGloucester. Of the tried comrades of Edward I. the only one who\r\nremained in authority was Henry Lacy, Earl of Lincoln. The abandonment\r\nof the Scottish campaign soon followed. It was no wonder that the Scots\r\nlords, who had performed homage to Edward at Dumfries, began to turn to\r\nBruce. Already king of the Scottish commons, Robert was in a fair way\r\nto become accepted by the whole people.\r\n\r\nThe readiness with which the barons acquiesced in Edward's reversal of\r\nhis father's policy shows that they had regarded the late king's action\r\nwith little favour. Lincoln, the wisest and most influential of the\r\nearls, even found reasons for the grant of Cornwall to Gaveston, and\r\nkept in check his son-in-law, Earl Thomas of Lancaster, who was the\r\nmost disposed to grumble at the elevation of the Gascon favourite.\r\nGilbert of Gloucester was but newly come to his earldom. He was\r\npersonally attached to the king, his old playmate and uncle, and was\r\nnot unfriendly to his Gascon brother-in-law. The recent concentration\r\nof the great estates in the hands of a few individuals gave these three\r\nearls a position of overwhelming importance both in the court and in\r\nthe country, and with their good-will Edward was safe. But the weakness\r\nof the king and the rashness of the favourite soon caused murmurs to\r\narise.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1308 Edward crossed over to France, leaving Gaveston as\r\nregent, and was married on January 25, at Boulogne, to Philip the\r\nFair's daughter Isabella, a child of twelve, to whom he had been\r\nplighted since 1298. The marriage was attended by the French king and a\r\ngreat gathering of the magnates of both countries. Opportunity was\r\ntaken of the meeting for Edward to perform homage for Aquitaine. After\r\nthe arrival of the royal couple in England, their coronation took place\r\non February 25. Time had been when the reign began with the king's\r\ncrowning; but Edward had taken up every royal function immediately on\r\nhis father's death, and set a precedent to later sovereigns by dating\r\nhis own accession from the day succeeding the decease of his\r\npredecessor. The coronation ceremony, minutely recorded, provided\r\nprecedents for later ages. It was some recognition of the work of the\r\nlast generation that the coronation oath was somewhat more rigid and\r\ninvolved a more definite recognition of the rights of the community\r\nthan on earlier occasions. Winchelsea was still abroad, and the\r\nhallowing was performed by Henry Woodlock, Bishop of Winchester.\r\n\r\nDiscontent was already simmering. Not even Lincoln's weighty influence\r\ncould overcome the irritation of the earls at the elevation of the\r\nGascon knight into their circle. The very virtues of the vigorous\r\nfavourite turned to his discredit. At a tournament given by him, at his\r\nown castle of Wallingford, to celebrate his marriage with the king's\r\nniece, the new-made earl, with a party of valiant knights, challenged a\r\ntroop, which included the Earls of Hereford, Warenne, and Arundel, and\r\nutterly discomfited his rivals.[1] The victory of the upstart over\r\nmagnates of such dignity was accounted for by treachery, and the\r\nprohibition of a coronation tournament, probably a simple measure of\r\npolice, was ascribed to the unwillingness of Peter to give his opponents\r\na legitimate opportunity of vindicating their skill. There had been much\r\nresentment at Gaveston's appointment as regent during the king's absence\r\nin France. A further outburst of indignation followed when the Gascon,\r\nmagnificently arrayed and bedecked with jewels, bore the crown of St.\r\nEdward in the coronation procession. The queen's uncles, who had\r\nescorted her to her new home, left England disgusted that Edward's love\r\nfor Gaveston led him to neglect his bride, and the want of reserve shown\r\nin the personal dealings of the king and his \"idol\" suggested the worst\r\ninterpretation of their relations, though this is against the weight of\r\nevidence. Rumours spread that the favourite had laid hands on the vast\r\ntreasures which Bishop Walter Langton had deposited at the New Temple,\r\nand had extorted from the king even larger sums, which he had sent to\r\nhis kinsfolk in Gascony by the agency of the Italian farmers of the\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Ann. Paulini_, p. 258, and Monk of Malmesbury, p. 156, are\r\n    to be preferred to Trokelowe, p. 65.\r\n\r\nGaveston was a typical Gascon, vain, loquacious, and ostentatious,\r\nproud of his own ready wit and possessed of a fatal talent for sharp\r\nand bitter sayings. He seems to have been a brave and generous soldier.\r\nThere is little proof that he was specially vicious or incompetent,\r\nand, had he been allowed time to establish himself, he might well have\r\nbeen the parent of a noble house, as patriotic and as narrowly English\r\nas the Valence lords of Pembroke had become in the second generation.\r\nBut his sudden elevation rather turned his head, and the dull but\r\ndignified English earls were soon mortally offended by his airs of\r\nsuperiority, and by his intervention between them and the sovereign.\r\n\"If,\" wrote the annalist of St. Paul's, London, \"one of the earls or\r\nmagnates sought any special favour of the king, the king forthwith sent\r\nhim to Peter, and whatever Peter said or ordered at once took place,\r\nand the king ratified it. Hence the whole people grew indignant that\r\nthere should be two kings in one kingdom, one the king in name, the\r\nother the king in reality.\" Gaveston's vanity was touched by the sullen\r\nhostility of the earls. He returned their suspicion by an openly\r\nexpressed contempt. He amused himself and the king by devising\r\nnicknames for them. Thomas of Lancaster was the old pig or the\r\nplay-actor, Aymer of Pembroke was Joseph the Jew, Gilbert of Gloucester\r\nwas the cuckoo, and Guy of Warwick was the black dog of Arden. Such\r\njests were bitterly resented. \"If he call me dog,\" said Warwick on\r\nhearing of the insult, \"I will take care to bite him.\" The barons\r\nformed an association, bound by oath to drive Gaveston into exile and\r\ndeprive him of his earldom. All over the country there were secret\r\nmeetings and eager preparations for war. The outlook became still more\r\nalarming when the Earl of Lincoln at last changed his policy. Convinced\r\nof the unworthiness of Gaveston, he turned against him, and the whole\r\nbaronage followed his lead. Only Hugh Despenser and a few lawyers\r\nadhered to the favourite. Gloucester did not like to take an active\r\npart against his brother-in-law, but his stepfather, Monthermer, was\r\nconspicuous among the enemies of the Gascon. Winchelsea, too, came to\r\nEngland and threw his powerful influence on the side of the opposition.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1308, a parliament of nobles met and insisted upon the exile\r\nof the favourite. The magnates took up a high line. \"Homage and the\r\noath of allegiance,\" they declared, \"are due to the crown rather than\r\nto the person of the king. If the king behave unreasonably, his lieges\r\nare bound to bring him back to the ways of righteousness.\" On May 18\r\nletters patent were issued promising that Gaveston should be banished\r\nbefore June 25. Gaveston, bending before the storm, surrendered his\r\nearldom and prepared for departure, while Winchelsea and the bishops\r\ndeclared him excommunicate if he tarried in England beyond the\r\nappointed day. The king did his best to lighten his friend's\r\nmisfortune. Fresh grants of land and castles compensated for the loss\r\nof Cornwall and gave him means for armed resistance. The grant of\r\nGascon counties, jurisdictions, cities and castles to the value of\r\n3,000 marks a year provided him with a dignified refuge. The pope and\r\ncardinals were besought to relieve him from the sentence hung over his\r\nhead by the archbishop. It is significant of Edward's early intention\r\nto violate his promise, that in his letters to the curia he still\r\ndescribes Gaveston as Earl of Cornwall. Peter was soon appointed the\r\nking's lieutenant in Ireland. This time he was called Earl of Cornwall\r\nin a document meant for English use. As midsummer approached, Edward\r\naccompanied him to Bristol and bade him a sorrowful farewell. Attended\r\nby a numerous and splendid household, Gaveston crossed over to Ireland\r\nand took up the government of that country, where his energy and\r\nliberality won him considerable popularity.\r\n\r\nEdward was inconsolable at the loss of his friend. For the first time\r\nin his reign he threw himself into politics with interest, and\r\nintrigued with rare perseverance to bring about his recall. Meanwhile\r\nthe business of the state fell into deplorable confusion. No supplies\r\nwere raised; no laws were passed; no effort was made to stay the\r\nprogress of Robert Bruce. The magnates refused to help the king, and in\r\nApril, 1309, Edward was forced to meet a parliament of the three\r\nestates at Westminster. There he received a much-needed supply, but the\r\nbarons and commons drew up a long schedule of grievances, in which they\r\ncomplained of the abuses of purveyance, the weakness of the government,\r\nthe tyranny of the royal officials, and the delays in obtaining\r\njustice. The estates refused point blank the king's request for the\r\nrecall of Gaveston and demanded an answer to their petitions in the\r\nnext parliament.\r\n\r\nEdward saw in submission to the estates the only way of bringing back\r\nhis brother Peter from his gilded exile. He persuaded the pope to annul\r\nthe ecclesiastical censures with which Winchelsea had sought to prevent\r\nGaveston's return, and then recalled his friend on his own authority.\r\nGaveston at once quitted Ireland and was met at Chester by Edward.\r\nTogether they attended a parliament of magnates held in July at\r\nStamford. There Edward announced that he accepted the petitions of the\r\nestates and issued a statute limiting purveyance. But the real work of\r\nthis assembly was the ratification of the recall of the favourite,\r\nwhich was assured since Edward had won over some of the chief earls to\r\nagree to it. Gloucester was easily moved to champion his\r\nbrother-in-law's cause. Lincoln reverted to his former friendship for\r\nthe Gascon, and managed both to overbear the hostility of Lancaster and\r\nto induce Earl Warenne, \"who had never shown a cheerful face to Peter\r\nsince the Wallingford tournament,\" to become his friend. Warwick, alone\r\nof the earls, was irreconcilable. But Edward had gained his point. It\r\nwas even agreed that the returned exile should regain his earldom of\r\nCornwall.\r\n\r\nThe annalists moralise on the instability of the magnates; and the\r\nsudden revolution may perhaps be set down as much to their incapacity\r\nas to the dexterity of the king. But Peter's second period of power was\r\neven shorter than his first. He had learnt nothing from his\r\nmisfortunes, save perhaps increased contempt for his enemies. He was\r\nmore insolent, greedy, and bitter in speech than ever. Early in 1310\r\nthe barons were again preparing to renew their attacks. The second\r\nstorm burst in a parliament of magnates held at London in March, 1310.\r\nThe barons came to this parliament in military array, and Edward once\r\nmore found himself at their mercy. The conditions of 1258 exactly\r\nrepeated themselves. Once more an armed baronial parliament made itself\r\nthe mouthpiece of the national discontent against a weak king, an\r\nincompetent administration, and foreign favourites. The magnates were\r\nno longer contented with simply demanding the banishment of Gaveston.\r\nThey were ready with a constructive programme of reform, and they went\r\nback to the policy of the Mad Parliament. As the king could not be\r\ntrusted, the royal power must once more be put into commission in the\r\nhands of a committee of magnates. So stiff were the barons in their\r\nadhesion to the precedents of 1258, that they made no pretence of\r\ntaking the commons into partnership with them. To them the work of\r\nEdward I. had been done to no purpose. Baronial assemblies and full\r\nparliaments of the estates were still equally competent to transact all\r\nthe business of the nation. It is vain to see in this ignoring of the\r\ncommons any aristocratic jealousy of the more popular element in the\r\nconstitution. There can be no doubt but that any full parliament would\r\nhave co-operated with the barons as heartily in 1310 as it had done in\r\n1309. It was simply that popular co-operation was regarded as\r\nunnecessary. As in 1258, the magnates claimed to speak for the whole\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe barons drew up a statement of the \"great perils and dangers\" to\r\nwhich England was exposed through the king's dependence on bad\r\ncounsellors. The franchises of Holy Church were threatened; the king\r\nwas reduced to live by extortion; Scotland was lost; and the crown was\r\n\"grievously dismembered\" in England and Ireland. \"Wherefore, sire,\" the\r\npetition concludes, \"your good folk pray you humbly that, for the\r\nsalvation of yourself and them and of the crown, you will assent that\r\nthese perils shall be avoided and redressed by ordinance of your\r\nbaronage.\" Edward at once surrendered at discretion, perhaps in the\r\nvain hope of saving Gaveston. On March 16 he issued a charter, which\r\nempowered the barons to elect certain persons to draw up ordinances to\r\nreform the realm and the royal household. The powers of the committee\r\nwere to last until Michaelmas, 1311. A barren promise that the king's\r\nconcession should not be counted a precedent made Edward's submission\r\nseem a little less abject. Four days later the ordainers were\r\nappointed, the method of their election being based upon the precedents\r\nof 1258.\r\n\r\nTwenty-one lords ordainers represented in somewhat unequal proportions\r\nthe three great ranks of the magnates. At the head of the seven bishops\r\nwas Winchelsea, while both Bishop Baldock of London, the dismissed\r\nchancellor, and his successor, John Langton of Chichester, were\r\nincluded among the rest. All the eight earls attending the parliament\r\nbecame ordainers. Side by side with moderate men, such as Gloucester,\r\nLincoln, and John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, were the extreme men\r\nof the opposition, Lancaster, Pembroke, Warwick, Hereford, the king's\r\nbrother-in-law, and Edmund Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel. Warenne and the\r\ninsignificant Earl of Oxford do not seem to have been present in\r\nparliament, and are therefore omitted. With these exceptions, and of\r\ncourse that of the Earl of Cornwall, the whole of the earls were\r\narrayed against the king. The six barons, who completed the list of\r\nnominees, were either colourless in their policy or dependent on the\r\nearls and their episcopal allies. The ordainers set to work at once.\r\nTwo days after their appointment, they issued six preliminary\r\nordinances by which they resolved that the place of their sitting\r\nshould be London, that none of the ordainers should receive gifts from\r\nthe crown, that no royal grants should be valid without the consent of\r\nthe majority, that the customs should be paid directly into the\r\nexchequer, that the foreign merchants who had lately farmed them should\r\nbe arrested, and that the Great Charter should be firmly kept. During\r\nthe next eighteen months they remained hard at work.\r\n\r\nGaveston, conscious of his impending doom, betook himself to the north\r\nas early as February. As soon as he could escape, Edward hurried\r\nnorthwards to join him. An expedition against the Scots was then\r\nsummoned for September. It was high time that something should be done.\r\nDuring the three years that Edward had reigned, Robert Bruce had made\r\nalarming progress. One after the other the Scottish magnates had joined\r\nhis cause, and a few despairing partisans and some scattered\r\nill-garrisoned, ill-equipped strongholds alone upheld the English cause\r\nnorth of the Tweed. But even then Edward did not wage war in earnest.\r\nHis real motive for affecting zeal for martial enterprise was his\r\ndesire to escape from his taskmasters, and to keep Gaveston out of\r\nharm's way. The earls gave him no encouragement. On the pretext that\r\ntheir services were required in London at the meetings of the\r\nordainers, the great majority of the higher baronage took no personal\r\npart in the expedition. Gloucester was the only ordainer who was\r\npresent, and the only other earls in the host were Warenne and Gaveston\r\nhimself. The chief strength of Edwards army was a swarm of\r\nill-disciplined Welsh and English infantry, more intent on plunder than\r\non victory. In September Edward advanced to Roxburgh and made his way\r\nas far as Linlithgow. No enemy was to be found, for Bruce was not\r\nstrong enough to risk a pitched battle, even against Edward's army. He\r\nhid himself in the mountains and moors, and contented himself with\r\ncutting off foraging parties, destroying stragglers, and breaking down\r\nthe enemy's communications. Within two months Edward discreetly retired\r\nto Berwick, and there passed many months at the border town.\r\nTechnically he was in Scotland; practically he might as well have been\r\nin London for all the harm he was doing to Bruce. However, Gaveston\r\nshowed more martial zeal than his master. He led an expedition which\r\npenetrated as far as Perth, and reduced the country between the Forth\r\nand the Grampians to Edward's obedience. Gloucester also pacified the\r\nforest of Ettrick. To these two all the little honour of the campaign\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Lincoln governed England as regent during the king's\r\nabsence. In February, 1311, he died, and Gloucester abandoned the\r\ncampaign to take up the regency. The death of the last of Edward I.'s\r\nlay ministers was followed in March by that of another survivor of the\r\nold generation, Bishop Bek of Durham. The old landmarks were quickly\r\npassing away, and the forces that still made for moderation were\r\nsensibly diminished. Gilbert of Gloucester, alone of the younger\r\ngeneration, still aspired to the position of a mediator. The most\r\nimportant result of Lincoln's death was the unmuzzling of his\r\nson-in-law, Thomas of Lancaster. In his own right the lord of the three\r\nearldoms of Lancaster, Leicester, and Derby, Thomas then received in\r\naddition his father-in-law's two earldoms of Lincoln and Salisbury. The\r\nenormous estates and innumerable jurisdictions attached to these five\r\noffices gave him a territorial position greater by far than that of any\r\nother English lord. \"I do not believe,\" writes the monk of Malmesbury,\r\n\"that any duke or count of the Roman empire could do as much with the\r\nrevenues of his estates as the Earl of Lancaster.\" Nor were Earl\r\nThomas' personal connexions less magnificent than his feudal dignities.\r\nAs a grandson of Henry III., he was the first cousin of the king.\r\nThrough his mother, Blanche of Artois, Queen of Navarre and Countess of\r\nChampagne, he was the grandson of the valiant Robert of Artois, who had\r\nfallen at Mansura, and the great-grandson of Louis VIII. of France. His\r\nhalf-sister, Joan of Champagne, was the wife of Philip the Fair, so\r\nthat the French king was his brother-in-law as well as his cousin, and\r\nIsabella, Edward's consort, was his niece. Unluckily, the personality\r\nof the great earl was not equal to his pedigree or his estates. Proud,\r\nhard to work with, jealous, and irascible, he was essentially the\r\nleader of opposition, the grumbler, and the _frondeur_. When the time\r\ncame for a constructive policy, Thomas broke down almost as signally as\r\nEdward himself. His ability was limited, his power of application\r\nsmall, and his passions violent and ungovernable. Greedy, selfish,\r\ndomineering, and narrow, he had few scruples and no foresight, little\r\npatriotism, and no breadth of view. At this moment he had to play a\r\npart which was within his powers. The simple continuance of the\r\ntraditions of policy, which he inherited with his pedigree and his\r\nestates; was all that was necessary. As the greatest of the English\r\nearls, the head of a younger branch of the royal house, and the\r\ninheritor of the estates and titles of Montfort and Ferrars, he was\r\ntrebly bound to act as leader of the baronial opposition, the champion\r\nof the charters, the enemy of kings, courtiers, favourites, and\r\nforeigners. He was steadfast in his prejudices and hatreds, and the\r\nordainers found in him a leader who could at least save them from the\r\nreproach of inconstancy and the lack of fixed purpose shown at the\r\nparliament of Stamford.\r\n\r\nIt was the first duty of Earl Thomas to perform homage and fealty for\r\nhis new earldoms of Lincoln and Salisbury. Attended by a hundred armed\r\nknights, he rode towards the border. Edward was at Berwick, and Thomas\r\ndeclined to proffer his homage outside the kingdom. On Edward refusing\r\nto cross the Tweed, Thomas declared that he would take forcible\r\npossession of his lands. Civil war was only avoided by Edward giving\r\nway. The king met Thomas on English soil at Haggerston, four miles from\r\nBerwick. There the earl performed homage, and exchanged the kiss of\r\npeace with his king, but he would not even salute the upstart Earl of\r\nCornwall, who injudiciously accompanied Edward, and the king departed\r\ndeeply indignant at this want of courtesy. Returning to Berwick, Edward\r\nlingered there until the completion of the work of the ordainers made\r\nit necessary for him to face parliament. Leaving Gaveston protected by\r\nthe strong walls of Bamburgh, the king quitted the border at the end of\r\nJuly, and met his parliament a month later in London. Though the\r\nordainers had been appointed by a baronial parliament, the three\r\nestates were summoned to hear and ratify the results of their labours.\r\nThirty-five more ordinances, covering a very wide field, were then laid\r\nbefore them. Disorderly and disproportioned, like most medieval\r\nlegislation, they ranged from trivial personal questions and the\r\ndetails of administration to the broadest schemes for the future. Many\r\nof them were simply efforts to get the recognised law enforced. There\r\nwere clauses forbidding alienation of domain, the abuses of purveyance,\r\nthe usurpations of the courts of the royal household, the enlargement\r\nof the forests, and the employment of unlawful sources of revenue.\r\nUnder the last head, the new custom, which Edward I. had persuaded the\r\nforeign merchants to pay, was specifically abolished. Provisions of\r\nsuch a character show that the king had made no effort to observe\r\neither the Great Charter or the laws of Edward I. Even the recent\r\nstatute of Stamford, and the six ordinances of the previous year, had\r\nto be re-enacted. Similar restatements of sound principles were too\r\ncommon in the fourteenth century to make the ordinances an epoch. The\r\nvital clauses were those providing for the control of the king and for\r\npenalties against his favourites.\r\n\r\nUnder the first of these heads, the ordainers worked out to the\r\nuttermost consequences their favourite distinction between the crown\r\nand the king. The crown was to be strengthened, but the king was to be\r\ndeprived of every shred of power. The great offices of state in\r\nEngland, Ireland, and Gascony were to be filled up with the counsel and\r\nconsent of the barons, a provision which, if literally interpreted,\r\nmeant that the barons intended to govern Gascony as well as England.\r\nThe king was not to go to war, raise an army, or leave the kingdom\r\nwithout the permission of parliament. He was to \"live of his own,\"\r\nhowever scanty a living that might be. Special judges were to hear\r\ncomplaints against royal ministers and bailiffs. Parliaments were to\r\nmeet once or twice a year. It was a complete programme of limited\r\nmonarchy. But there was no reference to the commons and clergy. We are\r\nstill in the atmosphere of the Provisions of Oxford, and there is no\r\nEarl Simon to emphasise the fuller conception of national control.\r\n\r\nTo Edward and to the barons, the penal clauses were the very essence of\r\nthe ordinances. The twentieth ordinance declared that Peter of\r\nGaveston, \"as a public enemy of the king and kingdom, be forthwith\r\nexiled, for all time and without hope of return,\" from all dominions\r\nsubject to the English king. He was to leave England before All Saints'\r\nday, and the port of Dover was to be his place of embarkation. Other\r\nordinances dealt with lesser offenders. Exile was once more to be the\r\ndoom of the Frescobaldi, and the other alien merchants who had acted as\r\nEdward's financial agents; Gaveston's kinsfolk, followers and abettors\r\nincurred their master's fate. All Gascons were to be sent to their own\r\ncountry, their allegiance to the crown in no wise saving them from the\r\nhatred meted out to all aliens. Neither high nor low were spared: Henry\r\nde Beaumont, the grandson of an Eastern emperor, and his sister, the\r\nlady Vesey, were to leave the realm; John Charlton, the pushing\r\nShropshire squire who was worming his way by court favour into the\r\nestates of the degenerate descendants of the house of Gwenwynwyn, was,\r\nwith the other English partisans of the favourite, to be driven from\r\nthe royal service.\r\n\r\nEdward made a last desperate attempt to save Gaveston. He would agree\r\nto all the other ordinances, if he were still allowed to keep his\r\nbrother Peter in England and in possession of the earldom of Cornwall.\r\nBut the estates refused to yield the root of the whole matter.\r\nThreatened with the prospect of a new battle of Lewes, if he remained\r\nobdurate, Edward bowed to his destiny. The ordinances were published in\r\nevery shire, and new ministers, chosen with the approval of the\r\nestates, deprived the king of the government of the country.\r\n\r\nEarly in November, Gaveston sailed to Flanders, but within a few weeks\r\nEdward insisted upon his return. Rumours spread that Gaveston was in\r\nEngland, hiding himself away in his former castles of Wallingford and\r\nTintagel, or in the king's castle of Windsor. The thin veil of mystery\r\nwas soon withdrawn. Early in 1312, Peter openly accompanied the king to\r\nYork, where, on January 18, Edward issued a proclamation to the effect\r\nthat Gaveston had been unlawfully exiled, that he was back in England\r\nby the king's command, and prepared to answer to all charges against\r\nhim. A few weeks later, Edward restored him to his earldom and estates.\r\nKing and favourite still tarried in the north, preparing for the\r\ninevitable struggle. It was believed that they intrigued with Robert\r\nBruce for a refuge in Scotland. Bruce, according to the story, declined\r\nto have anything to do with them. \"If the King of England will not keep\r\nfaith with his own subjects,\" he is reported to have said, \"how then\r\nwill he keep faith with me?\"\r\n\r\nThe ordainers looked upon Gaveston's return as a declaration of war.\r\nWinchelsea pronounced him excommunicate, and five of the eight earls\r\nwho sat among the ordainers, bound themselves by oaths to maintain the\r\nordinances and pursue the favourite to the death. These were Thomas of\r\nLancaster, Aymer of Pembroke, Humphrey of Hereford, Edmund of Arundel,\r\nand Guy of Warwick. Gilbert of Gloucester declined to take part in the\r\nconfederacy, but promised to accept whatever the five earls might\r\ndetermine. Moreover, John, Earl Warenne, who had hitherto kept aloof\r\nfrom the ordainers, at last threw in his lot with them, won over, it\r\nwas believed, by the eloquence of Archbishop Winchelsea. The ordainers\r\nthen divided England into large districts, appointing one of the\r\nbaronial leaders to the charge of each. Gloucester himself undertook\r\nthe government of the south-east, while Robert Clifford and Henry Percy\r\nagreed to guard the march, to prevent Gaveston escaping to the Scots.\r\nPembroke and Warenne marched to the north to lay hands on the\r\nfavourite, and Lancaster himself followed them.\r\n\r\nWhile the ordainers were acting, Edward and Gaveston were aimlessly\r\nwandering about in the north. They failed to raise an army or to win\r\nthe people to their side, and on the approach of Lancaster, they fled\r\nbefore him from York to Newcastle. The earl followed quickly. On the\r\nafternoon of Ascension day, May 4, Lancaster, Clifford, and Percy\r\nsuddenly swooped down on Newcastle. The king and his friend escaped\r\nwith the utmost difficulty to Tynemouth, leaving their luggage, jewels,\r\nhorses, and other possessions to the victor. Next day they fled by sea\r\nto Scarborough. The queen, left behind at Tynemouth, fell into her\r\nuncle Lancaster's power.\r\n\r\nThe royal castle of Scarborough, whose Norman keep and spacious wards\r\noccupy a rocky peninsula surrounded, except on the town side, by the\r\nNorth Sea, had lately been transferred from the custody of Henry Percy,\r\none of the confederate barons, to that of Gaveston. There was no fitter\r\nplace wherein the favourite could stand at bay against his pursuers.\r\nAccordingly Edward left Gaveston, after a tender parting, and betook\r\nhimself to York. Lancaster thereupon occupied a position midway between\r\nScarborough and Knaresborough, while Pembroke, Warenne, and Henry Percy\r\nlaid siege to Scarborough. Gaveston soon found that he was unable to\r\nresist them. His troops, scarcely adequate to man the extensive walls,\r\nwere too many for the scanty store of provisions which the castle\r\ncontained. After less than a fortnight's siege, he persuaded the two\r\nearls and Percy to allow him easy terms of surrender. The three\r\nbaronial leaders pledged themselves on the Gospels to protect Gaveston\r\nfrom all manner of evil until August 1. During the interval parliament\r\nwas to decide as to what was to be his future fate. If the terms agreed\r\nupon by parliament were unsatisfactory to him, he was to return to\r\nScarborough, which was still to be garrisoned by his followers, with\r\nleave to purchase supplies.\r\n\r\nPembroke undertook the personal custody of the prisoner, and escorted\r\nhim by slow stages from Scarborough to the south, where he was to be\r\nretained in honourable custody at his own castle of Wallingford. Three\r\nweeks after the surrender, the convoy reached Deddington, a small town\r\nin Oxfordshire, a few miles south of Banbury. There Gaveston was lodged\r\nin the house of the vicar of the parish, and told to take a few days'\r\nrest after the fatigues of the journey. Pembroke himself did not remain\r\nat Deddington, but went on to Bampton in the Bush, where his countess\r\nthen was. Thereupon on June 10, at sunrise, the Earl of Warwick, the\r\nmost rancorous of Peter's enemies, occupied Deddington with a strong\r\nforce. Bursting into the bedchamber of his victim, Earl Guy exclaimed\r\nin a loud voice: \"Arise, traitor, thou art taken\". Peter was at once\r\nled with every mark of indignity to Warwick castle. Thus the black dog\r\nof Arden showed that he could bite.\r\n\r\nWarwick was not personally pledged to Gaveston's safety, though, as one\r\nof the confederates, he was clearly bound by their acts. His seizure of\r\nPeter was only warrantable by the, fear that Pembroke, with his\r\nroyalist leanings, was likely to play the extreme party false; but in\r\nany case Warwick was as much obliged as Pembroke to observe the terms\r\nof the capitulation. Neither Warwick nor his allies took this view of\r\nthe matter. They rejoiced at the good fortune which had remedied the\r\ndisastrous capitulation of Scarborough, and resolved to put an end to\r\nthe favourite without delay. Lancaster was then at Kenilworth;\r\nHereford, Arundel, and other magnates were also present, and all agreed\r\nin praising Warwick's energy. On Monday morning, June 19, the three\r\nearls rode the few miles from Kenilworth to Warwick, and Earl Guy\r\nhanded over Peter to them. They then escorted their captive to a place\r\ncalled Blacklow hill, about two miles out of Warwick on the Kenilworth\r\nroad, but situated in Lancaster's lands. The crowd following the\r\ncavalcade was moved to tears when Peter, kneeling to Lancaster, cried\r\nin vain for mercy from the \"gentle earl\". On reaching Blacklow hill,\r\nthe three earls withdrew, though remaining near enough to see what was\r\ngoing on. Then two Welshmen in Lancaster's service laid hands upon the\r\nvictim. One drove his sword through his body, the other cut off his\r\nhead. The corpse remained where it had fallen, but the head was brought\r\nto the earls as a sign that the deed was done. After this the earls\r\nrode back to Kenilworth. Guy of Warwick remained all the time in his\r\ncastle. He had already taken his share in the cruel act of treachery.\r\nIt was, however, important that Lancaster should take the\r\nresponsibility for the deed. Four cobblers of Warwick piously bore the\r\nheadless corpse within their town. But the grim earl sent it back,\r\nbecause it was not found on his fee. At last some Oxford Dominicans\r\ntook charge of the body and deposited it temporarily in their convent,\r\nnot daring to inter it in holy ground, as Gaveston had died\r\nexcommunicate.\r\n\r\nThe ostentatious violence of the confederate earls broke up their\r\nparty. Aymer of Pembroke, indignant at their breach of faith, regarded\r\nthe whole transaction as a stain on his honour. He besought\r\nGloucester's intervention, but was only told that he should be more\r\ncautious in his future negotiations. He harangued the clerks and\r\nburgesses of Oxford, but university and town agreed that the matter was\r\nno business of theirs. Then in disgust he betook himself to the king,\r\nwhom he found still surrounded with the Beaumonts, Mauleys, and other\r\nfriends of Gaveston, against whom the ordinances had decreed\r\nbanishment. Warenne, whose honour was only less impeached than\r\nPembroke's, also deserted the ordainers for the court. Edward bitterly\r\ndeplored the death of his friend. He gladly welcomed the deserters, and\r\nprepared to wreak vengeance on the ordainers.\r\n\r\nEdward plucked up courage to return to London, where in July he\r\naddressed the citizens, and persuaded them to maintain the peace of the\r\ncity against the barons. He next visited Dover, and there he\r\nstrengthened the fortifications of the castle, took oaths of fealty\r\nfrom the Cinque Ports, and negotiated with the King of France. Thence\r\nhe returned to London, hoping that the precautions he had taken would\r\nsecure his position in the parliament which he had summoned to meet at\r\nWestminster. But the four earls still held the field, and answered the\r\nsummons to parliament by occupying Ware with a strong military force. A\r\nthousand men-at-arms were drawn by Lancaster from his five earldoms,\r\nwhile the Welsh from Brecon, who followed the Earl of Hereford, and the\r\nvigorous foresters of Arden, who mustered under the banner of Warwick,\r\nmade a formidable show. Yet at the last moment neither side was eager\r\nto begin hostilities. The four earls' violence damaged their cause, and\r\nmany who had no love of Gaveston, or desire to avenge him, inclined to\r\nthe king's party. Gilbert of Gloucester busied himself with mediating\r\nbetween the two sides. At this juncture two papal envoys, sent to end\r\nthe interminable outstanding disputes with France, arrived in England,\r\nalong with Louis, Count of Évreux, the queen's uncle. Edward availed\r\nhimself of the presence of French jurists in the count's train to\r\nobtain legal opinion that the ordinances were invalid, as against\r\nnatural equity and civil law. These technicalities did little service\r\nto the king's cause, and better work was done when Louis and the papal\r\nenvoys joined with Gloucester in mediating between the opposing forces.\r\nAt length moderate counsels prevailed. Edward could only resist the\r\nfour earls through the support of his new allies, and Pembroke and\r\nWarenne were as little anxious to fight as Gloucester himself. They\r\nwere quite willing to make terms which seemed to the king treason to\r\nhis friend's memory.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations were still proceeding when, on November 13, 1312, the\r\nbirth of a son to Edward and Isabella revived the almost dormant\r\nfeeling of loyalty to the sovereign. The king ceased to brood over the\r\nloss of his brother Peter, and became more willing to accept the\r\ninevitable. He gave some pleasure to his subjects by refusing the\r\nsuggestion of the queen's uncle that the child should be called Louis,\r\nand christened him Edward after his own father. At last, on December\r\n22, terms of peace were agreed upon. The earls and barons concerned in\r\nGaveston's death were to appear before the king in Westminster Hall,\r\nand humbly beg his pardon and good-will. In return for this the king\r\nagreed to remit all rancour caused by the death of the favourite.\r\nLancaster and Warwick, who took no personal part in the negotiations,\r\nsent in a long list of objections to the details of the treaty. Nearly\r\na year elapsed before the earls personally acknowledged their fault.\r\nDuring that interval there was no improvement in the position of\r\naffairs. Parliament granted no money; and Edward only met his daily\r\nexpenses by loans, contracted from every quarter, and by keeping tight\r\nhands on the confiscated estates of the Templars. Both the king and the\r\nleading earls made every excuse to escape attending the ineffective\r\nparliaments of that miserable time. Two short visits to France gave\r\nEdward a pretext for avoiding his subjects. There were some hasty\r\nmusterings of armed men on pretence of tournaments. But the king was\r\nstill formidable enough to make it desirable for the barons to carry\r\nout the treaty. Finally, in October, 1313, Lancaster, Hereford, and\r\nWarwick made their public submission in Westminster Hall. Pardons were\r\nat once issued to them and to over four hundred minor offenders. Feasts\r\nof reconciliation were held, and it seemed as if the old feuds were at\r\nlast ended. Gaveston's corpse was removed from Oxford to Langley, in\r\nHertfordshire, and buried in the church of a new convent of Dominicans\r\nset up by Edward to pray for the favourite's soul.\r\n\r\nJust before the end of the disputes Archbishop Winchelsea died in May,\r\n1313. He left behind him the reputation of a saint and a hero, and a\r\nmovement was undertaken for his canonisation. With all his faults, he\r\nwas the greatest churchman of his time, and the most steadfast and\r\nunselfish of ecclesiastical statesmen. Despite his palsy, he had shown\r\nwonderful activity since his return. The brain and soul of the\r\nordainers, he equally made it his business to uphold extreme\r\nhierarchical privilege. Bitterly as he hated Walter Langton, he was\r\nindignant that a bishop should be imprisoned and despoiled by the lay\r\npower, and took up his cause with such energy that he effected his\r\nliberation, only to find that Langton made peace with the king and\r\nturned his back on the ordainers. The after-swell of the storms,\r\nexcited by the petition of Lincoln and the statute of Carlisle, still\r\ncontinued troublous during Winchelsea's later years. The pope\r\ncomplained of the violated privileges of the Church and of the\r\naccumulated arrears of King John's tribute; and Winchelsea was anxious\r\nto promote the papal cause. But the barons in Edward's early\r\nparliaments still used the bold language of the magnates of 1301, and\r\nthe letter of 1309, drawn up by the parliament of Stamford, is no\r\nunworthy pendant of the Lincoln letter. As time went on, the disorders\r\nof the government and the weakness of the king surrendered everything\r\nto the pope. It was soon as it had been in the days of Henry III., when\r\npope and king combined to despoil the English Church.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the order of the Temple shows how absolutely England\r\nwas forced to follow in the wake of the papacy and the King of France.\r\nThere was no spontaneous movement against the society as in France;\r\nthere was not even the fierce malice and insatiable greed which could\r\nfind their only satisfaction in the ruin of the brethren; and there is\r\nnot much evidence that the Templars were unpopular. The whole attack\r\nwas the result of commands given from without. It was at the repeated\r\nrequest of Philip of France and Clement V. that Edward reluctantly\r\nordered the apprehension of all the Templars within England, Scotland,\r\nand Ireland on January 8, 1308. Their property was taken into the\r\nking's hands, and their persons were confined in the royal prisons\r\nunder the custody of the sheriffs. For their trial, Clement appointed a\r\nmixed commission including Winchelsea, Archbishop Greenfield of York,\r\nseveral English bishops, one French bishop, and certain papal\r\ninquisitors specially assigned for the purpose, the chief of whom were\r\nthe Abbot of Lagny and Sicard de Lavaur, Canon of Narbonne, who came to\r\nEngland in 1309. At last the victims were collected at London and York,\r\nwhere the trials were to be conducted for the southern and northern\r\nprovinces. There was much hesitation among the English bishops. The\r\nfoes of the Templars lamented the prelates' lack of zeal and their\r\nscruples in collecting evidence, and suggested that the torture, which\r\nhad so freely been used in France, would soon extract confessions. But\r\nthe northern bishops declared that torture was unknown in England, and\r\nasked, if it were to be adopted, whether it was to be applied by clerks\r\nor laymen, and whether torturers should be imported from beyond sea. In\r\nthe end, torture was used, but not to any great extent.\r\n\r\nA great mass of depositions, mostly vague and worthless, or derived\r\nfrom the suspicious confessions of apostates and weaklings, was\r\ngathered together, and in 1311 laid before provincial councils, but\r\nneither province came to any fixed decision. \"Inasmuch,\" says\r\nHemingburgh, \"as the Templars were not found altogether guilty or\r\naltogether innocent, they referred the dubious matter to the pope.\"\r\nThey sent the evidence they had collected to swell the mass of\r\ntestimony from all Christendom, which was laid before the council of\r\nVienne. When the pope suppressed the order in April, 1312, and\r\ntransferred its lands to the Knights of St. John, the papal decrees\r\nwere quietly carried out in England. One or two Templars died in\r\nprison, but none were executed; and the majority were dismissed with\r\npensions or secluded in monasteries. Edward and his nobles took good\r\ncare to make a large profit out of the transaction. The resources of\r\nthe Temple alone kept the king from destitution during the period\r\nbetween the death of Gaveston and his reconciliation with the earls.\r\nMany barons laid violent hands on estates belonging to the order, and\r\nlong held on to them despite papal expostulation. The Hospitallers\r\nfound that the lands of their rivals came to them so slowly, and\r\nencumbered with so many charges, that their new property became\r\nburdensome rather than helpful to their society. Thus it was that they\r\nnever made any use of the New Temple in London, and, before long, let\r\nit out to the common-lawyers. In the fall of the Templars, the pope and\r\nthe Church set the first great example of the suppression of a\r\nreligious order to kings, who before long bettered the precedent given\r\nthem. The sordid story is mainly important to our history as an example\r\nof the completeness of the influence of the papal autocracy, and of the\r\nsubmissiveness of clergy and laity to its behests. It was a lurid\r\ncommentary on the practical working of the ecclesiastical system that\r\nthe business of condemning an innocent order first brought into England\r\nthe papal inquisitor and the use of torture. Yet the whole process was\r\nbut so pale a reflection of the horrors wrought in France that the\r\nconclusion arises that England owed more to the weakness of Edward II\r\nthan France to the strength of Philip IV.\r\n\r\nWinchelsea's death removed a real check on Edward, especially as the\r\nking was on such good terms with the papacy that he had little\r\ndifficulty in obtaining a successor amenable to his will. Undeterred by\r\nClement's bull reserving to himself the appointment, the monks of\r\nChrist Church at once proceeded to elect Thomas of Cobham, a theologian\r\nand a canonist of distinction, a man of high birth, great sanctity, and\r\nunblemished character, and in every way worthy of the primacy. But his\r\nmerits did not weigh for a moment with Clement against the wishes of\r\nthe king. He rejected Cobham and conferred the primacy on Edwards\r\nfavourite, Walter Reynolds, who had already obtained the bishopric of\r\nWorcester through the king's influence. A good deal of money, it was\r\nbelieved, found its way to the coffers of the _curia_; and the\r\nindignation of the English Church found voice in the impassioned\r\nprotests of the chroniclers. \"Lady Money rules everything in the pope's\r\ncourt,\" lamented the monk of Malmesbury. \"For eight years Pope Clement\r\nhas ruled the Universal Church: but what good he has done escapes\r\nmemory. England, alone of all countries, feels the burden of papal\r\ndomination. Out of the fulness of his power, the pope presumes to do\r\nmany things, and neither prince nor people dare contradict him. He\r\nreserves all the fat benefices for himself, and excommunicates all who\r\nresist him: his legates come and spoil the land: those armed with his\r\nbulls come and demand prebends. He has given all the deaneries to\r\nforeigners, and cut down the number of resident canons. Why does the\r\npope exercise greater power over the clergy than the emperor over the\r\nlaity? Lord Jesus! either take away the pope from our midst or lessen\r\nthe power which he presumes to have over the people.\" Such lamentations\r\nbore no fruit, and the simoniacal nomination of Reynolds was but the\r\nfirst of a series of appointments which robbed the episcopate of\r\ndignity and moral worth.\r\n\r\nWhile Church and State in England were thus distressed, the cause of\r\nRobert Bruce was making steady progress in Scotland. It is some measure\r\nof the difficulties against which Bruce had to contend that, after six\r\nyears, he was still by no means master of all that land. But least of\r\nall among the causes which retarded his advance can be placed the armed\r\nforces of England. During six years Edward II.'s one personal\r\nexpedition had been a complete failure. A more formidable obstacle in\r\nBruce's way was the stubborn resistance offered to him by the valour\r\nand skill of the small but highly trained garrisons which the wisdom of\r\nEdward I. had established in the fortresses of southern and central\r\nScotland. Each castle took a long time to subdue, and demanded\r\nengineering resources and a persistency of effort, which were difficult\r\nto obtain from a popular army. The garrisons co-operated with the\r\nScottish nobles who still adhered to Edward through jealousy of the\r\nupstart Bruces and love of feudal independence, rather than by reason\r\nof any sympathy with the English cause. Additional obstacles to\r\nRobert's progress were the hostility of the Church, to which he was\r\nstill the excommunicated murderer of Comyn; the captivity of so many\r\nScottish prelates and barons in England; the efforts of the pope and\r\nthe King of France to bring about suspensions of hostilities, and the\r\ngrievous famines which desolated Scotland no less than southern\r\nBritain. But during these years the King of Scots gradually overcame\r\nthese difficulties. His hardest fighting in the field was with rival\r\nScots rather than with the English intruders. In 1308 he defeated the\r\nComyns of Buchan, and established himself on the ruins of that house in\r\nthe north-east. In the same year his brother, Edward Bruce, conquered\r\nGalloway, where the Balliol tradition long prevented the domination of\r\nthe rival family.\r\n\r\nSecure from retaliation so long as domestic troubles lasted, the Scots\r\ndevastated the northern counties of England, whose inhabitants were\r\nforced to purchase relief from further attacks by paying large sums of\r\nmoney to the invaders. Formal truces were more than once made, but they\r\nwere ill observed, and each violation of an armistice involved some\r\nloss to Edward and some gain to Robert. Meanwhile the garrisons were\r\ncarefully isolated, and one by one signalled out for attack. In 1312\r\nBerwick itself was only saved from surprise by the opportune barking of\r\na dog. In January, 1313, Perth was captured by assault. Next day Robert\r\nslew the leading native burgesses who had adhered to the English, while\r\nhe permitted the English inhabitants to return freely to their own\r\ncountry. The whole town was destroyed, since walled towns, like\r\ncastles, had given the English their chief hold upon the country.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of Scotland when the reconciliation between Edward\r\nand the earls restored England to the appearance of unity. As if\r\nconscious that no time was to be lost in strengthening his position,\r\nBruce redoubled his efforts to make himself master of the fortresses\r\nwhich still remained in the enemy's hands. Regardless of the rigour of\r\nthe season, he set actively to work in the early weeks of 1314, and\r\nremarkable success attended his efforts. In February, the border\r\nstronghold of Roxburgh was taken by a night attack. \"And all that fair\r\ncastle, like the other castles which he had acquired, they pulled down\r\nto the ground, lest the English should afterwards by holding the castle\r\nbear rule over the land.\"[1] In March, Edinburgh castle was secured by\r\nsome Scots who climbed up the precipitous northern face of the castle\r\nrock, overpowered the garrison, and opened the gates to their comrades\r\noutside. Flushed with this great success, Bruce began the siege of\r\nStirling, the only important English garrison then held by the English\r\nin the heart of Scotland. He pressed the besieged so hard that they\r\nagreed to surrender to the enemy, if they were not relieved before\r\nMidsummer day, the feast of St. John the Baptist. While Robert was\r\nwatching Stirling, his brother Edward devastated the country round\r\nCarlisle, lording it for three days at the bishop's castle of Rose, and\r\nlevying heavy blackmail on the men of Cumberland.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Lanercost Chronicle_, p. 223.\r\n\r\nIf Stirling were lost, all Scotland would be at Bruce's mercy. Even\r\nEdward was stirred by the disgrace involved in the utter abandonment of\r\nhis father's conquest; and from March onwards he began to make spasmodic\r\nefforts to collect men and ships to enable him to advance to the relief\r\nof the beleaguered garrison. At first it seemed sufficient to raise the\r\nfeudal levies and a small infantry force from the northern shires, but\r\nas time went on the necessity of meeting the Scottish pikemen by\r\ncorresponding levies of foot soldiers became evident, and over 20,000\r\ninfantry were summoned from the northern counties and Wales.[1] But the\r\nnotice given was far too short, and June was well advanced before\r\nanything was ready.\r\n\r\n    [1] For the numbers at Bannockburn, see _Foedera_, ii., 248,\r\n    and Round, _Commune_ of London, pp. 289-301.\r\n\r\nEven the Scottish peril could not quicken the sluggish patriotism of\r\nthe ordainers. Four earls, Lancaster, Warenne, Warwick, and Arundel,\r\nanswered Edward's summons by reminding him that the ordinances\r\nprescribed that war should only be undertaken with the approval of\r\nparliament, and by declining to follow him to a campaign undertaken on\r\nhis own responsibility. They would send quotas, but begged to be\r\nexcused from personal attendance. Yet even without them, a gallant\r\narray slowly gathered together at Berwick, and one at least of the\r\nopposition earls, Humphrey of Hereford, was there, with Gilbert of\r\nGloucester and Aymer of Pembroke and 2,000 men-at-arms. An enormous\r\nbaggage train enabled the knights and barons to appear in the field in\r\ngreat magnificence, though it destroyed the mobility of the force. \"The\r\nmultitude of waggons,\" wrote the monk of Malmesbury, \"if they had been\r\nextended in a single line would have occupied the space of twenty\r\nleagues.\" The splendour and number of the army inspired the king and\r\nhis friends with the utmost confidence. Though the host started from\r\nBerwick less than a week before the appointed day, the king moved, says\r\nthe Malmesbury monk, not as if he were about to lead an army to battle,\r\nbut rather as if he were going on a pilgrimage to Compostella. \"There\r\nwas but short delay for sleep, and a shorter delay for taking food.\r\nHence horses, horsemen, and infantry were worn out with fatigue and\r\nhunger.\" There was no order or method in the proceedings of the host.\r\nThe presence of the king meant that there was no effective general, and\r\nHereford and Gloucester quarrelled for the second place.\r\n\r\nIt was not until Sunday, June 23, that Edward at last took up his\r\nquarters a few miles south of Stirling, with a worn-out and dispirited\r\narmy. Yet, if Stirling were to be saved, immediate action was\r\nnecessary. Gloucester and Hereford made a vigorous but unsuccessful\r\neffort to penetrate at once into the castle, and Bruce came down just\r\nin time to throw himself between them and the walls. Henry Bohun, who\r\nhad forced his way forward at the head of a force of Welsh infantry,\r\nwas slain, and his troops dispersed. Gloucester was unhorsed, and\r\nthereupon the English retreated to their camp. Fearing an attack under\r\ncover of darkness, they had little sleep that night, and many of the\r\nwatchers consoled themselves with revelry and drunkenness. When St.\r\nJohn's day dawned, they were too weary to fight effectively. Bruce\r\nadvanced from the woods and stationed his troops on the low ridge\r\nbounding the northern slope of the little brook, called the\r\nBannockburn, which runs about two miles south of Stirling on its course\r\ntowards the Forth. Of the three divisions, or battles, into which the\r\nScots were divided, two stood on the same front, side by side, while\r\nKing Robert commanded the rear battle, which was to serve as a reserve.\r\nHe marshalled his forces much in the same way that Wallace had adopted\r\nat Falkirk. There was the same close array of infantry, protected by a\r\nwall of shields and a thick hedge of pikes. Each man wore light but\r\nadequate armour, and, besides the pike, bore an axe at his side for\r\nwork at close quarters. Pits were dug before the Scots lines, and\r\ncovered over with hurdles so light that they would not bear the weight\r\nof a mail-clad warrior and his horse. Save for a small cavalry force\r\nkept in reserve in the rear, the men-at-arms were ordered to dismount\r\nand take their place in the dense array, lest, like their comrades at\r\nFalkirk, they should ride off in alarm when they saw the preponderance\r\nof the enemy's horse. The Scots were less numerous than the English,\r\nbut they were an army and not a mob; their commander was a man of rare\r\nmilitary insight, and their tactics were those which, twelve years\r\nbefore, had defeated the chivalry of France at Courtrai.\r\n\r\nThe English had feared that the Scots would not fight a pitched battle,\r\nand were astonished to see them at daybreak prepared to receive an\r\nattack. Their contempt for their enemy made them eager to accept the\r\nchallenge, but Gloucester, who, though only twenty-three, had more of\r\nthe soldier's eye than most of the magnates, urged Edward to postpone\r\nthe encounter for a day, that the army might recover from its fatigue,\r\nand the clergy advised delay out of respect to St. John the Baptist.\r\nUnmoved by prudence or piety, Edward denounced his nephew as a coward,\r\nand ordered an immediate advance.\r\n\r\nThe English, forgetting the lessons of the Welsh wars, sent on the\r\narchers in front of the cavalry. Bruce, seeing that their missiles were\r\nplaying havoc on his dense ranks, directed his small cavalry force to\r\ncharge the archers on their left flank. The unsupported bowmen at once\r\nfell back in confusion, leaving the cavalry to do its work. Meanwhile\r\nthe English men-at-arms were advancing in three \"battles,\" the first of\r\nwhich then came into action. Many of the English fell into the pits\r\nprepared for them, and the Scottish shields and pikes broke the attack\r\nof those who evaded these obstacles. Gloucester fought with rare\r\ngallantry, but was badly seconded by his followers. At last his horse\r\nwas slain under him, and he was knocked down and killed. The troop\r\nwhich he led fled panic-stricken from the field. The Scots then\r\nadvanced with such vigour that the English never recovered from the\r\ndisorder into which their first disaster had thrown them. While these\r\nthings were going on, the second and third English \"battles\" had been\r\nmaking feeble efforts to take their part in the fight. But the first\r\nline cut them off from direct access to the foe, and the archers of the\r\nsecond battle did more harm to their friends than to their enemies by\r\nshooting wildly, straight in front of them. There was no single\r\ndirecting force, nor, after Gloucester's fall, even one conspicuous\r\nleader who would set an example of blind valour. Hundreds of English\r\nknights, who had not drawn their swords, were soon fleeing in terror\r\nbefore the enemy. Edward, who had taken up his station in the rear\r\nbattle, rode off the field and never dismounted until he reached\r\nDunbar, whence he fled by sea to Berwick.\r\n\r\nAbandoned by their leaders, the English retreated as best they could.\r\nMany of their best knights lay dead on the field, and more were drowned\r\nin the Forth or Bannock, or swallowed up in the bogs, than were slain\r\nin the fight. The Scots, whose losses were slight, showed a prudent\r\ntendency to capture rather than slay the knights and barons, in order\r\nthat they might hold them up to ransom, and though many desisted from\r\nthe pursuit to plunder the baggage train, those who followed the\r\nEnglish fugitives reaped an abundant harvest of captives. Hereford was\r\nchased into Bothwell castle, which was still held for the English. But\r\nnext day the Scottish official who commanded there for Edward opened\r\nthe gates to Bruce, and the earl became a prisoner. Pembroke escaped\r\nwith difficulty on foot, along with a contingent of Welsh infantry. The\r\nmighty English army had ceased to exist; and with the surrender of\r\nStirling, next day, Bruce's career attained its culminating point. His\r\nlong years of trial were at last over, and the clever adventurer could\r\nhenceforth enjoy in security the crown which he had so gallantly won.\r\n\r\nThe military results of Bannockburn were of extreme importance. The\r\nablest of contemporary annalists aptly compared Bruce's victory to the\r\nbattle of Courtrai. An even nearer analogy was the fight at Morgarten\r\nwhere, within two years, the pikemen of the Forest Cantons were to\r\nscatter the chivalry of the Hapsburgers as effectively as the Flemings\r\nwon the day at Courtrai or the Scots at Bannockburn. The English had\r\nforgotten the military lessons of Edward I., as completely as they had\r\nforgotten his political lessons, and their reliance on the obsolete and\r\nunsupported cavalry charge was their undoing. Bruce, on the other hand,\r\nhad improved upon the teaching of Wallace and Edward I. His use of his\r\nmen-at-arms on foot anticipates the English tactics of the Hundred\r\nYears' War. The presence of these heavily armed troopers in his ranks\r\ngave him a strength in defence, and an impetuosity in attack, which\r\nmade it a simple matter to break up the undisciplined squadrons opposed\r\nto him. Bannockburn rang the death-knell of the tactics which since\r\nHastings had been regarded as the perfection of military art. The\r\npolitical lessons of the victory were of not less importance. It is\r\nalmost too much to say that Bannockburn won for Scotland its\r\nindependence, for Scottish independence had already been vindicated.\r\nBut the easy victory brought home to men's minds the full measure of\r\nthe Scottish triumph. It was already clear that so long as Edward\r\nlived, England would never make the continued effort which, as Edward\r\nI.'s wars both in Wales and Scotland had shown, could alone\r\nsystematically conquer a nation. Bruce's difficulties were not so much\r\nwith the English as with the Scots. It was no small task to unite the\r\nEnglish of the Lothians, the Welsh of the south-west, the Norsemen of\r\nthe extreme north, and the Celts of the hills into a single Scottish\r\nnation. He had against him the separatist local feeling which Scottish\r\nhistory and ethnology made inevitable, and it took time for him to\r\nobtain that prestige, which should hedge a king, and raise him above\r\nthe crowd of feudal earls and clan chieftains, who thought themselves\r\nas good as the sometime Earl of Carrick. Such dignity and distinction\r\nBannockburn supplied, and such measure of national unity and strong\r\nmonarchical authority as Scotland ever enjoyed, came from the triumph\r\nof him who became, even more than Wallace, the hero of the new nation.\r\nFor the next few years the Scots took the aggressive. They induced the\r\nFrench kings to renew the alliance which Philip IV. had made with them\r\nin the early years of the contest. They obtained papal recognition for\r\ntheir king and the withdrawal of the ban of the Church on Comyn's\r\nmurderer; they plundered northern England from end to end, and broke\r\ndown Anglo-Norman rule in Ireland; they plotted for the resurrection of\r\nthe Welsh principality; and, worse than all, they made common cause\r\nwith the baronial opposition. Hence it followed that the political\r\nresults of the victory were as important to England as they were to\r\nScotland itself. The troubled history of the next eight years reveals\r\nin detail the effects of Bannockburn on England. Edward's defeat threw\r\nhim into the power of the ordainers. The ordainers, when called upon to\r\ngovern, showed themselves as incapable as ever Edward or his favourites\r\nhad been. The results were misrule, aristocratic faction, popular\r\ndistress, and mob violence. Ineffective as are the first seven years of\r\nthe reign of Edward of Carnarvon, the eight years which followed\r\nBruce's victory plunged England deeper into the pit of degradation,\r\nfrom which neither the king nor the king's foes were strong, wise, or\r\nhonest enough to release her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nLANCASTER, PEMBROKE, AND THE DESPENSERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBannockburn was almost welcomed by the ordainers, for it afforded new\r\nopportunities of humiliating the defeated king. While Edward tarried at\r\nBerwick, Lancaster was in his castle of Pontefract with a force far\r\nlarger than his cousin's. Loudly declaring that the true cause of the\r\ndisaster was Edward's neglect to carry out the ordinances, he announced\r\nhis intention of immediately enforcing their observance. At a\r\nparliament at York, in September, Edward delivered himself altogether\r\ninto Thomas's hands, ordering the immediate execution of the\r\nordinances, and replacing his ministers and sheriffs by nominees of the\r\nordainers. The only boon that he obtained was that the earls postponed\r\nthe removal from court of Hugh Despenser and Henry Beaumont, the two\r\nfaithful friends who had guarded him in his flight from Bannockburn.\r\nDespenser, however, thought it prudent to avoid his enemies by going\r\ninto hiding. Edward's submission did not help him against the Scots.\r\nThe earls resolved that the question of an expedition was to be\r\npostponed until the next parliament, on the ground that it was\r\nimprudent to take action until Hereford and the other captives had been\r\nreleased. It was a sorry excuse, for King Robert and his brother were\r\ndevastating the northern counties with fire and sword, and it gave new\r\nground to the suspicion of an understanding between the Scottish king\r\nand the ordainers. But the victor of Bannockburn showed surprising\r\nmoderation. He suffered the bodies of Gloucester and the slain barons\r\nto be buried among their ancestors, and released Gloucester's\r\nfather-in-law, Monthermer, without ransom, declaring that the thing in\r\nthe world which he most desired was to live in peace with the English.\r\nHe welcomed an exchange of prisoners, by which his wife, Elizabeth de\r\nBurgh, his sister, his daughter, and the Bishop of Glasgow were\r\nrestored to Scotland. The release of Hereford soon added to the king's\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1315, Edward's humiliation was completed at a London\r\nparliament. Hugh Despenser and Walter Langton were removed from the\r\ncouncil. The \"superfluous members\" of the royal household, denounced as\r\n\"excessively burdensome to the king and the land,\" were dismissed, and\r\ndrastic ordinances were drawn up for the regulation of the diminished\r\nfollowing still allowed to the king. Edward was put on an allowance of\r\n£10 a day, and the administration of his revenues taken out of his\r\nhands. The grant made was accompanied by the condition that its\r\nspending should be entirely in the hands of the barons, and the estates\r\narranged after their own fashion for the new Scottish campaign. When\r\nsummer came, Lancaster insisted on taking the command himself, and thus\r\ngave a new grievance to Pembroke, who had already been appointed\r\ngeneral. Lancaster was henceforth the indispensable man. When\r\nparliament met at Lincoln, in January, 1316, the few magnates who\r\nattended would transact no business until his arrival. On his tardy\r\nappearance in the last days of the session, it was resolved \"that the\r\nlord king should do nothing grave or arduous without the advice of the\r\ncouncil, and that the Earl of Lancaster should hold the chief place in\r\nthe council\". It was only after some hesitation that the earl accepted\r\nthis position. Once more the king was forced to confirm the ordinances.\r\nLiberal grants were made by the estates, and every rural township was\r\ncalled upon to furnish and pay a foot soldier to fight the Scots.\r\n\r\nThe commander of the army and the chief counsellor of the king,\r\nLancaster, was in a stronger position than any subject since the days of\r\nSimon of Montfort. He could afford to despise aristocratic jealousy and\r\nroyal malignity. To the commons he was the good earl, who was standing\r\nup for the rights of the people. He was the darling of the clergy, who\r\nlooked upon him as the pillar of orthodoxy, the disciple of Winchelsea,\r\nand the upholder of the rights of Holy Church. The warlike and energetic\r\nbarons of the north were his sworn followers, and, apart from his hold\r\nupon public opinion, he could always fall back on the resources of his\r\nfive earldoms. But events were soon to show that the successful leader\r\nof opposition was absolutely incapable of carrying out a constructive\r\npolicy. He had no ideals, no principles, no feeling of the importance of\r\nadministrative efficiency, no sense of responsibility, no power of\r\ncontrolling his followers. He never understood that his business was no\r\nlonger to oppose but to act. The clear-headed monk of Malmesbury paints\r\nthe disastrous results of his inaction: \"Whatsoever pleased the king,\r\nthe earl's servants strove to overthrow; and whatever pleased the earl,\r\nwas declared by the king's servants to be treasonable; and so, at the\r\nsuggestion of the evil one, the households of earl and king put\r\nthemselves in the way and would not allow their masters, by whom the\r\nland should have been defended, to be of one accord\". Even the implied\r\nunderstanding with the King of Scots was not abandoned by the man on\r\nwhom the responsibility rested of defeating him. When Bruce devastated\r\nthe north of England he still spared the lands of the king's \"chief\r\ncounsellor,\" as of old he had spared the lands of the opposition leader.\r\nWhen, in 1316, Lancaster mustered his forces at Newcastle against the\r\nScots, Edward repaid him for his inaction in 1314 by declining to\r\naccompany him over the border. \"Thereupon,\" wrote the border\r\nannalist,[1] \"the earl at once went back; for neither trusted the\r\nother.\" Edward, who forgot and forgave nothing, secretly negotiated with\r\nthe pope for absolution from his oath to the ordinances. He gradually\r\nbuilt up a court party, and soon restored Hugh Despenser to his position\r\nin the household. As might be expected in such circumstances no\r\neffective resistance was made to the Scots.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Lanercost Chronicle_, p. 233.\r\n\r\nIt was a time of severe distress in England. In 1315 a rainy summer\r\nruined the harvest. Great floods swept away the hay from the fields,\r\nand drowned the sheep and cattle. In 1316 famine raged, especially in\r\nthe north. For a hundred years, we are told, such scarcity of corn had\r\nnot been known. A bushel of wheat was sold at London for forty pence,\r\nand the Northumbrians were driven to feed on dogs, horses, and other\r\nunwonted food. Pestilence followed in the train of famine. It was in\r\nvain that parliament passed laws, limiting the repasts of the barons'\r\nhouseholds to two courses of meat, and fixing the price of the chief\r\nsorts of victuals. The only result was that dealers refused to bring\r\ntheir produce to market. Then the legislation, passed in a panic, was\r\nrepealed in a panic. \"It is better,\" said a chronicler, \"to buy things\r\nat a high rate than not to be able to buy them at all.\"\r\n\r\nPrivate wars raged from end to end of south Britain. On the upper\r\nSevern, Griffith of Welshpool, the younger son of Griffith ap\r\nGwenwynwyn, laid regular siege to Powys castle, the stronghold of John\r\nCharlton, his niece's husband and his rival for the lordship of upper\r\nPowys. As Charlton was a courtier, Griffith attached himself to the\r\nordainers. After Bannockburn, the captivity of Hereford, the lord of\r\nBrecon, and the death without heirs of Gloucester, the lord of\r\nGlamorgan, removed the strongest restraints on the men of south Wales.\r\nThe royal warden of Glamorgan, Payne of Turberville, displaced\r\nGloucester's old officers. One of the sufferers was Llewelyn Bren, \"a\r\ngreat and powerful Welshman in those parts,\" who had held high office\r\nunder Earl Gilbert. In 1315 Llewelyn, after seeking justice in vain at\r\nthe king's court, rose in revolt against Turberville. He gathered the\r\nWelshmen on the hills, burst upon Caerphilly, while the constable was\r\nholding a court outside the castle, took the outer ward by surprise and\r\nburnt it to ashes. There was fear lest this revolt should be the\r\nstarting-point of a general Welsh rising. Llewelyn's hill strongholds\r\nthreatened Brecon on the north and the vale of Glamorgan on the south;\r\nand Hereford, then released from his Scottish captivity, was entrusted\r\nwith the suppression of the revolt. Before long all the lords of the\r\nmarch joined Hereford in stamping out the movement. Among them were the\r\ntwo Roger Mortimers, the Montagues and the Giffords, and Henry of\r\nLancaster, Earl Thomas's brother, and lord in his own right of Monmouth\r\nand Kidwelly. Overwhelmed by such mighty opponents, Llewelyn\r\nsurrendered to Hereford, hoping thus to save his followers.\r\n\r\nLancaster himself suffered from the spirit of anarchy that was abroad.\r\nHis own Lancashire vassals rose against his authority, under Adam\r\nBanaster, a former member of his household. Adam belonged to an\r\nimportant Lancashire family, which had long stood in close relations to\r\nWales, and had committed a homicide for which he despaired of pardon.\r\nHe now posed as the champion of the king against the earl, believing\r\nthat anything that caused trouble to Thomas would give no small delight\r\nat court. Lancaster showed more energy in upholding his own rights than\r\nin maintaining the honour of England. He raised such an overwhelming\r\nforce that Banaster, unable to hold the field against him, shut himself\r\nup in his house. His refuge was stormed and his head brought to Earl\r\nThomas as a trophy of victory. While Banaster was raiding Lancashire\r\nand Llewelyn south Wales, the Scots were devastating the country as far\r\nsouth as Furness, and Edward Bruce, King Robert's brother, was\r\nconquering Ireland. There was little wonder that Edward Bruce hoped to\r\ncross over to Wales when he had done his work in Ireland, or that the\r\nWelsh, buoyed up, as in the last generation, by the prophesies of\r\nMerlin, believed that the time was come when they would expel the\r\nSaxons, and win back the empire of Britain.\r\n\r\nOf much longer duration than the wars of Llewelyn Bren and Adam\r\nBanaster, were the formidable disturbances which raged for many years\r\nat Bristol. Fourteen Bristol magnates had long a preponderating\r\ninfluence in the government of the town. The commons bitterly resented\r\ntheir superiority and declared that every burgess should enjoy equal\r\nrights. A royal inquiry was ordered, but the judges, bribed, as was\r\nbelieved, by the fourteen, gave a decision which was unacceptable to\r\nthe commons. Lord Badlesmere, warden of the castle, sided with the\r\noligarchs, and thus the whole authority of the state was brought to\r\nbear against the popular party. But it was an easy matter to resist the\r\ngovernment of Edward II. The commons took arms and a riot broke out in\r\ncourt. Twenty men were killed in the disturbances, and the judges fled\r\nfor their lives. Eighty burgesses were proved by inquest at Gloucester\r\nto have been the ringleaders. As they refused to appear to answer the\r\ncharges, they were outlawed. Indignation at Bristol then rose to such a\r\nheight that the fourteen fled in their turn, and for more than two\r\nyears Bristol succeeded in holding out against the royal mandate. At\r\nlast, in 1316, the town was regularly besieged by the Earl of Pembroke.\r\nThe castle was not within the burgesses' power, and its _petrariae_,\r\nbreaking down the walls and houses of the borough, compelled the\r\ntownsmen to surrender. A few of the chief rebels were punished, but a\r\npardon was issued to the mass of the burgesses.\r\n\r\nMore dangerous than any of these troubles was the attack made by Edward\r\nBruce on the English power in Ireland. That power had been on the wane\r\nduring the last two generations. Edward I. had formed schemes for the\r\nbetter administration of the country, but little had come of them. The\r\nEnglish government in Dublin gradually lost such control as it had\r\npossessed over the remoter parts of the island. The shire organisation,\r\nset up in an earlier generation, became little more than nominal. The\r\nconstitutional movement of the thirteenth century extended to the\r\nisland, and the Irish parliament, then growing up out of the old\r\ncouncil, reflected in a blurred fashion the organisation of the English\r\nparliament of the three estates. But royal lieutenants and councils,\r\nshires and sheriffs, parliaments and justices had only the most\r\nsuperficial influence on Irish life. Real authority was divided between\r\nthe Norman lords of the plain and the Celtic chieftains of the hills.\r\nEach feudal lord hated his fellows, and bitter as were the feuds of\r\nFitzgeralds and Burghs, they were mild as compared with the rancorous\r\nhereditary factions which divided the native septs from each other.\r\nThese divisions alone made it possible for the king's officers to keep\r\nup some semblance of royal rule. If they were seldom obeyed, the\r\ndivisions in the enemies' camps prevented any chance of their being\r\noverthrown. Thus the Irish went on living a rude, turbulent life of\r\nperpetual purposeless war and bloodshed. Ireland was a wilder, larger,\r\nmore remote Welsh march, and the resemblance was heightened by the fact\r\nthat many of the Anglo-Norman principalities were in the hands of great\r\nEnglish or marcher families, and that the Irish foot-soldier played\r\nonly a less important part than the Welsh archer and pikeman among the\r\nlight-armed soldiers of the English crown.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to keep up a show of English government was to form an\r\nalliance between the crown and some of the baronial houses. Richard de\r\nBurgh, Earl of Ulster, the most powerful of the feudal lords of\r\nIreland, was the only one who at that period bore the title of earl. He\r\nhad long been interested in general English affairs, and his kinswomen\r\nhad intermarried into great British houses. One of his daughters\r\nmarried Robert Bruce when he was Earl of Carrick, and another was more\r\nrecently wedded to Earl Gilbert of Gloucester. Despite the Bruce\r\nconnexion, the Earl of Ulster was still trusted by the English party,\r\nand the king gave him the command of an Irish army which he had\r\nintended to send against Scotland in 1314. Richard was too busy\r\nfighting the Ulster clans of O'Donnell and O'Neil, and too jealous of\r\nthe Fitzgeralds, his feudal rivals, to throw his heart into the\r\nhopeless task of gathering together the two nations and many clans of\r\nIreland into a single host. The death of Earl Gilbert at Bannockburn\r\nbroke his nearest tie with England, and the release of Elizabeth Bruce\r\nin exchange for Hereford gave his daughter the actual enjoyment of the\r\nthrone of Scotland. His natural instincts as an Irishman and as a baron\r\nwere to restrain the power of his overlord. When the news of Bruce's\r\nvictory produced a great stir among the Irish clans, he stood aside and\r\nlet events take their course.\r\n\r\nThough the Gael of the Scottish Highlands played little part at\r\nBannockburn, the Irish rejoiced at the Scots' success as that of their\r\nkinsmen. \"The Kings of the Scots,\" said the Irish Celts, \"derive their\r\norigin from our land. They speak our tongue and have our laws and\r\ncustoms.\" However little true this was in fact, it was a good excuse\r\nfor some of the Irish clans to offer the throne of Ireland to the King\r\nof Scots. Robert rejected the proposal for himself, but was willing to\r\ngive his able and adventurous brother Edward the chance of winning\r\nanother crown for his house. Edward, \"who thought that Scotland was too\r\nlittle for his brother and himself,\" cheerfully fell in with the\r\nscheme. On May 25, 1315, he landed near Carrickfergus and received a\r\nrapturous welcome from the O'Neils, the greatest of the septs of the\r\nnorth-east. Before long all Celtic Ulster flocked to his banners, and\r\nEdmund Butler, then justice of Ireland, strove with little success to\r\nmake head against the Scottish invasion. The completeness of Bruce's\r\nunion with the native Irish gave him his best chance of attaining his\r\nobject. Up to this point the attitude of the Earl of Ulster had been\r\nmost undecided. He at last threw in his lot with the justiciar. When\r\nparties began to shape themselves it was clear that \"all the Irish of\r\nIreland\" were in league with Bruce. The danger was that \"a great part\r\nof the great lords and lesser English folk\" also joined the invader.\r\nConspicuous among these were the Lacys of Meath.\r\n\r\nEdward Bruce showed energy and vigour. He made his way southwards, and\r\nin September won a victory over the forces of the Earl of Ulster and\r\nthe justiciar at Dundalk, then in the south of Ulster. After this he\r\npushed into Meath and Leinster and was joined by the O'Tooles and the\r\nother clans of the Wicklow mountains, while the adhesion of Phelim\r\nO'Connor, King of Connaught, brought the whole of the Celtic west into\r\nhis alliance. The barons, however, took the alarm. During the winter\r\nButler contracted friendship with many of the Norman colonists. From\r\nthat time the struggle assumed the character of a war between Celtic\r\nIreland and feudal Ireland, the native clansmen and the Anglo-Norman\r\nsettlers. Thus, though Bruce and his wild allies found it easy to make\r\nthemselves masters of the open country, all the castles and towns were\r\nclosed to them and could only be won by long-continued efforts. Before\r\nlong, Butler drove them to the hills. Ere the winter was over, Edward\r\nfound it prudent to retire to Ulster.\r\n\r\nDuring 1316 the struggle raged unceasingly. Bruce was crowned King of\r\nIreland, the O'Neil, it was said, having abdicated his rights in his\r\nfavour. But the summer saw the utter defeat of the O'Connors by the\r\njusticiar at the bloody battle of Athenry, where King Phelim and the\r\nnoblest of his sept perished. A little later the King of Scots came to\r\nthe help of his brother. With his aid, Edward was able to reduce\r\nCarrickfergus, which had hitherto defied his efforts. Then the brothers\r\nled their forces from one end of Ireland to the other. Dublin prepared\r\nfor a siege by burning its suburbs and devastating the country around.\r\nBut though the two Bruces penetrated as far as Limerick, they did not\r\ncapture a single castle or a walled town. They lost so many men during\r\ntheir winter campaign, that they were forced in the spring to retire to\r\nUlster. The hopeless disunion of both parties in Ireland seemed likely\r\nto prolong the struggle indefinitely. The men of Dublin and the Earl of\r\nUlster were at feud with each other, and the citizens captured the earl\r\nand shut him up in Dublin castle. However little the earl could be\r\ntrusted, this was a step likely to throw all Ulster into the arms of\r\nthe Bruces. But a stronger justice of Ireland then superseded Edmund\r\nButler. Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, the mightiest baron of the Welsh\r\nmarch, and a man of real ability, rare energy, extreme ruthlessness,\r\nand savage cruelty, crossed over from Haverfordwest early in 1317 at\r\nthe head of a large force of marcher knights and men-at-arms, versed\r\nfrom their youth up in the traditions of Celtic warfare. Mortimer set\r\nhimself to work to break up the ill-assorted coalition that supported\r\nBruce. He released the Earl of Ulster from his Dublin prison; he\r\nprocured the banishment of the heads of the house of Lacy; he won over\r\nsome of the Irish septs to his side; he stimulated the civil war which\r\nhad devastated Connaught since the fall of the O'Connors. Edward Bruce\r\nwas once more confined to Ulster, where he still struggled on bravely.\r\nIn the autumn of 1318 he led a foray southwards, and met his fate in a\r\nskirmish near Dundalk on October 14, when his force was scattered in\r\nconfusion by John of Bermingham, one of the neighbouring lords. The\r\nfour quarters of the luckless King of Ireland were exposed in the four\r\nchief towns of the island as a trophy of victory, and Bermingham was\r\nrewarded by the new earldom of Louth.\r\n\r\nEdward Bruce's enterprise ended with his death, and Ireland rapidly\r\nsettled down into its normal condition of impotent turbulence. Though\r\nat first sight the invader utterly failed, yet he pricked the bubble of\r\nthe English power in Ireland. His gallant attempt at winning the throne\r\nis the critical event in a long period of Irish history. From the days\r\nof Henry III to the days of Edward Bruce, the lordship of the English\r\nkings in Ireland was to some extent a reality. From 1315 to the reign\r\nof Henry VIII, the English dominion was little more than a name as\r\nregards the greater part of Ireland.\r\n\r\nNo one attained success, in the years after Bannockburn,--neither\r\nBanaster, nor Llewelyn Bren, nor the Bristol commons nor Edward Bruce\r\nand his Irish allies. Before long, the incompetence of Lancaster became\r\nas manifest as the incompetence of Edward II. Lancaster's failure led\r\nto the dissolution of the baronial opposition into fiercely opposing\r\nfactions. Personal and territorial jealousies slowly undermined a unity\r\nwhich had always been more apparent than real. The Earl of Pembroke had\r\nnever forgiven the treachery of Deddington. Though Warwick was dead,\r\nPembroke still pursued Lancaster with unrelenting hatred. No partisan\r\nof prerogative, and an enemy of Edward's personal following, Earl Aymer\r\nseparated himself from his old associates and strove to form a middle\r\nparty between the faction of the king and the faction of Lancaster.\r\nWarerine, coarse, turbulent, and vicious, at once violent and crafty,\r\nstill acted with him. The lord of Conisborough had long grudged the\r\nmaster of Pontefract and Sandal his great position in Yorkshire. The\r\nnatural rivalries of neighbouring potentates were further emphasised by\r\npersonal animosity of the deadliest kind. Lancaster had long been at\r\nvariance with his wife, Alice Lacy. On May 9, 1317, the Countess of\r\nLancaster ran away from him, with the active help of Warenne and by the\r\nsecret contrivance of the king. Private war at once broke out between\r\nthe two earls. Lancaster was too strong for his enemy. Before winter\r\nhad begun, Conisborough and Warenne's other Yorkshire castles fell into\r\nhis hands. Lancaster's partisans even laid hold of the king's castle of\r\nKnaresborough, while other Lancastrian bands occupied Alton castle in\r\nStaffordshire. Intermittent hostilities continued until the summer of\r\n1318. Twice Edward himself went to the north, and on one occasion\r\nappeared in force outside Pontefract. But the more moderate of the\r\nbaronage managed to prevent open hostilities between the king and the\r\nearl. Lancaster was, as ever, fighting for his own hand. His\r\nself-seeking narrowness gave Pembroke the chance of winning for his\r\nmiddle party a preponderating authority.\r\n\r\nPembroke found more trustworthy allies than Warenne in Bartholomew,\r\nLord Badlesmere, the sometime instigator of the Bristol troubles, and a\r\nbitter opponent of Lancaster, and in Roger of Amory, the husband of one\r\nof the three co-heiresses who now divided the Gloucester inheritance.\r\nEdward, who had profited by the divisions of his enemies to revive the\r\ncourt party, formed a coalition between his friends and the followers\r\nof Pembroke. All lovers of order, of moderation, and of the supremacy\r\nof the law necessarily made common cause with them. Thus it followed\r\nthat the same machinery, which Lancaster a few years earlier had turned\r\nagainst the king, was now turned against him. An additional motive to\r\nbring peaceable Englishmen into line was found in the capture of\r\nBerwick by Bruce in April, 1318. After this negotiations for peace\r\nbegan. The king and Lancaster treated as two independent princes.\r\nLancaster was no longer supported by any prominent earl, and even his\r\nclerical friends were falling from him. Ordainers as jealous as\r\nArundel, royalists as fierce as Mortimer, served along with trimmers\r\nlike Pembroke and Badlesmere, in acting as mediators. Lancaster could\r\nno more resist than Edward could in 1312. On August 9 he accepted at\r\nLeek, in Staffordshire, the conditions drawn up for him.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Leek marks the triumph of the middle party and the\r\nremoval of Lancaster from the first place in the royal council. A\r\npardon was granted to him and his followers, but Thomas gained little\r\nelse by the compact. Pembroke and his friends showed themselves as\r\njealous of Edward as ever the ordainers had been. The ordinances were\r\nonce more confirmed, and a new council of seventeen was nominated,\r\nincluding eight bishops, four earls, four barons, and one banneret. The\r\nearls were Pembroke, Arundel, Richmond, and Hereford. Of these the\r\nBreton Earl of Richmond was the most friendly to the king, but it was\r\nsignificant to find so truculent a politician as Hereford making common\r\ncause with Pembroke. The most important of the four barons was Roger\r\nMortimer of Wigmore. Lancaster though not paramount was still powerful,\r\nbut his habit of absenting himself from parliaments made it useless to\r\noffer him a place in the council, and he was represented by a single\r\nbanneret, nominated by him. Of these councillors two bishops, one earl,\r\none baron, and Lancaster's nominee were to be in constant attendance.\r\nThey were virtually to control Edward's policy, and to see that he\r\nconsulted parliament in all matters that required its assent. A few\r\ndays after the treaty Edward and Lancaster met at Hathern, near\r\nLoughborough, and exchanged the kiss of peace. Roger of Amory and other\r\nmagnates of the middle party reconciled themselves to Lancaster, and he\r\ncondescendingly restored them to his favour. But he would not deign to\r\nadmit Hugh Despenser to his presence, and declared that he was still\r\nfree to carry on his quarrel against Warenne. In October, a parliament\r\nat York confirmed the treaty of Leek, adding new members to the council\r\nand appointing another commission to reform the king's household. From\r\nthat time until 1321, Pembroke and his friends controlled the English\r\nstate, though often checked both by the king and even more by\r\nLancaster, who still stood ostentatiously aloof from parliaments and\r\ncampaigns. These years, though neither glorious nor prosperous, were\r\nthe most peaceable and uneventful of the whole of Edward II.'s reign.\r\nThey are noteworthy for the only serious attempt made to check the\r\nprogress of the Scots after Bannockburn. From 1318 to 1320 king and\r\ncourt were almost continually in the north. York became the regular\r\nmeeting-place of parliaments for even a longer period.\r\n\r\nSince 1314, the Scots had mercilessly devastated the whole north of\r\nEngland. The population made little attempt at resistance, and sought\r\nto buy them off by large payments of money. The Scots took the cash and\r\nsoon came again for more. They wandered at will over the open country,\r\nand only the castles and walled towns afforded protection against them.\r\nTheir forays extended as far south as Lancashire and Yorkshire, and, so\r\nearly as 1315, Carlisle and Berwick were regularly besieged by them. It\r\nwas to no purpose that in 1317 the pope issued a bull insisting upon a\r\ntruce. The English welcomed an armistice on any terms, but the Scots'\r\ninterest was in the continuance of the war, and they paid no attention\r\nto the papal proposal. The result was a renewal of Bruce's\r\nexcommunication, and the placing of all Scotland under interdict. Yet\r\nno papal censures checked Robert's career or lessened his hold over\r\nScotland. Next year he showed greater activity than ever. In April,\r\n1318, he captured the town of Berwick by treachery. Peter of Spalding,\r\none of the English burgesses who formed the town guard, was bribed to\r\nallow a band of Scots to seize that section of the town wall of which\r\nhe was guardian. Then the intruders captured the gates and admitted\r\ntheir comrades. Thus the last Scottish town to be held by the English\r\nwent back to its natural rulers. The English burgesses were expelled,\r\nthough Bruce showed wonderful moderation, and few of his enemies were\r\nslain. Berwick castle held out for a time, until lack of victuals\r\ncaused its surrender. In May the Scots marched through Northumberland\r\nand Durham into Yorkshire, burnt Northallerton and Boroughbridge, and\r\nexacted a thousand marks from Ripon, as the price of respecting the\r\nchurch of St. Wilfred. They then spent three days at Knaresborough, and\r\nmade their way home through Craven.\r\n\r\nSuch successes show clearly enough that the treaty of Leek was not\r\nsigned a moment too soon. It was, however, too late for any great\r\neffort against the Scots in 1318. A strenuous endeavour was made to\r\nlevy a formidable expedition for 1319. In strict accordance with the\r\nordinances, the parliament, which met at York in May of that year,\r\nagreed that there should be a muster at Berwick for July 22, and\r\ngranted a liberal subsidy. An insolent offer of peace, coupled with a\r\npromise of freedom of life and limb to Bruce, should he resign his\r\ncrown, provoked from the Scots king the reply that Scotland was his\r\nkingdom both by hereditary right and the law of arms, and that he was\r\nindifferent whether he had peace with the English king or not. On July\r\n22, the feast of St. Mary Magdalen and the anniversary of Falkirk\r\nfight, the barons assembled at Newcastle. Thomas of Lancaster was there\r\nwith his brother Henry. Warenne, newly reconciled with Lancaster by a\r\nlarge surrender of lands, also attended, as did Pembroke, Arundel,\r\nHereford, and the husbands of the three Gloucester co-heiresses. There\r\nwas a braver show of earls than even in 1314. An offer of lands, when\r\nScotland was conquered, attracted a large number of volunteer infantry,\r\nwhile the cupidity of the seamen was appealed to by a promise of ample\r\nplunder. In August the host and fleet moved northwards, and closely\r\nbeset Berwick.\r\n\r\nThe Scots were too astute to offer battle. While the English were\r\nemployed at Berwick, Sir James Douglas led their main force into the\r\nheart of Yorkshire. Douglas hoped to capture Queen Isabella, who was\r\nstaying near York. A spy betrayed this design to the English, and\r\nIsabella was hurried off by water to Nottingham, while Douglas pressed\r\non into the heart of Yorkshire. The Yorkshiremen had to defend their\r\nown shire while their best soldiers were with the king at Berwick. A\r\nhastily gathered assembly of improvised warriors flocked into York.\r\nArchbishop Melton put himself at their head, and the clergy, both\r\nsecular and religious, formed a considerable element in the host. Then\r\nthey marched out against the Scots, and found them at Myton in\r\nSwaledale. The Scots despised the disorderly mob of squires and\r\nfarmers, priests and canons, monks and friars. \"These are not\r\nwarriors,\" they cried, \"but huntsmen. They will do nought against us.\"\r\nConcealing their movements by kindling great fires of hay, they bore\r\ndown upon the Yorkshiremen and put them to flight with much loss. The\r\nfight was called \"the white battle of Myton\" on account of the large\r\nnumber of white-robed monks who took part in it The archbishop escaped\r\nwith the utmost difficulty. Many fugitives were drowned in the Swale,\r\nand not one would have escaped had not night stopped the Scots'\r\npursuit. The victors then pushed as far south as Pontefract. On the\r\nnews of the battle, the besiegers of Berwick were dismayed. There was\r\ntalk of dividing the army, and sending one part to drive Douglas out of\r\nYorkshire while the other continued the siege. But the magnates, in no\r\nmood to run risks, insisted on an immediate return to England. Before\r\nEdward had reached Yorkshire, Douglas had made his way home over\r\nStainmoor and Gilsland. Thereupon the king sent back his troops, each\r\nman to his own house. The magnificent army had accomplished nothing at\r\nall. So inglorious a termination of the campaign naturally gave rise to\r\nsuspicions of treason. A story was spread abroad that Lancaster had\r\nreceived £4,000 from the King of Scots and had consequently done his\r\nbest to help his ally. The rumour was so seriously believed that the\r\nearl offered to purge himself by ordeal of hot iron. In despair Edward\r\nmade a two years' truce with the Scots. It was the best way of avoiding\r\nanother Bannockburn.\r\n\r\nTroublous times soon began again. Since Edward surrendered himself to\r\nthe guidance of Pembroke and Badlesmere, he had enjoyed comparative\r\nrepose and dignity. It was only when a great enterprise, like the Scots\r\ncampaign, was attempted that the evil results of anarchy and the\r\nstill-abiding influence of Lancaster made themselves felt. But Edward\r\nbore no love to Pembroke and his associates, and was quietly feeling\r\nhis way towards the re-establishment of the court party. His chief\r\nhelpers in this work were the two Despensers, father and son, both\r\nnamed Hugh. The elder Despenser, then nearly sixty years of age, had\r\ngrown grey in the service of Edward I. A baron of competent estate, he\r\ninherited from his father, the justiciar who fell at Evesham, an\r\nhereditary bias towards the constitutional tradition, but he looked to\r\nthe monarch or to the popular estates, rather than to the baronage, as\r\nthe best embodiment of his ideals. Ambitious and not over-scrupulous,\r\nhe saw more advantage to himself in playing the game of the king than\r\nin joining a swarm of quarrelsome opposition lords. From the beginning\r\nof the reign he had identified himself with Gaveston and the courtiers,\r\nand had incurred the special wrath of Lancaster and the ordainers.\r\nExcluded from court, forced into hiding, excepted from several\r\npacifications as he had been, Despenser never long absented himself\r\nfrom the court. His ambition was kindled by the circumstance that his\r\neldest son had become the most intimate personal friend of the king.\r\nBrought up as a boy in the household of Edward when Prince of Wales,\r\nthe ties of old comradeship gradually drew the younger Hugh into\r\nGaveston's old position as the chief favourite. Neither a foreigner nor\r\nan adventurer, Despenser had the good sense to avoid the worst errors\r\nof his predecessor. As chamberlain, he was in constant attendance on\r\nthe king; and having married Edward's niece Eleanor, the eldest of the\r\nGloucester co-heiresses, he sought to establish himself among the\r\nhigher aristocracy. Royal grants and offices rained upon father and\r\nson. The household officers were changed at their caprice. The only\r\nsafe way to the king's favour was by purchasing their good-will. Their\r\ngood fortune stirred up fierce animosities, and the barons showed that\r\nthey could hate a renegade as bitterly as a foreign adventurer.\r\n\r\nThe Despensers' ambition to attain high rank was the more natural from\r\nthe havoc which death had played among the earls. \"Time was,\" said the\r\nmonk of Malmesbury, \"when fifteen earls and more followed the king to\r\nwar; but now only five or six gave him their assistance.\" The five\r\nearldoms of Thomas of Lancaster meant the extinction of as many ancient\r\nhouses. The earldoms of Chester, Cornwall, and Norfolk had long been in\r\nthe king's hands. If the comital rank was not to be extinguished\r\naltogether, it had to be recruited with fresh blood. And who were so\r\nfit to fill up the vacant places as these well-born favourites?\r\n\r\nA little had been done under Edward II to remedy the desolation of the\r\nearldoms. The revival of the earldom of Cornwall in favour of Gaveston\r\nhad not been a happy experiment. But the king's elder half-brother,\r\nThomas of Brotherton, invested with the estates and dignities of the\r\nBigods, was made earl marshal and Earl of Norfolk. In 1321 the earldom\r\nof Kent, extinct since the fall of Hubert de Burgh, was revived in\r\nfavour of Edmund of Woodstock, the younger half-brother of the king.\r\nThe titular Scottish earldoms of some English barons, such as the\r\nUmfraville earls of Angus, kept up the name, if not the state of earls,\r\nand we have seen the reward of the victor of Dundalk in the creation of\r\na new earldom of Louth in Ireland. But there were certain hereditary\r\ndignities whose suspension seemed unnatural. Conspicuous among these\r\nwas the Gloucester earldom which, from the days of the valiant son of\r\nHenry I. to the death of the last male Clare at Bannockburn, had played\r\na unique part in English history.\r\n\r\nBoth the Despensers desired to be earls, and the younger Hugh wished\r\nthat the Gloucester earldom should be revived in his favour. Assured of\r\nthe good-will of the king, both had to contend against the jealousy of\r\nthe baronage and the exclusiveness of the existing earls. The younger\r\nHugh had also to reckon with his two brothers-in-law, with whom he had\r\ndivided the Clare estates. These were Hugh of Audley, who had married\r\nMargaret the widow of Gaveston, and Roger of Amory, the husband of\r\nElizabeth, the youngest of the Clare sisters. There had been difficulty\r\nenough in effecting the partition of the Gloucester inheritance among\r\nthe three co-heiresses. In 1317 the division was made, and Despenser had\r\nbecome lord of Glamorgan, which politically and strategically was most\r\nimportant of all the Gloucester lands.[1] Yet even then, Despenser was\r\nnot satisfied with his position. His rival Audley had been allotted\r\nNewport and Netherwent, while Amory had been assigned the castle of Usk\r\nand estates higher up the Usk valley. Annoyed that he should be a lesser\r\npersonage in south Wales than Earl Gilbert had been, Despenser began to\r\nintrigue against his wife's brothers-in-law. Each of the co-heirs had\r\nalready become deadly rivals. Their hostility was the more keen since\r\nthe three had already taken different sides in English politics.\r\nDespenser was the soul of the court faction; Amory was the ally of\r\nPembroke and Badlesmere, the men of the middle party; and Audley was an\r\nuncompromising adherent of Thomas of Lancaster. There was every chance\r\nthat each one of the three would have competent backing. To each the\r\ntriumph of his friends meant the prospect of his becoming Earl of\r\nGloucester.\r\n\r\n    [1] See for this, W.H. Stevenson, _A Letter of the Younger\r\n    Despenser in 1321_ in _Engl. Hist. Rev._, xii. (1897), 755-61.\r\n\r\nDespenser, abler and more restless than the others, and confident in\r\nthe royal favour, was the first to take the aggressive. He wished to\r\nbase his future greatness upon a compact marcher principality in south\r\nWales, and to that end not only laid his hands upon the outlying\r\npossessions of the Clares but coveted the lands of all his weaker\r\nneighbours. He took advantage of a family arrangement for the\r\nsuccession to Gower, to strike the first blow. The English-speaking\r\npeninsula of Gower, with the castle of Swansea, was still held by a\r\njunior branch of the decaying house of Braose, whose main marcher\r\nlordships had been divided a century earlier between the Bohuns and the\r\nMortimers. Its spendthrift ruler, William of Braose, was the last male\r\nof his race. He strove to make what profit he could for himself out of\r\nhis succession, and had for some time been treating with Humphrey of\r\nHereford. Gower was immediately to the south-west of Hereford's\r\nlordship of Brecon. Its acquisition would extend the Bohun lands to the\r\nsea, and make Earl Humphrey the greatest lord in south Wales. At the\r\nlast moment, however, Braose broke off with him and sought to sell\r\nGower to John of Mowbray, the husband of his daughter and heiress. When\r\nBraose died in 1320, Mowbray took possession of Gower in accordance\r\nwith the \"custom of the march\". The royal assent had not been asked,\r\neither for licence to alienate, or for permission to enter upon the\r\nestate. Despenser coveted Gower for himself. He had already got\r\nNewport, had he Swansea also he would rule the south coast from the\r\nLloughor to the Usk. Accordingly, he declared that the custom of the\r\nmarch trenched upon the royal prerogative, and managed that Gower\r\nshould be seized by the king's officers, as a first step towards\r\ngetting it for himself.\r\n\r\nDespenser's action provoked extreme indignation among all the marcher\r\nlords. They denounced the apostate from the cause of his class for\r\nupsetting the balance of power in the march, and declared that in\r\ntreating a lordship beyond the Wye like a landed estate in England,\r\nHugh had, like Edward I., \"despised the laws and customs of the march\".\r\nIt was easy to form a coalition of all the marcher lords against him.\r\nThe leaders of it were Humphrey of Hereford, Roger Mortimer of Chirk,\r\njustice of Wales, and his nephew, Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, the head\r\nof the house, who had overthrown Edward Bruce's monarchy of Ireland. As\r\nBraose co-heirs their position was unassailable. But every other baron\r\nhad his grievance. John of Mowbray resented the loss of Gower; Henry of\r\nLancaster feared for Monmouth and Kidwelly; Audley wished to win back\r\nNewport, and Amory, Usk. Behind the confederates was Thomas of\r\nLancaster himself, eager to regain his lost position of leadership. The\r\nleague at once began to wage war against Despenser in south Wales, and\r\napproached the court with a demand that he should be banished as a\r\ntraitor.\r\n\r\nEdward made his way to Gloucester in March, 1321, and strove to protect\r\nDespenser and to calm the wild spirits of the marchers. But private war\r\nhad already broken out after the marcher fashion, and the king retired\r\nwithout effecting his purpose. Left to themselves the marcher allies\r\neasily overran the Despenser lands, inherited or usurped. Neither\r\nCardiff nor Caerphilly held out long against them: the Welsh\r\nhusbandmen, like the English knights and barons of Glamorgan, were\r\nhostile to the Despensers. The king could do nothing to help his\r\nfriends. In May, Lancaster formed a league of northern barons in the\r\nchapter-house of the priory at Pontefract. In June, another northern\r\ngathering was held in the Norman nave of the parish church of\r\nSherburn-in-Elmet, a few miles to the north of Pontefract. This was\r\nattended by the Archbishop of York and two of his suffragans, and a\r\ngreat number of clergy, secular and regular, as well as by many barons\r\nand knights. It was in fact an informal parliament of the Lancastrian\r\nparty. A long list of complaints were drawn up which, under fair words,\r\ndemanded the removal of bad ministers, and among them the chamberlain.\r\nThe clerical members of the conference met separately at the rectory,\r\nwhere they showed more circumspection, but an equally partisan bias.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] Bp. Stubbs works all this out, _Chron. Ed. I. and II_.,\r\n    ii., pref., lxxxvi.-xc.\r\n\r\nThe conferences at Pontefract and Sherburn showed that Lancaster and\r\nthe northerners were in full sympathy with the men of the west. The\r\nmiddle party again made common cause with the followers of Lancaster.\r\nAmory's interests were sufficiently involved to make him an eager enemy\r\nof Despenser, and Badlesmere was almost as keen. Though Pembroke still\r\nprofessed to mediate, it was generally believed that he was delighted\r\nto get rid of the Despensers. Even Warenne took sides against them,\r\nthough the discredited earl was fast becoming of no account. Such being\r\nthe drift of opinion, the fate of the favourites was settled when the\r\nestates assembled in London in July. Edward had delayed a meeting of\r\nparliament as long as he could, and was helpless in its hands. Great\r\npains were taken this time to prevent the repetition of the\r\ninformalities which had attended the attack on Gaveston. There was an\r\nunprecedented gathering of magnates, who came to the parliament with a\r\nlarge armed following, encamped like an army in all the villages to the\r\nnorth of the city. The commons were fully represented, and the clerical\r\nestate was expressly summoned. Articles were at once drawn up against\r\nthe Despensers. They had aspired to royal power; had turned the heart\r\nof the king from his subjects; had excited civil war, and had taught\r\nthat obedience was due to the crown rather than to the king. This last\r\ncharge came strangely from those who had urged that doctrine as a\r\npretext for withdrawing support from Gaveston. It is a good\r\nillustration of the tendency of the Despensers to cloak their personal\r\nambitions with loud-sounding constitutional phrases.\r\n\r\nThe peers pronounced sentence of banishment and forfeiture against both\r\nthe elder and the younger Hugh. They were not to be recalled save by\r\nconsent of the peers in parliament assembled. The easy revolution was\r\ncompleted by the issuing of pardons to nearly five hundred members of\r\nthe triumphant coalition. The elder Despenser at once withdrew to the\r\ncontinent. The younger Hugh found friends among the mariners of the\r\nCinque Ports. These at first protected him in England, and then put at\r\nhis disposal a little fleet of vessels with which, when driven from the\r\nland, he took to piracy in the narrow seas.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Despensers was brought about very much after the same\r\nfashion as the first exile of Gaveston. Like Gaveston, they speedily\r\nreturned, and in circumstances which suggest an even closer parallel\r\nwith the events that led to the recall of the Gascon. The triumphant\r\ncoalition in each case fell to pieces as soon as it had done its\r\nimmediate work. Once more the loss of his friend and comrade stirred up\r\nEdward to an energy and perseverance such as he never displayed on\r\nother occasions. But the second triumph of the king assumed a more\r\ncomplete character than his earlier snatched victory. Accident favoured\r\nEdward's design of bringing back his favourites, and throwing off once\r\nmore the baronial thraldom. On October 13, 1321, Queen Isabella, on her\r\nway to Canterbury, claimed hospitality at Leeds castle, situated\r\nbetween Maidstone and the archiepiscopal city. The castle belonged to\r\nBadlesmere, whose wife was then residing there, with his kinsman,\r\nBartholomew Burghersh, and a competent garrison. Lady Badlesmere\r\nrefused to admit the queen, declaring that, without her lord's orders,\r\nshe could not venture to entertain any one. Bitterly indignant at the\r\ninsult, the queen took up her quarters in the neighbouring priory and\r\nattempted to force an entrance. The castle, however, was not to be\r\ntaken by the hasty attack of a small company. Six of Isabella's\r\nfollowers were slain, and the attempt was abandoned. Isabella called\r\nupon her husband to avenge her; and the king at once resolved to\r\ncapture Leeds castle at any cost, and prepared to undertake the\r\nenterprise in person. He offered high wages to all crossbowmen,\r\narchers, knights, and squires who would follow him to Leeds, and\r\nsummoned the levies of horse and foot from the towns and shires of the\r\nsouth-east. His trust in the loyalty of his subjects met with an\r\nunexpectedly favourable response. In a few days a large army gathered\r\nround the king under the walls of Leeds. Among the many magnates who\r\nappeared among the royal following were six earls: Pembroke,\r\nBadlesmere's own associate; the king's two brothers, Norfolk and Kent;\r\nWarenne, Richmond, and Arundel, who as Despenser's kinsman felt himself\r\nbound to fight on his side. On October 23 the castle was closely\r\nbesieged by this overwhelming force, and on October 31 was forced to\r\nsurrender. Burghersh was shut up in the Tower and Lady Badlesmere in\r\nDover castle. Thirteen of the garrison, \"stout men and valiant,\" were\r\nhanged by the angry king.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege of Leeds, the magnates of the march, headed by\r\nHereford and Roger Mortimer, collected a force at Kingston-on-Thames,\r\nwhere they were joined by Badlesmere. But they dared not advance\r\ntowards the relief of the Kentish castle, and, after a fortnight they\r\ndispersed to their own homes. Lancaster hated Badlesmere so bitterly\r\nthat he made no move against the king, and sullenly bided his time in\r\nthe north. His inaction paralysed the barons as effectively as in\r\nearlier days it had hindered the plans of the king. Flushed with his\r\nvictory, Edward gradually unfolded his designs. His tool, Archbishop\r\nReynolds, summoned a convocation of the southern province for December\r\n1 at St. Paul's, and obtained from the assembled clergy the opinion\r\nthat the proceedings against the Despensers were invalid. On January 1,\r\n1322, Reynolds solemnly declared this sentence in St. Paul's. Edward\r\ndid not wait for the archbishop. Attended by many of the warriors who\r\nhad fought at Leeds, he marched to the west, occupying on his journey\r\nthe lands and castles of his enemies. He kept his Christmas court at\r\nCirencester, and thence advanced towards the Severn. As the inaction of\r\nLancaster kept the northern barons quiet, Edward's sole task was to\r\nwreak his revenge on the marcher lords. They were unprepared for\r\nresistance, and waited in vain for Lancaster to come to their help.\r\nWithout a leader, they made feeble and ill-devised efforts to oppose\r\nthe king's advance. Their command of the few bridges over the Severn\r\nprevented the king from crossing the river, and leading his troops\r\ndirectly into the march. Foiled at Gloucester, Worcester, and\r\nBridgnorth, Edward made his way up the stream to Shrewsbury. The two\r\nMortimers, who held the town and the passage of the river, could have\r\nstopped him if they had chosen. But they feared to undertake strong\r\nmeasures while Lancaster's action remained uncertain. They suffered\r\nEdward to cross the stream and surrendered to him. The collapse of the\r\nfiercest of the marcher lords frightened the rest into surrender.\r\nEdward wandered back through the middle and southern marches, occupying\r\nwithout resistance the main strongholds of his enemies. At Hereford, he\r\nsharply rebuked the bishop for upholding the barons against their\r\nnatural lord. At Berkeley, he received from Maurice of Berkeley the\r\nkeys of the stately fortress which was so soon to be the place of his\r\nlast humiliation. Early in February, he was back at Gloucester, where,\r\non February 11, he recalled the Despensers.\r\n\r\nHumphrey of Hereford, Roger of Amory, and a few other marchers managed\r\nto escape the king's pursuit, and rode northwards to join Thomas of\r\nLancaster. Thomas had long been ready at Pontefract with his followers\r\nin arms. But he let the time for effective action slip, and was only\r\ngoaded into doing anything when the fugitives from the march impressed\r\nhim with the critical state of affairs. The quarrel of king and barons\r\nwas not the only trouble besetting England. The two years' truce with\r\nScotland had expired, and Robert Bruce was once more devastating the\r\nnorthern counties. But neither Edward nor Lancaster cared anything for\r\nthis. Andrew Harclay, the governor of Carlisle, strongly urged the king\r\nto defend his subjects from the Scots rather than make war against\r\nthem. Edward answered that rebels must be put down before foreign\r\nenemies could be encountered, and pressed northwards with his\r\nvictorious troops.\r\n\r\nLancaster was then besieging Tickhill, a royal castle in southern\r\nYorkshire. After wasting three weeks before its walls, he led his force\r\nsouth to Burton-on-Trent, which he occupied on March 10. Edward soon\r\napproached the Trent on his northward march. The barons thereupon lost\r\ncourage, and, abandoning the defence of the passage over the river, fled\r\nnorthwards to Pontefract, the centre of Lancaster's power in Yorkshire.\r\nEdward advanced against them, taking on his road Lancaster's castle of\r\nTutbury, where Roger of Amory was captured, mortally wounded. The\r\nLancastrians were panic-stricken. They fled from Pontefract as they had\r\nfled from Burton, retreating northwards, probably simply to avoid the\r\nking, possibly to join hands with Robert Bruce. On March 16 the\r\nfugitives reached Boroughbridge, on the south bank of the Ure, where a\r\nlong narrow bridge, hardly wide enough for horsemen in martial array,\r\ncrossed the stream. The north bank of the river, and the approaches to\r\nthe bridge, were held in force by the levies of Cumberland and\r\nWestmoreland which Barclay had summoned at the king's request, in order\r\nto prevent a junction between the Lancastrians and the Scots. Barclay\r\nwas a brave and capable commander and had well learnt the lessons of\r\nScottish warfare.[1] He dismounted all his knights and men-at-arms, and\r\narranged them on the northern side of the river, along with some of his\r\npikemen. The rest of the pikemen he ordered to form a \"schiltron\" after\r\nthe Scottish fashion, so that their close formation might resist the\r\ncavalry of which the Lancastrian force consisted. He bade his archers\r\nshoot swiftly and continually at the enemy.\r\n\r\n    [1] For the tactics of Boroughbridge see _Engl. Hist. Review_,\r\n    xix. (1904), 711-13.\r\n\r\nSeeing this disposition of the hostile force, the Lancastrian army\r\ndivided. One band, under Hereford and Roger Clifford, dismounted and\r\nmade for the bridge, which was defended by the schiltron of pikemen.\r\nThe rest of the men-at-arms remained on horseback and followed\r\nLancaster, to a ford near the bridge, whence, by crossing the water,\r\nthey could take the schiltron in flank. Neither movement succeeded.\r\nHereford and Clifford advanced, each with one attendant, to the bridge.\r\nNo sooner had the earl entered upon the wooden structure than he was\r\nslain by a Welsh spearman, who had hidden himself under it, and aimed a\r\nblow at Humphrey through the planking. Clifford was severely wounded,\r\nand escaped with difficulty. Discouraged by the loss of their leaders,\r\nthe rest of the troops made only a feeble effort to force the passage.\r\nThe same evil fortune attended the division that followed Lancaster.\r\nThe archers of Harclay obeyed his orders so well that the Lancastrian\r\ncavalry scarcely dared enter the water. Lancaster lost his nerve, and\r\nbesought Harclay for a truce until the next morning. His request was\r\ngranted, but during the night all the followers of Hereford dispersed,\r\nthinking that there was no need for them to remain after the death of\r\ntheir lord. Lancaster's own troops were likewise thinned by desertions.\r\nThe sheriff of York came up early in the morning with an armed force\r\nfrom the south, joined Harclay, and cut off the last hope of retreat.\r\nFurther resistance being useless, Lancaster, Audley, Clifford, Mowbray,\r\nand the other leaders surrendered in a body.\r\n\r\nEdward was then at Pontefract in the chief castle of his deadliest\r\nenemy. Thither the prisoners of Boroughbridge were sent for their\r\ntrial, and there they were hastily condemned by a body of seven earls\r\nand numerous barons, presided over by the king himself. Lancaster, not\r\nallowed to say a word in his defence, was at once sentenced to death as\r\na rebel and a traitor. In consideration of his exalted rank, the\r\ngrosser penalties of treason were commuted, as in the case of Gaveston,\r\nto simple decapitation. On the morning of March 22 Thomas was led out\r\nof his castle, clad in the garb of a penitent and mounted on a sorry\r\nsteed. He was conducted to a little hill outside the walls. The crowd\r\nmocked at his sufferings and in scorn called him \"King Arthur\". In two\r\nor three blows of the axe, his head was struck off from his body. Nor\r\nwas he the only victim. Audley, spared his life by reason of his\r\nmarriage to the king's niece, was, like the two Mortimers, consigned to\r\nprison. Clifford and Mowbray were hanged at York, and Badlesmere at\r\nCanterbury. In all, more than twenty knights and barons paid the\r\npenalty of death.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to waste much pity on Lancaster. He was the victim of his\r\nown fierce passions and, still more, of his own utter incompetence. His\r\nattitude all through the crisis had been inept in the extreme, and the\r\npoor fight that he made for his life at Boroughbridge was a fitting\r\nconclusion to a feeble career. But with all his faults he remained\r\npopular to the end, especially with the clergy and commons. He was\r\nhailed as a martyr to freedom and sound government. Pilgrimages were\r\nmade to the scene of his death, and miracles were wrought with his\r\nrelics. A chapel arose on the little hill dedicated to his worship, and\r\na loud cry arose for his canonisation. The abuse made by his enemies of\r\ntheir victory only strengthened his reputation among the people. The\r\ntragedy of his fall appealed to the rude sympathies of the\r\nnorth-countrymen, and the merit of the cause atoned in their minds for\r\nthe weakness of the man.\r\n\r\nA parliament met at York on May 2, where the triumph of the king\r\nreceived its consummation. The Despensers had more advanced\r\nconstitutional ideas than Lancaster, and pains were taken that this\r\nparliament should completely represent the three estates. It was a\r\nnovel feature that twelve representatives of the commons of north Wales\r\nand twelve of the commons of south Wales attended, on this occasion, to\r\nspeak on behalf of the region where the troubles had first begun. With\r\nthe full approval of the estates, the ordinances were solemnly revoked,\r\nas infringing the rights of the crown. The important principle was laid\r\ndown that \"matters which are to be established for the estate of the\r\nking and for the estate of the realm shall be treated, accorded, and\r\nestablished in parliament by the king and by the council of the\r\nprelates, earls, and barons, and the commonalty of the realm\". Thus,\r\nwhile the repeal of the ordinances seemed based upon their infringement\r\nof the royal prerogative, it was at least implied that they were also\r\ninvalid because they were the work of a council of barons only, and not\r\nof a full parliament of the estates. This declaration of the necessity\r\nof popular co-operation in valid legislation is the most important\r\nconstitutional advance of the reign of Edward II. It is a significant\r\ncomment on the limitations of the baronial opposition that the\r\nordinances should be the last great English law in the passing of which\r\nthe commons were not consulted, and that a royalist triumph should be\r\nthe occasion of the declaration of a vital principle.\r\n\r\nThe king's friends then received their rewards. Harclay was made Earl\r\nof Carlisle and the elder Despenser became Earl of Winchester. Fear of\r\nthe marcher lords, even in their prison, withheld from the younger Hugh\r\nthe title, though hardly the authority, of Earl of Gloucester. In other\r\nways also the Despensers were anxious to prevent their victory\r\nsuggesting too much of a reaction. Before parliament separated, it\r\nadopted a new series of ordinances confirming the Great Charter and\r\nre-enacting in more constitutional fashion some portions of the laws of\r\n1312, which aimed at protecting the subject and strengthening the\r\nadministration. Grants of men and money were made to fight the Scots,\r\nand once more the new customs were allowed to swell the royal revenue.\r\nThus the revolution was completed. Edward, Gaveston, Lancaster, and\r\nPembroke had each in their turn been tried and found wanting. Thanks to\r\nthe jealousies of the barons, his own spasmodic energy, and the\r\nacuteness of the Despensers, Edward was still to have another chance,\r\nunder the guidance of his new friends. We shall see how the restored\r\nrule of the Despensers was blighted by the same incompetence and\r\nselfishness which had ruined their predecessors in power. The triumph\r\nof the Despensers proved but the first act in the tragic fall of Edward\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF EDWARD II. AND THE RULE OF ISABELLA AND MORTIMER.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the deliberations of the parliament of York, the truce with\r\nBruce expired, and forthwith came the news that the Scots had once more\r\ncrossed the border. On this occasion Bruce raided the country from\r\nCarlisle to Preston, burning every open town on his way, though sparing\r\nmost of the religious houses. At Cartmel, Lancaster, and Preston,\r\nfavoured monastic buildings alone stood entire amidst the desolation\r\nwrought by the Scots. No effective opposition was offered to them, and\r\nafter a three weeks' foray, they recrossed the Solway.\r\n\r\nAs in 1314 and 1318, the restoration of order was followed by an\r\nattempt to put down Bruce. In August, 1322, Edward assembled his forces\r\nat Newcastle and invaded Scotland. Berwick was unsuccessfully besieged\r\nand the Lothians laid waste. The Scots still had the prudence to\r\nwithdraw beyond the Forth, and avoid battle in the open field. By the\r\nbeginning of September, pestilence and famine had done their work on\r\nthe invaders. Unable to find support in the desolate fields of Lothian,\r\nthe, English returned to their own land, having accomplished nothing.\r\nThe Scots followed on their tracks, but with such secrecy that they\r\npenetrated into the heart of Yorkshire before Edward was aware of their\r\npresence. In October they suddenly swooped down on the king, when he\r\nwas staying at Byland abbey. Some troops which accompanied him were\r\nencamped on a hill between Byland and Rievaux. They were attacked by\r\nthe Scots and defeated; their leader, John of Brittany, was taken\r\nprisoner, and Edward only avoided capture by a precipitate flight from\r\nByland to Bridlington. All Yorkshire was reduced to abject terror, and\r\nEdward's hosts, the canons of Bridlington, removed with all their\r\nvaluables to Lincolnshire, and sent one of their number to Bruce at\r\nMalton to purchase immunity for their estates. After a month the Scots\r\nwent home, leaving famine, pestilence, and misery in their train. The\r\nDespensers thus proved themselves not less incompetent to defend\r\nEngland than Thomas of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nAs the state afforded no protection, each private person had to make\r\nthe best terms he could for himself. Even the king's favourite, Louis\r\nof Beaumont, the illiterate Bishop of Durham, entered into negotiations\r\nwith the Scots, while the Archbishop of York issued formal permission\r\nto religious houses of his diocese to treat with the excommunicated\r\nfollowers of Bruce. Not only timid ecclesiastics, but well-tried\r\nsoldiers found in private dealings with the Scots the only remedy for\r\ntheir troubles. After the Byland surprise, Harclay, the new Earl of\r\nCarlisle, the victor of Boroughbridge, and the warden of the marches,\r\ndismissed his troops, sought out Bruce at Lochmaben, and made an\r\narrangement with him, by which it was resolved that a committee of six\r\nEnglish and six Scottish magnates should be empowered to conclude peace\r\nbetween the two countries on the basis of recognising him as King of\r\nScots. There was great alarm at court when Harclay's treason was known.\r\nA Cumberland baron, Anthony Lucy, was instructed to apprehend the\r\nculprit, and forcing his way into Carlisle castle by a stratagem,\r\ncaptured the earl with little difficulty. In March, 1323, Harclay\r\nsuffered the terrible doom of treason. He justified his action to the\r\nlast, declaring that his only motive was a desire to procure peace, and\r\nconvincing many of the north-countrymen of the innocence of his\r\nmotives. To such a pass had England been reduced that those who\r\nhonestly desired that the farmers of 'Cumberland should once more till\r\ntheir fields in peace, saw no other means of gaining their end than by\r\ncommunication with the enemies of their country.\r\n\r\nThe disgrace of Byland and the tragedy of Carlisle showed that it was\r\nidle to pretend to fight the Scots any longer. Negotiations for peace\r\nwere entered upon; Pembroke and the younger Despenser being the chief\r\nEnglish commissioners. Peace was found impossible, as English pride\r\nstill refused to recognise the royal title of King Robert, but a\r\nthirteen years' truce was arranged without any difficulty. This treaty\r\nof 1323 practically concluded the Scottish war of independence. Bruce\r\nthen easily obtained papal recognition of his title, though English\r\nill-will long stood in the way of the remission of his sentence of\r\nexcommunication. His martial career, however, was past, and he could\r\ndevote his declining years to the consolidation of his kingdom and the\r\nrestoration of its material prosperity. He reorganised the national\r\narmy, built up a new nobility by distributing among his faithful\r\nfollowers the estates of the obstinate friends of England, and first\r\ncalled upon the royal burghs of Scotland to send representatives to the\r\nScottish parliament. He had made Scotland a nation, and nobly redeemed\r\nthe tergiversation and violence of his earlier career.\r\n\r\nAmong Harclay's motives for treating with the Scots had been his\r\ndistrust of the Despensers. As generals against the Scots and as\r\nadministrators of England, they manifested an equal incapacity. Their\r\ngreed and insolence revived the old enmities, and they proved strangely\r\nlacking in resolution to grapple with emergencies. Nevertheless they\r\nruled over England for nearly five years in comparative peace. This\r\nperiod, unmarked by striking events, is, however, evidence of the\r\nexhaustion of the country rather than of the capacity of the Earl of\r\nWinchester and the lord of Glamorgan. The details of the history bear\r\nwitness to the relaxation of the reins of government, the prevalence of\r\nriot and petty rebellion, the sordid personal struggles for place and\r\npower, the weakness which could neither collect the taxes, enforce\r\nobedience to the law, nor even save from humiliation the most trusted\r\nagents of the government.\r\n\r\nThe Despensers' continuance in power rested more on the absence of\r\nrivals than on their own capacity. The strongest of the royalist earls,\r\nAymer of Pembroke, died in 1324. As he left no issue, his earldom\r\nswelled the alarmingly long roll of lapsed dignities. None of the few\r\nremaining earls could step into his place, nor give Edward the wise\r\ncounsel which the creator of the middle party had always provided.\r\nWarenne was brutal, profligate, unstable, and distrusted; Arundel had\r\nno great influence; Richmond was a foreigner, and of little personal\r\nweight, and the successors of Humphrey of Hereford and Guy of Warwick\r\nwere minors, suspected by reason of their fathers' treasons. The only\r\nnew earl was Henry of Lancaster, who in 1324 obtained a partial\r\nrestitution of his brother's estates and the title of Earl of\r\nLeicester. Prudent, moderate, and high-minded, Henry stood in strong\r\ncontrast to his more famous brother. But the tragedy of Pontefract and\r\nhis unsatisfied claim on the Lancaster earldom stood between Henry and\r\nthe government, and the imprudence of the Despensers soon utterly\r\nestranged him from the king, though he was the last man to indulge in\r\nindiscriminate opposition, and Edward dared not push his powerful\r\ncousin to extremities. In these circumstances, the king had no wise or\r\nstrong advisers whose influence might counteract the Despensers. His\r\nloneliness and isolation made him increasingly dependent upon the\r\nfavourites.\r\n\r\nThe older nobles were already alienated, when the Despensers provoked a\r\nquarrel with the queen. Isabella was a woman of strong character and\r\nviolent passions, with the lack of morals and scruples which might have\r\nbeen expected from a girlhood passed amidst the domestic scandals of\r\nher father's household. She resented her want of influence over her\r\nhusband, and hated the Despensers because of their superior power with\r\nhim. The favourites met her hostility by an open declaration of\r\nwarfare. In 1324 the king deprived her of her separate estate, drove\r\nher favourite servants from court, and put her on an allowance of a\r\npound a day. The wife of the younger Hugh, her husband's niece, was\r\ndeputed to watch her, and she could not even write a letter without the\r\nLady Despenser's knowledge. Isabella bitterly chafed under her\r\nhumiliation. She was, she declared, treated like a maidservant and made\r\nthe hireling of the Despensers. Finding, however, that nothing was to\r\nbe gained by complaints, she prudently dissembled her wrath and waited\r\npatiently for revenge.\r\n\r\nThe Despensers' chief helpers were among the clergy. Conspicuous among\r\nthem were Walter Stapledon, Bishop of Exeter, the treasurer, and Robert\r\nBaldock, the chancellor. The records of Stapledon's magnificence\r\nsurvive in the nave of his cathedral church, and in Exeter College,\r\nOxford; but the great builder and pious founder was a worldly, greedy,\r\nand corrupt public minister. So unpopular was he that, in 1325, it was\r\nthought wise to remove him from office. Thereupon another building\r\nprelate, William Melton, Archbishop of York, whose piety and charity\r\nlong intercourse with courtiers had not extinguished, abandoned his\r\nnorthern flock for London and the treasury. But the best of officials\r\ncould do little to help the unthrifty king. Edward was so poorly\r\nrespected that he could not even obtain a bishopric for his chancellor.\r\nOn two occasions the envoys sent to Avignon, to urge Baldock's claims\r\non vacant sees, secured for themselves the mitre destined for the\r\nminister. In this way John Stratford became Bishop of Winchester and\r\nWilliam Ayermine, Bishop of Norwich. Edward had not even the spirit to\r\nshow manifest disfavour to these self-seeking prelates, but his\r\ninaction was so clearly the result of weakness that it involved no\r\ngratitude, and the two bishops secretly hated the ruling clique, as\r\nlikely to do them an evil turn if it dared. Nor were the older prelates\r\nbetter contented or more loyal. The primate Reynolds was deeply\r\nirritated by Melton's appointment as treasurer. Burghersh, the Bishop\r\nof Lincoln, was a nephew of Badlesmere, and anxious to avenge his\r\nuncle. Adam Orleton, Bishop of Hereford, was a dependant of the\r\nMortimers, who took his surname from one of their Herefordshire manors.\r\nForgiven for his share in the revolt of 1322, he cleverly contrived in\r\n1324 the escape of his patron, Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, from the\r\nTower. The marcher made his way to France, but his ally felt the full\r\nforce of the king's wrath. He was deprived of his temporalities, and,\r\nwhen the Church spread her ægis over him, the court procured the\r\nverdict of a Herefordshire jury against him. Thus the impolicy of the\r\ncrown combined the selfish worldling with the zealot for the Church in\r\na common opposition. Like Isabella, Orleton bided his time, and Edward\r\nfeared to complete his disgrace.\r\n\r\nIn such ways the king and the Despensers proclaimed their incapacity to\r\nthe world. The Scottish truce, the wrongs of Henry of Lancaster, the\r\nhumiliation of the queen, the alienation of the old nobles, the fears\r\nof greedy prelates,--each of these was remembered against them.\r\nGradually every order of the community became disgusted. The feeble\r\nefforts of Edward to conciliate the Londoners met with little response.\r\nWeak rule and the insecurity of life and property turned away the heart\r\nof the commons from the king. It was no wonder that men went on\r\npilgrimage to the little hill outside Pontefract, where Earl Thomas had\r\nmet his doom, or that rumours spread that the king was a changeling and\r\nno true son of the great Edward. But though the power of the king and\r\nthe Despensers was thoroughly undermined, the absence of leaders and\r\nthe general want of public spirit still delayed the day of reckoning.\r\nAt last, the threatening outlook beyond the Channel indirectly\r\nprecipitated the crisis.\r\n\r\nThe relations of France and England remained uneasy, despite the\r\nmarriage of two English kings in succession to ladies of the Capetian\r\nhouse. The union of Edward I. and Margaret of France had not done much\r\nto help the settlement of the disputed points in the interpretation of\r\nthe treaty of Paris of 1303, and the match between Edward II and his\r\nstepmother's niece had been equally ineffective. The restoration of\r\nGascony in 1303 had never been completed, and in the very year of the\r\ntreaty a decree of the parliament of Paris had withdrawn the homage of\r\nthe county of Bigorre from the English duke. Within the ceded\r\ndistricts, the conflict of the jurisdictions of king and duke became\r\nincreasingly accentuated. Having failed to hold Gascony by force of\r\narms, Philip the Fair aspired to conquer it by the old process of\r\nstealthily undermining the traditional authority of the duke. Appeals\r\nto Paris became more and more numerous. The agents of the king wandered\r\nat will through Edward's Gascon possessions, and punished all loyalty\r\nto the lawful duke by dragging the culprits before their master's\r\ncourts. The ineptitude which characterised all Edward's subordinates\r\nwas particularly conspicuous among his Gascon seneschals and their\r\nsubordinates. While the English king's servants drifted on from day to\r\nday, timid, without policy, and without direction, the agents of\r\nFrance, well trained, energetic, and determined, knew their own minds\r\nand gradually brought about the end which they had clearly set before\r\nthemselves. In vain did bitter complaints arise of the aggressions of\r\nthe officers of Philip. It was to no purpose that conferences were\r\nheld, protocols drawn up, and much time and ink wasted in discussing\r\ntrivialities. Neither Edward nor Philip wished to push matters to\r\nextremities. To the former the policy of drift was always congenial.\r\nThe latter was content to wait until the pear was ripe. It seemed that\r\nin a few more years Gascony would become as thoroughly subject to the\r\nFrench crown as Champagne or Normandy.\r\n\r\nPhilip the Fair died in 1314, and was followed in rapid succession by\r\nhis three sons. The first of these, Louis X., had, like Edward II., to\r\ncontend against an aristocratic reaction, and died in 1316, before he\r\ncould even receive the homage of his brother-in-law. A king of more\r\nenergy than Edward might have profited by the difficult situation which\r\nfollowed Louis' death. For a time there was neither pope, nor emperor,\r\nnor King of France. But Philip V. mounted the French throne when his\r\nbrother's widow had given birth to a daughter, and continued the policy\r\nof his predecessors with regard to Gascony. Again the disputes between\r\nNorman and Gascon sailors threatened, as in 1293, to bring about a\r\nrupture. The ever-increasing aggressions of the suzerain culminated in\r\nsummoning Edward's own seneschal of Saintonge to appear before the\r\nFrench king's court. Edward neglected to do homage, alleging his\r\npreoccupation in the Scottish war and similar excuses. But the\r\nthreatened danger soon passed away, for again the interests and fears\r\nof both parties postponed the conflict. In avoiding any alliance with\r\nthe Scots, the French king showed a self-restraint for which Edward\r\ncould not but be grateful. In 1320 Edward performed in person his\r\nlong-delayed homage at Amiens, though his grievances against his\r\nbrother-in-law still remained unredressed. In 1322 the death of Philip\r\nV. renewed the troublesome homage question in a more acute form.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] For the relations of Edward II. and Philip V. see Lehugeur,\r\n    _Hist. de Philippe le Long_, pp. 240-66 (1897).\r\n\r\nThe obligation of performing homage to a rival prince weighed with\r\nincreasing severity on the English kings at each rapid change of\r\noccupants of the throne of France. The same pretexts were again brought\r\nforward, as sufficient reasons for postponing or evading the unpleasant\r\nduly. But before the question was settled a new source of trouble arose\r\nin the affair of Saint-Sardos, which soon plunged the two countries into\r\nopen war. The lord of Montpezat, a vassal of the Duke of Gascony, built\r\na _bastide_ at Saint-Sardos upon a site which he declared was held by\r\nhimself of the duke, but which the French officials claimed as belonging\r\nto Charles IV. The dispute was taken before the parliament of Paris,\r\nwhich decided that the new town belonged to the King of France.\r\nThereupon a royal force promptly took possession of it. Irritated at\r\nthis high-handed action, the lord of Montpezat invoked the aid of\r\nEdward's seneschal of Gascony, who attacked and destroyed the _bastide_\r\nand massacred the French garrison.[1] The answer of Charles the Fair to\r\nthis aggression was decisive. Gascony was pronounced sequestrated and\r\nCharles of Valois, the veteran uncle of the king, was ordered to enforce\r\nthe sentence at the head of an imposing army.\r\n\r\n    [1] See for this affair Bréquigny, _Mémoire sur les différends\r\n    entre la France et l'Angleterre sous Charles le Bel, in Mém. de\r\n    l'Acad. des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres_, xli. (1780), pp.\r\n    641-92. M. Déprez is about to publish a Chancery Roll of Edward\r\n    II. which includes all the official acts relating to it.\r\n\r\nThus, in the summer of 1324 England and France were once more at war.\r\nBut while England remonstrated and negotiated, France acted. Norman\r\ncorsairs swept the Channel and pillaged the English coasts. Ponthieu\r\nyielded without resistance. Early in August, Charles of Valois entered\r\nthe Agenais, and on the 15th Agen opened its gates. The victorious\r\nFrench soon appeared before La Réole, where alone they encountered real\r\nresistance. Edmund, Earl of Kent, who had made vain attempts to procure\r\npeace at Paris, had been sent in July to act as lieutenant of\r\nAquitaine. He had not sufficient force at his command to venture to\r\nmeet the Count of Valois in the open field, and threw himself into La\r\nRéole. The rocky height, crowned with a triple wall, and looking down\r\non the vineyards and cornfields of the Garonne, defied for weeks the\r\nskill of the eminent Lorrainer engineers who directed Charles of\r\nValois' siege train. But when Charles announced to Edmund that he would\r\ncarry the town by assault, if not surrendered within four days, the\r\ntimid earl signed a truce from September to Easter, and was allowed to\r\nwithdraw to Bordeaux. A mere fringe of coast-land still remained\r\nfaithful to the English duke, when Charles of Valois went back to\r\nParis, having victoriously terminated his long and chequered career.\r\nBefore the end of 1325 he died.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] Petit, _Charles de Valois_, pp. 207-15 (1900), gives the\r\n    fullest modern account of these transactions.\r\n\r\nThe truce involved a renewal of the negotiations. Bishop Stratford and\r\nWilliam Ayermine, the astute chancery clerk, were commissioned in\r\nNovember, 1324, to treat with the French, but made little progress in\r\ntheir delicate task. At this stage Isabella, inspired probably by Adam\r\nOrleton, came forward with a proposal. She besought her husband to\r\nallow her to visit her brother, the French king, and use her influence\r\nwith him to procure peace and the restitution of Gascony. With the\r\nstrange infatuation which marked all the acts of Edward and his\r\nfavourites, Isabella's proposal was adopted, and in March, 1325, the\r\nqueen crossed the Channel and made her way to her brother's court. The\r\nsummer was consumed in negotiating a treaty, by which Edward's French\r\nfiefs were to be restored to him in their integrity, as soon as he had\r\nperformed homage to the new king. Meanwhile the English garrison of\r\nGascony was to withdraw to Bayonne, leaving the rest of the duchy in\r\nthe hands of a French seneschal. Edward agreed to these terms, and put\r\nGascony into Charles's hands. He was still unwilling to compromise his\r\ndignity by performing homage, while the Despensers were mortally afraid\r\nof his going to France, lest it should remove him from their influence.\r\nIsabella then made a second suggestion. She persuaded her brother to\r\nexcuse the personal homage of her husband, if Edward would invest his\r\nyoung son, Edward, with Gascony and Ponthieu, and send him in his stead\r\nto tender his feudal duly. This also was agreed to by the English king,\r\nand in September the young prince, then about thirteen years old, was\r\nappointed Duke of Aquitaine and Count of Ponthieu, and despatched to\r\njoin his mother at Paris, where he performed homage to his uncle.\r\n\r\nIt was expected that Gascony and Ponthieu would then be restored, and\r\nthat the queen and her son would return to England. But Charles IV.\r\nperpetrated a clever piece of trickery which showed how far off a real\r\nsettlement still was. He \"restored\" to Edward those parts of Gascony\r\nwhich had been peacefully surrendered to him in the summer, and\r\nannounced that he should keep the Agenais and La Réole, as belonging to\r\nFrance by right of Charles of Valois' recent conquest. Bitterly\r\nmortified at this treachery, Edward took upon himself the title of\r\n\"governor and administrator of his firstborn, Edward, Duke of\r\nAquitaine, and of his estates\". By this technical subtlety, he thought\r\nhimself entitled to resume the control of the ceded districts and\r\nresist the attack which was bound to follow hard upon the new breach.\r\nOnce more Charles IV. pronounced the sequestration of the duchy, and\r\ndespite Edward's efforts, his power crumbled away before the peaceful\r\nadvent of the French troops, charged with the execution of their\r\nmaster's edict.\r\n\r\nLong before the last Gascon castles had opened their gates to Charles's\r\nofficers, new developments at Paris made the question of Aquitaine a\r\nsubordinate matter. Despite the breach of the negotiations, Isabella\r\nand her son still tarried at the French court. In answer to Edward's\r\nrequests for their return, she sent back excuse after excuse, till his\r\npatience was fairly exhausted. At last, on December 1, 1325, Edward\r\nperemptorily ordered his wife to return home, and warned her not to\r\nconsort with certain English traitors in the French court. The Duke of\r\nAquitaine was similarly exhorted to return, with his mother if he\r\ncould, but if not, without her. The reference to English traitors shows\r\nthat Edward was aware that Isabella had already formed that close\r\nrelation with the exiled lord of Wigmore which soon ripened into an\r\nadulterous connexion. Inspired by Roger Mortimer, Isabella declared\r\nthat she was in peril of her life from the malice of the Despensers,\r\nand would never go back to her husband as long as the favourites\r\nretained power. A band of the exiles of 1322 gathered round her and her\r\nparamour, and sought to bring about their restoration as champions of\r\nthe loudly expressed grievances of the queen, and the rights of her\r\nyoung son. The king's ambassadors at Paris, Stratford and Ayermine,\r\nrecently made Bishop of Norwich by a papal provision which ignored the\r\nelection of Robert Baldock the chancellor, united themselves with the\r\nqueen and the fugitive marcher. With them, too, was associated Edmund\r\nof Kent, who was allowed by the treaty to return from Gascony through\r\nFrance. Bishop Stapledon, who had accompanied the queen to France, was\r\nso alarmed at the turn events were taking, that he fled in disguise to\r\nreveal his suspicions to the king. Thus England, already exposed to a\r\ndanger of a French war, was threatened with the forcible overthrow of\r\nthe Despensers and the reinstatement of Isabella by armed invaders.\r\n\r\nBy the spring of 1326 the scandalous relations of Isabella and Mortimer\r\nwere notorious all over England and France. Charles IV. grew disgusted\r\nat his sister's doings, and gave no countenance to her schemes.\r\nIsabella accordingly withdrew from Paris with her son and her paramour,\r\nand made her way to the Netherlands. There she found refuge in the\r\ncounty of Hainault, whose lord, William II, of Avesnes, was won over to\r\nsupport her by a contract to marry the Duke of Aquitaine to his\r\ndaughter Philippa. A large advance from Philippa's marriage portion was\r\nemployed in hiring a troop of knights and squires of Hainault and\r\nHolland. John of Hainault, brother of the count, took joint command of\r\nthis band with Roger Mortimer. The ports of Holland and Zealand, both\r\nof which counties were united with Hainault under William II.'s rule,\r\noffered ample facilities for their embarkation.\r\n\r\nOn September 23, 1326, the queen and her followers took ship at\r\nDordrecht in Holland. Next day the fleet cast anchor in the port of\r\nOrwell, and that same day the expedition was landed and marched to\r\nWalton, where it spent the first night on English soil. The gentry of\r\nSuffolk and Essex flocked to the standard of the queen, who declared\r\nthat she had come to avenge the wrongs of Earl Thomas of Lancaster and\r\nto drive the Despensers from power. Thomas of Brotherton, the earl\r\nmarshal, made common cause with the invaders, and Henry, Earl of\r\nLeicester, hastened to associate himself with the champions of his\r\nmartyred brother. A great force of native Englishmen swelled the\r\nqueen's host, and reduced to insignificance the little band of\r\nHainaulters and Hollanders. There was no resistance. Isabella marched\r\nto Bury St. Edmunds, \"as if on a pilgrimage,\" and thence to Cambridge,\r\nwhere she tarried several days with the canons of Barnwell. From\r\nCambridge she moved on to Baldock, where she despoiled the chancellor's\r\nmanors and took his brother captive. At Dunstable, her next halt, she\r\nwas on a great highway, within thirty-three miles of London.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of his wife's landing, Edward threw himself on the\r\ncompassion of the Londoners, but met with so cold a reception that\r\nearly in October he withdrew to Gloucester. Besides the chancellor and\r\nthe two Despensers, the only magnates of mark who remained faithful to\r\nhim were the brothers-in-law, Edmund, Earl of Arundel, and Earl\r\nWarenne. On Edward's retreat from London, Bishop Stratford made his way\r\nto the capital, where he joined with Archbishop Reynolds in a hollow\r\npretence of mediation. The Londoners gladly welcomed the queen's\r\nmessengers and soon rose in revolt in her favour. They plundered and\r\nburnt the house of the Bishop of Exeter, who fled in alarm to St.\r\nPaul's. Seized at the very door of the church, Stapledon was brutally\r\nmurdered by the mob in Cheapside, where his naked body lay exposed all\r\nday. Immediately after this, Reynolds fled in terror to his Kentish\r\nestates, where he waited to see which was the stronger side. The king's\r\nyounger son, John of Eltham, a boy of nine, who had been left behind by\r\nhis father in the Tower, was proclaimed warden of the capital.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of Edward's flight to the west, Isabella went after him in\r\npursuit. On the day of Stapledon's murder, she had advanced as far as\r\nWallingford, where, posing as the continuer of the policy of the lords\r\nordainers, she issued a proclamation denouncing the Despensers. Thence\r\nshe made her way to Oxford, where Bishop Orleton, who had already\r\njoined her, preached a seditious sermon before the university and the\r\nleaders of the revolt. Taking as his text, \"My head, my head,\" he\r\ndemonstrated that the sick head of the state could not be restored by\r\nall the remedies of Hippocrates, and would therefore have to be cut\r\noff. This was the first intimation that the insurgents would not be\r\ncontent with the fall of the Despensers. From Oxford, Isabella and\r\nMortimer hurried to Gloucester, whence Edward had already fled to the\r\nyounger Despenser's palatinate of Glamorgan. From Gloucester, they\r\npassed on through Berkeley to Bristol, where the elder Despenser, the\r\nEarl of Winchester, was in command. The feeling of the burgesses of the\r\nsecond town in England was so strongly adverse that the earl was unable\r\nto defend either the borough or the castle. In despair he opened the\r\ngates on October 26 to the queen, and was immediately consigned,\r\nwithout trial or inquiry, to the death of a traitor. After proclaiming\r\nthe Duke of Aquitaine as warden of the realm during his father's\r\nabsence, the queen's army marched on Hereford, where Isabella remained,\r\nwhile the Earl of Leicester, accompanied by a Welsh clerk, named Rhys\r\nap Howel, was sent, with part of the army to hunt out the king.\r\n\r\nAfter his flight from Gloucester, Edward had wandered through the Welsh\r\nmarch to Chepstow, whence he took ship, hoping to make sail to Lundy,\r\nwhich Despenser had latterly acquired, and perhaps ultimately to\r\nIreland. But contrary winds kept him in the narrows of the Bristol\r\nChannel, and on October 27 he landed again at Cardiff. A few days later\r\nhe was at Caerphilly, but afraid to entrust himself to the protection\r\nof the mightiest of marcher castles, he moved restlessly from place to\r\nplace in Glamorgan and Gower, imploring the help of the tenants of the\r\nDespensers, and issuing vain summonses and commissions that no one\r\nobeyed. Discovered by the local knowledge of Rhys ap Howel, or betrayed\r\nby those whom the Welshman's gold had corrupted, Edward was captured on\r\nNovember 16 in Neath abbey. With him Baldock and the younger Despenser\r\nwere also taken. On November 20 the favourite was put to death at\r\nHereford, while Baldock, saved from immediate execution by his clerkly\r\nprivilege, was consigned to the cruel custody of Orleton, only to\r\nperish a few months later of ill-treatment. To Hereford also was\r\nbrought Edmund of Arundel, captured in Shropshire, and condemned to\r\nsuffer the fate of the Despensers. The king was entrusted to the\r\ncustody of Henry of Leicester, who conveyed him to his castle of\r\nKenilworth, where the unfortunate monarch passed the winter, \"treated\r\nnot otherwise than a captive king ought to be treated\".\r\n\r\nIt only remained to complete the revolution by making provision for the\r\nfuture government of England. With this object a parliament was\r\nsummoned, at first by the Duke of Aquitaine in his father's name, and\r\nafterwards more regularly by writs issued under the great seal. It met\r\non January 7, 1327, at Westminster, and, after the York precedent of\r\n1322, contained representatives of Wales as well as of the three\r\nestates of England. Orleton, the spokesman of Mortimer, asked the\r\nestates whether they would have Edward II. or his son as their ruler.\r\nThe London mob loudly declared for the Duke of Aquitaine, and none of\r\nthe members of parliament ventured to raise a voice in favour of the\r\nunhappy king, save four prelates of whom the most important was the\r\nsteadfast Archbishop Melton. The southern primate, deserting his old\r\nmaster, declared that the voice of the people was the voice of God.\r\nStratford drew up six articles, in which he set forth that Edward of\r\nCarnarvon was incompetent to govern, led by evil counsellors, a\r\ndespiser of the wholesome advice of the \"great and wise men of the\r\nrealm,\" neglectful of business, and addicted to unprofitable pleasures;\r\nthat by his lack of good government he had lost Scotland, Ireland, and\r\nGascony; that he had injured Holy Church, and had done to death or\r\ndriven into exile many great men; that he had broken his coronation\r\noath, and that it was hopeless to expect amendment from him.\r\n\r\nEven the agents of Mortimer shrunk from the odium of decreeing Edward's\r\ndeposition, and the more prudent course was preferred of inducing the\r\nking to resign his power into his son's hands. An effort to persuade\r\nthe captive monarch to abdicate before his estates, was defeated by his\r\nresolute refusal. Thereupon a committee of bishops, barons, and judges\r\nwas sent to Kenilworth to receive his renunciation in the name of\r\nparliament. On January 20, Edward, clothed in black, admitted the\r\ndelegates to his presence. Utterly unmanned by misfortune, the king\r\nfell in a deep swoon at the feet of his enemies. Leicester and\r\nStratford raised him from the ground, and, on his recovery, Orleton\r\nexhorted him to resign his throne to his son, lest the estates,\r\nirritated by his contumacy, should choose as their king some one who\r\nwas not of the royal line. Edward replied that he was sorry that his\r\npeople were tired of his rule, but that being so, he was prepared to\r\nyield to their wishes, and make way for the Duke of Aquitaine. On this,\r\nSir William Trussell, as proctor of the three estates, formally\r\nrenounced their homage and fealty, and Sir Thomas Blount, steward of\r\nthe household, broke his staff of office, and announced that the royal\r\nestablishment was disbanded. Thus the calamitous reign of Edward of\r\nCarnarvon came to a wretched end. His utter inefficiency as a king\r\nmakes it impossible to lament his fate. Yet few revolutions have ever\r\nbeen conducted with more manifest self-seeking than that which hurled\r\nEdward from power. The angry spite of the adulterous queen, the fierce\r\nvengeance and greed of Roger Mortimer, the craft and cruelty of\r\nOrleton, the time-serving cowardice of Reynolds, the stupidity of Kent\r\nand Norfolk, the party spirit of Stratford and Ayermine, can inspire\r\nnothing but disgust. Among the foes of Edward, Henry of Leicester alone\r\nbehaved as an honourable gentleman, anxious to vindicate a policy, but\r\ncareful to subordinate his private wrongs to public objects. Though his\r\nname and wrongs were ostentatiously put forward by the dominant\r\nfaction, it is clear from the beginning that he was only a tool in its\r\nhands, and that the reversal of the sentence of Earl Thomas was but the\r\npretext by which the schemers and traitors sought to capture the\r\ngovernment for their own selfish ends.\r\n\r\nThe resignation of the king was promptly reported to parliament. On\r\nJanuary 24 the Duke of Aquitaine was proclaimed Edward III., and from\r\nthe next day his regnal years were reckoned as beginning. Henry of\r\nLeicester dubbed him knight, and on January 20 he was crowned in\r\nWestminster Abbey. A few days later the young king met his parliament.\r\nA standing council was appointed to carry on the administration during\r\nhis nonage. Of this body the Earl of Leicester acted as chief, though\r\nmost of his colleagues were partisans of Mortimer and the queen.\r\nOrleton, who was made treasurer, continued to pull the wires as the\r\nconfidential agent of Isabella and Mortimer. A show of devotion to the\r\ngood old cause was thought politic, and therefore the sentences of 1322\r\nwere revoked, so that Earl Henry, restored to all his brother's\r\nestates, was henceforth styled Earl of Lancaster. The commons went\r\nbeyond this in petitioning for the canonisation of Earl Thomas and\r\nArchbishop Winchelsea. The revolution was consummated by a new\r\nconfirmation of the charters.\r\n\r\nEven in the first flush of victory, Isabella and Mortimer were too\r\ninsecure and too bitter to allow Edward of Carnarvon to remain quietly\r\nin prison under the custody of the Earl of Lancaster. As long as he was\r\nalive, he might always become the possible instrument of their\r\ndegradation. At Orleton's instigation the deposed king was transferred\r\nin April from his cousin's care to that of two knights, Thomas Gurney\r\nand John Maltravers. He was promptly removed from Kenilworth and\r\nhurried by night from castle to castle until, after some sojourn at\r\nCorfe, he was at last immured at Berkeley. Every indignity was put upon\r\nhim, and the systematic course of ill-treatment, to which he was\r\nsubjected, was clearly intended to bring about his speedy death. But\r\nthe robust constitution of the athlete rose superior to the\r\npersecutions of his torturers, and to save further trouble he was\r\nbarbarously murdered in his bed on the night of September 21. Piercing\r\nshrieks from the interior of the castle told the peasantry that some\r\ndire deed was being perpetrated within its gloomy walls. Next day it\r\nwas announced that the lord Edward had died a natural death, and his\r\ncorpse was exposed to the public view that suspicion might be averted.\r\nHe was buried with the state that became a crowned king in the\r\nBenedictine Abbey Church of St. Peter, Gloucester. A few years later\r\nthe piety or remorse of Edward III. erected over his father's remains\r\nthe magnificent tomb which still challenges our admiration by the\r\ndelicacy of its tabernacle work and the artistic beauty of the\r\nsculptured effigy of the murdered monarch.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy of Edward's end soon caused his misdeeds to be forgotten,\r\nand ere long the countryside flocked on pilgrimage to his tomb, as to\r\nthe shrine of a saint. By a curious irony the burial place of Edward of\r\nCarnarvon rivalled in popularity the chapel on the hill at Pontefract\r\nwhere Thomas of Lancaster had perished by Edward's orders. Like his\r\ncousin, Edward became a popular, though not a canonised, saint. From\r\nthe offerings made at his tomb the monks of Gloucester were in time\r\nsupplied with the funds that enabled them to recast their romanesque\r\nchoir in the newer \"perpendicular\" fashion of architecture, and\r\nembellish their church with all the rich additions which contrast so\r\nstrangely with the grim impressiveness of the stately Norman nave.\r\nThere was only one impediment to the people's worship of the dead king.\r\nThe secrecy which enveloped his end led to rumours that he was still\r\nalive, and the prevalence of these reports soon proved almost as great\r\na source of embarrassment to his supplanters, as his living presence\r\nhad been in the first months of their unhallowed power.\r\n\r\nIt was not easy for Isabella and Mortimer to restore the waning\r\nfortunes of England at home and abroad. We shall see that it was only\r\nby an almost complete surrender that they procured peace with France\r\nand a partial restoration of Gascony. In Scotland they were even less\r\nfortunate. Robert Bruce, though broken in health and spirits, took up\r\nan aggressive attitude, and it was found necessary to summon the feudal\r\nlevies to meet on the border in the summer of 1327 in order to repel\r\nhis attack. While the troops were mustering at York, a fierce fight\r\nbroke out in the streets, between the Hainault mercenaries, under John\r\nof Hainault, and the citizens. So threatening was the outlook that it\r\nwas thought wise to send the Hainaulters back home. From this accident\r\nit happened that the young king went forth to his first campaign,\r\nattended only by his native-born subjects. The Scots began operations\r\nby breaking the truce and overrunning the borders. The campaign\r\ndirected against them was as futile as any of the last reign, and the\r\nEnglish, though three times more numerous than the enemy, dared not\r\nprovoke battle. This inglorious failure may well have convinced\r\nMortimer that the best chance of maintaining his power was to make\r\npeace at any price. Early in 1328, the negotiations for a treaty were\r\nconcluded at York. During their progress, Edward, who was at York to\r\nmeet his parliament, was married to Philippa of Hainault.\r\n\r\nThe Scots treaty was confirmed in April by a parliament that met at\r\nNorthampton. All claim to feudal superiority over Scotland was\r\nwithdrawn; Robert Bruce was recognised as King of Scots, and his young\r\nson David was married to Joan of the Tower, Edward III.'s infant\r\nsister. This surrender provoked the liveliest indignation, and men\r\ncalled the treaty of Northampton the \"shameful peace,\" and ascribed it\r\nto the treachery or timorousness of the queen and her paramour. But it\r\nis hard to see what other solution of the Scottish problem was\r\npracticable. For many years Bruce had been _de facto_ King of Scots,\r\nand any longer hesitation to withhold the recognition which he coveted\r\nwould have been sure to involve the north of England in the same\r\ndesolation as that which he had inflicted before the truce of 1322. But\r\nthe founder of Scottish independence was drawing near to the end of his\r\ncareer. His health had long been undermined by a terrible disease which\r\nthe chroniclers thought to be leprosy. He died in 1329, and on his\r\ndeath-bed he bethought him of how he, who had shed so much Christian\r\nblood, had never been able to fulfil his vow of crusade. Accordingly he\r\nentreated James Douglas, his faithful companion-in-arms, to go on\r\ncrusade against the Moors of Granada, taking with him the heart of his\r\ndead master. Douglas fulfilled the request, and perished in Spain,\r\nwhither he had carried the heart of the Scottish liberator. With the\r\naccession of the little David Bruce, new troubles began for Scotland,\r\nthough danger from England was for the moment averted by the English\r\nmarriage and the treaty of Northampton.\r\n\r\nThe ill-will produced by the \"shameful peace\" spread far and wide the\r\nprofound dislike for Mortimer which pity for the fate of Edward had\r\nfirst aroused in the breasts of Englishmen. The greedy marcher was at\r\nno pains to make himself popular. Holding no great office of state, he\r\nstrove to rule through his creatures Orleton, the treasurer, and the\r\nhardly less subservient chancellor, Bishop Hotham of Ely, or through\r\nlay partisans such as Sir Oliver Ingham and Sir Simon Bereford. But his\r\nbest chance of remaining in power was through the besotted infatuation\r\nof the queen-mother, whose relations with him were not concealed from\r\nthe public eye by any elaborate parade of secrecy. He still posed as\r\nthe inheritor of the tradition of the lords ordainers, and never failed\r\nto put as much of the responsibility of his rule as he could on Henry\r\nof Lancaster and the old baronial leaders. But with all his force and\r\nenergy, he was too narrowly selfish and grasping to take much trouble\r\nto frame an elaborate policy. As an administrator he was as incompetent\r\nas either Thomas of Lancaster or the Despensers.\r\n\r\nMortimer's chief care was to add office to office, and estate to\r\nestate, in order that he might establish his house as supreme over all\r\nWales and its march. Besides his own enormous inheritance, he ruled\r\nover Ludlow and Meath in the right of his wife, Joan of Joinville, the\r\nheiress of the Lacys. He had inherited Chirk and the other lands of his\r\nuncle, the sometime justice of Wales, who had died in Edward II.'s\r\nprison; and he procured for himself a grant of his uncle's old office\r\nfor life, so that, while as justice of Wales he lorded it over the\r\nprincipality, as head of the Mortimers he could dominate the whole\r\nmarch. To complete his ascendency in the march became his great\r\nambition. He obtained the custody of Glamorgan, the stronghold of his\r\nsometime rival, Hugh Despenser the younger. To this were added Oswestry\r\nand Clun, the Fitzalan march in western Shropshire, forfeited to the\r\ncrown by the faithfulness with which Edmund Fitzalan, the late Earl of\r\nArundel, had laid down his life for Edward II. Minor grants of lands,\r\noffices, wardships, and pensions were constantly lavished upon him by\r\nthe complacency of his mistress. In Ireland he received complete\r\npalatine franchises over Trim, Meath, and Louth, along with the custody\r\nof the estates of the infant Earl of Kildare, the chief of the Leinster\r\nGeraldines. He extended his connexions by marrying his seven daughters\r\nto the heads of great families, and where possible to men of marcher\r\nhouses. He soon numbered among his sons-in-law the representatives of\r\nthe Charltons of Powys, the Hastingses of Abergavenny, now the chief\r\nheirs of Aymer of Pembroke, the Audleys of the Shropshire march, the\r\nBeauchamps of Warwick, the Berkeleys, the Grandisons, and the Braoses.\r\nAnxious to extend his dignity as well as his power, he procured his\r\nnomination as Earl of the March of Wales, \"a title,\" says a chronicler,\r\n\"hitherto unheard of in England\". As earl of the march and justice of\r\nthe principality, he ruled the lands west of the Severn with little\r\nless than regal sway. His banquets, his tournaments, his pious\r\nfoundations even, dazzled all men by their splendour.\r\n\r\nMortimer was created Earl of March in the parliament held in October,\r\n1328, at Salisbury, where John of Eltham was made Earl of Cornwall and\r\nJames, Butler of Ireland, Earl of Ormonde. His assumption of this new\r\ntitle at last roused the sluggish indignation of Earl Henry of\r\nLancaster, who felt that his own marcher interests were compromised,\r\nand bitterly resented the vain use made of his name, while he was\r\ncarefully kept without any control of policy. He refused to attend the\r\nSalisbury parliament, though he and his partisans mustered in arms in\r\nthe neighbourhood of that city. Civil war seemed imminent, and\r\nMortimer's Welshmen devastated Lancaster's earldom of Leicester, but\r\nArchbishop Meopham (who had lately succeeded Reynolds in the primacy)\r\nmanaged to patch up peace. Not long afterwards Lancaster was smitten\r\nwith blindness, and was thenceforth unable to take an active part in\r\npublic affairs. Mortimer again triumphed for the moment, and, with\r\ncruel malice, excepted Lancaster's confidential agents from the pardon\r\nwhich he was forced to extend to the earl. His success over Lancaster\r\nwas materially facilitated by the weakness of Edmund, Earl of Kent,\r\nwho, after joining with Earl Henry in his refusal to attend the\r\nSalisbury parliament, deserted him at the moment of the capture of\r\nLeicester by the Earl of March. But his treachery did not save him from\r\nMortimer's revenge. In conjunction with the queen, Mortimer plotted to\r\nlure on Earl Edmund to ruin. Their agents persuaded him that Edward II.\r\nwas still alive and imprisoned in Corfe castle, and urged him to\r\nrestore his brother to liberty. The earl rose to the bait, and agreed\r\nto be party to an insurrection which was to restore Edward of Carnarvon\r\nto freedom, if not to his throne. When Kent was involved in the meshes,\r\nhe was suddenly arrested in the Winchester parliament of March, 1330,\r\nand accused of treason. Convicted by his own speeches and letters, he\r\nwas adjudged to death by the lords, and on March 19 beheaded outside\r\nthe walls of the city.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Kent convinced Lancaster that his fate would not be long\r\ndelayed, and that his best chance of saving himself and his cause lay\r\nin stirring up the king to energetic action against the Earl of March.\r\nThe death of his uncle irritated Edward, who at seventeen was old\r\nenough to feel the degrading nature of his thraldom, and was eager to\r\ngovern the kingdom of which he was the nominal head. In June, 1330, the\r\nbirth of a son, the future Black Prince, to Edward and Philippa seems\r\nto have impressed on the young monarch that he had come to man's\r\nestate. Lancaster accordingly found him eager to shake off the yoke of\r\nhis mother's paramour. The opportunity came in October, 1330, when the\r\nmagnates assembled at Nottingham to hold a parliament there. Isabella\r\nand Mortimer took up their abode in the castle, where Edward also\r\nresided. Suspicions were abroad, and the castle was closely guarded by\r\nMortimer's Welsh followers. Sir William Montague, a close friend of\r\nEdward's, was chosen to strike the blow, and lay outside with a band of\r\ntroops. Some rumour of the plot seems to have leaked out, and on\r\nOctober 19 Mortimer angrily denounced Montague as a traitor, and\r\naccused the king of complicity with his designs. But Montague was safe\r\noutside the castle, and, when evening fell, all that Mortimer could do\r\nwas to lock the gates and watch the walls. William Eland, constable of\r\nthe castle, had been induced to join the conspiracy, and had revealed\r\nto Montague a secret entrance into the stronghold. On that very night,\r\nMontague and his men-at-arms effected an entrance through an\r\nunderground passage into the castle-yard, where Edward joined them.\r\nThey then made their way up to Mortimer's chamber, which as usual was\r\nnext to that of the queen. Two knights, who guarded the door, were\r\nstruck down, and the armed band burst into the room. After a desperate\r\nscuffle, the Earl of March was secured. Hearing the noise, the queen\r\nrushed into the room, and though Edward still waited without, cried,\r\nwith seeming consciousness of his share in the matter, \"Fair son, have\r\npity on the gentle Mortimer\". Her entreaties were unavailing, and the\r\nfallen favourite was hurried, under strict custody, to London.\r\n\r\nEdward then issued a proclamation announcing that he had taken the\r\ngovernment of England into his own hands. Parliament, prorogued to\r\nWestminster, met on November 26, and its chief business was the trial\r\nof Mortimer before the lords. He was charged with accroaching to\r\nhimself the royal power, stirring up dissension between Edward II and\r\nthe queen, teaching Edward III. to regard the Earl of Lancaster as his\r\nenemy, deluding Edmund of Kent into believing that his brother was\r\nalive and with procuring his execution, accepting bribes from the Scots\r\nfor concluding the disgraceful peace, and with perpetrating grievous\r\ncruelties in Ireland. The lords, imitating the evil precedents set\r\nduring Mortimer's time of power, condemned him without trial or chance\r\nof answer to the accusations made against him. On November 29 the\r\nfallen earl was paraded through London from his prison in the Tower to\r\nTyburn Elms, and was there hanged on the common gallows. His vast\r\nestates were forfeited to the crown. His accomplice, Sir Simon\r\nBereford, suffered the same fate; but Sir Oliver Ingham, another of his\r\nassociates, was pardoned. Edward discreetly drew a veil over his\r\nmother's shame. Mortimer's notorious relations with her were not\r\nenumerated in the accusations brought against him, and Isabella, though\r\nremoved from power and stripped of some of her recent acquisitions, was\r\nallowed to live in honourable retirement on her dower manors.\r\nScrupulously visited by her dutiful son, she wandered freely from house\r\nto house, as she felt disposed. She died in 1358 at her castle of\r\nHertford, in the habit of the Poor Clares--a sister order of the\r\nFranciscans. The later tradition that she was kept in confinement at\r\nCastle Rising has only this slender foundation in fact that Castle\r\nRising was one of her favourite places of abode. With her withdrawal\r\nfrom public life Edward III.'s real reign begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE PRELIMINARIES OF THE HUNDRED YEARS' WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward III. had just entered upon his nineteenth year when he became\r\nking in fact as well as in name. In person he was not unworthy of his\r\nfather and grandfather. Less strikingly tall than they, he was nobly\r\nbuilt and finely proportioned. In full manhood, long hair, a thick\r\nmoustache and a flowing beard adorned his regular and handsome\r\ncountenance. His graciousness and affability were universally praised.\r\nHis face shone, we are told, like the face of a god, so that to see him\r\nor to dream of him was certain to conjure up joyous images.[1] He\r\ndelighted in the pomp of his office, wore magnificent garments, and\r\nplayed his kingly part with the same majesty and dignity as his\r\ngrandfather. Despite the troubles of his youth, he was well educated.\r\nRichard of Bury is said to have been his tutor, and the early lessons of\r\nthe author or instigator of the _Philobiblon_ were never entirely lost\r\nby the prince who took Chaucer and Froissart into his service. More\r\nconspicuous was his love of art, his taste for sumptuous buildings and\r\ntheir magnificent embellishment, which left memorials in the stately\r\ncastle of Windsor and its rich chapel of St. George, in St. Stephen's\r\nchapel at Westminster, and the Eastminster for Cistercian nuns hard by\r\nTower hill. A fluent and eloquent speaker in French and English, Edward\r\nwas also conversant with Latin, and perhaps Low-Dutch. Yet no king was\r\nless given to study or seclusion. Possessed, perhaps, of no exceptional\r\nmeasure of intellectual capacity, and not even endowed to any large\r\nextent with firmness of character, he won a great place in history by\r\nthe extraordinary activity of his temperament and the vigour and energy\r\nwith which he threw himself into whatever work he set his hand to do. He\r\nwas a consummate master of knightly exercises, delighting in\r\ntournaments, and especially in those which were marked by some touch of\r\nquaintness or fancy. He had the hereditary passion of his house for the\r\nchase. In his youthful campaigns in Scotland and in his maturer\r\nexpeditions in France, he was accompanied by a little army of falconers\r\nand huntsmen, by packs of hounds, and many hawks trained with the utmost\r\ncare. He honoured with his special friendship an Abbot of Leicester,\r\nfamed throughout England as the most dexterous of hare-coursers.[2]\r\n\r\n    [1] _Continuation of Murimuth_ (Engl. Hist. Soc.), pp. 225-27,\r\n    which gives the best contemporary description of Edward's\r\n    character.\r\n\r\n    [2] Knighton, ii., 127.\r\n\r\nEdward's abounding energy was even more gladly devoted to war than to\r\nthe chase. He was an admirable exponent of those chivalric ideals which\r\nare glorified in the courtly pages of Froissart. Not content with the\r\neasy victories which fall in the tiltyard to the crowned king, Edward\r\nwas anxious to show that his triumphs belonged to the knight and not to\r\nthe monarch, and more than once jousted victoriously in disguise. The\r\nsame spirit led him to challenge Philip of France to decide their\r\nquarrel by single combat, and to win a personal triumph when masking as\r\na knight attached to the service of Sir Walter Manny. He was liberal to\r\nthe verge of prodigality, good-tempered, easy of access, and, save when\r\nmoved by deep gusts of fierce anger, kindly and compassionate. His easy\r\ngood nature endeared him both to foreigners and to every class of his\r\nown subjects. Not only did he enter fully into the free-masonry which\r\nregarded the knights of all Christian nations as equal members of a\r\nsworn brotherhood of arms, but he extended his favours to the London\r\nvintner's son who earned his bread in his service, and entertained the\r\nwives of the leading London citizens, side by side with the noble\r\nladies in whose honour he gave the most quaint and magnificent of his\r\nbanquets. Pious after a somewhat formal fashion, he was unwearied in\r\ngoing on pilgrimage and lavish in his religious foundations. Though no\r\nprince was more careful to protect the state from the encroachments of\r\nchurchmen, his orthodoxy and devoutness kept him in good repute with\r\nthe austerest champions of the Church. He could choose fit agents to\r\ncarry out his policy, and his campaigns were a marvellous training\r\nground for gallant and capable warriors.\r\n\r\nEdward seldom lost sight of the material and economic interests of his\r\nsubjects. He was the friend of merchants, the father of English\r\ncommerce, the patron of the infant woollen manufactures, and a zealous\r\nchampion of the maritime greatness of his island realm, which boasted\r\nthat he was \"king of the sea\". Though his financial exigencies often\r\nled him to sell excessive privileges to alien traders, this policy did\r\nlittle harm to his subjects, for few of them were ready as yet to\r\nembark in foreign commerce. A true patriot, who declared that his land\r\nof England was \"nearer to his heart, more delightful, noble, and\r\nprofitable than all other lands,\" he succeeded in making Englishmen\r\nconscious of their national life as they had never been before; and he\r\nwon for his fatherland a foremost place among the kingdoms of the\r\nworld. His network of diplomatic alliances was dexterously fashioned,\r\nand enabled him to supplement the resources of his own subjects.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of Edward's ambitions hindered their complete\r\naccomplishment. Like Edward I., he undertook more than he could carry\r\nthrough, and, though his panegyrists praise his patience in adversity no\r\nless than his moderation in prosperity, his merely animal courage and\r\nvigour broke down under the weight of misfortune. Thus the glorious\r\nking, who in his youth vied with his grandfather, seemed in his old age\r\nto have nearly approached the fate of his wretched father. In early life\r\nhe won the love of his subjects. It was only in the first years of his\r\nreign that the violence and greed of his disorderly household, which\r\ninherited the evil traditions of the previous generation, bore so\r\nheavily upon the people that Englishmen fled at his approach in dread of\r\nthe purveyors, who confiscated every man's goods for the royal use.[1]\r\nThe somewhat shallow opportunism which abandoned, with little attempt at\r\nresistance, every royal right that stood in the way of his receiving the\r\nfull support of his parliament, at least had the merit of keeping Edward\r\nin general touch with his estates. The wanton breaches of good faith, by\r\nwhich he sometimes strove to win back what he had lightly conceded, were\r\nregarded as efforts to save the sovereign's dignity, rather than as\r\ninsidious attempts to restore the prerogative. Unjust as was the very\r\nbasis of his French pretensions, they were backed up by a show of legal\r\nclaim that satisfied the conscience of king and subject, and to\r\ncontemporaries Edward seemed a king regardful of his honour and mindful\r\nof his plighted word. If his generosity verged on extravagance, and his\r\naffectation of popular manners and graciousness on unreality, Englishmen\r\nof the fourteenth century were no severe critics of a crowned king. It\r\nwas only when in his later years Edward laid aside the soldier's life,\r\nand abandoned himself to the frivolous distractions and degrading\r\namours[2] which provoked the censure even of his admirers, that the\r\nself-indulgent traits inherited from his unhappy father stood revealed.\r\n\r\n    [1] The _Speculum regis Edwardi_ (ed. Moisant) was written\r\n    before 1333, and the attribution of its composition to\r\n    Archbishop Islip and the inferences drawn in Stubbs' _Const.\r\n    Hist._, ii., 394, are therefore unwarranted; see Professor\r\n    Tait's note in _Engl. Hist. Review_, xvi. (1901), 110-15.\r\n\r\n    [2] _Chron. Anglia_, 1328-1388, p. 401.\r\n\r\nEdward was before all things a soldier. He was not only the consummate\r\nknight, the mirror of chivalry, but a capable tactician with a\r\ngeneral's eye that took in the essential points of the situation at a\r\nglance. His restless energy ensured the rapidity of movement and\r\nalertness of action which won him many a triumph over less mobile and\r\nless highly trained antagonists; while they inspired his followers with\r\nfaith in their cause and with the courage which succeeds against\r\ndesperate odds. Yet the victor of Crecy cannot be numbered among the\r\nconsummate generals of history. His campaigns were ill-planned; and he\r\nlacked the self-restraint and sense of proportion which would have\r\nprevented him from aiming at objects beyond his reach. The same want of\r\nrelation between ends and means, the same want of definite policy and\r\nclear ideals, marred his statecraft. Yet contemporaries, conscious of\r\nhis faults, magnified Edward as the brilliant and successful king who\r\nhad won for himself an assured place among the greatest monarchs of\r\nhistory, \"Never,\" says Froissart, \"had there been such a king since the\r\ndays of Arthur King of Great Britain.\"[1] Even to his own age his\r\nsenile degradation pointed the moral of the triumphs of his manhood.\r\nThe modern historian, who sees, beneath the superficial splendour of\r\nthe days of Edward III., the misery and degradation that underlay the\r\nwreck of the dying Middle Ages, is in no danger of appraising too\r\nhighly the merits of this showy and ambitious monarch. Perhaps in our\r\nown days the reaction has gone too far, and we have been taught to\r\nundervalue the splendid energy and robustness of temperament which\r\ncommanded the admiration of all Europe, and personified the strenuous\r\nideals of the young English nation.\r\n\r\n    [1] Froissart (ed. Luce), viii., 231; _cf_. Canon of\r\n    Bridlington, p. 95.\r\n\r\nThe internal history of the first few years of Edward's reign was\r\nuneventful. John Stratford became chancellor after Mortimer's fall, and\r\nremained for ten years the guiding spirit of the administration.\r\nTranslated on Meopham's death in 1333 to Canterbury, he continued, as\r\nprimate, to take a leading part in politics. His chief helper was his\r\nbrother Robert, rewarded in 1337 by the see of Chichester. The brothers\r\nwere capable but not brilliant politicians. The worst disorders of the\r\ntimes of anarchy were put down, and parliaments readily granted\r\nsufficient money to meet the king's necessities. After a few years, the\r\nstrife of parties was so far hushed that Burghersh was suffered to\r\nreturn to office, and it looks as if the balance between the\r\nLancastrian party, upheld by the Stratfords, and the old middle party\r\nof Pembroke and Badlesmere, with which Burghersh had hereditary\r\nconnexions, was maintained, as it had been during the least unhappy\r\nperiod of the preceding reign. The country was growing rich and\r\nprosperous. The annalists tell us of little save tournaments and\r\nmummings, and the setting up of seven new earldoms to remedy the gaps\r\nwhich death and forfeiture had made in the higher circle of the\r\nbaronage. The earldom of Devon was revived for the house of Courtenay;\r\nthat of Salisbury in favour of the trusty William Montague, and an\r\nAudley, son of Despenser's rival, was raised to the earldom of\r\nGloucester. William Bohun, a younger son of the Humphrey slain at\r\nBoroughbridge, became Earl of Northampton, an Ufford, Earl of Suffolk,\r\na Clinton Earl of Huntingdon, a Hastings Earl of Pembroke, and Henry of\r\nGrosmont, the Earl of Lancaster's first born, Earl of Derby. A new rank\r\nwas added to the English peerage when the king's little son, Earl of\r\nChester in 1333, was made Duke of Cornwall in 1337. The old feuds\r\nseemed dead and with them the old disorder. But Edward was ambitious of\r\nmilitary glory, and it was natural that he should seek to reverse the\r\ndegrading part which he had been forced to play in relation to Scotland\r\nand France. His hands being tied by treaties, it was not easy for him\r\nto make the first move. Before long, however, circumstances arose which\r\ngave him a chance of taking up a line of his own with regard to\r\nScotland. From that time Scottish affairs mainly absorbed his attention\r\nuntil the outbreak of troubles with France.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of Robert Bruce on the Scottish throne had been\r\nattended by a considerable disturbance of the territorial balance in\r\nthe northern kingdom. Many Scottish magnates, deprived of their lands\r\nand driven into exile, had abodes in England, and all might well look\r\nfor the favour of the king in whose service they had been ruined. The\r\ntreaty of Northampton made no provision for their restoration, and\r\nEdward showed himself disposed to uphold it. Their estates were in the\r\nhands of their supplanters, the nobles who had gathered round the\r\nthrone of the Bruces. Thus it was that the exiles were cut off from all\r\nhope of return, and saw their only possibility of restitution in the\r\nbreak-up of the friendship of Edward and David. In like case were the\r\nEnglish magnates who still entertained hopes of making effective the\r\ngrants of Scottish estates which they had received from Edward I. and\r\nEdward II. For both classes alike every fresh year of peace between the\r\nrealms decreased their chances of obtaining their desires. They failed\r\nto persuade Edward to go to war with his brother-in-law and repudiate\r\nformally the obligations imposed upon him by his mother and her\r\nparamour. But the minority of King David had unloosed the spirits of\r\ndisorder in Scotland. Though the vigorous and capable regent, Sir\r\nThomas Randolph, Earl of Moray, showed himself competent to stem the\r\ntide of aristocratic reaction which swelled round the throne of his\r\ninfant cousin, he was one of the old generation of heroes that had\r\naided King Robert to gain his throne. Were he to die, or become\r\nincapable of acting, there was no one who could supply his place. The\r\nDisinherited--thus they styled themselves--were encouraged both by the\r\napathy of Edward III. and the weakness of Scotland to make a bold\r\nstroke on their own behalf.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the disinherited was Edward Balliol, the son of the\r\ndeposed King John. Brought up in England, first under the care of his\r\ncousin, Earl Warenne, and afterwards in the household of the\r\nhalf-brothers of Edward II., Edward Balliol, who succeeded in 1315 to\r\nthe French estates on which his father spent his latter years, divided\r\nhis time between England and France. The forfeiture of his father still\r\nkept him out of Barnard Castle and the other Balliol lands in England.\r\nYoung and warlike, poor and ambitious, with few lands and great\r\npretensions, he never formally abandoned either the lordship of\r\nGalloway or the throne of Scotland. In 1330 he received permission to\r\ntake up his quarters in England during pleasure. He soon associated\r\nhimself with his fellow-exiles in a bold attempt to win back their\r\npatrimony. Chief among his followers were three titular Scottish earls,\r\nclosely related by intermarriage, each of whom was also a baron of high\r\nrank in England. Of these the French-born Henry of Beaumont, kinsman of\r\nEleanor of Castile, and brother of Bishop Louis of Durham, was the\r\noldest and most experienced. As the husband of a sister of the last of\r\nthe Comyn Earls of Buchan, he posed as the heir of the greatest of the\r\nScottish houses which had paid the penalty of its opposition to King\r\nRobert, and was summoned to the English parliament as Earl of Buchan.\r\nBeaumont's great-nephew, the young Gilbert of Umfraville, lord of\r\nRedesdale, was a grandson of another Comyn heiress, and his ancestors\r\nhad inherited in the middle of the thirteenth century the ancient\r\nScottish earldom of Angus, though they also had incurred forfeiture for\r\ntheir adhesion to the English policy. David of Strathbolgie, Earl of\r\nAthol, had a better right to be called a Scot than Umfraville or\r\nBeaumont. But his father abandoned Bruce, and was driven into England,\r\nwhere he held the Kentish barony of Chilham, and sat in the English\r\nparliament under his Scottish title. The younger Athol was son-in-law\r\nto the titular Earl of Moray, and all three kinsmen were bound by\r\ncommon interests to embrace the policy of Edward Balliol. Many lesser\r\nmen associated themselves with the three earls and the claimant to a\r\nthrone. Nearly every nobleman of the Scottish border made himself a\r\nparty to a scheme of adventure which had its best parallels in the\r\nNorman invasions of Wales and Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe object of the disinherited was to raise an army and prosecute their\r\nScottish claims by force. Edward III. gave them no open countenance,\r\nand took up an ostentatiously correct attitude. He solemnly forbade all\r\nbreach of the peace, and prevented the adventurers from adopting the\r\neasy course of marching from England to an open attack on Scotland. No\r\nobstacles, however, were imposed to hinder their raising a small but\r\nefficient army of 500 men-at-arms and 1,000 archers. Mercenaries, both\r\nEnglish and foreign, were hired to supplement their scanty numbers, and\r\namong those who took service with them was a young gentleman of\r\nHainault, Walter Manny, whose father had a few years before perished in\r\nthe service of Edward II. in Gascony, and who had first come to England\r\nin the service of his countrywoman, Queen Philippa. Ships were\r\ncollected in the Humber, and on the last day of July, 1332, the\r\ndisinherited and their followers sailed from Ravenspur on a destination\r\nwhich was officially supposed to be unknown. A week later, on August 6,\r\nthey landed at Kinghorn in Fife.\r\n\r\nScotland was singularly unready to meet invasion. The regent Moray had\r\ndied a few weeks earlier, and his successor, Donald, Earl of Mar,\r\nincompetent to carry on his vigorous policy, had perhaps already been\r\nintriguing with the adventurers. The only resistance to Balliol's\r\nlanding, made by the Earl of Fife, was altogether unsuccessful. The\r\nlittle army established itself easily in the enemies' territory, and,\r\nafter two days' rest at Dunfermline, advanced over the Ochils towards\r\nPerth. The regent had by that time gathered together an imposing army.\r\nAs the invaders approached Strathearn on their way northwards, they\r\nfound Mar encamped on Dupplin Moor, on the left bank of the Earn, and\r\nholding in force the only bridge available for crossing the river.\r\nThere was some parleying between the two hosts. \"We are sons of\r\nmagnates of this land,\" declared the disinherited to Mar. \"We are come\r\nhither with the lord Edward of Balliol, the right heir of the realm, to\r\ndemand the lands which belong to us by hereditary right.\" Mar returned\r\na warlike answer to their words, and both armies made preparation for\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nThe disinherited, though few in number, were well trained in warfare,\r\nand from the beginning showed capacity to out-general the unwieldy host\r\nand feeble leader opposed to them. At sunset, some of their forces\r\ncrossed the Earn by a ford which the Scots had neglected to guard, and\r\nfalling upon an outlying portion of the enemies' camp, where the\r\ninfantry were quartered, slaughtered the surprised Scots at their\r\nleisure. Luckily for Mar, the whole of his knights and men-at-arms were\r\nfar away, uselessly watching the bridge, over which they had expected\r\nthe disinherited to force a passage. Thus saved from the night\r\nambuscade, the kernel of the Scottish army prepared next morning,\r\nAugust 12, to attack the disinherited. Puffed up by the memory of\r\nBannockburn and the consciousness of superior numbers, they marched to\r\nbattle as if certain of victory. All fought on foot, and the\r\nmen-at-arms were drawn up in a dense central mass, supported at each\r\nside by wings. The disinherited were sufficiently schooled in northern\r\nwarfare to adopt the same tactics. Save for a few score of horsemen in\r\nreserve, their heavily armed troops, leaving their horses in the rear,\r\nformed a compact column after the Scottish fashion. But archers were\r\ndistributed in open order on the right and left flanks, with both\r\nextremities pushed forward, so that they formed the horns of a\r\nhalf-moon. Then the Scots advanced to the charge, and both sides joined\r\nin battle. The irresistible weight of the Scottish main phalanx forced\r\nback the little column of the disinherited, and for a moment it looked\r\nas if the battle were won. Meanwhile the archers on the flanks poured a\r\ngalling shower on the collateral Scottish columns. The unvisored\r\nhelmets of the Scots made them an easy prey to the storm of missiles,\r\nand they were driven back on to the main body. By this time the\r\ndisinherited had rallied from the first shock; and still the deadly\r\nhail of arrows descended from right and left, until the whole of the\r\nScottish army was thrown into panic-stricken disorder. Escape was\r\nimpossible for the foremost ranks by reason of the closeness of their\r\nformation. At last, the rear files sought safely in flight, and were\r\nclosely pursued by the victors, mounted on their fresh horses. A huge\r\nmass of slain, piled up upon each other, marked the place of combat. As\r\nat Bannockburn, the small disciplined host prevailed, but discipline\r\nwas now with the English and numbers only with the Scots.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] The significance of the battle of Dupplin was first pointed\r\n    out by Mr. J.E. Morris in _Engl. Hist. Review_, xii. (1897),\r\n    430-31.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Dupplin Moor was for the moment decisive. Balliol\r\noccupied Perth, and received the submission of many of the Scottish\r\nmagnates, among them being that Earl of Fife who first opposed his\r\nlanding. A few weeks later, on September 24, Balliol was crowned King\r\nof Scots at Scone by the Bishop of Dunkeld. It was a soldier's\r\ncoronation, and the magnates sat at the coronation feast in full\r\narmour, save their helmets. The disinherited then received the lands\r\nfor which they had striven; and thereupon quitted the new king, either\r\nto secure their estates or to revisit their property in England. But\r\nthe Scots, of no mind to receive a king from the foreigner, chose a new\r\nregent in Sir Andrew Moray, son of the companion of Wallace; and\r\nprepared to maintain King David. On December 16, Balliol was surprised\r\nat Annan by a hostile force under the young Earl of Moray, son of the\r\nlate regent, and by Sir Archibald Douglas. His followers were cut off,\r\nhis brother was slain, and he himself had the utmost difficulty in\r\neffecting his escape to England. He had only reigned four months.\r\n\r\nDuring Balliol's brief triumph, Edward III. had declared himself in his\r\nfavour. Debarred by the treaty of Northampton from questioning the\r\nindependence of King David, he was able to make what terms he liked\r\nwith David's supplanter. In November a treaty was drawn up at Roxburgh,\r\nby which Balliol recognised the overlordship of Edward, and promised\r\nhim the town, castle, and shire of Berwick. In return for these\r\nconcessions, Edward III. acknowledged his namesake as lawful King of\r\nScots. When, a few weeks later, his new vassal appeared as a fugitive\r\non English soil, Edward had no longer any scruples in openly supporting\r\nhim in an attempt to win back his throne. In the spring of 1333,\r\nBalliol and the disinherited once more crossed the frontier in\r\nsufficient force to undertake the siege of Berwick. The border\r\nstronghold held out manfully, but the Scots failed in an attempt to\r\ndivert the attention of the English by an invasion of Cumberland. After\r\nEaster, Edward III. went in person to Berwick, and devoted the whole\r\nresources of England to ensuring its reduction. The siege lasted on\r\nuntil July, when the garrison, at the last gasp, offered to surrender,\r\nunless the town were relieved within fifteen days. The Scots made a\r\ngreat effort to save Berwick from capture, and the English king was\r\nforced to fight a pitched battle, before he could secure its\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nOn July 19 Edward, leaving a sufficient portion of his army to maintain\r\nthe blockade of Berwick, took up a position with the remainder on\r\nHalidon Hill, a short distance to the west of the town. The lessons of\r\nBannockburn, Boroughbridge, and Dupplin were not forgotten, and the\r\nEnglish host was arranged much after the fashion which had procured the\r\nfirst victory of the disinherited. Knights and men-at-arms sent their\r\nhorses to the rear and, from the king downwards, all, save a small\r\nreserve of horse, prepared to fight on foot. Edward divided his forces\r\ninto three lines or \"battles,\" each of which consisted of a central\r\ncolumn of dismounted heavily armed troops, flanked by a right and a\r\nleft wing of archers in open order, John of Eltham and the titular Earl\r\nof Buchan commanded the right battle, the king the centre, and Edward\r\nBalliol the left. The Scots still employed the traditional tactics\r\nwhich had failed so signally at Dupplin. Sir Archibald Douglas led his\r\nfollowers up the slopes of the hill in three dense columns. But a\r\npitiless rain of arrows spread havoc among their ranks, and there were\r\nno answering volleys to disturb their foes. The battle was won for the\r\nEnglish almost before the two lines had joined in close combat. It was\r\nonly on Edward's right that the Scots were strong enough to push home\r\ntheir attack. On the centre and left, the English easily drove the\r\nenemy in panic flight down the slopes which they had ascended so\r\nconfidently. The pursuit was long and bloody; few were taken prisoners,\r\nbut many were slain or driven into the sea. Seven Scottish earls were\r\nbelieved by the English to have fallen, while the victors lost one\r\nknight, one squire, and a few infantry soldiers. Thus, for a second\r\ntime the tactics, which had served the Scots so well in the defensive\r\nfight of Bannockburn, failed in offence to secure victory for them. The\r\nexperience of this day completed the evolution of the new English\r\nbattle array of men-at-arms fighting on foot and supported by wings of\r\narchers, which was soon to excite the wonder of Europe, when its\r\npossibilities were demonstrated on continental fields.\r\n\r\nNext day Berwick opened its gates, and was handed over to the English,\r\naccording to the treaty of Roxburgh, to be for the rest of its history\r\nan English frontier town. Edward Balliol again conquered Scotland as\r\neasily as he had done on the former occasion, and far more effectually.\r\nIt was no longer possible for the few remaining champions of the house\r\nof Bruce to safeguard the person of the little king and queen. David\r\nand Joan were accordingly sent off to France, where they were to grow\r\nup as good friends of King Philip. But Balliol had so clearly regained\r\nhis throne through English help that he was no longer an independent\r\nagent. No sooner was his conquest assured than he was forced not only\r\nto confirm the surrender of Berwick, but to yield up the whole of\r\nsouth-eastern Scotland as the price of the English assistance. The\r\ndepth of his humiliation was sounded when, in the treaty of Newcastle,\r\nJune 12, 1334, Edward, King of Scots, granted Edward, King of England,\r\nlands worth two thousand pounds a year in the marches of Scotland, and\r\nin part payment thereof yielded up to him, besides Berwick and its\r\nshire, the castle, town, and county of Roxburgh, the forests of\r\nJedburgh Selkirk, and Ettrick, the town and county of Selkirk, and the\r\ntowns, castles, and counties of Peebles, Dumfries, and Edinburgh. Of\r\nthese Dumfries then included the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, while the\r\nshire of Edinburgh took in the constabularies, the modern shires, of\r\nHaddington and Linlithgow. Thus the whole of Lothian, the whole of the\r\ncentral upland region, and Balliol's own inheritance of Galloway east\r\nof the Cree were directly transferred to the English crown, and were\r\ndivided into sheriffdoms, and officered after the English fashion. On\r\nJune 18 Balliol personally performed homage for so much of Scotland as\r\nEdward chose to leave him. The wrongs of the disinherited had been the\r\nmeans of re-opening the whole Scottish question, and Edward III. seemed\r\nassured of a position as supreme as that which had once been held by\r\nEdward I.\r\n\r\nIt was always easier in the Middle Ages to conquer a country than to\r\nkeep it. And the experience of forty years might well have convinced\r\nEnglishmen that no land was more difficult to hold than the stubborn\r\nand impenetrable northern kingdom, with its strenuous population, ever\r\nwilling to cry a truce between local feuds when there was an\r\nopportunity of uniting against the southerners. Edward overshot his\r\nmark in grasping too eagerly the fairest portions of Balliol's realm.\r\nHe needed for his policy a Scottish king, strong enough to maintain\r\nhimself against his subjects, and loyal enough to remain true to the\r\nEnglish connexion. Any faint chance of Balliol occupying such a\r\nposition was completely destroyed by his studied humiliation.\r\nHenceforward the King of Scots, who had fought so well at Dupplin and\r\nHalidon, was but a pawn in Edward's game. Hated by the Scots as the\r\nbetrayer of his country, distrusted by the English who henceforth spied\r\nhis actions and commanded his armies in his name, the gallant victor of\r\nDupplin lost faith in himself and in his cause. After all, he was his\r\nfather's son, and in no wise capable of bearing adversity and indignity\r\nwith equanimity. His helplessness soon proved the worst obstacle in the\r\nway of the success of Edward's plans. Even with the aid of a large\r\nScottish party, Edward I. had failed to bring about the subjection of\r\nScotland. It was clearly impossible for his grandson to succeed in the\r\nsame task when all Scotland was united against him, and braced to\r\naction by a series of glorious memories.\r\n\r\nDifficulties arose almost from the first. Not only had Balliol to\r\ncontend against the implacable hostility of the Scottish patriots; the\r\ndisinherited split up into rival factions after their triumph, and\r\ntheir divisions played the game of the partisans of the Bruces. The\r\nEarls of Athol and Buchan quarrelled with Balliol. Buchan, besieged by\r\nthe partisans of David Bruce in a remote castle, was forced to\r\nsurrender and quit Scotland for good. Athol was distinguished by the\r\nviolence and suddenness of his tergiversations. After deserting Balliol\r\nfor the patriots, he once more declared for the two Edwards, and\r\npersuaded many of the Scottish magnates to submit themselves to them.\r\nSo long as the English king remained in Scotland, Athol was safe. On\r\nEdward's retirement to his kingdom in November, 1335, the nationalist\r\nleaders took the earl prisoner and put him to death. The war dragged on\r\nfrom year to year, with startling vicissitudes of fortune, but at no\r\ntime was Balliol really established on the Scottish throne, and at no\r\ntime did Edward III. really govern all the ceded districts.\r\n\r\nScottish business detained the English king and court mainly in the\r\nnorth. Edward was in Scotland for most of the winter of 1334-5, keeping\r\nhis Christmas court at Roxburgh. In the summer of 1335 he led an army\r\ninto Scotland and penetrated as far as Perth. Again in 1336, he marched\r\nfrom Perth along the east coast, as far as Elgin and Inverness. The\r\nScots refused to give him battle, and their tactics of evasion and\r\nguerilla warfare soon exhausted his resources and demoralised his\r\narmies. This was Edward's last personal intervention in the business.\r\nHe had long been irritated by the persistent interference of the French\r\nking in Scottish affairs, and his anger was not lessened by his hard\r\nplight forcing him, on more than one occasion, to grant short truces to\r\nthe Scottish insurgents at Philip's intervention. His relations with\r\nFrance were becoming so strained that he preferred to spend 1337 in the\r\nsouth and entrust Thomas Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, with the conduct\r\nof the fruitless campaign of that year. Early in 1338, Edward made his\r\nway once more to Berwick, but his intention of invading Scotland was\r\nsuddenly abandoned on the news of a threatened French expedition to\r\nEngland recalling him to the south. This was the decisive moment of the\r\nlong struggle. Henceforth the English king could only devote a small\r\nshare of his resources to an undertaking which he had not been able to\r\ncompass when his whole energies were absorbed in it. The patriots, who\r\nhad always dominated the open country, now attacked the castles and\r\nfortified towns, which were the bulwarks of the Edwardian power. Within\r\nthree years all the more important of these fell into their hands. In\r\n1339 Edward Balliol's capital of Perth was beset by Robert, the Steward\r\nof Scotland, who had recently undertaken the regency for his uncle\r\nDavid. On the approach of danger, Balliol was ordered to England, and\r\nSir Thomas Ughtred, an English knight and one of the disinherited of\r\n1332, was entrusted with the command. By August he had been forced to\r\nsurrender, and Stirling soon afterwards opened its gates to the gallant\r\nand energetic steward. In 1341 Edinburgh castle was captured by a\r\nclever stratagem, and a few weeks later David and Joan returned from\r\nFrance. The king, then seventeen years old, henceforth undertook the\r\npersonal administration of his kingdom. Once more there was a King of\r\nScots whom the Scottish people themselves desired. The first military\r\nenterprise of Edward's reign ended in complete failure.\r\n\r\nDuring the years of Edward Balliol's attempt on Scotland, it was the\r\nobvious interest of the English king to maintain such relations with\r\nFrance as to prevent the tightening of the traditional bond between the\r\nFrench and the Scottish courts. There were plenty of outstanding points\r\nof difference between England and France, but neither country was\r\nanxious for war, and the result of this mutual forbearance enabled\r\nEdward III. to deal with the Scots at his leisure. A survey of the\r\nrelations of the two realms during the first ten years of Edward III.'s\r\nreign will show how, despite the reluctance of either party to force\r\nmatters to a crisis, the Kings of France and England gradually drifted\r\ninto the hostility which, from 1337 onwards, paralysed the progress of\r\nthe English cause in Scotland.\r\n\r\nAt the moment of the fall of Edward II., England and France were still\r\nnominally engaged in the war which had followed the second seizure of\r\nGuienne by Charles IV. The difficulties experienced by Isabella and\r\nMortimer in establishing their power made them as willing to give way\r\nto the French as to the Scots. Accordingly, on March 31, 1327, a treaty\r\nof peace was signed at Paris. By this treaty Edward only gained the\r\nrestoration of certain of his Gascon vassals to the estates of which\r\nthey had been deprived through their loyalty to the English connexion.\r\nHe pledged himself to pay a large war indemnity, and accepted a partial\r\nrestitution of his Gascon lands. Like so many of the treaties since\r\n1259, it was a truce rather than a peace. Many details still remained\r\nfor settlement, and it was pretty clear that the French, having the\r\nwhip hand, would drive Gascony towards the goal of gradual absorption\r\nwhich had been so clearly marked out by Philip the Fair.\r\n\r\nCharles IV. restored to Edward such parts of Gascony as he chose to\r\nsurrender. He retained in his hands Agen and the Agenais, and Bazas and\r\nthe Bazadais, on the ground that Charles of Valois had won them by\r\nright of conquest in 1324. This policy reduced Edward's duchy to two\r\nportions of territory, very unequal in size and separated from each\r\nother by the lands conquered by the French king's uncle. The larger\r\nsection of the English king's lands extended along the coast from the\r\nmouth of the Charente to the mouth of the Bidassoa. It included Saintes\r\nwith Saintonge south of the Charente, Bordeaux and the Bordelais, Dax\r\nand the diocese of Dax, and Bayonne and its territory. But in no place\r\ndid the boundaries go very far inland. Along the Dordogne, Libourne and\r\nSaint-Émilion were the easternmost English towns. Up the Garonne, the\r\nFrench were in possession of Langon, while, in the valley of the Adour,\r\nSaint-Sever, perched on its upland rock, was the landward outpost of\r\nthe diminished Gascon duchy. In the east of the Agenais the two\r\n_châtellenies_ of Penne and Puymirol formed a little _enclave_ of ducal\r\nterritory which extended from the Lot to the Garonne. But this second\r\nfragment of the ancient duchy was of no military and little commercial\r\nvalue, being commanded on all sides by the possessions of the French\r\nking. Moreover, the fiefs dependent on the Gascon duchy had fallen away\r\nwith the attenuation of the duke's domain. In particular the viscounty\r\nof Béarn, now held by the Count of Foix, repudiated all allegiance to\r\nits English overlord. Even a thoroughly Gascon seigneur, such as the\r\nlord of Albret, was wavering in his fidelity to his duke. It was no\r\nlonger safe for Gascons to risk the hostility of the king of the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nWithin a year of the treaty of Paris, the death of Charles IV. further\r\ncomplicated Anglo-French relations. Like his brothers, Louis X. and\r\nPhilip V., Charles the Fair left no male issue; but the pregnancy of\r\nhis queen prevented the settlement of the succession being completed\r\nimmediately after his decease. The barons of France, however, had no\r\nserious doubts as to their policy. The inadmissibility of a female\r\nruler had already been determined at the accession of both Philip V.\r\nand Charles IV., and it was clear that the nearest male heir was\r\nPhilip, Count of Valois, who had recently succeeded to the great\r\nappanage left vacant by the death in 1325 of his father, Charles of\r\nValois, the inveterate enemy of the English. As the next representative\r\nof the male line, the French at once recognised Philip of Valois as\r\nregent. When his cousin's widow gave birth to a daughter, the regent\r\nwas proclaimed as King Philip VI. without either delay or hesitation.\r\nThus the house of Valois occupied the throne of France in the place of\r\nthe direct Capetian line in which son had succeeded father since the\r\ndays of Hugh Capet.\r\n\r\nEven Isabella and Mortimer protested against the succession of Philip\r\nof Valois. Admitted that the exclusion of women from the monarchy was\r\nalready established by two precedents, could it not be plausibly argued\r\nthat a woman, incapable herself of reigning, might form \"the bridge and\r\nplank\"[1] (as a contemporary put it) by which her sons might step into\r\nthe rights of their ancestors? Strange as such a conception seems to\r\nour ideas, it was not unfamiliar to the jurists of that day. It was in\r\nthis fashion that the Capetian house claimed its boasted descent and\r\ncontinuity from the race of Charlemagne. Such a principle was actually\r\nthe law in some parts of France, and it was a matter of every-day\r\noccurrence in the Parisis to transmit male fiefs to the sons of\r\nheiresses, themselves incapable of succession. Edward, as the son of\r\nCharles IV.'s sister, was nearer of kin to his uncle than Philip, the\r\nson of Charles's uncle. Surely a man's nephew had a better right to his\r\nsuccession than his first cousin could ever claim? From the purely\r\njuridical point of view, the claim put forward by Isabella on her son's\r\nbehalf was not only plausible but strong.\r\n\r\n    [1] Viollet, _Hist. des Institutions politiques et\r\n    administratives de la France_, ii., 74, from a MS. source. See\r\n    also Viollet, _Comment les Femmes ont été exclues en France de\r\n    la Succession à la Couronne_, in _Mém. de l'Acad. des\r\n    Inscriptions_, xxxiv., pt. ii. (1893).\r\n\r\nHappily for France, the magnates of the realm dealt with the succession\r\nquestion as statesmen and not as lawyers. A later age imagined that the\r\nFrench barons brought forward a text of the law of the Salian Pranks, as\r\na complete answer to Edward's claim from the juridical point of view.\r\nBut the famous Salic law was a figment, forged by the next generation of\r\nlawyers who were eager to give a complete refutation of the elaborate\r\nlegal pleadings of the partisans of the English claim. No authentic\r\nSalic law dealt with the question of the succession to the throne,[1]\r\nand the bold step of transferring a doctrine of private inheritance to\r\nthe domain of public law was one of the characteristic feats of the\r\nmedieval jurist, anxious to heap up at any risk a mass of arguments that\r\nmight overwhelm his antagonists' case. The barons of 1328 rose superior\r\nto legal subtleties. To them the question at issue was the preservation\r\nof the national identity of their country. The vital thing for them was\r\nto secure the throne of France, both at the moment and at future times,\r\nfor a Frenchman. Any admission, however guarded, of the right of women\r\nto transmit claims to their sons opened out a vista of the foreign\r\noffspring of French princesses, married abroad, ruling France as\r\nstrangers, and it might be as enemies. They chose Philip of Valois\r\nbecause he was a Frenchman born and bred, and because he had no\r\ninterests or possessions outside the French realm. They could not endure\r\nthe idea of being ruled by the English king. He was not only a stranger,\r\nbut the hereditary enemy. The Capetian monarchy must at all costs be\r\nkept French.\r\n\r\n    [1] Viollet, _op. cit._, pp. 55-57; _cf_. Désprez, _Les\r\n    Préliminaires de la Giurre de Cent Am_, p. 32.\r\n\r\nIsabella did what she could on her son's behalf. She excited the\r\n_noblesse_ of Aquitaine to support Edward's claim; but the lords of the\r\nsouth paid no heed to her exhortations. She was more successful with the\r\nFlemings, then in revolt against their Count, Louis of Nevers. Twelve\r\nnotables of Bruges, headed by the burgomaster, William de Deken, visited\r\nEngland and offered to recognise Edward as King of France if he would\r\nsupport the Flemish democracy against their feudal lord.[1] But Philip\r\nVI.'s first act was to unite with the Count of Flanders, and the fatal\r\nday of Cassel laid low the fortunes of Bruges and restored the fugitive\r\nLouis to power. Isabella was forced to resign herself to simple\r\nprotests.\r\n\r\n    [1] See Pirenne, _La première Tentative pour reconnaitre\r\n    Édouard I. comme Roi de France in Ann. de la Soc. d'Hist. de\r\n    Gand_, 1902.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable demand from Philip VI. for Edward's homage for Guienne\r\nand Ponthieu soon brought the English government face to face with\r\nrealities. The request for his vassal's submission, conveyed to England\r\nby Peter Roger, Abbot of Fecamp, the future Clement VI., was even more\r\nunwelcome than such demands commonly were. At first Isabella used brave\r\nwords: \"My son, who is the son of a king, will never do homage to the\r\nson of a count\".[1] But a threat of a third seizure of Gascony soon\r\nbrought the queen to her senses. Further insistence on the part of\r\nPhilip was met with polite apologies for delay. At last, in May, 1329,\r\nthe young king crossed the Channel, and on June 6 performed homage to\r\nPhilip in the choir of the cathedral of Amiens. But even at the last\r\nmoment there were explanations and reservations on both sides. Philip\r\nmade it clear that he acknowledged no claim of his vassal to any\r\nterritories, beyond those which he actually possessed. Edward's\r\nadvisers protested that they abandoned no pretension to the whole by\r\nperforming homage for a part. Moreover, the act of homage was couched\r\nin such ambiguous phrases that it remained doubtful whether Edward had\r\nperformed \"liege homage,\" as the King of France demanded, or only\r\n\"simple homage,\" such as seemed to him less offensive to the dignity of\r\na crowned king. Thus, though the cousins parted amicably and discussed\r\nproposals of a marriage treaty between the English and French houses,\r\nthe homage at Amiens settled nothing.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Grandes Chroniques de France_, v., 323 (ed. P. Paris).\r\n\r\nThe diplomatists still had plenty of work before them. The French\r\nstatesmen insisted on the necessity of the ceremony at Amiens being\r\ninterpreted as liege homage, involving the obligation of defending the\r\noverlord \"against all those who can live or die\". The English\r\npoliticians complained of the \"injustice and unreason of the King of\r\nFrance, who seeks the disinheritance of their master in Aquitaine\". It\r\nwas only by limiting the demands of both parties to points of detail,\r\nthat a compromise was arrived at in the convention of the Wood of\r\nVincennes on May 8, 1330. Further negotiations were still necessary;\r\nand at the moment when everything was trembling in the balance, the\r\nsudden occupation of Saintes by the Count of Alencon, brother of Philip\r\nVI., brought matters within a measurable distance of war. But Edward,\r\nthen at the beginning of his real reign, had no mind for fighting. A\r\nmore satisfactory convention, drawn up on March 9, 1331, at\r\nSaint-Germain-en-Laye, was ratified by Edward at Eltham on March 30,\r\nwhen he recognised that he owed liege homage, and not merely simple\r\nhomage, to the King of France. Next month, he crossed over to France so\r\nsecretly that his subjects believed that he went disguised as a\r\nmerchant or a pilgrim. At Pont-Sainte-Maxence, a little town on the\r\nOise, a few miles below Compiègne, Edward held an interview with Philip\r\nVI., who came thither with equal privacy. The French king does not seem\r\nto have insisted upon a renewal of homage, being content with the\r\nassurance already given as to the character of the previous ceremony.\r\nThe informal interview, which the modern historian can only ascertain\r\nby painful scrutiny of the royal itineraries, proved more fertile in\r\nfriendship than all the pomp of Amiens. Before Edward went home, Philip\r\ngave him complete satisfaction for the outrage at Saintes, and arrived\r\nat a financial settlement. Thus Edward and Philip at last became\r\nfriends \"so far as outside appearances went,\" as a chronicler of the\r\ntime phrased it. The fundamental difference of interests and standpoint\r\ncould be glossed over by no facile compromise, and the calm of the next\r\nsix years was only the prelude to a storm destined to end the policy\r\nthat had regulated the relations of the two courts from the days of the\r\npeace of 1259 to those of the meeting at Pont-Sainte-Maxence.\r\n\r\nAt first there was talk of further cementing the newly established\r\nfriendship. There were suggestions of a marriage of Edward's infant son\r\nwith Philip's daughter, a fresh interview between the monarchs, a\r\ntreaty of perpetual alliance and a common crusade against the Turks.\r\nThe last, and the most fantastic, of these projects was the one which\r\nwas most seriously discussed. The chivalrous spirit of Philip of Valois\r\nrose eagerly to the idea of a great European expedition against the\r\ninfidel, of which he was to be the chief commander. Inspired by John\r\nXXII., he took the cross, made preparations for an early start, and\r\ninvoked Edward's co-operation. Edward cleverly utilised his kinsman's\r\nzeal as another lever for enforcing the settlement of outstanding\r\ndifferences. \"Tell your master,\" he said to the French ambassador,\r\nPeter Roger, now Archbishop of Rouen, \"that when he has fulfilled his\r\npromises, I will be more eager to go on the holy voyage than he is\r\nhimself.\" But the chronic troubles, arising from the unceasing\r\nextension of the suzerain's claims in Aquitaine, and from the shelter\r\ngiven by Philip to David Bruce, had continued all through the years of\r\nprofessed friendship, and in 1334 an embassy to Paris, presided over by\r\nArchbishop Stratford, failed to establish a _modus vivendi_. In the\r\nsame year John XXII. died without having either procured the crusade or\r\ncrushed Louis of Bavaria. His successor, James Founder of Foix, who\r\ntook the name of Benedict XII., pursued his general policy, though in a\r\nmore diplomatic and self-seeking spirit. Benedict's great wish was to,\r\nunite France and England against his enemy, the Emperor Louis of\r\nBavaria, and he dexterously played upon Philip's eagerness for the\r\ncrusade to persuade him to abandon to the papacy the position, which he\r\nhad assumed, of arbiter of the differences between Edward and the\r\nScots. It was a signal, though transitory, triumph of this policy that\r\na truce between England and Scotland was brought about by the mediation\r\nof the pope and not of the French king. But Benedict found that a\r\ncrusade was impossible so long as the chief powers of the west were\r\nhopelessly estranged from each other. In 1336, he vetoed the crusading\r\nscheme until happier times had dawned. Philip, bitterly disappointed,\r\nsought out Benedict at Avignon, but utterly failed to change his\r\npurpose. He was in his own despite released from the crusader's vow,\r\nthough exhorted still to continue his preparations. The galleys,\r\npurchased from the crusading tenths of the Church, were transferred\r\nfrom the Mediterranean to the Channel. The French king might well find\r\nconsolation for the abandonment of the holy war in a sudden descent on\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the horizon darkened. Philip VI., once more took up\r\nthe cause of the Scots, and once more the Aquitanian troubles became\r\nacute. His irritation at Benedict led him to open up negotiations with\r\nLouis of Bavaria, whereat Benedict was greatly offended. Edward III.\r\nthen sought to find friends who would help him against Philip. He was\r\nas much disgusted with the pope as was his French rival. The crusading\r\nfleet, equipped with the money of the Roman Church, threatened the\r\nEnglish coast, and the _curia_ was even more French in its sympathies\r\nthan the temporising pontiff. It is no wonder then that both kings\r\nlooked coldly on Benedict's offer of mediation between them. Yet,\r\nnotwithstanding the indifference manifested by both courts, two\r\ncardinals, Peter Gomez, a Spaniard, and Bertrand of Montfavence, a\r\nFrenchman, were sent in the summer of 1337 as papal legates to France\r\nand England to settle the points in dispute. For the next three years\r\nthese prelates pursued their mission with energy and persistence,\r\nthough with little result.\r\n\r\nA fresh dispute further embittered the personal relations of Philip and\r\nEdward. In 1336, Edward offered a refuge in England to Robert of Artois,\r\nPhilip's brother-in-law and mortal enemy. The grandson of the Count\r\nRobert of Artois who was slain in 1302 at Courtrai, Robert of Artois was\r\nindignant that the rich county of Artois should, according to local\r\ncustom, have devolved upon his aunt Maud, the wife of Otto, Count of\r\nBurgundy, or Franche Comté, and the mother-in-law of the last two kings\r\nof the direct Capetian line. Though he had failed in several suits to\r\nobtain it, Robert renewed his claim after his brother-in-law became King\r\nof France. It was soon proved that the charters upon which he relied to\r\nprove his title had been forged. The sudden death of the Countess of\r\nArtois, followed quickly by that of her daughter and heiress, added the\r\nsuspicion of poisoning to the certainly of forgery. Robert was deprived\r\nof all his possessions and was exiled from France. Driven from his first\r\nrefuge in Brabant by Philip's indignant hostility, he found shelter in\r\nEngland, where he was received with a favour which Philip bitterly\r\nresented. Condemned in his absence as a traitor, and devoured by a\r\nferocious hatred of Philip and his Burgundian wife, Robert did all that\r\nhe could to inflame the mind of Edward against the French king. French\r\nromance of the next generation, in the poem of the _Vow of the\r\nHeron_,[1] tells how Robert, returning to Edward's court from the chase,\r\nbrought as his only victim a heron, which he offered to the king as the\r\nmost timid of birds to the most cowardly of kings; \"for, sire,\" he\r\ndeclared, \"you have not dared to claim the realm of France which belongs\r\nto you by hereditary right\". Stirred up by this challenge, Edward swore\r\nto God and the heron that within a year he would place the crown of\r\nFrance on Queen Philippa's brow. This famous legend is, however, a\r\nfiction. It was not until later that Edward seriously renewed the claim\r\nwhich he had advanced in 1328. But when once war became certain, the\r\nchallenge of the French throne was bound to be made, and the dissolution\r\nof the friendly personal relations of the two kings, which had so long\r\nprevented either from proceeding to extremities, was certainly in large\r\npart the work of Robert of Artois. For the moment, Edward probably\r\nthought that his welcome of Robert was only a fair return for Philip's\r\nreception of David Bruce.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Les voeus du héron_ in Wright, _Political Poems and\r\n    Songs_, i., 1-25 (Rolls Ser.)\r\n\r\nWar being imminent, Edward looked beyond sea for foreign allies.\r\nCommercial and traditional ties closely bound England to the county of\r\nFlanders, but our friendship had latterly been with its people rather\r\nthan with its princes. Louis of Nevers, the Count of Flanders, had been\r\nexpelled in 1328 by a rising of the maritime districts of the county,\r\nand had been restored by force of arms through the agency of Philip of\r\nValois. Gratitude and interest accordingly combined to make Count Louis\r\na strong partisan of Philip of Valois. Though far from absolute, he was\r\nstill possessed of sufficient authority over his unruly townsmen to\r\nmake it impossible for Edward to negotiate successfully with them. In\r\n1336 the count answered Edward's advances by prohibiting all commercial\r\nrelations between his subjects and England. Bitterly disgusted at the\r\nhostility of Flanders, Edward in 1337 passed a law through parliament\r\nwhich prohibited the export of wool to the Flemish weaving centres.\r\nThis measure provoked an economic crisis at Ghent and Ypres; but for\r\nthe moment such a catastrophe could only accentuate the differences\r\nbetween England and the count. It was otherwise, however, with the\r\nneighbouring princes of the imperial obedience. Count William I. of\r\nHainault, Holland, and Zealand was Edward III.'s father-in-law, and,\r\nduring the last months of his strenuous career, he welcomed Bishop\r\nBurghersh, Edward's chief diplomatist, to his favourite residence of\r\nValenciennes, where from April, 1337, the English ambassadors kept\r\ngreat state, \"sparing as little as if the king were present there in\r\nhis own person,\" and striving with all their might to build up an\r\nalliance with the princes of the Low Countries. When the count died,\r\nhis son and successor, William II., persisted, though with less energy,\r\nin his father's policy, and the Hainault connexion became the nucleus\r\nof a general Low German alliance. Burghersh was lavish in promises, and\r\nsoon a large number of imperial vassals took Edward's pay and promised\r\nto fight his battles. Among these were Count Reginald of Gelderland,\r\nwho since 1332 had been the husband of Edward III.'s sister Eleanor,\r\nand with him came the Counts of Berg, Jülich, Cleves, and Mark, the\r\nCount Palatine of the Rhine, and a swarm of minor potentates.\r\n\r\nHardest to win over of the Netherlandish princes was Duke John III. of\r\nBrabant, a crafty statesman and a successful warrior, who had recently\r\nconquered limburg, and won a signal victory over a formidable coalition\r\nof his neighbours. Among his former foes had been the house of Avesnes,\r\nbut he had reconciled himself with Hainault, by reason of his greater\r\nhatred for Louis of Flanders. The Flemish cities were the rivals in\r\ntrade of his own land, and their count's friendship for his French\r\nsuzerain ensured the establishment of Philip of Valois as temporary\r\nlord of Mechlin, the possession of which had long been indirectly\r\ndisputed between Brabant and Flanders. The hesitating duke was at last\r\nwon over by a favourable commercial treaty, which made Antwerp the\r\nstaple of English wools, and ensured for the looms of Louvain and\r\nBrussels the advantages denied by Edward's hostility to the\r\nclothworkers of Ghent and Ypres. Convinced that war with Philip was the\r\nsurest way of adding Mechlin to his dominions, he then joined the\r\ncircle of Edward's stipendiaries. The excommunicated and schismatic\r\nemperor, Louis of Bavaria, welcomed the advances of Burghersh. More\r\nthan one tie already bound the Bavarian to England. The English\r\nFranciscan, William of Ockham, proved himself the most active and\r\ndaring of the literary champions of the imperial claims against John\r\nXXII. Moreover, the emperor and Edward had married sisters, and their\r\nbrother-in-law, the new Count of Hainault, Holland, and Zealand, was\r\nchildless, so that they had common interests in keeping on good terms\r\nwith him. Louis' bitter enemy, Benedict XII., forbade all hope of\r\nFrench support, and blocked the way to all prospect of reconciliation\r\nwith the Church. It was natural that Louis should take his revenge by\r\nan alliance with the prince who ignored the advice of the pontiff, and\r\nhated the Valois king. As the result of all this, an offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance between Edward on the one hand and Louis and his Low\r\nGerman vassals on the other was signed at Valenciennes in the summer of\r\n1337.\r\n\r\nThe die seemed cast. Philip VI. pronounced the forfeiture of Gascony\r\nand Ponthieu. The French at once invaded Edward's duchy and county,\r\nwhile the French sailors in the Channel plundered the Anglo-Norman\r\nislands and the towns on the Sussex and Hampshire coasts. Edward\r\nredoubled his preparations for war, and issued a long manifesto to his\r\nsubjects in which he set forth in violent language his grievances\r\nagainst Philip. It was at this unlucky moment that the two cardinal\r\nlegates came upon the scene, reaching Paris in August, intent on\r\narranging a pacification. The irritation, which Benedict showed against\r\nEdward for concluding an alliance with the schismatic emperor, did not\r\nmake him more disposed to the work of conciliation. But the pope saw in\r\nthe outbreak of a great war the destruction of his last hopes of\r\nhumiliating the Bavarian, and once more played upon the weakness and\r\nimpolicy of Philip. Though France was more ready than England, and\r\nPhilip had everything to lose by delay, the French king allowed himself\r\nto be persuaded by the two legates to enter once more upon the paths of\r\nconciliation. As a preliminary measure, he revoked the order for the\r\nconfiscation of Gascony, and accepted a temporary armistice. As before\r\nin the Scottish business, Philip again played the game of the papacy.\r\nUnlike his adversary, Edward continued steadily in the line which he\r\nhad determined upon, while welcoming any delay that gave him\r\nopportunity to get ready. He employed the interval in making peace more\r\nimpossible than ever. On October 7, he renewed his claim to the French\r\ncrown, repudiated the homage into which he had been tricked during his\r\ninfancy, and sent Bishop Burghersh straight from Valenciennes to Paris\r\nas bearer of his defiance. Thus the autumn of 1337 saw a virtual\r\ndeclaration of war. In November the first serious hostilities took\r\nplace. Sir Walter Manny devastated the Flemish island of Cadzand,\r\ntaking away with him as prisoner the bastard brother of the Count of\r\nFlanders.\r\n\r\nPapal diplomacy had not yet exhausted its resources. Benedict XII. was\r\ndeeply concerned at the conclusion of the Anglo-imperial alliance. He\r\nwas convinced that the only possible way of avoiding its perils was to\r\npersuade Edward and Philip to bury their differences and unite with him\r\nagainst the emperor. He succeeded in obtaining short prolongations of\r\nthe existing armistice and, in December, 1337, the two cardinal legates\r\nlanded in England, and were gladly received by Edward, who was\r\ndelighted to gain time by negotiations. For the next six months they\r\ntarried in England, hoping against hope that something definite would\r\nresult from their efforts. Meanwhile the English hurried on their\r\npreparations for war, and Edward made ready to cross over to the\r\ncontinent. As months slipped away, the tension became more severe, and\r\nin May Edward denounced the truces, though he still kept up the\r\npretence of negotiations, and so late as June appointed ambassadors to\r\ntreat with Philip of Valois. The real interest centred in the hard\r\nfighting which at once broke out at sea between the rival seamen of\r\nEngland and Normandy. At first the advantage was with the Normans. Not\r\nonly were many English ships captured, but repeated destructive forays\r\nwere made on the coasts of the south-eastern counties. Portsmouth was\r\nburnt; the Channel Islands were ravaged; and so alarming were the\r\nFrench corsairs that, in July, 1338, the dwellers on the south coast\r\nwere ordered to take refuge in fortresses, or withdraw their goods to a\r\ndistance of four leagues from the sea.\r\n\r\nAt last the army and fleet were ready. On July 12, 1338, Edward\r\nappointed his son, the eight-year-old Duke of Cornwall, warden of\r\nEngland, and a few days later sailed from Orwell on a great ship named\r\nthe _Christopher_. A favourable wind quickly bore the royal fleet to\r\nthe mouth of the Scheldt. Thence the king and his army sailed up the\r\nriver to Antwerp, the chief port of Brabant, where they landed on July\r\n16. There, on July 22, Edward revoked all commissions addressed to the\r\nKing of France, and withheld from his agents all power to prejudice his\r\nown pretensions to the throne of the Valois. He passed more than a\r\nmonth at Antwerp, holding frequent conferences with his imperial\r\nallies, and thence proceeded through Brabant and Jülich to Cologne.\r\nFrom that city he went up the Rhine to Coblenz, where on September 5 he\r\nheld an interview with his queen's imperial brother-in-law. Their\r\nmeeting was celebrated with all the pomp and stateliness of the heyday\r\nof chivalry. Edward was accompanied by the highest nobles of his land,\r\nthe emperor by all the electors, save King John of Bohemia, who, as a\r\nLuxemburger, was a convinced partisan of the French. Louis received his\r\nally clothed in a purple dalmatic, with crown on head and with sceptre\r\nand orb in hand, surrounded by the electors and the higher dignitaries\r\nof the empire, and seated on a lofty throne erected in the Castorplatz,\r\nhard by the Romanesque basilica that watches over the junction of the\r\nMoselle with the Rhine. Another throne, somewhat lower in height, was\r\noccupied by the King of England, clothed in a robe of scarlet\r\nembroidered with gold, and surrounded by three hundred knights. Then,\r\nbefore the assembled crowd, Louis declared that Philip of France had\r\nforfeited the fiefs which he held of the empire. He put into Edward's\r\nhands a rod of gold and a charter of investiture, by which symbols he\r\nappointed him as \"Vicar-general of the Empire in all the Germanies and\r\nin all the Almaines\". Next day the allies heard a mass celebrated by\r\nthe Archbishop of Cologne in the church of St. Castor. After the\r\nservice the emperor swore to aid Edward against the King of France for\r\nseven years, while the barons of the empire took oaths to obey the\r\nimperial vicar and to march against his enemies. Thereupon the English\r\nking took farewell of the emperor, and returned to Brabant.\r\n\r\nAll was ready for war. The interview at Coblenz was the deathblow to\r\nthe papal diplomacy, and the sluggish Philip awaited in the Vermandois\r\nthe expected attack of the Anglo-imperial armies. Yet the best part of\r\na year was still to elapse before lances were crossed in earnest. The\r\nlords of the empire had no real care for the cause of Edward. They were\r\ndelighted to take his presents, to pledge themselves to support him,\r\nand to insist upon the regular payment of the subsidies he had\r\npromised. But John of Brabant was more intent on winning Mechlin than\r\non invading France, and even William of Avesnes was embarrassed by the\r\nties which bound him to Philip, his uncle, even more than to Edward,\r\nhis brother-in-law. They contented themselves with taking Edward's\r\nmoney and giving him little save promises in return. It became evident\r\nthat an imperial vicar would be obeyed even less than an emperor. Every\r\nweek of delay was dangerous to Edward, who had exhausted his resources\r\nin the pompous pageantry of his Rhenish journey, and in magnificent\r\nhousekeeping in Brabant. It was then Edward's interest, as it had\r\npreviously been Philip's, to bring matters to a crisis. That he failed\r\nto do this must be ascribed to the lukewarmness of his allies, the\r\npoverty of his exchequer, and, above all, to the still active diplomacy\r\nof Benedict XII.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal legates appeared in Brabant, but their tone was different\r\nfrom that which they had taken in the previous spring in England.\r\nProfoundly irritated by the alliance of Edward and Louis, Benedict\r\nlectured the English king on the iniquity of his courses. The empire\r\nwas vacant; the Coblenz grant was therefore of no effect; if Edward\r\npersisted in acting as vicar of the schismatic, he would be\r\nexcommunicated. Benedict stood revealed as the partisan of France. It\r\nwas in vain that Edward offered peace if France gave up the Scots and\r\nmade full restitution of Gascony. Benedict ordered his legates to\r\nrefuse to discuss the latter proposal, and, as the Gascon question lay\r\nat the root of the whole matter, an amicable settlement became more\r\nimpossible than ever. Edward hotly defended his right to make what\r\nalliances he chose with his wife's kinsmen, and bitterly denounced the\r\nemployment of the wealth of the Church in equipping the armies of his\r\nenemies. Though the cardinals, Peter and Bertrand, remained in Edward's\r\ncamp, they might, for all practical purposes, as well have been at\r\nAvignon. The papal diplomacy had failed.\r\n\r\nEdward employed the leisure forced upon him by these events in\r\nelaborating his claim to the French throne. His lawyers ransacked both\r\nRoman jurisprudence and feudal custom that they might lay before the\r\npope and Christendom plausible reasons for their master's pretensions.\r\nThey advanced pleas of an even bolder character. Was not the right of\r\nEdward to the French throne the same as that of Jesus Christ to the\r\nsuccession of David? The Virgin Mary, incapable of the succession on her\r\nown behalf, was yet able to transmit her rights to her Son. These\r\ncontentions, sacred and profane, did not touch the vital issue. It was\r\nnot the dynastic question that brought about the war, though, war being\r\ninevitable, Edward might well, as he himself said, use his claim as a\r\nbuckler to protect himself from his enemies. The fundamental difference\r\nbetween the two nations lay in the impossible position of Edward in\r\nGascony. He could not abandon his ancient patrimony, and Philip could\r\nnot give up that policy of gradually absorbing the great fiefs which the\r\nFrench kings had carried on since the days of St. Louis. The support\r\ngiven to the Scots, the Anglo-imperial alliance, the growing national\r\nanimosity of the two peoples, the rivalry of English and French\r\nmerchants and sailors, all these and many similar causes were but\r\nsecondary.[1] At this stage the claim to the French throne, though\r\nimmensely complicating the situation, and interposing formidable\r\ntechnical obstacles to the conduct of negotiations, loomed larger in\r\ntalk than in acts. It was only in 1340, when Edward saw in his\r\npretensions the best way of commanding the allegiance of Philip's sworn\r\nvassals, that the question of the French title became a serious matter.\r\n\r\n    [1] Déprez, _Les Préliminaires de la Guerre de Cent Am_, pp.\r\n    400-406, admirably elucidates the situation.\r\n\r\nOn which side did the responsibility for the war rest? National\r\nprejudices have complicated the question. English historians have seen\r\nin the aggression of Philip in Gascony, his intervention in Scottish\r\naffairs, and the buccaneering exploits of the Norman mariners, reasons\r\nadequate to provoke the patience even of a peace-loving monarch. French\r\nwriters, unable to deny these facts, have insisted upon the slowness of\r\nPhilip to requite provocation, his servile deference to papal\r\nauthority, his willingness to negotiate, and his dislike to take\r\noffence even at the denial of his right to the crown which he wore.\r\nEither king seems hesitating and reluctant when looked at from one\r\npoint of view, and pertinaciously aggressive when regarded from the\r\nopposite standpoint. It is safer to conclude that the war was\r\ninevitable than to endeavour to apportion the blame which is so equally\r\nto be divided between the two monarchs. The modern eye singles out\r\nEdward's baseless claim and makes him the aggressor, but there was\r\nlittle, as the best French historians admit, in Edward's pretension\r\nthat shocked the idea of justice in those days. Moreover this view,\r\nheld too absolutely, is confuted by the secondary position taken by the\r\nclaim during the negotiations which preceded hostilities. If in the\r\nconduct of the preliminaries we may assign to Edward the credit of\r\nsuperior insight, more resolute policy, and a more clearly perceived\r\ngoal, the intellectual superiority, which he possessed over his rival,\r\nwas hardly balanced by any special moral obliquity on his part; though\r\nto Philip, with all his weakness, must always be given the sympathy\r\nprovoked by the defence of his land against the foreign invader. It is\r\nuseless to refine the issue further. The situation had become\r\nimpossible, and fighting was the only way out of the difficulty. When\r\nin the late summer of 1339 the curtain was rung down on the\r\nlong-drawn-out diplomatic comedy, Edward had not yet finally assumed\r\nthat title of King of France, which made an inevitable strife\r\nirreconcilable, and so prolonged hostilities that the struggle became\r\nthe Hundred Years' War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY CAMPAIGNS OF THE HUNDRED YEARS' WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the late summer of 1339 Edward III. was at last able to take the\r\noffensive against France. During the negotiations England strained\r\nevery effort to provide her absent sovereign with men and money, but\r\nneither the troops nor the supplies were adequate. The army which\r\nassembled in September in the neighbourhood of Brussels consisted\r\nlargely of imperial vassals, hired by the English King, and clamorous\r\nfor the regular payment of their wages. Already Edward told his\r\nministers that, had not \"a good friend in Flanders\" advanced him a\r\nlarge sum, he would have been obliged to return with shame to England.\r\nAs it was, enough was raised to set the unwieldy host in motion, and on\r\nSeptember 20 he marched from Valenciennes, and thence advanced into the\r\nbishopric of Cambrai, whose lord, though an imperial vassal, had\r\ndeclared for France and the papacy.\r\n\r\nThe rolling uplands of the Cambrésis were devastated with fire and\r\nsword. One night an English baron took the Cardinal Bertrand, who with\r\nhis comrade Peter still accompanied Edward's host, to the summit of a\r\nhigh tower, whence they could witness the flaming homesteads and\r\nvillages of the fertile and populous district. In that woeful spectacle\r\nthe churchman saw the futility of his last two years of constant\r\nlabour, and fell in a swoon to the ground. But the confederates could\r\ndo little more than devastate the open country. Cambrai itself was\r\nbesieged to no purpose, and Edward pressed on to the invasion of\r\nFrance. On October g he spent his first night on French soil at the\r\nabbey of Mont Saint-Martin. He learnt how slender was the tie which\r\nbound his foreign allies to him, for his brother-in-law, William of\r\nHainault, refused to serve, except on imperial soil, against his uncle\r\nPhilip VI. Consoled for this defection by the arrival of the sluggish\r\nDuke of Brabant and of the Elector of Brandenburg, the eldest son of\r\nthe emperor, Edward marched through the Vermandois, the Soissonais, and\r\nthe Laonnais, burning and devastating, without meeting any serious\r\nresistance. Philip of Valois timidly held aloof in the neighbourhood of\r\nPéronne.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of October, when Edward was near St. Quentin on the Oise,\r\nthe Duke of Brabant suggested the expediency of seeking out winter\r\nquarters. The slow-moving host was almost in mutiny, when the master\r\ncrossbowman of the King of France brought a challenge from his lord.\r\n\"Let the King of England,\" ran the message, \"seek out a field\r\nfavourable for a pitched battle, where there is neither wood, nor\r\nmarsh, nor river.\" Edward cheerfully accepted a day for the combat, and\r\nchose his ground higher up the Oise valley, among the green meadowlands\r\nand hedgerows of the Thiérache. The appointed day passed by, and the\r\nFrench came not. At last, when Edward almost despaired of a meeting, he\r\nwas told that the French were arrayed at Buironfosse, on the plateau\r\nbetween the Oise and the upper Sambre, and that Philip was ready to\r\nfight the next day, Saturday, October 23. Edward once more chose a\r\nsuitable field of action in a plain between La Flamangrie and\r\nBuironfosse, a league and a half from the French. \"On the Saturday,\"\r\nwrote Edward to his son in England, \"we were in the field, a full\r\nquarter of an hour before dawn, and took up our position in a fitting\r\nplace to fight. In the early morning some of the enemy's scouts were\r\ntaken, and they told us that his advanced guard was in battle array and\r\ncoming out towards us. The news having come to our host, our allies,\r\nthough they had hitherto borne themselves somewhat sluggishly, were in\r\ntruth of such loyal intent that never were folk of such goodwill to\r\nfight. In the meantime one of our scouts, a knight of Germany, was\r\ntaken, and he showed all our array to the enemy. Thereupon the foe\r\nwithdrew his van, gave orders to encamp, made trenches around him, and\r\ncut down large trees in order to prevent us from approaching him. We\r\ntarried all day on foot in order of battle, until towards evening it\r\nseemed to our allies that we had waited long enough. And at vespers we\r\nmounted our horses and went near to Avesnes, and made him to know that\r\nwe would await him there all the Sunday. On the Monday morning we had\r\nnews that the lord Philip had withdrawn. And so would our allies no\r\nlonger afterwards abide.\"\r\n\r\nThus ended the inglorious campaign of the Thiérache. Edward returned to\r\nBrussels \"like a fox to his hole,\" and each side denounced the other\r\nfor failing to keep the appointed tryst. The chivalry of the fourteenth\r\ncentury saw something ignoble in the sluggishness of Philip; but no\r\nmodern soldier would blame him for his inactivity. Without striking a\r\nblow, he obtained the object of his campaign, for the enemy abandoned\r\nFrench territory. Had Edward been fully confident of victory, he could\r\neasily have forced a battle by advancing on Buironfosse; but he\r\npreferred to run the risk of a fiasco rather than abandon the defensive\r\ntactics on which he relied. Thus, even from the chivalrous point of\r\nview, he was by no means blameless. From the material standpoint, his\r\nfirst French campaign was a failure. It left its only mark on the\r\ndevastated countryside, the beggared peasantry, the desolated churches\r\nand monasteries, the farmsteads and villages burnt to ashes.\r\n\r\nEdward seemed ruined both in reputation and purse. He had exhausted his\r\nresources in meeting the extravagant demands of his allies, and their\r\nhelp had profited him nothing at all. Yet his inexhaustible energy\r\nopened up a surer means of foreign assistance than had been supplied by\r\nthe unruly vassals of Louis of Bavaria. At the moment when the imperial\r\nalliance was tried and found wanting, the way was opened up for close\r\nfriendship between Edward and the Flemish cities. In earlier years the\r\nchivalrous devotion of Louis of Nevers to his overlord had secured the\r\npolitical dependence of Flanders upon the King of France. If the action\r\nof their count made the Flemings the tools of French policy, their\r\ncommercial necessities bound them to England by chains forged by nature\r\nitself. Alone of the lands of northern and western Europe, Flanders was\r\nnot a self-sufficing economic community.[1] Its great ports and weaving\r\ntowns depended for their customers on foreign markets, and the raw\r\nmaterial of their staple manufacture was mainly derived from England.\r\nWhen in 1337 Edward prohibited the export of wool to Flanders, his\r\naction at once brought about the same result that the cessation of the\r\nsupplies of American cotton would cause in the manufacturing districts\r\nof Lancashire. A wool famine, like the Lancashire cotton famine of\r\n1862-65, plunged Ghent, Ypres, and Bruges into grievous distress. The\r\nstarving weavers wandered through the farms begging their bread, and,\r\nwhen charity at home proved inadequate, they exposed their rags and\r\ntheir misery in the chief cities of northern France. Even wealthy\r\nmerchants felt the pinch of the crisis which ruined the small craftsmen.\r\n\r\n    [1] See for this Pirenne, _Histoire de Belgique_, vols. i. and\r\n    ii., and Lamprecht, _Deutsche Geschichte_, iii., 304-324, and\r\n    iv., 134-142.\r\n\r\nA common desire to avoid calamity bound together the warring classes\r\nand rival districts of Flanders, as they had never been united before.\r\nBruges and Ypres had borne the brunt of earlier struggles, and had not\r\neven yet recovered from the exhaustion of the wars of the early years\r\nof the century. Their exhaustion left the way open to Ghent, where the\r\nold patricians and the rich merchants, the weavers and the fullers,\r\nforgot their ancient rivalries and worked together to remedy the\r\ncrisis. A wealthy landholder and merchant-prince of Ghent, James van\r\nArtevelde, made himself the spokesman of all classes of that great\r\nmanufacturing city. He was no demagogue nor artisan, though his\r\neloquence and force had wonderful power over the impressionable\r\ncraftsmen of the trading guilds. He was no Netherlandish patriot, as\r\nsome moderns have imagined, though he was anxious to unite Flanders\r\nwith her neighbour states, on the broad basis of their identity of\r\neconomic and political interests. A man of Ghent, above all things, his\r\npolicy was to save the imperilled industries of his native town, and to\r\nmake it the centre of a new movement for the vindication of commercial\r\nliberty against feudal domination. By the winter of 1337 this rich\r\ncapitalist allied himself with the turbulent democracy of the weavers'\r\nguilds, and put himself at the head of affairs. Early in 1338 he began\r\nto negotiate with Edward III., and his loans to the distressed monarch\r\nhad the result of removing the embargo on English wool. The famished\r\ncraftsmen hailed the enemy of their class as a god who had come down\r\nfrom heaven for their salvation.\r\n\r\nLouis of Nevers and Philip of Valois took the alarm. Seeing in the\r\nascendency of Artevelde the certainty that Flanders would join the\r\nEnglish alliance, they left no stone unturned to avoid so dire a\r\ncalamity. Artevelde, conscious of the narrow basis of his own\r\nauthority, was prudent enough to be moderate. Instead of pressing the\r\nEnglish alliance to a conclusion, he accepted the suggestion of Philip\r\nVI., that Flanders should remain neutral. Louis of Nevers hated the\r\nnotion; but in June, 1338, Edward and Philip agreed to recognise\r\nFlemish neutrality, and he was forced to acquiesce in it. Both monarchs\r\npromised to avoid Flemish territory, and offered free commercial\r\nrelations between Flanders and their respective dominions.\r\n\r\nArtevelde and the men of Ghent were the real masters of Flanders. They\r\nkept their count in scarcely veiled captivity, forcing him to wear the\r\nFlemish colours and to profess acceptance of the policy that he\r\ndisliked. In such circumstances the neutrality of Flanders could not\r\nlast long. Both Edward and Artevelde regarded it simply as a step\r\ntowards a declared alliance. Before long Philip became uneasy, and\r\nlavished concession on concession to keep the dominant party true to\r\nits promises. He gave up the degrading conditions which since the\r\ntreaty of Athis had secured the subjection of Flanders. But Edward\r\ncould offer more than his rival. He proposed to the count and the \"good\r\ntowns\" of Ghent, Bruges, and Ypres that, in return for their alliance,\r\nhe would aid them to win back the towns of Lille, Douai, Béthune, and\r\nTournai, which the French king had usurped from the Flemings, as well\r\nas the county of Artois, which had been separated from Flanders since\r\nthe days of Philip Augustus. He also offered ample commercial\r\nprivileges, the establishment of the staple of wool at Bruges as well\r\nas at Antwerp, free trade for Flemish cloth with the English markets,\r\nand a good and fixed money which was to be legal tender in Flanders,\r\nBrabant, France, and England. The Flemings demanded in return that\r\nEdward, by formally assuming the title of King of France, should stand\r\nto them as their liege lord, and thus free themselves and their count\r\nfrom the ecclesiastical penalties and dishonour involved in their\r\nwaging war against a king of France. Late in 1339, these terms were\r\nmutually accepted, and Count Louis avoided further humiliations by\r\nflight into France.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1340, Edward entered Flemish territory and was\r\nmagnificently entertained in the abbey of Saint Bavon at Ghent. \"The\r\nthree towns of Flanders,\" declared Artevelde to his guest, \"are ready\r\nto recognise you as their sovereign lord, provided that you engage\r\nyourself to defend them.\" The deputies of the three towns took oaths to\r\nEdward as their suzerain, and thereupon Edward was proclaimed King of\r\nFrance with much ceremony in the Friday market of Ghent. A new great\r\nseal was fashioned and new royal arms assumed, in which the lilies of\r\nFrance were quartered with the leopards of England. The new regnal year\r\nof Edward, which began on January 25, was styled the fourteenth of his\r\nreign in England, and the first of his reign in France. Urgent affairs\r\ncalled Edward back to his kingdom, but his debts to the Flemings were\r\nalready so heavy that they only consented to his departure on his\r\npledging himself to return before Michaelmas day, and on his leaving as\r\nhostages his queen, his two sons, and two earls. At last, on February\r\n20, he crossed over from Sluys to Orwell. He had been absent from home\r\nfor nearly a year and a half.\r\n\r\nFrom February 21 to June 22, 1340, Edward remained in England. During\r\nthat period, formal treaties with the Flemings confirmed the hasty\r\nnegotiations of Ghent. Benedict XII, still pursued Edward with\r\nremonstrances. He warned the English king to have no trust in allies\r\nlike the Flemings, who had shamefully driven away their natural lords\r\nand whose faithlessness and inconstancy were by-words. He told him that\r\nhis strength was not enough to conquer France, and reproached him with\r\ncalling himself king of a land of which he possessed nothing. Somewhat\r\ninconsistently, he offered his mediation between Edward and Philip. But\r\nPhilip was only less weary than Edward of the self-seeking pontiff.\r\nBenedict was forced to drink the cup of humiliation, for after the\r\nrejection of his mediation, he was confronted with a proposal that the\r\nschismatic Bavarian should arbitrate between the two crowns. Meanwhile,\r\nafter many delays, Edward embarked a gallant army on a fleet of 200\r\nships, and on June 22 a favourable west wind bore them from the Orwell\r\ntowards Flanders. On arriving next day off Blankenberghe, he learned\r\nthat a formidable French squadron was anchored in the mouth of the\r\nZwyn, and that he could only land in Flanders as the reward of victory.\r\n\r\nFrom the outbreak of hostilities in 1337, there had been a good deal of\r\nfighting by sea, and in the first stages of warfare the advantage lay\r\nwith the French. Since the days of Edward I., and Philip the Fair, the\r\nmaritime energies of the two countries had developed at an almost equal\r\nrate, and the parallel growth had been marked by bitter rivalry between\r\nthe seamen of the two nations. The Normans had taken the leading share\r\nin this expansion of the French navy.[1] They welcomed the outbreak of\r\nwar with enthusiasm, as giving them a chance of measuring their forces\r\nwith their hated foes. Alone among the provinces of France, Normandy\r\nseems already to have experienced that intense national bitterness\r\nagainst the English which was soon to spread to all the rest of the\r\ncountry. Not content with the vigorous war of corsairs which had\r\ninflicted so much mischief on our southern coast and on English\r\nshipping, the Normans formed bold designs of a new Norman Conquest of\r\nEngland, and in return for the permanent establishment of the local\r\nestates of Normandy, agreed with Philip and his son John, who bore the\r\ntitle of Duke of Normandy, to equip a large fleet and army, with which\r\nEngland was to be invaded in the summer of 1339. Normandy, which\r\nmonopolised the glory, was to monopolise the spoil. If England were\r\nconquered, Duke John, like Duke William before him, was to be King of\r\nEngland as well as Duke of Normandy. Thus the aggressions of Edward in\r\nFrance were to be answered by Norman aggressions in England.[2]\r\n\r\n    [1] _C_. de la Roncière, _Hist, de_ la _Marine Française_; of.\r\n    Nicolas, _Hist, of the Royal Navy_.\r\n\r\n    [2] See on this subject A. Coville, _Les États_ de _Normandie_,\r\n    pp. 41-52 (1894).\r\n\r\nNothing came of this grandiose project, though the burning ruins of\r\nSouthampton, the capture of the great _Christopher_, which had borne\r\nEdward in 1338 to Antwerp, and the occupation of the Channel\r\nIslands--the last remnants of the old duchy still under English\r\nrule--showed that the Normans were in earnest. The chief result of their\r\nenergy was the equipment of the strongest French fleet that had ever\r\nbeen seen in the Channel. Though a few Genoese galleys under Barbavera\r\nand a few great Spanish ships swelled the number of the armada, 160 of\r\nthe 200 ships that formed the fleet were Norman.[1] Of the two Frenchmen\r\nin command, one, Hugh Quièret, was a Picard knight, but the other, the\r\nmore popular, was Nicholas Béhuchet, a Norman of humble birth, then a\r\nknight and the chief confidant of Philip VI. Quièret and Béhuchet had\r\nlong challenged the command of the narrow seas. But for their error of\r\ndividing their forces and preferring a piratical war of reprisals, they\r\nmight have cut off communications between England and the Netherlands.\r\nThey had learnt wisdom by experience, and their ships were massed in\r\nZwyn harbour to prevent the passage of Edward to his new allies.\r\n\r\n    [1] _S_. Luce, _La Marine normande à l'Écluse_, in _La France\r\n    pendant la Guerre de Cent Ans_, 3-31.\r\n\r\nThe coast-line between Blankenberghe and the mouth of the Scheldt was\r\nstrangely different in the fourteenth century from what it is at\r\npresent.[1] The sandy flats, through which the Zwyn now trickles to the\r\nsea, formed a large open harbour, accessible to the biggest ships then\r\nknown. It was protected on the north by the island of Cadzand, the scene\r\nof Manny's exploit in 1337, while at its head stood the town of Sluys,\r\nso called from the locks, or sluices, that regulated the waters of the\r\nship canal, which bore to the great mart of Bruges the merchantmen of\r\nevery land. It was in this harbour that Edward, on arriving off\r\nBlankenberghe, first spied the fleet of Quièret and Béhuchet. He\r\nanchored at sea for the night, and on the afternoon of June 24, the\r\nanniversary of Bannockburn, he bore down on the French, having the sun,\r\nthe tide, and the wind in his favour. On his approach Barbavera urged\r\nthat the French should take to the open sea; but Quièret and Béhuchet\r\npreferred to fight in the harbour. As an unsatisfactory compromise,\r\nhowever, the French moved a mile or so towards the enemy. Then they\r\nlashed their ships together and awaited attack.\r\n\r\n    [1] For this see Professor Tait's inset map of the district in\r\n    _Oxford Historical Atlas_, plate lvi.\r\n\r\nThe English, unable to break the serried mass of their enemies, feigned\r\na retreat, whereupon the Normans unlashed their ships and hurried in\r\npursuit into the open water. At once the English turned and met them.\r\nThe battle began when the English admiral, Robert Morley, lay alongside\r\nthe _Christopher_, which, after its capture, had been taken into the\r\nenemy's service. Soon the ships of both fleets were closely grappled\r\ntogether in a fierce hand-to-hand fight which lasted until after\r\nnightfall. The desperate eagerness of the combatants strangely\r\ncontrasted with the slackness of the campaign in the Thiérache. \"This\r\nbattle,\" says Froissart, \"was right fierce and horrible, for battles by\r\nsea are more dangerous and fiercer than battles by land, for at sea\r\nthere is no retreat nor fleeing; there is no remedy but to fight and\r\nabide fortune, and every man to show his prowess.\" In the end the\r\nEnglish won an overwhelming victory, which was completed next morning\r\nafter more hard fighting. During the night Barbavera and his Genoese put\r\nto sea and escaped, but the magnificent Norman fleet was in the hands of\r\nthe victor. The English loss was small, though it included Thomas of\r\nMonthermer, a son of Joan of Acre, and Edward himself was wounded in the\r\nthigh. The Norman force was almost annihilated. Quièret fell mortally\r\nwounded into Edward's hands; Béhuchet was captured unhurt. A later\r\nNorman legend tells how Béhuchet, when brought before the English king,\r\nanswered some taunt by boxing the king's ears, whereupon the angry\r\nmonarch hanged him forthwith from the mast of his ship.[1] But the\r\ntradition is unsupported by English authorities, and, with all his\r\nfaults, Edward was not the man to deal thus with a captive knight who\r\nhad fought his best. Master at last of the sea, Edward landed at Sluys\r\namidst the rejoicings of the Flemings, and made his way to Ghent, where\r\nhe greeted his wife, and first saw his infant son John, born during his\r\nabsence, to whom Artevelde stood as godfather.\r\n\r\n    [1] Luce, _Le Soufflet de l'Écluse_, in _La Frame pendant la\r\n    Guerre de Cent Ans_, 2nd série, pp. 3-15.\r\n\r\nEdward's military fame was established over all Europe, and, says the\r\nFlemish writer, John van Klerk, \"all who spoke the German tongue\r\nrejoiced at the defeat of the French\". Yet the victory at Sluys was the\r\nprelude to a land campaign as ineffective as the raid into the\r\nThiérache. Eager to restore their lost lands to the Flemings, Edward\r\nmade the mistake of dividing his army. He sent Robert of Artois to\r\neffect the reconquest of Artois, while he himself besieged Tournai,\r\nwhich was then in French hands. Robert's attempt to win back the lands\r\nof his ancestors was a sorry failure. Defeated outside Saint Omer, he\r\nwas unable even to invest that town. Almost equally unsuccessful was\r\nEdward's siege of Tournai, which resisted with such energy that he was\r\nsoon at the end of his resources. At last, in despair, Edward\r\nchallenged Philip VI. to decide their claim to France by single combat.\r\nThe Valois answered that he would gladly do so if, in the event of his\r\nwinning, he might obtain Edward's kingdom. In the same spirit of\r\ncaution, Philip tarried half-way between Saint Omer and Tournai,\r\nwatching both armies and afraid to strike at either. The armies wore\r\nthemselves out in this game of waiting until the widowed Countess of\r\nHainault, then abbess of the Cistercian nuns of Fontenelles, was moved\r\nby the desolation of the country to intervene between the two kings.\r\nThe mother of the Queen of England and the sister of the King of\r\nFrance, she succeeded not only by reason of her prayers, but through\r\nthe refusal of the Duke of Brabant, the Count of Hainault, and the\r\nother imperial vassals to remain longer at the war. On September 25,\r\n1340, a truce was signed at the solitary chapel of Esplechin, situated\r\nin the open country a little south of Tournai. By it hostilities\r\nbetween both kings and their respective allies were suspended, until\r\nmidsummer day, 1341. Each king was to enjoy the lands actually in his\r\npossession, and commerce was to be carried on as if peace had been\r\nmade. The most significant clause of the truce was that by which both\r\nkings pledged themselves that they \"procure not that any innovation be\r\ndone by the Church of Rome, or by others of Holy Church on either of\r\nthe said kings. And if our most holy father the pope will do that, the\r\ntwo kings shall prevent it, so far as in them lies.\"\r\n\r\nThe truce of Esplechin, renewed until 1345, put an end to the first, or\r\nNetherlandish, period of the Hundred Years' War. The imperial alliance,\r\nwhich had failed Edward, was soon to be solemnly dissolved. Early in\r\n1341, Louis of Bavaria revoked Edward's vicariate, and announced his\r\nintention of becoming henceforth the friend of his uncle, the King of\r\nFrance. This alliance between Philip and Louis completed the\r\ndiscomfiture of Benedict XII. In 1342 he died, and his successor was\r\nPeter Roger, the sometime Archbishop of Rouen, who assumed the title of\r\nClement VI. By persuading Brabant and Hainault to be neutral between\r\nFrance and England, the new pontiff broke up the last remnant of the\r\nAnglo-imperial alliance. Even Flanders and England became estranged.\r\nArtevelde, who found it a hard matter to govern Flanders after the\r\ntruce, would willingly have supported Edward. But Edward had henceforth\r\nless need of Artevelde than Artevelde had of him. In 1345 Edward again\r\nappeared at Sluys and had an interview with him, and then returned to\r\nhis own country without setting foot on Flemish soil. Artevelde soon\r\nafterwards met his death in a popular tumult. His family fled to\r\nEngland, _where_ they lived on a pension from Edward. This was the end\r\nof the Anglo-Flemish alliance.\r\n\r\nAfter the treaty of Esplechin, Edward returned to Ghent. The conclusion\r\nof military operations was a signal to all his creditors to clamour for\r\nimmediate settlement of their debts. Neither subsidies nor wool came\r\nfrom England, though the king wrote in piteous terms to his council.\r\nEdward was convinced that the real cause of his failure was the\r\nremissness of the home government, and resolved to wreak his vengeance\r\non his ministers. He was encouraged to this effect by Bishop Burghersh,\r\nwho still remembered his old feuds with Archbishop Stratford, and may\r\nwell have believed that the archbishop, who had a financier's dread of\r\nwar, had wilfully ruined his rival's diplomacy. But Edward dared not\r\nopenly return to England, for his Flemish creditors regarded his\r\npersonal presence as the best security for his debts. He was therefore\r\nreduced to the pitiful expedient of running away from them. One day he\r\nrode out of Ghent on the pretext of taking exercise, and hurried\r\nsecretly and without escort to Sluys. Thence he took ship for England,\r\nand, after a tempestuous voyage of three days and nights, sailed up the\r\nThames, and landed at the Tower on November 30, 1340, after nightfall.\r\nAt cockcrow next morning, he summoned his ministers before him,\r\ndenounced them as false traitors and drove them all from office. The\r\njudges were thrown into prison, and with them some of the leading\r\nmerchants, including William de la Pole of Hull. A special commission,\r\nlike that of 1289, scrutinised the acts of the royal officials\r\nthroughout the kingdom, and exacted heavy fines from the many who were\r\nfound wanting. Nothing but fear of provoking the wrath of the Church\r\nprevented Edward from consigning to prison the dismissed chancellor,\r\nRobert Stratford, Bishop of Chichester, and the late treasurer, Roger\r\nNorthburgh, Bishop of Coventry. Their successors were lay knights, the\r\nnew chancellor, Sir Robert Bourchier, being the first keeper of the\r\ngreat seal who was not a clerk.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the year the king had quarrelled with Archbishop Stratford,\r\nwho resigned the chancellorship. But before Edward sailed from Orwell\r\nin June there had been a partial reconciliation, and the king left\r\nStratford president of the council during his absence. When his brother\r\nand colleagues were dismissed, the archbishop was at Charing. Conscious\r\nthat he was the chief object of Edward's vengeance, he at once took\r\nsanctuary with the monks of his cathedral. Every effort was made to\r\ndrag him from his refuge. Some Louvain merchants, to whom he had bound\r\nhimself for the king's debts, demanded that he should be surrendered to\r\ntheir custody until the money was paid. He was summoned to court and\r\nafterwards to parliament. But he prudently remained safe within the\r\nwalls of Christ Church, and preached a course of sermons to the monks,\r\nin which he compared himself to St. Thomas of Canterbury, and hinted at\r\nthe danger of his incurring his prototype's fate. Edward replied to\r\nthis challenge by a lengthy pamphlet, called the _libellus famosus_.\r\nThe violence and unmeasured terms of the tractate suggest the hand of\r\nBishop Orleton, Stratford's lifelong foe, who had by Burghersh's recent\r\ndeath become the most prominent of the courtly prelates. The archbishop\r\nwas declared to be the sole cause of the king's failures. He had left\r\nEdward without funds, and in trusting to him the king had leant on a\r\nbroken reed. Stratford justified himself in another sermon in which he\r\ninvited inquiry and demanded trial by his peers.\r\n\r\nEdward so far relented as to issue letters of safe-conduct enabling the\r\narchbishop to attend the parliament summoned for April 23, 1341. But\r\nwhen Stratford took his place, the king refused to meet him, and\r\nordered him to answer in the exchequer the complaints brought against\r\nhim. The lords upheld the primate's cause, and declared that in no\r\ncircumstances could a peer of parliament be brought to trial elsewhere\r\nthan in full parliament. Edward's fury abated when he saw that he would\r\nget no grant unless he gave way. He restored Stratford to his favour,\r\nand acceded to his request that he should answer in parliament and not\r\nin the exchequer. The childish controversy ended with the personal\r\nvictory of the primate and the formal re-assertion of the important\r\nprinciple of trial by peers. But not even then was Edward able to get a\r\nsubsidy. He was further forced to embody in the statute of the year the\r\ndoctrines that auditors of the accounts of the royal officers should be\r\nelected in parliament, and that all ministers should be chosen by the\r\nking, after consultation with his estates, and should resign their\r\noffices at each meeting of parliament and be prepared to answer all\r\ncomplaints before it.\r\n\r\nThus the fallen minister brought the estates the greatest triumph over\r\nthe prerogative won during Edward's reign. Before long Edward was\r\nmagnanimous enough to resume friendly relations with him, but he was\r\nnever suffered to take a prominent part in politics. He died in 1348,\r\nafter spending his later years in the business of his see. It was a\r\nstrange irony of fate that this worldly and politic ecclesiastic should\r\nhave perforce become the champion of the rights of the Church and the\r\nliberties of the nation. His victory established a remarkable\r\nsolidarity between the high ecclesiastical party and the popular\r\nopposition, which was to last nearly as long as the century. Disgust at\r\nthis alliance moved Edward to take up the anti-clerical attitude which\r\nhenceforth marks the policy of the crown until the accession of the\r\nhouse of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nThe victory of the estates of 1341 was too complete to last. For a\r\nmedieval king to hand over the business of government to a nominated\r\nministry was in substance a return to the state of things in 1258 or\r\n1312. Edward was not the sort of man to endure the thraldom that his\r\nfather and great-grandfather had both found intolerable. Even at the\r\nmoment of sealing the statute, he and his ministers protested that they\r\nwere not bound to observe laws contrary to the constitution of the\r\nrealm. Five months later, on October 1, 1341, the king issued letters,\r\nrevoking the laws of the previous session. \"We have never,\" he\r\nimpudently declared, \"really given our consent to the aforesaid\r\npretended statute. But inasmuch as our rejecting it would have\r\ndissolved parliament in confusion, without any business having been\r\ntransacted, and so all our affairs would have been ruined, we\r\ndissembled, as was our duty, and allowed the pretended statute to be\r\nsealed.\" For more than two years he did not venture to face a\r\nparliament, but the next gathering of the estates in April, 1343,\r\nrepealed the offensive acts of 1341. Parliament was so reluctant to\r\nratify the king's high-handed action, that he did not venture to ask it\r\nfor any extraordinary grant of money. The only other important act of\r\nthis parliament was a petition from lords and commons, urging the king\r\nto check the claims of a French pope, friendly to the \"tyrant of\r\nFrance,\" to exercise ever-increasing rights of patronage over English\r\nbenefices. The anti-clerical tide was still flowing.\r\n\r\nBefore parliament met in 1343, the French war had been renewed on\r\nanother pretext. A new source of trouble arose in a disputed succession\r\nto the duchy of Brittany. The duke John III., the grandson of John II.\r\nand Edward I.'s sister Beatrice, died in April, 1341. He left no\r\nlegitimate children, and his succession was claimed by his half-brother,\r\nJohn of Montfort, and his niece Joan of Penthièvre. Montfort, the son of\r\nDuke Arthur II. by his second wife, had inherited from his mother the\r\nNorman county of Montfort l'Amaury, which became her possession as the\r\nrepresentative on the spindle side of the line of Simon de Montfort the\r\nAlbigensian crusader. Joan was the daughter of Guy, John III.'s brother\r\nof the full blood, in whose favour the great county of\r\nPenthièvre-Tréguier, including the whole of the north coast of the duchy\r\nfrom the river of Morlaix to within a few miles of the Rance, had been\r\ndissociated from the demesne and reconstituted as an appanage.[1] The\r\nheiress of Penthièvre thus ruled directly over nearly a sixth of\r\nBrittany, and her power was further strengthened by her marriage with\r\nCharles of Blois, who, though a younger son, enjoyed great influence as\r\nthe sister's son of Philip VI., and also by reason of his simple,\r\nsaintly, honourable, and martial character. The house of Penthièvre not\r\nonly stood to Brittany as the house of Lancaster stood to England, as\r\nthe natural head of the higher nobility; it also enjoyed the favour and\r\nprotection of the French king, who was ever anxious to find friends\r\namong the chief sub-tenants of his great vassals. Against so formidable\r\nan opponent John of Montfort could only secure his rights by\r\npromptitude. Accordingly he made his way to Nantes and, receiving a warm\r\nwelcome from his burgesses, proclaimed himself duke. Very few of the\r\ngreat feudatories threw in their lot with him. His strength was in the\r\npetty _noblesse_, the townsmen, and the enthusiasm of the Celtic\r\npopulation of _La Brétagne bretonnante_, which made Léon, Cornouailles,\r\nand Vannes the strongholds of his cause. Yet the Penthièvre influence\r\ntook with it the Breton-speaking inhabitants of the diocese of Tréguier,\r\nand the piety of Charles made the clergy, and especially the friars,\r\ndevoted to him.\r\n\r\n    [1] On the importance of Penthièvre, see A. de la Borderie, _La\r\n    Géographie feodale de la Brétagne_ (1889), pp. 60-65.\r\n\r\nThe fight was not waged in Brittany only. Montfort had to contend\r\nagainst the general sentiment of the French nobility and the strong\r\ninterest and affection which bound Philip VI. to uphold the claims of\r\nCharles of Blois. After a few months the parliament of Paris decided in\r\nfavour of the king's nephew against Montfort. Charles's wife was the\r\nnearest heir of the deceased duke, and had therefore a prior claim over\r\nher uncle. Montfort urged in vain that the superior rights of the male,\r\nwhich had made the Count of Valois King of France, equally gave the\r\nCount of Montfort the duchy of Brittany. He had to fight for his duchy.\r\nJohn, Duke of Normandy, the heir of France, marched to Brittany with a\r\nstrong force, to secure the establishment of his cousin in accordance\r\nwith the decree of parliament. The union of the royal troops, with the\r\nlevies of Penthièvre and the great feudatories of Brittany, was too\r\npowerful a combination to withstand. Montfort was shut up in Nantes,\r\nwas forced to capitulate, and sent prisoner to Paris. His place was\r\ntaken by his wife, Joan of Flanders, a daughter of Louis of Nevers.\r\nThis lady shewed \"the heart of a man and of a lion,\" as Froissart says.\r\nHer efforts, however, did not prevail against her formidable enemies.\r\nBit by bit she was driven from one stronghold to another, until at last\r\nshe was closely besieged in Hennebont by Charles of Blois. Before that,\r\nshe had recognised Edward as King of France, and offered him the homage\r\nof her husband and son. Edward III. readily took up the cause of\r\nMontfort. He recked little of the inconsistency involved in the prince,\r\nwho claimed France through his mother, supporting in Brittany a duke,\r\nwhose pretensions were based upon grounds similar to the claim advanced\r\nby Philip of Valois on the French throne. As in Flanders, he found two\r\nrival nations contending in the bosom of a single French fief. He at\r\nonce supported the Celtic party in Brittany as he had supported the\r\nFlemish party in Flanders. Both his allies had the same enemies in\r\nfeudalism, the French monarchy, and the pretensions of high\r\nclericalism. Afraid to renew the attack in France without allies,\r\nEdward welcomed the support of the Montfort party, as giving him a\r\nchance of renewing his assaults on his adversary of Valois. He invested\r\nMontfort with the earldom of Richmond, of which John III had died\r\npossessed. He sent Sir Walter Manny with a force sufficient to raise\r\nthe siege of Hennebont. The heroic Joan of Flanders was almost at the\r\nend of her resources, when on an early June morning, in 1342, she\r\nespied the white sails of Manny's fleet working its way from the sea up\r\nthe estuary of the Blavet, which bathes the walls of Hennebont. After\r\nthe arrival of the English, Charles of Blois abandoned the siege in\r\ndespair. For the rest of the year the war was waged on a more equal\r\nfooting. In August Edward sent to Brest an additional force under\r\nWilliam Bohun, Earl of Northampton, who attempted, though with little\r\nsuccess, to invade the domains of the house of Penthièvre. A hard-won\r\nvictory against great odds near Morlaix was made memorable by\r\nNorthampton's first applying the tactics of Halidon Hill to a pitched\r\nbattle on the continent.[1] But the earl's troops were so few that\r\nthey were forced to withdraw after their success into more friendly\r\nregions. Leon and Cornouailles then resumed allegiance to the house of\r\nMontfort. In the midst of the struggle Robert of Artois received a\r\nwound which soon ended his tempestuous career.\r\n\r\n    [1] Baker, p.76, gives the place, Knighton, ii., 25, the\r\n    details. See also my note in _Engl. Hist. Review, xix._ (1904),\r\n    713-15.\r\n\r\nEdward was eager to enter the field in person. Since his return to\r\nEngland in 1340, his only military experience had been a luckless\r\nwinter campaign in the Lothians against King David. In October, 1342,\r\nhe left the Duke of Cornwall as warden of England during his absence,\r\nand took ship at Sandwich for Brittany. He remained in the country\r\nuntil the early months of 1343, raiding the land from end to end,\r\nreceiving many of the greater barons into his obedience, and striving\r\nin particular to conquer the regions included in the modern department\r\nof the Morbihan. There he besieged Vannes, the strongest and largest\r\ncity of Brittany, says Froissart, after Nantes. The triumphs of his\r\nrival at last brought Philip VI. into Brittany. While Edward\r\nlaboriously pursued the siege of Vannes, amidst the hardships of a wet\r\nand stormy winter, Philip watched his enemy from Ploermel, a few miles\r\nto the north. For a third time the situation of Buironfosse and Tournai\r\nwas renewed. The rivals were within striking distance, but once more\r\nboth Edward and Philip were afraid to strike. History still further\r\nrepeated itself; for the cardinal-bishops of Palestrina and Frascati,\r\nsent by Clement VI. to end the struggle, travelled from camp to camp\r\nwith talk of peace. The sufferings of both armies gave the kings a\r\npowerful reason for listening to their advances. At last, on January\r\n19, 1343, a truce for nearly four years was signed at Malestroit,\r\nmidway between Ploermel and Vannes, \"in reverence of mother church, for\r\nthe honour of the cardinals, and that the parties shall be able to\r\ndeclare their reasons before the pope, not for the purpose of rendering\r\na judicial decision, but in order to make a better peace and treaty\".\r\nScotland and the Netherlands were included in the truce, and it was\r\nagreed that each belligerent should continue in the enjoyment of the\r\nterritories which he held at the moment. Vannes, the immediate apple of\r\ndiscord, was put into the hands of the pope.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1343 saw Edward back in England. The scene of interest\r\nshifted to the papal court at Avignon, where ambassadors from Edward\r\nand Philip appeared to declare their masters' rights. The protracted\r\nnegotiations were lacking in reality. The English, distrusting Clement\r\nas a French partisan, did their best to complicate the situation by\r\ncomplaints against papal provisions in favour of aliens \"not having\r\nknowledge of the tongue nor condition of those whose governance and\r\ncare should belong to them\". English indignation rose higher when,\r\ndespite the terms of the truce and the promise of the cardinals,\r\nMontfort remained immured in his French prison, while Breton nobles of\r\nhis faction were kidnapped and put to death by Philip. Clement declared\r\nhimself against Edward's claims to the French throne, and, long before\r\nthe negotiations had reached a formal conclusion, it was clear that\r\nnothing would come of them. At last in 1345 the English King denounced\r\nthe truce and prepared to renew the war. His first concern was,\r\nnecessarily finance, and he had already exhausted all his resources as\r\na borrower. The financial difficulties, which had stayed his career in\r\nthe Netherlands five years before, had reached their culmination.\r\nStratford was avenged for the outrages of 1340, for Edward was in worse\r\nembarrassments than on that winter night when the glare of torches\r\nilluminated the sovereign's sudden return to the Tower. The king's\r\nNetherlandish, Rhenish, and Italian creditors would trust him no longer\r\nand vainly clamoured for the repayment of their advances. \"We grieve,\"\r\nhe was forced to reply to the Cologne magistrates, \"nay, we blush, that\r\nwe are unable to meet our obligations at the due time.\" Edward's\r\nanxiety to prepare for fresh campaigns made him careless as to his\r\nformer obligations. His wholesale neglect to repay his debts drove the\r\ngreat banking houses of the Bardi and the Peruzzi into bankruptcy, and\r\nthe failure of the English king's creditors plunged all Florence into\r\ndeep distress. One good result came from the king's dishonour. The\r\nforeign sources of supply having dried up, Edward was forced to lean\r\nmore exclusively upon his English subjects. A wealthy family of Hull\r\nmerchants, recently transferred to London, became very flourishing. Its\r\nhead, William de la Pole, who had financed every government scheme\r\nsince the days of Mortimer, became a knight, a judge, a territorial\r\nmagnate, and the first English merchant to found a baronial house. And\r\nas the credit of the English merchants was limited, Edward was forced\r\nmore and more to rely upon parliamentary grants. The memory of the\r\nking's want of faith to the estates of 1341 had died away, and a\r\nparliament, which met in 1344, once more made Edward liberal\r\ncontributions. Secure of his subjects' support, the frivolous king\r\nlargely employed his resources in the chivalrous pageantry which\r\nstirred up the martial ardour of his barons and made the war popular.\r\nIt was then that he resolved to set up a \"round table\" at Windsor after\r\nthe fabled fashion of King Arthur. From this came the foundation of the\r\nRound Tower which Edward was to erect in his favourite abode, and the\r\norganised chivalry that was soon to culminate in the Order of the\r\nGarter. In the summer of 1345 Edward made that journey to Sluys, which\r\nhas already been noted, and he held on ship-board his last interview\r\nwith James van Artevelde. His immediate return to England showed that\r\nhe had no mind to renew his Flemish alliances. In the same year the\r\ndeath of the queen's brother, William of Avesnes, established the rule\r\nof Louis of Bavaria in the three counties of Holland, Zealand, and\r\nHainault in the right of his wife, Philippa's elder sister. Edward put\r\nin a claim on behalf of his queen, which further embittered his already\r\nuneasy relations with Louis, and led him to seek his field of combat\r\nanywhere rather than in the Netherlands. In Brittany the murder of the\r\nnobles of Montfort's faction had given an excuse for the renewal of\r\npartisan warfare as early as 1343, but Montfort was still under\r\nsurveillance in France, even after his release from Philip's prison,\r\nand Joan of Flanders, the heroic defender of Hennebont, was hopelessly\r\ninsane in England. At last in 1345 Montfort ventured to flee from\r\nFrance to England, where he did homage to Edward as King of France for\r\nthe duchy which he claimed. He then went to Brittany, and there shortly\r\nafterwards died. The new Duke of Brittany, also named John, was a mere\r\nboy when he was thus robbed of both his parents' care, and his cause\r\nlanguished for want of a head. Edward took upon himself the whole\r\ndirection of Brittany as tutor of the little duke. Northampton was once\r\nmore sent thither, but for a time the war degenerated into sieges of\r\ncastles and petty conflicts.\r\n\r\nWhile action was thus impracticable in the Netherlands, and ineffective\r\nin Brittany, Gascony became, for the first time during the struggle, the\r\nscene of military operations of the first rank. The storm of warfare had\r\nhitherto almost spared the patrimony of the English king in southern\r\nFrance. No great effort was made either by the French to capture the\r\nlast bulwarks of the Aquitanian inheritance, or by Edward to extend his\r\nduchy to its ancient limits. Cut off from other fields of expansion,\r\nEdward threw his chief energies into the enlargement of his power in\r\nsouthern France. He won over many of those Gascon nobles, including the\r\npowerful lord of Albret, who had been alienated by his former\r\nindifference. All was ready for action, and in June, 1345, Henry of\r\nGrosmont, Earl of Derby, the eldest son of Henry of Lancaster, landed at\r\nBayonne with a sufficient English force to encourage the lords of\r\nGascony to rally round the ducal banner. Soon after his landing, the\r\ndeath of his blind father made Derby Earl of Lancaster. During the next\r\neighteen months, the earl successfully led three raids into the heart of\r\nthe enemies' territory.[1] The first, begun very soon after his landing,\r\noccupied the summer of 1345. Advancing from Libourne, the limit of the\r\nAnglo-Gascon power, Henry made his way up the Dordogne, a fleet of boats\r\nco-operating with his land forces. He took the important town of\r\nBergerac, and thence, mounting the stream as far as Lalinde, he crossed\r\nthe hills separating the Dordogne from the Isle, and unsuccessfully\r\nassaulted Périgueux. Thence he advanced still further, and captured the\r\nstronghold of Auberoche, dominating the rocky valley of the Auvézère.\r\nLeaving a garrison at Auberoche, Henry returned to his base, but upon\r\nhis withdrawal the French closely besieged his conquest, and the earl\r\nmade a sudden move to its relief. On October 21 he won a brisk battle\r\noutside the walls of Auberoche before the more sluggish part of his army\r\nhad time to reach the scene of action. This famous exploit again\r\nestablished the Gascon duke in Périgord.\r\n\r\n    [1] For these campaigns, see Ribadieu, _Les Campagnes du Comté\r\n    de Derby en Guyenne, Saintonge et Poitou_ (1865).\r\n\r\nEarly in 1346 the victor of Auberoche led his forces up the Garonne\r\nvalley. La Réole, lost since 1325, was taken in January, and thence\r\nEarl Henry marched to the capture of many a town and fortress on the\r\nGaronne and the lower Lot. His most important acquisition was\r\nAiguillon, commanding the junction of the Lot and the Garonne, for its\r\npossession opened up the way for the reconquest of the Agenais, the\r\nrich fruit of the last campaign of Charles of Valois. Duke John of\r\nNormandy then appeared upon the scene, and Henry of Lancaster withdrew\r\nbefore him to the line of the Dordogne. Aiguillon stood a siege from\r\nApril to August, when the Duke of Normandy, then at the end of his\r\nresources, solicited a truce. News having come to Lancaster at Bergerac\r\nthat Edward had begun his memorable invasion of Normandy, he\r\ncontemptuously rejected the proposal. Before long, Duke John raised the\r\nsiege and hurried to his father's assistance. Thereupon Lancaster\r\nreturned to the Garonne and revictualled Aiguillon. Immediately after\r\nhe started on his third raid. This time he bent his steps northwards,\r\nand late in September was at Châteauneuf on the Charente, whence he\r\nthreatened Angoulême, and finally obtained its surrender. Crossing the\r\nCharente, he entered French Saintonge, where the important town of\r\nSaint-Jean-d'Angely opened its gates and took oaths to Edward _as_ duke\r\nand king. Then he boldly dashed into the heart of Poitou, marching by\r\nLusignan to Poitiers. \"We rode before the city,\" wrote Lancaster, \"and\r\nsummoned it, but they would do nothing. Thereupon on the Wednesday\r\nafter Michaelmas we stormed the city, and all those within were taken\r\nor slain. And the lords that were within fled away on the other side,\r\nand we tarried full eight days. Thus we have made a fair raid, God be\r\nthanked, and are come again to Saint-Jean, whence we propose to return\r\nto Bordeaux.\" This exploit ended Lancaster's Gascon career. In January,\r\n1347, he was back in England, having restored the reputation of his\r\nking in Gascony, and set an example of heroism soon to be emulated by\r\nhis cousin, the Black Prince.\r\n\r\nEdward resolved to take the field in person in the summer of 1346.\r\nSpecial efforts were made to equip the army, and lovers of ancient\r\nprecedent were dismayed when the king called upon all men of property to\r\nequip archers, hobblers, or men-at-arms, according to their substance,\r\nthat they might serve abroad at the king's wages. But the nation\r\nresponded to the king's call, and a host of some 2,400 cavalry and\r\n10,000 archers and other infantry collected at Portsmouth between Easter\r\nand the early summer.[1] There were the usual delays of a medieval\r\nmuster, and it was not until July was well begun that Edward, having\r\nconstituted his second son Lionel of Antwerp, a boy of six, as regent,\r\ntook ship at Portsmouth with his eldest son, then sixteen years of age,\r\nand, since 1343, Prince of Wales as well as Duke of Cornwall. The\r\ndestination of the army was a secret, but Edward's original idea seems\r\nto have been to join Henry of Lancaster in Gascony, though we may well\r\nbelieve that the resources of medieval transport were hardly adequate to\r\nconvey so large a force for so great a distance. Moreover, a persistent\r\nseries of south-westerly winds prohibited all attempts to round the\r\nBreton peninsula, while Godfrey of Harcourt, a Norman lord who had\r\nincurred the wrath of Philip VI. and had been driven into exile,\r\npersistently urged on Edward the superior attractions of his native\r\ncoast. When the fleet set sail from Portsmouth, it was directed to\r\nfollow in the admiral's track; and as soon as the open sea was gained,\r\nthe ships were instructed to make their way to the Côtentin. On July 12\r\nthe English army reached Saint-Vaast de la Hougue, and spent five days\r\nin disembarking and ravaging the neighbourhood.[2] Immediately on\r\nlanding, Edward dubbed the Prince of Wales a knight, along with other\r\nyoung nobles, one of whom was Roger Mortimer, the grandson and heir of\r\nthe traitor Earl of March. At last, on July 18, the English army began\r\nto move by slow stages to the south. It met with little resistance, and\r\nplundered and burnt the rich countryside at its discretion. The English\r\nmarvelled at the fertility of the country and the size and wealth of its\r\ntowns. Barfleur was as big as Sandwich, Carentan reminded them of\r\nLeicester, Saint-Lo was the size of Lincoln, and Caen was more populous\r\nthan any English city save London.\r\n\r\n    [1] On the details of this force, see Wrottesley, _Crecy and\r\n    Calais,_ in _Collections for a History of Staffordshire,_ vol.\r\n    xviii. (1897); _cf._ J.E. Morris in _Engl. Hist. Review, xiv.,_\r\n    766-69.\r\n\r\n    [2] Besides the sources for this campaign mentioned in Sir E.M.\r\n    Thompson, _Chronicle of Geoffrey le Baker,_ pp. 252-57, the\r\n    disregarded _Acta bellicosa Edwardi, etc.,_ published in\r\n    Moisant, _Le Prince Noir en Aquitaine, pp._ 157-74, from a\r\n    Corpus Christi Coll. Cambridge MS., should be mentioned. It has\r\n    first been utilised in H. Pientout's valuable paper, _La prise\r\n    de Caen par Édouard III. en 1346, in Mémoires de l'Académie de\r\n    Caen_ (1904).\r\n\r\nIt was only at Caen that any real resistance was encountered. On July\r\n26 Edward's soldiers entered the northern quarter of the town without\r\nopposition, to find the fortified enclosures of the two great abbeys of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror and his queen undefended and desolate, the _grand\r\nbourg_, the populous quarter round the church of St. Peter open to\r\nthem, and only the castle in the extreme north garrisoned. Caen was not\r\na walled town, and the defenders preferred to limit themselves to\r\nholding the southern quarter, the _Ile Saint-Jean_, which lay between\r\nthe district of St. Peter's and the river Orne, but was cut off from\r\nthe rest by a branch of the Orne that ran just south of St. Peter's\r\nchurch. There was sharp fighting at the bridge which commanded access\r\nto the island; but the English archers prepared the way, and then the\r\nmen-at-arms completed the work. After a determined conflict, the Island\r\nof St. John was captured, and its chief defenders, the Count of Eu,\r\nConstable of France, and the lord of Tancarville, the chamberlain, were\r\ntaken prisoners. Meanwhile the English fleet, which had devastated the\r\nwhole coast from Cherbourg to Ouistreham, arrived off the mouth of the\r\nOrne, laden with plunder and eager to get back home with its spoils.\r\nEdward thought it prudent to avoid a threatened mutiny by ordering the\r\nships to recross the Channel, and take with them the captives and the\r\nloot which he had amassed at Caen. During a halt of five days at Caen,\r\nEdward discovered a copy of the agreement made between the Normans and\r\nKing Philip for the invasion of England eight years before. This also\r\nhe despatched to England, where it was read before the Londoners by the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury in order to show that the aggression was not\r\nall on one side.\r\n\r\nOn July 31, Edward resumed his eastward march. At Lisieux, the next\r\nimportant stage, came the inevitable two cardinals with their\r\ninevitable proposals of mediation, which Edward put aside with scant\r\ncivility. The army was soon once more on the move, and on August 7\r\nstruck the Seine at Elbeuf, a few miles higher up the river than Rouen.\r\nHere Edward was at last in touch with his enemy. During the English\r\nmarch through lower Normandy, Philip VI. had assembled a considerable\r\narmy, with which he occupied the Norman capital. Nothing but the Seine\r\nand a few miles of country separated the two forces. But as at\r\nBuironfosse, at Tournai, and at Vannes, the French declined to attack,\r\nand Edward would not depart from his tradition of acting on the\r\ndefensive. The English slowly made their way up the left bank of the\r\nSeine, avoiding the stronger castles and walled towns, and devastating\r\nthe open country. The French followed them on the right bank, carefully\r\nwatching their movements, and breaking all the bridges. So things went\r\nuntil, on August 13, Edward reached Poissy, a town within fifteen miles\r\nof the capital.\r\n\r\nThe English advanced troops plundered up to the walls of Paris, whose\r\ncitizens, watching in terror the flames that made lurid the western\r\nsky, implored their king to come to their help. From Saint-Denis Philip\r\nissued a challenge to Edward to meet him in the open field on a fixed\r\nday, Edward, however, was not to be tempted by such appeals to his\r\nchivalry. The day after Philip's message was sent, he repaired the\r\nbridge at Poissy, crossed the Seine, sent a stinging reply to Philip's\r\nletter, and moved rapidly northwards. Avoiding Pontoise, Beauvais, and\r\nother towns, he was soon within a few miles of the Somme. Long marching\r\nhad fatigued his army, and he resolved to retreat to the Flemish\r\nfrontier. The French soon followed him by a route some miles further\r\ntowards the east. They reached the Somme earlier than the English, and\r\nwere pouring into Amiens and Abbeville, while Edward's scouts were\r\nvainly seeking for an unguarded passage over the river. If the Somme\r\ncould not be crossed, there was every chance of Edward's war-worn army\r\nbeing driven into a corner at Saint-Valery, between the broad and sandy\r\nestuary of the Somme and the open sea. When affairs had become thus\r\ncritical, local guides revealed to the English a way across the\r\nestuary, where a white band of chalk, called the _Blanche taque_,\r\ncropping out of the sandy river bed, forms a hard, practicable ford\r\nfrom one bank of the river to the other. \"Then,\" writes an official\r\nreporter, \"the King of England and his host took that water of the\r\nSomme, where never man passed before without loss, and fought their\r\nenemies, and chased them right up to the gate of Abbeville.\" That night\r\nEdward and his troops slept on the outskirts of the forest of Crecy.\r\nAfter traversing this, they took up a strong position on the northern\r\nside of the wood on Saturday, August 26. There, in the heart of his\r\ngrandmother's inheritance of Ponthieu, Edward elected to make a stand,\r\nand, for the first time in all their campaigning, Philip felt\r\nsufficient confidence to engage in an offensive battle against his\r\nrival.\r\n\r\nPonthieu is a land of low chalk downs, open fields, and dense woods,\r\nbroken by valleys, through which the small streams that water it\r\ntrickle down to the sea, and by the waterless depressions\r\ncharacteristic of a chalk country. The village of Crécy-en-Ponthieu is\r\nsituated on the north bank of the little river Maye. Immediately to the\r\neast of the village, a lateral depression, running north and south,\r\ncalled the _Vallée aux Clercs,_ falls down into the Maye valley, and is\r\nflanked with rolling downs, perhaps 150 to 200 feet in height. On the\r\nsummit of the western slopes of this valley, Edward stationed his army.\r\nIts right was held by the first of the three traditional \"battles,\"\r\nunder the personal command of the young Prince of Wales. Its front and\r\nright flank were protected by the hill, while still further to the\r\nright lay Crecy village embowered in its trees, beyond which the dense\r\nforest formed an excellent protection from attack. The second of the\r\nEnglish battles, under the Earls' of Northampton and Arundel, held the\r\nless formidable slopes of the upper portion of the _Vallée aux Clercs,_\r\ntheir left resting on the enclosures and woods of the village of\r\nWadicourt. The third battle, commanded by the king himself, and\r\nstationed in the rear as a reserve, held the rolling upland plain, on\r\nthe highest point of which was a windmill, commanding the whole field,\r\nin which Edward took up his quarters. The English men-at-arms left\r\ntheir horses in the rear. The archers of each of the two forward\r\nbattles were thrown out at an angle on the flanks, so that the enemy,\r\non approaching the serried mass of men-at-arms, had to encounter a\r\nsevere discharge of arrows both from the right and the left. It was the\r\ntactics of Halidon hill, perfected by experience and for the first time\r\napplied on a large scale against a continental enemy. The credit of it\r\nmay well be assigned to Northampton, fresh from the fight at Morlaix,\r\nwhere similar tactics had already won the day.\r\n\r\nThe English were in position early in the morning of Saturday, August\r\n26, and employed their leisure in further strengthening their lines by\r\ndigging shallow holes, like the pits at Bannockburn, in the hope of\r\nensnaring the French cavalry, if they came to close quarters with the\r\ndismounted men-at-arms. The summer day had almost ended its course\r\nbefore the French army appeared. Philip and his men had passed the\r\nprevious night at Abbeville, and had not only performed the long march\r\nfrom the capital of Ponthieu, but many of them, misled by bad\r\ninformation as to Edward's position, had made a weary detour to the\r\nnorth-west. It was not until the hour of vespers that the mass of the\r\nFrench host was marshalled in front of the village of Estrées on the\r\neastward plateau beyond the _Vallée aux Clercs_. John of Hainault, who\r\nhad become a thorough-going French partisan, advised Philip to delay\r\nbattle until the following day. The French were tired; all the army had\r\nnot yet come up; night would soon put an end to the combat; the evening\r\nsun, shining brightly after a violent summer storm, was blazing\r\ndirectly in the faces of the assailants. But the French nobles demanded\r\nan immediate advance. Confident in their numbers and prowess, they had\r\nalready assured themselves of victory, and were quarrelling about the\r\ndivision of the captives they would make. Philip, too sympathetic with\r\nthe feudal point of view to oppose his friends, ordered the advance.\r\n\r\nThe battle began by the French sending forward a strong force of\r\nGenoese crossbowmen, to prepare the way for the cavalry charge. But the\r\nlong bows of the English outshot the obsolete and cumbrous weapons of\r\nthe Genoese, whose strings had been wetted by the recent storm. The\r\nItalians descended into the valley, but were soon demoralised by seeing\r\ntheir comrades fall all round them, while their own bolts failed to\r\nreach the enemy. They were already in full retreat back up the slope,\r\nwhen the impatience of the French horsemen burst all bounds. The\r\nreckless cavalry charge swept right through the disordered ranks of the\r\ncrossbowmen, whose groans and cries as they were trampled underfoot by\r\nthe mail-clad steeds, inspired the rear ranks of the French with the\r\nvain belief that the English were hard pressed, and made them eager to\r\njoin the fray. The charge, as disorderly and as badly directed as the\r\nfatal attack of Bannockburn, never reached the English ranks. Shot down\r\nright and left by archers, terrified by the fearful booming of three\r\nsmall cannon that the English had dragged about during their\r\nwanderings, the French line soon became a confused mob of furious\r\nhorsemen on panic-stricken horses. With gallantry even more conspicuous\r\nthan their want of discipline, the French made no less than fifteen\r\nattempts to penetrate the enemies' lines. At one point only did they\r\nget near their goal, and that was on the right battle where the Prince\r\nof Wales himself was in command. A timely reinforcement sent by King\r\nEdward relieved the pressure, and the French were soon in full retreat,\r\nprotected, as the English boasted, from further attack by the rampart\r\nof dead that they left behind them. The darkness, which ended the\r\nstruggle, forbade all pursuit. Next day the fight was renewed by fresh\r\nFrench forces, but a fog hampered their movements, and they fell easy\r\nvictims to the English. Then the defeated force retreated to Abbeville.\r\nThe English loss was insignificant, but the field was covered with the\r\nbravest and noblest of the French. Among those who perished on the side\r\nof Philip were Louis of Nevers, the chivalrous Count of Flanders, who\r\nhad sacrificed everything save his honour on the altar of feudal duty,\r\nand the blind King John of Bohemia, whose end was as romantic and\r\nfutile as his life. Both these princes left as their successors sons of\r\nvery different stamp in Louis de Male, and Charles of Moravia. Charles,\r\nwho had recently been set up as King of the Romans by the clerical\r\nparty against Louis of Bavaria, was present at Crecy, but a prudent\r\nretreat saved him from his father's fate.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the Norman campaign, Philip urgently besought David,\r\nKing of Scots, to make a diversion in his favour. Since 1341 David,\r\nthen a youth of seventeen, had been back in Scotland. Prolonged truces\r\ngave him little opportunity of trying his skill as a soldier, and his\r\ndomestic rule was not particularly successful. The full effects of the\r\nFranco-Scottish alliance were revealed when, early in October, the\r\nScottish king invaded the north of England, confident that, as all the\r\nfighting-men were in France, he would meet no more formidable opponents\r\nthan monks, peasants, and shepherds. The five days' resistance of Lord\r\nWake's border peel of Castleton in Liddesdale showed the baselessness\r\nof this imagination. At its capture on October 10, David put to death\r\nits gallant captain, a knight named Walter Selby. Then the Scots\r\nstreamed over the hills into Upper Tynedale, and soon devastated\r\nDurham. Such of the border lords as were not with the king in France\r\nhad now prepared for resistance. Beside the Nevilles, Percys, and other\r\ngreat houses of the north, the Archbishop of York, William de la Zouch,\r\ntook a vigorous part in organising the local levies, and in a very\r\nshort space of time a sufficient army assembled to make head against\r\nthe invaders. From their muster at Richmond, the northern barons\r\nmarched into the land of St. Cuthbert, many priests following their\r\narchbishop as of old their predecessors had followed Melton or\r\nThurstan. On October 17 the forces joined battle at Neville's Cross, a\r\nwayside landmark on the Red hills, a rough and broken region sloping\r\ndown to the Wear, immediately to the west of the city of Durham.\r\nNeither host was large in size, and each stood facing the other, with\r\nthe archers at either wing, after the fashion that had become Scottish\r\nas well as English. For a time neither army was willing to begin. At\r\nlast the English archers, irritated at the delay, advanced upon the\r\nScots with showers of missiles. Then the struggle grew general and\r\nafter a fierce hand-to-hand fight the English prevailed. David was\r\ntaken prisoner and was lodged in the Tower, and many of the noblest of\r\nthe Scots lay dead on the field. The diversion was a failure; the local\r\nlevies had proved amply sufficient to cope with the enemy. In thus\r\nplaying the game of the French king, David began a policy which, from\r\nNeville's Cross to Flodden, brought embarrassment to England and\r\ndesolation to Scotland. It was the inevitable penalty of two\r\nindependent and hostile states existing in one little island.\r\n\r\nSo war-worn were the victors of Crecy that all the profit they could\r\nwin from the battle was the power to continue their march undisturbed\r\nto the sea coast. On September 4, Edward reached the walls of Calais,\r\nthe last French town on the frontiers of Flanders, and the port whose\r\ncorsairs had inflicted exceptional damage on English shipping during\r\nthe whole of the war. With a keen eye to the military importance of the\r\nplace, the King abandoned the easy course of returning with his troops\r\nto England, and at once sat down before Calais. It was an arduous and\r\nprolonged siege. Calais was girt by double walls and ditches of\r\nexceptional strength and was bravely defended by John de Vienne and a\r\nnumerous garrison. Moreover the yielding soil of the sands and marshes\r\naround the town made it impossible for Edward to erect against the\r\nfortifications the cumbrous machines by which engineers then sought to\r\nbatter down the walls of towns. The only method of taking the place was\r\nby starvation. At first Edward was not able to block every avenue of\r\naccess to the beleaguered fortress. Winter came on; the troops demanded\r\npermission to go home; the sailors threatened mutiny, and the French\r\nwere actively on the watch.\r\n\r\nAmidst these troubles, Edward III showed a persistence worthy of his\r\ngrandfather. He remained at the seat of war, transacting much of the\r\nbusiness of government in the town of wooden huts which, growing up\r\nround the besiegers' lines, made the winter siege endurable. In the\r\nworst period of the year sufficient forces to man the trenches could\r\nonly be secured by wholesale charters of pardon to felonious and\r\noffending soldiers, on condition that they did not withdraw from service\r\nwithout the king's licence, so long as Edward himself remained beyond\r\nthe seas.[1] A parliament of magnates met in March, 1347, and granted an\r\naid. Instead of summoning the commons, Edward preferred to raise his\r\nchief supplies by another loan of 20,000 sacks of wool from the\r\nmerchants, by additional customs dues voted by a merchant assembly, and\r\nby considerable loans from ecclesiastics and religious houses. In April\r\nand May all England was alive with martial preparation, and gradually a\r\nforce far transcending the Crecy army was gathered round the walls of\r\nCalais, while a great fleet held the sea and prohibited the access of\r\nFrench ships to the doomed garrison. Northampton, ever fertile in\r\nexpedients, discovered that, even after the high seas were blocked,\r\nboats still crept into Calais port by hugging the shallow shore. He ran\r\nlong jetties of piles from the coast line into deep water, and thus cut\r\noff the last means of communication and of supplies. By June the town\r\nwas suffering severely from famine.\r\n\r\n    [1] See for this, _Rotulus Normannice_ in _Cal. Patent Rolls,_\r\n    1345-48, especially PP. 473-526. For the vast force gathered\r\n    later, see Wrottesley and Morris, U.S.\r\n\r\nThe French made a great effort, both by sea and land, to relieve\r\nCalais. On June 25 Northampton went out with his ships as far as the\r\nmouth of the Somme, where off Le Crotoy he won a naval victory which\r\nmade the English command of the sea absolutely secure. A month later\r\nPhilip, at the head of the land army, looked down upon the lines of\r\nCalais from the heights of Guînes. The two cardinals made their usual\r\nefforts for a truce, but the English would not allow their prey to be\r\nsnatched from them at the eleventh hour. Then Philip challenged the\r\nenemy to a pitched battle, and four knights on each side were appointed\r\nto select the place of combat. The French, however, were of no mind to\r\nrisk another Crecy, and on the morning of July 31 the smoke of their\r\nburning camp told the English that once more Philip had shrunk from a\r\nmeeting. Then at last the garrison opened its gates on August 3, 1347.\r\nThe defenders were treated chivalrously by the victor, who admired\r\ntheir courage and endurance. But the mass of the population were\r\nremoved from their homes, and numerous grants of houses and property\r\nmade to Englishmen. Edward resolved to make his conquest an English\r\ntown, and, from that time onwards, it became the fortress through which\r\nan English army might at any time be poured into France, and the\r\nwarehouse from which the spinners and weavers of Flanders were to draw\r\ntheir supplies of raw wool. For more than two hundred years, English\r\nCalais retained all its military and most of its commercial importance.\r\nLater conquests enabled a ring of forts to be erected round it which\r\nstrengthened its natural advantages.\r\n\r\nCrecy, Neville's Cross, Aiguillon, and Calais did not exhaust the\r\nglories of this strenuous time. The war of the Breton succession, which\r\nNorthampton had waged since 1345, was continued in 1346 by Thomas\r\nDagworth, a knight appointed as his lieutenant on his withdrawal to\r\njoin the army of Crecy and Calais. The Montfort star was still in the\r\nascendant, and even the hereditary dominions of Joan of Penthièvre were\r\nassailed. An English garrison was established at La Roche Derien,\r\nsituated some four miles higher up the river Jaudy than the little open\r\nepiscopal city of Tréguier, and communicating by the river with the sea\r\nand with England. So troublesome did Montfort's garrison at La Roche\r\nbecome to the vassals of Penthièvre, that in the summer of 1347 Charles\r\nof Blois collected an army, wherein nearly all the greatest feudal\r\nhouses of Brittany were strongly represented, and sat down before La\r\nRoche. Dagworth, one of the ablest of English soldiers, was at Carhaix,\r\nin the heart of the central uplands, when he heard of the danger of the\r\nsingle English post within the lands of Penthièvre. He at once hurried\r\nnorthwards, and on the night of June 19 rested at the abbey of Bégard,\r\nabout ten miles to the south of La Roche. From Bégard two roads led to\r\nLa Roche, one on each bank of the Jaudy. Thinking that Dagworth would\r\npursue the shorter road on the left bank, Charles of Blois stationed a\r\nportion of his army at some distance from La Roche on that side of the\r\nJaudy, while the rest remained with himself on the right bank before\r\nthe walls of the town. Dagworth, however, chose the longer route, and\r\nbefore daybreak, on the morning of June 20, fell suddenly upon Charles.\r\nA fierce fight in the dark was ended after dawn in favour of Montfort\r\nby a timely sally of the beleaguered garrison. In the confusion Charles\r\nforgot to recall the division uselessly stationed beyond the Jaudy, and\r\nthis error completed his ruin. Charles fought like a hero, and, after\r\nreceiving seventeen wounds, yielded up his sword to a Breton lord\r\nrather than to the English commander. When his wounds were healed,\r\nCharles was sent to London, where he joined David of Scotland, the\r\nCount of Eu, and the Lord of Tancarville. It looked as if Montfort's\r\ntriumph was secured.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his successes Edward made a truce, yielding to the\r\nearnest request of the cardinals, \"through his reverence to the\r\napostolic see\". The truce of Calais was signed on September 28, and\r\nincluded Scotland and Brittany as well as France within its scope. On\r\nOctober 12 Edward returned to his kingdom. Financial exhaustion, the\r\nneed of repose, the unwillingness of his subjects to continue the\r\ncombat, and the failure of the Flemish and Netherlandish alliances\r\nsufficiently explain this halt in the midst of victory. Yet from the\r\nmilitary standpoint Edward's action, harmful everywhere to his\r\npartisans, was particularly fatal in Brittany, where most of Penthièvre\r\nand nearly all upper Brittany were still obedient to Charles of\r\nBlois.[1] But Edward had embarked upon a course infinitely beyond his\r\nmaterial resources. When a special effort could only give him the one\r\ntown of Calais, how could he ever conquer all France?\r\n\r\n    [1] See on this A. de la Borderie, _Hist. de Brétagne_, iii.,\r\n    507, _et seq_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nFROM THE BLACK DEATH TO THE TREATY OF CALAIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the truce of Calais in 1347, Edward III and\r\nEngland were at the height of their military reputation. Perhaps the\r\nnation was in even a stronger position than the monarch. Edward had\r\ndissipated his resources in winning his successes, but the danger which\r\nfaced the ruler had but slightly impaired the fortunes of his subjects.\r\nThe country was in a sufficiently prosperous condition to bear its\r\nburdens without much real suffering. The widespread dislike of\r\nextraordinary taxation, which so often assumed the form of the familiar\r\ncry that the king must live of his own, had taken the shape of\r\nunwillingness to accept responsibility for the king's policy and a\r\ngrowing indisposition to meet his demands. But since the rule of Edward\r\nbegan, England enjoyed a prosperity so unbroken that far heavier\r\nburdens would hardly have brought about a diminution of the well-being\r\nwhich stood in glaring contrast to the desolation long inflicted by\r\nEdward's wars on France. A war waged exclusively on foreign soil did\r\nlittle harm to England, and offered careers whereby many an English\r\nadventurer was gaining a place among the landed classes. The simple\r\narchers and men-at-arms, who received high wages and good hopes of\r\nplunder in the king's foreign service, found in it a congenial and\r\nlucrative, if demoralising profession. In England, though wages were\r\nlow, provisions were cheap and employment constant. The growth of the\r\nwool trade, then further stimulated by refugees from the \"three towns\r\nof Flanders,\" against which Louis de Male was waging relentless war,\r\nwas bringing comfort to many, and riches to a few. The maritime\r\ngreatness of England that found its first results in the battle of\r\nSluys was the fruit of a commercial activity on the sea which enabled\r\nEnglish shipmen to deprive the Italians, Netherlanders, and Germans of\r\nthe overwhelming share they had hitherto enjoyed of our foreign trade.\r\nThe dark shadows of medieval life were indeed never absent from the\r\npicture; but medieval England seldom enjoyed greater wellbeing and\r\ntranquillity than during the first eighteen years of the personal rule\r\nof Edward III. One sign of the increasing attention paid to suppressing\r\ndisorder was an act of 1344, which empowered the local conservators of\r\nthe peace, already an element in the administrative machinery, to hear\r\nand determine felonies. A later act made this a part of their regular\r\nfunctions, and gave them the title of justices of the peace, thus\r\nsetting up a means of maintaining local order so effective that the old\r\nmachinery of the local courts gradually gave way to it.\r\n\r\nA rude ending to this period of prosperity was brought about by the\r\ndevastations of the pestilence known to modern readers as the Black\r\nDeath, which since 1347 had decimated the Levant. This was the bubonic\r\nplague, almost as familiar in the east of to-day as in the\r\nmid-fourteenth century. It was brought along the chief commercial\r\nhighways which bound the western world to the markets of the east. First\r\nintroduced into the west at the great ports of the Mediterranean,\r\nVenice, Genoa, Marseilles, it spread over France and Italy by the early\r\nmonths of 1348. Avignon was a chief centre of the infection, and, amidst\r\nthe desolation around him, Clement VI. strove with rare energy to give\r\npeace to a distracted world. The regions of western and northern France,\r\nwhich had felt the full force of the war, were among the worst\r\nsufferers. Aquitaine, too, was cruelly desolated, and among the victims\r\nwas Edward III.'s daughter, Joan, who perished at Bordeaux on her way to\r\nCastile, as the bride of the prince afterwards infamous as Peter the\r\nCruel. Early in August, 1348, the scourge crossed the channel, making\r\nits first appearance in England at Weymouth. Thence it spread northwards\r\nand westwards. Bristol was the first great English town to feel its\r\nravages. Though the Gloucestershire men prohibited all intercourse\r\nbetween the infected port and their own villages, the plague was in no\r\nwise stayed by their precautions. The disease extended, by way of\r\nGloucester and Oxford, to London, reaching the capital early in\r\nNovember, and continuing its ravages until the following Whitsuntide.\r\nWhen it had almost died out in London, it began, in the spring of 1349,\r\nto rage severely in East Anglia,[1] while in Lancashire the worst time\r\nseems to have been from the autumn of 1349 to the beginning of 1350.[2]\r\nScotland was so long exempt that the Scots, proud of their immunity,\r\nwere wont to swear \"by the foul death of England\". In 1350 they gathered\r\ntogether an army in Ettrick forest with the object of invading the\r\nplague-stricken border shires. But the pestilence fell upon the host\r\nassembled for the foray, and all war was stopped while Scotland was\r\ndevastated from end to end. Ireland began to suffer in August, 1349, the\r\ndisease being at first confined to the Englishry of the towns, though,\r\nafter a time, it made its way also to the pure Irish.[3]\r\n\r\n    [1] A. Jessopp, _The Black Death in East Anglia_, in _The\r\n    Coming of the Friars and Other Essays_(1889). For general\r\n    details see F.

(1890), 524-30\r\n\r\n    [3] See for Ireland, however, the vivid details in J. Clyn of\r\n    Kilkenny, _Annales Hibevnia: ad annum 1349_, ed. R. Butler,\r\n    _Irish Archaological Soc._ (1849).\r\n\r\nThe wild exaggerations of the chroniclers reflect the horror and\r\ndesolation wrought by the epidemic. There died so many, we are told,\r\nthat the survivors scarcely sufficed to bury the victims, and not one\r\nman in ten remained alive. The more moderate estimate of Froissart sets\r\ndown the proportion dead of the plague as one in three throughout all\r\nChristendom, and some modern inquirers have rashly reckoned the\r\nmortality in England as amounting to a half or a third of the\r\npopulation. In truth, complete statistics are necessarily wanting, and\r\nif the records of the admissions of the clergy attest that, in certain\r\ndioceses, half the livings changed hands during the years of\r\npestilence, it is not permissible to infer from that circumstance that\r\nthere was a similar rate of mortality from the plague over the whole of\r\nthe population. The sudden and overwhelming character of the disorder\r\nincreased the universal terror. One day a man was healthy: within a few\r\nhours of the appearance of the fatal swelling, or of the dark livid\r\nmarks which gave the plague its popular name, he was a corpse. The\r\npestilence seemed to single out the young and robust as its prey, and\r\nto spare the aged and sick. The churchyards were soon overflowing, and\r\nspecial plague pits had to be dug where the dead were heaped up by the\r\nhundred. Comparatively few magnates died, but the poor, the religious,\r\nand the clergy were chief sufferers. The law courts ceased to hold\r\nregular sessions. When the people had partially recovered from the\r\nfirst visitations of the plague, others befel them which were scarcely\r\nless severe. The years 1362 and 1369 almost rivalled the horrors of\r\n1348 and 1349.\r\n\r\nThe immediate effects of the calamity were overwhelming. At first the\r\nhorror of the foul death effaced all other considerations from men's\r\nminds. There were not enough priests to absolve the dying, and special\r\nindulgences, with full liberty to choose confessors at discretion, were\r\npromulgated from Avignon and from many diocesan chanceries. The price\r\nof commodities fell for the moment, since there were few, we are told,\r\nwho cared for riches amidst the general fear of death. The pestilence\r\nplayed such havoc with the labouring population that the beasts\r\nwandered untended in the pastures, and rich crops of corn stood rotting\r\nin the fields from lack of harvesters to gather them. There was the\r\nsame lack of clergy as of labourers, and the priest, like the peasant,\r\ndemanded a higher wage for his services by reason of the scarcity of\r\nlabour. A mower was not to be had for less than a shilling a day with\r\nhis food, and a chaplain, formerly glad to receive two marks and his\r\nboard, demanded ten pounds, or ten marks at the least. Non-residence,\r\nneglect of cures, and other evils followed. As Langland wrote:--\r\n\r\n  Persones and parisch prestes - playneth to heore bisschops,\r\n  That heore parisch hath ben pore - seththe the pestilence tyme,\r\n  And asketh leue and lycence - at Londun to dwelle,\r\n  To singe ther for simonye - for seluer is swete.[1]\r\n\r\nThe lack of clergy was in some measure compensated by the rush of\r\ncandidates for orders. Some of these new clerks were men who had lost\r\ntheir wives by the plague; many of them were illiterate, or if they\r\nknew how to read their mass-book, could not understand it. The close\r\nsocial life of the monasteries proved particularly favourable to the\r\nspread of the disease; the number of monks and nuns declined\r\nconsiderably, and, since there was no great desire to embrace the\r\nreligious profession, many houses remained half empty for generations.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Vision of Piers Plowman_, i., p. g, ed. Skeat.\r\n\r\nNo one in the Middle Ages believed in letting economic laws work out\r\ntheir natural results. If anything were amiss, it was the duty of kings\r\nand princes to set things right. Accordingly Edward and his council at\r\nonce strove to remedy the lack of labourers by ordinances that\r\nharvesters and other workmen should not demand more wages than they had\r\nbeen in the habit of receiving, while the bishops, following the royal\r\nexample, ordered chaplains and vicars to be content with their\r\naccustomed salaries. As soon as parliament ventured to assemble, the\r\nroyal orders were embodied in the famous statute of labourers of 1351.\r\nThis measure has been condemned as an attempt of a capitalist\r\nparliament to force poor men to work for their masters at wages far\r\nbelow the market rates. But it was no new thing to fix wages by\r\nauthority, and the medieval conception was that a just and living wage\r\nshould be settled by law, rather than left to accident. The statute\r\nprovided that prices, like wages, should remain as they had been before\r\nthe pestilence, so that, far from only regarding the interests of the\r\nemployer, it attempted to maintain the old ratio between the rate of\r\nwages and the price of commodities. Moreover it sought to provide for\r\nthe cultivation of the soil by enacting that the sturdy beggar, who,\r\nthough able, refused to work, should be forced to put his hand to the\r\nplough. Futile as the statute of labourers was, it was not much more\r\nineffective than most laws of the time. Though real efforts were made\r\nto carry it out, the chronic weakness of a medieval executive soon\r\nrecoiled before the hopeless task of enforcing impossible laws on an\r\nunwilling population. Class prejudices only showed themselves in the\r\nstipulation that, while the employer was forbidden to pay the new rate\r\nof wages under pain of heavy fines, the labourers who refused, to work\r\non the old terms were imprisoned and only released upon taking oath to\r\naccept their ancient wages. In effect, however, the king's arm was not\r\nlong enough to reach either class. The labourers, says a chronicler,\r\nwere so puffed up and quarrelsome that they would not observe the new\r\nenactment, and the master's alternative was either to see his crops\r\nperish unharvested, or to gratify the greedy desires of the workmen by\r\nviolating the statute. While labourers could escape punishment through\r\ntheir numbers, the employer was more accessible to the royal officers.\r\n\r\nThus the labourers enjoyed the benefits of the scarcity of labour,\r\nwhile the employers suffered the full inconveniences of the change.\r\nProducers were to some extent recompensed by a great rise in prices,\r\nmore especially in the case of those commodities into whose cost of\r\nproduction labour largely entered. For example the rise in the price of\r\ncorn and meat was inconsiderable, while clothing, manufactured goods,\r\nand luxuries became extraordinarily dear. Of eatables fish rose most in\r\nvalue, because the fishermen had been swept away by the plague. Rents\r\nfell heavily. Landlords found that they could only retain their tenants\r\nby wholesale remissions. When farmers perished of the plague, it was\r\noften impossible to find others to take up their farms. It was even\r\nharder for lords, who farmed their own demesne, to provide themselves\r\nwith the necessary labour. Hired labour could not be obtained except at\r\nruinous rates. It was injudicious to press for the strict performance\r\nof villein services, lest the villein should turn recalcitrant and\r\nleave his holding. The lord preferred to commute his villein's service\r\ninto a small payment. On the whole the best solution of the difficulty\r\nwas for him to abandon the ancient custom of farming his demesne\r\nthrough his bailiffs, and to let out his lands on such rents as he\r\ncould get to tenant farmers. Thus the feudal method of land tenure,\r\nwhich, since the previous century, had ceased to have much political\r\nsignificance, became economically ineffective, and began to give way to\r\na system more like that which still obtains among us.\r\n\r\nStruck by these undoubted results of the pestilence, some modern\r\nwriters have persuaded themselves that the Black Death is the one great\r\nturning-point in the social and economic history of England, and that\r\nnearly all which makes modern England what it is, is due to the effects\r\nof this pestilence. A wider survey suggests the extreme improbability\r\nof a single visitation having such far-reaching consequences. Moreover\r\nthe Black Death was not an English but a European calamity, and it is\r\nstrange to imagine that the effects of the plague in England should\r\nhave been so much deeper than in France or Germany, and so different.\r\nIn the fourteenth century there was little that was distinctly insular\r\nin the conditions of England, as compared with those of the continent.\r\nA trouble common to both regions alike could hardly have been the\r\nstarting-point of such differentiation between them as later ages\r\nundoubtedly witnessed. There was a French counterpart to the statute of\r\nlabourers.\r\n\r\nIn truth the Black Death was no isolated phenomenon. There were already\r\nin the air the seeds of the decay of the ancient order, and those seeds\r\nfructified more rapidly in England by reason of the plague.[1] It is\r\nonly because of the impetus which it gave to changes already in progress\r\nthat the pestilence had in a fashion more lasting results in England\r\nthan elsewhere. The last thirty years of the reign of Edward were an\r\nepoch of social upheaval and unrest contrasting strongly with the\r\nuneventful times that had preceded the Black Death. It is not right to\r\nregard the period as one of misery or severe distress. The war of\r\nclasses, which was beginning, sprang not so much from material\r\ndiscomfort of the poor, as from what unsympathetic annalists called\r\ntheir greediness, their pride, and their wantonness. The wage-earner was\r\nmaster of the situation and did not hesitate to make his power felt.\r\nWhile the spread of manufactures, the rise of prices, and the opening\r\nout of wider markets still secured the prosperity of the shopkeeper, the\r\nmerchant, or the artisan of the towns, the whole brunt of the social\r\nchange fell upon the landed classes, and most heavily upon the\r\necclesiastics and especially upon the monks. Broken down by the heavy\r\ndemands of the state, unable to share with the layman in the new avenues\r\nto wealth opened up by the expanding resources of the country, the monks\r\nsaw the chief sources of their prosperity drying up. Their rents were\r\nshrinking and it became increasingly difficult to cultivate their lands.\r\nThey never recovered their ancient welfare, and were already getting out\r\nof touch with the national life.\r\n\r\n    [1] See for this W. Cunningham, _Growth of English Industry and\r\n    Commerce,_ vol. i., p. 330 ff. (ed. 4); T.W. Page, _The End of\r\n    Villainage in England_ (American Economic Association, 1900);\r\n    and, above all, P. Vinogradoff in _Engl. Hist. Review, xv._\r\n    (1900), 774-781.\r\n\r\nOne immediate result of the plague was a renewed activity in founding\r\nreligious houses. Upon the two plague pits west and east of the city of\r\nLondon, Sir Walter Manny set up his Charterhouse in Smithfield, and\r\nEdward III. his foundation for Cistercian nuns between Tower Hill and\r\nAldgate. More characteristic of the times was the foundation of secular\r\ncolleges, which were established either with mainly ecclesiastical\r\nobjects or to encourage study at the universities. Both at Oxford and\r\nCambridge there were more colleges set up in the first than in the\r\nsecond half of the fourteenth century; and it is noteworthy that\r\nseveral Cambridge colleges incorporated after the plague were founded\r\nwith the avowed motive of filling up the gaps in the secular clergy\r\noccasioned by it. The riots between the Oxford townsmen and the clerks\r\nof the university on St. Scholastica's day, 1354, resulted in the\r\nvictory of the former because of the recent diminution in the number of\r\nthe scholars. Yet even as regards the monasteries, it is easy to\r\nexaggerate the effects of the plague. Five years after the Black Death,\r\nthe Cistercians of the Lancashire abbey of Whalley boasted that they\r\nhad added twenty monks to their convent, and were busy in enlarging\r\ntheir church.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] Cal. _Papal Registers, Petitions_, i., 264. Professor Tait,\r\n    however, informs me that the monks took a sanguine view of\r\n    their numbers. After the plague of 1362, we know that they were\r\n    not much more numerous than in the previous century.\r\n\r\nChange was in the air in religion as well as in society. Along with\r\ndemocratic ideas filtering in with the exiles from the great Flemish\r\ncities, came a breath of that restless and unquiet spirit which soon\r\nawakened the concern of the inquisition in the Netherlands. There\r\nbrotherhoods, some mystical and quietistic, others enthusiastic and\r\nfanatical, were growing in numbers and importance. Some of these bodies,\r\nBeguines, Beghards, and what not, were harmless enough, but the whole\r\nhistory of the Middle Ages bears testimony to the readiness with which\r\nreligious excitement unchastened by discipline or direction, grew into\r\ndangerous heresy. The strangest of the new communities, the Flagellants,\r\nmade its appearance in England immediately after the pestilence. In the\r\nautumn of 1349, some six score men crossed over from Holland and marched\r\nin procession through the open spaces of London, chanting doleful\r\nlitanies in their own tongue. They wore nothing save a linen cloth that\r\ncovered the lower part of their body, and on their heads hats marked\r\nwith a red cross behind and before. Each of them bore in his right hand\r\na scourge, with which he belaboured the naked back and shoulders of his\r\ncomrade in the fore rank. Twice a day they repeated this mournful\r\nexercise, and even at other times were never seen in public but with cap\r\non head and discipline in hand. Few Englishmen joined the Flagellants,\r\nbut their appearance is not unworthy of notice as the first concrete\r\nevidence of the religious unrest which soon became more widespread.\r\nBefore long the Yorkshireman, John Wycliffe, was studying arts at the\r\nlittle north-country foundation of the Balliols at Oxford, and John\r\nBall, the Essex priest, was preaching his revolutionary socialism to the\r\nvilleins. \"We are all come,\" said he, \"from one father and one mother,\r\nAdam and Eve. How can the gentry show that they are greater lords than\r\nwe?\"[1] In 1355 there were heretics in the diocese of York who\r\nmaintained that it is impossible to merit eternal life by good works,\r\nand that original sin does not deserve damnation.[2]\r\n\r\n    [1] The sentiment, or its equivalent in Ball's famous distich,\r\n    was not new; it was employed for mystical purposes in Richard\r\n    Rolle's\r\n\r\n      \"When Adam delf and Eue span, spir, if thou wil spede,\r\n      Whare was then the pride of man, that now merres his mede?\"\r\n\r\n    _Library of Early English Writers. Richard Rolle of Hampole and\r\n    his followers_, ed. Horstman, i., 73 (1895).\r\n\r\n    [2] Cal. _Papal Registers, Letters_, iii., 565.\r\n\r\nThe Flagellants were denounced as heretics by Clement VI.; the\r\nArchbishop of York proceeded against the northern heretics, and in 1366\r\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury forbade John Ball's preaching. But there\r\nwere more insidious, because more measured, enemies of the Church than\r\na handful of fanatics. The English were long convinced that the Avignon\r\npopes were playing the game of the French adversary, and Clement VI.'s\r\nefforts for peace never had a fair hearing. Since the beginning of the\r\nwar, the king laid his hand on the alien priories, and, though in his\r\nscrupulous regard for clerical rights he had allowed the monks to\r\nremain in possession, he diverted the stream of tribute from the French\r\nmother houses to his own treasury. Bolder measures against papal\r\nprovisions were taken in the years which immediately followed the\r\npestilence. Finding remonstrances futile, the parliament of 1351, which\r\npassed the statute of labourers, enacted also the first statute of\r\nprovisors. It recited that the anti-papal statute of Carlisle of 1307\r\nwas still law, and that the king had sworn to observe it. It claimed\r\nfor all electing bodies and patrons the right to elect or to present\r\nfreely to the benefices in their gift. It declared invalid all\r\nappointments brought about by way of papal provision. Provisors who had\r\naccepted appointments from Avignon were to be arrested. If convicted,\r\nthey were to be detained in prison, until they had made their peace\r\nwith the king, and found surely not to accept provisions in the future,\r\nand also not to seek their reinstatement by any process in the Roman\r\n_curia_. Two years later this measure was supplemented by the first\r\nstatute of _præmunire_, which enacted that those who brought matters\r\ncognisable in the king's courts before foreign courts should be liable\r\nto forfeiture and outlawry. Though the papal court is not specially\r\nmentioned, it is clear that this measure _was_ aimed against it.\r\n\r\nGeneral measures proving insufficient, more specific legislation soon\r\nfollowed. In 1365 a fresh statute of _præmunire_ was drawn up on the\r\ninitiative of the crown, enacting that all who obtained citations,\r\noffices, or benefices from the Roman court should incur the penalties\r\nprescribed by the act of 1353. The prelates dissociated themselves from\r\nso stringent a law, but did not actively oppose it. When in 1366,\r\nEdward requested the guidance of the estates as to how he was to deal\r\nwith the demand of Urban V. for the arrears of King John's tribute,\r\nwithheld altogether for more than thirty years, the prelates joined the\r\nlay estates in answering that neither John nor any one else could put\r\nthe realm into subjection without their consent. Even the ancient\r\noffering of Peter's pence ceased to be paid for the rest of Edward's\r\nreign. If these laws had been strictly carried out, the papal authority\r\nin England would have been gravely circumscribed. But medieval laws\r\nwere too often the mere enunciations of an ideal. The statutes of\r\nprovisors and _præmunire_ were as little executed as were the statutes\r\nof labourers, or as some elaborate sumptuary legislation passed by the\r\nparliament of 1363. The catalogue of acts of papal interference in\r\nEnglish ecclesiastical and temporal affairs is as long after the\r\npassing of these laws as before. Litigants still carried their suits to\r\nAvignon: provisions were still issued nominating to English benefices,\r\nand Edward himself set the example of disregarding his own laws by\r\nasking for the appointment of his ministers to bishoprics by way of\r\npapal provision. Papal ascendency was too firmly rooted in the\r\nfourteenth century to be eradicated by any enactment. To the average\r\nclergyman or theologian of the day the pope was still the \"universal\r\nordinary,\" the one divinely appointed source of ecclesiastical\r\nauthority, the shepherd to whom the Lord had given the commission to\r\nfeed His sheep. This theory could only be overcome by revolution; and\r\nthe parliaments and ministers of Edward III. were in no wise of a\r\nrevolutionary temper.\r\n\r\nThe anti-papal laws of the fourteenth century were the acts of the\r\nsecular not of the ecclesiastical power. They were not simply\r\nanti-papal, they were also anti-clerical in their tendency, since to the\r\nmen of the age an attack on the pope was an attack on the Church. No\r\ndoubt the English bishop at Edward's court sympathised with his master's\r\ndislike of foreign ecclesiastical interference, and the English priest\r\nwas glad to be relieved from payments to the curia. But the clergyman,\r\nwhose soul grew indignant against the curialists, still believed that\r\nthe pope was the divinely appointed autocrat of the Church universal.\r\nBeing a man, a pope might be a bad pope; but the faithful Christian,\r\nthough he might lament and protest, could not but obey in the last\r\nresort. The papacy was so essentially interwoven with the whole Church\r\nof the Middle Ages, that few figments have less historical basis than\r\nthe notion that there was an anti-papal Anglican Church in the days of\r\nthe Edwards. However, before another generation had passed away,\r\necclesiastical protests began.\r\n\r\nMonasticism no less than the papacy was of the very essence of the\r\nChurch of the Middle Ages. Yet the monastic ideal had no longer the\r\nforce that it had in previous generations, and even the latest\r\nembodiments of the religious life had declined from their original\r\npopularity. Pope John XXII. himself, in his warfare against William of\r\nOckham and the Spiritual Franciscans who had supported Louis of Bavaria,\r\ndenied in good round terms the Franciscan doctrine of \"evangelical\r\npoverty\". Ockham was now dead, and with him perished the last of the\r\ngreat cosmopolitan schoolmen, of whose birth indeed England might boast,\r\nbut who early forsook Oxford for Paris. Conspicuous among the younger\r\nacademical generation was Richard Fitzralph, Archbishop of Armagh, whose\r\nbitter attacks on the fundamental principles underlying the mendicant\r\ntheory of the regular life are indicative of the changing temper of the\r\nage. A distinguished Oxford scholar, a learned and pungent writer, a\r\npopular preacher, a reputed saint, and a good friend of the pope,\r\nFitzralph made himself, about 1357, the champion of the secular clergy\r\nagainst the friars by writing a treatise to prove that absolute poverty\r\nwas neither practised nor commended by the apostles.[1] The indignant\r\nmendicants procured the archbishop's citation to Avignon, and it was a\r\nstriking proof of the ineffectiveness of recent legislation that Edward\r\nIII. allowed him to plead his cause before the _curia_. By 1358 the\r\nfriars gained the day, but their efforts to get Fitzralph's opinions\r\ncondemned were frustrated by his death in 1360. Fitzralph had the\r\nsympathy not only of the seculars, but of the \"possessioners,\" or\r\nproperty-holding monks.\r\n\r\n    [1] See his _De Pauperie Salvatoris_, lib. i.-iv., printed by\r\n    R.L. Poole, as appendix to Wycliffe, _De Dominio Divino_.\r\n\r\nThe period of experiments in economic and anti-clerical legislation was\r\nalso marked by other important new laws, such as the ordinance of the\r\nstaple of 1354, providing that wool, leather, and other commodities\r\nwere only to be sold at certain _staple_ towns, a measure soon to be\r\nmodified by the law of 1362, which settled the staple at Calais; the\r\nordinance of 1357 for the government of Ireland, to which later\r\nreference will be made; the statute making English the language of the\r\nlaw courts in 1362, and a drastic act against purveyance in 1365. The\r\nstatute of treasons of 1352, which laid down seven several offences as\r\nalone henceforth to be regarded as treason, also demands attention. Its\r\nclassification is rude and unsystematic. While the slaying of the\r\nking's ministers or judges, and the counterfeiting of the great seal or\r\nthe king's coin, are joined with the compassing the death of the king\r\nor his wife or heir, adherence to the king's enemies, the violation of\r\nthe queen or the king's eldest daughter, as definite acts of treason,\r\nits omission to brand other notable indications of disloyally as\r\ntraitorous, inspired the judges of later generations to elaborate the\r\ndoctrine of constructive treason in order to extend in practice the\r\nscope of the act. It was, however, an advance for nobles and commons to\r\nhave set any limitations whatever to the wide power claimed by the\r\ncourts of defining treason.\r\n\r\nPartial respite from war did not diminish the martial ardour of the\r\nking and his nobles. The period of the Black Death was precisely the\r\ntime when Edward completed a plan which he had begun by the erection of\r\nhis Round Table at Windsor in 1344. By 1348 he instituted a chapel at\r\nWindsor, dedicated to St. George, served by a secular chapter, and\r\nclosely connected with a foundation for the support of poor knights.\r\nWithin a year this foundation also included the famous Order of the\r\nGarter, the type and model of all later orders of chivalry. On St.\r\nGeorge's day the king celebrated the new institution by special\r\nsolemnities. The most famous of his companions-at-arms were associated\r\nwith him as founders and first knights. Clad in russet coats sprinkled\r\nwith blue garters, a blue garter on the right leg, and a mantle of blue\r\nornamented with little shields bearing the arms of St. George, the\r\nKnights of the Garter heard mass sung by the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nin St. George's chapel, and then feasted solemnly in their common hall.\r\nTen years later the glorification of the king's birthplace was\r\ncompleted by the erection of new quarters for the king, more sumptuous\r\nand splendid than were elsewhere to be seen. The fame of the Knights of\r\nthe Garter excited the emulation of King John of France, who set up a\r\nRound Table which grew in 1351 into the knightly Order of the Star.\r\n\r\nThe rival brethren of the Garter and the Star found plenty of\r\nopportunities of demonstrating their prowess. Though between 1347 and\r\n1355 there was, so far as forms went, an almost continuous armistice\r\nfor the space of eight years, its effect was not so much to stop\r\nfighting as to limit its scale. In reality the years of nominal truce\r\nwere a period of harassing warfare in Brittany, the Calais march,\r\nGascony, and the narrow seas, which even the ravages of the Black Death\r\ndid not stop.\r\n\r\nIn Brittany affairs were in a wretched condition. The nominal duke,\r\nJohn, was a child brought up in England under the guardianship of\r\nEdward III. Edward was not in a position to spend either men or money\r\nupon Brittany. As an easy way of discharging his obligations to his\r\nward, he handed over the duchy to Sir Thomas Dagworth, the governor,\r\nwho maintained the war from local resources and had a free hand as\r\nregards his choice of agents and measures. In return for power to\r\nappropriate to his own purposes the revenues of the duchy, Dagworth\r\nundertook the custody of the fortresses, the payment of the troops, the\r\nexpenses of the administration, and the conduct of the war. In short,\r\nBrittany was leased out to him as a speculation, like a farm left\r\nderelict of husbandmen after the Black Death. Dagworth sublet to the\r\nhighest bidders the lordships, fortresses, and towns of Brittany. He\r\nestablished at various centres of his influence a military adventurer,\r\nwhose chief business was to make war support war and, moreover, bring\r\nin a good profit. The consequences were disastrous. Dagworth's captains\r\nwere for the most part Englishmen, men of character, energy, and\r\nresources, but utterly without scruples and with no other ambition than\r\nto raise a good revenue and maintain themselves in authority. The most\r\nfamous of them were members of gentle but obscure houses, whose poverty\r\ndebarred them from the ordinary avenues to fame and fortune, and whose\r\nvigour and ability made good use of their exceptional positions. Two\r\nCheshire kinsmen, Hugh Calveley and Robert Knowles, thus won, each for\r\nhimself, a place in history. Some of the adventurers were of obscurer\r\norigin, some were foreigners, German, French, or Netherlandish, and\r\nsome few Breton gentlemen of Montfort's faction. Of these Crockart, the\r\nGerman, and Raoul de Caours, the Breton, were the most famous.\r\n\r\nThe results of the system bore heavily on the Breton peasantry. Each\r\nlord of a castle levied systematic blackmail on the neighbouring\r\nparishes. These payments, called ransoms, were exacted as a condition\r\nof protection. The governor, though severely maltreating those who\r\nneglected to pay their ransom, did little to save his dependants from\r\nthe ravages of the partisans of Charles of Blois. Despite such\r\nmisdeeds, the war of partisans was brightened by many feats of heroism.\r\nThe friends of Charles of Blois disregarded the truce and waged war as\r\nwell as they could. Among them was already conspicuous the son of a\r\nnobleman of the neighbourhood of Dinan, the ugly, able, restless\r\nBertrand du Guesclin, whose enterprise and valour won for him a great\r\nlocal reputation. In 1350 Dagworth was slain. The history of the\r\nfollowing years is not to be found in the acts of his successor, Sir\r\nWalter Bentley, but in the private deeds of daring of the heroes of\r\nboth sides. Conspicuous among these is the famous Battle of the Thirty,\r\nwell known from the detailed narrative of Froissart, and the stirring\r\nverses of a contemporary French poem. This fight was fought on March\r\n27, 1351, between thirty Breton gentlemen of the Blois faction, drawn\r\nfrom the garrison of Josselin, and a less noble but even more strenuous\r\nband of thirty English and other adventurers of the Montfort party,\r\nfrom the garrison of Ploermel, seven miles to the east. Beaumanoir, the\r\ncommandant at Josselin, had been moved to indignation at the cruel\r\ntreatment of peasants who had refused to pay ransom by Robert Bembro,\r\nthe commander of Ploermel. He challenged the tyrant to combat, and\r\nthirty heroes of each party fought out their quarrel at a spot marked\r\nby the half-way oak, equidistant from the two garrisons. After a long\r\nstruggle, in which Bembro was slain, victory fell to the men from\r\nJosselin. Among the vanquished were Knowles, Calveley, and Crockart.\r\nThis fight had absolutely no influence on the fortune of the war.\r\n\r\nIn 1352 the French strove to carry on the Breton war on a grander scale,\r\nand a large army, commanded by Guy of Nesle, marshal of France, was sent\r\nto reinforce the partisans of Charles of Blois. They met Bentley at\r\nMauron, a few miles north of Ploermel, where one of the most interesting\r\nbattles of the war was fought Taught by the lesson of Crecy, Nesle had\r\nalready, in obscure fights in Poitou, ordered the French knights and\r\nmen-at-arms to fight on foot.[1] He here adopted the same plan for the\r\nfirst time in a battle of importance, but, after a severe struggle,\r\nBentley won the day. In 1353 Edward III. made a treaty with his captive,\r\nCharles of Blois. In return for a huge ransom Charles was to obtain his\r\nliberty, be recognised as Duke of Brittany, marry one of Edward's\r\ndaughters, and promise to remain neutral in the Anglo-French struggle.\r\nThe treaty involved too great a dislocation of policy to be carried out.\r\nCharles, after visiting Brittany, renounced the compact and returned to\r\nhis London prison. Thus the weary war of partisans still went on, and\r\nthenceforth the fortunes of Charles depended less upon negotiations than\r\non the growing successes of Bertrand du Guesclin.\r\n\r\n    [1] See my paper on _Some Neglected Fights between Crecy and\r\n    Poitiers_ in _Engl. Hist. Review_, vol. xxi., Oct., 1905.\r\n\r\nDuring these years Calais was the centre of much fighting. Eager to win\r\nback the town, the French bribed an Italian mercenary, then in Edward's\r\nservice, to admit them into the castle. The plot was discovered, and\r\nEdward and the Prince of Wales crossed over in disguise to help in\r\nfrustrating the French assault. The French were enticed into Calais and\r\ntaken as in a trap. Edward then sallied out of the town, and rashly\r\nengaged in personal encounter with a more numerous enemy. He was\r\nunexpectedly successful, and made wonderful display of his prowess as a\r\nknight. In revenge, the English devastated the neighbouring country by\r\nraids like that led by the Duke of Lancaster in 1351, which spread\r\ndesolation from Thérouanne to Etaples. Of more enduring importance were\r\nthe gradual extensions of the English pale by the piecemeal conquest of\r\nthe fortresses of the neighbourhood. The chief step in this direction\r\nwas the capture of Guînes in 1352. An archer named John Dancaster, who\r\nescaped from French custody in Guînes, led his comrades to the assault\r\nof the town by a way which he learnt during his imprisonment. The\r\nattack succeeded, and Dancaster, to avoid involving his master in a\r\nformal breach of the truce, professed to hold the town on his own\r\naccount and to be willing to sell it to the highest bidder. Of course\r\nthe highest bidder was Edward III. himself, and thus Guînes became the\r\nsouthern outpost of the Calais march.\r\n\r\nIn Aquitaine and Languedoc there was no thought of repose. In 1349\r\nLancaster led a foray to the gates of Toulouse, which wrought immense\r\ndamage but led to no permanent results. There was incessant border\r\nwarfare. The Anglo-Gascon forces spread beyond the limits of Edward's\r\nduchy and captured outposts in Poitou, Périgord, Quercy, and the\r\nAgenais. In retaliation, the Count of Armagnac, a strong upholder of\r\nthe French cause, did what mischief he could in those parts of Gascony\r\nadjacent to his own territories. On the whole the result of these\r\nstruggles was a considerable extension of the English power.\r\n\r\nThe most famous episode of these years was a naval battle fought off\r\nWinchelsea on August 29, 1350, against a strong fleet of Spanish\r\nprivateers commanded by Charles of La Cerda. The Spaniards having\r\nplundered English wine ships, Edward summoned a fleet to meet them, and\r\nhimself went on board, along with the Prince of Wales, Lancaster, and\r\nmany of his chief nobles. The fight that ensued was remarkable not more\r\nfor the reckless valour of the king and his nobles than for the\r\ndexterity of the English tactics. The great busses of Spain towered\r\nabove the little English vessels, like castles over cottages. Yet the\r\nEnglish did not hesitate to grapple their adversaries' craft and swarm\r\nup their sides on to the decks. Edward captured one of the chief of the\r\nSpanish ships, though his own vessel, the Cog _Thomas_, was so severely\r\ndamaged that it had to be hastily abandoned for its prize. The glory of\r\nthe victory of the \"Spaniards on the sea\" kept up the fame first won at\r\nSluys.\r\n\r\nIn these years of truce first appeared the worst scourge of the war,\r\nbands of mercenary soldiers, fighting on their own account and\r\nrecklessly devastating the regions which they chose to visit. The cry\r\nfor peace rose higher than ever. Innocent VI., who succeeded Clement VI.\r\nin 1352, took up with great energy the papal policy of mediation. Thanks\r\nto his legates' good offices, preliminary articles of peace were\r\nactually agreed upon on April 6, 1354, at Guînes. By them Edward agreed\r\nto renounce his claim to the French throne if he were granted full\r\nsovereignly over Guienne, Ponthieu, Artois, and Guînes. When the\r\nchamberlain, Burghersh, laid before parliament, which was then sitting,\r\nthe prospect of peace, \"the commons with one accord replied that,\r\nwhatever course the king and the magnates should take as regards the\r\nsaid treaty, was agreeable to them. On this reply the chamberlain said\r\nto the commons: 'Then you wish to agree to a perpetual treaty of peace,\r\nif one can be had?' And the said commons answered unanimously, 'Yea,\r\nyea'.\"[1] Vexatious delays, however, supervened, and at last the\r\nnegotiations broke down hopelessly. The French refused to surrender\r\ntheir over-lordship over the ceded provinces, and the Easter parliament\r\nof 1355 agreed with the king that war must be renewed. Two years of war\r\nwere to follow more fierce than even the struggles which had culminated\r\nin Crecy, La Roche, and Calais.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Rot. Pad.,_ ii., 262.\r\n\r\nTwo expeditions were organised to invade France in the summer of 1355,\r\none for Aquitaine under the Prince of Wales,[1] and the other for\r\nNormandy under Lancaster. Westerly winds long prevented their despatch.\r\nIt was not until September that the Prince of Wales reached Bordeaux.\r\nThe change of wind, which bore the prince to Gascony, enabled the host,\r\ncollected by the King and Lancaster on the Thames, to make its way to\r\nNormandy. But the special reason which brought the English thither was\r\nalready gone. The expedition was planned to co-operate with the King of\r\nNavarre. Charles, surnamed the Bad, traced on his father's side his\r\ndescent to that son of Philip the Bold who obtained the county of Evreux\r\nin upper Normandy for his appanage. From his mother, the daughter of\r\nLouis X., he derived his kingdom of Navarre and a claim on the French\r\nmonarchy of the same type as that of Edward III. Cunning, plausible,\r\nunscrupulous, and violent, Charles had quarrelled fiercely with King\r\nJohn, whose daughter he had married. His vast estates in Normandy made\r\nhim a valuable ally to Edward, and he had suggested joint action in that\r\nduchy against the French. Unluckily, while the west winds kept the\r\nEnglish fleet beyond the Straits of Dover, John made terms with his\r\nson-in-law. Lancaster was compensated for his disappointment by the\r\ngovernorship of Brittany. The army equipped for the Norman expedition\r\nwas diverted to Calais, whence in November, Edward and Lancaster led a\r\npurposeless foray in the direction of Hesdin, which hastily ended on the\r\narrival of the news that the Scots had surprised the town of Berwick,\r\nand were threatening its castle. Thereupon Edward hastened back home. He\r\nhad to keep the Scots quiet, before he could attack the French.\r\n\r\n    [1] For the Black Prince's career in Aquitaine, see Moisant,\r\n    _Le Prince Noir en Aquitaine_ (1894)\r\n\r\nWhen the Black Prince reached Bordeaux, he received a warm welcome from\r\nthe Gascons, and at once set out at the head of an army, partly English\r\nand partly Gascon, on a foray into the enemy's territory. He made his\r\nway from Bazas to the upper Adour through the county of Armagnac, whose\r\nlord had incurred his wrath by his devotion to the house of Valois and\r\nhis invasions of the Gascon duchy. Thence he worked eastwards, avoiding\r\nthe greater towns, and plundering and devastating wherever he could.\r\nThe Count of Armagnac, the French commander in the south, watched his\r\nprogress from Toulouse, and prudently avoided any open encounter. The\r\nprince approached within a few miles of the capital of Languedoc, but\r\nfound an easier prey in the rich towns and fertile plains in the valley\r\nof the Aude. He captured the \"town\" of Carcassonne, though he failed to\r\nreduce the fortress-crowned height of the \"city\". At Narbonne also he\r\ntook the \"town\" and left the \"city\". His progress spread terror\r\nthroughout the south, and the clerks of the university of Montpellier\r\nand the papal _curia_ at Avignon trembled lest he should continue his\r\nraid in their direction. But November came, and Edward found it prudent\r\nto retire, choosing on his westward journey a route parallel to that\r\nwhich he had previously adopted. He had achieved his real purpose in\r\ndesolating the region from which the French had derived the chief\r\nresources for their attacks on Gascony. The raiders boasted that\r\nCarcassonne was larger than York, Limoux not less great than\r\nCarcassonne, and Narbonne nearly as populous as London. Over this fair\r\nregion, where wine and oil were more abundant than water, the black\r\nband of desolation, which had already marked so many of the fairest\r\nprovinces of France, was cruelly extended.\r\n\r\nThe prince kept his Christmas at Bordeaux. Even during the winter his\r\ntroops remained active. Most of the Agenais was conquered by January,\r\n1356, while in February the capture of Périgueux opened up the way of\r\ninvasion northwards. Meanwhile the prince mustered his forces for a\r\nvigorous summer campaign. While the towns on the Isle and the Lot were\r\nyielding to his son, Edward III. was avenging the capture of Berwick by\r\na winter campaign in the Lothians. Before the end of January, 1356,\r\nBerwick was once more in his hands. Thence he passed to Roxburgh, where\r\nEdward Balliol surrendered to him all his rights over the Scottish\r\nthrone. Thenceforth styling himself no longer overlord but King of\r\nScotland, Edward mercilessly harried his new subjects. But storms\r\ndispersed the English victualling ships, and Edward's men could not\r\nlive in winter on the country that they had made a wilderness. In a few\r\nweeks they were back over the border, though their raid was long\r\nremembered in Scottish tradition as the Burnt Candlemas.\r\n\r\nAnother breach between Charles of Navarre and his father-in-law again\r\nopened to the English the way to Normandy. John lost patience at\r\nCharles's renewed intrigues, and in April arrested him and his friends\r\nat Rouen. Thereupon his brother, Philip of Navarre, rose in revolt.\r\nWith him were many of the Norman lords, including Geoffrey of Harcourt,\r\nlord of Saint-Sauveur. The English were once more invited to Normandy,\r\nand on June 18 Lancaster landed at La Hougue with the double mission of\r\naiding the Norman rebels and establishing John of Montfort, then\r\narrived at man's estate, in his Breton duchy. It was the first English\r\ninvasion of northern France during the war, in which they had, as in\r\nBrittany, the co-operation of a strong party in the land. The Navarre\r\nand Harcourt influence at once secured them the Côtentin. Meanwhile,\r\nhowever, the French were besieging the fortresses of the county of\r\nEvreux. With the object of relieving this pressure, Lancaster,\r\nimmediately after his landing, marched into the heart of Normandy, and\r\nsoon reached Verneuil. It looked for the moment as if he were destined\r\nto emulate the exploits of Edward II. in 1346. But he abruptly turned\r\nback, leaving the county of Evreux to fall into French hands. The\r\npermanent result of his intervention was to reduce Normandy to a state\r\nof anarchy nearly as complete as that of Brittany. In the autumn\r\nLancaster at last made his way to the land of which he had had nominal\r\ncharge since the previous year. He left Philip of Navarre as commander\r\nin Normandy, and the war was supported from local resources. The\r\nCôtentin being in friendly hands, Lancaster attacked the strongholds of\r\nthe Blois party, which had hitherto been exempt from the war. In\r\nOctober he laid siege to Rennes and was detained before its walls until\r\nJuly, 1357, when he agreed to desist from the attack in return for a\r\nhuge ransom. Lancaster then established young Montfort as duke. At the\r\nsame time Charles of Blois, released from his long imprisonment, once\r\nmore reappeared in his wife's inheritance, though, as his ransom was\r\nstill but partly paid, his scrupulous honour compelled him to abstain\r\nfrom personal intervention in the war. Thus Brittany got back both her\r\ndukes.\r\n\r\nThe northern operations in 1356 sink into insignificance when compared\r\nwith the exploits of the Black Prince in the south. After the capture\r\nof Périgueux, there had been some idea of the prince making a northward\r\nmovement and joining hands with Lancaster on the Loire. When Lancaster\r\nretired from Verneuil, however, the Black Prince was still in the\r\nvalley of the Dordogne. Even when all was ready, attacks on the Gascon\r\nduchy compelled him to divert a large portion of his army for the\r\ndefence of his own frontiers. Not until August 9 was he able to advance\r\nfrom Périgueux to Brantôme into hostile territory. It was a month too\r\nlate to co-operate with Lancaster, and the 7,000 men, who followed his\r\nbanners, were in equipment rather prepared for a raid than for a\r\nsystematic conquest.\r\n\r\nEdward's outward march was in a generally northerly direction. Leaving\r\nLimoges on his right, he crossed the Vienne lower down the stream, and\r\nthence he led his troops over the Creuse at Argenton and over the Indre\r\nat Châteauroux. When he traversed the Cher at Vierzon, his followers\r\nrejoiced that they had at last got out of the limits of the ancient\r\nduchy of Guienne and were invading the actual kingdom of France. On\r\npenetrating beyond the Cher into the melancholy flats of the Sologne,\r\nthe prince encountered the first serious resistance. He then turned\r\nabruptly to the west, and chased the enemy into the strong castle of\r\nRomorantin, which he captured on September 3. There he heard that John\r\nof France, who had gathered together a huge force, was holding the\r\npassages over the Loire. Edward marched to meet the enemy, and on\r\nSeptember 7 reached the neighbourhood of Tours, where he tarried in his\r\ncamp for three days. But the few bridges were destroyed or strongly\r\nguarded, and the men-at-arms found it quite impossible to make their\r\nway over the broad and swift Loire. Moreover the news came that John\r\nhad crossed the river near Blois, and was hurrying southwards.\r\nThereupon the Black Prince turned in the same direction, seeing in this\r\nsouthward march his best chance of getting to close quarters. The\r\nFrench host was enormously the superior in numbers, but after Morlaix,\r\nMauron, and Crecy, mere numerical disparity weighed but lightly on an\r\nEnglish commander.\r\n\r\nFor some days the armies marched in the same direction in parallel\r\nlines, neither knowing very clearly the exact position of the other. On\r\nSeptember 14 Edward reached Châtelherault on the Vienne. His troops\r\nwere weary and war-worn, and his transport inordinately swollen by\r\nspoils. He rested two days at Châtelherault, but was again on the move\r\non hearing that the enemy was at Chauvigny, situated some twenty miles\r\nhigher up the Vienne. Edward at once started in pursuit, only to find\r\nthat the French had retired before him to Poitiers, eighteen miles due\r\nwest of Chauvigny. Careless of his convoy, he hurried across country in\r\nthe hope of catching the elusive enemy, but was only in time to fight a\r\nrear-guard skirmish at a manor named La Chaboterie, on the road from\r\nChauvigny to Poitiers, on September, 17. That night the English lay in\r\na wood hard by the scene of action, suffering terribly from want of\r\nwater. Next day, Sunday, September 18, Edward pursued the French as\r\nnear as he could to Poitiers, halting in battle array within a league\r\nof the town. A further check on his impatience now ensued. Innocent\r\nVI.'s legate, the Cardinal Talleyrand, brother of the Count of\r\nPérigord, who was with the French army, crossed to the rival host with\r\nan offer of mediation. Edward received the cardinal courteously and\r\nspent most of the day in negotiations. But the French showed no\r\neagerness to bring matters to a conclusion, and as every hour\r\nreinforcements poured into the enemy's camp the scanty patience of the\r\nEnglish was exhausted. They declared that the legate's talk about\r\nsaving the effusion of Christian blood was only a blind to gain time,\r\nso that the French might overwhelm them. Edward broke off the\r\nnegotiations, and, retiring to a position more remote from the enemy,\r\npassed the night quietly. Early next morning the cardinal again sought\r\nto treat, but this time his offers were rejected. On his withdrawal,\r\nthe French attack began.\r\n\r\nThe topographical details of the battle of Poitiers of September 19,\r\n1356, cannot be determined with certainty. We only know that the place\r\nof the encounter was called Maupertuis, which is generally identified\r\nwith a farm now called La Cardinerie, some six miles south-east of\r\nPoitiers, and a little distance to the north of the Benedictine abbey\r\nof Nouaille. The abbey formed the southern limit of the field. On the\r\nwest the place of combat was skirted by the little river Miausson,\r\nwhich winds its way through marshes in a deep-cut valley, girt by\r\nwooded hills. The French left their horses at Poitiers, having\r\nresolved, perhaps on the advice of a Scottish knight, Sir William\r\nDouglas, to fight on foot, after the English and Scottish fashion, and\r\nas they had already fought at Mauron and elsewhere. As at Mauron, a\r\nsmall band of cavalry was retained, both for the preliminary\r\nskirmishing which then usually heralded a battle, and in the hope of\r\nriding down some of the archers. But the French did not fully\r\nunderstand the English tactics, and took no care to combine men-at-arms\r\nwith archers or crossbowmen, though these were less important against\r\nan army weak in archers and largely consisting of Gascons. Of the four\r\n\"battles\" the first, under the Marshals Audrehem and Clermont, included\r\nthe little cavalry contingent; the second was under Charles, Duke of\r\nNormandy, a youth of nineteen; the third under the Duke of Orleans, the\r\nking's brother; and the rear was commanded by the king.\r\n\r\nThe English army spent the night before the battle beyond the Miausson,\r\nbut in the morning the prince, fearing an ambuscade behind the hill of\r\nNouaillé on the east bank, abandoned his original position and crossed\r\nthe stream in order to occupy it. He divided his forces into three\r\n\"battles,\" led respectively by himself, Warwick, and William Montague,\r\nsince 1343 by his father's death Earl of Salisbury. Though he found no\r\nenemy there, he remained with his \"battle\" on the hill, because it\r\ncommanded the slopes to the north over on which the French were now\r\nadvancing. His remote position threw the brunt of the fighting upon the\r\ndivisions of Warwick and Salisbury. They were stationed side by side in\r\nadvance of him on ground lower than that held by him, but higher than\r\nthat of the enemy, and beset with bushes and vineyards which sloped\r\ndown on the left towards the marshes of the Miausson. Some distance in\r\nfront of their position, a long hedge and ditch divided the upland, on\r\nwhich the \"battles\" of Warwick and Salisbury were stationed, from the\r\nfields in which the French were arrayed. At its upper end, remote from\r\nthe Miausson, where Salisbury's command lay, the hedge was broken by a\r\ngap through which a farmer's track connected the fields on each side of\r\nit. The first fighting began when the English sent a small force of\r\nhorsemen through the gap to engage with the French cavalry beyond.\r\nWhile Audrehem, on the French right, suspended his attack to watch the\r\nresult, Clermont made his way straight for the gap, hoping to take\r\nSalisbury's division, on the upper or right-hand station, in flank.\r\nBefore he reached the gap, however, he found the hedge and the\r\napproaches to the cart-road held in force by the English archers.\r\nMeanwhile the mail-clad men and horses of Audrehem's cavalry had\r\napproached dangerously near the left of the English line, where Warwick\r\nwas stationed. Their complete armour made riders and steeds alike\r\nimpervious to the English arrows, until the prince, seeing from his\r\nhill how things were proceeding, ordered some archers to station\r\nthemselves on the marshy ground near the Miausson, in advance of the\r\nleft flank of the English army. From this position they shot at the\r\nunprotected parts of the French horses, and drove the little band of\r\ncavalry from the field. By that time Clermon's attack on the gap had\r\nbeen defeated, and so both sections of the first French division\r\nretired.\r\n\r\nThen came the stronger \"battle\" of the eldest son of the French king.\r\nThe fight grew more fierce, and for a long time the issue remained\r\ndoubtful. The English archers exhausted their arrows to little purpose,\r\nand the dismounted French men-at-arms, offering a less sure mark than\r\nthe horsemen, forced their way to the English ranks and fought a\r\ndesperate hand-to-hand conflict with them. At last the Duke of\r\nNormandy's followers were driven back. Thereupon a panic seized the\r\ndivision commanded by the Duke of Orleans, which fled from the field\r\nwithout measuring swords with the enemy. The victors themselves were in\r\na desperate plight. Many were wounded, and all were weary, especially\r\nthe men-at-arms encased in heavy plate mail. The flight of Orleans gave\r\nthem a short respite: but they soon had to face the assault of the rear\r\nbattle of the enemy, gallantly led by the king. \"No battle,\" we are\r\ntold, \"ever lasted so long. In former fights men knew, by the time that\r\nthe fourth or the sixth arrow had been discharged, on which side victory\r\nwas to be. But here a single archer shot with coolness a hundred arrows,\r\nand still neither side gave way.\"[1] At last the bowmen had only the\r\narrows they snatched from the bodies of the dead and dying, and when\r\nthese were exhausted, they were reduced to throwing stones at their\r\nfoes, or to struggle in the _mêlée_, with sword and buckler, side by\r\nside with the men-at-arms. But the Black Prince from his hill had\r\nwatched the course of the encounter, and at the right moment, when his\r\nfriends were almost worn out, marched down, and made the fight more\r\neven. Before joining himself in the engagement, Edward had ordered the\r\nCaptal de Buch, the best of his Gascons, to lead a little band, under\r\ncover of the hill, round the French position and attack the enemy in the\r\nrear. At first the Anglo-Gascon army was discouraged, thinking that the\r\ncaptal had fled, but they still fought on. Suddenly the captal and his\r\nmen assaulted the French rear. This settled the hard fought day.\r\nSurrounded on every side, the French perished in their ranks or\r\nsurrendered in despair. King John was taken prisoner, fighting\r\ndesperately to the last, and with him was captured his youngest son\r\nPhilip, the future Duke of Burgundy, a boy of twelve, whose epithet of\r\n\"the Bold\" was earned by his precocious valour in the struggle. Before\r\nnightfall the English host had sole possession of the field, and the\r\nbest fought, best directed, and most important of the battles of the war\r\nended in the complete triumph of the invaders.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Eulogium Hist._, iii., 225.\r\n\r\nAs after Crecy, the victors were too weak to continue the campaign.\r\nNext day they began their slow march back to their base. On October 2\r\nEdward reached Libourne, and a few days later conducted the captive\r\nking into the Gascon capital. They were soon followed by the Cardinal\r\nTalleyrand on whose insistence the prince agreed to resume\r\nnegotiations. On March 23, 1357, a truce to last until 1359 was\r\narranged at Bordeaux. On May 24 the prince led the vanquished king\r\nthrough the streets of London.\r\n\r\nThe English, weary of the burden of war, strove to use their advantages\r\nto procure a stable peace. Though Charles of Blois was released, he was\r\nmuzzled for the future, and when John joined his ally David Bruce in\r\nthe Tower, it was the obvious game of Edward to exact terms from his\r\nprisoners. David's spirit was broken, and he was glad to accept a\r\ntreaty sealed in October, 1357, at Berwick, by which he was released\r\nfor a ransom of 100,000 marks, to be paid by ten yearly instalments.\r\nThe task was harder for a poor country like Scotland than the\r\nredemption of Richard I. had been for England. On hostages being given,\r\nDavid was released, and Edward, without relinquishing his own\r\npretensions to be King of Scots, took no steps to enforce his claim.\r\nThe event showed that Edward knew his man. The instalments of ransom\r\ncould not be regularly paid, and David never became free from his\r\nobligations. Nothing save the tenacity of the Scottish nobles prevented\r\nhim from accepting Edward's proposals to write off the arrears of his\r\nransom in return for his accepting either the English king himself or\r\nhis son, Lionel of Antwerp, as heir of Scotland. This attitude brought\r\nDavid into conflict with his natural heir, Robert, the Steward of\r\nScotland, the son of his sister Margaret. The tension between uncle and\r\nnephew forced the Scots king to remain on friendly terms with Edward.\r\nFor the rest of the reign, Scottish history was occupied by\r\naristocratic feuds, by financial expedients for raising the king's\r\nransom, by the gradual development of the practice of entrusting the\r\npowers of parliament to those committees of the estates subsequently\r\nfamous as the lords of the articles, by David's matrimonial troubles\r\nafter Joan's death, and by his unpopular visits to the court of his\r\nneighbour. Warfare between the realms there was none, save for the\r\nchronic border feuds. When David died in 1371, the Steward of Scotland\r\nland mounted the throne as Robert II. This first of the Stewart kings\r\nwent back to the policy of the French alliance, but was too weak to\r\ninflict serious mischief on England.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1358, preliminaries of peace were also arranged with the\r\ncaptive King of France, and sent to Paris and Avignon for ratification.\r\nInnocent VI. was overjoyed at his success, and Frenchmen were willing\r\nto make any sacrifices to bring back their monarch, for immediately\r\nafter Poitiers a storm of disorder burst over France. The states\r\ngeneral met a few weeks after the battle, and the regent, Charles of\r\nNormandy, was helpless in their hands. This was the time of the power\r\nof Stephen Marcel, provost of the merchants of Paris, and of Robert\r\nLecoq, Bishop of Laon. But the movement in Paris was neither in the\r\ndirection of parliamentary government nor of democracy, and few men\r\nhave less right to be regarded as popular heroes than Marcel and Lecoq.\r\nThe estates were manipulated in the interests of aristocratic intrigue,\r\nand, behind the ostensible leaders, was the sinister influence of\r\nCharles of Navarre, who availed himself of the desolation of France to\r\nplay his own game. For a time he was the darling of the Paris mob.\r\nInnocent VI. was deceived by his protestations of zeal for peace. As\r\ngrandson of Louis X. he aspired to the French throne, and was anxious\r\nto prevent John's return. Edward had no good-will for a possible rival,\r\nbut it was his interest to keep up the anarchy, and he had no scruple\r\nin backing up Charles. There was talk of Edward becoming King of France\r\nand holding the maritime provinces, while Charles as his vassal should\r\nbe lord of Paris and the interior districts. English mercenaries, who\r\nhad lost their occupation with the truce, enlisted themselves in the\r\nservice of Navarre. Robert Knowles, James Pipe, and other ancient\r\ncaptains of Edward fought for their own hand in Normandy, and built up\r\ncolossal fortunes out of the spoils of the country. Some of these\r\nhirelings appeared in Paris, where the citizens welcomed allies of the\r\nNavarrese, even when they were foreign adventurers. However, Charles\r\nwent so far that a strong reaction deprived him of all power. He was\r\nable to prevent the ratification of the preliminaries of 1358. But in\r\nthat year the death of Marcel was followed by the return of the regent\r\nto Paris, the expulsion of the foreign mercenaries, the collapse of the\r\nestates, and the restoration of the capital to the national cause. The\r\nshort-lived horrors wreaked by the revolted peasantry were followed by\r\nthe more enduring atrocities of the nobles who suppressed them.\r\nMilitary adventurers pillaged France from end to end, but the worst\r\ntroubles ended when Charles of Navarre lost his pre-eminence.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] An admirable account of the state of France between 1356\r\n    and 1358 is in Denifie, _La Desolation des Églises en_ France\r\n    _pendant _la _Guerre de Cent Ans, ii.,_ 134-316 (1899).\r\n\r\nWhen the truce of Bordeaux was on the verge of expiration, the French\r\nking negotiated a second treaty by which he bought off the threatened\r\nrenewal of war. This was the treaty of London, March 24, 1359, by which\r\nJohn yielded up to Edward in full sovereignty the ancient empire of\r\nHenry II. Normandy, the suzerainty of Brittany, Anjou, and Maine,\r\nAquitaine within its ancient limits, Calais and Ponthieu with the\r\nsurrounding districts, were the territorial concessions in return for\r\nwhich Edward renounced his claim to the French throne. The vast ransom\r\nof 4,000,000 golden crowns was to be paid for John's redemption; the\r\nchief princes of the blood were to be hostages for him, and in case of\r\nfailure to observe the terms of the treaty he was to return to his\r\ncaptivity. The only provision in any sense favourable to France was\r\nthat by which Edward promised to aid John against the King of Navarre.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of London excited the liveliest anger in France. \"We had\r\nrather,\" declared the assembled estates, \"endure the great mischief that\r\nhas afflicted us so long, than suffer the noble realm of France thus to\r\nbe diminished and defrauded.\"[1] Spurred up by these patriotic\r\nmanifestations, the regent rejected the treaty, and prepared as best he\r\ncould for the storm of Edward's wrath which soon burst upon his country.\r\nAnxious to unite forces against the national enemy, he made peace with\r\nCharles of Navarre, who, abandoned by Edward, was delighted to be\r\nrestored to his estates.\r\n\r\n    [1] Froissart, v., 180, ed. Luce.\r\n\r\nEdward concentrated all his efforts on a new invasion of France. In\r\nNovember, 1359, he marched out of Calais with all his forces. His four\r\nsons attended him, and there was a great muster of earls and\r\nexperienced warriors. Among the less known members of the host was the\r\nyoung Londoner, Geoffrey Chaucer, a page in Lionel of Antwerp's\r\nhousehold. In three columns, each following a separate route, the\r\nEnglish made their way from Calais towards the south-east. The French\r\navoided a pitched battle, but hung on the skirts of the army and slew,\r\nor captured, stragglers and foragers. Chaucer was among those thus\r\ntaken prisoner. Edward's ambition was to take Reims, and have himself\r\ncrowned there as King of France. On December 4 he arrived at the gates\r\nof the city, and besieged it for six weeks. Then on January 11, 1360,\r\nthe King despaired of success, abandoned the siege, and marched\r\nsouthwards through Champagne towards Burgundy. Despite the check at\r\nReims, he was still so formidable that in March Duke Philip of Burgundy\r\nconcluded with him the shameful treaty of Guillon, by which he\r\npurchased exemption from invasion by an enormous ransom and a promise\r\nof neutrality.\r\n\r\nEdward next turned towards Paris. The news that the French had effected\r\na successful descent on Winchelsea and behaved with extreme brutality to\r\nthe inhabitants, infuriated the English troopers, who perpetrated a\r\nhundredfold worse deeds in the suburbs of the French capital. It seemed\r\nas if the war was about to end with the siege and capture of Paris. The\r\nregent, unable to meet the English in the field, fell back in despair on\r\nnegotiation. Innocent VI. again offered his good services. John sent\r\nfrom his English prison full powers to his son to make what terms he\r\nwould, and on April 3, which was Good Friday, ambassadors from each\r\npower met under papal intervention at Longjumeau; but Edward still\r\ninsisted on the terms of the treaty of London, for which the French were\r\nnot yet prepared. On April 7 Edward began the siege of Paris by an\r\nattack on the southern suburbs, but was so little successful that he\r\nwithdrew five days later. A terrible tempest destroyed his provision\r\ntrain and devastated his army. These disasters made Edward anxious for\r\npeace, and the negotiations, after two interruptions, were successfully\r\nrenewed at Chartres, and facilitated by the signature of a truce for a\r\nyear. The work of a definitive treaty was pushed forward, and on May 8,\r\npreliminaries of peace were signed between the prince of Wales and\r\nCharles of France at the neighbouring hamlet of Brétigni, whither the\r\npeacemakers had transferred their sittings. There were still formalities\r\nto accomplish which took up many months. King John was escorted in July\r\nby the Prince of Wales to Calais, and in October he was joined by Edward\r\nIII., who had returned to England about the time that the negotiations\r\nat Brétigni were over. The peace took its final form at Calais in\r\nOctober 24, 1360. Next day John was released, and ratified the\r\nconvention as a free man on French soil. This permanent treaty is more\r\nproperly styled the treaty of Calais than the treaty of Brétigni; but\r\nthe alterations between the two were only significant in one particular\r\nrespect. At Calais the English agreed to omit a clause inserted at\r\nBrétigni by which Edward renounced his claims to the French throne, and\r\nJohn his claims over the allegiance of the inhabitants of the ceded\r\ndistricts. As the Calais treaty of October alone had the force of law,\r\nit was a real triumph of French diplomacy to have suppressed so vital a\r\nfeature in the definitive document.[1] Even with this alleviation the\r\nterms were sufficiently humiliating to France. Edward and his heirs were\r\nto receive in perpetuity, \"and in the manner in which the kings of\r\nFrance had held them,\" an ample territory both in southern and northern\r\nFrance. All Aquitaine was henceforth to be English, including Poitou,\r\nSaintonge, Périgord, Angoumois, Limousin, Quercy, Rouergue, Agenais, and\r\nBigorre. The greatest feudatories of these districts, the friendly Count\r\nof Foix as well as the hostile Count of Armagnac, and the Breton\r\npretender to the viscounty of Limoges, were to do homage to Edward for\r\nall their lands within these bounds. Nor was this all. The county of\r\nPonthieu, including Montreuil-sur-mer, was restored to its English\r\nlords, and added to the pale of Calais, which was to include the whole\r\ncounty of Guînes, made up two considerable northern dominions for\r\nEdward. With these cessions were included all adjacent islands, and all\r\nislands held by the English king at that time, so that the Channel\r\nislands were by implication recognised as English.\r\n\r\n    [1] On the importance of this, see the paper of MM.\r\n    Petit-Dutaillis and P. Collier, _La Diplomatie française et le\r\n    Traité de Brétigny_ in _Le Moyen Age_, 2e serie, tome i.\r\n    (1897), pp. 1-35.\r\n\r\nThe ransom of John was fixed at 3,000,000 gold crowns, that is ~500,000\r\nsterling. The vastness of this sum can be realised by remembering that\r\nthe ordinary revenue of the English crown in time of peace did not much\r\nexceed £60,000, while the addition to that of a sum of £150,000\r\ninvolved an effort which only a popular war could dispose Englishmen to\r\nmake. Of this ransom 600,000 crowns were to be paid at once, and the\r\nrest in annual instalments of 400,000 crowns until the whole payment\r\nwas effected. During this period the prisoners from Poitiers, several\r\nof the king's near relatives, a long list of the noblest names in\r\nFrance, and citizens of some of its wealthiest cities, were to remain\r\nas hostages in Edward's hands. As to the Breton succession, Edward and\r\nJohn engaged to do their best to effect a peaceful settlement. If they\r\nfailed in attaining this, the rival claimants were to fight it out\r\namong themselves, England and France remaining neutral. Whichever of\r\nthe two became duke was to do homage to the King of France, and John of\r\nMontfort was, in any case, to be restored to his county of Montfort. A\r\nsimilar care for Edward's friends was shown in the article which\r\npreserved for Philip of Navarre his hereditary domains in Normandy.\r\nForfeitures and outlawries were to be pardoned, and the rights of\r\nprivate persons to be respected. Nevertheless Calais was to remain at\r\nEdward's entire disposal, and the burgesses, dispossessed by him, were\r\nnot to be reinstated. The French renounced their alliance with the\r\nScots, and the English theirs with the Flemings. Time was allowed to\r\ncarry out these complicated stipulations, and, by way of compensating\r\nEdward for the significant omission which has been mentioned, elaborate\r\nprovisions were made for the mutual execution at a later date of\r\ncharters of renunciation, by which Edward abandoned his claim to the\r\nFrench throne and John the over-lordship of the districts yielded to\r\nEdward. These were to be exchanged at Bruges about a year later.\r\n\r\nEngland rejoiced at the conclusion of so brilliant a peace, and laid no\r\nstress on the subtle change in the conditions which made the treaty far\r\nless definitive in reality than in appearance. In France the faithful\r\nflocked to the churches to give thanks for deliverance from the long\r\nanarchy. The perfect courtesy and good feeling which the two kings had\r\nshown to each other gilded the concluding ceremonies with a ray of\r\nchivalry. John was released almost at once, and allowed to retain with\r\nhim in France some of the hostages, including his valiant son Philip,\r\nthe companion of his captivity. John made Edward's peace with Louis of\r\nFlanders, and Edward persuaded John to pardon Charles and Philip of\r\nNavarre. At last the two weary nations looked forward to a long period\r\nof repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE HUNDRED YEARS' WAR FROM THE TREATY OF CALAIS TO THE TRUCE OF\r\nBRUGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was an easier matter to conclude the treaty of Calais than to carry\r\nit out. Troubles followed the release of the French king and the\r\nexpiration of the year during which the two parties were to yield up\r\nthe ceded territory and effect the renunciations of their respective\r\nclaims. John did his best to keep faith in both these matters. He\r\nordered his vassals to submit themselves to their new lord, and\r\nappointed commissioners to hand over the lost provinces to the agents\r\nof the English king. In July, 1361, Sir John Chandos, Edward's\r\nlieutenant in France, received the special mission of taking possession\r\nof the new acquisitions in the name of his master. Chandos' reputation\r\nas a soldier made him acceptable to the French, and being recognised by\r\nthe treaty as lord of Saint-Sauveur in the Côtentin, he was interested\r\nin maintaining good relations between the two realms. He began his work\r\nby taking possession of Poitiers and Poitou, but found that many of the\r\ndescendants of the greedy lords, who, more than a hundred years before,\r\nhad played off Henry III against St. Louis, abandoned the rule of John\r\nwith undisguised reluctance. It was worse with the towns, where\r\nnational sentiment was stronger. La Rochelle held out for months, and,\r\nwhen its notables at last submitted, they declared: \"We will accept the\r\nEnglish with our lips but never with our hearts\". Much patriotic\r\nfeeling was manifested in Quercy. The consuls of Cahors made their\r\nsubmission, weeping and groaning. \"Alas!\" they declared, \"how odious it\r\nis to lose our natural lord, and to pass over to a master we know not.\r\nBut it is not we who abandon the King of France. It is he who, against\r\nour wishes, hands us over, like orphans, to the hands of the stranger.\"\r\nIt was not until two years after the signing of the treaty that Edward\r\nentered into possession of the bulk of the lands granted to him. Even\r\nthen there were districts in Poitou, notably Belleville, which never\r\nbecame English at all. One of the last districts to yield was Rouergue,\r\nwhose count, John of Armagnac, only made his submission under the\r\ncompulsion of irresistible necessity.\r\n\r\nIt was even more difficult to get the English out of the lands which\r\nthe treaty had assigned to the French. These districts were largely\r\nheld by companies of mercenaries, little under Edward's control and\r\nindisposed to yield up the conquests won by their own hands because\r\ntheir nominal lord had thought fit to make a treaty with the French\r\nking. Despite the orders of Edward, the English garrisons in the north\r\nand centre of France flatly refused to surrender their strongholds. In\r\nMaine, Hugh Calveley took Bertrand du Guesclin prisoner when he sought\r\nto receive the submission of his castles, and only released him on\r\npayment of a heavy ransom. In Normandy, Du Guesclin had to buy off\r\nJames Pipe, who dominated all the central district from the fortified\r\nabbey of Cormeilles, and to crush John Jowel in a pitched battle near\r\nLisieux. Even when the castles were surrendered, the garrisons joined\r\nwith each other to establish societies of warriors that now inflicted\r\nterrible woes on France. The exploits of these free companies hardly\r\nbelong to English history, though many of their leaders and a large\r\nproportion of the rank and file were Englishmen. Cruel, fierce, and\r\nuncouth, they still preserved in all military dealings the strict\r\ndiscipline which had taught the English armies the way to victory. The\r\ncombination of the order of a settled host with the rapacity of a gang\r\nof freebooters made them as irresistible as they were destructive.\r\nThough Edward formally repudiated them, it was more than suspected that\r\nthey were secretly playing his game.\r\n\r\nBefore long, this guerilla warfare became consolidated into military\r\noperations on a large scale. Charles of Navarre once more profited by\r\nthe disorder of France to bring himself to the front. In 1361 John had\r\navailed himself of the death of Philip of Rouvres to treat the duchy of\r\nBurgundy as a lapsed fief, and conferred it on his youngest son, Philip\r\nthe Bold. Charles then claimed to be the heir of Burgundy, and while he\r\npersonally directed the forces of disorder in the south, his agents\r\nunited with the English _condottieri_ in Normandy. John Jowel still\r\nheld tight to his Norman conquests, and was, by Edward's direction,\r\nfighting openly for Charles of Navarre. The Captal de Buch, the hero of\r\nPoitiers, hurried from Gascony to protect the Navarrese lands from the\r\ninvasion of Bertrand du Guesclin. On May 16, 1364, the little armies of\r\nthe Captal and the Breton partisan met at Cocherel on the Eure, where\r\nDu Guesclin cleverly won the first important victory gained by the\r\nFrench in the open field during the whole course of the war. The Captal\r\nwas taken prisoner, and the establishment of Du Guesclin in some of\r\nCharles of Navarre's Norman fiefs deprived the intriguer of his\r\nopportunities to do mischief in the north. Charles of Navarre's career\r\nwas not yet over; but henceforth his chief field was his southern\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nThe victorious Du Guesclin turned his attention to his native Brittany,\r\nwhere the war of Blois and Montfort still went on, for Joan of\r\nPenthièvre insisted so strongly upon her rights that the efforts of\r\nEdward and John to end the contest had been without result. In 1362\r\nJohn de Montfort was at last entrusted with the government of Brittany,\r\nand Du Guesclin quitted the service of France for that of Charles of\r\nBlois, that the treaty of 1360 might remain unbroken. But as in the\r\nearly wars, the army of Blois was mainly French, and the host of\r\nMontfort was commanded by the Englishman, John Chandos, and largely\r\nconsisted of English men-at-arms and archers. Calveley, Knowles, and\r\nthe Breton Oliver de Clisson were among the captains of Duke John's\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nThe decisive engagement took place on September 29, 1364, on the\r\nplateau, north of Auray, which is still marked by the church of St.\r\nMichael, erected as a thank-offering by the victor. It was another\r\nPoitiers on a small scale. The Anglo-Breton army held a good defensive\r\nposition, facing northwards, with its back on the town of Auray. The\r\ntroops of Charles of Blois and Du Guesclin advanced to attack them with\r\nmore ardour than discipline or skill. Both sides fought on foot. The\r\nFrench knights had at last learnt to meet the storm of English arrows\r\nby strengthening their armour and by protecting themselves by large\r\nshields. Thus, as at Poitiers, they had little difficulty in making\r\ntheir way up to the enemy's ranks. But their order was confused, and\r\nthey thought of nothing but the fierce delights of the _mêlée_. The\r\nMontfort party showed more intelligence, and Chandos, like the captal\r\nat Poitiers, fell suddenly upon the flank of one of the enemy's\r\ndivisions. This settled the fight; Charles of Blois was slain, Du\r\nGuesclin taken prisoner, and their army utterly scattered. Auray ended\r\nthe war of the Breton succession. Even Joan of Penthièvre was at last\r\nwilling to treat. In 1365 the treaty of Guérande was signed, by which.\r\nMontfort was recognised as John IV. of Brittany, and did homage to the\r\nFrench crown. Joan was consoled by remaining in possession of the\r\ncounty of Penthièvre and the viscounty of Limoges. Practically her\r\ndefeat was an English victory, and Montfort remained in his duchy so\r\nlong only as English influence prevailed. A second step towards the\r\npacification of the north was made when the troubles in Brittany were\r\nended within a few months of the destruction of the power of Charles\r\nthe Bad in Normandy.\r\n\r\nThe free companies lost their chief hunting-grounds; and a further\r\nrelief came when some of them, like the White Company, found a better\r\nmarket for their swords in Italy. With all their faults, the companies\r\nopened out a career to talent such as had seldom been found before. John\r\nHawkwood, the leader of the White Company, was an Essex man of the\r\nsmaller landed class. He had played but a subordinate figure beside\r\nKnowles, Calveley, Pipe, and Jowel; but in Italy he won for himself the\r\nname of the greatest strategist of his age. Thus, though at the cost of\r\nmurder and pillage, the English made themselves talked about all over\r\nthe western world. \"In my youth,\" wrote Petrarch, \"the Britons, whom we\r\ncall Angles or English, had the reputation of being the most timid of\r\nthe barbarians. Now they are the most warlike of peoples. They have\r\noverturned the ancient military glory of the French by a series of\r\nvictories so numerous and unexpected that those, who were not long since\r\ninferior to the wretched Scots, have so crushed by fire and sword the\r\nwhole realm that, on a recent journey, I could hardly persuade myself\r\nthat it was the France that I had seen in former years.\"[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] _Epistolæ Familiares_, iii., Ep. 14, p. 162, ed.\r\n    Fracassetti.\r\n\r\nIt was to little purpose that King John laboured to redeem his plighted\r\nword and make France what it had been before the war. Though in\r\nNovember, 1361, neither he nor Edward sent commissioners to Bruges,\r\nwhere, according to the treaty of Calais, the charters of renunciation\r\nwere to be exchanged, John offered in 1362 to carry out his promise.\r\nEdward, however, for reasons of his own, made no response to his\r\nadvances. The result was that the renunciations were never made, and so\r\nthe essential condition of the original settlement remained\r\nunfulfilled. The matter passed almost unnoticed at the time as a mere\r\nformality, but in later years Edward's lack of faith brought its own\r\npunishment in giving the French king a plausible excuse for still\r\nclaiming suzerainty over the ceded provinces. Perhaps Edward still\r\ncherished the ambition of resuscitating his pretensions to the French\r\ncrown. He found it as hard to give up a claim as ever his grandfather\r\nhad done.\r\n\r\nJohn's good faith was conspicuously evinced by the efforts he made to\r\nraise the instalments of his ransom. His payments were in arrears: some\r\nof the hostages left in free custody by Edward's generosity broke their\r\nparole and escaped; and among them was his own son, Louis, Duke of\r\nAnjou. The father felt it his duty to step into the place thus left\r\nvacant. In 1363 he returned to his English prison, where he died in\r\n1364, surrounded with every courtesy and attention that Edward could\r\nlavish upon him. During the last months of his life, England received\r\nvisits from two other kings, David of Scotland and the Lusignan lord of\r\nCyprus, who still called himself King of Jerusalem, and was wandering\r\nthrough the courts of Europe to stir up interest in the projected\r\ncrusade.\r\n\r\nCharles of Normandy then became Charles V. He was no knight-errant like\r\nhis father, and his diplomatic gifts, tact, and patience made him much\r\nbetter fitted than John for outwitting his English enemies and for\r\nrestoring order to France. Slowly but surely he grappled with the\r\ncompanies, and at last an opening was found for their skill in the\r\ncivil war which broke out in Castile. Peter the Cruel, since 1350 King\r\nof Castile, had made himself odious to many of his subjects. At last\r\nhis bastard brother, Henry of Trastamara, rose in revolt against him.\r\nPeter, however, was capable and energetic, and not without support from\r\ncertain sections of the Castilians. Moreover, he was friendly with\r\nCharles of Navarre, and allied with Edward III. On the other hand Henry\r\nfound powerful backing from the King of Aragon, and made an appeal to\r\nthe King of France. This gave Charles V. the chance he wanted. He hated\r\nPeter, who was reputed to have murdered his own wife, Blanche of\r\nBourbon sister of the Queen of France, and in 1365 he agreed to give\r\nHenry assistance. Du Guesclin welded the scattered companies into an\r\narmy and led them against the Spanish king. The pope fell in with the\r\nscheme as an indirect way of realising his crusading ambition. When\r\nHenry had become King of Castile, the companies would go on to attack\r\nthe Moors of Granada. English and French mercenaries flocked gladly\r\ntogether under Du Guesclin's banner. Edward in vain ordered his\r\nsubjects not to take part in an invasion of the lands of his friend and\r\ncousin, Peter of Castile. Though Chandos declined at the last moment to\r\nfollow Du Guesclin into the peninsula, Sir Hugh Calveley would not\r\ndesist from the quest of fresh adventure, even at the orders of his\r\nlord. Professional and knightly feeling bound Calveley to Du Guesclin\r\nmore closely than their difference of nationality separated them, so\r\nthat Calveley took his part in the Castilian campaign with perfect\r\nloyally to his ancient enemy. In December, 1365, Du Guesclin and his\r\nfollowers made their way through Roussillon and Aragon into Castile.\r\nThe spring of 1366 saw Peter a fugitive in Aquitaine, and Henry of\r\nTrastamara crowned Henry II. of Castile. Most of the companies then\r\nwent home, though Du Guesclin and Calveley remained to support the new\r\nking's throne.\r\n\r\nThe deposed tyrant went to Bordeaux, where since 1363 the Black Prince\r\nhad been resident as Prince of Aquitaine; for in 1362 Edward had erected\r\nhis new possessions into a principality and conferred it on his eldest\r\nson, in the hope of conciliating the Gascons by some pretence of\r\nrestoring their independence. At Bordeaux Peter persuaded the prince to\r\nrestore him to his throne by force. Edward also agreed to support Peter,\r\nand sent his third son, John of Gaunt, to march through Brittany and\r\nPoitou with a powerful English reinforcement to his brother's resources,\r\nwhile the lord of Aquitaine assembled the whole, strength of his new\r\nprincipality for the expedition. At the bidding of his lord, Calveley\r\ncheerfully abandoned Du Guesclin, and thenceforth fought as courageously\r\non the one side as he had previously done on the other. Charles of\r\nNavarre professed great desire to help forward the invaders, and his\r\noffers of friendship opened up to the prince the easiest way into Spain\r\nby way of the pass of Roncesvalles from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port to\r\nPamplona, the capital of Navarre. In February, 1367, the prince's army\r\nmade its way in frost and snow through the valleys famous in romance.\r\nFrom Pamplona two roads diverged to Burgos, the ancient Castilian\r\ncapital. The easier way ran south-westwards through Navarrese territory\r\nto the Ebro at Logroño, where beyond the river lay the Castilian\r\nfrontier. The more difficult route went westwards through rugged\r\nmountains and high valleys by way of Salvatierra and Vitoria to a\r\npassage over the upper Ebro at Miranda. The Black Prince chose the\r\nlatter route, and reached Vitoria in safely. Beyond the town King\r\nHenry's army held a position so strong that Edward found it impossible\r\nto dislodge him.\r\n\r\nThe winter weather still held the upland valleys in its grip when March\r\nwas far advanced. Men and horses suffered terribly from cold and\r\nhunger, and the prince, seeing that he could not long maintain his\r\nposition, boldly resolved to transfer himself to the southern route. A\r\nflank march over snow-clad sierras brought him to the vale of the Ebro,\r\nand, crossing the stream at Logroño, he took up his position a few\r\nmiles south-west of that town, near the Castilian village of Navarrete.\r\nOn the prince's change of front King Henry also moved southward,\r\ncrossing the Ebro a few miles above Logroño, and then advanced to\r\nNájera, a village about six miles west of Navarrete, where he once more\r\nblocked the English path. The prince, however, had the advantage of\r\nposition and could afford to wait until the Castilians attacked. On\r\nApril 3 Henry advanced over the little river Najarilla against the\r\nenemy. The Spanish host fought after a different fashion from that\r\npractised by both sides in the French wars. Only Du Guesclin and the\r\nsmall remnant of the companies which still abode in Spain dismounted.\r\nThe mass of the Castilians remained on their horses. Their cavalry was\r\nof two sorts: besides a large number of men-at-arms bestriding armoured\r\nsteeds, there were swarms of light horsemen, unencumbered by heavy\r\narmour and called _genitours_, from being mounted on the fleet Spanish\r\nsteeds called jennets. The desperate valour of Du Guesclin and his\r\nfollowers could not prevent utter disaster. Henry fled in panic from\r\nthe scene; Du Guesclin was again a prisoner, and the Najarilla was\r\nreddened by the blood of the thousands of fugitive Spaniards, for,\r\ncaught as in a trap at the narrow bridge which offered the _sole_ means\r\nof retreat, they were massacred without difficulty by the prince's\r\ntroops. The victors marched on to Burgos, and, Don Henry having fled to\r\nFrance, Peter was restored with little further trouble to the Castilian\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nThe Black Prince remained in Castile all through the summer, waiting\r\nfor the rewards which Don Peter had promised him. His army melted away\r\nthrough fever and dysentery, and the prince himself contracted the\r\nbeginnings of a mortal disorder. Thus the crowning victory of his\r\ncareer was the last of his triumphs. Like many other leaders of\r\nchivalry, he had not understood the limitations of his resources, and\r\nhad dissipated on this bootless Spanish campaign means scarcely\r\nsufficient to grapple with the spirit of disaffection already\r\nundermining his power in Aquitaine. With shattered health and the mere\r\nskeleton of his gallant army, he made his way back over the Pyrenees.\r\nHenceforth misfortune dogged every step of his career.\r\n\r\nSince 1363 the constant residence of the Black Prince and his wife, Joan\r\nof Kent, in Gascony, had been broken only by his Castilian expedition.\r\nIt was a wise policy to send the prince to hold a permanent court in\r\nAquitaine, such as the land had never seen since Richard Coeur de Lion.\r\nAll that affability, magnificence, and chivalry could do to make his\r\ndomination attractive might be confidently anticipated from so brilliant\r\nand high-minded a knight as the prince of Aquitaine. The court of\r\nBordeaux was as brilliant as the court of Windsor. \"Never,\" boasted the\r\nChandos Herald,[1] \"was such good entertainment as his; for every day at\r\nhis table he had more than four-score knights and four times as many\r\nsquires. There was found all nobleness, merriment, freedom, and honour.\r\nHis subjects loved him, for he did them much good.\" The sulky magnates\r\nof the south-west, such as John of Armagnac and Gaston Phoebus of Foix,\r\nfound their bitterness tempered by the prince's courtesy, while the\r\nboastful knights of Gascony looked forward to a career of honourable\r\nservice under the descendant of their ancient dukes. Feastings and\r\ntournaments were not enough to win all his subjects' hearts; and the\r\nBlack Prince strove with some energy to show that he was a ruler of men\r\nas well as the centre of a court. It is to his credit that he cleared\r\nhis inheritance from the free companies, so that Poitou and Limousin\r\nenjoyed far more prosperity and tranquillity than in the days of French\r\nascendency. Such new taxation as Gascon custom allowed was only levied\r\nafter grants from the three estates. Great pains were taken to improve\r\nthe administration, the judicial system, and the coinage. Edward saw\r\nthat his best policy was to rely upon the people of Gascony, and to look\r\nwith suspicion on the great lords. But he did not understand how limited\r\nwas the authority which tradition gave to the dukes of Aquitaine, and he\r\nwas too stiff, too pedantic, too insular, to get on really cordial terms\r\nwith his subjects. He never, like Gaston Phoebus or Richard Coeur de\r\nLion, threw himself into the local life, language, and traditions of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Le Prince Noir, poème du héraut d'Armes Chandos_, pp.\r\n    107-108, ed. F. Michel.\r\n\r\nThe Black Prince's greatest successes were with the towns, and\r\nespecially with those which had been continuously subject to English\r\nrule. The citizens of Bordeaux, who had feared lest Edward's claim to\r\nthe French crown should involve them in more complete subjection, were\r\nappeased by promises that they should in any case remain subject to the\r\nEnglish monarchy. Their liberties were increased and their wine trade\r\nwas fostered, even to the loss of English merchants. The other towns\r\nwere equally contented. Edward relied upon them as a counterpoise to\r\nthe feudal lords, and their liberties exempted them from the\r\nextraordinary taxes by which he strove to restore the equilibrium of\r\nhis finances. The half-independent magnates were soon convinced that\r\ntheir chivalrous lord was no friend of aristocratic privilege. Edward,\r\neven when using their services in war, carefully excluded them from the\r\nadministration. They saw with disgust the chief offices monopolised by\r\nEnglishmen. An English bishop, John Harewell of Bath, was Edward's\r\nchancellor and confidential adviser. An English knight, Thomas Felton,\r\nwas seneschal of Aquitaine and head of the administration. The\r\nconstableship was assigned to Chandos. The seneschalships of the\r\nseveral provinces were mainly in English hands. With English notions of\r\nthe rights of the supreme power, the prince paid little attention to\r\nthe franchises of either lord or prelate. He mortally offended John of\r\nArmagnac by requiring a direct oath of fealty from the Bishop of Rodez,\r\nwho held all his lands of Armagnac as Count of Rouergue. Clerks of\r\nlesser degree were outraged by the prince's attempts to hinder students\r\nfrom attending the university of Toulouse.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish expedition immensely increased the Black Prince's\r\ndifficulties. He exhausted his finances to equip his army, and both on\r\ntheir coming and going his soldiers cruelly pillaged the country.\r\nEdward now dismissed most of his troops and urged them to betake\r\nthemselves to France. In January, 1368, he obtained from the estates of\r\nAquitaine a new hearth tax of ten _sous_ a hearth for five years. The\r\ntax was freely voted and collected from the great majority of the\r\npayers without trouble. The towns were mainly exempt from it by reason\r\nof their liberties; and the lesser lords were as yet not averse from\r\nEnglish rule. But the greater feudatories saw in the new hearth-tax a\r\npretext for revolt. They had no special zeal for the French monarchy,\r\nbut the house of Valois was weak and far removed from their\r\nterritories. Their great concern was the preservation of their\r\nindependence, which seemed more threatened by a resident prince than by\r\na distant overlord at Paris. Even before the imposition of the\r\nhearth-tax, the Count of Armagnac entered into a secret treaty with\r\nCharles V., who promised to increase his territories and respect his\r\nfranchises, if he would return to the French allegiance. The lord of\r\nAlbret married a sister of the French queen and followed Armagnac's\r\nlead. A little later the Counts of Périgord and Comminges and other\r\nlords associated themselves with this policy. Thus the rule of the\r\nBlack Prince in Aquitaine, acquiesced in by the mass of the people, was\r\nthreatened by a feudal revolt. Armagnac appealed to the parliament of\r\nParis against the hearth-tax. Charles V. accepted the appeal on the\r\nground of the non-exchange of the renunciations which should have\r\nfollowed the treaty of Calais. Cited before the parliament in January,\r\n1369, the Black Prince replied that he would go to Paris with helmet on\r\nhead and with sixty thousand men at his back. His father once more\r\nassumed the title of King of France, and war broke out again.\r\n\r\nThe relative positions of France and England were different from what\r\nthey had been nine years before. Edward III. was sinking into an\r\nunhonoured old age, and the Prince of Aquitaine suffered from dropsy,\r\nand was incapable of taking the field. Of their former comrades some,\r\nlike Walter Manny, were dead, and others too old for much more\r\nfighting. On the other side was Charles V., who had tamed Navarre and\r\nthe feudal lords, had cleared the realm of the companies, had put down\r\nfaction and disorder, and had made himself the head of a strong\r\nnational party, resolved to effect the expulsion of the foreigner. His\r\nchief military counsellors were Du Guesclin, and Du Guesclin's old\r\nadversary in the Breton wars, Oliver de Clisson, now the zealous\r\nservant of the king. A wonderful outburst of French patriotism\r\nfacilitated the reconquest of the lands that had passed to English rule\r\nnine years before. Even the tradition of military superiority availed\r\nlittle against commanders who were learning by their defeats how to\r\nmeet their once invincible enemies.\r\n\r\nThere was a like modification in the foreign alliances of the two\r\nkingdoms. Dynastic changes in the Netherlands had robbed Edward of\r\nsupporters who, though costly and ineffective, had been imposing in\r\noutward appearance. Even after the dissolution of the alliances of the\r\nearly years of the war, the temporising policy of Louis de Male at\r\nleast neutralised the influence of Flanders. During the peace both\r\nEdward and Charles did their best to win the goodwill of the Flemish\r\ncount. Louis' relation to the two rivals was the more important since\r\nhis only child was a daughter named Margaret. In 1356, this lady, to\r\nEdward's great disgust, was promised in marriage to Philip de Rouvre,\r\nDuke and Count of Burgundy, and Count of Artois. The death of Philip in\r\n1361 saved Edward from the danger of a great state with one arm in the\r\nBurgundies and the other in Flanders and Artois; and the irritation of\r\nLouis de Male at Charles V.'s grant of the Burgundian duchy to his\r\nyoungest son, Philip the Bold, gave the English king a new chance of\r\nwinning his favour. At last, in 1364, Edward concluded a treaty with\r\nFlanders according to his dearest wishes. Edmund of Langley, Earl of\r\nCambridge, his youngest son, was betrothed to the widowed Margaret,\r\nwith Ponthieu, Guînes, and Calais as their appanage. Great as were\r\nEdward's sacrifices, they were worth making if a permanent union could\r\nbe established between England and Flanders, equally threatening to\r\nFrance and to the lords of the Netherlands. Charles persuaded Urban V.\r\nto refuse the necessary dispensations for the marriage. Edward and\r\nLouis, irritated at the success of this countermove, waited patiently\r\nand renewed their alliance.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was his understanding with Armagnac completed than Charles\r\nstrove to secure the support of northern as well as of southern\r\nfeudalism against Edward. He offered his brother, Philip of Burgundy,\r\nto Margaret, along with the restoration of the districts of French\r\nFlanders, which he still held. In June, 1369, the marriage took place.\r\nEdmund of Cambridge lost his last chance of the great heiress, and\r\nCharles V. bought off the enmity of the Count of Flanders at the price\r\nof that union of Burgundy and Flanders which, in the next century, was\r\nto make the descendants of Philip and Margaret the most formidable\r\nopponents of the French monarchy. For the moment, however, Charles\r\ngained little. Flemish ships, indeed, fought against the English at\r\nsea, notably in Bourgneuf Bay in 1371, but next year Louis made peace\r\nwith them. Despite his daughter's marriage, the Count of Flanders still\r\nshowed that his sympathies were with England. The other princes of the\r\nNetherlands were much more decidedly on the French side than the Count\r\nof Flanders. Margaret of Hainault, Queen Philippa's sister, had, after\r\nthe death of her husband the Emperor Louis of Bavaria, in 1347 fought\r\nwith her son William for the possession of her three counties of\r\nHainault, Holland, and Zealand, to which Philippa also had pretensions,\r\nnaturally upheld by her husband. William obtained such advantages over\r\nhis mother that Margaret was obliged to invoke the assistance of her\r\nbrother-in-law. Eager to regain his influence in the Netherlands,\r\nEdward willingly agreed to be arbiter between Margaret and her son, and\r\nat his suggestion the disputed lands were divided between them. William\r\nwas married to Maud of Lancaster, Duke Henry's elder daughter, and thus\r\nsecured to the English alliance. On Margaret's death William inherited\r\nall the three counties: but Maud died, and William became insane,\r\nwhereupon his brother and heir invoked the support of the Emperor\r\nCharles IV., and was duly established in his fiefs. The claims of\r\nPhilippa were ignored, and the Lancaster marriage with the lord of\r\nHolland, like the projected union of Edmund with the heiress of\r\nFlanders, failed to fulfil Edward's hopes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Edward had to face the constant hostility of the emperor.\r\nWenceslaus of Luxemburg, brother of Charles IV., had married the\r\ndaughter and heiress of John III of Brabant, with the result of solidly\r\nestablishing the house of Luxemburg in the strongest of the duchies of\r\nthe Low Countries. With the Luxemburger as with the Bavarian, Edward's\r\nrelations were unfriendly. Two only of the Low German lords, the dukes\r\nof Gelderland and Jülich, were willing to take his pay. Early in the\r\nwar they were assailed by the Luxemburgers, and the contest occupied\r\nall their energies. Thus Edward re-entered the struggle against France\r\nwith no help save that of his own subjects. Urban V. died at Avignon in\r\n1370, and his successor, Gregory XI., was as little friendly to English\r\nclaims in France as his predecessors had been. Pope, emperor, and the\r\nNetherlandish princes, were all either French or neutral. And in 1369\r\nPeter of Castile lost his throne, and soon afterwards perished at his\r\nbrother's hands. Henry of Trastamara, henceforth King of Castile,\r\nbecame the firm ally of the French, who had already the support of\r\nAragon. Even Charles the Bad thought it prudent to declare for France.\r\n\r\nAt each stage of the war the French took the initiative. The appeal of\r\nthe southern nobles was the beginning of a national movement which,\r\nbefore March, 1369, was supported by more than 900 towns, castles, and\r\nfortified places in Edward's allegiance. In April the French invaded\r\nPonthieu and were welcomed as deliverers at Abbeville and the other\r\ntowns of the county. John of Gaunt led an army during the summer from\r\nCalais southwards. He marched through Ponthieu, crossed the Somme at\r\nBlanchetaque, and ravaged the country up to the Seine. Then he retired\r\nexhausted, having gained no real advantage by this mere foray. Charles\r\nannounced that, as Edward had supported the free companies, he fell\r\nunder the excommunication threatened by the pope against the abettors\r\nof these pests of society, and that the vassals of the English crown\r\nwere therefore relieved from allegiance to him. Soon afterwards he\r\ndeclared that Edward had forfeited all his possessions in France.\r\n\r\nQuercy and Rouergue, which had submitted last, were the first districts\r\nof Aquitaine to revolt. Cahors declared for France as soon as the Black\r\nPrince was cited to Paris. By the end of 1369 all Quercy had\r\nacknowledged Charles V., and John of Armagnac ruled Rouergue as his\r\nvassal. It was the same in the Garonne valley, where towns which had no\r\nquarrel with English rule, were swept away by the strong tide of\r\nnational feeling that surged round their walls. A systematic attack was\r\nmade upon the English power in Aquitaine. Charles V. fitted out new\r\narmies in which the townsmen and the country-folk fought side by side\r\nwith the nobility. Two of his brothers, John, Duke of Berri, and Louis,\r\nDuke of Anjou, prepared to assail the intruders, Berri in the central\r\nuplands, Anjou in the Garonne valley. It was not enough to recover what\r\nwas lost. Aggression must be met by aggression, and the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, Charles' third brother, equipped a fleet in Norman ports,\r\neither to invade England or at least to cut off the Black Prince from\r\nhis base. Portsmouth was burnt, before England had made any effort to\r\ndefend her shores.\r\n\r\nThe English were strangely inactive. The Black Prince lay sick at\r\nCognac, and of his subordinates Chandos, now seneschal of Poitou, alone\r\nshowed vigour. Chandos, finding the lords of Poitou much more loyal to\r\nthe English connexion than those of the south, was able to take the\r\naggressive by invading Anjou. He was, however, soon recalled to protect\r\nPoitou, and on January 1, 1370, was mortally wounded at the bridge of\r\nLussac. James Audley had already died of disease in another Poitevin\r\ntown. While England was losing her best soldiers, Du Guesclin began a\r\nfresh series of raids in the Garonne valley. Soon the banner of the\r\nlilies waved within a few leagues of Bordeaux, and ancient towns of the\r\nEnglish obedience, like Bazas and Bergerac, fell into the enemy's\r\nhands. With the capture of Périgueux, the Limousin was isolated from\r\nGascon succour. In August the Duke of Berri appeared before the walls\r\nof the _cité,_ or episcopal quarter, of Limoges, and the bishop\r\npromptly handed it over to him.\r\n\r\nDisasters at last stirred up the English to action. In 1370 John of\r\nGaunt was sent with one army to Gascony and Sir Robert Knowles with\r\nanother to Calais. The Black Prince, though unable to ride, was eager\r\nto command. It was arranged that while Lancaster led one force from\r\nBordeaux to Limoges, Edward should accompany another that marched from\r\nCognac towards the same destination. To resist this combination Du\r\nGuesclin strove to combine the separate armies of the Dukes of Anjou\r\nand Berri. However, he failed to prevent the junction of Lancaster and\r\nEdward, and their advance to Limoges. On September 19, the anniversary\r\nof Poitiers, the city of Limoges opened its gates after a five days'\r\nsiege. The English took a terrible revenge. Not a house in the _cité_\r\nwas spared, and the cathedral rose over a mass of ruins. The whole\r\npopulation was put to the sword, the Black Prince in his litter\r\nwatching grimly the execution of his orders. A few gentlemen alone were\r\nsaved for the sake of their ransoms. Among them was the brother of Pope\r\nGregory XI., who not unnaturally became a warm friend of the patriotic\r\nparty. The sack of Limoges was the last exploit of the Black Prince.\r\nEarly in 1371, he returned to England, partly because of his state of\r\nhealth, and partly because he had no money to pay his soldiers. It is\r\nnot unlikely that he was already on bad terms with John of Gaunt, who\r\nhad necessarily taken the chief share in the campaign and was nominated\r\nhis successor. Too late, efforts were made to conciliate the Gascons;\r\nin 1370 a supreme court was set up at Saintes to save the necessity of\r\nappeals to London which had become as onerous as the ancient frequency\r\nof resort to the parliament of Paris; and the hearth-tax, the\r\nostensible cause of the rising, was formally renounced.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Knowles's expedition of 1370 was as futile as that of\r\nLancaster. He advanced from Calais into the heart of northern France.\r\nTaught by long experience the danger of joining battle, the French\r\nallowed him to wander where he would, plundering and ravaging the\r\ncountry. Roughly following the line of march of Edward III. in 1360,\r\nthe English advanced through Artois and Vermandois to Laon and Reims,\r\nand thence southwards through Champagne. Then striking northwards from\r\nthe Burgundian border, they appeared, at the end of September, before\r\nthe southern suburbs of Paris. To dissipate the alarm felt at the\r\npresence of the English, Du Guesclin was summoned from the south and\r\nmade constable of France. Before his arrival Knowles had moved on\r\nwestwards 'towards the Beauce, intending to reach his own estates in\r\nBrittany for winter quarters. But his young captains got out of\r\ncontrol. Led by a Gloucestershire knight, Sir John Minsterworth, \"ready\r\nin hand but deceitful and perverse in mind,\" a considerable section of\r\nthe troops refused to follow the old \"tomb-robber\" to Brittany, and\r\ndetermined to spend the winter where they were, under Minsterworth's\r\nleadership. Knowles would not give place to his subordinate, and made\r\nhis way to Brittany with the part of his army which was still faithful\r\nto him. No sooner was he well started than Du Guesclin, after a march\r\nof ninety miles in three days, fell upon his rearguard at Pontvallain\r\nin southern Maine and overwhelmed it on December 4, 1370. Knowles\r\nmanaged to reach Brittany with the bulk of his forces, and\r\nMinsterworth, the real cause of the disaster, ventured to go to England\r\nand denounce his leader as a traitor. He was forced to flee to France,\r\nwhere he openly joined the enemy. Seven years later he was captured and\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nMinsterworth was not the only traitor. In the earlier part of the war,\r\nthere had fought on the English side a grand-nephew of the last\r\nindependent Prince of Wales, Sir Owen ap Thomas ap Rhodri,[1] whose\r\ngrandfather, Rhodri or Roderick, the youngest brother of the princes\r\nLlewelyn and David, had after the ruin of his house lived obscurely as\r\na small Cheshire and Gloucestershire landlord. In 1365 Owen was in\r\nFrance, engaged, no doubt, in one of the free companies, and on his\r\nfather's death he returned to defend his inheritance from the claims of\r\nthe Charltons of Powys. Having succeeded in this, he returned to\r\nFrance, and nothing more is heard of him until after the renewal of the\r\nwar. In 1370 he appeared as a strenuous partisan of the French. Mindful\r\nof his ancestry he posed as the lawful Prince of Wales, and established\r\ncommunications with his countrymen, both in France and in Wales.\r\nAnxious to stir up discord in Edward's realm, the French king gladly\r\nupheld his claims. A gallant knight and an impulsive, energetic\r\npartisan, Sir Owen of Wales soon won a place of his own in the history\r\nof his time. In Gwynedd he was celebrated as Owain _Lawgoch,_ Owen of\r\nthe Red Hand. Conspiracies in his favour were ruthlessly stamped out,\r\nand a halo of legend and poetry soon encircled his name. In France\r\nCharles entrusted him and another Welshman, named John Wynn, with the\r\nequipment of a fleet at Rouen with which the champion was to descend on\r\nthe principality and excite arising. Bad weather caused the complete\r\ndestruction of the expedition of the Welsh pretender. Two years later,\r\nhowever, another fleet was fitted out on his behalf, and in June, 1372,\r\nOwen took possession of Guernsey.\r\n\r\n    [1] The place of Owen of Wales in history was for the first\r\n    time clearly shown by Mr. Edward Owen in _Y Cymmrodor,_\r\n    1899-1900, pp. 1-105.\r\n\r\nAt that time the fortune of war was strongly in favour of France,\r\nthough the initial successes of Charles V. were damped by the doubtful\r\nresults of the petty struggles which filled the year 1371. During that\r\nyear Du Guesclin, the soul of the French attack, ejected the English\r\nfrom many places in Normandy and Poitou. On the other hand, the English\r\nwon the hard fought battle over a Flemish fleet in Bourgneuf Bay, which\r\nhas already been mentioned. They also showed some power of recovery in\r\nAquitaine, where their recapture of Figeac in upper Quercy gave them a\r\nbase for renewing their attacks on Rouergue. On the whole then, the\r\nyear left matters much as they had been.\r\n\r\nThe occupation of Guernsey by Owen of Wales was the beginning of a new\r\nseries of French victories. Up to that time the northern coastlands of\r\nAquitaine, lower Poitou, Saintonge, and Angoumois had remained almost\r\nentirely under their English lords. In the hope of resisting attack,\r\nthe English projected the invasion of France both from Calais and from\r\nGuienne. To carry out the latter plan John Hastings, Earl of Pembroke,\r\nwas despatched with a fleet and army from England, with a commission to\r\nsucceed John of Gaunt as the king's lieutenant in Aquitaine. The\r\nFranco-Spanish alliance then began to bear its fruits. Henry of\r\nTrastamara equipped a strong Spanish fleet to meet the invaders in the\r\nBay of Biscay. On June 23, 1372, the two fleets fought an action off La\r\nRochelle. The light Spanish galleys out-manoeuvred the heavy English\r\nships, laden deep in the water with stores and filled with troops and\r\nhorses. The Spaniards set on fire some of the English transports, which\r\nbecame unmanageable owing to the fright of the horses embarked upon\r\nthem. The English fought valiantly, and night fell before the battle\r\nwas decided. Next day, the Spaniards attacked again, and won a complete\r\nvictory. The English fleet was destroyed, and Pembroke was taken a\r\nprisoner to Santander.\r\n\r\nThe news of Pembroke's defeat encouraged the French to attempt the\r\nconquest of Poitou. Du Guesclin invaded the county from the north in\r\nco-operation with the Spaniards at sea, Owen of Wales abandoned the\r\nsiege of Cornet castle, in Guernsey, which still held out against him,\r\nand hurried to join the Spaniards. At Santander he met the captive\r\nPembroke, and bitterly reproached the marcher earl with the part his\r\nhouse had taken in driving the Welsh from their lands. In August Owen\r\nand the Spaniards were lying off La Rochelle. Sir Thomas Percy,\r\nseneschal of Poitou, and the Captal de Buch were with a considerable\r\nforce at Soubise, near the mouth of the Charente. Owen ascended the\r\nriver and fell unexpectedly on the English at night. The English were\r\nutterly defeated and both leaders were taken prisoners, Thomas Percy,\r\nthe future ally of Owen Glendower, being captured by one of Sir Owen's\r\nWelsh followers. Meanwhile, Du Guesclin, after receiving the surrender\r\nof Poitiers on August 7, pressed forward to the coast and was soon in\r\ntouch with Owen and the Spaniards. On the same September day Angoulême\r\nand La Rochelle opened their gates to the French. In the course of the\r\nsame month all the other towns of the district declared for the winning\r\nside. The nobles of Poitou were still to some extent English in\r\nsympathy, and a considerable band of them and their followers took\r\nrefuge in Thouars. On December 1 this last stronghold of Poitevin\r\nfeudalism surrendered. The tidings of disaster roused the old English\r\nking to his final martial effort. A fleet was raised and sailed from\r\nSandwich, having on board the king, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of\r\nLancaster, and many other magnates. Contrary winds kept the vessels\r\nnear the English coast, and the vast sums lavished on the equipment of\r\nthe expedition were wasted. In despair the Black Prince surrendered to\r\nhis father his principality of Aquitaine. When the king begged the\r\ncommons for a further war subsidy, he was told that the navy had been\r\nruined by his harsh impressment of seamen, and his refusal to give them\r\npay when detained in port waiting for orders. When the command of the\r\nsea passed to the French and their Spanish allies, all hope of\r\nretaining Aquitaine was lost.\r\n\r\nThe final stages in the ruin of the English power in France need not\r\ndetain us long. Despite his successes, Du Guesclin persevered in his\r\npolicy of wearing down the English by delays and by avoiding pitched\r\nbattles. He turned his attention to Brittany, where Duke John, in\r\ndifficulties with his subjects, had invoked the aid of an English army.\r\nThereupon the Breton barons called the French king to take possession\r\nof the duchy, whose lord was betraying it to the foreigner. The old\r\nparty struggle was at an end: Celtic Brittany joined hands with French\r\nBrittany. Before the end of 1373, Duke John was a fugitive, and only a\r\nfew castles with English garrisons upheld his cause. Of these Brest was\r\nthe most important, and despite the Spaniards and Owen of Wales, the\r\nEnglish were still strong enough at sea to retain possession of the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1373, John of Gaunt marched out of Calais with one of the\r\nstrongest armies with which an English invader had ever entered France.\r\nPursuing a general south-easterly direction, the English pitilessly\r\ndevastated Artois, Picardy, and Champagne. Du Guesclin hastened back\r\nfrom Brittany to command the army engaged in watching Lancaster. He\r\nstill continued his defensive tactics, but gave the enemy little rest.\r\nLancaster was no match for so able a general as the Breton constable.\r\nAt the end of September he moved from Troyes to Sens, and thence pushed\r\ninto Burgundy. Then he turned westwards through the Nivernais and the\r\nBourbonnais, and led his army through the uplands of Auvergne. By the\r\nend of the year he had traversed the Limousin, and made his way to\r\nBordeaux. Half his army had perished of hunger, cold, and in petty\r\nwarfare. The horses had suffered worse than the men, and the baggage\r\ntrain was almost destroyed. Without fighting a battle Du Guesclin had\r\nput the enemy out of action. Experience now showed how useless were the\r\nprolonged plundering raids which ten years before had filled all France\r\nwith terror.\r\n\r\nEven in Gascony Lancaster could not hold his own. After declining\r\nbattle with the Duke of Anjou, he returned to England, leaving Sir\r\nThomas Felton as seneschal. The enemy had penetrated to the very heart\r\nof the old English district. La Réole opened its gates to them;\r\nSaint-Sever, the seat of the Gascon high court, followed its example,\r\nBy 1374 the English duchy was reduced to the coast lands around Bayonne\r\nand Bordeaux. That year the French laid siege to Chandos's castle of\r\nSaint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte. The siege was as long and as elaborately\r\norganised as the great siege of Calais. A ring of _bastilles_ was\r\nerected round the doomed town, and cannon discharged huge balls of\r\nstone against its ramparts. After nearly a year's siege the garrison\r\nagreed to surrender on condition of a heavy payment. With the fall of\r\nthe old home of the Harcourts the English power in Normandy perished.\r\nThere was still, it is true, the influence of Charles of Navarre; but\r\nthat desperate intriguer had compromised himself so much with both\r\nparties that no confidence could be placed in him.\r\n\r\nThe misfortunes of the English inclined them to listen to proposals of\r\npeace. Though the papacy was more frankly on the French side than ever,\r\nit had not lost its ancient solicitude to put an end to the war. With\r\nthat object Gregory XI, though eager to return to Rome, tarried in the\r\nRhone valley. Two of his legates appeared in Champagne at the time of\r\nJohn of Gaunt's abortive expedition. From that moment offers of peace\r\nwere constantly pressed on both sides. Lancaster was at Calais, and\r\nAnjou was not far off at Saint-Omer, when definite proposals were\r\nexchanged. Before long it was found more convenient that the envoys\r\nshould meet face to face, and for this reason the two dukes accepted\r\nthe hospitality of Louis de Male, and held personal interviews at\r\nBruges. More than once the negotiations broke down altogether. At no\r\ntime was there much hope of a permanent peace. The English insisted on\r\nthe terms of 1360, and the French demanded the cession of Calais and\r\nthe release of the unpaid ransom of King John. However, on June 27,\r\n1375, a truce for a year was signed at Bruges, which was further\r\nextended until June, 1377, just long enough to allow the old king to\r\nend his days in peace. France had once more to wrestle with the\r\ncompanies set free by the truce, so that England could still enjoy\r\npossession of Calais, Bordeaux, Bayonne, Brest, and the other scanty\r\nremnants of the cessions of the treaty of Calais. Satisfied at putting\r\nan end to the war, Gregory XI betook himself to Rome. Thus the truce\r\noutlasted the Babylonish captivity of the papacy as well as the life of\r\nEdward III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nENGLAND DURING THE LATTER YEARS OF EDWARD III.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever was Edward's glory so high as in the years immediately succeeding\r\nthe treaty of Calais. The unspeakable misery of France heightened his\r\nmagnificence by the strength of the contrast. At eight-and-forty he\r\nretained the vigour and energy of his younger days, though surrounded\r\nby a band of grown-up sons. In 1362 the king celebrated his jubilee, or\r\nhis fiftieth birthday, amidst feasts of unexampled splendour. Not less\r\nmagnificent were the festivities that attended the visits of the three\r\nkings, of France, Cyprus, and Scotland, in 1364.\r\n\r\nOf the glories of these years we have detailed accounts from an\r\neye-witness a writer competent, above all other men of his time, to set\r\ndown in courtly and happy phrase the wonders that delighted his eyes.\r\nIn 1361, John Froissart, an adventurous young clerk from Valenciennes,\r\nsought out a career for himself in the household of his countrywoman,\r\nQueen Philippa, bearing with him as his credentials a draft of a verse\r\nchronicle which was his first attempt at historical composition. He\r\ncame to England at the right moment. The older generation of historians\r\nhad laid down their pens towards the conclusion of the great war, and\r\nhad left no worthy successors. The new-comer was soon to surpass them,\r\nnot in precision and sobriety, but in wealth of detail, in literary\r\ncharm, and in genial appreciation of the externals of his age. He\r\nrecorded with an eye-witness's precision of colour, though with utter\r\nindifference to exactness, the tournaments and fetes, the banquets and\r\nthe _largesses_ of the noble lords and ladies of the most brilliant\r\ncourt in Christendom. He celebrated the courtesy of the knightly class,\r\ntheir devotion to their word of honour, the liberality with which\r\ncaptive foreigners was allowed to share in their sports and pleasures,\r\nand the implicit loyalty with which nearly all the many captive knights\r\nrepaid the trust placed on their word. To him Edward was the most\r\nglorious of kings, and Philippa, his patroness, the most beautiful,\r\nliberal, pious, and charitable of queens. For nine years he enjoyed the\r\nqueen's bounty, and described with loyal partiality the exploits of\r\nEnglish knights. With the death of his patroness and the beginning of\r\nEngland's misfortunes, the light-minded adventurer sought another\r\nmaster in the French-loving Wenceslaus of Brabant. The first edition of\r\nhis chronicle, compiled when under the spell of the English court,\r\ncontrasts strongly with the second version written at Brussels at the\r\ninstigation of the Luxemburg duke of Brabant.\r\n\r\nEven Froissart saw that all was not well in England. The common people\r\nseemed to him proud, cruel, disloyal, and suspicious. Their delight was\r\nin battle and slaughter, and they hated the foreigner with a fierce\r\nhatred which had no counterpart in the cosmopolitan knightly class.\r\nThey were the terror of their lords and delighted in keeping their\r\nkings under restraint. The Londoners were the most mighty of the\r\nEnglish and could do more than all the rest of England. Other writers\r\ntell the same tale. The same fierce patriotism that Froissart notes\r\nglows through the rude battle songs in which Lawrence Minot sang the\r\nearly victories of Edward from Halidon Hill to the taking of Guînes,\r\nand inspired Geoffrey le Baker to repeat with absolute confidence every\r\nmalicious story which gossip told to the discredit of the French king\r\nand his people. It was under the influence of this spirit that the\r\nsteps were taken, which we have already recorded, to extend the use of\r\nEnglish, notably in the law courts. Yet the old bilingual habit clave\r\nlong to the English. Despite the statute of 1362, the lawyers continued\r\nto employ the French tongue, until it crystallised into the jargon of\r\nthe later _Year Books_ or of Littleton's _Tenures_. Under Edward III,\r\nhowever, French remained the living speech of many Englishmen. John\r\nGower wrote in French the earliest of his long poems. But he is a\r\nthorough Englishman for all that. He writes in French, but, as he says,\r\nhe writes for England.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] \"O gentile Engleterre, a toi j'escrits,\" _Mirour de\r\n    l'Omme,_ in John Gower's _Works,_ i., 378, ed. G.C. MaCaulay,\r\n    to whom belongs the credit of recovering this long lost work.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of the patriotic movement of the reign of Edward\r\nIII, that a new courtly literature in the English language rivalled the\r\nFrench vernacular literature which as yet had by no means ceased to\r\nproduce fruit. The new type begins with the anonymous poems, \"Sir\r\nGawain and the Green Knight,\" and the \"Pearl\". While Froissart was the\r\nchief literary figure at the English court during the ten years after\r\nthe treaty of Calais, his place was occupied in the concluding decade\r\nof the reign by Geoffrey Chaucer, the first great poet of the English\r\nliterary revival. The son of a substantial London vintner, Chaucer\r\nspent his youth as a page in the household of Lionel of Antwerp, from\r\nwhich he was transferred to the service of Edward himself. He took part\r\nin more than one of Edward's French campaigns, and served in diplomatic\r\nmissions to Italy, Flanders, and elsewhere. His early poems reflect the\r\nmodes and metres of the current French tradition in an English dress,\r\nand only reach sustained importance in his lament on the death of the\r\nDuchess Blanche of Lancaster, written about 1370. It is significant\r\nthat the favourite poet of the king's declining years was no clerk but\r\na layman, and that the Tuscan mission of 1373, which perhaps first\r\nintroduced him to the treasures of Italian poetry, was undertaken in\r\nthe king's service. Thorough Englishman as Chaucer was, he had his eyes\r\nopen to every movement of European culture. His higher and later style\r\nbegins with his study of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio. Though he\r\nwrote for Englishmen in their own tongue, his fame was celebrated by\r\nthe French poet, Eustace Deschamps, as the \"great translator\" who had\r\nsown the flowers of French poesy in the realm of Aeneas and Brut the\r\nTrojan. His broad geniality stood in strong contrast to the savage\r\npatriotism of Minot. In becoming national, English vernacular art did\r\nnot become insular. Chaucer wrote in the tongue of the southern\r\nmidlands, the region wherein were situated his native London, the two\r\nuniversities, the habitual residences of the court, the chief seats of\r\nparliaments and councils, and the most frequented marts of commerce.\r\nFor the first time a standard English language came into being, largely\r\ndisplacing for literary purposes the local dialects which had hitherto\r\nbeen the natural vehicles of writing in their respective districts. The\r\nYorkshireman, Wycliffe, the westcountryman, Langland, adopted before\r\nthe end of the reign the tongue of the capital for their literary\r\nlanguage in preference to the speech of their native shires. The\r\nlanguage of the extreme south, the descendant of the tongue of the West\r\nSaxon court, became the dialect of peasants and artisans. That a\r\ncontinuous life was reserved for the idiom of the north country, was\r\ndue to its becoming the speech of a free Scotland, the language in\r\nwhich Barbour, Archdeacon of Aberdeen, commemorated for the court of\r\nthe first Stewart king the exploits of Robert Bruce and the Scottish\r\nwar of independence. The unity of England thus found another notable\r\nexpression in the oneness of the popular speech. And the evolution of\r\nthe northern dialect into the \"Scottish\" of a separate kingdom showed\r\nthat, if England were united, English-speaking Britain remained\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nOther arts indicate the same tendency. Even in the thirteenth century\r\nEnglish Gothic architecture differentiated itself pretty completely from\r\nits models in the Isle de France. The early fourteenth century, the age\r\nof the so-called \"decorated style,\" suggests in some ways a falling back\r\nto the French types, though the prosperity of England and the desolation\r\nof France make the English examples of fourteenth century building the\r\nmore numerous and splendid. The occasional tendency of the later\r\n\"flowing\" decorated towards \"flamboyant\" forms, to be seen in some of\r\nthe churches of Northamptonshire, marks the culminating point of this\r\nfresh approximation of French and English architecture. But the division\r\nbetween the two countries brought about by war was illustrated before\r\nthe end of the reign in the growth of the most local of our medieval\r\narchitectural types, that \"perpendicular\" style which is so strikingly\r\ndifferent from the \"flamboyant\" art of the neighbouring kingdom. This\r\nspecially English style begins early in the reign of Edward III, when\r\nthe cult of the murdered Edward of Carnarvon gave to the monks of St.\r\nPeter's, Gloucester, the means to recast the massive columns and gloomy\r\narcades of the eastern portions of their romanesque abbey church after\r\nthe lighter and brighter patterns in which Gloucester set the fashion to\r\nall southern Britain. In the buildings of the later years of Edward's\r\nreign the old \"flowing decorated\" and the newer and stiffer\r\n\"perpendicular\" grew up side by side. If the two seem almost combined in\r\nthe church of Edington, in Wiltshire, the foundation dedicated in 1361\r\nfor his native village by Edward's chancellor, Bishop Edington of\r\nWinchester, the triumph of the perpendicular is assured in the new choir\r\nwhich Archbishop Thoresby began for York Minster, and in the\r\nreconstruction of the Norman cathedral of Winchester begun by Bishop\r\nEdington, and completed when his greater successor, William of Wykeham,\r\ncarried out in a more drastic way the device already adopted at\r\nGloucester of recasing the ancient structure so as to suit modern\r\ntastes. The full triumph of the new style is apparent in Wykeham's twin\r\nfoundations at Winchester and Oxford. The separation of feeling between\r\nEngland and Scotland is now seen in architecture as well as in language.\r\nWhen the perpendicular fashion was carrying all before it in the\r\nsouthern realm, the Scottish builders erected their churches after the\r\nflamboyant type of their French allies. Thus while the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth century structures of the northern and southern kingdoms are\r\npractically indistinguishable, the differences between the two nations,\r\nwhich had arisen from the Edwardian policy of conquest, expressed\r\nthemselves ultimately in the striking contrast between the flamboyant of\r\nMelrose or St. Giles' and the perpendicular of Winchester or Windsor.\r\n\r\nEnglish patriotism, which had asserted itself in the literature and art\r\nof the people long before it dominated courtly circles, continued to\r\nexpress itself in more popular forms than even those of the poems of\r\nChaucer. The older fashions of instructing the people were still in\r\nvogue in the early part of Edward's reign. Richard Rolle, the hermit of\r\nHampole, whose _Prick_ of _Conscience_ and vernacular paraphrases of\r\nthe Bible illustrate the older didactic literature, was carried off in\r\nhis Yorkshire cell in the year of the Black Death. The cycles of\r\nmiracle plays, which edified and amused the townsfolk of Chester and\r\nYork, crystallised into a permanent shape early in this reign, and were\r\nset forth with ever-increasing elaborateness by an age bent on\r\npageantry and amusement. The vernacular sermons and popular manuals of\r\ndevotion increased in numbers and copiousness. In this the time of the\r\nBlack Death is, as in other aspects of our story, a deep dividing line.\r\n\r\nThe note of increasing strain and stress is fully expressed in the\r\nearlier forms of _The Vision of Piers Plowman,_ which were composed\r\nbefore the death of Edward III. Its author, William Langland, a clerk in\r\nminor orders, debarred by marriage from a clerical career, came from the\r\nMortimer estates in the march of Wales: but his life was mainly spent in\r\nLondon, and he wrote in the tongue of the city of his adoption. The\r\nfirst form of the poem is dated 1362, the year of the second visitation\r\nof the Black Death, while the troubles of the end of the reign perhaps\r\ninspired the fuller edition which saw the light in 1377. It is a\r\ncommonplace to contrast the gloomy pictures drawn by Langland with the\r\nhighly coloured pictures of contemporary society for which Chaucer was\r\ngathering his materials. Yet this contrast may be pressed too far.\r\nThough Langland had a keen eye to those miseries of the poor which are\r\nalways with us, the impression of the time gathered from his writings is\r\nnot so much one of material suffering, as of social unrest and\r\ndiscontent. The poor ploughman, who cannot get meat, still has his\r\ncheese, curds, and cream, his loaf of beans and bran, his leeks and\r\ncabbage, his cow, calf, and cart mare.[1] The very beggar demanded\r\n\"bread of clean wheat\" and \"beer of the best and brownest,\" while the\r\nlandless labourer despised \"night-old cabbage,\" \"penny-ale,\" and bacon,\r\nand asked for fresh meat and fish freshly fried.[2] There is plenty of\r\nrough comfort and coarse enjoyment in the England through which \"Long\r\nWill\" stalked moodily, idle, hopeless, and in himself exemplifying many\r\nof the evils which he condemned. The England of Langland is bitter,\r\ndiscontented, and sullen. It is the popular answer to the class\r\nprejudice and reckless greed of the lords and gentry. Langland's own\r\nattitude towards the more comfortable classes is much that of the\r\nself-assertive and mutinous Londoner whom Froissart looked upon with\r\nsuch bitter prejudice. He boasts that he was loath to do reverence to\r\nlords and ladies, or to those clad in furs with pendants of silver, and\r\nrefuses to greet \"sergeants\" with a \"God save you\". Every class of\r\nsociety is flagellated in his scathing criticisms. He is no\r\nrevolutionist with a new gospel of reform, but, though content to accept\r\nthe old traditions, he is the ruthless denouncer of abuses, and is\r\nthoroughly filled with the spirit which, four years after the second\r\nrecension of his book, found expression in the Peasants Revolt of 1381.\r\nWith all the archaism of his diction and metre, Langland, even more than\r\nChaucer, reflects the modernity of his age.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Vision of Piers Plowman,_ i.,220, ed. Skeat.\r\n\r\n    [2] _Ibid.,_ i., 222.\r\n\r\nEven the universities were growing more national, for the war prevented\r\nOxford students from seeking, after their English graduation, a wider\r\ncareer at Paris. William of Ockham, the last of the great English\r\nschoolmen that won fame in the European rather than in the English\r\nworld, died about 1349 in the service of the Bavarian emperor. In the\r\nsame year the plague swept away Thomas Bradwardine, the \"profound\r\ndoctor,\" at the moment of his elevation to the throne of Canterbury.\r\nBradwardine, though a scholar of universal reputation, won his fame at\r\nOxford without the supplementary course at Paris, and lived all his\r\ncareer in his native land. As an English university career became more\r\nself-sufficient, Oxford became the school of the politician and the man\r\nof affairs as much as of the pure student. The new tendency is\r\nillustrated by the careers of the brothers Stratford, both Oxford\r\nscholars, yet famous not for their writings but for lives devoted to the\r\nservice of the State, though rewarded by the highest offices of the\r\nChurch. His conspicuous position as a teacher of scholastic philosophy\r\nfirst brought John Wycliffe into academic prominence. But he soon won a\r\nwider fame as a preacher in London, an adviser of the court, an opponent\r\nof the \"possessioner\" monks, and of the forsworn friars, who, deserting\r\napostolic poverty, vied with the monks in covetousness. His attacks on\r\npractical abuses in the Church marked him out as a politician as well as\r\na philosopher. His earlier career ended in 1374, the year in which he\r\nfirst became the king's ambassador, not long after proceeding to the\r\ndegree of doctor of divinity.[1] His later struggles must be considered\r\nin the light of the political history of the concluding episodes of\r\nEdward's reign. In a few years we shall find the Oxford champion\r\nabandoning the Latin language of universal culture, and appealing to the\r\npeople in homely English. With Wycliffe's entry upon his wider career,\r\nit is hardly too much to say that Oxford ceased to be merely a part of\r\nthe cosmopolitan training ground of the schoolmen, and became in some\r\nfashion a national institution. Cambridge, too young and obscure in\r\nearlier ages to have rivalled Oxford, first began to enjoy an increasing\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n    [1] This was before Dec. 26, 1373. See Twemlow in _Engl. Hist.\r\n    Review_, xv, (1900), 529-530.\r\n\r\nHitherto culture had been not only cosmopolitan but clerical. Every\r\nuniversity student and nearly every professional man was a clerk. But\r\neducation was becoming possible for laymen, and there were already lay\r\nprofessions outside the clerical caste. The wide cultivation and the\r\nvigorous literary output of laymen of letters like Chaucer and Cower\r\nare sufficient evidence of this. But the best proof is the complete\r\ndifferentiation of the common lawyers from the clergy. The inns of\r\ncourt of London became virtually a legal university, where highly\r\ntrained men studied a juristic system, which was not the less purely\r\nEnglish in spirit because its practitioners used the French tongue as\r\ntheir technical instrument. There were no longer lawyers in England\r\nwho, like Bracton, strove to base the law of the land on the forms and\r\nmethods of Roman jurisprudence. There were no longer kings, like Edward\r\nI., with Italian trained civilians at their court ready to translate\r\nthe law of England into imperialist forms. The canonist still studied\r\nat Oxford or Cambridge, but his career was increasingly clerical, and\r\nthe Church, unlike the State, was unable to nationalise itself, though\r\nthe whole career of Wycliffe and the strenuous efforts of the kings and\r\nstatesmen who passed the statutes of Provisors and Praemunire, showed\r\nthat some of the English clergy, and many of the English laity, were\r\nwilling to make the effort. English law, in divorcing itself from the\r\nuniversities and the clergy, became national as well as lay. There were\r\nno longer any Weylands who concealed their clerical beginnings, and hid\r\naway the subdeacon under the married knight and justice, the founder of\r\na landowning family. The lawyers of Edward's reign were frankly laymen,\r\nmarrying and giving in marriage, establishing new families that became\r\nas noble as any of the decaying baronial houses, and yet cherishing a\r\ncorporate ideal and common spirit as lively and real as those of any\r\nmonastery or clerical association.\r\n\r\nIn enumerating the many convergent tendencies which worked together in\r\nstrengthening the national life, we must not forget the growing\r\nimportance of commerce. Merchant princes like the Poles could rival the\r\nfinancial operations of Lombard or Tuscan, and climb into the baronial\r\nclass. The proud and mutinous temper of the Londoners was largely due\r\nto their ever-increasing wealth. We are on the threshold of the careers\r\nof commercial magnates, like the Philpots and the Whittingtons. Even\r\nwhen Edward III. was still on the throne, a London mayor of no special\r\nnote, John Pyel, could set up in his native Northamptonshire village of\r\nIrthlingborough a college and church of remarkable stateliness and\r\ndignity. The growth of the wool trade, and its gradual transfer to\r\nEnglish hands, the development of the staple system, the rise of an\r\nEnglish seaman class that knew all the havens of Europe, the beginnings\r\nof the English cloth manufacture, all indicate that English commerce\r\nwas not only becoming more extensive, but was gradually emancipating\r\nitself from dependence on the foreigner. Thus before the end of\r\nEdward's reign England was an intensely national state, proudly\r\nconscious of itself, and haughtily contemptuous of the foreigner, with\r\nits own language, literature, style in art, law, universities, and even\r\nthe beginnings of a movement towards the nationalisation of the Church.\r\nThe cosmopolitanism of the earlier Middle Ages was everywhere on the\r\nwane. A modern nation had arisen out of the old world-state and\r\nworld-spirit. In the England of Edward III., Chaucer, and Wycliffe, we\r\nhave reached the consummation of the movement whose first beginnings we\r\nhave traced in the early storms of the reign of Henry III. It is in the\r\ndevelopment of this tendency that the period from 1216 to 1377\r\npossesses such unity as it has.\r\n\r\nDuring the years of peace after the treaty of Calais, Edward III.\r\ncompleted the scheme for the establishment of his family begun with the\r\ngrant of Aquitaine to the Black Prince. The state of the king's\r\nfinances made it impossible for him to provide for numerous sons and\r\ndaughters from the royal exchequer, and the system of appanages had\r\nseldom been popular or successful in England. Edward found an easier\r\nway of endowing his offspring by politic marriages that transferred to\r\nhis sons the endowments and dignities of the great houses, which, in\r\nspite of lavish creations of new earldoms, were steadily dying out in\r\nthe male line. Some of his daughters in the same way were married into\r\nbaronial families whose attachment to the throne would, it was\r\nbelieved, be strengthened by intermarriage with the king's kin; while\r\nothers, wedded to foreign princes, helped to widen the circle of\r\ncontinental alliances on which he never ceased to build large hopes.\r\nCollateral branches of the royal family were pressed into the same\r\nsystem, which was so systematically ordered that it has passed for a\r\nnew departure in English history. This is, however, hardly the case.\r\nMany previous kings, notably Edward I., carried out a policy based upon\r\nsimilar lines, and only less conspicuous by reason of the smaller\r\nnumber of children that they had to provide for. The descendants of\r\nHenry III. and Edward I. in no wise kept true to the monarchical\r\ntradition, but rather gave distinction to the baronial opposition by\r\nennobling it with royal alliances. But the martial and vigorous policy\r\nof Edward III. had at least the effect of reducing to inactivity the\r\ntradition of constitutional opposition which had been the common\r\ncharacteristic of successive generations of the royal house of\r\nLancaster, the chief collateral branch of the royal family. Subsequent\r\nhistory will show that the Edwardian family settlement was as\r\nunsuccessful as that of his grandfather. The alliances which Edward\r\nbuilt up brought neither solidarity to the royal house, nor strength to\r\nthe crown, nor union to the baronage. But the working out of this, as\r\nof so many of the new developments of the later part of Edward's reign,\r\ncan only be seen after his death.\r\n\r\nEdward's eldest son became, as we have seen, Duke of Cornwall, Prince\r\nof Wales, and Earl of Chester even before he received Aquitaine. He was\r\nthe first of the continuous line of English princes of Wales, for\r\nEdward III. never bore that title. The Black Prince's marriage with his\r\ncousin, Joan of Kent, was a love-match, and the estates of his bride\r\nwere scarcely an important consideration to the lord of Wales and\r\nCheshire. Yet the only child of the unlucky Edmund of Woodstock was no\r\nmean heiress, bringing with her the estates of her father's earldom of\r\nKent, besides the inheritance of her mother's family, the Wakes of\r\nLiddell and Lincolnshire. The estates and earldom afterwards passed to\r\nJoan's son by a former husband, and the Holland earls of Kent formed a\r\nminor family connexion which closely supported the throne of Richard of\r\nBordeaux. Though their paternal inheritance was that of Lancashire\r\nsquires, the Hollands won a leading place in the history of the next\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nEdward III.'s second son, William of Hatfield, died in infancy. For his\r\nthird son, Lionel of Antwerp, when still in his childhood, Edward found\r\nthe greatest heiress of her time, Elizabeth, the only daughter of\r\nWilliam de Burgh, the sixth lord of Connaught and third Earl of Ulster,\r\nthe representative of one of the chief Anglo-Norman houses in Ireland.\r\nEven before his marriage, Lionel was made Earl of Ulster, a title sunk\r\nafter 1362 in the novel dignity of the duchy of Clarence. This title was\r\nchosen because Elizabeth de Burgh was a grand-daughter of Elizabeth of\r\nClare, the sister of the last Clare Earl of Gloucester, and a share of\r\nthe Gloucester inheritance passed through her to the young duke. His\r\nmarriage gave Lionel a special relation to Ireland, where, however, his\r\ntwo lordships of Ulster and Connaught were largely in the hands of the\r\nnative septs, and where the royal authority had never won back the\r\nground lost during the vigorous onslaught of Edward Bruce on the English\r\npower. In 1342 the estates of Ireland forwarded to Edward a long\r\nstatement of the shortcomings of the English administration of the\r\nisland.[1] No effective steps were taken to remedy those evils until, in\r\n1361, Edward III. sent Lionel as governor to Ireland, declaring \"that\r\nour Irish dominions have been reduced to such utter devastation and ruin\r\nthat they may be totally lost, if our subjects there are not immediately\r\nsuccoured\". Lionel's most famous achievement was the statute of\r\nKilkenny. This law prohibited the intermixture of the Anglo-Normans in\r\nIreland with the native Irish, which was rapidly undermining the basis\r\nof English rule and confounding Celts and Normans in a nation, ever\r\ndivided indeed against itself, but united against the English. Lionel\r\nwearied of a task beyond his strength. His wife's early death lessened\r\nthe ties which bound him to her land, and he went back to England\r\ndeclaring that he would never return to Ireland if he could help it. His\r\nsuccession as governor by a Fitzgerald showed that the plan of ruling\r\nIreland through England was abandoned by Edward III. in favour of the\r\ncheaper but fatal policy of concealing the weakness of the English power\r\nby combining it with the strength of the strongest of the Anglo-Norman\r\nhouses. Under this faulty system, the statute of Kilkenny became\r\ninoperative almost from its enactment.\r\n\r\n    [1] Cal. of Close, Rolls, 1341-43, pp. 508-16.\r\n\r\nThe widowed Duke of Clarence made a second great marriage. The\r\nVisconti, tyrants of Milan, were willing to pay heavily for the\r\nprivilege of intermarriage with the great reigning families of Europe,\r\nand neither Edward III. nor the French king could resist the temptation\r\nof alliance with a family that was able to endow its daughters so\r\nrichly. Accordingly, the Duke of Clarence became in 1368 the husband of\r\nViolante Visconti, the daughter of Galeazzo, lord of Pavia, and the\r\nniece of Bernabò, signor of Milan, the bitter foe of the Avignon\r\npapacy. Five months later, Lionel was carried away by a sudden\r\nsickness, and thus the Visconti marriage brought little fruit to\r\nEngland. Lionel's only child, Philippa, the offspring of his first\r\nmarriage, was married, just before her father's death, to Edmund\r\nMortimer, Earl of March, great-grandson of the traitor earl beheaded in\r\n1330. Lionel's death added to the vast inheritance of the Mortimers and\r\nJoinvilles the lands and claims of Ulster and Clarence, and so Edward\r\nIII.'s magnanimity in reviving the earldom of March after the disgrace\r\nof 1330 was rewarded by the devolution of its estates to his\r\ngrand-daughter's child. The Earl of March was invested with a new\r\npolitical importance, for his wife was the nearest representative of\r\nEdward III, save for the dying Black Prince and his sickly son. The\r\nfierce blood and broad estates of the great marcher family continued to\r\ngive importance to Philippa's descendants; and finally the house of\r\nMortimer mounted the throne in the person of Edward IV.\r\n\r\nThe estates of Lancaster were annexed to the reigning branch of the\r\nroyal house by the marriage in 1359 of John of Gaunt, Edward's third\r\nsurviving son, with Blanche of Lancaster, the heiress of Duke Henry,\r\nwho became, after her sister Maud's death, the sole inheritor of the\r\nduchy of Lancaster. In 1362 John, who had hitherto been Earl of\r\nRichmond, yielded up this dignity to the younger John of Montfort, its\r\nrightful heir, and was created Duke of Lancaster at the same time that\r\nLionel was made Duke of Clarence. Ten years after her marriage Blanche\r\ndied, leaving John a son, Henry of Derby, the future Henry IV., whose\r\nwedding, after his grandfather's death, to one of the Bohun\r\nco-heiresses brought part of the estates of another great house within\r\nthe grasp of Edward III.'s descendants. Moreover, the other Bohun\r\nco-heiress became in 1376 the wife of Thomas of Woodstock, the youngest\r\nof Edward's sons, the Gloucester of the next reign. The three Bohun\r\nearldoms of Hereford, Essex, and Northampton were thus absorbed by the\r\nold king's children and grandchildren. John of Gaunt, like Lionel, lost\r\nhis wife early and sought a second bride abroad. In 1372 he married\r\nConstance of Castile, a natural daughter of the deceased Peter the\r\nCruel. Henceforth he was summoned to parliament as King of Castile and\r\nLeon as well as Duke of Lancaster, though it was not until the next\r\nreign that he took any actual steps to assert his claim.\r\n\r\nJohn's next younger brother, Edmund of Langley, Earl of Cambridge in\r\n136% [1368?] married Isabella, Constance of Castile's younger sister.\r\nHe was the future Duke of York, and as the only one of Edward III.'s\r\nsons who did not marry an English heiress, was the most scantily\r\nendowed of them all. The union of his descendants with those of Lionel\r\nof Clarence gave the house of York a territorial importance which was,\r\nas we have seen, mainly derived from the Mortimer inheritance. Thus the\r\ntwo lines of descendants of Edward III. which had most future\r\nsignificance were those which represented through heiresses the rival\r\nhouses of Lancaster and March. The history of the next century shows\r\nthat the rivalry was only made more formidable by the connexion of both\r\nthese lines with the royal family. In this, the most striking triumph\r\nof the Edwardian policy, is also the most signal indication of its\r\nfailure. From it arose the factions of York and Lancaster.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of the years of peace, from 1360 to 1369, is largely\r\nanti-papal and economic, and is so intimately connected with the laws\r\nof the preceding period that it has been dealt with in an earlier\r\nchapter. But however anti-papal, and therefore anti-clerical, some of\r\nEdward's laws were, his government was still mainly controlled by great\r\necclesiastical statesmen. Simon Langham, though a Benedictine monk, had\r\nas chancellor demanded in 1366 the opinion of the estates as to the\r\nunlawfulness of the Roman tribute, and the clerical estate, if it did\r\nnot help forward the anti-Roman legislation, was content to stand\r\naside, and let it take effect without protest. Shortly after taking\r\npart in the movement against papal tribute, Langham was removed from\r\nthe see of Ely to that of Canterbury in succession to Islip. His\r\nconversion into a purely monastic college of his predecessor's mixed\r\nfoundation for seculars and regulars in Canterbury Hall, Oxford, showed\r\na bias which might have been expected in a former abbot of Westminster,\r\nwhile his willingness to follow in the footsteps of Kilwardby, and\r\nexchange his archbishopric for the dignity of a cardinal and residence\r\nat Avignon showed that he was a papalist as well as an English patriot.\r\nHis successor as primate, appointed in 1369 by papal provision, was\r\nWilliam Whittlesea, a nephew of Archbishop Islip, whose weak health and\r\ncolourless character made of little account his five years' tenure of\r\nthe metropolitical dignity. With Canterbury in such feeble hands, the\r\nleadership in the Church and primacy in the councils of the crown\r\npassed to stronger men: such as John Thoresby, Archbishop of York till\r\n1373; Thomas Brantingham, treasurer from 1369 to 1371, and Bishop of\r\nExeter from 1370 to 1394; and above all to Edward's old servant,\r\nWilliam of Wykeham, chancellor from 1367 to 1371, and Bishop of\r\nWinchester, in succession to Edington, from 1367 until 1404. Wykeham\r\nwas a strenuous and hard-working servant of the crown, a vigorous and\r\ncareful ruler of his diocese, a mighty pluralist, a magnificent\r\nbuilder, and the most bountiful and original of all the pious founders\r\nof his age. \"Everything,\" says Froissart, \"was done through him and\r\nwithout him nothing was done.\"[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] Froissart, _Chroniques_, ed. Luce, viii., 101.\r\n\r\nThe year of the breach of the treaty of Calais was also marked by the\r\nthird great visitation of the Black Death, and the death of Queen\r\nPhilippa. Parliament cordially welcomed the resumption by Edward of the\r\ntitle of King of France, and made liberal subsidies for the prosecution\r\nof the campaign. Disappointment was all the more bitter when each\r\ncampaign ended in disaster, and in the parliament of February, 1371, the\r\nstorm burst. The circumstances of the ministerial crisis of 1341 were\r\nalmost exactly renewed. As on the previous occasion, the state was in\r\nthe hands of great ecclesiastics, whose conservative methods were\r\nthought inadequate for circumstances so perilous. John Hastings, second\r\nEarl of Pembroke of his house, a gallant young warrior and the intended\r\nson-in-law of the king, made himself the spokesman of the anti-clerical\r\ncourtiers, probably with the good-will of the king. At Pembroke's\r\ninstigation the earls, barons, and commons drew up a petition that,\r\n\"inasmuch as the government of the realm has long been in the hands of\r\nthe men of Holy Church, who in no case can be brought to account for\r\ntheir acts, whereby great mischief has happened in times past and may\r\nhappen in times to come, may it therefore please the king that laymen of\r\nhis own realm be elected to replace them, and that none but laymen\r\nhenceforth be chancellor, treasurer, barons of the exchequer, clerk of\r\nprivy seal, or other great officers of the realm \".[1] Edward fell in\r\nwith this request. Wykeham quitted the chancery, and Brantingham the\r\ntreasury. Of their lay successors the new chancellor, Sir Robert Thorpe,\r\nchief-justice of the court of common pleas, was a close friend of the\r\nEarl of Pembroke, while the new treasurer, Sir Richard le Scrope of\r\nBolton, a Yorkshire warrior, represented the interests of John of Gaunt,\r\nwhose long absences abroad did not prevent his ultimately becoming a\r\nstrong supporter of the lay policy. A subsidy of £50,000 and a statute\r\nthat no new tax should be laid on wool without parliamentary assent\r\nconcluded the work of this parliament.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Rot. Pad._, ii., 304.\r\n\r\nThe lay ministers did not prove as efficient as their clerical\r\npredecessors. Want of acquaintance with administrative routine led them\r\nto assess the parliamentary grant so badly that an irregular\r\nreassembling of part of the estates was necessary, when it was found\r\nthat the ministers had ludicrously over-estimated the number of\r\nparishes in England among which the grant of £50,000 had been equally\r\ndivided. Meanwhile the French war was proceeding worse than before.\r\nThorpe died in 1372, and another lay chief-justice, Sir John Knyvett,\r\nsucceeded him in the chancery. Pembroke, as we have seen, was taken\r\nprisoner to Santander within a few weeks of Thorpe's death. Fresh\r\ntaxation was made necessary by every fresh defeat, and the clergy, who\r\nlooked upon the misfortunes of the anti-clerical earl as God's\r\npunishment for his enmity to Holy Church, had their revenge against\r\ntheir lawyer supplanters, for the parliament of 1372 petitioned that\r\nlawyers, who used their position in parliament to advance their\r\nclients' affairs, should not be eligible for election as knights of the\r\nshire. Next year, the discontent of the estates came to a head after\r\nthe failure of John of Gaunt's march from Calais to Bordeaux. The\r\ncommons, by that time definitely organised as an independent house,\r\nanswered the demand for fresh supplies by requesting the lords to\r\nappoint a committee of their number to confer with them on the state of\r\nthe realm. The composition of the committee was not one that favoured\r\nthe existing administration, and, guided by men like William of\r\nWykeham, it made only a limited and conditional grant, which was\r\nstrictly appropriated to the payment of the expenses of the war. The\r\nanti-clerical party was still strong enough to send up denunciations of\r\npapal assumptions, and the anxiety to adjust the relations between the\r\npapacy and the crown led to some abortive negotiations with the legates\r\nof Gregory XI at Bruges in 1374, which were mainly memorable for the\r\nappearance of John Wycliffe as one of the royal commissioners. Disgust\r\nat the attitude of the commons may well have postponed the next\r\nparliament for nearly three years. But the truce of Bruges made\r\nfrequent parliaments less necessary.\r\n\r\nThe truce brought John of Gaunt back to England, and the rivalry\r\nbetween him and his elder brother, which had begun during their last\r\njoint campaigns in France, crystallised into definite parties the\r\ndiscordant tendencies that had been well marked since the crisis of\r\n1371. The old king was a mere pawn in the game. His health had been\r\nbroken by the debauchery and frivolity to which he had abandoned\r\nhimself after the death of Queen Philippa. He was now entirely under\r\nthe influence of Alice Perrers, a Hertfordshire squire's daughter,\r\nwhose venality, greed, and shamelessness made her the fit tool for the\r\nself-seeking ring of courtiers. John of Gaunt sought her support as the\r\nbest means of withdrawing the old king from the influence of the Prince\r\nof Wales, and the lay ministers were glad to maintain themselves in\r\ntheir tottering power by means of such powerful allies. Prominent among\r\ntheir party were courtier nobles--such as the chamberlain, Lord\r\nLatimer, and the steward of the household, Lord Neville of Raby,--and\r\nrich London financiers, chief among whom was Richard Lyons, men who\r\nmade exorbitant profits out of the necessities of the administration.\r\nFaction sought to appear more respectable by professions of zeal for\r\nreform. The cry against papal encroachments was extended to a\r\ndenunciation of the wealth and power of the clergy. John Wycliffe was\r\ncalled from his Oxford classrooms to expound the close connexion\r\nbetween dominion and grace, and to teach from London pulpits that the\r\nungodly bishop or priest has no right to the temporal possessions given\r\nhim on trust for the discharge of his high mission.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] Until recently all historians have dated the beginning of\r\n    Wycliffe's political career from 1366, but J. Loserth has\r\n    proved that 1374, the date of the last demand for the Roman\r\n    tribute, to be the right year. See his _Studien zur\r\n    Kirchen-politik Englands im 14ten Jahrhundert_, in\r\n    _Sitzungsberichte der Académie der Wissenschaften in Wien_,\r\n    philos. histor. classe, cxxxvi., 1897, and, more briefly, in\r\n    _Engl. Hist. Review, xi._ (1896), 319-328.\r\n\r\nA vigorous opposition to the dominant faction was formed. At its head\r\nwas the Black Prince. Hardly less important and much more active than\r\nthe dying hero of Poitiers was Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, the\r\nhusband of Philippa of Clarence, and the father of the little Roger\r\nMortimer whom nothing but the uncertain lives of the Prince of Wales\r\nand the sickly Richard of Bordeaux separated from the English throne.\r\nHereditary antagonism accentuated incompatibility of personal\r\ninterests. The ancient feuds of the houses of Mortimer and Lancaster\r\nstill lived on in the hostility of their representatives. The\r\nunderstanding between the Prince of Wales and the Earl of March seems\r\nto have been complete. They had as their most powerful supporters the\r\noutraged dignitaries of the Church, who saw themselves kept out of\r\noffice and threatened in their temporalities by the dominant faction.\r\nWilliam of Wykeham, who had been the guardian of the Earl of March\r\nduring his long minority, was the most experienced and wary of the\r\nclerical opposition to the lawyers and courtiers of the Lancaster\r\nfaction. He had an eager and enthusiastic backer in the young and\r\nhigh-born Bishop of London, William Courtenay, the son of the Earl of\r\nDevon, and through his mother, Margaret Bohun, a great-grandson of\r\nEdward I. Office and descent combined to make Bishop Courtenay the\r\ncustodian of the constitutional tradition, which was equally strong\r\namong the great baronial houses of ancient descent and such highly\r\nplaced ecclesiastics as were zealous for the nation as well as for\r\ntheir order. His support was the more necessary since Simon of Sudbury,\r\nwho in 1375 succeeded Whittlesea on the throne of St. Augustine, was a\r\nweak and time-serving politician.\r\n\r\nThe storm, which had long been brewing, burst at last in the parliament\r\nof April, 1376. Of the acts of this memorable assembly, famous as the\r\nGood Parliament, and of the other concluding troubles of the reign we\r\nare fortunate in possessing not only copious official records, but a\r\nminute and highly dramatic account from the pen of a St. Alban's monk,\r\nwho, alone of the monastic chroniclers of his age, represented the\r\nspirit which, in the days of Matthew Paris, made the great\r\nHertfordshire abbey so famous a school of historiography.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] _Chron. Angliæ_, 1328-88, ed. E.M. Thompson (Rolls Ser.).\r\n    Compare Mr. S. Armitage-Smith's _John of Gaunt_ for an\r\n    unfavourable estimate of its value.\r\n\r\nThe Good Parliament showed from the beginning a strong animosity\r\nagainst the courtiers. The time was not yet come when the commons could\r\ntake the initiative, or supply leaders from its own ranks, and even\r\namong the commons capacity was unequally divided. Authority and\r\ninfluence were exclusively with the knights of the shire, and the\r\ncitizens and burgesses were content to allow the country gentry to\r\nspeak and act in their name. The knights of the shire demanded that, in\r\naccordance with the precedent of 1373, a committee of magnates should\r\nbe associated with them in determining the policy to be adopted. The\r\nlords spiritual and temporal were as eager as the knights to attack the\r\ngovernment, and a committee, of which the leading spirits included the\r\nEarl of March and the Bishop of London, supplied the element of\r\ndirection and initiation in which the commons were lacking. The\r\nresolution which prevailed was shown by the estates agreeing to make no\r\ngrant until grievances had been redressed, and by the choice of Sir\r\nPeter de la Mare as spokesman of the commons before the king. Sir Peter\r\nwas elected, we are told, because he possessed abundant wisdom and\r\neloquence, and enough boldness to say what was in his mind, regardless\r\nof the good-will of the great. Perhaps a further and more weighty\r\nreason was that he was steward of the Earl of March. He was the first\r\nperson to hold an office indistinguishable in all essentials from that\r\nof the later Speaker. Under his guidance the commons worked out an\r\nelaborate policy of revenge and reform. The contempt with which John of\r\nGaunt and the courtiers had at first regarded their action, gave place\r\nto fear. The duke found it prudent to stand aside, while a clean sweep\r\nof the administration was made.\r\n\r\nCharges were brought against the leading ministers of state, after a\r\nfashion in which the constitutional historian sees the beginnings of\r\nthe process of the removal of great offenders by impeachment. Lord\r\nLatimer was the first victim. He had appropriated the king's money to\r\nhis own uses; he had shown remissness and treachery during the last\r\ncampaign in Brittany; he had taken bribes; he was, in a word, \"useless\r\nto king and kingdom\". His fate was promptly shared by Lyons, the London\r\nmerchant, the accomplice of his frauds, who had availed himself of his\r\ncourt influence to make a \"corner\" in nearly all imported articles, to\r\nthe impoverishment of the common people and the disorganisation of\r\ntrade. Lord Neville, whose eager partisanship of Latimer had led him to\r\ninsult Sir Peter de la Mare, was threatened with similar proceedings.\r\nEven Alice Perrers was attacked, though, says the chronicler, the\r\nnatural affection of Englishmen for their king was so great that they\r\nwere slow to molest the lady whom the king loved. However, Alice's\r\nunblushing interference with the course of justice, her appearance in\r\nthe courts at Westminster, sitting on the judges' bench, clamouring for\r\nthe condemnation of her enemies and the acquittal of her friends,\r\nroused the knights of the shire to action. An ordinance against women\r\nbeing allowed to practise in the law courts was made the pretext for\r\nher removal from court, and Alice, fearful that worse might happen,\r\ntook oath that she would have no further dealings with the king.\r\nMeantime Latimer and Lyons were condemned to forfeiture and\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these proceedings the knights lost their strongest\r\nsupport by the death of the Black Prince on June 8. John of Gaunt at\r\nonce went down to the house of commons, and boldly suggested that the\r\nEnglish should follow the example of the French and allow no woman to\r\nbecome heiress of the kingdom. This was a direct assertion of his own\r\nclaims to stand next to the throne after Richard of Bordeaux, and\r\nbefore Roger Mortimer. Alarmed at the blow thus levelled against their\r\nchief remaining champion, the knights courageously held to their\r\nposition. \"The king,\" said they, \"though old is still healthy, and may\r\noutlive us all. Moreover he has an heir in the ten-year-old prince\r\nRichard. While these are alive there is no need to discuss the question\r\nof the succession.\" They completed the drawing up of the long list of\r\npetitions, whose grudging and partial acceptance by the crown made the\r\nroll of the parliament of 1376 memorable as asserting principles, if\r\nnot as vindicating practical ends. They forced Lancaster to agree to a\r\ncouncil of twelve peers nominated in parliament to act as a standing\r\ncommittee of advisers, without which the king might do nothing of any\r\nimportance. After this revival of the methods of the Mad Parliament and\r\nthe lords ordainers, the Good Parliament separated on July 6. It had\r\nsat longer than any previous parliament of which there is record. It\r\nhad persevered to the end in the teeth of discouragements of all kinds,\r\nand, even after his brother's death, Duke John dared not lift up his\r\nhand against it so long as the session continued.\r\n\r\nWhen the estates separated Lancaster threw off the mask. The king, sunk\r\nin extreme dotage, was entirely in the hands of his unscrupulous son.\r\nThe old man was kept quiet by the return of Alice Perrers to court. She\r\nhad sworn on the rood never to see the king again, but the prelates\r\nwere \"like dumb dogs unable to bark\" against her; and no effort was\r\nmade to prosecute her for perjury. Latimer and Lyons returned from\r\ntheir luxurious imprisonment in the Tower to their places at court. The\r\nduke roundly declared that the late parliament was no parliament at\r\nall. No statute was based upon its petitions, the council of twelve was\r\nrudely dissolved, and Sir Peter de la Mare was imprisoned in Nottingham\r\ncastle. William of Wykeham was deprived of his temporalities, and the\r\nrumour spread that his disgrace was due to his possession of a state\r\nsecret, revealed to him by the dying queen Philippa, that John of Gaunt\r\nwas no true son of the royal pair but a changeling. So timid was the\r\ndisgraced bishop that he vied with the weak primate in his subserviency\r\nto Alice. The Earl of March, who was marshal of England, was ordered to\r\ninspect the fortresses beyond sea, whereupon, fearing a plot to\r\nassassinate him, he resigned his office, \"preferring,\" says a friend,\r\n\"to lose his marshal's staff rather than his life\". The powerful\r\nnorth-country lord, Henry Percy, who had hitherto acted with the\r\nopposition, was bribed by the office of marshal to join the Lancastrian\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nGrave difficulties still beset the government, and in January, 1377,\r\nJohn of Gaunt had to face another parliament. Every precaution was taken\r\nto pack the commons with his partisans. Of the knights of the shire of\r\nthe Good Parliament only eight were members of its successor,[1] while\r\nin the place of the imprisoned De la Mare, Sir Thomas Hungerford,\r\nsteward of the Duke of Lancaster, was chosen Speaker, on this occasion\r\nby that very name. A packed committee of lords was assigned to advise\r\nthe commons. In these circumstances it was not difficult to procure the\r\nreversal of the acts against Alice Perrers and Latimer, and the grant of\r\na poll tax of a groat a head. The only measure of conciliation was a\r\ngeneral pardon, a pretext for which was found in the jubilee of the\r\nking's accession. From this William of Wykeham was expressly excepted.\r\n\r\n    [1] _Return of Members of Parliament_, pt. i., 193-97; _Chron.\r\n    Angliæ_, p. 112, understates the case.\r\n\r\nThe convocation of Canterbury proved less accommodating than the\r\nparliament. Under the able leadership of Bishop Courtenay, it took up\r\nthe cause of the Bishop of Winchester, refused to join in a grant of\r\nmoney until he had taken his place in convocation, and, triumphing at\r\nlast over the time-serving of Sudbury and the hesitation of Wykeham\r\nhimself, persuaded the bishop to join their deliberations. Lancaster met\r\nthe opposition of convocation by calling to his aid the Oxford doctor\r\nwhom the clergy had already begun to look upon as the enemy of the\r\nprivileges of their order. Wycliffe was not as yet under suspicion of\r\ndirect dogmatic heresy. He had not yet clothed himself in the armour of\r\nhis Balliol predecessor, Fitzralph, to wage war against the mendicant\r\norders. But he had already formulated his theory that dominion was\r\nfounded on grace, had declared that the pope had no right to\r\nexcommunicate any one, or if he had that any simple priest could absolve\r\nthe culprit from his sentence, and he had shown a hatred so bitter of\r\nclerical worldliness and clerical property that he was looked upon as\r\nthe special enemy of the great land-holding prelates and of the\r\n\"possessioner\" monks, whose lands, he maintained, could be resumed by\r\nthe representatives of the donors at their will. The strenuous advocate\r\nfor reducing the clergy to apostolic poverty was not likely to find\r\nfavour among the prelates. Wycliffe's only clerical supporters at this\r\nstage were the mendicant friars, from whose characteristic opinions as\r\nregards \"evangelical poverty\" he never at any time swerved.[1] He was,\r\nhowever, eloquent and zealous, and he had a following. Fear either of\r\nWycliffe or of his mendicant allies forced the bishops to take decisive\r\naction. Even Sudbury awoke, \"as from deep sleep\".[2] The duke's\r\ndangerous supporter was summoned to answer before the bishops at St.\r\nPaul's.\r\n\r\n    [1] Shirley (preface to _Fasciculi Zizaniorum,_ Rolls Ser., p.\r\n    xxvi.) thought that Wycliffe was \"the sworn foe of the\r\n    mendicants\" in 1377, and E.M. Thompson's emphatic words\r\n    repudiating the contrary statement of the St. Alban's writer,\r\n    _Chron. Anglice,_ p. liii., illustrate the view prevalent in\r\n    England in 1874. Lechler's _Wiclif und die Vorgeschichte der\r\n    Reformation,_ published in 1873 proves that it was not until\r\n    Wycliffe denied the doctrine of transubstantiation in 1379 or\r\n    1380 that the friars deserted him.\r\n\r\n    [2] _Chron. Anglice_, p. 117.\r\n\r\nOn February 19, Wycliffe appeared in Courtenay's cathedral. Four\r\nmendicant doctors of divinity, chosen by Lancaster, came with him to\r\ndefend him against the \"possessioners,\" while the Duke of Lancaster\r\nhimself, and Henry Percy, the new marshal, also accompanied him to\r\noverawe the bishops by their authority. The court was to be held in the\r\nlady chapel at the east end of the cathedral, and Wycliffe and his\r\nfriends found some difficulty in making their way through the dense\r\ncrowd that filled the spacious nave and aisles. Percy, irritated at the\r\npressure of the throng, began to force it back in virtue of his office.\r\nCourtenay ordered that the marshal should exercise no authority in his\r\ncathedral. Thereupon Percy in a rage declared that he would act as\r\nmarshal in the church, whether the bishop liked it or not. When the\r\nlady chapel was reached, there was further disputing as to whether\r\nWycliffe should sit or stand, and Lancaster taunted Courtenay for\r\ntrusting overmuch to the greatness of his family. When the bishop\r\nreplied with equal spirit, John muttered: \"I would liefer drag him out\r\nof his church by the hair of his head than put up with such insolence\".\r\nThe words were overheard, and the Londoners, who hated the duke, broke\r\ninto open riot at this insult to their bishop. It was rumoured that the\r\nduke had come to St. Paul's, hot from an attack on the liberties of the\r\ncity that very morning in parliament. The court broke up in wild\r\nconfusion, and the riot spread from church to city. Next day Percy's\r\nhouse was pillaged, and John's palace of the Savoy attacked. The duke\r\nand the marshal were forced to seek the protection of their opponent,\r\nthe Princess of Wales, at Kennington. The followers of Lancaster could\r\nonly escape rough treatment by hiding away their lord's badges. The\r\ncitizens cried that the Bishop of Winchester and Peter de la Mare\r\nshould have a fair trial. At last the personal authority of Bishop\r\nCourtenay restored his unruly flock to order. The old king performed\r\nhis last public act by soothing the spokesmen of the citizens with the\r\npleasant words and easy grace of which he still was master. The\r\nPrincess of Wales used her influence for peace, and matters were\r\nsmoothed over.\r\n\r\nAt some risk of personal humiliation, Lancaster secured a substantial\r\ntriumph. Convocation followed the lead of parliament and gave an ample\r\nsubsidy. William of Wykeham purchased the restoration of his\r\ntemporalities by an unworthy deference to Alice Perrers. Wycliffe\r\nremained powerful, flattered, and consulted, though his enemies had\r\nalready drawn up secret articles against him, which they had forwarded\r\nto the papal _curia_. Perhaps in the rapidly declining health of the\r\nking all parties saw that their real interest lay in the postponement\r\nof a crisis.\r\n\r\nIn June Edward lay on his deathbed at Sheen. To the last his talk was\r\nall of hawking and hunting, and his mistress carefully kept from him\r\nall knowledge of his desperate condition. When he sank into his last\r\nlethargy, his courtiers deserted him, and Alice Perrers took to flight\r\nafter robbing him of the very rings on his fingers. A simple priest,\r\nbrought to the bedside by pity, performed for the half-conscious king\r\nthe last offices of religion. Edward was just able to kiss the cross\r\nand murmur \"Jesus have mercy\". On June 21, 1377, he breathed his last.\r\n\r\nWith Edward's death we break off a narrative whose course is but half\r\nrun. John of Gaunt's rule was not over; Wycliffe was advancing from\r\ndiscontent to revolt; Chaucer was yet to rise for a higher flight;\r\nLangland had not yet put his complaint into its permanent form; the\r\nFrench war was renewed almost on the day of Edward's death; popular\r\nirritation against bad government, and social and economic repression\r\nwere still preparing for the revolt of 1381. With all its defects the\r\nage of Edward is preeminently a strong age. Greedy, self-seeking,\r\nrough, and violent it may be; its passions and rivalries combined to\r\nmake futile the exercise of its strength; it sounded the revolutionary\r\nnote of all abrupt ages of transition, and it ends in disaster and\r\ndemoralisation at home and abroad. But government is not everything,\r\nand least of all in the Middle Ages when what was then thought vigorous\r\ngovernment appears miserably weak to modern notions. The strong rule\r\ndecayed with the failure of the king's personal vigour. The ministers\r\nof Edward's dotage could not hold France nor even keep England quiet.\r\nEngland had grown impatient of the rule of a despot, though she was not\r\nyet able to govern herself after a constitutional fashion. It is in the\r\nincompatibility of the political ideals of royal authority and\r\nconstitutional control, not less than in the want of purpose of her\r\nruler and in the factions of her nobles that the explanation of the\r\nperiod must be sought. The age of Edward III. has been alternatively\r\ndecried and exalted. Both verdicts are true, but neither contains the\r\nwhole truth. The explanation of both is to be found in the annals of a\r\nlater age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nON AUTHORITIES.\r\n\r\n(1216-1377.)\r\n\r\nOur two main sources of knowledge for medieval history are records and\r\nchronicles. Chronicles are more accessible, easier to study, more\r\ncontinuous, readable, and coloured than records can generally be. Yet\r\nthe record far excels the chronicle in scope, authority, and\r\nobjectivity, and a prime characteristic of modern research is the\r\nincreasing reliance on the record rather than the chronicle as the\r\nsounder basis of historical investigation. The medieval archives of\r\nEngland, now mainly collected in the Public Record Office, are\r\nunrivalled by those of any other country. From the accession of Henry\r\nIII. several of the more important classes of records have become\r\ncopious and continuous, while in the course of the reign nearly all the\r\nchief groups of documents have made a beginning. The whole of the\r\nperiod 1216 to 1377 can therefore be well studied in them.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of our archives is taken up with common forms,\r\ntechnicalities, and petty detail. It will never be either possible or\r\ndesirable to print the mass of them _in extenso_, and most of the\r\nefforts made to render them accessible have taken the form of\r\ncalendars, catalogues, and inventories. Such attempts began with the\r\ncostly and unsatisfactory labours of the Record Commission (dissolved\r\nin 1836); and in recent years the work has again been taken up and\r\npursued on better lines. The folio volumes of the Record Commission\r\nonly remain so far of value as they have not been superseded by the\r\nmore scholarly octavo calendars which are now being issued under the\r\ndirection of the deputy-keeper of the records. These latter are all\r\naccompanied by copious indices which, though not always to be trusted\r\nimplicitly, immensely facilitate the use of them. The records were\r\npreserved by the various royal courts. Of special importance for the\r\npolitical historian are the records of the Chancery and Exchequer.\r\n\r\nProminent among the Chancery records are the PATENT ROLLS, strips of\r\nparchment sewn together continuously for each regnal year, whereon are\r\ninscribed copies of the letters patent of the sovereign, so called\r\nbecause they were sent out open, with the great seal pendent. Beginning\r\nin 1200, they present a continuous series throughout all our period,\r\nexcept for 23 and 24 Henry III. The publication of the complete Latin\r\ntext of the _Patent Rolls of Henry III._ is now in progress, and two\r\nvolumes have been issued, including respectively the years 1216-1225\r\nand 1225-1232. From the accession of Edward I. onwards the bulk of the\r\nrolls renders the method of a calendar in English more desirable. The\r\n_Calendars of the Patent Rolls_ are now complete from 1272 to 1324 and\r\nfrom 1327 to 1348 (Edward I., 4 vols.; Edward II., 4 vols.; Edward\r\nIII., 7 vols.). For the years not thus yet dealt with the\r\nunsatisfactory _Calendarium Rotulorum Patentium_ (1802, fol.) may still\r\nsometimes be of service.\r\n\r\nThe letters close, or sealed letters addressed to individuals, usually\r\nof inferior public interest to the letters patent are preserved in the\r\nCLOSE ROLLS, compiled in the same fashion as the Patent Rolls. The\r\nwhole extant rolls from 1204 to 1227 are printed in _Rotuli Literarum\r\nClausarum_ (2 vols. fol., 1833 and 1844, Rec. corn.), and it is\r\nproposed to continue the integral publication of the text for the rest\r\nof Henry III.'s reign on the same plan as that of the Patent Rolls. One\r\nvolume of this continuation, 1227-1231 (8vo, 1902), has been issued.\r\nFor the subsequent periods a calendar in English is being prepared\r\nsimilar in type to the _Calendar of Patent Rolls_. The periods at\r\npresent covered by the _Calendar of Close Rolls_ (1892-1905) are,\r\nEdward I., 1272-1296 (3 vols.): Edward II., the whole of the reign (4\r\nvols.), and Edward III., 1327-1349 (8 vols.).\r\n\r\nA third series of records preserved by the Chancery officials is the\r\nROLLS OF PARLIAMENT, including the petitions, pleas, and other\r\nparliamentary proceedings. None of these are extant before 1278, and\r\nthe series for the succeeding century is often interrupted. Many of\r\nthem are printed in the first two folios (vol. i., Edward I. and II.;\r\nvol. ii., Edward III.) of _Rotuli Parliamentorum_ (1767-1777). A\r\ncopious index volume was issued in 1832. A specimen of what may still\r\nbe looked for is to be found in Professor Maitland's edition of one of\r\nthe earliest rolls of parliament in _Memoranda de Parliamento_ (1305)\r\n(Rolls series, 1893) with an admirable introduction. For the reigns of\r\nEdward I. and II. the deficiencies of the published rolls are\r\nsupplemented by SIR F. PALGRAVE'S _Parliamentary Writs and Writs of\r\nMilitary Service_ (vol. i., 1827, Edward I.; vol. ii., 1834, Edward\r\nII., fol., Rec. Corn.) with alphabetical digests and indices.\r\n\r\nFormal grants under the great seal called _Charters_, characterised by\r\na \"salutation\" clause, the names of attesting witnesses, and, under\r\nHenry III. after 1227, by the final formula _data per manum nostram\r\napud_, etc., and implying normally the presence of the king, are\r\ncontained in the CHARTER ROLLS, extant from the reign of John onwards.\r\nThey are roughly analysed in the _Calendarium Rotulorum Chartarum_\r\n(1803, Rec. Com.); and the _Rotuli Chartarum_ (fol., 1837, Rec. Corn.)\r\ncontains the rolls _in extenso_ up to 1216, Vol. i., 1226-1257, of an\r\nEnglish _Calendar of Charter Rolls_, printing some of the documents in\r\nfull, was published in 1903.\r\n\r\nThe documents formerly known as ESCHEAT ROLLS, or INQUISITIONES POST\r\nMORTEM, are concerned with the inquiries made by the Crown on the death\r\nof every landholder as to the extent and character of his holding. Some\r\nof the information contained in these inquests was made accessible in\r\nthe _Calendarium Inquisitionum sive Eschætarum_ (vol. i., Henry III.,\r\nEdward I. and II., 1806; vol. ii., Edward III., 1808, fol., Rec.\r\nCorn.). The errors and omissions of these volumes were partially\r\nremedied for the reigns of Henry III. and Edward I. by C. ROBERTS'S\r\n_Calendarium Genealogicum_ (2 vols. 8vo, 1865). A scholarly guide to\r\nall this class of documents has been begun in the new _Calendar of\r\nInquisitions Post Mortem and other Analogous Documents_, of which vol.\r\ni. (Henry III.) was issued in 1904. The first volume of a separate list\r\nof the analogous inquisitions _Ad pod damnum_ is also announced.\r\n\r\nOf the FINE ROLLS containing the records of fines[1] made with the Crown\r\nfor licence to alienate, exemption from service, wardships, pardons,\r\netc., those of Henry III. have been made accessible in C. ROBERTS'S\r\n_Excerpta e Rotulis Finium_, 1216-1272 (1835-36, 8vo). Other rolls such\r\nas the LIBERATE ROLLS have not yet been published for the reigns here\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\n    [1] A _fine_ in this technical sense is an agreement arrived at\r\n    by a money transaction.\r\n\r\nOf special or local rolls, preserved in the Chancery, the most\r\nimportant for our period are the GASCON ROLLS. The earlier documents\r\ncalled by this name are not exclusively concerned with the affairs of\r\nGascony; they are miscellaneous documents enrolled for convenience in\r\ncommon parchments by reason of the presence of the king in his\r\nAquitanian dominions. Of these are F. MICHEL'S _Roles Gascons_, vol.\r\ni., published in the French government series of _Documents Inédits sur\r\nl'Histoire de France_ (1885), including a \"fragmentum rotuli\r\nVasconiæ,\" 1242-1243, and \"patentes littere facte in Wasconia,\"\r\n1253-1254, years in which Henry III. was actually in Gascony. This\r\npublication was resumed in 1896 by M. CHARLES BÉMONT'S _Supplément_ to\r\nMichel's imperfect volume, containing innumerable corrections, an\r\nindex, introduction, and some additional rolls of 1254 and 1259-1260.\r\nThe later of these, the roll of Edward's delegated administration, is\r\nthe first exclusively devoted to the concerns of Gascony. \"Gascon\r\nRolls\" in this later sense begin with Edward I.'s accession, and M.\r\nBémont has undertaken their publication for the whole of Edward's reign\r\nfrom photographs of the records supplied by the English to the French\r\ngovernment. In 1900 vol. ii. of the _Roles Gascons,_ containing the\r\nyears 1273-1290, was issued. Other classes of Chancery Rolls accessible\r\nin print are _Rotuli Scotiæ,_ 1291-1516 (2 vols., 1814-1819, Rec.\r\nCorn.), and _Rotuli Walliæ_, 5-9 Edward I., privately printed by Sir\r\nThomas Phillipps (1865). Among isolated Chancery records the _Rotuli\r\nHundredorum_ (Rec. Corn., 2 vols. fol., 1812-1818), containing the very\r\nimportant inquests made by Edward I.'s commissioners into the\r\nfranchises of the barons, may specially be noticed here.\r\n\r\nOf not less importance than the Chancery records are those handed down\r\nfrom the Court of Exchequer. The most famous of these, the PIPE ROLLS,\r\nwhich, unlike the Chancery Enrolments, were \"filed\" or sewn skin by\r\nskin, are decreasingly important from the thirteenth century onwards as\r\ncompared with their value for the twelfth. For this reason the Pipe\r\nRoll Society, founded in 1883, only undertook their publication up to\r\n1200. Fragments of Pipe Rolls for our period can be seen in print in\r\nvarious local histories and transactions, as e.g., \"Pipe Rolls of\r\nNorthumberland\" up to 1272 in HODGSON-HINDE'S History of\r\nNorthumberland, pt. iii., vol. iii., and 1273-1284, ed. Dickson\r\n(Newcastle, 1854-60), and of Notts and Derby (translated extracts) in\r\nYEATMAN's _History of Derby_ (1886). The only gap in our series is for\r\nHenry III. Of other Exchequer records we may mention: (i) the\r\nORIGINALIA ROLLS, containing the estreats or documents from the\r\nChancery informing the Exchequer of moneys due to it, beginning in 20\r\nHenry III., a summary of which is published in _Rotulorum Originalium_\r\nin Curia _Scaccarii Abbreviatio,_ 20 Henry III,-51 Edward III (2 vols.\r\nfol., Rec. Corn., 1805-1810); (2) the MEMORANDA ROLLS, containing\r\nrecords of charges upon the Exchequer, etc., are complete for this\r\nperiod. They were kept by the king's and the treasurer's remembrancer,\r\nand are illustrated in print by extracts from the Memoranda Rolls,\r\n1297, in _Transactions of the Royal Hist. Soc.,_ new series, iii.,\r\n281-291(1886), and by the roll of 3 Henry III. in COOPER'S _Proceedings\r\nof the Record Commissioners_ (1833); (3) MINISTERS ACCOUNTS, i.e.,\r\naccounts of royal bailiffs, etc., for royal manors, etc., not included\r\nin the sheriffs' accounts, beginning with Edward I., of which a list is\r\ngiven in the _P.R.O. Lists and Indexes_, Nos. v. and viii.; (4) of the\r\nPELL RECORDS, recording issues and payments, samples given in DEVON'S\r\n_Issues of the Exchequer_ (Rec. Corn., 8vo, 1837), DEVON'S _Issue Roll\r\nof Thomas of Brantingham in_ 1370 (Rec. Corn., 8vo, 1835). The pells of\r\nreceipt were entered on the (5) RECEIPT ROLLS, specimens of which,\r\nalong with the corresponding issues, are to be found in SIR JAMES\r\nRAMSAY'S abstracts of issue and receipt rolls for certain years of\r\nEdward III. in the _Antiquary_(1880-1888); (6) SUBSIDY ROLLS of various\r\ntypes, illustrated by _Nonarum Inquisitiones tempore Edwardi ZZZ._\r\n(Rec. Corn., 1807), the record of a subsidy of a ninth collected by\r\nEdward III. in 1340-1341; (7) WARDROBE and HOUSEHOLD ACCOUNTS\r\ncontaining for the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries information on\r\nnational as well as private royal finance; specimens in print include\r\nthe important _Liber Quotidianus Contra-rotulatoris Garderobæ_, 28\r\n_Ed. I._(1299-1300), (1787, Soc. Antiq.).\r\n\r\nFrom the Exchequer records come also the following: (1) _Testa de\r\nNeville sive Liber Feodorum temp. Hen. ZZZ. et Edw. I._ (Rec. Corn.,\r\nfol., 1807), a miscellaneous and ill-digested but valuable collection of\r\nthirteenth century inquisitions; (2) _Nomina Villarum, g_ Ed. II.,\r\npublished in PALGRAVE'S _Parl. Writs_, ii., iii., 301-416; (3)\r\n_Kirkby's Quest, a_ survey made by Bishop Kirkby, the treasurer, in\r\n1284-85, of which the Yorkshire portion has been printed by the Surtees\r\nSoc., ea. Skaife (1867), and other portions elsewhere; (4) _Taxatio\r\nEcclesiastica Angliæ et Walliæ_, 1291 (Rec. Corn., 1802), the\r\ntaxation of benefices by Nicholas IV. by which assessments of papal and\r\necclesiastical taxes were long made. A very useful compilation,\r\nrecently undertaken under the direction of the deputy-keeper, is\r\n_Inquisitions and Assessments relating to Feudal Aids_, 1284-1431, of\r\nwhich three volumes, dealing in alphabetical order with the shires from\r\nBedford to Norfolk, are published Cheshire and Durham are entirely\r\nomitted and Lancashire very scantily dealt with as exceptional\r\njurisdictions. The work is based upon the various lay records\r\nenumerated above and other analogous inquests. Ancient compilations of\r\nmiscellaneous documents by officials of the Exchequer are exemplified\r\nin _Liber Niger Scaccarii_ (ed. Hearne, 2 vols., 1774), and in the _Red\r\nBook of the Exchequer_ (ed. H. Hall, 3 vols., Rolls ser., 1896).\r\n\r\nThe records of the common law courts, the King's Bench and the Court of\r\nCommon Pleas, are of less direct historical value than those of the\r\nChancery and the Exchequer. Extraordinarily bulky, they require a good\r\ndeal of sifting to sort the wheat from the chaff. As yet a very small\r\nproportion of them has been printed, and few have even been calendared.\r\nA brief index of them has been compiled in the useful _List of Plea\r\nRolls_ (1894, _P.R.O. Lists and Indexes_, No. iv.). Of the various\r\ntypes of these records the FEET OF FINES have been largely used by the\r\ntopographer and genealogist, and the feet of fines for many counties\r\nduring this period have been calendared, summarised, excerpted, and\r\nprinted, wholly or in part, by local archaeological societies, as for\r\nexample, W. FARRER'S _Lancashire Final Concords till 1307_ (Rec. Soc.\r\nfor Lancashire and Cheshire, 1899), and many others. The PLEA ROLLS are\r\nof wider importance. For the days of Henry III. _Placita Coram Rege_\r\n(_i.e._, of the King's Bench) and the _Placita de Banco_ (_i.e._, of\r\nthe Common Pleas in later phrase) are classified as _Rotuli Curiæ\r\nRegis_, while the rolls of the local eyres for the same period are\r\ncalled _Assize Rolls_. Separate series for each court begin with Edward\r\nI. Specimens of most of these types have been printed. _Placitorum\r\nAbbreviatio Ric. I.--Edw. II._ (Rec. Com., fol., 1811) is a careless\r\nseventeenth century abstract. _Placita de Quo Warranto_, Edward I. to\r\nEdward III. (Rec. Com., fol., 1818), is a record of local eyres of\r\nparticular importance for the reign of Edward I. as the corollary of\r\nthe Hundred Rolls and the attack on the local franchises. HUNTER'S\r\n_Rotuli Selecti_ (Rec. Com., 1834) contains pleas of the reign of Henry\r\nIII. A typical year's pleadings of the King's Bench for 1297 is given\r\nin full in PHILLIMORE's _Placita coram rege_, 25 Edward I. (1898,\r\nBritish Rec. Soc.). Selections from the proceedings of the commission\r\nappointed by Edward I. in 1289 to hear complaints against judges and\r\nofficials will shortly be published by Miss Hilda Johnstone and myself\r\nfor the Royal Historical Society. Of special importance are the plea\r\nrolls issued by the Selden Society, which include for our period F.W.\r\nMAITLAND'S _Select Pleas of the Crown_, 1200-1225; BAILDON'S _Select\r\nChancery Pleas_, 1364-1471; J.M. RIGG'S _Select Pleas of the Jewish\r\nExchequer_; and G.J. TURNER'S _Select Pleas of the Forest_; all have\r\ntranslations and introductions, of which those of Professor Maitland\r\nare of exceptional value.\r\n\r\nTo these types must be added the records of the local courts, now\r\nlargely also in the Public Record Office, though vast numbers of court\r\nrolls and manorial documents are still in private hands, and among the\r\narchives of ecclesiastical and secular corporations. The Selden Society\r\nhas done excellent work in publishing such muniments; as in particular,\r\nMAITLAND'S _Select Pleas in Manorial Courts_, vol. i., Henry III. and\r\nEdward I., illustrating the social and legal life of a medieval\r\nvillage; MAITLAND and BAILDON'S _Court Baron_; HUNTER' s _Leet\r\nJurisdiction of Norwich_; C. GROSS's _Select Cases from the Coroners'\r\nRolls_, 1265-1413. The records of the Bishopric of Durham, the County\r\nPalatine of Chester, the Principality of Wales, and the Duchy of\r\nLancaster are deposited in the Public Record Office, and calendars and\r\nlists scattered over the _Deputy-Keeper of the Records' Reports_ throw\r\nsome light on their contents. Unluckily these records of franchise are\r\nincompletely preserved and often in bad condition. The best preserved\r\nfor our period are the Durham records, described in LAPSLEY'S County\r\n_Palatine of Durham_, pp. 327-337 (Harvard Historical Studies); some of\r\nthe most important are printed in _Registrum Palatinum Dunelmense_, ed.\r\nHardy (Rolls Series, 4 vols.), which is also an Episcopal register.\r\nWelsh records may be illustrated by the _Record of Carnarvon_ (Rec.\r\nCorn., fol., 1838). Academic records are illustrated by the Oxford\r\n_Munimenta Academica_ (ed. Anstey), Rolls Series. Municipal records are\r\nvery numerous and important; full particulars as to them can be found\r\nin C. Gross's _Bibliography of British Municipal History_ (Harvard\r\nHist. Studies). Admirably edited examples of our wealth of municipal\r\nrecords for this period are to be found in _Records of the Borough of\r\nNottingham_ (ed. W.H. Stevenson), vol. i. (1882); _Records of the\r\nBorough of Leicester_ (ed. Mary Bateson), vols. i. and ii. (1899 and\r\n1901); and _Munimenta Gildhallæ Londoniensis_ (ed. H.T. Riley), Rolls\r\nSeries. The _Reports of the Historical Manuscripts Commission_ afford\r\nmuch information as to every type of document in private or local\r\ncustody. Ireland and Scotland have archives of their own; but there are\r\nno systematic records in the Register House at Edinburgh before the War\r\nof Independence. Among the enterprises now abandoned of the Public\r\nRecord Office were _Calendars of Documents relating to Scotland and\r\nIreland_. The Scottish series covers all this period (vols. i.-iv.),\r\nthe Irish was stopped at 1307. They are derived, by a rather arbitrary\r\nselection, from various classes of English records, but contain much\r\nvaluable material. JOSEPH STEVENSON'S _Documents illustrating the\r\nHistory of Scotland_ (1286-1306) (Scot. Rec. Publications, 1870), and\r\nPALGRAVE'S Documents _and Records illustrating the History of Scotland_\r\n(Rec. Corn., 1837), are useful for the reign of Edward I. as are for\r\nlimited periods of it the _Wallace Papers_ (Maitland Club, 1841) and\r\n_Scotland in 1298_ (ed. Gough, 1888).\r\n\r\nA new class of records begins in the thirteenth century with BISHOPS'\r\nREGISTERS. These, so far as they survive, are preserved in the diocesan\r\nregistries. Of printed registers for this period the most important is\r\nMARTIN'S _Registrum Epistolarum J. Peckham_ (3 vols., Rolls Series,\r\n1882-1886), the earliest surviving Canterbury register. Other registers\r\nprinted or calendared are HINGESTON-RANDOLPH'S _Exeter Registers_,\r\n1257-1291, 1307-1326, and 1327-1369 (5 vols., 1889, etc.); excerpts,\r\nparticularly from the York registers, in RAINE'S _Letters from the\r\nNorthern Registers,_ Rolls Series; the two oldest York _Registers_ of\r\nARCHBISHOPS WALTER GREY (1215-1255) and WALTER GIFFARD (1266-1279),\r\nboth in Surtees Society; the Wells _Registers_ of BPS. DROKENSFORD,\r\n1309-1329, and RALPH OF SHREWSBURY, 1329-1363 (Somerset Record\r\nSociety); the Worcester _Register_ of BP. GIFFARD, 1268-1302 (Worcester\r\nHistorical Society); the Winchester _Registers_ of BISHOPS SANDALE and\r\nRIGAUD, 1316-1323, and WYKEHAM, 1366-1404 (Hampshire Record Society). A\r\nsociety called the Canterbury and York Society has recently been\r\nstarted to set forth episcopal registers systematically in print. It\r\nhas begun to publish the earliest Lincoln _Register_ extant, that of\r\nHugh of Wells, bishop of Lincoln, 1209-1235, whose _Liber Antiquus de\r\nOrdinatione Vicariorum_ was printed in 1888. Analogous documents are\r\nLUARD'S _Rob. Grosseteste Epistola_ (Roll Series, 1861), and the like.\r\n\r\nMonastic CARTULARIES are less important for general history in this\r\nthan in previous periods; large masses of monastic records of this age\r\nhave survived, not a tithe of which is to be found in DUGDALE'S\r\n_Monasticon_. Some monastic records illustrate the domestic economy or\r\nreligious life of the house as KIRK'S _Accounts of the Obedientiaries\r\nof Abingdon,_ 1322-1479 (Camden Soc.); J.W. CLARK's _Observances in use\r\nat Barnwell Priory,_ 1295-1296(1897), and the like.\r\n\r\nFor this period by far the most important series of foreign records is\r\nthe magnificent collections of the papacy. A summary of many of these\r\nis to be found in BLISS, JOHNSON, and TWEMLOW's _Calendars of Papal\r\nRegisters illustrating the History of Great Britain and Ireland; Papal\r\nLetters_ (vols. i.-iv., 1198-1404), and _Petitions to the Pope_ (vol.\r\ni., 1342-1419), of special importance for the fourteenth century. These\r\nuseful calendars, however, do not always dispense us from consulting\r\nthe grand series of papal records published or analysed under the care\r\nof the French School of Rome, which has not yet sufficiently been\r\nstudied in this country. This enterprise is divided into two sections.\r\nIn the first the _Registers from Gregory IX. to Benedict XI._ are in\r\ncourse of publication; in the second the letters of the Avignon popes\r\nrelating to France are printed or analysed. Portions of the letters of\r\nJohn XXII, Benedict XII, and Clement VI, are already issued. PRESSUTI\r\nhas published one volume of the _Registers of Honorius III_ (1888).\r\nFrom the Vatican archives also comes THEINER'S _Vetera Monumenta Hib.\r\net Scot. Historiam illustrantia_ (1864), beginning in 1216.\r\n\r\nExtracts from various archives are found in such collections as RYMER's\r\n_Foedera_ of which the Record Commission's edition in folio reaches\r\njust beyond the end of this period; WILKINS'S _Concilia_ (1737),\r\ncontaining many extracts from episcopal registers and canons of\r\ncouncils; HADDAN and STUBBS'S _Councils_, vol. i. (for the thirteenth\r\ncentury Welsh Church); CHAMPOLLION-FIGEAC'S _Lettres des Rois et des\r\nReines d'Angleterre_ (2 vols., 1847, _Doc. Inédits_); STUBBS'S _Select\r\nCharters_ (Henry III. and Edward I.), and BÉMONT'S excellent _Chartes\r\ndes Libertés anglaises_ in the _Collection de Textes pour l'Étude et\r\nl'Enseignement de l'Histoire_. Equally useful is COSNEAU'S _Grands\r\nTraités de la Guerre de Cent Ans_ also in the same _Collection de\r\nTextes_. The _Statutes of the Realm_ (vol. i., fol., 1810) contains the\r\ntext of the laws and of the great charters of this period.\r\n\r\nChronicles, with all their deficiencies, must ever be largely used as\r\nsources of continuous historical narrative. For the thirteenth century\r\nour chief reliance must still be placed upon the annals drawn up in\r\nvarious monasteries, some based upon little more than gossip or\r\nhearsay, others showing real efforts to acquire authentic information.\r\nThe greatest centre of historical composition in thirteenth-century\r\nEngland was the Abbey of St. Alban's, whose chronicles form so\r\nimportant a series that they may appropriately be considered as a\r\nwhole, before the other chroniclers are dealt with in approximately\r\nchronological order. The fame of St. Alban's as a school of history had\r\nits origin in the order of Abbot Simon (d. 1183) that the house should\r\nalways appoint a special historiographer. The first of these whose work\r\nis now extant is ROGER OF WENDOVER (d. 1236), whose _Flores\r\nHistoriarum_ (ed. H.O. Coxe, Engl. Hist. Soc., 1842, or ed. Hewlett,\r\nRolls Series, 1886-89--this latter edition is unscholarly) becomes\r\noriginal in 1216 and remains a chief source, copious and interesting,\r\nif not always precise, until 1235. On Wendover's death, MATTHEW PARIS,\r\nwho took the monastic habit in 1217, became the official St. Alban's\r\nchronicler. His great work, the _Chronica Majora_, is, up to 1235,\r\nlittle more than an expansion and embellishment of Wendover. He\r\nre-edited Wendover's work with a patriotic and anti-curialist bias\r\nquite alien to the spirit of the earlier writer, whose version should\r\npreferably be followed. Paris's book is a first-hand source from 1235\r\nto 1259. The narrative of the years 1254-1259 is considerably later in\r\ncomposition to the history of the period 1235-1253, since on reaching\r\n1253 Paris devoted himself to an abridgment of what he had already\r\nwritten, called the _Historia Minor_. On completing this he resumed his\r\nearlier book, and carried it on to the eve of his death in 1259, though\r\nhe did not live to complete its final revision; that was the work of\r\nanother monk who added a picture of his death-bed. The _Chronica\r\nMajora_ has been excellently edited by Dr. H.R. Luard in seven volumes\r\nfor the Rolls Series, with elaborate introductions tracing the literary\r\nhistory of the work and a magnificent index. The _Historia Minor_ has\r\nbeen published in three volumes by Sir F. Madden in the Rolls Series.\r\nParis also wrote the lives of the abbots of his house up to 1255, a\r\nwork not now extant, and the basis of the later _Gesta Abbatum S.\r\nAlbani_, compiled by Thomas Walsingham (d. 1422?) and likewise issued\r\nin the Rolls Series. The thirteenth century biographies have some\r\noriginal value. Paris's _Life_ of _Stephen Langton_ is printed in\r\nLIEBERMANN'S _Ungedruckte Anglo-Normannische Geschichtsquellen_ (1870).\r\n\r\nParis, perhaps the greatest historian of the Middle Ages, has literary\r\nskill, a vivid though prolix style, a keen eye for the picturesque,\r\nbold and independent judgment, wonderful breadth and range, and an\r\ninsatiable curiosity. He was a man of the world, a courtier and a\r\nscholar; he took immense pains to collect his facts from documents and\r\neye-witnesses, and had great advantages in this respect through the\r\nintimate relations between his house and the court. Henry III himself\r\ncontributed many items of information to him. His details are\r\nextraordinarily full, and he tells us almost as much about continental\r\naffairs as about those of his own country. He wrote with too flowing a\r\npen to be careful about precision, and had too much love of the\r\npicturesque to resist the temptation of embellishing a good story. His\r\nnarrative of continental transactions is in particular extremely\r\ninexact. But the chief cause of his offending also gives special value\r\nto his work; he was a man of strong views and his sympathies and\r\nprejudices colour every line he wrote. His standpoint is that of a\r\npatriotic Englishman, indignant at the alien invasions, at the\r\nmisgovernment of the king, the greed of the curialists and the\r\nPoitevins, and with a professional bias against the mendicants. His\r\nwritings make his age live.\r\n\r\nThe falling off in the St. Alban's work of the next generation is\r\ncharacteristic of the decay of colour and detail which makes the\r\nchroniclers of the age of Edward I. inferior to those of his father's\r\nreign. The years after 1259 were briefly chronicled by uninspired\r\ncontinuators of Matthew Paris, and the reputation of St. Alban's as a\r\nschool of history led to the frequent transference of their annals to\r\nother religious houses, where they were written up by local pens. This\r\nled to the dissemination of the series of jejune compilations which in\r\nthe ages of Edward I. and II. were widely spread under the name of\r\n_Flores Historiarum_. Dr. Luard has published a critical edition of\r\nthese _Flores_ in three volumes of the Rolls Series, which range from\r\nthe creation to 1326, with an introduction determining their\r\ncomplicated relations to each other. They are of no real value before\r\n1259, and for the next sixty-seven years are only important by reason\r\nof the defects of our other sources. No unity or colour can be expected\r\nin books handed from house to house and kept up to date by jottings by\r\ndifferent hands. The ascription of these _Flores_ to a conjectural\r\nMatthew of Westminster by earlier editors is groundless. Dr. C.\r\nHorstmann, _Nova Legenda Anglie_, i., pp. xlix. _seq._(1901), maintains\r\nthat John of Tynemouth's _Historia Aurea_, still in manuscript, is the\r\nofficial St. Alban's history from 1327 to 1377.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward I. the credit of the school of St. Alban's was\r\nrevived to some extent by WILLIAM RISHANGER, who made his profession in\r\n1271 and died early in the reign of Edward II. To him is assigned a\r\nchronicle ranging from 1259 to 1306 published by H.T. Riley in the\r\nvolume _Willelmi Rishanger et Anonymorum Chronica et Annales_ (Rolls\r\nSeries). Rishanger's authorship of the portion 1259-1272 is more\r\nprobable than that of the section 1272-1306, which, not compiled before\r\n1327, is almost certainly by another hand, and the attribution of even\r\nthe earlier section to Rishanger is doubted by so competent an\r\nauthority as M. Bémont. The compilation is frigid and unequal. Of the\r\nmiscellaneous contents of Mr. Riley's volume, the short _Gesta Edwardi\r\nI._ (pp. 411-423), of no great value, is clearly Rishanger's work. We\r\nmay also ascribe to Rishanger the _Narratio de Bellis apud Lewes et\r\nEvesham_ (ed. Halliwell, Camden Soc., 1840), which tells the story of\r\nthe Barons' Wars with vigour, detail, and insight. Written by a true\r\ninheritor of the prejudices of Matthew Paris, this chronicle is a\r\neulogy of Montfort. It was put together not before 1312.\r\n\r\nAnother volume of _Chroniclers of St. Alban's_ was edited by Mr. Riley\r\nfor the Rolls Series in 1860. Three of its chronicles concern our\r\nperiod. These are: (1) _Opus Chronicorum_, 1259-1296, a source of\r\n\"Rishanger's\" chronicle; (2) J. DE TROKELOWE'S _Annales_, 1307-1322;\r\n(3) H. DE BLANEFORDE'S _Chronica_ (1323). These last two are important\r\nfor Edward II.'s reign. After these works, historical writing further\r\ndeclined at St. Alban's. At the end of our period, however, another\r\ntrue disciple of Matthew Paris was found in the St. Alban's monk who\r\nadded to a jejune compilation for the years 1328 to 1370 a vivid and\r\npersonal narrative of the years 1376-1388, our chief source for the\r\nhistory of the last year of Edward III.'s reign. In his bitter\r\nprejudice against John of Gaunt and his clerical allies, such as\r\nWychffe and the mendicants, the monk is so outspoken that his book was\r\nsuppressed, and most manuscripts leave out the more offensive passages.\r\nIt has been edited by Sir E. Maunde Thompson as _Chronicon Angliæ_,\r\n1328-1388 (Rolls Series). Before that its contents, like that of other\r\nSt. Alban's annals, were partially known through the fifteenth century\r\ncompilation under the name of a St. Alban's monk, THOMAS OF WALSINGHAM,\r\nwhose _Historia Anglicana_ (2 vols., Rolls Series, ed. Riley) is not an\r\nauthority for our period.\r\n\r\nFor the early years of Henry III. we have besides Wendover's _Flores_:\r\n(i) The CANON OF BARNWELL'S continuation of Howden published in\r\nSTUBBS'S _Memoriale Fratris Walteri de Coventria_ (Rolls Series),\r\nwritten in 1227 and copious for the years 1216-1225. (2) RALPH OF\r\nCOGGESHALL's _Chronicon Anglicanum_ (ed. Stevenson, Rolls Series),\r\nending at 1227 and important for its last twelve years. (3) The\r\n_Histoire des Ducs de Normandie et des Rois d'Angleterre_, which,\r\npublished by F. Michel in 1840 (Soc. de l'histoire de France), was\r\nfirst appreciated at its full value by M. Petit-Dutaillis in the _Revue\r\nHistorique_. tome 2 (1892). (4) The _Chronique de l'Anonyme de Béthune_\r\nprinted in 1904 in vol. xxiv. of the _Recueil des Historiens de la\r\nFrance_. (5) A French rhyming chronicle, the _Histoire de Guillaume le\r\nMaréchal_, discovered and edited by P. Meyer for the Soc. de l'histoire\r\nde France. Written by a minstrel of the younger Marshal from materials\r\nsupplied by the regent's favourite squire, it is, though poetry and\r\npanegyric, an important source for Marshal's regency.\r\n\r\nSt. Alban's was not the only religious house that concerned itself with\r\nthe production of chronicles. Other _Annales Monastici_ have been\r\nedited in five volumes (Rolls Series, vol. v. is the index) by Dr.\r\nLuard. They are of special importance for the reign of Henry III. In\r\nvol. i. the meagre annals of the Glamorganshire abbey of Margam only\r\nextend to 1232. The _Annals of Tewkesbury_ are useful from 1200 to\r\n1263, and specially for the history of the Clares, the patrons of that\r\nhouse. The Annals of Burton-upon-Trent illustrate the years 1211 to\r\n1261 with somewhat intermittent light, and are of unique value for the\r\nperiod of the Provisions of Oxford, containing many official documents.\r\nVol. ii. includes the _Annals_ of _Winchester_ and _Waverley_. The\r\nformer, extending to 1277, though mainly concerned with local affairs\r\nare useful for certain parts of the reign of Henry III., and\r\nparticularly for the years 1267-1277. The annals of the Cistercian\r\nhouse of Waverley, near Farnham, go down to 1291. From 1259 to 1266 the\r\nnarrative is contemporary and valuable; from 1266 to 1275, and partly\r\nfrom 1275 to 1277 it is borrowed from the Winchester Annals; from 1277\r\nto its abrupt end it is again of importance. The _Annals of Bermondsey_\r\nin vol. iii. are a fifteenth century compilation. The _Annals_ of the\r\nAustin canons of _Dunstable_ are of great value, especially from the\r\nyear 1201, when they become original, down to 1242. This section is\r\nwritten by RICHARD DE MORINS, prior of Dunstable from 1202 to 1242.\r\nAfter his death the annals become more local, though they give a clear\r\nnarrative of the puzzling period 1258-1267. They stop in 1297. The\r\nchief contents of vol. iv, are the parallel _Annals of Oseney_ and the\r\n_Chronicle_ of THOMAS WYKES, a canon of that house, who took the\r\nreligious habit in 1282. To 1258 the two histories are very similar,\r\nthat of Wykes being slightly fuller. They then remain distinct until\r\n1278, and again from 1280 to 1284 and 1285-1289. In the latter year\r\nWykes stops, while Oseney goes on with independent value until 1293,\r\nand as a useless compilation till 1346. Wykes is of unique interest for\r\nthe Barons' Wars, as he is the only competent chronicler who takes the\r\nroyalist side. The Oseney writer, much less full and interesting,\r\nrepresents the ordinary baronial standpoint. Wykes is occasionally\r\nuseful for the first years of Edward I.; after 1288 his importance\r\nbecomes small. The _Annals of Worcester_ are largely a compilation from\r\nthe Winchester Annals and the _Flores_; the local insertions have some\r\nvalue for the period 1216-1258, and more for the latter part of the\r\nreign of Edward I., at whose death they end.\r\n\r\nOther monastic chronicles of the thirteenth century, of small\r\nimportance, enumerated by Dr. Luard (_Ann. Mon._, iv., liii.) are not\r\nyet printed in full. Extracts from many are given in PERTZ'S _Monumenta\r\nGermaniæ Hist. Scriptores_, vols. xxvii. and xxviii. The _Annales\r\nCestrienses_ (to 1297) have been edited by R.C. Christie (Record Soc.\r\nof Lancashire and Cheshire); EDMUND OF HADENHAM'S _Chronicle_ (down to\r\n1307) is given in part in WHARTON'S _Anglia Sacra_, and M. Bémont\r\npublishes in an appendix to his _Simon de Montfort_ (pp. 373-380) a\r\nvaluable fragment of a _Chronicle_ of _Battle Abbey_ on the Barons'\r\nWars, 1258-1265. For the latter part of that period we have some useful\r\nnotices in HENRY OF SILEGRAVE's brief _Chronicle_ (ed. Hook, Caxton\r\nSoc., 1849), whose close relationship to the _Battle Chronicle_ M.\r\nBémont has first indicated. To these may be added the _Annals of\r\nStanley Abbey_ (1202-1271) in vol. ii. of _Chronicles of Stephen, Henry\r\nII. and Richard I._ (ed. Hewlett, Rolls Series, 1885), and the\r\n_Chronicle_ of the Bury monk, JOHN OF TAXSTER or TAYSTER, which becomes\r\ncopious from the middle of the thirteenth century and ends in 1265; it\r\nwas partly printed in 1849 by Benjamin Thorpe as a continuation of\r\nFlorence of Worcester (English Historical Society), and the years\r\n1258-1262 are best read in Luard's edition of Bartholomew Cotton (Rolls\r\nSeries). Taxster's work became the basis of several later compilations\r\nof the eastern counties, including: (i) JOHN OF EVERSDEN, another Bury\r\nmonk, independent from 1265 to 1301, also printed without his name by\r\nThorpe, up to 1295, as a further continuation of Florence. (2) JOHN OF\r\nOXNEAD, a monk of St. Benet's, Hulme, a reputed continuator of Taxster\r\nand Eversden up to 1280, who adds a good deal of his own for the years\r\n1280-1293, edited somewhat carelessly by Sir Henry Ellis as _Chronica\r\nJ. de Oxenedes_ (Rolls Series). (3) BARTHOLOMEW COTTON, a monk of\r\nNorwich, whose _Historia Anglicana_, original from 1291 to 1298, and\r\nspecially important from 1285 to 1291, is edited by Luard (Rolls\r\nSeries). Some thirteenth and early fourteenth century Bury chronicles\r\nare also in _Memorials_ of _St. Edmund's Abbey_, ed. T. Arnold (vols.\r\nii. and iii., Rolls Series). The _Chronicon de Mailros_ (Bannatyne\r\nClub), from the Cistercian abbey of Melrose, goes to 1270; though\r\nutterly untrustworthy, it may be noticed as almost the only Scottish\r\nchronicle before the war of independence, and as containing a curious\r\nrecord of the miracles of Simon de Montfort.\r\n\r\nAmong the historians of Edward I.'s reign is WALTER OF HEMINGBURGH,\r\nCanon of Guisborough in Cleveland (ed. H.C. Hamilton, 2 vols., Engl.\r\nHist. Soc.). His account of Henry III.'s reign is worthless, but from\r\n1272 to 1312 his work is of great value, though never precise and full\r\nof gaps. It contains many documents and is remarkable for its stirring\r\nbattle pictures. Hemingburgh probably laid down his pen when the\r\nnarrative ceases early in the reign of Edward II. Another writer,\r\nidentified by Horstmann with John of Tynemouth, carries the story from\r\n1326 to 1346.\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast to the flowing periods of Hemingburgh is the\r\nwell-written and chronologically digested _Annals_ of the Dominican\r\nfriar NICHOLAS TREVET or TRIVET, the son of a judge of Henry III.'s\r\nreign (ed. Hog, Engl. Hist. Soc.). Beginning in 1138, his work assumes\r\nindependent value for the latter years of Henry III. and is of\r\nfirst-rate importance for the reign of Edward I., at whose death it\r\nconcludes, though Trevet was certainly alive in 1324. It was largely\r\nused by the later St. Alban's chroniclers.\r\n\r\nFranciscan historiography begins earlier than Dominican with the\r\nremarkable tract of THOMAS OF ECCLESTON, written about 1260, _De\r\nAdventu Fratrum Minorum in Anglia_, published with other Minorite\r\ndocuments (including Adam Marsh's letters) in BREWER'S _Monumenta\r\nFranciscana_ (Rolls Series, continued in a second volume by R.\r\nHewlett). The first important Franciscan chronicle, called the\r\n_Chronicon de Lanercost_ (ed. J. Stevenson, Bannatyne Club, 2 vols.),\r\nreally comes from the Minorite convent of Carlisle. It covers the years\r\n1201 to 1346. The early part is derived from the valueless chronicle of\r\nMelrose, and its incoherent cult of the memory of Montfort does not\r\nsave it from the grossest errors in dealing with his history. It\r\nbecomes important for northern affairs from Edward I. onwards, giving\r\nfull details with a strong anti-Scottish bias. Another north-country\r\nchronicle is Sir T. GREY'S _Scalacronica_ (ed. Stevenson, Maitland\r\nClub, 1836), useful for the Scottish wars and for Edward III.'s reign\r\nup to 1362.\r\n\r\nA sign of the times is the beginning of civic chronicles. The London\r\nseries alone is important for English history. It begins with the\r\n_Liber de Antiquis Legibus_, or _Chronica Majorum et Vicecomitum\r\nLondoniarum_ (1188-1274, ed. T. Stapleton, Camden Soc.). The work of\r\nARNOLD FITZTHEDMAR, alderman of the German merchants in London, it is\r\ncopious for the years 1236 to 1274, and is, with Wykes, the only\r\nchronicle of the Barons' Wars written with a royalist bias. Fourteenth\r\ncentury civic chronicles, based upon _Flores Historiarum_, and\r\ncontinued independently, form the main contents of the two volumes of\r\n_Chronicles of the Reigns of Edward I. and II._ (ed. by Dr. Stubbs for\r\nthe Rolls Series). These are: (1) _Annales Londonienses_, perhaps\r\nwritten by ANDREW HORN, chamberlain of London, and compiler of the\r\n_Liber Horn_; they have much general value for the period 1301 to 1316,\r\nand deal more narrowly with London history from 1316 to 1330, when they\r\nconclude. (2) _Annales Paulini_, 1307-1341, compiled by one of the\r\nclergy of St. Paul's, but not by Adam Murimuth. These take up Dr.\r\nStubbs's first volume. The second contains: (1) JOHN OF LONDON'S\r\n_Commendatio Lamentabilis in Transitu magni Regis Edwardi quarti_, a\r\nfuneral eulogy containing the most elaborate contemporary analysis of\r\nEdward's character. (2) The CANON OF BRIDLINGTON'S _Gesta Edwardi de\r\nCarnarvon_, with a continuation down to the death of Edward III., of\r\nlittle value after 1339. It has frequent reference to the vaticinations\r\nof the local prophet, John of Bridlington, and was not put in its\r\npresent shape before 1377. Its first part is based on earlier sources,\r\nand it is, for lack of better, a prime authority for north-country\r\nhistory and Anglo-Scottish relations; the continuation contains the\r\nbest account of Edward Balliol's attempts on the Scottish throne. (3)\r\n_Vita Edwardi II._, from 1307 to 1325, attributed by Hearne on slight\r\ngrounds to a MONK OF MALMESBURY, with many notices of the history of\r\nGloucestershire and Bristol, of which the famous rising is described at\r\nlength. The writer is the most human of the annalists of the reign,\r\nprolix, self-conscious, moralising, and somewhat incoherent. He is the\r\nmost outspoken of all the fourteenth century critics of the Roman\r\ncuria, and has more insight than most of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe following are of primary importance for the early years of Edward\r\nIII.; it is significant that they are nearly all secular, not monastic,\r\nin origin. (1) _Continuatio Chronicorum_, 1303-1347, by ADAM MURIMUTH,\r\na canon of St. Paul's much employed by Edward III. (ed. E.M. Thompson\r\nin Rolls Series), a mere continuation of the _Flores_ until 1325,\r\nthence enlarged from personal sources, but still meagre until 1337,\r\nwhen it becomes a first-rate authority to 1346. Murimuth's adoption of\r\nMichaelmas day as the beginning of the year has often confused those\r\nwho have imitated him. Chief among these is (2) GEOFFREY LE BAKER of\r\nSwinbrooke, an Oxfordshire man, and like Murimuth, a secular clerk,\r\nwhose _Chronicon_ (ed. E.M. Thompson), beginning in 1303 on the basis\r\nof Murimuth, has independent value after 1324, and is noteworthy for\r\nits touching details of Edward II.'s fall and death. It ends in 1356\r\nwith an excellent account of the battle of Poitiers. The early part of\r\nBaker's chronicle, widely circulated as _Vita et Mors Edwardi II._, was\r\npreviously assigned to Sir Thomas de la Moor, and was so edited by\r\nStubbs, but Sir E.M. Thompson showed clearly that this Oxfordshire\r\nknight was Baker's patron and not the writer of a chronicle. With many\r\ndefects, Baker can tell a story picturesquely. (3) ROBERT OF AVESBURY,\r\na canon lawyer, wrote _De mirabilibus Gestis Edwardi III._, of special\r\nimportance for the war from 1339 to 1356, and containing many state\r\ndocuments. It is edited by E.M. Thompson in the same volume as\r\nMurimuth. (4) HENRY KNIGHTON, Canon of Leicester, wrote a _Chronicle_\r\nabout 1366 which is valuable for the period 1336-1366 and includes the\r\nbest contemporary account of the Black Death. The latest edition by\r\nLumby in the Rolls Series is not a scholarly work. (5) _Eulogium\r\nHistoriarum_ (ed. Haydon, Rolls Series) is contemporary and valuable\r\nfor 1356-1366 only. There is a great dearth of English chronicles for\r\nthe latter years of Edward III. The signal exception is the important\r\nSt. Alban's _Chronicon Angliæ_ already mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn the age of Edward III. the _Flores Historiarum_ were superseded by\r\nthe _Polychronicon_ (often called the \"Brute\" after WACE'S _Brut\r\nd'Angleterre_), the voluminous compilation (to 1352) of RANDOLPH\r\nHIGDEN, a monk of Chester (edited by Babington and Lumby, Rolls\r\nSeries). ROBERT OF GLOUCESTER, PETER LANGTOFT, and ROBERT MANNYNG have\r\nbeen referred to elsewhere. The first is of some original value for the\r\nBarons' Wars and Edward I., while Langtoft, a Yorkshire canon specially\r\ninterested in the Scottish wars, is a contemporary for all Edward I.'s\r\nreign. Among rhyming chronicles, French in tongue but English in\r\norigin, may be mentioned _Le Siège de Carlaverock_, 1300 (ed. Nicolas,\r\n1828), of value for heraldry, and CHANDOS HERALD'S _Prince Noir_ (ed.\r\nH.O. Coxe, whose edition was pillaged by F. Michel for his more\r\naccessible version of 1883). _L'Histoire de Foulques Fitz Warin_ (d.\r\n1260?), a picturesque marcher hero, a prose romance of the end of the\r\nthirteenth century, can be read in Stevenson's edition of COGGESHALL\r\n(Rolls Series), or Englished by A. Kemp-Welch (1904).\r\n\r\nNo contemporary Scottish chronicles of importance deal with the War of\r\nIndependence, though fairly full Scottish versions of it exist in later\r\nbooks. The earliest of these is the _Bruce_ of JOHN BARBOUR, Archdeacon\r\nof Aberdeen. Written in 1375 at the instigation of Robert II.,\r\nBarbour's spirited verses are inspired by patriotic rather than\r\nhistoric motives. His details are minute, but impossible to control by\r\nother sources, and he is more valuable as the epic poet of Scottish\r\nliberty than as an historical authority. He is edited by Skeat (Early\r\nEnglish Text Soc.), Jamieson, and Innes. The earliest prose Scottish\r\nchronicle, that of JOHN FORDUN, who died about 1384 (ed. Skene, in\r\n_Historians of Scotland_), is of value for the fourteenth century.\r\nANDREW WYNTONN'S _Originale_, a metrical history written in the\r\nfifteenth century, has next to no authority until the end of this\r\nperiod (ed. Laing, in _Historians of Scotland_), BLIND HARRY'S\r\n_Wallace_, written in 1488, is romance not history.\r\n\r\nWales is more fortunate than Scotland in preserving contemporary\r\nthirteenth century annals, of which a Latin chronicle, _Annales\r\nCambriæ_, extending to 1288, and a Welsh one, _Brut y Tywysogion_\r\n(i.e., _Chronicle of the Princes_), down to 1278, are edited by J.\r\nWilliams in the Rolls Series, the latter with an English translation. A\r\nmore critical version of the Welsh text of the _Brut_ is that of J.\r\nRHYS and J.G. EVANS' _Red Book of Hergest_, vol. ii. (1890).\r\n\r\nThe close relations between England and France for the whole of this\r\nperiod render the French chronicles by far the most important of\r\nforeign sources for English history. They are enumerated in detail by\r\nAuguste Molinier in vols. iii. (up to 1328) and iv. (after 1328) of the\r\nfirst part of _Les Sources de l'Histoire de France (Manuels de\r\nBibliographie historique_). The chief French chronicles of the period\r\n1226-1328 are collected in vols. xx.-xxiv. of the _Recueil des\r\nHistoriens de la France_ begun by Dom Bouquet. Some of them are of\r\nspecial importance for English history. For Anglo-Netherlandish\r\nrelations under Edward I. see _Annales Gandenses_ (1296-1310), \"la\r\nchronique la plus remarquable de la fin du xiiie siècle,\" the French\r\n_Chronique Artésienne_ (1295-1304), and the _Chronique Tournaisienne_\r\n(1296-1314), all edited by F. Funck-Brentano in the already mentioned\r\n_Collection de Textes_. For the Hundred Years' War the French\r\nchroniclers are indispensable, especially for military history. The\r\nmost famous of these writers, JEAN FROISSART, has been characterised in\r\nmy text (p. 419). He can best be studied in Luce and Raynouart's\r\nexcellent edition for the Soc. de l'Histoire de France (tomes i.-viii.,\r\n1869-1888) which completes the story up to Edward III.'s death. Luce's\r\ncareful \"sommaire et commentaire critique\" often affords means of\r\nchecking Froissart by other sources. The magnificent volumes of indexes\r\nof Kervyn de Lettenhove's complete edition (vols. XX.-XXV.) are still\r\nof immense use, though his text and comments are inferior to those of\r\nLuce, Froissart's spirit may well be caught in Lord Berners's racy\r\nEnglish translation (Tudor Translations), or in G.C. Macaulay's useful\r\nabridgment. The three redactions of Froissart's first book (from 1327\r\nto 1373-1377), which is all that concerns our period, have been clearly\r\ndistinguished by Luce. (1) The first edition, written about 1373, at\r\nthe request of Count Robert of Namur, is inspired by an English bias.\r\nUp to 1360 it is largely derived from the chronicle of JEAN LE BEL,\r\nCanon of St. Lambert of Liège; after that date it is original. (2) The\r\nsecond edition, only represented by two MSS., of which one is\r\nincomplete, is a modification of the first with a French bias. The\r\nearlier part is more independent of Jean le Bel. (3) The third edition,\r\npreserved in a single MS., ends with the death of Philip VI in 1350,\r\nand, written after 1400, is even more hostile to England than the\r\nsecond. The best edition of Jean le Bel is by Polain for the Académie\r\nroyale de Belgique.\r\n\r\nA few of the more important French chronicles after 1328 may be\r\nmentioned shortly. (1) _Grands Chroniques de France_ (ed. Paulin\r\nParis). Original from 1350 to 1377, a work of first-rate importance,\r\nwhere, if truth is altered, it is altered deliberately from political\r\nmotives. (2) JEAN DE VENETTE, 1340-1368, written with a popular bias,\r\nand partly favourable to Charles of Navarre (edited as a supplement to\r\nGéraud's edition of Guillaume de Nangis, ii., 178-378, Soc. de l'Hist.\r\nde France). (3) _Chronique Normande du xiv'e siècle_, 1337-1372 (ed.\r\nMolinier, Soc. de l'Hist. de France, 1882), exact and very important\r\nfor the wars 1337 to 1372. (4) _Chronique des quatre premiers Valois_\r\n(Soc. de l'Hist. de France). (5) CUVELIER'S poetical _Vie de Bertrand\r\ndu Guesclin_ (2 vols., _Doc. inédits_). Further details can be found in\r\nMolinier's bibliography. Netherlandish sources for the Hundred Years'\r\nWar are summarised in PIRENNE'S _Bibliographie de l'Histoire de\r\nBelgique_ (1895). Of special importance is JAN VAN KLERK'S _Van den\r\nDerden Edewaert Rym Kronyk_. (1840), useful for 1337-1341, and written\r\nwith an English bias.\r\n\r\nThe unofficial legal literature of the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies is of exceptional variety and value. Many lawyers' treatises\r\nthrow light on matters far beyond legal technicalities. HENRY OF\r\nBRACTON or BRATTON'S _De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliæ_\r\nillustrates the union of English and Roman juridical ideas\r\ncharacteristic of the age of Henry III. It has been edited badly by Sir\r\nT. Twiss in six volumes (Rolls Series), and some portions well by\r\nProfessor Maitland in his _Select passages from Bracton and Azo_\r\n(Selden Soc.). Maitland's _Bracton's Note Book_ includes extracts from\r\nplea rolls seemingly made by Bracton. Bracton's book on the laws was\r\ntranslated, condensed, and rearranged by a writer of the next\r\ngeneration called Britton. It may be studied in a modern edition in\r\nNICHOLLS'S _Britton on the laws of England_, while _Fleta_, an almost\r\ncontemporary Latin law book, must be read in Selden's seventeenth\r\ncentury edition. Another thirteenth century law-book, _Le Mirroir des\r\nJustices_, has been edited by Maitland and W.J. Whittaker for the\r\nSelden Society. From Edward I.'s time onwards unofficial reports of\r\ntrials called YEAR BOOKS, written in French, become valuable for their\r\nvividness and detail, and for the light which they throw on the more\r\ntechnical records of the plea rolls. Many of them are printed in\r\nunsatisfactory seventeenth century editions, but the Year Books of five\r\nof Edward I.'s regnal years, between 1292 to 1307, together with the\r\nYear Book of 11-12 Edward III., are accessible in A.J. Horwood's\r\neditions in the Rolls Series. L.O. Pike has also edited in the Rolls\r\nSeries the _Year books of Edward III._ from 1338 to 1345, and\r\nMaitland's _Year books of Edward II._ for the Selden Society are the\r\nfirst two instalments of a scheme for publishing the Year Books of the\r\nreign. Besides their legal value, the Year Books are an almost unworked\r\nmine for social and economic, and often even political and\r\necclesiastical, history.\r\n\r\nOf literary aids to history T. WRIGHT'S _Political Songs_ (Camden Soc.)\r\nillustrate this period to the reign of Edward II. One of Wright's\r\npieces has been more elaborately edited in C.L. KINGSFORD'S Song of\r\n_Lewes_ (1890), and C. Hardwick published a _Poem on the Times OF\r\nEdward II._ for the Percy Soc. (1849). With Edward III. such literature\r\nbecomes copious. Of special importance are T. Wright's _Political POEMS\r\nand SONGS FROM the accession of Edward III._, vol. i. (Rolls Series,\r\n1859), J. Hall's _Poems of_ LAURENCE MINOT, Skeat's editions of CHAUCER\r\nand LANGLAND, and G.C. Macaulay's edition of GOWER. The Latin works of\r\nWycliffe, published by the Wycliffe Society, mainly belong to the\r\nsucceeding period, but _De Dominio Divino_ and _De Civili Dominio_, as\r\nwell as some tracts printed in the appendix to LEWIS'S _Life of Wiclif_\r\nand in Shirley's edition of _Fasciculi Zizanioram_ (Rolls Series), were\r\nwritten before 1377.\r\n\r\nOf modern works treating of this period, many monographs, dealing with\r\nparticular points, have been mentioned in notes in the course of the\r\nnarrative. Of general guides to the period the best by far are Stubbs\r\nand Pauli. STUBBS'S _Constitutional History_ (vol. ii.) is as valuable\r\nfor the chapters summarising the political history as for the more\r\nstrictly constitutional matter. R. PAULI'S _Geschichte von England_,\r\niii., 489-896, and iv., 1-505, 716-741, remains, after half a century,\r\nthe fullest and most satisfactory working up in detail of these reigns,\r\nthough the great additions to our material make parts of it a somewhat\r\nunsafe guide. It can be supplemented for particular aspects of history\r\nby the following: For legal history, POLLOCK and MAITLAND'S _History of\r\nEnglish Law before the time of Edward I._, especially vol. i., book i.\r\n(chapters iv.-vi.), and book ii.; and most of vol. ii.; to which should\r\nbe added the prefaces by Prof. Maitland and others to the volumes of\r\nthe Selden Society. MAITLAND'S _Roman Canon Law in the Church of\r\nEngland_ (1898) is also of great importance. For economic history, W.J.\r\nASHLEY'S _Economic History_, parts i. and ii.; W. CUNNINGHAM's _Growth\r\nof English Industry and Commerce, Early and Middle Ages_; VINOGRADOFF'S\r\n_Villainage in England_, S. DOWELL'S _History of Taxation_ (2nd\r\nedition), H. HALL'S _Customs Revenue of England_, and, as a collection\r\nof materials, J.E. THOROLD ROGERS' _History of Agriculture and Prices_,\r\nvols. i. and ii. For ecclesiastical history, W.R.W. STEPHENS'S _History\r\nof the English Church, 1066-1272_; W.W. CAPES'S _History of the English\r\nChurch in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries_, and F. MAKOWER'S\r\n_The Constitutional History and Constitution of the Church of England_\r\n(translated from the German). For academic history, DENIFLE'S\r\n_Entstehung der Universitäten des Mittelalters bis 1400_, especially\r\npp. 1-40, 237-251 (Oxford) and pp. 367-376 (Cambridge), HAURÉAU'S\r\n_Histoire de la Philosophie scholastique_ and RASHDALL'S _Universities\r\nof the Middle Ages_, i., 1-74, and ii., part ii. (Oxford and\r\nCambridge). For military history, KÖHLER'S _Entwickelung des\r\nKriegswesens in der Ritterzeit_, OMAN'S _History of the Art of War in\r\nthe Middle Ages_, CLARK'S _Mediæval Military Architecture_, and (above\r\nall) J.E. MORRIS'S _Welsh Wars of Edward I_. For naval history,\r\nNICOLAS'S _History of the Royal Navy_, and C. DE LA RONCIÈRE'S\r\n_Histoire de la Marine Française_. For particular reigns the following\r\nmay be found useful: For Henry III., PETIT-DUTAILLIS'S _Étude sur Louis\r\nVIII._, GASQUET'S _Henry III. and the Church_ (1905), BÉMONT'S _Simon\r\nde Montfort_, PROTHERO'S _Simon de Montfort_, and BLAAUW'S _Barons'\r\nWars_ (2nd ed., 1871). For the reign of Edward I., SEELEY's _Life and\r\nReign of Edward I._ (1872), my _Edward I._; GOUGH'S _Itinerary of\r\nEdward I._, MAXWELL'S _Robert the Bruce_ (Heroes of the Nations), and\r\nMORRIS'S above-mentioned _Welsh Wars of Edward I._ For some aspects of\r\nEdward II.'s reign, STUBBS'S prefaces to _Chronicles of Edward I. and\r\nEdward II._ are of special value. For Edward III.'s reign, BARNES's\r\n_History of Edward III._ (1688) is not quite superseded by LONGMAN'S\r\n_Life and Times of Edward III._ (2 vols., 1869), and MACKINNON'S\r\n_History of Edward III._ (1900). For the Hundred Years' War, E.\r\nDÉPREZ'S _Préliminaires de la Guerre de Cent Ans_ (1328-1342) (Bibl. de\r\nl'Ecole française de Rome, 1902) for diplomatic history, and DENIFLE's\r\n_Désolation des Églises et Monastères de la France pendant la Guerre de\r\nCent Ans_ (ii., part i., 1899) for the best general survey of the war\r\nto 1380. See also LUCE'S _La Jeunesse de Bertrand de Guesclin and La\r\nFrance pendant la Guerre de Cent Ans_, and (for Brittany) A. DE LA\r\nBORDERIE'S _Histoire de Brétagne_ (1899). The end of Edward III.'s\r\nreign is illustrated by S. ARMITAGE SMITH'S _John of Gaunt_ (1904), J.\r\nLECHLER'S _Wiclif und die Vorgeschichte der Reformation_ (2 vols.,\r\n1873), also translated, not very adequately, _Wycliffe and His English\r\nPrecursors_ (1878 and 1881), F.D. MATTHEW'S introduction to _Wyclif's\r\nEnglish Works_ (Early English Text Society), and R.L. POOLE'S\r\n_Illustrations of the History of Mediæval Thought_ (1884), and\r\n_Wycliffe_ (1889). G.M. TREVELYAN's _England in the Age of Wycliffe_\r\n(1899) is interesting but not always very scholarly.\r\n\r\nSome account of the general foreign history of the period can be found\r\nin LAVISSE and RAMBAUD'S _Histoire générale_ (tomes ii. and iii.),\r\nLOSERTH'S _Geschichte des späteren Mittelalters_ (good bibliographies),\r\nand, briefly, in my _Papacy and Empire_ (up to 1273), and LODGE'S\r\n_Close of the Middle Ages_ (after 1273). For French history of the\r\nperiod LAVISSE'S _Histoire de France_ (iii., pt. i., 1137-1226, by A.\r\nLUCHAIRE; iii., pt. ii., 1226-1328, by C.V. LANGLOIS, and iv., pt. i.,\r\n1328-1422, by A. COVILLE) cover the whole of the period. More detailed\r\nworks are, PETIT-DUTAILLIS'S _Louis VIII._, E. BERGER'S _Blanche de\r\nCastile_, WALLON'S _Louis IX._, BOUTARIC'S _Saint Louis et Alfonse de\r\nPoitiers_, C.V. LANGLOIS'S _Philippe le Hardi_, BOUTARIC'S _France sous\r\nPhilippe le Bel_, LEHUGEUR'S _Philippe le Long_, PETIT'S _Charles de\r\nValois_, FOURNIER'S _Royaume d'Arles et de Vienne_, L. DELISLE'S _Hist.\r\nde Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte_, and (for the south) the new edition of DE\r\nVIC and VAISSÈTE's _Hist. générale de Languedoc_. Much recent work has\r\nbeen done by French scholars towards the reconstruction of the external\r\nhistory of England during the whole of our period. For the Low\r\nCountries, PIRENNE'S _Hist. de Belgique_, ii., ASHLEY'S _James and\r\nPhilip van Artevelde_, and VANDER KINDERE'S _Le Siècle des Arteveldt_.\r\nPAULI is good for the relations of England and Germany.\r\n\r\nMaps illustrating the period are to be found in POOLE'S _Oxford\r\nHistorical Atlas_, LONGNON'S _Atlas historique de la France_, and\r\nSPRUNER-MENKE'S _Historischer Hand-Atlas_; special maps of Edward I.'s\r\nScottish expeditions in GOUGH'S _Itinerary of Edward I._, of Edward\r\nIII.'s and the Black Prince's campaigns in THOMPSON'S _Chronicon\r\nGalfridi le Baker_, and KERVYN'S _Froissart_, of John of Gaunt's in\r\nARMITAGE-SMITH's _John of Gaunt_, and of Wales in the thirteenth\r\ncentury in _Owens College Historical Essays_. VIDAL DE LA BLACHE'S\r\n_Tableau de la Géographie de la France_ (LAVISSE, _Hist. de France_,\r\ni., pt. i.) is instructive for the physical features of the campaigns\r\nof the Hundred Years' War.\r\n\r\nFurther details as to English authorities, ancient and modern, can be\r\nfound in GROSS'S excellent Sources _and Literature of English History_\r\n(1900). The _Monumenta Germaniæ Historica_, _Scriptores_, vols.\r\nxxvii., xxviii., consist of excerpts from English writers of the\r\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries; the introductions (in Latin) by Pauli\r\nand Liebermann contain noteworthy estimates of the works from which the\r\nextracts are taken.\r\n\r\nNOTE TO PAGES 390-92.\r\n\r\nMy reasons for my account of the battle of Poitiers demand longer\r\nexplanation than can be given in a footnote. Like most modern writers,\r\nI have based my narrative on the _Chronicle_ of Geoffrey le Baker as\r\nexpounded by Sir E.M. Thompson, though I agree with Professor Oman in\r\nholding that Baker's \"ampla profundaque vallis et mariscus, torrente\r\nquodam irriguus,\" must be the valley of the Miausson. I also, however,\r\nagree with Father Denifle in not setting great store on Chandos Herald,\r\nthough I would not reject him altogether, as all prudent writers must\r\nreject Froissart. My conjectural account of the movements of the armies\r\nis an attempt to combine Baker with what may be true in the Herald. I\r\nhope elsewhere to be able to justify my narrative at length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\nAachen.\r\nAbbeville.\r\nAberconway Abbey.\r\nAberdeen.\r\nAberdeen, John Barbout, Archdeacon of.
