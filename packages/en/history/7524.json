The date of his birth can\r\nonly be arrived at by conjecture, and then only approximately. The\r\nyounger Pliny speaks of him as _prope modum aequales_, about the same\r\nage. Pliny was born in 61. Tacitus, however, occupied the office of\r\nquaestor under Vespasian in 78 A.D., at which time he must, therefore,\r\nhave been at least twenty-five years of age. This would fix the date of\r\nhis birth not later than 53 A.D. It is probable, therefore, that Tacitus\r\nwas Pliny's senior by several years.\r\n\r\nHis parentage is also a matter of pure conjecture. The name Cornelius\r\nwas a common one among the Romans, so that from it we can draw no\r\ninference. The fact that at an early age he occupied a prominent\r\npublic office indicates that he was born of good family, and it is not\r\nimpossible that his father was a certain Cornelius Tacitus, a Roman\r\nknight, who was procurator in Belgic Gaul, and whom the elder Pliny\r\nspeaks of in his \"Natural History.\"\r\n\r\nOf the early life of Tacitus and the training which he underwent\r\npreparatory to those literary efforts which afterwards rendered him a\r\nconspicuous figure among Roman literateurs we know absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nOf the events of his life which transpired after he attained man's\r\nestate we know but little beyond that which he himself has recorded in\r\nhis writings. He occupied a position of some eminence as a pleader at\r\nthe Roman bar, and in 77 A.D. married the daughter of Julius Agricola,\r\na humane and honorable citizen, who was at that time consul and was\r\nsubsequently appointed governor of Britain. It is quite possible that\r\nthis very advantageous alliance hastened his promotion to the office of\r\nquaestor under Vespasian.\r\n\r\nUnder Domitian, in 88, Tacitus was appointed one of fifteen\r\ncommissioners to preside at the celebration of the secular games. In the\r\nsame year he held the office of praetor, and was a member of one of the\r\nmost select of the old priestly colleges, in which a pre-requisite of\r\nmembership was that a man should be born of a good family.\r\n\r\nThe following year he appears to have left Rome, and it is possible\r\nthat he visited Germany and there obtained his knowledge and information\r\nrespecting the manners and customs of its people which he makes the\r\nsubject of his work known as the \"Germany.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not return to Rome until 93, after an absence of four years,\r\nduring which time his father-in-law died.\r\n\r\nSome time between the years 93 and 97 he was elected to the senate, and\r\nduring this time witnessed the judicial murders of many of Rome's best\r\ncitizens which were perpetrated under the reign of Nero. Being himself a\r\nsenator, he felt that he was not entirely guiltless of the crimes which\r\nwere committed, and in his \"Agricola\" we find him giving expression to\r\nthis feeling in the following words: \"Our own hands dragged Helvidius\r\nto prison; ourselves were tortured with the spectacle of Mauricus and\r\nRusticus, and sprinkled with the innocent blood of Senecio.\"\r\n\r\nIn 97 he was elected to the consulship as successor to Virginius\r\nRufus, who died during his term of office and at whose funeral Tacitus\r\ndelivered an oration in such a manner to cause Pliny to say, \"The\r\ngood fortune of Virginius was crowned by having the most eloquent of\r\npanegyrists.\"\r\n\r\nIn 99 Tacitus was appointed by the senate, together with Pliny, to\r\nconduct the prosecution against a great political offender, Marius\r\nPriscus, who, as proconsul of Africa, had corruptly mismanaged the\r\naffairs of his province. We have his associate's testimony that Tacitus\r\nmade a most eloquent and dignified reply to the arguments which were\r\nurged on the part of the defence. The prosecution was successful, and\r\nboth Pliny and Tacitus were awarded a vote of thanks by the senate for\r\ntheir eminent and effectual efforts in the management of the case.\r\n\r\nThe exact date of Tacitus's death is not known, but in his \"Annals\"\r\nhe seems to hint at the successful extension of the Emperor Trajan's\r\neastern campaigns during the years 115 to 117, so that it is probable\r\nthat he lived until the year 117.\r\n\r\nTacitus had a widespread reputation during his lifetime. On one occasion\r\nit is related of him that as he sat in the circus at the celebration of\r\nsome games, a Roman knight asked him whether he was from Italy or the\r\nprovinces. Tacitus answered, \"You know me from your reading,\" to which\r\nthe knight quickly replied, \"Are you then Tacitus or Pliny?\"\r\n\r\nIt is also worthy of notice that the Emperor Marcus Claudius Tacitus,\r\nwho reigned during the third century, claimed to be descended from the\r\nhistorian, and directed that ten copies of his works should be published\r\nevery year and placed in the public libraries.\r\n\r\nThe list of the extant works of Tacitus is as follows: the \"Germany;\"\r\nthe \"Life of Agricola;\" the \"Dialogue on Orators;\" the \"Histories,\" and\r\nthe \"Annals.\"\r\n\r\nThe following pages contain translations of the first two of these\r\nworks. The \"Germany,\" the full title of which is \"Concerning the\r\nsituation, manners and inhabitants of Germany,\" contains little of value\r\nfrom a historical standpoint. It describes with vividness the fierce and\r\nindependent spirit of the German nations, with many suggestions as to\r\nthe dangers in which the empire stood of these people. The \"Agricola\"\r\nis a biographical sketch of the writer's father-in-law, who, as has been\r\nsaid, was a distinguished man and governor of Britain. It is one of the\r\nauthor's earliest works and was probably written shortly after the\r\ndeath of Domitian, in 96. This work, short as it is, has always been\r\nconsidered an admirable specimen of biography on account of its grace\r\nand dignity of expression. Whatever else it may be, it is a graceful and\r\naffectionate tribute to an upright and excellent man.\r\n\r\nThe \"Dialogue on Orators\" treats of the decay of eloquence under the\r\nempire. It is in the form of a dialogue, and represents two eminent\r\nmembers of the Roman bar discussing the change for the worse that had\r\ntaken place in the early education of the Roman youth.\r\n\r\nThe \"Histories\" relate the events which transpired in Rome, beginning\r\nwith the ascession of Galba, in 68, and ending with the reign of\r\nDomitian, in 97. Only four books and a fragment of a fifth have been\r\npreserved to us. These books contain an account of the brief reigns of\r\nGalba, Otho and Vitellius. The portion of the fifth book which has been\r\npreserved contains an interesting, though rather biased, account of the\r\ncharacter, customs and religion of the Jewish nation viewed from the\r\nstandpoint of a cultivated citizen of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe \"Annals\" contain the history of the empire from the death of\r\nAugustus, in 14, to the death of Nero, in 68, and originally consisted\r\nof sixteen books. Of these, only nine have come down to us in a state\r\nof entire preservation, and of the other seven we have but fragments of\r\nthree. Out of a period of fifty-four years we have the history of about\r\nforty.\r\n\r\nThe style of Tacitus is, perhaps, noted principally for its conciseness.\r\nTacitean brevity is proverbial, and many of his sentences are so brief,\r\nand leave so much for the student to read between the lines, that in\r\norder to be understood and appreciated the author must be read over and\r\nover again, lest the reader miss the point of some of his most\r\nexcellent thoughts. Such an author presents grave, if not insuperable,\r\ndifficulties to the translator, but notwithstanding this fact, the\r\nfollowing pages cannot but impress the reader with the genius of\r\nTacitus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TREATISE ON THE SITUATION, MANNERS AND INHABITANTS OF GERMANY. [1]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Germany [2] is separated from Gaul, Rhaetia, [3] and Pannonia, [4] by\r\nthe rivers Rhine and Danube; from Sarmatia and Dacia, by mountains [5]\r\nand mutual dread. The rest is surrounded by an ocean, embracing broad\r\npromontories [6] and vast insular tracts, [7] in which our military\r\nexpeditions have lately discovered various nations and kingdoms. The\r\nRhine, issuing from the inaccessible and precipitous summit of the\r\nRhaetic Alps, [8] bends gently to the west, and falls into the Northern\r\nOcean. The Danube, poured from the easy and gently raised ridge of Mount\r\nAbnoba, [9] visits several nations in its course, till at length it\r\nbursts out [10] by six channels [11] into the Pontic sea; a seventh is\r\nlost in marshes.\r\n\r\n2. The people of Germany appear to me indigenous, [12] and free from\r\nintermixture with foreigners, either as settlers or casual visitants.\r\nFor the emigrants of former ages performed their expeditions not by\r\nland, but by water; [13] and that immense, and, if I may so call it,\r\nhostile ocean, is rarely navigated by ships from our world. [14] Then,\r\nbesides the danger of a boisterous and unknown sea, who would relinquish\r\nAsia, Africa, or Italy, for Germany, a land rude in its surface,\r\nrigorous in its climate, cheerless to every beholder and cultivator,\r\nexcept a native? In their ancient songs, [15] which are their only\r\nrecords or annals, they celebrate the god Tuisto, [16] sprung from the\r\nearth, and his son Mannus, as the fathers and founders of their race.\r\nTo Mannus they ascribe three sons, from whose names [17] the people\r\nbordering on the ocean are called Ingaevones; those inhabiting the\r\ncentral parts, Herminones; the rest, Istaevones. Some, [18] however,\r\nassuming the licence of antiquity, affirm that there were more\r\ndescendants of the god, from whom more appellations were derived; as\r\nthose of the Marsi, [19] Gambrivii, [20] Suevi, [21] and Vandali; [22]\r\nand that these are the genuine and original names. [23] That of Germany,\r\non the other hand, they assert to be a modern addition; [24] for that\r\nthe people who first crossed the Rhine, and expelled the Gauls, and\r\nare now called Tungri, were then named Germans; which appellation of a\r\nparticular tribe, not of a whole people, gradually prevailed; so that\r\nthe title of Germans, first assumed by the victors in order to excite\r\nterror, was afterwards adopted by the nation in general. [25] They\r\nhave likewise the tradition of a Hercules [26] of their country, whose\r\npraises they sing before those of all other heroes as they advance to\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n3. A peculiar kind of verses is also current among them, by the recital\r\nof which, termed \"barding,\" [27] they stimulate their courage; while the\r\nsound itself serves as an augury of the event of the impending combat.\r\nFor, according to the nature of the cry proceeding from the line, terror\r\nis inspired or felt: nor does it seem so much an articulate song, as the\r\nwild chorus of valor. A harsh, piercing note, and a broken roar, are\r\nthe favorite tones; which they render more full and sonorous by applying\r\ntheir mouths to their shields. [28] Some conjecture that Ulysses, in the\r\ncourse of his long and fabulous wanderings, was driven into this ocean,\r\nand landed in Germany; and that Asciburgium, [29] a place situated on\r\nthe Rhine, and at this day inhabited, was founded by him, and named\r\n_Askipurgion_. They pretend that an altar was formerly discovered here,\r\nconsecrated to Ulysses, with the name of his father Laertes subjoined;\r\nand that certain monuments and tombs, inscribed with Greek characters,\r\n[30] are still extant upon the confines of Germany and Rhaetia. These\r\nallegations I shall neither attempt to confirm nor to refute: let every\r\none believe concerning them as he is disposed.\r\n\r\n4. I concur in opinion with those who deem the Germans never to have\r\nintermarried with other nations; but to be a race, pure, unmixed, and\r\nstamped with a distinct character. Hence a family likeness pervades the\r\nwhole, though their numbers are so great: eyes stern and blue; ruddy\r\nhair; large bodies, [31] powerful in sudden exertions, but impatient of\r\ntoil and labor, least of all capable of sustaining thirst and heat. Cold\r\nand hunger they are accustomed by their climate and soil to endure.\r\n\r\n5. The land, though varied to a considerable extent in its aspect, is\r\nyet universally shagged with forests, or deformed by marshes: moister on\r\nthe side of Gaul, more bleak on the side of Norieum and Pannonia. [32]\r\nIt is productive of grain, but unkindly to fruit-trees. [33] It abounds\r\nin flocks and herds, but in general of a small breed. Even the beeve\r\nkind are destitute of their usual stateliness and dignity of head: [34]\r\nthey are, however, numerous, and form the most esteemed, and, indeed,\r\nthe only species of wealth. Silver and gold the gods, I know not whether\r\nin their favor or anger, have denied to this country. [35] Not that I\r\nwould assert that no veins of these metals are generated in Germany; for\r\nwho has made the search? The possession of them is not coveted by these\r\npeople as it is by us. Vessels of silver are indeed to be seen among\r\nthem, which have been presented to their ambassadors and chiefs; but\r\nthey are held in no higher estimation than earthenware. The borderers,\r\nhowever, set a value on gold and silver for the purpose of commerce,\r\nand have learned to distinguish several kinds of our coin, some of which\r\nthey prefer to others: the remoter inhabitants continue the more simple\r\nand ancient usage of bartering commodities. The money preferred by the\r\nGermans is the old and well-known species, such as the _Serrati_ and\r\n_Bigati_. [36] They are also better pleased with silver than gold; [37]\r\nnot on account of any fondness for that metal, but because the smaller\r\nmoney is more convenient in their common and petty merchandise.\r\n\r\n6. Even iron is not plentiful [38] among them; as may be inferred from\r\nthe nature of their weapons. Swords or broad lances are seldom used; but\r\nthey generally carry a spear, (called in their language _framea_, [39])\r\nwhich has an iron blade, short and narrow, but so sharp and manageable,\r\nthat, as occasion requires, they employ it either in close or distant\r\nfighting. [40] This spear and a shield are all the armor of the cavalry.\r\nThe foot have, besides, missile weapons, several to each man, which they\r\nhurl to an immense distance. [41] They are either naked, [42] or lightly\r\ncovered with a small mantle; and have no pride in equipage: their\r\nshields only are ornamented with the choicest colors. [43] Few are\r\nprovided with a coat of mail; [44] and scarcely here and there one with\r\na casque or helmet. [45] Their horses are neither remarkable for beauty\r\nnor swiftness, nor are they taught the various evolutions practised with\r\nus. The cavalry either bear down straight forwards, or wheel once to\r\nthe right, in so compact a body that none is left behind the rest. Their\r\nprincipal strength, on the whole, consists in their infantry: hence\r\nin an engagement these are intermixed with the cavalry; [46] so Well\r\naccordant with the nature of equestrian combats is the agility of those\r\nfoot soldiers, whom they select from the whole body of their youth,\r\nand place in the front of the line. Their number, too, is determined; a\r\nhundred from each canton: [47] and they are distinguished at home by a\r\nname expressive of this circumstance; so that what at first was only an\r\nappellation of number, becomes thenceforth a title of honor. Their line\r\nof battle is disposed in wedges. [48] To give ground, provided\r\nthey rally again, is considered rather as a prudent strategem, than\r\ncowardice. They carry off their slain even while the battle remains\r\nundecided. The greatest disgrace that can befall them is to have\r\nabandoned their shields. [49] A person branded with this ignominy is not\r\npermitted to join in their religious rites, or enter their assemblies;\r\nso that many, after escaping from battle, have put an end to their\r\ninfamy by the halter.\r\n\r\n7. In the election of kings they have regard to birth; in that of\r\ngenerals, [50] to valor. Their kings have not an absolute or unlimited\r\npower; [51] and their generals command less through the force of\r\nauthority, than of example. If they are daring, adventurous, and\r\nconspicuous in action, they procure obedience from the admiration they\r\ninspire. None, however, but the priests [52] are permitted to judge\r\noffenders, to inflict bonds or stripes; so that chastisement appears not\r\nas an act of military discipline, but as the instigation of the god whom\r\nthey suppose present with warriors. They also carry with them to battle\r\ncertain images and standards taken from the sacred groves. [53] It is\r\na principal incentive to their courage, that their squadrons and\r\nbattalions are not formed by men fortuitously collected, but by the\r\nassemblage of families and clans. Their pledges also are near at hand;\r\nthey have within hearing the yells of their women, and the cries of\r\ntheir children. These, too, are the most revered witnesses of each man's\r\nconduct, these his most liberal applauders. To their mothers and their\r\nwives they bring their wounds for relief, nor do these dread to count\r\nor to search out the gashes. The women also administer food and\r\nencouragement to those who are fighting.\r\n\r\n8. Tradition relates, that armies beginning to give way have been\r\nrallied by the females, through the earnestness of their supplications,\r\nthe interposition of their bodies, [54] and the pictures they have drawn\r\nof impending slavery, [55] a calamity which these people bear with more\r\nimpatience for their women than themselves; so that those states who\r\nhave been obliged to give among their hostages the daughters of noble\r\nfamilies, are the most effectually bound to fidelity. [56] They even\r\nsuppose somewhat of sanctity and prescience to be inherent in the female\r\nsex; and therefore neither despise their counsels, [57] nor disregard\r\ntheir responses. [58] We have beheld, in the reign of Vespasian, Veleda,\r\n[59] long reverenced by many as a deity. Aurima, moreover, and several\r\nothers, [60] were formerly held in equal veneration, but not with a\r\nservile flattery, nor as though they made them goddesses. [61]\r\n\r\n9. Of the gods, Mercury [62] is the principal object of their adoration;\r\nwhom, on certain days, [63] they think it lawful to propitiate even with\r\nhuman victims. To Hercules and Mars [64] they offer the animals usually\r\nallotted for sacrifice. [65] Some of the Suevi also perform sacred rites\r\nto Isis. What was the cause and origin of this foreign worship, I have\r\nnot been able to discover; further than that her being represented with\r\nthe symbol of a galley, seems to indicate an imported religion. [66]\r\nThey conceive it unworthy the grandeur of celestial beings to confine\r\ntheir deities within walls, or to represent them under a human\r\nsimilitude: [67] woods and groves are their temples; and they affix\r\nnames of divinity to that secret power, which they behold with the eye\r\nof adoration alone.\r\n\r\n10. No people are more addicted to divination by omens and lots. The\r\nlatter is performed in the following simple manner. They cut a twig [68]\r\nfrom a fruit-tree, and divide it into small pieces, which, distinguished\r\nby certain marks, are thrown promiscuously upon a white garment. Then,\r\nthe priest of the canton, if the occasion be public; if private, the\r\nmaster of the family; after an invocation of the gods, with his eyes\r\nlifted up to heaven, thrice takes out each piece, and, as they come up,\r\ninterprets their signification according to the marks fixed upon them.\r\nIf the result prove unfavorable, there is no more consultation on the\r\nsame affair that day; if propitious, a confirmation by omens is still\r\nrequired. In common with other nations, the Germans are acquainted with\r\nthe practice of auguring from the notes and flight of birds; but it is\r\npeculiar to them to derive admonitions and presages from horses also.\r\n[69] Certain of these animals, milk-white, and untouched by earthly\r\nlabor, are pastured at the public expense in the sacred woods and\r\ngroves. These, yoked to a consecrated chariot, are accompanied by the\r\npriest, and king, or chief person of the community, who attentively\r\nobserve their manner of neighing and snorting; and no kind of augury\r\nis more credited, not only among the populace, but among the nobles\r\nand priests. For the latter consider themselves as the ministers of\r\nthe gods, and the horses, as privy to the divine will. Another kind of\r\ndivination, by which they explore the event of momentous wars, is to\r\noblige a prisoner, taken by any means whatsoever from the nation with\r\nwhom they are at variance, to fight with a picked man of their own, each\r\nwith his own country's arms; and, according as the victory falls, they\r\npresage success to the one or to the other party. [70]\r\n\r\n11. On affairs of smaller moment, the chiefs consult; on those of\r\ngreater importance, the whole community; yet with this circumstance,\r\nthat what is referred to the decision of the people, is first maturely\r\ndiscussed by the chiefs. [71] They assemble, unless upon some sudden\r\nemergency, on stated days, either at the new or full moon, which they\r\naccount the most auspicious season for beginning any enterprise. Nor do\r\nthey, in their computation of time, reckon, like us, by the number of\r\ndays, but of nights. In this way they arrange their business; in this\r\nway they fix their appointments; so that, with them, the night seems to\r\nlead the day. [72] An inconvenience produced by their liberty is, that\r\nthey do not all assemble at a stated time, as if it were in obedience\r\nto a command; but two or three days are lost in the delays of convening.\r\nWhen they all think fit, [73] they sit down armed. [74] Silence is\r\nproclaimed by the priests, who have on this occasion a coercive power.\r\nThen the king, or chief, and such others as are conspicuous for age,\r\nbirth, military renown, or eloquence, are heard; and gain attention\r\nrather from their ability to persuade, than their authority to command.\r\nIf a proposal displease, the assembly reject it by an inarticulate\r\nmurmur; if it prove agreeable, they clash their javelins; [75] for the\r\nmost honorable expression of assent among them is the sound of arms.\r\n\r\n12. Before this council, it is likewise allowed to exhibit accusations,\r\nand to prosecute capital offences. Punishments are varied according to\r\nthe nature of the crime. Traitors and deserters are hung upon trees:\r\n[76] cowards, dastards, [77] and those guilty of unnatural practices,\r\n[78] are suffocated in mud under a hurdle. [79] This difference of\r\npunishment has in view the principle, that villainy should be exposed\r\nwhile it is punished, but turpitude concealed. The penalties annexed\r\nto slighter offences [80] are also proportioned to the delinquency. The\r\nconvicts are fined in horses and cattle: [81] part of the mulct [82]\r\ngoes to the king or state; part to the injured person, or his relations.\r\nIn the same assemblies chiefs [83] are also elected, to administer\r\njustice through the cantons and districts. A hundred companions, chosen\r\nfrom the people, attended upon each of them, to assist them as well with\r\ntheir advice as their authority.\r\n\r\n13. The Germans transact no business, public or private, without being\r\narmed: [84] but it is not customary for any person to assume arms till\r\nthe state has approved his ability to use them. Then, in the midst of\r\nthe assembly, either one of the chiefs, or the father, or a relation,\r\nequips the youth with a shield and javelin. [85] These are to them the\r\nmanly gown; [86] this is the first honor conferred on youth: before this\r\nthey are considered as part of a household; afterwards, of the state.\r\nThe dignity of chieftain is bestowed even on mere lads, whose descent is\r\neminently illustrious, or whose fathers have performed signal services\r\nto the public; they are associated, however, with those of mature\r\nstrength, who have already been declared capable of service; nor do\r\nthey blush to be seen in the rank of companions. [87] For the state of\r\ncompanionship itself has its several degrees, determined by the judgment\r\nof him whom they follow; and there is a great emulation among the\r\ncompanions, which shall possess the highest place in the favor of their\r\nchief; and among the chiefs, which shall excel in the number and valor\r\nof his companions. It is their dignity, their strength, to be always\r\nsurrounded with a large body of select youth, an ornament in peace,\r\na bulwark in war. And not in his own country alone, but among the\r\nneighboring states, the fame and glory of each chief consists in being\r\ndistinguished for the number and bravery of his companions. Such chiefs\r\nare courted by embassies; distinguished by presents; and often by their\r\nreputation alone decide a war.\r\n\r\n14. In the field of battle, it is disgraceful for the chief to be\r\nsurpassed in valor; it is disgraceful for the companions not to equal\r\ntheir chief; but it is reproach and infamy during a whole succeeding\r\nlife to retreat from the field surviving him. [88] To aid, to protect\r\nhim; to place their own gallant actions to the account of his glory, is\r\ntheir first and most sacred engagement. The chiefs fight for victory;\r\nthe companions for their chief. If their native country be long sunk in\r\npeace and inaction, many of the young nobles repair to some other state\r\nthen engaged in war. For, besides that repose is unwelcome to their\r\nrace, and toils and perils afford them a better opportunity of\r\ndistinguishing themselves; they are unable, without war and violence,\r\nto maintain a large train of followers. The companion requires from the\r\nliberality of his chief, the warlike steed, the bloody and conquering\r\nspear: and in place of pay, he expects to be supplied with a table,\r\nhomely indeed, but plentiful. [89] The funds for this munificence\r\nmust be found in war and rapine; nor are they so easily persuaded\r\nto cultivate the earth, and await the produce of the seasons, as to\r\nchallenge the foe, and expose themselves to wounds; nay, they even think\r\nit base and spiritless to earn by sweat what they might purchase with\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n15. During the intervals of war, they pass their time less in hunting\r\nthan in a sluggish repose, [90] divided between sleep and the table.\r\nAll the bravest of the warriors, committing the care of the house, the\r\nfamily affairs, and the lands, to the women, old men, and weaker part\r\nof the domestics, stupefy themselves in inaction: so wonderful is the\r\ncontrast presented by nature, that the same persons love indolence,\r\nand hate tranquillity! [91] It is customary for the several states to\r\npresent, by voluntary and individual contributions, [92] cattle or grain\r\n[93] to their chiefs; which are accepted as honorary gifts, while they\r\nserve as necessary supplies. [94] They are peculiarly pleased with\r\npresents from neighboring nations, offered not only by individuals,\r\nbut by the community at large; such as fine horses, heavy armor, rich\r\nhousings, and gold chains. We have now taught them also to accept of\r\nmoney. [95]\r\n\r\n16. It is well known that none of the German nations inhabit cities;\r\n[96] or even admit of contiguous settlements. They dwell scattered and\r\nseparate, as a spring, a meadow, or a grove may chance to invite\r\nthem. Their villages are laid out, not like ours in rows of adjoining\r\nbuildings; but every one surrounds his house with a vacant space, [97]\r\neither by way of security against fire, [97] or through ignorance of\r\nthe art of building. For, indeed, they are unacquainted with the use\r\nof mortar and tiles; and for every purpose employ rude unshapen timber,\r\nfashioned with no regard to pleasing the eye. They bestow more than\r\nordinary pains in coating certain parts of their buildings with a kind\r\nof earth, so pure and shining that it gives the appearance of painting.\r\nThey also dig subterraneous caves, [99] and cover them over with a great\r\nquantity of dung. These they use as winter-retreats, and granaries; for\r\nthey preserve a moderate temperature; and upon an invasion, when the\r\nopen country is plundered, these recesses remain unviolated, either\r\nbecause the enemy is ignorant of them, or because he will not trouble\r\nhimself with the search. [100]\r\n\r\n17. The clothing common to all is a sagum [101] fastened by a clasp, or,\r\nin want of that, a thorn. With no other covering, they pass whole days\r\non the hearth, before the fire. The more wealthy are distinguished by a\r\nvest, not flowing loose, like those of the Sarmatians and Parthians, but\r\ngirt close, and exhibiting the shape of every limb. They also wear the\r\nskins of beasts, which the people near the borders are less curious in\r\nselecting or preparing than the more remote inhabitants, who cannot by\r\ncommerce procure other clothing. These make choice of particular skins,\r\nwhich they variegate with spots, and strips of the furs of marine\r\nanimals, [102] the produce of the exterior ocean, and seas to us\r\nunknown. [103] The dress of the women does not differ from that of the\r\nmen; except that they more frequently wear linen, [104] which they stain\r\nwith purple; [105] and do not lengthen their upper garment into sleeves,\r\nbut leave exposed the whole arm, and part of the breast.\r\n\r\n18. The matrimonial bond is, nevertheless, strict and severe among them;\r\nnor is there anything in their manners more commendable than this. [106]\r\nAlmost singly among the barbarians, they content themselves with one\r\nwife; a very few of them excepted, who, not through incontinence, but\r\nbecause their alliance is solicited on account of their rank, [107]\r\npractise polygamy. The wife does not bring a dowry to her husband, but\r\nreceives one from him. [108] The parents and relations assemble, and\r\npass their approbation on the presents--presents not adapted to please\r\na female taste, or decorate the bride; but oxen, a caparisoned steed, a\r\nshield, spear, and sword. By virtue of these, the wife is espoused; and\r\nshe in her turn makes a present of some arms to her husband. This they\r\nconsider as the firmest bond of union; these, the sacred mysteries,\r\nthe conjugal deities. That the woman may not think herself excused from\r\nexertions of fortitude, or exempt from the casualties of war, she is\r\nadmonished by the very ceremonial of her marriage, that she comes to her\r\nhusband as a partner in toils and dangers; to suffer and to dare equally\r\nwith him, in peace and in war: this is indicated by the yoked oxen, the\r\nharnessed steed, the offered arms. Thus she is to live; thus to die.\r\nShe receives what she is to return inviolate [109] and honored to her\r\nchildren; what her daughters-in-law are to receive, and again transmit\r\nto her grandchildren.\r\n\r\n19. They live, therefore, fenced around with chastity; [110] corrupted\r\nby no seductive spectacles, [111] no convivial incitements. Men and\r\nwomen are alike unacquainted with clandestine correspondence. Adultery\r\nis extremely rare among so numerous a people. Its punishment is instant,\r\nand at the pleasure of the husband. He cuts off the hair [112] of the\r\noffender, strips her, and in presence of her relations expels her from\r\nhis house, and pursues her with stripes through the whole village. [113]\r\nNor is any indulgence shown to a prostitute. Neither beauty, youth, nor\r\nriches can procure her a husband: for none there looks on vice with\r\na smile, or calls mutual seduction the way of the world. Still more\r\nexemplary is the practice of those states [114] in which none but\r\nvirgins marry, and the expectations and wishes of a wife are at once\r\nbrought to a period. Thus, they take one husband as one body and one\r\nlife; that no thought, no desire, may extend beyond him; and he may be\r\nloved not only as their husband, but as their marriage. [115] To limit\r\nthe increase of children, [116] or put to death any of the later progeny\r\n[117] is accounted infamous: and good habits have there more influence\r\nthan good laws elsewhere. [118]\r\n\r\n20. In every house the children grow up, thinly and meanly clad, [119]\r\nto that bulk of body and limb which we behold with wonder. Every mother\r\nsuckles her own children, and does not deliver them into the hands of\r\nservants and nurses. No indulgence distinguishes the young master from\r\nthe slave. They lie together amidst the same cattle, upon the same\r\nground, till age [120] separates, and valor marks out, the free-born.\r\nThe youths partake late of the pleasures of love, [121] and hence\r\npass the age of puberty unexhausted: nor are the virgins hurried into\r\nmarriage; the same maturity, the same full growth is required: the sexes\r\nunite equally matched [122] and robust; and the children inherit the\r\nvigor of their parents. Children are regarded with equal affection by\r\ntheir maternal uncles [123] as by their fathers: some even consider\r\nthis as the more sacred bond of consanguinity, and prefer it in the\r\nrequisition of hostages, as if it held the mind by a firmer tie, and the\r\nfamily by a more extensive obligation. A person's own children, however,\r\nare his heirs and successors; and no wills are made. If there be no\r\nchildren, the next in order of inheritance are brothers, paternal and\r\nmaternal uncles. The more numerous are a man's relations and kinsmen,\r\nthe more comfortable is his old age; nor is it here any advantage to be\r\nchildless. [124]\r\n\r\n21. It is an indispensable duty to adopt the enmities [125] of a father\r\nor relation, as well as their friendships: these, however, are not\r\nirreconcilable or perpetual. Even homicide is atoned [126] by a certain\r\nfine in cattle and sheep; and the whole family accepts the satisfaction,\r\nto the advantage of the public weal, since quarrels are most dangerous\r\nin a free state. No people are more addicted to social entertainments,\r\nor more liberal in the exercise of hospitality. [127] To refuse any\r\nperson whatever admittance under their roof, is accounted flagitious.\r\n[128] Every one according to his ability feasts his guest: when his\r\nprovisions are exhausted, he who was late the host, is now the guide\r\nand companion to another hospitable board. They enter the next house\r\nuninvited, and are received with equal cordiality. No one makes a\r\ndistinction with respect to the rights of hospitality, between a\r\nstranger and an acquaintance. The departing guest is presented with\r\nwhatever he may ask for; and with the same freedom a boon is desired in\r\nreturn. They are pleased with presents; but think no obligation incurred\r\neither when they give or receive.\r\n\r\n22. [129] [Their manner of living with their guest is easy and affable]\r\nAs soon as they arise from sleep, which they generally protract till\r\nlate in the day, they bathe, usually in warm water, [130] as cold\r\nweather chiefly prevails there. After bathing they take their meal, each\r\non a distinct seat, and a a separate table. [131] Then they proceed,\r\narmed, to business, and not less frequently to convivial parties, in\r\nwhich it is no disgrace to pass days and nights, without intermission,\r\nin drinking. The frequent quarrels that arise amongst them, when\r\nintoxicated, seldom terminate in abusive language, but more frequently\r\nin blood. [132] In their feasts, they generally deliberate on the\r\nreconcilement of enemies, on family alliances, on the appointment of\r\nchiefs, and finally on peace and war; conceiving that at no time the\r\nsoul is more opened to sincerity, or warmed to heroism. These people,\r\nnaturally void of artifice or disguise, disclose the most secret\r\nemotions of their hearts in the freedom of festivity. The minds of all\r\nbeing thus displayed without reserve, the subjects of their deliberation\r\nare again canvassed the next day; [133] and each time has its\r\nadvantages. They consult when unable to dissemble; they determine when\r\nnot liable to mistake.\r\n\r\n23. Their drink is a liquor prepared from barley or wheat [134] brought\r\nby fermentation to a certain resemblance of wine. Those who border on\r\nthe Rhine also purchase wine. Their food is simple; wild fruits, fresh\r\nvenison, [135] or coagulated milk. [136] They satisfy hunger without\r\nseeking the elegances and delicacies of the table. Their thirst for\r\nliquor is not quenched with equal moderation. If their propensity to\r\ndrunkenness be gratified to the extent of their wishes, intemperance\r\nproves as effectual in subduing them as the force of arms. [137]\r\n\r\n24. They have only one kind of public spectacle, which is exhibited\r\nin every company. Young men, who make it their diversion, dance naked\r\namidst drawn swords and presented spears. Practice has conferred skill\r\nat this exercise; and skill has given grace; but they do not exhibit for\r\nhire or gain: the only reward of this pastime, though a hazardous one,\r\nis the pleasure of the spectators. What is extraordinary, they play at\r\ndice, when sober, as a serious business: and that with such a desperate\r\nventure of gain or loss, that, when everything else is gone, they set\r\ntheir liberties and persons on the last throw. The loser goes into\r\nvoluntary servitude; and, though the youngest and strongest, patiently\r\nsuffers himself to be bound and sold. [138] Such is their obstinacy in\r\na bad practice--they themselves call it honor. The slaves thus acquired\r\nare exchanged away in commerce, that the winner may get rid of the\r\nscandal of his victory.\r\n\r\n25. The rest of their slaves have not, like ours, particular employments\r\nin the family allotted them. Each is the master of a habitation and\r\nhousehold of his own. The lord requires from him a certain quantity\r\nof grain, cattle, or cloth, as from a tenant; and so far only the\r\nsubjection of the slave extends. [139] His domestic offices are\r\nperformed by his own wife and children. It is usual to scourge a slave,\r\nor punish him with chains or hard labor. They are sometimes killed by\r\ntheir masters; not through severity of chastisement, but in the heat\r\nof passion, like an enemy; with this difference, that it is done with\r\nimpunity. [140] Freedmen are little superior to slaves; seldom filling\r\nany important office in the family; never in the state, except in those\r\ntribes which are under regal government. [141] There, they rise above\r\nthe free-born, and even the nobles: in the rest, the subordinate\r\ncondition of the freedmen is a proof of freedom.\r\n\r\n26. Lending money upon interest, and increasing it by usury, [142] is\r\nunknown amongst them: and this ignorance more effectually prevents\r\nthe practice than a prohibition would do. The lands are occupied\r\nby townships, [143] in allotments proportional to the number of\r\ncultivators; and are afterwards parcelled out among the individuals\r\nof the district, in shares according to the rank and condition of each\r\nperson. [144] The wide extent of plain facilitates this partition. The\r\narable lands are annually changed, and a part left fallow; nor do they\r\nattempt to make the most of the fertility and plenty of the soil, by\r\ntheir own industry in planting orchards, inclosing meadows, and watering\r\ngardens. Corn is the only product required from the earth: hence their\r\nyear is not divided into so many seasons as ours; for, while they\r\nknow and distinguish by name Winter, Spring, and Summer, they are\r\nunacquainted equally with the appellation and bounty of Autumn. [145]\r\n\r\n27. Their funerals are without parade. [146] The only circumstance to\r\nwhich they attend, is to burn the bodies of eminent persons with some\r\nparticular kinds of wood. Neither vestments nor perfumes are heaped upon\r\nthe pile: [147] the arms of the deceased, and sometimes his horse, [148]\r\nare given to the flames. The tomb is a mound of turf. They contemn the\r\nelaborate and costly honours of monumental structures, as mere burthens\r\nto the dead. They soon dismiss tears and lamentations; slowly, sorrow\r\nand regret. They think it the women's part to bewail their friends, the\r\nmen's to remember them.\r\n\r\n28. This is the sum of what I have been able to learn concerning the\r\norigin and manners of the Germans in general. I now proceed to mention\r\nthose particulars in which they differ from each other; and likewise\r\nto relate what nations have migrated from Germany into Gaul. That great\r\nwriter, the deified Julius, asserts that the Gauls were formerly the\r\nsuperior people; [149] whence it is probable that some Gallic colonies\r\npassed over into Germany: for how small an obstacle would a river be\r\nto prevent any nation, as it increased in strength, from occupying or\r\nchanging settlements as yet lying in common, and unappropriated by the\r\npower of monarchies! Accordingly, the tract betwixt the Hercynian forest\r\nand the rivers Rhine and Mayne was possessed by the Helvetii: [150] and\r\nthat beyond, by the Boii; [151] both Gallic tribes. The name of\r\nBoiemum still remains, a memorial of the ancient settlement, though\r\nits inhabitants are now changed. [152] But whether the Aravisci [153]\r\nmigrated into Pannonia from the Osi, [154] a German nation; or the Osi\r\ninto Germany from the Aravisci; the language, institutions, and manners\r\nof both being still the same, is a matter of uncertainty; for, in their\r\npristine state of equal indigence and equal liberty, the same advantages\r\nand disadvantages were common to both sides of the river. The Treveri\r\n[155] and Nervii [156] are ambitious of being thought of German origin;\r\nas if the reputation of this descent would distinguish them from the\r\nGauls, whom they resemble in person and effeminacy. The Vangiones,\r\nTriboci, and Nemetes, [157] who inhabit the bank of the Rhine, are\r\nwithout doubt German tribes. Nor do the Ubii, [158] although they have\r\nbeen thought worthy of being made a Roman colony, and are pleased\r\nin bearing the name of Agrippinenses from their founder, blush to\r\nacknowledge their origin from Germany; from whence they formerly\r\nmigrated, and for their approved fidelity were settled on the bank of\r\nthe Rhine, not that they might be guarded themselves, but that they\r\nmight serve as a guard against invaders.\r\n\r\n29. Of all these people, the most famed for valor are the Batavi; whose\r\nterritories comprise but a small part of the banks of the Rhine, but\r\nconsist chiefly of an island within it. [159] These were formerly a\r\ntribe of the Catti, who, on account of an intestine division, removed\r\nto their present settlements, in order to become a part of the Roman\r\nempire. They still retain this honor, together with a memorial of their\r\nancient alliance; [160] for they are neither insulted by taxes, nor\r\noppressed by farmers of the revenue. Exempt from fiscal burthens and\r\nextraordinary contributions, and kept apart for military use alone,\r\nthey are reserved, like a magazine of arms, for the purposes of war. The\r\nnation of the Mattiaci [161] is under a degree of subjection of the same\r\nkind: for the greatness of the Roman people has carried a reverence\r\nfor the empire beyond the Rhine and the ancient limits. The Mattiaci,\r\ntherefore, though occupying a settlement and borders [162] on the\r\nopposite side of the river, from sentiment and attachment act with us;\r\nresembling the Batavi in every respect, except that they are animated\r\nwith a more vigorous spirit by the soil and air of their own country.\r\n[163] I do not reckon among the people of Germany those who occupy the\r\nDecumate lands, [164] although inhabiting between the Rhine and Danube.\r\nSome of the most fickle of the Gauls, rendered daring through indigence,\r\nseized upon this district of uncertain property. Afterwards,\r\nour boundary line being advanced, and a chain of fortified posts\r\nestablished, it became a skirt of the empire, and part of the Roman\r\nprovince. [165]\r\n\r\n30. Beyond these dwell the Catti, [166] whose settlements, beginning\r\nfrom the Hercynian forest, are in a tract of country less open and\r\nmarshy than those which overspread the other states of Germany; for\r\nit consists of a continued range of hills, which gradually become more\r\nscattered; and the Hercynian forest [167] both accompanies and leaves\r\nbehind, its Catti. This nation is distinguished by hardier frames, [168]\r\ncompactness of limb, fierceness of countenance, and superior vigor of\r\nmind. For Germans, they have a considerable share of understanding\r\nand sagacity; they choose able persons to command, and obey them when\r\nchosen; keep their ranks; seize opportunities; restrain impetuous\r\nmotions; distribute properly the business of the day; intrench\r\nthemselves against the night; account fortune dubious, and valor\r\nonly certain; and, what is extremely rare, and only a consequence of\r\ndiscipline, depend more upon the general than the army. [169] Their\r\nforce consists entirely in infantry; who, besides their arms, are\r\nobliged to carry tools and provisions. Other nations appear to go to\r\na battle; the Catti, to war. Excursions and casual encounters are rare\r\namongst them. It is, indeed, peculiar to cavalry soon to obtain, and\r\nsoon to yield, the victory. Speed borders upon timidity; slow movements\r\nare more akin to steady valor.\r\n\r\n31. A custom followed among the other German nations only by a few\r\nindividuals, of more daring spirit than the rest, is adopted by general\r\nconsent among the Catti. From the time they arrive at years of maturity\r\nthey let their hair and beard grow; [170] and do not divest themselves\r\nof this votive badge, the promise of valor, till they have slain an\r\nenemy. Over blood and spoils they unveil the countenance, and proclaim\r\nthat they have at length paid the debt of existence, and have proved\r\nthemselves worthy of their country and parents. The cowardly and\r\neffeminate continue in their squalid disguise. The bravest among them\r\nwear also an iron ring [171] (a mark of ignominy in that nation) as a\r\nkind of chain, till they have released themselves by the slaughter of a\r\nfoe. Many of the Catti assume this distinction, and grow hoary under\r\nthe mark, conspicuous both to foes and friends. By these, in every\r\nengagement, the attack is begun: they compose the front line, presenting\r\na new spectacle of terror. Even in peace they do not relax the sternness\r\nof their aspect. They have no house, land, or domestic cares: they\r\nare maintained by whomsoever they visit: lavish of another's property,\r\nregardless of their own; till the debility of age renders them unequal\r\nto such a rigid course of military virtue. [172]\r\n\r\n32. Next to the Catti, on the banks of the Rhine, where, now settled in\r\nits channel, it is become a sufficient boundary, dwell the Usipii and\r\nTencteri. [173] The latter people, in addition to the usual military\r\nreputation, are famed for the discipline of their cavalry; nor is\r\nthe infantry of the Catti in higher estimation than the horse of the\r\nTencteri. Their ancestors established it, and are imitated by posterity.\r\nHorsemanship is the sport of their children, the point of emulation of\r\ntheir youth, and the exercise in which they persevere to old age. Horses\r\nare bequeathed along with the domestics, the household gods, and the\r\nrights of inheritance: they do not, however, like other things, go to\r\nthe eldest son, but to the bravest and most warlike.\r\n\r\n33. Contiguous to the Tencteri were formerly the Bructeri; [174] but\r\nreport now says that the Chamavi and Angrivarii, [175] migrating into\r\ntheir country, have expelled and entirely extirpated them, [176] with\r\nthe concurrence of the neighboring nations, induced either by hatred of\r\ntheir arrogance, [177] love of plunder, or the favor of the gods towards\r\nthe Romans. For they even gratified us with the spectacle of a battle,\r\nin which above sixty thousand Germans were slain, not by Roman arms,\r\nbut, what was still grander, by mutual hostilities, as it were for our\r\npleasure and entertainment. [178] May the nations retain and perpetuate,\r\nif not an affection for us, at least an animosity against each other!\r\nsince, while the fate of the empire is thus urgent, [179] fortune can\r\nbestow no higher benefit upon us, than the discord of our enemies.\r\n\r\n34. Contiguous to the Angrivarii and Chamavi backwards lie the\r\nDulgibini, Chasauri, [180] and other nations less known. [181] In front,\r\nthe Frisii [182] succeed; who are distinguished by the appellations of\r\nGreater and Lesser, from their proportional power. The settlements of\r\nboth stretch along the border of the Rhine to the ocean; and include,\r\nbesides, vast lakes, [183] which have been navigated by Roman fleets. We\r\nhave even explored the ocean itself on that side; and fame reports that\r\ncolumns of Hercules [184] are still remaining on that coast; whether it\r\nbe that Hercules was ever there in reality, or that whatever great and\r\nmagnificent is anywhere met with is, by common consent, ascribed to\r\nhis renowned name. The attempt of Drusus Germanicus [185] to make\r\ndiscoveries in these parts was sufficiently daring; but the ocean\r\nopposed any further inquiry into itself and Hercules. After a while no\r\none renewed the attempt; and it was thought more pious and reverential\r\nto believe the actions of the gods, than to investigate them.\r\n\r\n35. Hitherto we have traced the western side of Germany. It turns from\r\nthence with a vast sweep to the north: and first occurs the country of\r\nthe Chauci, [186] which, though it begins immediately from Frisia, and\r\noccupies part of the seashore, yet stretches so far as to border on\r\nall the nations before mentioned, till it winds round so as to meet the\r\nterritories of the Catti. This immense tract is not only possessed, but\r\nfilled by the Chauci; a people the noblest of the Germans, who choose\r\nto maintain their greatness by justice rather than violence. Without\r\nambition, without ungoverned desires, quiet and retired, they provoke\r\nno wars, they are guilty of no rapine or plunder; and it is a principal\r\nproof of their power and bravery, that the superiority they possess has\r\nnot been acquired by unjust means. Yet all have arms in readiness; [187]\r\nand, if necessary, an army is soon raised: for they abound in men and\r\nhorses, and maintain their military reputation even in inaction.\r\n\r\n36. Bordering on the Chauci and Catti are the Cherusci; [188] who, for\r\nwant of an enemy, long cherished a too lasting and enfeebling peace:\r\na state more flattering than secure; since the repose enjoyed amidst\r\nambitious and powerful neighbors is treacherous; and when an appeal is\r\nmade to the sword, moderation and probity are names appropriated by the\r\nvictors. Thus, the Cherusci, who formerly bore the titles of just and\r\nupright, are now charged with cowardice and folly; and the good fortune\r\nof the Catti, who subdued them, has grown into wisdom. The ruin of the\r\nCherusci involved that of the Fosi, [189] a neighboring tribe, equal\r\npartakers of their adversity, although they had enjoyed an inferior\r\nshare of their prosperity.\r\n\r\n37. In the same quarter of Germany, adjacent to the ocean, dwell the\r\nCimbri; [191] a small [192] state at present, but great in renown. [193]\r\nOf their past grandeur extensive vestiges still remain, in encampments\r\nand lines on either shore, [194] from the compass of which the strength\r\nand numbers of the nation may still be computed, and credit derived to\r\nthe account of so prodigious an army. It was in the 640th year of Rome\r\nthat the arms of the Cimbri were first heard of, under the consulate\r\nof Caecilius Metellus and Papirius Carbo; from which era to the second\r\nconsulate of the emperor Trajan [195] is a period of nearly 210 years.\r\nSo long has Germany withstood the arms of Rome. During this long\r\ninterval many mutual wounds have been inflicted. Not the Samnite, the\r\nCarthaginian, Spain, Gaul, or Parthia, have given more frequent alarms;\r\nfor the liberty of the Germans is more vigorous than the monarchy of\r\nthe Arsacidae. What has the East, which has itself lost Pacorus, and\r\nsuffered an overthrow from Ventidius, [196] to boast against us, but\r\nthe slaughter of Crassus? But the Germans, by the defeat or capture of\r\nCarbo, [197] Cassius, [198] Scaurus Aurelius, [199] Servilius Caepio,\r\nand Cneius Manlius, [200] deprived the Roman people of five consular\r\narmies; [201] and afterwards took from Augustus himself Varus with three\r\nlegions. [202] Nor did Caius Marius [203] in Italy, the deified Julius\r\n[204] in Gaul, or Drusus, [204] Nero, [204] or Germanicus [204] in their\r\nown country, defeat then without loss. The subsequent mighty threats\r\nof Caligula terminated in ridicule. Then succeeded tranquillity; till,\r\nseizing the occasion of our discords and civil wars, they forced the\r\nwinter-quarters of the legions, [205] and even aimed at the possession\r\nof Gaul; and, again expelled thence, they have in latter times been\r\nrather triumphed over [206] than vanquished.\r\n\r\n38. We have now to speak of the Suevi; [207] who do not compose a single\r\nstate, like the Catti or Tencteri, but occupy the greatest part of\r\nGermany, and are still distributed into different names and nations,\r\nalthough all hearing the common appellation of Suevi. It is a\r\ncharacteristic of this people to turn their hair sideways, and tie it\r\nbeneath the poll in a knot. By this mark the Suevi are distinguished\r\nfrom the rest of the Germans; and the freemen of the Suevi from the\r\nslaves. [208] Among other nations, this mode, either on account of some\r\nrelationship with the Suevi, or from the usual propensity to imitation,\r\nis sometimes adopted; but rarely, and only during the period of youth.\r\nThe Suevi, even till they are hoary, continue to have their hair growing\r\nstiffly backwards, and often it is fastened on the very crown of the\r\nhead. The chiefs dress it with still greater care: and in this respect\r\nthey study ornament, though of an undebasing kind. For their design is\r\nnot to make love, or inspire it; they decorate themselves in this manner\r\nas they proceed to war, in order to seem taller and more terrible; and\r\ndress for the eyes of their enemies.\r\n\r\n39. The Semnones [209] assert themselves to be the most ancient and\r\nnoble of the Suevi; and their pretensions are confirmed by religion.\r\nAt a stated time, all the people of the same lineage assemble by their\r\ndelegates in a wood, consecrated by the auguries of their forefathers\r\nand ancient terror, and there by the public slaughter of a human victim\r\ncelebrate the horrid origin of their barbarous rites. Another kind of\r\nreverence is paid to the grove. No person enters it without being bound\r\nwith a chain, as an acknowledgment of his inferior nature, and the power\r\nof the deity residing there. If he accidentally fall, it is not lawful\r\nfor him to be lifted or to rise up; they roll themselves out along the\r\nground. The whole of their superstition has this import: that from this\r\nspot the nation derives its origin; that here is the residence of the\r\nDeity, the Governor of all, and that everything else is subject and\r\nsubordinate to him. These opinions receive additional authority from\r\nthe power of the Semnones, who inhabit a hundred cantons, and, from the\r\ngreat body they compose, consider themselves as the head of the Suevi.\r\n\r\n40. The Langobardi, [210] on the other hand, are ennobled by, the\r\nsmallness of their numbers; since though surrounded by many powerful\r\nnations, they derive security, not from obsequiousness, but from their\r\nmartial enterprise. The neighboring Reudigni, [211] and the Avions,\r\n[212] Angli, [213] Varini, Eudoses, Suardones, and Nuithones, [214]\r\nare defended by rivers or forests. Nothing remarkable occurs in any of\r\nthese; except that they unite in the worship of Hertha, [215] or Mother\r\nEarth; and suppose her to interfere in the affairs of men, and to visit\r\nthe different nations. In an island [216] of the ocean stands a sacred\r\nand unviolated grove, in which is a consecrated chariot, covered with a\r\nveil, which the priest alone is permitted to touch. He becomes conscious\r\nof the entrance of the goddess into this secret recess; and with\r\nprofound veneration attends the vehicle, which is drawn by yoked cows.\r\nAt this season, [217] all is joy; and every place which the goddess\r\ndeigns to visit is a scene of festivity. No wars are undertaken; arms\r\nare untouched; and every hostile weapon is shut up. Peace abroad and\r\nat home are then only known; then only loved; till at length the same\r\npriest reconducts the goddess, satiated with mortal intercourse, to her\r\ntemple. [218] The chariot, with its curtain, and, if we may believe it,\r\nthe goddess herself, then undergo ablution in a secret lake. This office\r\nis performed by slaves, whom the same lake instantly swallows up. Hence\r\nproceeds a mysterious horror; and a holy ignorance of what that can be,\r\nwhich is beheld only by those who are about to perish. This part of the\r\nSuevian nation extends to the most remote recesses of Germany.\r\n\r\n41. If we now follow the course of the Danube, as we before did that of\r\nthe Rhine, we first meet with the Hermunduri; [219] a people faithful to\r\nthe Romans, [220] and on that account the only Germans who are admitted\r\nto commerce, not on the bank alone, but within our territories, and in\r\nthe flourishing colony [221] established in the province of Rhaetia.\r\nThey pass and repass at pleasure, without being attended by a guard; and\r\nwhile we exhibit to other nations our arms and camps alone, to these\r\nwe lay open our houses and country seats, which they behold without\r\ncoveting. In the country of the Hermunduri rises the Elbe; [222] a river\r\nformerly celebrated and known among us, now only heard of by name.\r\n\r\n42. Contiguous to the Hermunduri are the Narisci; [223] and next to\r\nthem, the Marcomanni [224] and Quadi. [225] Of these, the Marcomanni are\r\nthe most powerful and renowned; and have even acquired the country which\r\nthey inhabit, by their valor in expelling the Boii. [226] Nor are the\r\nNarisci and Quadi inferior in bravery; [227] and this is, as it were,\r\nthe van of Germany as far as it is bordered by the Danube. Within our\r\nmemory the Marcomanni and Quadi were governed by kings of their own\r\nnation, of the noble line of Maroboduus [228] and Tudrus. They now\r\nsubmit even to foreigners; but all the power of their kings depends upon\r\nthe authority of the Romans. [229] We seldom assist them with our arms,\r\nbut frequently with our money; nor are they the less potent on that\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n43. Behind these are the Marsigni, [230] Gothini, [231] Osi, [232] and\r\nBurrii, [233] who close the rear of the Marcomanni and Quadi. Of these,\r\nthe Marsigni and Burrii in language [234] and dress resemble the Suevi.\r\nThe Gothini and Osi prove themselves not to be Germans; the first, by\r\ntheir use of the Gallic, the second, of the Pannonian tongue; and both,\r\nby their submitting to pay tribute: which is levied on them, as aliens,\r\npartly by the Sarmatians, partly by the Quadi. The Gothini, to their\r\nadditional disgrace, work iron mines. [235] All these people inhabit but\r\na small proportion of champaign country; their settlements are chiefly\r\namongst forests, and on the sides and summits of mountains; for a\r\ncontinued ridge of mountains [236] separates Suevia from various remoter\r\ntribes. Of these, the Lygian [237] is the most extensive, and diffuses\r\nits name through several communities. It will be sufficient to name\r\nthe most powerful of them--the Arii, Helvecones, Manimi, Elysii, and\r\nNaharvali. [238] In the country of the latter is a grove, consecrated to\r\nreligious rites of great antiquity. A priest presides over them, dressed\r\nin woman's apparel; but the gods worshipped there are said, according to\r\nthe Roman interpretation, to be Castor and Pollux. Their attributes are\r\nthe same; their name, Alcis. [239] No images, indeed, or vestiges of\r\nforeign superstition, appear in their worship; but they are revered\r\nunder the character of young men and brothers. The Arii, fierce beyond\r\nthe superiority of strength they possess over the other just enumerated\r\npeople, improve their natural ferocity of aspect by artificial helps.\r\nTheir shields are black; their bodies painted: [240] they choose the\r\ndarkest nights for an attack; and strike terror by the funereal gloom of\r\ntheir sable bands--no enemy being able to sustain their singular, and,\r\nas it were, infernal appearance; since in every combat the eyes are the\r\nfirst part subdued. Beyond the Lygii are the Gothones, [241] who live\r\nunder a monarchy, somewhat more strict than that of the other German\r\nnations, yet not to a degree incompatible with liberty. Adjoining\r\nto these are the Rugii [242] and Lemovii, [243] situated on the\r\nsea-coast--all these tribes are distinguished by round shields, short\r\nswords, and submission to regal authority.\r\n\r\n44. Next occur the communities of the Suiones, [244] seated in the very\r\nOcean, [245] who, besides their strength in men and arms, also possess a\r\nnaval force. [246] The form of their vessels differs from ours in having\r\na prow at each end, [247] so that they are always ready to advance. They\r\nmake no use of sails, nor have regular benches of oars at the sides:\r\nthey row, as is practised in some rivers, without order, sometimes on\r\none side, sometimes on the other, as occasion requires. These people\r\nhonor wealth; [248] for which reason they are subject to monarchical\r\ngovernment, without any limitations, [249] or precarious conditions of\r\nallegiance. Nor are arms allowed to be kept promiscuously, as among the\r\nother German nations: but are committed to the charge of a keeper, and\r\nhe, too, a slave. The pretext is, that the Ocean defends them from any\r\nsudden incursions; and men unemployed, with arms in their hands, readily\r\nbecome licentious. In fact, it is for the king's interest not to entrust\r\na noble, a freeman, or even an emancipated slave, with the custody of\r\narms.\r\n\r\n45. Beyond the Suiones is another sea, sluggish and almost stagnant,\r\n[250] by which the whole globe is imagined to be girt and enclosed, from\r\nthis circumstance, that the last light of the setting sun continues so\r\nvivid till its rising, as to obscure the stars. [251] Popular belief\r\nadds, that the sound of his emerging [252] from the ocean is also heard;\r\nand the forms of deities, [253] with the rays beaming from his head, are\r\nbeheld. Only thus far, report says truly, does nature extend. [254] On\r\nthe right shore of the Suevic sea [255] dwell the tribes of the Aestii,\r\n[256] whose dress and customs are the same with those of the Suevi, but\r\ntheir language more resembles the British. [257] They worship the mother\r\nof the gods; [258] and as the symbol of their superstition, they carry\r\nabout them the figures of wild boars. [250] This serves them in place of\r\narmor and every other defence: it renders the votary of the goddess safe\r\neven in the midst of foes. Their weapons are chiefly clubs, iron being\r\nlittle used among them. They cultivate corn and other fruits of the\r\nearth with more industry than German indolence commonly exerts. [260]\r\nThey even explore the sea; and are the only people who gather amber,\r\nwhich by them is called _Glese_, [261] and is collected among the\r\nshallows and upon the shore. [262] With the usual indifference of\r\nbarbarians, they have not inquired or ascertained from what natural\r\nobject or by what means it is produced. It long lay disregarded [263]\r\namidst other things thrown up by the sea, till our luxury [264] gave\r\nit a name. Useless to them, they gather it in the rough; bring it\r\nunwrought; and wonder at the price they receive. It would appear,\r\nhowever, to be an exudation from certain trees; since reptiles, and even\r\nwinged animals, are often seen shining through it, which, entangled\r\nin it while in a liquid state, became enclosed as it hardened. [264] I\r\nshould therefore imagine that, as the luxuriant woods and groves in the\r\nsecret recesses of the East exude frankincense and balsam, so there are\r\nthe same in the islands and continents of the West; which, acted upon\r\nby the near rays of the sun, drop their liquid juices into the subjacent\r\nsea, whence, by the force of tempests, they are thrown out upon the\r\nopposite coasts. If the nature of amber be examined by the application\r\nof fire, it kindles like a torch, with a thick and odorous flame; and\r\npresently resolves into a glutinous matter resembling pitch or resin.\r\nThe several communities of the Sitones [266] succeed those of the\r\nSuiones; to whom they are similar in other respects, but differ in\r\nsubmitting to a female reign; so far have they degenerated, not only\r\nfrom liberty, but even from slavery. Here Suevia terminates.\r\n\r\n46. I am in doubt whether to reckon the Peucini, Venedi, and Fenni among\r\nthe Germans or Sarmatians; [267] although the Peucini, [268] who are by\r\nsome called Bastarnae, agree with the Germans in language, apparel,\r\nand habitations. [269] All of them live in filth and laziness. The\r\nintermarriages of their chiefs with the Sarmatians have debased them\r\nby a mixture of the manners of that people. [270] The Venedi have\r\ndrawn much from this source; [271] for they overrun in their predatory\r\nexcursions all the woody and mountainous tracts between the Peucini and\r\nFenni. Yet even these are rather to be referred to the Germans, since\r\nthey build houses, carry shields, and travel with speed on foot; in\r\nall which particulars they totally differ from the Sarmatians, who pass\r\ntheir time in wagons and on horseback. [272] The Fenni [273] live in a\r\nstate of amazing savageness and squalid poverty. They are destitute\r\nof arms, horses, and settled abodes: their food is herbs; [274] their\r\nclothing, skins; their bed, the ground. Their only dependence is on\r\ntheir arrows, which, for want of iron, are headed with bone; [275] and\r\nthe chase is the support of the women as well as the men; the former\r\naccompany the latter in the pursuit, and claim a share of the prey. Nor\r\ndo they provide any other shelter for their infants from wild beasts and\r\nstorms, than a covering of branches twisted together. This is the resort\r\nof youth; this is the receptacle of old age. Yet even this way of life\r\nis in their estimation happier than groaning over the plough; toiling\r\nin the erection of houses; subjecting their own fortunes and those of\r\nothers to the agitations of alternate hope and fear. Secure against men,\r\nsecure against the gods, they have attained the most difficult point,\r\nnot to need even a wish.\r\n\r\nAll our further accounts are intermixed with fable; as, that the\r\nHellusii and Oxionae [276] have human faces, with the bodies and limbs\r\nof wild beasts. These unauthenticated reports I shall leave untouched.\r\n[277]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF CNAEUS JULIUS AGRICOLA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[This work is supposed by the commentators to have been written before\r\nthe treatise on the manners of the Germans, in the third consulship of\r\nthe emperor Nerva, and the second of Verginius Rufus, in the year of\r\nRome 850, and of the Christian era 97. Brotier accedes to this opinion;\r\nbut the reason which he assigns does not seem to be satisfactory. He\r\nobserves that Tacitus, in the third section, mentions the emperor Nerva;\r\nbut as he does not call him Divus Nerva, the deified Nerva, the learned\r\ncommentator infers that Nerva was still living. This reasoning might\r\nhave some weight, if we did not read, in section 44, that it was the\r\nardent wish of Agricola that he might live to behold Trajan in the\r\nimperial seat. If Nerva was then alive, the wish to see another in his\r\nroom would have been an awkward compliment to the reigning prince. It\r\nis, perhaps, for this reason that Lipsius thinks this very elegant tract\r\nwas written at the same time with the Manners of the Germans, in the\r\nbeginning of the emperor Trajan. The question is not very material,\r\nsince conjecture alone must decide it. The piece itself is admitted to\r\nbe a masterpiece in the kind. Tacitus was son-in-law to Agricola; and\r\nwhile filial piety breathes through his work, he never departs from\r\nthe integrity of his own character. He has left an historical monument\r\nhighly interesting to every Briton, who wishes to know the manners of\r\nhis ancestors, and the spirit of liberty that from the earliest time\r\ndistinguished the natives of Britain. \"Agricola,\" as Hume observes, \"was\r\nthe general who finally established the dominion of the Romans in this\r\nisland. He governed, it in the reigns of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian.\r\nHe carried his victorious arms northward: defeated the Britons in every\r\nencounter, pierced into the forests and the mountains of Caledonia,\r\nreduced every state to subjection in the southern parts of the island,\r\nand chased before him all the men of fiercer and more intractable\r\nspirits, who deemed war and death itself less intolerable than servitude\r\nunder the victors. He defeated them in a decisive action, which they\r\nfought under Galgacus; and having fixed a chain of garrisons between the\r\nfriths of Clyde and Forth, he cut off the ruder and more barren parts\r\nof the island, and secured the Roman province from the incursions of the\r\nbarbarous inhabitants. During these military enterprises he neglected\r\nnot the arts of peace. He introduced laws and civility among the\r\nBritons; taught them to desire and raise all the conveniences of life;\r\nreconciled them to the Roman language and manners; instructed them\r\nin letters and science; and employed every expedient to render those\r\nchains, which he had forged, both easy and agreeable to them.\" (Hume's\r\nHist. vol. i. p. 9.) In this passage Mr. Hume has given a summary of the\r\nLife of Agricola. It is extended by Tacitus in a style more open than\r\nthe didactic form of the essay on the German Manners required, but\r\nstill with the precision, both in sentiment and diction, peculiar to\r\nthe author. In rich but subdued colors he gives a striking picture of\r\nAgricola, leaving to posterity a portion of history which it would be\r\nin vain to seek in the dry gazette style of Suetonius, or in the page of\r\nany writer of that period.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The ancient custom of transmitting to posterity the actions and\r\nmanners of famous men, has not been neglected even by the present age,\r\nincurious though it be about those belonging to it, whenever any exalted\r\nand noble degree of virtue has triumphed over that false estimation\r\nof merit, and that ill-will to it, by which small and great states\r\nare equally infested. In former times, however, as there was a greater\r\npropensity and freer scope for the performance of actions worthy of\r\nremembrance, so every person of distinguished abilities was induced\r\nthrough conscious satisfaction in the task alone, without regard to\r\nprivate favor or interest, to record examples of virtue. And many\r\nconsidered it rather as the honest confidence of integrity, than a\r\nculpable arrogance, to become their own biographers. Of this, Rutilius\r\nand Scaurus [1] were instances; who were never yet censured on this\r\naccount, nor was the fidelity of their narrative called in question; so\r\nmuch more candidly are virtues always estimated; in those periods which\r\nare the most favorable to their production. For myself, however, who\r\nhave undertaken to be the historian of a person deceased, an apology\r\nseemed necessary; which I should not have made, had my course lain\r\nthrough times less cruel and hostile to virtue. [2]\r\n\r\n2. We read that when Arulenus Rusticus published the praises of Paetus\r\nThrasea, and Herennius Senecio those of Priscus Helvidius, it was\r\nconstrued into a capital crime; [3] and the rage of tyranny was let\r\nloose not only against the authors, but against their writings; so that\r\nthose monuments of exalted genius were burnt at the place of election\r\nin the forum by triumvirs appointed for the purpose. In that fire they\r\nthought to consume the voice of the Roman people, the freedom of the\r\nsenate, and the conscious emotions of all mankind; crowning the deed\r\nby the expulsion of the professors of wisdom, [4] and the banishment of\r\nevery liberal art, that nothing generous or honorable might remain. We\r\ngave, indeed, a consummate proof of our patience; and as remote ages saw\r\nthe very utmost degree of liberty, so we, deprived by inquisitions of\r\nall the intercourse of conversation, experienced the utmost of slavery.\r\nWith language we should have lost memory itself, had it been as much in\r\nour power to forget, as to be silent.\r\n\r\n3. Now our spirits begin to revive. But although at the first dawning\r\nof this happy period, [5] the emperor Nerva united two things before\r\nincompatible, monarchy and liberty; and Trajan is now daily augmenting\r\nthe felicity of the empire; and the public security [6] has not only\r\nassumed hopes and wishes, but has seen those wishes arise to confidence\r\nand stability; yet, from the nature of human infirmity, remedies are\r\nmore tardy in their operation than diseases; and, as bodies slowly\r\nincrease, but quickly perish, so it is more easy to suppress industry\r\nand genius, than to recall them. For indolence itself acquires a charm;\r\nand sloth, however odious at first, becomes at length engaging. During\r\nthe space of fifteen years, [7] a large portion of human life, how great\r\na number have fallen by casual events, and, as was the fate of all the\r\nmost distinguished, by the cruelty of the prince; whilst we, the few\r\nsurvivors, not of others alone, but, if I may be allowed the expression,\r\nof ourselves, find a void of so many years in our lives, which has\r\nsilently brought us from youth to maturity, from mature age to the\r\nvery verge of life! Still, however, I shall not regret having composed,\r\nthough in rude and artless language, a memorial of past servitude, and a\r\ntestimony of present blessings. [8]\r\n\r\nThe present work, in the meantime, which is dedicated to the honor of my\r\nfather-in-law, may be thought to merit approbation, or at least excuse,\r\nfrom the piety of the intention.\r\n\r\n4. CNAEUS JULIUS AGRICOLA was born at the ancient and illustrious colony\r\nof Forumjulii. [9] Both his grandfathers were imperial procurators, [10]\r\nan office which confers the rank of equestrian nobility. His father,\r\nJulius Graecinus, [11] of the senatorian order, was famous for the study\r\nof eloquence and philosophy; and by these accomplishments he drew on\r\nhimself the displeasure of Caius Caesar; [12] for, being commanded to\r\nundertake the accusation of Marcus Silanus, [13]--on his refusal, he\r\nwas put to death. His mother was Julia Procilla, a lady of exemplary\r\nchastity. Educated with tenderness in her bosom, [14] he passed his\r\nchildhood and youth in the attainment of every liberal art. He was\r\npreserved from the allurements of vice, not only by a naturally good\r\ndisposition, but by being sent very early to pursue his studies at\r\nMassilia; [15] a place where Grecian politeness and provincial frugality\r\nare happily united. I remember he was used to relate, that in his\r\nearly youth he should have engaged with more ardor in philosophical\r\nspeculation than was suitable to a Roman and a senator, had not the\r\nprudence of his mother restrained the warmth and vehemence of his\r\ndisposition: for his lofty and upright spirit, inflamed by the charms of\r\nglory and exalted reputation, led him to the pursuit with more eagerness\r\nthan discretion. Reason and riper years tempered his warmth; and\r\nfrom the study of wisdom, he retained what is most difficult to\r\ncompass,--moderation.\r\n\r\n5. He learned the rudiments of war in Britain, under Suetonius\r\nPaullinus, an active and prudent commander, who chose him for his tent\r\ncompanion, in order to form an estimate of his merit. [16] Nor did\r\nAgricola, like many young men, who convert military service into wanton\r\npastime, avail himself licentiously or slothfully of his tribunitial\r\ntitle, or his inexperience, to spend his time in pleasures and absences\r\nfrom duty; but he employed himself in gaining a knowledge of\r\nthe country, making himself known to the army, learning from the\r\nexperienced, and imitating the best; neither pressing to be employed\r\nthrough vainglory, nor declining it through timidity; and performing\r\nhis duty with equal solicitude and spirit. At no other time in truth was\r\nBritain more agitated or in a state of greater uncertainty. Our veterans\r\nslaughtered, our colonies burnt, [17] our armies cut off, [18]--we were\r\nthen contending for safety, afterwards for victory. During this period,\r\nalthough all things were transacted under the conduct and direction of\r\nanother, and the stress of the whole, as well as the glory of recovering\r\nthe province, fell to the general's share, yet they imparted to the\r\nyoung Agricola skill, experience, and incentives; and the passion for\r\nmilitary glory entered his soul; a passion ungrateful to the times, [19]\r\nin which eminence was unfavorably construed, and a great reputation was\r\nno less dangerous than a bad one.\r\n\r\n6. Departing thence to undertake the offices of magistracy in Rome, he\r\nmarried Domitia Decidiana, a lady of illustrious descent, from which\r\nconnection he derived credit and support in his pursuit of greater\r\nthings. They lived together in admirable harmony and mutual affection;\r\neach giving the preference to the other; a conduct equally laudable in\r\nboth, except that a greater degree of praise is due to a good wife,\r\nin proportion as a bad one deserves the greater censure. The lot of\r\nquaestorship [20] gave him Asia for his province, and the proconsul\r\nSalvius Titianus [21] for his superior; by neither of which\r\ncircumstances was he corrupted, although the province was wealthy and\r\nopen to plunder, and the proconsul, from his rapacious disposition,\r\nwould readily have agreed to a mutual concealment of guilt. His family\r\nwas there increased by the birth of a daughter, who was both the support\r\nof his house, and his consolation; for he lost an elder-born son in\r\ninfancy. The interval between his serving the offices of quaestor and\r\ntribune of the people, and even the year of the latter magistracy, he\r\npassed in repose and inactivity; well knowing the temper of the times\r\nunder Nero, in which indolence was wisdom. He maintained the same tenor\r\nof conduct when praetor; for the judiciary part of the office did not\r\nfall to his share. [22] In the exhibition of public games, and the idle\r\ntrappings of dignity, he consulted propriety and the measure of his\r\nfortune; by no means approaching to extravagance, yet inclining rather\r\nto a popular course. When he was afterwards appointed by Galba to manage\r\nan inquest concerning the offerings which had been presented to the\r\ntemples, by his strict attention and diligence he preserved the state\r\nfrom any further sacrilege than what it had suffered from Nero. [23]\r\n\r\n7. The following year [24] inflicted a severe wound on his peace\r\nof mind, and his domestic concerns. The fleet of Otho, roving in\r\na disorderly manner on the coast, [25] made a hostile descent on\r\nIntemelii, [26] a part of Liguria, in which the mother of Agricola was\r\nmurdered at her own estate, her lands were ravaged, and a great part\r\nof her effects, which had invited the assassins, was carried off. As\r\nAgricola upon this event was hastening to perform the duties of filial\r\npiety, he was overtaken by the news of Vespasian's aspiring to the\r\nempire, [27] and immediately went over to his party. The first acts\r\nof power, and the government of the city, were entrusted to Mucianus;\r\nDomitian being at that time very young, and taking no other privilege\r\nfrom his father's elevation than that of indulging his licentious\r\ntastes. Mucianus, having approved the vigor and fidelity of Agricola\r\nin the service of raising levies, gave him the command of the twentieth\r\nlegion, [28] which had appeared backward in taking the oaths, as soon as\r\nhe had heard the seditious practices of his commander. [29] This legion\r\nhad been unmanageable and formidable even to the consular lieutenants;\r\n[30] and its late commander, of praetorian rank, had not sufficient\r\nauthority to keep it in obedience; though it was uncertain whether from\r\nhis own disposition, or that of his soldiers. Agricola was therefore\r\nappointed as his successor and avenger; but, with an uncommon degree\r\nof moderation, he chose rather to have it appear that he had found the\r\nlegion obedient, than that he had made it so.\r\n\r\n8. Vettius Bolanus was at that time governor of Britain, and ruled with\r\na milder sway than was suitable to so turbulent a province. Under his\r\nadministration, Agricola, accustomed to obey, and taught to consult\r\nutility as well as glory, tempered his ardor, and restrained his\r\nenterprising spirit. His virtues had soon a larger field for their\r\ndisplay, from the appointment of Petilius Cerealis, [31] a man of\r\nconsular dignity, to the government. At first he only shared the\r\nfatigues and dangers of his general; but was presently allowed to\r\npartake of his glory. Cerealis frequently entrusted him with part of his\r\narmy as a trial of his abilities; and from the event sometimes enlarged\r\nhis command. On these occasions, Agricola was never ostentatious\r\nin assuming to himself the merit of his exploits; but always, as a\r\nsubordinate officer, gave the honor of his good fortune to his superior.\r\nThus, by his spirit in executing orders, and his modesty in reporting\r\nhis success, he avoided envy, yet did not fail of acquiring reputation.\r\n\r\n9. On his return from commanding the legion he was raised by Vespasian\r\nto the patrician order, and then invested with the government of\r\nAquitania, [32] a distinguished promotion, both in respect to the office\r\nitself, and the hopes of the consulate to which it destined him. It is a\r\ncommon supposition that military men, habituated to the unscrupulous and\r\nsummary processes of camps, where things are carried with a strong hand,\r\nare deficient in the address and subtlety of genius requisite in civil\r\njurisdiction. Agricola, however, by his natural prudence, was enabled to\r\nact with facility and precision even among civilians. He distinguished\r\nthe hours of business from those of relaxation. When the court or\r\ntribunal demanded his presence, he was grave, intent, awful, yet\r\ngenerally inclined to lenity. When the duties of his office were\r\nover, the man of power was instantly laid aside. Nothing of sternness,\r\narrogance, or rapaciousness appeared; and, what was a singular felicity,\r\nhis affability did not impair his authority, nor his severity render him\r\nless beloved. To mention integrity and freedom from corruption in such\r\na man, would be an affront to his virtues. He did not even court\r\nreputation, an object to which men of worth frequently sacrifice,\r\nby ostentation or artifice: equally avoiding competition with, his\r\ncolleagues, [33] and contention with the procurators. To overcome in\r\nsuch a contest he thought inglorious; and to be put down, a disgrace.\r\nSomewhat less than three years were spent in this office, when he was\r\nrecalled to the immediate prospect of the consulate; while at the same\r\ntime a popular opinion prevailed that the government of Britain would be\r\nconferred upon him; an opinion not founded upon any suggestions of his\r\nown, but upon his being thought equal to the station. Common fame does\r\nnot always err, sometimes it even directs a choice. When consul, [34]\r\nhe contracted his daughter, a lady already of the happiest promise,\r\nto myself, then a very young man; and after his office was expired\r\nI received her in marriage. He was immediately appointed governor of\r\nBritain, and the pontificate [35] was added to his other dignities.\r\n\r\n10. The situation and inhabitants of Britain have been described by many\r\nwriters; [36] and I shall not add to the number with the view of vying\r\nwith them in accuracy and ingenuity, but because it was first thoroughly\r\nsubdued in the period of the present history. Those things which, while\r\nyet unascertained, they embellished with their eloquence, shall here be\r\nrelated with a faithful adherence to known facts. Britain, the largest\r\nof all the islands which have come within the knowledge of the Romans,\r\nstretches on the east towards Germany, on the west towards Spain, [37]\r\nand on the south it is even within sight of Gaul. Its northern extremity\r\nhas no opposite land, but is washed by a wide and open sea. Livy, the\r\nmost eloquent of ancient, and Fabius Rusticus, of modern writers, have\r\nlikened the figure of Britain to an oblong target, or a two-edged axe.\r\n[38] And this is in reality its appearance, exclusive of Caledonia;\r\nwhence it has been popularly attributed to the whole island. But that\r\ntract of country, irregularly stretching out to an immense length\r\ntowards the furthest shore, is gradually contracted in form of a wedge.\r\n[39] The Roman fleet, at this period first sailing round this remotest\r\ncoast, gave certain proof that Britain was an island; and at the same\r\ntime discovered and subdued the Orcades, [40] islands till then unknown.\r\nThule [41] was also distinctly seen, which winter and eternal snow had\r\nhitherto concealed. The sea is reported to be sluggish and laborious to\r\nthe rower; and even to be scarcely agitated by winds. The cause of this\r\nstagnation I imagine to be the deficiency of land and mountains where\r\ntempests are generated; and the difficulty with which such a mighty mass\r\nof waters, in an uninterrupted main, is put in motion. [42] It is not\r\nthe business of this work to investigate the nature of the ocean and\r\nthe tides; a subject which many writers have already undertaken. I shall\r\nonly add one circumstance: that the dominion of the sea is nowhere more\r\nextensive; that it carries many currents in this direction and in that;\r\nand its ebbings and flowings are not confined to the shore, but it\r\npenetrates into the heart of the country, and works its way among hills\r\nand mountains, as though it were in its own domain. [43]\r\n\r\n11. Who were the first inhabitants of Britain, whether indigenous [44]\r\nor immigrants, is a question involved in the obscurity usual among\r\nbarbarians. Their temperament of body is various, whence deductions are\r\nformed of their different origin. Thus, the ruddy hair and large limbs\r\nof the Caledonians [45] point out a German derivation. The swarthy\r\ncomplexion and curled hair of the Silures, [46] together with their\r\nsituation opposite to Spain, render it probable that a colony of the\r\nancient Iberi [47] possessed themselves of that territory. They who are\r\nnearest Gaul [48] resemble the inhabitants of that country; whether from\r\nthe duration of hereditary influence, or whether it be that when\r\nlands jut forward in opposite directions, [49] climate gives the same\r\ncondition of body to the inhabitants of both. On a general survey,\r\nhowever, it appears probable that the Gauls originally took possession\r\nof the neighboring coast. The sacred rites and superstitions [50] of\r\nthese people are discernible among the Britons. The languages of the two\r\nnations do not greatly differ. The same audacity in provoking danger,\r\nand irresolution in facing it when present, is observable in both. The\r\nBritons, however, display more ferocity, [51] not being yet softened\r\nby a long peace: for it appears from history that the Gauls were once\r\nrenowned in war, till, losing their valor with their liberty, languor\r\nand indolence entered amongst them. The same change has also taken place\r\namong those of the Britons who have been long subdued; [52] but the rest\r\ncontinue such as the Gauls formerly were.\r\n\r\n12. Their military strength consists in infantry; some nations also make\r\nuse of chariots in war; in the management of which, the most honorable\r\nperson guides the reins, while his dependents fight from the chariot.\r\n[53] The Britons were formerly governed by kings, [54] but at present\r\nthey are divided in factions and parties among their chiefs; and this\r\nwant of union for concerting some general plan is the most favorable\r\ncircumstance to us, in our designs against so powerful a people. It\r\nis seldom that two or three communities concur in repelling the common\r\ndanger; and thus, while they engage singly, they are all subdued. The\r\nsky in this country is deformed by clouds and frequent rains; but the\r\ncold is never extremely rigorous. [55] The length of the days greatly\r\nexceeds that in our part of the world. [56] The nights are bright, and,\r\nat the extremity of the island, so short, that the close and return\r\nof day is scarcely distinguished by a perceptible interval. It is even\r\nasserted that, when clouds do not intervene, the splendor of the sun is\r\nvisible during the whole night, and that it does not appear to rise and\r\nset, but to move across. [57] The cause of this is, that the extreme\r\nand flat parts of the earth, casting a low shadow, do not throw up the\r\ndarkness, and so night falls beneath the sky and the stars. [58] The\r\nsoil, though improper for the olive, the vine, and other productions of\r\nwarmer climates, is fertile, and suitable for corn. Growth is quick,\r\nbut maturation slow; both from the same cause, the great humidity of the\r\nground and the atmosphere. [59] The earth yields gold and silver [60]\r\nand other metals, the rewards of victory. The ocean produces pearls,\r\n[61] but of a cloudy and livid hue; which some impute to unskilfulness\r\nin the gatherers; for in the Red Sea the fish are plucked from the rocks\r\nalive and vigorous, but in Britain they are collected as the sea throws\r\nthem up. For my own part, I can more readily conceive that the defect is\r\nin the nature of the pearls, than in our avarice.\r\n\r\n13. The Britons cheerfully submit to levies, tributes, and the other\r\nservices of government, if they are not treated injuriously; but such\r\ntreatment they bear with impatience, their subjection only extending to\r\nobedience, not to servitude. Accordingly Julius Caesar, [62] the first\r\nRoman who entered Britain with an army, although he terrified the\r\ninhabitants by a successful engagement, and became master of the shore,\r\nmay be considered rather to have transmitted the discovery than the\r\npossession of the country to posterity. The civil wars soon succeeded;\r\nthe arms of the leaders were turned against their country; and a long\r\nneglect of Britain ensued, which continued even after the establishment\r\nof peace. This Augustus attributed to policy; and Tiberius to the\r\ninjunctions of his predecessor. [63] It is certain that Caius Caesar\r\n[64] meditated an expedition into Britain; but his temper, precipitate\r\nin forming schemes, and unsteady in pursuing them, together with the\r\nill success of his mighty attempts against Germany, rendered the design\r\nabortive. Claudius [65] accomplished the undertaking, transporting his\r\nlegions and auxiliaries, and associating Vespasian in the direction\r\nof affairs, which laid the foundation of his future fortune. In this\r\nexpedition, nations were subdued, kings made captive, and Vespasian was\r\nheld forth to the fates.\r\n\r\n14. Aulus Plautius, the first consular governor, and his successor,\r\nOstorius Scapula, [66] were both eminent for military abilities. Under\r\nthem, the nearest part of Britain was gradually reduced into the form of\r\na province, and a colony of veterans [67] was settled. Certain districts\r\nwere bestowed upon king Cogidunus, a prince who continued in perfect\r\nfidelity within our own memory. This was done agreeably to the ancient\r\nand long established practice of the Romans, to make even kings the\r\ninstruments of servitude. Didius Gallus, the next governor, preserved\r\nthe acquisitions of his predecessors, and added a very few fortified\r\nposts in the remoter parts, for the reputation of enlarging his\r\nprovince. Veranius succeeded, but died within the year. Suetonius\r\nPaullinus then commanded with success for two years, subduing various\r\nnations, and establishing garrisons. In the confidence with which this\r\ninspired him, he undertook an expedition against the island Mona, [68]\r\nwhich had furnished the revolters with supplies; and thereby exposed the\r\nsettlements behind him to a surprise.\r\n\r\n15. For the Britons, relieved from present dread by the absence of the\r\ngovernor, began to hold conferences, in which they painted the miseries\r\nof servitude, compared their several injuries, and inflamed each other\r\nwith such representations as these: \"That the only effects of their\r\npatience were more grievous impositions upon a people who submitted with\r\nsuch facility. Formerly they had one king respectively; now two were set\r\nover them, the lieutenant and the procurator, the former of whom vented\r\nhis rage upon their life's blood, the latter upon their properties; [69]\r\nthe union or discord [70] of these governors was equally fatal to those\r\nwhom they ruled, while the officers of the one, and the centurions\r\nof the other, joined in oppressing them by all kinds of violence and\r\ncontumely; so that nothing was exempted from their avarice, nothing from\r\ntheir lust. In battle it was the bravest who took spoils; but those whom\r\n_they_ suffered to seize their houses, force away their children, and\r\nexact levies, were, for the most part, the cowardly and effeminate; as\r\nif the only lesson of suffering of which they were ignorant was how\r\nto die for their country. Yet how inconsiderable would the number of\r\ninvaders appear did the Britons but compute their own forces! From\r\nconsiderations like these, Germany had thrown off the yoke, [71] though\r\na river [72] and not the ocean was its barrier. The welfare of their\r\ncountry, their wives, and their parents called them to arms, while\r\navarice and luxury alone incited their enemies; who would withdraw as\r\neven the deified Julius had done, if the present race of Britons would\r\nemulate the valor of their ancestors, and not be dismayed at the event\r\nof the first or second engagement. Superior spirit and perseverence were\r\nalways the share of the wretched; and the gods themselves now seemed to\r\ncompassionate the Britons, by ordaining the absence of the general, and\r\nthe detention of his army in another island. The most difficult point,\r\nassembling for the purpose of deliberation, was already accomplished;\r\nand there was always more danger from the discovery of designs like\r\nthese, than from their execution.\"\r\n\r\n16. Instigated by such suggestions, they unanimously rose in arms, led\r\nby Boadicea, [73] a woman of royal descent (for they make no distinction\r\nbetween the sexes in succession to the throne), and attacking the\r\nsoldiers dispersed through the garrisons, stormed the fortified posts,\r\nand invaded the colony [74] itself, as the seat of slavery. They\r\nomitted no species of cruelty with which rage and victory could\r\ninspire barbarians; and had not Paullinus, on being acquainted with the\r\ncommotion of the province, marched speedily to its relief, Britain would\r\nhave been lost. The fortune of a single battle, however, reduced it\r\nto its former subjection; though many still remained in arms, whom\r\nthe consciousness of revolt, and particular dread of the governor,\r\nhad driven to despair. Paullinus, although otherwise exemplary in his\r\nadministration, having treated those who surrendered with severity, and\r\nhaving pursued too rigorous measures, as one who was revenging his own\r\npersonal injury also, Petronius Turpilianus [75] was sent in his stead,\r\nas a person more inclined to lenity, and one who, being unacquainted\r\nwith the enemy's delinquency, could more easily accept their penitence.\r\nAfter having restored things to their former quiet state, he delivered\r\nthe command to Trebellius Maximus. [76] Trebellius, indolent, and\r\ninexperienced in military affairs, maintained the tranquillity of the\r\nprovince by popular manners; for even the barbarians had now learned to\r\npardon under the seductive influence of vices; and the intervention of\r\nthe civil wars afforded a legitimate excuse for his inactivity. Sedition\r\nhowever infected the soldiers, who, instead of their usual military\r\nservices, were rioting in idleness. Trebellius, after escaping the fury\r\nof his army by flight and concealment, dishonored and abased, regained a\r\nprecarious authority; and a kind of tacit compact took place, of safety\r\nto the general, and licentiousness to the army. This mutiny was not\r\nattended with bloodshed. Vettius Bolanus, [77] succeeding during the\r\ncontinuance of the civil wars, was unable to introduce discipline into\r\nBritain. The same inaction towards the enemy, and the same insolence in\r\nthe camp, continued; except that Bolanus, unblemished in his character,\r\nand not obnoxious by any crime, in some measure substituted affection in\r\nthe place of authority.\r\n\r\n17. At length, when Vespasian received the possession of Britain\r\ntogether with the rest of the world, the great commanders and\r\nwell-appointed armies which were sent over abated the confidence of\r\nthe enemy; and Petilius Cerealis struck terror by an attack upon the\r\nBrigantes, [78] who are reputed to compose the most populous state in\r\nthe whole province. Many battles were fought, some of them attended\r\nwith much bloodshed; and the greater part of the Brigantes were either\r\nbrought into subjection, or involved in the ravages of war. The conduct\r\nand reputation of Cerealis were so brilliant that they might have\r\neclipsed the splendor of a successor; yet Julius Frontinus, [79] a truly\r\ngreat man, supported the arduous competition, as far as circumstances\r\nwould permit. [80] He subdued the strong and warlike nation of the\r\nSilures, [81] in which expedition, besides the valor of the enemy, he\r\nhad the difficulties of the country to struggle with.\r\n\r\n18. Such was the state of Britain, and such had been the vicissitudes of\r\nwarfare, when Agricola arrived in the middle of summer; [82] at a time\r\nwhen the Roman soldiers, supposing the expeditions of the year were\r\nconcluded, were thinking of enjoying themselves without care, and the\r\nnatives, of seizing the opportunity thus afforded them. Not long before\r\nhis arrival, the Ordovices [83] had cut off almost an entire corps\r\nof cavalry stationed on their frontiers; and the inhabitants of\r\nthe province being thrown into a state of anxious suspense by this\r\nbeginning, inasmuch as war was what they wished for, either approved of\r\nthe example, or waited to discover the disposition of the new governor.\r\n[84] The season was now far advanced, the troops dispersed through\r\nthe country, and possessed with the idea of being suffered to remain\r\ninactive during the rest of the year; circumstances which tended to\r\nretard and discourage any military enterprise; so that it was generally\r\nthought most advisable to be contented with defending the suspected\r\nposts: yet Agricola determined to march out and meet the approaching\r\ndanger. For this purpose, he drew together the detachments from the\r\nlegions, [85] and a small body of auxiliaries; and when he perceived\r\nthat the Ordovices would not venture to descend into the plain, he led\r\nan advanced party in person to the attack, in order to inspire the rest\r\nof his troops with equal ardor. The result of the action was almost the\r\ntotal extirpation of the Ordovices; when Agricola, sensible that renown\r\nmust be followed up, and that the future events of the war would be\r\ndetermined by the first success, resolved to make an attempt upon the\r\nisland Mona, from the occupation of which Paullinus had been summoned\r\nby the general rebellion of Britain, as before related. [86] The\r\nusual deficiency of an unforeseen expedition appearing in the want\r\nof transport vessels, the ability and resolution of the general\r\nwere exerted to supply this defect. A select body of auxiliaries,\r\ndisencumbered of their baggage, who were well acquainted with the fords,\r\nand accustomed, after the manner of their country, to direct their\r\nhorses and manage their arms while swimming, [87] were ordered suddenly\r\nto plunge into the channel; by which movement, the enemy, who expected\r\nthe arrival of a fleet, and a formal invasion by sea, were struck with\r\nterror and astonishment, conceiving nothing arduous or insuperable to\r\ntroops who thus advanced to the attack. They were therefore induced to\r\nsue for peace, and make a surrender of the island; an event which threw\r\nlustre on the name of Agricola, who, on the very entrance upon his\r\nprovince, had employed in toils and dangers that time which is usually\r\ndevoted to ostentatious parade, and the compliments of office. Nor was\r\nhe tempted, in the pride of success, to term that an expedition or a\r\nvictory; which was only bridling the vanquished; nor even to announce\r\nhis success in laureate despatches. [88] But this concealment of his\r\nglory served to augment it; since men were led to entertain a high idea\r\nof the grandeur of his future views, when such important services were\r\npassed over in silence.\r\n\r\n19. Well acquainted with the temper of the province, and taught by the\r\nexperience of former governors how little proficiency had been made\r\nby arms, when success was followed by injuries, he next undertook to\r\neradicate the causes of war. And beginning with himself, and those next\r\nto him, he first laid restrictions upon his own household, a task no\r\nless arduous to most governors than the administration of the province.\r\nHe suffered no public business to pass through the hands of his slaves\r\nor freedmen. In admitting soldiers into regular service, [89] to\r\nattendance about his person, he was not influenced by private favor, or\r\nthe recommendation or solicitation of the centurions, but considered the\r\nbest men as likely to prove the most faithful. He would know everything;\r\nbut was content to let some things pass unnoticed. [90] He could pardon\r\nsmall faults, and use severity to great ones; yet did not always punish,\r\nbut was frequently satisfied with penitence. He chose rather to confer\r\noffices and employments upon such as would not offend, than to\r\ncondemn those who had offended. The augmentation [91] of tributes and\r\ncontributions he mitigated by a just and equal assessment, abolishing\r\nthose private exactions which were more grievous to be borne than the\r\ntaxes themselves. For the inhabitants had been compelled in mockery to\r\nsit by their own locked-up granaries, to buy corn needlessly, and to\r\nsell it again at a stated price. Long and difficult journeys had also\r\nbeen imposed upon them; for the several districts, instead of being\r\nallowed to supply the nearest winter quarters, were forced to carry\r\ntheir corn to remote and devious places; by which means, what was easy\r\nto be procured by all, was converted into an article of gain to a few.\r\n\r\n20. By suppressing these abuses in the first year of his administration,\r\nhe established a favorable idea of peace, which, through the negligence\r\nor oppression of his predecessors, had been no less dreaded than war.\r\nAt the return of summer [92] he assembled his army. On their march, he\r\ncommended the regular and orderly, and restrained the stragglers; he\r\nmarked out the encampments, [93] and explored in person the estuaries\r\nand forests. At the same time he perpetually harassed the enemy by\r\nsudden incursions; and, after sufficiently alarming them, by an interval\r\nof forbearance, he held to their view the allurements of peace. By\r\nthis management, many states, which till that time had asserted their\r\nindependence, were now induced to lay aside their animosity, and to\r\ndeliver hostages. These districts were surrounded with castles and\r\nforts, disposed with so much attention and judgment, that no part of\r\nBritain, hitherto new to the Roman arms, escaped unmolested.\r\n\r\n21. The succeeding winter was employed in the most salutary measures.\r\nIn order, by a taste of pleasures, to reclaim the natives from that rude\r\nand unsettled state which prompted them to war, and reconcile them to\r\nquiet and tranquillity, he incited them, by private instigations\r\nand public encouragements, to erect temples, courts of justice, and\r\ndwelling-houses. He bestowed commendations upon those who were prompt\r\nin complying with his intentions, and reprimanded such as were dilatory;\r\nthus promoting a spirit of emulation which had all the force of\r\nnecessity. He was also attentive to provide a liberal education for the\r\nsons of their chieftains, preferring the natural genius of the Britons\r\nto the attainments of the Gauls; and his attempts were attended with\r\nsuch success, that they who lately disdained to make use of the Roman\r\nlanguage, were now ambitious of becoming eloquent. Hence the Roman habit\r\nbegan to be held in honor, and the toga was frequently worn. At length\r\nthey gradually deviated into a taste for those luxuries which stimulate\r\nto vice; porticos, and baths, and the elegancies of the table; and this,\r\nfrom their inexperience, they termed politeness, whilst, in reality, it\r\nconstituted a part of their slavery.\r\n\r\n22. The military expeditions of the third year [94] discovered new\r\nnations to the Romans, and their ravages extended as far as the estuary\r\nof the Tay. [95] The enemies were thereby struck with such terror that\r\nthey did not venture to molest the army though harassed by violent\r\ntempests; so that they had sufficient opportunity for the erection of\r\nfortresses. [96] Persons of experience remarked, that no general had\r\never shown greater skill in the choice of advantageous situations than\r\nAgricola; for not one of his fortified posts was either taken by storm,\r\nor surrendered by capitulation. The garrisons made frequent sallies;\r\nfor they were secured against a blockade by a year's provision in their\r\nstores. Thus the winter passed without alarm, and each garrison proved\r\nsufficient for its own defence; while the enemy, who were generally\r\naccustomed to repair the losses of the summer by the successes of the\r\nwinter, now equally unfortunate in both seasons, were baffled and driven\r\nto despair. In these transactions, Agricola never attempted to arrogate\r\nto himself the glory of others; but always bore an impartial testimony\r\nto the meritorious actions of his officers, from the centurion to the\r\ncommander of a legion. He was represented by some as rather harsh\r\nin reproof; as if the same disposition which made him affable to the\r\ndeserving, had inclined him to austerity towards the worthless. But\r\nhis anger left no relics behind; his silence and reserve were not to\r\nbe dreaded; and he esteemed it more honorable to show marks of open\r\ndispleasure, than to entertain secret hatred.\r\n\r\n23. The fourth summer [97] was spent in securing the country which had\r\nbeen overrun; and if the valor of the army and the glory of the Roman\r\nname had permitted it, our conquests would have found a limit within\r\nBritain itself. For the tides of the opposite seas, flowing very far up\r\nthe estuaries of Clota and Bodotria, [98] almost intersect the country;\r\nleaving only a narrow neck of land, which was then defended by a\r\nchain of forts. [99] Thus all the territory on this side was held in\r\nsubjection, and the remaining enemies were removed, as it were, into\r\nanother island.\r\n\r\n24. In the fifth campaign, [100] Agricola, crossing over in the first\r\nship, [101] subdued, by frequent and successful engagements, several\r\nnations till then unknown; and stationed troops in that part of Britain\r\nwhich is opposite to Ireland, rather with a view to future advantage,\r\nthan from any apprehension of danger from that quarter. For the\r\npossession of Ireland, situated between Britain and Spain, and\r\nlying commodiously to the Gallic sea, [102] would have formed a very\r\nbeneficial connection between the most powerful parts of the empire.\r\nThis island is less than Britain, but larger than those of our sea.\r\n[103] Its soil, climate, and the manners and dispositions of its\r\ninhabitants, are little different from those of Britain. Its ports\r\nand harbors are better known, from the concourse of merchants for the\r\npurposes of commerce. Agricola had received into his protection one\r\nof its petty kings, who had been expelled by a domestic sedition; and\r\ndetained him, under the semblance of friendship, till an occasion should\r\noffer of making use of him. I have frequently heard him assert, that\r\na single legion and a few auxiliaries would be sufficient entirely to\r\nconquer Ireland and keep it in subjection; and that such an event would\r\nalso have contributed to restrain the Britons, by awing them with the\r\nprospect of the Roman arms all around them, and, as it were, banishing\r\nliberty from their sight.\r\n\r\n25. In the summer which began the sixth year [104] of Agricola's\r\nadministration, extending his views to the countries situated beyond\r\nBodotria, [105] as a general insurrection of the remoter nations was\r\napprehended, and the enemy's army rendered marching unsafe, he caused\r\nthe harbors to be explored by his fleet, which, now first acting in aid\r\nof the land-forces gave the formidable spectacle of war at once pushed\r\non by sea and land. The cavalry, infantry, and marines were frequently\r\nmingled in the same camp, and recounted with mutual pleasure their\r\nseveral exploits and adventures; comparing, in the boastful language of\r\nmilitary men, the dark recesses of woods and mountains, with the\r\nhorrors of waves and tempests; and the land and enemy subdued, with\r\nthe conquered ocean. It was also discovered from the captives, that the\r\nBritons had been struck with consternation at the view of the fleet,\r\nconceiving the last refuge of the vanquished to be cut off, now the\r\nsecret retreats of their seas were disclosed. The various inhabitants of\r\nCaledonia immediately took up arms, with great preparations, magnified,\r\nhowever, by report, as usual where the truth is unknown; and by\r\nbeginning hostilities, and attacking our fortresses, they inspired\r\nterror as daring to act offensively; insomuch that some persons,\r\ndisguising their timidity under the mask of prudence, were for instantly\r\nretreating on this side the firth, and relinquishing the country rather\r\nthan waiting to be driven out. Agricola, in the meantime, being informed\r\nthat the enemy intended to bear down in several bodies, distributed\r\nhis army into three divisions, that his inferiority of numbers,\r\nand ignorance of the country, might not give them an opportunity of\r\nsurrounding him.\r\n\r\n26. When this was known to the enemy, they suddenly changed their\r\ndesign; and making a general attack in the night upon the ninth legion,\r\nwhich was the weakest, [106] in the confusion of sleep and consternation\r\nthey slaughtered the sentinels, and burst through the intrenchments.\r\nThey were now fighting within the camp, when Agricola, who had received\r\ninformation of their march from his scouts, and followed close upon\r\ntheir track, gave orders for the swiftest of his horse and foot to\r\ncharge the enemy's rear. Presently the whole army raised a general\r\nshout; and the standards now glittered at the approach of day. The\r\nBritons were distracted by opposite dangers; whilst the Romans in the\r\ncamp resumed their courage, and secure of safety, began to contend for\r\nglory. They now in their turns rushed forwards to the attack, and a\r\nfurious engagement ensued in the gates of the camp; till by the emulous\r\nefforts of both Roman armies, one to give assistance, the other to\r\nappear not to need it, the enemy was routed: and had not the woods and\r\nmarshes sheltered the fugitives, that day would have terminated the war.\r\n\r\n27. The soldiers, inspirited by the steadfastness which characterized\r\nand the fame which attended this victory, cried out that \"nothing could\r\nresist their valor; now was the time to penetrate into the heart\r\nof Caledonia, and in a continued series of engagements at length to\r\ndiscover the utmost limits of Britain.\" Those even who had before\r\nrecommended caution and prudence, were now rendered rash and boastful by\r\nsuccess. It is the hard condition of military command, that a share in\r\nprosperous events is claimed by all, but misfortunes are imputed to\r\none alone. The Britons meantime, attributing their defeat not to the\r\nsuperior bravery of their adversaries, but to chance, and the skill of\r\nthe general, remitted nothing of their confidence; but proceeded to arm\r\ntheir youth, to send their wives and children to places of safety, and\r\nto ratify the confederacy of their several states by solemn assemblies\r\nand sacrifices. Thus the parties separated with minds mutually\r\nirritated.\r\n\r\n28. During the same summer, a cohort of Usipii, [107] which had been\r\nlevied in Germany, and sent over into Britain, performed an extremely\r\ndaring and memorable action. After murdering a centurion and some\r\nsoldiers who had been incorporated with them for the purpose of\r\ninstructing them in military discipline, they seized upon three light\r\nvessels, and compelled the masters to go on board with them. One of\r\nthese, however, escaping to shore, they killed the other two upon\r\nsuspicion; and before the affair was publicly known, they sailed away,\r\nas it were by miracle. They were presently driven at the mercy of\r\nthe waves; and had frequent conflicts, with various success, with the\r\nBritons, defending their property from plunder. [108] At length they\r\nwere reduced to such extremity of distress as to be obliged to feed upon\r\neach other; the weakest being first sacrificed, and then such as were\r\ntaken by lot. In this manner having sailed round the island, they lost\r\ntheir ships through want of skill; and, being regarded as pirates, were\r\nintercepted, first by the Suevi, then by the Frisii. Some of them, after\r\nbeing sold for slaves, by the change of masters were brought to the\r\nRoman side of the river, [109] and became notorious from the relation of\r\ntheir extraordinary adventures. [110]\r\n\r\n29. In the beginning of the next summer, [111] Agricola received a\r\nsevere domestic wound in the loss of a son, about a year old. He bore\r\nthis calamity, not with the ostentatious firmness which many have\r\naffected, nor yet with the tears and lamentations of feminine sorrow;\r\nand war was one of the remedies of his grief. Having sent forwards his\r\nfleet to spread its ravages through various parts of the coast, in\r\norder to excite an extensive and dubious alarm, he marched with an\r\narmy equipped for expedition, to which he had joined the bravest of\r\nthe Britons whose fidelity had been approved by a long allegiance, and\r\narrived at the Grampian hills, where the enemy was already encamped.\r\n[112] For the Britons, undismayed by the event of the former action,\r\nexpecting revenge or slavery, and at length taught that the common\r\ndanger was to be repelled by union alone, had assembled the strength\r\nof all their tribes by embassies and confederacies. Upwards of thirty\r\nthousand men in arms were now descried; and the youth, together with\r\nthose of a hale and vigorous age, renowned in war, and bearing their\r\nseveral honorary decorations, were still flocking in; when Calgacus,\r\n[113] the most distinguished for birth and valor among the chieftans,\r\nis said to have harangued the multitude, gathering round, and eager for\r\nbattle, after the following manner:--\r\n\r\n30. \"When I reflect on the causes of the war, and the circumstances of\r\nour situation, I feel a strong persuasion that our united efforts on the\r\npresent day will prove the beginning of universal liberty to Britain.\r\nFor we are all undebased by slavery; and there is no land behind us, nor\r\ndoes even the sea afford a refuge, whilst the Roman fleet hovers around.\r\nThus the use of arms, which is at all times honorable to the brave, now\r\noffers the only safety even to cowards. In all the battles which\r\nhave yet been fought, with various success, against the Romans, our\r\ncountrymen may be deemed to have reposed their final hopes and resources\r\nin us: for we, the noblest sons of Britain, and therefore stationed in\r\nits last recesses, far from the view of servile shores, have preserved\r\neven our eyes unpolluted by the contact of subjection. We, at the\r\nfurthest limits both of land and liberty, have been defended to this\r\nday by the remoteness of our situation and of our fame. The extremity of\r\nBritain is now disclosed; and whatever is unknown becomes an object\r\nof magnitude. But there is no nation beyond us; nothing but waves and\r\nrocks, and the still more hostile Romans, whose arrogance we cannot\r\nescape by obsequiousness and submission. These plunderers of the world,\r\nafter exhausting the land by their devastations, are rifling the ocean:\r\nstimulated by avarice, if their enemy be rich; by ambition, if poor;\r\nunsatiated by the East and by the West: the only people who behold\r\nwealth and indigence with equal avidity. To ravage, to slaughter,\r\nto usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a\r\ndesert, they call it peace. [114]\r\n\r\n31. \"Our children and relations are by the appointment of nature the\r\ndearest of all things to us. These are torn away by levies to serve in\r\nforeign lands. [115] Our wives and sisters, though they should escape\r\nthe violation of hostile force, are polluted under names of friendship\r\nand hospitality. Our estates and possessions are consumed in tributes;\r\nour grain in contributions. Even our bodies are worn down amidst stripes\r\nand insults in clearing woods and draining marshes. Wretches born to\r\nslavery are once bought, and afterwards maintained by their masters:\r\nBritain every day buys, every day feeds, her own servitude. [116] And as\r\namong domestic slaves every new comer serves for the scorn and derision\r\nof his fellows; so, in this ancient household of the world, we, as the\r\nnewest and vilest, are sought out to destruction. For we have neither\r\ncultivated lands, nor mines, nor harbors, which can induce them to\r\npreserve us for our labors. The valor too and unsubmitting spirit\r\nof subjects only render them more obnoxious to their masters; while\r\nremoteness and secrecy of situation itself, in proportion as it conduces\r\nto security, tends to inspire suspicion. Since then all Lopes of mercy\r\nare vain, at length assume courage, both you to whom safety and you to\r\nwhom glory is dear. The Trinobantes, even under a female leader, had\r\nforce enough to burn a colony, to storm camps, and, if success had not\r\ndamped their vigor, would have been able entirely to throw off the\r\nyoke; and shall not we, untouched, unsubdued, and struggling not for the\r\nacquisition but the security of liberty, show at the very first onset\r\nwhat men Caledonia has reserved for her defence?\r\n\r\n32. \"Can you imagine that the Romans are as brave in war as they are\r\nlicentious in peace? Acquiring renown from our discords and dissensions,\r\nthey convert the faults of their enemies to the glory of their own army;\r\nan army compounded of the most different nations, which success alone\r\nhas kept together, and which misfortune will as certainly dissipate.\r\nUnless, indeed, you can suppose that Gauls, and Germans, and (I blush to\r\nsay it) even Britons, who, though they expend their blood to establish\r\na foreign dominion, have been longer its foes than its subjects, will be\r\nretained by loyalty and affection! Terror and dread alone are the weak\r\nbonds of attachment; which once broken, they who cease to fear will\r\nbegin to hate. Every incitement to victory is on our side. The Romans\r\nhave no wives to animate them; no parents to upbraid their flight. Most\r\nof them have either no home, or a distant one. Few in number, ignorant\r\nof the country, looking around in silent horror at woods, seas, and a\r\nheaven itself unknown to them, they are delivered by the gods, as it\r\nwere imprisoned and bound, into our hands. Be not terrified with an idle\r\nshow, and the glitter of silver and gold, which can neither protect nor\r\nwound. In the very ranks of the enemy we shall find our own bands. The\r\nBritons will acknowledge their own cause. The Gauls will recollect their\r\nformer liberty. The rest of the Germans will desert them, as the\r\nUsipii have lately done. Nor is there anything formidable behind them:\r\nungarrisoned forts; colonies of old men; municipal towns distempered and\r\ndistracted between unjust masters and ill-obeying subjects. Here is\r\na general; here an army. There, tributes, mines, and all the train of\r\npunishments inflicted on slaves; which whether to bear eternally, or\r\ninstantly to revenge, this field must determine. March then to battle,\r\nand think of your ancestors and your posterity.\"\r\n\r\n33. They received this harangue with alacrity, and testified their\r\napplause after the barbarian manner, with songs, and yells, and\r\ndissonant shouts. And now the several divisions were in motion, the\r\nglittering of arms was beheld, while the most daring and impetuous\r\nwere hurrying to the front, and the line of battle was forming; when\r\nAgricola, although his soldiers were in high spirits, and scarcely to\r\nbe kept within their intrenchments, kindled additional ardor by these\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n\"It is now the eighth year, my fellow-soldiers, in which, under the high\r\nauspices of the Roman empire, by your valor and perseverance you have\r\nbeen conquering Britain. In so many expeditions, in so many battles,\r\nwhether you have been required to exert your courage against the enemy,\r\nor your patient labors against the very nature of the country, neither\r\nhave I ever been dissatisfied with my soldiers, nor you with your\r\ngeneral. In this mutual confidence, we have proceeded beyond the limits\r\nof former commanders and former armies; and are now become acquainted\r\nwith the extremity of the island, not by uncertain rumor, but by actual\r\npossession with our arms and encampments. Britain is discovered and\r\nsubdued. How often on a march, when embarrassed with mountains, bogs\r\nand rivers, have I heard the bravest among you exclaim, 'When shall\r\nwe descry the enemy? when shall we be led to the field of battle?' At\r\nlength they are unharbored from their retreats; your wishes and your\r\nvalor have now free scope; and every circumstance is equally propitious\r\nto the victor, and ruinous to the vanquished. For, the greater our glory\r\nin having marched over vast tracts of land, penetrated forests, and\r\ncrossed arms of the sea, while advancing towards the foe, the greater\r\nwill be our danger and difficulty if we should attempt a retreat. We are\r\ninferior to our enemies in knowledge of the country, and less able to\r\ncommand supplies of provision; but we have arms in our hands, and in\r\nthese we have everything. For myself, it has long been my principle,\r\nthat a retiring general or army is never safe. Hot only, then, are we to\r\nreflect that death with honor is preferable to life with ignominy, but\r\nto remember that security and glory are seated in the same place. Even\r\nto fall in this extremest verge of earth and of nature cannot be thought\r\nan inglorious fate.\r\n\r\n34. \"If unknown nations or untried troops were drawn up against you, I\r\nwould exhort you from the example of other armies. At present, recollect\r\nyour own honors, question your own eyes. These are they, who, the last\r\nyear, attacking by surprise a single legion in the obscurity of the\r\nnight, were put to flight by a shout: the greatest fugitives of all the\r\nBritons, and therefore the longest survivors. As in penetrating woods\r\nand thickets the fiercest animals boldly rush on the hunters, while the\r\nweak and timorous fly at their very noise; so the bravest of the Britons\r\nhave long since fallen: the remaining number consists solely of the\r\ncowardly and spiritless; whom you see at length within your reach, not\r\nbecause they have stood their ground, but because they are overtaken.\r\nTorpid with fear, their bodies are fixed and chained down in yonder\r\nfield, which to you will speedily be the scene of a glorious and\r\nmemorable victory. Here bring your toils and services to a conclusion;\r\nclose a struggle of fifty years [118] with one great day; and convince\r\nyour country-men, that to the army ought not to be imputed either the\r\nprotraction of war, or the causes of rebellion.\"\r\n\r\n35. Whilst Agricola was yet speaking, the ardor of the soldiers declared\r\nitself; and as soon as he had finished, they burst forth into cheerful\r\nacclamations, and instantly flew to arms. Thus eager and impetuous, he\r\nformed them so that the centre was occupied by the auxiliary infantry,\r\nin number eight thousand, and three thousand horse were spread in the\r\nwings. The legions were stationed in the rear, before the intrenchments;\r\na disposition which would render the victory signally glorious, if\r\nit were obtained without the expense of Roman blood; and would ensure\r\nsupport if the rest of the army were repulsed. The British troops, for\r\nthe greater display of their numbers, and more formidable appearance,\r\nwere ranged upon the rising grounds, so that the first line stood upon\r\nthe plain, the rest, as if linked together, rose above one another upon\r\nthe ascent. The charioteers [119] and horsemen filled the middle of the\r\nfield with their tumult and careering. Then Agricola, fearing from the\r\nsuperior number of the enemy lest he should be obliged to fight as\r\nwell on his flanks as in front, extended his ranks; and although this\r\nrendered his line of battle less firm, and several of his officers\r\nadvised him to bring up the legions, yet, filled with hope, and resolute\r\nin danger, he dismissed his horse and took his station on foot before\r\nthe colors.\r\n\r\n36. At first the action was carried on at a distance. The Britons, armed\r\nwith long swords and short targets, [120] with steadiness and dexterity\r\navoided or struck down our missile weapons, and at the same time poured\r\nin a torrent of their own. Agricola then encouraged three Batavian and\r\ntwo Tungrian [121] cohorts to fall in and come to close quarters; a\r\nmethod of fighting familiar to these veteran soldiers, but embarrassing\r\nto the enemy from the nature of their armor; for the enormous British\r\nswords, blunt at the point, are unfit for close grappling, and engaging\r\nin a confined space. When the Batavians; therefore, began to redouble\r\ntheir blows, to strike with the bosses of their shields, and mangle the\r\nfaces of the enemy; and, bearing down all those who resisted them on\r\nthe plain, were advancing their lines up the ascent; the other cohorts,\r\nfired with ardor and emulation, joined in the charge, and overthrew all\r\nwho came in their way: and so great was their impetuosity in the pursuit\r\nof victory, that they left many of their foes half dead or unhurt behind\r\nthem. In the meantime the troops of cavalry took to flight, and the\r\narmed chariots mingled in the engagement of the infantry; but although\r\ntheir first shock occasioned some consternation, they were soon\r\nentangled among the close ranks of the cohorts, and the inequalities\r\nof the ground. Not the least appearance was left of an engagement of\r\ncavalry; since the men, long keeping their ground with difficulty, were\r\nforced along with the bodies of the horses; and frequently, straggling\r\nchariots, and affrighted horses without their riders, flying variously\r\nas terror impelled them, rushed obliquely athwart or directly through\r\nthe lines. [122]\r\n\r\n37. Those of the Britons who, yet disengaged from the fight, sat on the\r\nsummits of the hills, and looked with careless contempt on the smallness\r\nof our numbers, now began gradually to descend; and would have fallen on\r\nthe rear of the conquering troops, had not Agricola, apprehending this\r\nvery event, opposed four reserved squadron of horse to their attack,\r\nwhich, the more furiously they had advanced, drove them back with the\r\ngreater celerity. Their project was thus turned against themselves; and\r\nthe squadrons were ordered to wheel from the front of the battle\r\nand fall upon the enemy's rear. A striking and hideous spectacle\r\nnow appeared on the plain: some pursuing; some striking: some making\r\nprisoners, whom they slaughtered as others came in their way. Now, as\r\ntheir several dispositions prompted, crowds of armed Britons fled before\r\ninferior numbers, or a few, even unarmed, rushed upon their foes,\r\nand offered themselves to a voluntary death. Arms, and carcasses, and\r\nmangled limbs, were promiscuously strewed, and the field was dyed in\r\nblood. Even among the vanquished were seen instances of rage and valor.\r\nWhen the fugitives approached the woods, they collected, and surrounded\r\nthe foremost of the pursuers, advancing incautiously, and unacquainted\r\nwith the country; and had not Agricola, who was everywhere present,\r\ncaused some strong and lightly-equipped cohorts to encompass the ground,\r\nwhile part of the cavalry dismounted made way through the thickets,\r\nand part on horseback scoured the open woods, some disaster would have\r\nproceeded from the excess of confidence. But when the enemy saw their\r\npursuers again formed in compact order, they renewed their flight, not\r\nin bodies as before, or waiting for their companions, but scattered\r\nand mutually avoiding each other; and thus took their way to the most\r\ndistant and devious retreats. Night and satiety of slaughter put an end\r\nto the pursuit. Of the enemy ten thousand were slain: on our part three\r\nhundred and sixty fell; among whom was Aulus Atticus, the praefect of a\r\ncohort, who, by his juvenile ardor, and the fire of his horse, was borne\r\ninto the midst of the enemy.\r\n\r\n38. Success and plunder contributed to render the night joyful to the\r\nvictors; whilst the Britons, wandering and forlorn, amid the promiscuous\r\nlamentations of men and women, were dragging along the wounded; calling\r\nout to the unhurt; abandoning their habitations, and in the rage of\r\ndespair setting them on fire; choosing places of concealment, and then\r\ndeserting them; consulting together, and then separating. Sometimes, on\r\nbeholding the dear pledges of kindred and affection, they were melted\r\ninto tenderness, or more frequently roused into fury; insomuch that\r\nseveral, according to authentic information, instigated by a savage\r\ncompassion, laid violent hands upon their own wives and children. On the\r\nsucceeding day, a vast silence all around, desolate hills, the distant\r\nsmoke of burning houses, and not a living soul descried by the scouts,\r\ndisplayed more amply the face of victory. After parties had been\r\ndetached to all quarters without discovering any certain tracks of the\r\nenemy's flight, or any bodies of them still in arms, as the lateness\r\nof the season rendered it impracticable to spread the war through the\r\ncountry, Agricola led his army to the confines of the Horesti. [123]\r\nHaving received hostages from this people, he ordered the commander\r\nof the fleet to sail round the island; for which expedition he was\r\nfurnished with sufficient force, and preceded by the terror of the\r\nRoman name. Pie himself then led back the cavalry and infantry, marching\r\nslowly, that he might impress a deeper awe on the newly conquered\r\nnations; and at length distributed his troops into their\r\nwinter-quarters. The fleet, about the same time, with prosperous gales\r\nand renown, entered the Trutulensian [124] harbor, whence, coasting all\r\nthe hither shore of Britain, it returned entire to its former station.\r\n[125]\r\n\r\n39. The account of these transactions, although unadorned with the pomp\r\nof words in the letters of Agricola, was received by Domitian, as was\r\ncustomary with that prince, with outward expressions of joy, but inward\r\nanxiety. He was conscious that his late mock-triumph over Germany, [126]\r\nin which he had exhibited purchased slaves, whose habits and hair [127]\r\nwere contrived to give them the resemblance of captives, was a subject\r\nof derision; whereas here, a real and important victory, in which so\r\nmany thousands of the enemy were slain, was celebrated with universal\r\napplause. His greatest dread was that the name of a private man should\r\nbe exalted above that of the prince. In vain had he silenced the\r\neloquence of the forum, and cast a shade upon all civil honors,\r\nif military glory were still in possession of another. Other\r\naccomplishments might more easily be connived at, but the talents of a\r\ngreat general were truly imperial. Tortured with such anxious thoughts,\r\nand brooding over them in secret, [128] a certain indication of some\r\nmalignant intention, he judged it most prudent for the present to\r\nsuspend his rancor, tilt the first burst of glory and the affections\r\nof the army should remit: for Agricola still possessed the command in\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n40. He therefore caused the senate to decree him triumphal ornaments,\r\n[129]--a statue crowned with laurel, and all the other honors which\r\nare substituted for a real triumph, together with a profusion of\r\ncomplimentary expressions; and also directed an expectation to be raised\r\nthat the province of Syria, vacant by the death of Atilius Rufus,\r\na consular man, and usually reserved for persons of the greatest\r\ndistinction, was designed for Agricola. It was commonly believed that\r\none of the freedmen, who were employed in confidential services, was\r\ndespatched with the instrument appointing Agricola to the government of\r\nSyria, with orders to deliver it if he should be still in Britain; but\r\nthat this messenger, meeting Agricola in the straits, [130] returned\r\ndirectly to Domitian without so much as accosting him. [131] Whether\r\nthis was really the fact, or only a fiction founded on the genius and\r\ncharacter of the prince, is uncertain. Agricola, in the meantime, had\r\ndelivered the province, in peace and security, to his successor; [132]\r\nand lest his entry into the city should be rendered too conspicuous by\r\nthe concourse and acclamations of the people, he declined the salutation\r\nof his friends by arriving in the night; and went by night, as he was\r\ncommanded, to the palace. There, after being received with a slight\r\nembrace, but not a word spoken, he was mingled with the servile throng.\r\nIn this situation, he endeavored to soften the glare of military\r\nreputation, which is offensive to those who themselves live in\r\nindolence, by the practice of virtues of a different cast. He resigned\r\nhimself to ease and tranquillity, was modest in his garb and equipage,\r\naffable in conversation, and in public was only accompanied by one or\r\ntwo of his friends; insomuch that the many, who are accustomed to form\r\ntheir ideas of great men from their retinue and figure, when they beheld\r\nAgricola, were apt to call in question his renown: few could interpret\r\nhis conduct.\r\n\r\n41. He was frequently, during that period, accused in his absence before\r\nDomitian, and in his absence also acquitted. The source of his danger\r\nwas not any criminal action, nor the complaint of any injured person;\r\nbut a prince hostile to virtue, and his own high reputation, and the\r\nworst kind of enemies, eulogists. [133] For the situation of public\r\naffairs which ensued was such as would not permit the name of Agricola\r\nto rest in silence: so many armies in Moesia, Dacia, Germany, and\r\nPannonia lost through the temerity or cowardice of their generals; [134]\r\nso many men of military character, with numerous cohorts, defeated and\r\ntaken prisoners; whilst a dubious contest was maintained, not for the\r\nboundaries, of the empire, and the banks of the bordering rivers, [135]\r\nbut for the winter-quarters of the legions, and the possession of our\r\nterritories. In this state of things, when loss succeeded loss, and\r\nevery year was signalized by disasters and slaughters, the public voice\r\nloudly demanded Agricola for general: every one comparing his vigor,\r\nfirmness, and experience in war, with the indolence and pusillanimity\r\nof the others. It is certain that the ears of Domitian himself were\r\nassailed by such discourses, while the best of his freedmen pressed him\r\nto the choice through motives of fidelity and affection, and the\r\nworst through envy and malignity, emotions to which he was of himself\r\nsufficiently prone. Thus Agricola, as well by his own virtues as the\r\nvices of others, was urged on precipitously to glory.\r\n\r\n42. The year now arrived in which the proconsulate of Asia or Africa\r\nmust fall by lot upon Agricola; [136] and as Civica had lately been put\r\nto death, Agricola was not unprovided with a lesson, nor Domitian with\r\nan example. [137] Some persons, acquainted with the secret inclinations\r\nof the emperor, came to Agricola, and inquired whether he intended to go\r\nto his province; and first, somewhat distantly, began to commend a life\r\nof leisure and tranquillity; then offered their services in procuring\r\nhim to be excused from the office; and at length, throwing off all\r\ndisguise, after using arguments both to persuade and intimidate him,\r\ncompelled him to accompany them to Domitian. The emperor, prepared to\r\ndissemble, and assuming an air of stateliness, received his petition for\r\nexcuse, and suffered himself to be formally thanked [138] for granting\r\nit, without blushing at so invidious a favor. He did not, however,\r\nbestow on Agricola the salary [139] usually offered to a proconsul, and\r\nwhich he himself had granted to others; either taking offence that it\r\nwas not requested, or feeling a consciousness that it would seem a bribe\r\nfor what he had in reality extorted by his authority. It is a principle\r\nof human nature to hate those whom we have injured; [140] and Domitian\r\nwas constitutionally inclined to anger, which was the more difficult\r\nto be averted, in proportion as it was the more disguised. Yet he was\r\nsoftened by the temper and prudence of Agricola; who did not think it\r\nnecessary, by a contumacious spirit, or a vain ostentation of liberty,\r\nto challenge fame or urge his fate. [141] Let those be apprised, who are\r\naccustomed to admire every opposition to control, that even under a\r\nbad prince men may be truly great; that submission and modesty, if\r\naccompanied with vigor and industry, will elevate a character to a\r\nheight of public esteem equal to that which many, through abrupt and\r\ndangerous paths, have attained, without benefit to their country, by an\r\nambitious death.\r\n\r\n43. His decease was a severe affliction to his family, a grief to his\r\nfriends, and a subject of regret even to foreigners, and those who had\r\nno personal knowledge of him. [142] The common people too, and the class\r\nwho little interest themselves about public concerns, were frequent\r\nin their inquiries at his house during his sickness, and made him the\r\nsubject of conversation at the forum and in private circles; nor did any\r\nperson either rejoice at the news of his death, or speedily forget it.\r\nTheir commiseration was aggravated by a prevailing report that he was\r\ntaken off by poison. I cannot venture to affirm anything certain of this\r\nmatter; [143] yet, during the whole course of his illness, the principal\r\nof the imperial freedmen and the most confidential of the physicians was\r\nsent much more frequently than was customary with a court whose visits\r\nwere chiefly paid by messages; whether that was done out of real\r\nsolicitude, or for the purposes of state inquisition. On the day of his\r\ndecease, it is certain that accounts of his approaching dissolution were\r\nevery instant transmitted to the emperor by couriers stationed for the\r\npurpose; and no one believed that the information, which so much pains\r\nwas taken to accelerate, could be received with regret. He put on,\r\nhowever, in his countenance and demeanor, the semblance of grief: for he\r\nwas now secured from an object of hatred, and could more easily conceal\r\nhis joy than his fear. It was well known that on reading the will, in\r\nwhich he was nominated co-heir [144] with the excellent wife and most\r\ndutiful daughter of Agricola, he expressed great satisfaction, as if it\r\nhad been a voluntary testimony of honor and esteem: so blind and corrupt\r\nhad his mind been rendered by continual adulation, that he was ignorant\r\nnone but a bad prince could be nominated heir to a good father.\r\n\r\n44. Agricola was born in the ides of June, during the third consulate of\r\nCaius Caesar; [145] he died in his fifty-sixth year, on the tenth of\r\nthe calends of September, when Collega and Priscus were consuls. [146]\r\nPosterity may wish to form an idea of his person. His figure was comely\r\nrather than majestic. In his countenance there was nothing to inspire\r\nawe; its character was gracious and engaging. You would readily have\r\nbelieved him a good man, and willingly a great one. And indeed, although\r\nhe was snatched away in the midst of a vigorous age, yet if his life be\r\nmeasured by his glory, it was a period of the greatest extent. For after\r\nthe full enjoyment of all that is truly good, which is found in virtuous\r\npursuits alone, decorated with consular and triumphal ornaments, what\r\nmore could fortune contribute to his elevation? Immoderate wealth did\r\nnot fall to his share, yet he possessed a decent affluence. [147] His\r\nwife and daughter surviving, his dignity unimpaired, his reputation\r\nflourishing, and his kindred and friends yet in safety, it may even be\r\nthought an additional felicity that he was thus withdrawn from impending\r\nevils. For, as we have heard him express his wishes of continuing to the\r\ndawn of the present auspicious day, and beholding Trajan in the imperial\r\nseat,--wishes in which he formed a certain presage of the event; so it\r\nis a great consolation, that by his untimely end he escaped that latter\r\nperiod, in which Domitian, not by intervals and remissions, but by a\r\ncontinued, and, as it were, a single act, aimed at the destruction of\r\nthe commonwealth. [148]\r\n\r\n45. Agricola did not behold the senate-house besieged, and the senators\r\nenclosed by a circle of arms; [149] and in one havoc the massacre of so\r\nmany consular men, the flight and banishment of so many honorable women.\r\nAs yet Carus Metius [150] was distinguished only by a single victory;\r\nthe counsels of Messalinus [151] resounded only through the Albanian\r\ncitadel; [152] and Massa Baebius [153] was himself among the accused.\r\nSoon after, our own hands [154] dragged Helvidius [155] to prison;\r\nourselves were tortured with the spectacle of Mauricus and Rusticus,\r\n[156] and sprinkled with the innocent blood of Senecio. [157]\r\n\r\nEven Nero withdrew his eyes from the cruelties he commanded. Under\r\nDomitian, it was the principal part of our miseries to behold and to be\r\nbeheld: when our sighs were registered; and that stern countenance, with\r\nits settled redness, [158] his defence against shame, was employed in\r\nnoting the pallid horror of so many spectators. Happy, O Agricola! not\r\nonly in the splendor of your life, but in the seasonableness of your\r\ndeath. With resignation and cheerfulness, from the testimony of those\r\nwho were present in your last moments, did you meet your fate, as\r\nif striving to the utmost of your power to make the emperor appear\r\nguiltless. But to myself and your daughter, besides the anguish of\r\nlosing a parent, the aggravating affliction remains, that it was not our\r\nlot to watch over your sick-bed, to support you when languishing, and to\r\nsatiate ourselves with beholding and embracing you. With what attention\r\nshould we have received your last instructions, and engraven them on our\r\nhearts! This is our sorrow; this is our wound: to us you were lost four\r\nyears before by a tedious absence. Everything, doubtless, O best of\r\nparents! was administered for your comfort and honor, while a most\r\naffectionate wife sat beside you; yet fewer tears were shed upon your\r\nbier, and in the last light which your eyes beheld, something was still\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\n46. If there be any habitation for the shades of the virtuous; if, as\r\nphilosophers suppose, exalted souls do not perish with the body; may\r\nyou repose in peace, and call us, your household, from vain regret and\r\nfeminine lamentations, to the contemplation of your virtues, which allow\r\nno place for mourning or complaining! Let us rather adorn your memory by\r\nour admiration, by our short-lived praises, and, as far as our natures\r\nwill permit, by an imitation of your example. This is truly to honor the\r\ndead; this is the piety of every near relation. I would also recommend\r\nit to the wife and daughter of this great man, to show their veneration\r\nof a husband's and a father's memory by revolving his actions and words\r\nin their breasts, and endeavoring to retain an idea of the form and\r\nfeatures of his mind, rather than of his person. Not that I would reject\r\nthose resemblances of the human figure which are engraven in brass or\r\nmarbles but as their originals are frail and perishable, so likewise are\r\nthey: while the form of the mind is eternal, and not to be retained\r\nor expressed by any foreign matter, or the artist's skill, but by the\r\nmanners of the survivors. Whatever in Agricola was the object of our\r\nlove, of our admiration, remains, and will remain in the minds of men,\r\ntransmitted in the records of fame, through an eternity of years. For,\r\nwhile many great personages of antiquity will be involved in a\r\ncommon oblivion with the mean and inglorious, Agricola shall survive,\r\nrepresented and consigned to future ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nA TREATISE ON THE SITUATION, MANNERS AND INHABITANTS OF GERMANY.\r\n\r\n[1] This treatise was written in the year of Rome 851, A.D. 98; during\r\nthe fourth consulate of the emperor Nerva, and the third of Trajan.\r\n\r\n[2] The Germany here meant is that beyond the Rhine. The Germania\r\nCisrhenana, divided into the Upper and Lower, was a part of Gallia\r\nBelgica.\r\n\r\n[3] Rhaetia comprehended the country of the Grisons, with part of Suabia\r\nand Bavaria.\r\n\r\n[4] Lower Hungary, and part of Austria.\r\n\r\n[5] The Carpathian mountains in Upper Hungary.\r\n\r\n[6] \"Broad promontories.\" Latos sinus. Sinus strictly signifies \"a\r\nbending,\" especially inwards. Hence it is applied to a gulf, or bay, of\r\nthe sea. And hence, again, by metonymy, to that projecting part of the\r\nland, whereby the gulf is formed; and still further to any promontory\r\nor peninsula. It is in this latter force it is here used;--and refers\r\nespecially to the Danish peninsula. See Livy xxvii, 30, xxxviii. 5;\r\nServius on Virgil, Aen. xi. 626.\r\n\r\n[7] Scandinavia and Finland, of which the Romans had a very slight\r\nknowledge, were supposed to be islands.\r\n\r\n[8] The mountains of the Grisons. That in which the Rhine rises is at\r\npresent called Vogelberg.\r\n\r\n[9] Now called Schwartzwald, or the Black Forest. The name Danubius was\r\ngiven to that portion of the river which is included between its source\r\nand Vindobona (Vienna); throughout the rest of its course it was called\r\nIster.\r\n\r\n[10] _Donec erumpat_. The term _erumpat_ is most correctly and\r\ngraphically employed; for the Danube discharges its waters into the\r\nEuxine with so great force, that its course may be distinctly traced for\r\nmiles out to sea.\r\n\r\n[11] There are now but five.\r\n\r\n[12] The ancient writers called all nations _indigenae_ (_i.e._ inde\r\ngeniti), or _autochthones_, \"sprung from the soil,\" of whose origin they\r\nwere ignorant.\r\n\r\n[13] It is, however, well established that the ancestors of the Germans\r\nmigrated by land from Asia. Tacitus here falls into a very common kind\r\nof error, in assuming a local fact (viz. the manner in which migrations\r\ntook place in the basin of the Mediterranean) to be the expression of a\r\ngeneral law.--ED.\r\n\r\n[14] Drusus, father of the emperor Claudius, was the first Roman general\r\nwho navigated the German Ocean. The difficulties and dangers which\r\nGermanicus met with from the storms of this sea are related in the\r\nAnnals, ii. 23.\r\n\r\n[15] All barbarous nations, in all ages, have applied verse to the same\r\nuse, as is still found to be the case among the North American Indians.\r\nCharlemagne, as we are told by Eginhart, \"wrote out and committed to\r\nmemory barbarous verses of great antiquity, in which the actions and\r\nwars of ancient kings were recorded.\"\r\n\r\n[16] The learned Leibnitz supposes this Tuisto to have been the Teut or\r\nTeutates so famous throughout Gaul and Spain, who was a Celto-Scythian\r\nking or hero, and subdued and civilized a great part of Europe and Asia.\r\nVarious other conjectures have been formed concerning him and his son\r\nMannus, but most of them extremely vague and improbable. Among the\r\nrest, it has been thought that in Mannus and his three sons an obscure\r\ntradition is preserved of Adam, and his sons Cain, Abel, and Seth; or of\r\nNoah, and his sons Shem, Ham, and Japhet.\r\n\r\n[17] Conringius interprets the names of the sons of Mannus into Ingäff,\r\nIstäf, and Hermin.\r\n\r\n[18] Pliny, iv. 14, embraces a middle opinion between these, and\r\nmentions five capital tribes. The Vindili, to whom belong the\r\nBurgundiones, Varini, Carini, and Guttones; the Ingaevones, including\r\nthe Cimbri, Teutoni, and Chauci; the Istaevones, near the Rhine, part\r\nof whom are the midland Cimbri; the Hermiones, containing the Suevi,\r\nHermunduri, Catti, and Cherusci; and the Peucini and Bastarnae,\r\nbordering upon the Dacians.\r\n\r\n[19] The Marsi appear to have occupied various portions of the northwest\r\npart of Germany at various times. In the time of Tiberius (A.D. 14) they\r\nsustained a great slaughter from the forces of Germanicus, who ravaged\r\ntheir country for fifty miles with fire and sword, sparing neither age\r\nnor sex, neither things profane nor sacred. (See Ann. i. 51.) At this\r\nperiod they were occupying the country in the neighborhood of the\r\nRura (Ruhr), a tributary of the Rhine. Probably this slaughter was the\r\ndestruction of them as a separate people; and by the time that Trajan\r\nsucceeded to the imperial power they seem to have been blotted out from\r\namongst the Germanic tribes. Hence their name will not be found in the\r\nfollowing account of Germany.\r\n\r\n[20] These people are mentioned by Strabo, vii. 1, 3. Their locality is\r\nnot very easy to determine.\r\n\r\n[21] See note, c. 38.\r\n\r\n[22] The Vandals are said to have derived their name from the German\r\nword _wendeln_, \"to wander.\" They began to be troublesome to the Romans\r\nA.D. 160, in the reigns of Aurelius and Verus. In A.D. 410 they made\r\nthemselves masters of Spain in conjunction with the Alans and Suevi,\r\nand received for their share what from them was termed Vandalusia\r\n(Andalusia). In A.D. 429 they crossed into Africa under Genseric, who\r\nnot only made himself master of Byzacium, Gaetulia, and part of Numidia,\r\nbut also crossed over into Italy, A.D. 455, and plundered Rome. After\r\nthe death of Genseric the Vandal power declined.\r\n\r\n[23] That is, those of the Marsi, Gambrivii, etc. Those of Ingaevones,\r\nIstaevones, and Hermiones, were not so much names of the people, as\r\nterms expressing their situation. For, according to the most learned\r\nGermans, the Ingaevones are _die Inwohner_, those dwelling inwards,\r\ntowards the sea; the Istaevones, _die Westwohner_, the inhabitants of\r\nthe western parts: and the Hermiones, _die Herumwohner_, the midland\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n[24] It is however found in an inscription so far back as the year of\r\nRome 531, before Christ 222, recording the victory of Claudius Marcellus\r\nover the Galli Insubres and their allies the Germans, at Clastidium, now\r\nChiastezzo in the Milanese.\r\n\r\n[25] This is illustrated by a passage in Caesar, Bell. Gall. ii. 4,\r\nwhere, after mentioning that several of the Belgae were descended from\r\nthe Germans who had formerly crossed the Rhine and expelled the Gauls,\r\nhe says, \"the first of these emigrants were the Condrusii, Eburones,\r\nCaeresi and Paemani, who were called by the common name of Germans.\"\r\nThe derivation of German is _Wehr mann_, a warrior, or man of war. This\r\nappellation was first used by the victorious Cisrhenane tribes, but not\r\nby the whole Transrhenane nation, till they gradually adopted it, as\r\nequally due to them on account of their military reputation. The Tungri\r\nwere formerly a people of great name, the relics of which still exist in\r\nthe extent of the district now termed the ancient diocese of Tongres.\r\n\r\n[26] Under this name Tacitus speaks of some German deity, whose\r\nattributes corresponded in the main with those of the Greek and\r\nRoman Hercules. What he was called by the Germans is a matter of\r\ndoubt.--_White_.\r\n\r\n[27] _Quem barditum vocant_. The word _barditus_ is of Gallic origin,\r\nbeing derived from _bardi_, \"bards;\" it being a custom with the Gauls\r\nfor bards to accompany the army, and celebrate the heroic deeds of their\r\ngreat warriors; so that _barditum_ would thus signify \"the fulfilment of\r\nthe bard's office.\" Hence it is clear that _barditum_ could not be used\r\ncorrectly here, inasmuch as amongst the Germans not any particular,\r\nappointed, body of men, but the whole army chanted forth the war-song.\r\nSome editions have _baritum_, which is said to be derived from the\r\nGerman word _beren_, or _baeren_, \"to shout;\" and hence it is translated\r\nin some dictionaries as, \"the German war-song.\" From the following\r\npassage extracted from Facciolati, it would seem, however, that German\r\ncritics repudiate this idea: \"De _barito_ clamore bellico, seu, ut\r\nquaedam habent exemplaria, _bardito_, nihil audiuimus nunc in Germaniâ:\r\nnisi hoc dixerimus, quòd _bracht_, vel _brecht_, milites Germani\r\nappellare consueverunt; concursum videlicet certantium, et clamorem\r\nad pugnam descendentium; quem _bar, bar, bar_, sonuisse nonnulli\r\naffirmant.\"--(Andr. Althameri, Schol. in C. Tacit De Germanis.) Ritter,\r\nhimself a German, affirms that _baritus_ is a reading worth nothing; and\r\nthat _barritus_ was not the name of the ancient German war-song, but\r\nof the shout raised by the Romans in later ages when on the point\r\nof engaging; and that it was derived \"a clamore barrorem, _i.e._\r\nelephantorum.\" The same learned editor considers that the words \"quem\r\nbarditum vocant\" have been originally the marginal annotation of some\r\nunsound scholar, and have been incorporated by some transcriber into the\r\ntext of his MS. copy, whence the error has spread. He therefore encloses\r\nthem between brackets, to show that, in his judgment, they are not the\r\ngenuine production of the pen of Tacitus.--_White_.\r\n\r\n[28] A very curious coincidence with the ancient German opinion\r\nconcerning the prophetic nature of the war-cry or song, appears in the\r\nfollowing passage of the Life of Sir Ewen Cameron, in \"Pennant's Tour,\"\r\n1769, Append, p. 363. At the battle of Killicrankie, just before the\r\nfight began, \"he (Sir Ewen) commanded such of the Camerons as were\r\nposted near him to make a great shout, which being seconded by those who\r\nstood on the right and left, ran quickly through the whole army, and was\r\nreturned by the enemy. But the noise of the muskets and cannon, with the\r\nechoing of the hills, made the Highlanders fancy that their shouts were\r\nmuch louder and brisker than those of the enemy, and Lochiel cried out,\r\n'Gentlemen, take courage, the day is ours: I am the oldest commander in\r\nthe army, and have always observed something ominous and fatal in such\r\na dull, hollow and feeble noise as the enemy made in their shout, which\r\nprognosticates that they are all doomed to die by our hands this night;\r\nwhereas ours was brisk, lively and strong, and shows we have vigor and\r\ncourage.' These words, spreading quickly through the army, animated\r\nthe troops in a strange manner. The event justified the prediction; the\r\nHighlanders obtained a complete victory.\"\r\n\r\n[29] Now Asburg in the county of Meurs.\r\n\r\n[30] The Greeks, by means of their colony at Marseilles, introduced\r\ntheir letters into Gaul, and the old Gallic coins have many Greek\r\ncharacters in their inscriptions. The Helvetians also, as we are\r\ninformed by Caesar, used Greek letters. Thence they might easily pass\r\nby means of commercial intercourse to the neighboring Germans. Count\r\nMarsili and others have found monuments with Greek inscriptions in\r\nGermany, but not of so early an age.\r\n\r\n[31] The large bodies of the Germans are elsewhere taken notice of by\r\nTacitus, and also by other authors. It would appear as if most of them\r\nwere at that time at least six feet high. They are still accounted some\r\nof the tallest people in Europe.\r\n\r\n[32] Bavaria and Austria.\r\n\r\n[33] The greater degree of cold when the country was overspread with\r\nwoods and marshes, made this observation more applicable than at\r\npresent. The same change of temperature from clearing and draining\r\nthe land has taken place in North America. It may be added, that the\r\nGermans, as we are afterwards informed, paid attention to no kind of\r\nculture but that of corn.\r\n\r\n[34] The cattle of some parts of Germany are at present remarkably\r\nlarge; so that their former smallness must have rather been owing to\r\nwant of care in feeding them and protecting them from the inclemencies\r\nof winter, and in improving the breed by mixtures, than to the nature of\r\nthe climate.\r\n\r\n[35] Mines both of gold and silver have since been discovered in\r\nGermany; the former, indeed, inconsiderable; but the latter, valuable.\r\n\r\n[36] As vice and corruption advanced among the Romans, their money\r\nbecame debased and adulterated. Thus Pliny, xxxiii. 3, relates, that\r\n\"Livius Drusus during his tribuneship, mixed an eighth part of brass\r\nwith the silver coin;\" and ibid. 9, \"that Antony the triumvir mixed iron\r\nwith the denarius: that some coined base metal, others diminished\r\nthe pieces, and hence it became an art to prove the goodness of the\r\ndenarii.\" One precaution for this purpose was cutting the edges like\r\nthe teeth of a saw, by which means it was seen whether the metal was\r\nthe same quite through, or was only plated. These were the Serrati, or\r\nserrated Denarii. The Bigati were those stamped with the figure of a\r\nchariot drawn by two horses, as were the Quadrigati with a chariot and\r\nfour horses. These were old coin, of purer silver than those of the\r\nemperors. Hence the preference of the Germans for certain kinds of\r\nspecies was founded on their apprehension of being cheated with false\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n[37] The Romans had the same predilection for silver coin, and probably\r\non the same account originally. Pliny, in the place above cited,\r\nexpresses his surprise that \"the Roman people had always imposed a\r\ntribute in silver on conquered nations; as at the end of the second\r\nPunic war, when they demanded an annual payment in silver for fifty\r\nyears, without any gold.\"\r\n\r\n[38] Iron was in great abundance in the bowels of the earth; but this\r\nbarbarous people had neither patience, skill, nor industry to dig and\r\nwork it. Besides, they made use of weapons of stone, great numbers of\r\nwhich are found in ancient tombs and barrows.\r\n\r\n[39] This is supposed to take its name from _pfriem_ or _priem_, the\r\npoint of a weapon. Afterwards, when iron grew more plentiful, the\r\nGermans chiefly used swords.\r\n\r\n[40] It appears, however, from Tacitus's Annals, ii. 14, that the length\r\nof these spears rendered them unmanageable in an engagement among trees\r\nand bushes.\r\n\r\n[41] Notwithstanding the manner of fighting is so much changed in modern\r\ntimes, the arms of the ancients are still in use. We, as well as they,\r\nhave two kinds of swords, the sharp-pointed, and edged (small sword and\r\nsabre). The broad lance subsisted till lately in the halberd; the spear\r\nand framea in the long pike and spontoon; the missile weapons in the war\r\nhatchet, or North American tomahawk. There are, besides, found in the\r\nold German barrows, perforated stone balls, which they threw by means of\r\nthongs passed through them.\r\n\r\n[42] _Nudi_. The Latin nudus, like the Greek _gemnos_, does not point\r\nout a person devoid of all clothing, but merely one without an upper\r\ngarment--clad merely in a vest or tunic, and that perhaps a short\r\none.--_White_.\r\n\r\n[43] This decoration at first denoted the valor, afterwards the\r\nnobility, of the bearer; and in process of time gave origin to the\r\narmorial ensigns so famous in the ages of chivalry. The shields of the\r\nprivate men were simply colored; those of the chieftains had the figures\r\nof animals painted on them.\r\n\r\n[44] Plutarch, in his Life of Marius, describes somewhat differently\r\nthe arms and equipage of the Cimbri. \"They wore (says he) helmets\r\nrepresenting the heads of wild beasts, and other unusual figures, and\r\ncrowned with a winged crest, to make them appear taller. They were\r\ncovered with iron coats of mail, and carried white glittering shields.\r\nEach had a battle-axe; and in close fight they used large heavy swords.\"\r\nBut the learned Eccard justly observes, that they had procured these\r\narms in their march; for the Holsatian barrows of that age contain few\r\nweapons of brass, and none of iron; but stone spear-heads, and instead\r\nof swords, the wedgelike bodies vulgarly called thunderbolts.\r\n\r\n[46] Casques (_cassis_) are of metal; helmets (_galea_) of\r\nleather--_Isidorus_.\r\n\r\n[46] This mode of fighting is admirably described by Caesar. \"The\r\nGermans engaged after the following manner:--There were 6,000 horse, and\r\nan equal number of the swiftest and bravest foot; who were chosen,\r\nman by man, by the cavalry, for their protection. By these they were\r\nattended in battle; to these they retreated; and, these, if they were\r\nhard pressed, joined them in the combat. If any fell wounded from their\r\nhorses, by these they were covered. If it were necessary to advance or\r\nretreat to any considerable distance, such agility had they acquired by\r\nexercise, that, supporting themselves by the horses' manes, they kept\r\npace with them.\"--Bell. Gall. i. 48.\r\n\r\n[47] To understand this, it is to be remarked, that the Germans were\r\ndivided into nations or tribes,--these into cantons, and these into\r\ndistricts or townships. The cantons (_pagi_ in Latin) were called by\r\nthemselves _gauen_. The districts or townships (_vici_) were called\r\n_hunderte_, whence the English hundreds. The name given to these select\r\nyouth, according to the learned Dithmar, was _die hunderte_, hundred\r\nmen. From the following passage in Caesar, it appears that in the more\r\npowerful tribes a greater number was selected from each canton. \"The\r\nnation of the Suevi is by far the greatest and most warlike of the\r\nGermans. They are said to inhabit a hundred cantons; from each of\r\nwhich a thousand men are sent annually to make war out of their own\r\nterritories. Thus neither the employments of agriculture, nor the use of\r\narms are interrupted.\"--Bell. Gall. iv. 1. The warriors were summoned\r\nby the _heribannum_, or army-edict; whence is derived the French\r\narrière-ban.\r\n\r\n[48] A wedge is described by Vegetius (iii. 19,) as a body of infantry,\r\nnarrow in front, and widening towards the rear; by which disposition\r\nthey were enabled to break the enemy's ranks, as all their weapons were\r\ndirected to one spot. The soldiers called it a boar's head.\r\n\r\n[49] It was also considered as the height of injury to charge a person\r\nwith this unjustly. Thus, by the _Salic_ law, tit. xxxiii, 5, a fine\r\nof 600 denarii (about 9_l._) is imposed upon \"every free man who shall\r\naccuse another of throwing down his shield, and running away, without\r\nbeing able to prove it.\"\r\n\r\n[50] Vertot (Mém. de l'Acad. des Inscrip.) supposes that the French\r\n_maires du palais_ had their origin from these German military leaders.\r\nIf the kings were equally conspicuous for valor as for birth, they\r\nunited the regal with the military command. Usually, however, several\r\nkings and generals were assembled in their wars. In this case, the most\r\neminent commanded, and obtained a common jurisdiction in war, which did\r\nnot subsist in time of peace. Thus Caesar (Bell. Gall. vi.) says, \"In\r\npeace they have no common magistracy.\" A general was elected by placing\r\nhim on a shield, and lifting him on the shoulders of the bystanders. The\r\nsame ceremonial was observed in the election of kings.\r\n\r\n[51] Hence Ambiorix, king of the Eburones, declare that \"the nature of\r\nhis authority was such, that the people had no less power over him, than\r\nhe over the people.\"--Caesar, Bell. Gall. v. The authority of the North\r\nAmerican chiefs almost exactly similar.\r\n\r\n[52] The power of life and death, however, was in the hands of\r\nmagistrates. Thus Caesar: \"When a state engages either in an offensive\r\nor defensive war, magistrates are chosen to preside over it, and\r\nexercise power of life and death.\"--Bell. Gall. vi. The infliction of\r\npunishments was committed to the priests, in order to give them more\r\nsolemnity, and render them less invidious.\r\n\r\n[53] _Effigiesque et signa quaedam_. That effigies does not mean the\r\nimages of their deities is proved by that is stated at chap. ix., viz.\r\nthat they deemed it derogatory to their deities to represent them in\r\nhuman form; and, if in human form, we may argue, _a fortiori_, in the\r\nform of the lower animals. The interpretation of the passage will be\r\nbest derived from Hist. iv. 22, where Tacitus says:--\"Depromptae silvis\r\nlucisve ferarum imagines, ut cuique genti inire praelium mos est.\" It\r\nwould hence appear that these effigies and signa were images of wild\r\nanimals, and were national standards preserved with religious care in\r\nsacred woods and groves, whence they were brought forth when the clan or\r\ntribe was about to take the field.--_White_.\r\n\r\n[54] They not only interposed to prevent the flight of their husbands\r\nand sons, but, in desperate emergencies, themselves engaged in battle.\r\nThis happened on Marius's defeat of the Cimbri (hereafter to be\r\nmentioned); and Dio relates, that when Marcus Aurelius overthrew the\r\nMarcomanni, Quadi, and other German allies, the bodies of women in armor\r\nwere found among the slain.\r\n\r\n[55] Thus, in the army of Ariovistus, the women, with their hair\r\ndishevelled, and weeping, besought the soldiers not to deliver them\r\ncaptives to the Romans.--Caesar, Bell. Gall. i.\r\n\r\n[56] Relative to this, perhaps, is a circumstance mentioned by Suetonius\r\nin his Life of Augustus. \"From some nations he attempted to exact a new\r\nkind of hostages, women: because he observed that those of the male sex\r\nwere disregarded.\"--Aug. xxi.\r\n\r\n[57] See the same observation with regard to the Celtic women, in\r\nPlutarch, on the virtues of women. The North Americans pay a similar\r\nregard to their females.\r\n\r\n[58] A remarkable instance of this is given by Caesar. \"When he inquired\r\nof the captives the reason why Ariovistus did not engage, he learned,\r\nthat it was because the matrons, who among the Germans are accustomed\r\nto pronounce, from their divinations, whether or not a battle will be\r\nfavorable, had declared that they would not prove victorious, if they\r\nshould fight before the new moon.\"--Bell. Gall. i. The cruel manner in\r\nwhich the Cimbrian women performed their divinations is thus related\r\nby Strabo: \"The women who follow the Cimbri to war, are accompanied\r\nby gray-haired prophetesses, in white vestments, with canvas mantles\r\nfastened by clasps, a brazen girdle, and naked feet. These go with drawn\r\nswords through the camp, and, striking down those of the prisoners that\r\nthey meet, drag them to a brazen kettle, holding about twenty amphorae.\r\nThis has a kind of stage above it, ascending on which, the priestess\r\ncuts the throat of the victim, and, from the manner in which the blood\r\nflows into the vessel, judges of the future event. Others tear open\r\nthe bodies of the captives thus butchered, and, from inspection of the\r\nentrails, presage victory to their own party.\"--Lib. vii.\r\n\r\n[59] She was afterwards taken prisoner by Rutilius Gallicus. Statius, in\r\nhis Sylvae, i. 4, refers to this event. Tacitus has more concerning her\r\nin his History, iv. 61.\r\n\r\n[60] Viradesthis was a goddess of the Tungri; Harimella, another\r\nprovincial deity; whose names were found by Mr. Pennant inscribed on\r\naltars at the Roman station at Burrens. These were erected by the German\r\nauxiliaries.--Vide Tour in Scotland, 1772, part ii. p. 406.\r\n\r\n[61] Ritter considers that here is a reference to the servile flattery\r\nof the senate as exhibited in the time of Nero, by the deification of\r\nPoppaea's infant daughter, and afterwards of herself. (See Ann. xv.\r\n23, Dion. lxiii, Ann. xiv. 3.) There is no contradiction in the present\r\npassage to that found at Hist. iv. 61, where Tacitus says, \"plerasque\r\nfeminarum fatidicas et, augescente superstitione, arbitrantur deas;\"\r\n_i.e._ they deem (_arbitrantur_) very many of their women possessed of\r\nprophetic powers, and, as their religious feeling increases, they deem\r\n(_arbitrantur_) them goddesses, _i.e._ possessed of a superhuman nature;\r\nthey do not, however, make them goddesses and worship them, as the\r\nRomans did Poppaea and her infant, which is covertly implied in\r\n_facerent deas_.--_White_.\r\n\r\n[62] Mercury, _i.e._ a god whom Tacitus thus names, because his\r\nattributes resembled those of the Roman Mercury. According to Paulus\r\nDiaconus (de Gestis Langobardorum, i. 9), this deity was Wodun, or\r\nGwodan, called also Odin. Mallet (North. Ant. ch. v.) says, that in\r\nthe Icelandic mythology he is called \"the terrible and severe God, the\r\nFather of Slaughter, he who giveth victory and receiveth courage in\r\nthe conflict, who nameth those that are to be slain.\" \"The Germans drew\r\ntheir gods by their own character, who loved nothing so much themselves\r\nas to display their strength and power in battle, and to signalize their\r\nvengeance upon their enemies by slaughter and desolation.\" There remain\r\nto this day some traces of the worship paid to Odin in the name given by\r\nalmost all the people of the north to the fourth day of the week, which\r\nwas formerly consecrated to him. It is called by a name which signifies\r\n\"Odin's day;\" \"Old Norse, _Odinsdagr_; Swedish and Danish, _Onsdag_;\r\nAnglo-Saxon, _Wodenesdaeg_, _Wodnesdaeg_; Dutch, _Woensdag_; English,\r\nWednesday. As Odin or Wodun was supposed to correspond to the Mercury of\r\nthe Greeks and Romans, the name of this day was expressed in Latin _Dies\r\nMercurii_.\"--_White_.\r\n\r\n[63] \"The appointed time for these sacrifices,\" says Mallet (North. Ant.\r\nch. vi.), \"was always determined by a superstitious opinion which\r\nmade the northern nations regard the number 'three' as sacred and\r\nparticularly dear to the gods. Thus, in every ninth month they renewed\r\nthe bloody ceremony, which was to last nine days, and every day they\r\noffered up nine living victims, whether men or animals. But the most\r\nsolemn sacrifices were those which were offered up at Upsal in Sweden\r\nevery ninth year....\" After stating the compulsory nature of the\r\nattendance at this festival, Mallet adds, \"Then they chose among the\r\ncaptives in time of war, and among the slaves in time of peace, nine\r\npersons to be sacrificed. In whatever manner they immolated men, the\r\npriest always took care in consecrating the victim to pronounce certain\r\nwords, as 'I devote thee to Odin,' 'I send thee to Odin.'\" See Lucan i.\r\n444.\r\n\r\n  \"Et quibus immitis placatur sanguine diro\r\n  Teutates, horrensque feris altaribus Hesus.\"\r\n\r\nTeutates is Mercury, Hesus, Mars. So also at iii. 399, &c.\r\n\r\n  \"Lucus erat longo nunquam violatus ab aevo.\r\n  ... Barbara ritu\r\n  Sacra Deum, structae diris altaribus arae,\r\n  Omnis et humanis lustrata cruoribus arbor.\"\r\n\r\n[64] That is, as in the preceding case, a deity whose attributes\r\ncorresponded to those of the Roman Mars. This appears to have been\r\nnot _Thor_, who is rather the representative of the Roman Jupiter, but\r\n_Tyr_, \"a warrior god, and the protector of champions and brave men!\"\r\n\"From _Tyr_ is derived the name given to the third day of the week in\r\nmost of the Teutonic languages, and which has been rendered into Latin\r\nby _Dies Martis_. Old Norse, _Tirsdagr_, _Tisdagr_; Swedish, _Tisdag_;\r\nDanish, _Tirsdag_; German, _Dienstag_; Dutch, _Dingsdag_; Anglo-Saxon,\r\n_Tyrsdaeg_, _Tyvesdag_, _Tivesdaeg_; English, _Tuesday_\"--(Mallet's\r\nNorth. Ant. ch. v.)--_White_.\r\n\r\n[65] The Suevi appear to have been the Germanic tribes, and this also\r\nthe worship spoken of at chap. xl. _Signum in modum liburnae figuration\r\n_corresponds with the _vehiculum_ there spoken of; the real thing being,\r\naccording to Ritter's view, a pinnace placed on wheels. That _signum\r\nipsum _(\"the very symbol\") does not mean any image of the goddess, may\r\nbe gathered also from ch. xl., where the goddess herself, _si credere\r\nvelis_, is spoken of as being washed in the sacred lake.\r\n\r\n[66] As the Romans in their ancient coins, many of which are now extant,\r\nrecorded the arrival of Saturn by the stern of a ship; so other nations\r\nhave frequently denoted the importation of a foreign religious rite by\r\nthe figure of a galley on their medals.\r\n\r\n[67] Tacitus elsewhere speaks of temples of German divinities (e.g. 40;\r\nTemplum Nerthae, Ann. i. 51; Templum Tanfanae); but a consecrated grove,\r\nor any other sacred place, was called templum by the Romans.\r\n\r\n[68] The Scythians are mentioned by Herodotus, and the Alans by Ammianus\r\nMarcellinus, as making use of these divining rods. The German method of\r\ndivination with them is illustrated by what is said by Saxo-Grammaticus\r\n(Hist. Dan. xiv, 288) of the inhabitants of the Isle of Rugen in the\r\nBaltic Sea: \"Throwing, by way of lots, three pieces of wood, white in\r\none part, and black in another, into their laps, they foretold good\r\nfortune by the coming up of the white; bad by that of the black.\"\r\n\r\n[69] The same practice obtained among the Persians, from whom the\r\nGermans appear to be sprung. Darius was elected king by the neighing\r\nof a horse; sacred white horses were in the army of Cyrus; and Xerxes,\r\nretreating after his defeat, was preceded by the sacred horses\r\nand consecrated chariot. Justin (i. 10) mentions the cause of this\r\nsuperstition, viz. that \"the Persians believed the Sun to be the only\r\nGod, and horses to be peculiarly consecrated to him.\" The priest of the\r\nIsle of Rugen also took auspices from a white horse, as may be seen in\r\nSaxo-Grammaticus.\r\n\r\n[70] Montesquieu finds in this custom the origin of the duel, and of\r\nknight-errantry.\r\n\r\n[71] This remarkable passage, so curious in political history, is\r\ncommented on by Montesquieu, in his Spirit of Laws. vi 11. That\r\ncelebrated author expresses his surprise at the existence of such a\r\nbalance between liberty and authority in the forests of Germany; and\r\ntraces the origin of the English constitution from this source. Tacitus\r\nagain mentions the German form of government in his Annals, iv. 33.\r\n\r\n[72] The high antiquity of this made of reckoning appears from the Book\r\nof Genesis. \"The evening and the morning were the first day.\" The Gauls,\r\nwe are informed by Caesar, \"assert that, according to the tradition of\r\ntheir Druids, they are all sprung from Father Dis; on which account they\r\nreckon every period of time according to the number of nights, not of\r\ndays; and observe birthdays and the beginnings of months and years in\r\nsuch a manner, that the day seems to follow the night.\" (Bell. Gall.\r\nvi. 18.) The vestiges of this method of computation still appear in the\r\nEnglish language, in the terms se'nnight and fort'night.\r\n\r\n[73] _Ut turbae placuit_. Doederlein interprets this passage as\r\nrepresenting the confused way in which the people took their seats in\r\nthe national assembly, without reference to order, rank, age, &c.\r\nIt rather represents, however, that the people, not the chieftains,\r\ndetermined when the business of the council should begin.--_White_.\r\n\r\n[74] And in an open plain. Vast heaps of stone still remaining, denote\r\nthe scenes of these national councils. (See Mallet's Introduct. to Hist.\r\nof Denmark.) The English Stonehenge has been supposed a relic of this\r\nkind. In these assemblies are seen the origin of those which, under the\r\nMerovingian race of French kings, were called the Fields of March;\r\nunder the Carlovingian, the Fields of May; then, the Plenary Courts of\r\nChristmas and Easter; and lastly, the States General.\r\n\r\n[75] The speech of Civilis was received with this expression of\r\napplause. Tacitus, Hist. iv. 15.\r\n\r\n[76] Gibbeted alive. Heavy penalties were denounced against those who\r\nshould take them down, alive or dead. These are particularized in the\r\nSalic law.\r\n\r\n[77] By cowards and dastards, in this passage, are probably meant those\r\nwho, being summoned to war, refused or neglected to go. Caesar (Bell.\r\nGall. vi. 22) mentions, that those who refused to follow their chiefs\r\nto war were considered as deserters and traitors. And, afterwards, the\r\nemperor Clothaire made the following edict, preserved in the Lombard\r\nlaw: \"Whatever freeman, summoned to the defence of his country by his\r\nCount, or his officers, shall neglect to go, and the enemy enter the\r\ncountry to lay it waste, or otherwise damage our liege subjects,\r\nhe shall incur a capital punishment.\" As the crimes of cowardice,\r\ntreachery, and desertion were so odious and ignominious among the\r\nGermans, we find by the Salic law, that penalties were annexed to the\r\nunjust imputation of them.\r\n\r\n[78] These were so rare and so infamous among the Germans, that barely\r\ncalling a person by a name significant of them was severely punished.\r\n\r\n[79] Incestuous people were buried alive in bogs in Scotland. Pennant's\r\nTour in Scotland, 1772; part i. p. 351; and part ii. p. 421.\r\n\r\n[80] Among these slighter offences, however, were reckoned homicide,\r\nadultery, theft, and many others of a similar kind. This appears from\r\nthe laws of the Germans, and from a subsequent passage of Tacitus\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n[81] These were at that time the only riches of the country, as was\r\nalready observed in this treatise. Afterwards gold and silver became\r\nplentiful: hence all the mulcts required by the Salic law are pecuniary.\r\nMoney, however, still bore a fixed proportion to cattle; as appears from\r\nthe Saxon law (Tit. xviii.): \"The Solidus is of two kinds; one contains\r\ntwo tremisses, that is, a beeve of twelve months, or a sheep with its\r\nlamb; the other, three tremisses, or a beeve of sixteen months. Homicide\r\nis compounded for by the lesser solidus; other crimes by the greater.\"\r\nThe Saxons had their Weregeld,--the Scotch their Cro, Galnes, and\r\nKelchin,--and the Welsh their Gwerth, and Galanus, or compensations for\r\ninjuries; and cattle were likewise the usual fine. Vide Pennant's Tour\r\nin Wales of 1773, pp. 273, 274.\r\n\r\n[82] This mulct is frequently in the Salic law called \"fred,\" that is,\r\npeace; because it was paid to the king or state, as guardians of the\r\npublic peace.\r\n\r\n[83] A brief account of the civil economy of the Germans will here be\r\nuseful. They were divided into nations; of which some were under a\r\nregal government, others a republican. The former had kings, the latter\r\nchiefs. Both in kingdoms and republics, military affairs were under the\r\nconduct of the generals. The nations were divided into cantons; each of\r\nwhich was superintended by a chief, or count, who administered justice\r\nin it. The cantons were divided into districts or hundreds, so called\r\nbecause they contained a hundred vills or townships. In each hundred\r\nwas a companion, or centenary, chosen from the people, before whom small\r\ncauses were tried. Before the count, all causes, as well great as small,\r\nwere amenable. The centenaries are called companions by Tacitus, after\r\nthe custom of the Romans; among whom the titles of honor were, Caesar,\r\nthe Legatus or Lieutenant of Caesar, and his comites, or companions. The\r\ncourts of justice were held in the open air, on a rising ground, beneath\r\nthe shade of an oak, elm, or some other large tree.\r\n\r\n[84] Even judges were armed on the seat of justice. The Romans, on\r\nthe contrary, never went armed but when actually engaged in military\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n[85] These are the rudiments of the famous institution of chivalry. The\r\nsons of kings appear to have received arms from foreign princes. Hence,\r\nwhen Audoin, after overcoming the Gepidae, was requested by the Lombards\r\nto dine with his son Alboin, his partner in the victory, he refused;\r\nfor, says he, \"you know it is not customary with us for a king's son\r\nto dine with his father, until he has received arms from the king of\r\nanother country.\"--Warnefrid, De gestis Langobardorum, i. 23.\r\n\r\n[86] An allusion to the _toga virilis_ of the Romans. The German youth\r\nwere presented with the shield and spear probably at twelve or fifteen\r\nyears of age. This early initiation into the business of arms gave them\r\nthat warlike character for which they were so celebrated. Thus, Seneca\r\n(Epist. 46) says, \"A native of Germany brandishes, while yet a boy,\r\nhis slender javelin.\" And again (in his book on Anger, i. 11), \"Who are\r\nbraver than the Germans?--who more impetuous in the charge?--who fonder\r\nof arms, in the use of which they are born and nourished, which are\r\ntheir only care?--who more inured to hardships, insomuch that for the\r\nmost part they provide no covering for their bodies, no retreat against\r\nthe perpetual severity of the climate?\"\r\n\r\n[87] Hence it seems that these noble lads were deemed _principes_ in\r\nrank, yet had their position among the _comites_ only. The German word\r\n_Gesell_ is peculiarly appropriated to these comrades in arms. So highly\r\nwere they esteemed in Germany, that for killing or hurting them a fine\r\nwas exacted treble to that for other freemen.\r\n\r\n[88] Hence, when Chonodomarus, king of the Alamanni, was taken prisoner\r\nby the Romans, \"his companions, two hundred in number, and three friends\r\npeculiarly attached to him, thinking it infamous to survive their\r\nprince, or not to die for him, surrendered themselves to be put in\r\nbonds.\"--Ammianus Marcellinus, xvi. 13.\r\n\r\n[89] Hence Montesquieu (Spirit of Laws, xxx, 3) justly derives the\r\norigin of vassalage. At first, the prince gave to his nobles arms and\r\nprovision: as avarice advanced, money, and then lands, were required,\r\nwhich from benefices became at length hereditary possessions, and were\r\ncalled fiefs. Hence the establishment of the feudal system.\r\n\r\n[90] Caesar, with less precision, says, \"The Germans pass their whole\r\nlives in hunting and military exercises.\" (Bell. Gall, vi. 21.) The\r\npicture drawn by Tacitus is more consonant to the genius of a barbarous\r\npeople: besides that, hunting being the employment but of a few months\r\nof the year, a greater part must necessarily be passed in indolence\r\nby those who had no other occupation. In this circumstance, and those\r\nafterwards related, the North American savages exactly agree with the\r\nancient Germans.\r\n\r\n[91] This apparent contradiction is, however, perfectly agreeable to the\r\nprinciples of human nature. Among people governed by impulse more than\r\nreason, everything is in the extreme: war and peace; motion and rest;\r\nlove and hatred; none are pursued with moderation.\r\n\r\n[92] These are the rudiments of tributes; though the contributions\r\nhere spoken of were voluntary, and without compulsion. The origin of\r\nexchequers is pointed out above, where \"part of the mulct\" is said to\r\nbe \"paid to the king or state.\" Taxation was taught the Germans by the\r\nRomans, who levied taxes upon them.\r\n\r\n[93] So, in after-times, when tributes were customary, 500 oxen or cows\r\nwere required annually from the Saxons by the French kings Clothaire\r\nI. and Pepin. (See Eccard, tom. i. pp. 84, 480.) Honey, corn, and other\r\nproducts of the earth, were likewise received in tribute. (Ibid. p.\r\n392.)\r\n\r\n[94] For the expenses of war, and other necessities of state, and\r\nparticularly the public entertainments. Hence, besides the Steora, or\r\nannual tribute, the Osterstuopha, or Easter cup, previous to the public\r\nassembly of the Field of March, was paid to the French kings.\r\n\r\n[95] This was a dangerous lesson, and in the end proved ruinous to\r\nthe Roman empire. Herodian says of the Germans in his time, \"They\r\nare chiefly to be prevailed upon by bribes; being fond of money, and\r\ncontinually selling peace to the Romans for gold.\"--Lib. vi. 139.\r\n\r\n[96] This custom was of long duration; for there is not the mention of a\r\nsingle city in Ammianus Marcellinus, who wrote on the wars of the Romans\r\nin Germany. The names of places in Ptolemy (ii. 11) are not, therefore,\r\nthose of cities, but of scattered villages. The Germans had not even\r\nwhat we should call towns, notwithstanding Caesar asserts the contrary.\r\n\r\n[97] The space surrounding the house, and fenced in by hedges, was that\r\ncelebrated Salic land, which descended to the male line, exclusively of\r\nthe female.\r\n\r\n[98] The danger of fire was particularly urgent in time of war; for,\r\nas Caesar informs us, these people were acquainted with a method of\r\nthrowing red-hot clay bullets from slings, and burning javelins, on the\r\nthatch of houses. (Bell. Gall. v. 42.)\r\n\r\n[99] Thus likewise Mela (ii. 1), concerning the Sarmatians: \"On account\r\nof the length and severity of their winters, they dwell under ground,\r\neither in natural or artificial caverns.\" At the time that Germany was\r\nlaid waste by a forty years' war, Kircher saw many of the natives who,\r\nwith their flocks, herds, and other possessions, took refuge in the\r\ncaverns of the highest mountains. For many other curious particulars\r\nconcerning these and other subterranean caves, see his Mundus\r\nSubterraneus, viii. 3, p. 100. In Hungary, at this day, corn is commonly\r\nstored in subterranean chambers.\r\n\r\n[100] Near Newbottle, the seat of the Marquis of Lothian, are some\r\nsubterraneous apartments and passages cut out of the live rock, which\r\nhad probably served for the same purposes of winter-retreats and\r\ngranaries as those dug by the ancient Germans. Pennant's Tour in 1769,\r\n4to, p.63.\r\n\r\n[101] This was a kind of mantle of a square form, called also _rheno_.\r\nThus Caesar (Bell. Gall. vi. 21): \"They use skins for clothing, or the\r\nshort rhenones, and leave the greatest part of the body naked.\" Isidore\r\n(xix. 23) describes the rhenones as \"garments covering the shoulders\r\nand breast, as low as the navel, so rough and shaggy that they are\r\nimpenetrable to rain.\" Mela (iii. 3), speaking of the Germans, says,\r\n\"The men are clothed only with the sagum, or the bark of trees, even in\r\nthe depth of winter.\"\r\n\r\n[102] All savages are fond of variety of colors; hence the Germans\r\nspotted their furs with the skins of other animals, of which those\r\nhere mentioned were probably of the seal kind. This practice is still\r\ncontinued with regard to the ermine, which is spotted with black\r\nlamb's-skin.\r\n\r\n[103] The Northern Sea, and Frozen Ocean.\r\n\r\n[104] Pliny testifies the same thing; and adds, that \"the women\r\nbeyond the Rhine are not acquainted with any more elegant kind of\r\nclothing.\"--xix. 1.\r\n\r\n[105] Not that rich and costly purple in which the Roman nobility shone,\r\nbut some ordinary material, such as the _vaccinium_, which Pliny says\r\nwas used by the Gauls as a purple dye for the garments of the slaves,\r\n(xvi. 18.)\r\n\r\n[106] The chastity of the Germans, and their strict regard to the laws\r\nof marriage, are witnessed by all their ancient codes of law. The purity\r\nof their manners in this respect afforded a striking contrast to the\r\nlicentiousness of the Romans in the decline of the empire, and is\r\nexhibited in this light by Salvian, in his treatise De Gubernatione Dei,\r\nlib. vii.\r\n\r\n[107] Thus we find in Caesar (Bell. Gall. i. 53) that Ariovistus had\r\ntwo wives. Others had more. This indulgence proved more difficult to\r\nabolish, as it was considered as a mark of opulence, and an appendage of\r\nnobility.\r\n\r\n[108] The Germans purchased their wives, as appears from the following\r\nclauses in the Saxon law concerning marriage: \"A person who espouses a\r\nwife shall pay to her parents 300 solidi (about 180_l._ sterling);\r\nbut if the marriage be without the consent of the parents, the damsel,\r\nhowever, consenting, he shall pay 600 solidi. If neither the parents nor\r\ndamsel consent, that is, if she be carried off by violence, he shall pay\r\n300 solidi to the parents, and 340 to the damsel, and restore her to her\r\nparents.\"\r\n\r\n[109] Thus in the Saxon law, concerning dowries, it is said: \"The\r\nOstfalii and Angrarii determine, that if a woman have male issue, she\r\nis to possess the dower she received in marriage during her life, and\r\ntransmit it to her sons.\"\r\n\r\n[110] _Ergo septae pudicitiâ agunt_. Some editions have _septâ\r\npudicitiâ_. This would imply, however, rather the result of the care and\r\nwatchfulness of their husbands; whereas it seems the object of Tacitus\r\nto show that this their chastity was the effect of innate virtue, and\r\nthis is rather expressed by _septae pudicitiâ_, which is the reading of\r\nthe Arundelian MS.\r\n\r\n[111] Seneca speaks with great force and warmth on this subject:\r\n\"Nothing is so destructive to morals as loitering at public\r\nentertainments; for vice more easily insinuates itself into the heart\r\nwhen softened by pleasure. What shall I say! I return from them more\r\ncovetous ambitious, and luxurious.\"--Epist. vii.\r\n\r\n[112] The Germans had a great regard for the hair, and looked upon\r\ncutting it off as a heavy disgrace; so that this was made a punishment\r\nfor certain crimes, and was resented as an injury if practised upon an\r\ninnocent person.\r\n\r\n[113] From an epistle of St. Boniface, archbishop of Mentz, to\r\nEthelbald, king of England, we learn that among the Saxons the women\r\nthemselves inflicted the punishment for violated chastity; \"In ancient\r\nSaxony (now Westphalia), if a virgin pollute her father's house, or a\r\nmarried woman prove false to her vows, sometimes she is forced to put an\r\nend to her own life by the halter, and over the ashes of her burned body\r\nher seducer is hanged: sometimes a troop of females assembling lead her\r\nthrough the circumjacent villages, lacerating her body, stripped to\r\nthe girdle, with rods and knives; and thus, bloody and full of minute\r\nwounds, she is continually met by new tormenters, who in their zeal for\r\nchastity do not quit her till she is dead, or scarcely alive, in order\r\nto inspire a dread of such offences.\" See Michael Alford's Annales\r\nEcclesiae Anglo-Saxon., and Eccard.\r\n\r\n[114] A passage in Valerius Maximus renders it probable that the\r\nCimbrian states were of this number: \"The wives of the Teutones besought\r\nMarius, after his victory, that he would deliver them as a present to\r\nthe Vestal virgins; affirming that they should henceforth, equally with\r\nthemselves, abstain from the embraces of the other sex. This request not\r\nbeing granted, they all strangled themselves the ensuing night.\"--Lib.\r\nvi. 1.3.\r\n\r\n[115] Among the Heruli, the wife was expected to hang herself at once at\r\nthe grave of her husband, if she would not live in perpetual infamy.\r\n\r\n[116] This expression may signify as well the murder of young children,\r\nas the procurement of abortion; both which crimes were severely punished\r\nby the German laws.\r\n\r\n[117] _Quemquam ex agnatis_. By _agnati_ generally in Roman law were\r\nmeant relations by the father's side; here it signifies children born\r\nafter there was already an heir to the name and property of the father.\r\n\r\n[118] Justin has a similar thought concerning the Scythians: \"Justice is\r\ncultivated by the dispositions of the people, not by the laws.\" (ii.\r\n2.) How inefficacious the good laws here alluded to by Tacitus were\r\nin preventing enormities among the Romans, appears from the frequent\r\ncomplaints of the senators, and particularly of Minucius Felix; \"I\r\nbehold you, exposing your babes to the wild beasts and birds, or\r\nstrangling the unhappy wretches with your own hands. Some of you, by\r\nmeans of drugs, extinguish the newly-formed man within your bowels, and\r\nthus commit parricide on your offspring before you bring them into the\r\nworld.\" (Octavius, c. 30.) So familiar was this practice grown at Rome,\r\nthat the virtuous Pliny apologises for it, alleging that \"the great\r\nfertility of some women may require such a licence.\"--xxix. 4, 37.\r\n\r\n[119] _Nudi ac sordidi_ does not mean \"in nakedness and filth,\" as most\r\ntranslators have supposed. Personal filth is inconsistent with the daily\r\npractice of bathing mentioned c. 22; and _nudus_ does not necessarily\r\nimply absolute nakedness (see note 4, p. 293).\r\n\r\n[120] This age appears at first to have been twelve years; for then a\r\nyouth became liable to the penalties of law. Thus in the Salic law it is\r\nsaid, \"If a child under twelve commit a fault, 'fred,' or a mulct, shall\r\nnot be required of him.\" Afterwards the term was fifteen years of\r\nage. Thus in the Ripuary law, \"A child under fifteen shall not be\r\nresponsible.\" Again, \"If a man die, or be killed, and leave a son;\r\nbefore he have completed his fifteenth year, he shall neither prosecute\r\na cause, nor be called upon to answer in a suit: but at this term, he\r\nmust either answer himself, or choose an advocate. In like manner with\r\nregard to the female sex.\" The Burgundian law provides to the same\r\neffect. This then was the term of majority, which in later times, when\r\nheavier armor was used, was still longer delayed.\r\n\r\n[121] This is illustrated by a passage in Caesar (Bell. Gall. vi. 21):\r\n\"They who are the latest in proving their virility are most commended.\r\nBy this delay they imagine the stature is increased, the strength\r\nimproved, and the nerves fortified. To have knowledge of the other\r\nsex before twenty years of age, is accounted in the highest degree\r\nscandalous.\"\r\n\r\n[122] Equal not only in age and constitution, but in condition. Many of\r\nthe German codes of law annex penalties to those of both sexes who marry\r\npersons of inferior rank.\r\n\r\n[123] Hence, in the history of the Merovingian kings of France, so many\r\ninstances of regard to sisters and their children appear, and so many\r\nwars undertaken on their account.\r\n\r\n[124] The court paid at Rome to rich persons without children, by the\r\nHaeredipetae, or legacy-hunters, is a frequent subject of censure and\r\nridicule with the Roman writers.\r\n\r\n[125] Avengers of blood are mentioned in the law of Moses, Numb. xxxv.\r\n19. In the Roman law also, under the head of \"those who on account of\r\nunworthiness are deprived of their inheritance,\" it is pronounced, that\r\n\"such heirs as are proved to have neglected revenging the testator's\r\ndeath, shall be obliged to restore the entire profits.\"\r\n\r\n[126] It was a wise provision, that among this fierce and warlike\r\npeople, revenge should be commuted for a payment. That this intention\r\nmight not be frustrated by the poverty of the offender, his whole family\r\nwere conjointly bound to make compensation.\r\n\r\n[127] All uncivilized nations agree in this property, which becomes less\r\nnecessary as a nation improves in the arts of civil life.\r\n\r\n[128] _Convictibus et hospitiis_. \"Festivities and entertainments.\" The\r\nformer word applies to friends and fellow-countrymen; the latter, to\r\nthose not of the same tribe, and foreigners. Caesar (Bell. Gall. vi. 23)\r\nsays, \"They think it unlawful to offer violence to their guests, who,\r\non whatever occasion they come to them, are protected from injury,\r\nand considered as sacred. Every house is open to them, and provision\r\neverywhere set before them.\" Mela (iii. 3) says of the Germans, \"They\r\nmake right consist in force, so that they are not ashamed of robbery:\r\nthey are only kind to their guests, and merciful to suppliants. The\r\nBurgundian law lays a fine of three solidi on every man who refuses his\r\nroof or hearth to the coming guest.\" The Salic law, however, rightly\r\nforbids the exercise of hospitality to atrocious criminals; laying a\r\npenalty on the person who shall harbor one who has dug up or despoiled\r\nthe dead? till he has made satisfaction to the relations.\r\n\r\n[129] The clause here put within brackets is probably misplaced;\r\nsince it does not connect well either with what goes before or what\r\nfollows.[130] The Russians are at present the most remarkable among the\r\nnorthern nations for the use of warm bathing. Some of the North American\r\ntribes also have their hypocausts, or stoves.\r\n\r\n[131] Eating at separate tables is generally an indication of voracity.\r\nTraces of it may be found in Homer, and other writers who have described\r\nancient manners. The same practice has also been observed among the\r\npeople of Otaheite; who occasionally devour vast quantities of food.\r\n\r\n[132] The following article in the Salic law shows at once the frequency\r\nof these bloody quarrels, and the laudable endeavors of the legislature\r\nto restrain them;--\"If at a feast where there are four or five men in\r\ncompany, one of them be killed, the rest shall either convict one as the\r\noffender, or shall jointly pay the composition for his death. And this\r\nlaw shall extend to seven persons present at an entertainment.\"\r\n\r\n[133] The same custom is related by Herodotus, i. p. 66, as prevailing\r\namong the Persians.\r\n\r\n[134] Of this liquor, beer or ale, Pliny speaks in the following\r\npassage: \"The western nations have their intoxicating liquor, made of\r\nsteeped grain. The Egyptians also invented drinks of the same kind. Thus\r\ndrunkenness is a stranger in no part of the world; for these liquors are\r\ntaken pure, and not diluted as wine is. Yet, surely, the Earth thought\r\nshe was producing corn. Oh, the wonderful sagacity of our vices! we have\r\ndiscovered how to render even water intoxicating.\"--xiv. 22.\r\n\r\n[135] Mela says, \"Their manner of living is so rude and savage, that\r\nthey eat even raw flesh; either fresh killed, or softened by working\r\nwith their hands and feet, after it has grown stiff in the hides of\r\ntame or wild animals.\" (iii. 3.) Florus relates that the ferocity of\r\nthe Cimbri was mitigated by their feeding on bread and dressed meat, and\r\ndrinking wine, in the softest tract of Italy.--iii. 3.\r\n\r\n[136] This must not be understood to have been cheese; although Caesar\r\nsays of the Germans, \"Their diet chiefly consists of milk, cheese and\r\nflesh.\" (Bell. Gall. vi. 22.) Pliny, who was thoroughly acquainted with\r\nthe German manners, says more accurately, \"It is surprising that the\r\nbarbarous nations who live on milk should for so many ages have been\r\nignorant of, or have rejected, the preparation of cheese; especially\r\nsince they thicken their milk into a pleasant tart substance, and a fat\r\nbutter: this is the scum of milk, of a thicker consistence than what is\r\ncalled the whey. It must not be omitted that it has the properties of\r\noil, and is used as an unguent by all the barbarians, and by us for\r\nchildren.\"--xi. 41.\r\n\r\n[137] This policy has been practised by the Europeans with regard to the\r\nNorth American savages, some tribes of which have been almost totally\r\nextirpated by it.\r\n\r\n[138] St. Ambrose has a remarkable passage concerning this spirit\r\nof gaming among a barbarous people:--\"It is said that the Huns, who\r\ncontinually make war upon other nations, are themselves subject to\r\nusurers, with whom they run in debt at play; and that, while they live\r\nwithout laws, they obey the laws of the dice alone; playing when drawn\r\nup in line of battle; carrying dice along with their arms, and perishing\r\nmore by each others' hands than by the enemy. In the midst of victory\r\nthey submit to become captives, and suffer plunder from their own\r\ncountrymen, which they know not how to bear from the foe. On this\r\naccount they never lay aside the business of war, because, when they\r\nhave lost all their booty by the dice, they have no means of acquiring\r\nfresh supplies for play, but by the sword. They are frequently borne\r\naway with such a desperate ardor, that, when the loser has given up his\r\narms, the only part of his property which he greatly values, he sets the\r\npower over his life at a single cast to the winner or usurer. It is a\r\nfact, that a person, known to the Roman emperor, paid the price of a\r\nservitude which he had by this means brought upon himself, by suffering\r\ndeath at the command of his master.\"\r\n\r\n[139] The condition of these slaves was the same as that of the vassals,\r\nor serfs, who a few centuries ago made the great body of the people\r\nin every country in Europe. The Germans, in after times, imitating the\r\nRomans, had slaves of inferior condition, to whom the name of slave\r\nbecame appropriated; while those in the state of rural vassalage were\r\ncalled _lidi_.\r\n\r\n[140] A private enemy could not be slain with impunity, since a fine\r\nwas affixed to homicide; but a man might kill his own slave without\r\nany punishment. If, however, he killed another person's slave, he was\r\nobliged to pay his price to the owner.\r\n\r\n[141] The amazing height of power and insolence to which freedmen\r\narrived by making themselves subservient to the vices of the prince,\r\nis a striking characteristic of the reigns of some of the worst of the\r\nRoman emperors.\r\n\r\n[142] In Rome, on the other hand, the practice of usury was, as our\r\nauthor terms it, \"an ancient evil, and a perpetual source of sedition\r\nand discord.\"--Annals, vi. 16.\r\n\r\n[143] All the copies read _per vices_, \"by turns,\" or alternately; but\r\nthe connection seems evidently to require the easy alteration of _per\r\nvicos_, which has been approved by many learned commentators, and is\r\ntherefore adopted in this translation.\r\n\r\n[144] Caesar has several particulars concerning this part of German\r\npolity. \"They are not studious of agriculture, the greater part of\r\ntheir diet consisting of milk, cheese, and flesh; nor has any one\r\na determinate portion of land, his own peculiar property; but the\r\nmagistrates and chiefs allot every year to tribes and clanships forming\r\ncommunities, as much land, and in such situations, as they think proper,\r\nand oblige them to remove the succeeding year. For this practice they\r\nassign several reasons: as, lest they should be led, by being\r\naccustomed to one spot, to exchange the toils of war for the business of\r\nagriculture; lest they should acquire a passion for possessing extensive\r\ndomains, and the more powerful should be tempted to dispossess the\r\nweaker; lest they should construct buildings with more art than was\r\nnecessary to protect them from the inclemencies of the weather; lest\r\nthe love of money should arise amongst them, the source of faction\r\nand dissensions; and in order that the people, beholding their own\r\npossessions equal to those of the most powerful, might be retained by\r\nthe bonds of equity and moderation.\"--Bell. Gall. vi. 21.\r\n\r\n[145] The Germans, not planting fruit-trees, were ignorant of the proper\r\nproducts of autumn. They have now all the autumnal fruits of their\r\nclimate; yet their language still retains a memorial of their ancient\r\ndeficiencies, in having no term for this season of the year, but one\r\ndenoting the gathering in of corn alone--_Herbst_, Harvest.\r\n\r\n[146] In this respect, as well as many others, the manners of the\r\nGermans were a direct contrast to those of the Romans. Pliny mentions a\r\nprivate person, C. Caecilius Claudius Isidorus, who ordered the sum of\r\nabout 10,000_l._ sterling to be expended in his funeral: and in another\r\nplace he says, \"Intelligent persons asserted that Arabia did not produce\r\nsuch a quantity of spices in a year as Nero burned at the obsequies of\r\nhis Poppaea.\"--xxxiii. 10, and xii. 18.\r\n\r\n[147] The following lines of Lucan, describing the last honors paid by\r\nCornelia to the body of Pompey the Great, happily illustrate the customs\r\nhere referred to:--\r\n\r\n  Collegit vestes, miserique insignia Magni.\r\n  Armaque, et impressas auro, quas gesserat olim\r\n  Exuvias, pictasque togas, velamina summo\r\n  Ter conspecta Jovi, funestoque intulit igni.--Lib. ix. 175.\r\n\r\n  \"There shone his arms, with antique gold inlaid,\r\n  There the rich robes which she herself had made,\r\n  Robes to imperial Jove in triumph thrice display'd:\r\n  The relics of his past victorious days,\r\n  Now this his latest trophy serve to raise,\r\n  And in one common flame together blaze.\"--ROWE.\r\n\r\n[148] Thus in the tomb of Childeric, king of the Franks, were found\r\nhis spear and sword, and also his horse's head, with a shoe, and gold\r\nbuckles and housings. A human skull was likewise discovered, which,\r\nperhaps, was that of his groom.\r\n\r\n[149] Caesar's account is as follows:--\"There was formerly a time when\r\nthe Gauls surpassed the Germans in bravery, and made war upon them;\r\nand, on account of their multitude of people and scarcity of land, sent\r\ncolonies beyond the Rhine. The most fertile parts of Germany, adjoining\r\nto the Hercynian forest, (which, I observe, was known by report to\r\nEratosthenes and others of the Greeks, and called by them Orcinia,) were\r\naccordingly occupied by the Volcae and Tectosages, who settled there.\r\nThese people still continue in the same settlements, and have a high\r\ncharacter as well for the administration of justice as military prowess:\r\nand they now remain in the same state of penury and content as the\r\nGermans, whose manner of life they have adopted.\"--Bell. Gall. vi. 24.\r\n\r\n[150] The inhabitants of Switzerland, then extending further than at\r\npresent, towards Lyons.\r\n\r\n[151] A nation of Gauls, bordering on the Helvetii, as appears from\r\nStrabo and Caesar. After being conquered by Caesar, the Aedui gave them\r\na settlement in the country now called the Bourbonnois. The name of\r\ntheir German colony, Boiemum, is still extant in Bohemia. The aera at\r\nwhich the Helvetii and Boii penetrated into Germany is not ascertained.\r\nIt seems probable, however, that it was in the reign of Tarquinius\r\nPriscus; for at that time, as we are told by Livy, Ambigatus, king of\r\nthe Bituriges (people of Berry), sent his sister's son Sigovesus into\r\nthe Hercynian forest, with a colony, in order to exonerate his kingdom\r\nwhich was overpeopled. (Livy, v. 33; _et seq._)\r\n\r\n[152] In the time of Augustus, the Boii, driven from Boiemum by the\r\nMarcomanni, retired to Noricum, which from them was called Boioaria, now\r\nBavaria.\r\n\r\n[153] This people inhabited that part of Lower Hungary now called the\r\nPalatinate of Pilis.\r\n\r\n[154] Towards the end of this treatise, Tacitus seems himself to decide\r\nthis point, observing that their use of the Pannonian language, and\r\nacquiescence in paying tribute, prove the Osi not to be a German nation.\r\nThey were settled beyond the Marcomanni and Quadi, and occupied the\r\nnorthern part of Transdanubian Hungary; perhaps extending to Silesia,\r\nwhere is a place called Ossen in the duchy of Oels, famous for salt and\r\nglass works. The learned Pelloutier, however, contends that the Osi were\r\nGermans; but with less probability.\r\n\r\n[155] The inhabitants of the modern diocese of Treves.\r\n\r\n[156] Those of Cambresis and Hainault.\r\n\r\n[157] Those of the dioceses of Worms, Strasburg, and Spires.\r\n\r\n[158] Those of the diocese of Cologne. The Ubii, migrating from Germany\r\nto Gaul, on account of the enmity of the Catti, and their own attachment\r\nto the Roman interest, were received under the protection of Marcus\r\nAgrippa, in the year of Rome 717. (Strabo, iv. p. 194.) Agrippina, the\r\nwife of Claudius and mother of Nero, who was born among them, obtained\r\nthe settlement of a colony there, which was called after her name.\r\n\r\n[159] Now the Betuwe, part of the provinces of Holland and Guelderland.\r\n\r\n[160] Hence the Batavi are termed, in an ancient inscription, \"the\r\nbrothers and friends of the Roman people.\"\r\n\r\n[161] This nation inhabited part of the countries now called the\r\nWeteraw, Hesse, Isenburg and Fulda. In this territory was Mattium, now\r\nMarpurg, and the Fontes Mattiaci, now Wisbaden, near Mentz.\r\n\r\n[162] The several people of Germany had their respective borders, called\r\nmarks or marches, which they defended by preserving them in a desert and\r\nuncultivated state. Thus Caesar, Bell. Gall. iv 3:--\"They think it the\r\ngreatest honor to a nation, to have as wide an extent of vacant land\r\naround their dominions as possible; by which it is indicated, that a\r\ngreat number of neighboring communities are unable to withstand them.\r\nOn this account, the Suevi are said to have, on one side, a tract of\r\n600 (some learned men think we should read 60) miles desert for their\r\nboundaries.\" In another place Caesar mentions, as an additional reason\r\nfor this policy, that they think themselves thereby rendered secure from\r\nthe danger of sudden incursions. (Bell. Gall. vi. 13.)\r\n\r\n[163] The difference between the low situation and moist air of Batavia,\r\nand the high and dry country of the Mattiaci, will sufficiently justify\r\nthis remark, in the opinion of those who allow anything to the influence\r\nof climate.\r\n\r\n[164] Now Swabia. When the Marcommanni, towards the end of the reign\r\nof Augustus, quitting their settlements near the Rhine, migrated to\r\nBohemia, the lands they left vacant were occupied by some unsettled\r\nGauls among the Rauraci and Sequani. They seem to have been called\r\nDecumates (Decimated), because the inhabitants, liable to the incursions\r\nof the Germans, paid a tithe of their products to be received under\r\nthe protection of the Romans. Adrian defended them by a rampart, which\r\nextended from Neustadt, a town on the Danube near the mouth of the river\r\nAltmühl, to the Neckar near Wimpfen; a space of sixty French leagues.\r\n\r\n[165] Of Upper Germany.\r\n\r\n[166] The Catti possessed a large territory between the Rhine, Mayne and\r\nSala, and the Hartz forest on this side of the Weser; where are now\r\nthe countries of Hesse, Thuringia, part of Paderborn, of Fulda, and\r\nof Franconia. Learned writers have frequently noted, that what Caesar,\r\nFlorus and Ptolemy have said of the Suevi, is to be understood of the\r\nCatti. Leibnitz supposes the Catti were so called from the active\r\nanimal which they resemble in name, the German for cat being _Catte_, or\r\n_Hessen_.\r\n\r\n[167] Pliny, who was well acquainted with Germany, gives a very striking\r\ndescription of the Hercynian forest:--\"The vast trees of the Hercynian\r\nforest, untouched for ages, and as old as the world, by their almost\r\nimmortal destiny exceed common wonders. Not to mention circumstances\r\nwhich would not be credited, it is certain that hills are raised by the\r\nrepercussion of their meeting roots; and where the earth does not follow\r\nthem, arches are formed as high as the branches, which, struggling, as\r\nit were, with each other, are bent into the form of open gates, so wide,\r\nthat troops of horse may ride under them.\"--xvi. 2.\r\n\r\n[168] _Duriora corpora_. \"Hardier frames;\" _i.e._ than the rest of\r\nthe Germans. At Hist. ii 32. the Germans, in general, are said to have\r\n_fluxa corpora_; while in c. 4 of this treatise they are described as\r\n_tantùm ad impetum valida_.\r\n\r\n[169] Floras, ii. 18, well expresses this thought by the sentence \"Tanti\r\nexercitus, quanti imperator.\" \"An army is worth so much as its general\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\n[170] Thus Civilis is said by our author (Hist. iv. 61), to have let his\r\nhair and beard grow in consequence of a private vow. Thus too, in Paul\r\nWarnefrid's \"History of the Lombards,\" iii. 7, it is related, that \"six\r\nthousand Saxons who survived the war, vowed that they would never cut\r\ntheir hair, nor shave their beards, till they had been revenged of their\r\nenemies, the Suevi.\" A later instance of this custom is mentioned by\r\nStrada (Bell. Belg. vii. p. 344), of William Lume, one of the Counts\r\nof Mark, \"who bound himself by a vow not to cut his hair till he had\r\nrevenged the deaths of Egmont and Horn.\"\r\n\r\n[171] The iron ring seems to have been a badge of slavery. This custom\r\nwas revived in later times, but rather with a gallant than a military\r\nintention. Thus, in the year 1414, John duke of Bourbon, in order to\r\ningratiate himself with his mistress, vowed, together with sixteen\r\nknights and gentlemen, that they would wear, he and the knights a gold\r\nring, the gentlemen a silver one, round their left legs, every Sunday\r\nfor two years, till they had met with an equal number of knights and\r\ngentlemen to contend with them in a tournament. (Vertot, Mém. de l'Acad.\r\ndes Inscr. tom. ii. p. 596.)\r\n\r\n[172] It was this nation of Catti, which, about 150 years afterwards,\r\nuniting with the remains of the Cherusci on this side the Weser, the\r\nAttuarii, Sicambri, Chamavi, Bructeri, and Chauci, entered into the\r\nFrancic league, and, conquering the Romans, seized upon Gaul. From them\r\nare derived the name, manners, and laws of the French.\r\n\r\n[173] These two tribes, united by a community of wars and misfortunes,\r\nhad formerly been driven from the settlements on the Rhine a little\r\nbelow Mentz. They then, according to Caesar (Bell. Gall. iv. 1, _et\r\nseq._), occupied the territories of the Menapii on both sides the Rhine.\r\nStill proving unfortunate, they obtained the lands of the Sicambri,\r\nwho, in the reign of Augustus, were removed on this side the Rhine by\r\nTiberius: these were the present counties of Berg, Mark, Lippe, and\r\nWaldeck; and the bishopric of Paderborn.\r\n\r\n[174] Their settlements were between the rivers Rhine, Lippe (Luppia),\r\nand Ems (Amisia), and the province of Friesland; now the countries of\r\nWestphalia and Over-Issel. Alting (Notit. German. Infer, p. 20) supposes\r\nthey derived their name from _Broeken_, or _Bruchen_, marshes, on\r\naccount of their frequency in that tract of country.\r\n\r\n[175] Before this migration, the Chamavi were settled on the Ems,\r\nwhere at present are Lingen and Osnaburg; the Angrivarii, on the Weser\r\n(Visurgis), where are Minden and Schawenburg. A more ancient migration\r\nof the Chamavi to the banks of the Rhine is cursorily mentioned\r\nby Tacitus, Annal. xiii. 55. The Angrivarii were afterwards called\r\nAngrarii, and became part of the Saxon nation.\r\n\r\n[176] They were not so entirely extirpated that no relics of them\r\nremained. They were even a conspicuous part of the Francic league, as\r\nbefore related. Claudian also, in his panegyric on the fourth consulate\r\nof Honorius, v. 450, mentions them.\r\n\r\n            Venit accola sylvae\r\n  Bructerus Hercyniae.\r\n\r\n  \"The Bructerian, borderer on the Hercynian forest, came.\"\r\n\r\nAfter their expulsion, they settled, according to Eccard, between\r\nCologne and Hesse.\r\n\r\n[177] The Bructeri were under regal government, and maintained many wars\r\nagainst the Romans. Hence their arrogance and power. Before they were\r\ndestroyed by their countrymen, Vestricius Spurinna terrified them into\r\nsubmission without an action, and had on that account a triumphal statue\r\ndecreed him. Pliny the younger mentions this fact, book ii. epist. 7.\r\n\r\n[178] An allusion to gladiatorial spectacles. This slaughter happened\r\nnear the canal of Drusus, where the Roman guard on the Rhine could be\r\nspectators of the battle. The account of it came to Rome in the first\r\nyear of Trajan.\r\n\r\n[179] As this treatise was written in the reign of Trajan, when the\r\naffairs of the Romans appeared unusually prosperous, some critics have\r\nimagined that Tacitus wrote _vigentibus_, \"flourishing,\" instead of\r\n_urgentibus_, \"urgent.\" But it is sufficiently evident, from other\r\npassages, that the causes which were operating gradually, but surely, to\r\nthe destruction of the Roman empire, did not escape the penetration of\r\nTacitus, even when disguised by the most flattering appearances. The\r\ncommon reading is therefore, probably, right.--_Aikin_.\r\n\r\n[180] These people first resided near the head of the Lippe; and then\r\nremoved to the settlements of the Chamavi and Angrivarii, who had\r\nexpelled the Bructeri. They appear to have been the same with those whom\r\nVelleius Paterculus, ii. 105, calls the Attuarii, and by that name they\r\nentered into the Francic league. Strabo calls them Chattuarii.\r\n\r\n[181] Namely, the Ansibarii and Tubantes. The Ansibarii or Amsibarii are\r\nthought by Alting to have derived their name from their neighborhood to\r\nthe river Ems (Amisia); and the. Tubantes, from their frequent change of\r\nhabitation, to have been called _Tho Benten_. or the wandering troops,\r\nand to have dwelt where now is Drente in Over-Issel. Among these\r\nnations, Furstenburg (Monum. Paderborn.) enumerates the Ambrones,\r\nborderers upon the river Ambrus, now Emmeren.\r\n\r\n[182] The Frieslanders. The lesser Frisii were settled on this side, the\r\ngreater, on the other, of the Flevum (Zuyderzee).\r\n\r\n[183] In the time of the Romans this country was covered by vast meres,\r\nor lakes; which were made still larger by frequent inundations of the\r\nsea. Of these, one so late as 1530 overwhelmed seventy-two villages; and\r\nanother, still more terrible, in 1569, laid under water great part\r\nof the sea-coast of Holland, and almost all Friesland, in which alone\r\n20,000 persons were drowned.\r\n\r\n[184] Wherever the land seemed to terminate, and it appeared impossible\r\nto proceed further, maritime nations have feigned pillars of Hercules.\r\nThose celebrated by the Frisians must have been at the extremity of\r\nFriesland, and not in Sweden and the Cimmerian promontory, as Rudbeck\r\nsupposes.\r\n\r\n[185] Drusus, the brother of Tiberius, and father of Germanicus, imposed\r\na tribute on the Frisians, as mentioned in the Annals, iv. 72, and\r\nperformed other eminent services in Germany; himself styled Germanicus.\r\n\r\n[186] The Chauci extended along the seacoast from the Ems to the Elbe\r\n(Albis); whence they bordered on all the fore-mentioned nations, between\r\nwhich and the Cherusci they came round to the Catti. The Chauci were\r\ndistinguished into Greater and Lesser. The Greater, according to\r\nPtolemy, inhabited the country between the Weser and the Elbe; the\r\nLesser, that between the Weser and Ems; but Tacitus (Annals xi. 19)\r\nseems to reverse this order. Alting supposes the Chauci had their name\r\nfrom _Kauken_, signifying persons eminent for valor and fidelity, which\r\nagrees with the character Tacitus gives them. Others derive it from\r\n_Kauk_, an owl, with a reference to the enmity of that animal to cats\r\n(_Catti_). Others, from _Kaiten_, daws, of which there are great numbers\r\non their coast. Pliny has admirably described the country and manners of\r\nthe maritime Chauci, in his account of people who live without any trees\r\nor fruit-bearing vegetables:--\"In the North are the nations of Chauci,\r\nwho are divided into Greater and Lesser. Here, the ocean, having a\r\nprodigious flux and reflux twice in the space of every day and night,\r\nrolls over an immense tract, leaving it a matter of perpetual doubt\r\nwhether it is part of the land or sea. In this spot, the wretched\r\nnatives, occupying either the tops of hills, or artificial mounds\r\nof turf, raised out of reach of the highest tides, build their small\r\ncottages; which appear like sailing vessels when the water covers the\r\ncircumjacent ground, and like wrecks when it has retired. Here from\r\ntheir huts they pursue the fish, continually flying from them with the\r\nwaves. They do not, like their neighbors, possess cattle, and feed on\r\nmilk; nor have they a warfare to maintain against wild beasts, for every\r\nfruit of the earth is far removed from them. With flags and seaweed they\r\ntwist cordage for their fishing-nets. For fuel they use a kind of mud,\r\ntaken up by hand, and dried, rather in the wind than the sun: with this\r\nearth they heat their food, and warm their bodies, stiffened by the\r\nrigorous north. Their only drink is rain-water collected in ditches at\r\nthe thresholds of their doors. Yet this miserable people, if conquered\r\nto-day by the Roman arms, would call themselves slaves. Thus it is that\r\nfortune spares many to their own punishment.\"--Hist. Nat. xvi. 1.\r\n\r\n[187] On this account, fortified posts were established by the Romans\r\nto restrain the Chauci; who by Lucan are called Cayci in the following\r\npassage:\r\n\r\n  Et vos crinigeros bellis arcere Caycos\r\n  Oppositi.--Phars. i. 463.\r\n\r\n  \"You, too, tow'rds Rome advance, ye warlike band,\r\n  That wont the shaggy Cauci to withstand.\"--ROWE\r\n\r\n[188] The Cherusci, at that time, dwelt between the Weser and the Elbe,\r\nwhere now are Luneburg, Brunswick, and part of the Marche of Brandenburg\r\non this side the Elbe. In the reign of Augustus they occupied a more\r\nextensive tract; reaching even this side the Weser, as appears from\r\nthe accounts of the expedition of Drusus given by Dio and Velleius\r\nPaterculus: unless, as Dithmar observes, what is said of the Cherusci\r\non this side the Weser relates to the Dulgibini, their dependents. For,\r\naccording to Strabo, Varus was cut off by the Cherusci, and the people\r\nsubject to them. The brave actions of Arminius, the celebrated chief\r\nof the Cherusci, are related by Tacitus in the 1st and 2d books of his\r\nAnnals.\r\n\r\n[189] Cluver, and several others, suppose the Fosi to have been the same\r\nwith the ancient Saxons: but, since they bordered on the Cherusci, the\r\nopinion of Leibnitz is nearer the truth, that they inhabited the banks\r\nof the river Fusa, which enters the Aller (Allera) at Cellae; and were\r\na sort of appendage to the Cherusci, as Hildesheim now is to Brunswick.\r\nThe name of Saxons is later than Tacitus, and was not known till the\r\nreign of Antoninus Pius, at which period they poured forth from the\r\nCimbric Chersonesus, and afterwards, in conjunction with the Angles,\r\nseized upon Britain.\r\n\r\n[191] The name of this people still exists; and the country they\r\ninhabited is called the Cimbric Chersonesus, or Peninsula; comprehending\r\nJutland, Sleswig, and Holstein. The renown and various fortune of\r\nthe Cimbri is briefly, but accurately, related by Mallet in the\r\n\"Introduction\" to the \"History of Denmark.\"\r\n\r\n[192] Though at this time they were greatly reduced by migrations,\r\ninundations and wars, they afterwards revived; and from this storehouse\r\nof nations came forth the Franks, Saxons, Normans, and various other\r\ntribes, which brought all Europe under Germanic sway.\r\n\r\n[193] Their fame spread through Germany, Gaul, Spain, Britain, Italy,\r\nand as far as the Sea of Azoph (Palus Maeotis), whither, according\r\nto Posidonius, they penetrated, and called the Cimmerian or Cimbrian\r\nBosphorus after their own name.\r\n\r\n[194] This is usually, and probably rightly, explained as relating to\r\nboth shores of the Cimbric Chersonesus. Cluver and Dithmar, however,\r\nsuppose that these encampments are to be sought for either in Italy,\r\nupon the river Athesis (Adige), or in Narbonnensian Gaul near Aquae\r\nSextiae (Aix in Provence), where Florus (iii. 3) mentions that the\r\nTeutoni defeated by Marius took post in a valley with a river running\r\nthrough it. Of the prodigious numbers of the Cimbri who made this\r\nterrible irruption we have an account in Plutarch, who relates that\r\ntheir fighting men were 300,000, with a much greater number of women and\r\nchildren. (Plut. Marius, p. 411.)\r\n\r\n[195] Nerva was consul the fourth time, and Trajan the second, in the\r\n85lst year of Rome; in which Tacitus composed this treatise.\r\n\r\n[196] After the defeat of P. Decidius Saxa, lieutenant of Syria, by the\r\nParthians, and the seizure of Syria by Pacorus, son of king Orodes, P.\r\nVentidius Bassus was sent there, and vanquished the Parthians, killed\r\nPacorus, and entirely restored the Roman affairs.\r\n\r\n[197] The Epitome of Livy informs us, that \"in the year of Rome 640, the\r\nCimbri, a wandering tribe, made a predatory incursion into Illyricum,\r\nwhere they routed the consul Papirius Carbo with his army.\" According\r\nto Strabo, it was at Noreia, a town of the Taurisci, near Aquileia, that\r\nCarbo was defeated. In the succeeding years, the Cimbri and Teutonia\r\nravaged Gaul, and brought great calamities on that country; but at\r\nlength, deterred by the unshaken bravery of the Gauls, they turned\r\nanother way; as appears from Caesar, Bell. Gal. vii. 17. They then\r\ncame into Italy, and sent ambassadors to the Senate, demanding lands to\r\nsettle on. This was refused; and the consul M. Junius Silanus fought\r\nan unsuccessful battle with them, in the year of Rome 645. (Epitome of\r\nLivy, lxv.)\r\n\r\n[198] \"L. Cassius the consul, in the year of Rome 647, was cut off with\r\nhis army in the confines of the Allobroges, by the Tigurine Gauls,\r\na canton of the Helvetians (now the cantons of Zurich, Appenzell,\r\nSchaffhausen, &c.), who had migrated from their settlements. The\r\nsoldiers who survived the slaughter gave hostages for the payment of\r\nhalf they were worth, to be dismissed with safety.\" (Ibid.) Caesar\r\nfurther relates that the Roman army was passed under the yoke by the\r\nTigurini:--\"This single canton, migrating from home, within the memory\r\nof our fathers, slew the consul L. Cassius, and passed his army under\r\nthe yoke.\"--Bell. Gall. i. 12.\r\n\r\n[199] M. Aurelius Scaurus, the consul's lieutenant (or rather consul,\r\nas he appears to have served that office in the year of Rome 646), was\r\ndefeated and taken by the Cimbri; and when, being asked his advice,\r\nhe dissuaded them from passing the Alps into Italy, assuring them the\r\nRomans were invincible, he was slain by a furious youth, named Boiorix.\r\n(Epit. Livy, lxvii.)\r\n\r\n[200] Florus, in like manner, considers these two affairs\r\nseparately:--\"Neither could Silanus sustain the first onset of the\r\nbarbarians; nor Manlius, the second; nor Caepio, the third.\" (iii. 3.)\r\nLivy joins them together:--\"By the same enemy (the Cimbri) Cn. Manlius\r\nthe consul, and Q. Servilius Caepio the proconsul, were defeated in an\r\nengagement, and both dispossessed of their camps.\" (Epit. lxvii.) Paulus\r\nOrosius relates the affair more particularly:--\"Manlius the consul, and\r\nQ. Caepio, proconsul, being sent against the Cimbri, Teutones,\r\nTigurini, and Ambronae, Gaulish and German nations, who had conspired to\r\nextinguish the Roman empire, divided their respective provinces by the\r\nriver Rhone. Here, the most violent dissensions prevailing between them,\r\nthey were both overcome, to the great disgrace and danger of the Roman\r\nname. According to Antias, 80,000 Romans and allies were slaughtered.\r\nCaepio, by whose rashness this misfortune was occasioned, was condemned,\r\nand his property confiscated by order of the Roman people.\" (Lib. v.\r\n16.) This happened in the year of Rome 649; and the anniversary was\r\nreckoned among the unlucky days.\r\n\r\n[201] The Republic; in opposition to Rome when governed by emperors.\r\n\r\n[202] This tragical catastrophe so deeply affected Augustus, that, as\r\nSeutonius informs us, \"he was said to have let his beard and hair grow\r\nfor several months; during which he at times struck his head against the\r\ndoors, crying out, 'Varus, restore my legions!' and ever after kept\r\nthe anniversary as a day of mourning.\" (Aug. s. 23.) The finest history\r\npiece, perhaps, ever drawn by a writer, is Tacitus's description of the\r\narmy of Germanicus visiting the field of battle, six years after,\r\nand performing funeral obsequies to the scattered remains of their\r\nslaughtered countrymen. (Annals, i. 61.)\r\n\r\n[203] \"After so many misfortunes, the Roman people thought no general\r\nso capable of repelling such formidable enemies, as Marius.\" Nor was the\r\npublic opinion falsified. In his fourth consulate, in the year of Rome\r\n652. \"Marius engaged the Teutoni beyond the Alps near Aquae Sextiae (Aix\r\nin Province), killing, on the day of battle and the following day, above\r\n150,000 of the enemy, and entirely cutting off the Teutonic nation.\"\r\n(Velleus Paterculus, ii. 12.) Livy says there were 200,000 slain, and\r\n90,000 taken prisoners. The succeeding year he defeated the Cimbri, who\r\nhad penetrated into Italy and crossed the Adige, in the Raudian plain,\r\nwhere now is Rubio, killing and taking prisoners upwards of 100,000 men.\r\nThat he did not, however, obtain an unbought victory over this warlike\r\npeople, may be conjectured from the resistance he met with even from\r\ntheir women. We are told by Florus (iii. 3) that \"he was obliged to\r\nsustain an engagement with their wives, as well as themselves; who,\r\nentrenching themselves on all sides with wagons and cars, fought from\r\nthem, as from towers, with lances and poles. Their death was no less\r\nglorious than their resistance. For, when they could not obtain from\r\nMarius what they requested by an embassy, their liberty, and admission\r\ninto the vestal priesthood (which, indeed, could not lawfully be\r\ngranted); after strangling their infants, they either fell by mutual\r\nwounds, or hung themselves on trees or the poles of their carriages in\r\nropes made of their own hair. King Boiorix was slain, not unrevenged,\r\nfighting bravely in the field.\" On account of these great victories,\r\nMarius, in the year of Borne 652, triumphed over the Teutoni, Ambroni,\r\nand Cimbri.\r\n\r\n[204] In the 596th year of Rome, Julius Caesar defeated Ariovistus, a\r\nGerman king, near Dampierre in the Franche-Comte, and pursued his routed\r\ntroops with great slaughter thirty miles towards the Rhine, filling all\r\nthat space with spoils and dead bodies. (Bell. Gall. i. 33 and 52.)\r\nHe had before chastised the Tigurini, who, as already mentioned, had\r\ndefeated and killed L. Cassius. Drusus: This was the son of Livia, and\r\nbrother of the emperor Tiberius. He was in Germany B.C. 12, 11. His loss\r\nwas principally from shipwreck on the coast of the Chauci. See Lynam's\r\nRoman Emperors, i. 37, 45, Nero; _i.e._ Tiberius, afterwards emperor.\r\nHis name was Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero. See Lynam's Roman Emperors,\r\ni. 51, 53, 62, 78. Germanicus: He was the son of Drusus, and so nephew\r\nof Tiberius. His victories in Germany took place A.D. 14-16. He too,\r\nlike his father, was shipwrecked, and nearly at the same spot. See\r\nLynam's Roman Emperors, i. 103-118.\r\n\r\n[205] In the war of Civilis, related by Tacitus, Hist. iv. and v.\r\n\r\n[206] By Domitian, as is more particularly mentioned in the Life of\r\nAgricola.\r\n\r\n[207] The Suevi possessed that extensive tract of country lying between\r\nthe Elbe, the Vistula, the Baltic Sea, and the Danube. They formerly had\r\nspread still further, reaching even to the Rhine. Hence Strabo, Caesar,\r\nFlorus, and others, have referred to the Suevi what related to the\r\nCatti.\r\n\r\n[208] Among the Suevi, and also the rest of the Germans, the slaves,\r\nseem to have been shaven; or at least cropped so short that they could\r\nnot twist or tie up their hair in a knot.\r\n\r\n[209] The Semnones inhabited both banks of the Viadrus (Oder); the\r\ncountry which is now part of Pomerania, of the Marche of Brandenburg,\r\nand of Lusatia.\r\n\r\n[210] In the reign of Augustus, the Langobardi dwelt on this side the\r\nElbe, between Luneburg and Magdeburg. When conquered and driven beyond\r\nthe Elbe by Tiberius, they occupied that part of the country where are\r\nnow Prignitz, Ruppin, and part of the Middle Marche. They afterwards\r\nfounded the Lombard kingdom in Italy; which, in the year of Christ\r\n774, was destroyed by Charlemagne, who took their king Desiderius, and\r\nsubdued all Italy. The laws of the Langobardi are still extant, and may\r\nbe met with in Lindenbrog. The Burgundians are not mentioned by Tacitus,\r\nprobably because they were then an inconsiderable people. Afterwards,\r\njoining with the Langobardi, they settled on the Decuman lands and the\r\nRoman boundary. They from thence made an irruption into Gaul, and seized\r\nthat country which is still named from them Burgundy. Their laws are\r\nlikewise extant.\r\n\r\n[211] From Tacitus's description, the Reudigni must have dwelt in part\r\nof the present duchy of Mecklenburg, and of Lauenburg. They had formerly\r\nbeen settled on this side the Elbe, on the sands of Luneburg.\r\n\r\n[212] Perhaps the same people with those called by Mamertinus, in\r\nhis Panegyric on Maximian, the Chaibones. From their vicinity to the\r\nfore-mentioned nations, they must have inhabited part of the duchy of\r\nMecklenburg. They had formerly dwelt on this side the Elbe, on the banks\r\nof the river Ilmenavia in Luneburg; which is now called Ava; whence,\r\nprobably, the name of the people.\r\n\r\n[213] Inhabitants of what is now part of Holstein and Sleswig; in which\r\ntract is still a district called Angeln, between Flensborg and Sleswig.\r\nIn the fifth century, the Angles, in conjunction with the Saxons,\r\nmigrated into Britain, and perpetuated their name by giving appellation\r\nto England.\r\n\r\n[214] From the enumeration of Tacitus, and the situation of the other\r\ntribes, it appears that the Eudoses must have occupied the modern Wismar\r\nand Rostock; the Suardones, Stralsund, Swedish Pomerania, and part\r\nof the Hither Pomerania, and of the Uckerane Marche. Eccard, however,\r\nsupposes these nations were much more widely extended; and that\r\nthe Eudoses dwelt upon the Oder; the Suardones, upon the Warte; the\r\nNuithones, upon the Netze.\r\n\r\n[215] The ancient name of the goddess Herth still subsists in the German\r\n_Erde_, and in the English _Earth_.\r\n\r\n[216] Many suppose this island to have been the isle of Rugen in the\r\nBaltic sea. It is more probable, however, that it was an island near\r\nthe mouth of the Elbe, now called the isle of Helgeland, or Heiligeland\r\n(Holy Island). Besides the proof arising from the name, the situation\r\nagrees better with that of the nations before enumerated.\r\n\r\n[217] Olaus Rudbeck contends that this festival was celebrated in\r\nwinter, and still continues in Scandinavia under the appellation of\r\nJulifred, the peace of Juul. (Yule is the term used for Christmas season\r\nin the old English and Scottish dialects.) But this feast was solemnized\r\nnot in honor of the Earth, but of the Sun, called by them Thor or\r\nTaranium. The festival of Herth was held later, in the month of\r\nFebruary; as may be seen in Mallet's \"Introduction to the History of\r\nDenmark.\"\r\n\r\n[218] _Templo_ here means merely \"the consecrated place,\" _i.e._ the\r\ngrove before mentioned, for according to c.9 the Germans built no\r\ntemples.\r\n\r\n[219] It is supposed that this people, on account of their valor, were\r\ncalled Heermanner; corrupted by the Romans into Hermunduri. They were\r\nfirst settled between the Elbe, the Sala, and Bohemia; where now\r\nare Anhalt, Voightland, Saxony, part of Misnia, and of Franconia.\r\nAfterwards, when the Marcomanni took possession of Bohemia, from which\r\nthe Boii had been expelled by Maroboduus, the Hermunduri added their\r\nsettlements to their own, and planted in them the Suevian name, whence\r\nis derived the modern appellation of that country, Suabia.\r\n\r\n[220] They were so at that time; but afterwards joined with the\r\nMarcomanni and other Germans against the Romans in the time of Marcus\r\nAurelius, who overcame them.\r\n\r\n[221] Augusta Vindelicorum, now Augsburg; a famous Roman colony in the\r\nprovince of Rhaetia, of which Vindelica was then a part.\r\n\r\n[222] Tacitus is greatly mistaken if he confounds the source of the\r\nEgra, which is in the country of the Hermuduri, with that of the Elbe,\r\nwhich rises in Bohemia. The Elbe had been formerly, as Tacitus observes,\r\nwell known to the Romans by the victories of Drusus, Tiberius, and\r\nDomitius; but afterwards, when the increasing power of the Germans kept\r\nthe Roman arms at a distance, it was only indistinctly heard of. Hence\r\nits source was probably inaccurately laid down in the Roman geographical\r\ntables. Perhaps, however, the Hermunduri, when they had served in the\r\narmy of Maroboduus, received lands in that part of Bohemia in which\r\nthe Elbe rises; in which case there would be no mistake in Tacitus's\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n[223] Inhabitants of that part of Bavaria which lies between Bohemia and\r\nthe Danube.\r\n\r\n[224] Inhabitants of Bohemia.\r\n\r\n[225] Inhabitants of Moravia, and the part of Austria between it and\r\nthe Danube. Of this people, Ammianus Marcellinus, in his account of the\r\nreign of Valentinian and Valens, thus speaks:--\"A sudden commotion arose\r\namong the Quadi; a nation at present of little consequence, but\r\nwhich was formerly extremely warlike and potent, as their exploits\r\nsufficiently evince.\"--xxix. 15.\r\n\r\n[226] Their expulsion of the Boii, who had given name to Bohemia, has\r\nbeen already mentioned. Before this period, the Marcomanni dwelt near\r\nthe sources of the Danube, where now is the duchy of Wirtemburg; and, as\r\nDithmar supposes, on account of their inhabiting the borders of Germany,\r\nwere called Marcmanner, from _Marc_ (the same with the old English\r\n_March_) a border, or boundary.\r\n\r\n[227] These people justified their military reputation by the dangerous\r\nwar which, in conjunction with the Marcomanni, they excited against the\r\nRomans, in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.\r\n\r\n[228] Of this prince, and his alliance with the Romans against Arminius,\r\nmention is made by Tacitus, Annals, ii.\r\n\r\n[229] Thus Vannius was made king of the Quadi by Tiberius. (See Annals,\r\nii. 63.) At a later period, Antoninus Pius (as appears from a medal\r\npreserved in Spanheim) gave them Furtius for their king. And when they\r\nhad expelled him, and set Ariogaesus on the throne, Marcus Aurelius, to\r\nwhom he was obnoxious, refused to confirm the election. (Dio, lxxi.)\r\n\r\n[230] These people inhabited what is now Galatz, Jagerndorf, and part of\r\nSilesia.\r\n\r\n[231] Inhabitants of part of Silesia, and of Hungary.\r\n\r\n[232] Inhabitants of part of Hungary to the Danube.\r\n\r\n[233] These were settled about the Carpathian mountains, and the sources\r\nof the Vistula.\r\n\r\n[234] It is probable that the Suevi were distinguished from the rest\r\nof the Germans by a peculiar dialect, as well as by their dress and\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\n[235] Ptolemy mentions iron mines in or near the country of the Quadi.\r\nI should imagine that the expression \"additional disgrace\" (or, more\r\nliterally, \"which might make them more ashamed\") does not refer merely\r\nto the slavery of working in mines, but to the circumstance of their\r\ndigging up iron, the substance by means of which they might acquire\r\nfreedom and independence. This is quite in the manner of Tacitus. The\r\nword _iron_ was figuratively used by the ancients to signify military\r\nforce in general. Thus Solon, in his well-known answer to Croesus,\r\nobserved to him, that the nation which possessed more iron would be\r\nmaster of all his gold.--_Aikin_.\r\n\r\n[236] The mountains between Moravia, Hungary, Silesia, and Bohemia.\r\n\r\n[237] The Lygii inhabited what is now part of Silesia, of the New\r\nMarche, of Prussia and Poland on this side the Vistula.\r\n\r\n[238] These tribes were settled between the Oder and Vistula, where\r\nnow are part of Silesia, of Brandenburg, and of Poland. The Elysii are\r\nsupposed to have given name to Silesia.\r\n\r\n[239] The Greeks and Romans, under the name of the Dioscuri, or Castor\r\nand Pollux, worshipped those meteorous exhalations which, during a\r\nstorm, appear on the masts of ships, and are supposed to denote an\r\napproaching calm. A kind of religious veneration is still paid to this\r\nphenomenon by the Roman Catholics, under the appellation of the fire\r\nof St. Elmo. The Naharvali seem to have affixed the same character of\r\ndivinity on the _ignis fatuus_; and the name Alcis is probably the same\r\nwith that of Alff or Alp, which the northern nations still apply to the\r\nfancied Genii of the mountains. The Sarmatian deities Lebus and Polebus,\r\nthe memory of whom still subsists in the Polish festivals, had, perhaps,\r\nthe same origin.\r\n\r\n[240] No custom has been more universal among uncivilized people than\r\npainting the body, either for the purpose of ornament, or that of\r\ninspiring terror.\r\n\r\n[241] Inhabitants of what is now Further Pomerania, the New Marche and\r\nthe Western part of Poland, between the Oder and Vistula. They were a\r\ndifferent people from the Goths, though, perhaps, in alliance with them.\r\n\r\n[242] These people were settled on the shore of the Baltic, where\r\nnow are Colburg, Cassubia, and Further Pomerania. Their name is still\r\npreserved in the town of Rugenwald and Isle of Rugen.\r\n\r\n[243] These were also settlers on the Baltic, about the modern Stolpe,\r\nDantzig, and Lauenburg. The Heruli appear afterwards to have occupied\r\nthe settlements of the Lemovii. Of these last no further mention occurs;\r\nbut the Heruli made themselves famous throughout Europe and Asia, and\r\nwere the first of the Germans who founded a kingdom in Italy under\r\nOdoacer.\r\n\r\n[244] The Suiones inhabited Sweden, and the Danish isles of Funen,\r\nLanglaud, Zeeland, Laland, &c. From them and the Cimbri were derived\r\nthe Normans, who, after spreading terror through various parts of the\r\nempire, at last seized upon the fertile province of Normandy in France.\r\nThe names of Goths, Visigoths, and Ostrogoths, became still more famous,\r\nthey being the nations who accomplished the ruin of the Roman empire.\r\nThe laws of the Visigoths are still extant; but they depart much from\r\nthe usual simplicity of the German laws.\r\n\r\n[245] The Romans, who had but an imperfect knowledge of this part of\r\nthe world, imagined here those \"vast insular tracts\" mentioned in the\r\nbeginning of this treatise. Hence Pliny, also, says of the Baltic sea\r\n(Codanus sinus), that \"it is filled with islands, the most famous\r\nof which, Scandinavia (now Sweden and Norway), is of an undiscovered\r\nmagnitude; that part of it only being known which is occupied by the\r\nHilleviones, a nation inhabiting five hundred cantons; who call this\r\ncountry another globe.\" (Lib. iv. 13.) The memory of the Hilleviones is\r\nstill preserved in the part of Sweden named Halland.\r\n\r\n[246] Their naval power continued so great, that they had the glory\r\nof framing the nautical code, the laws of which were first written at\r\nWisby, the capital of the isle of Gothland, in the eleventh century.\r\n\r\n[247] This is exactly the form of the Indian canoes, which, however, are\r\ngenerally worked with sails as well as oars.\r\n\r\n[248] The great opulence of a temple of the Suiones, as described by\r\nAdam of Bremen (Eccl. Hist. ch. 233), is a proof of the wealth that\r\nat all times has attended naval dominion. \"This nation,\" says he,\r\n\"possesses a temple of great renown, called Ubsola (now Upsal), not far\r\nfrom the cities Sictona and Birca (now Sigtuna and Bioerkoe). In this\r\ntemple, which is entirely ornamented with gold, the people worship the\r\nstatues of three gods; the most powerful of whom, Thor, is seated on a\r\ncouch in the middle; with Woden on one side, and Fricca on the other.\"\r\nFrom the ruins of the towns Sictona and Birca arose the present capital\r\nof Sweden, Stockholm.\r\n\r\n[249] Hence Spener (Notit. German. Antiq.) rightly concludes that the\r\ncrown was hereditary, and not elective, among the Suiones.\r\n\r\n[250] It is uncertain whether what is now called the Frozen Ocean is\r\nhere meant, or the northern extremities of the Baltic Sea, the Gulfs\r\nof Bothnia and Finland, which are so frozen every winter as to be\r\nunnavigable.\r\n\r\n[251] The true principles of astronomy have now taught us the reason\r\nwhy, at a certain latitude, the sun, at the summer solstice, appears\r\nnever to set: and at a lower latitude, the evening twilight continues\r\ntill morning.\r\n\r\n[252] The true reading here is, probably, \"immerging;\" since it was a\r\ncommon notion at that period, that the descent of the sun into the ocean\r\nwas attended with a kind of hissing noise, like red hot iron dipped into\r\nwater. Thus Juvenal, Sat. xiv, 280:--\r\n\r\n  Audiet Herculeo stridentem gurgite solem.\r\n  \"Hear the sun hiss in the Herculean gulf.\"\r\n\r\n[253] Instead of formas deorum, \"forms of deities,\" some, with more\r\nprobability, read equorum, \"of the horses,\" which are feigned to draw\r\nthe chariot of the sun.\r\n\r\n[254] Thus Quintus Curtius, speaking of the Indian Ocean, says, \"Nature\r\nitself can proceed no further.\"\r\n\r\n[255] The Baltic Sea.\r\n\r\n[256] Now, the kingdom of Prussia, the duchies of Samogitia and\r\nCourland, the palatinates of Livonia and Esthonia, in the name of which\r\nlast the ancient appellation of these people is preserved.\r\n\r\n[257] Because the inhabitants of this extreme part of Germany retained\r\nthe Scythico-Celtic language, which long prevailed in Britain.\r\n\r\n[258] A deity of Scythian origin, called Frea or Fricca. See Mallet's\r\nIntroduct. to Hist. of Denmark.\r\n\r\n[259] Many vestiges of this superstition remain to this day in Sweden.\r\nThe peasants, in the month of February, the season formerly sacred to\r\nFrea, make little images of boars in paste, which they apply to various\r\nsuperstitious uses. (See Eccard.) A figure of a Mater Deum, with the\r\nboar, is given by Mr. Pennant, in his Tour in Scotland, 1769, p.\r\n268, engraven from a stone found at the great station at Netherby in\r\nCumberland.\r\n\r\n[260] The cause of this was, probably, their confined situation, which\r\ndid not permit them to wander in hunting and plundering parties, like\r\nthe rest of the Germans.\r\n\r\n[261] This name was transferred to _glass_ when it came into use. Pliny\r\nspeaks of the production of amber in this country as follows:--\"It is\r\ncertain that amber is produced in the islands of the Northern Ocean, and\r\nis called by the Germans _gless_. One of these islands, by the natives\r\nnamed Austravia, was on this account called Glessaria by our sailors in\r\nthe fleet of Germanicus.\"--Lib. xxxvii. 3.\r\n\r\n[262] Much of the Prussian amber is even at present collected on the\r\nshores of the Baltic. Much also is found washed out of the clayey cliffs\r\nof Holderness. See Tour in Scotland, 1769, p. 16.\r\n\r\n[263] Insomuch that the Guttones, who formerly inhabited this coast,\r\nmade use of amber as fuel, and sold it for that purpose to the\r\nneighboring Teutones. (Plin. xxxvii. 2.)\r\n\r\n[264] Various toys and utensils of amber, such as bracelets, necklaces,\r\nrings, cups, and even pillars, were to be met with among the luxurious\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\n[265] In a work by Goeppert and Berendt, on \"Amber and the Fossil\r\nRemains of Plants contained in it,\" published at Berlin, 1845, a passage\r\nis found (of which a translation is here given) which quite harmonizes\r\nwith the account of Tacitus:--\"About the parts which are known by the\r\nname of Samland an island emerged, or rather a group of islands, ...\r\nwhich gradually increased in circumference, and, favored by a mild sea\r\nclimate, was overspread with vegetation and forest. This forest was the\r\nmeans of amber being produced. Certain trees in it exuded gums in such\r\nquantities that the sunken forest soil now appears to be filled with\r\nit to such a degree, as if it had only been deprived of a very trifling\r\npart of its contents by the later eruptions of the sea, and the\r\ncountless storms which have lashed the ocean for centuries.\" Hence,\r\nthough found underground, it appears to have been originally the\r\nproduction of some resinous tree. Hence, too, the reason of the\r\nappearance of insects, &c. in it, as mentioned by Tacitus.\r\n\r\n[266] Norwegians.\r\n\r\n[267] All beyond the Vistula was reckoned Sarmatia. These people,\r\ntherefore, were properly inhabitants of Sarmatia, though from their\r\nmanners they appeared of German origin.\r\n\r\n[268] Pliny also reckons the Peucini among the German nations:--\"The\r\nfifth part of Germany is possessed by the Peucini and Bastarnae, who\r\nborder on the Dacians.\" (iv. 14.) From Strabo it appears that the\r\nPeucini, part of the Bastarnae, inhabited the country about the mouths\r\nof the Danube, and particularly the island Peuce, now Piczina, formed by\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\n[269] The habitations of the Peucini were fixed; whereas the Sarmatians\r\nwandered about in their wagons.\r\n\r\n[270] \"Sordes omnium ac torpor; procerum connubiis mixtis nonnihil in\r\nSarmatarum habitum foedantur.\" In many editions the semicolon is placed\r\nnot after _torpor_, but after _procerum_. The sense of the passage so\r\nread is: \"The chief men are lazy and stupid, besides being filthy, like\r\nall the rest. Intermarriage with the Sarmatians have debased.\" &c.\r\n\r\n[271] The Venedi extended beyond the Peucini and Bastarnae as far as the\r\nBaltic Sea; where is the Sinus Venedicus, now the Gulf of Dantzig. Their\r\nname is also preserved in Wenden, a part of Livonia. When the German\r\nnations made their irruption into Italy, France and Spain, the Venedi,\r\nalso called Winedi, occupied their vacant settlements between the\r\nVistula and Elbe. Afterwards they crossed the Danube, and seized\r\nDalmatia, Illyricum, Istria, Carniola, and the Noric Alps. A part of\r\nCarniola still retains the name of Windismarck, derived from them. This\r\npeople were also called Slavi; and their language, the Sclavonian, still\r\nprevails through a vast tract of country.\r\n\r\n[272] This is still the manner of living of the successors of the\r\nSarmatians, the Nogai Tartars.\r\n\r\n[273] Their country is called by Pliny, Eningia, now Finland. Warnefrid\r\n(De Gest. Langobard. i. 5) thus describes their savage and wretched\r\nstate:--\"The Scritobini, or Scritofinni, are not without snow in the\r\nmidst of summer; and, being little superior in sagacity to the brutes,\r\nlive upon no other food than the raw flesh of wild animals, the hairy\r\nskins of which they use for clothing. They derive their name, according\r\nto the barbarian tongue, from leaping, because they hunt wild beasts by\r\na certain method of leaping or springing with pieces of wood bent in\r\nthe shape of a bow.\" Here is an evident description of the snow-shoes or\r\nraquets in common use among the North American savages, as well as the\r\ninhabitants of the most northern parts of Europe.\r\n\r\n[274] As it is just after mentioned that their chief dependence is on\r\nthe game procured in hunting, this can only mean that the vegetable\r\nfood they use consists of wild herbs, in opposition to the cultivated\r\nproducts of the earth.\r\n\r\n[275] The Esquimaux and the South Sea islanders do the same thing to\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\n[276] People of Lapland. The origin of this fable was probably the\r\nmanner of clothing in these cold regions, where the inhabitants bury\r\nthemselves in the thickest furs, scarcely leaving anything of the form\r\nof a human creature.\r\n\r\n[277] It is with true judgment that this excellent historian forbears to\r\nintermix fabulous narrations with the very interesting and instructive\r\nmatter of this treatise. Such a mixture might have brought an\r\nimpeachment on the fidelity of the account in general; which,\r\nnotwithstanding the suspicions professed by some critics, contains\r\nnothing but what is entirely consonant to truth and nature. Had Tacitus\r\nindulged his invention in the description of German manners, is it\r\nprobable that he could have given so just a picture of the state of a\r\npeople under similar circumstances, the savage tribes of North America,\r\nas we have seen them within the present century? Is it likely that his\r\nrelations would have been so admirably confirmed by the codes of law\r\nstill extant of the several German nations; such as the Salic, Ripuary,\r\nBurgundian, English and Lombard? or that after the course of so many\r\ncenturies, and the numerous changes of empire, the customs, laws and\r\nmanners he describes should still be traced in all the various people\r\nof German derivation? As long as the original constitution and\r\njurisprudence of our own and other European countries are studied, this\r\ntreatise will be regarded as one of the most precious and authentic\r\nmonuments of historical antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF CNAEUS JULIUS AGRICOLA.\r\n\r\n[1] Rutilius was consul B.C. 104; and for his upright life and great\r\nstrictness was banished B.C. 92. Tacitus is the only writer who says he\r\nwrote his own life. Athenaeus mentions that he wrote a history of the\r\naffairs of Rome in the Greek language. Scaurus was consul B.C. 114, and\r\nagain B.C. 106. He is the same Scaurus whom Sallust mentions as having\r\nbeen bribed by Jugurtha. As the banishment of Rutilius took place on the\r\naccusation of Scaurus, it is possible that, when the former wrote his\r\nlife, the latter also wrote his, in order to defend himself from charges\r\nadvanced against him.\r\n\r\n[2] _Venia opus fuit_. This whole passage has greatly perplexed the\r\ncritics. The text is disputed, and it is not agreed why Tacitus asks\r\nindulgence. Brotier, Dronke, and others, say he asks indulgence for the\r\ninferiority of his style and manner _(incondita ac rudi voce_, c. 3), as\r\ncompared with the distinguished authors (_quisque celeberrimus_) of an\r\nearlier and better age. But there would have been no less occasion to\r\napologize for that, if the times he wrote of had not been so hostile to\r\nvirtue. Hertel, La Bletterie, and many French critics, understand\r\nthat he apologizes for writing the memoir of his father-in-law so late\r\n(_nunc_), when he was already dead (_defuncti_), instead of doing it,\r\nas the great men of a former day did, while the subject of their memoirs\r\nwas yet alive; and he pleads, in justification of the delay, that he\r\ncould not have written it earlier without encountering the dangers of\r\nthat cruel age (the age of Domitian). This makes a very good sense.\r\nThe only objection against it is, that the language, _opus fuit_, seems\r\nrather to imply that it was necessary to justify himself for writing\r\nit at all, by citing the examples of former distinguished writers of\r\nbiography, as he had done in the foregoing introduction. But why would\r\nit have been unnecessary to apologize for writing the life of Agricola,\r\nif the times in which he lived had not been so unfriendly to virtue?\r\nBecause then Agricola would have had opportunity to achieve victories\r\nand honors, which would have demanded narration, but for which the\r\njealousy and cruelty of Domitian now gave no scope. This is the\r\nexplanation of Roth; and he supports it by reference to the fact,\r\nthat the achievements of Agricola in the conquest of Britain, though\r\ndoubtless just as Tacitus has described them, yet occupy so small\r\na space in general history, that they are not even mentioned by any\r\nancient historian except Dio Cassius; and he mentions them chiefly out\r\nof regard to the discovery made by Agricola, for the first time, that\r\nBritain was an island (Vid. R. Exc. 1.) This explanation answers all the\r\ndemands of grammar and logic; but as a matter of taste and feeling, I\r\ncannot receive it. Such an apology for the unworthiness of his subject\r\nat the commencement of the biography, ill accords with the tone of\r\ndignified confidence which pervades the memoir. The best commentary I\r\nhave seen on the passage is that of Walther; and it would not, perhaps,\r\nbe giving more space to so mooted a question than the scholar requires,\r\nto extract it entire:--\"_Venia_,\" he says, \"is here nothing else than\r\nwhat we, in the language of modesty, call an apology, and has respect\r\nto the very justification he has just offered in the foregoing exordium.\r\nFor Tacitus there appeals to the usage, not of remote antiquity only,\r\nbut of later times also, to justify his design of writing the biography\r\nof a distinguished man. There would have been no need of such an apology\r\nin other times. In other times, dispensing with all preamble, he would\r\nhave begun, as in c. 4, 'Cnaeus Julius Agricola,' &c., assured that no\r\none would question the propriety of his course. But now, after a long\r\nand servile silence, when one begins again 'facta moresque posteris\r\ntradere,' when he utters the first word where speech and almost\r\nmemory (c. 2) had so long been lost, when he stands forth as the first\r\nvindicator of condemned virtue, he seems to venture on something so new,\r\nso strange, so bold, that it may well require apology.\" In commenting\r\nupon _cursaturus--tempora_, Walther adds: \"If there is any boldness in\r\nthe author's use of words here, that very fact suits the connection,\r\nthat by the complexion of his language even, he might paint the audacity\r\n'cursandi tam saeva et infesta virtutibus tempora'--of running over (as\r\nin a race, for such is Walther's interpretation of _cursandi_) times\r\nso cruel and so hostile to virtue. Not that those times could excite\r\nin Tacitus any real personal fear, for they were past, and he could now\r\nthink what he pleased, and speak what he thought (Hist. i. 1). Still\r\nhe shudders at the recollection of those cruelties; and he treads with\r\ntrembling footstep, as it were, even the path lately obstructed by them.\r\nHe looks about him to see whether, even now, he may safely utter his\r\nvoice, and he timidly asks pardon for venturing to break the reigning\r\nsilence.\"--_Tyler_.\r\n\r\n[3] A passage in Dio excellently illustrates the fact here referred\r\nto: \"He (Domitian) put to death Rusticus Arulenus, because he studied\r\nphilosophy, and had given Thrasea the appellation of holy; and Herennius\r\nSenecio, because, although he lived many years after serving the office\r\nof quaestor, he solicited no other post, and because he had written\r\nthe Life of Helvidius Priscus.\" (lxvii. p. 765.) With less accuracy,\r\nSuetonius, in his Life of Domitian (s. 10), says: \"He put to death\r\nJunius Rusticus, because he had published the panegyrics of Paetus\r\nThrasea and Helvidius Priscus, and had styled them most holy persons;\r\nand on this occasion he expelled all the philosophers from the city,\r\nand from. Italy.\" Arulenus Rusticus was a Stoic; on which account he was\r\ncontumeliously called by M. Regulus \"the ape of the Stoics, marked with\r\nthe Vitellian scar.\" (Pliny, Epist. i. 5.) Thrasea, who killed Nero, is\r\nparticularly recorded in the Annals, book xvi.\r\n\r\n[4] The expulsion of the philosophers, mentioned in the passage above\r\nquoted from Suetonius.\r\n\r\n[5] This truly happy period began when, after the death of Domitian,\r\nand the recision of his acts, the imperial authority devolved on Nerva,\r\nwhose virtues were emulated by the successive emperors, Trajan, Hadrian,\r\nand both the Antonines.\r\n\r\n[6] _Securitas publica_, \"the public security,\" was a current expression\r\nand wish, and was frequently inscribed on medals.\r\n\r\n[7] The term of Domitian's reign.\r\n\r\n[8] It appears that at this time Tacitus proposed to write not only the\r\nbooks of his History and Annals, which contain the \"memorial of past\r\nservitude,\" but an account of the \"present blessings\" exemplified in the\r\noccurrences under Nerva and Trajan.\r\n\r\n[9] There were two Roman colonies of this name; one in Umbria, supposed\r\nto be the place now called Friuli; the other in Narbonnensian Gaul, the\r\nmodern name of which is Frejus. This last was probably the birth-place\r\nof Agricola.\r\n\r\n[10] Of the procurators who were sent to the provinces, some had the\r\ncharge of the public revenue; others, not only of that, but of the\r\nprivate revenue of the emperor. These were the imperial procurators. All\r\nthe offices relative to the finances were in the possession of the Roman\r\nknights; of whom the imperial procurators were accounted noble. Hence\r\nthe equestrian nobility of which Tacitus speaks. In some of the lesser\r\nprovinces, the procurators had the civil jurisdiction, as well at the\r\nadministration of the revenue. This was the case in Judaea.\r\n\r\n[11] Seneca bears a very honorable testimony to this person, \"If,\" says\r\nhe, \"we have occasion for an example of a great mind, let us cite that\r\nof Julius Graecinus, an excellent person, whom Caius Caesar put to death\r\non this account alone, that he was a better man than could be suffered\r\nunder a tyrant.\" (De Benef. ii. 21.) His books concerning Vineyards are\r\ncommended by Columella and Pliny.\r\n\r\n[12] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[13] Marcus Silanus was the father of Claudia, the first wife of Caius.\r\nAccording to the historians of that period, Caius was jealous of him,\r\nand took every opportunity of mortifying him. Tacitus (Hist. iv. 48)\r\nmentions that the emperor deprived him of the military command of the\r\ntroops in Africa in an insulting manner. Dion (lix.) states, that when,\r\nfrom his age and rank, Silanus was usually asked his opinion first in\r\nthe senate, the emperor found a pretext for preventing this respect;\r\nbeing paid to MS worth. Suetonius (iv. 23) records that the emperor one\r\nday put to sea in a hasty manner, and commanded Silanus to follow him.\r\nThis, from fear of illness, he declined to do; upon which the emperor,\r\nalleging that he stayed on shore in order to get possession of the\r\ncity in case any accident befell himself, compelled him to cut his own\r\nthroat. It would seem, from the present passage of Tacitus, that there\r\nwere some legal forms taken in the case of Silanus, and that Julius\r\nGraecinus was ordered to be the accuser; and that that noble-minded\r\nman, refusing to take part in proceedings so cruel and iniquitous, was\r\nhimself put to death.\r\n\r\n[14] Of the part the Roman matrons took in the education of youth,\r\nTacitus has given an elegant and interesting account, in his Dialogue\r\nconcerning Oratory, c. 28.\r\n\r\n[15] Now Marseilles. This was a colony of the Phocaeans; whence it\r\nderived that Grecian politeness for which it was long famous.\r\n\r\n[16] It was usual for generals to admit young men of promising\r\ncharacters to this honorable companionship, which resembled the office\r\nof an aide-de-camp in the modern service. Thus, Suetonius informs us\r\nthat Caesar made his first campaign in Asia as tent-companion to Marcus\r\nThermus the praetor.\r\n\r\n[17] This was the fate of the colony of veterans at Camalodunum, now\r\nColchester or Maldon. A particular account of this revolt is given in\r\nthe 14th book of the Annals.\r\n\r\n[18] This alludes to the defeat of Petilius Cerialis, who came with the\r\nninth legion to succor the colony of Camalodunum. All the infantry were\r\nslaughtered; and Petilius, with the cavalry alone, got away to the camp.\r\nIt was shortly after this, that Suetonius defeated Boadicea and her\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n[19] Those of Nero.\r\n\r\n[20] The office of quaestor was the entrance to all public employments.\r\nThe quaestors and their secretaries were distributed by lot to the\r\nseveral provinces, that there might be no previous connections between\r\nthem and the governors, but they might serve as checks upon each other.\r\n\r\n[21] Brother of the emperor Otho.\r\n\r\n[22] At the head of the praetors, the number of whom was different at\r\ndifferent periods of the empire, were the Praetor Urbanus, and Praetor\r\nPeregrinus. The first administered justice among the citizens, the\r\nsecond among strangers. The rest presided at public debates, and had the\r\ncharge of exhibiting the public games, which were celebrated with\r\ngreat solemnity for seven successive days, and at a vast expense. This,\r\nindeed, in the times of the emperors, was almost the sole business of\r\nthe praetors, whose dignity, as Tacitus expresses it, consisted in the\r\nidle trappings of state; whence Boethius justly terms the praetorship\r\n\"an empty name, and a grievous burthen on the senatorian rank.\"\r\n\r\n[23] Nero had plundered the temples for the supply of his extravagance\r\nand debauchery. See Annals, xv. 45.\r\n\r\n[24] This was the year of Rome 822; from the birth of Christ, 69.\r\n\r\n[25] The cruelties and depredations committed on the coast of Italy by\r\nthis fleet are described in lively colors by Tacitus, Hist. ii. 12, 13.\r\n\r\n[26] Now the county of Vintimiglia. The attack upon the municipal town\r\nof this place, called Albium Intemelium, is particularly mentioned in\r\nthe passage above referred to.\r\n\r\n[27] In the month of July of this year.\r\n\r\n[28] The twentieth legion, surnamed the Victorious, was stationed in\r\nBritain at Deva, the modern Chester, where many inscriptions and other\r\nmonuments of Roman antiquities have been discovered.\r\n\r\n[29] Roscius Caelius. His disputes with the governor of Britain,\r\nTrebellius Maximus, are related by Tacitus, Hist. i. 60.\r\n\r\n[30] The governors of the province, and commanders in chief over all the\r\nlegions stationed in it.\r\n\r\n[31] He had formerly been commander of the ninth legion.\r\n\r\n[32] The province of Aquitania extended from the Pyrenean mountains to\r\nthe river Liger (Loire).\r\n\r\n[33] The governors of the neighboring provinces.\r\n\r\n[34] Agricola was consul in the year of Rome 830, A.D. 77, along with\r\nDomitian. They succeeded, in the calends of July, the consuls Vespasian\r\nand Titus, who began the year.\r\n\r\n[35] He was admitted into the Pontifical College, at the head of which\r\nwas the Pontifex Maximus.\r\n\r\n[36] Julius Caesar, Livy, Strabo, Fabius Rusticus, Pomponius Mela,\r\nPliny, &c.\r\n\r\n[37] Thus Caesar: \"One side of Britain inclines towards Spain, and the\r\nsetting sun; on which part Ireland is situated.\"--Bell. Gall. v. 13.\r\n\r\n[38] These, as well as other resemblances suggested by ancient\r\ngeographers, have been mostly destroyed by the greater accuracy of\r\nmodern maps.\r\n\r\n[39] This is so far true, that the northern extremity of Scotland is\r\nmuch narrower than the southern coast of England.\r\n\r\n[40] The Orkney Islands. These, although now first thoroughly known to\r\nthe Romans, had before been heard of, and mentioned by authors. Thus\r\nMela, in. 6: \"There are thirty of the Orcades, separated from each other\r\nby narrow straits.\" And Pliny, iv. 16: \"The Orcades are forty in number,\r\nat a small distance from each other.\" In the reign of Claudius, the\r\nreport concerning these islands was particularly current, and adulation\r\nconverted it into the news of a victory. Hence Hieronymus in his\r\nChronicon says, \"Claudius triumphed over the Britons, and added the\r\nOrcades to the Roman empire.\"\r\n\r\n[41] Camden supposes the Shetland Islands to be meant here by Thule;\r\nothers imagine it to have been one of the Hebrides. Pliny, iv. 16,\r\nmentions Thule as the most remote of all known islands; and, by placing\r\nit but one day's sail from the Frozen Ocean, renders it probable that\r\nIceland was intended. Procopius (Bell. Goth, ii. 15) speaks of another\r\nThule, which must have been Norway, which many of the ancients thought\r\nto be an island. Mr. Pennant supposes that the Thule here meant was\r\nFoula, a very lofty isle, one of the most westerly of the Shetlands,\r\nwhich might easily be descried by the fleet.\r\n\r\n[42] As far as the meaning of this passage can be elucidated, it would\r\nappear as if the first circumnavigators of Britain, to enhance the idea\r\nof their dangers and hardships, had represented the Northern sea as\r\nin such a thickened half solid state, that the oars could scarcely be\r\nworked, or the water agitated by winds. Tacitus, however, rather chooses\r\nto explain its stagnant condition from the want of winds, and the\r\ndifficulty of moving so great a body of waters. But the fact, taken\r\neither way, is erroneous; as this sea is never observed frozen, and is\r\nremarkably stormy and tempestuous.--_Aiken_.\r\n\r\n[43] The great number of firths and inlets of the sea, which almost cut\r\nthrough the northern parts of the island, as well as the height of the\r\ntides on the coast, render this observation peculiarly proper.\r\n\r\n[44] Caesar mentions that the interior inhabitants of Britain were\r\nsupposed to have originated in the island itself. (Bell. Gall. v. 12.)\r\n\r\n[45] Caledonia, now Scotland, was at that time overspread by vast\r\nforests. Thus Pliny, iv. 16, speaking of Britain, says, that \"for thirty\r\nyears past the Roman arms had not extended the knowledge of the island\r\nbeyond the Caledonian forest.\"\r\n\r\n[46] Inhabitants of what are now the counties of Glamorgan, Monmouth,\r\nBrecknock, Hereford, and Radnor.\r\n\r\n[47] The Iberi were a people of Spain, so called from their neighborhood\r\nto the river Iberus, now Ebro.\r\n\r\n[48] Of these, the inhabitants of Kent are honorably mentioned by\r\nCaesar. \"Of all these people, by far the most civilized are those\r\ninhabiting the maritime country of Cantium, who differ little in their\r\nmanners from the Gauls.\"--Bell. Gall. v. 14.\r\n\r\n[48] From the obliquity of the opposite coasts of England and France,\r\nsome part of the former runs further south than the northern extremity\r\nof the latter.\r\n\r\n[50] Particularly the mysterious and bloody solemnities of the Druids.\r\n\r\n[51] The children were born and nursed in this ferocity. Thus Solinus,\r\nc. 22, speaking of the warlike nation of Britons, says, \"When a woman\r\nis delivered of a male child, she lays its first food upon the husband's\r\nsword, and with the point gently puts it within the little one's mouth,\r\npraying to her country deities that his death may in like manner be in\r\nthe midst of arms.\"\r\n\r\n[52] In the reign of Claudius.\r\n\r\n[53] The practice of the Greeks in the Homeric age was the reverse of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n[54] Thus the kings Cunobelinus, Caractacus, and Prasutagus, and the\r\nqueens Cartismandua and Boadicea, are mentioned in different parts of\r\nTacitus.\r\n\r\n[55] Caesar says of Britain, \"the climate is more temperate than that of\r\nGaul, the cold being less severe.\" (Bell. Gall. v. 12.) This certainly\r\nproceeds from its insular situation, and the moistness of its\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n[56] Thus Pliny (ii. 75):--\"The longest day in Italy is of fifteen\r\nhours, in Britain of seventeen, where in summer the nights are light.\"\r\n\r\n[57] Tacitus, through the medium of Agricola, must have got this report,\r\neither from the men of Scandinavia, or from those of the Britons who had\r\npassed into that country, or been informed to this effect by those who\r\nhad visited it. It is quite true, that in the further part of Norway,\r\nand so also again in Iceland and the regions about the North Pole, there\r\nis, at the summer solstice, an almost uninterrupted day for nearly two\r\nmonths. Tacitus here seems to affirm this as universally the case, not\r\nhaving heard that, at the winter solstice, there is a night of equal\r\nduration.\r\n\r\n[58] Tacitus, after having given the report of the Britons as he had\r\nheard it, probably from Agricola, now goes on to state his own views\r\non the subject. He represents that, as the far north is level, there is\r\nnothing, when the sun is in the distant horizon, to throw up a shadow\r\ntowards the sky: that the light, indeed, is intercepted from the surface\r\nof the earth itself, and so there is darkness upon it; but that the sky\r\nabove is still clear and bright from its rays. And hence he supposes\r\nthat the brightness of the upper regions neutralizes the darkness on the\r\nearth, forming a degree of light equivalent to the evening twilight or\r\nthe morning dawn, or, indeed, rendering it next to impossible to decide\r\nwhen the evening closes and the morning begins. Compare the following\r\naccount, taken from a \"Description of a Visit to Shetland,\" in vol.\r\nviii. of Chambers' Miscellany:--\"Being now in the 60th degree of north\r\nlatitude, daylight could scarcely be said to have left us during the\r\nnight, and at 2 o'clock in the morning, albeit the mist still hung about\r\nus, we could see as clearly as we can do in London, at about any hour in\r\na November day.\"\r\n\r\n[59] Mr. Pennant has a pleasing remark concerning the soil and climate\r\nof our island, well agreeing with that of Tacitus:--\"The climate of\r\nGreat Britain is above all others productive of the greatest variety and\r\nabundance of wholesome vegetables, which, to crown our happiness, are\r\nalmost equally diffused through all its parts: this general fertility\r\nis owing to those clouded skies, which foreigners mistakenly urge as a\r\nreproach on our country: but let us cheerfully endure a temporary gloom,\r\nwhich clothes not only our meadows, but our hills, with the richest\r\nverdure.\"--Brit. Zool. 4to. i. 15.\r\n\r\n[60] Strabo (iv. 138) testifies the same. Cicero, on the other hand,\r\nasserts, that not a single grain of silver is found on this island. (Ep.\r\nad Attic, iv. 16.) If we have recourse to modern authorities, we\r\nfind Camden mentioning gold and silver mines in Cumberland, silver in\r\nFlintshire, and gold in Scotland. Dr. Borlase (Hist. of Cornwall, p.\r\n214) relates, that so late as the year 1753, several pieces of gold\r\nwere found in what the miners call stream tin; and silver is now got in\r\nconsiderable quantity from several of our lead ores. A curious paper,\r\nconcerning the Gold Mines of Scotland, is given by Mr. Pennant in\r\nAppend. (No. x.) to his second part of a \"Tour in Scotland in 1772,\" and\r\na much more general account of the mines and ores of Great Britain in\r\nearly times, in his \"Tour in Wales of 1773,\" pp. 51-66.\r\n\r\n[61] Camden mentions pearls being found in the counties of Caernarvon\r\nand Cumberland, and in the British sea. Mr. Pennant, in his \"Tour in\r\nScotland in 1769,\" takes notice of a considerable pearl fishery out of\r\nthe fresh-water mussel, in the vicinity of Perth, from whence 10,000_l._\r\nworth of pearls were sent to London from 1761 to 1764. It was, however,\r\nalmost exhausted when he visited the country. See also the fourth volume\r\nof Mr. Pennant's Br. Zool. (Class vi. No. 18), where he gives a much\r\nmore ample account of the British pearls. Origen, in his Comment. on\r\nMatthew, pp. 210, 211, gives a description of the British pearl, which,\r\nhe says, was next in value to the Indian;--\"Its surface is of a gold\r\ncolor, but it is cloudy, and less transparent than the Indian.\" Pliny\r\nspeaks of the British unions as follows:--\"It is certain that small and\r\ndiscolored ones are produced in Britain; since the deified Julius has\r\ngiven us to understand that the breastplate which he dedicated to Venus\r\nGenitrix, and placed in her temple, was made of British pearls.\"--ix.\r\n35.\r\n\r\n[62] Caesar's two expeditions into Britain were in the years of Rome\r\n699 and 700. He himself gives an account of them, and they are also\r\nmentioned by Strabo and Dio.\r\n\r\n[63] It was the wise policy of Augustus not to extend any further the\r\nlimits of the empire; and with regard to Britain, in particular, he\r\nthought the conquest and preservation of it would be attended with more\r\nexpense than it could repay. (Strabo, ii. 79, and iv. 138.) Tiberius,\r\nwho always professed an entire deference for the maxims and injunctions\r\nof Augustus, in this instance, probably, was convinced of their\r\npropriety.\r\n\r\n[64] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[65] Claudius invaded Britain in the year of Rome 796, A.D. 43.\r\n\r\n[66] In the parish of Dinder, near Hereford, are yet remaining the\r\nvestiges of a Roman encampment, called Oyster-hill, as is supposed from\r\nthis Ostorius.

A particular account of this revolt\r\nis given in the Annals, xiv. 31, and seq.\r\n\r\n[74] Of Camalodunum.\r\n\r\n[75] This was in A.D. 61. According to Tac. Hist. i. 6, Petronius\r\nTurpilianus was put to death by Galba, A.D. 68.\r\n\r\n[76] The date of his arrival is uncertain.\r\n\r\n[77] He was sent to Britain by Vespasian, A.D. 69.\r\n\r\n[78] The Brigantes inhabited Yorkshire, Lancashire, Westmoreland,\r\nCumberland, and Durham.\r\n\r\n[79] The date of his arrival in Britain is uncertain. This Frontinus\r\nis the author of the work on \"Stratagems,\" and, at the time of his\r\nappointment to the lieutenancy of Britain, he was _curator aquarum_ at\r\nRome. This, probably, it was that induced him to write his other work on\r\nthe aqueducts of Rome.\r\n\r\n[80] This seems to relate to his having been curtailed in his military\r\noperations by the parsimony of Vespasian, who refused him permission to\r\nattack other people than the Silures. See c. 11.\r\n\r\n[81] Where these people inhabited is mentioned in p. 355, note 5.\r\n\r\n[82] This was in the year of Rome 831, of Christ 78.\r\n\r\n[83] Inhabitants of North Wales, exclusive of the Isle of Anglesey.\r\n\r\n[84] _I.e._ Some were for immediate action, others for delay. Instead\r\nof _et quibus_, we read with Dr. Smith's edition (London, 1850), _ut\r\nquibus_.\r\n\r\n[85] _Vexilla_ is here used for _vexillarii_. \"Under the Empire the name\r\nof Vexillarii was given to a distinct body of soldiers supposed to have\r\nbeen composed of veterans, who were released from the military oath and\r\nregular service, but kept embodied under a separate flag (_vexillum_),\r\nto render assistance to the army if required, guard the frontier,\r\nand garrison recently conquered provinces; a certain number of these\r\nsupernumeraries being attached to each legion. (Tac. Hist. ii. 83, 100;\r\nAnn. i. 36.)\"--Rich, Comp. to Dict. and Lex. s. v. Vexillum.\r\n\r\n[86] A pass into the vale of Clwyd, in the parish of Llanarmon, is still\r\ncalled Bwlch Agrikle, probably from having been occupied by Agricola, in\r\nhis road to Mona.--_Mr. Pennant_.\r\n\r\n[87] From this circumstance it would appear that these auxiliaries were\r\nBatavians, whose skill in this practice is related by Tacitus, Hist. iv.\r\n12.\r\n\r\n[88] It was customary for the Roman generals to decorate with sprigs of\r\nlaurel the letters in which they sent home the news of any remarkable\r\nsuccess. Thus Pliny, xv. 30: \"The laurel, the principal messenger of joy\r\nand victory among the Romans, is affixed to letters, and to the spears\r\nand javelins of the soldiers.\" The _laurus_ of the ancients was probably\r\nthe baytree, and not what we now call laurel.\r\n\r\n[89] _Ascire_, al. _accire_, \"To receive into regular service.\" The\r\nreference is to the transfer of soldiers from the supernumeraries to\r\nthe legions. So Walch, followed by Dronke, Both, and Walther. The next\r\nclause implies, that he took care to receive into the service none but\r\nthe best men (_optimum quemque_), who, he was confident, would prove\r\nfaithful (_fidelissimum_).\r\n\r\n[90] In like manner Suetonius says of Julius Caesar, \"He neither noticed\r\nnor punished every crime; but while he strictly inquired into and\r\nrigorously punished desertion and mutiny, he connived at other\r\ndelinquencies.\"--Life of Julius Caesar, s. 67.\r\n\r\n[91] Many commentators propose reading \"exaction,\" instead of\r\n\"augmentation.\" But the latter may be suffered to remain, especially as\r\nSuetonius informs us that \"Vespasian, not contented with renewing some\r\ntaxes remitted under Galba, added new and heavy ones: and augmented the\r\ntributes paid by the provinces, even doubling some.\"--Life of Vesp. s.\r\n19.\r\n\r\n[92] In the year of Rome 832. A.D. 79.\r\n\r\n[93] Many vestiges of these or other Roman camps yet remain in different\r\nparts of Great Britain. Two principal ones, in the county of Annandale,\r\nin Scotland, called Burnswork and Middleby, are described at large by\r\nGordon in his Itiner. Septentrion, pp. 16, 18.\r\n\r\n[94] The year of Rome 833, A.D. 80.\r\n\r\n[95] Now the Firth of Tay.\r\n\r\n[96] The principal of these was at Ardoch, seated so as to command the\r\nentrance into two valleys, Strathallan and Strathearn. A description\r\nand plan of its remains, still in good preservation, are given by Mr.\r\nPennant in his Tour in Scotland in 1772, part ii. p. 101.\r\n\r\n[97] The year of Rome 834, A.D. 81.\r\n\r\n[98] The Firths of Clyde and Forth.\r\n\r\n[99] The neck of land between these opposite arms of the sea is only\r\nabout thirty miles over. About fifty-five years after Agricola had left\r\nthe island, Lollius Urbicus, governor of Britain under Antoninus Pius,\r\nerected a vast wall or rampart, extending from Old Kirkpatrick on the\r\nClyde, to Caeridden, two miles west of Abercorn, on the Forth, a space\r\nof nearly thirty-seven miles, defended by twelve or thirteen forts.\r\nThese are supposed to have been on the site of those of Agricola. This\r\nwall is usually called Graham's dike; and some parts of it are now\r\nsubsisting.\r\n\r\n[100] The year of Rome 835, A.D. 82.\r\n\r\n[101] Crossing the Firth of Clyde, or Dumbarton Bay, and turning to the\r\nwestern coast of Argyleshire, or the Isles of Arran and Bute.\r\n\r\n[102] The Bay of Biscay.\r\n\r\n[103] The Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[104] The year of Rome 836, A.D. 83.\r\n\r\n[105] The eastern parts of Scotland, north of the Firth of Forth, where\r\nnow are the counties of Fife, Kinross, Perth, Angus, &c.\r\n\r\n[106] This legion, which had been weakened by many engagements, was\r\nafterwards recruited, and then called Gemina. Its station at this affair\r\nis supposed by Gordon to have been Lochore in Fifeshire. Mr. Pennant\r\nrather imagines the place of the attack to have been Comerie in\r\nPerthshire.\r\n\r\n[107] For an account of these people see Manners of the Germans, c. 32.\r\n\r\n[108] Mr. Pennant had a present made him in Skye, of a brass sword and a\r\ndenarius found in that island. Might they not have been lost by some of\r\nthese people in one of their landings?\r\n\r\n[109] The Rhine.\r\n\r\n[110] This extraordinary expedition, according to Dio, set out from the\r\nwestern side of the island. They therefore must have coasted all that\r\npart of Scotland, must have passed the intricate navigation through the\r\nHebrides, and the dangerous strait of Pentland Firth, and, after coming\r\nround to the eastern side, must have been driven to the mouth of the\r\nBaltic Sea, Here they lost their ships; and, in their attempt to proceed\r\nhomeward by land, were seized as pirates, part by the Suevi, and the\r\nrest by the Frisii.\r\n\r\n[111] The year of Rome 837, A.D. 84.\r\n\r\n[112] The scene of this celebrated engagement is by Gordon (Itin.\r\nSeptent.) supposed to be in Strathern, near a place now called the\r\nKirk of Comerie, where are the remains of two Roman camps. Mr. Pennant,\r\nhowever, in his Tour in 1772, part ii. p. 96, gives reasons which appear\r\nwell founded for dissenting from Gordon's opinion.\r\n\r\n[113] The more usual spelling of this name is Galgacus; but the other is\r\npreferred as of better authority.\r\n\r\n[114] \"Peace given to the world\" is a very frequent inscription on the\r\nRoman medals.\r\n\r\n[115] It was the Roman policy to send the recruits raised in the\r\nprovinces to some distant country, for fear of their desertion or\r\nrevolt.\r\n\r\n[116] How much this was the fate of the Romans themselves, when, in\r\nthe decline of the empire, they were obliged to pay tribute to the\r\nsurrounding barbarians, is shown in lively colors by Salvian:--\"We call\r\nthat a gift which is a purchase, and a purchase of a condition the most\r\nhard and miserable. For all captives, when they are once redeemed,\r\nenjoy their liberty: we are continually paying a ransom, yet are never\r\nfree.\"--De Gubern. Dei, vi.\r\n\r\n[118] The expedition of Claudius into Britain was in the year of Rome\r\n796, from which to the period of this engagement only forty-two years\r\nwere elapsed. The number fifty therefore is given oratorically rather\r\nthan accurately.\r\n\r\n[119] The Latin word used here, _covinarius_, signifies the driver of\r\na _covinus_, or chariot, the axle of which was bent into the form of\r\na scythe. The British manner of fighting from chariots is particularly\r\ndescribed by Caesar, who gives them the name of _esseda_:--\"The\r\nfollowing is the manner of fighting from _essedae_: They first drive\r\nround with them to all parts of the line, throwing their javelins, and\r\ngenerally disordering the ranks by the very alarm occasioned by the\r\nhorses, and the rattling of the wheels: then, as soon as they have\r\ninsinuated themselves between the troops of horse, they leap from their\r\nchariots and fight on foot. The drivers then withdraw a little from the\r\nbattle, in order that, if their friends are overpowered by numbers,\r\nthey may have a secure retreat to the chariots. Thus they act with\r\nthe celerity of horse, and the stability of foot; and by daily use and\r\nexercise they acquire the power of holding up their horses at full speed\r\ndown a steep declivity, of stopping them suddenly, and turning in a\r\nshort compass; and they accustom themselves to run upon the pole, and\r\nstand on the cross-tree, and from thence with great agility to recover\r\ntheir place in the chariot.\"--Bell. Gall. iv. 33.\r\n\r\n[120] These targets, called _cetrae_, in the Latin, were made of\r\nleather. The broad sword and target were till very lately the peculiar\r\narms of the Highlanders.\r\n\r\n[121] Several inscriptions have been found in Britain commemorating the\r\nTungrian cohorts.\r\n\r\n[122] The great conciseness of Tacitus has rendered the description of\r\nthis battle somewhat obscure. The following, however, seems to have been\r\nthe general course of occurrences in it:--The foot on both sides began\r\nthe engagement. The first line of the Britons which was formed on the\r\nplain being broken, the Roman auxiliaries advanced up the hill after\r\nthem. In the meantime the Roman horse in the wings, unable to withstand\r\nthe shock of the chariots, gave way, and were pursued by the British\r\nchariots and horse, which then fell in among the Roman infantry, These,\r\nwho at first had relaxed their files to prevent their being out-fronted,\r\nnow closed, in order better to resist the enemy, who by this means were\r\nunable to penetrate them. The chariots and horse, therefore, became\r\nentangled amidst the inequalities of the ground, and the thick ranks\r\nof the Romans; and, no longer able to wheel and career as upon the open\r\nplain, gave not the least appearance of an equestrian skirmish: but,\r\nkeeping their footing with difficulty on the declivity, were pushed off,\r\nand scattered in disorder over the field.\r\n\r\n[123] People of Fifeshire.\r\n\r\n[124] Where this was does not appear. Brotier calls it Sandwich, making\r\nit the same as _Rutupium_: others Plymouth or Portsmouth. It is clear,\r\nhowever, this cannot be the case, from the subsequent words.--_White_.\r\n\r\n[125] This circumnavigation was in a contrary direction to that of the\r\nUsipian deserters, the fleet setting out from the Firth of Tay on the\r\neastern coast, and sailing round the northern, western, and southern\r\ncoasts, till it arrived at the port of Sandwich in Kent. After staying\r\nhere some time to refit, it went to its former station, in the Firth of\r\nForth, or Tay.\r\n\r\n[126] It was in this same year that Domitian made his pompous expedition\r\ninto Germany, from whence he returned without ever seeing the enemy.\r\n\r\n[127] Caligula in like manner got a number of tall men with their hair\r\ndyed red to give credit to a pretended victory over the Germans.\r\n\r\n[128] Thus Pliny, in his Panegyric on Trajan, xlviii., represents\r\nDomitian as \"ever affecting darkness and secrecy, and never emerging\r\nfrom his solitude but in order to make a solitude.\"\r\n\r\n[129] Not the triumph itself, which, after the year of Rome 740 was no\r\nlonger granted to private persons, but reserved for the imperial family.\r\nThis new piece of adulation was invented by Agrippa in order to gratify\r\nAugustus. The \"triumphal ornaments\" which were still bestowed, were a\r\npeculiar garment, statue, and other insignia which had distinguished the\r\nperson of the triumphing general.\r\n\r\n[130] Of Dover.\r\n\r\n[131] Domitian, it seems, was afraid that Agricola might refuse to obey\r\nthe recall he forwarded to him, and even maintain his post by force. He\r\ntherefore despatched one of his confidential freedmen with an autograph\r\nletter, wherein he was informed Syria was given to him as his province.\r\nThis, however, was a mere ruse: and hence it was not to be delivered\r\nas Agricola had already set out on his return. In compliance with these\r\ninstructions, the freedman returned at once to Domitian, when he found\r\nAgricola on his passage to Rome According to Dion (liii.), the emperor's\r\nlieutenants were required to leave their province immediately upon\r\nthe arrival of their successor, and return to Rome within three\r\nmonths.--_White_.\r\n\r\n[132] Agricola's successor in Britain appears to have been Sallustius\r\nLucullus, who, as Suetonius informs us, was put to death by Domitian\r\nbecause he, permitted certain lances of a new construction to be palled\r\nLucullean.--Life of Domitian, s. 10.\r\n\r\n[133] Of this worst kind of enemies, who praise a man in order to render\r\nhim obnoxious, the emperor Julian, who had himself suffered greatly by\r\nthem, speaks feelingly in his 12th epistle to Basilius;--\"For we live\r\ntogether not in that state of dissimulation, which, I imagine, you have\r\nhitherto experienced: in which those who praise you, hate you with a\r\nmore confirmed aversion than your most inveterate enemies.\"\r\n\r\n[134] These calamitous events are recorded by Suetonius in his Life of\r\nDomitian.\r\n\r\n[135] The Rhine and Danube.\r\n\r\n[136] The two senior consulars cast lots for the government of Asia and\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n[137] Suetonius relates that Civica Cerealis was put to death in his\r\nproconsulate of Asia, on the charge of meditating a revolt. (Life of\r\nDomitian, s. 10.)\r\n\r\n[138] Obliging persons to return thanks for an injury was a refinement\r\nin tyranny frequently practised by the worst of the Roman emperors. Thus\r\nSeneca informs us, that \"Caligula was thanked by those whose children\r\nhad been put to death, and whose property had been confiscated.\" (De\r\nTranquil, xiv.) And again;--\"The reply of a person who had grown old in\r\nhis attendance on kings, when he was asked how he had attained a thing\r\nso uncommon in courts as old age? is well known. It was, said he, by\r\nreceiving injuries, and returning thanks.\"--De Ira, ii. 33.\r\n\r\n[139] From a passage in Dio, lxxviii. p. 899, this sum appears to have\r\nbeen _decies sestertium_, about 9,000_l._ sterling.\r\n\r\n[140] Thus Seneca: \"Little souls rendered insolent by prosperity have\r\nthis worst property, that they hate those whom they have injured.\"--De\r\nIra, ii. 33.\r\n\r\n[141] Several who suffered under Nero and Domitian erred, though nobly,\r\nin this respect.\r\n\r\n[142] A Greek epigram still extant of Antiphilus, a Byzantine, to the\r\nmemory of a certain Agricola, is supposed by the learned to refer to the\r\ngreat man who is the subject of this work. It is in the Anthologia, lib.\r\ni. tit. 37.\r\n\r\n[143] Dio absolutely affirms it; but from the manner in which Tacitus,\r\nwho had better means of information, speaks of it, the story was\r\nprobably false.\r\n\r\n[144] It appears that the custom of making the emperor co-heir with the\r\nchildren of the testator was not by any means uncommon. It was done in\r\norder to secure the remainder to the family. Thus Prasutagus, king of\r\nthe Iceni in Britain, made Nero co-heir with his two daughters. Thus\r\nwhen Lucius Vetus was put to death by Nero, his friends urged him to\r\nleave part of his property to the emperor, that his grandsons might\r\nenjoy the rest. (Ann. xvi. 11.) Suetonius (viii. 17) mentions that\r\nDomitian used to seize the estates of persons the most unknown to him,\r\nif any one could be found to assert that the deceased had expressed an\r\nintention to make the emperor his heir.--_White_.\r\n\r\n[145] Caligula. This was A.D. 40, when he was sole consul.\r\n\r\n[146] According to this account, the birth of Agricola was on June 13th,\r\nin the year of Rome 793, A.D. 40; and his death on August 23d, in the\r\nyear of Rome 846 A.D. 93: for this appears by the Fasti Consulares\r\nto have been the year of the consulate of Collega and Priscus. He\r\nwas therefore only in his fifty-fourth year when he died; so that the\r\ncopyists must probably have written by mistake LVI. instead of LIV.\r\n\r\n[147] From this representation, Dio appears to have been mistaken in\r\nasserting that Agricola passed the latter part of his life in dishonor\r\nand penury.\r\n\r\n[148] Juvenal breaks out in a noble strain of indignation against this\r\nsavage cruelty, which distinguished the latter part of Domitian's reign:\r\n\r\n  Atque utinam his potius nugis tota illa dedisset\r\n  Tempora saevitiae: claras quibus abstulit Urbi\r\n  Illustresque animas impune, et vindice nullo.\r\n  Sed periit, postquam cerdonibus esse timendus\r\n  Coeperat: hoc nocuit Lamiarum, caede madenti.--Sat. iv. 150.\r\n\r\n  \"What folly this! but oh! that all the rest\r\n  Of his dire reign had thus been spent in jest!\r\n  And all that time such trifles had employ'd\r\n  In which so many nobles he destroy'd!\r\n  He safe, they unrevenged, to the disgrace\r\n  Of the surviving, tame, patrician race!\r\n  But when he dreadful to the rabble grew,\r\n    Him, who so many lords had slain, they slew.\"--DUKE.\r\n\r\n [149] This happened in the year of Rome 848.\r\n\r\n[150] Carus and Massa, who were proverbially infamous as informers,\r\nare represented by Juvenal as dreading a still more dangerous villain,\r\nHeliodorus.\r\n\r\n  --Quem Massa timet, quem munere palpat\r\n  Carus.--Sat. i. 35.\r\n\r\n  \"Whom Massa dreads, whom Carus soothes with bribes.\"\r\n\r\nCarus is also mentioned with deserved infamy by Pliny and Martial. He\r\nwas a mimic by profession.\r\n\r\n[151] Of this odious instrument of tyranny, Pliny the younger thus\r\nspeaks: \"The conversation turned upon Catullus Messalinus, whose loss\r\nof sight added the evils of blindness to a cruel disposition. He was\r\nirreverent, unblushing, unpitying, Like a weapon, of itself blind and\r\nunconscious, he was frequently hurled by Domitian against every man of\r\nworth.\" (iv. 22.) Juvenal launches the thunder of invective against him\r\nin the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  Et cum mortifero prudens Vejento Catullo,\r\n  Qui numquam visae flagrabat amore puellae,\r\n  Grande, et conspicuum nostro quoque tempore monstrum,\r\n  Caecus adulator, dirusque a ponte satelles,\r\n  Dignus Aricinos qui mendicaret ad axes,\r\n  Blandaque devexae jactaret basia rhedae.--Sat. iv. 113.\r\n\r\n  \"Cunning Vejento next, and by his side\r\n  Bloody Catullus leaning on his guide:\r\n  Decrepit, yet a furious lover he,\r\n  And deeply smit with charms he could not see.\r\n  A monster, that ev'n this worst age outvies,\r\n  Conspicuous and above the common size.\r\n  A blind base flatterer; from some bridge or gate,\r\n  Raised to a murd'ring minister of state.\r\n  Deserving still to beg upon the road,\r\n  And bless each passing wagon and its load.\"--DUKE.\r\n\r\n[152] This was a famous villa of Domitian's, near the site of the\r\nancient Alba, about twelve miles from Rome. The place is now called\r\nAlbano, and vast ruins of its magnificent edifices still remain.\r\n\r\n[153] Tacitus, in his History, mentions this Massa Baebius as a person\r\nmost destructive to all men of worth, and constantly engaged on the\r\nside of villains. From a letter of Pliny's to Tacitus, it appears that\r\nHerennius Senecio and himself were joined as counsel for the province\r\nof Boetica in a prosecution of Massa Baebius; and that Massa after his\r\ncondemnation petitioned the consuls for liberty to prosecute Senecio for\r\ntreason.\r\n\r\n[154] By \"our own hands,\" Tacitus means one of our own body, a senator.\r\nAs Publicius Certus had seized upon Helvidius and led him to prison,\r\nTacitus imputes the crime to the whole senatorian order. To the same\r\npurpose Pliny observes: \"Amidst the numerous villanies of numerous\r\npersons, nothing appeared more atrocious than that in the senate-house\r\none senator should lay hands on another, a praetorian on a consular man,\r\na judge on a criminal.\"--B. ix. ep. 13.\r\n\r\n[155] Helvidius Priscus, a friend of Pliny the younger, who did not\r\nsuffer his death to remain unrevenged. See the Epistle above referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\n[156] There is in this place some defect in the manuscripts, which\r\ncritics have endeavored to supply in different manners. Brotier seems to\r\nprefer, though he does not adopt in the text, \"nos Mauricum Rusticumque\r\ndivisimus,\" \"we parted Mauricus and Rusticus,\" by the death of one\r\nand the banishment of the other. The prosecution and crime of Rusticus\r\n(Arulenus) is mentioned at the beginning of this piece, c. 2. Mauricus\r\nwas his brother.\r\n\r\n[157] Herennius Senecio. See c. 2.\r\n\r\n[158] Thus Pliny, in his Panegyr. on Trajan, xlviii.: \"Domitian was\r\nterrible even to behold; pride in his brow, anger in his eyes, a\r\nfeminine paleness in the rest of his body, in his face shamelessness\r\nsuffused in a glowing red.\" Seneca, in Epist. xi. remarks, that \"some\r\nare never more to be dreaded than when they blush; as if they had\r\neffused all their modesty. Sylla was always most furious when the blood\r\nhad mounted into his cheeks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Germany and the Agricola of Tacitus, by Tacitus",
