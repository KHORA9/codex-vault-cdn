Under the name of The Reign of Greed it is for the first\r\ntime translated into English. Written some four or five years after\r\nNoli Me Tangere, the book represents Rizal’s more mature judgment on\r\npolitical and social conditions in the islands, and in its graver and\r\nless hopeful tone reflects the disappointments and discouragements\r\nwhich he had encountered in his efforts to lead the way to reform.\r\nRizal’s dedication to the first edition is of special interest, as the\r\nwriting of it was one of the grounds of accusation against him when he\r\nwas condemned to death in 1896. It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “To the memory of the priests, Don Mariano Gomez (85 years old),\r\n    Don José Burgos (30 years old), and Don Jacinto Zamora (35 years\r\n    old). Executed in Bagumbayan Field on the 28th of February, 1872.\r\n\r\n    “The Church, by refusing to degrade you, has placed in doubt the\r\n    crime that has been imputed to you; the Government, by surrounding\r\n    your trials with mystery and shadows, causes the belief that there\r\n    was some error, committed in fatal moments; and all the\r\n    Philippines, by worshiping your memory and calling you martyrs, in\r\n    no sense recognizes your culpability. In so far, therefore, as your\r\n    complicity in the Cavite mutiny is not clearly proved, as you may\r\n    or may not have been patriots, and as you may or may not have\r\n    cherished sentiments for justice and for liberty, I have the right\r\n    to dedicate my work to you as victims of the evil which I undertake\r\n    to combat. And while we await expectantly upon Spain some day to\r\n    restore your good name and cease to be answerable for your death,\r\n    let these pages serve as a tardy wreath of dried leaves over your\r\n    unknown tombs, and let it be understood that every one who without\r\n    clear proofs attacks your memory stains his hands in your blood!\r\n\r\n        J. Rizal.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA brief recapitulation of the story in Noli Me Tangere (The Social\r\nCancer) is essential to an understanding of such plot as there is in\r\nthe present work, which the author called a “continuation” of the first\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nJuan Crisostomo Ibarra is a young Filipino, who, after studying for\r\nseven years in Europe, returns to his native land to find that his\r\nfather, a wealthy landowner, has died in prison as the result of a\r\nquarrel with the parish curate, a Franciscan friar named Padre Damaso.\r\nIbarra is engaged to a beautiful and accomplished girl, Maria Clara,\r\nthe supposed daughter and only child of the rich Don Santiago de los\r\nSantos, commonly known as “Capitan Tiago,” a typical Filipino cacique,\r\nthe predominant character fostered by the friar régime.\r\n\r\nIbarra resolves to forego all quarrels and to work for the betterment\r\nof his people. To show his good intentions, he seeks to establish, at\r\nhis own expense, a public school in his native town. He meets with\r\nostensible support from all, especially Padre Damaso’s successor, a\r\nyoung and gloomy Franciscan named Padre Salvi, for whom Maria Clara\r\nconfesses to an instinctive dread.\r\n\r\nAt the laying of the corner-stone for the new schoolhouse a suspicious\r\naccident, apparently aimed at Ibarra’s life, occurs, but the\r\nfestivities proceed until the dinner, where Ibarra is grossly and\r\nwantonly insulted over the memory of his father by Fray Damaso. The\r\nyoung man loses control of himself and is about to kill the friar, who\r\nis saved by the intervention of Maria Clara.\r\n\r\nIbarra is excommunicated, and Capitan Tiago, through his fear of the\r\nfriars, is forced to break the engagement and agree to the marriage of\r\nMaria Clara with a young and inoffensive Spaniard provided by Padre\r\nDamaso. Obedient to her reputed father’s command and influenced by her\r\nmysterious dread of Padre Salvi, Maria Clara consents to this\r\narrangement, but becomes seriously ill, only to be saved by medicines\r\nsent secretly by Ibarra and clandestinely administered by a girl\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nIbarra succeeds in having the excommunication removed, but before he\r\ncan explain matters an uprising against the Civil Guard is secretly\r\nbrought about through agents of Padre Salvi, and the leadership is\r\nascribed to Ibarra to ruin him. He is warned by a mysterious friend, an\r\noutlaw called Elias, whose life he had accidentally saved; but desiring\r\nfirst to see Maria Clara, he refuses to make his escape, and when the\r\noutbreak occurs he is arrested as the instigator of it and thrown into\r\nprison in Manila.\r\n\r\nOn the evening when Capitan Tiago gives a ball in his Manila house to\r\ncelebrate his supposed daughter’s engagement, Ibarra makes his escape\r\nfrom prison and succeeds in seeing Maria Clara alone. He begins to\r\nreproach her because it is a letter written to her before he went to\r\nEurope which forms the basis of the charge against him, but she clears\r\nherself of treachery to him. The letter had been secured from her by\r\nfalse representations and in exchange for two others written by her\r\nmother just before her birth, which prove that Padre Damaso is her real\r\nfather. These letters had been accidentally discovered in the convento\r\nby Padre Salvi, who made use of them to intimidate the girl and get\r\npossession of Ibarra’s letter, from which he forged others to\r\nincriminate the young man. She tells him that she will marry the young\r\nSpaniard, sacrificing herself thus to save her mother’s name and\r\nCapitan Tiago’s honor and to prevent a public scandal, but that she\r\nwill always remain true to him.\r\n\r\nIbarra’s escape had been effected by Elias, who conveys him in a banka\r\nup the Pasig to the Lake, where they are so closely beset by the Civil\r\nGuard that Elias leaps into the water and draws the pursuers away from\r\nthe boat, in which Ibarra lies concealed.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve, at the tomb of the Ibarras in a gloomy wood, Elias\r\nappears, wounded and dying, to find there a boy named Basilio beside\r\nthe corpse of his mother, a poor woman who had been driven to insanity\r\nby her husband’s neglect and abuses on the part of the Civil Guard, her\r\nyounger son having disappeared some time before in the convento, where\r\nhe was a sacristan. Basilio, who is ignorant of Elias’s identity, helps\r\nhim to build a funeral pyre, on which his corpse and the madwoman’s are\r\nto be burned.\r\n\r\nUpon learning of the reported death of Ibarra in the chase on the Lake,\r\nMaria Clara becomes disconsolate and begs her supposed godfather, Fray\r\nDamaso, to put her in a nunnery. Unconscious of her knowledge of their\r\ntrue relationship, the friar breaks down and confesses that all the\r\ntrouble he has stirred up with the Ibarras has been to prevent her from\r\nmarrying a native, which would condemn her and her children to the\r\noppressed and enslaved class. He finally yields to her entreaties and\r\nshe enters the nunnery of St. Clara, to which Padre Salvi is soon\r\nassigned in a ministerial capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        O masters, lords, and rulers in all lands,\r\n        Is this the handiwork you give to God,\r\n        This monstrous thing distorted and soul-quenched?\r\n        How will you ever straighten up this shape-;\r\n        Touch it again with immortality;\r\n        Give back the upward looking and the light;\r\n        Rebuild in it the music and the dream;\r\n        Make right the immemorial infamies,\r\n        Perfidious wrongs, immedicable woes?\r\n\r\n        O masters, lords, and rulers in all lands,\r\n        How will the future reckon with this man?\r\n        How answer his brute question in that hour\r\n        When whirlwinds of rebellion shake the world?\r\n        How will it be with kingdoms and with kings—\r\n        With those who shaped him to the thing he is—\r\n        When this dumb terror shall reply to God,\r\n        After the silence of the centuries?\r\n\r\n                                                Edwin Markham\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n        I.

She was a heavily built steamer,\r\nalmost round, like the tabú from which she derived her name, quite\r\ndirty in spite of her pretensions to whiteness, majestic and grave from\r\nher leisurely motion. Altogether, she was held in great affection in\r\nthat region, perhaps from her Tagalog name, or from the fact that she\r\nbore the characteristic impress of things in the country, representing\r\nsomething like a triumph over progress, a steamer that was not a\r\nsteamer at all, an organism, stolid, imperfect yet unimpeachable,\r\nwhich, when it wished to pose as being rankly progressive, proudly\r\ncontented itself with putting on a fresh coat of paint. Indeed, the\r\nhappy steamer was genuinely Filipino! If a person were only reasonably\r\nconsiderate, she might even have been taken for the Ship of State,\r\nconstructed, as she had been, under the inspection of Reverendos and\r\nIlustrísimos....\r\n\r\nBathed in the sunlight of a morning that made the waters of the river\r\nsparkle and the breezes rustle in the bending bamboo on its banks,\r\nthere she goes with her white silhouette throwing out great clouds of\r\nsmoke—the Ship of State, so the joke runs, also has the vice of\r\nsmoking! The whistle shrieks at every moment, hoarse and commanding\r\nlike a tyrant who would rule by shouting, so that no one on board can\r\nhear his own thoughts. She menaces everything she meets: now she looks\r\nas though she would grind to bits the salambaw, insecure fishing\r\napparatus which in their movements resemble skeletons of giants\r\nsaluting an antediluvian tortoise; now she speeds straight toward the\r\nclumps of bamboo or against the amphibian structures, karihan, or\r\nwayside lunch-stands, which, amid gumamelas and other flowers, look\r\nlike indecisive bathers who with their feet already in the water cannot\r\nbring themselves to make the final plunge; at times, following a sort\r\nof channel marked out in the river by tree-trunks, she moves along with\r\na satisfied air, except when a sudden shock disturbs the passengers and\r\nthrows them off their balance, all the result of a collision with a\r\nsand-bar which no one dreamed was there.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if the comparison with the Ship of State is not yet complete,\r\nnote the arrangement of the passengers. On the lower deck appear brown\r\nfaces and black heads, types of Indians, [1] Chinese, and mestizos,\r\nwedged in between bales of merchandise and boxes, while there on the\r\nupper deck, beneath an awning that protects them from the sun, are\r\nseated in comfortable chairs a few passengers dressed in the fashion of\r\nEuropeans, friars, and government clerks, each with his puro cigar, and\r\ngazing at the landscape apparently without heeding the efforts of the\r\ncaptain and the sailors to overcome the obstacles in the river.\r\n\r\nThe captain was a man of kindly aspect, well along in years, an old\r\nsailor who in his youth had plunged into far vaster seas, but who now\r\nin his age had to exercise much greater attention, care, and vigilance\r\nto avoid dangers of a trivial character. And they were the same for\r\neach day: the same sand-bars, the same hulk of unwieldy steamer wedged\r\ninto the same curves, like a corpulent dame in a jammed throng. So, at\r\neach moment, the good man had to stop, to back up, to go forward at\r\nhalf speed, sending—now to port, now to starboard—the five sailors\r\nequipped with long bamboo poles to give force to the turn the rudder\r\nhad suggested. He was like a veteran who, after leading men through\r\nhazardous campaigns, had in his age become the tutor of a capricious,\r\ndisobedient, and lazy boy.\r\n\r\nDoña Victorina, the only lady seated in the European group, could say\r\nwhether the Tabo was not lazy, disobedient, and capricious—Doña\r\nVictorina, who, nervous as ever, was hurling invectives against the\r\ncascos, bankas, rafts of coconuts, the Indians paddling about, and even\r\nthe washerwomen and bathers, who fretted her with their mirth and\r\nchatter. Yes, the Tabo would move along very well if there were no\r\nIndians in the river, no Indians in the country, yes, if there were not\r\na single Indian in the world—regardless of the fact that the helmsmen\r\nwere Indians, the sailors Indians, Indians the engineers, Indians\r\nninety-nine per cent, of the passengers, and she herself also an Indian\r\nif the rouge were scratched off and her pretentious gown removed. That\r\nmorning Doña Victorina was more irritated than usual because the\r\nmembers of the group took very little notice of her, reason for which\r\nwas not lacking; for just consider—there could be found three friars,\r\nconvinced that the world would move backwards the very day they should\r\ntake a single step to the right; an indefatigable Don Custodio who was\r\nsleeping peacefully, satisfied with his projects; a prolific writer\r\nlike Ben-Zayb (anagram of Ibañez), who believed that the people of\r\nManila thought because he, Ben-Zayb, was a thinker; a canon like Padre\r\nIrene, who added luster to the clergy with his rubicund face, carefully\r\nshaven, from which towered a beautiful Jewish nose, and his silken\r\ncassock of neat cut and small buttons; and a wealthy jeweler like\r\nSimoun, who was reputed to be the adviser and inspirer of all the acts\r\nof his Excellency, the Captain-General—just consider the presence there\r\nof these pillars sine quibus non of the country, seated there in\r\nagreeable discourse, showing little sympathy for a renegade Filipina\r\nwho dyed her hair red! Now wasn’t this enough to exhaust the patience\r\nof a female Job—a sobriquet Doña Victorina always applied to herself\r\nwhen put out with any one!\r\n\r\nThe ill-humor of the señora increased every time the captain shouted\r\n“Port,” “Starboard” to the sailors, who then hastily seized their poles\r\nand thrust them against the banks, thus with the strength of their legs\r\nand shoulders preventing the steamer from shoving its hull ashore at\r\nthat particular point. Seen under these circumstances the Ship of State\r\nmight be said to have been converted from a tortoise into a crab every\r\ntime any danger threatened.\r\n\r\n“But, captain, why don’t your stupid steersmen go in that direction?”\r\nasked the lady with great indignation.\r\n\r\n“Because it’s very shallow in the other, señora,” answered the captain,\r\ndeliberately, slowly winking one eye, a little habit which he had\r\ncultivated as if to say to his words on their way out, “Slowly,\r\nslowly!”\r\n\r\n“Half speed! Botheration, half speed!” protested Doña Victorina\r\ndisdainfully. “Why not full?”\r\n\r\n“Because we should then be traveling over those ricefields, señora,”\r\nreplied the imperturbable captain, pursing his lips to indicate the\r\ncultivated fields and indulging in two circumspect winks.\r\n\r\nThis Doña Victorina was well known in the country for her caprices and\r\nextravagances. She was often seen in society, where she was tolerated\r\nwhenever she appeared in the company of her niece, Paulita Gomez, a\r\nvery beautiful and wealthy orphan, to whom she was a kind of guardian.\r\nAt a rather advanced age she had married a poor wretch named Don\r\nTiburcio de Espadaña, and at the time we now see her, carried upon\r\nherself fifteen years of wedded life, false frizzes, and a\r\nhalf-European costume—for her whole ambition had been to Europeanize\r\nherself, with the result that from the ill-omened day of her wedding\r\nshe had gradually, thanks to her criminal attempts, succeeded in so\r\ntransforming herself that at the present time Quatrefages and Virchow\r\ntogether could not have told where to classify her among the known\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nHer husband, who had borne all her impositions with the resignation of\r\na fakir through so many years of married life, at last on one luckless\r\nday had had his bad half-hour and administered to her a superb whack\r\nwith his crutch. The surprise of Madam Job at such an inconsistency of\r\ncharacter made her insensible to the immediate effects, and only after\r\nshe had recovered from her astonishment and her husband had fled did\r\nshe take notice of the pain, then remaining in bed for several days, to\r\nthe great delight of Paulita, who was very fond of joking and laughing\r\nat her aunt. As for her husband, horrified at the impiety of what\r\nappeared to him to be a terrific parricide, he took to flight, pursued\r\nby the matrimonial furies (two curs and a parrot), with all the speed\r\nhis lameness permitted, climbed into the first carriage he encountered,\r\njumped into the first banka he saw on the river, and, a Philippine\r\nUlysses, began to wander from town to town, from province to province,\r\nfrom island to island, pursued and persecuted by his bespectacled\r\nCalypso, who bored every one that had the misfortune to travel in her\r\ncompany. She had received a report of his being in the province of La\r\nLaguna, concealed in one of the towns, so thither she was bound to\r\nseduce him back with her dyed frizzes.\r\n\r\nHer fellow travelers had taken measures of defense by keeping up among\r\nthemselves a lively conversation on any topic whatsoever. At that\r\nmoment the windings and turnings of the river led them to talk about\r\nstraightening the channel and, as a matter of course, about the port\r\nworks. Ben-Zayb, the journalist with the countenance of a friar, was\r\ndisputing with a young friar who in turn had the countenance of an\r\nartilleryman. Both were shouting, gesticulating, waving their arms,\r\nspreading out their hands, stamping their feet, talking of levels,\r\nfish-corrals, the San Mateo River, [2] of cascos, of Indians, and so\r\non, to the great satisfaction of their listeners and the undisguised\r\ndisgust of an elderly Franciscan, remarkably thin and withered, and a\r\nhandsome Dominican about whose lips flitted constantly a scornful\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nThe thin Franciscan, understanding the Dominican’s smile, decided to\r\nintervene and stop the argument. He was undoubtedly respected, for with\r\na wave of his hand he cut short the speech of both at the moment when\r\nthe friar-artilleryman was talking about experience and the\r\njournalist-friar about scientists.\r\n\r\n“Scientists, Ben-Zayb—do you know what they are?” asked the Franciscan\r\nin a hollow voice, scarcely stirring in his seat and making only a\r\nfaint gesture with his skinny hand. “Here you have in the province a\r\nbridge, constructed by a brother of ours, which was not completed\r\nbecause the scientists, relying on their theories, condemned it as weak\r\nand scarcely safe—yet look, it is the bridge that has withstood all the\r\nfloods and earthquakes!” [3]\r\n\r\n“That’s it, puñales, that very thing, that was exactly what I was going\r\nto say!” exclaimed the friar-artilleryman, thumping his fists down on\r\nthe arms of his bamboo chair. “That’s it, that bridge and the\r\nscientists! That was just what I was going to mention, Padre\r\nSalvi—puñales!”\r\n\r\nBen-Zayb remained silent, half smiling, either out of respect or\r\nbecause he really did not know what to reply, and yet his was the only\r\nthinking head in the Philippines! Padre Irene nodded his approval as he\r\nrubbed his long nose.\r\n\r\nPadre Salvi, the thin and withered cleric, appeared to be satisfied\r\nwith such submissiveness and went on in the midst of the silence: “But\r\nthis does not mean that you may not be as near right as Padre Camorra”\r\n(the friar-artilleryman). “The trouble is in the lake—”\r\n\r\n“The fact is there isn’t a single decent lake in this country,”\r\ninterrupted Doña Victorina, highly indignant, and getting ready for a\r\nreturn to the assault upon the citadel.\r\n\r\nThe besieged gazed at one another in terror, but with the promptitude\r\nof a general, the jeweler Simoun rushed in to the rescue. “The remedy\r\nis very simple,” he said in a strange accent, a mixture of English and\r\nSouth American. “And I really don’t understand why it hasn’t occurred\r\nto somebody.”\r\n\r\nAll turned to give him careful attention, even the Dominican. The\r\njeweler was a tall, meager, nervous man, very dark, dressed in the\r\nEnglish fashion and wearing a pith helmet. Remarkable about him was his\r\nlong white hair contrasted with a sparse black beard, indicating a\r\nmestizo origin. To avoid the glare of the sun he wore constantly a pair\r\nof enormous blue goggles, which completely hid his eyes and a portion\r\nof his cheeks, thus giving him the aspect of a blind or weak-sighted\r\nperson. He was standing with his legs apart as if to maintain his\r\nbalance, with his hands thrust into the pockets of his coat.\r\n\r\n“The remedy is very simple,” he repeated, “and wouldn’t cost a cuarto.”\r\n\r\nThe attention now redoubled, for it was whispered in Manila that this\r\nman controlled the Captain-General, and all saw the remedy in process\r\nof execution. Even Don Custodio himself turned to listen.\r\n\r\n“Dig a canal straight from the source to the mouth of the river,\r\npassing through Manila; that is, make a new river-channel and fill up\r\nthe old Pasig. That would save land, shorten communication, and prevent\r\nthe formation of sandbars.”\r\n\r\nThe project left all his hearers astounded, accustomed as they were to\r\npalliative measures.\r\n\r\n“It’s a Yankee plan!” observed Ben-Zayb, to ingratiate himself with\r\nSimoun, who had spent a long time in North America.\r\n\r\nAll considered the plan wonderful and so indicated by the movements of\r\ntheir heads. Only Don Custodio, the liberal Don Custodio, owing to his\r\nindependent position and his high offices, thought it his duty to\r\nattack a project that did not emanate from himself—that was a\r\nusurpation! He coughed, stroked the ends of his mustache, and with a\r\nvoice as important as though he were at a formal session of the\r\nAyuntamiento, said, “Excuse me, Señor Simoun, my respected friend, if I\r\nshould say that I am not of your opinion. It would cost a great deal of\r\nmoney and might perhaps destroy some towns.”\r\n\r\n“Then destroy them!” rejoined Simoun coldly.\r\n\r\n“And the money to pay the laborers?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t pay them! Use the prisoners and convicts!”\r\n\r\n“But there aren’t enough, Señor Simoun!”\r\n\r\n“Then, if there aren’t enough, let all the villagers, the old men, the\r\nyouths, the boys, work. Instead of the fifteen days of obligatory\r\nservice, let them work three, four, five months for the State, with the\r\nadditional obligation that each one provide his own food and tools.”\r\n\r\nThe startled Don Custodio turned his head to see if there was any\r\nIndian within ear-shot, but fortunately those nearby were rustics, and\r\nthe two helmsmen seemed to be very much occupied with the windings of\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\n“But, Señor Simoun—”\r\n\r\n“Don’t fool yourself, Don Custodio,” continued Simoun dryly, “only in\r\nthis way are great enterprises carried out with small means. Thus were\r\nconstructed the Pyramids, Lake Moeris, and the Colosseum in Rome.\r\nEntire provinces came in from the desert, bringing their tubers to feed\r\non. Old men, youths, and boys labored in transporting stones, hewing\r\nthem, and carrying them on their shoulders under the direction of the\r\nofficial lash, and afterwards, the survivors returned to their homes or\r\nperished in the sands of the desert. Then came other provinces, then\r\nothers, succeeding one another in the work during years. Thus the task\r\nwas finished, and now we admire them, we travel, we go to Egypt and to\r\nHome, we extol the Pharaohs and the Antonines. Don’t fool yourself—the\r\ndead remain dead, and might only is considered right by posterity.”\r\n\r\n“But, Señor Simoun, such measures might provoke uprisings,” objected\r\nDon Custodio, rather uneasy over the turn the affair had taken.\r\n\r\n“Uprisings, ha, ha! Did the Egyptian people ever rebel, I wonder? Did\r\nthe Jewish prisoners rebel against the pious Titus? Man, I thought you\r\nwere better informed in history!”\r\n\r\nClearly Simoun was either very presumptuous or disregarded\r\nconventionalities! To say to Don Custodio’s face that he did not know\r\nhistory! It was enough to make any one lose his temper! So it seemed,\r\nfor Don Custodio forgot himself and retorted, “But the fact is that\r\nyou’re not among Egyptians or Jews!”\r\n\r\n“And these people have rebelled more than once,” added the Dominican,\r\nsomewhat timidly. “In the times when they were forced to transport\r\nheavy timbers for the construction of ships, if it hadn’t been for the\r\nclerics—”\r\n\r\n“Those times are far away,” answered Simoun, with a laugh even drier\r\nthan usual. “These islands will never again rebel, no matter how much\r\nwork and taxes they have. Haven’t you lauded to me, Padre Salvi,” he\r\nadded, turning to the Franciscan, “the house and hospital at Los Baños,\r\nwhere his Excellency is at present?”\r\n\r\nPadre Salvi gave a nod and looked up, evading the question.\r\n\r\n“Well, didn’t you tell me that both buildings were constructed by\r\nforcing the people to work on them under the whip of a lay-brother?\r\nPerhaps that wonderful bridge was built in the same way. Now tell me,\r\ndid these people rebel?”\r\n\r\n“The fact is—they have rebelled before,” replied the Dominican, “and ab\r\nactu ad posse valet illatio!”\r\n\r\n“No, no, nothing of the kind,” continued Simoun, starting down a\r\nhatchway to the cabin. “What’s said, is said! And you, Padre Sibyla,\r\ndon’t talk either Latin or nonsense. What are you friars good for if\r\nthe people can rebel?”\r\n\r\nTaking no notice of the replies and protests, Simoun descended the\r\nsmall companionway that led below, repeating disdainfully, “Bosh,\r\nbosh!”\r\n\r\nPadre Sibyla turned pale; this was the first time that he, Vice-Rector\r\nof the University, had ever been credited with nonsense. Don Custodio\r\nturned green; at no meeting in which he had ever found himself had he\r\nencountered such an adversary.\r\n\r\n“An American mulatto!” he fumed.\r\n\r\n“A British Indian,” observed Ben-Zayb in a low tone.\r\n\r\n“An American, I tell you, and shouldn’t I know?” retorted Don Custodio\r\nin ill-humor. “His Excellency has told me so. He’s a jeweler whom the\r\nlatter knew in Havana, and, as I suspect, the one who got him\r\nadvancement by lending him money. So to repay him he has had him come\r\nhere to let him have a chance and increase his fortune by selling\r\ndiamonds—imitations, who knows? And he’s so ungrateful, that, after\r\ngetting money from the Indians, he wishes—huh!” The sentence was\r\nconcluded by a significant wave of the hand.\r\n\r\nNo one dared to join in this diatribe. Don Custodio could discredit\r\nhimself with his Excellency, if he wished, but neither Ben-Zayb, nor\r\nPadre Irene, nor Padre Salvi, nor the offended Padre Sibyla had any\r\nconfidence in the discretion of the others.\r\n\r\n“The fact is that this man, being an American, thinks no doubt that we\r\nare dealing with the redskins. To talk of these matters on a steamer!\r\nCompel, force the people! And he’s the very person who advised the\r\nexpedition to the Carolines and the campaign in Mindanao, which is\r\ngoing to bring us to disgraceful ruin. He’s the one who has offered to\r\nsuperintend the building of the cruiser, and I say, what does a\r\njeweler, no matter how rich and learned he may be, know about naval\r\nconstruction?”\r\n\r\nAll this was spoken by Don Custodio in a guttural tone to his neighbor\r\nBen-Zayb, while he gesticulated, shrugged his shoulders, and from time\r\nto time with his looks consulted the others, who were nodding their\r\nheads ambiguously. The Canon Irene indulged in a rather equivocal\r\nsmile, which he half hid with his hand as he rubbed his nose.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, Ben-Zayb,” continued Don Custodio, slapping the journalist\r\non the arm, “all the trouble comes from not consulting the old-timers\r\nhere. A project in fine words, and especially with a big appropriation,\r\nwith an appropriation in round numbers, dazzles, meets with acceptance\r\nat once, for this!” Here, in further explanation, he rubbed the tip of\r\nhis thumb against his middle and forefinger. [4]\r\n\r\n“There’s something in that, there’s something in that,” Ben-Zayb\r\nthought it his duty to remark, since in his capacity of journalist he\r\nhad to be informed about everything.\r\n\r\n“Now look here, before the port works I presented a project, original,\r\nsimple, useful, economical, and practicable, for clearing away the bar\r\nin the lake, and it hasn’t been accepted because there wasn’t any of\r\nthat in it.” He repeated the movement of his fingers, shrugged his\r\nshoulders, and gazed at the others as though to say, “Have you ever\r\nheard of such a misfortune?”\r\n\r\n“May we know what it was?” asked several, drawing nearer and giving him\r\ntheir attention. The projects of Don Custodio were as renowned as\r\nquacks’ specifics.\r\n\r\nDon Custodio was on the point of refusing to explain it from resentment\r\nat not having found any supporters in his diatribe against Simoun.\r\n“When there’s no danger, you want me to talk, eh? And when there is,\r\nyou keep quiet!” he was going to say, but that would cause the loss of\r\na good opportunity, and his project, now that it could not be carried\r\nout, might at least be known and admired.\r\n\r\nAfter blowing out two or three puffs of smoke, coughing, and spitting\r\nthrough a scupper, he slapped Ben-Zayb on the thigh and asked, “You’ve\r\nseen ducks?”\r\n\r\n“I rather think so—we’ve hunted them on the lake,” answered the\r\nsurprised journalist.\r\n\r\n“No, I’m not talking about wild ducks, I’m talking of the domestic\r\nones, of those that are raised in Pateros and Pasig. Do you know what\r\nthey feed on?”\r\n\r\nBen-Zayb, the only thinking head, did not know—he was not engaged in\r\nthat business.\r\n\r\n“On snails, man, on snails!” exclaimed Padre Camorra. “One doesn’t have\r\nto be an Indian to know that; it’s sufficient to have eyes!”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so, on snails!” repeated Don Custodio, flourishing his\r\nforefinger. “And do you know where they get them?”\r\n\r\nAgain the thinking head did not know.\r\n\r\n“Well, if you had been in the country as many years as I have, you\r\nwould know that they fish them out of the bar itself, where they\r\nabound, mixed with the sand.”\r\n\r\n“Then your project?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m coming to that. My idea was to compel all the towns round\r\nabout, near the bar, to raise ducks, and you’ll see how they, all by\r\nthemselves, will deepen the channel by fishing for the snails—no more\r\nand no less, no more and no less!”\r\n\r\nHere Don Custodio extended his arms and gazed triumphantly at the\r\nstupefaction of his hearers—to none of them had occurred such an\r\noriginal idea.\r\n\r\n“Will you allow me to write an article about that?” asked Ben-Zayb. “In\r\nthis country there is so little thinking done—”\r\n\r\n“But, Don Custodio,” exclaimed Doña Victorina with smirks and grimaces,\r\n“if everybody takes to raising ducks the balot [5] eggs will become\r\nabundant. Ugh, how nasty! Rather, let the bar close up entirely!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nON THE LOWER DECK\r\n\r\n\r\nThere, below, other scenes were being enacted. Seated on benches or\r\nsmall wooden stools among valises, boxes, and baskets, a few feet from\r\nthe engines, in the heat of the boilers, amid the human smells and the\r\npestilential odor of oil, were to be seen the great majority of the\r\npassengers. Some were silently gazing at the changing scenes along the\r\nbanks, others were playing cards or conversing in the midst of the\r\nscraping of shovels, the roar of the engine, the hiss of escaping\r\nsteam, the swash of disturbed waters, and the shrieks of the whistle.\r\nIn one corner, heaped up like corpses, slept, or tried to sleep, a\r\nnumber of Chinese pedlers, seasick, pale, frothing through half-opened\r\nlips, and bathed in their copious perspiration. Only a few youths,\r\nstudents for the most part, easily recognizable from their white\r\ngarments and their confident bearing, made bold to move about from\r\nstern to bow, leaping over baskets and boxes, happy in the prospect of\r\nthe approaching vacation. Now they commented on the movements of the\r\nengines, endeavoring to recall forgotten notions of physics, now they\r\nsurrounded the young schoolgirl or the red-lipped buyera with her\r\ncollar of sampaguitas, whispering into their ears words that made them\r\nsmile and cover their faces with their fans.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, two of them, instead of engaging in these fleeting\r\ngallantries, stood in the bow talking with a man, advanced in years,\r\nbut still vigorous and erect. Both these youths seemed to be well known\r\nand respected, to judge from the deference shown them by their fellow\r\npassengers. The elder, who was dressed in complete black, was the\r\nmedical student, Basilio, famous for his successful cures and\r\nextraordinary treatments, while the other, taller and more robust,\r\nalthough much younger, was Isagani, one of the poets, or at least\r\nrimesters, who that year came from the Ateneo, [6] a curious character,\r\nordinarily quite taciturn and uncommunicative. The man talking with\r\nthem was the rich Capitan Basilio, who was returning from a business\r\ntrip to Manila.\r\n\r\n“Capitan Tiago is getting along about the same as usual, yes, sir,”\r\nsaid the student Basilio, shaking his head. “He won’t submit to any\r\ntreatment. At the advice of a certain person he is sending me to San\r\nDiego under the pretext of looking after his property, but in reality\r\nso that he may be left to smoke his opium with complete liberty.”\r\n\r\nWhen the student said a certain person, he really meant Padre Irene, a\r\ngreat friend and adviser of Capitan Tiago in his last days.\r\n\r\n“Opium is one of the plagues of modern times,” replied the capitan with\r\nthe disdain and indignation of a Roman senator. “The ancients knew\r\nabout it but never abused it. While the addiction to classical studies\r\nlasted—mark this well, young men—opium was used solely as a medicine;\r\nand besides, tell me who smoke it the most?—Chinamen, Chinamen who\r\ndon’t understand a word of Latin! Ah, if Capitan Tiago had only devoted\r\nhimself to Cicero—” Here the most classical disgust painted itself on\r\nhis carefully-shaven Epicurean face. Isagani regarded him with\r\nattention: that gentleman was suffering from nostalgia for antiquity.\r\n\r\n“But to get back to this academy of Castilian,” Capitan Basilio\r\ncontinued, “I assure you, gentlemen, that you won’t materialize it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, from day to day we’re expecting the permit,” replied\r\nIsagani. “Padre Irene, whom you may have noticed above, and to whom\r\nwe’ve presented a team of bays, has promised it to us. He’s on his way\r\nnow to confer with the General.”\r\n\r\n“That doesn’t matter. Padre Sibyla is opposed to it.”\r\n\r\n“Let him oppose it! That’s why he’s here on the steamer, in order to—at\r\nLos Baños before the General.”\r\n\r\nAnd the student Basilio filled out his meaning by going through the\r\npantomime of striking his fists together.\r\n\r\n“That’s understood,” observed Capitan Basilio, smiling. “But even\r\nthough you get the permit, where’ll you get the funds?”\r\n\r\n“We have them, sir. Each student has contributed a real.”\r\n\r\n“But what about the professors?”\r\n\r\n“We have them: half Filipinos and half Peninsulars.” [7]\r\n\r\n“And the house?”\r\n\r\n“Makaraig, the wealthy Makaraig, has offered one of his.”\r\n\r\nCapitan Basilio had to give in; these young men had everything\r\narranged.\r\n\r\n“For the rest,” he said with a shrug of his shoulders, “it’s not\r\naltogether bad, it’s not a bad idea, and now that you can’t know Latin\r\nat least you may know Castilian. Here you have another instance,\r\nnamesake, of how we are going backwards. In our times we learned Latin\r\nbecause our books were in Latin; now you study Latin a little but have\r\nno Latin books. On the other hand, your books are in Castilian and that\r\nlanguage is not taught—aetas parentum pejor avis tulit nos nequiores!\r\nas Horace said.” With this quotation he moved away majestically, like a\r\nRoman emperor.\r\n\r\nThe youths smiled at each other. “These men of the past,” remarked\r\nIsagani, “find obstacles for everything. Propose a thing to them and\r\ninstead of seeing its advantages they only fix their attention on the\r\ndifficulties. They want everything to come smooth and round as a\r\nbilliard ball.”\r\n\r\n“He’s right at home with your uncle,” observed Basilio.\r\n\r\n“They talk of past times. But listen—speaking of uncles, what does\r\nyours say about Paulita?”\r\n\r\nIsagani blushed. “He preached me a sermon about the choosing of a wife.\r\nI answered him that there wasn’t in Manila another like her—beautiful,\r\nwell-bred, an orphan—”\r\n\r\n“Very wealthy, elegant, charming, with no defect other than a\r\nridiculous aunt,” added Basilio, at which both smiled.\r\n\r\n“In regard to the aunt, do you know that she has charged me to look for\r\nher husband?”\r\n\r\n“Doña Victorina? And you’ve promised, in order to keep your\r\nsweetheart.”\r\n\r\n“Naturally! But the fact is that her husband is actually hidden—in my\r\nuncle’s house!”\r\n\r\nBoth burst into a laugh at this, while Isagani continued: “That’s why\r\nmy uncle, being a conscientious man, won’t go on the upper deck,\r\nfearful that Doña Victorina will ask him about Don Tiburcio. Just\r\nimagine, when Doña Victorina learned that I was a steerage passenger\r\nshe gazed at me with a disdain that—”\r\n\r\nAt that moment Simoun came down and, catching sight of the two young\r\nmen, greeted Basilio in a patronizing tone: “Hello, Don Basilio, you’re\r\noff for the vacation? Is the gentleman a townsman of yours?”\r\n\r\nBasilio introduced Isagani with the remark that he was not a townsman,\r\nbut that their homes were not very far apart. Isagani lived on the\r\nseashore of the opposite coast. Simoun examined him with such marked\r\nattention that he was annoyed, turned squarely around, and faced the\r\njeweler with a provoking stare.\r\n\r\n“Well, what is the province like?” the latter asked, turning again to\r\nBasilio.\r\n\r\n“Why, aren’t you familiar with it?”\r\n\r\n“How the devil am I to know it when I’ve never set foot in it? I’ve\r\nbeen told that it’s very poor and doesn’t buy jewels.”\r\n\r\n“We don’t buy jewels, because we don’t need them,” rejoined Isagani\r\ndryly, piqued in his provincial pride.\r\n\r\nA smile played over Simoun’s pallid lips. “Don’t be offended, young\r\nman,” he replied. “I had no bad intentions, but as I’ve been assured\r\nthat nearly all the money is in the hands of the native priests, I said\r\nto myself: the friars are dying for curacies and the Franciscans are\r\nsatisfied with the poorest, so when they give them up to the native\r\npriests the truth must be that the king’s profile is unknown there. But\r\nenough of that! Come and have a beer with me and we’ll drink to the\r\nprosperity of your province.”\r\n\r\nThe youths thanked him, but declined the offer.\r\n\r\n“You do wrong,” Simoun said to them, visibly taken aback. “Beer is a\r\ngood thing, and I heard Padre Camorra say this morning that the lack of\r\nenergy noticeable in this country is due to the great amount of water\r\nthe inhabitants drink.”\r\n\r\nIsagani was almost as tall as the jeweler, and at this he drew himself\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“Then tell Padre Camorra,” Basilio hastened to say, while he nudged\r\nIsagani slyly, “tell him that if he would drink water instead of wine\r\nor beer, perhaps we might all be the gainers and he would not give rise\r\nto so much talk.”\r\n\r\n“And tell him, also,” added Isagani, paying no attention to his\r\nfriend’s nudges, “that water is very mild and can be drunk, but that it\r\ndrowns out the wine and beer and puts out the fire, that heated it\r\nbecomes steam, and that ruffled it is the ocean, that it once destroyed\r\nmankind and made the earth tremble to its foundations!” [8]\r\n\r\nSimoun raised his head. Although his looks could not be read through\r\nthe blue goggles, on the rest of his face surprise might be seen.\r\n“Rather a good answer,” he said. “But I fear that he might get\r\nfacetious and ask me when the water will be converted into steam and\r\nwhen into an ocean. Padre Camorra is rather incredulous and is a great\r\nwag.”\r\n\r\n“When the fire heats it, when the rivulets that are now scattered\r\nthrough the steep valleys, forced by fatality, rush together in the\r\nabyss that men are digging,” replied Isagani.\r\n\r\n“No, Señor Simoun,” interposed Basilio, changing to a jesting tone,\r\n“rather keep in mind the verses of my friend Isagani himself:\r\n\r\n\r\n       ‘Fire you, you say, and water we,\r\n        Then as you wish, so let it be;\r\n        But let us live in peace and right,\r\n        Nor shall the fire e’er see us fight;\r\n        So joined by wisdom’s glowing flame,\r\n        That without anger, hate, or blame,\r\n        We form the steam, the fifth element,\r\n        Progress and light, life and movement.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Utopia, Utopia!” responded Simoun dryly. “The engine is about to\r\nmeet—in the meantime, I’ll drink my beer.” So, without any word of\r\nexcuse, he left the two friends.\r\n\r\n“But what’s the matter with you today that you’re so quarrelsome?”\r\nasked Basilio.\r\n\r\n“Nothing. I don’t know why, but that man fills me with horror, fear\r\nalmost.”\r\n\r\n“I was nudging you with my elbow. Don’t you know that he’s called the\r\nBrown Cardinal?”\r\n\r\n“The Brown Cardinal?”\r\n\r\n“Or Black Eminence, as you wish.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand.”\r\n\r\n“Richelieu had a Capuchin adviser who was called the Gray Eminence;\r\nwell, that’s what this man is to the General.”\r\n\r\n“Really?”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I’ve heard from a certain person,—who always speaks ill of\r\nhim behind his back and flatters him to his face.”\r\n\r\n“Does he also visit Capitan Tiago?”\r\n\r\n“From the first day after his arrival, and I’m sure that a certain\r\nperson looks upon him as a rival—in the inheritance. I believe that\r\nhe’s going to see the General about the question of instruction in\r\nCastilian.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment Isagani was called away by a servant to his uncle.\r\n\r\nOn one of the benches at the stern, huddled in among the other\r\npassengers, sat a native priest gazing at the landscapes that were\r\nsuccessively unfolded to his view. His neighbors made room for him, the\r\nmen on passing taking off their hats, and the gamblers not daring to\r\nset their table near where he was. He said little, but neither smoked\r\nnor assumed arrogant airs, nor did he disdain to mingle with the other\r\nmen, returning the salutes with courtesy and affability as if he felt\r\nmuch honored and very grateful. Although advanced in years, with hair\r\nalmost completely gray, he appeared to be in vigorous health, and even\r\nwhen seated held his body straight and his head erect, but without\r\npride or arrogance. He differed from the ordinary native priests, few\r\nenough indeed, who at that period served merely as coadjutors or\r\nadministered some curacies temporarily, in a certain self-possession\r\nand gravity, like one who was conscious of his personal dignity and the\r\nsacredness of his office. A superficial examination of his appearance,\r\nif not his white hair, revealed at once that he belonged to another\r\nepoch, another generation, when the better young men were not afraid to\r\nrisk their dignity by becoming priests, when the native clergy looked\r\nany friar at all in the face, and when their class, not yet degraded\r\nand vilified, called for free men and not slaves, superior\r\nintelligences and not servile wills. In his sad and serious features\r\nwas to be read the serenity of a soul fortified by study and\r\nmeditation, perhaps tried out by deep moral suffering. This priest was\r\nPadre Florentino, Isagani’s uncle, and his story is easily told.\r\n\r\nScion of a wealthy and influential family of Manila, of agreeable\r\nappearance and cheerful disposition, suited to shine in the world, he\r\nhad never felt any call to the sacerdotal profession, but by reason of\r\nsome promises or vows, his mother, after not a few struggles and\r\nviolent disputes, compelled him to enter the seminary. She was a great\r\nfriend of the Archbishop, had a will of iron, and was as inexorable as\r\nis every devout woman who believes that she is interpreting the will of\r\nGod. Vainly the young Florentine offered resistance, vainly he begged,\r\nvainly he pleaded his love affairs, even provoking scandals: priest he\r\nhad to become at twenty-five years of age, and priest he became. The\r\nArchbishop ordained him, his first mass was celebrated with great pomp,\r\nthree days were given over to feasting, and his mother died happy and\r\ncontent, leaving him all her fortune.\r\n\r\nBut in that struggle Florentine received a wound from which he never\r\nrecovered. Weeks before his first mass the woman he loved, in\r\ndesperation, married a nobody—a blow the rudest he had ever\r\nexperienced. He lost his moral energy, life became dull and\r\ninsupportable. If not his virtue and the respect for his office, that\r\nunfortunate love affair saved him from the depths into which the\r\nregular orders and secular clergymen both fall in the Philippines. He\r\ndevoted himself to his parishioners as a duty, and by inclination to\r\nthe natural sciences.\r\n\r\nWhen the events of seventy-two occurred, [9] he feared that the large\r\nincome his curacy yielded him would attract attention to him, so,\r\ndesiring peace above everything, he sought and secured his release,\r\nliving thereafter as a private individual on his patrimonial estate\r\nsituated on the Pacific coast. He there adopted his nephew, Isagani,\r\nwho was reported by the malicious to be his own son by his old\r\nsweetheart when she became a widow, and by the more serious and better\r\ninformed, the natural child of a cousin, a lady in Manila.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the steamer caught sight of the old priest and insisted\r\nthat he go to the upper deck, saying, “If you don’t do so, the friars\r\nwill think that you don’t want to associate with them.”\r\n\r\nPadre Florentino had no recourse but to accept, so he summoned his\r\nnephew in order to let him know where he was going, and to charge him\r\nnot to come near the upper deck while he was there. “If the captain\r\nnotices you, he’ll invite you also, and we should then be abusing his\r\nkindness.”\r\n\r\n“My uncle’s way!” thought Isagani. “All so that I won’t have any reason\r\nfor talking with Doña Victorina.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nLEGENDS\r\n\r\n                                   Ich weiss nicht was soil es bedeuten\r\n                                   Dass ich so traurig bin!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Padre Florentino joined the group above, the bad humor provoked by\r\nthe previous discussion had entirely disappeared. Perhaps their spirits\r\nhad been raised by the attractive houses of the town of Pasig, or the\r\nglasses of sherry they had drunk in preparation for the coming meal, or\r\nthe prospect of a good breakfast. Whatever the cause, the fact was that\r\nthey were all laughing and joking, even including the lean Franciscan,\r\nalthough he made little noise and his smiles looked like death-grins.\r\n\r\n“Evil times, evil times!” said Padre Sibyla with a laugh.\r\n\r\n“Get out, don’t say that, Vice-Rector!” responded the Canon Irene,\r\ngiving the other’s chair a shove. “In Hongkong you’re doing a fine\r\nbusiness, putting up every building that—ha, ha!”\r\n\r\n“Tut, tut!” was the reply; “you don’t see our expenses, and the tenants\r\non our estates are beginning to complain—”\r\n\r\n“Here, enough of complaints, puñales, else I’ll fall to weeping!” cried\r\nPadre Camorra gleefully. “We’re not complaining, and we haven’t either\r\nestates or banking-houses. You know that my Indians are beginning to\r\nhaggle over the fees and to flash schedules on me! Just look how they\r\ncite schedules to me now, and none other than those of the Archbishop\r\nBasilio Sancho, [10] as if from his time up to now prices had not\r\nrisen. Ha, ha, ha! Why should a baptism cost less than a chicken? But I\r\nplay the deaf man, collect what I can, and never complain. We’re not\r\navaricious, are we, Padre Salvi?”\r\n\r\nAt that moment Simoun’s head appeared above the hatchway.\r\n\r\n“Well, where’ve you been keeping yourself?” Don Custodio called to him,\r\nhaving forgotten all about their dispute. “You’re missing the prettiest\r\npart of the trip!”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw!” retorted Simoun, as he ascended, “I’ve seen so many rivers and\r\nlandscapes that I’m only interested in those that call up legends.”\r\n\r\n“As for legends, the Pasig has a few,” observed the captain, who did\r\nnot relish any depreciation of the river where he navigated and earned\r\nhis livelihood. “Here you have that of Malapad-na-bato, a rock sacred\r\nbefore the coming of the Spaniards as the abode of spirits. Afterwards,\r\nwhen the superstition had been dissipated and the rock profaned, it was\r\nconverted into a nest of tulisanes, since from its crest they easily\r\ncaptured the luckless bankas, which had to contend against both the\r\ncurrents and men. Later, in our time, in spite of human interference,\r\nthere are still told stories about wrecked bankas, and if on rounding\r\nit I didn’t steer with my six senses, I’d be smashed against its sides.\r\nThen you have another legend, that of Doña Jeronima’s cave, which Padre\r\nFlorentino can relate to you.”\r\n\r\n“Everybody knows that,” remarked Padre Sibyla disdainfully.\r\n\r\nBut neither Simoun, nor Ben-Zayb, nor Padre Irene, nor Padre Camorra\r\nknew it, so they begged for the story, some in jest and others from\r\ngenuine curiosity. The priest, adopting the tone of burlesque with\r\nwhich some had made their request, began like an old tutor relating a\r\nstory to children.\r\n\r\n“Once upon a time there was a student who had made a promise of\r\nmarriage to a young woman in his country, but it seems that he failed\r\nto remember her. She waited for him faithfully year after year, her\r\nyouth passed, she grew into middle age, and then one day she heard a\r\nreport that her old sweetheart was the Archbishop of Manila. Disguising\r\nherself as a man, she came round the Cape and presented herself before\r\nhis grace, demanding the fulfilment of his promise. What she asked was\r\nof course impossible, so the Archbishop ordered the preparation of the\r\ncave that you may have noticed with its entrance covered and decorated\r\nwith a curtain of vines. There she lived and died and there she is\r\nburied. The legend states that Doña Jeronima was so fat that she had to\r\nturn sidewise to get into it. Her fame as an enchantress sprung from\r\nher custom of throwing into the river the silver dishes which she used\r\nin the sumptuous banquets that were attended by crowds of gentlemen. A\r\nnet was spread under the water to hold the dishes and thus they were\r\ncleaned. It hasn’t been twenty years since the river washed the very\r\nentrance of the cave, but it has gradually been receding, just as the\r\nmemory of her is dying out among the people.”\r\n\r\n“A beautiful legend!” exclaimed Ben-Zayb. “I’m going to write an\r\narticle about it. It’s sentimental!”\r\n\r\nDoña Victorina thought of dwelling in such a cave and was about to say\r\nso, when Simoun took the floor instead.\r\n\r\n“But what’s your opinion about that, Padre Salvi?” he asked the\r\nFranciscan, who seemed to be absorbed in thought. “Doesn’t it seem to\r\nyou as though his Grace, instead of giving her a cave, ought to have\r\nplaced her in a nunnery—in St. Clara’s, for example? What do you say?”\r\n\r\nThere was a start of surprise on Padre Sibyla’s part to notice that\r\nPadre Salvi shuddered and looked askance at Simoun.\r\n\r\n“Because it’s not a very gallant act,” continued Simoun quite\r\nnaturally, “to give a rocky cliff as a home to one with whose hopes we\r\nhave trifled. It’s hardly religious to expose her thus to temptation,\r\nin a cave on the banks of a river—it smacks of nymphs and dryads. It\r\nwould have been more gallant, more pious, more romantic, more in\r\nkeeping with the customs of this country, to shut her up in St.\r\nClara’s, like a new Eloise, in order to visit and console her from time\r\nto time.”\r\n\r\n“I neither can nor should pass judgment upon the conduct of\r\narchbishops,” replied the Franciscan sourly.\r\n\r\n“But you, who are the ecclesiastical governor, acting in the place of\r\nour Archbishop, what would you do if such a case should arise?”\r\n\r\nPadre Salvi shrugged his shoulders and calmly responded, “It’s not\r\nworth while thinking about what can’t happen. But speaking of legends,\r\ndon’t overlook the most beautiful, since it is the truest: that of the\r\nmiracle of St. Nicholas, the ruins of whose church you may have\r\nnoticed. I’m going to relate it to Señor Simoun, as he probably hasn’t\r\nheard it. It seems that formerly the river, as well as the lake, was\r\ninfested with caymans, so huge and voracious that they attacked bankas\r\nand upset them with a slap of the tail. Our chronicles relate that one\r\nday an infidel Chinaman, who up to that time had refused to be\r\nconverted, was passing in front of the church, when suddenly the devil\r\npresented himself to him in the form of a cayman and upset the banka,\r\nin order to devour him and carry him off to hell. Inspired by God, the\r\nChinaman at that moment called upon St. Nicholas and instantly the\r\ncayman was changed into a stone. The old people say that in their time\r\nthe monster could easily be recognized in the pieces of stone that were\r\nleft, and, for my part, I can assure you that I have clearly made out\r\nthe head, to judge from which the monster must have been enormously\r\nlarge.”\r\n\r\n“Marvelous, a marvelous legend!” exclaimed Ben-Zayb. “It’s good for an\r\narticle—the description of the monster, the terror of the Chinaman, the\r\nwaters of the river, the bamboo brakes. Also, it’ll do for a study of\r\ncomparative religions; because, look you, an infidel Chinaman in great\r\ndistress invoked exactly the saint that he must know only by hearsay\r\nand in whom he did not believe. Here there’s no room for the proverb\r\nthat ‘a known evil is preferable to an unknown good.’ If I should find\r\nmyself in China and get caught in such a difficulty, I would invoke the\r\nobscurest saint in the calendar before Confucius or Buddha. Whether\r\nthis is due to the manifest superiority of Catholicism or to the\r\ninconsequential and illogical inconsistency in the brains of the yellow\r\nrace, a profound study of anthropology alone will be able to\r\nelucidate.”\r\n\r\nBen-Zayb had adopted the tone of a lecturer and was describing circles\r\nin the air with his forefinger, priding himself on his imagination,\r\nwhich from the most insignificant facts could deduce so many\r\napplications and inferences. But noticing that Simoun was preoccupied\r\nand thinking that he was pondering over what he, Ben-Zayb, had just\r\nsaid, he inquired what the jeweler was meditating about.\r\n\r\n“About two very important questions,” answered Simoun; “two questions\r\nthat you might add to your article. First, what may have become of the\r\ndevil on seeing himself suddenly confined within a stone? Did he\r\nescape? Did he stay there? Was he crushed? Second, if the petrified\r\nanimals that I have seen in various European museums may not have been\r\nthe victims of some antediluvian saint?”\r\n\r\nThe tone in which the jeweler spoke was so serious, while he rested his\r\nforehead on the tip of his forefinger in an attitude of deep\r\nmeditation, that Padre Camorra responded very gravely, “Who knows, who\r\nknows?”\r\n\r\n“Since we’re busy with legends and are now entering the lake,” remarked\r\nPadre Sibyla, “the captain must know many—”\r\n\r\nAt that moment the steamer crossed the bar and the panorama spread out\r\nbefore their eyes was so truly magnificent that all were impressed. In\r\nfront extended the beautiful lake bordered by green shores and blue\r\nmountains, like a huge mirror, framed in emeralds and sapphires,\r\nreflecting the sky in its glass. On the right were spread out the low\r\nshores, forming bays with graceful curves, and dim there in the\r\ndistance the crags of Sungay, while in the background rose Makiling,\r\nimposing and majestic, crowned with fleecy clouds. On the left lay\r\nTalim Island with its curious sweep of hills. A fresh breeze rippled\r\nover the wide plain of water.\r\n\r\n“By the way, captain,” said Ben-Zayb, turning around, “do you know in\r\nwhat part of the lake a certain Guevara, Navarra, or Ibarra, was\r\nkilled?”\r\n\r\nThe group looked toward the captain, with the exception of Simoun, who\r\nhad turned away his head as though to look for something on the shore.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes!” exclaimed Doña Victorina. “Where, captain? Did he leave any\r\ntracks in the water?”\r\n\r\nThe good captain winked several times, an indication that he was\r\nannoyed, but reading the request in the eyes of all, took a few steps\r\ntoward the bow and scanned the shore.\r\n\r\n“Look over there,” he said in a scarcely audible voice, after making\r\nsure that no strangers were near. “According to the officer who\r\nconducted the pursuit, Ibarra, upon finding himself surrounded, jumped\r\nout of his banka there near the Kinabutasan [11] and, swimming under\r\nwater, covered all that distance of more than two miles, saluted by\r\nbullets every time that he raised his head to breathe. Over yonder is\r\nwhere they lost track of him, and a little farther on near the shore\r\nthey discovered something like the color of blood. And now I think of\r\nit, it’s just thirteen years, day for day, since this happened.”\r\n\r\n“So that his corpse—” began Ben-Zayb.\r\n\r\n“Went to join his father’s,” replied Padre Sibyla. “Wasn’t he also\r\nanother filibuster, Padre Salvi?”\r\n\r\n“That’s what might be called cheap funerals, Padre Camorra, eh?”\r\nremarked Ben-Zayb.\r\n\r\n“I’ve always said that those who won’t pay for expensive funerals are\r\nfilibusters,” rejoined the person addressed, with a merry laugh.\r\n\r\n“But what’s the matter with you, Señor Simoun?” inquired Ben-Zayb,\r\nseeing that the jeweler was motionless and thoughtful. “Are you\r\nseasick—an old traveler like you? On such a drop of water as this!”\r\n\r\n“I want to tell you,” broke in the captain, who had come to hold all\r\nthose places in great affection, “that you can’t call this a drop of\r\nwater. It’s larger than any lake in Switzerland and all those in Spain\r\nput together. I’ve seen old sailors who got seasick here.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCABESANG TALES\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who have read the first part of this story will perhaps remember\r\nan old wood-cutter who lived in the depths of the forest. [12] Tandang\r\nSelo is still alive, and though his hair has turned completely white,\r\nhe yet preserves his good health. He no longer hunts or cuts firewood,\r\nfor his fortunes have improved and he works only at making brooms.\r\n\r\nHis son Tales (abbreviation of Telesforo) had worked at first on shares\r\non the lands of a capitalist, but later, having become the owner of two\r\ncarabaos and several hundred pesos, determined to work on his own\r\naccount, aided by his father, his wife, and his three children. So they\r\ncut down and cleared away some thick woods which were situated on the\r\nborders of the town and which they believed belonged to no one. During\r\nthe labors of cleaning and cultivating the new land, the whole family\r\nfell ill with malaria and the mother died, along with the eldest\r\ndaughter, Lucia, in the flower of her age. This, which was the natural\r\nconsequence of breaking up new soil infested with various kinds of\r\nbacteria, they attributed to the anger of the woodland spirit, so they\r\nwere resigned and went on with their labor, believing him pacified.\r\n\r\nBut when they began to harvest their first crop a religious\r\ncorporation, which owned land in the neighboring town, laid claim to\r\nthe fields, alleging that they fell within their boundaries, and to\r\nprove it they at once started to set up their marks. However, the\r\nadministrator of the religious order left to them, for humanity’s sake,\r\nthe usufruct of the land on condition that they pay a small sum\r\nannually—a mere bagatelle, twenty or thirty pesos. Tales, as peaceful a\r\nman as could be found, was as much opposed to lawsuits as any one and\r\nmore submissive to the friars than most people; so, in order not to\r\nsmash a palyok against a kawali (as he said, for to him the friars were\r\niron pots and he a clay jar), he had the weakness to yield to their\r\nclaim, remembering that he did not know Spanish and had no money to pay\r\nlawyers.\r\n\r\nBesides, Tandang Selo said to him, “Patience! You would spend more in\r\none year of litigation than in ten years of paying what the white\r\npadres demand. And perhaps they’ll pay you back in masses! Pretend that\r\nthose thirty pesos had been lost in gambling or had fallen into the\r\nwater and been swallowed by a cayman.”\r\n\r\nThe harvest was abundant and sold well, so Tales planned to build a\r\nwooden house in the barrio of Sagpang, of the town of Tiani, which\r\nadjoined San Diego.\r\n\r\nAnother year passed, bringing another good crop, and for this reason\r\nthe friars raised the rent to fifty pesos, which Tales paid in order\r\nnot to quarrel and because he expected to sell his sugar at a good\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n“Patience! Pretend that the cayman has grown some,” old Selo consoled\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThat year he at last saw his dream realized: to live in the barrio of\r\nSagpang in a wooden house. The father and grandfather then thought of\r\nproviding some education for the two children, especially the daughter\r\nJuliana, or Juli, as they called her, for she gave promise of being\r\naccomplished and beautiful. A boy who was a friend of the family,\r\nBasilio, was studying in Manila, and he was of as lowly origin as they.\r\n\r\nBut this dream seemed destined not to be realized. The first care the\r\ncommunity took when they saw the family prospering was to appoint as\r\ncabeza de barangay its most industrious member, which left only Tano,\r\nthe son, who was only fourteen years old. The father was therefore\r\ncalled Cabesang Tales and had to order a sack coat, buy a felt hat, and\r\nprepare to spend his money. In order to avoid any quarrel with the\r\ncurate or the government, he settled from his own pocket the shortages\r\nin the tax-lists, paying for those who had died or moved away, and he\r\nlost considerable time in making the collections and on his trips to\r\nthe capital.\r\n\r\n“Patience! Pretend that the cayman’s relatives have joined him,”\r\nadvised Tandang Selo, smiling placidly.\r\n\r\n“Next year you’ll put on a long skirt and go to Manila to study like\r\nthe young ladies of the town,” Cabesang Tales told his daughter every\r\ntime he heard her talking of Basilio’s progress.\r\n\r\nBut that next year did not come, and in its stead there was another\r\nincrease in the rent. Cabesang Tales became serious and scratched his\r\nhead. The clay jar was giving up all its rice to the iron pot.\r\n\r\nWhen the rent had risen to two hundred pesos, Tales was not content\r\nwith scratching his head and sighing; he murmured and protested. The\r\nfriar-administrator then told him that if he could not pay, some one\r\nelse would be assigned to cultivate that land—many who desired it had\r\noffered themselves.\r\n\r\nHe thought at first that the friar was joking, but the friar was\r\ntalking seriously, and indicated a servant of his to take possession of\r\nthe land. Poor Tales turned pale, he felt a buzzing in his ears, he saw\r\nin the red mist that rose before his eyes his wife and daughter,\r\npallid, emaciated, dying, victims of the intermittent fevers—then he\r\nsaw the thick forest converted into productive fields, he saw the\r\nstream of sweat watering its furrows, he saw himself plowing under the\r\nhot sun, bruising his feet against the stones and roots, while this\r\nfriar had been driving about in his carriage with the wretch who was to\r\nget the land following like a slave behind his master. No, a thousand\r\ntimes, no! First let the fields sink into the depths of the earth and\r\nbury them all! Who was this intruder that he should have any right to\r\nhis land? Had he brought from his own country a single handful of that\r\nsoil? Had he crooked a single one of his fingers to pull up the roots\r\nthat ran through it?\r\n\r\nExasperated by the threats of the friar, who tried to uphold his\r\nauthority at any cost in the presence of the other tenants, Cabesang\r\nTales rebelled and refused to pay a single cuarto, having ever before\r\nhimself that red mist, saying that he would give up his fields to the\r\nfirst man who could irrigate it with blood drawn from his own veins.\r\n\r\nOld Selo, on looking at his son’s face, did not dare to mention the\r\ncayman, but tried to calm him by talking of clay jars, reminding him\r\nthat the winner in a lawsuit was left without a shirt to his back.\r\n\r\n“We shall all be turned to clay, father, and without shirts we were\r\nborn,” was the reply.\r\n\r\nSo he resolutely refused to pay or to give up a single span of his land\r\nunless the friars should first prove the legality of their claim by\r\nexhibiting a title-deed of some kind. As they had none, a lawsuit\r\nfollowed, and Cabesang Tales entered into it, confiding that some at\r\nleast, if not all, were lovers of justice and respecters of the law.\r\n\r\n“I serve and have been serving the King with my money and my services,”\r\nhe said to those who remonstrated with him. “I’m asking for justice and\r\nhe is obliged to give it to me.”\r\n\r\nDrawn on by fatality, and as if he had put into play in the lawsuit the\r\nwhole future of himself and his children, he went on spending his\r\nsavings to pay lawyers, notaries, and solicitors, not to mention the\r\nofficials and clerks who exploited his ignorance and his needs. He\r\nmoved to and fro between the village and the capital, passed his days\r\nwithout eating and his nights without sleeping, while his talk was\r\nalways about briefs, exhibits, and appeals. There was then seen a\r\nstruggle such as was never before carried on under the skies of the\r\nPhilippines: that of a poor Indian, ignorant and friendless, confiding\r\nin the justness and righteousness of his cause, fighting against a\r\npowerful corporation before which Justice bowed her head, while the\r\njudges let fall the scales and surrendered the sword. He fought as\r\ntenaciously as the ant which bites when it knows that it is going to be\r\ncrushed, as does the fly which looks into space only through a pane of\r\nglass. Yet the clay jar defying the iron pot and smashing itself into a\r\nthousand pieces bad in it something impressive—it had the sublimeness\r\nof desperation!\r\n\r\nOn the days when his journeys left him free he patrolled his fields\r\narmed with a shotgun, saying that the tulisanes were hovering around\r\nand he had need of defending himself in order not to fall into their\r\nhands and thus lose his lawsuit. As if to improve his marksmanship, he\r\nshot at birds and fruits, even the butterflies, with such accurate aim\r\nthat the friar-administrator did not dare to go to Sagpang without an\r\nescort of civil-guards, while the friar’s hireling, who gazed from afar\r\nat the threatening figure of Tales wandering over the fields like a\r\nsentinel upon the walls, was terror stricken and refused to take the\r\nproperty away from him.\r\n\r\nBut the local judges and those at the capital, warned by the experience\r\nof one of their number who had been summarily dismissed, dared not give\r\nhim the decision, fearing their own dismissal. Yet they were not really\r\nbad men, those judges, they were upright and conscientious, good\r\ncitizens, excellent fathers, dutiful sons—and they were able to\r\nappreciate poor Tales’ situation better than Tales himself could. Many\r\nof them were versed in the scientific and historical basis of property,\r\nthey knew that the friars by their own statutes could not own property,\r\nbut they also knew that to come from far across the sea with an\r\nappointment secured with great difficulty, to undertake the duties of\r\nthe position with the best intentions, and now to lose it because an\r\nIndian fancied that justice had to be done on earth as in heaven—that\r\nsurely was an idea! They had their families and greater needs surely\r\nthan that Indian: one had a mother to provide for, and what duty is\r\nmore sacred than that of caring for a mother? Another had sisters, all\r\nof marriageable age; that other there had many little children who\r\nexpected their daily bread and who, like fledglings in a nest, would\r\nsurely die of hunger the day he was out of a job; even the very least\r\nof them had there, far away, a wife who would be in distress if the\r\nmonthly remittance failed. All these moral and conscientious judges\r\ntried everything in their power in the way of counsel, advising\r\nCabesang Tales to pay the rent demanded. But Tales, like all simple\r\nsouls, once he had seen what was just, went straight toward it. He\r\ndemanded proofs, documents, papers, title-deeds, but the friars had\r\nnone of these, resting their case on his concessions in the past.\r\n\r\nCabesang Tales’ constant reply was: “If every day I give alms to a\r\nbeggar to escape annoyance, who will oblige me to continue my gifts if\r\nhe abuses my generosity?”\r\n\r\nFrom this stand no one could draw him, nor were there any threats that\r\ncould intimidate him. In vain Governor M—— made a trip expressly to\r\ntalk to him and frighten him. His reply to it all was: “You may do what\r\nyou like, Mr. Governor, I’m ignorant and powerless. But I’ve cultivated\r\nthose fields, my wife and daughter died while helping me clear them,\r\nand I won’t give them up to any one but him who can do more with them\r\nthan I’ve done. Let him first irrigate them with his blood and bury in\r\nthem his wife and daughter!”\r\n\r\nThe upshot of this obstinacy was that the honorable judges gave the\r\ndecision to the friars, and everybody laughed at him, saying that\r\nlawsuits are not won by justice. But Cabesang Tales appealed, loaded\r\nhis shotgun, and patrolled his fields with deliberation.\r\n\r\nDuring this period his life seemed to be a wild dream. His son, Tano, a\r\nyouth as tall as his father and as good as his sister, was conscripted,\r\nbut he let the boy go rather than purchase a substitute.\r\n\r\n“I have to pay the lawyers,” he told his weeping daughter. “If I win\r\nthe case I’ll find a way to get him back, and if I lose it I won’t have\r\nany need for sons.”\r\n\r\nSo the son went away and nothing more was heard of him except that his\r\nhair had been cropped and that he slept under a cart. Six months later\r\nit was rumored that he had been seen embarking for the Carolines;\r\nanother report was that he had been seen in the uniform of the Civil\r\nGuard.\r\n\r\n“Tano in the Civil Guard! ’Susmariosep!” exclaimed several, clasping\r\ntheir hands. “Tano, who was so good and so honest! Requimternam!”\r\n\r\nThe grandfather went many days without speaking to the father, Juli\r\nfell sick, but Cabesang Tales did not shed a single tear, although for\r\ntwo days he never left the house, as if he feared the looks of reproach\r\nfrom the whole village or that he would be called the executioner of\r\nhis son. But on the third day he again sallied forth with his shotgun.\r\n\r\nMurderous intentions were attributed to him, and there were\r\nwell-meaning persons who whispered about that he had been heard to\r\nthreaten that he would bury the friar-administrator in the furrows of\r\nhis fields, whereat the friar was frightened at him in earnest. As a\r\nresult of this, there came a decree from the Captain-General forbidding\r\nthe use of firearms and ordering that they be taken up. Cabesang Tales\r\nhad to hand over his shotgun but he continued his rounds armed with a\r\nlong bolo.\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do with that bolo when the tulisanes have\r\nfirearms?” old Selo asked him.\r\n\r\n“I must watch my crops,” was the answer. “Every stalk of cane growing\r\nthere is one of my wife’s bones.”\r\n\r\nThe bolo was taken up on the pretext that it was too long. He then took\r\nhis father’s old ax and with it on his shoulder continued his sullen\r\nrounds.\r\n\r\nEvery time he left the house Tandang Selo and Juli trembled for his\r\nlife. The latter would get up from her loom, go to the window, pray,\r\nmake vows to the saints, and recite novenas. The grandfather was at\r\ntimes unable to finish the handle of a broom and talked of returning to\r\nthe forest—life in that house was unbearable.\r\n\r\nAt last their fears were realized. As the fields were some distance\r\nfrom the village, Cabesang Tales, in spite of his ax, fell into the\r\nhands of tulisanes who had revolvers and rifles. They told him that\r\nsince he had money to pay judges and lawyers he must have some also for\r\nthe outcasts and the hunted. They therefore demanded a ransom of five\r\nhundred pesos through the medium of a rustic, with the warning that if\r\nanything happened to their messenger, the captive would pay for it with\r\nhis life. Two days of grace were allowed.\r\n\r\nThis news threw the poor family into the wildest terror, which was\r\naugmented when they learned that the Civil Guard was going out in\r\npursuit of the bandits. In case of an encounter, the first victim would\r\nbe the captive—this they all knew. The old man was paralyzed, while the\r\npale and frightened daughter tried often to talk but could not. Still,\r\nanother thought more terrible, an idea more cruel, roused them from\r\ntheir stupor. The rustic sent by the tulisanes said that the band would\r\nprobably have to move on, and if they were slow in sending the ransom\r\nthe two days would elapse and Cabesang Tales would have his throat cut.\r\n\r\nThis drove those two beings to madness, weak and powerless as they\r\nwere. Tandang Selo got up, sat down, went outside, came back again,\r\nknowing not where to go, where to seek aid. Juli appealed to her\r\nimages, counted and recounted her money, but her two hundred pesos did\r\nnot increase or multiply. Soon she dressed herself, gathered together\r\nall her jewels, and asked the advice of her grandfather, if she should\r\ngo to see the gobernadorcillo, the judge, the notary, the lieutenant of\r\nthe Civil Guard. The old man said yes to everything, or when she said\r\nno, he too said no. At length came the neighbors, their relatives and\r\nfriends, some poorer than others, in their simplicity magnifying the\r\nfears. The most active of all was Sister Bali, a great panguinguera,\r\nwho had been to Manila to practise religious exercises in the nunnery\r\nof the Sodality.\r\n\r\nJuli was willing to sell all her jewels, except a locket set with\r\ndiamonds and emeralds which Basilio had given her, for this locket had\r\na history: a nun, the daughter of Capitan Tiago, had given it to a\r\nleper, who, in return for professional treatment, had made a present of\r\nit to Basilio. So she could not sell it without first consulting him.\r\n\r\nQuickly the shell-combs and earrings were sold, as well as Juli’s\r\nrosary, to their richest neighbor, and thus fifty pesos were added, but\r\ntwo hundred and fifty were still lacking. The locket might be pawned,\r\nbut Juli shook her head. A neighbor suggested that the house be sold\r\nand Tandang Selo approved the idea, satisfied to return to the forest\r\nand cut firewood as of old, but Sister Bali observed that this could\r\nnot be done because the owner was not present.\r\n\r\n“The judge’s wife once sold me her tapis for a peso, but her husband\r\nsaid that the sale did not hold because it hadn’t received his\r\napproval. Abá! He took back the tapis and she hasn’t returned the peso\r\nyet, but I don’t pay her when she wins at panguingui, abá! In that way\r\nI’ve collected twelve cuartos, and for that alone I’m going to play\r\nwith her. I can’t bear to have people fail to pay what they owe me,\r\nabá!”\r\n\r\nAnother neighbor was going to ask Sister Bali why then did not she\r\nsettle a little account with her, but the quick panguinguera suspected\r\nthis and added at once: “Do you know, Juli, what you can do? Borrow two\r\nhundred and fifty pesos on the house, payable when the lawsuit is won.”\r\n\r\nThis seemed to be the best proposition, so they decided to act upon it\r\nthat same day. Sister Bali offered to accompany her, and together they\r\nvisited the houses of all the rich folks in Tiani, but no one would\r\naccept the proposal. The case, they said, was already lost, and to show\r\nfavors to an enemy of the friars was to expose themselves to their\r\nvengeance. At last a pious woman took pity on the girl and lent the\r\nmoney on condition that Juli should remain with her as a servant until\r\nthe debt was paid. Juli would not have so very much to do: sew, pray,\r\naccompany her to mass, and fast for her now and then. The girl accepted\r\nwith tears in her eyes, received the money, and promised to enter her\r\nservice on the following day, Christmas.\r\n\r\nWhen the grandfather heard of that sale he fell to weeping like a\r\nchild. What, that granddaughter whom he had not allowed to walk in the\r\nsun lest her skin should be burned, Juli, she of the delicate fingers\r\nand rosy feet! What, that girl, the prettiest in the village and\r\nperhaps in the whole town, before whose window many gallants had vainly\r\npassed the night playing and singing! What, his only granddaughter, the\r\nsole joy of his fading eyes, she whom he had dreamed of seeing dressed\r\nin a long skirt, talking Spanish, and holding herself erect waving a\r\npainted fan like the daughters of the wealthy—she to become a servant,\r\nto be scolded and reprimanded, to ruin her fingers, to sleep anywhere,\r\nto rise in any manner whatsoever!\r\n\r\nSo the old grandfather wept and talked of hanging or starving himself\r\nto death. “If you go,” he declared, “I’m going back to the forest and\r\nwill never set foot in the town.”\r\n\r\nJuli soothed him by saying that it was necessary for her father to\r\nreturn, that the suit would be won, and they could then ransom her from\r\nher servitude.\r\n\r\nThe night was a sad one. Neither of the two could taste a bite and the\r\nold man refused to lie down, passing the whole night seated in a\r\ncorner, silent and motionless. Juli on her part tried to sleep, but for\r\na long time could not close her eyes. Somewhat relieved about her\r\nfather’s fate, she now thought of herself and fell to weeping, but\r\nstifled her sobs so that the old man might not hear them. The next day\r\nshe would be a servant, and it was the very day Basilio was accustomed\r\nto come from Manila with presents for her. Henceforward she would have\r\nto give up that love; Basilio, who was going to be a doctor, couldn’t\r\nmarry a pauper. In fancy she saw him going to the church in company\r\nwith the prettiest and richest girl in the town, both well-dressed,\r\nhappy and smiling, while she, Juli, followed her mistress, carrying\r\nnovenas, buyos, and the cuspidor. Here the girl felt a lump rise in her\r\nthroat, a sinking at her heart, and begged the Virgin to let her die\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nBut—said her conscience—he will at least know that I preferred to pawn\r\nmyself rather than the locket he gave me.\r\n\r\nThis thought consoled her a little and brought on empty dreams. Who\r\nknows but that a miracle might happen? She might find the two hundred\r\nand fifty pesos under the image of the Virgin—she had read of many\r\nsimilar miracles. The sun might not rise nor morning come, and\r\nmeanwhile the suit would be won. Her father might return, or Basilio\r\nput in his appearance, she might find a bag of gold in the garden, the\r\ntulisanes would send the bag of gold, the curate, Padre Camorra, who\r\nwas always teasing her, would come with the tulisanes. So her ideas\r\nbecame more and more confused, until at length, worn out by fatigue and\r\nsorrow, she went to sleep with dreams of her childhood in the depths of\r\nthe forest: she was bathing in the torrent along with her two brothers,\r\nthere were little fishes of all colors that let themselves be caught\r\nlike fools, and she became impatient because she found no pleasure in\r\ncatchnig such foolish little fishes! Basilio was under the water, but\r\nBasilio for some reason had the face of her brother Tano. Her new\r\nmistress was watching them from the bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nA COCHERO’S CHRISTMAS EVE\r\n\r\n\r\nBasilio reached San Diego just as the Christmas Eve procession was\r\npassing through the streets. He had been delayed on the road for\r\nseveral hours because the cochero, having forgotten his cedula, was\r\nheld up by the Civil Guard, had his memory jogged by a few blows from a\r\nrifle-butt, and afterwards was taken before the commandant. Now the\r\ncarromata was again detained to let the procession pass, while the\r\nabused cochero took off his hat reverently and recited a paternoster to\r\nthe first image that came along, which seemed to be that of a great\r\nsaint. It was the figure of an old man with an exceptionally long\r\nbeard, seated at the edge of a grave under a tree filled with all kinds\r\nof stuffed birds. A kalan with a clay jar, a mortar, and a kalikut for\r\nmashing buyo were his only utensils, as if to indicate that he lived on\r\nthe border of the tomb and was doing his cooking there. This was the\r\nMethuselah of the religious iconography of the Philippines; his\r\ncolleague and perhaps contemporary is called in Europe Santa Claus, and\r\nis still more smiling and agreeable.\r\n\r\n“In the time of the saints,” thought the cochero, “surely there were no\r\ncivil-guards, because one can’t live long on blows from rifle-butts.”\r\n\r\nBehind the great old man came the three Magian Kings on ponies that\r\nwere capering about, especially that of the negro Melchior, which\r\nseemed to be about to trample its companions.\r\n\r\n“No, there couldn’t have been any civil-guards,” decided the cochero,\r\nsecretly envying those fortunate times, “because if there had been,\r\nthat negro who is cutting up such capers beside those two\r\nSpaniards”—Gaspar and Balthazar—“would have gone to jail.”\r\n\r\nThen, observing that the negro wore a crown and was a king, like the\r\nother two, the Spaniards, his thoughts naturally turned to the king of\r\nthe Indians, and he sighed. “Do you know, sir,” he asked Basilio\r\nrespectfully, “if his right foot is loose yet?”\r\n\r\nBasilio had him repeat the question. “Whose right foot?”\r\n\r\n“The King’s!” whispered the cochero mysteriously.\r\n\r\n“What King’s?”\r\n\r\n“Our King’s, the King of the Indians.”\r\n\r\nBasilio smiled and shrugged his shoulders, while the cochero again\r\nsighed. The Indians in the country places preserve the legend that\r\ntheir king, imprisoned and chained in the cave of San Mateo, will come\r\nsome day to free them. Every hundredth year he breaks one of his\r\nchains, so that he now has his hands and his left foot loose—only the\r\nright foot remains bound. This king causes the earthquakes when he\r\nstruggles or stirs himself, and he is so strong that in shaking hands\r\nwith him it is necessary to extend to him a bone, which he crushes in\r\nhis grasp. For some unexplainable reason the Indians call him King\r\nBernardo, perhaps by confusing him with Bernardo del Carpio. [13]\r\n\r\n“When he gets his right foot loose,” muttered the cochero, stifling\r\nanother sigh, “I’ll give him my horses, and offer him my services even\r\nto death, for he’ll free us from the Civil Guard.” With a melancholy\r\ngaze he watched the Three Kings move on.\r\n\r\nThe boys came behind in two files, sad and serious as though they were\r\nthere under compulsion. They lighted their way, some with torches,\r\nothers with tapers, and others with paper lanterns on bamboo poles,\r\nwhile they recited the rosary at the top of their voices, as though\r\nquarreling with somebody. Afterwards came St. Joseph on a modest float,\r\nwith a look of sadness and resignation on his face, carrying his stalk\r\nof lilies, as he moved along between two civil-guards as though he were\r\na prisoner. This enabled the cochero to understand the expression on\r\nthe saint’s face, but whether the sight of the guards troubled him or\r\nhe had no great respect for a saint who would travel in such company,\r\nhe did not recite a single requiem.\r\n\r\nBehind St. Joseph came the girls bearing lights, their heads covered\r\nwith handkerchiefs knotted under their chins, also reciting the rosary,\r\nbut with less wrath than the boys. In their midst were to be seen\r\nseveral lads dragging along little rabbits made of Japanese paper,\r\nlighted by red candles, with their short paper tails erect. The lads\r\nbrought those toys into the procession to enliven the birth of the\r\nMessiah. The little animals, fat and round as eggs, seemed to be so\r\npleased that at times they would take a leap, lose their balance, fall,\r\nand catch fire. The owner would then hasten to extinguish such burning\r\nenthusiasm, puffing and blowing until he finally beat out the fire, and\r\nthen, seeing his toy destroyed, would fall to weeping. The cochero\r\nobserved with sadness that the race of little paper animals disappeared\r\neach year, as if they had been attacked by the pest like the living\r\nanimals. He, the abused Sinong, remembered his two magnificent horses,\r\nwhich, at the advice of the curate, he had caused to be blessed to save\r\nthem from plague, spending therefor ten pesos—for neither the\r\ngovernment nor the curates have found any better remedy for the\r\nepizootic—and they had died after all. Yet he consoled himself by\r\nremembering also that after the shower of holy water, the Latin phrases\r\nof the padre, and the ceremonies, the horses had become so vain and\r\nself-important that they would not even allow him, Sinong, a good\r\nChristian, to put them in harness, and he had not dared to whip them,\r\nbecause a tertiary sister had said that they were sanctified.\r\n\r\nThe procession was closed by the Virgin dressed as the Divine Shepherd,\r\nwith a pilgrim’s hat of wide brim and long plumes to indicate the\r\njourney to Jerusalem. That the birth might be made more explicable, the\r\ncurate had ordered her figure to be stuffed with rags and cotton under\r\nher skirt, so that no one could be in any doubt as to her condition. It\r\nwas a very beautiful image, with the same sad expression of all the\r\nimages that the Filipinos make, and a mien somewhat ashamed, doubtless\r\nat the way in which the curate had arranged her. In front came several\r\nsingers and behind, some musicians with the usual civil-guards. The\r\ncurate, as was to be expected after what he had done, was not in his\r\nplace, for that year he was greatly displeased at having to use all his\r\ndiplomacy and shrewdness to convince the townspeople that they should\r\npay thirty pesos for each Christmas mass instead of the usual twenty.\r\n“You’re turning filibusters!” he had said to them.\r\n\r\nThe cochero must have been greatly preoccupied with the sights of the\r\nprocession, for when it had passed and Basilio ordered him to go on, he\r\ndid not notice that the lamp on his carromata had gone out. Neither did\r\nBasilio notice it, his attention being devoted to gazing at the houses,\r\nwhich were illuminated inside and out with little paper lanterns of\r\nfantastic shapes and colors, stars surrounded by hoops with long\r\nstreamers which produced a pleasant murmur when shaken by the wind, and\r\nfishes of movable heads and tails, having a glass of oil inside,\r\nsuspended from the eaves of the windows in the delightful fashion of a\r\nhappy and homelike fiesta. But he also noticed that the lights were\r\nflickering, that the stars were being eclipsed, that this year had\r\nfewer ornaments and hangings than the former, which in turn had had\r\neven fewer than the year preceding it. There was scarcely any music in\r\nthe streets, while the agreeable noises of the kitchen were not to be\r\nheard in all the houses, which the youth ascribed to the fact that for\r\nsome time things had been going badly, the sugar did not bring a good\r\nprice, the rice crops had failed, over half the live stock had died,\r\nbut the taxes rose and increased for some inexplicable reason, while\r\nthe abuses of the Civil Guard became more frequent to kill off the\r\nhappiness of the people in the towns.\r\n\r\nHe was just pondering over this when an energetic “Halt!” resounded.\r\nThey were passing in front of the barracks and one of the guards had\r\nnoticed the extinguished lamp of the carromata, which could not go on\r\nwithout it. A hail of insults fell about the poor cochero, who vainly\r\nexcused himself with the length of the procession. He would be arrested\r\nfor violating the ordinances and afterwards advertised in the\r\nnewspapers, so the peaceful and prudent Basilio left the carromata and\r\nwent his way on foot, carrying his valise. This was San Diego, his\r\nnative town, where he had not a single relative.\r\n\r\nThe only, house wherein there seemed to be any mirth was Capitan\r\nBasilio’s. Hens and chickens cackled their death chant to the\r\naccompaniment of dry and repeated strokes, as of meat pounded on a\r\nchopping-block, and the sizzling of grease in the frying-pans. A feast\r\nwas going on in the house, and even into the street there passed a\r\ncertain draught of air, saturated with the succulent odors of stews and\r\nconfections. In the entresol Basilio saw Sinang, as small as when our\r\nreaders knew her before, [14] although a little rounder and plumper\r\nsince her marriage. Then to his great surprise he made out, further in\r\nat the back of the room, chatting with Capitan Basilio, the curate, and\r\nthe alferez of the Civil Guard, no less than the jeweler Simoun, as\r\never with his blue goggles and his nonchalant air.\r\n\r\n“It’s understood, Señor Simoun,” Capitan Basilio was saying, “that\r\nwe’ll go to Tiani to see your jewels.”\r\n\r\n“I would also go,” remarked the alferez, “because I need a watch-chain,\r\nbut I’m so busy—if Capitan Basilio would undertake—”\r\n\r\nCapitan Basilio would do so with the greatest pleasure, and as he\r\nwished to propitiate the soldier in order that he might not be molested\r\nin the persons of his laborers, he refused to accept the money which\r\nthe alferez was trying to get out of his pocket.\r\n\r\n“It’s my Christmas gift!”\r\n\r\n“I can’t allow you, Capitan, I can’t permit it!”\r\n\r\n“All right! We’ll settle up afterwards,” replied Capitan Basilio with a\r\nlordly gesture.\r\n\r\nAlso, the curate wanted a pair of lady’s earrings and requested the\r\ncapitan to buy them for him. “I want them first class. Later we’ll fix\r\nup the account.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry about that, Padre,” said the good man, who wished to be at\r\npeace with the Church also. An unfavorable report on the curate’s part\r\ncould do him great damage and cause him double the expense, for those\r\nearrings were a forced present. Simoun in the meantime was praising his\r\njewels.\r\n\r\n“That fellow is fierce!” mused the student. “He does business\r\neverywhere. And if I can believe a certain person, he buys from some\r\ngentlemen for a half of their value the same jewels that he himself has\r\nsold for presents. Everybody in this country prospers but us!”\r\n\r\nHe made his way to his house, or rather Capitan Tiago’s, now occupied\r\nby a trustworthy man who had held him in great esteem since the day\r\nwhen he had seen him perform a surgical operation with the same\r\ncoolness that he would cut up a chicken. This man was now waiting to\r\ngive him the news. Two of the laborers were prisoners, one was to be\r\ndeported, and a number of carabaos had died.\r\n\r\n“The same old story,” exclaimed Basilio, in a bad humor. “You always\r\nreceive me with the same complaints.” The youth was not overbearing,\r\nbut as he was at times scolded by Capitan Tiago, he liked in his turn\r\nto chide those under his orders.\r\n\r\nThe old man cast about for something new. “One of our tenants has died,\r\nthe old fellow who took care of the woods, and the curate refused to\r\nbury him as a pauper, saying that his master is a rich man.”\r\n\r\n“What did he die of?”\r\n\r\n“Of old age.”\r\n\r\n“Get out! To die of old age! It must at least have been some disease.”\r\nBasilio in his zeal for making autopsies wanted diseases.\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you anything new to tell me? You take away my appetite\r\nrelating the same old things. Do you know anything of Sagpang?”\r\n\r\nThe old man then told him about the kidnapping of Cabesang Tales.\r\nBasilio became thoughtful and said nothing more—his appetite had\r\ncompletely left him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBASILIO\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the bells began their chimes for the midnight mass and those who\r\npreferred a good sleep to fiestas and ceremonies arose grumbling at the\r\nnoise and movement, Basilio cautiously left the house, took two or\r\nthree turns through the streets to see that he was not watched or\r\nfollowed, and then made his way by unfrequented paths to the road that\r\nled to the ancient wood of the Ibarras, which had been acquired by\r\nCapitan Tiago when their property was confiscated and sold. As\r\nChristmas fell under the waning moon that year, the place was wrapped\r\nin darkness. The chimes had ceased, and only the tolling sounded\r\nthrough the darkness of the night amid the murmur of the breeze-stirred\r\nbranches and the measured roar of the waves on the neighboring lake,\r\nlike the deep respiration of nature sunk in profound sleep.\r\n\r\nAwed by the time and place, the youth moved along with his head down,\r\nas if endeavoring to see through the darkness. But from time to time he\r\nraised it to gaze at the stars through the open spaces between the\r\ntreetops and went forward parting the bushes or tearing away the lianas\r\nthat obstructed his path. At times he retraced his steps, his foot\r\nwould get caught among the plants, he stumbled over a projecting root\r\nor a fallen log. At the end of a half-hour he reached a small brook on\r\nthe opposite side of which arose a hillock, a black and shapeless mass\r\nthat in the darkness took on the proportions of a mountain. Basilio\r\ncrossed the brook on the stones that showed black against the shining\r\nsurface of the water, ascended the hill, and made his way to a small\r\nspace enclosed by old and crumbling walls. He approached the balete\r\ntree that rose in the center, huge, mysterious, venerable, formed of\r\nroots that extended up and down among the confusedly-interlaced trunks.\r\n\r\nPausing before a heap of stones he took off his hat and seemed to be\r\npraying. There his mother was buried, and every time he came to the\r\ntown his first visit was to that neglected and unknown grave. Since he\r\nmust visit Cabesang Tales’ family the next day, he had taken advantage\r\nof the night to perform this duty. Seated on a stone, he seemed to fall\r\ninto deep thought. His past rose before him like a long black film,\r\nrosy at first, then shadowy with spots of blood, then black, black,\r\ngray, and then light, ever lighter. The end could not be seen, hidden\r\nas it was by a cloud through which shone lights and the hues of dawn.\r\n\r\nThirteen years before to the day, almost to the hour, his mother had\r\ndied there in the deepest distress, on a glorious night when the moon\r\nshone brightly and the Christians of the world were engaged in\r\nrejoicing. Wounded and limping, he had reached there in pursuit of\r\nher—she mad and terrified, fleeing from her son as from a ghost. There\r\nshe had died, and there had come a stranger who had commanded him to\r\nbuild a funeral pyre. He had obeyed mechanically and when he returned\r\nhe found a second stranger by the side of the other’s corpse. What a\r\nnight and what a morning those were! The stranger helped him raise the\r\npyre, whereon they burned the corpse of the first, dug the grave in\r\nwhich they buried his mother, and then after giving him some pieces of\r\nmoney told him to leave the place. It was the first time that he had\r\nseen that man—tall, with blood-shot eyes, pale lips, and a sharp nose.\r\n\r\nEntirely alone in the world, without parents or brothers and sisters,\r\nhe left the town whose authorities inspired in him such great fear and\r\nwent to Manila to work in some rich house and study at the same time,\r\nas many do. His journey was an Odyssey of sleeplessness and startling\r\nsurprises, in which hunger counted for little, for he ate the fruits in\r\nthe woods, whither he retreated whenever he made out from afar the\r\nuniform of the Civil Guard, a sight that recalled the origin of all his\r\nmisfortunes. Once in Manila, ragged and sick, he went from door to door\r\noffering his services. A boy from the provinces who knew not a single\r\nword of Spanish, and sickly besides! Discouraged, hungry, and\r\nmiserable, he wandered about the streets, attracting attention by the\r\nwretchedness of his clothing. How often was he tempted to throw himself\r\nunder the feet of the horses that flashed by, drawing carriages shining\r\nwith silver and varnish, thus to end his misery at once! Fortunately,\r\nhe saw Capitan Tiago, accompanied by Aunt Isabel. He had known them\r\nsince the days in San Diego, and in his joy believed that in them he\r\nsaw almost fellow-townsfolk. He followed the carriage until he lost\r\nsight of it, and then made inquiries for the house. As it was the very\r\nday that Maria Clara entered the nunnery and Capitan Tiago was\r\naccordingly depressed, he was admitted as a servant, without pay, but\r\ninstead with leave to study, if he so wished, in San Juan de Letran.\r\n[15]\r\n\r\nDirty, poorly dressed, with only a pair of clogs for footwear, at the\r\nend of several months’ stay in Manila, he entered the first year of\r\nLatin. On seeing his clothes, his classmates drew away from him, and\r\nthe professor, a handsome Dominican, never asked him a question, but\r\nfrowned every time he looked at him. In the eight months that the class\r\ncontinued, the only words that passed between them were his name read\r\nfrom the roll and the daily adsum with which the student responded.\r\nWith what bitterness he left the class each day, and, guessing the\r\nreason for the treatment accorded him, what tears sprang into his eyes\r\nand what complaints were stifled in his heart! How he had wept and\r\nsobbed over the grave of his mother, relating to her his hidden\r\nsorrows, humiliations, and affronts, when at the approach of Christmas\r\nCapitan Tiago had taken him back to San Diego! Yet he memorized the\r\nlessons without omitting a comma, although he understood scarcely any\r\npart of them. But at length he became resigned, noticing that among the\r\nthree or four hundred in his class only about forty merited the honor\r\nof being questioned, because they attracted the professor’s attention\r\nby their appearance, some prank, comicality, or other cause. The\r\ngreater part of the students congratulated themselves that they thus\r\nescaped the work of thinking and understanding the subject. “One goes\r\nto college, not to learn and study, but to gain credit for the course,\r\nso if the book can be memorized, what more can be asked—the year is\r\nthus gained.” [16]\r\n\r\nBasilio passed the examinations by answering the solitary question\r\nasked him, like a machine, without stopping or breathing, and in the\r\namusement of the examiners won the passing certificate. His nine\r\ncompanions—they were examined in batches of ten in order to save\r\ntime—did not have such good luck, but were condemned to repeat the year\r\nof brutalization.\r\n\r\nIn the second year the game-cock that he tended won a large sum and he\r\nreceived from Capitan Tiago a big tip, which he immediately invested in\r\nthe purchase of shoes and a felt hat. With these and the clothes given\r\nhim by his employer, which he made over to fit his person, his\r\nappearance became more decent, but did not get beyond that. In such a\r\nlarge class a great deal was needed to attract the professor’s\r\nattention, and the student who in the first year did not make himself\r\nknown by some special quality, or did not capture the good-will of the\r\nprofessors, could with difficulty make himself known in the rest of his\r\nschool-days. But Basilio kept on, for perseverance was his chief trait.\r\n\r\nHis fortune seemed to change somewhat when he entered the third year.\r\nHis professor happened to be a very jolly fellow, fond of jokes and of\r\nmaking the students laugh, complacent enough in that he almost always\r\nhad his favorites recite the lessons—in fact, he was satisfied with\r\nanything. At this time Basilio now wore shoes and a clean and\r\nwell-ironed camisa. As his professor noticed that he laughed very\r\nlittle at the jokes and that his large eyes seemed to be asking\r\nsomething like an eternal question, he took him for a fool, and one day\r\ndecided to make him conspicuous by calling on him for the lesson.\r\nBasilio recited it from beginning to end, without hesitating over a\r\nsingle letter, so the professor called him a parrot and told a story to\r\nmake the class laugh. Then to increase the hilarity and justify the\r\nepithet he asked several questions, at the same time winking to his\r\nfavorites, as if to say to them, “You’ll see how we’re going to amuse\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\nBasilio now understood Spanish and answered the questions with the\r\nplain intention of making no one laugh. This disgusted everybody, the\r\nexpected absurdity did not materialize, no one could laugh, and the\r\ngood friar never pardoned him for having defrauded the hopes of the\r\nclass and disappointed his own prophecies. But who would expect\r\nanything worth while to come from a head so badly combed and placed on\r\nan Indian poorly shod, classified until recently among the arboreal\r\nanimals? As in other centers of learning, where the teachers are\r\nhonestly desirous that the students should learn, such discoveries\r\nusually delight the instructors, so in a college managed by men\r\nconvinced that for the most part knowledge is an evil, at least for the\r\nstudents, the episode of Basilio produced a bad impression and he was\r\nnot questioned again during the year. Why should he be, when he made no\r\none laugh?\r\n\r\nQuite discouraged and thinking of abandoning his studies, he passed to\r\nthe fourth year of Latin. Why study at all, why not sleep like the\r\nothers and trust to luck?\r\n\r\nOne of the two professors was very popular, beloved by all, passing for\r\na sage, a great poet, and a man of advanced ideas. One day when he\r\naccompanied the collegians on their walk, he had a dispute with some\r\ncadets, which resulted in a skirmish and a challenge. No doubt\r\nrecalling his brilliant youth, the professor preached a crusade and\r\npromised good marks to all who during the promenade on the following\r\nSunday would take part in the fray. The week was a lively one—there\r\nwere occasional encounters in which canes and sabers were crossed, and\r\nin one of these Basilio distinguished himself. Borne in triumph by the\r\nstudents and presented to the professor, he thus became known to him\r\nand came to be his favorite. Partly for this reason and partly from his\r\ndiligence, that year he received the highest marks, medals included, in\r\nview of which Capitan Tiago, who, since his daughter had become a nun,\r\nexhibited some aversion to the friars, in a fit of good humor induced\r\nhim to transfer to the Ateneo Municipal, the fame of which was then in\r\nits apogee.\r\n\r\nHere a new world opened before his eyes—a system of instruction that he\r\nhad never dreamed of. Except for a few superfluities and some childish\r\nthings, he was filled with admiration for the methods there used and\r\nwith gratitude for the zeal of the instructors. His eyes at times\r\nfilled with tears when he thought of the four previous years during\r\nwhich, from lack of means, he had been unable to study at that center.\r\nHe had to make extraordinary efforts to get himself to the level of\r\nthose who had had a good preparatory course, and it might be said that\r\nin that one year he learned the whole five of the secondary curricula.\r\nHe received his bachelor’s degree, to the great satisfaction of his\r\ninstructors, who in the examinations showed themselves to be proud of\r\nhim before the Dominican examiners sent there to inspect the school.\r\nOne of these, as if to dampen such great enthusiasm a little, asked him\r\nwhere he had studied the first years of Latin.\r\n\r\n“In San Juan de Letran, Padre,” answered Basilio.\r\n\r\n“Aha! Of course! He’s not bad,—in Latin,” the Dominican then remarked\r\nwith a slight smile.\r\n\r\nFrom choice and temperament he selected the course in medicine. Capitan\r\nTiago preferred the law, in order that he might have a lawyer free, but\r\nknowledge of the laws is not sufficient to secure clientage in the\r\nPhilippines—it is necessary to win the cases, and for this friendships\r\nare required, influence in certain spheres, a good deal of astuteness.\r\nCapitan Tiago finally gave in, remembering that medical students get on\r\nintimate terms with corpses, and for some time he had been seeking a\r\npoison to put on the gaffs of his game-cocks, the best he had been able\r\nto secure thus far being the blood of a Chinaman who had died of\r\nsyphilis.\r\n\r\nWith equal diligence, or more if possible, the young man continued this\r\ncourse, and after the third year began to render medical services with\r\nsuch great success that he was not only preparing a brilliant future\r\nfor himself but also earning enough to dress well and save some money.\r\nThis was the last year of the course and in two months he would be a\r\nphysician; he would come back to the town, he would marry Juliana, and\r\nthey would be happy. The granting of his licentiateship was not only\r\nassured, but he expected it to be the crowning act of his school-days,\r\nfor he had been designated to deliver the valedictory at the\r\ngraduation, and already he saw himself in the rostrum, before the whole\r\nfaculty, the object of public attention. All those heads, leaders of\r\nManila science, half-hidden in their colored capes; all the women who\r\ncame there out of curiosity and who years before had gazed at him, if\r\nnot with disdain, at least with indifference; all those men whose\r\ncarriages had once been about to crush him down in the mud like a dog:\r\nthey would listen attentively, and he was going to say something to\r\nthem that would not be trivial, something that had never before\r\nresounded in that place, he was going to forget himself in order to aid\r\nthe poor students of the future—and he would make his entrance on his\r\nwork in the world with that speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSIMOUN\r\n\r\n\r\nOver these matters Basilio was pondering as he visited his mother’s\r\ngrave. He was about to start back to the town when he thought he saw a\r\nlight flickering among the trees and heard the snapping of twigs, the\r\nsound of feet, and rustling of leaves. The light disappeared but the\r\nnoises became more distinct, coming directly toward where he was.\r\nBasilio was not naturally superstitious, especially after having carved\r\nup so many corpses and watched beside so many death-beds, but the old\r\nlegends about that ghostly spot, the hour, the darkness, the melancholy\r\nsighing of the wind, and certain tales heard in his childhood, asserted\r\ntheir influence over his mind and made his heart beat violently.\r\n\r\nThe figure stopped on the other side of the balete, but the youth could\r\nsee it through an open space between two roots that had grown in the\r\ncourse of time to the proportions of tree-trunks. It produced from\r\nunder its coat a lantern with a powerful reflecting lens, which it\r\nplaced on the ground, thereby lighting up a pair of riding-boots, the\r\nrest of the figure remaining concealed in the darkness. The figure\r\nseemed to search its pockets and then bent over to fix a shovel-blade\r\non the end of a stout cane. To his great surprise Basilio thought he\r\ncould make out some of the features of the jeweler Simoun, who indeed\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nThe jeweler dug in the ground and from time to time the lantern\r\nilluminated his face, on which were not now the blue goggles that so\r\ncompletely disguised him. Basilio shuddered: that was the same stranger\r\nwho thirteen years before had dug his mother’s grave there, only now he\r\nhad aged somewhat, his hair had turned white, he wore a beard and a\r\nmustache, but yet his look was the same, the bitter expression, the\r\nsame cloud on his brow, the same muscular arms, though somewhat thinner\r\nnow, the same violent energy. Old impressions were stirred in the boy:\r\nhe seemed to feel the heat of the fire, the hunger, the weariness of\r\nthat time, the smell of freshly turned earth. Yet his discovery\r\nterrified him—that jeweler Simoun, who passed for a British Indian, a\r\nPortuguese, an American, a mulatto, the Brown Cardinal, his Black\r\nEminence, the evil genius of the Captain-General as many called him,\r\nwas no other than the mysterious stranger whose appearance and\r\ndisappearance coincided with the death of the heir to that land! But of\r\nthe two strangers who had appeared, which was Ibarra, the living or the\r\ndead?\r\n\r\nThis question, which he had often asked himself whenever Ibarra’s death\r\nwas mentioned, again came into his mind in the presence of the human\r\nenigma he now saw before him. The dead man had had two wounds, which\r\nmust have been made by firearms, as he knew from what he had since\r\nstudied, and which would be the result of the chase on the lake. Then\r\nthe dead man must have been Ibarra, who had come to die at the tomb of\r\nhis forefathers, his desire to be cremated being explained by his\r\nresidence in Europe, where cremation is practised. Then who was the\r\nother, the living, this jeweler Simoun, at that time with such an\r\nappearance of poverty and wretchedness, but who had now returned loaded\r\nwith gold and a friend of the authorities? There was the mystery, and\r\nthe student, with his characteristic cold-bloodedness, determined to\r\nclear it up at the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nSimoun dug away for some time, but Basilio noticed that his old vigor\r\nhad declined—he panted and had to rest every few moments. Fearing that\r\nhe might be discovered, the boy made a sudden resolution. Rising from\r\nhis seat and issuing from his hiding-place, he asked in the most\r\nmatter-of-fact tone, “Can I help you, sir?”\r\n\r\nSimoun straightened up with the spring of a tiger attacked at his prey,\r\nthrust his hand in his coat pocket, and stared at the student with a\r\npale and lowering gaze.\r\n\r\n“Thirteen years ago you rendered me a great service, sir,” went on\r\nBasilio unmoved, “in this very place, by burying my mother, and I\r\nshould consider myself happy if I could serve you now.”\r\n\r\nWithout taking his eyes off the youth Simoun drew a revolver from his\r\npocket and the click of a hammer being cocked was heard. “For whom do\r\nyou take me?” he asked, retreating a few paces.\r\n\r\n“For a person who is sacred to me,” replied Basilio with some emotion,\r\nfor he thought his last moment had come. “For a person whom all, except\r\nme, believe to be dead, and whose misfortunes I have always lamented.”\r\n\r\nAn impressive silence followed these words, a silence that to the youth\r\nseemed to suggest eternity. But Simoun, after some hesitation,\r\napproached him and placing a hand on his shoulder said in a moving\r\ntone: “Basilio, you possess a secret that can ruin me and now you have\r\njust surprised me in another, which puts me completely in your hands,\r\nthe divulging of which would upset all my plans. For my own security\r\nand for the good of the cause in which I labor, I ought to seal your\r\nlips forever, for what is the life of one man compared to the end I\r\nseek? The occasion is fitting; no one knows that I have come here; I am\r\narmed; you are defenceless; your death would be attributed to the\r\noutlaws, if not to more supernatural causes—yet I’ll let you live and\r\ntrust that I shall not regret it. You have toiled, you have struggled\r\nwith energetic perseverance, and like myself, you have your scores to\r\nsettle with society. Your brother was murdered, your mother driven to\r\ninsanity, and society has prosecuted neither the assassin nor the\r\nexecutioner. You and I are the dregs of justice and instead of\r\ndestroying we ought to aid each other.”\r\n\r\nSimoun paused with a repressed sigh, and then slowly resumed, while his\r\ngaze wandered about: “Yes, I am he who came here thirteen years ago,\r\nsick and wretched, to pay the last tribute to a great and noble soul\r\nthat was willing to die for me. The victim of a vicious system, I have\r\nwandered over the world, working night and day to amass a fortune and\r\ncarry out my plan. Now I have returned to destroy that system, to\r\nprecipitate its downfall, to hurl it into the abyss toward which it is\r\nsenselessly rushing, even though I may have to shed oceans of tears and\r\nblood. It has condemned itself, it stands condemned, and I don’t want\r\nto die before I have seen it in fragments at the foot of the\r\nprecipice!”\r\n\r\nSimoun extended both his arms toward the earth, as if with that gesture\r\nhe would like to hold there the broken remains. His voice took on a\r\nsinister, even lugubrious tone, which made the student shudder.\r\n\r\n“Called by the vices of the rulers, I have returned to these islands,\r\nand under the cloak of a merchant have visited the towns. My gold has\r\nopened a way for me and wheresoever I have beheld greed in the most\r\nexecrable forms, sometimes hypocritical, sometimes shameless, sometimes\r\ncruel, fatten on the dead organism, like a vulture on a corpse, I have\r\nasked myself—why was there not, festering in its vitals, the\r\ncorruption, the ptomaine, the poison of the tombs, to kill the foul\r\nbird? The corpse was letting itself be consumed, the vulture was\r\ngorging itself with meat, and because it was not possible for me to\r\ngive it life so that it might turn against its destroyer, and because\r\nthe corruption developed slowly, I have stimulated greed, I have\r\nabetted it. The cases of injustice and the abuses multiplied\r\nthemselves; I have instigated crime and acts of cruelty, so that the\r\npeople might become accustomed to the idea of death. I have stirred up\r\ntrouble so that to escape from it some remedy might be found; I have\r\nplaced obstacles in the way of trade so that the country, impoverished\r\nand reduced to misery, might no longer be afraid of anything; I have\r\nexcited desires to plunder the treasury, and as this has not been\r\nenough to bring about a popular uprising, I have wounded the people in\r\ntheir most sensitive fiber; I have made the vulture itself insult the\r\nvery corpse that it feeds upon and hasten the corruption.\r\n\r\n“Now, when I was about to get the supreme rottenness, the supreme\r\nfilth, the mixture of such foul products brewing poison, when the greed\r\nwas beginning to irritate, in its folly hastening to seize whatever\r\ncame to hand, like an old woman caught in a conflagration, here you\r\ncome with your cries of Hispanism, with chants of confidence in the\r\ngovernment, in what cannot come to pass, here you have a body\r\npalpitating with heat and life, young, pure, vigorous, throbbing with\r\nblood, with enthusiasm, suddenly come forth to offer itself again as\r\nfresh food!\r\n\r\n“Ah, youth is ever inexperienced and dreamy, always running after the\r\nbutterflies and flowers! You have united, so that by your efforts you\r\nmay bind your fatherland to Spain with garlands of roses when in\r\nreality you are forging upon it chains harder than the diamond! You ask\r\nfor equal rights, the Hispanization of your customs, and you don’t see\r\nthat what you are begging for is suicide, the destruction of your\r\nnationality, the annihilation of your fatherland, the consecration of\r\ntyranny! What will you be in the future? A people without character, a\r\nnation without liberty—everything you have will be borrowed, even your\r\nvery defects! You beg for Hispanization, and do not pale with shame\r\nwhen they deny it you! And even if they should grant it to you, what\r\nthen—what have you gained? At best, a country of pronunciamentos, a\r\nland of civil wars, a republic of the greedy and the malcontents, like\r\nsome of the republics of South America! To what are you tending now,\r\nwith your instruction in Castilian, a pretension that would be\r\nridiculous were it not for its deplorable consequences! You wish to add\r\none more language to the forty odd that are spoken in the islands, so\r\nthat you may understand one another less and less.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” replied Basilio, “if the knowledge of Castilian may\r\nbind us to the government, in exchange it may also unite the islands\r\namong themselves.”\r\n\r\n“A gross error!” rejoined Simoun. “You are letting yourselves be\r\ndeceived by big words and never go to the bottom of things to examine\r\nthe results in their final analysis. Spanish will never be the general\r\nlanguage of the country, the people will never talk it, because the\r\nconceptions of their brains and the feelings of their hearts cannot be\r\nexpressed in that language—each people has its own tongue, as it has\r\nits own way of thinking! What are you going to do with Castilian, the\r\nfew of you who will speak it? Kill off your own originality,\r\nsubordinate your thoughts to other brains, and instead of freeing\r\nyourselves, make yourselves slaves indeed! Nine-tenths of those of you\r\nwho pretend to be enlightened are renegades to your country! He among\r\nyou who talks that language neglects his own in such a way that he\r\nneither writes nor understands it, and how many have I not seen who\r\npretended not to know a single word of it! But fortunately, you have an\r\nimbecile government! While Russia enslaves Poland by forcing the\r\nRussian language upon it, while Germany prohibits French in the\r\nconquered provinces, your government strives to preserve yours, and you\r\nin return, a remarkable people under an incredible government, you are\r\ntrying to despoil yourselves of your own nationality! One and all you\r\nforget that while a people preserves its language, it preserves the\r\nmarks of its liberty, as a man preserves his independence while he\r\nholds to his own way of thinking. Language is the thought of the\r\npeoples. Luckily, your independence is assured; human passions are\r\nlooking out for that!”\r\n\r\nSimoun paused and rubbed his hand over his forehead. The waning moon\r\nwas rising and sent its faint light down through the branches of the\r\ntrees, and with his white locks and severe features, illuminated from\r\nbelow by the lantern, the jeweler appeared to be the fateful spirit of\r\nthe wood planning some evil.\r\n\r\nBasilio was silent before such bitter reproaches and listened with\r\nbowed head, while Simoun resumed: “I saw this movement started and have\r\npassed whole nights of anguish, because I understood that among those\r\nyouths there were exceptional minds and hearts, sacrificing themselves\r\nfor what they thought to be a good cause, when in reality they were\r\nworking against their own country. How many times have I wished to\r\nspeak to you young men, to reveal myself and undeceive you! But in view\r\nof the reputation I enjoy, my words would have been wrongly interpreted\r\nand would perhaps have had a counter effect. How many times have I not\r\nlonged to approach your Makaraig, your Isagani! Sometimes I thought of\r\ntheir death, I wished to destroy them—”\r\n\r\nSimoun checked himself.\r\n\r\n“Here’s why I let you live, Basilio, and by such imprudence I expose\r\nmyself to the risk of being some day betrayed by you. But you know who\r\nI am, you know how much I must have suffered—then believe in me! You\r\nare not of the common crowd, which sees in the jeweler Simoun the\r\ntrader who incites the authorities to commit abuses in order that the\r\nabused may buy jewels. I am the Judge who wishes to castigate this\r\nsystem by making use of its own defects, to make war on it by\r\nflattering it. I need your help, your influence among the youth, to\r\ncombat these senseless desires for Hispanization, for assimilation, for\r\nequal rights. By that road you will become only a poor copy, and the\r\npeople should look higher. It is madness to attempt to influence the\r\nthoughts of the rulers—they have their plan outlined, the bandage\r\ncovers their eyes, and besides losing time uselessly, you are deceiving\r\nthe people with vain hopes and are helping to bend their necks before\r\nthe tyrant. What you should do is to take advantage of their prejudices\r\nto serve your needs. Are they unwilling that you be assimilated with\r\nthe Spanish people? Good enough! Distinguish yourselves then by\r\nrevealing yourselves in your own character, try to lay the foundations\r\nof the Philippine fatherland! Do they deny you hope? Good! Don’t depend\r\non them, depend upon yourselves and work! Do they deny you\r\nrepresentation in their Cortes? So much the better! Even should you\r\nsucceed in sending representatives of your own choice, what are you\r\ngoing to accomplish there except to be overwhelmed among so many\r\nvoices, and sanction with your presence the abuses and wrongs that are\r\nafterwards perpetrated? The fewer rights they allow you, the more\r\nreason you will have later to throw off the yoke, and return evil for\r\nevil. If they are unwilling to teach you their language, cultivate your\r\nown, extend it, preserve to the people their own way of thinking, and\r\ninstead of aspiring to be a province, aspire to be a nation! Instead of\r\nsubordinate thoughts, think independently, to the end that neither by\r\nright, nor custom, nor language, the Spaniard can be considered the\r\nmaster here, nor even be looked upon as a part of the country, but ever\r\nas an invader, a foreigner, and sooner or later you will have your\r\nliberty! Here’s why I let you live!”\r\n\r\nBasilio breathed freely, as though a great weight had been lifted from\r\nhim, and after a brief pause, replied: “Sir, the honor you do me in\r\nconfiding your plans to me is too great for me not to be frank with\r\nyou, and tell you that what you ask of me is beyond my power. I am no\r\npolitician, and if I have signed the petition for instruction in\r\nCastilian it has been because I saw in it an advantage to our studies\r\nand nothing more. My destiny is different; my aspiration reduces itself\r\nto alleviating the physical sufferings of my fellow men.”\r\n\r\nThe jeweler smiled. “What are physical sufferings compared to moral\r\ntortures? What is the death of a man in the presence of the death of a\r\nsociety? Some day you will perhaps be a great physician, if they let\r\nyou go your way in peace, but greater yet will be he who can inject a\r\nnew idea into this anemic people! You, what are you doing for the land\r\nthat gave you existence, that supports your life, that affords you\r\nknowledge? Don’t you realize that that is a useless life which is not\r\nconsecrated to a great idea? It is a stone wasted in the fields without\r\nbecoming a part of any edifice.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, sir!” replied Basilio modestly, “I’m not folding my arms, I’m\r\nworking like all the rest to raise up from the ruins of the past a\r\npeople whose units will be bound together—that each one may feel in\r\nhimself the conscience and the life of the whole. But however\r\nenthusiastic our generation may be, we understand that in this great\r\nsocial fabric there must be a division of labor. I have chosen my task\r\nand will devote myself to science.”\r\n\r\n“Science is not the end of man,” declared Simoun.\r\n\r\n“The most civilized nations are tending toward it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but only as a means of seeking their welfare.”\r\n\r\n“Science is more eternal, it’s more human, it’s more universal!”\r\nexclaimed the youth in a transport of enthusiasm. “Within a few\r\ncenturies, when humanity has become redeemed and enlightened, when\r\nthere are no races, when all peoples are free, when there are neither\r\ntyrants nor slaves, colonies nor mother countries, when justice rules\r\nand man is a citizen of the world, the pursuit of science alone will\r\nremain, the word patriotism will be equivalent to fanaticism, and he\r\nwho prides himself on patriotic ideas will doubtless be isolated as a\r\ndangerous disease, as a menace to the social order.”\r\n\r\nSimoun smiled sadly. “Yes, yes,” he said with a shake of his head, “yet\r\nto reach that condition it is necessary that there be no tyrannical and\r\nno enslaved peoples, it is necessary that man go about freely, that he\r\nknow how to respect the rights of others in their own individuality,\r\nand for this there is yet much blood to be shed, the struggle forces\r\nitself forward. To overcome the ancient fanaticism that bound\r\nconsciences it was necessary that many should perish in the holocausts,\r\nso that the social conscience in horror declared the individual\r\nconscience free. It is also necessary that all answer the question\r\nwhich with each day the fatherland asks them, with its fettered hands\r\nextended! Patriotism can only be a crime in a tyrannical people,\r\nbecause then it is rapine under a beautiful name, but however perfect\r\nhumanity may become, patriotism will always be a virtue among oppressed\r\npeoples, because it will at all times mean love of justice, of liberty,\r\nof personal dignity—nothing of chimerical dreams, of effeminate idyls!\r\nThe greatness of a man is not in living before his time, a thing almost\r\nimpossible, but in understanding its desires, in responding to its\r\nneeds, and in guiding it on its forward way. The geniuses that are\r\ncommonly believed to have existed before their time, only appear so\r\nbecause those who judge them see from a great distance, or take as\r\nrepresentative of the age the line of stragglers!”\r\n\r\nSimoun fell silent. Seeing that he could awake no enthusiasm in that\r\nunresponsive mind, he turned to another subject and asked with a change\r\nof tone: “And what are you doing for the memory of your mother and your\r\nbrother? Is it enough that you come here every year, to weep like a\r\nwoman over a grave?” And he smiled sarcastically.\r\n\r\nThe shot hit the mark. Basilio changed color and advanced a step.\r\n\r\n“What do you want me to do?” he asked angrily.\r\n\r\n“Without means, without social position, how may I bring their\r\nmurderers to justice? I would merely be another victim, shattered like\r\na piece of glass hurled against a rock. Ah, you do ill to recall this\r\nto me, since it is wantonly reopening a wound!”\r\n\r\n“But what if I should offer you my aid?”\r\n\r\nBasilio shook his head and remained pensive. “All the tardy\r\nvindications of justice, all the revenge in the world, will not restore\r\na single hair of my mother’s head, or recall a smile to my brother’s\r\nlips. Let them rest in peace—what should I gain now by avenging them?”\r\n\r\n“Prevent others from suffering what you have suffered, that in the\r\nfuture there be no brothers murdered or mothers driven to madness.\r\nResignation is not always a virtue; it is a crime when it encourages\r\ntyrants: there are no despots where there are no slaves! Man is in his\r\nown nature so wicked that he always abuses complaisance. I thought as\r\nyou do, and you know what my fate was. Those who caused your\r\nmisfortunes are watching you day and night, they suspect that you are\r\nonly biding your time, they take your eagerness to learn, your love of\r\nstudy, your very complaisance, for burning desires for revenge. The day\r\nthey can get rid of you they will do with you as they did with me, and\r\nthey will not let you grow to manhood, because they fear and hate you!”\r\n\r\n“Hate me? Still hate me after the wrong they have done me?” asked the\r\nyouth in surprise.\r\n\r\nSimoun burst into a laugh. “‘It is natural for man to hate those whom\r\nhe has wronged,’ said Tacitus, confirming the quos laeserunt et oderunt\r\nof Seneca. When you wish to gauge the evil or the good that one people\r\nhas done to another, you have only to observe whether it hates or\r\nloves. Thus is explained the reason why many who have enriched\r\nthemselves here in the high offices they have filled, on their return\r\nto the Peninsula relieve themselves by slanders and insults against\r\nthose who have been their victims. Proprium humani ingenii est odisse\r\nquern laeseris!”\r\n\r\n“But if the world is large, if one leaves them to the peaceful\r\nenjoyment of power, if I ask only to be allowed to work, to live—”\r\n\r\n“And to rear meek-natured sons to send them afterwards to submit to the\r\nyoke,” continued Simoun, cruelly mimicking Basilio’s tone. “A fine\r\nfuture you prepare for them, and they have to thank you for a life of\r\nhumiliation and suffering! Good enough, young man! When a body is\r\ninert, it is useless to galvanize it. Twenty years of continuous\r\nslavery, of systematic humiliation, of constant prostration, finally\r\ncreate in the mind a twist that cannot be straightened by the labor of\r\na day. Good and evil instincts are inherited and transmitted from\r\nfather to son. Then let your idylic ideas live, your dreams of a slave\r\nwho asks only for a bandage to wrap the chain so that it may rattle\r\nless and not ulcerate his skin! You hope for a little home and some\r\nease, a wife and a handful of rice—here is your ideal man of the\r\nPhilippines! Well, if they give it to you, consider yourself\r\nfortunate.”\r\n\r\nBasilio, accustomed to obey and bear with the caprices and humors of\r\nCapitan Tiago. was now dominated by Simoun, who appeared to him\r\nterrible and sinister on a background bathed in tears and blood. He\r\ntried to explain himself by saying that he did not consider himself fit\r\nto mix in politics, that he had no political opinions because he had\r\nnever studied the question, but that he was always ready to lend his\r\nservices the day they might be needed, that for the moment he saw only\r\none need, the enlightenment of the people.\r\n\r\nSimoun stopped him with a gesture, and, as the dawn was coming, said to\r\nhim: “Young man, I am not warning you to keep my secret, because I know\r\nthat discretion is one of your good qualities, and even though you\r\nmight wish to sell me, the jeweler Simoun, the friend of the\r\nauthorities and of the religious corporations, will always be given\r\nmore credit than the student Basilio, already suspected of\r\nfilibusterism, and, being a native, so much the more marked and\r\nwatched, and because in the profession you are entering upon you will\r\nencounter powerful rivals. After all, even though you have not\r\ncorresponded to my hopes, the day on which you change your mind, look\r\nme up at my house in the Escolta, and I’ll be glad to help you.”\r\n\r\nBasilio thanked him briefly and went away.\r\n\r\n“Have I really made a mistake?” mused Simoun, when he found himself\r\nalone. “Is it that he doubts me and meditates his plan of revenge so\r\nsecretly that he fears to tell it even in the solitude of the night? Or\r\ncan it be that the years of servitude have extinguished in his heart\r\nevery human sentiment and there remain only the animal desires to live\r\nand reproduce? In that case the type is deformed and will have to be\r\ncast over again. Then the hecatomb is preparing: let the unfit perish\r\nand only the strongest survive!”\r\n\r\nThen he added sadly, as if apostrophizing some one: “Have patience, you\r\nwho left me a name and a home, have patience! I have lost all—country,\r\nfuture, prosperity, your very tomb, but have patience! And thou, noble\r\nspirit, great soul, generous heart, who didst live with only one\r\nthought and didst sacrifice thy life without asking the gratitude or\r\napplause of any one, have patience, have patience! The methods that I\r\nuse may perhaps not be thine, but they are the most direct. The day is\r\ncoming, and when it brightens I myself will come to announce it to you\r\nwho are now indifferent. Have patience!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMERRY CHRISTMAS!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Juli opened her sorrowing eyes, she saw that the house was still\r\ndark, but the cocks were crowing. Her first thought was that perhaps\r\nthe Virgin had performed the miracle and the sun was not going to rise,\r\nin spite of the invocations of the cocks. She rose, crossed herself,\r\nrecited her morning prayers with great devotion, and with as little\r\nnoise as possible went out on the batalan.\r\n\r\nThere was no miracle—the sun was rising and promised a magnificent\r\nmorning, the breeze was delightfully cool, the stars were paling in the\r\neast, and the cocks were crowing as if to see who could crow best and\r\nloudest. That had been too much to ask—it were much easier to request\r\nthe Virgin to send the two hundred and fifty pesos. What would it cost\r\nthe Mother of the Lord to give them? But underneath the image she found\r\nonly the letter of her father asking for the ransom of five hundred\r\npesos. There was nothing to do but go, so, seeing that her grandfather\r\nwas not stirring, she thought him asleep and began to prepare\r\nbreakfast. Strange, she was calm, she even had a desire to laugh! What\r\nhad she had last night to afflict her so? She was not going very far,\r\nshe could come every second day to visit the house, her grandfather\r\ncould see her, and as for Basilio, he had known for some time the bad\r\nturn her father’s affairs had taken, since he had often said to her,\r\n“When I’m a physician and we are married, your father won’t need his\r\nfields.”\r\n\r\n“What a fool I was to cry so much,” she said to herself as she packed\r\nher tampipi. Her fingers struck against the locket and she pressed it\r\nto her lips, but immediately wiped them from fear of contagion, for\r\nthat locket set with diamonds and emeralds had come from a leper. Ah,\r\nthen, if she should catch that disease she could not get married.\r\n\r\nAs it became lighter, she could see her grandfather seated in a corner,\r\nfollowing all her movements with his eyes, so she caught up her tampipi\r\nof clothes and approached him smilingly to kiss his hand. The old man\r\nblessed her silently, while she tried to appear merry. “When father\r\ncomes back, tell him that I have at last gone to college—my mistress\r\ntalks Spanish. It’s the cheapest college I could find.”\r\n\r\nSeeing the old man’s eyes fill with tears, she placed the tampipi on\r\nher head and hastily went downstairs, her slippers slapping merrily on\r\nthe wooden steps. But when she turned her head to look again at the\r\nhouse, the house wherein had faded her childhood dreams and her maiden\r\nillusions, when she saw it sad, lonely, deserted, with the windows half\r\nclosed, vacant and dark like a dead man’s eyes, when she heard the low\r\nrustling of the bamboos, and saw them nodding in the fresh morning\r\nbreeze as though bidding her farewell, then her vivacity disappeared;\r\nshe stopped, her eyes filled with tears, and letting herself fall in a\r\nsitting posture on a log by the wayside she broke out into disconsolate\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nJuli had been gone several hours and the sun was quite high overhead\r\nwhen Tandang Selo gazed from the window at the people in their festival\r\ngarments going to the town to attend the high mass. Nearly all led by\r\nthe hand or carried in their arms a little boy or girl decked out as if\r\nfor a fiesta.\r\n\r\nChristmas day in the Philippines is, according to the elders, a fiesta\r\nfor the children, who are perhaps not of the same opinion and who, it\r\nmay be supposed, have for it an instinctive dread. They are roused\r\nearly, washed, dressed, and decked out with everything new, dear, and\r\nprecious that they possess—high silk shoes, big hats, woolen or velvet\r\nsuits, without overlooking four or five scapularies, which contain\r\ntexts from St. John, and thus burdened they are carried to the high\r\nmass, where for almost an hour they are subjected to the heat and the\r\nhuman smells from so many crowding, perspiring people, and if they are\r\nnot made to recite the rosary they must remain quiet, bored, or asleep.\r\nAt each movement or antic that may soil their clothing they are pinched\r\nand scolded, so the fact is that they do not laugh or feel happy, while\r\nin their round eyes can be read a protest against so much embroidery\r\nand a longing for the old shirt of week-days.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, they are dragged from house to house to kiss their\r\nrelatives’ hands. There they have to dance, sing, and recite all the\r\namusing things they know, whether in the humor or not, whether\r\ncomfortable or not in their fine clothes, with the eternal pinchings\r\nand scoldings if they play any of their tricks. Their relatives give\r\nthem cuartos which their parents seize upon and of which they hear\r\nnothing more. The only positive results they are accustomed to get from\r\nthe fiesta are the marks of the aforesaid pinchings, the vexations, and\r\nat best an attack of indigestion from gorging themselves with candy and\r\ncake in the houses of kind relatives. But such is the custom, and\r\nFilipino children enter the world through these ordeals, which\r\nafterwards prove the least sad, the least hard, of their lives.\r\n\r\nAdult persons who live independently also share in this fiesta, by\r\nvisiting their parents and their parents’ relatives, crooking their\r\nknees, and wishing them a merry Christmas. Their Christmas gift\r\nconsists of a sweetmeat, some fruit, a glass of water, or some\r\ninsignificant present.\r\n\r\nTandang Selo saw all his friends pass and thought sadly that this year\r\nhe had no Christmas gift for anybody, while his granddaughter had gone\r\nwithout hers, without wishing him a merry Christinas. Was it delicacy\r\non Juli’s part or pure forgetfulness?\r\n\r\nWhen he tried to greet the relatives who called on him, bringing their\r\nchildren, he found to his great surprise that he could not articulate a\r\nword. Vainly he tried, but no sound could he utter. He placed his hands\r\non his throat, shook his head, but without effect. When he tried to\r\nlaugh, his lips trembled convulsively and the only noise produced was a\r\nhoarse wheeze like the blowing of bellows.\r\n\r\nThe women gazed at him in consternation. “He’s dumb, he’s dumb!” they\r\ncried in astonishment, raising at once a literal pandemonium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nPILATES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this misfortune became known in the town, some\r\nlamented it and others shrugged their shoulders. No one was to blame,\r\nand no one need lay it on his conscience.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant of the Civil Guard gave no sign: he had received an\r\norder to take up all the arms and he had performed his duty. He had\r\nchased the tulisanes whenever he could, and when they captured Cabesang\r\nTales he had organized an expedition and brought into the town, with\r\ntheir arms bound behind them, five or six rustics who looked\r\nsuspicious, so if Cabesang Tales did not show up it was because he was\r\nnot in the pockets or under the skins of the prisoners, who were\r\nthoroughly shaken out.\r\n\r\nThe friar-administrator shrugged his shoulders: he had nothing to do\r\nwith it, it was a matter of tulisanes and he had merely done his duty.\r\nTrue it was that if he had not entered the complaint, perhaps the arms\r\nwould not have been taken up, and poor Tales would not have been\r\ncaptured; but he, Fray Clemente, had to look after his own safety, and\r\nthat Tales had a way of staring at him as if picking out a good target\r\nin some part of his body. Self-defense is natural. If there are\r\ntulisanes, the fault is not his, it is not his duty to run them\r\ndown—that belongs to the Civil Guard. If Cabesang Tales, instead of\r\nwandering about his fields, had stayed at home, he would not have been\r\ncaptured. In short, that was a punishment from heaven upon those who\r\nresisted the demands of his corporation.\r\n\r\nWhen Sister Penchang, the pious old woman in whose service Juli had\r\nentered, learned of it, she ejaculated several ’Susmarioseps, crossed\r\nherself, and remarked, “Often God sends these trials because we are\r\nsinners or have sinning relatives, to whom we should have taught piety\r\nand we haven’t done so.”\r\n\r\nThose sinning relatives referred to Juliana, for to this pious woman\r\nJuli was a great sinner. “Think of a girl of marriageable age who\r\ndoesn’t yet know how to pray! Jesús, how scandalous! If the wretch\r\ndoesn’t say the Diós te salve María without stopping at es contigo, and\r\nthe Santa María without a pause after pecadores, as every good\r\nChristian who fears God ought to do! She doesn’t know the oremus\r\ngratiam, and says mentíbus for méntibus. Anybody hearing her would\r\nthink she was talking about something else. ’Susmariosep!”\r\n\r\nGreatly scandalized, she made the sign of the cross and thanked God,\r\nwho had permitted the capture of the father in order that the daughter\r\nmight be snatched from sin and learn the virtues which, according to\r\nthe curates, should adorn every Christian woman. She therefore kept the\r\ngirl constantly at work, not allowing her to return to the village to\r\nlook after her grandfather. Juli had to learn how to pray, to read the\r\nbooks distributed by the friars, and to work until the two hundred and\r\nfifty pesos should be paid.\r\n\r\nWhen she learned that Basilio had gone to Manila to get his savings and\r\nransom Juli from her servitude, the good woman believed that the girl\r\nwas forever lost and that the devil had presented himself in the guise\r\nof the student. Dreadful as it all was, how true was that little book\r\nthe curate had given her! Youths who go to Manila to study are ruined\r\nand then ruin the others. Thinking to rescue Juli, she made her read\r\nand re-read the book called Tandang Basio Macunat, [17] charging her\r\nalways to go and see the curate in the convento, [18] as did the\r\nheroine, who is so praised by the author, a friar.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the friars had gained their point. They had certainly won\r\nthe suit, so they took advantage of Cabesang Tales’ captivity to turn\r\nthe fields over to the one who had asked for them, without the least\r\nthought of honor or the faintest twinge of shame. When the former owner\r\nreturned and learned what had happened, when he saw his fields in\r\nanother’s possession,—those fields that had cost the lives of his wife\r\nand daughter,—when he saw his father dumb and his daughter working as a\r\nservant, and when he himself received an order from the town council,\r\ntransmitted through the headman of the village, to move out of the\r\nhouse within three days, he said nothing; he sat down at his father’s\r\nside and spoke scarcely once during the whole day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nWEALTH AND WANT\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day, to the great surprise of the village, the jeweler\r\nSimoun, followed by two servants, each carrying a canvas-covered chest,\r\nrequested the hospitality of Cabesang Tales, who even in the midst of\r\nhis wretchedness did not forget the good Filipino customs—rather, he\r\nwas troubled to think that he had no way of properly entertaining the\r\nstranger. But Simoun brought everything with him, servants and\r\nprovisions, and merely wished to spend the day and night in the house\r\nbecause it was the largest in the village and was situated between San\r\nDiego and Tiani, towns where he hoped to find many customers.\r\n\r\nSimoun secured information about the condition of the roads and asked\r\nCabesang Tales if his revolver was a sufficient protection against the\r\ntulisanes.\r\n\r\n“They have rifles that shoot a long way,” was the rather absent-minded\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n“This revolver does no less,” remarked Simoun, firing at an areca-palm\r\nsome two hundred paces away.\r\n\r\nCabesang Tales noticed that some nuts fell, but remained silent and\r\nthoughtful.\r\n\r\nGradually the families, drawn by the fame of the jeweler’s wares, began\r\nto collect. They wished one another merry Christmas, they talked of\r\nmasses, saints, poor crops, but still were there to spend their savings\r\nfor jewels and trinkets brought from Europe. It was known that the\r\njeweler was the friend of the Captain-General, so it wasn’t lost labor\r\nto get on good terms with him, and thus be prepared for contingencies.\r\n\r\nCapitan Basilio came with his wife, daughter, and son-in-law, prepared\r\nto spend at least three thousand pesos. Sister Penchang was there to\r\nbuy a diamond ring she had promised to the Virgin of Antipolo. She had\r\nleft Juli at home memorizing a booklet the curate had sold her for four\r\ncuartos, with forty days of indulgence granted by the Archbishop to\r\nevery one who read it or listened to it read.\r\n\r\n“Jesús!” said the pious woman to Capitana Tika, “that poor girl has\r\ngrown up like a mushroom planted by the tikbalang. I’ve made her read\r\nthe book at the top of her voice at least fifty times and she doesn’t\r\nremember a single word of it. She has a head like a sieve—full when\r\nit’s in the water. All of us hearing her, even the dogs and cats, have\r\nwon at least twenty years of indulgence.”\r\n\r\nSimoun arranged his two chests on the table, one being somewhat larger\r\nthan the other. “You don’t want plated jewelry or imitation gems. This\r\nlady,” turning to Sinang, “wants real diamonds.”\r\n\r\n“That’s it, yes, sir, diamonds, old diamonds, antique stones, you\r\nknow,” she responded. “Papa will pay for them, because he likes antique\r\nthings, antique stones.” Sinang was accustomed to joke about the great\r\ndeal of Latin her father understood and the little her husband knew.\r\n\r\n“It just happens that I have some antique jewels,” replied Simoun,\r\ntaking the canvas cover from the smaller chest, a polished steel case\r\nwith bronze trimmings and stout locks. “I have necklaces of\r\nCleopatra’s, real and genuine, discovered in the Pyramids; rings of\r\nRoman senators and knights, found in the ruins of Carthage.”\r\n\r\n“Probably those that Hannibal sent back after the battle of Cannae!”\r\nexclaimed Capitan Basilio seriously, while he trembled with pleasure.\r\nThe good man, thought he had read much about the ancients, had never,\r\nby reason of the lack of museums in Filipinas, seen any of the objects\r\nof those times.\r\n\r\n“I have brought besides costly earrings of Roman ladies, discovered in\r\nthe villa of Annius Mucius Papilinus in Pompeii.”\r\n\r\nCapitan Easilio nodded to show that he understood and was eager to see\r\nsuch precious relics. The women remarked that they also wanted things\r\nfrom Rome, such as rosaries blessed by the Pope, holy relics that would\r\ntake away sins without the need of confessions, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhen the chest was opened and the cotton packing removed, there was\r\nexposed a tray filled with rings, reliquaries, lockets, crucifixes,\r\nbrooches, and such like. The diamonds set in among variously colored\r\nstones flashed out brightly and shimmered among golden flowers of\r\nvaried hues, with petals of enamel, all of peculiar designs and rare\r\nArabesque workmanship.\r\n\r\nSimoun lifted the tray and exhibited another filled with quaint jewels\r\nthat would have satisfied the imaginations of seven débutantes on the\r\neves of the balls in their honor. Designs, one more fantastic than the\r\nother, combinations of precious stones and pearls worked into the\r\nfigures of insects with azure backs and transparent forewings,\r\nsapphires, emeralds, rubies, turquoises, diamonds, joined to form\r\ndragon-flies, wasps, bees, butterflies, beetles, serpents, lizards,\r\nfishes, sprays of flowers. There were diadems, necklaces of pearls and\r\ndiamonds, so that some of the girls could not withhold a nakú of\r\nadmiration, and Sinang gave a cluck with her tongue, whereupon her\r\nmother pinched her to prevent her from encouraging the jeweler to raise\r\nhis prices, for Capitana Tika still pinched her daughter even after the\r\nlatter was married.\r\n\r\n“Here you have some old diamonds,” explained the jeweler. “This ring\r\nbelonged to the Princess Lamballe and those earrings to one of Marie\r\nAntoinette’s ladies.” They consisted of some beautiful solitaire\r\ndiamonds, as large as grains of corn, with somewhat bluish lights, and\r\npervaded with a severe elegance, as though they still reflected in\r\ntheir sparkles the shuddering of the Reign of Terror.\r\n\r\n“Those two earrings!” exclaimed Sinang, looking at her father and\r\ninstinctively covering the arm next to her mother.\r\n\r\n“Something more ancient yet, something Roman,” said Capitan Basilio\r\nwith a wink.\r\n\r\nThe pious Sister Penchang thought that with such a gift the Virgin of\r\nAntipolo would be softened and grant her her most vehement desire: for\r\nsome time she had begged for a wonderful miracle to which her name\r\nwould be attached, so that her name might be immortalized on earth and\r\nshe then ascend into heaven, like the Capitana Ines of the curates. She\r\ninquired the price and Simoun asked three thousand pesos, which made\r\nthe good woman cross herself—’Susmariosep!\r\n\r\nSimoun now exposed the third tray, which was filled with watches,\r\ncigar- and match-cases decorated with the rarest enamels, reliquaries\r\nset with diamonds and containing the most elegant miniatures.\r\n\r\nThe fourth tray, containing loose gems, stirred a murmur of admiration.\r\nSinang again clucked with her tongue, her mother again pinched her,\r\nalthough at the same time herself emitting a ’Susmaría of wonder.\r\n\r\nNo one there had ever before seen so much wealth. In that chest lined\r\nwith dark-blue velvet, arranged in trays, were the wonders of the\r\nArabian Nights, the dreams of Oriental fantasies. Diamonds as large as\r\npeas glittered there, throwing out attractive rays as if they were\r\nabout to melt or burn with all the hues of the spectrum; emeralds from\r\nPeru, of varied forms and shapes; rubies from India, red as drops of\r\nblood; sapphires from Ceylon, blue and white; turquoises from Persia;\r\nOriental pearls, some rosy, some lead-colored, others black. Those who\r\nhave at night seen a great rocket burst in the azure darkness of the\r\nsky into thousands of colored lights, so bright that they make the\r\neternal stars look dim, can imagine the aspect the tray presented.\r\n\r\nAs if to increase the admiration of the beholders, Simoun took the\r\nstones out with his tapering brown fingers, gloating over their\r\ncrystalline hardness, their luminous stream, as they poured from his\r\nhands like drops of water reflecting the tints of the rainbow. The\r\nreflections from so many facets, the thought of their great value,\r\nfascinated the gaze of every one.\r\n\r\nCabesang Tales, who had approached out of curiosity, closed his eyes\r\nand drew back hurriedly, as if to drive away an evil thought. Such\r\ngreat riches were an insult to his misfortunes; that man had come there\r\nto make an exhibition of his immense wealth on the very day that he,\r\nTales, for lack of money, for lack of protectors, had to abandon the\r\nhouse raised by his own hands.\r\n\r\n“Here you have two black diamonds, among the largest in existence,”\r\nexplained the jeweler. “They’re very difficult to cut because they’re\r\nthe very hardest. This somewhat rosy stone is also a diamond, as is\r\nthis green one that many take for an emerald. Quiroga the Chinaman\r\noffered me six thousand pesos for it in order to present it to a very\r\ninfluential lady, and yet it is not the green ones that are the most\r\nvaluable, but these blue ones.”\r\n\r\nHe selected three stones of no great size, but thick and well-cut, of a\r\ndelicate azure tint.\r\n\r\n“For all that they are smaller than the green,” he continued, “they\r\ncost twice as much. Look at this one, the smallest of all, weighing not\r\nmore than two carats, which cost me twenty thousand pesos and which I\r\nwon’t sell for less than thirty. I had to make a special trip to buy\r\nit. This other one, from the mines of Golconda, weighs three and a half\r\ncarats and is worth over seventy thousand. The Viceroy of India, in a\r\nletter I received the day before yesterday, offers me twelve thousand\r\npounds sterling for it.”\r\n\r\nBefore such great wealth, all under the power of that man who talked so\r\nunaffectedly, the spectators felt a kind of awe mingled with dread.\r\nSinang clucked several times and her mother did not pinch her, perhaps\r\nbecause she too was overcome, or perhaps because she reflected that a\r\njeweler like Simoun was not going to try to gain five pesos more or\r\nless as a result of an exclamation more or less indiscreet. All gazed\r\nat the gems, but no one showed any desire to handle them, they were so\r\nawe-inspiring. Curiosity was blunted by wonder. Cabesang Tales stared\r\nout into the field, thinking that with a single diamond, perhaps the\r\nvery smallest there, he could recover his daughter, keep his house, and\r\nperhaps rent another farm. Could it be that those gems were worth more\r\nthan a man’s home, the safety of a maiden, the peace of an old man in\r\nhis declining days?\r\n\r\nAs if he guessed the thought, Simoun remarked to those about him: “Look\r\nhere—with one of these little blue stones, which appear so innocent and\r\ninoffensive, pure as sparks scattered over the arch of heaven, with one\r\nof these, seasonably presented, a man was able to have his enemy\r\ndeported, the father of a family, as a disturber of the peace; and with\r\nthis other little one like it, red as one’s heart-blood, as the feeling\r\nof revenge, and bright as an orphan’s tears, he was restored to\r\nliberty, the man was returned to his home, the father to his children,\r\nthe husband to the wife, and a whole family saved from a wretched\r\nfuture.”\r\n\r\nHe slapped the chest and went on in a loud tone in bad Tagalog: “Here I\r\nhave, as in a medicine-chest, life and death, poison and balm, and with\r\nthis handful I can drive to tears all the inhabitants of the\r\nPhilippines!”\r\n\r\nThe listeners gazed at him awe-struck, knowing him to be right. In his\r\nvoice there could be detected a strange ring, while sinister flashes\r\nseemed to issue from behind the blue goggles.\r\n\r\nThen as if to relieve the strain of the impression made by the gems on\r\nsuch simple folk, he lifted up the tray and exposed at the bottom the\r\nsanctum sanctorum. Cases of Russian leather, separated by layers of\r\ncotton, covered a bottom lined with gray velvet. All expected wonders,\r\nand Sinang’s husband thought he saw carbuncles, gems that flashed fire\r\nand shone in the midst of the shadows. Capitan Basilio was on the\r\nthreshold of immortality: he was going to behold something real,\r\nsomething beyond his dreams.\r\n\r\n“This was a necklace of Cleopatra’s,” said Simoun, taking out carefully\r\na flat case in the shape of a half-moon. “It’s a jewel that can’t be\r\nappraised, an object for a museum, only for a rich government.”\r\n\r\nIt was a necklace fashioned of bits of gold representing little idols\r\namong green and blue beetles, with a vulture’s head made from a single\r\npiece of rare jasper at the center between two extended wings—the\r\nsymbol and decoration of Egyptian queens.\r\n\r\nSinang turned up her nose and made a grimace of childish depreciation,\r\nwhile Capitan Basilio, with all his love for antiquity, could not\r\nrestrain an exclamation of disappointment.\r\n\r\n“It’s a magnificent jewel, well-preserved, almost two thousand years\r\nold.”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw!” Sinang made haste to exclaim, to prevent her father’s falling\r\ninto temptation.\r\n\r\n“Fool!” he chided her, after overcoming his first disappointment. “How\r\ndo you know but that to this necklace is due the present condition of\r\nthe world? With this Cleopatra may have captivated Caesar, Mark Antony!\r\nThis has heard the burning declarations of love from the greatest\r\nwarriors of their time, it has listened to speeches in the purest and\r\nmost elegant Latin, and yet you would want to wear it!”\r\n\r\n“I? I wouldn’t give three pesos for it.”\r\n\r\n“You could give twenty, silly,” said Capitana Tika in a judicial tone.\r\n“The gold is good and melted down would serve for other jewelry.”\r\n\r\n“This is a ring that must have belonged to Sulla,” continued Simoun,\r\nexhibiting a heavy ring of solid gold with a seal on it.\r\n\r\n“With that he must have signed the death-wrarrants during his\r\ndictatorship!” exclaimed Capitan Basilio, pale with emotion. He\r\nexamined it and tried to decipher the seal, but though he turned it\r\nover and over he did not understand paleography, so he could not read\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“What a finger Sulla had!” he observed finally. “This would fit two of\r\nours—as I’ve said, we’re degenerating!”\r\n\r\n“I still have many other jewels—”\r\n\r\n“If they’re all that kind, never mind!” interrupted Sinang. “I think I\r\nprefer the modern.”\r\n\r\nEach one selected some piece of jewelry, one a ring, another a watch,\r\nanother a locket. Capitana Tika bought a reliquary that contained a\r\nfragment of the stone on which Our Saviour rested at his third fall;\r\nSinang a pair of earrings; and Capitan Basilio the watch-chain for the\r\nalferez, the lady’s earrings for the curate, and other gifts. The\r\nfamilies from the town of Tiani, not to be outdone by those of San\r\nDiego, in like manner emptied their purses.\r\n\r\nSimoun bought or exchanged old jewelry, brought there by economical\r\nmothers, to whom it was no longer of use.\r\n\r\n“You, haven’t you something to sell?” he asked Cabesang Tales, noticing\r\nthe latter watching the sales and exchanges with covetous eyes, but the\r\nreply was that all his daughter’s jewels had been sold, nothing of\r\nvalue remained.\r\n\r\n“What about Maria Clara’s locket?” inquired Sinang.\r\n\r\n“True!” the man exclaimed, and his eyes blazed for a moment.\r\n\r\n“It’s a locket set with diamonds and emeralds,” Sinang told the\r\njeweler. “My old friend wore it before she became a nun.”\r\n\r\nSimoun said nothing, but anxiously watched Cabesang Tales, who, after\r\nopening several boxes, found the locket. He examined it carefully,\r\nopening and shutting it repeatedly. It was the same locket that Maria\r\nClara had worn during the fiesta in San Diego and which she had in a\r\nmoment of compassion given to a leper.\r\n\r\n“I like the design,” said Simoun. “How much do you want for it?”\r\n\r\nCabesang Tales scratched his head in perplexity, then his ear, then\r\nlooked at the women.\r\n\r\n“I’ve taken a fancy to this locket,” Simoun went on. “Will you take a\r\nhundred, five hundred pesos? Do you want to exchange it for something\r\nelse? Take your choice here!”\r\n\r\nTales stared foolishly at Simoun, as if in doubt of what he heard.\r\n“Five hundred pesos?” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“Five hundred,” repeated the jeweler in a voice shaking with emotion.\r\n\r\nCabesang Tales took the locket and made several turns about the room,\r\nwith his heart beating violently and his hands trembling. Dared he ask\r\nmore? That locket could save him, this was an excellent opportunity,\r\nsuch as might not again present itself.\r\n\r\nThe women winked at him to encourage him to make the sale, excepting\r\nPenchang, who, fearing that Juli would be ransomed, observed piously:\r\n“I would keep it as a relic. Those who have seen Maria Clara in the\r\nnunnery say she has got so thin and weak that she can scarcely talk and\r\nit’s thought that she’ll die a saint. Padre Salvi speaks very highly of\r\nher and he’s her confessor. That’s why Juli didn’t want ito give it up,\r\nbut rather preferred to pawn herself.”\r\n\r\nThis speech had its effect—the thought of his daughter restrained\r\nTales. “If you will allow me,” he said, “I’ll go to the town to consult\r\nmy daughter. I’ll be back before night.”\r\n\r\nThis was agreed upon and Tales set out at once. But when he found\r\nhimself outside of the village, he made out at a distance, on a path,\r\nthat entered the woods, the friar-administrator and a man whom he\r\nrecognized as the usurper of his land. A husband seeing his wife enter\r\na private room with another man could not feel more wrath or jealousy\r\nthan Cabesang Tales experienced when he saw them moving over his\r\nfields, the fields cleared by him, which he had thought to leave to his\r\nchildren. It seemed to him that they were mocking him, laughing at his\r\npowerlessness. There flashed into his memory what he had said about\r\nnever giving up his fields except to him who irrigated them with his\r\nown blood and buried in them his wife and daughter.\r\n\r\nHe stopped, rubbed his hand over his forehead, and shut his eyes. When\r\nhe again opened them, he saw that the man had turned to laugh and that\r\nthe friar had caught his sides as though to save himself from bursting\r\nwith merriment, then he saw them point toward his house and laugh\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nA buzz sounded in his ears, he felt the crack of a whip around his\r\nchest, the red mist reappeared before his eyes, he again saw the\r\ncorpses of his wife and daughter, and beside them the usurper with the\r\nfriar laughing and holding his sides. Forgetting everything else, he\r\nturned aside into the path they had taken, the one leading to his\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nSimoun waited in vain for Cabesang Tales to return that night. But the\r\nnext morning when he arose he noticed that the leather holster of his\r\nrevolver was empty. Opening it he found inside a scrap of paper wrapped\r\naround the locket set with emeralds and diamonds, with these few lines\r\nwritten on it in Tagalog:\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Pardon, sir, that in my own house I relieve you of what belongs to\r\n    you, but necessity drives me to it. In exchange for your revolver I\r\n    leave the locket you desired so much. I need the weapon, for I am\r\n    going out to join the tulisanes.\r\n\r\n   “I advise you not to keep on your present road, because if you fall\r\n    into our power, not then being my guest, we will require of you a\r\n    large ransom.\r\n\r\n        Telesforo Juan de Dios.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“At last I’ve found my man!” muttered Simoun with a deep breath. “He’s\r\nsomewhat scrupulous, but so much the better—he’ll keep his promises.”\r\n\r\nHe then ordered a servant to go by boat over the lake to Los Baños with\r\nthe larger chest and await him there. He would go on overland, taking\r\nthe smaller chest, the one containing his famous jewels. The arrival of\r\nfour civil-guards completed his good humor. They came to arrest\r\nCabesang Tales and not finding him took Tandang Selo away instead.\r\n\r\nThree murders had been committed during the night. The\r\nfriar-administrator and the new tenant of Cabesang Tales’ land had been\r\nfound dead, with their heads split open and their mouths full of earth,\r\non the border of the fields. In the town the wife of the usurper was\r\nfound dead at dawn, her mouth also filled with earth and her throat\r\ncut, with a fragment of paper beside her, on which was the name Tales,\r\nwritten in blood as though traced by a finger.\r\n\r\nCalm yourselves, peaceful inhabitants of Kalamba! None of you are named\r\nTales, none of you have committed any crime! You are called Luis\r\nHabaña, Matías Belarmino, Nicasio Eigasani, Cayetano de Jesús, Mateo\r\nElejorde, Leandro Lopez, Antonino Lopez, Silvestre Ubaldo, Manuel\r\nHidalgo, Paciano Mercado, your name is the whole village of Kalamba.\r\n[19] You cleared your fields, on them you have spent the labor of your\r\nwhole lives, your savings, your vigils and privations, and you have\r\nbeen despoiled of them, driven from your homes, with the rest forbidden\r\nto show you hospitality! Not content with outraging justice, they [20]\r\nhave trampled upon the sacred traditions of your country! You have\r\nserved Spain and the King, and when in their name you have asked for\r\njustice, you were banished without trial, torn from your wives’ arms\r\nand your children’s caresses! Any one of you has suffered more than\r\nCabesang Tales, and yet none, not one of you, has received justice!\r\nNeither pity nor humanity has been shown you—you have been persecuted\r\nbeyond the tomb, as was Mariano Herbosa! [21] Weep or laugh, there in\r\nthose lonely isles where you wander vaguely, uncertain of the future!\r\nSpain, the generous Spain, is watching over you, and sooner or later\r\nyou will have justice!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nLOS BAÑOS\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Excellency, the Captain-General and Governor of the Philippine\r\nIslands, had been hunting in Bosoboso. But as he had to be accompanied\r\nby a band of music,—since such an exalted personage was not to be\r\nesteemed less than the wooden images carried in the processions,—and as\r\ndevotion to the divine art of St. Cecilia has not yet been popularized\r\namong the deer and wild boars of Bosoboso, his Excellency, with the\r\nband of music and train of friars, soldiers, and clerks, had not been\r\nable to catch a single rat or a solitary bird.\r\n\r\nThe provincial authorities foresaw dismissals and transfers, the poor\r\ngobernadorcillos and cabezas de barangay were restless and sleepless,\r\nfearing that the mighty hunter in his wrath might have a notion to make\r\nup with their persons for the lack of submissiveness on the part of the\r\nbeasts of the forest, as had been done years before by an alcalde who\r\nhad traveled on the shoulders of impressed porters because he found no\r\nhorses gentle enough to guarantee his safety. There was not lacking an\r\nevil rumor that his Excellency had decided to take some action, since\r\nin this he saw the first symptoms of a rebellion which should be\r\nstrangled in its infancy, that a fruitless hunt hurt the prestige of\r\nthe Spanish name, that he already had his eye on a wretch to be dressed\r\nup as a deer, when his Excellency, with clemency that Ben-Zayb lacked\r\nwords to extol sufficiently, dispelled all the fears by declaring that\r\nit pained him to sacrifice to his pleasure the beasts of the forest.\r\n\r\nBut to tell the truth, his Excellency was secretly very well satisfied,\r\nfor what would have happened had he missed a shot at a deer, one of\r\nthose not familiar with political etiquette? What would the prestige of\r\nthe sovereign power have come to then? A Captain-General of the\r\nPhilippines missing a shot, like a raw hunter? What would have been\r\nsaid by the Indians, among whom there were some fair huntsmen? The\r\nintegrity of the fatherland would have been endangered.\r\n\r\nSo it was that his Excellency, with a sheepish smile, and posing as a\r\ndisappointed hunter, ordered an immediate return to Los Baños. During\r\nthe journey he related with an indifferent air his hunting exploits in\r\nthis or that forest of the Peninsula, adopting a tone somewhat\r\ndepreciative, as suited the case, toward hunting in Filipinas. The bath\r\nin Dampalit, the hot springs on the shore of the lake, card-games in\r\nthe palace, with an occasional excursion to some neighboring waterfall,\r\nor the lake infested with caymans, offered more attractions and fewer\r\nrisks to the integrity of the fatherland.\r\n\r\nThus on one of the last days of December, his Excellency found himself\r\nin the sala, taking a hand at cards while he awaited the breakfast\r\nhour. He had come from the bath, with the usual glass of coconut-milk\r\nand its soft meat, so he was in the best of humors for granting favors\r\nand privileges. His good humor was increased by his winning a good many\r\nhands, for Padre Irene and Padre Sibyla, with whom he was playing, were\r\nexercising all their skill in secretly trying to lose, to the great\r\nirritation of Padre Camorra, who on account of his late arrival only\r\nthat morning was not informed as to the game they were playing on the\r\nGeneral. The friar-artilleryman was playing in good faith and with\r\ngreat care, so he turned red and bit his lip every time Padre Sibyla\r\nseemed inattentive or blundered, but he dared not say a word by reason\r\nof the respect he felt for the Dominican. In exchange he took his\r\nrevenge out on Padre Irene, whom he looked upon as a base fawner and\r\ndespised for his coarseness. Padre Sibyla let him scold, while the\r\nhumbler Padre Irene tried to excuse himself by rubbing his long nose.\r\nHis Excellency was enjoying it and took advantage, like the good\r\ntactician that the Canon hinted he was, of all the mistakes of his\r\nopponents. Padre Camorra was ignorant of the fact that across the table\r\nthey were playing for the intellectual development of the Filipinos,\r\nthe instruction in Castilian, but had he known it he would doubtless\r\nhave joyfully entered into that game.\r\n\r\nThe open balcony admitted the fresh, pure breeze and revealed the lake,\r\nwhose waters murmured sweetly around the base of the edifice, as if\r\nrendering homage. On the right, at a distance, appeared Talim Island, a\r\ndeep blue in the midst of the lake, while almost in front lay the green\r\nand deserted islet of Kalamba, in the shape of a half-moon. To the left\r\nthe picturesque shores were fringed with clumps of bamboo, then a hill\r\noverlooking the lake, with wide ricefields beyond, then red roofs amid\r\nthe deep green of the trees,—the town of Kalamba,—and beyond the\r\nshore-line fading into the distance, with the horizon at the back\r\nclosing down over the water, giving the lake the appearance of a sea\r\nand justifying the name the Indians give it of dagat na tabang, or\r\nfresh-water sea.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the sala, seated before a table covered with documents,\r\nwas the secretary. His Excellency was a great worker and did not like\r\nto lose time, so he attended to business in the intervals of the game\r\nor while dealing the cards. Meanwhile, the bored secretary yawned and\r\ndespaired. That morning he had worked, as usual, over transfers,\r\nsuspensions of employees, deportations, pardons, and the like, but had\r\nnot yet touched the great question that had stirred so much\r\ninterest—the petition of the students requesting permission to\r\nestablish an academy of Castilian. Pacing from one end of the room to\r\nthe other and conversing animatedly but in low tones were to be seen\r\nDon Custodio, a high official, and a friar named Padre Fernandez, who\r\nhung his head with an air either of meditation or annoyance. From an\r\nadjoining room issued the click of balls striking together and bursts\r\nof laughter, amid which might be heard the sharp, dry voice of Simoun,\r\nwho was playing billiards with Ben-Zayb.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Padre Camorra arose. “The devil with this game, puñales!” he\r\nexclaimed, throwing his cards at Padre Irene’s head. “Puñales, that\r\ntrick, if not all the others, was assured and we lost by default!\r\nPuñales! The devil with this game!”\r\n\r\nHe explained the situation angrily to all the occupants of the sala,\r\naddressing himself especially to the three walking about, as if he had\r\nselected them for judges. The general played thus, he replied with such\r\na card, Padre Irene had a certain card; he led, and then that fool of a\r\nPadre Irene didn’t play his card! Padre Irene was giving the game away!\r\nIt was a devil of a way to play! His mother’s son had not come here to\r\nrack his brains for nothing and lose his money!\r\n\r\nThen he added, turning very red, “If the booby thinks my money grows on\r\nevery bush!... On top of the fact that my Indians are beginning to\r\nhaggle over payments!” Fuming, and disregarding the excuses of Padre\r\nIrene, who tried to explain while he rubbed the tip of his beak in\r\norder to conceal his sly smile, he went into the billiardroom.\r\n\r\n“Padre Fernandez, would you like to take a hand?” asked Fray Sibyla.\r\n\r\n“I’m a very poor player,” replied the friar with a grimace.\r\n\r\n“Then get Simoun,” said the General. “Eh, Simoun! Eh, Mister, won’t you\r\ntry a hand?”\r\n\r\n“What is your disposition concerning the arms for sporting purposes?”\r\nasked the secretary, taking advantage of the pause.\r\n\r\nSimoun thrust his head through the doorway.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you want to take Padre Camorra’s place, Señor Sindbad?” inquired\r\nPadre Irene. “You can bet diamonds instead of chips.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t care if I do,” replied Simoun, advancing while he brushed the\r\nchalk from his hands. “What will you bet?”\r\n\r\n“What should we bet?” returned Padre Sibyla. “The General can bet what\r\nhe likes, but we priests, clerics—”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” interrupted Simoun ironically. “You and Padre Irene can pay with\r\ndeeds of charity, prayers, and virtues, eh?”\r\n\r\n“You know that the virtues a person may possess,” gravely argued Padre\r\nSibyla, “are not like the diamonds that may pass from hand to hand, to\r\nbe sold and resold. They are inherent in the being, they are essential\r\nattributes of the subject—”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be satisfied then if you pay me with promises,” replied Simoun\r\njestingly. “You, Padre Sibyla, instead of paying me five something or\r\nother in money, will say, for example: for five days I renounce\r\npoverty, humility, and obedience. You, Padre Irene: I renounce\r\nchastity, liberality, and so on. Those are small matters, and I’m\r\nputting up my diamonds.”\r\n\r\n“What a peculiar man this Simoun is, what notions he has!” exclaimed\r\nPadre Irene with a smile.\r\n\r\n“And he,” continued Simoun, slapping his Excellency familiarly on the\r\nshoulder, “he will pay me with an order for five days in prison, or\r\nfive months, or an order of deportation made out in blank, or let us\r\nsay a summary execution by the Civil Guard while my man is being\r\nconducted from one town to another.”\r\n\r\nThis was a strange proposition, so the three who had been pacing about\r\ngathered around.\r\n\r\n“But, Señor Simoun,” asked the high official, “what good will you get\r\nout of winning promises of virtues, or lives and deportations and\r\nsummary executions?”\r\n\r\n“A great deal! I’m tired of hearing virtues talked about and would like\r\nto have the whole of them, all there are in the world, tied up in a\r\nsack, in order to throw them into the sea, even though I had to use my\r\ndiamonds for sinkers.”\r\n\r\n“What an idea!” exclaimed Padre Irene with another smile. “And the\r\ndeportations and executions, what of them?”\r\n\r\n“Well, to clean the country and destroy every evil seed.”\r\n\r\n“Get out! You’re still sore at the tulisanes. But you were lucky that\r\nthey didn’t demand a larger ransom or keep all your jewels. Man, don’t\r\nbe ungrateful!”\r\n\r\nSimoun proceeded to relate how he had been intercepted by a band of\r\ntulisanes, who, after entertaining him for a day, had let him go on his\r\nway without exacting other ransom than his two fine revolvers and the\r\ntwo boxes of cartridges he carried with him. He added that the\r\ntulisanes had charged him with many kind regards for his Excellency,\r\nthe Captain-General.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this, and as Simoun reported that the tulisanes were\r\nwell provided with shotguns, rifles, and revolvers, and against such\r\npersons one man alone, no matter how well armed, could not defend\r\nhimself, his Excellency, to prevent the tulisanes from getting weapons\r\nin the future, was about to dictate a new decree forbidding the\r\nintroduction of sporting arms.\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, on the contrary!” protested Simoun, “for me the\r\ntulisanes are the most respectable men in the country, they’re the only\r\nones who earn their living honestly. Suppose I had fallen into the\r\nhands—well, of you yourselves, for example, would you have let me\r\nescape without taking half of my jewels, at least?”\r\n\r\nDon Custodio was on the point of protesting; that Simoun was really a\r\nrude American mulatto taking advantage of his friendship with the\r\nCaptain-General to insult Padre Irene, although it may be true also\r\nthat Padre Irene would hardly have set him free for so little.\r\n\r\n“The evil is not,” went on Simoun, “in that there are tulisanes in the\r\nmountains and uninhabited parts—the evil lies in the tulisanes in the\r\ntowns and cities.”\r\n\r\n“Like yourself,” put in the Canon with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Yes, like myself, like all of us! Let’s be frank, for no Indian is\r\nlistening to us here,” continued the jeweler. “The evil is that we’re\r\nnot all openly declared tulisanes. When that happens and we all take to\r\nthe woods, on that day the country will be saved, on that day will rise\r\na new social order which will take care of itself, and his Excellency\r\nwill be able to play his game in peace, without the necessity of having\r\nhis attention diverted by his secretary.”\r\n\r\nThe person mentioned at that moment yawned, extending his folded arms\r\nabove his head and stretching his crossed legs under the table as far\r\nas possible, upon noticing which all laughed. His Excellency wished to\r\nchange the course of the conversation, so, throwing down the cards he\r\nhad been shuffling, he said half seriously: “Come, come, enough of\r\njokes and cards! Let’s get to work, to work in earnest, since we still\r\nhave a half-hour before breakfast. Are there many matters to be got\r\nthrough with?”\r\n\r\nAll now gave their attention. That was the day for joining battle over\r\nthe question of instruction in Castilian, for which purpose Padre\r\nSibyla and Padre Irene had been there several days. It was known that\r\nthe former, as Vice-Rector, was opposed to the project and that the\r\nlatter supported it, and his activity was in turn supported by the\r\nCountess.\r\n\r\n“What is there, what is there?” asked his Excellency impatiently.\r\n\r\n“The petition about sporting arms,” replied the secretary with a\r\nstifled yawn.\r\n\r\n“Forbidden!”\r\n\r\n“Pardon, General,” said the high official gravely, “your Excellency\r\nwill permit me to invite your attention to the fact that the use of\r\nsporting arms is permitted in all the countries of the world.”\r\n\r\nThe General shrugged his shoulders and remarked dryly, “We are not\r\nimitating any nation in the world.”\r\n\r\nBetween his Excellency and the high official there was always a\r\ndifference of opinion, so it was sufficient that the latter offer any\r\nsuggestion whatsoever to have the former remain stubborn.\r\n\r\nThe high official tried another tack. “Sporting arms can harm only rats\r\nand chickens. They’ll say—”\r\n\r\n“But are we chickens?” interrupted the General, again shrugging his\r\nshoulders. “Am I? I’ve demonstrated that I’m not.”\r\n\r\n“But there’s another thing,” observed the secretary. “Four months ago,\r\nwhen the possession of arms was prohibited, the foreign importers were\r\nassured that sporting arms would be admitted.”\r\n\r\nHis Excellency knitted his brows.\r\n\r\n“That can be arranged,” suggested Simoun.\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“Very simply. Sporting arms nearly all have a caliber of six\r\nmillimeters, at least those now in the market. Authorize only the sale\r\nof those that haven’t these six millimeters.”\r\n\r\nAll approved this idea of Simoun’s, except the high official, who\r\nmuttered into Padre Fernandez’s ear that this was not dignified, nor\r\nwas it the way to govern.\r\n\r\n“The schoolmaster of Tiani,” proceeded the secretary, shuffling some\r\npapers about, “asks for a better location for—”\r\n\r\n“What better location can he want than the storehouse that he has all\r\nto himself?” interrupted Padre Camorra, who had returned, having\r\nforgotten about the card-game.\r\n\r\n“He says that it’s roofless,” replied the secretary, “and that having\r\npurchased out of his own pocket some maps and pictures, he doesn’t want\r\nto expose them to the weather.”\r\n\r\n“But I haven’t anything to do with that,” muttered his Excellency. “He\r\nshould address the head secretary, [22] the governor of the province,\r\nor the nuncio.”\r\n\r\n“I want to tell you,” declared Padre Camorra, “that this little\r\nschoolmaster is a discontented filibuster. Just imagine—the heretic\r\nteaches that corpses rot just the same, whether buried with great pomp\r\nor without any! Some day I’m going to punch him!” Here he doubled up\r\nhis fists.\r\n\r\n“To tell the truth,” observed Padre Sibyla, as if speaking only to\r\nPadre Irene, “he who wishes to teach, teaches everywhere, in the open\r\nair. Socrates taught in the public streets, Plato in the gardens of the\r\nAcademy, even Christ among the mountains and lakes.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard several complaints against this schoolmaster,” said his\r\nExcellency, exchanging a glance with Simoun. “I think the best thing\r\nwould be to suspend him.”\r\n\r\n“Suspended!” repeated the secretary.\r\n\r\nThe luck of that unfortunate, who had asked for help and received his\r\ndismissal, pained the high official and he tried to do something for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“It’s certain,” he insinuated rather timidly, “that education is not at\r\nall well provided for—”\r\n\r\n“I’ve already decreed large sums for the purchase of supplies,”\r\nexclaimed his Excellency haughtily, as if to say, “I’ve done more than\r\nI ought to have done.”\r\n\r\n“But since suitable locations are lacking, the supplies purchased get\r\nruined.”\r\n\r\n“Everything can’t be done at once,” said his Excellency dryly. “The\r\nschoolmasters here are doing wrong in asking for buildings when those\r\nin Spain starve to death. It’s great presumption to be better off here\r\nthan in the mother country itself!”\r\n\r\n“Filibusterism—”\r\n\r\n“Before everything the fatherland! Before everything else we are\r\nSpaniards!” added Ben-Zayb, his eyes glowing with patriotism, but he\r\nblushed somewhat when he noticed that he was speaking alone.\r\n\r\n“In the future,” decided the General, “all who complain will be\r\nsuspended.”\r\n\r\n“If my project were accepted—” Don Custodio ventured to remark, as if\r\ntalking to himself.\r\n\r\n“For the construction of schoolhouses?”\r\n\r\n“It’s simple, practical, economical, and, like all my projects, derived\r\nfrom long experience and knowledge of the country. The towns would have\r\nschools without costing the government a cuarto.”\r\n\r\n“That’s easy,” observed the secretary sarcastically. “Compel the towns\r\nto construct them at their own expense,” whereupon all laughed.\r\n\r\n“No, sir! No, sir!” cried the exasperated Don Custodio, turning very\r\nred. “The buildings are already constructed and only wait to be\r\nutilized. Hygienic, unsurpassable, spacious—”\r\n\r\nThe friars looked at one another uneasily. Would Don Custodio propose\r\nthat the churches and conventos be converted into schoolhouses?\r\n\r\n“Let’s hear it,” said the General with a frown.\r\n\r\n“Well, General, it’s very simple,” replied Don Custodio, drawing\r\nhimself up and assuming his hollow voice of ceremony. “The schools are\r\nopen only on week-days and the cockpits on holidays. Then convert these\r\ninto schoolhouses, at least during the week.”\r\n\r\n“Man, man, man!”\r\n\r\n“What a lovely idea!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with you, Don Custodio?”\r\n\r\n“That’s a grand suggestion!”\r\n\r\n“That beats them all!”\r\n\r\n“But, gentlemen,” cried Don Custodio, in answer to so many\r\nexclamations, “let’s be practical—what places are more suitable than\r\nthe cockpits? They’re large, well constructed, and under a curse for\r\nthe use to which they are put during the week-days. From a moral\r\nstandpoint my project would be acceptable, by serving as a kind of\r\nexpiation and weekly purification of the temple of chance, as we might\r\nsay.”\r\n\r\n“But the fact remains that sometimes there are cockfights during the\r\nweek,” objected Padre Camorra, “and it wouldn’t be right when the\r\ncontractors of the cockpits pay the government—” [23]\r\n\r\n“Well, on those days close the school!”\r\n\r\n“Man, man!” exclaimed the scandalized Captain-General. “Such an outrage\r\nshall never be perpetrated while I govern! To close the schools in\r\norder to gamble! Man, man, I’ll resign first!” His Excellency was\r\nreally horrified.\r\n\r\n“But, General, it’s better to close them for a few days than for\r\nmonths.”\r\n\r\n“It would be immoral,” observed Padre Irene, more indignant even than\r\nhis Excellency.\r\n\r\n“It’s more immoral that vice has good buildings and learning none.\r\nLet’s be practical, gentlemen, and not be carried away by sentiment. In\r\npolitics there’s nothing worse than sentiment. While from humane\r\nconsiderations we forbid the cultivation of opium in our colonies, we\r\ntolerate the smoking of it, and the result is that we do not combat the\r\nvice but impoverish ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“But remember that it yields to the government, without any effort,\r\nmore than four hundred and fifty thousand pesos,” objected Padre Irene,\r\nwho was getting more and more on the governmental side.\r\n\r\n“Enough, enough, enough!” exclaimed his Excellency, to end the\r\ndiscussion. “I have my own plans in this regard and will devote special\r\nattention to the matter of public instruction. Is there anything else?”\r\n\r\nThe secretary looked uneasily toward Padre Sibyla and Padre Irene. The\r\ncat was about to come out of the bag. Both prepared themselves.\r\n\r\n“The petition of the students requesting authorization to open an\r\nacademy of Castilian,” answered the secretary.\r\n\r\nA general movement was noted among those in the room. After glancing at\r\none another they fixed their eyes on the General to learn what his\r\ndisposition would be. For six months the petition had lain there\r\nawaiting a decision and had become converted into a kind of casus belli\r\nin certain circles. His Excellency had lowered his eyes, as if to keep\r\nhis thoughts from being read.\r\n\r\nThe silence became embarrassing, as the General understood, so he asked\r\nthe high official, “What do you think?”\r\n\r\n“What should I think, General?” responded the person addressed, with a\r\nshrug of his shoulders and a bitter smile. “What should I think but\r\nthat the petition is just, very just, and that I am surprised that six\r\nmonths should have been taken to consider it.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is that it involves other considerations,” said Padre Sibyla\r\ncoldly, as he half closed his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe high official again shrugged his shoulders, like one who did not\r\ncomprehend what those considerations could be.\r\n\r\n“Besides the intemperateness of the demand,” went on the Dominican,\r\n“besides the fact that it is in the nature of an infringement on our\r\nprerogatives—”\r\n\r\nPadre Sibyla dared not go on, but looked at Simoun.\r\n\r\n“The petition has a somewhat suspicious character,” corroborated that\r\nindividual, exchanging a look with the Dominican, who winked several\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nPadre Irene noticed these things and realized that his cause was almost\r\nlost—Simoun was against him.\r\n\r\n“It’s a peaceful rebellion, a revolution on stamped paper,” added Padre\r\nSibyla.\r\n\r\n“Revolution? Rebellion?” inquired the high official, staring from one\r\nto the other as if he did not understand what they could mean.\r\n\r\n“It’s headed by some young men charged with being too radical and too\r\nmuch interested in reforms, not to use stronger terms,” remarked the\r\nsecretary, with a look at the Dominican. “Among them is a certain\r\nIsagani, a poorly balanced head, nephew of a native priest—”\r\n\r\n“He’s a pupil of mine,” put in Padre Fernandez, “and I’m much pleased\r\nwith him.”\r\n\r\n“Puñales, I like your taste!” exclaimed Padre Camorra. “On the steamer\r\nwe nearly had a fight. He’s so insolent that when I gave him a shove\r\naside he returned it.”\r\n\r\n“There’s also one Makaragui or Makarai—”\r\n\r\n“Makaraig,” Padre Irene joined in. “A very pleasant and agreeable young\r\nman.”\r\n\r\nThen he murmured into the General’s ear, “He’s the one I’ve talked to\r\nyou about, he’s very rich. The Countess recommends him strongly.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“A medical student, one Basilio—”\r\n\r\n“Of that Basilio, I’ll say nothing,” observed Padre Irene, raising his\r\nhands and opening them, as if to say Dominus vobiscum. “He’s too deep\r\nfor me. I’ve never succeeded in fathoming what he wants or what he is\r\nthinking about. It’s a pity that Padre Salvi isn’t present to tell us\r\nsomething about his antecedents. I believe that I’ve heard that when a\r\nboy he got into trouble with the Civil Guard. His father was killed\r\nin—I don’t remember what disturbance.”\r\n\r\nSimoun smiled faintly, silently, showing his sharp white teeth.\r\n\r\n“Aha! Aha!” said his Excellency nodding. “That’s the kind we have! Make\r\na note of that name.”\r\n\r\n“But, General,” objected the high official, seeing that the matter was\r\ntaking a bad turn, “up to now nothing positive is known against these\r\nyoung men. Their position is a very just one, and we have no right to\r\ndeny it on the ground of mere conjectures. My opinion is that the\r\ngovernment, by exhibiting confidence in the people and in its own\r\nstability, should grant what is asked, then it could freely revoke the\r\npermission when it saw that its kindness was being abused—reasons and\r\npretexts would not be wanting, we can watch them. Why cause\r\ndisaffection among some young men, who later on may feel resentment,\r\nwhen what they ask is commanded by royal decrees?”\r\n\r\nPadre Irene, Don Custodio, and Padre Fernandez nodded in agreement.\r\n\r\n“But the Indians must not understand Castilian, you know,” cried Padre\r\nCamorra. “They mustn’t learn it, for then they’ll enter into arguments\r\nwith us, and the Indians must not argue, but obey and pay. They mustn’t\r\ntry to interpret the meaning of the laws and the books, they’re so\r\ntricky and pettifogish! Just as soon as they learn Castilian they\r\nbecome enemies of God and of Spain. Just read the Tandang Basio\r\nMacunat—that’s a book! It tells truths like this!” And he held up his\r\nclenched fists.\r\n\r\nPadre Sibyla rubbed his hand over his tonsure in sign of impatience.\r\n“One word,” he began in the most conciliatory tone, though fuming with\r\nirritation, “here we’re not dealing with the instruction in Castilian\r\nalone. Here there is an underhand fight between the students and the\r\nUniversity of Santo Tomas. If the students win this, our prestige will\r\nbe trampled in the dirt, they will say that they’ve beaten us and will\r\nexult accordingly. Then, good-by to moral strength, good-by to\r\neverything! The first dike broken down, who will restrain this youth?\r\nWith our fall we do no more than signal your own. After us, the\r\ngovernment!”\r\n\r\n“Puñales, that’s not so!” exclaimed Padre Camorra. “We’ll see first who\r\nhas the biggest fists!”\r\n\r\nAt this point Padre Fernandez, who thus far in the discussion had\r\nmerely contented himself with smiling, began to talk. All gave him\r\ntheir attention, for they knew him to be a thoughtful man.\r\n\r\n“Don’t take it ill of me, Padre Sibyla, if I differ from your view of\r\nthe affair, but it’s my peculiar fate to be almost always in opposition\r\nto my brethren. I say, then, that we ought not to be so pessimistic.\r\nThe instruction in Castilian can be allowed without any risk whatever,\r\nand in order that it may not appear to be a defeat of the University,\r\nwe Dominicans ought to put forth our efforts and be the first to\r\nrejoice over it—that should be our policy. To what end are we to be\r\nengaged in an everlasting struggle with the people, when after all we\r\nare the few and they are the many, when we need them and they do not\r\nneed us? Wait, Padre Camorra, wait! Admit that now the people may be\r\nweak and ignorant—I also believe that—but it will not be true tomorrow\r\nor the day after. Tomorrow and the next day they will be the stronger,\r\nthey will know what is good for them, and we cannot keep it from them,\r\njust as it is not possible to keep from children the knowledge of many\r\nthings when they reach a certain age. I say, then, why should we not\r\ntake advantage of this condition of ignorance to change our policy\r\ncompletely, to place it upon a basis solid and enduring—on the basis of\r\njustice, for example, instead of on the basis of ignorance? There’s\r\nnothing like being just; that I’ve always said to my brethren, but they\r\nwon’t believe me. The Indian idolizes justice, like every race in its\r\nyouth; he asks for punishment when he has done wrong, just as he is\r\nexasperated when he has not deserved it. Is theirs a just desire? Then\r\ngrant it! Let’s give them all the schools they want, until they are\r\ntired of them. Youth is lazy, and what urges them to activity is our\r\nopposition. Our bond of prestige, Padre Sibyla, is about worn out, so\r\nlet’s prepare another, the bond of gratitude, for example. Let’s not be\r\nfools, let’s do as the crafty Jesuits—”\r\n\r\n“Padre Fernandez!” Anything could be tolerated by Padre Sibyla except\r\nto propose the Jesuits to him as a model. Pale and trembling, he broke\r\nout into bitter recrimination. “A Franciscan first! Anything before a\r\nJesuit!” He was beside himself.\r\n\r\n“Oh, oh!”\r\n\r\n“Eh, Padre—”\r\n\r\nA general discussion broke out, regardless of the Captain-General. All\r\ntalked at once, they yelled, they misunderstood and contradicted one\r\nanother. Ben-Zayb and Padre Camorra shook their fists in each other’s\r\nfaces, one talking of simpletons and the other of ink-slingers, Padre\r\nSibyla kept harping on the Capitulum, and Padre Fernandez on the Summa\r\nof St. Thomas, until the curate of Los Baños entered to announce that\r\nbreakfast was served.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency arose and so ended the discussion. “Well, gentlemen,” he\r\nsaid, “we’ve worked like niggers and yet we’re on a vacation. Some one\r\nhas said that grave matters should be considered at dessert. I’m\r\nentirely of that opinion.”\r\n\r\n“We might get indigestion,” remarked the secretary, alluding to the\r\nheat of the discussion.\r\n\r\n“Then we’ll lay it aside until tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nAs they rose the high official whispered to the General, “Your\r\nExcellency, the daughter of Cabesang Tales has been here again begging\r\nfor the release of her sick grandfather, who was arrested in place of\r\nher father.”\r\n\r\nHis Excellency looked at him with an expression of impatience and\r\nrubbed his hand across his broad forehead. “Carambas! Can’t one be left\r\nto eat his breakfast in peace?”\r\n\r\n“This is the third day she has come. She’s a poor girl—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the devil!” exclaimed Padre Camorra. “I’ve just thought of it. I\r\nhave something to say to the General about that—that’s what I came over\r\nfor—to support that girl’s petition.”\r\n\r\nThe General scratched the back of his ear and said, “Oh, go along! Have\r\nthe secretary make out an order to the lieutenant of the Civil Guard\r\nfor the old man’s release. They sha’n’t say that we’re not clement and\r\nmerciful.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at Ben-Zayb. The journalist winked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nPLACIDO PENITENTE\r\n\r\n\r\nReluctantly, and almost with tearful eyes, Placido Penitente was going\r\nalong the Escolta on his way to the University of Santo Tomas. It had\r\nhardly been a week since he had come from his town, yet he had already\r\nwritten to his mother twice, reiterating his desire to abandon his\r\nstudies and go back there to work. His mother answered that he should\r\nhave patience, that at the least he must be graduated as a bachelor of\r\narts, since it would be unwise to desert his books after four years of\r\nexpense and sacrifices on both their parts.\r\n\r\nWhence came to Penitente this aversion to study, when he had been one\r\nof the most diligent in the famous college conducted by Padre Valerio\r\nin Tanawan? There Penitente had been considered one of the best\r\nLatinists and the subtlest disputants, one who could tangle or untangle\r\nthe simplest as well as the most abstruse questions. His townspeople\r\nconsidered him very clever, and his curate, influenced by that opinion,\r\nalready classified him as a filibuster—a sure proof that he was neither\r\nfoolish nor incapable. His friends could not explain those desires for\r\nabandoning his studies and returning: he had no sweethearts, was not a\r\ngambler, hardly knew anything about hunkían and rarely tried his luck\r\nat the more familiar revesino. He did not believe in the advice of the\r\ncurates, laughed at Tandang Basio Macunat, had plenty of money and good\r\nclothes, yet he went to school reluctantly and looked with repugnance\r\non his books.\r\n\r\nOn the Bridge of Spain, a bridge whose name alone came from Spain,\r\nsince even its ironwork came from foreign countries, he fell in with\r\nthe long procession of young men on their way to the Walled City to\r\ntheir respective schools. Some were dressed in the European fashion and\r\nwalked rapidly, carrying books and notes, absorbed in thoughts of their\r\nlessons and essays—these were the students of the Ateneo. Those from\r\nSan Juan de Letran were nearly all dressed in the Filipino costume, but\r\nwere more numerous and carried fewer books. Those from the University\r\nare dressed more carefully and elegantly and saunter along carrying\r\ncanes instead of books. The collegians of the Philippines are not very\r\nnoisy or turbulent. They move along in a preoccupied manner, such that\r\nupon seeing them one would say that before their eyes shone no hope, no\r\nsmiling future. Even though here and there the line is brightened by\r\nthe attractive appearance of the schoolgirls of the Escuela Municipal,\r\n[24] with their sashes across their shoulders and their books in their\r\nhands, followed by their servants, yet scarcely a laugh resounds or a\r\njoke can be heard—nothing of song or jest, at best a few heavy jokes or\r\nscuffles among the smaller boys. The older ones nearly always proceed\r\nseriously and composedly, like the German students.\r\n\r\nPlacido was proceeding along the Paseo de Magallanes toward the\r\nbreach—formerly the gate—of Santo Domingo, when he suddenly felt a slap\r\non the shoulder, which made him turn quickly in ill humor.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Penitente! Hello, Penitente!”\r\n\r\nIt was his schoolmate Juanito Pelaez, the barbero or pet of the\r\nprofessors, as big a rascal as he could be, with a roguish look and a\r\nclownish smile. The son of a Spanish mestizo—a rich merchant in one of\r\nthe suburbs, who based all his hopes and joys on the boy’s talent—he\r\npromised well with his roguery, and, thanks to his custom of playing\r\ntricks on every one and then hiding behind his companions, he had\r\nacquired a peculiar hump, which grew larger whenever he was laughing\r\nover his deviltry.\r\n\r\n“What kind of time did you have, Penitente?” was his question as he\r\nagain slapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“So, so,” answered Placido, rather bored. “And you?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it was great! Just imagine—the curate of Tiani invited me to\r\nspend the vacation in his town, and I went. Old man, you know Padre\r\nCamorra, I suppose? Well, he’s a liberal curate, very jolly, frank,\r\nvery frank, one of those like Padre Paco. As there were pretty girls,\r\nwe serenaded them all, he with his guitar and songs and I with my\r\nviolin. I tell you, old man, we had a great time—there wasn’t a house\r\nwe didn’t try!”\r\n\r\nHe whispered a few words in Placido’s ear and then broke out into\r\nlaughter. As the latter exhibited some surprise, he resumed: “I’ll\r\nswear to it! They can’t help themselves, because with a governmental\r\norder you get rid of the father, husband, or brother, and then—merry\r\nChristmas! However, we did run up against a little fool, the\r\nsweetheart, I believe, of Basilio, you know? Look, what a fool this\r\nBasilio is! To have a sweetheart who doesn’t know a word of Spanish,\r\nwho hasn’t any money, and who has been a servant! She’s as shy as she\r\ncan be, but pretty. Padre Camorra one night started to club two fellows\r\nwho were serenading her and I don’t know how it was he didn’t kill\r\nthem, yet with all that she was just as shy as ever. But it’ll result\r\nfor her as it does with all the women, all of them!”\r\n\r\nJuanito Pelaez laughed with a full mouth, as though he thought this a\r\nglorious thing, while Placido stared at him in disgust.\r\n\r\n“Listen, what did the professor explain yesterday?” asked Juanito,\r\nchanging the conversation.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday there was no class.”\r\n\r\n“Oho, and the day before yesterday?”\r\n\r\n“Man, it was Thursday!”\r\n\r\n“Right! What an ass I am! Don’t you know, Placido, that I’m getting to\r\nbe a regular ass? What about Wednesday?”\r\n\r\n“Wednesday? Wait—Wednesday, it was a little wet.”\r\n\r\n“Fine! What about Tuesday, old man?”\r\n\r\n“Tuesday was the professor’s nameday and we went to entertain him with\r\nan orchestra, present him flowers and some gifts.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, carambas!” exclaimed Juanito, “that I should have forgotten about\r\nit! What an ass I am! Listen, did he ask for me?”\r\n\r\nPenitente shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know, but they gave him a\r\nlist of his entertainers.”\r\n\r\n“Carambas! Listen—Monday, what happened?”\r\n\r\n“As it was the first school-day, he called the roll and assigned the\r\nlesson—about mirrors. Look, from here to here, by memory, word for\r\nword. We jump all this section, we take that.” He was pointing out with\r\nhis finger in the “Physics” the portions that were to be learned, when\r\nsuddenly the book flew through the air, as a result of the slap Juanito\r\ngave it from below.\r\n\r\n“Thunder, let the lessons go! Let’s have a dia pichido!”\r\n\r\nThe students in Manila call dia pichido a school-day that falls between\r\ntwo holidays and is consequently suppressed, as though forced out by\r\ntheir wish.\r\n\r\n“Do you know that you really are an ass?” exclaimed Placido, picking up\r\nhis book and papers.\r\n\r\n“Let’s have a dia pichido!” repeated Juanito.\r\n\r\nPlacido was unwilling, since for only two the authorities were hardly\r\ngoing to suspend a class of more than a hundred and fifty. He recalled\r\nthe struggles and privations his mother was suffering in order to keep\r\nhim in Manila, while she went without even the necessities of life.\r\n\r\nThey were just passing through the breach of Santo Domingo, and\r\nJuanito, gazing across the little plaza [25] in front of the old\r\nCustoms building, exclaimed, “Now I think of it, I’m appointed to take\r\nup the collection.”\r\n\r\n“What collection?”\r\n\r\n“For the monument.”\r\n\r\n“What monument?”\r\n\r\n“Get out! For Padre Balthazar, you know.”\r\n\r\n“And who was Padre Balthazar?”\r\n\r\n“Fool! A Dominican, of course—that’s why the padres call on the\r\nstudents. Come on now, loosen up with three or four pesos, so that they\r\nmay see we are sports. Don’t let them say afterwards that in order to\r\nerect a statue they had to dig down into their own pockets. Do,\r\nPlacido, it’s not money thrown away.”\r\n\r\nHe accompanied these words with a significant wink. Placido recalled\r\nthe case of a student who had passed through the entire course by\r\npresenting canary-birds, so he subscribed three pesos.\r\n\r\n“Look now, I’ll write your name plainly so that the professor will read\r\nit, you see—Placido Penitente, three pesos. Ah, listen! In a couple of\r\nweeks comes the nameday of the professor of natural history. You know\r\nthat he’s a good fellow, never marks absences or asks about the lesson.\r\nMan, we must show our appreciation!”\r\n\r\n“That’s right!”\r\n\r\n“Then don’t you think that we ought to give him a celebration? The\r\norchestra must not be smaller than the one you had for the professor of\r\nphysics.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right!”\r\n\r\n“What do you think about making the contribution two pesos? Come,\r\nPlacido, you start it, so you’ll be at the head of the list.”\r\n\r\nThen, seeing that Placido gave the two pesos without hesitation, he\r\nadded, “Listen, put up four, and afterwards I’ll return you two.\r\nThey’ll serve as a decoy.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you’re going to return them to me, why give them to you?\r\nIt’ll be sufficient, for you to write four.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that’s right! What an ass I am! Do you know, I’m getting to be a\r\nregular ass! But let me have them anyhow, so that I can show them.”\r\n\r\nPlacido, in order not to give the lie to the priest who christened him,\r\ngave what was asked, just as they reached the University.\r\n\r\nIn the entrance and along the walks on each side of it were gathered\r\nthe students, awaiting the appearance of the professors. Students of\r\nthe preparatory year of law, of the fifth of the secondary course, of\r\nthe preparatory in medicine, formed lively groups. The latter were\r\neasily distinguished by their clothing and by a certain air that was\r\nlacking in the others, since the greater part of them came from the\r\nAteneo Municipal. Among them could be seen the poet Isagani, explaining\r\nto a companion the theory of the refraction of light. In another group\r\nthey were talking, disputing, citing the statements of the professor,\r\nthe text-books, and scholastic principles; in yet another they were\r\ngesticulating and waving their books in the air or making\r\ndemonstrations with their canes by drawing diagrams on the ground;\r\nfarther on, they were entertaining themselves in watching the pious\r\nwomen go into the neighboring church, all the students making facetious\r\nremarks. An old woman leaning on a young girl limped piously, while the\r\ngirl moved along with downcast eyes, timid and abashed to pass before\r\nso many curious eyes. The old lady, catching up her coffee-colored\r\nskirt, of the Sisterhood of St. Rita, to reveal her big feet and white\r\nstockings, scolded her companion and shot furious glances at the\r\nstaring bystanders.\r\n\r\n“The rascals!” she grunted. “Don’t look at them, keep your eyes down.”\r\n\r\nEverything was noticed; everything called forth jokes and comments. Now\r\nit was a magnificent victoria which stopped at the door to set down a\r\nfamily of votaries on their way to visit the Virgin of the Rosary [26]\r\non her favorite day, while the inquisitive sharpened their eyes to get\r\na glimpse of the shape and size of the young ladies’ feet as they got\r\nout of the carriages; now it was a student who came out of the door\r\nwith devotion still shining in his eyes, for he had passed through the\r\nchurch to beg the Virgin’s help in understanding his lesson and to see\r\nif his sweetheart was there, to exchange a few glances with her and go\r\non to his class with the recollection of her loving eyes.\r\n\r\nSoon there was noticed some movement in the groups, a certain air of\r\nexpectancy, while Isagani paused and turned pale. A carriage drawn by a\r\npair of well-known white horses had stopped at the door. It was that of\r\nPaulita Gomez, and she had already jumped down, light as a bird,\r\nwithout giving the rascals time to see her foot. With a bewitching\r\nwhirl of her body and a sweep of her hand she arranged the folds of her\r\nskirt, shot a rapid and apparently careless glance toward Isagani,\r\nspoke to him and smiled. Doña Victorina descended in her turn, gazed\r\nover her spectacles, saw Juanito Pelaez, smiled, and bowed to him\r\naffably.\r\n\r\nIsagani, flushed with excitement, returned a timid salute, while\r\nJuanito bowed profoundly, took off his hat, and made the same gesture\r\nas the celebrated clown and caricaturist Panza when he received\r\napplause.\r\n\r\n“Heavens, what a girl!” exclaimed one of the students, starting\r\nforward. “Tell the professor that I’m seriously ill.” So Tadeo, as this\r\ninvalid youth was known, entered the church to follow the girl.\r\n\r\nTadeo went to the University every day to ask if the classes would be\r\nheld and each time seemed to be more and more astonished that they\r\nwould. He had a fixed idea of a latent and eternal holiday, and\r\nexpected it to come any day. So each morning, after vainly proposing\r\nthat they play truant, he would go away alleging important business, an\r\nappointment, or illness, just at the very moment when his companions\r\nwere going to their classes. But by some occult, thaumaturgic art Tadeo\r\npassed the examinations, was beloved by the professors, and had before\r\nhim a promising future.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the groups began to move inside, for the professor of\r\nphysics and chemistry had put in his appearance. The students appeared\r\nto be cheated in their hopes and went toward the interior of the\r\nbuilding with exclamations of discontent. Placido went along with the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n“Penitente, Penitente!” called a student with a certain mysterious air.\r\n“Sign this!”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Never mind—sign it!”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Placido that some one was twitching his ears. He recalled\r\nthe story of a cabeza de barangay in his town who, for having signed a\r\ndocument that he did not understand, was kept a prisoner for months and\r\nmonths, and came near to deportation. An uncle of Placido’s, in order\r\nto fix the lesson in his memory, had given him a severe ear-pulling, so\r\nthat always whenever he heard signatures spoken of, his ears reproduced\r\nthe sensation.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me, but I can’t sign anything without first understanding what\r\nit’s about.”\r\n\r\n“What a fool you are! If two celestial carbineers have signed it, what\r\nhave you to fear?”\r\n\r\nThe name of celestial carbineers inspired confidence, being, as it was,\r\na sacred company created to aid God in the warfare against the evil\r\nspirit and to prevent the smuggling of heretical contraband into the\r\nmarkets of the New Zion. [27]\r\n\r\nPlacido was about to sign to make an end of it, because he was in a\r\nhurry,—already his classmates were reciting the O Thoma,—but again his\r\nears twitched, so he said, “After the class! I want to read it first.”\r\n\r\n“It’s very long, don’t you see? It concerns the presentation of a\r\ncounter-petition, or rather, a protest. Don’t you understand? Makaraig\r\nand some others have asked that an academy of Castilian be opened,\r\nwhich is a piece of genuine foolishness—”\r\n\r\n“All right, all right, after awhile. They’re already beginning,”\r\nanswered Placido, trying to get away.\r\n\r\n“But your professor may not call the roll—”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes; but he calls it sometimes. Later on, later on! Besides, I\r\ndon’t want to put myself in opposition to Makaraig.”\r\n\r\n“But it’s not putting yourself in opposition, it’s only—”\r\n\r\nPlacido heard no more, for he was already far away, hurrying to his\r\nclass. He heard the different voices—adsum, adsum—the roll was being\r\ncalled! Hastening his steps he got to the door just as the letter Q was\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n“Tinamáan ñg—!” [28] he muttered, biting his lips.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated about entering, for the mark was already down against him\r\nand was not to be erased. One did not go to the class to learn but in\r\norder not to get this absence mark, for the class was reduced to\r\nreciting the lesson from memory, reading the book, and at the most\r\nanswering a few abstract, profound, captious, enigmatic questions.\r\nTrue, the usual preachment was never lacking—the same as ever, about\r\nhumility, submission, and respect to the clerics, and he, Placido, was\r\nhumble, submissive, and respectful. So he was about to turn away when\r\nhe remembered that the examinations were approaching and his professor\r\nhad not yet asked him a question nor appeared to notice him—this would\r\nbe a good opportunity to attract his attention and become known! To be\r\nknown was to gain a year, for if it cost nothing to suspend one who was\r\nnot known, it required a hard heart not to be touched by the sight of a\r\nyouth who by his daily presence was a reproach over a year of his life\r\nwasted.\r\n\r\nSo Placido went in, not on tiptoe as was his custom, but noisily on his\r\nheels, and only too well did he succeed in his intent! The professor\r\nstared at him, knitted his brows, and shook his head, as though to say,\r\n“Ah, little impudence, you’ll pay for that!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE CLASS IN PHYSICS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe classroom was a spacious rectangular hall with large grated windows\r\nthat admitted an abundance of light and air. Along the two sides\r\nextended three wide tiers of stone covered with wood, filled with\r\nstudents arranged in alphabetical order. At the end opposite the\r\nentrance, under a print of St. Thomas Aquinas, rose the professor’s\r\nchair on an elevated platform with a little stairway on each side. With\r\nthe exception of a beautiful blackboard in a narra frame, scarcely ever\r\nused, since there was still written on it the viva that had appeared on\r\nthe opening day, no furniture, either useful or useless, was to be\r\nseen. The walls, painted white and covered with glazed tiles to prevent\r\nscratches, were entirely bare, having neither a drawing nor a picture,\r\nnor even an outline of any physical apparatus. The students had no need\r\nof any, no one missed the practical instruction in an extremely\r\nexperimental science; for years and years it has been so taught and the\r\ncountry has not been upset, but continues just as ever. Now and then\r\nsome little instrument descended from heaven and was exhibited to the\r\nclass from a distance, like the monstrance to the prostrate\r\nworshipers—look, but touch not! From time to time, when some complacent\r\nprofessor appeared, one day in the year was set aside for visiting the\r\nmysterious laboratory and gazing from without at the puzzling apparatus\r\narranged in glass cases. No one could complain, for on that day there\r\nwere to be seen quantities of brass and glassware, tubes, disks,\r\nwheels, bells, and the like—the exhibition did not get beyond that, and\r\nthe country was not upset.\r\n\r\nBesides, the students were convinced that those instruments had not\r\nbeen purchased for them—the friars would be fools! The laboratory was\r\nintended to be shown to the visitors and the high officials who came\r\nfrom the Peninsula, so that upon seeing it they would nod their heads\r\nwith satisfaction, while their guide would smile, as if to say, “Eh,\r\nyou thought you were going to find some backward monks! Well, we’re\r\nright up with the times—we have a laboratory!”\r\n\r\nThe visitors and high officials, after being handsomely entertained,\r\nwould then write in their Travels or Memoirs: “The Royal and Pontifical\r\nUniversity of Santo Tomas of Manila, in charge of the enlightened\r\nDominican Order, possesses a magnificent physical laboratory for the\r\ninstruction of youth. Some two hundred and fifty students annually\r\nstudy this subject, but whether from apathy, indolence, the limited\r\ncapacity of the Indian, or some other ethnological or incomprehensible\r\nreason, up to now there has not developed a Lavoisier, a Secchi, or a\r\nTyndall, not even in miniature, in the Malay-Filipino race.”\r\n\r\nYet, to be exact, we will say that in this laboratory are held the\r\nclasses of thirty or forty advanced students, under the direction of an\r\ninstructor who performs his duties well enough, but as the greater part\r\nof these students come from the Ateneo of the Jesuits, where science is\r\ntaught practically in the laboratory itself, its utility does not come\r\nto be so great as it would be if it could be utilized by the two\r\nhundred and fifty who pay their matriculation fees, buy their books,\r\nmemorize them, and waste a year to know nothing afterwards. As a\r\nresult, with the exception of some rare usher or janitor who has had\r\ncharge of the museum for years, no one has ever been known to get any\r\nadvantage from the lessons memorized with so great effort.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to the class. The professor was a young Dominican,\r\nwho had filled several chairs in San Juan de Letran with zeal and good\r\nrepute. He had the reputation of being a great logician as well as a\r\nprofound philosopher, and was one of the most promising in his clique.\r\nHis elders treated him with consideration, while the younger men envied\r\nhim, for there were also cliques among them. This was the third year of\r\nhis professorship and, although the first in which he had taught\r\nphysics and chemistry, he already passed for a sage, not only with the\r\ncomplaisant students but also among the other nomadic professors. Padre\r\nMillon did not belong to the common crowd who each year change their\r\nsubject in order to acquire scientific knowledge, students among other\r\nstudents, with the difference only that they follow a single course,\r\nthat they quiz instead of being quizzed, that they have a better\r\nknowledge of Castilian, and that they are not examined at the\r\ncompletion of the course. Padre Millon went deeply into science, knew\r\nthe physics of Aristotle and Padre Amat, read carefully his “Ramos,”\r\nand sometimes glanced at “Ganot.” With all that, he would often shake\r\nhis head with an air of doubt, as he smiled and murmured: “transeat.”\r\nIn regard to chemistry, no common knowledge was attributed to him after\r\nhe had taken as a premise the statement of St. Thomas that water is a\r\nmixture and proved plainly that the Angelic Doctor had long forestalled\r\nBerzelius, Gay-Lussac, Bunsen, and other more or less presumptuous\r\nmaterialists. Moreover, in spite of having been an instructor in\r\ngeography, he still entertained certain doubts as to the rotundity of\r\nthe earth and smiled maliciously when its rotation and revolution\r\naround the sun were mentioned, as he recited the verses\r\n\r\n\r\n       “El mentir de las estrellas\r\n        Es un cómodo mentir.” [29]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe also smiled maliciously in the presence of certain physical theories\r\nand considered visionary, if not actually insane, the Jesuit Secchi, to\r\nwhom he imputed the making of triangulations on the host as a result of\r\nhis astronomical mania, for which reason it was said that he had been\r\nforbidden to celebrate mass. Many persons also noticed in him some\r\naversion to the sciences that he taught, but these vagaries were\r\ntrifles, scholarly and religious prejudices that were easily explained,\r\nnot only by the fact that the physical sciences were eminently\r\npractical, of pure observation and deduction, while his forte was\r\nphilosophy, purely speculative, of abstraction and induction, but also\r\nbecause, like any good Dominican, jealous of the fame of his order, he\r\ncould hardly feel any affection for a science in which none of his\r\nbrethren had excelled—he was the first who did not accept the chemistry\r\nof St. Thomas Aquinas—and in which so much renown had been acquired by\r\nhostile, or rather, let us say, rival orders.\r\n\r\nThis was the professor who that morning called the roll and directed\r\nmany of the students to recite the lesson from memory, word for word.\r\nThe phonographs got into operation, some well, some ill, some\r\nstammering, and received their grades. He who recited without an error\r\nearned a good mark and he who made more than three mistakes a bad mark.\r\n\r\nA fat boy with a sleepy face and hair as stiff and hard as the bristles\r\nof a brush yawned until he seemed to be about to dislocate his jaws,\r\nand stretched himself with his arms extended as though he were in his\r\nbed. The professor saw this and wished to startle him.\r\n\r\n“Eh, there, sleepy-head! What’s this? Lazy, too, so it’s sure you [30]\r\ndon’t know the lesson, ha?”\r\n\r\nPadre Millon not only used the depreciative tu with the students, like\r\na good friar, but he also addressed them in the slang of the markets, a\r\npractise that he had acquired from the professor of canonical law:\r\nwhether that reverend gentleman wished to humble the students or the\r\nsacred decrees of the councils is a question not yet settled, in spite\r\nof the great attention that has been given to it.\r\n\r\nThis question, instead of offending the class, amused them, and many\r\nlaughed—it was a daily occurrence. But the sleeper did not laugh; he\r\narose with a bound, rubbed his eyes, and, as though a steam-engine were\r\nturning the phonograph, began to recite.\r\n\r\n“The name of mirror is applied to all polished surfaces intended to\r\nproduce by the reflection of light the images of the objects placed\r\nbefore said surfaces. From the substances that form these surfaces,\r\nthey are divided into metallic mirrors and glass mirrors—”\r\n\r\n“Stop, stop, stop!” interrupted the professor. “Heavens, what a rattle!\r\nWe are at the point where the mirrors are divided into metallic and\r\nglass, eh? Now if I should present to you a block of wood, a piece of\r\nkamagon for instance, well polished and varnished, or a slab of black\r\nmarble well burnished, or a square of jet, which would reflect the\r\nimages of objects placed before them, how would you classify those\r\nmirrors?”\r\n\r\nWhether he did not know what to answer or did not understand the\r\nquestion, the student tried to get out of the difficulty by\r\ndemonstrating that he knew the lesson, so he rushed on like a torrent.\r\n\r\n“The first are composed of brass or an alloy of different metals and\r\nthe second of a sheet of glass, with its two sides well polished, one\r\nof which has an amalgam of tin adhering to it.”\r\n\r\n“Tut, tut, tut! That’s not it! I say to you ‘Dominus vobiscum,’ and you\r\nanswer me with ‘Requiescat in pace!’ ”\r\n\r\nThe worthy professor then repeated the question in the vernacular of\r\nthe markets, interspersed with cosas and abás at every moment.\r\n\r\nThe poor youth did not know how to get out of the quandary: he doubted\r\nwhether to include the kamagon with the metals, or the marble with\r\nglasses, and leave the jet as a neutral substance, until Juanito Pelaez\r\nmaliciously prompted him:\r\n\r\n“The mirror of kamagon among the wooden mirrors.”\r\n\r\nThe incautious youth repeated this aloud and half the class was\r\nconvulsed with laughter.\r\n\r\n“A good sample of wood you are yourself!” exclaimed the professor,\r\nlaughing in spite of himself. “Let’s see from what you would define a\r\nmirror—from a surface per se, in quantum est superficies, or from a\r\nsubstance that forms the surface, or from the substance upon which the\r\nsurface rests, the raw material, modified by the attribute ‘surface,’\r\nsince it is clear that, surface being an accidental property of bodies,\r\nit cannot exist without substance. Let’s see now—what do you say?”\r\n\r\n“I? Nothing!” the wretched boy was about to reply, for he did not\r\nunderstand what it was all about, confused as he was by so many\r\nsurfaces and so many accidents that smote cruelly on his ears, but a\r\nsense of shame restrained him. Filled with anguish and breaking into a\r\ncold perspiration, he began to repeat between his teeth: “The name of\r\nmirror is applied to all polished surfaces—”\r\n\r\n“Ergo, per te, the mirror is the surface,” angled the professor. “Well,\r\nthen, clear up this difficulty. If the surface is the mirror, it must\r\nbe of no consequence to the ‘essence’ of the mirror what may be found\r\nbehind this surface, since what is behind it does not affect the\r\n‘essence’ that is before it, id est, the surface, quae super faciem\r\nest, quia vocatur superficies, facies ea quae supra videtur. Do you\r\nadmit that or do you not admit it?”\r\n\r\nThe poor youth’s hair stood up straighter than ever, as though acted\r\nupon by some magnetic force.\r\n\r\n“Do you admit it or do you not admit it?”\r\n\r\n“Anything! Whatever you wish, Padre,” was his thought, but he did not\r\ndare to express it from fear of ridicule. That was a dilemma indeed,\r\nand he had never been in a worse one. He had a vague idea that the most\r\ninnocent thing could not be admitted to the friars but that they, or\r\nrather their estates and curacies, would get out of it all the results\r\nand advantages imaginable. So his good angel prompted him to deny\r\neverything with all the energy of his soul and refractoriness of his\r\nhair, and he was about to shout a proud nego, for the reason that he\r\nwho denies everything does not compromise himself in anything, as a\r\ncertain lawyer had once told him; but the evil habit of disregarding\r\nthe dictates of one’s own conscience, of having little faith in legal\r\nfolk, and of seeking aid from others where one is sufficient unto\r\nhimself, was his undoing. His companions, especially Juanito Pelaez,\r\nwere making signs to him to admit it, so he let himself be carried away\r\nby his evil destiny and exclaimed, “Concedo, Padre,” in a voice as\r\nfaltering as though he were saying, “In manus tuas commendo spiritum\r\nmeum.”\r\n\r\n“Concedo antecedentum,” echoed the professor, smiling maliciously.\r\n“Ergo, I can scratch the mercury off a looking-glass, put in its place\r\na piece of bibinka, and we shall still have a mirror, eh? Now what\r\nshall we have?”\r\n\r\nThe youth gazed at his prompters, but seeing them surprised and\r\nspeechless, contracted his features into an expression of bitterest\r\nreproach. “Deus meus, Deus meus, quare dereliquiste me,” said his\r\ntroubled eyes, while his lips muttered “Linintikan!” Vainly he coughed,\r\nfumbled at his shirt-bosom, stood first on one foot and then on the\r\nother, but found no answer.\r\n\r\n“Come now, what have we?” urged the professor, enjoying the effect of\r\nhis reasoning.\r\n\r\n“Bibinka!” whispered Juanito Pelaez. “Bibinka!”\r\n\r\n“Shut up, you fool!” cried the desperate youth, hoping to get out of\r\nthe difficulty by turning it into a complaint.\r\n\r\n“Let’s see, Juanito, if you can answer the question for me,” the\r\nprofessor then said to Pelaez, who was one of his pets.\r\n\r\nThe latter rose slowly, not without first giving Penitente, who\r\nfollowed him on the roll, a nudge that meant, “Don’t forget to prompt\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Nego consequentiam, Padre,” he replied resolutely.\r\n\r\n“Aha, then probo consequentiam! Per te, the polished surface\r\nconstitutes the ‘essence’ of the mirror—”\r\n\r\n“Nego suppositum!” interrupted Juanito, as he felt Placido pulling at\r\nhis coat.\r\n\r\n“How? Per te—”\r\n\r\n“Nego!”\r\n\r\n“Ergo, you believe that what is behind affects what is in front?”\r\n\r\n“Nego!” the student cried with still more ardor, feeling another jerk\r\nat his coat.\r\n\r\nJuanito, or rather Placido, who was prompting him, was unconsciously\r\nadopting Chinese tactics: not to admit the most inoffensive foreigner\r\nin order not to be invaded.\r\n\r\n“Then where are we?” asked the professor, somewhat disconcerted, and\r\nlooking uneasily at the refractory student. “Does the substance behind\r\naffect, or does it not affect, the surface?”\r\n\r\nTo this precise and categorical question, a kind of ultimatum, Juanito\r\ndid not know what to reply and his coat offered no suggestions. In vain\r\nhe made signs to Placido, but Placido himself was in doubt. Juanito\r\nthen took advantage of a moment in which the professor was staring at a\r\nstudent who was cautiously and secretly taking off the shoes that hurt\r\nhis feet, to step heavily on Placido’s toes and whisper, “Tell me,\r\nhurry up, tell me!”\r\n\r\n“I distinguish—Get out! What an ass you are!” yelled Placido\r\nunreservedly, as he stared with angry eyes and rubbed his hand over his\r\npatent-leather shoe.\r\n\r\nThe professor heard the cry, stared at the pair, and guessed what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n“Listen, you meddler,” he addressed Placido, “I wasn’t questioning you,\r\nbut since you think you can save others, let’s see if you can save\r\nyourself, salva te ipsum, and decide this question.”\r\n\r\nJuanito sat down in content, and as a mark of gratitude stuck out his\r\ntongue at his prompter, who had arisen blushing with shame and\r\nmuttering incoherent excuses.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Padre Millon regarded him as one gloating over a favorite\r\ndish. What a good thing it would be to humiliate and hold up to\r\nridicule that dudish boy, always smartly dressed, with head erect and\r\nserene look! It would be a deed of charity, so the charitable professor\r\napplied himself to it with all his heart, slowly repeating the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“The book says that the metallic mirrors are made of brass and an alloy\r\nof different metals—is that true or is it not true?”\r\n\r\n“So the book says, Padre.”\r\n\r\n“Liber dixit, ergo ita est. Don’t pretend that you know more than the\r\nbook does. It then adds that the glass mirrors are made of a sheet of\r\nglass whose two surfaces are well polished, one of them having applied\r\nto it an amalgam of tin, nota bene, an amalgam of tin! Is that true?”\r\n\r\n“If the book says so, Padre.”\r\n\r\n“Is tin a metal?”\r\n\r\n“It seems so, Padre. The book says so.”\r\n\r\n“It is, it is, and the word amalgam means that it is compounded with\r\nmercury, which is also a metal. Ergo, a glass mirror is a metallic\r\nmirror; ergo, the terms of the distinction are confused; ergo, the\r\nclassification is imperfect—how do you explain that, meddler?”\r\n\r\nHe emphasized the ergos and the familiar “you’s” with indescribable\r\nrelish, at the same time winking, as though to say, “You’re done for.”\r\n\r\n“It means that, it means that—” stammered Placido.\r\n\r\n“It means that you haven’t learned the lesson, you petty meddler, you\r\ndon’t understand it yourself, and yet you prompt your neighbor!”\r\n\r\nThe class took no offense, but on the contrary many thought the epithet\r\nfunny and laughed. Placido bit his lips.\r\n\r\n“What’s your name?” the professor asked him.\r\n\r\n“Placido,” was the curt reply.\r\n\r\n“Aha! Placido Penitente, although you look more like Placido the\r\nPrompter—or the Prompted. But, Penitent, I’m going to impose some\r\npenance on you for your promptings.”\r\n\r\nPleased with his play on words, he ordered the youth to recite the\r\nlesson, and the latter, in the state of mind to which he was reduced,\r\nmade more than three mistakes. Shaking his head up and down, the\r\nprofessor slowly opened the register and slowly scanned it while he\r\ncalled off the names in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Palencia—Palomo—Panganiban—Pedraza—Pelado—Pelaez—Penitents, aha!\r\nPlacido Penitente, fifteen unexcused absences—”\r\n\r\nPlacido started up. “Fifteen absences, Padre?”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen unexcused absences,” continued the professor, “so that you\r\nonly lack one to be dropped from the roll.”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen absences, fifteen absences,” repeated Placido in amazement.\r\n“I’ve never been absent more than four times, and with today, perhaps\r\nfive.”\r\n\r\n“Jesso, jesso, monseer,” [31] replied the professor, examining the\r\nyouth over his gold eye-glasses. “You confess that you have missed five\r\ntimes, and God knows if you may have missed oftener. Atqui, as I rarely\r\ncall the roll, every time I catch any one I put five marks against him;\r\nergo, how many are five times five? Have you forgotten the\r\nmultiplication table? Five times five?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty-five.”\r\n\r\n“Correct, correct! Thus you’ve still got away with ten, because I have\r\ncaught you only three times. Huh, if I had caught you every time—Now,\r\nhow many are three times five?”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen.”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen, right you are!” concluded the professor, closing the\r\nregister. “If you miss once more—out of doors with you, get out! Ah,\r\nnow a mark for the failure in the daily lesson.”\r\n\r\nHe again opened the register, sought out the name, and entered the\r\nmark. “Come, only one mark,” he said, “since you hadn’t any before.”\r\n\r\n“But, Padre,” exclaimed Placido, restraining himself, “if your\r\nReverence puts a mark against me for failing in the lesson, your\r\nReverence owes it to me to erase the one for absence that you have put\r\nagainst me for today.”\r\n\r\nHis Reverence made no answer. First he slowly entered the mark, then\r\ncontemplated it with his head on one side,—the mark must be\r\nartistic,—closed the register, and asked with great sarcasm, “Abá, and\r\nwhy so, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Because I can’t conceive, Padre, how one can be absent from the class\r\nand at the same time recite the lesson in it. Your Reverence is saying\r\nthat to be is not to be.”\r\n\r\n“Nakú, a metaphysician, but a rather premature one! So you can’t\r\nconceive of it, eh? Sed patet experientia and contra experientiam\r\nnegantem, fusilibus est arguendum, do you understand? And can’t you\r\nconceive, with your philosophical head, that one can be absent from the\r\nclass and not know the lesson at the same time? Is it a fact that\r\nabsence necessarily implies knowledge? What do you say to that,\r\nphilosophaster?”\r\n\r\nThis last epithet was the drop of water that made the full cup\r\noverflow. Placido enjoyed among his friends the reputation of being a\r\nphilosopher, so he lost his patience, threw down his book, arose, and\r\nfaced the professor.\r\n\r\n“Enough, Padre, enough! Your Reverence can put all the marks against me\r\nthat you wish, but you haven’t the right to insult me. Your Reverence\r\nmay stay with the class, I can’t stand any more.” Without further\r\nfarewell, he stalked away.\r\n\r\nThe class was astounded; such an assumption of dignity had scarcely\r\never been seen, and who would have thought it of Placido Penitente? The\r\nsurprised professor bit his lips and shook his head threateningly as he\r\nwatched him depart. Then in a trembling voice he began his preachment\r\non the same old theme, delivered however with more energy and more\r\neloquence. It dealt with the growing arrogance, the innate ingratitude,\r\nthe presumption, the lack of respect for superiors, the pride that the\r\nspirit of darkness infused in the young, the lack of manners, the\r\nabsence of courtesy, and so on. From this he passed to coarse jests and\r\nsarcasm over the presumption which some good-for-nothing “prompters”\r\nhad of teaching their teachers by establishing an academy for\r\ninstruction in Castilian.\r\n\r\n“Aha, aha!” he moralized, “those who the day before yesterday scarcely\r\nknew how to say, ‘Yes, Padre,’ ‘No, Padre,’ now want to know more than\r\nthose who have grown gray teaching them. He who wishes to learn, will\r\nlearn, academies or no academies! Undoubtedly that fellow who has just\r\ngone out is one of those in the project. Castilian is in good hands\r\nwith such guardians! When are you going to get the time to attend the\r\nacademy if you have scarcely enough to fulfill your duties in the\r\nregular classes? We wish that you may all know Spanish and that you\r\npronounce it well, so that you won’t split our ear-drums with your\r\ntwist of expression and your ‘p’s’; [32] but first business and then\r\npleasure: finish your studies first, and afterwards learn Castilian,\r\nand all become clerks, if you so wish.”\r\n\r\nSo he went on with his harangue until the bell rang and the class was\r\nover. The two hundred and thirty-four students, after reciting their\r\nprayers, went out as ignorant as when they went in, but breathing more\r\nfreely, as if a great weight had been lifted from them. Each youth had\r\nlost another hour of his life and with it a portion of his dignity and\r\nself-respect, and in exchange there was an increase of discontent, of\r\naversion to study, of resentment in their hearts. After all this ask\r\nfor knowledge, dignity, gratitude!\r\n\r\nDe nobis, post haec, tristis sententia fertur!\r\n\r\nJust as the two hundred and thirty-four spent their class hours, so the\r\nthousands of students who preceded them have spent theirs, and, if\r\nmatters do not mend, so will those yet to come spend theirs, and be\r\nbrutalized, while wounded dignity and youthful enthusiasm will be\r\nconverted into hatred and sloth, like the waves that become polluted\r\nalong one part of the shore and roll on one after another, each in\r\nsuccession depositing a larger sediment of filth. But yet He who from\r\neternity watches the consequences of a deed develop like a thread\r\nthrough the loom of the centuries, He who weighs the value of a second\r\nand has ordained for His creatures as an elemental law progress and\r\ndevelopment, He, if He is just, will demand a strict accounting from\r\nthose who must render it, of the millions of intelligences darkened and\r\nblinded, of human dignity trampled upon in millions of His creatures,\r\nand of the incalculable time lost and effort wasted! And if the\r\nteachings of the Gospel are based on truth, so also will these have to\r\nanswer—the millions and millions who do not know how to preserve the\r\nlight of their intelligences and their dignity of mind, as the master\r\ndemanded an accounting from the cowardly servant for the talent that he\r\nlet be taken from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nIN THE HOUSE OF THE STUDENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe house where Makaraig lived was worth visiting. Large and spacious,\r\nwith two entresols provided with elegant gratings, it seemed to be a\r\nschool during the first hours of the morning and pandemonium from ten\r\no’clock on. During the boarders’ recreation hours, from the lower\r\nhallway of the spacious entrance up to the main floor, there was a\r\nbubbling of laughter, shouts, and movement. Boys in scanty clothing\r\nplayed sipa or practised gymnastic exercises on improvised trapezes,\r\nwhile on the staircase a fight was in progress between eight or nine\r\narmed with canes, sticks, and ropes, but neither attackers nor attacked\r\ndid any great damage, their blows generally falling sidewise upon the\r\nshoulders of the Chinese pedler who was there selling his outlandish\r\nmixtures and indigestible pastries. Crowds of boys surrounded him,\r\npulled at his already disordered queue, snatched pies from him, haggled\r\nover the prices, and committed a thousand deviltries. The Chinese\r\nyelled, swore, forswore, in all the languages he could jabber, not\r\nomitting his own; he whimpered, laughed, pleaded, put on a smiling face\r\nwhen an ugly one would not serve, or the reverse.\r\n\r\nHe cursed them as devils, savages, no kilistanos [33] but that mattered\r\nnothing. A whack would bring his face around smiling, and if the blow\r\nfell only upon his shoulders he would calmly continue his business\r\ntransactions, contenting himself with crying out to them that he was\r\nnot in the game, but if it struck the flat basket on which were placed\r\nhis wares, then he would swear never to come again, as he poured out\r\nupon them all the imprecations and anathemas imaginable. Then the boys\r\nwould redouble their efforts to make him rage the more, and when at\r\nlast his vocabulary was exhausted and they were satiated with his\r\nfearful mixtures, they paid him religiously, and sent him away happy,\r\nwinking, chuckling to himself, and receiving as caresses the light\r\nblows from their canes that the students gave him as tokens of\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\nConcerts on the piano and violin, the guitar, and the accordion,\r\nalternated with the continual clashing of blades from the fencing\r\nlessons. Around a long, wide table the students of the Ateneo prepared\r\ntheir compositions or solved their problems by the side of others\r\nwriting to their sweethearts on pink perforated note-paper covered with\r\ndrawings. Here one was composing a melodrama at the side of another\r\npractising on the flute, from which he drew wheezy notes. Over there,\r\nthe older boys, students in professional courses, who affected silk\r\nsocks and embroidered slippers, amused themselves in teasing the\r\nsmaller boys by pulling their ears, already red from repeated fillips,\r\nwhile two or three held down a little fellow who yelled and cried,\r\ndefending himself with his feet against being reduced to the condition\r\nin which he was born, kicking and howling. In one room, around a small\r\ntable, four were playing revesino with laughter and jokes, to the great\r\nannoyance of another who pretended to be studying his lesson but who\r\nwas in reality waiting his turn to play.\r\n\r\nStill another came in with exaggerated wonder, scandalized as he\r\napproached the table. “How wicked you are! So early in the morning and\r\nalready gambling! Let’s see, let’s see! You fool, take it with the\r\nthree of spades!” Closing his book, he too joined in the game.\r\n\r\nCries and blows were heard. Two boys were fighting in the adjoining\r\nroom—a lame student who was very sensitive about his infirmity and an\r\nunhappy newcomer from the provinces who was just commencing his\r\nstudies. He was working over a treatise on philosophy and reading\r\ninnocently in a loud voice, with a wrong accent, the Cartesian\r\nprinciple: “Cogito, ergo sum!”\r\n\r\nThe little lame boy (el cojito) took this as an insult and the others\r\nintervened to restore peace, but in reality only to sow discord and\r\ncome to blows themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the dining-room a young man with a can of sardines, a bottle of\r\nwine, and the provisions that he had just brought from his town, was\r\nmaking heroic efforts to the end that his friends might participate in\r\nhis lunch, while they were offering in their turn heroic resistance to\r\nhis invitation. Others were bathing on the azotea, playing firemen with\r\nthe water from the well, and joining in combats with pails of water, to\r\nthe great delight of the spectators.\r\n\r\nBut the noise and shouts gradually died away with the coming of leading\r\nstudents, summoned by Makaraig to report to them the progress of the\r\nacademy of Castilian. Isagani was cordially greeted, as was also the\r\nPeninsular, Sandoval, who had come to Manila as a government employee\r\nand was finishing his studies, and who had completely identified\r\nhimself with the cause of the Filipino students. The barriers that\r\npolitics had established between the races had disappeared in the\r\nschoolroom as though dissolved by the zeal of science and youth.\r\n\r\nFrom lack of lyceums and scientific, literary, or political centers,\r\nSandoval took advantage of all the meetings to cultivate his great\r\noratorical gifts, delivering speeches and arguing on any subject, to\r\ndraw forth applause from his friends and listeners. At that moment the\r\nsubject of conversation was the instruction in Castilian, but as\r\nMakaraig had not yet arrived conjecture was still the order of the day.\r\n\r\n“What can have happened?”\r\n\r\n“What has the General decided?”\r\n\r\n“Has he refused the permit?”\r\n\r\n“Has Padre Irene or Padre Sibyla won?”\r\n\r\nSuch were the questions they asked one another, questions that could be\r\nanswered only by Makaraig.\r\n\r\nAmong the young men gathered together there were optimists like Isagani\r\nand Sandoval, who saw the thing already accomplished and talked of\r\ncongratulations and praise from the government for the patriotism of\r\nthe students—outbursts of optimism that led Juanito Pelaez to claim for\r\nhimself a large part of the glory of founding the society.\r\n\r\nAll this was answered by the pessimist Pecson, a chubby youth with a\r\nwide, clownish grin, who spoke of outside influences, whether the\r\nBishop A., the Padre B., or the Provincial C., had been consulted or\r\nnot, whether or not they had advised that the whole association should\r\nbe put in jail—a suggestion that made Juanito Pelaez so uneasy that he\r\nstammered out, “Carambas, don’t you drag me into—”\r\n\r\nSandoval, as a Peninsular and a liberal, became furious at this. “But\r\npshaw!” he exclaimed, “that is holding a bad opinion of his Excellency!\r\nI know that he’s quite a friar-lover, but in such a matter as this he\r\nwon’t let the friars interfere. Will you tell me, Pecson, on what you\r\nbase your belief that the General has no judgment of his own?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say that, Sandoval,” replied Pecson, grinning until he\r\nexposed his wisdom-tooth. “For me the General has his own judgment,\r\nthat is, the judgment of all those within his reach. That’s plain!”\r\n\r\n“You’re dodging—cite me a fact, cite me a fact!” cried Sandoval. “Let’s\r\nget away from hollow arguments, from empty phrases, and get on the\r\nsolid ground of facts,”—this with an elegant gesture. “Facts,\r\ngentlemen, facts! The rest is prejudice—I won’t call it filibusterism.”\r\n\r\nPecson smiled like one of the blessed as he retorted, “There comes the\r\nfilibusterism. But can’t we enter into a discussion without resorting\r\nto accusations?”\r\n\r\nSandoval protested in a little extemporaneous speech, again demanding\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n“Well, not long ago there was a dispute between some private persons\r\nand certain friars, and the acting Governor rendered a decision that it\r\nshould be settled by the Provincial of the Order concerned,” replied\r\nPecson, again breaking out into a laugh, as though he were dealing with\r\nan insignificant matter, he cited names and dates, and promised\r\ndocuments that would prove how justice was dispensed.\r\n\r\n“But, on what ground, tell me this, on what ground can they refuse\r\npermission for what plainly appears to be extremely useful and\r\nnecessary?” asked Sandoval.\r\n\r\nPecson shrugged his shoulders. “It’s that it endangers the integrity of\r\nthe fatherland,” he replied in the tone of a notary reading an\r\nallegation.\r\n\r\n“That’s pretty good! What has the integrity of the fatherland to do\r\nwith the rules of syntax?”\r\n\r\n“The Holy Mother Church has learned doctors—what do I know? Perhaps it\r\nis feared that we may come to understand the laws so that we can obey\r\nthem. What will become of the Philippines on the day when we understand\r\none another?”\r\n\r\nSandoval did not relish the dialectic and jesting turn of the\r\nconversation; along that path could rise no speech worth the while.\r\n“Don’t make a joke of things!” he exclaimed. “This is a serious\r\nmatter.”\r\n\r\n“The Lord deliver me from joking when there are friars concerned!”\r\n\r\n“But, on what do you base—”\r\n\r\n“On the fact that, the hours for the classes having to come at night,”\r\ncontinued Pecson in the same tone, as if he were quoting known and\r\nrecognized formulas, “there may be invoked as an obstacle the\r\nimmorality of the thing, as was done in the case of the school at\r\nMalolos.”\r\n\r\n“Another! But don’t the classes of the Academy of Drawing, and the\r\nnovenaries and the processions, cover themselves with the mantle of\r\nnight?”\r\n\r\n“The scheme affects the dignity of the University,” went on the chubby\r\nyouth, taking no notice of the question.\r\n\r\n“Affects nothing! The University has to accommodate itself to the needs\r\nof the students. And granting that, what is a university then? Is it an\r\ninstitution to discourage study? Have a few men banded themselves\r\ntogether in the name of learning and instruction in order to prevent\r\nothers from becoming enlightened?”\r\n\r\n“The fact is that movements initiated from below are regarded as\r\ndiscontent—”\r\n\r\n“What about projects that come from above?” interpolated one of the\r\nstudents. “There’s the School of Arts and Trades!”\r\n\r\n“Slowly, slowly, gentlemen,” protested Sandoval. “I’m not a\r\nfriar-lover, my liberal views being well known, but render unto Caesar\r\nthat which is Caesar’s. Of that School of Arts and Trades, of which I\r\nhave been the most enthusiastic supporter and the realization of which\r\nI shall greet as the first streak of dawn for these fortunate islands,\r\nof that School of Arts and Trades the friars have taken charge—”\r\n\r\n“Or the cat of the canary, which amounts to the same thing,” added\r\nPecson, in his turn interrupting the speech.\r\n\r\n“Get out!” cried Sandoval, enraged at the interruption, which had\r\ncaused him to lose the thread of his long, well-rounded sentence. “As\r\nlong as we hear nothing bad, let’s not be pessimists, let’s not be\r\nunjust, doubting the liberty and independence of the government.”\r\n\r\nHere he entered upon a defense in beautiful phraseology of the\r\ngovernment and its good intentions, a subject that Pecson dared not\r\nbreak in upon.\r\n\r\n“The Spanish government,” he said among other things, “has given you\r\neverything, it has denied you nothing! We had absolutism in Spain and\r\nyou had absolutism here; the friars covered our soil with conventos,\r\nand conventos occupy a third part of Manila; in Spain the garrote\r\nprevails and here the garrote is the extreme punishment; we are\r\nCatholics and we have made you Catholics; we were scholastics and\r\nscholasticism sheds its light in your college halls; in short,\r\ngentlemen, we weep when you weep, we suffer when you suffer, we have\r\nthe same altars, the same courts, the same punishments, and it is only\r\njust that we should give you our rights and our joys.”\r\n\r\nAs no one interrupted him, he became more and more enthusiastic, until\r\nhe came to speak of the future of the Philippines.\r\n\r\n“As I have said, gentlemen, the dawn is not far distant. Spain is now\r\nbreaking the eastern sky for her beloved Philippines, and the times are\r\nchanging, as I positively know, faster than we imagine. This\r\ngovernment, which, according to you, is vacillating and weak, should be\r\nstrengthened by our confidence, that we may make it see that it is the\r\ncustodian of our hopes. Let us remind it by our conduct (should it ever\r\nforget itself, which I do not believe can happen) that we have faith in\r\nits good intentions and that it should be guided by no other standard\r\nthan justice and the welfare of all the governed. No, gentlemen,” he\r\nwent on in a tone more and more declamatory, “we must not admit at all\r\nin this matter the possibility of a consultation with other more or\r\nless hostile entities, as such a supposition would imply our\r\nresignation to the fact. Your conduct up to the present has been frank,\r\nloyal, without vacillation, above suspicion; you have addressed it\r\nsimply and directly; the reasons you have presented could not be more\r\nsound; your aim is to lighten the labor of the teachers in the first\r\nyears and to facilitate study among the hundreds of students who fill\r\nthe college halls and for whom one solitary professor cannot suffice.\r\nIf up to the present the petition has not been granted, it has been for\r\nthe reason, as I feel sure, that there has been a great deal of\r\nmaterial accumulated, but I predict that the campaign is won, that the\r\nsummons of Makaraig is to announce to us the victory, and tomorrow we\r\nshall see our efforts crowned with the applause and appreciation of the\r\ncountry, and who knows, gentlemen, but that the government may confer\r\nupon you some handsome decoration of merit, benefactors as you are of\r\nthe fatherland!”\r\n\r\nEnthusiastic applause resounded. All immediately believed in the\r\ntriumph, and many in the decoration.\r\n\r\n“Let it be remembered, gentlemen,” observed Juanito, “that I was one of\r\nthe first to propose it.”\r\n\r\nThe pessimist Pecson was not so enthusiastic. “Just so we don’t get\r\nthat decoration on our ankles,” he remarked, but fortunately for Pelaez\r\nthis comment was not heard in the midst of the applause.\r\n\r\nWhen they had quieted down a little, Pecson replied, “Good, good, very\r\ngood, but one supposition: if in spite of all that, the General\r\nconsults and consults and consults, and afterwards refuses the permit?”\r\n\r\nThis question fell like a dash of cold water. All turned to Sandoval,\r\nwho was taken aback. “Then—” he stammered.\r\n\r\n“Then?”\r\n\r\n“Then,” he exclaimed in a burst of enthusiasm, still excited by the\r\napplause, “seeing that in writing and in printing it boasts of desiring\r\nyour enlightenment, and yet hinders and denies it when called upon to\r\nmake it a reality—then, gentlemen, your efforts will not have been in\r\nvain, you will have accomplished what no one else has been able to do.\r\nMake them drop the mask and fling down the gauntlet to you!”\r\n\r\n“Bravo, bravo!” cried several enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n“Good for Sandoval! Hurrah for the gauntlet!” added others.\r\n\r\n“Let them fling down the gauntlet to us!” repeated Pecson disdainfully.\r\n“But afterwards?”\r\n\r\nSandoval seemed to be cut short in his triumph, but with the vivacity\r\npeculiar to his race and his oratorical temperament he had an immediate\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n“Afterwards?” he asked. “Afterwards, if none of the Filipinos dare to\r\naccept the challenge, then I, Sandoval, in the name of Spain, will take\r\nup the gauntlet, because such a policy would give the lie to the good\r\nintentions that she has always cherished toward her provinces, and\r\nbecause he who is thus faithless to the trust reposed in him and abuses\r\nhis unlimited authority deserves neither the protection of the\r\nfatherland nor the support of any Spanish citizen!”\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm of his hearers broke all bounds. Isagani embraced him,\r\nthe others following his example. They talked of the fatherland, of\r\nunion, of fraternity, of fidelity. The Filipinos declared that if there\r\nwere only Sandovals in Spain all would be Sandovals in the Philippines.\r\nHis eyes glistened, and it might well be believed that if at that\r\nmoment any kind of gauntlet had been flung at him he would have leaped\r\nupon any kind of horse to ride to death for the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe “cold water” alone replied: “Good, that’s very good, Sandoval. I\r\ncould also say the same if I were a Peninsular, but not being one, if I\r\nshould say one half of what you have, you yourself would take me for a\r\nfilibuster.”\r\n\r\nSandoval began a speech in protest, but was interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Rejoice, friends, rejoice! Victory!” cried a youth who entered at that\r\nmoment and began to embrace everybody.\r\n\r\n“Rejoice, friends! Long live the Castilian tongue!”\r\n\r\nAn outburst of applause greeted this announcement. They fell to\r\nembracing one another and their eyes filled with tears. Pecson alone\r\npreserved his skeptical smile.\r\n\r\nThe bearer of such good news was Makaraig, the young man at the head of\r\nthe movement. This student occupied in that house, by himself, two\r\nrooms, luxuriously furnished, and had his servant and a cochero to look\r\nafter his carriage and horses. He was of robust carriage, of refined\r\nmanners, fastidiously dressed, and very rich. Although studying law\r\nonly that he might have an academic degree, he enjoyed a reputation for\r\ndiligence, and as a logician in the scholastic way had no cause to envy\r\nthe most frenzied quibblers of the University faculty. Nevertheless he\r\nwas not very far behind in regard to modern ideas and progress, for his\r\nfortune enabled him to have all the books and magazines that a watchful\r\ncensor was unable to keep out. With these qualifications and his\r\nreputation for courage, his fortunate associations in his earlier\r\nyears, and his refined and delicate courtesy, it was not strange that\r\nhe should exercise such great influence over his associates and that he\r\nshould have been chosen to carry out such a difficult undertaking as\r\nthat of the instruction in Castilian.\r\n\r\nAfter the first outburst of enthusiasm, which in youth always takes\r\nhold in such exaggerated forms, since youth finds everything beautiful,\r\nthey wanted to be informed how the affair had been managed.\r\n\r\n“I saw Padre Irene this morning,” said Makaraig with a certain air of\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah for Padre Irene!” cried an enthusiastic student.\r\n\r\n“Padre Irene,” continued Makaraig, “has told me about everything that\r\ntook place at Los Baños. It seems that they disputed for at least a\r\nweek, he supporting and defending our case against all of them, against\r\nPadre Sibyla, Padre Fernandez, Padre Salvi, the General, the jeweler\r\nSimoun—”\r\n\r\n“The jeweler Simoun!” interrupted one of his listeners. “What has that\r\nJew to do with the affairs of our country? We enrich him by buying—”\r\n\r\n“Keep quiet!” admonished another impatiently, anxious to learn how\r\nPadre Irene had been able to overcome such formidable opponents.\r\n\r\n“There were even high officials who were opposed to our project, the\r\nHead Secretary, the Civil Governor, Quiroga the Chinaman—”\r\n\r\n“Quiroga the Chinaman! The pimp of the—”\r\n\r\n“Shut up!”\r\n\r\n“At last,” resumed Makaraig, “they were going to pigeonhole the\r\npetition and let it sleep for months and months, when Padre Irene\r\nremembered the Superior Commission of Primary Instruction and proposed,\r\nsince the matter concerned the teaching of the Castilian tongue, that\r\nthe petition be referred to that body for a report upon it.”\r\n\r\n“But that Commission hasn’t been in operation for a long time,”\r\nobserved Pecson.\r\n\r\n“That’s exactly what they replied to Padre Irene, and he answered that\r\nthis was a good opportunity to revive it, and availing himself of the\r\npresence of Don Custodio, one of its members, he proposed on the spot\r\nthat a committee should be appointed. Don Custodio’s activity being\r\nknown and recognized, he was named as arbiter and the petition is now\r\nin his hands. He promised that he would settle it this month.”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah for Don Custodio!”\r\n\r\n“But suppose Don Custodio should report unfavorably upon it?” inquired\r\nthe pessimist Pecson.\r\n\r\nUpon this they had not reckoned, being intoxicated with the thought\r\nthat the matter would not be pigeonholed, so they all turned to\r\nMakaraig to learn how it could be arranged.\r\n\r\n“The same objection I presented to Padre Irene, but with his sly smile\r\nhe said to me: ‘We’ve won a great deal, we have succeeded in getting\r\nthe matter on the road to a decision, the opposition sees itself forced\r\nto join battle.’ If we can bring some influence to bear upon Don\r\nCustodio so that he, in accordance with his liberal tendencies, may\r\nreport favorably, all is won, for the General showed himself to be\r\nabsolutely neutral.”\r\n\r\nMakaraig paused, and an impatient listener asked, “How can we influence\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\n“Padre Irene pointed out to me two ways—”\r\n\r\n“Quiroga,” some one suggested.\r\n\r\n“Pshaw, great use Quiroga—”\r\n\r\n“A fine present.”\r\n\r\n“No, that won’t do, for he prides himself upon being incorruptible.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, I know!” exclaimed Pecson with a laugh. “Pepay the dancing\r\ngirl.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, Pepay the dancing girl,” echoed several.\r\n\r\nThis Pepay was a showy girl, supposed to be a great friend of Don\r\nCustodio. To her resorted the contractors, the employees, the\r\nintriguers, when they wanted to get something from the celebrated\r\ncouncilor. Juanito Pelaez, who was also a great friend of the dancing\r\ngirl, offered to look after the matter, but Isagani shook his head,\r\nsaying that it was sufficient that they had made use of Padre Irene and\r\nthat it would be going too far to avail themselves of Pepay in such an\r\naffair.\r\n\r\n“Show us the other way.”\r\n\r\n“The other way is to apply to his attorney and adviser, Señor Pasta,\r\nthe oracle before whom Don Custodio bows.”\r\n\r\n“I prefer that,” said Isagani. “Señor Pasta is a Filipino, and was a\r\nschoolmate of my uncle’s. But how can we interest him?”\r\n\r\n“There’s the quid,” replied Makaraig, looking earnestly at Isagani.\r\n“Señor Pasta has a dancing girl—I mean, a seamstress.”\r\n\r\nIsagani again shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be such a puritan,” Juanito Pelaez said to him. “The end\r\njustifies the means! I know the seamstress, Matea, for she has a shop\r\nwhere a lot of girls work.”\r\n\r\n“No, gentlemen,” declared Isagani, “let’s first employ decent methods.\r\nI’ll go to Señor Pasta and, if I don’t accomplish anything, then you\r\ncan do what you wish with the dancing girls and seamstresses.”\r\n\r\nThey had to accept this proposition, agreeing that Isagani should talk\r\nto Señor Pasta that very day, and in the afternoon report to his\r\nassociates at the University the result of the interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSEÑOR PASTA\r\n\r\n\r\nIsagani presented himself in the house of the lawyer, one of the most\r\ntalented minds in Manila, whom the friars consulted in their great\r\ndifficulties. The youth had to wait some time on account of the\r\nnumerous clients, but at last his turn came and he entered the office,\r\nor bufete, as it is generally called in the Philippines. The lawyer\r\nreceived him with a slight cough, looking down furtively at his feet,\r\nbut he did not rise or offer a seat, as he went on writing. This gave\r\nIsagani an opportunity for observation and careful study of the lawyer,\r\nwho had aged greatly. His hair was gray and his baldness extended over\r\nnearly the whole crown of his head. His countenance was sour and\r\naustere.\r\n\r\nThere was complete silence in the study, except for the whispers of the\r\nclerks and understudies who were at work in an adjoining room. Their\r\npens scratched as though quarreling with the paper.\r\n\r\nAt length the lawyer finished what he was writing, laid down his pen,\r\nraised his head, and, recognizing the youth, let his face light up with\r\na smile as he extended his hand affectionately.\r\n\r\n“Welcome, young man! But sit down, and excuse me, for I didn’t know\r\nthat it was you. How is your uncle?”\r\n\r\nIsagani took courage, believing that his case would get on well. He\r\nrelated briefly what had been done, the while studying the effect of\r\nhis words. Señor Pasta listened impassively at first and, although he\r\nwas informed of the efforts of the students, pretended ignorance, as if\r\nto show that he had nothing to do with such childish matters, but when\r\nhe began to suspect what was wanted of him and heard mention of the\r\nVice-Rector, friars, the Captain-General, a project, and so on, his\r\nface slowly darkened and he finally exclaimed, “This is the land of\r\nprojects! But go on, go on!”\r\n\r\nIsagani was not yet discouraged. He spoke of the manner in which a\r\ndecision was to be reached and concluded with an expression of the\r\nconfidence which the young men entertained that he, Señor Pasta, would\r\nintercede in their behalf in case Don Custodio should consult him, as\r\nwas to be expected. He did not dare to say would advise, deterred by\r\nthe wry face the lawyer put on.\r\n\r\nBut Señor Pasta had already formed his resolution, and it was not to\r\nmix at all in the affair, either as consulter or consulted. He was\r\nfamiliar with what had occurred at Los Baños, he knew that there\r\nexisted two factions, and that Padre Irene was not the only champion on\r\nthe side of the students, nor had he been the one who proposed\r\nsubmitting the petition to the Commission of Primary Instruction, but\r\nquite the contrary. Padre Irene, Padre Fernandez, the Countess, a\r\nmerchant who expected to sell the materials for the new academy, and\r\nthe high official who had been citing royal decree after royal decree,\r\nwere about to triumph, when Padre Sibyla, wishing to gain time, had\r\nthought of the Commission. All these facts the great lawyer had present\r\nin his mind, so that when Isagani had finished speaking, he determined\r\nto confuse him with evasions, tangle the matter up, and lead the\r\nconversation to other subjects.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, pursing his lips and scratching his head, “there is no\r\none who surpasses me in love for the country and in aspirations toward\r\nprogress, but—I can’t compromise myself, I don’t know whether you\r\nclearly understand my position, a position that is very delicate, I\r\nhave so many interests, I have to labor within the limits of strict\r\nprudence, it’s a risk—”\r\n\r\nThe lawyer sought to bewilder the youth with an exuberance of words, so\r\nhe went on speaking of laws and decrees, and talked so much that\r\ninstead of confusing the youth, he came very near to entangling himself\r\nin a labyrinth of citations.\r\n\r\n“In no way do we wish to compromise you,” replied Isagani with great\r\ncalmness. “God deliver us from injuring in the least the persons whose\r\nlives are so useful to the rest of the Filipinos! But, as little versed\r\nas I may be in the laws, royal decrees, writs, and resolutions that\r\nobtain in this country, I can’t believe that there can be any harm in\r\nfurthering the high purposes of the government, in trying to secure a\r\nproper interpretation of these purposes. We are seeking the same end\r\nand differ only about the means.”\r\n\r\nThe lawyer smiled, for the youth had allowed himself to wander away\r\nfrom the subject, and there where the former was going to entangle him\r\nhe had already entangled himself.\r\n\r\n“That’s exactly the quid, as is vulgarly said. It’s clear that it is\r\nlaudable to aid the government, when one aids it submissively,\r\nfollowing out its desires and the true spirit of the laws in agreement\r\nwith the just beliefs of the governing powers, and when not in\r\ncontradiction to the fundamental and general way of thinking of the\r\npersons to whom is intrusted the common welfare of the individuals that\r\nform a social organism. Therefore, it is criminal, it is punishable,\r\nbecause it is offensive to the high principle of authority, to attempt\r\nany action contrary to its initiative, even supposing it to be better\r\nthan the governmental proposition, because such action would injure its\r\nprestige, which is the elementary basis upon which all colonial\r\nedifices rest.”\r\n\r\nConfident that this broadside had at least stunned Isagani, the old\r\nlawyer fell back in his armchair, outwardly very serious, but laughing\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\nIsagani, however, ventured to reply. “I should think that governments,\r\nthe more they are threatened, would be all the more careful to seek\r\nbases that are impregnable. The basis of prestige for colonial\r\ngovernments is the weakest of all, since it does not depend upon\r\nthemselves but upon the consent of the governed, while the latter are\r\nwilling to recognize it. The basis of justice or reason would seem to\r\nbe the most durable.”\r\n\r\nThe lawyer raised his head. How was this—did that youth dare to reply\r\nand argue with him, him, Señor Pasta? Was he not yet bewildered with\r\nhis big words?\r\n\r\n“Young man, you must put those considerations aside, for they are\r\ndangerous,” he declared with a wave of his hand. “What I advise is that\r\nyou let the government attend to its own business.”\r\n\r\n“Governments are established for the welfare of the peoples, and in\r\norder to accomplish this purpose properly they have to follow the\r\nsuggestions of the citizens, who are the ones best qualified to\r\nunderstand their own needs.”\r\n\r\n“Those who constitute the government are also citizens, and among the\r\nmost enlightened.”\r\n\r\n“But, being men, they are fallible, and ought not to disregard the\r\nopinions of others.”\r\n\r\n“They must be trusted, they have to attend to everything.”\r\n\r\n“There is a Spanish proverb which says, ‘No tears, no milk,’ in other\r\nwords, ‘To him who does not ask, nothing is given.’ ”\r\n\r\n“Quite the reverse,” replied the lawyer with a sarcastic smile; “with\r\nthe government exactly the reverse occurs—”\r\n\r\nBut he suddenly checked himself, as if he had said too much and wished\r\nto correct his imprudence. “The government has given us things that we\r\nhave not asked for, and that we could not ask for, because to ask—to\r\nask, presupposes that it is in some way incompetent and consequently is\r\nnot performing its functions. To suggest to it a course of action, to\r\ntry to guide it, when not really antagonizing it, is to presuppose that\r\nit is capable of erring, and as I have already said to you such\r\nsuppositions are menaces to the existence of colonial governments. The\r\ncommon crowd overlooks this and the young men who set to work\r\nthoughtlessly do not know, do not comprehend, do not try to comprehend\r\nthe counter-effect of asking, the menace to order there is in that\r\nidea—”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” interrupted Isagani, offended by the arguments the jurist\r\nwas using with him, “but when by legal methods people ask a government\r\nfor something, it is because they think it good and disposed to grant a\r\nblessing, and such action, instead of irritating it, should flatter it\r\n—to the mother one appeals, never to the stepmother. The government, in\r\nmy humble opinion, is not an omniscient being that can see and\r\nanticipate everything, and even if it could, it ought not to feel\r\noffended, for here you have the church itself doing nothing but asking\r\nand begging of God, who sees and knows everything, and you yourself ask\r\nand demand many things in the courts of this same government, yet\r\nneither God nor the courts have yet taken offense. Every one realizes\r\nthat the government, being the human institution that it is, needs the\r\nsupport of all the people, it needs to be made to see and feel the\r\nreality of things. You yourself are not convinced of the truth of your\r\nobjection, you yourself know that it is a tyrannical and despotic\r\ngovernment which, in order to make a display of force and independence,\r\ndenies everything through fear or distrust, and that the tyrannized and\r\nenslaved peoples are the only ones whose duty it is never to ask for\r\nanything. A people that hates its government ought to ask for nothing\r\nbut that it abdicate its power.”\r\n\r\nThe old lawyer grimaced and shook his head from side to side, in sign\r\nof discontent, while he rubbed his hand over his bald pate and said in\r\na tone of condescending pity: “Ahem! those are bad doctrines, bad\r\ntheories, ahem! How plain it is that you are young and inexperienced in\r\nlife. Look what is happening with the inexperienced young men who in\r\nMadrid are asking for so many reforms. They are accused of\r\nfilibusterism, many of them don’t dare return here, and yet, what are\r\nthey asking for? Things holy, ancient, and recognized as quite\r\nharmless. But there are matters that can’t be explained, they’re so\r\ndelicate. Let’s see—I confess to you that there are other reasons\r\nbesides those expressed that might lead a sensible government to deny\r\nsystematically the wishes of the people—no—but it may happen that we\r\nfind ourselves under rulers so fatuous and ridiculous—but there are\r\nalways other reasons, even though what is asked be quite just—different\r\ngovernments encounter different conditions—”\r\n\r\nThe old man hesitated, stared fixedly at Isagani, and then with a\r\nsudden resolution made a sign with his hand as though he would dispel\r\nsome idea.\r\n\r\n“I can guess what you mean,” said Isagani, smiling sadly. “You mean\r\nthat a colonial government, for the very reason that it is imperfectly\r\nconstituted and that it is based on premises—”\r\n\r\n“No, no, not that, no!” quickly interrupted the old lawyer, as he\r\nsought for something among his papers. “No, I meant—but where are my\r\nspectacles?”\r\n\r\n“There they are,” replied Isagani.\r\n\r\nThe old man put them on and pretended to look over some papers, but\r\nseeing that the youth was waiting, he mumbled, “I wanted to tell you\r\nsomething, I wanted to say—but it has slipped from my mind. You\r\ninterrupted me in your eagerness—but it was an insignificant matter. If\r\nyou only knew what a whirl my head is in, I have so much to do!”\r\n\r\nIsagani understood that he was being dismissed. “So,” he said, rising,\r\n“we—”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you will do well to leave the matter in the hands of the\r\ngovernment, which will settle it as it sees fit. You say that the\r\nVice-Rector is opposed to the teaching of Castilian. Perhaps he may be,\r\nnot as to the fact but as to the form. It is said that the Rector who\r\nis on his way will bring a project for reform in education. Wait a\r\nwhile, give time a chance, apply yourself to your studies as the\r\nexaminations are near, and—carambas!—you who already speak Castilian\r\nand express yourself easily, what are you bothering yourself about?\r\nWhat interest have you in seeing it specially taught? Surely Padre\r\nFlorentino thinks as I do! Give him my regards.”\r\n\r\n“My uncle,” replied Isagani, “has always admonished me to think of\r\nothers as much as of myself. I didn’t come for myself, I came in the\r\nname of those who are in worse condition.”\r\n\r\n“What the devil! Let them do as you have done, let them singe their\r\neyebrows studying and come to be bald like myself, stuffing whole\r\nparagraphs into their memories! I believe that if you talk Spanish it\r\nis because you have studied it—you’re not of Manila or of Spanish\r\nparents! Then let them learn it as you have, and do as I have done:\r\nI’ve been a servant to all the friars, I’ve prepared their chocolate,\r\nand while with my right hand I stirred it, with the left I held a\r\ngrammar, I learned, and, thank God! have never needed other teachers or\r\nacademies or permits from the government. Believe me, he who wishes to\r\nlearn, learns and becomes wise!”\r\n\r\n“But how many among those who wish to learn come to be what you are?\r\nOne in ten thousand, and more!”\r\n\r\n“Pish! Why any more?” retorted the old man, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n“There are too many lawyers now, many of them become mere clerks.\r\nDoctors? They insult and abuse one another, and even kill each other in\r\ncompetition for a patient. Laborers, sir, laborers, are what we need,\r\nfor agriculture!”\r\n\r\nIsagani realized that he was losing time, but still could not forbear\r\nreplying: “Undoubtedly, there are many doctors and lawyers, but I won’t\r\nsay there are too many, since we have towns that lack them entirely,\r\nand if they do abound in quantity, perhaps they are deficient in\r\nquality. Since the young men can’t be prevented from studying, and no\r\nother professions are open to us, why let them waste their time and\r\neffort? And if the instruction, deficient as it is, does not keep many\r\nfrom becoming lawyers and doctors, if we must finally have them, why\r\nnot have good ones? After all, even if the sole wish is to make the\r\ncountry a country of farmers and laborers, and condemn in it all\r\nintellectual activity, I don’t see any evil in enlightening those same\r\nfarmers and laborers, in giving them at least an education that will\r\naid them in perfecting themselves and in perfecting their work, in\r\nplacing them in a condition to understand many things of which they are\r\nat present ignorant.”\r\n\r\n“Bah, bah, bah!” exclaimed the lawyer, drawing circles in the air with\r\nhis hand to dispel the ideas suggested. “To be a good farmer no great\r\namount of rhetoric is needed. Dreams, illusions, fancies! Eh, will you\r\ntake a piece of advice?”\r\n\r\nHe arose and placed his hand affectionately on the youth’s shoulder, as\r\nhe continued: “I’m going to give you one, and a very good one, because\r\nI see that you are intelligent and the advice will not be wasted.\r\nYou’re going to study medicine? Well, confine yourself to learning how\r\nto put on plasters and apply leeches, and don’t ever try to improve or\r\nimpair the condition of your kind. When you become a licentiate, marry\r\na rich and devout girl, try to make cures and charge well, shun\r\neverything that has any relation to the general state of the country,\r\nattend mass, confession, and communion when the rest do, and you will\r\nsee afterwards how you will thank me, and I shall see it, if I am still\r\nalive. Always remember that charity begins at home, for man ought not\r\nto seek on earth more than the greatest amount of happiness for\r\nhimself, as Bentham says. If you involve yourself in quixotisms you\r\nwill have no career, nor will you get married, nor will you ever amount\r\nto anything. All will abandon you, your own countrymen will be the\r\nfirst to laugh at your simplicity. Believe me, you will remember me and\r\nsee that I am right, when you have gray hairs like myself, gray hairs\r\nsuch as these!”\r\n\r\nHere the old lawyer stroked his scanty white hair, as he smiled sadly\r\nand shook his head.\r\n\r\n“When I have gray hairs like those, sir,” replied Isagani with equal\r\nsadness, “and turn my gaze back over my past and see that I have worked\r\nonly for myself, without having done what I plainly could and should\r\nhave done for the country that has given me everything, for the\r\ncitizens that have helped me to live—then, sir, every gray hair will be\r\na thorn, and instead of rejoicing, they will shame me!”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took his leave with a profound bow. The lawyer remained\r\nmotionless in his place, with an amazed look on his face. He listened\r\nto the footfalls that gradually died away, then resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n“Poor boy!” he murmured, “similar thoughts also crossed my mind once!\r\nWhat more could any one desire than to be able to say: ‘I have done\r\nthis for the good of the fatherland, I have consecrated my life to the\r\nwelfare of others!’ A crown of laurel, steeped in aloes, dry leaves\r\nthat cover thorns and worms! That is not life, that does not get us our\r\ndaily bread, nor does it bring us honors— the laurel would hardly serve\r\nfor a salad, nor produce ease, nor aid us in winning lawsuits, but\r\nquite the reverse! Every country has its code of ethics, as it has its\r\nclimate and its diseases, different from the climate and the diseases\r\nof other countries.”\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, he added: “Poor boy! If all should think and act as he\r\ndoes, I don’t say but that—Poor boy! Poor Florentino!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE TRIBULATIONS OF A CHINESE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening of that same Saturday, Quiroga, the Chinese, who aspired\r\nto the creation of a consulate for his nation, gave a dinner in the\r\nrooms over his bazaar, located in the Escolta. His feast was well\r\nattended: friars, government employees, soldiers, merchants, all of\r\nthem his customers, partners or patrons, were to be seen there, for his\r\nstore supplied the curates and the conventos with all their\r\nnecessities, he accepted the chits of all the employees, and he had\r\nservants who were discreet, prompt, and complaisant. The friars\r\nthemselves did not disdain to pass whole hours in his store, sometimes\r\nin view of the public, sometimes in the chambers with agreeable\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThat night, then, the sala presented a curious aspect, being filled\r\nwith friars and clerks seated on Vienna chairs, stools of black wood,\r\nand marble benches of Cantonese origin, before little square tables,\r\nplaying cards or conversing among themselves, under the brilliant glare\r\nof the gilt chandeliers or the subdued light of the Chinese lanterns,\r\nwhich were brilliantly decorated with long silken tassels. On the walls\r\nthere was a lamentable medley of landscapes in dim and gaudy colors,\r\npainted in Canton or Hongkong, mingled with tawdry chromos of odalisks,\r\nhalf-nude women, effeminate lithographs of Christ, the deaths of the\r\njust and of the sinners—made by Jewish houses in Germany to be sold in\r\nthe Catholic countries. Nor were there lacking the Chinese prints on\r\nred paper representing a man seated, of venerable aspect, with a calm,\r\nsmiling face, behind whom stood a servant, ugly, horrible, diabolical,\r\nthreatening, armed with a lance having a wide, keen blade. Among the\r\nIndians some call this figure Mohammed, others Santiago, [34] we do not\r\nknow why, nor do the Chinese themselves give a very clear explanation\r\nof this popular pair. The pop of champagne corks, the rattle of\r\nglasses, laughter, cigar smoke, and that odor peculiar to a Chinese\r\nhabitation—a mixture of punk, opium, and dried fruits—completed the\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nDressed as a Chinese mandarin in a blue-tasseled cap, Quiroga moved\r\nfrom room to room, stiff and straight, but casting watchful glances\r\nhere and there as though to assure himself that nothing was being\r\nstolen. Yet in spite of this natural distrust, he exchanged handshakes\r\nwith each guest, greeted some with a smile sagacious and humble, others\r\nwith a patronizing air, and still others with a certain shrewd look\r\nthat seemed to say, “I know! You didn’t come on my account, you came\r\nfor the dinner!”\r\n\r\nAnd Quiroga was right! That fat gentleman who is now praising him and\r\nspeaking of the advisability of a Chinese consulate in Manila,\r\nintimating that to manage it there could be no one but Quiroga, is the\r\nSeñor Gonzalez who hides behind the pseudonym Pitilí when he attacks\r\nChinese immigration through the columns of the newspapers. That other,\r\nan elderly man who closely examines the lamps, pictures, and other\r\nfurnishings with grimaces and ejaculations of disdain, is Don Timoteo\r\nPelaez, Juanito’s father, a merchant who inveighs against the Chinese\r\ncompetition that is ruining his business. The one over there, that\r\nthin, brown individual with a sharp look and a pale smile, is the\r\ncelebrated originator of the dispute over Mexican pesos, which so\r\ntroubled one of Quiroga’s protéges: that government clerk is regarded\r\nin Manila as very clever. That one farther on, he of the frowning look\r\nand unkempt mustache, is a government official who passes for a most\r\nmeritorious fellow because he has the courage to speak ill of the\r\nbusiness in lottery tickets carried on between Quiroga and an exalted\r\ndame in Manila society. The fact is that two thirds of the tickets go\r\nto China and the few that are left in Manila are sold at a premium of a\r\nhalf-real. The honorable gentleman entertains the conviction that some\r\nday he will draw the first prize, and is in a rage at finding himself\r\nconfronted with such tricks.\r\n\r\nThe dinner, meanwhile, was drawing to an end. From the dining-room\r\nfloated into the sala snatches of toasts, interruptions, bursts and\r\nripples of laughter. The name of Quiroga was often heard mingled with\r\nthe words “consul,” “equality,” “justice.” The amphitryon himself did\r\nnot eat European dishes, so he contented himself with drinking a glass\r\nof wine with his guests from time to time, promising to dine with those\r\nwho were not seated at the first table.\r\n\r\nSimoun, who was present, having already dined, was in the sala talking\r\nwith some merchants, who were complaining of business conditions:\r\neverything was going wrong, trade was paralyzed, the European exchanges\r\nwere exorbitantly high. They sought information from the jeweler or\r\ninsinuated to him a few ideas, with the hope that these would be\r\ncommunicated to the Captain-General. To all the remedies suggested\r\nSimoun responded with a sarcastic and unfeeling exclamation about\r\nnonsense, until one of them in exasperation asked him for his opinion.\r\n\r\n“My opinion?” he retorted. “Study how other nations prosper, and then\r\ndo as they do.”\r\n\r\n“And why do they prosper, Señor Simoun?”\r\n\r\nSimoun replied with a shrug of his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“The port works, which weigh so heavily upon commerce, and the port not\r\nyet completed!” sighed Don Timoteo Pelaez. “A Penelope’s web, as my son\r\nsays, that is spun and unspun. The taxes—”\r\n\r\n“You complaining!” exclaimed another. “Just as the General has decreed\r\nthe destruction of houses of light materials! [35] And you with a\r\nshipment of galvanized iron!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” rejoined Don Timoteo, “but look what that decree cost me! Then,\r\nthe destruction will not be carried out for a month, not until Lent\r\nbegins, and other shipments may arrive. I would have wished them\r\ndestroyed right away, but—Besides, what are the owners of those houses\r\ngoing to buy from me if they are all poor, all equally beggars?”\r\n\r\n“You can always buy up their shacks for a trifle.”\r\n\r\n“And afterwards have the decree revoked and sell them back at double\r\nthe price—that’s business!”\r\n\r\nSimoun smiled his frigid smile. Seeing Quiroga approach, he left the\r\nquerulous merchants to greet the future consul, who on catching sight\r\nof him lost his satisfied expression and assigned a countenance like\r\nthose of the merchants, while he bent almost double.\r\n\r\nQuiroga respected the jeweler greatly, not only because he knew him to\r\nbe very wealthy, but also on account of his rumored influence with the\r\nCaptain-General. It was reported that Simoun favored Quiroga’s\r\nambitions, that he was an advocate for the consulate, and a certain\r\nnewspaper hostile to the Chinese had alluded to him in many\r\nparaphrases, veiled allusions, and suspension points, in the celebrated\r\ncontroversy with another sheet that was favorable to the queued folk.\r\nSome prudent persons added with winks and half-uttered words that his\r\nBlack Eminence was advising the General to avail himself of the Chinese\r\nin order to humble the tenacious pride of the natives.\r\n\r\n“To hold the people in subjection,” he was reported to have said,\r\n“there’s nothing like humiliating them and humbling them in their own\r\neyes.”\r\n\r\nTo this end an opportunity had soon presented itself. The guilds of\r\nmestizos and natives were continually watching one another, venting\r\ntheir bellicose spirits and their activities in jealousy and distrust.\r\nAt mass one day the gobernadorcillo of the natives was seated on a\r\nbench to the right, and, being extremely thin, happened to cross one of\r\nhis legs over the other, thus adopting a nonchalant attitude, in order\r\nto expose his thighs more and display his pretty shoes. The\r\ngobernadorcillo of the guild of mestizos, who was seated on the\r\nopposite bench, as he had bunions, and could not cross his legs on\r\naccount of his obesity, spread his legs wide apart to expose a plain\r\nwaistcoat adorned with a beautiful gold chain set with diamonds. The\r\ntwo cliques comprehended these maneuvers and joined battle. On the\r\nfollowing Sunday all the mestizos, even the thinnest, had large\r\npaunches and spread their legs wide apart as though on horseback, while\r\nthe natives placed one leg over the other, even the fattest, there\r\nbeing one cabeza de barangay who turned a somersault. Seeing these\r\nmovements, the Chinese all adopted their own peculiar attitude, that of\r\nsitting as they do in their shops, with one leg drawn back and upward,\r\nthe other swinging loose. There resulted protests and petitions, the\r\npolice rushed to arms ready to start a civil war, the curates rejoiced,\r\nthe Spaniards were amused and made money out of everybody, until the\r\nGeneral settled the quarrel by ordering that every one should sit as\r\nthe Chinese did, since they were the heaviest contributors, even though\r\nthey were not the best Catholics. The difficulty for the mestizos and\r\nnatives then was that their trousers were too tight to permit of their\r\nimitating the Chinese. But to make the intention of humiliating them\r\nthe more evident, the measure was carried out with great pomp and\r\nceremony, the church being surrounded by a troop of cavalry, while all\r\nthose within were sweating. The matter was carried to the Cortes, but\r\nit was repeated that the Chinese, as the ones who paid, should have\r\ntheir way in the religious ceremonies, even though they apostatized and\r\nlaughed at Christianity immediately after. The natives and the mestizos\r\nhad to be content, learning thus not to waste time over such fatuity.\r\n[36]\r\n\r\nQuiroga, with his smooth tongue and humble smile, was lavishly and\r\nflatteringly attentive to Simoun. His voice was caressing and his bows\r\nnumerous, but the jeweler cut his blandishments short by asking\r\nbrusquely:\r\n\r\n“Did the bracelets suit her?”\r\n\r\nAt this question all Quiroga’s liveliness vanished like a dream. His\r\ncaressing voice became plaintive; he bowed lower, gave the Chinese\r\nsalutation of raising his clasped hands to the height of his face, and\r\ngroaned: “Ah, Señor Simoun! I’m lost, I’m ruined!” [37]\r\n\r\n“How, Quiroga, lost and ruined when you have so many bottles of\r\nchampagne and so many guests?”\r\n\r\nQuiroga closed his eyes and made a grimace. Yes, the affair of that\r\nafternoon, that affair of the bracelets, had ruined him. Simoun smiled,\r\nfor when a Chinese merchant complains it is because all is going well,\r\nand when he makes a show that things are booming it is quite certain\r\nthat he is planning an assignment or flight to his own country.\r\n\r\n“You didn’t know that I’m lost, I’m ruined? Ah, Señor Simoun, I’m\r\nbusted!” To make his condition plainer, he illustrated the word by\r\nmaking a movement as though he were falling in collapse.\r\n\r\nSimoun wanted to laugh, but restrained himself and said that he knew\r\nnothing, nothing at all, as Quiroga led him to a room and closed the\r\ndoor. He then explained the cause of his misfortune.\r\n\r\nThree diamond bracelets that he had secured from Simoun on pretense of\r\nshowing them to his wife were not for her, a poor native shut up in her\r\nroom like a Chinese woman, but for a beautiful and charming lady, the\r\nfriend of a powerful man, whose influence was needed by him in a\r\ncertain deal in which he could clear some six thousand pesos. As he did\r\nnot understand feminine tastes and wished to be gallant, the Chinese\r\nhad asked for the three finest bracelets the jeweler had, each priced\r\nat three to four thousand pesos. With affected simplicity and his most\r\ncaressing smile, Quiroga had begged the lady to select the one she\r\nliked best, and the lady, more simple and caressing still, had declared\r\nthat she liked all three, and had kept them.\r\n\r\nSimoun burst out into laughter.\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir, I’m lost, I’m ruined!” cried the Chinese, slapping himself\r\nlightly with his delicate hands; but the jeweler continued his\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n“Ugh, bad people, surely not a real lady,” went on the Chinaman,\r\nshaking his head in disgust. “What! She has no decency, while me, a\r\nChinaman, me always polite! Ah, surely she not a real lady—a cigarrera\r\nhas more decency!”\r\n\r\n“They’ve caught you, they’ve caught you!” exclaimed Simoun, poking him\r\nin the chest.\r\n\r\n“And everybody’s asking for loans and never pays—what about that?\r\nClerks, officials, lieutenants, soldiers—” he checked them off on his\r\nlong-nailed fingers—“ah, Señor Simoun, I’m lost, I’m busted!”\r\n\r\n“Get out with your complaints,” said Simoun. “I’ve saved you from many\r\nofficials that wanted money from you. I’ve lent it to them so that they\r\nwouldn’t bother you, even when I knew that they couldn’t pay.”\r\n\r\n“But, Señor Simoun, you lend to officials; I lend to women, sailors,\r\neverybody.”\r\n\r\n“I bet you get your money back.”\r\n\r\n“Me, money back? Ah, surely you don’t understand! When it’s lost in\r\ngambling they never pay. Besides, you have a consul, you can force\r\nthem, but I haven’t.”\r\n\r\nSimoun became thoughtful. “Listen, Quiroga,” he said, somewhat\r\nabstractedly, “I’ll undertake to collect what the officers and sailors\r\nowe you. Give me their notes.”\r\n\r\nQuiroga again fell to whining: they had never given him any notes.\r\n\r\n“When they come to you asking for money, send them to me. I want to\r\nhelp you.”\r\n\r\nThe grateful Quiroga thanked him, but soon fell to lamenting again\r\nabout the bracelets. “A cigarrera wouldn’t be so shameless!” he\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n“The devil!” exclaimed Simoun, looking askance at the Chinese, as\r\nthough studying him. “Exactly when I need the money and thought that\r\nyou could pay me! But it can all be arranged, as I don’t want you to\r\nfail for such a small amount. Come, a favor, and I’ll reduce to seven\r\nthe nine thousand pesos you owe me. You can get anything you wish\r\nthrough the Customs—boxes of lamps, iron, copper, glassware, Mexican\r\npesos—you furnish arms to the conventos, don’t you?”\r\n\r\nThe Chinese nodded affirmation, but remarked that he had to do a good\r\ndeal of bribing. “I furnish the padres everything!”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” added Simoun in a low voice, “I need you to get in for me\r\nsome boxes of rifles that arrived this evening. I want you to keep them\r\nin your warehouse; there isn’t room for all of them in my house.”\r\n\r\nQuiroga began to show symptoms of fright.\r\n\r\n“Don’t get scared, you don’t run any risk. These rifles are to be\r\nconcealed, a few at a time, in various dwellings, then a search will be\r\ninstituted, and many people will be sent to prison. You and I can make\r\na haul getting them set free. Understand me?”\r\n\r\nQuiroga wavered, for he was afraid of firearms. In his desk he had an\r\nempty revolver that he never touched without turning his head away and\r\nclosing his eyes.\r\n\r\n“If you can’t do it, I’ll have to apply to some one else, but then I’ll\r\nneed the nine thousand pesos to cross their palms and shut their eyes.”\r\n\r\n“All right, all right!” Quiroga finally agreed. “But many people will\r\nbe arrested? There’ll be a search, eh?”\r\n\r\nWhen Quiroga and Simoun returned to the sala they found there, in\r\nanimated conversation, those who had finished their dinner, for the\r\nchampagne had loosened their tongues and stirred their brains. They\r\nwere talking rather freely.\r\n\r\nIn a group where there were a number of government clerks, some ladies,\r\nand Don Custodio, the topic was a commission sent to India to make\r\ncertain investigations about footwear for the soldiers.\r\n\r\n“Who compose it?” asked an elderly lady.\r\n\r\n“A colonel, two other officers, and his Excellency’s nephew.”\r\n\r\n“Four?” rejoined a clerk. “What a commission! Suppose they disagree—are\r\nthey competent?”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I asked,” replied a clerk. “It’s said that one civilian\r\nought to go, one who has no military prejudices—a shoemaker, for\r\ninstance.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” added an importer of shoes, “but it wouldn’t do to send\r\nan Indian or a Chinaman, and the only Peninsular shoemaker demanded\r\nsuch large fees—”\r\n\r\n“But why do they have to make any investigations about footwear?”\r\ninquired the elderly lady. “It isn’t for the Peninsular artillerymen.\r\nThe Indian soldiers can go barefoot, as they do in their towns.” [38]\r\n\r\n“Exactly so, and the treasury would save more,” corroborated another\r\nlady, a widow who was not satisfied with her pension.\r\n\r\n“But you must remember,” remarked another in the group, a friend of the\r\nofficers on the commission, “that while it’s true they go barefoot in\r\nthe towns, it’s not the same as moving about under orders in the\r\nservice. They can’t choose the hour, nor the road, nor rest when they\r\nwish. Remember, madam, that, with the noonday sun overhead and the\r\nearth below baking like an oven, they have to march over sandy\r\nstretches, where there are stones, the sun above and fire below,\r\nbullets in front—”\r\n\r\n“It’s only a question of getting used to it!”\r\n\r\n“Like the donkey that got used to not eating! In our present campaign\r\nthe greater part of our losses have been due to wounds on the soles of\r\nthe feet. Remember the donkey, madam, remember the donkey!”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear sir,” retorted the lady, “look how much money is wasted\r\non shoe-leather. There’s enough to pension many widows and orphans in\r\norder to maintain our prestige. Don’t smile, for I’m not talking about\r\nmyself, and I have my pension, even though a very small one,\r\ninsignificant considering the services my husband rendered, but I’m\r\ntalking of others who are dragging out miserable lives! It’s not right\r\nthat after so much persuasion to come and so many hardships in crossing\r\nthe sea they should end here by dying of hunger. What you say about the\r\nsoldiers may be true, but the fact is that I’ve been in the country\r\nmore than three years, and I haven’t seen any soldier limping.”\r\n\r\n“In that I agree with the lady,” said her neighbor. “Why issue them\r\nshoes when they were born without them?”\r\n\r\n“And why shirts?”\r\n\r\n“And why trousers?”\r\n\r\n“Just calculate what we should economize on soldiers clothed only in\r\ntheir skins!” concluded he who was defending the army.\r\n\r\nIn another group the conversation was more heated. Ben-Zayb was talking\r\nand declaiming, while Padre Camorra, as usual, was constantly\r\ninterrupting him. The friar-journalist, in spite of his respect for the\r\ncowled gentry, was always at loggerheads with Padre Camorra, whom he\r\nregarded as a silly half-friar, thus giving himself the appearance of\r\nbeing independent and refuting the accusations of those who called him\r\nFray Ibañez. Padre Camorra liked his adversary, as the latter was the\r\nonly person who would take seriously what he styled his arguments. They\r\nwere discussing magnetism, spiritualism, magic, and the like. Their\r\nwords flew through the air like the knives and balls of jugglers,\r\ntossed back and forth from one to the other.\r\n\r\nThat year great attention had been attracted in the Quiapo fair by a\r\nhead, wrongly called a sphinx, exhibited by Mr. Leeds, an American.\r\nGlaring advertisements covered the walls of the houses, mysterious and\r\nfunereal, to excite the curiosity of the public. Neither Ben-Zayb nor\r\nany of the padres had yet seen it; Juanito Pelaez was the only one who\r\nhad, and he was describing his wonderment to the party.\r\n\r\nBen-Zayb, as a journalist, looked for a natural explanation. Padre\r\nCamorra talked of the devil, Padre Irene smiled, Padre Salvi remained\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n“But, Padre, the devil doesn’t need to come—we are sufficient to damn\r\nourselves—”\r\n\r\n“It can’t be explained any other way.”\r\n\r\n“If science—”\r\n\r\n“Get out with science, puñales!”\r\n\r\n“But, listen to me and I’ll convince you. It’s all a question of\r\noptics. I haven’t yet seen the head nor do I know how it looks, but\r\nthis gentleman”—indicating Juanito Pelaez—“tells us that it does not\r\nlook like the talking heads that are usually exhibited. So be it! But\r\nthe principle is the same—it’s all a question of optics. Wait! A mirror\r\nis placed thus, another mirror behind it, the image is reflected—I say,\r\nit is purely a problem in physics.”\r\n\r\nTaking down from the walls several mirrors, he arranged them, turned\r\nthem round and round, but, not getting the desired result, concluded:\r\n“As I say, it’s nothing more or less than a question of optics.”\r\n\r\n“But what do you want mirrors for, if Juanito tells us that the head is\r\ninside a box placed on the table? I see in it spiritualism, because the\r\nspiritualists always make use of tables, and I think that Padre Salvi,\r\nas the ecclesiastical governor, ought to prohibit the exhibition.”\r\n\r\nPadre Salvi remained silent, saying neither yes nor no.\r\n\r\n“In order to learn if there are devils or mirrors inside it,” suggested\r\nSimoun, “the best thing would be for you to go and see the famous\r\nsphinx.”\r\n\r\nThe proposal was a good one, so it was accepted, although Padre Salvi\r\nand Don Custodio showed some repugnance. They at a fair, to rub\r\nshoulders with the public, to see sphinxes and talking heads! What\r\nwould the natives say? These might take them for mere men, endowed with\r\nthe same passions and weaknesses as others. But Ben-Zayb, with his\r\njournalistic ingenuity, promised to request Mr. Leeds not to admit the\r\npublic while they were inside. They would be honoring him sufficiently\r\nby the visit not to admit of his refusal, and besides he would not\r\ncharge any admission fee. To give a show of probability to this, he\r\nconcluded: “Because, remember, if I should expose the trick of the\r\nmirrors to the public, it would ruin the poor American’s business.”\r\nBen-Zayb was a conscientious individual.\r\n\r\nAbout a dozen set out, among them our acquaintances, Padres Salvi,\r\nCamorra, and Irene, Don Custodio, Ben-Zayb, and Juanito Pelaez. Their\r\ncarriages set them down at the entrance to the Quiapo Plaza.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE QUIAPO FAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful night and the plaza presented a most animated\r\naspect. Taking advantage of the freshness of the breeze and the\r\nsplendor of the January moon, the people filled the fair to see, be\r\nseen, and amuse themselves. The music of the cosmoramas and the lights\r\nof the lanterns gave life and merriment to every one. Long rows of\r\nbooths, brilliant with tinsel and gauds, exposed to view clusters of\r\nballs, masks strung by the eyes, tin toys, trains, carts, mechanical\r\nhorses, carriages, steam-engines with diminutive boilers, Lilliputian\r\ntableware of porcelain, pine Nativities, dolls both foreign and\r\ndomestic, the former red and smiling, the latter sad and pensive like\r\nlittle ladies beside gigantic children. The beating of drums, the roar\r\nof tin horns, the wheezy music of the accordions and the hand-organs,\r\nall mingled in a carnival concert, amid the coming and going of the\r\ncrowd, pushing, stumbling over one another, with their faces turned\r\ntoward the booths, so that the collisions were frequent and often\r\namusing. The carriages were forced to move slowly, with the tabí of the\r\ncocheros repeated every moment. Met and mingled government clerks,\r\nsoldiers, friars, students, Chinese, girls with their mammas or aunts,\r\nall greeting, signaling, calling to one another merrily.\r\n\r\nPadre Camorra was in the seventh heaven at the sight of so many pretty\r\ngirls. He stopped, looked back, nudged Ben-Zayb, chuckled and swore,\r\nsaying, “And that one, and that one, my ink-slinger? And that one over\r\nthere, what say you?” In his contentment he even fell to using the\r\nfamiliar tu toward his friend and adversary. Padre Salvi stared at him\r\nfrom time to time, but he took little note of Padre Salvi. On the\r\ncontrary, he pretended to stumble so that he might brush against the\r\ngirls, he winked and made eyes at them.\r\n\r\n“Puñales!” he kept saying to himself. “When shall I be the curate of\r\nQuiapo?”\r\n\r\nSuddenly Ben-Zayb let go an oath, jumped aside, and slapped his hand on\r\nhis arm; Padre Camorra in his excess of enthusiasm had pinched him.\r\nThey were approaching a dazzling señorita who was attracting the\r\nattention of the whole plaza, and Padre Camorra, unable to restrain his\r\ndelight, had taken Ben-Zayb’s arm as a substitute for the girl’s.\r\n\r\nIt was Paulita Gomez, the prettiest of the pretty, in company with\r\nIsagani, followed by Doña Victorina. The young woman was resplendent in\r\nher beauty: all stopped and craned their necks, while they ceased their\r\nconversation and followed her with their eyes—even Doña Victorina was\r\nrespectfully saluted.\r\n\r\nPaulita was arrayed in a rich camisa and pañuelo of embroidered piña,\r\ndifferent from those she had worn that morning to the church. The gauzy\r\ntexture of the piña set off her shapely head, and the Indians who saw\r\nher compared her to the moon surrounded by fleecy clouds. A silk\r\nrose-colored skirt, caught up in rich and graceful folds by her little\r\nhand, gave majesty to her erect figure, the movement of which,\r\nharmonizing with her curving neck, displayed all the triumphs of vanity\r\nand satisfied coquetry. Isagani appeared to be rather disgusted, for so\r\nmany curious eyes fixed upon the beauty of his sweetheart annoyed him.\r\nThe stares seemed to him robbery and the girl’s smiles faithlessness.\r\n\r\nJuanito saw her and his hump increased when he spoke to her. Paulita\r\nreplied negligently, while Doña Victorina called to him, for Juanito\r\nwas her favorite, she preferring him to Isagani.\r\n\r\n“What a girl, what a girl!” muttered the entranced Padre Camorra.\r\n\r\n“Come, Padre, pinch yourself and let me alone,” said Ben-Zayb\r\nfretfully.\r\n\r\n“What a girl, what a girl!” repeated the friar. “And she has for a\r\nsweetheart a pupil of mine, the boy I had the quarrel with.”\r\n\r\n“Just my luck that she’s not of my town,” he added, after turning his\r\nhead several times to follow her with his looks. He was even tempted to\r\nleave his companions to follow the girl, and Ben-Zayb had difficulty in\r\ndissuading him. Paulita’s beautiful figure moved on, her graceful\r\nlittle head nodding with inborn coquetry.\r\n\r\nOur promenaders kept on their way, not without sighs on the part of the\r\nfriar-artilleryman, until they reached a booth surrounded by\r\nsightseers, who quickly made way for them. It was a shop of little\r\nwooden figures, of local manufacture, representing in all shapes and\r\nsizes the costumes, races, and occupations of the country: Indians,\r\nSpaniards, Chinese, mestizos, friars, clergymen, government clerks,\r\ngobernadorcillos, students, soldiers, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhether the artists had more affection for the priests, the folds of\r\nwhose habits were better suited to their esthetic purposes, or whether\r\nthe friars, holding such an important place in Philippine life, engaged\r\nthe attention of the sculptor more, the fact was that, for one cause or\r\nanother, images of them abounded, well-turned and finished,\r\nrepresenting them in the sublimest moments of their lives—the opposite\r\nof what is done in Europe, where they are pictured as sleeping on casks\r\nof wine, playing cards, emptying tankards, rousing themselves to\r\ngaiety, or patting the cheeks of a buxom girl. No, the friars of the\r\nPhilippines were different: elegant, handsome, well-dressed, their\r\ntonsures neatly shaven, their features symmetrical and serene, their\r\ngaze meditative, their expression saintly, somewhat rosy-cheeked, cane\r\nin hand and patent-leather shoes on their feet, inviting adoration and\r\na place in a glass case. Instead of the symbols of gluttony and\r\nincontinence of their brethren in Europe, those of Manila carried the\r\nbook, the crucifix, and the palm of martyrdom; instead of kissing the\r\nsimple country lasses, those of Manila gravely extended the hand to be\r\nkissed by children and grown men doubled over almost to kneeling;\r\ninstead of the full refectory and dining-hall, their stage in Europe,\r\nin Manila they had the oratory, the study-table; instead of the\r\nmendicant friar who goes from door to door with his donkey and sack,\r\nbegging alms, the friars of the Philippines scattered gold from full\r\nhands among the miserable Indians.\r\n\r\n“Look, here’s Padre Camorra!” exclaimed Ben-Zayb, upon whom the effect\r\nof the champagne still lingered. He pointed to a picture of a lean\r\nfriar of thoughtful mien who was seated at a table with his head\r\nresting on the palm of his hand, apparently writing a sermon by the\r\nlight of a lamp. The contrast suggested drew laughter from the crowd.\r\n\r\nPadre Camorra, who had already forgotten about Paulita, saw what was\r\nmeant and laughing his clownish laugh, asked in turn, “Whom does this\r\nother figure resemble, Ben-Zayb?”\r\n\r\nIt was an old woman with one eye, with disheveled hair, seated on the\r\nground like an Indian idol, ironing clothes. The sad-iron was carefully\r\nimitated, being of copper with coals of red tinsel and smoke-wreaths of\r\ndirty twisted cotton.\r\n\r\n“Eh, Ben-Zayb, it wasn’t a fool who designed that” asked Padre Camorra\r\nwith a laugh.\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t see the point,” replied the journalist.\r\n\r\n“But, puñales, don’t you see the title, The Philippine Press? That\r\nutensil with which the old woman is ironing is here called the press!”\r\n\r\nAll laughed at this, Ben-Zayb himself joining in good-naturedly.\r\n\r\nTwo soldiers of the Civil Guard, appropriately labeled, were placed\r\nbehind a man who was tightly bound and had his face covered by his hat.\r\nIt was entitled The Country of Abaka, [39] and from appearances they\r\nwere going to shoot him.\r\n\r\nMany of our visitors were displeased with the exhibition. They talked\r\nof rules of art, they sought proportion—one said that this figure did\r\nnot have seven heads, that the face lacked a nose, having only three,\r\nall of which made Padre Camorra somewhat thoughtful, for he did not\r\ncomprehend how a figure, to be correct, need have four noses and seven\r\nheads. Others said, if they were muscular, that they could not be\r\nIndians; still others remarked that it was not sculpture, but mere\r\ncarpentry. Each added his spoonful of criticism, until Padre Camorra,\r\nnot to be outdone, ventured to ask for at least thirty legs for each\r\ndoll, because, if the others wanted noses, couldn’t he require feet? So\r\nthey fell to discussing whether the Indian had or had not any aptitude\r\nfor sculpture, and whether it would be advisable to encourage that art,\r\nuntil there arose a general dispute, which was cut short by Don\r\nCustodio’s declaration that the Indians had the aptitude, but that they\r\nshould devote themselves exclusively to the manufacture of saints.\r\n\r\n“One would say,” observed Ben-Zayb, who was full of bright ideas that\r\nnight, “that this Chinaman is Quiroga, but on close examination it\r\nlooks like Padre Irene. And what do you say about that British Indian?\r\nHe looks like Simoun!”\r\n\r\nFresh peals of laughter resounded, while Padre Irene rubbed his nose.\r\n\r\n“That’s right!”\r\n\r\n“It’s the very image of him!”\r\n\r\n“But where is Simoun? Simoun should buy it.”\r\n\r\nBut the jeweler had disappeared, unnoticed by any one.\r\n\r\n“Puñales!” exclaimed Padre Camorra, “how stingy the American is! He’s\r\nafraid we would make him pay the admission for all of us into Mr.\r\nLeeds’ show.”\r\n\r\n“No!” rejoined Ben-Zayb, “what he’s afraid of is that he’ll compromise\r\nhimself. He may have foreseen the joke in store for his friend Mr.\r\nLeeds and has got out of the way.”\r\n\r\nThus, without purchasing the least trifle, they continued on their way\r\nto see the famous sphinx. Ben-Zayb offered to manage the affair, for\r\nthe American would not rebuff a journalist who could take revenge in an\r\nunfavorable article. “You’ll see that it’s all a question of mirrors,”\r\nhe said, “because, you see—” Again he plunged into a long\r\ndemonstration, and as he had no mirrors at hand to discredit his theory\r\nhe tangled himself up in all kinds of blunders and wound up by not\r\nknowing himself what he was saying. “In short, you’ll see how it’s all\r\na question of optics.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nLEGERDEMAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Leeds, a genuine Yankee, dressed completely in black, received his\r\nvisitors with great deference. He spoke Spanish well, from having been\r\nfor many years in South America, and offered no objection to their\r\nrequest, saying that they might examine everything, both before and\r\nafter the exhibition, but begged that they remain quiet while it was in\r\nprogress. Ben-Zayb smiled in pleasant anticipation of the vexation he\r\nhad prepared for the American.\r\n\r\nThe room, hung entirely in black, was lighted by ancient lamps burning\r\nalcohol. A rail wrapped in black velvet divided it into two almost\r\nequal parts, one of which was filled with seats for the spectators and\r\nthe other occupied by a platform covered with a checkered carpet. In\r\nthe center of this platform was placed a table, over which was spread a\r\npiece of black cloth adorned with skulls and cabalistic signs. The mise\r\nen scène was therefore lugubrious and had its effect upon the merry\r\nvisitors. The jokes died away, they spoke in whispers, and however much\r\nsome tried to appear indifferent, their lips framed no smiles. All felt\r\nas if they had entered a house where there was a corpse, an illusion\r\naccentuated by an odor of wax and incense. Don Custodio and Padre Salvi\r\nconsulted in whispers over the expediency of prohibiting such shows.\r\n\r\nBen-Zayb, in order to cheer the dispirited group and embarrass Mr.\r\nLeeds, said to him in a familiar tone: “Eh, Mister, since there are\r\nnone but ourselves here and we aren’t Indians who can be fooled, won’t\r\nyou let us see the trick? We know of course that it’s purely a question\r\nof optics, but as Padre Camorra won’t be convinced—”\r\n\r\nHere he started to jump over the rail, instead of going through the\r\nproper opening, while Padre Camorra broke out into protests, fearing\r\nthat Ben-Zayb might be right.\r\n\r\n“And why not, sir?” rejoined the American. “But don’t break anything,\r\nwill you?”\r\n\r\nThe journalist was already on the platform. “You will allow me, then?”\r\nhe asked, and without waiting for the permission, fearing that it might\r\nnot be granted, raised the cloth to look for the mirrors that he\r\nexpected should be between the legs of the table. Ben-Zayb uttered an\r\nexclamation and stepped back, again placed both hands under the table\r\nand waved them about; he encountered only empty space. The table had\r\nthree thin iron legs, sunk into the floor.\r\n\r\nThe journalist looked all about as though seeking something.\r\n\r\n“Where are the mirrors?” asked Padre Camorra.\r\n\r\nBen-Zayb looked and looked, felt the table with his fingers, raised the\r\ncloth again, and rubbed his hand over his forehead from time to time,\r\nas if trying to remember something.\r\n\r\n“Have you lost anything?” inquired Mr. Leeds.\r\n\r\n“The mirrors, Mister, where are the mirrors?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know where yours are—mine are at the hotel. Do you want to\r\nlook at yourself? You’re somewhat pale and excited.”\r\n\r\nMany laughed, in spite of their weird impressions, on seeing the\r\njesting coolness of the American, while Ben-Zayb retired, quite\r\nabashed, to his seat, muttering, “It can’t be. You’ll see that he\r\ndoesn’t do it without mirrors. The table will have to be changed\r\nlater.”\r\n\r\nMr. Leeds placed the cloth on the table again and turning toward his\r\nillustrious audience, asked them, “Are you satisfied? May we begin?”\r\n\r\n“Hurry up! How cold-blooded he is!” said the widow.\r\n\r\n“Then, ladies and gentlemen, take your seats and get your questions\r\nready.”\r\n\r\nMr. Leeds disappeared through a doorway and in a few moments returned\r\nwith a black box of worm-eaten wood, covered with inscriptions in the\r\nform of birds, beasts, and human heads.\r\n\r\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he began solemnly, “once having had occasion to\r\nvisit the great pyramid of Khufu, a Pharaoh of the fourth dynasty, I\r\nchanced upon a sarcophagus of red granite in a forgotten chamber. My\r\njoy was great, for I thought that I had found a royal mummy, but what\r\nwas my disappointment on opening the coffin, at the cost of infinite\r\nlabor, to find nothing more than this box, which you may examine.”\r\n\r\nHe handed the box to those in the front row. Padre Camorra drew back in\r\nloathing, Padre Salvi looked at it closely as if he enjoyed sepulchral\r\nthings, Padre Irene smiled a knowing smile, Don Custodio affected\r\ngravity and disdain, while Ben-Zayb hunted for his mirrors—there they\r\nmust be, for it was a question of mirrors.\r\n\r\n“It smells like a corpse,” observed one lady, fanning herself\r\nfuriously. “Ugh!”\r\n\r\n“It smells of forty centuries,” remarked some one with emphasis.\r\n\r\nBen-Zayb forgot about his mirrors to discover who had made this remark.\r\nIt was a military official who had read the history of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nBen-Zayb felt jealous and to utter another epigram that might annoy\r\nPadre Camorra a little said, “It smells of the Church.”\r\n\r\n“This box, ladies and gentlemen,” continued the American, “contained a\r\nhandful of ashes and a piece of papyrus on which were written some\r\nwords. Examine them yourselves, but I beg of you not to breathe\r\nheavily, because if any of the dust is lost my sphinx will appear in a\r\nmutilated condition.”\r\n\r\nThe humbug, described with such seriousness and conviction, was\r\ngradually having its effect, so much so that when the box was passed\r\naround, no one dared to breathe. Padre Camorra, who had so often\r\ndepicted from the pulpit of Tiani the torments and sufferings of hell,\r\nwhile he laughed in his sleeves at the terrified looks of the sinners,\r\nheld his nose, and Padre Salvi—the same Padre Salvi who had on All\r\nSouls’ Day prepared a phantasmagoria of the souls in purgatory with\r\nflames and transparencies illuminated with alcohol lamps and covered\r\nwith tinsel, on the high altar of the church in a suburb, in order to\r\nget alms and orders for masses—the lean and taciturn Padre Salvi held\r\nhis breath and gazed suspiciously at that handful of ashes.\r\n\r\n“Memento, homo, quia pulvis es!” muttered Padre Irene with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Pish!” sneered Ben-Zayb—the same thought had occurred to him, and the\r\nCanon had taken the words out of his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Not knowing what to do,” resumed Mr. Leeds, closing the box carefully,\r\n“I examined the papyrus and discovered two words whose meaning was\r\nunknown to me. I deciphered them, and tried to pronounce them aloud.\r\nScarcely had I uttered the first word when I felt the box slipping from\r\nmy hands, as if pressed down by an enormous weight, and it glided along\r\nthe floor, whence I vainly endeavored to remove it. But my surprise was\r\nconverted into terror when it opened and I found within a human head\r\nthat stared at me fixedly. Paralyzed with fright and uncertain what to\r\ndo in the presence of such a phenomenon, I remained for a time\r\nstupefied, trembling like a person poisoned with mercury, but after a\r\nwhile recovered myself and, thinking that it was a vain illusion, tried\r\nto divert my attention by reading the second word. Hardly had I\r\npronounced it when the box closed, the head disappeared, and in its\r\nplace I again found the handful of ashes. Without suspecting it I had\r\ndiscovered the two most potent words in nature, the words of creation\r\nand destruction, of life and of death!”\r\n\r\nHe paused for a few moments to note the effect of his story, then with\r\ngrave and measured steps approached the table and placed the mysterious\r\nbox upon it.\r\n\r\n“The cloth, Mister!” exclaimed the incorrigible Ben-Zayb.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” rejoined Mr. Leeds, very complaisantly.\r\n\r\nLifting the box with his right hand, he caught up the cloth with his\r\nleft, completely exposing the table sustained by its three legs. Again\r\nhe placed the box upon the center and with great gravity turned to his\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n“Here’s what I want to see,” said Ben-Zayb to his neighbor. “You notice\r\nhow he makes some excuse.”\r\n\r\nGreat attention was depicted on all countenances and silence reigned.\r\nThe noise and roar of the street could be distinctly heard, but all\r\nwere so affected that a snatch of dialogue which reached them produced\r\nno effect.\r\n\r\n“Why can’t we go in?” asked a woman’s voice.\r\n\r\n“Abá, there’s a lot of friars and clerks in there,” answered a man.\r\n“The sphinx is for them only.”\r\n\r\n“The friars are inquisitive too,” said the woman’s voice, drawing away.\r\n“They don’t want us to know how they’re being fooled. Why, is the head\r\na friar’s querida?”\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a profound silence the American announced in a tone of\r\nemotion: “Ladies and gentlemen, with a word I am now going to reanimate\r\nthe handful of ashes, and you will talk with a being that knows the\r\npast, the present, and much of the future!”\r\n\r\nHere the prestidigitator uttered a soft cry, first mournful, then\r\nlively, a medley of sharp sounds like imprecations and hoarse notes\r\nlike threats, which made Ben-Zayb’s hair stand on end.\r\n\r\n“Deremof!” cried the American.\r\n\r\nThe curtains on the wall rustled, the lamps burned low, the table\r\ncreaked. A feeble groan responded from the interior of the box. Pale\r\nand uneasy, all stared at one another, while one terrified señora\r\ncaught hold of Padre Salvi.\r\n\r\nThe box then opened of its own accord and presented to the eyes of the\r\naudience a head of cadaverous aspect, surrounded by long and abundant\r\nblack hair. It slowly opened its eyes and looked around the whole\r\naudience. Those eyes had a vivid radiance, accentuated by their\r\ncavernous sockets, and, as if deep were calling unto deep, fixed\r\nthemselves upon the profound, sunken eyes of the trembling Padre Salvi,\r\nwho was staring unnaturally, as though he saw a ghost.\r\n\r\n“Sphinx,” commanded Mr. Leeds, “tell the audience who you are.”\r\n\r\nA deep silence prevailed, while a chill wind blew through the room and\r\nmade the blue flames of the sepulchral lamps flicker. The most\r\nskeptical shivered.\r\n\r\n“I am Imuthis,” declared the head in a funereal, but strangely\r\nmenacing, voice. “I was born in the time of Amasis and died under the\r\nPersian domination, when Cambyses was returning from his disastrous\r\nexpedition into the interior of Libya. I had come to complete my\r\neducation after extensive travels through Greece, Assyria, and Persia,\r\nand had returned to my native laud to dwell in it until Thoth should\r\ncall me before his terrible tribunal. But to my undoing, on passing\r\nthrough Babylonia, I discovered an awful secret—the secret of the false\r\nSmerdis who usurped the throne, the bold Magian Gaumata who governed as\r\nan impostor. Fearing that I would betray him to Cambyses, he determined\r\nupon my ruin through the instrumentality of the Egyptian priests, who\r\nat that time ruled my native country. They were the owners of\r\ntwo-thirds of the land, the monopolizers of learning, they held the\r\npeople down in ignorance and tyranny, they brutalized them, thus making\r\nthem fit to pass without resistance from one domination to another. The\r\ninvaders availed themselves of them, and knowing their usefulness,\r\nprotected and enriched them. The rulers not only depended on their\r\nwill, but some were reduced to mere instruments of theirs. The Egyptian\r\npriests hastened to execute Gaumata’s orders, with greater zeal from\r\ntheir fear of me, because they were afraid that I would reveal their\r\nimpostures to the people. To accomplish their purpose, they made use of\r\na young priest of Abydos, who passed for a saint.”\r\n\r\nA painful silence followed these words. That head was talking of\r\npriestly intrigues and impostures, and although referring to another\r\nage and other creeds, all the friars present were annoyed, possibly\r\nbecause they could see in the general trend of the speech some analogy\r\nto the existing situation. Padre Salvi was in the grip of convulsive\r\nshivering; he worked his lips and with bulging eyes followed the gaze\r\nof the head as though fascinated. Beads of sweat began to break out on\r\nhis emaciated face, but no one noticed this, so deeply absorbed and\r\naffected were they.\r\n\r\n“What was the plot concocted by the priests of your country against\r\nyou?” asked Mr. Leeds.\r\n\r\nThe head uttered a sorrowful groan, which seemed to come from the\r\nbottom of the heart, and the spectators saw its eyes, those fiery eyes,\r\nclouded and filled with tears. Many shuddered and felt their hair rise.\r\nNo, that was not an illusion, it was not a trick: the head was the\r\nvictim and what it told was its own story.\r\n\r\n“Ay!” it moaned, shaking with affliction, “I loved a maiden, the\r\ndaughter of a priest, pure as light, like the freshly opened lotus! The\r\nyoung priest of Abydos also desired her and planned a rebellion, using\r\nmy name and some papyri that he had secured from my beloved. The\r\nrebellion broke out at the time when Cambyses was returning in rage\r\nover the disasters of his unfortunate campaign. I was accused of being\r\na rebel, was made a prisoner, and having effected my escape was killed\r\nin the chase on Lake Moeris. From out of eternity I saw the imposture\r\ntriumph. I saw the priest of Abydos night and day persecuting the\r\nmaiden, who had taken refuge in a temple of Isis on the island of\r\nPhilae. I saw him persecute and harass her, even in the subterranean\r\nchambers, I saw him drive her mad with terror and suffering, like a\r\nhuge bat pursuing a white dove. Ah, priest, priest of Abydos, I have\r\nreturned to life to expose your infamy, and after so many years of\r\nsilence, I name thee murderer, hypocrite, liar!”\r\n\r\nA dry, hollow laugh accompanied these words, while a choked voice\r\nresponded, “No! Mercy!”\r\n\r\nIt was Padre Salvi, who had been overcome with terror and with arms\r\nextended was slipping in collapse to the floor.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with your Reverence? Are you ill?” asked Padre\r\nIrene.\r\n\r\n“The heat of the room—”\r\n\r\n“This odor of corpses we’re breathing here—”\r\n\r\n“Murderer, slanderer, hypocrite!” repeated the head. “I accuse\r\nyou—murderer, murderer, murderer!”\r\n\r\nAgain the dry laugh, sepulchral and menacing, resounded, as though that\r\nhead were so absorbed in contemplation of its wrongs that it did not\r\nsee the tumult that prevailed in the room.\r\n\r\n“Mercy! She still lives!” groaned Padre Salvi, and then lost\r\nconsciousness. He was as pallid as a corpse. Some of the ladies thought\r\nit their duty to faint also, and proceeded to do so.\r\n\r\n“He is out of his head! Padre Salvi!”\r\n\r\n“I told him not to eat that bird’s-nest soup,” said Padre Irene. “It\r\nhas made him sick.”\r\n\r\n“But he didn’t eat anything,” rejoined Don Custodio shivering. “As the\r\nhead has been staring at him fixedly, it has mesmerized him.”\r\n\r\nSo disorder prevailed, the room seemed to be a hospital or a\r\nbattlefield. Padre Salvi looked like a corpse, and the ladies, seeing\r\nthat no one was paying them any attention, made the best of it by\r\nrecovering.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the head had been reduced to ashes, and Mr. Leeds, having\r\nreplaced the cloth on the table, bowed his audience out.\r\n\r\n“This show must be prohibited,” said Don Custodio on leaving. “It’s\r\nwicked and highly immoral.”\r\n\r\n“And above all, because it doesn’t use mirrors,” added Ben-Zayb, who\r\nbefore going out of the room tried to assure himself finally, so he\r\nleaped over the rail, went up to the table, and raised the cloth:\r\nnothing, absolutely nothing! [40] On the following day he wrote an\r\narticle in which he spoke of occult sciences, spiritualism, and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nAn order came immediately from the ecclesiastical governor prohibiting\r\nthe show, but Mr. Leeds had already disappeared, carrying his secret\r\nwith him to Hongkong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE FUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nPlacido Penitente left the class with his heart overflowing with\r\nbitterness and sullen gloom in his looks. He was worthy of his name\r\nwhen not driven from his usual course, but once irritated he was a\r\nveritable torrent, a wild beast that could only be stopped by the death\r\nof himself or his foe. So many affronts, so many pinpricks, day after\r\nday, had made his heart quiver, lodging in it to sleep the sleep of\r\nlethargic vipers, and they now were awaking to shake and hiss with\r\nfury. The hisses resounded in his ears with the jesting epithets of the\r\nprofessor, the phrases in the slang of the markets, and he seemed to\r\nhear blows and laughter. A thousand schemes for revenge rushed into his\r\nbrain, crowding one another, only to fade immediately like phantoms in\r\na dream. His vanity cried out to him with desperate tenacity that he\r\nmust do something.\r\n\r\n“Placido Penitente,” said the voice, “show these youths that you have\r\ndignity, that you are the son of a valiant and noble province, where\r\nwrongs are washed out with blood. You’re a Batangan, Placido Penitente!\r\nAvenge yourself, Placido Penitente!”\r\n\r\nThe youth groaned and gnashed his teeth, stumbling against every one in\r\nthe street and on the Bridge of Spain, as if he were seeking a quarrel.\r\nIn the latter place he saw a carriage in which was the Vice-Rector,\r\nPadre Sibyla, accompanied by Don Custodio, and he had a great mind to\r\nseize the friar and throw him into the river.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded along the Escolta and was tempted to assault two\r\nAugustinians who were seated in the doorway of Quiroga’s bazaar,\r\nlaughing and joking with other friars who must have been inside in\r\njoyous conversation, for their merry voices and sonorous laughter could\r\nbe heard. Somewhat farther on, two cadets blocked up the sidewalk,\r\ntalking with the clerk of a warehouse, who was in his shirtsleeves.\r\nPenitents moved toward them to force a passage and they, perceiving his\r\ndark intention, good-humoredly made way for him. Placido was by this\r\ntime under the influence of the amok, as the Malayists say.\r\n\r\nAs he approached his home—the house of a silversmith where he lived as\r\na boarder—he tried to collect his thoughts and make a plan—to return to\r\nhis town and avenge himself by showing the friars that they could not\r\nwith impunity insult a youth or make a joke of him. He decided to write\r\na letter immediately to his mother, Cabesang Andang, to inform her of\r\nwhat had happened and to tell her that the schoolroom had closed\r\nforever for him. Although there was the Ateneo of the Jesuits, where he\r\nmight study that year, yet it was not very likely that the Dominicans\r\nwould grant him the transfer, and, even though he should secure it, in\r\nthe following year he would have to return to the University.\r\n\r\n“They say that we don’t know how to avenge ourselves!” he muttered.\r\n“Let the lightning strike and we’ll see!”\r\n\r\nBut Placido was not reckoning upon what awaited him in the house of the\r\nsilversmith. Cabesang Andang had just arrived from Batangas, having\r\ncome to do some shopping, to visit her son, and to bring him money,\r\njerked venison, and silk handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\nThe first greetings over, the poor woman, who had at once noticed her\r\nson’s gloomy look, could no longer restrain her curiosity and began to\r\nask questions. His first explanations Cabesang Andang regarded as some\r\nsubterfuge, so she smiled and soothed her son, reminding him of their\r\nsacrifices and privations. She spoke of Capitana Simona’s son, who,\r\nhaving entered the seminary, now carried himself in the town like a\r\nbishop, and Capitana Simona already considered herself a Mother of God,\r\nclearly so, for her son was going to be another Christ.\r\n\r\n“If the son becomes a priest,” said she, “the mother won’t have to pay\r\nus what she owes us. Who will collect from her then?”\r\n\r\nBut on seeing that Placido was speaking seriously and reading in his\r\neyes the storm that raged within him, she realized that what he was\r\ntelling her was unfortunately the strict truth. She remained silent for\r\na while and then broke out into lamentations.\r\n\r\n“Ay!” she exclaimed. “I promised your father that I would care for you,\r\neducate you, and make a lawyer of you! I’ve deprived myself of\r\neverything so that you might go to school! Instead of joining the\r\npanguingui where the stake is a half peso, I Ve gone only where it’s a\r\nhalf real, enduring the bad smells and the dirty cards. Look at my\r\npatched camisa; for instead of buying new ones I’ve spent the money in\r\nmasses and presents to St. Sebastian, even though I don’t have great\r\nconfidence in his power, because the curate recites the masses fast and\r\nhurriedly, he’s an entirely new saint and doesn’t yet know how to\r\nperform miracles, and isn’t made of batikulin but of lanete. Ay, what\r\nwill your father say to me when I die and see him again!”\r\n\r\nSo the poor woman lamented and wept, while Placido became gloomier and\r\nlet stifled sighs escape from his breast.\r\n\r\n“What would I get out of being a lawyer?” was his response.\r\n\r\n“What will become of you?” asked his mother, clasping her hands.\r\n“They’ll call you a filibuster and garrote you. I’ve told you that you\r\nmust have patience, that you must be humble. I don’t tell you that you\r\nmust kiss the hands of the curates, for I know that you have a delicate\r\nsense of smell, like your father, who couldn’t endure European cheese.\r\n[41] But we have to suffer, to be silent, to say yes to everything.\r\nWhat are we going to do? The friars own everything, and if they are\r\nunwilling, no one will become a lawyer or a doctor. Have patience, my\r\nson, have patience!”\r\n\r\n“But I’ve had a great deal, mother, I’ve suffered for months and\r\nmonths.”\r\n\r\nCabesang Andang then resumed her lamentations. She did not ask that he\r\ndeclare himself a partizan of the friars, she was not one herself—it\r\nwas enough to know that for one good friar there were ten bad, who took\r\nthe money from the poor and deported the rich. But one must be silent,\r\nsuffer, and endure—there was no other course. She cited this man and\r\nthat one, who by being patient and humble, even though in the bottom of\r\nhis heart he hated his masters, had risen from servant of the friars to\r\nhigh office; and such another who was rich and could commit abuses,\r\nsecure of having patrons who would protect him from the law, yet who\r\nhad been nothing more than a poor sacristan, humble and obedient, and\r\nwho had married a pretty girl whose son had the curate for a godfather.\r\nSo Cabesang Andang continued her litany of humble and patient\r\nFilipinos, as she called them, and was about to cite others who by not\r\nbeing so had found themselves persecuted and exiled, when Placido on\r\nsome trifling pretext left the house to wander about the streets.\r\n\r\nHe passed through Sibakong, [42] Tondo, San Nicolas, and Santo Cristo,\r\nabsorbed in his ill-humor, without taking note of the sun or the hour,\r\nand only when he began to feel hungry and discovered that he had no\r\nmoney, having given it all for celebrations and contributions, did he\r\nreturn to the house. He had expected that he would not meet his mother\r\nthere, as she was in the habit, when in Manila, of going out at that\r\nhour to a neighboring house where panguingui was played, but Cabesang\r\nAndang was waiting to propose her plan. She would avail herself of the\r\nprocurator of the Augustinians to restore her son to the good graces of\r\nthe Dominicans.\r\n\r\nPlacido stopped her with a gesture. “I’ll throw myself into the sea\r\nfirst,” he declared. “I’ll become a tulisan before I’ll go back to the\r\nUniversity.”\r\n\r\nAgain his mother began her preachment about patience and humility, so\r\nhe went away again without having eaten anything, directing his steps\r\ntoward the quay where the steamers tied up. The sight of a steamer\r\nweighing anchor for Hongkong inspired him with an idea—to go to\r\nHongkong, to run away, get rich there, and make war on the friars.\r\n\r\nThe thought of Hongkong awoke in his mind the recollection of a story\r\nabout frontals, cirials, and candelabra of pure silver, which the piety\r\nof the faithful had led them to present to a certain church. The\r\nfriars, so the silversmith told, had sent to Hongkong to have duplicate\r\nfrontals, cirials, and candelabra made of German silver, which they\r\nsubstituted for the genuine ones, these being melted down and coined\r\ninto Mexican pesos. Such was the story he had heard, and though it was\r\nno more than a rumor or a story, his resentment gave it the color of\r\ntruth and reminded him of other tricks of theirs in that same style.\r\nThe desire to live free, and certain half-formed plans, led him to\r\ndecide upon Hongkong. If the corporations sent all their money there,\r\ncommerce must be flourishing and he could enrich himself.\r\n\r\n“I want to be free, to live free!”\r\n\r\nNight surprised him wandering along San Fernando, but not meeting any\r\nsailor he knew, he decided to return home. As the night was beautiful,\r\nwith a brilliant moon transforming the squalid city into a fantastic\r\nfairy kingdom, he went to the fair. There he wandered back and forth,\r\npassing booths without taking any notice of the articles in them, ever\r\nwith the thought of Hongkong, of living free, of enriching himself.\r\n\r\nHe was about to leave the fair when he thought he recognized the\r\njeweler Simoun bidding good-by to a foreigner, both of them speaking in\r\nEnglish. To Placido every language spoken in the Philippines by\r\nEuropeans, when not Spanish, had to be English, and besides, he caught\r\nthe name Hongkong. If only the jeweler would recommend him to that\r\nforeigner, who must be setting out for Hongkong!\r\n\r\nPlacido paused. He was acquainted with the jeweler, as the latter had\r\nbeen in his town peddling his wares, and he had accompanied him on one\r\nof his trips, when Simoun had made himself very amiable indeed, telling\r\nhim of the life in the universities of the free countries—what a\r\ndifference!\r\n\r\nSo he followed the jeweler. “Señor Simoun, Señor Simoun!” he called.\r\n\r\nThe jeweler was at that moment entering his carriage. Recognizing\r\nPlacido, he checked himself.\r\n\r\n“I want to ask a favor of you, to say a few words to you.”\r\n\r\nSimoun made a sign of impatience which Placido in his perturbation did\r\nnot observe. In a few words the youth related what had happened and\r\nmade known his desire to go to Hongkong.\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Simoun, staring fixedly at Placido through his blue\r\ngoggles.\r\n\r\nPlacido did not answer, so Simoun threw back his head, smiled his cold,\r\nsilent smile and said, “All right! Come with me. To Calle Iris!” he\r\ndirected the cochero.\r\n\r\nSimoun remained silent throughout the whole drive, apparently absorbed\r\nin meditation of a very important nature. Placido kept quiet, waiting\r\nfor him to speak first, and entertained himself in watching the\r\npromenaders who were enjoying the clear moonlight: pairs of infatuated\r\nlovers, followed by watchful mammas or aunts; groups of students in\r\nwhite clothes that the moonlight made whiter still; half-drunken\r\nsoldiers in a carriage, six together, on their way to visit some nipa\r\ntemple dedicated to Cytherea; children playing their games and Chinese\r\nselling sugar-cane. All these filled the streets, taking on in the\r\nbrilliant moonlight fantastic forms and ideal outlines. In one house an\r\norchestra was playing waltzes, and couples might be seen dancing under\r\nthe bright lamps and chandeliers—what a sordid spectacle they presented\r\nin comparison with the sight the streets afforded! Thinking of\r\nHongkong, he asked himself if the moonlit nights in that island were so\r\npoetical and sweetly melancholy as those of the Philippines, and a deep\r\nsadness settled down over his heart.\r\n\r\nSimoun ordered the carriage to stop and both alighted, just at the\r\nmoment when Isagani and Paulita Gomez passed them murmuring sweet\r\ninanities. Behind them came Doña Victorina with Juanito Pelaez, who was\r\ntalking in a loud voice, busily gesticulating, and appearing to have a\r\nlarger hump than ever. In his preoccupation Pelaez did not notice his\r\nformer schoolmate.\r\n\r\n“There’s a fellow who’s happy!” muttered Placido with a sigh, as he\r\ngazed toward the group, which became converted into vaporous\r\nsilhouettes, with Juanito’s arms plainly visible, rising and falling\r\nlike the arms of a windmill.\r\n\r\n“That’s all he’s good for,” observed Simoun. “It’s fine to be young!”\r\n\r\nTo whom did Placido and Simoun each allude?\r\n\r\nThe jeweler made a sign to the young man, and they left the street to\r\npick their way through a labyrinth of paths and passageways among\r\nvarious houses, at times leaping upon stones to avoid the mudholes or\r\nstepping aside from the sidewalks that were badly constructed and still\r\nmore badly tended. Placido was surprised to see the rich jeweler move\r\nthrough such places as if he were familiar with them. They at length\r\nreached an open lot where a wretched hut stood off by itself surrounded\r\nby banana-plants and areca-palms. Some bamboo frames and sections of\r\nthe same material led Placido to suspect that they were approaching the\r\nhouse of a pyrotechnist.\r\n\r\nSimoun rapped on the window and a man’s face appeared.\r\n\r\n“Ah, sir!” he exclaimed, and immediately came outside.\r\n\r\n“Is the powder here?” asked Simoun.\r\n\r\n“In sacks. I’m waiting for the shells.”\r\n\r\n“And the bombs?”\r\n\r\n“Are all ready.”\r\n\r\n“All right, then. This very night you must go and inform the lieutenant\r\nand the corporal. Then keep on your way, and in Lamayan you will find a\r\nman in a banka. You will say Cabesa and he will answer Tales. It’s\r\nnecessary that he be here tomorrow. There’s no time to be lost.”\r\n\r\nSaying this, he gave him some gold coins.\r\n\r\n“How’s this, sir?” the man inquired in very good Spanish. “Is there any\r\nnews?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it’ll be done within the coming week.”\r\n\r\n“The coming week!” exclaimed the unknown, stepping backward. “The\r\nsuburbs are not yet ready, they hope that the General will withdraw the\r\ndecree. I thought it was postponed until the beginning of Lent.”\r\n\r\nSimoun shook his head. “We won’t need the suburbs,” he said. “With\r\nCabesang Tales’ people, the ex-carbineers, and a regiment, we’ll have\r\nenough. Later, Maria Clara may be dead. Start at once!”\r\n\r\nThe man disappeared. Placido, who had stood by and heard all of this\r\nbrief interview, felt his hair rise and stared with startled eyes at\r\nSimoun, who smiled.\r\n\r\n“You’re surprised,” he said with his icy smile, “that this Indian, so\r\npoorly dressed, speaks Spanish well? He was a schoolmaster who\r\npersisted in teaching Spanish to the children and did not stop until he\r\nhad lost his position and had been deported as a disturber of the\r\npublic peace, and for having been a friend of the unfortunate Ibarra. I\r\ngot him back from his deportation, where he had been working as a\r\npruner of coconut-palms, and have made him a pyrotechnist.”\r\n\r\nThey returned to the street and set out for Trozo. Before a wooden\r\nhouse of pleasant and well-kept appearance was a Spaniard on crutches,\r\nenjoying the moonlight. When Simoun accosted him, his attempt to rise\r\nwas accompanied by a stifled groan.\r\n\r\n“You’re ready?” Simoun inquired of him.\r\n\r\n“I always am!”\r\n\r\n“The coming week?”\r\n\r\n“So soon?”\r\n\r\n“At the first cannon-shot!”\r\n\r\nHe moved away, followed by Placido, who was beginning to ask himself if\r\nhe were not dreaming.\r\n\r\n“Does it surprise you,” Simoun asked him, “to see a Spaniard so young\r\nand so afflicted with disease? Two years ago he was as robust as you\r\nare, but his enemies succeeded in sending him to Balabak to work in a\r\npenal settlement, and there he caught the rheumatism and fever that are\r\ndragging him into the grave. The poor devil had married a very\r\nbeautiful woman.”\r\n\r\nAs an empty carriage was passing, Simoun hailed it and with Placido\r\ndirected it to his house in the Escolta, just at the moment when the\r\nclocks were striking half-past ten.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later Placido left the jeweler’s house and walked gravely and\r\nthoughtfully along the Escolta, then almost deserted, in spite of the\r\nfact that the cafés were still quite animated. Now and then a carriage\r\npassed rapidly, clattering noisily over the worn pavement.\r\n\r\nFrom a room in his house that overlooked the Pasig, Simoun turned his\r\ngaze toward the Walled City, which could be seen through the open\r\nwindows, with its roofs of galvanized iron gleaming in the moonlight\r\nand its somber towers showing dull and gloomy in the midst of the\r\nserene night. He laid aside his blue goggles, and his white hair, like\r\na frame of silver, surrounded his energetic bronzed features, dimly\r\nlighted by a lamp whose flame was dying out from lack of oil.\r\nApparently wrapped in thought, he took no notice of the fading light\r\nand impending darkness.\r\n\r\n“Within a few days,” he murmured, “when on all sides that accursed city\r\nis burning, den of presumptuous nothingness and impious exploitation of\r\nthe ignorant and the distressed, when the tumults break out in the\r\nsuburbs and there rush into the terrorized streets my avenging hordes,\r\nengendered by rapacity and wrongs, then will I burst the walls of your\r\nprison, I will tear you from the clutches of fanaticism, and my white\r\ndove, you will be the Phoenix that will rise from the glowing embers! A\r\nrevolution plotted by men in darkness tore me from your side—another\r\nrevolution will sweep me into your arms and revive me! That moon,\r\nbefore reaching the apogee of its brilliance, will light the\r\nPhilippines cleansed of loathsome filth!”\r\n\r\nSimoun, stopped suddenly, as though interrupted. A voice in his inner\r\nconsciousness was asking if he, Simoun, were not also a part of the\r\nfilth of that accursed city, perhaps its most poisonous ferment. Like\r\nthe dead who are to rise at the sound of the last trumpet, a thousand\r\nbloody specters—desperate shades of murdered men, women violated,\r\nfathers torn from their families, vices stimulated and encouraged,\r\nvirtues mocked, now rose in answer to the mysterious question. For the\r\nfirst time in his criminal career, since in Havana he had by means of\r\ncorruption and bribery set out to fashion an instrument for the\r\nexecution of his plans—a man without faith, patriotism, or\r\nconscience—for the first time in that life, something within rose up\r\nand protested against his actions. He closed his eyes and remained for\r\nsome time motionless, then rubbed his hand over his forehead, tried to\r\nbe deaf to his conscience, and felt fear creeping over him. No, he must\r\nnot analyze himself, he lacked the courage to turn his gaze toward his\r\npast. The idea of his courage, his conviction, his self-confidence\r\nfailing him at the very moment when his work was set before him! As the\r\nghosts of the wretches in whose misfortunes he had taken a hand\r\ncontinued to hover before his eyes, as if issuing from the shining\r\nsurface of the river to invade the room with appeals and hands extended\r\ntoward him, as reproaches and laments seemed to fill the air with\r\nthreats and cries for vengeance, he turned his gaze from the window and\r\nfor the first time began to tremble.\r\n\r\n“No, I must be ill, I can’t be feeling well,” he muttered. “There are\r\nmany who hate me, who ascribe their misfortunes to me, but—”\r\n\r\nHe felt his forehead begin to burn, so he arose to approach the window\r\nand inhale the fresh night breeze. Below him the Pasig dragged along\r\nits silvered stream, on whose bright surface the foam glittered,\r\nwinding slowly about, receding and advancing, following the course of\r\nthe little eddies. The city loomed up on the opposite bank, and its\r\nblack walls looked fateful, mysterious, losing their sordidness in the\r\nmoonlight that idealizes and embellishes everything. But again Simoun\r\nshivered; he seemed to see before him the severe countenance of his\r\nfather, dying in prison, but dying for having done good; then the face\r\nof another man, severer still, who had given his life for him because\r\nhe believed that he was going to bring about the regeneration of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n“No, I can’t turn back,” he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from his\r\nforehead. “The work is at hand and its success will justify me! If I\r\nhad conducted myself as you did, I should have succumbed. Nothing of\r\nidealism, nothing of fallacious theories! Fire and steel to the cancer,\r\nchastisement to vice, and afterwards destroy the instrument, if it be\r\nbad! No, I have planned well, but now I feel feverish, my reason\r\nwavers, it is natural—If I have done ill, it has been that I may do\r\ngood, and the end justifies the means. What I will do is not to expose\r\nmyself—”\r\n\r\nWith his thoughts thus confused he lay down, and tried to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Placido listened submissively, with a smile on\r\nhis lips, to his mother’s preachment. When she spoke of her plan of\r\ninteresting the Augustinian procurator he did not protest or object,\r\nbut on the contrary offered himself to carry it out, in order to save\r\ntrouble for his mother, whom he begged to return at once to the\r\nprovince, that very day, if possible. Cabesang Andang asked him the\r\nreason for such haste.\r\n\r\n“Because—because if the procurator learns that you are here he won’t do\r\nanything until you send him a present and order some masses.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE ARBITER\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue it was that Padre Irene had said: the question of the academy of\r\nCastilian, so long before broached, was on the road to a solution. Don\r\nCustodio, the active Don Custodio, the most active of all the arbiters\r\nin the world, according to Ben-Zayb, was occupied with it, spending his\r\ndays reading the petition and falling asleep without reaching any\r\ndecision, waking on the following day to repeat the same performance,\r\ndropping off to sleep again, and so on continuously.\r\n\r\nHow the good man labored, the most active of all the arbiters in the\r\nworld! He wished to get out of the predicament by pleasing\r\neverybody—the friars, the high official, the Countess, Padre Irene, and\r\nhis own liberal principles. He had consulted with Señor Pasta, and\r\nSeñor Pasta had left him stupefied and confused, after advising him to\r\ndo a million contradictory and impossible things. He had consulted with\r\nPepay the dancing girl, and Pepay, who had no idea what he was talking\r\nabout, executed a pirouette and asked him for twenty-five pesos to bury\r\nan aunt of hers who had suddenly died for the fifth time, or the fifth\r\naunt who had suddenly died, according to fuller explanations, at the\r\nsame time requesting that he get a cousin of hers who could read,\r\nwrite, and play the violin, a job as assistant on the public works—all\r\nthings that were far from inspiring Don Custodio with any saving idea.\r\n\r\nTwo days after the events in the Quiapo fair, Don Custodio was as usual\r\nbusily studying the petition, without hitting upon the happy solution.\r\nWhile he yawns, coughs, smokes, and thinks about Pepay’s legs and her\r\npirouettes, let us give some account of this exalted personage, in\r\norder to understand Padre Sibyla’s reason for proposing him as the\r\narbiter of such a vexatious matter and why the other clique accepted\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nDon Custodio de Salazar y Sanchez de Monteredondo, often referred to as\r\nGood Authority, belonged to that class of Manila society which cannot\r\ntake a step without having the newspapers heap titles upon them,\r\ncalling each indedefatigable, distinguished, zealous, active, profound,\r\nintelligent, well-informed, influential, and so on, as if they feared\r\nthat he might be confused with some idle and ignorant possessor of the\r\nsame name. Besides, no harm resulted from it, and the watchful censor\r\nwas not disturbed. The Good Authority resulted from his friendship with\r\nBen-Zayb, when the latter, in his two noisiest controversies, which he\r\ncarried on for weeks and months in the columns of the newspapers about\r\nwhether it was proper to wear a high hat, a derby, or a salakot, and\r\nwhether the plural of carácter should be carácteres or caractéres, in\r\norder to strengthen his argument always came out with, “We have this on\r\ngood authority,” “We learn this from good authority,” later letting it\r\nbe known, for in Manila everything becomes known, that this Good\r\nAuthority was no other than Don Custodio de Salazar y Sanchez de\r\nMonteredondo.\r\n\r\nHe had come to Manila very young, with a good position that had enabled\r\nhim to marry a pretty mestiza belonging to one of the wealthiest\r\nfamilies of the city. As he had natural talent, boldness, and great\r\nself-possession, and knew how to make use of the society in which he\r\nfound himself, he launched into business with his wife’s money, filling\r\ncontracts for the government, by reason of which he was made alderman,\r\nafterwards alcalde, member of the Economic Society, [43] councilor of\r\nthe administration, president of the directory of the Obras Pias, [44]\r\nmember of the Society of Mercy, director of the Spanish-Filipino Bank,\r\netc., etc. Nor are these etceteras to be taken like those ordinarily\r\nplaced after a long enumeration of titles: Don Custodio, although never\r\nhaving seen a treatise on hygiene, came to be vice-chairman of the\r\nBoard of Health, for the truth was that of the eight who composed this\r\nboard only one had to be a physician and he could not be that one. So\r\nalso he was a member of the Vaccination Board, which was composed of\r\nthree physicians and seven laymen, among these being the Archbishop and\r\nthree Provincials. He was a brother in all the confraternities of the\r\ncommon and of the most exalted dignity, and, as we have seen, director\r\nof the Superior Commission of Primary Instruction, which usually did\r\nnot do anything—all these being quite sufficient reason for the\r\nnewspapers to heap adjectives upon him no less when he traveled than\r\nwhen he sneezed.\r\n\r\nIn spite of so many offices, Don Custodio was not among those who slept\r\nthrough the sessions, contenting themselves, like lazy and timid\r\ndelegates, in voting with the majority. The opposite of the numerous\r\nkings of Europe who bear the title of King of Jerusalem, Don Custodio\r\nmade his dignity felt and got from it all the benefit possible, often\r\nfrowning, making his voice impressive, coughing out his words, often\r\ntaking up the whole session telling a story, presenting a project, or\r\ndisputing with a colleague who had placed himself in open opposition to\r\nhim. Although not past forty, he already talked of acting with\r\ncircumspection, of letting the figs ripen (adding under his breath\r\n“pumpkins”), of pondering deeply and of stepping with careful tread, of\r\nthe necessity for understanding the country, because the nature of the\r\nIndians, because the prestige of the Spanish name, because they were\r\nfirst of all Spaniards, because religion—and so on. Remembered yet in\r\nManila is a speech of his when for the first time it was proposed to\r\nlight the city with kerosene in place of the old coconut oil: in such\r\nan innovation, far from seeing the extinction of the coconut-oil\r\nindustry, he merely discerned the interests of a certain\r\nalderman—because Don Custodio saw a long way—and opposed it with all\r\nthe resonance of his bucal cavity, considering the project too\r\npremature and predicting great social cataclysms. No less celebrated\r\nwas his opposition to a sentimental serenade that some wished to tender\r\na certain governor on the eve of his departure. Don Custodio, who felt\r\na little resentment over some slight or other, succeeded in insinuating\r\nthe idea that the rising star was the mortal enemy of the setting one,\r\nwhereat the frightened promoters of the serenade gave it up.\r\n\r\nOne day he was advised to return to Spain to be cured of a liver\r\ncomplaint, and the newspapers spoke of him as an Antaeus who had to set\r\nfoot in the mother country to gain new strength. But the Manila Antaeus\r\nfound himself a small and insignificant person at the capital. There he\r\nwas nobody, and he missed his beloved adjectives. He did not mingle\r\nwith the upper set, and his lack of education prevented him from\r\namounting to much in the academies and scientific centers, while his\r\nbackwardness and his parish-house politics drove him from the clubs\r\ndisgusted, vexed, seeing nothing clearly but that there they were\r\nforever borrowing money and gambling heavily. He missed the submissive\r\nservants of Manila, who endured all his peevishness, and who now seemed\r\nto be far preferable; when a winter kept him between a fireplace and an\r\nattack of pneumonia, he sighed for the Manila winter during which a\r\nsingle quilt is sufficient, while in summer he missed the easy-chair\r\nand the boy to fan him. In short, in Madrid he was only one among many,\r\nand in spite of his diamonds he was once taken for a rustic who did not\r\nknow how to comport himself and at another time for an Indiano. His\r\nscruples were scoffed at, and he was shamelessly flouted by some\r\nborrowers whom he offended. Disgusted with the conservatives, who took\r\nno great notice of his advice, as well as with the sponges who rifled\r\nhis pockets, he declared himself to be of the liberal party and\r\nreturned within a year to the Philippines, if not sound in his liver,\r\nyet completely changed in his beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe eleven months spent at the capital among café politicians, nearly\r\nall retired half-pay office-holders, the various speeches caught here\r\nand there, this or that article of the opposition, all the political\r\nlife that permeates the air, from the barber-shop where amid the\r\nscissors-clips the Figaro announces his program to the banquets where\r\nin harmonious periods and telling phrases the different shades of\r\npolitical opinion, the divergences and disagreements, are adjusted—all\r\nthese things awoke in him the farther he got from Europe, like the\r\nlife-giving sap within the sown seed prevented from bursting out by the\r\nthick husk, in such a way that when he reached Manila he believed that\r\nhe was going to regenerate it and actually had the holiest plans and\r\nthe purest ideals.\r\n\r\nDuring the first months after his return he was continually talking\r\nabout the capital, about his good friends, about Minister So-and-So,\r\nex-Minister Such-a-One, the delegate C., the author B., and there was\r\nnot a political event, a court scandal, of which he was not informed to\r\nthe last detail, nor was there a public man the secrets of whose\r\nprivate life were unknown to him, nor could anything occur that he had\r\nnot foreseen, nor any reform be ordered but he had first been\r\nconsulted. All this was seasoned with attacks on the conservatives in\r\nrighteous indignation, with apologies of the liberal party, with a\r\nlittle anecdote here, a phrase there from some great man, dropped in as\r\none who did not wish offices and employments, which same he had refused\r\nin order not to be beholden to the conservatives. Such was his\r\nenthusiasm in these first days that various cronies in the\r\ngrocery-store which he visited from time to time affiliated themselves\r\nwith the liberal party and began to style themselves liberals: Don\r\nEulogio Badana, a retired sergeant of carbineers; the honest Armendia,\r\nby profession a pilot, and a rampant Carlist; Don Eusebio Picote,\r\ncustoms inspector; and Don Bonifacio Tacon, shoe- and harness-maker.\r\n[45]\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless, from lack of encouragement and of opposition, his\r\nenthusiasm gradually waned. He did not read the newspapers that came\r\nfrom Spain, because they arrived in packages, the sight of which made\r\nhim yawn. The ideas that he had caught having been all expended, he\r\nneeded reinforcement, and his orators were not there, and although in\r\nthe casinos of Manila there was enough gambling, and money was borrowed\r\nas in Madrid, no speech that would nourish his political ideas was\r\npermitted in them. But Don Custodio was not lazy, he did more than\r\nwish—he worked. Foreseeing that he was going to leave his bones in the\r\nPhilippines, he began to consider that country his proper sphere and to\r\ndevote his efforts to its welfare. Thinking to liberalize it, he\r\ncommenced to draw up a series of reforms or projects, which were\r\ningenious, to say the least. It was he who, having heard in Madrid\r\nmention of the wooden street pavements of Paris, not yet adopted in\r\nSpain, proposed the introduction of them in Manila by covering the\r\nstreets with boards nailed down as they are on the sides of houses; it\r\nwas he who, deploring the accidents to two-wheeled vehicles, planned to\r\navoid them by putting on at least three wheels; it was also he who,\r\nwhile acting as vice-president of the Board of Health, ordered\r\neverything fumigated, even the telegrams that came from infected\r\nplaces; it was also he who, in compassion for the convicts that worked\r\nin the sun and with a desire of saving to the government the cost of\r\ntheir equipment, suggested that they be clothed in a simple\r\nbreech-clout and set to work not by day but at night. He marveled, he\r\nstormed, that his projects should encounter objectors, but consoled\r\nhimself with the reflection that the man who is worth enemies has them,\r\nand revenged himself by attacking and tearing to pieces any project,\r\ngood or bad, presented by others.\r\n\r\nAs he prided himself on being a liberal, upon being asked what he\r\nthought of the Indians he would answer, like one conferring a great\r\nfavor, that they were fitted for manual labor and the imitative arts\r\n(meaning thereby music, painting, and sculpture), adding his old\r\npostscript that to know them one must have resided many, many years in\r\nthe country. Yet when he heard of any one of them excelling in\r\nsomething that was not manual labor or an imitative art—in chemistry,\r\nmedicine, or philosophy, for example—he would exclaim: “Ah, he promises\r\nfairly, fairly well, he’s not a fool!” and feel sure that a great deal\r\nof Spanish blood must flow in the veins of such an Indian. If unable to\r\ndiscover any in spite of his good intentions, he then sought a Japanese\r\norigin, for it was at that time the fashion began of attributing to the\r\nJapanese or the Arabs whatever good the Filipinos might have in them.\r\nFor him the native songs were Arabic music, as was also the alphabet of\r\nthe ancient Filipinos—he was certain of this, although he did not know\r\nArabic nor had he ever seen that alphabet.\r\n\r\n“Arabic, the purest Arabic,” he said to Ben-Zayb in a tone that\r\nadmitted no reply. “At best, Chinese!”\r\n\r\nThen he would add, with a significant wink: “Nothing can be, nothing\r\nought to be, original with the Indians, you understand! I like them\r\ngreatly, but they mustn’t be allowed to pride themselves upon anything,\r\nfor then they would take heart and turn into a lot of wretches.”\r\n\r\nAt other times he would say: “I love the Indians fondly, I’ve\r\nconstituted myself their father and defender, but it’s necessary to\r\nkeep everything in its proper place. Some were born to command and\r\nothers to serve—plainly, that is a truism which can’t be uttered very\r\nloudly, but it can be put into practise without many words. For look,\r\nthe trick depends upon trifles. When you wish to reduce a people to\r\nsubjection, assure it that it is in subjection. The first day it will\r\nlaugh, the second protest, the third doubt, and the fourth be\r\nconvinced. To keep the Filipino docile, he must have repeated to him\r\nday after day what he is, to convince him that he is incompetent. What\r\ngood would it do, besides, to have him believe in something else that\r\nwould make him wretched? Believe me, it’s an act of charity to hold\r\nevery creature in his place—that is order, harmony. That constitutes\r\nthe science of government.”\r\n\r\nIn referring to his policies, Don Custodio was not satisfied with the\r\nword art, and upon pronouncing the word government, he would extend his\r\nhand downwards to the height of a man bent over on his knees.\r\n\r\nIn regard to his religious ideas, he prided himself on being a\r\nCatholic, very much a Catholic—ah, Catholic Spain, the land of María\r\nSantísima! A liberal could be and ought to be a Catholic, when the\r\nreactionaries were setting themselves up as gods or saints, just as a\r\nmulatto passes for a white man in Kaffirland. But with all that, he ate\r\nmeat during Lent, except on Good Friday, never went to confession,\r\nbelieved neither in miracles nor the infallibility of the Pope, and\r\nwhen he attended mass, went to the one at ten o’clock, or to the\r\nshortest, the military mass. Although in Madrid he had spoken ill of\r\nthe religious orders, so as not to be out of harmony with his\r\nsurroundings, considering them anachronisms, and had hurled curses\r\nagainst the Inquisition, while relating this or that lurid or droll\r\nstory wherein the habits danced, or rather friars without habits, yet\r\nin speaking of the Philippines, which should be ruled by special laws,\r\nhe would cough, look wise, and again extend his hand downwards to that\r\nmysterious altitude.\r\n\r\n“The friars are necessary, they’re a necessary evil,” he would declare.\r\n\r\nBut how he would rage when any Indian dared to doubt the miracles or\r\ndid not acknowledge the Pope! All the tortures of the Inquisition were\r\ninsufficient to punish such temerity.\r\n\r\nWhen it was objected that to rule or to live at the expense of\r\nignorance has another and somewhat ugly name and is punished by law\r\nwhen the culprit is a single person, he would justify his position by\r\nreferring to other colonies. “We,” he would announce in his official\r\ntone, “can speak out plainly! We’re not like the British and the Dutch\r\nwho, in order to hold people in subjection, make use of the lash. We\r\navail ourselves of other means, milder and surer. The salutary\r\ninfluence of the friars is superior to the British lash.”\r\n\r\nThis last remark made his fortune. For a long time Ben-Zayb continued\r\nto use adaptations of it, and with him all Manila. The thinking part of\r\nManila applauded it, and it even got to Madrid, where it was quoted in\r\nthe Parliament as from a liberal of long residence there. The friars,\r\nflattered by the comparison and seeing their prestige enhanced, sent\r\nhim sacks of chocolate, presents which the incorruptible Don Custodio\r\nreturned, so that Ben-Zayb immediately compared him to Epaminondas.\r\nNevertheless, this modern Epaminondas made use of the rattan in his\r\ncholeric moments, and advised its use!\r\n\r\nAt that time the conventos, fearful that he would render a decision\r\nfavorable to the petition of the students, increased their gifts, so\r\nthat on the afternoon when we see him he was more perplexed than ever,\r\nhis reputation for energy was being compromised. It had been more than\r\na fortnight since he had had the petition in his hands, and only that\r\nmorning the high official, after praising his zeal, had asked for a\r\ndecision. Don Custodio had replied with mysterious gravity, giving him\r\nto understand that it was not yet completed. The high official had\r\nsmiled a smile that still worried and haunted him.\r\n\r\nAs we were saying, he yawned and yawned. In one of these movements, at\r\nthe moment when he opened his eyes and closed his mouth, his attention\r\nwas caught by a file of red envelopes, arranged in regular order on a\r\nmagnificent kamagon desk. On the back of each could be read in large\r\nletters: PROJECTS.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he forgot his troubles and Pepay’s pirouettes, to reflect\r\nupon all that those files contained, which had issued from his prolific\r\nbrain in his hours of inspiration. How many original ideas, how many\r\nsublime thoughts, how many means of ameliorating the woes of the\r\nPhilippines! Immortality and the gratitude of the country were surely\r\nhis!\r\n\r\nLike an old lover who discovers a moldy package of amorous epistles,\r\nDon Custodio arose and approached the desk. The first envelope, thick,\r\nswollen, and plethoric, bore the title: PROJECTS IN PROJECT.\r\n\r\n“No,” he murmured, “they’re excellent things, but it would take a year\r\nto read them over.”\r\n\r\nThe second, also quite voluminous, was entitled: PROJECTS UNDER\r\nCONSIDERATION. “No, not those either.”\r\n\r\nThen came the PROJECTS NEARING COMPLETION, PROJECTS PRESENTED, PROJECTS\r\nREJECTED, PROJECTS APPROVED, PROJECTS POSTPONED. These last envelopes\r\nheld little, but the least of all was that of the PROJECTS EXECUTED.\r\n\r\nDon Custodio wrinkled up his nose—what did it contain? He had\r\ncompletely forgotten what was in it. A sheet of yellowish paper showed\r\nfrom under the flap, as though the envelope were sticking out its\r\ntongue. This he drew out and unfolded: it was the famous project for\r\nthe School of Arts and Trades!\r\n\r\n“What the devil!” he exclaimed. “If the Augustinian padres took charge\r\nof it—”\r\n\r\nSuddenly he slapped his forehead and arched his eyebrows, while a look\r\nof triumph overspread his face. “I have reached a decision!” he cried\r\nwith an oath that was not exactly eureka. “My decision is made!”\r\n\r\nRepeating his peculiar eureka five or six times, which struck the air\r\nlike so many gleeful lashes, he sat down at his desk, radiant with joy,\r\nand began to write furiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nMANILA TYPES\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night there was a grand function at the Teatro de Variedades. Mr.\r\nJouay’s French operetta company was giving its initial performance, Les\r\nCloches de Corneville. To the eyes of the public was to be exhibited\r\nhis select troupe, whose fame the newspapers had for days been\r\nproclaiming. It was reported that among the actresses was a very\r\nbeautiful voice, with a figure even more beautiful, and if credit could\r\nbe given to rumor, her amiability surpassed even her voice and figure.\r\n\r\nAt half-past seven in the evening there were no more tickets to be had,\r\nnot even though they had been for Padre Salvi himself in his direct\r\nneed, and the persons waiting to enter the general admission already\r\nformed a long queue. In the ticket-office there were scuffles and\r\nfights, talk of filibusterism and races, but this did not produce any\r\ntickets, so that by a quarter before eight fabulous prices were being\r\noffered for them. The appearance of the building, profusely\r\nilluminated, with flowers and plants in all the doors and windows,\r\nenchanted the new arrivals to such an extent that they burst out into\r\nexclamations and applause. A large crowd surged about the entrance,\r\ngazing enviously at those going in, those who came early from fear of\r\nmissing their seats. Laughter, whispering, expectation greeted the\r\nlater arrivals, who disconsolately joined the curious crowd, and now\r\nthat they could not get in contented themselves with watching those who\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nYet there was one person who seemed out of place amid such great\r\neagerness and curiosity. He was a tall, meager man, who dragged one leg\r\nstiffly when he walked, dressed in a wretched brown coat and dirty\r\ncheckered trousers that fitted his lean, bony limbs tightly. A straw\r\nsombrero, artistic in spite of being broken, covered an enormous head\r\nand allowed his dirty gray, almost red, hair to straggle out long and\r\nkinky at the end like a poet’s curls. But the most notable thing about\r\nthis man was not his clothing or his European features, guiltless of\r\nbeard or mustache, but his fiery red face, from which he got the\r\nnickname by which he was known, Camaroncocido. [46] He was a curious\r\ncharacter belonging to a prominent Spanish family, but he lived like a\r\nvagabond and a beggar, scoffing at the prestige which he flouted\r\nindifferently with his rags. He was reputed to be a kind of reporter,\r\nand in fact his gray goggle-eyes, so cold and thoughtful, always showed\r\nup where anything publishable was happening. His manner of living was a\r\nmystery to all, as no one seemed to know where he ate and slept.\r\nPerhaps he had an empty hogshead somewhere.\r\n\r\nBut at that moment Camaroncocido lacked his usual hard and indifferent\r\nexpression, something like mirthful pity being reflected in his looks.\r\nA funny little man accosted him merrily.\r\n\r\n“Friend!” exclaimed the latter, in a raucous voice, as hoarse as a\r\nfrog’s, while he displayed several Mexican pesos, which Camaroncocido\r\nmerely glanced at and then shrugged his shoulders. What did they matter\r\nto him?\r\n\r\nThe little old man was a fitting contrast to him. Small, very small, he\r\nwore on his head a high hat, which presented the appearance of a huge\r\nhairy worm, and lost himself in an enormous frock coat, too wide and\r\ntoo long for him, to reappear in trousers too short, not reaching below\r\nhis calves. His body seemed to be the grandfather and his legs the\r\ngrandchildren, while as for his shoes he appeared to be floating on the\r\nland, for they were of an enormous sailor type, apparently protesting\r\nagainst the hairy worm worn on his head with all the energy of a\r\nconvento beside a World’s Exposition. If Camaroncocido was red, he was\r\nbrown; while the former, although of Spanish extraction, had not a\r\nsingle hair on his face, yet he, an Indian, had a goatee and mustache,\r\nboth long, white, and sparse. His expression was lively. He was known\r\nas Tio Quico, [47] and like his friend lived on publicity, advertising\r\nthe shows and posting the theatrical announcements, being perhaps the\r\nonly Filipino who could appear with impunity in a silk hat and frock\r\ncoat, just as his friend was the first Spaniard who laughed at the\r\nprestige of his race.\r\n\r\n“The Frenchman has paid me well,” he said smiling and showing his\r\npicturesque gums, which looked like a street after a conflagration. “I\r\ndid a good job in posting the bills.”\r\n\r\nCamaroncocido shrugged his shoulders again. “Quico,” he rejoined in a\r\ncavernous voice, “if they’ve given you six pesos for your work, how\r\nmuch will they give the friars?”\r\n\r\nTio Quico threw back his head in his usual lively manner. “To the\r\nfriars?”\r\n\r\n“Because you surely know,” continued Camaroncocido, “that all this\r\ncrowd was secured for them by the conventos.”\r\n\r\nThe fact was that the friars, headed by Padre Salvi, and some lay\r\nbrethren captained by Don Custodio, had opposed such shows. Padre\r\nCamorra, who could not attend, watered at the eyes and mouth, but\r\nargued with Ben-Zayb, who defended them feebly, thinking of the free\r\ntickets they would send his newspaper. Don Custodio spoke of morality,\r\nreligion, good manners, and the like.\r\n\r\n“But,” stammered the writer, “if our own farces with their plays on\r\nwords and phrases of double meaning—”\r\n\r\n“But at least they’re in Castilian!” the virtuous councilor interrupted\r\nwith a roar, inflamed to righteous wrath. “Obscenities in French, man,\r\nBen-Zayb, for God’s sake, in French! Never!”\r\n\r\nHe uttered this never with the energy of three Guzmans threatened with\r\nbeing killed like fleas if they did not surrender twenty Tarifas. Padre\r\nIrene naturally agreed with Don Custodio and execrated French operetta.\r\nWhew, he had been in Paris, but had never set foot in a theater, the\r\nLord deliver him!\r\n\r\nYet the French operetta also counted numerous partizans. The officers\r\nof the army and navy, among them the General’s aides, the clerks, and\r\nmany society people were anxious to enjoy the delicacies of the French\r\nlanguage from the mouths of genuine Parisiennes, and with them were\r\naffiliated those who had traveled by the M.M. [48] and had jabbered a\r\nlittle French during the voyage, those who had visited Paris, and all\r\nthose who wished to appear learned.\r\n\r\nHence, Manila society was divided into two factions, operettists and\r\nanti-operettists. The latter were supported by the elderly ladies,\r\nwives jealous and careful of their husbands’ love, and by those who\r\nwere engaged, while those who were free and those who were beautiful\r\ndeclared themselves enthusiastic operettists. Notes and then more notes\r\nwere exchanged, there were goings and comings, mutual recriminations,\r\nmeetings, lobbyings, arguments, even talk of an insurrection of the\r\nnatives, of their indolence, of inferior and superior races, of\r\nprestige and other humbugs, so that after much gossip and more\r\nrecrimination, the permit was granted, Padre Salvi at the same time\r\npublishing a pastoral that was read by no one but the proof-reader.\r\nThere were questionings whether the General had quarreled with the\r\nCountess, whether she spent her time in the halls of pleasure, whether\r\nHis Excellency was greatly annoyed, whether there had been presents\r\nexchanged, whether the French consul—, and so on and on. Many names\r\nwere bandied about: Quiroga the Chinaman’s, Simoun’s, and even those of\r\nmany actresses.\r\n\r\nThanks to these scandalous preliminaries, the people’s impatience had\r\nbeen aroused, and since the evening before, when the troupe arrived,\r\nthere was talk of nothing but attending the first performance. From the\r\nhour when the red posters announced Les Cloches de Corneville the\r\nvictors prepared to celebrate their triumph. In some offices, instead\r\nof the time being spent in reading newspapers and gossiping, it was\r\ndevoted to devouring the synopsis and spelling out French novels, while\r\nmany feigned business outside to consult their pocket-dictionaries on\r\nthe sly. So no business was transacted, callers were told to come back\r\nthe next day, but the public could not take offense, for they\r\nencountered some very polite and affable clerks, who received and\r\ndismissed them with grand salutations in the French style. The clerks\r\nwere practising, brushing the dust off their French, and calling to one\r\nanother oui, monsieur, s’il vous plait, and pardon! at every turn, so\r\nthat it was a pleasure to see and hear them.\r\n\r\nBut the place where the excitement reached its climax was the newspaper\r\noffice. Ben-Zayb, having been appointed critic and translator of the\r\nsynopsis, trembled like a poor woman accused of witchcraft, as he saw\r\nhis enemies picking out his blunders and throwing up to his face his\r\ndeficient knowledge of French. When the Italian opera was on, he had\r\nvery nearly received a challenge for having mistranslated a tenor’s\r\nname, while an envious rival had immediately published an article\r\nreferring to him as an ignoramus—him, the foremost thinking head in the\r\nPhilippines! All the trouble he had had to defend himself! He had had\r\nto write at least seventeen articles and consult fifteen dictionaries,\r\nso with these salutary recollections, the wretched Ben-Zayb moved about\r\nwith leaden hands, to say nothing of his feet, for that would be\r\nplagiarizing Padre Camorra, who had once intimated that the journalist\r\nwrote with them.\r\n\r\n“You see, Quico?” said Camaroncocido. “One half of the people have come\r\nbecause the friars told them not to, making it a kind of public\r\nprotest, and the other half because they say to themselves, ‘Do the\r\nfriars object to it? Then it must be instructive!’ Believe me, Quico,\r\nyour advertisements are a good thing but the pastoral was better, even\r\ntaking into consideration the fact that it was read by no one.”\r\n\r\n“Friend, do you believe,” asked Tio Quico uneasily, “that on account of\r\nthe competition with Padre Salvi my business will in the future be\r\nprohibited?”\r\n\r\n“Maybe so, Quico, maybe so,” replied the other, gazing at the sky.\r\n“Money’s getting scarce.”\r\n\r\nTio Quico muttered some incoherent words: if the friars were going to\r\nturn theatrical advertisers, he would become a friar. After bidding his\r\nfriend good-by, he moved away coughing and rattling his silver coins.\r\n\r\nWith his eternal indifference Camaroncocido continued to wander about\r\nhere and there with his crippled leg and sleepy looks. The arrival of\r\nunfamiliar faces caught his attention, coming as they did from\r\ndifferent parts and signaling to one another with a wink or a cough. It\r\nwas the first time that he had ever seen these individuals on such an\r\noccasion, he who knew all the faces and features in the city. Men with\r\ndark faces, humped shoulders, uneasy and uncertain movements, poorly\r\ndisguised, as though they had for the first time put on sack coats,\r\nslipped about among the shadows, shunning attention, instead of getting\r\nin the front rows where they could see well.\r\n\r\n“Detectives or thieves?” Camaroncocido asked himself and immediately\r\nshrugged his shoulders. “But what is it to me?”\r\n\r\nThe lamp of a carriage that drove up lighted in passing a group of four\r\nor five of these individuals talking with a man who appeared to be an\r\narmy officer.\r\n\r\n“Detectives! It must be a new corps,” he muttered with his shrug of\r\nindifference. Soon, however, he noticed that the officer, after\r\nspeaking to two or three more groups, approached a carriage and seemed\r\nto be talking vigorously with some person inside. Camaroncocido took a\r\nfew steps forward and without surprise thought that he recognized the\r\njeweler Simoun, while his sharp ears caught this short dialogue.\r\n\r\n“The signal will be a gunshot!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry—it’s the General who is ordering it, but be careful about\r\nsaying so. If you follow my instructions, you’ll get a promotion.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“So, be ready!”\r\n\r\nThe voice ceased and a second later the carriage drove away. In spite\r\nof his indifference Camaroncocido could not but mutter, “Something’s\r\nafoot—hands on pockets!”\r\n\r\nBut feeling his own to be empty, he again shrugged his shoulders. What\r\ndid it matter to him, even though the heavens should fall?\r\n\r\nSo he continued his pacing about. On passing near two persons engaged\r\nin conversation, he caught what one of them, who had rosaries and\r\nscapularies around his neck, was saying in Tagalog: “The friars are\r\nmore powerful than the General, don’t be a fool! He’ll go away and\r\nthey’ll stay here. So, if we do well, we’ll get rich. The signal is a\r\ngunshot.”\r\n\r\n“Hold hard, hold hard,” murmured Camaroncocido, tightening his fingers.\r\n“On that side the General, on this Padre Salvi. Poor country! But what\r\nis it to me?”\r\n\r\nAgain shrugging his shoulders and expectorating at the same time, two\r\nactions that with him were indications of supreme indifference, he\r\ncontinued his observations.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the carriages were arriving in dizzy streams, stopping\r\ndirectly before the door to set down the members of the select society.\r\nAlthough the weather was scarcely even cool, the ladies sported\r\nmagnificent shawls, silk neckerchiefs, and even light cloaks. Among the\r\nescorts, some who were in frock coats with white ties wore overcoats,\r\nwhile others carried them on their arms to display the rich silk\r\nlinings.\r\n\r\nIn a group of spectators, Tadeo, he who was always taken ill the moment\r\nthe professor appeared, was accompanied by a fellow townsman of his,\r\nthe novice whom we saw suffer evil consequences from reading wrongly\r\nthe Cartesian principle. This novice was very inquisitive and addicted\r\nto tiresome questions, and Tadeo was taking advantage of his\r\ningenuousness and inexperience to relate to him the most stupendous\r\nlies. Every Spaniard that spoke to him, whether clerkling or underling,\r\nwas presented as a leading merchant, a marquis, or a count, while on\r\nthe other hand any one who passed him by was a greenhorn, a petty\r\nofficial, a nobody! When pedestrians failed him in keeping up the\r\nnovice’s astonishment, he resorted to the resplendent carriages that\r\ncame up. Tadeo would bow politely, wave his hand in a friendly manner,\r\nand call out a familiar greeting.\r\n\r\n“Who’s he?”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” was the negligent reply. “The Civil Governor, the Vice-Governor,\r\nJudge ——, Señora ——, all friends of mine!”\r\n\r\nThe novice marveled and listened in fascination, taking care to keep on\r\nthe left. Tadeo the friend of judges and governors!\r\n\r\nTadeo named all the persons who arrived, when he did not know them\r\ninventing titles, biographies, and interesting sketches.\r\n\r\n“You see that tall gentleman with dark whiskers, somewhat squint-eyed,\r\ndressed in black—he’s Judge A ——, an intimate friend of the wife of\r\nColonel B ——. One day if it hadn’t been for me they would have come to\r\nblows. Hello, here comes that Colonel! What if they should fight?”\r\n\r\nThe novice held his breath, but the colonel and the judge shook hands\r\ncordially, the soldier, an old bachelor, inquiring about the health of\r\nthe judge’s family.\r\n\r\n“Ah, thank heaven!” breathed Tadeo. “I’m the one who made them\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\n“What if they should invite us to go in?” asked the novice timidly.\r\n\r\n“Get out, boy! I never accept favors!” retorted Tadeo majestically. “I\r\nconfer them, but disinterestedly.”\r\n\r\nThe novice bit his lip and felt smaller than ever, while he placed a\r\nrespectful distance between himself and his fellow townsman.\r\n\r\nTadeo resumed: “That is the musician H——; that one, the lawyer J——, who\r\ndelivered as his own a speech printed in all the books and was\r\ncongratulated and admired for it; Doctor K——, that man just getting out\r\nof a hansom, is a specialist in diseases of children, so he’s called\r\nHerod; that’s the banker L——, who can talk only of his money and his\r\nhoards; the poet M——, who is always dealing with the stars and the\r\nbeyond. There goes the beautiful wife of N——, whom Padre Q——is\r\naccustomed to meet when he calls upon the absent husband; the Jewish\r\nmerchant P——, who came to the islands with a thousand pesos and is now\r\na millionaire. That fellow with the long beard is the physician R——,\r\nwho has become rich by making invalids more than by curing them.”\r\n\r\n“Making invalids?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, boy, in the examination of the conscripts. Attention! That finely\r\ndressed gentleman is not a physician but a homeopathist sui generis—he\r\nprofesses completely the similis similibus. The young cavalry captain\r\nwith him is his chosen disciple. That man in a light suit with his hat\r\ntilted back is the government clerk whose maxim is never to be polite\r\nand who rages like a demon when he sees a hat on any one else’s\r\nhead—they say that he does it to ruin the German hatters. The man just\r\narriving with his family is the wealthy merchant C——, who has an income\r\nof over a hundred thousand pesos. But what would you say if I should\r\ntell you that he still owes me four pesos, five reales, and twelve\r\ncuartos? But who would collect from a rich man like him?”\r\n\r\n“That gentleman in debt to you?”\r\n\r\n“Sure! One day I got him out of a bad fix. It was on a Friday at\r\nhalf-past six in the morning, I still remember, because I hadn’t\r\nbreakfasted. That lady who is followed by a duenna is the celebrated\r\nPepay, the dancing girl, but she doesn’t dance any more now that a very\r\nCatholic gentleman and a great friend of mine has—forbidden it. There’s\r\nthe death’s-head Z——, who’s surely following her to get her to dance\r\nagain. He’s a good fellow, and a great friend of mine, but has one\r\ndefect—he’s a Chinese mestizo and yet calls himself a Peninsular\r\nSpaniard. Sssh! Look at Ben-Zayb, him with the face of a friar, who’s\r\ncarrying a pencil and a roll of paper in his hand. He’s the great\r\nwriter, Ben-Zayb, a good friend of mine—he has talent!”\r\n\r\n“You don’t say! And that little man with white whiskers?”\r\n\r\n“He’s the official who has appointed his daughters, those three little\r\ngirls, assistants in his department, so as to get their names on the\r\npay-roll. He’s a clever man, very clever! When he makes a mistake he\r\nblames it on somebody else, he buys things and pays for them out of the\r\ntreasury. He’s clever, very, very clever!”\r\n\r\nTadeo was about to say more, but suddenly checked himself.\r\n\r\n“And that gentleman who has a fierce air and gazes at everybody over\r\nhis shoulders?” inquired the novice, pointing to a man who nodded\r\nhaughtily.\r\n\r\nBut Tadeo did not answer. He was craning his neck to see Paulita Gomez,\r\nwho was approaching with a friend, Doña Victorina, and Juanito Pelaez.\r\nThe latter had presented her with a box and was more humped than ever.\r\n\r\nCarriage after carriage drove up; the actors and actresses arrived and\r\nentered by a separate door, followed by their friends and admirers.\r\n\r\nAfter Paulita had gone in, Tadeo resumed: “Those are the nieces of the\r\nrich Captain D——, those coming up in a landau; you see how pretty and\r\nhealthy they are? Well, in a few years they’ll be dead or crazy.\r\nCaptain D—— is opposed to their marrying, and the insanity of the uncle\r\nis appearing in the nieces. That’s the Señorita E——, the rich heiress\r\nwhom the world and the conventos are disputing over. Hello, I know that\r\nfellow! It’s Padre Irene, in disguise, with a false mustache. I\r\nrecognize him by his nose. And he was so greatly opposed to this!”\r\n\r\nThe scandalized novice watched a neatly cut coat disappear behind a\r\ngroup of ladies.\r\n\r\n“The Three Fates!” went on Tadeo, watching the arrival of three\r\nwithered, bony, hollow-eyed, wide-mouthed, and shabbily dressed women.\r\n“They’re called—”\r\n\r\n“Atropos?” ventured the novice, who wished to show that he also knew\r\nsomebody, at least in mythology.\r\n\r\n“No, boy, they’re called the Weary Waiters—old, censorious, and dull.\r\nThey pretend to hate everybody—men, women, and children. But look how\r\nthe Lord always places beside the evil a remedy, only that sometimes it\r\ncomes late. There behind the Fates, the frights of the city, come those\r\nthree girls, the pride of their friends, among whom I count myself.\r\nThat thin young man with goggle-eyes, somewhat stooped, who is wildly\r\ngesticulating because he can’t get tickets, is the chemist S——, author\r\nof many essays and scientific treatises, some of which are notable and\r\nhave captured prizes. The Spaniards say of him, ‘There’s some hope for\r\nhim, some hope for him.’ The fellow who is soothing him with his\r\nVoltairian smile is the poet T——, a young man of talent, a great friend\r\nof mine, and, for the very reason that he has talent, he has thrown\r\naway his pen. That fellow who is trying to get in with the actors by\r\nthe other door is the young physician U——, who has effected some\r\nremarkable cures—it’s also said of him that he promises well. He’s not\r\nsuch a scoundrel as Pelaez but he’s cleverer and slyer still. I believe\r\nthat he’d shake dice with death and win.”\r\n\r\n“And that brown gentleman with a mustache like hog-bristles?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, that’s the merchant F——, who forges everything, even his baptismal\r\ncertificate. He wants to be a Spanish mestizo at any cost, and is\r\nmaking heroic efforts to forget his native language.”\r\n\r\n“But his daughters are very white.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s the reason rice has gone up in price, and yet they eat\r\nnothing but bread.”\r\n\r\nThe novice did not understand the connection between the price of rice\r\nand the whiteness of those girls, but he held his peace.\r\n\r\n“There goes the fellow that’s engaged to one of them, that thin brown\r\nyouth who is following them with a lingering movement and speaking with\r\na protecting air to the three friends who are laughing at him. He’s a\r\nmartyr to his beliefs, to his consistency.”\r\n\r\nThe novice was filled with admiration and respect for the young man.\r\n\r\n“He has the look of a fool, and he is one,” continued Tadeo. “He was\r\nborn in San Pedro Makati and has inflicted many privations upon\r\nhimself. He scarcely ever bathes or eats pork, because, according to\r\nhim, the Spaniards don’t do those things, and for the same reason he\r\ndoesn’t eat rice and dried fish, although he may be watering at the\r\nmouth and dying of hunger. Anything that comes from Europe, rotten or\r\npreserved, he considers divine—a month ago Basilio cured him of a\r\nsevere attack of gastritis, for he had eaten a jar of mustard to prove\r\nthat he’s a European.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment the orchestra struck up a waltz.\r\n\r\n“You see that gentleman—that hypochondriac who goes along turning his\r\nhead from side to side, seeking salutes? That’s the celebrated governor\r\nof Pangasinan, a good man who loses his appetite whenever any Indian\r\nfails to salute him. He would have died if he hadn’t issued the\r\nproclamation about salutes to which he owes his celebrity. Poor fellow,\r\nit’s only been three days since he came from the province and look how\r\nthin he has become! Oh, here’s the great man, the illustrious—open your\r\neyes!”\r\n\r\n“Who? That man with knitted brows?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s Don Custodio, the liberal, Don Custodio. His brows are\r\nknit because he’s meditating over some important project. If the ideas\r\nhe has in his head were carried out, this would be a different world!\r\nAh, here comes Makaraig, your housemate.”\r\n\r\nIt was in fact Makaraig, with Pecson, Sandoval, and Isagani. Upon\r\nseeing them, Tadeo advanced and spoke to them.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you coming in?” Makaraig asked him.\r\n\r\n“We haven’t been able to get tickets.”\r\n\r\n“Fortunately, we have a box,” replied Makaraig. “Basilio couldn’t come.\r\nBoth of you, come in with us.”\r\n\r\nTadeo did not wait for the invitation to be repeated, but the novice,\r\nfearing that he would intrude, with the timidity natural to the\r\nprovincial Indian, excused himself, nor could he be persuaded to enter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE PERFORMANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interior of the theater presented a lively aspect. It was filled\r\nfrom top to bottom, with people standing in the corridors and in the\r\naisles, fighting to withdraw a head from some hole where they had\r\ninserted it, or to shove an eye between a collar and an ear. The open\r\nboxes, occupied for the most part by ladies, looked like baskets of\r\nflowers, whose petals—the fans—shook in a light breeze, wherein hummed\r\na thousand bees. However, just as there are flowers of strong or\r\ndelicate fragrance, flowers that kill and flowers that console, so from\r\nour baskets were exhaled like emanations: there were to be heard\r\ndialogues, conversations, remarks that bit and stung. Three or four\r\nboxes, however, were still vacant, in spite of the lateness of the\r\nhour. The performance had been advertised for half-past eight and it\r\nwas already a quarter to nine, but the curtain did not go up, as his\r\nExcellency had not yet arrived. The gallery-gods, impatient and\r\nuncomfortable in their seats, started a racket, clapping their hands\r\nand pounding the floor with their canes.\r\n\r\n“Boom—boom—boom! Ring up the curtain! Boom—boom—boom!”\r\n\r\nThe artillerymen were not the least noisy. Emulators of Mars, as\r\nBen-Zayb called them, they were not satisfied with this music; thinking\r\nthemselves perhaps at a bullfight, they made remarks at the ladies who\r\npassed before them in words that are euphemistically called flowers in\r\nMadrid, although at times they seem more like foul weeds. Without\r\nheeding the furious looks of the husbands, they bandied from one to\r\nanother the sentiments and longings inspired by so many beauties.\r\n\r\nIn the reserved seats, where the ladies seemed to be afraid to venture,\r\nas few were to be seen there, a murmur of voices prevailed amid\r\nsuppressed laughter and clouds of tobacco smoke. They discussed the\r\nmerits of the players and talked scandal, wondering if his Excellency\r\nhad quarreled with the friars, if his presence at such a show was a\r\ndefiance or mere curiosity. Others gave no heed to these matters, but\r\nwere engaged in attracting the attention of the ladies, throwing\r\nthemselves into attitudes more or less interesting and statuesque,\r\nflashing diamond rings, especially when they thought themselves the\r\nfoci of insistent opera-glasses, while yet another would address a\r\nrespectful salute to this or that señora or señorita, at the same time\r\nlowering his head gravely to whisper to a neighbor, “How ridiculous she\r\nis! And such a bore!”\r\n\r\nThe lady would respond with one of her most gracious smiles and an\r\nenchanting nod of her head, while murmuring to a friend sitting near,\r\namid lazy flourishes of her fan, “How impudent he is! He’s madly in\r\nlove, my dear.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the noise increased. There remained only two vacant boxes,\r\nbesides that of his Excellency, which was distinguished by its curtains\r\nof red velvet. The orchestra played another waltz, the audience\r\nprotested, when fortunately there arose a charitable hero to distract\r\ntheir attention and relieve the manager, in the person of a man who had\r\noccupied a reserved seat and refused to give it up to its owner, the\r\nphilosopher Don Primitivo. Finding his own arguments useless, Don\r\nPrimitivo had appealed to an usher. “I don’t care to,” the hero\r\nresponded to the latter’s protests, placidly puffing at his cigarette.\r\nThe usher appealed to the manager. “I don’t care to,” was the response,\r\nas he settled back in the seat. The manager went away, while the\r\nartillerymen in the gallery began to sing out encouragement to the\r\nusurper.\r\n\r\nOur hero, now that he had attracted general attention, thought that to\r\nyield would be to lower himself, so he held on to the seat, while he\r\nrepeated his answer to a pair of guards the manager had called in.\r\nThese, in consideration of the rebel’s rank, went in search of their\r\ncorporal, while the whole house broke out into applause at the firmness\r\nof the hero, who remained seated like a Roman senator.\r\n\r\nHisses were heard, and the inflexible gentleman turned angrily to see\r\nif they were meant for him, but the galloping of horses resounded and\r\nthe stir increased. One might have said that a revolution had broken\r\nout, or at least a riot, but no, the orchestra had suspended the waltz\r\nand was playing the royal march: it was his Excellency, the\r\nCaptain-General and Governor of the islands, who was entering. All eyes\r\nsought and followed him, then lost sight of him, until he finally\r\nappeared in his box. After looking all about him and making some\r\npersons happy with a lordly salute, he sat down, as though he were\r\nindeed the man for whom the chair was waiting. The artillerymen then\r\nbecame silent and the orchestra tore into the prelude.\r\n\r\nOur students occupied a box directly facing that of Pepay, the dancing\r\ngirl. Her box was a present from Makaraig, who had already got on good\r\nterms with her in order to propitiate Don Custodio. Pepay had that very\r\nafternoon written a note to the illustrious arbiter, asking for an\r\nanswer and appointing an interview in the theater. For this reason, Don\r\nCustodio, in spite of the active opposition he had manifested toward\r\nthe French operetta, had gone to the theater, which action won him some\r\ncaustic remarks on the part of Don Manuel, his ancient adversary in the\r\nsessions of the Ayuntamiento.\r\n\r\n“I’ve come to judge the operetta,” he had replied in the tone of a Cato\r\nwhose conscience was clear.\r\n\r\nSo Makaraig was exchanging looks of intelligence with Pepay, who was\r\ngiving him to understand that she had something to tell him. As the\r\ndancing girl’s face wore a happy expression, the students augured that\r\na favorable outcome was assured. Sandoval, who had just returned from\r\nmaking calls in other boxes, also assured them that the decision had\r\nbeen favorable, that that very afternoon the Superior Commission had\r\nconsidered and approved it. Every one was jubilant, even Pecson having\r\nlaid aside his pessimism when he saw the smiling Pepay display a note.\r\nSandoval and Makaraig congratulated one another, Isagani alone\r\nremaining cold and unsmiling. What had happened to this young man?\r\n\r\nUpon entering the theater, Isagani had caught sight of Paulita in a\r\nbox, with Juanito Pelaez talking to her. He had turned pale, thinking\r\nthat he must be mistaken. But no, it was she herself, she who greeted\r\nhim with a gracious smile, while her beautiful eyes seemed to be asking\r\npardon and promising explanations. The fact was that they had agreed\r\nupon Isagani’s going first to the theater to see if the show contained\r\nanything improper for a young woman, but now he found her there, and in\r\nno other company than that of his rival. What passed in his mind is\r\nindescribable: wrath, jealousy, humiliation, resentment raged within\r\nhim, and there were moments even when he wished that the theater would\r\nfall in; he had a violent desire to laugh aloud, to insult his\r\nsweetheart, to challenge his rival, to make a scene, but finally\r\ncontented himself with sitting quiet and not looking at her at all. He\r\nwas conscious of the beautiful plans Makaraig and Sandoval were making,\r\nbut they sounded like distant echoes, while the notes of the waltz\r\nseemed sad and lugubrious, the whole audience stupid and foolish, and\r\nseveral times he had to make an effort to keep back the tears. Of the\r\ntrouble stirred up by the hero who refused to give up the seat, of the\r\narrival of the Captain-General, he was scarcely conscious. He stared\r\ntoward the drop-curtain, on which was depicted a kind of gallery with\r\nsumptuous red hangings, affording a view of a garden in which a\r\nfountain played, yet how sad the gallery looked to him and how\r\nmelancholy the painted landscape! A thousand vague recollections surged\r\ninto his memory like distant echoes of music heard in the night, like\r\nsongs of infancy, the murmur of lonely forests and gloomy rivulets,\r\nmoonlit nights on the shore of the sea spread wide before his eyes. So\r\nthe enamored youth considered himself very wretched and stared fixedly\r\nat the ceiling so that the tears should not fall from his eyes.\r\n\r\nA burst of applause drew him from these meditations. The curtain had\r\njust risen, and the merry chorus of peasants of Corneville was\r\npresented, all dressed in cotton caps, with heavy wooden sabots on\r\ntheir feet. Some six or seven girls, well-rouged on the lips and\r\ncheeks, with large black circles around their eyes to increase their\r\nbrilliance, displayed white arms, fingers covered with diamonds, round\r\nand shapely limbs. While they were chanting the Norman phrase “Allez,\r\nmarchez! Allez, marchez!” they smiled at their different admirers in\r\nthe reserved seats with such openness that Don Custodio, after looking\r\ntoward Pepay’s box to assure himself that she was not doing the same\r\nthing with some other admirer, set down in his note-book this\r\nindecency, and to make sure of it lowered his head a little to see if\r\nthe actresses were not showing their knees.\r\n\r\n“Oh, these Frenchwomen!” he muttered, while his imagination lost itself\r\nin considerations somewhat more elevated, as he made comparisons and\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n“Quoi v’la tous les cancans d’la s’maine!” sang Gertrude, a proud\r\ndamsel, who was looking roguishly askance at the Captain-General.\r\n\r\n“We’re going to have the cancan!” exclaimed Tadeo, the winner of the\r\nfirst prize in the French class, who had managed to make out this word.\r\n“Makaraig, they’re going to dance the cancan!”\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his hands gleefully. From the moment the curtain rose, Tadeo\r\nhad been heedless of the music. He was looking only for the prurient,\r\nthe indecent, the immoral in actions and dress, and with his scanty\r\nFrench was sharpening his ears to catch the obscenities that the\r\naustere guardians of the fatherland had foretold.\r\n\r\nSandoval, pretending to know French, had converted himself into a kind\r\nof interpreter for his friends. He knew as much about it as Tadeo, but\r\nthe published synopsis helped him and his fancy supplied the rest.\r\n“Yes,” he said, “they’re going to dance the cancan—she’s going to lead\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nMakaraig and Pecson redoubled their attention, smiling in anticipation,\r\nwhile Isagani looked away, mortified to think that Paulita should be\r\npresent at such a show and reflecting that it was his duty to challenge\r\nJuanito Pelaez the next day.\r\n\r\nBut the young men waited in vain. Serpolette came on, a charming girl,\r\nin her cotton cap, provoking and challenging. “Hein, qui parle de\r\nSerpolette?” she demanded of the gossips, with her arms akimbo in a\r\ncombative attitude. Some one applauded, and after him all those in the\r\nreserved seats. Without changing her girlish attitude, Serpolette gazed\r\nat the person who had started the applause and paid him with a smile,\r\ndisplaying rows of little teeth that looked like a string of pearls in\r\na case of red velvet.\r\n\r\nTadeo followed her gaze and saw a man in a false mustache with an\r\nextraordinarily large nose. “By the monk’s cowl!” he exclaimed. “It’s\r\nIrene!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” corroborated Sandoval, “I saw him behind the scenes talking with\r\nthe actresses.”\r\n\r\nThe truth was that Padre Irene, who was a melomaniac of the first\r\ndegree and knew French well, had been sent to the theater by Padre\r\nSalvi as a sort of religious detective, or so at least he told the\r\npersons who recognized him. As a faithful critic, who should not be\r\nsatisfied with viewing the piece from a distance, he wished to examine\r\nthe actresses at first hand, so he had mingled in the groups of\r\nadmirers and gallants, had penetrated into the greenroom, where was\r\nwhispered and talked a French required by the situation, a market\r\nFrench, a language that is readily comprehensible for the vender when\r\nthe buyer seems disposed to pay well.\r\n\r\nSerpolette was surrounded by two gallant officers, a sailor, and a\r\nlawyer, when she caught sight of him moving about, sticking the tip of\r\nhis long nose into all the nooks and corners, as though with it he were\r\nferreting out all the mysteries of the stage. She ceased her chatter,\r\nknitted her eyebrows, then raised them, opened her lips and with the\r\nvivacity of a Parisienne left her admirers to hurl herself like a\r\ntorpedo upon our critic.\r\n\r\n“Tiens, tiens, Toutou! Mon lapin!” she cried, catching Padre Irene’s\r\narm and shaking it merrily, while the air rang with her silvery laugh.\r\n\r\n“Tut, tut!” objected Padre Irene, endeavoring to conceal himself.\r\n\r\n“Mais, comment! Toi ici, grosse bête! Et moi qui t’croyais—”\r\n\r\n“’Tais pas d’tapage, Lily! Il faut m’respecter! ’Suis ici l’Pape!”\r\n\r\nWith great difficulty Padre Irene made her listen to reason, for Lily\r\nwas enchanteé to meet in Manila an old friend who reminded her of the\r\ncoulisses of the Grand Opera House. So it was that Padre Irene,\r\nfulfilling at the same time his duties as a friend and a critic, had\r\ninitiated the applause to encourage her, for Serpolette deserved it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the young men were waiting for the cancan. Pecson became all\r\neyes, but there was everything except cancan. There was presented the\r\nscene in which, but for the timely arrival of the representatives of\r\nthe law, the women would have come to blows and torn one another’s hair\r\nout, incited thereto by the mischievous peasants, who, like our\r\nstudents, hoped to see something more than the cancan.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Scit, scit, scit, scit, scit, scit,\r\n        Disputez-vous, battez-vous,\r\n        Scit, scit, scit, scit, scit, scit,\r\n        Nous allons compter les coups.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe music ceased, the men went away, the women returned, a few at a\r\ntime, and started a conversation among themselves, of which our friends\r\nunderstood nothing. They were slandering some absent person.\r\n\r\n“They look like the Chinamen of the pansiteria!” whispered Pecson.\r\n\r\n“But, the cancan?” asked Makaraig.\r\n\r\n“They’re talking about the most suitable place to dance it,” gravely\r\nresponded Sandoval.\r\n\r\n“They look like the Chinamen of the pansiteria,” repeated Pecson in\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\nA lady accompanied by her husband entered at that moment and took her\r\nplace in one of the two vacant boxes. She had the air of a queen and\r\ngazed disdainfully at the whole house, as if to say, “I’ve come later\r\nthan all of you, you crowd of upstarts and provincials, I’ve come later\r\nthan you!” There are persons who go to the theater like the contestants\r\nin a mule-race: the last one in, wins, and we know very sensible men\r\nwho would ascend the scaffold rather than enter a theater before the\r\nfirst act. But the lady’s triumph was of short duration—she caught\r\nsight of the other box that was still empty, and began to scold her\r\nbetter half, thus starting such a disturbance that many were annoyed.\r\n\r\n“Ssh! Ssh!”\r\n\r\n“The blockheads! As if they understood French!” remarked the lady,\r\ngazing with supreme disdain in all directions, finally fixing her\r\nattention on Juanito’s box, whence she thought she had heard an\r\nimpudent hiss.\r\n\r\nJuanito was in fact guilty, for he had been pretending to understand\r\neverything, holding himself up proudly and applauding at times as\r\nthough nothing that was said escaped him, and this too without guiding\r\nhimself by the actors’ pantomime, because he scarcely looked toward the\r\nstage. The rogue had intentionally remarked to Paulita that, as there\r\nwas so much more beautiful a woman close at hand, he did not care to\r\nstrain his eyes looking beyond her. Paulita had blushed, covered her\r\nface with her fan, and glanced stealthily toward where Isagani, silent\r\nand morose, was abstractedly watching the show.\r\n\r\nPaulita felt nettled and jealous. Would Isagani fall in love with any\r\nof those alluring actresses? The thought put her in a bad humor, so she\r\nscarcely heard the praises that Doña Victorina was heaping upon her own\r\nfavorite.\r\n\r\nJuanito was playing his part well: he shook his head at times in sign\r\nof disapproval, and then there could be heard coughs and murmurs in\r\nsome parts, at other times he smiled in approbation, and a second later\r\napplause resounded. Doña Victorina was charmed, even conceiving some\r\nvague ideas of marrying the young man the day Don Tiburcio should\r\ndie—Juanito knew French and De Espadaña didn’t! Then she began to\r\nflatter him, nor did he perceive the change in the drift of her talk,\r\nso occupied was he in watching a Catalan merchant who was sitting next\r\nto the Swiss consul. Having observed that they were conversing in\r\nFrench, Juanito was getting his inspiration from their countenances,\r\nand thus grandly giving the cue to those about him.\r\n\r\nScene followed scene, character succeeded character, comic and\r\nridiculous like the bailiff and Grenicheux, imposing and winsome like\r\nthe marquis and Germaine. The audience laughed heartily at the slap\r\ndelivered by Gaspard and intended for the coward Grenicheux, which was\r\nreceived by the grave bailiff, whose wig went flying through the air,\r\nproducing disorder and confusion as the curtain dropped.\r\n\r\n“Where’s the cancan?” inquired Tadeo.\r\n\r\nBut the curtain rose again immediately, revealing a scene in a servant\r\nmarket, with three posts on which were affixed signs bearing the\r\nannouncements: servantes, cochers, and domestiques. Juanito, to improve\r\nthe opportunity, turned to Doña Victorina and said in a loud voice, so\r\nthat Paulita might hear and be convinced of his learning:\r\n\r\n“Servantes means servants, domestiques domestics.”\r\n\r\n“And in what way do the servantes differ from the domestiques?” asked\r\nPaulita.\r\n\r\nJuanito was not found wanting. “Domestiques are those that are\r\ndomesticated—haven’t you noticed that some of them have the air of\r\nsavages? Those are the servantes.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” added Doña Victorina, “some have very bad manners—and\r\nyet I thought that in Europe everybody was cultivated. But as it\r\nhappens in France,—well, I see!”\r\n\r\n“Ssh! Ssh!”\r\n\r\nBut what was Juanito’s predicament when the time came for the opening\r\nof the market and the beginning of the sale, and the servants who were\r\nto be hired placed themselves beside the signs that indicated their\r\nclass! The men, some ten or twelve rough characters in livery, carrying\r\nbranches in their hands, took their place under the sign domestiques!\r\n\r\n“Those are the domestics,” explained Juanito.\r\n\r\n“Really, they have the appearance of being only recently domesticated,”\r\nobserved Doña Victorina. “Now let’s have a look at the savages.”\r\n\r\nThen the dozen girls headed by the lively and merry Serpolette, decked\r\nout in their best clothes, each wearing a big bouquet of flowers at the\r\nwaist, laughing, smiling, fresh and attractive, placed themselves, to\r\nJuanito’s great desperation, beside the post of the servantes.\r\n\r\n“How’s this?” asked Paulita guilelessly. “Are those the savages that\r\nyou spoke of?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the imperturbable Juanito, “there’s a mistake—they’ve got\r\ntheir places mixed—those coming behind—”\r\n\r\n“Those with the whips?”\r\n\r\nJuanito nodded assent, but he was rather perplexed and uneasy.\r\n\r\n“So those girls are the cochers?”\r\n\r\nHere Juanito was attacked by such a violent fit of coughing that some\r\nof the spectators became annoyed.\r\n\r\n“Put him out! Put the consumptive out!” called a voice.\r\n\r\nConsumptive! To be called a consumptive before Paulita! Juanito wanted\r\nto find the blackguard and make him swallow that “consumptive.”\r\nObserving that the women were trying to hold him back, his bravado\r\nincreased, and he became more conspicuously ferocious. But fortunately\r\nit was Don Custodio who had made the diagnosis, and he, fearful of\r\nattracting attention to himself, pretended to hear nothing, apparently\r\nbusy with his criticism of the play.\r\n\r\n“If it weren’t that I am with you,” remarked Juanito, rolling his eyes\r\nlike some dolls that are moved by clockwork, and to make the\r\nresemblance more real he stuck out his tongue occasionally.\r\n\r\nThus that night he acquired in Doña Victorina’s eyes the reputation of\r\nbeing brave and punctilious, so she decided in her heart that she would\r\nmarry him just as soon as Don Tiburcio was out of the way. Paulita\r\nbecame sadder and sadder in thinking about how the girls called cochers\r\ncould occupy Isagani’s attention, for the name had certain disagreeable\r\nassociations that came from the slang of her convent school-days.\r\n\r\nAt length the first act was concluded, the marquis taking away as\r\nservants Serpolette and Germaine, the representative of timid beauty in\r\nthe troupe, and for coachman the stupid Grenicheux. A burst of applause\r\nbrought them out again holding hands, those who five seconds before had\r\nbeen tormenting one another and were about to come to blows, bowing and\r\nsmiling here and there to the gallant Manila public and exchanging\r\nknowing looks with various spectators.\r\n\r\nWhile there prevailed the passing tumult occasioned by those who\r\ncrowded one another to get into the greenroom and felicitate the\r\nactresses and by those who were going to make calls on the ladies in\r\nthe boxes, some expressed their opinions of the play and the players.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly, Serpolette is the best,” said one with a knowing air.\r\n\r\n“I prefer Germaine, she’s an ideal blonde.”\r\n\r\n“But she hasn’t any voice.”\r\n\r\n“What do I care about the voice?”\r\n\r\n“Well, for shape, the tall one.”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw,” said Ben-Zayb, “not a one is worth a straw, not a one is an\r\nartist!”\r\n\r\nBen-Zayb was the critic for El Grito de la Integridad, and his\r\ndisdainful air gave him great importance in the eyes of those who were\r\nsatisfied with so little.\r\n\r\n“Serpolette hasn’t any voice, nor Germaine grace, nor is that music,\r\nnor is it art, nor is it anything!” he concluded with marked contempt.\r\nTo set oneself up as a great critic there is nothing like appearing to\r\nbe discontented with everything. Besides, the management had sent only\r\ntwo seats for the newspaper staff.\r\n\r\nIn the boxes curiosity was aroused as to who could be the possessor of\r\nthe empty one, for that person, would surpass every one in chic, since\r\nhe would be the last to arrive. The rumor started somewhere that it\r\nbelonged to Simoun, and was confirmed: no one had seen the jeweler in\r\nthe reserved seats, the greenroom, or anywhere else.\r\n\r\n“Yet I saw him this afternoon with Mr. Jouay,” some one said. “He\r\npresented a necklace to one of the actresses.”\r\n\r\n“To which one?” asked some of the inquisitive ladies.\r\n\r\n“To the finest of all, the one who made eyes at his Excellency.”\r\n\r\nThis information was received with looks of intelligence, winks,\r\nexclamations of doubt, of confirmation, and half-uttered commentaries.\r\n\r\n“He’s trying to play the Monte Cristo,” remarked a lady who prided\r\nherself on being literary.\r\n\r\n“Or purveyor to the Palace!” added her escort, jealous of Simoun.\r\n\r\nIn the students’ box, Pecson, Sandoval, and Isagani had remained, while\r\nTadeo had gone to engage Don Custodio in conversation about his\r\nprojects, and Makaraig to hold an interview with Pepay.\r\n\r\n“In no way, as I have observed to you before, friend Isagani,” declared\r\nSandoval with violent gestures and a sonorous voice, so that the ladies\r\nnear the box, the daughters of the rich man who was in debt to Tadeo,\r\nmight hear him, “in no way does the French language possess the rich\r\nsonorousness or the varied and elegant cadence of the Castilian tongue.\r\nI cannot conceive, I cannot imagine, I cannot form any idea of French\r\norators, and I doubt that they have ever had any or can have any now in\r\nthe strict construction of the term orator, because we must not confuse\r\nthe name orator with the words babbler and charlatan, for these can\r\nexist in any country, in all the regions of the inhabited world, among\r\nthe cold and curt Englishmen as among the lively and impressionable\r\nFrenchmen.”\r\n\r\nThus he delivered a magnificent review of the nations, with his\r\npoetical characterizations and most resounding epithets. Isagani nodded\r\nassent, with his thoughts fixed on Paulita, whom he had surprised\r\ngazing at him with an expressive look which contained a wealth of\r\nmeaning. He tried to divine what those eyes were expressing—those eyes\r\nthat were so eloquent and not at all deceptive.\r\n\r\n“Now you who are a poet, a slave to rhyme and meter, a son of the\r\nMuses,” continued Sandoval, with an elegant wave of his hand, as though\r\nhe were saluting, on the horizon, the Nine Sisters, “do you comprehend,\r\ncan you conceive, how a language so harsh and unmusical as French can\r\ngive birth to poets of such gigantic stature as our Garcilasos, our\r\nHerreras, our Esproncedas, our Calderons?”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” objected Pecson, “Victor Hugo—”\r\n\r\n“Victor Hugo, my friend Pecson, if Victor Hugo is a poet, it is because\r\nhe owes it to Spain, because it is an established fact, it is a matter\r\nbeyond all doubt, a thing admitted even by the Frenchmen themselves, so\r\nenvious of Spain, that if Victor Hugo has genius, if he really is a\r\npoet, it is because his childhood was spent in Madrid; there he drank\r\nin his first impressions, there his brain was molded, there his\r\nimagination was colored, his heart modeled, and the most beautiful\r\nconcepts of his mind born. And after all, who is Victor Hugo? Is he to\r\nbe compared at all with our modern—”\r\n\r\nThis peroration was cut short by the return of Makaraig with a\r\ndespondent air and a bitter smile on his lips, carrying in his hand a\r\nnote, which he offered silently to Sandoval, who read:\r\n\r\n\r\n   “MY DOVE: Your letter has reached me late, for I have already\r\n    handed in my decision, and it has been approved. However, as if I\r\n    had guessed your wish, I have decided the matter according to the\r\n    desires of your protégés. I’ll be at the theater and wait for you\r\n    after the performance.\r\n\r\n        “Your duckling,\r\n\r\n            “CUSTODINING.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“How tender the man is!” exclaimed Tadeo with emotion.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Sandoval. “I don’t see anything wrong about this—quite the\r\nreverse!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” rejoined Makaraig with his bitter smile, “decided favorably!\r\nI’ve just seen Padre Irene.”\r\n\r\n“What does Padre Irene say?” inquired Pecson.\r\n\r\n“The same as Don Custodio, and the rascal still had the audacity to\r\ncongratulate me. The Commission, which has taken as its own the\r\ndecision of the arbiter, approves the idea and felicitates the students\r\non their patriotism and their thirst for knowledge—”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Only that, considering our duties—in short, it says that in order that\r\nthe idea may not be lost, it concludes that the direction and execution\r\nof the plan should be placed in charge of one of the religious\r\ncorporations, in case the Dominicans do not wish to incorporate the\r\nacademy with the University.”\r\n\r\nExclamations of disappointment greeted the announcement. Isagani rose,\r\nbut said nothing.\r\n\r\n“And in order that we may participate in the management of the\r\nacademy,” Makaraig went on, “we are intrusted with the collection of\r\ncontributions and dues, with the obligation of turning them over to the\r\ntreasurer whom the corporation may designate, which treasurer will\r\nissue us receipts.”\r\n\r\n“Then we’re tax-collectors!” remarked Tadeo.\r\n\r\n“Sandoval,” said Pecson, “there’s the gauntlet—take it up!”\r\n\r\n“Huh! That’s not a gauntlet—from its odor it seems more like a sock.”\r\n\r\n“The funniest, part of it,” Makaraig added, “is that Padre Irene has\r\nadvised us to celebrate the event with a banquet or a torchlight\r\nprocession—a public demonstration of the students en masse to render\r\nthanks to all the persons who have intervened in the affair.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, after the blow, let’s sing and give thanks. Super flumina\r\nBabylonis sedimus!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a banquet like that of the convicts,” said Tadeo.\r\n\r\n“A banquet at which we all wear mourning and deliver funeral orations,”\r\nadded Sandoval.\r\n\r\n“A serenade with the Marseillaise and funeral marches,” proposed\r\nIsagani.\r\n\r\n“No, gentlemen,” observed Pecson with his clownish grin, “to celebrate\r\nthe event there’s nothing like a banquet in a pansitería, served by the\r\nChinamen without camisas. I insist, without camisas!”\r\n\r\nThe sarcasm and grotesqueness of this idea won it ready acceptance,\r\nSandoval being the first to applaud it, for he had long wished to see\r\nthe interior of one of those establishments which at night appeared to\r\nbe so merry and cheerful.\r\n\r\nJust as the orchestra struck up for the second act, the young men arose\r\nand left the theater, to the scandal of the whole house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nA CORPSE\r\n\r\n\r\nSimoun had not, in fact, gone to the theater. Already, at seven o’clock\r\nin the evening, he had left his house looking worried and gloomy. His\r\nservants saw him return twice, accompanied by different individuals,\r\nand at eight o’clock Makaraig encountered him pacing along Calle\r\nHospital near the nunnery of St. Clara, just when the bells of its\r\nchurch were ringing a funeral knell. At nine Camaroncocido saw him\r\nagain, in the neighborhood of the theater, speak with a person who\r\nseemed to be a student, pay the latter’s admission to the show, and\r\nagain disappear among the shadows of the trees.\r\n\r\n“What is it to me?” again muttered Camaroncocido. “What do I get out of\r\nwatching over the populace?”\r\n\r\nBasilio, as Makaraig said, had not gone to the show. The poor student,\r\nafter returning from San Diego, whither he had gone to ransom Juli, his\r\nfuture bride, from her servitude, had turned again to his studies,\r\nspending his time in the hospital, in studying, or in nursing Capitan\r\nTiago, whose affliction he was trying to cure.\r\n\r\nThe invalid had become an intolerable character. During his bad spells,\r\nwhen he felt depressed from lack of opium, the doses of which Basilio\r\nwas trying to reduce, he would scold, mistreat, and abuse the boy, who\r\nbore it resignedly, conscious that he was doing good to one to whom he\r\nowed so much, and yielded only in the last extremity. His vicious\r\nappetite satisfied, Capitan Tiago would fall into a good humor, become\r\ntender, and call him his son, tearfully recalling the youth’s services,\r\nhow well he administered the estates, and would even talk of making him\r\nhis heir. Basilio would smile bitterly and reflect that in this world\r\ncomplaisance with vice is rewarded better than fulfilment of duty. Not\r\na few times did he feel tempted to give free rein to the craving and\r\nconduct his benefactor to the grave by a path of flowers and smiling\r\nillusions rather than lengthen his life along a road of sacrifice.\r\n\r\n“What a fool I am!” he often said to himself. “People are stupid and\r\nthen pay for it.”\r\n\r\nBut he would shake his head as he thought of Juli, of the wide future\r\nbefore him. He counted upon living without a stain on his conscience,\r\nso he continued the treatment prescribed, and bore everything\r\npatiently.\r\n\r\nYet with all his care the sick man, except for short periods of\r\nimprovement, grew worse. Basilio had planned gradually to reduce the\r\namount of the dose, or at least not to let him injure himself by\r\nincreasing it, but on returning from the hospital or some visit he\r\nwould find his patient in the heavy slumber produced by the opium,\r\ndriveling, pale as a corpse. The young man could not explain whence the\r\ndrug came: the only two persons who visited the house were Simoun and\r\nPadre Irene, the former rarely, while the latter never ceased exhorting\r\nhim to be severe and inexorable with the treatment, to take no notice\r\nof the invalid’s ravings, for the main object was to save him.\r\n\r\n“Do your duty, young man,” was Padre Irene’s constant admonition. “Do\r\nyour duty.” Then he would deliver a sermon on this topic with such\r\ngreat conviction and enthusiasm that Basilio would begin to feel kindly\r\ntoward the preacher. Besides, Padre Irene promised to get him a fine\r\nassignment, a good province, and even hinted at the possibility of\r\nhaving him appointed a professor. Without being carried away by\r\nillusions, Basilio pretended to believe in them and went on obeying the\r\ndictates of his own conscience.\r\n\r\nThat night, while Les Cloches de Corneville was being presented,\r\nBasilio was studying at an old table by the light of an oil-lamp, whose\r\nthick glass globe partly illuminated his melancholy features. An old\r\nskull, some human bones, and a few books carefully arranged covered the\r\ntable, whereon there was also a pan of water with a sponge. The smell\r\nof opium that proceeded from the adjoining bedroom made the air heavy\r\nand inclined him to sleep, but he overcame the desire by bathing his\r\ntemples and eyes from time to time, determined not to go to sleep until\r\nhe had finished the book, which he had borrowed and must return as soon\r\nas possible. It was a volume of the Medicina Legal y Toxicología of Dr.\r\nFriata, the only book that the professor would use, and Basilio lacked\r\nmoney to buy a copy, since, under the pretext of its being forbidden by\r\nthe censor in Manila and the necessity for bribing many government\r\nemployees to get it in, the booksellers charged a high price for it.\r\n\r\nSo absorbed was the youth in his studies that he had not given any\r\nattention at all to some pamphlets that had been sent to him from some\r\nunknown source, pamphlets that treated of the Philippines, among which\r\nfigured those that were attracting the greatest notice at the time\r\nbecause of their harsh and insulting manner of referring to the natives\r\nof the country. Basilio had no time to open them, and he was perhaps\r\nrestrained also by the thought that there is nothing pleasant about\r\nreceiving an insult or a provocation without having any means of\r\nreplying or defending oneself. The censorship, in fact, permitted\r\ninsults to the Filipinos but prohibited replies on their part.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the silence that reigned in the house, broken only by a\r\nfeeble snore that issued now and then from the adjoining bedroom,\r\nBasilio heard light footfalls on the stairs, footfalls that soon\r\ncrossed the hallway and approached the room where he was. Raising his\r\nhead, he saw the door open and to his great surprise appeared the\r\nsinister figure of the jeweler Simoun, who since the scene in San Diego\r\nhad not come to visit either himself or Capitan Tiago.\r\n\r\n“How is the sick man?” he inquired, throwing a rapid glance about the\r\nroom and fixing his attention on the pamphlets, the leaves of which\r\nwere still uncut.\r\n\r\n“The beating of his heart is scarcely perceptible, his pulse is very\r\nweak, his appetite entirely gone,” replied Basilio in a low voice with\r\na sad smile. “He sweats profusely in the early morning.”\r\n\r\nNoticing that Simoun kept his face turned toward the pamphlets and\r\nfearing that he might reopen the subject of their conversation in the\r\nwood, he went on: “His system is saturated with poison. He may die any\r\nday, as though struck by lightning. The least irritation, any\r\nexcitement may kill him.”\r\n\r\n“Like the Philippines!” observed Simoun lugubriously.\r\n\r\nBasilio was unable to refrain from a gesture of impatience, but he was\r\ndetermined not to recur to the old subject, so he proceeded as if he\r\nhad heard nothing: “What weakens him the most is the nightmares, his\r\nterrors—”\r\n\r\n“Like the government!” again interrupted Simoun.\r\n\r\n“Several nights ago he awoke in the dark and thought that he had gone\r\nblind. He raised a disturbance, lamenting and scolding me, saying that\r\nI had put his eyes out. When I entered his room with a light he mistook\r\nme for Padre Irene and called me his saviour.”\r\n\r\n“Like the government, exactly!”\r\n\r\n“Last night,” continued Basilio, paying no attention, “he got up\r\nbegging for his favorite game-cock, the one that died three years ago,\r\nand I had to give him a chicken. Then he heaped blessings upon me and\r\npromised me many thousands—”\r\n\r\nAt that instant a clock struck half-past ten. Simoun shuddered and\r\nstopped the youth with a gesture.\r\n\r\n“Basilio,” he said in a low, tense voice, “listen to me carefully, for\r\nthe moments are precious. I see that you haven’t opened the pamphlets\r\nthat I sent you. You’re not interested in your country.”\r\n\r\nThe youth started to protest.\r\n\r\n“It’s useless,” went on Simoun dryly. “Within an hour the revolution is\r\ngoing to break out at a signal from me, and tomorrow there’ll be no\r\nstudies, there’ll be no University, there’ll be nothing but fighting\r\nand butchery. I have everything ready and my success is assured. When\r\nwe triumph, all those who could have helped us and did not do so will\r\nbe treated as enemies. Basilio, I’ve come to offer you death or a\r\nfuture!”\r\n\r\n“Death or a future!” the boy echoed, as though he did not understand.\r\n\r\n“With us or with the government,” rejoined Simoun. “With your country\r\nor with your oppressors. Decide, for time presses! I’ve come to save\r\nyou because of the memories that unite us!”\r\n\r\n“With my country or with the oppressors!” repeated Basilio in a low\r\ntone. The youth was stupefied. He gazed at the jeweler with eyes in\r\nwhich terror was reflected, he felt his limbs turn cold, while a\r\nthousand confused ideas whirled about in his mind. He saw the streets\r\nrunning blood, he heard the firing, he found himself among the dead and\r\nwounded, and by the peculiar force of his inclinations fancied himself\r\nin an operator’s blouse, cutting off legs and extracting bullets.\r\n\r\n“The will of the government is in my hands,” said Simoun. “I’ve\r\ndiverted and wasted its feeble strength and resources on foolish\r\nexpeditions, dazzling it with the plunder it might seize. Its heads are\r\nnow in the theater, calm and unsuspecting, thinking of a night of\r\npleasure, but not one shall again repose upon a pillow. I have men and\r\nregiments at my disposition: some I have led to believe that the\r\nuprising is ordered by the General; others that the friars are bringing\r\nit about; some I have bought with promises, with employments, with\r\nmoney; many, very many, are acting from revenge, because they are\r\noppressed and see it as a matter of killing or being killed. Cabesang\r\nTales is below, he has come with me here! Again I ask you—will you come\r\nwith us or do you prefer to expose yourself to the resentment of my\r\nfollowers? In critical moments, to declare oneself neutral is to be\r\nexposed to the wrath of both the contending parties.”\r\n\r\nBasilio rubbed his hand over his face several times, as if he were\r\ntrying to wake from a nightmare. He felt that his brow was cold.\r\n\r\n“Decide!” repeated Simoun.\r\n\r\n“And what—what would I have to do?” asked the youth in a weak and\r\nbroken voice.\r\n\r\n“A very simple thing,” replied Simoun, his face lighting up with a ray\r\nof hope. “As I have to direct the movement, I cannot get away from the\r\nscene of action. I want you, while the attention of the whole city is\r\ndirected elsewhere, at the head of a company to force the doors of the\r\nnunnery of St. Clara and take from there a person whom only you,\r\nbesides myself and Capitan Tiago, can recognize. You’ll run no risk at\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“Maria Clara!” exclaimed Basilio.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Maria Clara,” repeated Simoun, and for the first time his voice\r\nbecame human and compassionate. “I want to save her; to save her I have\r\nwished to live, I have returned. I am starting the revolution, because\r\nonly a revolution can open the doors of the nunneries.”\r\n\r\n“Ay!” sighed Basilio, clasping his hands. “You’ve come late, too late!”\r\n\r\n“Why?” inquired Simoun with a frown.\r\n\r\n“Maria Clara is dead!”\r\n\r\nSimoun arose with a bound and stood over the youth. “She’s dead?” he\r\ndemanded in a terrible voice.\r\n\r\n“This afternoon, at six. By now she must be—”\r\n\r\n“It’s a lie!” roared Simoun, pale and beside himself. “It’s false!\r\nMaria Clara lives, Maria Clara must live! It’s a cowardly excuse! She’s\r\nnot dead, and this night I’ll free her or tomorrow you die!”\r\n\r\nBasilio shrugged his shoulders. “Several days ago she was taken ill and\r\nI went to the nunnery for news of her. Look, here is Padre Salvi’s\r\nletter, brought by Padre Irene. Capitan Tiago wept all the evening,\r\nkissing his daughter’s picture and begging her forgiveness, until at\r\nlast he smoked an enormous quantity of opium. This evening her knell\r\nwas tolled.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Simoun, pressing his hands to his head and standing\r\nmotionless. He remembered to have actually heard the knell while he was\r\npacing about in the vicinity of the nunnery.\r\n\r\n“Dead!” he murmured in a voice so low that it seemed to be a ghost\r\nwhispering. “Dead! Dead without my having seen her, dead without\r\nknowing that I lived for her—dead!”\r\n\r\nFeeling a terrible storm, a tempest of whirlwind and thunder without a\r\ndrop of water, sobs without tears, cries without words, rage in his\r\nbreast and threaten to burst out like burning lava long repressed, he\r\nrushed precipitately from the room. Basilio heard him descend the\r\nstairs with unsteady tread, stepping heavily, he heard a stifled cry, a\r\ncry that seemed to presage death, so solemn, deep, and sad that he\r\narose from his chair pale and trembling, but he could hear the\r\nfootsteps die away and the noisy closing of the door to the street.\r\n\r\n“Poor fellow!” he murmured, while his eyes filled with tears. Heedless\r\nnow of his studies, he let his gaze wander into space as he pondered\r\nover the fate of those two beings: he—young, rich, educated, master of\r\nhis fortunes, with a brilliant future before him; she—fair as a dream,\r\npure, full of faith and innocence, nurtured amid love and laughter,\r\ndestined to a happy existence, to be adored in the family and respected\r\nin the world; and yet of those two beings, filled with love, with\r\nillusions and hopes, by a fatal destiny he wandered over the world,\r\ndragged ceaselessly through a whirl of blood and tears, sowing evil\r\ninstead of doing good, undoing virtue and encouraging vice, while she\r\nwas dying in the mysterious shadows of the cloister where she had\r\nsought peace and perhaps found suffering, where she entered pure and\r\nstainless and expired like a crushed flower!\r\n\r\nSleep in peace, ill-starred daughter of my hapless fatherland! Bury in\r\nthe grave the enchantments of youth, faded in their prime! When a\r\npeople cannot offer its daughters a tranquil home under the protection\r\nof sacred liberty, when a man can only leave to his widow blushes,\r\ntears to his mother, and slavery to his children, you do well to\r\ncondemn yourself to perpetual chastity, stifling within you the germ of\r\na future generation accursed! Well for you that you have not to shudder\r\nin your grave, hearing the cries of those who groan in darkness, of\r\nthose who feel that they have wings and yet are fettered, of those who\r\nare stifled from lack of liberty! Go, go with your poet’s dreams into\r\nthe regions of the infinite, spirit of woman dim-shadowed in the\r\nmoonlight’s beam, whispered in the bending arches of the bamboo-brakes!\r\nHappy she who dies lamented, she who leaves in the heart that loves her\r\na pure picture, a sacred remembrance, unspotted by the base passions\r\nengendered by the years! Go, we shall remember you! In the clear air of\r\nour native land, under its azure sky, above the billows of the lake set\r\namid sapphire hills and emerald shores, in the crystal streams shaded\r\nby the bamboos, bordered by flowers, enlivened by the beetles and\r\nbutterflies with their uncertain and wavering flight as though playing\r\nwith the air, in the silence of our forests, in the singing of our\r\nrivers, in the diamond showers of our waterfalls, in the resplendent\r\nlight of our moon, in the sighs of the night breeze, in all that may\r\ncall up the vision of the beloved, we must eternally see you as we\r\ndreamed of you, fair, beautiful, radiant with hope, pure as the light,\r\nyet still sad and melancholy in the contemplation of our woes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nDREAMS\r\n\r\n                                                  Amor, qué astro eres?\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Thursday, at the hour of sunset, Isagani was\r\nwalking along the beautiful promenade of Maria Cristina in the\r\ndirection of the Malecon to keep an appointment which Paulita had that\r\nmorning given him. The young man had no doubt that they were to talk\r\nabout what had happened on the previous night, and as he was determined\r\nto ask for an explanation, and knew how proud and haughty she was, he\r\nforesaw an estrangement. In view of this eventuality he had brought\r\nwith him the only two letters he had ever received from Paulita, two\r\nscraps of paper, whereon were merely a few hurriedly written lines with\r\nvarious blots, but in an even handwriting, things that did not prevent\r\nthe enamored youth from preserving them with more solicitude than if\r\nthey had been the autographs of Sappho and the Muse Polyhymnia.\r\n\r\nThis decision to sacrifice his love on the altar of dignity, the\r\nconsciousness of suffering in the discharge of duty, did not prevent a\r\nprofound melancholy from taking possession of Isagani and brought back\r\ninto his mind the beautiful days, and nights more beautiful still, when\r\nthey had whispered sweet nothings through the flowered gratings of the\r\nentresol, nothings that to the youth took on such a character of\r\nseriousness and importance that they seemed to him the only matters\r\nworthy of meriting the attention of the most exalted human\r\nunderstanding. He recalled the walks on moonlit nights, the fair, the\r\ndark December mornings after the mass of Nativity, the holy water that\r\nhe used to offer her, when she would thank him with a look charged with\r\na whole epic of love, both of them trembling as their fingers touched.\r\nHeavy sighs, like small rockets, issued from his breast and brought\r\nback to him all the verses, all the sayings of poets and writers about\r\nthe inconstancy of woman. Inwardly he cursed the creation of theaters,\r\nthe French operetta, and vowed to get revenge on Pelaez at the first\r\nopportunity. Everything about him appeared under the saddest and\r\nsomberest colors: the bay, deserted and solitary, seemed more solitary\r\nstill on account of the few steamers that were anchored in it; the sun\r\nwas dying behind Mariveles without poetry or enchantment, without the\r\ncapricious and richly tinted clouds of happier evenings; the Anda\r\nmonument, in bad taste, mean and squat, without style, without\r\ngrandeur, looked like a lump of ice-cream or at best a chunk of cake;\r\nthe people who were promenading along the Malecon, in spite of their\r\ncomplacent and contented air, appeared distant, haughty, and vain;\r\nmischievous and bad-mannered, the boys that played on the beach,\r\nskipping flat stones over the surface of the water or searching in the\r\nsand for mollusks and crustaceans which they caught for the mere fun of\r\ncatching and killed without benefit to themselves; in short, even the\r\neternal port works to which he had dedicated more than three odes,\r\nlooked to him absurd, ridiculous child’s play.\r\n\r\nThe port, ah, the port of Manila, a bastard that since its conception\r\nhad brought tears of humiliation and shame to all! If only after so\r\nmany tears there were not being brought forth a useless abortion!\r\n\r\nAbstractedly he saluted two Jesuits, former teachers of his, and\r\nscarcely noticed a tandem in which an American rode and excited the\r\nenvy of the gallants who were in calesas only. Near the Anda monument\r\nhe heard Ben-Zayb talking with another person about Simoun, learning\r\nthat the latter had on the previous night been taken suddenly ill, that\r\nhe refused to see any one, even the very aides of the General. “Yes!”\r\nexclaimed Isagani with a bitter smile, “for him attentions because he\r\nis rich. The soldiers return from their expeditions sick and wounded,\r\nbut no one visits them.”\r\n\r\nMusing over these expeditions, over the fate of the poor soldiers, over\r\nthe resistance offered by the islanders to the foreign yoke, he thought\r\nthat, death for death, if that of the soldiers was glorious because\r\nthey were obeying orders, that of the islanders was sublime because\r\nthey were defending their homes. [49]\r\n\r\n“A strange destiny, that of some peoples!” he mused. “Because a\r\ntraveler arrives at their shores, they lose their liberty and become\r\nsubjects and slaves, not only of the traveler, not only of his heirs,\r\nbut even of all his countrymen, and not for a generation, but for all\r\ntime! A strange conception of justice! Such a state of affairs gives\r\nample right to exterminate every foreigner as the most ferocious\r\nmonster that the sea can cast up!”\r\n\r\nHe reflected that those islanders, against whom his country was waging\r\nwar, after all were guilty of no crime other than that of weakness. The\r\ntravelers also arrived at the shores of other peoples, but finding them\r\nstrong made no display of their strange pretension. With all their\r\nweakness the spectacle they presented seemed beautiful to him, and the\r\nnames of the enemies, whom the newspapers did not fail to call cowards\r\nand traitors, appeared glorious to him, as they succumbed with glory\r\namid the ruins of their crude fortifications, with greater glory even\r\nthan the ancient Trojan heroes, for those islanders had carried away no\r\nPhilippine Helen! In his poetic enthusiasm he thought of the young men\r\nof those islands who could cover themselves with glory in the eyes of\r\ntheir women, and in his amorous desperation he envied them because they\r\ncould find a brilliant suicide.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I should like to die,” he exclaimed, “be reduced to nothingness,\r\nleave to my native land a glorious name, perish in its cause, defending\r\nit from foreign invasion, and then let the sun afterwards illumine my\r\ncorpse, like a motionless sentinel on the rocks of the sea!”\r\n\r\nThe conflict with the Germans [50] came into his mind and he almost\r\nfelt sorry that it had been adjusted: he would gladly have died for the\r\nSpanish-Filipino banner before submitting to the foreigner.\r\n\r\n“Because, after all,” he mused, “with Spain we are united by firm\r\nbonds—the past, history, religion, language—”\r\n\r\nLanguage, yes, language! A sarcastic smile curled his lips. That very\r\nnight they would hold a banquet in the pansitería to celebrate the\r\ndemise of the academy of Castilian.\r\n\r\n“Ay!” he sighed, “provided the liberals in Spain are like those we have\r\nhere, in a little while the mother country will be able to count the\r\nnumber of the faithful!”\r\n\r\nSlowly the night descended, and with it melancholy settled more heavily\r\nupon the heart of the young man, who had almost lost hope of seeing\r\nPaulita. The promenaders one by one left the Malecon for the Luneta,\r\nthe music from which was borne to him in snatches of melodies on the\r\nfresh evening breeze; the sailors on a warship anchored in the river\r\nperformed their evening drill, skipping about among the slender ropes\r\nlike spiders; the boats one by one lighted their lamps, thus giving\r\nsigns of life; while the beach,\r\n\r\n\r\n        Do el viento riza las calladas olas\r\n        Que con blando murmullo en la ribera\r\n        Se deslizan veloces por sí solas. [51]\r\n\r\n\r\nas Alaejos says, exhaled in the distance thin, vapors that the moon,\r\nnow at its full, gradually converted into mysterious transparent gauze.\r\n\r\nA distant sound became audible, a noise that rapidly approached.\r\nIsagani turned his head and his heart began to beat violently. A\r\ncarriage was coming, drawn by white horses, the white horses that he\r\nwould know among a hundred thousand. In the carriage rode Paulita and\r\nher friend of the night before, with Doña Victorina.\r\n\r\nBefore the young man could take a step, Paulita had leaped to the\r\nground with sylph-like agility and smiled at him with a smile full of\r\nconciliation. He smiled in return, and it seemed to him that all the\r\nclouds, all the black thoughts that before had beset him, vanished like\r\nsmoke, the sky lighted up, the breeze sang, flowers covered the grass\r\nby the roadside. But unfortunately Doña Victorina was there and she\r\npounced upon the young man to ask him for news of Don Tiburcio, since\r\nIsagani had undertaken to discover his hiding-place by inquiry among\r\nthe students he knew.\r\n\r\n“No one has been able to tell me up to now,” he answered, and he was\r\ntelling the truth, for Don Tiburcio was really hidden in the house of\r\nthe youth’s own uncle, Padre Florentino.\r\n\r\n“Let him know,” declared Doña Victorina furiously, “that I’ll call in\r\nthe Civil Guard. Alive or dead, I want to know where he is—because one\r\nhas to wait ten years before marrying again.”\r\n\r\nIsagani gazed at her in fright—Doña Victorina was thinking of\r\nremarrying! Who could the unfortunate be?\r\n\r\n“What do you think of Juanito Pelaez?” she asked him suddenly.\r\n\r\nJuanito! Isagani knew not what to reply. He was tempted to tell all the\r\nevil he knew of Pelaez, but a feeling of delicacy triumphed in his\r\nheart and he spoke well of his rival, for the very reason that he was\r\nsuch. Doña Victorina, entirely satisfied and becoming enthusiastic,\r\nthen broke out into exaggerations of Pelaez’s merits and was already\r\ngoing to make Isagani a confidant of her new passion when Paulita’s\r\nfriend came running to say that the former’s fan had fallen among the\r\nstones of the beach, near the Malecon. Stratagem or accident, the fact\r\nis that this mischance gave an excuse for the friend to remain with the\r\nold woman, while Isagani might talk with Paulita. Moreover, it was a\r\nmatter of rejoicing to Doña Victorina, since to get Juanito for herself\r\nshe was favoring Isagani’s love.\r\n\r\nPaulita had her plan ready. On thanking him she assumed the role of the\r\noffended party, showed resentment, and gave him to understand that she\r\nwas surprised to meet him there when everybody was on the Luneta, even\r\nthe French actresses.\r\n\r\n“You made the appointment for me, how could I be elsewhere?”\r\n\r\n“Yet last night you did not even notice that I was in the theater. I\r\nwas watching you all the time and you never took your eyes off those\r\ncochers.”\r\n\r\nSo they exchanged parts: Isagani, who had come to demand explanations,\r\nfound himself compelled to give them and considered himself very happy\r\nwhen Paulita said that she forgave him. In regard to her presence at\r\nthe theater, he even had to thank her for that: forced by her aunt, she\r\nhad decided to go in the hope of seeing him during the performance.\r\nLittle she cared for Juanito Pelaez!\r\n\r\n“My aunt’s the one who is in love with him,” she said with a merry\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\nThen they both laughed, for the marriage of Pelaez with Doña Victorina\r\nmade them really happy, and they saw it already an accomplished fact,\r\nuntil Isagani remembered that Don Tiburcio was still living and\r\nconfided the secret to his sweetheart, after exacting her promise that\r\nshe would tell no one. Paulita promised, with the mental reservation of\r\nrelating it to her friend.\r\n\r\nThis led the conversation to Isagani’s town, surrounded by forests,\r\nsituated on the shore of the sea which roared at the base of the high\r\ncliffs. Isagani’s gaze lighted up when he spoke of that obscure spot, a\r\nflush of pride overspread his cheeks, his voice trembled, his poetic\r\nimagination glowed, his words poured forth burning, charged with\r\nenthusiasm, as if he were talking of love to his love, and he could not\r\nbut exclaim:\r\n\r\n“Oh, in the solitude of my mountains I feel free, free as the air, as\r\nthe light that shoots unbridled through space! A thousand cities, a\r\nthousand palaces, would I give for that spot in the Philippines, where,\r\nfar from men, I could feel myself to have genuine liberty. There, face\r\nto face with nature, in the presence of the mysterious and the\r\ninfinite, the forest and the sea, I think, speak, and work like a man\r\nwho knows not tyrants.”\r\n\r\nIn the presence of such enthusiasm for his native place, an enthusiasm\r\nthat she did not comprehend, for she was accustomed to hear her country\r\nspoken ill of, and sometimes joined in the chorus herself, Paulita\r\nmanifested some jealousy, as usual making herself the offended party.\r\n\r\nBut Isagani very quickly pacified her. “Yes,” he said, “I loved it\r\nabove all things before I knew you! It was my delight to wander through\r\nthe thickets, to sleep in the shade of the trees, to seat myself upon a\r\ncliff to take in with my gaze the Pacific which rolled its blue waves\r\nbefore me, bringing to me echoes of songs learned on the shores of free\r\nAmerica. Before knowing you, that sea was for me my world, my delight,\r\nmy love, my dream! When it slept in calm with the sun shining overhead,\r\nit was my delight to gaze into the abyss hundreds of feet below me,\r\nseeking monsters in the forests of madrepores and coral that were\r\nrevealed through the limpid blue, enormous serpents that the country\r\nfolk say leave the forests to dwell in the sea, and there take on\r\nfrightful forms. Evening, they say, is the time when the sirens appear,\r\nand I saw them between the waves—so great was my eagerness that once I\r\nthought I could discern them amid the foam, busy in their divine\r\nsports, I distinctly heard their songs, songs of liberty, and I made\r\nout the sounds of their silvery harps. Formerly I spent hours and hours\r\nwatching the transformations in the clouds, or gazing at a solitary\r\ntree in the plain or a high rock, without knowing why, without being\r\nable to explain the vague feelings they awoke in me. My uncle used to\r\npreach long sermons to me, and fearing that I would become a\r\nhypochondriac, talked of placing me under a doctor’s care. But I met\r\nyou, I loved you, and during the last vacation it seemed that something\r\nwas lacking there, the forest was gloomy, sad the river that glides\r\nthrough the shadows, dreary the sea, deserted the sky. Ah, if you\r\nshould go there once, if your feet should press those paths, if you\r\nshould stir the waters of the rivulet with your fingers, if you should\r\ngaze upon the sea, sit upon the cliff, or make the air ring with your\r\nmelodious songs, my forest would be transformed into an Eden, the\r\nripples of the brook would sing, light would burst from the dark\r\nleaves, into diamonds would be converted the dewdrops and into pearls\r\nthe foam of the sea.”\r\n\r\nBut Paulita had heard that to reach Isagani’s home it was necessary to\r\ncross mountains where little leeches abounded, and at the mere thought\r\nof them the little coward shivered convulsively. Humored and petted,\r\nshe declared that she would travel only in a carriage or a railway\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\nHaving now forgotten all his pessimism and seeing only thornless roses\r\nabout him, Isagani answered, “Within a short time all the islands are\r\ngoing to be crossed with networks of iron rails.\r\n\r\n\r\n      “‘Por donde rápidas\r\n        Y voladoras\r\n        Locomotoras\r\n        Corriendo irán,’ [52]\r\n\r\n\r\nas some one said. Then the most beautiful spots of the islands will be\r\naccessible to all.”\r\n\r\n“Then, but when? When I’m an old woman?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you don’t know what we can do in a few years,” replied the youth.\r\n“You don’t realize the energy and enthusiasm that are awakening in the\r\ncountry after the sleep of centuries. Spain heeds us; our young men in\r\nMadrid are working day and night, dedicating to the fatherland all\r\ntheir intelligence, all their time, all their strength. Generous voices\r\nthere are mingled with ours, statesmen who realize that there is no\r\nbetter bond than community of thought and interest. Justice will be\r\nmeted out to us, and everything points to a brilliant future for all.\r\nIt’s true that we’ve just met with a slight rebuff, we students, but\r\nvictory is rolling along the whole line, it is in the consciousness of\r\nall! The traitorous repulse that we have suffered indicates the last\r\ngasp, the final convulsions of the dying. Tomorrow we shall be citizens\r\nof the Philippines, whose destiny will be a glorious one, because it\r\nwill be in loving hands. Ah, yes, the future is ours! I see it\r\nrose-tinted, I see the movement that stirs the life of these regions so\r\nlong dead, lethargic. I see towns arise along the railroads, and\r\nfactories everywhere, edifices like that of Mandaloyan! I hear the\r\nsteam hiss, the trains roar, the engines rattle! I see the smoke\r\nrise—their heavy breathing; I smell the oil—the sweat of monsters busy\r\nat incessant toil. This port, so slow and laborious of creation, this\r\nriver where commerce is in its death agony, we shall see covered with\r\nmasts, giving us an idea of the forests of Europe in winter. This pure\r\nair, and these stones, now so clean, will be crowded with coal, with\r\nboxes and barrels, the products of human industry, but let it not\r\nmatter, for we shall move about rapidly in comfortable coaches to seek\r\nin the interior other air, other scenes on other shores, cooler\r\ntemperatures on the slopes of the mountains. The warships of our navy\r\nwill guard our coasts, the Spaniard and the Filipino will rival each\r\nother in zeal to repel all foreign invasion, to defend our homes, and\r\nlet you bask in peace and smiles, loved and respected. Free from the\r\nsystem of exploitation, without hatred or distrust, the people will\r\nlabor because then labor will cease to be a despicable thing, it will\r\nno longer be servile, imposed upon a slave. Then the Spaniard will not\r\nembitter his character with ridiculous pretensions of despotism, but\r\nwith a frank look and a stout heart we shall extend our hands to one\r\nanother, and commerce, industry, agriculture, the sciences, will\r\ndevelop under the mantle of liberty, with wise and just laws, as in\r\nprosperous England.” [53]\r\n\r\nPaulita smiled dubiously and shook her head. “Dreams, dreams!” she\r\nsighed. “I’ve heard it said that you have many enemies. Aunt says that\r\nthis country must always be enslaved.”\r\n\r\n“Because your aunt is a fool, because she can’t live without slaves!\r\nWhen she hasn’t them she dreams of them in the future, and if they are\r\nnot obtainable she forces them into her imagination. True it is that we\r\nhave enemies, that there will be a struggle, but we shall conquer. The\r\nold system may convert the ruins of its castle into formless\r\nbarricades, but we will take them singing hymns of liberty, in the\r\nlight of the eyes of you women, to the applause of your lovely hands.\r\nBut do not be uneasy—the struggle will be a pacific one. Enough that\r\nyou spur us to zeal, that you awake in us noble and elevated thoughts\r\nand encourage us to constancy, to heroism, with your affection for our\r\nreward.”\r\n\r\nPaulita preserved her enigmatic smile and seemed thoughtful, as she\r\ngazed toward the river, patting her cheek lightly with her fan. “But if\r\nyou accomplish nothing?” she asked abstractedly.\r\n\r\nThe question hurt Isagani. He fixed his eyes on his sweetheart, caught\r\nher lightly by the hand, and began: “Listen, if we accomplish nothing—”\r\n\r\nHe paused in doubt, then resumed: “You know how I love you, how I adore\r\nyou, you know that I feel myself a different creature when your gaze\r\nenfolds me, when I surprise in it the flash of love, but yet if we\r\naccomplish nothing, I would dream of another look of yours and would\r\ndie happy, because the light of pride could burn in your eyes when you\r\npointed to my corpse and said to the world: ‘My love died fighting for\r\nthe rights of my fatherland!’ ”\r\n\r\n“Come home, child, you’re going to catch cold,” screeched Doña\r\nVictorina at that instant, and the voice brought them back to reality.\r\nIt was time to return, and they kindly invited him to enter the\r\ncarriage, an invitation which the young man did not give them cause to\r\nrepeat. As it was Paulita’s carriage, naturally Doña Victorina and the\r\nfriend occupied the back seat, while the two lovers sat on the smaller\r\none in front.\r\n\r\nTo ride in the same carriage, to have her at his side, to breathe her\r\nperfume, to rub against the silk of her dress, to see her pensive with\r\nfolded arms, lighted by the moon of the Philippines that lends to the\r\nmeanest things idealism and enchantment, were all dreams beyond\r\nIsagani’s hopes! What wretches they who were returning alone on foot\r\nand had to give way to the swift carriage! In the whole course of the\r\ndrive, along the beach and down the length of La Sabana, across the\r\nBridge of Spain, Isagani saw nothing but a sweet profile, gracefully\r\nset off by beautiful hair, ending in an arching neck that lost itself\r\namid the gauzy piña. A diamond winked at him from the lobe of the\r\nlittle ear, like a star among silvery clouds. He heard faint echoes\r\ninquiring for Don Tiburcio de Espadaña, the name of Juanito Pelaez, but\r\nthey sounded to him like distant bells, the confused noises heard in a\r\ndream. It was necessary to tell him that they had reached Plaza Santa\r\nCruz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nSMILES AND TEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sala of the Pansiteria Macanista de Buen Gusto [54] that night\r\npresented an extraordinary aspect. Fourteen young men of the principal\r\nislands of the archipelago, from the pure Indian (if there be pure\r\nones) to the Peninsular Spaniard, were met to hold the banquet advised\r\nby Padre Irene in view of the happy solution of the affair about\r\ninstruction in Castilian. They had engaged all the tables for\r\nthemselves, ordered the lights to be increased, and had posted on the\r\nwall beside the landscapes and Chinese kakemonos this strange versicle:\r\n\r\n“GLORY TO CUSTODIO FOR HIS CLEVERNESS AND PANSIT ON EABTH TO THE YOUTHS\r\nOF GOOD WILL.”\r\n\r\nIn a country where everything grotesque is covered with a mantle of\r\nseriousness, where many rise by the force of wind and hot air, in a\r\ncountry where the deeply serious and sincere may do damage on issuing\r\nfrom the heart and may cause trouble, probably this was the best way to\r\ncelebrate the ingenious inspiration of the illustrious Don Custodio.\r\nThe mocked replied to the mockery with a laugh, to the governmental\r\njoke with a plate of pansit, and yet—!\r\n\r\nThey laughed and jested, but it could be seen that the merriment was\r\nforced. The laughter had a certain nervous ring, eyes flashed, and in\r\nmore than one of these a tear glistened. Nevertheless, these young men\r\nwere cruel, they were unreasonable! It was not the first time that\r\ntheir most beautiful ideas had been so treated, that their hopes had\r\nbeen defrauded with big words and small actions: before this Don\r\nCustodio there had been many, very many others.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the room under the red lanterns were placed four round\r\ntables, systematically arranged to form a square. Little wooden stools,\r\nequally round, served as seats. In the middle of each table, according\r\nto the practise of the establishment, were arranged four small colored\r\nplates with four pies on each one and four cups of tea, with the\r\naccompanying dishes, all of red porcelain. Before each seat was a\r\nbottle and two glittering wine-glasses.\r\n\r\nSandoval was curious and gazed about scrutinizing everything, tasting\r\nthe food, examining the pictures, reading the bill of fare. The others\r\nconversed on the topics of the day: about the French actresses, about\r\nthe mysterious illness of Simoun, who, according to some, had been\r\nfound wounded in the street, while others averred that he had attempted\r\nto commit suicide. As was natural, all lost themselves in conjectures.\r\nTadeo gave his particular version, which according to him came from a\r\nreliable source: Simoun had been assaulted by some unknown person in\r\nthe old Plaza Vivac, [55] the motive being revenge, in proof of which\r\nwas the fact that Simoun himself refused to make the least explanation.\r\nFrom this they proceeded to talk of mysterious revenges, and naturally\r\nof monkish pranks, each one relating the exploits of the curate of his\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nA notice in large black letters crowned the frieze of the room with\r\nthis warning:\r\n\r\n\r\n        De esta fonda el cabecilla\r\n        Al publico advierte\r\n        Que nada dejen absolutamente\r\n        Sobre alguna mesa ó silla. [56]\r\n\r\n\r\n“What a notice!” exclaimed Sandoval. “As if he might have confidence in\r\nthe police, eh? And what verses! Don Tiburcio converted into a\r\nquatrain—two feet, one longer than the other, between two crutches! If\r\nIsagani sees them, he’ll present them to his future aunt.”\r\n\r\n“Here’s Isagani!” called a voice from the stairway. The happy youth\r\nappeared radiant with joy, followed by two Chinese, without camisas,\r\nwho carried on enormous waiters tureens that gave out an appetizing\r\nodor. Merry exclamations greeted them.\r\n\r\nJuanito Pelaez was missing, but the hour fixed had already passed, so\r\nthey sat down happily to the tables. Juanito was always unconventional.\r\n\r\n“If in his place we had invited Basilio,” said Tadeo, “we should have\r\nbeen better entertained. We might have got him drunk and drawn some\r\nsecrets from him.”\r\n\r\n“What, does the prudent Basilio possess secrets?”\r\n\r\n“I should say so!” replied Tadeo. “Of the most important kind. There\r\nare some enigmas to which he alone has the key: the boy who\r\ndisappeared, the nun—”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, the pansit lang-lang is the soup par excellence!” cried\r\nMakaraig. “As you will observe, Sandoval, it is composed of vermicelli,\r\ncrabs or shrimps, egg paste, scraps of chicken, and I don’t know what\r\nelse. As first-fruits, let us offer the bones to Don Custodio, to see\r\nif he will project something with them.”\r\n\r\nA burst of merry laughter greeted this sally.\r\n\r\n“If he should learn—”\r\n\r\n“He’d come a-running!” concluded Sandoval. “This is excellent soup—what\r\nis it called?”\r\n\r\n“Pansit lang-lang, that is, Chinese pansit, to distinguish it from that\r\nwhich is peculiar to this country.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! That’s a hard name to remember. In honor of Don Custodio, I\r\nchristen it the soup project!”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Makaraig, who had prepared the menu, “there are three\r\ncourses yet. Chinese stew made of pork—”\r\n\r\n“Which should be dedicated to Padre Irene.”\r\n\r\n“Get out! Padre Irene doesn’t eat pork, unless he turns his nose away,”\r\nwhispered a young man from Iloilo to his neighbor.\r\n\r\n“Let him turn his nose away!”\r\n\r\n“Down with Padre Irene’s nose,” cried several at once.\r\n\r\n“Respect, gentlemen, more respect!” demanded Pecson with comic gravity.\r\n\r\n“The third course is a lobster pie—”\r\n\r\n“Which should be dedicated to the friars,” suggested he of the Visayas.\r\n\r\n“For the lobsters’ sake,” added Sandoval.\r\n\r\n“Right, and call it friar pie!”\r\n\r\nThe whole crowd took this up, repeating in concert, “Friar pie!”\r\n\r\n“I protest in the name of one of them,” said Isagani.\r\n\r\n“And I, in the name of the lobsters,” added Tadeo.\r\n\r\n“Respect, gentlemen, more respect!” again demanded Pecson with a full\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n“The fourth is stewed pansit, which is dedicated—to the government and\r\nthe country!”\r\n\r\nAll turned toward Makaraig, who went on: “Until recently, gentlemen,\r\nthe pansit was believed to be Chinese or Japanese, but the fact is\r\nthat, being unknown in China or Japan, it would seem to be Filipino,\r\nyet those who prepare it and get the benefit from it are the\r\nChinese—the same, the very, very same that happens to the government\r\nand to the Philippines: they seem to be Chinese, but whether they are\r\nor not, the Holy Mother has her doctors—all eat and enjoy it, yet\r\ncharacterize it as disagreeable and loathsome, the same as with the\r\ncountry, the same as with the government. All live at its cost, all\r\nshare in its feast, and afterwards there is no worse country than the\r\nPhilippines, there is no government more imperfect. Let us then\r\ndedicate the pansit to the country and to the government.”\r\n\r\n“Agreed!” many exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“I protest!” cried Isagani.\r\n\r\n“Respect for the weaker, respect for the victims,” called Pecson in a\r\nhollow voice, waving a chicken-bone in the air.\r\n\r\n“Let’s dedicate the pansit to Quiroga the Chinaman, one of the four\r\npowers of the Filipino world,” proposed Isagani.\r\n\r\n“No, to his Black Eminence.”\r\n\r\n“Silence!” cautioned one mysteriously. “There are people in the plaza\r\nwatching us, and walls have ears.”\r\n\r\nTrue it was that curious groups were standing by the windows, while the\r\ntalk and laughter in the adjoining houses had ceased altogether, as if\r\nthe people there were giving their attention to what was occurring at\r\nthe banquet. There was something extraordinary about the silence.\r\n\r\n“Tadeo, deliver your speech,” Makaraig whispered to him.\r\n\r\nIt had been agreed that Sandoval, who possessed the most oratorical\r\nability, should deliver the last toast as a summing up.\r\n\r\nTadeo, lazy as ever, had prepared nothing, so he found himself in a\r\nquandary. While disposing of a long string of vermicelli, he meditated\r\nhow to get out of the difficulty, until he recalled a speech learned in\r\nschool and decided to plagiarize it, with adulterations.\r\n\r\n“Beloved brethren in project!” he began, gesticulating with two Chinese\r\nchop-sticks.\r\n\r\n“Brute! Keep that chop-stick out of my hair!” cried his neighbor.\r\n\r\n“Called by you to fill the void that has been left in—”\r\n\r\n“Plagiarism!” Sandoval interrupted him. “That speech was delivered by\r\nthe president of our lyceum.”\r\n\r\n“Called by your election,” continued the imperturbable Tadeo, “to fill\r\nthe void that has been left in my mind”—pointing to his stomach—“by a\r\nman famous for his Christian principles and for his inspirations and\r\nprojects, worthy of some little remembrance, what can one like myself\r\nsay of him, I who am very hungry, not having breakfasted?”\r\n\r\n“Have a neck, my friend!” called a neighbor, offering that portion of a\r\nchicken.\r\n\r\n“There is one course, gentlemen, the treasure of a people who are today\r\na tale and a mockery in the world, wherein have thrust their hands the\r\ngreatest gluttons of the western regions of the earth—” Here he pointed\r\nwith his chopsticks to Sandoval, who was struggling with a refractory\r\nchicken-wing.\r\n\r\n“And eastern!” retorted the latter, describing a circle in the air with\r\nhis spoon, in order to include all the banqueters.\r\n\r\n“No interruptions!”\r\n\r\n“I demand the floor!”\r\n\r\n“I demand pickles!” added Isagani.\r\n\r\n“Bring on the stew!”\r\n\r\nAll echoed this request, so Tadeo sat down, contented with having got\r\nout of his quandary.\r\n\r\nThe dish consecrated to Padre Irene did not appear to be extra good, as\r\nSandoval cruelly demonstrated thus: “Shining with grease outside and\r\nwith pork inside! Bring on the third course, the friar pie!”\r\n\r\nThe pie was not yet ready, although the sizzling of the grease in the\r\nfrying-pan could be heard. They took advantage of the delay to drink,\r\nbegging Pecson to talk.\r\n\r\nPecson crossed himself gravely and arose, restraining his clownish\r\nlaugh with an effort, at the same time mimicking a certain Augustinian\r\npreacher, then famous, and beginning in a murmur, as though he were\r\nreading a text.\r\n\r\n“Si tripa plena laudal Deum, tripa famelica laudabit fratres—if the\r\nfull stomach praises God, the hungry stomach will praise the friars.\r\nWords spoken by the Lord Custodio through the mouth of Ben-Zayb, in the\r\njournal El Grito de la Integridad, the second article, absurdity the\r\none hundred and fifty-seventh.\r\n\r\n“Beloved brethren in Christ: Evil blows its foul breath over the\r\nverdant shores of Frailandia, commonly called the Philippine\r\nArchipelago. No day passes but the attack is renewed, but there is\r\nheard some sarcasm against the reverend, venerable, infallible\r\ncorporations, defenseless and unsupported. Allow me, brethren, on this\r\noccasion to constitute myself a knight-errant to sally forth in defense\r\nof the unprotected, of the holy corporations that have reared us, thus\r\nagain confirming the saving idea of the adage—a full stomach praises\r\nGod, which is to say, a hungry stomach will praise the friars.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo, bravo!”\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said Isagani seriously, “I want you to understand that,\r\nspeaking of friars, I respect one.”\r\n\r\nSandoval was getting merry, so he began to sing a shady couplet about\r\nthe friars.\r\n\r\n“Hear me, brethren!” continued Pecson. “Turn your gaze toward the happy\r\ndays of your infancy, endeavor to analyze the present and ask\r\nyourselves about the future. What do you find? Friars, friars, and\r\nfriars! A friar baptized you, confirmed you, visited you in school with\r\nloving zeal; a friar heard your first secret; he was the first to bring\r\nyou into communion with God, to set your feet upon the pathway of life;\r\nfriars were your first and friars will be your last teachers; a friar\r\nit is who opens the hearts of your sweethearts, disposing them to heed\r\nyour sighs; a friar marries you, makes you travel over different\r\nislands to afford you changes of climate and diversion; he will attend\r\nyour death-bed, and even though you mount the scaffold, there will the\r\nfriar be to accompany you with his prayers and tears, and you may rest\r\nassured that he will not desert you until he sees you thoroughly dead.\r\nNor does his charity end there—dead, he will then endeavor to bury you\r\nwith all pomp, he will fight that your corpse pass through the church\r\nto receive his supplications, and he will only rest satisfied when he\r\ncan deliver you into the hands of the Creator, purified here on earth,\r\nthanks to temporal punishments, tortures, and humiliations. Learned in\r\nthe doctrines of Christ, who closes heaven against the rich, they, our\r\nredeemers and genuine ministers of the Saviour, seek every means to\r\nlift away our sins and bear them far, far off, there where the accursed\r\nChinese and Protestants dwell, to leave us this air, limpid, pure,\r\nhealthful, in such a way that even should we so wish afterwards, we\r\ncould not find a real to bring about our condemnation.\r\n\r\n“If, then, their existence is necessary to our happiness, if\r\nwheresoever we turn we must encounter their delicate hands, hungering\r\nfor kisses, that every day smooth the marks of abuse from our\r\ncountenances, why not adore them and fatten them—why demand their\r\nimpolitic expulsion? Consider for a moment the immense void that their\r\nabsence would leave in our social system. Tireless workers, they\r\nimprove and propagate the races! Divided as we are, thanks to our\r\njealousies and our susceptibilities, the friars unite us in a common\r\nlot, in a firm bond, so firm that many are unable to move their elbows.\r\nTake away the friar, gentlemen, and you will see how the Philippine\r\nedifice will totter; lacking robust shoulders and hairy limbs to\r\nsustain it, Philippine life will again become monotonous, without the\r\nmerry note of the playful and gracious friar, without the booklets and\r\nsermons that split our sides with laughter, without the amusing\r\ncontrast between grand pretensions and small brains, without the\r\nactual, daily representations of the tales of Boccaccio and La\r\nFontaine! Without the girdles and scapularies, what would you have our\r\nwomen do in the future—save that money and perhaps become miserly and\r\ncovetous? Without the masses, novenaries, and processions, where will\r\nyou find games of panguingui to entertain them in their hours of\r\nleisure? They would then have to devote themselves to their household\r\nduties and instead of reading diverting stories of miracles, we should\r\nthen have to get them works that are not extant.\r\n\r\n“Take away the friar and heroism will disappear, the political virtues\r\nwill fall under the control of the vulgar. Take him away and the Indian\r\nwill cease to exist, for the friar is the Father, the Indian is the\r\nWord! The former is the sculptor, the latter the statue, because all\r\nthat we are, think, or do, we owe to the friar—to his patience, his\r\ntoil, his perseverance of three centuries to modify the form Nature\r\ngave us. The Philippines without the friar and without the Indian—what\r\nthen would become of the unfortunate government in the hands of the\r\nChinamen?”\r\n\r\n“It will eat lobster pie,” suggested Isagani, whom Pecson’s speech\r\nbored.\r\n\r\n“And that’s what we ought to be doing. Enough of speeches!”\r\n\r\nAs the Chinese who should have served the courses did not put in his\r\nappearance, one of the students arose and went to the rear, toward the\r\nbalcony that overlooked the river. But he returned at once, making\r\nmysterious signs.\r\n\r\n“We’re watched! I’ve seen Padre Sibyla’s pet!”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” ejaculated Isagani, rising.\r\n\r\n“It’s no use now. When he saw me he disappeared.”\r\n\r\nApproaching the window he looked toward the plaza, then made signs to\r\nhis companions to come nearer. They saw a young man leave the door of\r\nthe pansitería, gaze all about him, then with some unknown person enter\r\na carriage that waited at the curb. It was Simoun’s carriage.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Makaraig. “The slave of the Vice-Rector attended by the\r\nMaster of the General!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nPASQUINADES\r\n\r\n\r\nVery early the next morning Basilio arose to go to the hospital. He had\r\nhis plans made: to visit his patients, to go afterwards to the\r\nUniversity to see about his licentiateship, and then have an interview\r\nwith Makaraig about the expense this would entail, for he had used up\r\nthe greater part of his savings in ransoming Juli and in securing a\r\nhouse where she and her grandfather might live, and he had not dared to\r\napply to Capitan Tiago, fearing that such a move would be construed as\r\nan advance on the legacy so often promised him.\r\n\r\nPreoccupied with these thoughts, he paid no attention to the groups of\r\nstudents who were at such an early hour returning from the Walled City,\r\nas though the classrooms had been closed, nor did he even note the\r\nabstracted air of some of them, their whispered conversations, or the\r\nmysterious signals exchanged among them. So it was that when he reached\r\nSan Juan de Dios and his friends asked him about the conspiracy, he\r\ngave a start, remembering what Simoun had planned, but which had\r\nmiscarried, owing to the unexplained accident to the jeweler.\r\nTerrified, he asked in a trembling voice, at the same time endeavoring\r\nto feign ignorance, “Ah, yes, what conspiracy?”\r\n\r\n“It’s been discovered,” replied one, “and it seems that many are\r\nimplicated in it.”\r\n\r\nWith an effort Basilio controlled himself. “Many implicated?” he\r\nechoed, trying to learn something from the looks of the others. “Who?”\r\n\r\n“Students, a lot of students.”\r\n\r\nBasilio did not think it prudent to ask more, fearing that he would\r\ngive himself away, so on the pretext of visiting his patients he left\r\nthe group. One of the clinical professors met him and placing his hand\r\nmysteriously on the youth’s shoulder—the professor was a friend of\r\nhis—asked him in a low voice, “Were you at that supper last night?”\r\n\r\nIn his excited frame of mind Basilio thought the professor had said\r\nnight before last, which was the time of his interview with Simoun. He\r\ntried to explain. “I assure you,” he stammered, “that as Capitan Tiago\r\nwas worse—and besides I had to finish that book—”\r\n\r\n“You did well not to attend it,” said the professor. “But you’re a\r\nmember of the students’ association?”\r\n\r\n“I pay my dues.”\r\n\r\n“Well then, a piece of advice: go home at once and destroy any papers\r\nyou have that may compromise you.”\r\n\r\nBasilio shrugged his shoulders—he had no papers, nothing more than his\r\nclinical notes.\r\n\r\n“Has Señor Simoun—”\r\n\r\n“Simoun has nothing to do with the affair, thank God!” interrupted the\r\nphysician. “He was opportunely wounded by some unknown hand and is now\r\nconfined to his bed. No, other hands are concerned in this, but hands\r\nno less terrible.”\r\n\r\nBasilio drew a breath of relief. Simoun was the only one who could\r\ncompromise him, although he thought of Cabesang Tales.\r\n\r\n“Are there tulisanes—”\r\n\r\n“No, man, nothing more than students.”\r\n\r\nBasilio recovered his serenity. “What has happened then?” he made bold\r\nto ask.\r\n\r\n“Seditious pasquinades have been found; didn’t you know about them?”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“In the University.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing more than that?”\r\n\r\n“Whew! What more do you want?” asked the professor, almost in a rage.\r\n“The pasquinades are attributed to the students of the association—but,\r\nkeep quiet!”\r\n\r\nThe professor of pathology came along, a man who had more the look of a\r\nsacristan than of a physician. Appointed by the powerful mandate of the\r\nVice-Rector, without other merit than unconditional servility to the\r\ncorporation, he passed for a spy and an informer in the eyes of the\r\nrest of the faculty.\r\n\r\nThe first professor returned his greeting coldly, and winked to\r\nBasilio, as he said to him, “Now I know that Capitan Tiago smells like\r\na corpse—the crows and vultures have been gathering around him.” So\r\nsaying, he went inside.\r\n\r\nSomewhat calmed, Basilio now ventured to inquire for more details, but\r\nall that he could learn was that pasquinades had been found on the\r\ndoors of the University, and that the Vice-Rector had ordered them to\r\nbe taken down and sent to the Civil Government. It was said that they\r\nwere filled with threats of assassination, invasion, and other\r\nbraggadocio.\r\n\r\nThe students made their comments on the affair. Their information came\r\nfrom the janitor, who had it from a servant in Santo Tomas, who had it\r\nfrom an usher. They prognosticated future suspensions and\r\nimprisonments, even indicating who were to be the victims—naturally the\r\nmembers of the association.\r\n\r\nBasilio then recalled Simoun’s words: “The day in which they can get\r\nrid of you, you will not complete your course.”\r\n\r\n“Could he have known anything?” he asked himself. “We’ll see who is the\r\nmost powerful.”\r\n\r\nRecovering his serenity, he went on toward the University, to learn\r\nwhat attitude it behooved him to take and at the same time to see about\r\nhis licentiateship. He passed along Calle Legazpi, then down through\r\nBeaterio, and upon arriving at the corner of this street and Calle\r\nSolana saw that something important must indeed have happened. Instead\r\nof the former lively, chattering groups on the sidewalks were to be\r\nseen civil-guards making the students move on, and these latter issuing\r\nfrom the University silent, some gloomy, some agitated, to stand off at\r\na distance or make their way home.\r\n\r\nThe first acquaintance he met was Sandoval, but Basilio called to him\r\nin vain. He seemed to have been smitten deaf. “Effect of fear on the\r\ngastro-intestinal juices,” thought Basilio.\r\n\r\nLater he met Tadeo, who wore a Christmas face—at last that eternal\r\nholiday seemed to be realized.\r\n\r\n“What has happened, Tadeo?”\r\n\r\n“We’ll have no school, at least for a week, old man! Sublime!\r\nMagnificent!” He rubbed his hands in glee.\r\n\r\n“But what has happened?”\r\n\r\n“They’re going to arrest all of us in the association.”\r\n\r\n“And are you glad of that?”\r\n\r\n“There’ll be no school, there’ll be no school!” He moved away almost\r\nbursting with joy.\r\n\r\nBasilio saw Juanito Pelaez approaching, pale and suspicious. This time\r\nhis hump had reached its maximum, so great was his haste to get away.\r\nHe had been one of the most active promoters of the association while\r\nthings were running smoothly.\r\n\r\n“Eh, Pelaez, what’s happened?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, I know nothing. I didn’t have anything to do with it,” he\r\nresponded nervously. “I was always telling you that these things were\r\nquixotisms. It’s the truth, you know I’ve said so to you?”\r\n\r\nBasilio did not remember whether he had said so or not, but to humor\r\nhim replied, “Yes, man, but what’s happened?”\r\n\r\n“It’s the truth, isn’t it? Look, you’re a witness: I’ve always been\r\nopposed—you’re a witness, don’t forget it!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, man, but what’s going on?”\r\n\r\n“Listen, you’re a witness! I’ve never had anything to do with the\r\nmembers of the association, except to give them advice. You’re not\r\ngoing to deny it now. Be careful, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“No, no, I won’t deny it, but for goodness’ sake, what has happened?”\r\n\r\nBut Juanito was already far away. He had caught a glimpse of a guard\r\napproaching and feared arrest.\r\n\r\nBasilio then went on toward the University to see if perhaps the\r\nsecretary’s office might be open and if he could glean any further\r\nnews. The office was closed, but there was an extraordinary commotion\r\nin the building. Hurrying up and down the stairways were friars, army\r\nofficers, private persons, old lawyers and doctors, there doubtless to\r\noffer their services to the endangered cause.\r\n\r\nAt a distance he saw his friend Isagani, pale and agitated, but radiant\r\nwith youthful ardor, haranguing some fellow students with his voice\r\nraised as though he cared little that he be heard by everybody.\r\n\r\n“It seems preposterous, gentlemen, it seems unreal, that an incident so\r\ninsignificant should scatter us and send us into flight like sparrows\r\nat whom a scarecrow has been shaken! But is this the first time that\r\nstudents have gone to prison for the sake of liberty? Where are those\r\nwho have died, those who have been shot? Would you apostatize now?”\r\n\r\n“But who can the fool be that wrote such pasquinades?” demanded an\r\nindignant listener.\r\n\r\n“What does that matter to us?” rejoined Isagani. “We don’t have to find\r\nout, let them find out! Before we know how they are drawn up, we have\r\nno need to make any show of agreement at a time like this. There where\r\nthe danger is, there must we hasten, because honor is there! If what\r\nthe pasquinades say is compatible with our dignity and our feelings, be\r\nhe who he may that wrote them, he has done well, and we ought to be\r\ngrateful to him and hasten to add our signatures to his! If they are\r\nunworthy of us, our conduct and our consciences will in themselves\r\nprotest and defend us from every accusation!”\r\n\r\nUpon hearing such talk, Basilio, although he liked Isagani very much,\r\nturned and left. He had to go to Makaraig’s house to see about the\r\nloan.\r\n\r\nNear the house of the wealthy student he observed whisperings and\r\nmysterious signals among the neighbors, but not comprehending what they\r\nmeant, continued serenely on his way and entered the doorway. Two\r\nguards advanced and asked him what he wanted. Basilio realized that he\r\nhad made a bad move, but he could not now retreat.\r\n\r\n“I’ve come to see my friend Makaraig,” he replied calmly.\r\n\r\nThe guards looked at each other. “Wait here,” one of them said to him.\r\n“Wait till the corporal comes down.”\r\n\r\nBasilio bit his lips and Simoun’s words again recurred to him. Had they\r\ncome to arrest Makaraig?—was his thought, but he dared not give it\r\nutterance. He did not have to wait long, for in a few moments Makaraig\r\ncame down, talking pleasantly with the corporal. The two were preceded\r\nby a warrant officer.\r\n\r\n“What, you too, Basilio?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I came to see you—”\r\n\r\n“Noble conduct!” exclaimed Makaraig laughing. “In time of calm, you\r\navoid us.”\r\n\r\nThe corporal asked Basilio his name, then scanned a list. “Medical\r\nstudent, Calle Anloague?” he asked.\r\n\r\nBasilio bit his lip.\r\n\r\n“You’ve saved us a trip,” added the corporal, placing his hand on the\r\nyouth’s shoulder. “You’re under arrest!”\r\n\r\n“What, I also?”\r\n\r\nMakaraig burst out into laughter.\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry, friend. Let’s get into the carriage, while I tell you\r\nabout the supper last night.”\r\n\r\nWith a graceful gesture, as though he were in his own house, he invited\r\nthe warrant officer and the corporal to enter the carriage that waited\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\n“To the Civil Government!” he ordered the cochero.\r\n\r\nNow that Basilio had again regained his composure, he told Makaraig the\r\nobject of his visit. The rich student did not wait for him to finish,\r\nbut seized his hand. “Count on me, count on me, and to the festivities\r\ncelebrating our graduation we’ll invite these gentlemen,” he said,\r\nindicating the corporal and the warrant officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE FRIAR AND THE FILIPINO\r\n\r\n                                                    Vox populi, vox Dei\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left Isagani haranguing his friends. In the midst of his enthusiasm\r\nan usher approached him to say that Padre Fernandez, one of the higher\r\nprofessors, wished to talk with him.\r\n\r\nIsagani’s face fell. Padre Fernandez was a person greatly respected by\r\nhim, being the one always excepted by him whenever the friars were\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\n“What does Padre Fernandez want?” he inquired.\r\n\r\nThe usher shrugged his shoulders and Isagani reluctantly followed him.\r\n\r\nPadre Fernandez, the friar whom we met in Los Baños, was waiting in his\r\ncell, grave and sad, with his brows knitted as if he were in deep\r\nthought. He arose as Isagani entered, shook hands with him, and closed\r\nthe door. Then he began to pace from one end of the room to the other.\r\nIsagani stood waiting for him to speak.\r\n\r\n“Señor Isagani,” he began at length with some emotion, “from the window\r\nI’ve heard you speaking, for though I am a consumptive I have good\r\nears, and I want to talk with you. I have always liked the young men\r\nwho express themselves clearly and have their own way of thinking and\r\nacting, no matter that their ideas may differ from mine. You young men,\r\nfrom what I have heard, had a supper last night. Don’t excuse\r\nyourself—”\r\n\r\n“I don’t intend to excuse myself!” interrupted Isagani.\r\n\r\n“So much the better—it shows that you accept the consequences of your\r\nactions. Besides, you would do ill in retracting, and I don’t blame\r\nyou, I take no notice of what may have been said there last night, I\r\ndon’t accuse you, because after all you’re free to say of the\r\nDominicans what seems best to you, you are not a pupil of ours—only\r\nthis year have we had the pleasure of having you, and we shall probably\r\nnot have you longer. Don’t think that I’m going to invoke\r\nconsiderations of gratitude; no, I’m not going to waste my time in\r\nstupid vulgarisms. I’ve had you summoned here because I believe that\r\nyou are one of the few students who act from conviction, and, as I like\r\nmen of conviction, I’m going to explain myself to Señor Isagani.”\r\n\r\nPadre Fernandez paused, then continued his walk with bowed head, his\r\ngaze riveted on the floor.\r\n\r\n“You may sit down, if you wish,” he remarked. “It’s a habit of mine to\r\nwalk about while talking, because my ideas come better then.”\r\n\r\nIsagani remained standing, with his head erect, waiting for the\r\nprofessor to get to the point of the matter.\r\n\r\n“For more than eight years I have been a professor here,” resumed Padre\r\nFernandez, still continuing to pace back and forth, “and in that time\r\nI’ve known and dealt with more than twenty-five hundred students. I’ve\r\ntaught them, I’ve tried to educate them, I’ve tried to inculcate in\r\nthem principles of justice and of dignity, and yet in these days when\r\nthere is so much murmuring against us I’ve not seen one who has the\r\ntemerity to maintain his accusations when he finds himself in the\r\npresence of a friar, not even aloud in the presence of any numbers.\r\nYoung men there are who behind our backs calumniate us and before us\r\nkiss our hands, with a base smile begging kind looks from us! Bah! What\r\ndo you wish that we should do with such creatures?”\r\n\r\n“The fault is not all theirs, Padre,” replied Isagani. “The fault lies\r\npartly with those who have taught them to be hypocrites, with those who\r\nhave tyrannized over freedom of thought and freedom of speech. Here\r\nevery independent thought, every word that is not an echo of the will\r\nof those in power, is characterized as filibusterism, and you know well\r\nenough what that means. A fool would he be who to please himself would\r\nsay aloud what he thinks, who would lay himself liable to suffer\r\npersecution!”\r\n\r\n“What persecution have you had to suffer?” asked Padre Fernandez,\r\nraising his head. “Haven’t I let you express yourself freely in my\r\nclass? Nevertheless, you are an exception that, if what you say is\r\ntrue, I must correct, so as to make the rule as general as possible and\r\nthus avoid setting a bad example.”\r\n\r\nIsagani smiled. “I thank you, but I will not discuss with you whether I\r\nam an exception. I will accept your qualification so that you may\r\naccept mine: you also are an exception, and as here we are not going to\r\ntalk about exceptions, nor plead for ourselves, at least, I mean, I’m\r\nnot, I beg of my professor to change the course of the conversation.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of his liberal principles, Padre Fernandez raised his head and\r\nstared in surprise at Isagani. That young man was more independent than\r\nhe had thought—although he called him professor, in reality he was\r\ndealing with him as an equal, since he allowed himself to offer\r\nsuggestions. Like a wise diplomat, Padre Fernandez not only recognized\r\nthe fact but even took his stand upon it.\r\n\r\n“Good enough!” he said. “But don’t look upon me as your professor. I’m\r\na friar and you are a Filipino student, nothing more nor less! Now I\r\nask you—what do the Filipino students want of us?”\r\n\r\nThe question came as a surprise; Isagani was not prepared for it. It\r\nwas a thrust made suddenly while they were preparing their defense, as\r\nthey say in fencing. Thus startled, Isagani responded with a violent\r\nstand, like a beginner defending himself.\r\n\r\n“That you do your duty!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nFray Fernandez straightened up—that reply sounded to him like a\r\ncannon-shot. “That we do our duty!” he repeated, holding himself erect.\r\n“Don’t we, then, do our duty? What duties do you ascribe to us?”\r\n\r\n“Those which you voluntarily placed upon yourselves on joining the\r\norder, and those which afterwards, once in it, you have been willing to\r\nassume. But, as a Filipino student, I don’t think myself called upon to\r\nexamine your conduct with reference to your statutes, to Catholicism,\r\nto the government, to the Filipino people, and to humanity in\r\ngeneral—those are questions that you have to settle with your founders,\r\nwith the Pope, with the government, with the whole people, and with\r\nGod. As a Filipino student, I will confine myself to your duties toward\r\nus. The friars in general, being the local supervisors of education in\r\nthe provinces, and the Dominicans in particular, by monopolizing in\r\ntheir hands all the studies of the Filipino youth, have assumed the\r\nobligation to its eight millions of inhabitants, to Spain, and to\r\nhumanity, of which we form a part, of steadily bettering the young\r\nplant, morally and physically, of training it toward its happiness, of\r\ncreating a people honest, prosperous, intelligent, virtuous, noble, and\r\nloyal. Now I ask you in my turn—have the friars fulfilled that\r\nobligation of theirs?”\r\n\r\n“We’re fulfilling—”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Padre Fernandez,” interrupted Isagani, “you with your hand on your\r\nheart can say that you are fulfilling it, but with your hand on the\r\nheart of your order, on the heart of all the orders, you cannot say\r\nthat without deceiving yourself. Ah, Padre Fernandez, when I find\r\nmyself in the presence of a person whom I esteem and respect, I prefer\r\nto be the accused rather than the accuser, I prefer to defend myself\r\nrather than take the offensive. But now that we have entered upon the\r\ndiscussion, let us carry it to the end! How do they fulfill their\r\nobligation, those who look after education in the towns? By hindering\r\nit! And those who here monopolize education, those who try to mold the\r\nmind of youth, to the exclusion of all others whomsoever, how do they\r\ncarry out their mission? By curtailing knowledge as much as possible,\r\nby extinguishing all ardor and enthusiasm, by trampling on all dignity,\r\nthe soul’s only refuge, by inculcating in us worn-out ideas, rancid\r\nbeliefs, false principles incompatible with a life of progress! Ah,\r\nyes, when it is a question of feeding convicts, of providing for the\r\nmaintenance of criminals, the government calls for bids in order to\r\nfind the purveyor who offers the best means of subsistence, he who at\r\nleast will not let them perish from hunger, but when it is a question\r\nof morally feeding a whole people, of nourishing the intellect of\r\nyouth, the healthiest part, that which is later to be the country and\r\nthe all, the government not only does not ask for any bid, but\r\nrestricts the power to that very body which makes a boast of not\r\ndesiring education, of wishing no advancement. What should we say if\r\nthe purveyor for the prisons, after securing the contract by intrigue,\r\nshould then leave the prisoners to languish in want, giving them only\r\nwhat is stale and rancid, excusing himself afterwards by saying that it\r\nis not convenient for the prisoners to enjoy good health, because good\r\nhealth brings merry thoughts, because merriment improves the man, and\r\nthe man ought not to be improved, because it is to the purveyor’s\r\ninterest that there be many criminals? What should we say if afterwards\r\nthe government and the purveyor should agree between themselves that of\r\nthe ten or twelve cuartos which one received for each criminal, the\r\nother should receive five?”\r\n\r\nPadre Fernandek bit his lip. “Those are grave charges,” he said, “and\r\nyou are overstepping the limits of our agreement.”\r\n\r\n“No, Padre, not if I continue to deal with the student question. The\r\nfriars—and I do not say, you friars, since I do not confuse you with\r\nthe common herd—the friars of all the orders have constituted\r\nthemselves our mental purveyors, yet they say and shamelessly proclaim\r\nthat it is not expedient for us to become enlightened, because some day\r\nwe shall declare ourselves free! That is just the same as not wishing\r\nthe prisoner to be well-fed so that he may improve and get out of\r\nprison. Liberty is to man what education is to the intelligence, and\r\nthe friars’ unwillingness that we have it is the origin of our\r\ndiscontent.”\r\n\r\n“Instruction is given only to those who deserve it,” rejoined Padre\r\nFernandez dryly. “To give it to men without character and without\r\nmorality is to prostitute it.”\r\n\r\n“Why are there men without character and without morality?”\r\n\r\nThe Dominican shrugged his shoulders. “Defects that they imbibe with\r\ntheir mothers’ milk, that they breathe in the bosom of the family—how\r\ndo I know?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, no, Padre Fernandez!” exclaimed the young man impetuously. “You\r\nhave not dared to go into the subject deeply, you have not wished to\r\ngaze into the depths from fear of finding yourself there in the\r\ndarkness of your brethren. What we are, you have made us. A people\r\ntyrannized over is forced to be hypocritical; a people denied the truth\r\nmust resort to lies; and he who makes himself a tyrant breeds slaves.\r\nThere is no morality, you say, so let it be—even though statistics can\r\nrefute you in that here are not committed crimes like those among other\r\npeoples, blinded by the fumes of their moralizers. But, without\r\nattempting now to analyze what it is that forms the character and how\r\nfar the education received determines morality, I will agree with you\r\nthat we are defective. Who is to blame for that? You who for three\r\ncenturies and a half have had in your hands our education, or we who\r\nsubmit to everything? If after three centuries and a half the artist\r\nhas been able to produce only a caricature, stupid indeed he must be!”\r\n\r\n“Or bad enough the material he works upon.”\r\n\r\n“Stupider still then, when, knowing it to be bad, he does not give it\r\nup, but goes on wasting time. Not only is he stupid, but he is a cheat\r\nand a robber, because he knows that his work is useless, yet continues\r\nto draw his salary. Not only is he stupid and a thief, he is a villain\r\nin that he prevents any other workman from trying his skill to see if\r\nhe might not produce something worth while! The deadly jealousy of the\r\nincompetent!”\r\n\r\nThe reply was sharp and Padre Fernandez felt himself caught. To his\r\ngaze Isagani appeared gigantic, invincible, convincing, and for the\r\nfirst time in his life he felt beaten by a Filipino student. He\r\nrepented of having provoked the argument, but it was too late to turn\r\nback. In this quandary, finding himself confronted with such a\r\nformidable adversary, he sought a strong shield and laid hold of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n“You impute all the faults to us, because you see only us, who are\r\nnear,” he said in a less haughty tone. “It’s natural and doesn’t\r\nsurprise me. A person hates the soldier or policeman who arrests him\r\nand not the judge who sends him to prison. You and we are both dancing\r\nto the same measure of music—if at the same note you lift your foot in\r\nunison with us, don’t blame us for it, it’s the music that is directing\r\nour movements. Do you think that we friars have no consciences and that\r\nwe do not desire what is right? Do you believe that we do not think\r\nabout you, that we do not heed our duty, that we only eat to live, and\r\nlive to rule? Would that it were so! But we, like you, follow the\r\ncadence, finding ourselves between Scylla and Charybdis: either you\r\nreject us or the government rejects us. The government commands, and he\r\nwho commands, commands,—and must be obeyed!”\r\n\r\n“From which it may be inferred,” remarked Isagani with a bitter smile,\r\n“that the government wishes our demoralization.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, I didn’t mean that! What I meant to say is that there are\r\nbeliefs, there are theories, there are laws, which, dictated with the\r\nbest intention, produce the most deplorable consequences. I’ll explain\r\nmyself better by citing an example. To stamp out a small evil, there\r\nare dictated many laws that cause greater evils still: ‘corruptissima\r\nin republica plurimae leges,’ said Tacitus. To prevent one case of\r\nfraud, there are provided a million and a half preventive or\r\nhumiliating regulations, which produce the immediate effect of\r\nawakening in the public the desire to elude and mock such regulations.\r\nTo make a people criminal, there’s nothing more needed than to doubt\r\nits virtue. Enact a law, not only here, but even in Spain, and you will\r\nsee how the means of evading it will be sought, and this is for the\r\nvery reason that the legislators have overlooked the fact that the more\r\nan object is hidden, the more a sight of it is desired. Why are\r\nrascality and astuteness regarded as great qualities in the Spanish\r\npeople, when there is no other so noble, so proud, so chivalrous as it?\r\nBecause our legislators, with the best intentions, have doubted its\r\nnobility, wounded its pride, challenged its chivalry! Do you wish to\r\nopen in Spain a road among the rocks? Then place there an imperative\r\nnotice forbidding the passage, and the people, in order to protest\r\nagainst the order, will leave the highway to clamber over the rocks.\r\nThe day on which some legislator in Spain forbids virtue and commands\r\nvice, then all will become virtuous!”\r\n\r\nThe Dominican paused for a brief space, then resumed: “But you may say\r\nthat we are getting away from the subject, so I’ll return to it. What I\r\ncan say to you, to convince you, is that the vices from which you\r\nsuffer ought to be ascribed by you neither to us nor to the government.\r\nThey are due to the imperfect organization of our social system: qui\r\nmultum probat, nihil probat, one loses himself through excessive\r\ncaution, lacking what is necessary and having too much of what is\r\nsuperfluous.”\r\n\r\n“If you admit those defects in your social system,” replied Isagani,\r\n“why then do you undertake to regulate alien societies, instead of\r\nfirst devoting your attention to yourselves?”\r\n\r\n“We’re getting away from the subject, young man. The theory in\r\naccomplished facts must be accepted.”\r\n\r\n“So let it be! I accept it because it is an accomplished fact, but I\r\nwill further ask: why, if your social organization is defective, do you\r\nnot change it or at least give heed to the cry of those who are injured\r\nby it?”\r\n\r\n“We’re still far away. Let’s talk about what the students want from the\r\nfriars.”\r\n\r\n“From the moment when the friars hide themselves behind the government,\r\nthe students have to turn to it.”\r\n\r\nThis statement was true and there appeared no means of ignoring it.\r\n\r\n“I’m not the government and I can’t answer for its acts. What do the\r\nstudents wish us to do for them within the limits by which we are\r\nconfined?”\r\n\r\n“Not to oppose the emancipation of education but to favor it.”\r\n\r\nThe Dominican shook his head. “Without stating my own opinion, that is\r\nasking us to commit suicide,” he said.\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, it is asking you for room to pass in order not to\r\ntrample upon and crush you.”\r\n\r\n“Ahem!” coughed Padre Fernandez, stopping and remaining thoughtful.\r\n“Begin by asking something that does not cost so much, something that\r\nany one of us can grant without abatement of dignity or privilege, for\r\nif we can reach an understanding and dwell in peace, why this hatred,\r\nwhy this distrust?”\r\n\r\n“Then let’s get down to details.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, because if we disturb the foundation, we’ll bring down the whole\r\nedifice.”\r\n\r\n“Then let’s get down to details, let’s leave the region of abstract\r\nprinciples,” rejoined Isagani with a smile, “and also without stating\r\nmy own opinion,”—the youth accented these words—“the students would\r\ndesist from their attitude and soften certain asperities if the\r\nprofessors would try to treat them better than they have up to the\r\npresent. That is in their hands.”\r\n\r\n“What?” demanded the Dominican. “Have the students any complaint to\r\nmake about my conduct?”\r\n\r\n“Padre, we agreed from the start not to talk of yourself or of myself,\r\nwe’re speaking generally. The students, besides getting no great\r\nbenefit out of the years spent in the classes, often leave there\r\nremnants of their dignity, if not the whole of it.”\r\n\r\nPadre Fernandez again bit his lip. “No one forces them to study—the\r\nfields are uncultivated,” he observed dryly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, there is something that impels them to study,” replied Isagani in\r\nthe same tone, looking the Dominican full in the face. “Besides the\r\nduty of every one to seek his own perfection, there is the desire\r\ninnate in man to cultivate his intellect, a desire the more powerful\r\nhere in that it is repressed. He who gives his gold and his life to the\r\nState has the right to require of it opporttmity better to get that\r\ngold and better to care for his life. Yes, Padre, there is something\r\nthat impels them, and that something is the government itself. It is\r\nyou yourselves who pitilessly ridicule the uncultured Indian and deny\r\nhim his rights, on the ground that he is ignorant. You strip him and\r\nthen scoff at his nakedness.”\r\n\r\nPadre Fernandez did not reply, but continued to pace about feverishly,\r\nas though very much agitated.\r\n\r\n“You say that the fields are not cultivated,” resumed Isagani in a\r\nchanged tone, after a brief pause. “Let’s not enter upon an analysis of\r\nthe reason for this, because we should get far away. But you, Padre\r\nFernandez, you, a teacher, you, a learned man, do you wish a people of\r\npeons and laborers? In your opinion, is the laborer the perfect state\r\nat which man may arrive in his development? Or is it that you wish\r\nknowledge for yourself and labor for the rest?”\r\n\r\n“No, I want knowledge for him who deserves it, for him who knows how to\r\nuse it,” was the reply. “When the students demonstrate that they love\r\nit, when young men of conviction appear, young men who know how to\r\nmaintain their dignity and make it respected, then there will be\r\nknowledge, then there will be considerate professors! If there are now\r\nprofessors who resort to abuse, it is because there are pupils who\r\nsubmit to it.”\r\n\r\n“When there are professors, there will be students!”\r\n\r\n“Begin by reforming yourselves, you who have need of change, and we\r\nwill follow.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Isagani with a bitter laugh, “let us begin it, because the\r\ndifficulty is on our side. Well you know what is expected of a pupil\r\nwho stands before a professor—you yourself, with all your love of\r\njustice, with all your kind sentiments, have been restraining yourself\r\nby a great effort while I have been telling you bitter truths, you\r\nyourself, Padre Fernandez! What good has been secured by him among us\r\nwho has tried to inculcate other ideas? What evils have not fallen upon\r\nyou because you have tried to be just and perform your duty?”\r\n\r\n“Señor Isagani,” said the Dominican, extending his hand, “although it\r\nmay seem that nothing practical has resulted from this conversation,\r\nyet something has been gained. I’ll talk to my brethren about what you\r\nhave told me and I hope that something can be done. Only I fear that\r\nthey won’t believe in your existence.”\r\n\r\n“I fear the same,” returned Isagani, shaking the Dominican’s hand. “I\r\nfear that my friends will not believe in your existence, as you have\r\nrevealed yourself to me today.” [57]\r\n\r\nConsidering the interview at an end, the young man took his leave.\r\n\r\nPadre Fernandez opened the door and followed him with his gaze until he\r\ndisappeared around a corner in the corridor. For some time he listened\r\nto the retreating footsteps, then went back into his cell and waited\r\nfor the youth to appear in the street.\r\n\r\nHe saw him and actually heard him say to a friend who asked where he\r\nwas going: “To the Civil Government! I’m going to see the pasquinades\r\nand join the others!”\r\n\r\nHis startled friend stared at him as one would look at a person who is\r\nabout to commit suicide, then moved away from him hurriedly.\r\n\r\n“Poor boy!” murmured Padre Fernandez, feeling his eyes moisten. “I\r\ngrudge you to the Jesuits who educated you.”\r\n\r\nBut Padre Fernandez was completely mistaken; the Jesuits repudiated\r\nIsagani [58] when that afternoon they learned that he had been\r\narrested, saying that he would compromise them. “That young man has\r\nthrown himself away, he’s going to do us harm! Let it be understood\r\nthat he didn’t get those ideas here.”\r\n\r\nNor were the Jesuits wrong. No! Those ideas come only from God through\r\nthe medium of Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTATAKUT\r\n\r\n\r\nWith prophetic inspiration Ben-Zayb had been for some days past\r\nmaintaining in his newspaper that education was disastrous, very\r\ndisastrous for the Philippine Islands, and now in view of the events of\r\nthat Friday of pasquinades, the writer crowed and chanted his triumph,\r\nleaving belittled and overwhelmed his adversary Horatius, who in the\r\nPirotecnia had dared to ridicule him in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\r\n    From our contemporary, El Grito:\r\n\r\n    “Education is disastrous, very disastrous, for the Philippine\r\n    Islands.”\r\n\r\n    Admitted.\r\n\r\n    For some time El Grito has pretended to represent the Filipino\r\n    people—ergo, as Fray Ibañez would say, if he knew Latin.\r\n\r\n    But Fray Ibañez turns Mussulman when he writes, and we know how the\r\n    Mussulmans dealt with education. In witness whereof, as a royal\r\n    preacher said, the Alexandrian library!\r\n\r\n\r\nNow he was right, he, Ben-Zayb! He was the only one in the islands who\r\nthought, the only one who foresaw events!\r\n\r\nTruly, the news that seditious pasquinades had been found on the doors\r\nof the University not only took away the appetite from many and\r\ndisturbed the digestion of others, but it even rendered the phlegmatic\r\nChinese uneasy, so that they no longer dared to sit in their shops with\r\none leg drawn up as usual, from fear of losing time in extending it in\r\norder to put themselves into flight. At eight o’clock in the morning,\r\nalthough the sun continued on its course and his Excellency, the\r\nCaptain-General, did not appear at the head of his victorious cohorts,\r\nstill the excitement had increased. The friars who were accustomed to\r\nfrequent Quiroga’s bazaar did not put in their appearance, and this\r\nsymptom presaged terrific cataclysms. If the sun had risen a square and\r\nthe saints appeared only in pantaloons, Quiroga would not have been so\r\ngreatly alarmed, for he would have taken the sun for a gaming-table and\r\nthe sacred images for gamblers who had lost their camisas, but for the\r\nfriars not to come, precisely when some novelties had just arrived for\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nBy means of a provincial friend of his, Quiroga forbade entrance into\r\nhis gaming-houses to every Indian who was not an old acquaintance, as\r\nthe future Chinese consul feared that they might get possession of the\r\nsums that the wretches lost there. After arranging his bazaar in such a\r\nway that he could close it quickly in case of need, he had a policeman\r\naccompany him for the short distance that separated his house from\r\nSimoun’s. Quiroga thought this occasion the most propitious for making\r\nuse of the rifles and cartridges that he had in his warehouse, in the\r\nway the jeweler had pointed out; so that on the following days there\r\nwould be searches made, and then—how many prisoners, how many terrified\r\npeople would give up their savings! It was the game of the old\r\ncarbineers, in slipping contraband cigars and tobacco-leaves under a\r\nhouse, in order to pretend a search and force the unfortunate owner to\r\nbribery or fines, only now the art had been perfected and, the tobacco\r\nmonopoly abolished, resort was had to the prohibited arms.\r\n\r\nBut Simoun refused to see any one and sent word to the Chinese that he\r\nshould leave things as they were, whereupon he went to see Don Custodio\r\nto inquire whether he should fortify his bazaar, but neither would Don\r\nCustodio receive him, being at the time engaged in the study of a\r\nproject for defense in case of a siege. He thought of Ben-Zayb as a\r\nsource of information, but finding the writer armed to the teeth and\r\nusing two loaded revolvers for paper-weights, took his leave in the\r\nshortest possible time, to shut himself up in his house and take to his\r\nbed under pretense of illness.\r\n\r\nAt four in the afternoon the talk was no longer of simple pasquinades.\r\nThere were whispered rumors of an understanding between the students\r\nand the outlaws of San Mateo, it was certain that in the pansitería\r\nthey had conspired to surprise the city, there was talk of German ships\r\noutside the bay to support the movement, of a band of young men who\r\nunder the pretext of protesting and demonstrating their Hispanism had\r\ngone to the Palace to place themselves at the General’s orders but had\r\nbeen arrested because it was discovered that they were armed.\r\nProvidence had saved his Excellency, preventing him from receiving\r\nthose precocious criminals, as he was at the time in conference with\r\nthe Provincials, the Vice-Rector, and with Padre Irene, Padre Salvi’s\r\nrepresentative. There was considerable truth in these rumors, if we\r\nhave to believe Padre Irene, who in the afternoon went to visit Capitan\r\nTiago. According to him, certain persons had advised his Excellency to\r\nimprove the opportunity in order to inspire terror and administer a\r\nlasting lesson to the filibusters.\r\n\r\n“A number shot,” one had advised, “some two dozen reformers deported at\r\nonce, in the silence of the night, would extinguish forever the flames\r\nof discontent.”\r\n\r\n“No,” rejoined another, who had a kind heart, “sufficient that the\r\nsoldiers parade through the streets, a troop of cavalry, for example,\r\nwith drawn sabers—sufficient to drag along some cannon, that’s enough!\r\nThe people are timid and will all retire into their houses.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” insinuated another. “This is the opportunity to get rid of\r\nthe enemy. It’s not sufficient that they retire into their houses, they\r\nshould be made to come out, like evil humors by means of plasters. If\r\nthey are inclined to start riots, they should be stirred up by secret\r\nagitators. I am of the opinion that the troops should be resting on\r\ntheir arms and appearing careless and indifferent, so the people may be\r\nemboldened, and then in case of any disturbance—out on them, action!”\r\n\r\n“The end justifies the means,” remarked another. “Our end is our holy\r\nreligion and the integrity of the fatherland. Proclaim a state of\r\nsiege, and in case of the least disturbance, arrest all the rich and\r\neducated, and—clean up the country!”\r\n\r\n“If I hadn’t got there in time to counsel moderation,” added Padre\r\nIrene, speaking to Capitan Tiago, “it’s certain that blood would now be\r\nflowing through the streets. I thought of you, Capitan—The partizans of\r\nforce couldn’t do much with the General, and they missed Simoun. Ah, if\r\nSimoun had not been taken ill—”\r\n\r\nWith the arrest of Basilio and the search made later among his books\r\nand papers, Capitan Tiago had become much worse. Now Padre Irene had\r\ncome to augment his terror with hair-raising tales. Ineffable fear\r\nseized upon the wretch, manifesting itself first by a light shiver,\r\nwhich was rapidly accentuated, until he was unable to speak. With his\r\neyes bulging and his brow covered with sweat, he caught Padre Irene’s\r\narm and tried to rise, but could not, and then, uttering two groans,\r\nfell heavily back upon the pillow. His eyes were wide open and he was\r\nslavering—but he was dead. The terrified Padre Irene fled, and, as the\r\ndying man had caught hold of him, in his flight he dragged the corpse\r\nfrom the bed, leaving it sprawling in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\nBy night the terror had reached a climax. Several incidents had\r\noccurred to make the timorous believe in the presence of secret\r\nagitators.\r\n\r\nDuring a baptism some cuartos were thrown to the boys and naturally\r\nthere was a scramble at the door of the church. It happened that at the\r\ntime there was passing a bold soldier, who, somewhat preoccupied,\r\nmistook the uproar for a gathering of filibusters and hurled himself,\r\nsword in hand, upon the boys. He went into the church, and had he not\r\nbecome entangled in the curtains suspended from the choir he would not\r\nhave left a single head on shoulders. It was but the matter of a moment\r\nfor the timorous to witness this and take to flight, spreading the news\r\nthat the revolution had begun. The few shops that had been kept open\r\nwere now hastily closed, there being Chinese who even left bolts of\r\ncloth outside, and not a few women lost their slippers in their flight\r\nthrough the streets. Fortunately, there was only one person wounded and\r\na few bruised, among them the soldier himself, who suffered a fall\r\nfighting with the curtain, which smelt to him of filibusterism. Such\r\nprowess gained him great renown, and a renown so pure that it is to be\r\nwished all fame could be acquired in like manner—mothers would then\r\nweep less and earth would be more populous!\r\n\r\nIn a suburb the inhabitants caught two unknown individuals burying arms\r\nunder a house, whereupon a tumult arose and the people pursued the\r\nstrangers in order to kill them and turn their bodies over to the\r\nauthorities, but some one pacified the excited crowd by telling them\r\nthat it would be sufficient to hand over the corpora delictorum, which\r\nproved to be some old shotguns that would surely have killed the first\r\nperson who tried to fire them.\r\n\r\n“All right,” exclaimed one braggart, “if they want us to rebel, let’s\r\ngo ahead!” But he was cuffed and kicked into silence, the women\r\npinching him as though he had been the owner of the shotguns.\r\n\r\nIn Ermita the affair was more serious, even though there was less\r\nexcitement, and that when there were shots fired. A certain cautious\r\ngovernment employee, armed to the teeth, saw at nightfall an object\r\nnear his house, and taking it for nothing less than a student, fired at\r\nit twice with a revolver. The object proved to be a policeman, and they\r\nburied him—pax Christi! Mutis!\r\n\r\nIn Dulumbayan various shots also resounded, from which there resulted\r\nthe death of a poor old deaf man, who had not heard the sentinel’s\r\nquién vive, and of a hog that had heard it and had not answered España!\r\nThe old man was buried with difficulty, since there was no money to pay\r\nfor the obsequies, but the hog was eaten.\r\n\r\nIn Manila, [59] in a confectionery near the University much frequented\r\nby the students, the arrests were thus commented upon.\r\n\r\n“And have they arrested Tadeo?” [60] asked the proprietess.\r\n\r\n“Abá!” answered a student who lived in Parian, “he’s already shot!”\r\n\r\n“Shot! Nakú! He hasn’t paid what he owes me.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, don’t mention that or you’ll be taken for an accomplice. I’ve\r\nalready burnt the book [61] you lent me. There might be a search and it\r\nwould be found. Be careful!”\r\n\r\n“Did you say that Isagani is a prisoner?”\r\n\r\n“Crazy fool, too, that Isagani,” replied the indignant student. “They\r\ndidn’t try to catch him, but he went and surrendered. Let him bust\r\nhimself—he’ll surely be shot.”\r\n\r\nThe señora shrugged her shoulders. “He doesn’t owe me anything. And\r\nwhat about Paulita?”\r\n\r\n“She won’t lack a husband. Sure, she’ll cry a little, and then marry a\r\nSpaniard.”\r\n\r\nThe night was one of the gloomiest. In the houses the rosary was\r\nrecited and pious women dedicated paternosters and requiems to each of\r\nthe souls of their relatives and friends. By eight o’clock hardly a\r\npedestrian could be seen—only from time to time was heard the galloping\r\nof a horse against whose sides a saber clanked noisily, then the\r\nwhistles of the watchmen, and carriages that whirled along at full\r\nspeed, as though pursued by mobs of filibusters.\r\n\r\nYet terror did not reign everywhere. In the house of the silversmith,\r\nwhere Placido Penitente boarded, the events were commented upon and\r\ndiscussed with some freedom.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe in the pasquinades,” declared a workman, lank and\r\nwithered from operating the blowpipe. “To me it looks like Padre\r\nSalvi’s doings.”\r\n\r\n“Ahem, ahem!” coughed the silversmith, a very prudent man, who did not\r\ndare to stop the conversation from fear that he would be considered a\r\ncoward. The good man had to content himself with coughing, winking to\r\nhis helper, and gazing toward the street, as if to say, “They may be\r\nwatching us!”\r\n\r\n“On account of the operetta,” added another workman.\r\n\r\n“Aha!” exclaimed one who had a foolish face, “I told you so!”\r\n\r\n“Ahem!” rejoined a clerk, in a tone of compassion, “the affair of the\r\npasquinades is true, Chichoy, and I can give you the explanation.”\r\n\r\nThen he added mysteriously, “It’s a trick of the Chinaman Quiroga’s!”\r\n\r\n“Ahem, ahem!” again coughed the silversmith, shifting his quid of buyo\r\nfrom one cheek to the other.\r\n\r\n“Believe me, Chichoy, of Quiroga the Chinaman! I heard it in the\r\noffice.”\r\n\r\n“Nakú, it’s certain then,” exclaimed the simpleton, believing it at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n“Quiroga,” explained the clerk, “has a hundred thousand pesos in\r\nMexican silver out in the bay. How is he to get it in? Very easily. Fix\r\nup the pasquinades, availing himself of the question of the students,\r\nand, while every-body is excited, grease the officials’ palms, and in\r\nthe cases come!”\r\n\r\n“Just it! Just it!” cried the credulous fool, striking the table with\r\nhis fist. “Just it! That’s why Quiroga did it! That’s why—” But he had\r\nto relapse into silence as he really did not know what to say about\r\nQuiroga.\r\n\r\n“And we must pay the damages?” asked the indignant Chichoy.\r\n\r\n“Ahem, ahem, a-h-hem!” coughed the silversmith, hearing steps in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nThe footsteps approached and all in the shop fell silent.\r\n\r\n“St. Pascual Bailon is a great saint,” declared the silversmith\r\nhypocritically, in a loud voice, at the same time winking to the\r\nothers. “St. Pascual Bailon—”\r\n\r\nAt that moment there appeared the face of Placido Penitente, who was\r\naccompanied by the pyrotechnician that we saw receiving orders from\r\nSimoun. The newcomers were surrounded and importuned for news.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t been able to talk with the prisoners,” explained Placido.\r\n“There are some thirty of them.”\r\n\r\n“Be on your guard,” cautioned the pyrotechnician, exchanging a knowing\r\nlook with Placido. “They say that to-night there’s going to be a\r\nmassacre.”\r\n\r\n“Aha! Thunder!” exclaimed Chichoy, looking about for a weapon. Seeing\r\nnone, he caught up his blowpipe.\r\n\r\nThe silversmith sat down, trembling in every limb. The credulous\r\nsimpleton already saw himself beheaded and wept in anticipation over\r\nthe fate of his family.\r\n\r\n“No,” contradicted the clerk, “there’s not going to be any massacre.\r\nThe adviser of”—he made a mysterious gesture—“is fortunately sick.”\r\n\r\n“Simoun!”\r\n\r\n“Ahem, ahem, a-h-hem!”\r\n\r\nPlacido and the pyrotechnician exchanged another look.\r\n\r\n“If he hadn’t got sick—”\r\n\r\n“It would look like a revolution,” added the pyrotechnician\r\nnegligently, as he lighted a cigarette in the lamp chimney. “And what\r\nshould we do then?”\r\n\r\n“Then we’d start a real one, now that they’re going to massacre us\r\nanyhow—”\r\n\r\nThe violent fit of coughing that seized the silversmith prevented the\r\nrest of this speech from being heard, but Chichoy must have been saying\r\nterrible things, to judge from his murderous gestures with the blowpipe\r\nand the face of a Japanese tragedian that he put on.\r\n\r\n“Rather say that he’s playing off sick because he’s afraid to go out.\r\nAs may be seen—”\r\n\r\nThe silversmith was attacked by another fit of coughing so severe that\r\nhe finally asked all to retire.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, get ready,” warned the pyrotechnician. “If they want to\r\nforce us to kill or be killed—”\r\n\r\nAnother fit of coughing on the part of the poor silversmith prevented\r\nfurther conversation, so the workmen and apprentices retired to their\r\nhomes, carrying with them hammers and saws, and other implements, more\r\nor less cutting, more or less bruising, disposed to sell their lives\r\ndearly. Placido and the pyrotechnician went out again.\r\n\r\n“Prudence, prudence!” cautioned the silversmith in a tearful voice.\r\n\r\n“You’ll take care of my widow and orphans!” begged the credulous\r\nsimpleton in a still more tearful voice, for he already saw himself\r\nriddled with bullets and buried.\r\n\r\nThat night the guards at the city gates were replaced with Peninsular\r\nartillerymen, and on the following morning as the sun rose, Ben-Zayb,\r\nwho had ventured to take a morning stroll to examine the condition of\r\nthe fortifications, found on the glacis near the Luneta the corpse of a\r\nnative girl, half-naked and abandoned. Ben-Zayb was horrified, but\r\nafter touching it with his cane and gazing toward the gates proceeded\r\non his way, musing over a sentimental tale he might base upon the\r\nincident.\r\n\r\nHowever, no allusion to it appeared in the newspapers on the following\r\ndays, engrossed as they were with the falls and slippings caused by\r\nbanana-peels. In the dearth of news Ben-Zayb had to comment at length\r\non a cyclone that had destroyed in America whole towns, causing the\r\ndeath of more than two thousand persons. Among other beautiful things\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\r\n   “The sentiment of charity, MORE PREVALENT IN CATHOLIC COUNTRIES\r\n    THAN IN OTHERS, and the thought of Him who, influenced by that same\r\n    feeling, sacrificed himself for humanity, moves (sic) us to\r\n    compassion over the misfortunes of our kind and to render thanks\r\n    that in this country, so scourged by cyclones, there are not\r\n    enacted scenes so desolating as that which the inhabitants of the\r\n    United States mus have witnessed!”\r\n\r\n\r\nHoratius did not miss the opportunity, and, also without mentioning the\r\ndead, or the murdered native girl, or the assaults, answered him in his\r\nPirotecnia:\r\n\r\n\r\n   “After such great charity and such great humanity, Fray Ibañez—I\r\n    mean, Ben-Zayb—brings himself to pray for the Philippines.\r\n\r\n    But he is understood.\r\n\r\n    Because he is not Catholic, and the sentiment of charity is most\r\n    prevalent,” etc. [62]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nEXIT CAPITAN TIAGO\r\n\r\n                                                  Talis vita, finis ita\r\n\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago had a good end—that is, a quite exceptional funeral. True\r\nit is that the curate of the parish had ventured the observation to\r\nPadre Irene that Capitan Tiago had died without confession, but the\r\ngood priest, smiling sardonically, had rubbed the tip of his nose and\r\nanswered:\r\n\r\n“Why say that to me? If we had to deny the obsequies to all who die\r\nwithout confession, we should forget the De profundis! These\r\nrestrictions, as you well know, are enforced when the impenitent is\r\nalso insolvent. But Capitan Tiago—out on you! You’ve buried infidel\r\nChinamen, and with a requiem mass!”\r\n\r\nCapitan Tiago had named Padre Irene as his executor and willed his\r\nproperty in part to St. Clara, part to the Pope, to the Archbishop, the\r\nreligious corporations, leaving twenty pesos for the matriculation of\r\npoor students. This last clause had been dictated at the suggestion of\r\nPadre Irene, in his capacity as protector of studious youths. Capitan\r\nTiago had annulled a legacy of twenty-five pesos that he had left to\r\nBasilio, in view of the ungrateful conduct of the boy during the last\r\nfew days, but Padre Irene had restored it and announced that he would\r\ntake it upon his own purse and conscience.\r\n\r\nIn the dead man’s house, where were assembled on the following day many\r\nold friends and acquaintances, considerable comment was indulged in\r\nover a miracle. It was reported that, at the very moment when he was\r\ndying, the soul of Capitan Tiago had appeared to the nuns surrounded by\r\na brilliant light. God had saved him, thanks to the pious legacies, and\r\nto the numerous masses he had paid for. The story was commented upon,\r\nit was recounted vividly, it took on particulars, and was doubted by no\r\none. The appearance of Capitan Tiago was minutely described—of course\r\nthe frock coat, the cheek bulged out by the quid of buyo, without\r\nomitting the game-cock and the opium-pipe. The senior sacristan, who\r\nwas present, gravely affirmed these facts with his head and reflected\r\nthat, after death, he would appear with his cup of white tajú, for\r\nwithout that refreshing breakfast he could not comprehend happiness\r\neither on earth or in heaven.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, because of their inability to discuss the events of\r\nthe preceding day and because there were gamblers present, many strange\r\nspeculations were developed. They made conjectures as to whether\r\nCapitan Tiago would invite St. Peter to a soltada, whether they would\r\nplace bets, whether the game-cocks were immortal, whether invulnerable,\r\nand in this case who would be the referee, who would win, and so on:\r\ndiscussions quite to the taste of those who found sciences, theories,\r\nand systems, based on a text which they esteem infallible, revealed or\r\ndogmatic. Moreover, there were cited passages from novenas, books of\r\nmiracles, sayings of the curates, descriptions of heaven, and other\r\nembroidery. Don Primitivo, the philosopher, was in his glory quoting\r\nopinions of the theologians.\r\n\r\n“Because no one can lose,” he stated with great authority. “To lose\r\nwould cause hard feelings and in heaven there can’t be any hard\r\nfeelings.”\r\n\r\n“But some one has to win,” rejoined the gambler Aristorenas. “The fun\r\nlies in winning!”\r\n\r\n“Well, both win, that’s easy!”\r\n\r\nThis idea of both winning could not be admitted by Aristorenas, for he\r\nhad passed his life in the cockpit and had always seen one cock lose\r\nand the other win—at best, there was a tie. Vainly Don Primitivo argued\r\nin Latin. Aristorenas shook his head, and that too when Don Primitivo’s\r\nLatin was easy to understand, for he talked of an gallus talisainus,\r\nacuto tari armatus, an gallus beati Petri bulikus sasabung̃us sit, [63]\r\nand so on, until at length he decided to resort to the argument which\r\nmany use to convince and silence their opponents.\r\n\r\n“You’re going to be damned, friend Martin, you’re falling into heresy!\r\nCave ne cadas! I’m not going to play monte with you any more, and we’ll\r\nnot set up a bank together. You deny the omnipotence of God, peccatum\r\nmortale! You deny the existence of the Holy Trinity— three are one and\r\none is three! Take care! You indirectly deny that two natures, two\r\nunderstandings, and two wills can have only one memory! Be careful!\r\nQuicumque non crederit anathema sit!”\r\n\r\nMartin Aristorenas shrank away pale and trembling, while Quiroga, who\r\nhad listened with great attention to the argument, with marked\r\ndeference offered the philosopher a magnificent cigar, at the same time\r\nasking in his caressing voice: “Surely, one can make a contract for a\r\ncockpit with Kilisto, [64] ha? When I die, I’ll be the contractor, ha?”\r\n\r\nAmong the others, they talked more of the deceased; at least they\r\ndiscussed what kind of clothing to put on him. Capitan Tinong proposed\r\na Franciscan habit—and fortunately, he had one, old, threadbare, and\r\npatched, a precious object which, according to the friar who gave it to\r\nhim as alms in exchange for thirty-six pesos, would preserve the corpse\r\nfrom the flames of hell and which reckoned in its support various pious\r\nanecdotes taken from the books distributed by the curates. Although he\r\nheld this relic in great esteem, Capitan Tinong was disposed to part\r\nwith it for the sake of his intimate friend, whom he had not been able\r\nto visit during his illness. But a tailor objected, with good reason,\r\nthat since the nuns had seen Capitan Tiago ascending to heaven in a\r\nfrock coat, in a frock coat he should be dressed here on earth, nor was\r\nthere any necessity for preservatives and fire-proof garments. The\r\ndeceased had attended balls and fiestas in a frock coat, and nothing\r\nelse would be expected of him in the skies—and, wonderful to relate,\r\nthe tailor accidentally happened to have one ready, which he would part\r\nwith for thirty-two pesos, four cheaper than the Franciscan habit,\r\nbecause he didn’t want to make any profit on Capitan Tiago, who had\r\nbeen his customer in life and would now be his patron in heaven. But\r\nPadre Irene, trustee and executor, rejected both proposals and ordered\r\nthat the Capitan be dressed in one of his old suits of clothes,\r\nremarking with holy unction that God paid no attention to clothing.\r\n\r\nThe obsequies were, therefore, of the very first class. There were\r\nresponsories in the house, and in the street three friars officiated,\r\nas though one were not sufficient for such a great soul. All the rites\r\nand ceremonies possible were performed, and it is reported that there\r\nwere even extras, as in the benefits for actors. It was indeed a\r\ndelight: loads of incense were burned, there were plenty of Latin\r\nchants, large quantities of holy water were expended, and Padre Irene,\r\nout of regard for his old friend, sang the Dies Irae in a falsetto\r\nvoice from the choir, while the neighbors suffered real headaches from\r\nso much knell-ringing.\r\n\r\nDoña Patrocinio, the ancient rival of Capitan Tiago in religiosity,\r\nactually wanted to die on the next day, so that she might order even\r\nmore sumptuous obsequies. The pious old lady could not bear the thought\r\nthat he, whom she had long considered vanquished forever, should in\r\ndying come forward again with so much pomp. Yes, she desired to die,\r\nand it seemed that she could hear the exclamations of the people at the\r\nfuneral: “This indeed is what you call a funeral! This indeed is to\r\nknow how to die, Doña Patrocinio!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nJULI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of Capitan Tiago and Basilio’s imprisonment were soon\r\nreported in the province, and to the honor of the simple inhabitants of\r\nSan Diego, let it be recorded that the latter was the incident more\r\nregretted and almost the only one discussed. As was to be expected, the\r\nreport took on different forms, sad and startling details were given,\r\nwhat could not be understood was explained, the gaps being filled by\r\nconjectures, which soon passed for accomplished facts, and the phantoms\r\nthus created terrified their own creators.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Tiani it was reported that at least, at the very least,\r\nthe young man was going to be deported and would very probably be\r\nmurdered on the journey. The timorous and pessimistic were not\r\nsatisfied with this but even talked about executions and\r\ncourts-martial—January was a fatal month; in January the Cavite affair\r\nhad occurred, and they [65] even though curates, had been garroted, so\r\na poor Basilio without protectors or friends—\r\n\r\n“I told him so!” sighed the Justice of the Peace, as if he had at some\r\ntime given advice to Basilio. “I told him so.”\r\n\r\n“It was to be expected,” commented Sister Penchang. “He would go into\r\nthe church and when he saw that the holy water was somewhat dirty he\r\nwouldn’t cross himself with it. He talked about germs and disease, abá,\r\nit’s the chastisement of God! He deserved it, and he got it! As though\r\nthe holy water could transmit diseases! Quite the contrary, abá!”\r\n\r\nShe then related how she had cured herself of indigestion by moistening\r\nher stomach with holy water, at the same time reciting the Sanctus\r\nDeus, and she recommended the remedy to those present when they should\r\nsuffer from dysentery, or an epidemic occurred, only that then they\r\nmust pray in Spanish:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Santo Diós,\r\n        Santo fuerte,\r\n        Santo inmortal,\r\n        ¡Libranos, Señor, de la peste\r\n        Y de todo mal! [66]\r\n\r\n\r\n“It’s an infallible remedy, but you must apply the holy water to the\r\npart affected,” she concluded.\r\n\r\nBut there were many persons who did not believe in these things, nor\r\ndid they attribute Basilio’s imprisonment to the chastisement of God.\r\nNor did they take any stock in insurrections and pasquinades, knowing\r\nthe prudent and ultra-pacific character of the boy, but preferred to\r\nascribe it to revenge on the part of the friars, because of his having\r\nrescued from servitude Juli, the daughter of a tulisan who was the\r\nmortal enemy of a certain powerful corporation. As they had quite a\r\npoor idea of the morality of that same corporation and could recall\r\ncases of petty revenge, their conjecture was believed to have more\r\nprobability and justification.\r\n\r\n“What a good thing I did when I drove her from my house!” said Sister\r\nPenchang. “I don’t want to have any trouble with the friars, so I urged\r\nher to find the money.”\r\n\r\nThe truth was, however, that she regretted Juli’s liberty, for Juli\r\nprayed and fasted for her, and if she had stayed a longer time, would\r\nalso have done penance. Why, if the curates pray for us and Christ died\r\nfor our sins, couldn’t Juli do the same for Sister Penchang?\r\n\r\nWhen the news reached the hut where the poor Juli and her grandfather\r\nlived, the girl had to have it repeated to her. She stared at Sister\r\nBali, who was telling it, as though without comprehension, without\r\nability to collect her thoughts. Her ears buzzed, she felt a sinking at\r\nthe heart and had a vague presentiment that this event would have a\r\ndisastrous influence on her own future. Yet she tried to seize upon a\r\nray of hope, she smiled, thinking that Sister Bali was joking with her,\r\na rather strong joke, to be sure, but she forgave her beforehand if she\r\nwould acknowledge that it was such. But Sister Bali made a cross with\r\none of her thumbs and a forefinger, and kissed it, to prove that she\r\nwas telling the truth. Then the smile faded forever from the girl’s\r\nlips, she turned pale, frightfully pale, she felt her strength leave\r\nher and for the first time in her life she lost consciousness, falling\r\ninto a swoon.\r\n\r\nWhen by dint of blows, pinches, dashes of water, crosses, and the\r\napplication of sacred palms, the girl recovered and remembered the\r\nsituation, silent tears sprang from her eyes, drop by drop, without\r\nsobs, without laments, without complaints! She thought about Basilio,\r\nwho had had no other protector than Capitan Tiago, and who now, with\r\nthe Capitan dead, was left completely unprotected and in prison. In the\r\nPhilippines it is a well-known fact that patrons are needed for\r\neverything, from the time one is christened until one dies, in order to\r\nget justice, to secure a passport, or to develop an industry. As it was\r\nsaid that his imprisonment was due to revenge on account of herself and\r\nher father, the girl’s sorrow turned to desperation. Now it was her\r\nduty to liberate him, as he had done in rescuing her from servitude,\r\nand the inner voice which suggested the idea offered to her imagination\r\na horrible means.\r\n\r\n“Padre Camorra, the curate,” whispered the voice. Juli gnawed at her\r\nlips and became lost in gloomy meditation.\r\n\r\nAs a result of her father’s crime, her grandfather had been arrested in\r\nthe hope that by such means the son could be made to appear. The only\r\none who could get him his liberty was Padre Camorra, and Padre Camorra\r\nhad shown himself to be poorly satisfied with her words of gratitude,\r\nhaving with his usual frankness asked for some sacrifices—since which\r\ntime Juli had tried to avoid meeting him. But the curate made her kiss\r\nhis hand, he twitched her nose and patted her cheeks, he joked with\r\nher, winking and laughing, and laughing he pinched her. Juli was also\r\nthe cause of the beating the good curate had administered to some young\r\nmen who were going about the village serenading the girls. Malicious\r\nones, seeing her pass sad and dejected, would remark so that she might\r\nhear: “If she only wished it, Cabesang Tales would be pardoned.”\r\n\r\nJuli reached her home, gloomy and with wandering looks. She had changed\r\ngreatly, having lost her merriment, and no one ever saw her smile\r\nagain. She scarcely spoke and seemed to be afraid to look at her own\r\nface. One day she was seen in the town with a big spot of soot on her\r\nforehead, she who used to go so trim and neat. Once she asked Sister\r\nBali if the people who committed suicide went to hell.\r\n\r\n“Surely!” replied that woman, and proceeded to describe the place as\r\nthough she had been there.\r\n\r\nUpon Basilio’s imprisonment, the simple and grateful relatives had\r\nplanned to make all kinds of sacrifices to save the young man, but as\r\nthey could collect among themselves no more than thirty pesos, Sister\r\nBali, as usual, thought of a better plan.\r\n\r\n“What we must do is to get some advice from the town clerk,” she said.\r\nTo these poor people, the town clerk was what the Delphic oracle was to\r\nthe ancient Greeks.\r\n\r\n“By giving him a real and a cigar,” she continued, “he’ll tell you all\r\nthe laws so that your head bursts listening to him. If you have a peso,\r\nhe’ll save you, even though you may be at the foot of the scaffold.\r\nWhen my friend Simon was put in jail and flogged for not being able to\r\ngive evidence about a robbery perpetrated near his house, abá, for two\r\nreales and a half and a string of garlics, the town clerk got him out.\r\nAnd I saw Simon myself when he could scarcely walk and he had to stay\r\nin bed at least a month. Ay, his flesh rotted as a result and he died!”\r\n\r\nSister Bali’s advice was accepted and she herself volunteered to\r\ninterview the town clerk. Juli gave her four reales and added some\r\nstrips of jerked venison her grand-father had got, for Tandang Selo had\r\nagain devoted himself to hunting.\r\n\r\nBut the town clerk could do nothing—the prisoner was in Manila, and his\r\npower did not extend that far. “If at least he were at the capital,\r\nthen—” he ventured, to make a show of his authority, which he knew very\r\nwell did not extend beyond the boundaries of Tiani, but he had to\r\nmaintain his prestige and keep the jerked venison. “But I can give you\r\na good piece of advice, and it is that you go with Juli to see the\r\nJustice of the Peace. But it’s very necessary that Juli go.”\r\n\r\nThe Justice of the Peace was a very rough fellow, but if he should see\r\nJuli he might conduct himself less rudely—this is wherein lay the\r\nwisdom of the advice.\r\n\r\nWith great gravity the honorable Justice listened to Sister Bali, who\r\ndid the talking, but not without staring from time to time at the girl,\r\nwho hung her head with shame. People would say that she was greatly\r\ninterested in Basilio, people who did not remember her debt of\r\ngratitude, nor that his imprisonment, according to report, was on her\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nAfter belching three or four times, for his Honor had that ugly habit,\r\nhe said that the only person who could save Basilio was Padre Camorra,\r\nin case he should care to do so. Here he stared meaningly at the girl\r\nand advised her to deal with the curate in person.\r\n\r\n“You know what influence he has,—he got your grand-father out of jail.\r\nA report from him is enough to deport a new-born babe or save from\r\ndeath a man with the noose about his neck.”\r\n\r\nJuli said nothing, but Sister Bali took this advice as though she had\r\nread it in a novena, and was ready to accompany the girl to the\r\nconvento. It so happened that she was just going there to get as alms a\r\nscapulary in exchange for four full reales.\r\n\r\nBut Juli shook her head and was unwilling to go to the convento. Sister\r\nBali thought she could guess the reason—Padre Camorra was reputed to be\r\nvery fond of the women and was very frolicsome—so she tried to reassure\r\nher. “You’ve nothing to fear if I go with you. Haven’t you read in the\r\nbooklet Tandang Basio, given you by the curate, that the girls should\r\ngo to the convento, even without the knowledge of their elders, to\r\nrelate what is going on at home? Abá, that book is printed with the\r\npermission of the Archbishop!”\r\n\r\nJuli became impatient and wished to cut short such talk, so she begged\r\nthe pious woman to go if she wished, but his Honor observed with a\r\nbelch that the supplications of a youthful face were more moving than\r\nthose of an old one, the sky poured its dew over the fresh flowers in\r\ngreater abundance than over the withered ones. The metaphor was\r\nfiendishly beautiful.\r\n\r\nJuli did not reply and the two left the house. In the street the girl\r\nfirmly refused to go to the convento and they returned to their\r\nvillage. Sister Bali, who felt offended at this lack of confidence in\r\nherself, on the way home relieved her feelings by administering a long\r\npreachment to the girl.\r\n\r\nThe truth was that the girl could not take that step without damning\r\nherself in her own eyes, besides being cursed of men and cursed of God!\r\nIt had been intimated to her several times, whether with reason or not,\r\nthat if she would make that sacrifice her father would be pardoned, and\r\nyet she had refused, in spite of the cries of her conscience reminding\r\nher of her filial duty. Now must she make it for Basilio, her\r\nsweetheart? That would be to fall to the sound of mockery and laughter\r\nfrom all creation. Basilio himself would despise her! No, never! She\r\nwould first hang herself or leap from some precipice. At any rate, she\r\nwas already damned for being a wicked daughter.\r\n\r\nThe poor girl had besides to endure all the reproaches of her\r\nrelatives, who, knowing nothing of what had passed between her and\r\nPadre Camovra, laughed at her fears. Would Padre Camorra fix his\r\nattention upon a country girl when there were so many others in the\r\ntown? Hero the good women cited names of unmarried girls, rich and\r\nbeautiful, who had been more or less unfortunate. Meanwhile, if they\r\nshould shoot Basilio?\r\n\r\nJuli covered her ears and stared wildly about, as if seeking a voice\r\nthat might plead for her, but she saw only her grandfather, who was\r\ndumb and had his gaze fixed on his hunting-spear.\r\n\r\nThat night she scarcely slept at all. Dreams and nightmares, some\r\nfunereal, some bloody, danced before her sight and woke her often,\r\nbathed in cold perspiration. She fancied that she heard shots, she\r\nimagined that she saw her father, that father who had done so much for\r\nher, fighting in the forests, hunted like a wild beast because she had\r\nrefused to save him. The figure of her father was transformed and she\r\nrecognized Basilio, dying, with looks of reproach at her. The wretched\r\ngirl arose, prayed, wept, called upon her mother, upon death, and there\r\nwas even a moment when, overcome with terror, if it had not been\r\nnight-time, she would have run straight to the convento, let happen\r\nwhat would.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of day the sad presentiments and the terrors of\r\ndarkness were partly dissipated. The light inspired hopes in her. But\r\nthe news of the afternoon was terrible, for there was talk of persons\r\nshot, so the next night was for the girl frightful. In her desperation\r\nshe decided to give herself up as soon as day dawned and then kill\r\nherself afterwards—anything, rather than enditre such tortures! But the\r\ndawn brought new hope and she would not go to church or even leave the\r\nhouse. She was afraid she would yield.\r\n\r\nSo passed several days in praying and cursing, in calling upon God and\r\nwishing for death. The day gave her a slight respite and she trusted in\r\nsome miracle. The reports that came from Manila, although they reached\r\nthere magnified, said that of the prisoners some had secured their\r\nliberty, thanks to patrons and influence. Some one had to be\r\nsacrificed—who would it be? Juli shuddered and returned home biting her\r\nfinger-nails. Then came the night with its terrors, which took on\r\ndouble proportions and seemed to be converted into realities. Juli\r\nfeared to fall asleep, for her slumbers were a continuous nightmare.\r\nLooks of reproach would flash across her eyelids just as soon as they\r\nwere closed, complaints and laments pierced her ears. She saw her\r\nfather wandering about hungry, without rest or repose; she saw Basilio\r\ndying in the road, pierced by two bullets, just as she had seen the\r\ncorpse of that neighbor who had been killed while in the charge of the\r\nCivil Guard. She saw the bonds that cut into the flesh, she saw the\r\nblood pouring from the mouth, she heard Basilio calling to her, “Save\r\nme! Save me! You alone can save me!” Then a burst of laughter would\r\nresound and she would turn her eyes to see her father gazing at her\r\nwith eyes full of reproach. Juli would wake up, sit up on her petate,\r\nand draw her hands across her forehead to arrange her hair—cold sweat,\r\nlike the sweat of death, moistened it!\r\n\r\n“Mother, mother!” she sobbed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, they who were so carelessly disposing of people’s fates, he\r\nwho commanded the legal murders, he who violated justice and made use\r\nof the law to maintain himself by force, slept in peace.\r\n\r\nAt last a traveler arrived from Manila and reported that all the\r\nprisoners had been set free, all except Basilio, who had no protector.\r\nIt was reported in Manila, added the traveler, that the young man would\r\nbe deported to the Carolines, having been forced to sign a petition\r\nbeforehand, in which he declared that he asked it voluntarily. [67] The\r\ntraveler had seen the very steamer that was going to take him away.\r\n\r\nThis report put an end to all the girl’s hesitation. Besides, her mind\r\nwas already quite weak from so many nights of watching and horrible\r\ndreams. Pale and with unsteady eyes, she sought out Sister Bali and, in\r\na voice that was cause for alarm, told her that she was ready, asking\r\nher to accompany her. Sister Bali thereupon rejoiced and tried to\r\nsoothe her, but Juli paid no attention to her, apparently intent only\r\nupon hurrying to the convento. She had decked herself out in her finest\r\nclothes, and even pretended to be quite gay, talking a great deal,\r\nalthough in a rather incoherent way.\r\n\r\nSo they set out. Juli went ahead, becoming impatient that her companion\r\nlagged behind. But as they neared the town, her nervous energy began\r\ngradually to abate, she fell silent and wavered in her resolution,\r\nlessened her pace and soon dropped behind, so that Sister Bali had to\r\nencourage her.\r\n\r\n“We’ll get there late,” she remonstrated.\r\n\r\nJuli now followed, pale, with downcast eyes, which she was afraid to\r\nraise. She felt that the whole world was staring at her and pointing\r\nits finger at her. A vile name whistled in her ears, but still she\r\ndisregarded it and continued on her way. Nevertheless, when they came\r\nin sight of the convento, she stopped and began to tremble.\r\n\r\n“Let’s go home, let’s go home,” she begged, holding her companion back.\r\n\r\nSister Bali had to take her by the arm and half drag her along,\r\nreassuring her and telling her about the books of the friars. She would\r\nnot desert her, so there was nothing to fear. Padre Camorra had other\r\nthings in mind—Juli was only a poor country girl.\r\n\r\nBut upon arriving at the door of the convento, Juli firmly refused to\r\ngo in, catching hold of the wall.\r\n\r\n“No, no,” she pleaded in terror. “No, no, no! Have pity!”\r\n\r\n“But what a fool—”\r\n\r\nSister Bali pushed her gently along, Juli, pallid and with wild\r\nfeatures, offering resistance. The expression of her face said that she\r\nsaw death before her.\r\n\r\n“All right, let’s go back, if you don’t want to!” at length the good\r\nwoman exclaimed in irritation, as she did not believe there was any\r\nreal danger. Padre Camorra, in spite of all his reputation, would dare\r\ndo nothing before her.\r\n\r\n“Let them carry poor Basilio into exile, let them shoot him on the way,\r\nsaying that he tried to escape,” she added. “When he’s dead, then\r\nremorse will come. But as for myself, I owe him no favors, so he can’t\r\nreproach me!”\r\n\r\nThat was the decisive stroke. In the face of that reproach, with wrath\r\nand desperation mingled, like one who rushes to suicide, Juli closed\r\nher eyes in order not to see the abyss into which she was hurling\r\nherself and resolutely entered the convento. A sigh that sounded like\r\nthe rattle of death escaped from her lips. Sister Bali followed,\r\ntelling her how to act.\r\n\r\nThat night comments were mysteriously whispered about certain events\r\nwhich had occurred that afternoon. A girl had leaped from a window of\r\nthe convento, falling upon some stones and killing herself. Almost at\r\nthe same time another woman had rushed out of the convento to run\r\nthrough the streets shouting and screaming like a lunatic. The prudent\r\ntownsfolk dared not utter any names and many mothers pinched their\r\ndaughters for letting slip expressions that might compromise them.\r\n\r\nLater, very much later, at twilight, an old man came from a village and\r\nstood calling at the door of the convento, which was closed and guarded\r\nby sacristans. The old man beat the door with his fists and with his\r\nhead, while he littered cries stifled and inarticulate, like those of a\r\ndumb person, until he was at length driven away by blows and shoves.\r\nThen he made his way to the gobernadorcillo’s house, but was told that\r\nthe gobernadorcillo was not there, he was at the convento; he went to\r\nthe Justice of the Peace, but neither was the Justice of the Peace at\r\nhome—he had been summoned to the convento; he went to the\r\nteniente-mayor, but he too was at the convento; he directed his steps\r\nto the barracks, but the lieutenant of the Civil Guard was at the\r\nconvento. The old man then returned to his village, weeping like a\r\nchild. His wails were heard in the middle of the night, causing men to\r\nbite their lips and women to clasp their hands, while the dogs slunk\r\nfearfully back into the houses with their tails between their legs.\r\n\r\n“Ah, God, God!” said a poor woman, lean from fasting, “in Thy presence\r\nthere is no rich, no poor, no white, no black—Thou wilt grant us\r\njustice!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” rejoined her husband, “just so that God they preach is not a\r\npure invention, a fraud! They themselves are the first not to believe\r\nin Him.”\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock in the evening it was rumored that more than seven\r\nfriars, proceeding from neighboring towns, were assembled in the\r\nconvento to hold a conference. On the following day, Tandang Selo\r\ndisappeared forever from the village, carrying with him his\r\nhunting-spear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE HIGH OFFICIAL\r\n\r\n                       L’Espagne et sa, vertu, l’Espagne et sa grandeur\r\n                       Tout s’en va!—Victor Hugo\r\n\r\n\r\nThe newspapers of Manila were so engrossed in accounts of a notorious\r\nmurder committed in Europe, in panegyrics and puffs for various\r\npreachers in the city, in the constantly increasing success of the\r\nFrench operetta, that they could scarcely devote space to the crimes\r\nperpetrated in the provinces by a band of tulisanes headed by a fierce\r\nand terrible leader who was called Matanglawin. [68] Only when the\r\nobject of the attack was a convento or a Spaniard there then appeared\r\nlong articles giving frightful details and asking for martial law,\r\nenergetic measures, and so on. So it was that they could take no notice\r\nof what had occurred in the town of Tiani, nor was there the slightest\r\nhint or allusion to it. In private circles something was whispered, but\r\nso confused, so vague, and so little consistent, that not even the name\r\nof the victim was known, while those who showed the greatest interest\r\nforgot it quickly, trusting that the affair had been settled in some\r\nway with the wronged family. The only one who knew anything certain was\r\nPadre Camorra, who had to leave the town, to be transferred to another\r\nor to remain for some time in the convento in Manila.\r\n\r\n“Poor Padre Camorra!” exclaimed Ben-Zayb in a fit of generosity. “He\r\nwas so jolly and had such a good heart!”\r\n\r\nIt was true that the students had recovered their liberty, thanks to\r\nthe exertions of their relatives, who did not hesitate at expense,\r\ngifts, or any sacrifice whatsoever. The first to see himself free, as\r\nwas to be expected, was Makaraig, and the last Isagani, because Padre\r\nFlorentine did not reach Manila until a week after the events. So many\r\nacts of clemency secured for the General the title of clement and\r\nmerciful, which Ben-Zayb hastened to add to his long list of\r\nadjectives.\r\n\r\nThe only one who did not obtain his liberty was Basilio, since he was\r\nalso accused of having in his possession prohibited books. We don’t\r\nknow whether this referred to his text-book on legal medicine or to the\r\npamphlets that were found, dealing with the Philippines, or both\r\ntogether—the fact is that it was said that prohibited literature was\r\nbeing secretly sold, and upon the unfortunate boy fell all the weight\r\nof the rod of justice.\r\n\r\nIt was reported that his Excellency had been thus advised: “It’s\r\nnecessary that there be some one, so that the prestige of authority may\r\nbe sustained and that it may not be said that we made a great fuss over\r\nnothing. Authority before everything. It’s necessary that some one be\r\nmade an example of. Let there be just one, one who, according to Padre\r\nIrene, was the servant of Capitan Tiago—there’ll be no one to enter a\r\ncomplaint—”\r\n\r\n“Servant and student?” asked his Excellency. “That fellow, then! Let it\r\nbe he!”\r\n\r\n“Your Excellency will pardon me,” observed the high official, who\r\nhappened to be present, “but I’ve been told that this boy is a medical\r\nstudent and his teachers speak well of him. If he remains a prisoner\r\nhe’ll lose a year, and as this year he finishes—”\r\n\r\nThe high official’s interference in behalf of Basilio, instead of\r\nhelping, harmed him. For some time there had been between this official\r\nand his Excellency strained relations and bad feelings, augmented by\r\nfrequent clashes.\r\n\r\n“Yes? So much the greater reason that he should be kept prisoner; a\r\nyear longer in his studies, instead of injuring him, will do good, not\r\nonly to himself but to all who afterwards fall into his hands. One\r\ndoesn’t become a bad physician by extensive practise. So much the more\r\nreason that he should remain! Soon the filibustering reformers will say\r\nthat we are not looking out for the country!” concluded his Excellency\r\nwith a sarcastic laugh.\r\n\r\nThe high official realized that he had made a false move and took\r\nBasilio’s case to heart. “But it seems to me that this young man is the\r\nmost innocent of all,” he rejoined rather timidly.\r\n\r\n“Books have been seized in his possession,” observed the secretary.\r\n\r\n“Yes, works on medicine and pamphlets written by Peninsulars, with the\r\nleaves uncut, and besides, what does that signify? Moreover, this young\r\nman was not present at the banquet in the pansitería, he hasn’t mixed\r\nup in anything. As I’ve said, he’s the most innocent—”\r\n\r\n“So much the better!” exclaimed his Excellency jocosely. “In that way\r\nthe punishment will prove more salutary and exemplary, since it\r\ninspires greater terror. To govern is to act in this way, my dear sir,\r\nas it is often expedient to sacrifice the welfare of one to the welfare\r\nof many. But I’m doing more—from the welfare of one will result the\r\nwelfare of all, the principle of endangered authority is preserved,\r\nprestige is respected and maintained. By this act of mine I’m\r\ncorrecting my own and other people’s faults.”\r\n\r\nThe high official restrained himself with an effort and, disregarding\r\nthe allusion, decided to take another tack. “But doesn’t your\r\nExcellency fear the—responsibility?”\r\n\r\n“What have I to fear?” rejoined the General impatiently. “Haven’t I\r\ndiscretionary powers? Can’t I do what I please for the better\r\ngovernment of these islands? What have I to fear? Can some menial\r\nperhaps arraign me before the tribunals and exact from me\r\nresponsibility? Even though he had the means, he would have to consult\r\nthe Ministry first, and the Minister—”\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand and burst out into laughter.\r\n\r\n“The Minister who appointed me, the devil knows where he is, and he\r\nwill feel honored in being able to welcome me when I return. The\r\npresent one, I don’t even think of him, and the devil take him too! The\r\none that relieves him will find himself in so many difficulties with\r\nhis new duties that he won’t be able to fool with trifles. I, my dear\r\nsir, have nothing over me but my conscience, I act according to my\r\nconscience, and my conscience is satisfied, so I don’t care a straw for\r\nthe opinions of this one and that. My conscience, my dear sir, my\r\nconscience!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, General, but the country—”\r\n\r\n“Tut, tut, tut, tut! The country—what have I to do Avith the country?\r\nHave I perhaps contracted any obligations to it? Do I owe my office to\r\nit? Was it the country that elected me?”\r\n\r\nA brief pause ensued, during which the high official stood with bowed\r\nhead. Then, as if reaching a decision, he raised it to stare fixedly at\r\nthe General. Pale and trembling, he said with repressed energy: “That\r\ndoesn’t matter, General, that doesn’t matter at all! Your Excellency\r\nhas not been chosen by the Filipino people, but by Spain, all the more\r\nreason why you should treat the Filipinos well so that they may not be\r\nable to reproach Spain. The greater reason, General, the greater\r\nreason! Your Excellency, by coming here, has contracted the obligation\r\nto govern justly, to seek the welfare—”\r\n\r\n“Am I not doing it?” interrupted his Excellency in exasperation, taking\r\na step forward. “Haven’t I told you that I am getting from the good of\r\none the good of all? Are you now going to give me lessons? If you don’t\r\nunderstand my actions, how am I to blame? Do I compel you to share my\r\nresponsibility?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” replied the high official, drawing himself up proudly.\r\n“Your Excellency does not compel me, your Excellency cannot compel me,\r\nme, to share your responsibility. I understand mine in quite another\r\nway, and because I have it, I’m going to speak—I’ve held my peace a\r\nlong time. Oh, your Excellency needn’t make those gestures, because the\r\nfact that I’ve come here in this or that capacity doesn’t mean that I\r\nhave given up my rights, that I have been reduced to the part of a\r\nslave, without voice or dignity.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want Spain to lose this beautiful empire, these eight millions\r\nof patient and submissive subjects, who live on hopes and delusions,\r\nbut neither do I wish to soil my hands in their barbarous exploitation.\r\nI don’t wish it ever to be said that, the slave-trade abolished, Spain\r\nhas continued to cloak it with her banner and perfect it under a wealth\r\nof specious institutions. No, to be great Spain does not have to be a\r\ntyrant, Spain is sufficient unto herself, Spain was greater when she\r\nhad only her own territory, wrested from the clutches of the Moor. I\r\ntoo am a Spaniard, but before being a Spaniard I am a man, and before\r\nSpain and above Spain is her honor, the lofty principles of morality,\r\nthe eternal principles of immutable justice! Ah, you are surprised that\r\nI think thus, because you have no idea of the grandeur of the Spanish\r\nname, no, you haven’t any idea of it, you identify it with persons and\r\ninterests. To you the Spaniard may be a pirate, he may be a murderer, a\r\nhypocrite, a cheat, anything, just so he keep what he has—but to me the\r\nSpaniard should lose everything, empire, power, wealth, everything,\r\nbefore his honor! Ah, my dear sir, we protest when we read that might\r\nis placed before right, yet we applaud when in practise we see might\r\nplay the hypocrite in not only perverting right but even in using it as\r\na tool in order to gain control. For the very reason that I love Spain,\r\nI’m speaking now, and I defy your frown!\r\n\r\n“I don’t wish that the coming ages accuse Spain of being the stepmother\r\nof the nations, the vampire of races, the tyrant of small islands,\r\nsince it would be a horrible mockery of the noble principles of our\r\nancient kings. How are we carrying out their sacred legacy? They\r\npromised to these islands protection and justice, and we are playing\r\nwith the lives and liberties of the inhabitants; they promised\r\ncivilization, and we are curtailing it, fearful that they may aspire to\r\na nobler existence; they promised them light, and we cover their eyes\r\nthat they may not witness our orgies; they promised to teach them\r\nvirtue and we are encouraging their vice. Instead of peace, wealth, and\r\njustice, confusion reigns, commerce languishes, and skepticism is\r\nfostered among the masses.\r\n\r\n“Let us put ourselves in the place of the Filipinos and ask ourselves\r\nwhat we would do in their place. Ah, in your silence I read their right\r\nto rebel, and if matters do not mend they will rebel some day, and\r\njustice will be on their side, with them will go the sympathy of all\r\nhonest men, of every patriot in the world! When a people is denied\r\nlight, home, liberty, and justice—things that are essential to life,\r\nand therefore man’s patrimony—that people has the right to treat him\r\nwho so despoils it as we would the robber who intercepts us on the\r\nhighway. There are no distinctions, there are no exceptions, nothing\r\nbut a fact, a right, an aggression, and every honest man who does not\r\nplace himself on the side of the wronged makes himself an accomplice\r\nand stains his conscience.\r\n\r\n“True, I am not a soldier, and the years are cooling the little fire in\r\nmy blood, but just as I would risk being torn to pieces to defend the\r\nintegrity of Spain against any foreign invader or against an\r\nunjustified disloyalty in her provinces, so I also assure you that I\r\nwould place myself beside the oppressed Filipinos, because I would\r\nprefer to fall in the cause of the outraged rights of humanity to\r\ntriumphing with the selfish interests of a nation, even when that\r\nnation be called as it is called—Spain!”\r\n\r\n“Do you know when the mail-boat leaves?” inquired his Excellency\r\ncoldly, when the high official had finished speaking.\r\n\r\nThe latter stared at him fixedly, then dropped his head and silently\r\nleft the palace.\r\n\r\nOutside he found his carriage awaiting him. “Some day when you declare\r\nyourselves independent,” he said somewhat abstractedly to the native\r\nlackey who opened the carriage-door for him, “remember that there were\r\nnot lacking in Spain hearts that beat for you and struggled for your\r\nrights!”\r\n\r\n“Where, sir?” asked the lackey, who had understood nothing of this and\r\nwas inquiring whither they should go.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later the high official handed in his resignation and\r\nannounced his intention of returning to Spain by the next mail-steamer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF THE PASQUINADES\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of the events narrated, many mothers ordered their sons\r\nimmediately to leave off their studies and devote themselves to\r\nidleness or to agriculture. When the examinations came, suspensions\r\nwere plentiful, and he was a rare exception who finished the course, if\r\nhe had belonged to the famous association, to which no one paid any\r\nmore attention. Pecson, Tadeo, and Juanito Pelaez were all alike\r\nsuspended—the first receiving his dismissal with his foolish grin and\r\ndeclaring his intention of becoming an officer in some court, while\r\nTadeo, with his eternal holiday realized at last, paid for an\r\nillumination and made a bonfire of his books. Nor did the others get\r\noff much better, and at length they too had to abandon their studies,\r\nto the great satisfaction of their mothers, who always fancy their sons\r\nhanged if they should come to understand what the books teach. Juanito\r\nPelaez alone took the blow ill, since it forced him to leave school for\r\nhis father’s store, with whom he was thenceforward to be associated in\r\nthe business: the rascal found the store much less entertaining, but\r\nafter some time his friends again noticed his hump appear, a symptom\r\nthat his good humor was returning. The rich Makaraig, in view of the\r\ncatastrophe, took good care not to expose himself, and having secured a\r\npassport by means of money set out in haste for Europe. It was said\r\nthat his Excellency, the Captain-General, in his desire to do good by\r\ngood means, and careful of the interests of the Filipinos, hindered the\r\ndeparture of every one who could not first prove substantially that he\r\nhad the money to spend and could live in idleness in European cities.\r\nAmong our acquaintances those who got off best were Isagani and\r\nSandoval: the former passed in the subject he studied under Padre\r\nFernandez and was suspended in the others, while the latter was able to\r\nconfuse the examining-board with his oratory.\r\n\r\nBasilio was the only one who did not pass in any subject, who was not\r\nsuspended, and who did not go to Europe, for he remained in Bilibid\r\nprison, subjected every three days to examinations, almost always the\r\nsame in principle, without other variation than a change of\r\ninquisitors, since it seemed that in the presence of such great guilt\r\nall gave up or fell away in horror. And while the documents moldered or\r\nwere shifted about, while the stamped papers increased like the\r\nplasters of an ignorant physician on the body of a hypochondriac,\r\nBasilio became informed of all the details of what had happened in\r\nTiani, of the death of Juli and the disappearance of Tandang Selo.\r\nSinong, the abused cochero, who had driven him to San Diego, happened\r\nto be in Manila at that time and called to give him all the news.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Simoun had recovered his health, or so at least the\r\nnewspapers said. Ben-Zayb rendered thanks to “the Omnipotent who\r\nwatches over such a precious life,” and manifested the hope that the\r\nHighest would some day reveal the malefactor, whose crime remained\r\nunpunished, thanks to the charity of the victim, who was too closely\r\nfollowing the words of the Great Martyr: Father, forgive them, for they\r\nknow not what they do. These and other things Ben-Zayb said in print,\r\nwhile by mouth he was inquiring whether there was any truth in the\r\nrumor that the opulent jeweler was going to give a grand fiesta, a\r\nbanquet such as had never before been seen, in part to celebrate his\r\nrecovery and in part as a farewell to the country in which he had\r\nincreased his fortune. It was whispered as certain that Simoun, who\r\nwould have to leave with the Captain-General, whose command expired in\r\nMay, was making every effort to secure from Madrid an extension, and\r\nthat he was advising his Excellency to start a campaign in order to\r\nhave an excuse for remaining, but it was further reported that for the\r\nfirst time his Excellency had disregarded the advice of his favorite,\r\nmaking it a point of honor not to retain for a single additional day\r\nthe power that had been conferred upon him, a rumor which encouraged\r\nbelief that the fiesta announced would take place; very soon. For the\r\nrest, Simoun remained unfathomable, since he had become very\r\nuncommunicative, showed himself seldom, and smiled mysteriously when\r\nthe rumored fiesta was mentioned.\r\n\r\n“Come, Señor Sindbad,” Ben-Zayb had once rallied him, “dazzle us with\r\nsomething Yankee! You owe something to this country.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless!” was Simoun’s response, with a dry smile.\r\n\r\n“You’ll throw the house wide open, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Maybe, but as I have no house—”\r\n\r\n“You ought to have secured Capitan Tiago’s, which Señor Pelaez got for\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\nSimoun became silent, and from that time on he was often seen in the\r\nstore of Don Timoteo Pelaez, with whom it was said he had entered into\r\npartnership. Some weeks afterward, in the month of April, it was\r\nrumored that Juanito Pelaez, Don Timoteo’s son, was going to marry\r\nPaulita Gomez, the girl coveted by Spaniards and foreigners.\r\n\r\n“Some men are lucky!” exclaimed other envious merchants. “To buy a\r\nhouse for nothing, sell his consignment of galvanized iron well, get\r\ninto partnership with a Simoun, and marry his son to a rich\r\nheiress—just say if those aren’t strokes of luck that all honorable men\r\ndon’t have!”\r\n\r\n“If you only knew whence came that luck of Señor Pelaez’s!” another\r\nresponded, in a tone which indicated that the speaker did know. “It’s\r\nalso assured that there’ll be a fiesta and on a grand scale,” was added\r\nwith mystery.\r\n\r\nIt was really true that Paulita was going to marry Juanito Pelaez. Her\r\nlove for Isagani had gradually waned, like all first loves based on\r\npoetry and sentiment. The events of the pasquinades and the\r\nimprisonment of the youth had shorn him of all his charms. To whom\r\nwould it have occurred to seek danger, to desire to share the fate of\r\nhis comrades, to surrender himself, when every one was hiding and\r\ndenying any complicity in the affair? It was quixotic, it was madness\r\nthat no sensible person in Manila could pardon, and Juanito was quite\r\nright in ridiculing him, representing what a sorry figure he cut when\r\nhe went to the Civil Government. Naturally, the brilliant Paulita could\r\nno longer love a young man who so erroneously understood social matters\r\nand whom all condemned. Then she began to reflect. Juanito was clever,\r\ncapable, gay, shrewd, the son of a rich merchant of Manila, and a\r\nSpanish mestizo besides—if Don Timoteo was to be believed, a\r\nfull-blooded Spaniard. On the other hand, Isagani was a provincial\r\nnative who dreamed of forests infested with leeches, he was of doubtful\r\nfamily, with a priest for an uncle, who would perhaps be an enemy to\r\nluxury and balls, of which she was very fond. One beautiful morning\r\ntherefore it occurred to her that she had been a downright fool to\r\nprefer him to his rival, and from that time on Pelaez’s hump steadily\r\nincreased. Unconsciously, yet rigorously, Paulita was obeying the law\r\ndiscovered by Darwin, that the female surrenders herself to the fittest\r\nmale, to him who knows how to adapt himself to the medium in which he\r\nlives, and to live in Manila there was no other like Pelaez, who from\r\nhis infancy had had chicanery at his finger-tips. Lent passed with its\r\nHoly Week, its array of processions and pompous displays, without other\r\nnovelty than a mysterious mutiny among the artillerymen, the cause of\r\nwhich was never disclosed. The houses of light materials were torn down\r\nin the presence of a troop of cavalry, ready to fall upon the owners in\r\ncase they should offer resistance. There was a great deal of weeping\r\nand many lamentations, but the affair did not get beyond that. The\r\ncurious, among them Simoun, went to see those who were left homeless,\r\nwalking about indifferently and assuring each other that thenceforward\r\nthey could sleep in peace.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of April, all the fears being now forgotten, Manila was\r\nengrossed with one topic: the fiesta that Don Timoteo Pelaez was going\r\nto celebrate at the wedding of his son, for which the General had\r\ngraciously and condescendingly agreed to be the patron. Simoun was\r\nreported to have arranged the matter. The ceremony would be solemnized\r\ntwo days before the departure of the General, who would honor the house\r\nand make a present to the bridegroom. It was whispered that the jeweler\r\nwould pour out cascades of diamonds and throw away handfuls of pearls\r\nin honor of his partner’s son, thus, since he could hold no fiesta of\r\nhis own, as he was a bachelor and had no house, improving the\r\nopportunity to dazzle the Filipino people with a memorable farewell.\r\nAll Manila prepared to be invited, and never did uneasiness take\r\nstronger hold of the mind than in view of the thought of not being\r\namong those bidden. Friendship with Simoun became a matter of dispute,\r\nand many husbands were forced by their wives to purchase bars of steel\r\nand sheets of galvanized iron in order to make friends with Don Timoteo\r\nPelaez.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nLA ULTIMA RAZÓN [69]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the great day arrived. During the morning Simoun had not left\r\nhis house, busied as he was in packing his arms and his jewels. His\r\nfabulous wealth was already locked up in the big steel chest with its\r\ncanvas cover, there remaining only a few cases containing bracelets and\r\npins, doubtless gifts that he meant to make. He was going to leave with\r\nthe Captain-General, who cared in no way to lengthen his stay, fearful\r\nof what people would say. Malicious ones insinuated that Simoun did not\r\ndare remain alone, since without the General’s support he did not care\r\nto expose himself to the vengeance of the many wretches he had\r\nexploited, all the more reason for which was the fact that the General\r\nwho was coming was reported to be a model of rectitude and might make\r\nhim disgorge his gains. The superstitious Indians, on the other hand,\r\nbelieved that Simoun was the devil who did not wish to separate himself\r\nfrom his prey. The pessimists winked maliciously and said, “The field\r\nlaid waste, the locust leaves for other parts!” Only a few, a very few,\r\nsmiled and said nothing.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Simoun had given orders to his servant that if there\r\nappeared a young man calling himself Basilio he should be admitted at\r\nonce. Then he shut himself up in his room and seemed to become lost in\r\ndeep thought. Since his illness the jeweler’s countenance had become\r\nharder and gloomier, while the wrinkles between his eyebrows had\r\ndeepened greatly. He did not hold himself so erect as formerly, and his\r\nhead was bowed.\r\n\r\nSo absorbed was he in his meditations that he did not hear a knock at\r\nthe door, and it had to be repeated. He shuddered and called out, “Come\r\nin!”\r\n\r\nIt was Basilio, but how altered! If the change that had taken place in\r\nSimoun during those two months was great, in the young student it was\r\nfrightful. His cheeks were hollow, his hair unkempt, his clothing\r\ndisordered. The tender melancholy had disappeared from his eyes, and in\r\nits place glittered a dark light, so that it might be said that he had\r\ndied and his corpse had revived, horrified with what it had seen in\r\neternity. If not crime, then the shadow of crime, had fixed itself upon\r\nhis whole appearance. Simoun himself was startled and felt pity for the\r\nwretch.\r\n\r\nWithout any greeting Basilio slowly advanced into the room, and in a\r\nvoice that made the jeweler shudder said to him, “Señor Simoun, I’ve\r\nbeen a wicked son and a bad brother—I’ve overlooked the murder of one\r\nand the tortures of the other, and God has chastised me! Now there\r\nremains to me only one desire, and it is to return evil for evil, crime\r\nfor crime, violence for violence!”\r\n\r\nSimoun listened in silence, while Basilio continued; “Four months ago\r\nyou talked to me about your plans. I refused to take part in them, but\r\nI did wrong, you have been right. Three months and a half ago the\r\nrevolution was on the point of breaking out, but I did not then care to\r\nparticipate in it, and the movement failed. In payment for my conduct\r\nI’ve been arrested and owe my liberty to your efforts only. You are\r\nright and now I’ve come to say to you: put a weapon in my hand and let\r\nthe revolution come! I am ready to serve you, along with all the rest\r\nof the unfortunates.”\r\n\r\nThe cloud that had darkened Simoun’s brow suddenly disappeared, a ray\r\nof triumph darted from his eyes, and like one who has found what he\r\nsought he exclaimed: “I’m right, yes, I’m right! Right and Justice are\r\non my side, because my cause is that of the persecuted. Thanks, young\r\nman, thanks! You’ve come to clear away my doubts, to end my\r\nhesitation.”\r\n\r\nHe had risen and his face was beaming. The zeal that had animated him\r\nwhen four months before he had explained his plans to Basilio in the\r\nwood of his ancestors reappeared in his countenance like a red sunset\r\nafter a cloudy day.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he resumed, “the movement failed and many have deserted me\r\nbecause they saw me disheartened and wavering at the supreme moment. I\r\nstill cherished something in my heart, I was not the master of all my\r\nfeelings, I still loved! Now everything is dead in me, no longer is\r\nthere even a corpse sacred enough for me to respect its sleep. No\r\nlonger will there be any vacillation, for you yourself, an idealistic\r\nyouth, a gentle dove, understand the necessity and come to spur me to\r\naction. Somewhat late you have opened your eyes, for between you and me\r\ntogether we might have executed marvelous plans, I above in the higher\r\ncircles spreading death amid perfume and gold, brutalizing the vicious\r\nand corrupting or paralyzing the few good, and you below among the\r\npeople, among the young men, stirring them to life amid blood and\r\ntears. Our task, instead of being bloody and barbarous, would have been\r\nholy, perfect, artistic, and surely success would have crowned our\r\nefforts. But no intelligence would support me, I encountered fear or\r\neffeminacy among the enlightened classes, selfishness among the rich,\r\nsimplicity among the youth, and only in the mountains, in the waste\r\nplaces, among the outcasts, have I found my men. But no matter now! If\r\nwe can’t get a finished statue, rounded out in all its details, of the\r\nrough block we work upon let those to come take charge!”\r\n\r\nSeizing the arm of Basilio, who was listening without comprehending all\r\nhe said, he led him to the laboratory where he kept his chemical\r\nmixtures. Upon the table was placed a large case made of dark shagreen,\r\nsimilar to those that hold the silver plate exchanged as gifts among\r\nthe rich and powerful. Opening this, Simoun revealed to sight, upon a\r\nbottom of red satin, a lamp of very peculiar shape, Its body was in the\r\nform of a pomegranate as large as a man’s head, with fissures in it\r\nexposing to view the seeds inside, which were fashioned of enormous\r\ncarnelians. The covering was of oxidized gold in exact imitation of the\r\nwrinkles on the fruit.\r\n\r\nSimoun took it out with great care and, removing the burner, exposed to\r\nview the interior of the tank, which was lined with steel two\r\ncentimeters in thickness and which had a capacity of over a liter.\r\nBasilio questioned him with his eyes, for as yet he comprehended\r\nnothing. Without entering upon explanations, Simoun carefully took from\r\na cabinet a flask and showed the young man the formula written upon it.\r\n\r\n“Nitro-glycerin!” murmured Basilio, stepping backward and instinctively\r\nthrusting his hands behind him. “Nitro-glycerin! Dynamite!” Beginning\r\nnow to understand, he felt his hair stand on end.\r\n\r\n“Yes, nitro-glycerin!” repeated Simoun slowly, with his cold smile and\r\na look of delight at the glass flask. “It’s also something more than\r\nnitro-glycerin—it’s concentrated tears, repressed hatred, wrongs,\r\ninjustice, outrage. It’s the last resort of the weak, force against\r\nforce, violence against violence. A moment ago I was hesitating, but\r\nyou have come and decided me. This night the most dangerous tyrants\r\nwill be blown to pieces, the irresponsible rulers that hide themselves\r\nbehind God and the State, whose abuses remain unpunished because no one\r\ncan bring them to justice. This night the Philippines will hear the\r\nexplosion that will convert into rubbish the formless monument whose\r\ndecay I have fostered.”\r\n\r\nBasilio was so terrified that his lips worked without producing any\r\nsound, his tongue was paralyzed, his throat parched. For the first time\r\nhe was looking at the powerful liquid which he had heard talked of as a\r\nthing distilled in gloom by gloomy men, in open war against society.\r\nNow he had it before him, transparent and slightly yellowish, poured\r\nwith great caution into the artistic pomegranate. Simoun looked to him\r\nlike the jinnee of the Arabian Nights that sprang from the sea, he took\r\non gigantic proportions, his head touched the sky, he made the house\r\ntremble and shook the whole city with a shrug of his shoulders. The\r\npomegranate assumed the form of a colossal sphere, the fissures became\r\nhellish grins whence escaped names and glowing cinders. For the first\r\ntime in his life Basilio was overcome with fright and completely lost\r\nhis composure.\r\n\r\nSimoun, meanwhile, screwed on solidly a curious and complicated\r\nmechanism, put in place a glass chimney, then the bomb, and crowned the\r\nwhole with an elegant shade. Then he moved away some distance to\r\ncontemplate the effect, inclining his head now to one side, now to the\r\nother, thus better to appreciate its magnificent appearance.\r\n\r\nNoticing that Basilio was watching him with questioning and suspicious\r\neyes, he said, “Tonight there will be a fiesta and this lamp will be\r\nplaced in a little dining-kiosk that I’ve had constructed for the\r\npurpose. The lamp will give a brilliant light, bright enough to suffice\r\nfor the illumination of the whole place by itself, but at the end of\r\ntwenty minutes the light will fade, and then when some one tries to\r\nturn up the wick a cap of fulminate of mercury will explode, the\r\npomegranate will blow up and with it the dining-room, in the roof and\r\nfloor of which I have concealed sacks of powder, so that no one shall\r\nescape.”\r\n\r\nThere wras a moment’s silence, while Simoun stared at his mechanism and\r\nBasilio scarcely breathed.\r\n\r\n“So my assistance is not needed,” observed the young man.\r\n\r\n“No, you have another mission to fulfill,” replied Simoun thoughtfully.\r\n“At nine the mechanism will have exploded and the report will have been\r\nheard in the country round, in the mountains, in the caves. The\r\nuprising that I had arranged with the artillerymen was a failure from\r\nlack of plan and timeliness, but this time it won’t be so. Upon hearing\r\nthe explosion, the wretched and the oppressed, those who wander about\r\npursued by force, will sally forth armed to join Cabesang Tales in\r\nSanta Mesa, whence they will fall upon the city, [70] while the\r\nsoldiers, whom I have made to believe that the General is shamming an\r\ninsurrection in order to remain, will issue from their barracks ready\r\nto fire upon whomsoever I may designate. Meanwhile, the cowed populace,\r\nthinking that the hour of massacre has come, will rush out prepared to\r\nkill or be killed, and as they have neither arms nor organization, you\r\nwith some others will put yourself at their head and direct them to the\r\nwarehouses of Quiroga, where I keep my rifles. Cabesang Tales and I\r\nwill join one another in the city and take possession of it, while you\r\nin the suburbs will seize the bridges and throw up barricades, and then\r\nbe ready to come to our aid to butcher not only those opposing the\r\nrevolution but also every man who refuses to take up arms and join us.”\r\n\r\n“All?” stammered Basilio in a choking voice.\r\n\r\n“All!” repeated Simoun in a sinister tone. “All—Indians, mestizos,\r\nChinese, Spaniards, all who are found to be without courage, without\r\nenergy. The race must be renewed! Cowardly fathers will only breed\r\nslavish sons, and it wouldn’t be worth while to destroy and then try to\r\nrebuild with rotten materials. What, do you shudder? Do you tremble, do\r\nyou fear to scatter death? What is death? What does a hecatomb of\r\ntwenty thousand wretches signify? Twenty thousand miseries less, and\r\nmillions of wretches saved from birth! The most timid ruler does not\r\nhesitate to dictate a law that produces misery and lingering death for\r\nthousands and thousands of prosperous and industrious subjects, happy\r\nperchance, merely to satisfy a caprice, a whim, his pride, and yet you\r\nshudder because in one night are to be ended forever the mental\r\ntortures of many helots, because a vitiated and paralytic people has to\r\ndie to give place to another, young, active, full of energy!\r\n\r\n“What is death? Nothingness, or a dream? Can its specters be compared\r\nto the reality of the agonies of a whole miserable generation? The\r\nneedful thing is to destroy the evil, to kill the dragon and bathe the\r\nnew people in the blood, in order to make it strong and invulnerable.\r\nWhat else is the inexorable law of Nature, the law of strife in which\r\nthe weak has to succumb so that the vitiated species be not perpetuated\r\nand creation thus travel backwards? Away then with effeminate scruples!\r\nFulfill the eternal laws, foster them, and then the earth will be so\r\nmuch the more fecund the more it is fertilized with blood, and the\r\nthrones the more solid the more they rest upon crimes and corpses. Let\r\nthere be no hesitation, no doubtings! What is the pain of death? A\r\nmomentary sensation, perhaps confused, perhaps agreeable, like the\r\ntransition from waking to sleep. What is it that is being destroyed?\r\nEvil, suffering—feeble weeds, in order to set in their place luxuriant\r\nplants. Do you call that destruction? I should call it creating,\r\nproducing, nourishing, vivifying!”\r\n\r\nSuch bloody sophisms, uttered with conviction and coolness, overwhelmed\r\nthe youth, weakened as he was by more than three months in prison and\r\nblinded by his passion for revenge, so he was not in a mood to analyze\r\nthe moral basis of the matter. Instead of replying that the worst and\r\ncowardliest of men is always something more than a plant, because he\r\nhas a soul and an intelligence, which, however vitiated and brutalized\r\nthey may be, can be redeemed; instead of replying that man has no right\r\nto dispose of one life for the benefit of another, that the right to\r\nlife is inherent in every individual like the right to liberty and to\r\nlight; instead of replying that if it is an abuse on the part of\r\ngovernments to punish in a culprit the faults and crimes to which they\r\nhave driven him by their own negligence or stupidity, how much more so\r\nwould it be in a man, however great and however unfortunate he might\r\nbe, to punish in a wretched people the faults of its governments and\r\nits ancestors; instead of declaring that God alone can use such\r\nmethods, that God can destroy because He can create, God who holds in\r\nHis hands recompense, eternity, and the future, to justify His acts,\r\nand man never; instead of these reflections, Basilio merely interposed\r\na cant reflection.\r\n\r\n“What will the world say at the sight of such butchery?”\r\n\r\n“The world will applaud, as usual, conceding the right of the\r\nstrongest, the most violent!” replied Simoun with his cruel smile.\r\n“Europe applauded when the western nations sacrificed millions of\r\nIndians in America, and not by any means to found nations much more\r\nmoral or more pacific: there is the North with its egotistic liberty,\r\nits lynch-law, its political frauds—the South with its turbulent\r\nrepublics, its barbarous revolutions, civil wars, pronunciamientos, as\r\nin its mother Spain! Europe applauded when the powerful Portugal\r\ndespoiled the Moluccas, it applauds while England is destroying the\r\nprimitive races in the Pacific to make room for its emigrants. Europe\r\nwill applaud as the end of a drama, the close of a tragedy, is\r\napplauded, for the vulgar do not fix their attention on principles,\r\nthey look only at results. Commit the crime well, and you will be\r\nadmired and have more partizans than if you had carried out virtuous\r\nactions with modesty and timidity.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” rejoined the youth, “what does it matter to me, after all,\r\nwhether they praise or censure, when this world takes no care of the\r\noppressed, of the poor, and of weak womankind? What obligations have I\r\nto recognize toward society when it has recognized none toward me?”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I like to hear,” declared the tempter triumphantly. He\r\ntook a revolver from a case and gave it to Basilio, saying, “At ten\r\no’clock wait for me in front of the church of St. Sebastian to receive\r\nmy final instructions. Ah, at nine you must be far, very far from Calle\r\nAnloague.”\r\n\r\nBasilio examined the weapon, loaded it, and placed it in the inside\r\npocket of his coat, then took his leave with a curt, “I’ll see you\r\nlater.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE WEDDING\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce in the street, Basilio began to consider how he might spend the\r\ntime until the fatal hour arrived, for it was then not later than seven\r\no’clock. It was the vacation period and all the students were back in\r\ntheir towns, Isagani being the only one who had not cared to leave, but\r\nhe had disappeared that morning and no one knew his whereabouts—so\r\nBasilio had been informed when after leaving the prison he had gone to\r\nvisit his friend and ask him for lodging. The young man did not know\r\nwhere to go, for he had no money, nothing but the revolver. The memory\r\nof the lamp filled his imagination, the great catastrophe that would\r\noccur within two hours. Pondering over this, he seemed to see the men\r\nwho passed before his eyes walking without heads, and he felt a thrill\r\nof ferocious joy in telling himself that, hungry and destitute, he that\r\nnight was going to be dreaded, that from a poor student and servant,\r\nperhaps the sun would see him transformed into some one terrible and\r\nsinister, standing upon pyramids of corpses, dictating laws to all\r\nthose who were passing before his gaze now in magnificent carriages. He\r\nlaughed like one condemned to death and patted the butt of the\r\nrevolver. The boxes of cartridges were also in his pockets.\r\n\r\nA question suddenly occurred to him—where would the drama begin? In his\r\nbewilderment he had not thought of asking Simoun, but the latter had\r\nwarned him to keep away from Calle Anloague. Then came a suspicion:\r\nthat afternoon, upon leaving the prison, he had proceeded to the former\r\nhouse of Capitan Tiago to get his few personal effects and had found it\r\ntransformed, prepared for a fiesta—the wedding of Juanito Pelaez!\r\nSimoun had spoken of a fiesta.\r\n\r\nAt this moment he noticed passing in front of him a long line of\r\ncarriages filled with ladies and gentlemen, conversing in a lively\r\nmanner, and he even thought he could make out big bouquets of flowers,\r\nbut he gave the detail no thought. The carriages were going toward\r\nCalle Rosario and in meeting those that came down off the Bridge of\r\nSpain had to move along slowly and stop frequently. In one he saw\r\nJuanito Pelaez at the side of a woman dressed in white with a\r\ntransparent veil, in whom he recognized Paulita Gomez.\r\n\r\n“Paulita!” he ejaculated in surprise, realizing that it was indeed she,\r\nin a bridal gown, along with Juanito Pelaez, as though they were just\r\ncoming from the church. “Poor Isagani!” he murmured, “what can have\r\nbecome of him?”\r\n\r\nHe thought for a while about his friend, a great and generous soul, and\r\nmentally asked himself if it would not be well to tell him about the\r\nplan, then answered himself that Isagani would never take part in such\r\na butchery. They had not treated Isagani as they had him.\r\n\r\nThen he thought that had there been no imprisonment, he would have been\r\nbetrothed, or a husband, at this time, a licentiate in medicine, living\r\nand working in some corner of his province. The ghost of Juli, crushed\r\nin her fall, crossed his mind, and dark flames of hatred lighted his\r\neyes; again he caressed the butt of the revolver, regretting that the\r\nterrible hour had not yet come. Just then he saw Simoun come out of the\r\ndoor of his house, carrying in his hands the case containing the lamp,\r\ncarefully wrapped up, and enter a carriage, which then followed those\r\nbearing the bridal party. In order not to lose track of Simoun, Basilio\r\ntook a good look at the cochero and with astonishment recognized in him\r\nthe wretch who had driven him to San Diego, Sinong, the fellow\r\nmaltreated by the Civil Guard, the same who had come to the prison to\r\ntell him about the occurrences in Tiani.\r\n\r\nConjecturing that Calle Anloague was to be the scene of action, thither\r\nthe youth directed his steps, hurrying forward and getting ahead of the\r\ncarriages, which were, in fact, all moving toward the former house of\r\nCapitan Tiago—there they were assembling in search of a ball, but\r\nactually to dance in the air! Basilio smiled when he noticed the pairs\r\nof civil-guards who formed the escort, and from their number he could\r\nguess the importance of the fiesta and the guests. The house overflowed\r\nwith people and poured floods of light from its windows, the entrance\r\nwas carpeted and strewn with flowers. Upstairs there, perhaps in his\r\nformer solitary room, an orchestra was playing lively airs, which did\r\nnot completely drown the confused tumult of talk and laughter.\r\n\r\nDon Timoteo Pelaez was reaching the pinnacle of fortune, and the\r\nreality surpassed his dreams. He was, at last, marrying his son to the\r\nrich Gomez heiress, and, thanks to the money Simoun had lent him, he\r\nhad royally furnished that big house, purchased for half its value, and\r\nwas giving in it a splendid fiesta, with the foremost divinities of the\r\nManila Olympus for his guests, to gild him with the light of their\r\nprestige. Since that morning there had been recurring to him, with the\r\npersistence of a popular song, some vague phrases that he had read in\r\nthe communion service. “Now has the fortunate hour come! Now draws nigh\r\nthe happy moment! Soon there will be fulfilled in you the admirable\r\nwords of Simoun—‘I live, and yet not I alone, but the Captain-General\r\nliveth in me.’” The Captain-General the patron of his son! True, he had\r\nnot attended the ceremony, where Don Custodio had represented him, but\r\nhe would come to dine, he would bring a wedding-gift, a lamp which not\r\neven Aladdin’s—between you and me, Simoun was presenting the lamp.\r\nTimoteo, what more could you desire?\r\n\r\nThe transformation that Capitan Tiago’s house had undergone was\r\nconsiderable—it had been richly repapered, while the smoke and the\r\nsmell of opium had been completely eradicated. The immense sala,\r\nwidened still more by the colossal mirrors that infinitely multiplied\r\nthe lights of the chandeliers, was carpeted throughout, for the salons\r\nof Europe had carpets, and even though the floor was of wide boards\r\nbrilliantly polished, a carpet it must have too, since nothing should\r\nbe lacking. The rich furniture of Capitan Tiago had disappeared and in\r\nits place was to be seen another kind, in the style of Louis XV. Heavy\r\ncurtains of red velvet, trimmed with gold, with the initials of the\r\nbridal couple worked on them, and upheld by garlands of artificial\r\norange-blossoms, hung as portières and swept the floor with their wide\r\nfringes, likewise of gold. In the corners appeared enormous Japanese\r\nvases, alternating with those of Sèvres of a clear dark-blue, placed\r\nupon square pedestals of carved wood.\r\n\r\nThe only decorations not in good taste were the screaming chromos which\r\nDon Timoteo had substituted for the old drawings and pictures of saints\r\nof Capitan Tiago. Simoun had been unable to dissuade him, for the\r\nmerchant did not want oil-paintings—some one might ascribe them to\r\nFilipino artists! He, a patron of Filipino artists, never! On that\r\npoint depended his peace of mind and perhaps his life, and he knew how\r\nto get along in the Philippines! It is true that he had heard foreign\r\npainters mentioned—Raphael, Murillo, Velasquez—but he did not know\r\ntheir addresses, and then they might prove to be somewhat seditious.\r\nWith the chromos he ran no risk, as the Filipinos did not make them,\r\nthey came cheaper, the effect was the same, if not better, the colors\r\nbrighter and the execution very fine. Don’t say that Don Timoteo did\r\nnot know how to comport himself in the Philippines!\r\n\r\nThe large hallway was decorated with flowers, having been converted\r\ninto a dining-room, with a long table for thirty persons in the center,\r\nand around the sides, pushed against the walls, other smaller ones for\r\ntwo or three persons each. Bouquets of flowers, pyramids of fruits\r\namong ribbons and lights, covered their centers. The groom’s place was\r\ndesignated by a bunch of roses and the bride’s by another of\r\norange-blossoms and tuberoses. In the presence of so much finery and\r\nflowers one could imagine that nymphs in gauzy garments and Cupids with\r\niridescent wings were going to serve nectar and ambrosia to aerial\r\nguests, to the sound of lyres and Aeolian harps.\r\n\r\nBut the table for the greater gods was not there, being placed yonder\r\nin the middle of the wide azotea within a magnificent kiosk constructed\r\nespecially for the occasion. A lattice of gilded wood over which\r\nclambered fragrant vines screened the interior from the eyes of the\r\nvulgar without impeding the free circulation of air to preserve the\r\ncoolness necessary at that season. A raised platform lifted the table\r\nabove the level of the others at which the ordinary mortals were going\r\nto dine and an arch decorated by the best artists would protect the\r\naugust heads from the jealous gaze of the stars.\r\n\r\nOn this table were laid only seven plates. The dishes were of solid\r\nsilver, the cloth and napkins of the finest linen, the wines the most\r\ncostly and exquisite. Don Timoteo had sought the most rare and\r\nexpensive in everything, nor would he have hesitated at crime had he\r\nbeen assured that the Captain-General liked to eat human flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nTHE FIESTA\r\n\r\n                                              “Danzar sobre un volcán.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBy seven in the evening the guests had begun to arrive: first, the\r\nlesser divinities, petty government officials, clerks, and merchants,\r\nwith the most ceremonious greetings and the gravest airs at the start,\r\nas if they were parvenus, for so much light, so many decorations, and\r\nso much glassware had some effect. Afterwards, they began to be more at\r\nease, shaking their fists playfully, with pats on the shoulders, and\r\neven familiar slaps on the back. Some, it is true, adopted a rather\r\ndisdainful air, to let it be seen that they were accustomed to better\r\nthings—of course they were! There was one goddess who yawned, for she\r\nfound everything vulgar and even remarked that she was ravenously\r\nhungry, while another quarreled with her god, threatening to box his\r\nears.\r\n\r\nDon Timoteo bowed here and bowed there, scattered his best smiles,\r\ntightened his belt, stepped backward, turned halfway round, then\r\ncompletely around, and so on again and again, until one goddess could\r\nnot refrain from remarking to her neighbor, under cover of her fan: “My\r\ndear, how important the old man is! Doesn’t he look like a\r\njumping-jack?”\r\n\r\nLater came the bridal couple, escorted by Doña Victorina and the rest\r\nof the party. Congratulations, hand-shakings, patronizing pats for the\r\ngroom: for the bride, insistent stares and anatomical observations on\r\nthe part of the men, with analyses of her gown, her toilette,\r\nspeculations as to her health and strength on the part of the women.\r\n\r\n“Cupid and Psyche appearing on Olympus,” thought Ben-Zayb, making a\r\nmental note of the comparison to spring it at some better opportunity.\r\nThe groom had in fact the mischievous features of the god of love, and\r\nwith a little good-will his hump, which the severity of his frock coat\r\ndid not altogether conceal, could be taken for a quiver.\r\n\r\nDon Timoteo began to feel his belt squeezing him, the corns on his feet\r\nbegan to ache, his neck became tired, but still the General had not\r\ncome. The greater gods, among them Padre Irene and Padre Salvi, had\r\nalready arrived, it was true, but the chief thunderer was still\r\nlacking. The poor man became uneasy, nervous; his heart beat violently,\r\nbut still he had to bow and smile; he sat down, he arose, failed to\r\nhear what was said to him, did not say what he meant. In the meantime,\r\nan amateur god made remarks to him about his chromos, criticizing them\r\nwith the statement that they spoiled the walls.\r\n\r\n“Spoil the walls!” repeated Don Timoteo, with a smile and a desire to\r\nchoke him. “But they were made in Europe and are the most costly I\r\ncould get in Manila! Spoil the walls!” Don Timoteo swore to himself\r\nthat on the very next day he would present for payment all the chits\r\nthat the critic had signed in his store.\r\n\r\nWhistles resounded, the galloping of horses was heard—at last! “The\r\nGeneral! The Captain-General!”\r\n\r\nPale with emotion, Don Timoteo, dissembling the pain of his corns and\r\naccompanied by his son and some of the greater gods, descended to\r\nreceive the Mighty Jove. The pain at his belt vanished before the\r\ndoubts that now assailed him: should he frame a smile or affect\r\ngravity; should he extend his hand or wait for the General to offer\r\nhis? Carambas! Why had nothing of this occurred to him before, so that\r\nhe might have consulted his good friend Simoun?\r\n\r\nTo conceal his agitation, he whispered to his son in a low, shaky\r\nvoice, “Have you a speech prepared?”\r\n\r\n“Speeches are no longer in vogue, papa, especially on such an occasion\r\nas this.”\r\n\r\nJupiter arrived in the company of Juno, who was converted into a tower\r\nof artificial lights—with diamonds in her hair, diamonds around her\r\nneck, on her arms, on her shoulders, she was literally covered with\r\ndiamonds. She was arrayed in a magnificent silk gown having a long\r\ntrain decorated with embossed flowers.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency literally took possession of the house, as Don Timoteo\r\nstammeringly begged him to do. [71] The orchestra played the royal\r\nmarch while the divine couple majestically ascended the carpeted\r\nstairway.\r\n\r\nNor was his Excellency’s gravity altogether affected. Perhaps for the\r\nfirst time since his arrival in the islands he felt sad, a strain of\r\nmelancholy tinged his thoughts. This was the last triumph of his three\r\nyears of government, and within two days he would descend forever from\r\nsuch an exalted height. What was he leaving behind? His Excellency did\r\nnot care to turn his head backwards, but preferred to look ahead, to\r\ngaze into the future. Although he was carrying away a fortune, large\r\nsums to his credit were awaiting him in European banks, and he had\r\nresidences, yet he had injured many, he had made enemies at the Court,\r\nthe high official was waiting for him there. Other Generals had\r\nenriched themselves as rapidly as he, and now they were ruined. Why not\r\nstay longer, as Simoun had advised him to do? No, good taste before\r\neverything else. The bows, moreover, were not now so profound as\r\nbefore, he noticed insistent stares and even looks of dislike, but\r\nstill he replied affably and even attempted to smile.\r\n\r\n“It’s plain that the sun is setting,” observed Padre Irene in\r\nBen-Zayb’s ear. “Many now stare him in the face.”\r\n\r\nThe devil with the curate—that was just what he was going to remark!\r\n\r\n“My dear,” murmured into the ear of a neighbor the lady who had\r\nreferred to Don Timoteo as a jumping-jack, “did you ever see such a\r\nskirt?”\r\n\r\n“Ugh, the curtains from the Palace!”\r\n\r\n“You don’t say! But it’s true! They’re carrying everything away. You’ll\r\nsee how they make wraps out of the carpets.”\r\n\r\n“That only goes to show that she has talent and taste,” observed her\r\nhusband, reproving her with a look. “Women should be economical.” This\r\npoor god was still suffering from the dressmaker’s bill.\r\n\r\n“My dear, give me curtains at twelve pesos a yard, and you’ll see if I\r\nput on these rags!” retorted the goddess in pique. “Heavens! You can\r\ntalk when you have done something fine like that to give you the\r\nright!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Basilio stood before the house, lost in the throng of\r\ncurious spectators, counting those who alighted from their carriages.\r\nWhen he looked upon so many persons, happy and confident, when he saw\r\nthe bride and groom followed by their train of fresh and innocent\r\nlittle girls, and reflected that they were going to meet there a\r\nhorrible death, he was sorry and felt his hatred waning within him. He\r\nwanted to save so many innocents, he thought of notifying the police,\r\nbut a carriage drove up to set down Padre Salvi and Padre Irene, both\r\nbeaming with content, and like a passing cloud his good intentions\r\nvanished. “What does it matter to me?” he asked himself. “Let the\r\nrighteous suffer with the sinners.”\r\n\r\nThen he added, to silence his scruples: “I’m not an informer, I mustn’t\r\nabuse the confidence he has placed in me. I owe him, him more than I do\r\nthem: he dug my mother’s grave, they killed her! What have I to do with\r\nthem? I did everything possible to be good and useful, I tried to\r\nforgive and forget, I suffered every imposition, and only asked that\r\nthey leave me in peace. I got in no one’s way. What have they done to\r\nme? Let their mangled limbs fly through the air! We’ve suffered\r\nenough.”\r\n\r\nThen he saw Simoun alight with the terrible lamp in his hands, saw him\r\ncross the entrance with bowed head, as though deep in thought. Basilio\r\nfelt his heart beat fainter, his feet and hands turn cold, while the\r\nblack silhouette of the jeweler assumed fantastic shapes enveloped in\r\nflames. There at the foot of the stairway Simoun checked his steps, as\r\nif in doubt, and Basilio held his breath. But the hesitation was\r\ntransient—Simoun raised his head, resolutely ascended the stairway, and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nIt then seemed to the student that the house was going to blow up at\r\nany moment, and that walls, lamps, guests, roof, windows, orchestra,\r\nwould be hurtling through the air like a handful of coals in the midst\r\nof an infernal explosion. He gazed about him and fancied that he saw\r\ncorpses in place of idle spectators, he saw them torn to shreds, it\r\nseemed to him that the air was filled with flames, but his calmer self\r\ntriumphed over this transient hallucination, which was due somewhat to\r\nhis hunger.\r\n\r\n“Until he comes out, there’s no danger,” he said to himself. “The\r\nCaptain-General hasn’t arrived yet.”\r\n\r\nHe tried to appear calm and control the convulsive trembling in his\r\nlimbs, endeavoring to divert his thoughts to other things. Something\r\nwithin was ridiculing him, saying, “If you tremble now, before the\r\nsupreme moment, how will you conduct yourself when you see blood\r\nflowing, houses burning, and bullets whistling?”\r\n\r\nHis Excellency arrived, but the young man paid no attention to him. He\r\nwas watching the face of Simoun, who was among those that descended to\r\nreceive him, and he read in that implacable countenance the sentence of\r\ndeath for all those men, so that fresh terror seized upon him. He felt\r\ncold, he leaned against the wall, and, with his eyes fixed on the\r\nwindows and his ears cocked, tried to guess what might be happening. In\r\nthe sala he saw the crowd surround Simoun to look at the lamp, he heard\r\ncongratulations and exclamations of admiration—the words “dining-room,”\r\n“novelty,” were repeated many times—he saw the General smile and\r\nconjectured that the novelty was to be exhibited that very night, by\r\nthe jeweler’s arrangement, on the table whereat his Excellency was to\r\ndine. Simoun disappeared, followed by a crowd of admirers.\r\n\r\nAt that supreme moment his good angel triumphed, he forgot his hatreds,\r\nhe forgot Juli, he wanted to save the innocent. Come what might, he\r\nwould cross the street and try to enter. But Basilio had forgotten that\r\nhe was miserably dressed. The porter stopped him and accosted him\r\nroughly, and finally, upon his insisting, threatened to call the\r\npolice.\r\n\r\nJust then Simoun came down, slightly pale, and the porter turned from\r\nBasilio to salute the jeweler as though he had been a saint passing.\r\nBasilio realized from the expression of Simoun’s face that he was\r\nleaving the fated house forever, that the lamp was lighted. Alea jacta\r\nest! Seized by the instinct of self-preservation, he thought then of\r\nsaving himself. It might occur to any of the guests through curiosity\r\nto tamper with the wick and then would come the explosion to overwhelm\r\nthem all. Still he heard Simoun say to the cochero, “The Escolta,\r\nhurry!”\r\n\r\nTerrified, dreading that he might at any moment hear the awful\r\nexplosion, Basilio hurried as fast as his legs would carry him to get\r\naway from the accursed spot, but his legs seemed to lack the necessary\r\nagility, his feet slipped on the sidewalk as though they were moving\r\nbut not advancing. The people he met blocked the way, and before he had\r\ngone twenty steps he thought that at least five minutes had elapsed.\r\n\r\nSome distance away he stumbled against a young man who was standing\r\nwith his head thrown back, gazing fixedly at the house, and in him he\r\nrecognized Isagani. “What are you doing here?” he demanded. “Come\r\naway!”\r\n\r\nIsagani stared at him vaguely, smiled sadly, and again turned his gaze\r\ntoward the open balconies, across which was revealed the ethereal\r\nsilhouette of the bride clinging to the groom’s arm as they moved\r\nslowly out of sight.\r\n\r\n“Come, Isagani, let’s get away from that house. Come!” Basilio urged in\r\na hoarse voice, catching his friend by the arm.\r\n\r\nIsagani gently shook himself free and continued to stare with the same\r\nsad smile upon his lips.\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, let’s get away from here!”\r\n\r\n“Why should I go away? Tomorrow it will not be she.”\r\n\r\nThere was so much sorrow in those words that Basilio for a moment\r\nforgot his own terror. “Do you want to die?” he demanded.\r\n\r\nIsagani shrugged his shoulders and continued to gaze toward the house.\r\n\r\nBasilio again tried to drag him away. “Isagani, Isagani, listen to me!\r\nLet’s not waste any time! That house is mined, it’s going to blow up at\r\nany moment, by the least imprudent act, the least curiosity! Isagani,\r\nall will perish in its ruins.”\r\n\r\n“In its ruins?” echoed Isagani, as if trying to understand, but without\r\nremoving his gaze from the window.\r\n\r\n“Yes, in its ruins, yes, Isagani! For God’s sake, come! I’ll explain\r\nafterwards. Come! One who has been more unfortunate than either you or\r\nI has doomed them all. Do you see that white, clear light, like an\r\nelectric lamp, shining from the azotea? It’s the light of death! A lamp\r\ncharged with dynamite, in a mined dining-room, will burst and not a rat\r\nwill escape alive. Come!”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Isagani, shaking his head sadly. “I want to stay here, I\r\nwant to see her for the last time. Tomorrow, you see, she will be\r\nsomething different.”\r\n\r\n“Let fate have its way!” Basilio then exclaimed, hurrying away.\r\n\r\nIsagani watched his friend rush away with a precipitation that\r\nindicated real terror, but continued to stare toward the charmed\r\nwindow, like the cavalier of Toggenburg waiting for his sweetheart to\r\nappear, as Schiller tells. Now the sala was deserted, all having\r\nrepaired to the dining-rooms, and it occurred to Isagani that Basilio’s\r\nfears may have been well-founded. He recalled the terrified countenance\r\nof him who was always so calm and composed, and it set him to thinking.\r\n\r\nSuddenly an idea appeared clear in his imagination—the house was going\r\nto blow up and Paulita was there, Paulita was going to die a frightful\r\ndeath. In the presence of this idea everything was forgotten: jealousy,\r\nsuffering, mental torture, and the generous youth thought only of his\r\nlove. Without reflecting, without hesitation, he ran toward the house,\r\nand thanks to his stylish clothes and determined mien, easily secured\r\nadmittance.\r\n\r\nWhile these short scenes were occurring in the street, in the\r\ndining-kiosk of the greater gods there was passed from hand to hand a\r\npiece of parchment on which were written in red ink these fateful\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\r\n        Mene, Tekel, Phares [72]\r\n        Juan Crisostomo Ibarra\r\n\r\n\r\n“Juan Crisostomo Ibarra? Who is he?” asked his Excellency, handing the\r\npaper to his neighbor.\r\n\r\n“A joke in very bad taste!” exclaimed Don Custodio. “To sign the name\r\nof a filibuster dead more than ten years!”\r\n\r\n“A filibuster!”\r\n\r\n“It’s a seditious joke!”\r\n\r\n“There being ladies present—”\r\n\r\nPadre Irene looked around for the joker and saw Padre Salvi, who was\r\nseated at the right of the Countess, turn as white as his napkin, while\r\nhe stared at the mysterious words with bulging eyes. The scene of the\r\nsphinx recurred to him.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter, Padre Salvi?” he asked. “Do you recognize your\r\nfriend’s signature?”\r\n\r\nPadre Salvi did not reply. He made an effort to speak and without being\r\nconscious of what he was doing wiped his forehead with his napkin.\r\n\r\n“What has happened to your Reverence?”\r\n\r\n“It is his very handwriting!” was the whispered reply in a scarcely\r\nperceptible voice. “It’s the very handwriting of Ibarra.” Leaning\r\nagainst the back of his chair, he let his arms fall as though all\r\nstrength had deserted him.\r\n\r\nUneasiness became converted into fright, they all stared at one another\r\nwithout uttering a single word. His Excellency started to rise, but\r\napprehending that such a move would be ascribed to fear, controlled\r\nhimself and looked about him. There were no soldiers present, even the\r\nwaiters were unknown to him.\r\n\r\n“Let’s go on eating, gentlemen,” he exclaimed, “and pay no attention to\r\nthe joke.” But his voice, instead of reassuring, increased the general\r\nuneasiness, for it trembled.\r\n\r\n“I don’t suppose that that Mene, Tekel, Phares, means that we’re to be\r\nassassinated tonight?” speculated Don Custodio.\r\n\r\nAll remained motionless, but when he added, “Yet they might poison us,”\r\nthey leaped up from their chairs.\r\n\r\nThe light, meanwhile, had begun slowly to fade. “The lamp is going\r\nout,” observed the General uneasily. “Will you turn up the wick, Padre\r\nIrene?”\r\n\r\nBut at that instant, with the swiftness of a flash of lightning, a\r\nfigure rushed in, overturning a chair and knocking a servant down, and\r\nin the midst of the general surprise seized the lamp, rushed to the\r\nazotea, and threw it into the river. The whole thing happened in a\r\nsecond and the dining-kiosk was left in darkness.\r\n\r\nThe lamp had already struck the water before the servants could cry\r\nout, “Thief, thief!” and rush toward the azotea. “A revolver!” cried\r\none of them. “A revolver, quick! After the thief!”\r\n\r\nBut the figure, more agile than they, had already mounted the\r\nbalustrade and before a light could be brought, precipitated itself\r\ninto the river, striking the water with a loud splash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nBEN-ZAYB’S AFFLICTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately upon hearing of the incident, after lights had been brought\r\nand the scarcely dignified attitudes of the startled gods revealed,\r\nBen-Zayb, filled with holy indignation, and with the approval of the\r\npress-censor secured beforehand, hastened home—an entresol where he\r\nlived in a mess with others—to write an article that would be the\r\nsublimest ever penned under the skies of the Philippines. The\r\nCaptain-General would leave disconsolate if he did not first enjoy his\r\ndithyrambs, and this Ben-Zayb, in his kindness of heart, could not\r\nallow. Hence he sacrificed the dinner and ball, nor did he sleep that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nSonorous exclamations of horror, of indignation, to fancy that the\r\nworld was smashing to pieces and the stars, the eternal stars, were\r\nclashing together! Then a mysterious introduction, filled with\r\nallusions, veiled hints, then an account of the affair, and the final\r\nperoration. He multiplied the flourishes and exhausted all his\r\neuphemisms in describing the drooping shoulders and the tardy baptism\r\nof salad his Excellency had received on his Olympian brow, he eulogized\r\nthe agility with which the General had recovered a vertical position,\r\nplacing his head where his legs had been, and vice versa, then intoned\r\na hymn to Providence for having so solicitously guarded those sacred\r\nbones. The paragraph turned out to be so perfect that his Excellency\r\nappeared as a hero, and fell higher, as Victor Hugo said.\r\n\r\nHe wrote, erased, added, and polished, so that, without wanting in\r\nveracity—this was his special merit as a journalist—the whole would be\r\nan epic, grand for the seven gods, cowardly and base for the unknown\r\nthief, “who had executed himself, terror-stricken, and in the very act\r\nconvinced of the enormity of his crime.”\r\n\r\nHe explained Padre Irene’s act of plunging under the table as “an\r\nimpulse of innate valor, which the habit of a God of peace and\r\ngentleness, worn throughout a whole life, had been unable to\r\nextinguish,” for Padre Irene had tried to hurl himself upon the thief\r\nand had taken a straight course along the submensal route. In passing,\r\nhe spoke of submarine passages, mentioned a project of Don Custodio’s,\r\ncalled attention to the liberal education and wide travels of the\r\npriest. Padre Salvi’s swoon was the excessive sorrow that took\r\npossession of the virtuous Franciscan to see the little fruit borne\r\namong the Indians by his pious sermons, while the immobility and fright\r\nof the other guests, among them the Countess, who “sustained” Padre\r\nSalvi (she grabbed him), were the serenity and sang-froid of heroes,\r\ninured to danger in the performance of their duties, beside whom the\r\nRoman senators surprised by the Gallic invaders were nervous\r\nschoolgirls frightened at painted cockroaches.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, to form a contrast, the picture of the thief: fear,\r\nmadness, confusion, the fierce look, the distorted features, and—force\r\nof moral superiority in the race—his religious awe to see assembled\r\nthere such august personages! Here came in opportunely a long\r\nimprecation, a harangue, a diatribe against the perversion of good\r\ncustoms, hence the necessity of a permanent military tribunal, “a\r\ndeclaration of martial law within the limits already so declared,\r\nspecial legislation, energetic and repressive, because it is in every\r\nway needful, it is of imperative importance to impress upon the\r\nmalefactors and criminals that if the heart is generous and paternal\r\nfor those who are submissive and obedient to the law, the hand is\r\nstrong, firm, inexorable, hard, and severe for those who against all\r\nreason fail to respect it and who insult the sacred institutions of the\r\nfatherland. Yes, gentlemen, this is demanded not only for the welfare\r\nof these islands, not only for the welfare of all mankind, but also in\r\nthe name of Spain, the honor of the Spanish name, the prestige of the\r\nIberian people, because before all things else Spaniards we are, and\r\nthe flag of Spain,” etc.\r\n\r\nHe terminated the article with this farewell: “Go in peace, gallant\r\nwarrior, you who with expert hand have guided the destinies of this\r\ncountry in such calamitous times! Go in peace to breathe the balmy\r\nbreezes of Manzanares! [73] We shall remain here like faithful\r\nsentinels to venerate your memory, to admire your wise dispositions, to\r\navenge the infamous attempt upon your splendid gift, which we will\r\nrecover even if we have to dry up the seas! Such a precious relic will\r\nbe for this country an eternal monument to your splendor, your presence\r\nof mind, your gallantry!”\r\n\r\nIn this rather confused way he concluded the article and before dawn\r\nsent it to the printing-office, of course with the censor’s permit.\r\nThen he went to sleep like Napoleon, after he had arranged the plan for\r\nthe battle of Jena.\r\n\r\nBut at dawn he was awakened to have the sheets of copy returned with a\r\nnote from the editor saying that his Excellency had positively and\r\nseverely forbidden any mention of the affair, and had further ordered\r\nthe denial of any versions and comments that might get abroad,\r\ndiscrediting them as exaggerated rumors.\r\n\r\nTo Ben-Zayb this blow was the murder of a beautiful and sturdy child,\r\nborn and nurtured with such great pain and fatigue. Where now hurl the\r\nCatilinarian pride, the splendid exhibition of warlike crime-avenging\r\nmaterials? And to think that within a month or two he was going to\r\nleave the Philippines, and the article could not be published in Spain,\r\nsince how could he say those things about the criminals of Madrid,\r\nwhere other ideas prevailed, where extenuating circumstances were\r\nsought, where facts were weighed, where there were juries, and so on?\r\nArticles such as his were like certain poisonous rums that are\r\nmanufactured in Europe, good enough to be sold among the negroes, good\r\nfor negroes, [74] with the difference that if the negroes did not drink\r\nthem they would not be destroyed, while Ben-Zayb’s articles, whether\r\nthe Filipinos read them or not, had their effect.\r\n\r\n“If only some other crime might be committed today or tomorrow,” he\r\nmused.\r\n\r\nWith the thought of that child dead before seeing the light, those\r\nfrozen buds, and feeling his eyes fill with tears, he dressed himself\r\nto call upon the editor. But the editor shrugged his shoulders; his\r\nExcellency had forbidden it because if it should be divulged that seven\r\nof the greater gods had let themselves be surprised and robbed by a\r\nnobody, while they brandished knives and forks, that would endanger the\r\nintegrity of the fatherland! So he had ordered that no search be made\r\nfor the lamp or the thief, and had recommended to his successors that\r\nthey should not run the risk of dining in any private house, without\r\nbeing surrounded by halberdiers and guards. As those who knew anything\r\nabout the events that night in Don Timoteo’s house were for the most\r\npart military officials and government employees, it was not difficult\r\nto suppress the affair in public, for it concerned the integrity of the\r\nfatherland. Before this name Ben-Zayb bowed his head heroically,\r\nthinking about Abraham, Guzman El Bueno, [75] or at least, Brutus and\r\nother heroes of antiquity.\r\n\r\nSuch a sacrifice could not remain unrewarded, the gods of journalism\r\nbeing pleased with Abraham Ben-Zayb. Almost upon the hour came the\r\nreporting angel bearing the sacrificial lamb in the shape of an assault\r\ncommitted at a country-house on the Pasig, where certain friars were\r\nspending the heated season. Here was his opportunity and Ben-Zayb\r\npraised his gods.\r\n\r\n“The robbers got over two thousand pesos, leaving badly wounded one\r\nfriar and two servants. The curate defended himself as well as he could\r\nbehind a chair, which was smashed in his hands.”\r\n\r\n“Wait, wait!” said Ben-Zayb, taking notes. “Forty or fifty outlaws\r\ntraitorously—revolvers, bolos, shotguns, pistols—lion at\r\nbay—chair—splinters flying—barbarously wounded—ten thousand pesos!”\r\n\r\nSo great was his enthusiasm that he was not content with mere reports,\r\nbut proceeded in person to the scene of the crime, composing on the\r\nroad a Homeric description of the fight. A harangue in the mouth of the\r\nleader? A scornful defiance on the part of the priest? All the\r\nmetaphors and similes applied to his Excellency, Padre Irene, and Padre\r\nSalvi would exactly fit the wounded friar and the description of the\r\nthief would serve for each of the outlaws. The imprecation could be\r\nexpanded, since he could talk of religion, of the faith, of charity, of\r\nthe ringing of bells, of what the Indians owed to the friars, he could\r\nget sentimental and melt into Castelarian [76] epigrams and lyric\r\nperiods. The señoritas of the city would read the article and murmur,\r\n“Ben-Zayb, bold as a lion and tender as a lamb!”\r\n\r\nBut when he reached the scene, to his great astonishment he learned\r\nthat the wounded friar was no other than Padre Camorra, sentenced by\r\nhis Provincial to expiate in the pleasant country-house on the banks of\r\nthe Pasig his pranks in Tiani. He had a slight scratch on his hand and\r\na bruise on his head received from flattening himself out on the floor.\r\nThe robbers numbered three or four, armed only with bolos, the sum\r\nstolen fifty pesos!\r\n\r\n“It won’t do!” exclaimed Ben-Zayb. “Shut up! You don’t know what you’re\r\ntalking about.”\r\n\r\n“How don’t I know, puñales?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be a fool—the robbers must have numbered more.”\r\n\r\n“You ink-slinger—”\r\n\r\nSo they had quite an altercation. What chiefly concerned Ben-Zayb was\r\nnot to throw away the article, to give importance to the affair, so\r\nthat he could use the peroration.\r\n\r\nBut a fearful rumor cut short their dispute. The robbers caught had\r\nmade some important revelations. One of the outlaws under Matanglawin\r\n(Cabesang Tales) had made an appointment with them to join his band in\r\nSanta Mesa, thence to sack the conventos and houses of the wealthy.\r\nThey would be guided by a Spaniard, tall and sunburnt, with white hair,\r\nwho said that he was acting under the orders of the General, whose\r\ngreat friend he was, and they had been further assured that the\r\nartillery and various regiments would join them, wherefore they were to\r\nentertain no fear at all. The tulisanes would be pardoned and have a\r\nthird part of the booty assigned to them. The signal was to have been a\r\ncannon-shot, but having waited for it in vain the tulisanes, thinking\r\nthemselves deceived, separated, some going back to their homes, some\r\nreturning to the mountains vowing vengeance on the Spaniard, who had\r\nthus failed twice to keep his word. Then they, the robbers caught, had\r\ndecided to do something on their own account, attacking the\r\ncountry-house that they found closest at hand, resolving religiously to\r\ngive two-thirds of the booty to the Spaniard with white hair, if\r\nperchance he should call upon them for it.\r\n\r\nThe description being recognized as that of Simoun, the declaration was\r\nreceived as an absurdity and the robber subjected to all kinds of\r\ntortures, including the electric machine, for his impious blasphemy.\r\nBut news of the disappearance of the jeweler having attracted the\r\nattention of the whole Escolta, and the sacks of powder and great\r\nquantities of cartridges having been discovered in his house, the story\r\nbegan to wear an appearance of truth. Mystery began to enwrap the\r\naffair, enveloping it in clouds; there were whispered conversations,\r\ncoughs, suspicious looks, suggestive comments, and trite second-hand\r\nremarks. Those who were on the inside were unable to get over their\r\nastonishment, they put on long faces, turned pale, and but little was\r\nwanting for many persons to lose their minds in realizing certain\r\nthings that had before passed unnoticed.\r\n\r\n“We’ve had a narrow escape! Who would have said—”\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Ben-Zayb, his pockets filled with revolvers and\r\ncartridges, went to see Don Custodio, whom he found hard at work over a\r\nproject against American jewelers. In a hushed voice he whispered\r\nbetween the palms of his hands into the journalist’s ear mysterious\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n“Really?” questioned Ben-Zayb, slapping his hand on his pocket and\r\npaling visibly.\r\n\r\n“Wherever he may be found—” The sentence was completed with an\r\nexpressive pantomime. Don Custodio raised both arms to the height of\r\nhis face, with the right more bent than the left, turned the palms of\r\nhis hands toward the floor, closed one eye, and made two movements in\r\nadvance. “Ssh! Ssh!” he hissed.\r\n\r\n“And the diamonds?” inquired Ben-Zayb.\r\n\r\n“If they find him—” He went through another pantomime with the fingers\r\nof his right hand, spreading them out and clenching them together like\r\nthe closing of a fan, clutching out with them somewhat in the manner of\r\nthe wings of a wind-mill sweeping imaginary objects toward itself with\r\npractised skill. Ben-Zayb responded with another pantomime, opening his\r\neyes wide, arching his eyebrows and sucking in his breath eagerly as\r\nthough nutritious air had just been discovered.\r\n\r\n“Sssh!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY\r\n\r\n                                                           Todo se sabe\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding so many precautions, rumors reached the public, even\r\nthough quite changed and mutilated. On the following night they were\r\nthe theme of comment in the house of Orenda, a rich jewel merchant in\r\nthe industrious district of Santa Cruz, and the numerous friends of the\r\nfamily gave attention to nothing else. They were not indulging in\r\ncards, or playing the piano, while little Tinay, the youngest of the\r\ngirls, became bored playing chongka by herself, without being able to\r\nunderstand the interest awakened by assaults, conspiracies, and sacks\r\nof powder, when there were in the seven holes so many beautiful cowries\r\nthat seemed to be winking at her in unison and smiled with their tiny\r\nmouths half-opened, begging to be carried up to the home. Even Isagani,\r\nwho, when he came, always used to play with her and allow himself to be\r\nbeautifully cheated, did not come at her call, for Isagani was gloomily\r\nand silently listening to something Chichoy the silversmith was\r\nrelating. Momoy, the betrothed of Sensia, the eldest of the daughters—a\r\npretty and vivacious girl, rather given to joking—had left the window\r\nwhere he was accustomed to spend his evenings in amorous discourse, and\r\nthis action seemed to be very annoying to the lory whose cage hung from\r\nthe eaves there, the lory endeared to the house from its ability to\r\ngreet everybody in the morning with marvelous phrases of love. Capitana\r\nLoleng, the energetic and intelligent Capitana Loleng, had her\r\naccount-book open before her, but she neither read nor wrote in it, nor\r\nwas her attention fixed on the trays of loose pearls, nor on the\r\ndiamonds—she had completely forgotten herself and was all ears. Her\r\nhusband himself, the great Capitan Toringoy,—a transformation of the\r\nname Domingo,—the happiest man in the district, without other\r\noccupation than to dress well, eat, loaf, and gossip, while his whole\r\nfamily worked and toiled, had not gone to join his coterie, but was\r\nlistening between fear and emotion to the hair-raising news of the lank\r\nChichoy.\r\n\r\nNor was reason for all this lacking. Chichoy had gone to deliver some\r\nwork for Don Timoteo Pelaez, a pair of earrings for the bride, at the\r\nvery time when they were tearing down the kiosk that on the previous\r\nnight had served as a dining-room for the foremost officials. Here\r\nChichoy turned pale and his hair stood on end.\r\n\r\n“Nakú!” he exclaimed, “sacks and sacks of powder, sacks of powder under\r\nthe floor, in the roof, under the table, under the chairs, everywhere!\r\nIt’s lucky none of the workmen were smoking.”\r\n\r\n“Who put those sacks of powder there?” asked Capitana Loleng, who was\r\nbrave and did not turn pale, as did the enamored Momoy. But Momoy had\r\nattended the wedding, so his posthumous emotion can be appreciated: he\r\nhad been near the kiosk.\r\n\r\n“That’s what no one can explain,” replied Chichoy. “Who would have any\r\ninterest in breaking up the fiesta? There couldn’t have been more than\r\none, as the celebrated lawyer Señor Pasta who was there on a visit\r\ndeclared—either an enemy of Don Timoteo’s or a rival of Juanito’s.”\r\n\r\nThe Orenda girls turned instinctively toward Isagani, who smiled\r\nsilently.\r\n\r\n“Hide yourself,” Capitana Loleng advised him. “They may accuse you.\r\nHide!”\r\n\r\nAgain Isagani smiled but said nothing.\r\n\r\n“Don Timoteo,” continued Chichoy, “did not know to whom to attribute\r\nthe deed. He himself superintended the work, he and his friend Simoun,\r\nand nobody else. The house was thrown into an uproar, the lieutenant of\r\nthe guard came, and after enjoining secrecy upon everybody, they sent\r\nme away. But—”\r\n\r\n“But—but—” stammered the trembling Momoy.\r\n\r\n“Nakú!” ejaculated Sensia, gazing at her fiancé and trembling\r\nsympathetically to remember that he had been at the fiesta. “This young\r\nman—If the house had blown up—” She stared at her sweetheart\r\npassionately and admired his courage.\r\n\r\n“If it had blown up—”\r\n\r\n“No one in the whole of Calle Anloague would have been left alive,”\r\nconcluded Capitan Toringoy, feigning valor and indifference in the\r\npresence of his family.\r\n\r\n“I left in consternation,” resumed Chichoy, “thinking about how, if a\r\nmere spark, a cigarette had fallen, if a lamp had been overturned, at\r\nthe present moment we should have neither a General, nor an Archbishop,\r\nnor any one, not even a government clerk! All who were at the fiesta\r\nlast night—annihilated!”\r\n\r\n“Vírgen Santísima! This young man—”\r\n\r\n“’Susmariosep!” exclaimed Capitana Loleng. “All our debtors were there,\r\n’Susmariosep! And we have a house near there! Who could it have been?”\r\n\r\n“Now you may know about it,” added Chichoy in a whisper, “but you must\r\nkeep it a secret. This afternoon I met a friend, a clerk in an office,\r\nand in talking about the affair, he gave me the clue to the mystery—he\r\nhad it from some government employees. Who do you suppose put the sacks\r\nof powder there?”\r\n\r\nMany shrugged their shoulders, while Capitan Toringoy merely looked\r\naskance at Isagani.\r\n\r\n“The friars?”\r\n\r\n“Quiroga the Chinaman?”\r\n\r\n“Some student?”\r\n\r\n“Makaraig?”\r\n\r\nCapitan Toringoy coughed and glanced at Isagani, while Chichoy shook\r\nhis head and smiled.\r\n\r\n“The jeweler Simoun.”\r\n\r\n“Simoun!!”\r\n\r\nThe profound silence of amazement followed these words. Simoun, the\r\nevil genius of the Captain-General, the rich trader to whose house they\r\nhad gone to buy unset gems, Simoun, who had received the Orenda girls\r\nwith great courtesy and had paid them fine compliments! For the very\r\nreason that the story seemed absurd it was believed. “Credo quia\r\nabsurdum,” said St. Augustine.\r\n\r\n“But wasn’t Simoun at the fiesta last night?” asked Sensia.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Momoy. “But now I remember! He left the house just as we\r\nwere sitting down to the dinner. He went to get his wedding-gift.”\r\n\r\n“But wasn’t he a friend of the General’s? Wasn’t he a partner of Don\r\nTimoteo’s?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he made himself a partner in order to strike the blow and kill\r\nall the Spaniards.”\r\n\r\n“Aha!” cried Sensia. “Now I understand!”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t want to believe Aunt Tentay. Simoun is the devil and he has\r\nbought up the souls of all the Spaniards. Aunt Tentay said so!”\r\n\r\nCapitana Loleng crossed herself and looked uneasily toward the jewels,\r\nfearing to see them turn into live coals, while Capitan Toringoy took\r\noff the ring which had come from Simoun.\r\n\r\n“Simoun has disappeared without leaving any traces,” added Chichoy.\r\n“The Civil Guard is searching for him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” observed Sensia, crossing herself, “searching for the devil.”\r\n\r\nNow many things were explained: Simoun’s fabulous wealth and the\r\npeculiar smell in his house, the smell of sulphur. Binday, another of\r\nthe daughters, a frank and lovely girl, remembered having seen blue\r\nflames in the jeweler’s house one afternoon when she and her mother had\r\ngone there to buy jewels. Isagani listened attentively, but said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n“So, last night—” ventured Momoy.\r\n\r\n“Last night?” echoed Sensia, between curiosity and fear.\r\n\r\nMomoy hesitated, but the face Sensia put on banished his fear. “Last\r\nnight, while we were eating, there was a disturbance, the light in the\r\nGeneral’s dining-room went out. They say that some unknown person stole\r\nthe lamp that was presented by Simoun.”\r\n\r\n“A thief? One of the Black Hand?”\r\n\r\nIsagani arose to walk back and forth.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t they catch him?”\r\n\r\n“He jumped into the river before anybody recognized him. Some say he\r\nwas a Spaniard, some a Chinaman, and others an Indian.”\r\n\r\n“It’s believed that with the lamp,” added Chichoy, “he was going to set\r\nfire to the house, then the powder—”\r\n\r\nMomoy again shuddered but noticing that Sensia was watching him tried\r\nto control himself. “What a pity!” he exclaimed with an effort. “How\r\nwickedly the thief acted. Everybody would have been killed.”\r\n\r\nSensia stared at him in fright, the women crossed themselves, while\r\nCapitan Toringoy, who was afraid of politics, made a move to go away.\r\n\r\nMomoy turned to Isagani, who observed with an enigmatic smile: “It’s\r\nalways wicked to take what doesn’t belong to you. If that thief had\r\nknown what it was all about and had been able to reflect, surely he\r\nwouldn’t have done as he did.”\r\n\r\nThen, after a pause, he added, “For nothing in the world would I want\r\nto be in his place!”\r\n\r\nSo they continued their comments and conjectures until an hour later,\r\nwhen Isagani bade the family farewell, to return forever to his uncle’s\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nFATALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nMatanglawin was the terror of Luzon. His band had as lief appear in one\r\nprovince where it was least expected as make a descent upon another\r\nthat was preparing to resist it. It burned a sugar-mill in Batangas and\r\ndestroyed the crops, on the following day it murdered the Justice of\r\nthe Peace of Tiani, and on the next took possession of the town of\r\nCavite, carrying off the arms from the town hall. The central\r\nprovinces, from Tayabas to Pangasinan, suffered from his depredations,\r\nand his bloody name extended from Albay in the south to Kagayan in the\r\nnorth. The towns, disarmed through mistrust on the part of a weak\r\ngovernment, fell easy prey into his hands—at his approach the fields\r\nwere abandoned by the farmers, the herds were scattered, while a trail\r\nof blood and fire marked his passage. Matanglawin laughed at the severe\r\nmeasures ordered by the government against the tulisanes, since from\r\nthem only the people in the outlying villages suffered, being captured\r\nand maltreated if they resisted the band, and if they made peace with\r\nit being flogged and deported by the government, provided they\r\ncompleted the journey and did not meet with a fatal accident on the\r\nway. Thanks to these terrible alternatives many of the country folk\r\ndecided to enlist under his command.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this reign of terror, trade among the towns, already\r\nlanguishing, died out completely. The rich dared not travel, and the\r\npoor feared to be arrested by the Civil Guard, which, being under\r\nobligation to pursue the tulisanes, often seized the first person\r\nencountered and subjected him to unspeakable tortures. In its\r\nimpotence, the government put on a show of energy toward the persons\r\nwhom it suspected, in order that by force of cruelty the people should\r\nnot realize its weakness—the fear that prompted such measures.\r\n\r\nA string of these hapless suspects, some six or seven, with their arms\r\ntied behind them, bound together like a bunch of human meat, was one\r\nafternoon marching through the excessive heat along a road that skirted\r\na mountain, escorted by ten or twelve guards armed with rifles. Their\r\nbayonets gleamed in the sun, the barrels of their rifles became hot,\r\nand even the sage-leaves in their helmets scarcely served to temper the\r\neffect of the deadly May sun.\r\n\r\nDeprived of the use of their arms and pressed close against one another\r\nto save rope, the prisoners moved along almost uncovered and unshod, he\r\nbeing the best off who had a handkerchief twisted around his head.\r\nPanting, suffering, covered with dust which perspiration converted into\r\nmud, they felt their brains melting, they saw lights dancing before\r\nthem, red spots floating in the air. Exhaustion and dejection were\r\npictured in their faces, desperation, wrath, something indescribable,\r\nthe look of one who dies cursing, of a man who is weary of life, who\r\nhates himself, who blasphemes against God. The strongest lowered their\r\nheads to rub their faces against the dusky backs of those in front of\r\nthem and thus wipe away the sweat that was blinding them. Many were\r\nlimping, but if any one of them happened to fall and thus delay the\r\nmarch he would hear a curse as a soldier ran up brandishing a branch\r\ntorn from a tree and forced him to rise by striking about in all\r\ndirections. The string then started to run, dragging, rolling in the\r\ndust, the fallen one, who howled and begged to be killed; but perchance\r\nhe succeeded in getting on his feet and then went along crying like a\r\nchild and cursing the hour he was born.\r\n\r\nThe human cluster halted at times while the guards drank, and then the\r\nprisoners continued on their way with parched mouths, darkened brains,\r\nand hearts full of curses. Thirst was for these wretches the least of\r\ntheir troubles.\r\n\r\n“Move on, you sons of ——!” cried a soldier, again refreshed, hurling\r\nthe insult common among the lower classes of Filipinos.\r\n\r\nThe branch whistled and fell on any shoulder whatsoever, the nearest\r\none, or at times upon a face to leave a welt at first white, then red,\r\nand later dirty with the dust of the road.\r\n\r\n“Move on, you cowards!” at times a voice yelled in Spanish, deepening\r\nits tone.\r\n\r\n“Cowards!” repeated the mountain echoes.\r\n\r\nThen the cowards quickened their pace under a sky of red-hot iron, over\r\na burning road, lashed by the knotty branch which was worn into shreds\r\non their livid skins. A Siberian winter would perhaps be tenderer than\r\nthe May sun of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nYet, among the soldiers there was one who looked with disapproving eyes\r\nupon so much wanton cruelty, as he marched along silently with his\r\nbrows knit in disgust. At length, seeing that the guard, not satisfied\r\nwith the branch, was kicking the prisoners that fell, he could no\r\nlonger restrain himself but cried out impatiently, “Here, Mautang, let\r\nthem alone!”\r\n\r\nMautang turned toward him in surprise. “What’s it to you, Carolino?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“To me, nothing, but it hurts me,” replied Carolino. “They’re men like\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\n“It’s plain that you’re new to the business!” retorted Mautang with a\r\ncompassionate smile. “How did you treat the prisoners in the war?”\r\n\r\n“With more consideration, surely!” answered Carolino.\r\n\r\nMautang remained silent for a moment and then, apparently having\r\ndiscovered the reason, calmly rejoined, “Ah, it’s because they are\r\nenemies and fight us, while these—these are our own countrymen.”\r\n\r\nThen drawing nearer to Carolino he whispered, “How stupid you are!\r\nThey’re treated so in order that they may attempt to resist or to\r\nescape, and then—bang!”\r\n\r\nCarolino made no reply.\r\n\r\nOne of the prisoners then begged that they let him stop for a moment.\r\n\r\n“This is a dangerous place,” answered the corporal, gazing uneasily\r\ntoward the mountain. “Move on!”\r\n\r\n“Move on!” echoed Mautang and his lash whistled.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner twisted himself around to stare at him with reproachful\r\neyes. “You are more cruel than the Spaniard himself,” he said.\r\n\r\nMautang replied with more blows, when suddenly a bullet whistled,\r\nfollowed by a loud report. Mautang dropped his rifle, uttered an oath,\r\nand clutching at his breast with both hands fell spinning into a heap.\r\nThe prisoner saw him writhing in the dust with blood spurting from his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n“Halt!” called the corporal, suddenly turning pale.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers stopped and stared about them. A wisp of smoke rose from a\r\nthicket on the height above. Another bullet sang to its accompanying\r\nreport and the corporal, wounded in the thigh, doubled over vomiting\r\ncurses. The column was attacked by men hidden among the rocks above.\r\n\r\nSullen with rage the corporal motioned toward the string of prisoners\r\nand laconically ordered, “Fire!”\r\n\r\nThe wretches fell upon their knees, filled with consternation. As they\r\ncould not lift their hands, they begged for mercy by kissing the dust\r\nor bowing their heads—one talked of his children, another of his mother\r\nwho would be left unprotected, one promised money, another called upon\r\nGod—but the muzzles were quickly lowered and a hideous volley silenced\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nThen began the sharpshooting against those who were behind the rocks\r\nabove, over which a light cloud of smoke began to hover. To judge from\r\nthe scarcity of their shots, the invisible enemies could not have more\r\nthan three rifles. As they advanced firing, the guards sought cover\r\nbehind tree-trunks or crouched down as they attempted to scale the\r\nheight. Splintered rocks leaped up, broken twigs fell from trees,\r\npatches of earth were torn up, and the first guard who attempted the\r\nascent rolled back with a bullet through his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe hidden enemy had the advantage of position, but the valiant guards,\r\nwho did not know how to flee, were on the point of retiring, for they\r\nhad paused, unwilling to advance; that fight against the invisible\r\nunnerved them. Smoke and rocks alone could be seen—not a voice was\r\nheard, not a shadow appeared; they seemed to be fighting with the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\n“Shoot, Carolino! What are you aiming at?” called the corporal.\r\n\r\nAt that instant a man appeared upon a rock, making signs with his\r\nrifle.\r\n\r\n“Shoot him!” ordered the corporal with a foul oath.\r\n\r\nThree guards obeyed the order, but the man continued standing there,\r\ncalling out at the top of his voice something unintelligible.\r\n\r\nCarolino paused, thinking that he recognized something familiar about\r\nthat figure, which stood out plainly in the sunlight. But the corporal\r\nthreatened to tie him up if he did not fire, so Carolino took aim and\r\nthe report of his rifle was heard. The man on the rock spun around and\r\ndisappeared with a cry that left Carolino horror-stricken.\r\n\r\nThen followed a rustling in the bushes, indicating that those within\r\nwere scattering in all directions, so the soldiers boldly advanced, now\r\nthat there was no more resistance. Another man appeared upon the rock,\r\nwaving a spear, and they fired at him. He sank down slowly, catching at\r\nthe branch of a tree, but with another volley fell face downwards on\r\nthe rock.\r\n\r\nThe guards climbed on nimbly, with bayonets fixed ready for a\r\nhand-to-hand fight. Carolino alone moved forward reluctantly, with a\r\nwandering, gloomy look, the cry of the man struck by his bullet still\r\nringing in his ears. The first to reach the spot found an old man\r\ndying, stretched out on the rock. He plunged his bayonet into the body,\r\nbut the old man did not even wink, his eyes being fixed on Carolino\r\nwith an indescribable gaze, while with his bony hand he pointed to\r\nsomething behind the rock.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers turned to see Caroline frightfully pale, his mouth hanging\r\nopen, with a look in which glimmered the last spark of reason, for\r\nCarolino, who was no other than Tano, Cabesang Tales’ son, and who had\r\njust returned from the Carolines, recognized in the dying man his\r\ngrandfather, Tandang Selo. No longer able to speak, the old man’s dying\r\neyes uttered a whole poem of grief—and then a corpse, he still\r\ncontinued to point to something behind the rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his solitary retreat on the shore of the sea, whose mobile surface\r\nwas visible through the open, windows, extending outward until it\r\nmingled with the horizon, Padre Florentino was relieving the monotony\r\nby playing on his harmonium sad and melancholy tunes, to which the\r\nsonorous roar of the surf and the sighing of the treetops of the\r\nneighboring wood served as accompaniments. Notes long, full, mournful\r\nas a prayer, yet still vigorous, escaped from the old instrument. Padre\r\nFlorentino, who was an accomplished musician, was improvising, and, as\r\nhe was alone, gave free rein to the sadness in his heart.\r\n\r\nFor the truth was that the old man was very sad. His good friend, Don\r\nTiburcio de Espadaña, had just left him, fleeing from the persecution\r\nof his wife. That morning he had received a note from the lieutenant of\r\nthe Civil Guard, which ran thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR CHAPLAIN,—I have just received from the commandant a\r\n    telegram that says, “Spaniard hidden house Padre Florentino capture\r\n    forward alive dead.” As the telegram is quite explicit, warn your\r\n    friend not to be there when I come to arrest him at eight tonight.\r\n\r\n    Affectionately,\r\n\r\n    PEREZ\r\n\r\n    Burn this note.\r\n\r\n\r\n“T-that V-victorina!” Don Tiburcio had stammered. “S-she’s c-capable of\r\nhaving me s-shot!”\r\n\r\nPadre Florentino was unable to reassure him. Vainly he pointed out to\r\nhim that the word cojera should have read cogerá, [77] and that the\r\nhidden Spaniard could not be Don  Tiburcio, but the jeweler Simoun, who\r\ntwo days before had arrived, wounded and a fugitive, begging for\r\nshelter. But Don Tiburcio would not be convinced—cojera was his own\r\nlameness, his personal description, and it was an intrigue of\r\nVictorina’s to get him back alive or dead, as Isagani had written from\r\nManila. So the poor Ulysses had left the priest’s house to conceal\r\nhimself in the hut of a woodcutter.\r\n\r\nNo doubt was entertained by Padre Florentino that the Spaniard wanted\r\nwas the jeweler Simoun, who had arrived mysteriously, himself carrying\r\nthe jewel-chest, bleeding, morose, and exhausted. With the free and\r\ncordial Filipino hospitality, the priest had taken him in, without\r\nasking indiscreet questions, and as news of the events in Manila had\r\nnot yet reached his ears he was unable to understand the situation\r\nclearly. The only conjecture that occurred to him was that the General,\r\nthe jeweler’s friend and protector, being gone, probably his enemies,\r\nthe victims of wrong and abuse, were now rising and calling for\r\nvengeance, and that the acting Governor was pursuing him to make him\r\ndisgorge the wealth he had accumulated—hence his flight. But whence\r\ncame his wounds? Had he tried to commit suicide? Were they the result\r\nof personal revenge? Or were they merely caused by an accident, as\r\nSimoun claimed? Had they been received in escaping from the force that\r\nwas pursuing him?\r\n\r\nThis last conjecture was the one that seemed to have the greatest\r\nappearance of probability, being further strengthened by the telegram\r\nreceived and Simoun’s decided unwillingness from the start to be\r\ntreated by the doctor from the capital. The jeweler submitted only to\r\nthe ministrations of Don Tiburcio, and even to them with marked\r\ndistrust. In this situation Padre Florentino was asking himself what\r\nline of conduct he should pursue when the Civil Guard came to arrest\r\nSimoun. His condition would not permit his removal, much less a long\r\njourney—but the telegram said alive or dead.\r\n\r\nPadre Florentine ceased playing and approached the window to gaze out\r\nat the sea, whose desolate surface was without a ship, without a\r\nsail—it gave him no suggestion. A solitary islet outlined in the\r\ndistance spoke only of solitude and made the space more lonely.\r\nInfinity is at times despairingly mute.\r\n\r\nThe old man was trying to analyze the sad and ironical smile with which\r\nSimoun had received the news that he was to be arrested. What did that\r\nsmile mean? And that other smile, still sadder and more ironical, with\r\nwhich he received the news that they would not come before eight at\r\nnight? What did all this mystery signify? Why did Simoun refuse to\r\nhide? There came into his mind the celebrated saying of St. John\r\nChrysostom when he was defending the eunuch Eutropius: “Never was a\r\nbetter time than this to say—Vanity of vanities and all is vanity!”\r\n\r\nYes, that Simoun, so rich, so powerful, so feared a week ago, and now\r\nmore unfortunate than Eutropius, was seeking refuge, not at the altars\r\nof a church, but in the miserable house of a poor native priest, hidden\r\nin the forest, on the solitary seashore! Vanity of vanities and all is\r\nvanity! That man would within a few hours be a prisoner, dragged from\r\nthe bed where he lay, without respect for his condition, without\r\nconsideration for his wounds—dead or alive his enemies demanded him!\r\nHow could he save him? Where could he find the moving accents of the\r\nbishop of Constantinople? What weight would his weak words have, the\r\nwords of a native priest, whose own humiliation this same Simoun had in\r\nhis better days seemed to applaud and encourage?\r\n\r\nBut Padre Florentine no longer recalled the indifferent reception that\r\ntwo months before the jeweler had accorded to him when he had tried to\r\ninterest him in favor of Isagani, then a prisoner on account of his\r\nimprudent chivalry; he forgot the activity Simoun had displayed in\r\nurging Paulita’s marriage, which had plunged Isagani into the fearful\r\nmisanthropy that was worrying his uncle. He forgot all these things and\r\nthought only of the sick man’s plight and his own obligations as a\r\nhost, until his senses reeled. Where must he hide him to avoid his\r\nfalling into the clutches of the authorities? But the person chiefly\r\nconcerned was not worrying, he was smiling.\r\n\r\nWhile he was pondering over these things, the old man was approached by\r\na servant who said that the sick man wished to speak with him, so he\r\nwent into the next room, a clean and well-ventilated apartment with a\r\nfloor of wide boards smoothed and polished, and simply furnished with\r\nbig, heavy armchairs of ancient design, without varnish or paint. At\r\none end there was a large kamagon bed with its four posts to support\r\nthe canopy, and beside it a table covered with bottles, lint, and\r\nbandages. A praying-desk at the feet of a Christ and a scanty library\r\nled to the suspicion that it was the priest’s own bedroom, given up to\r\nhis guest according to the Filipino custom of offering to the stranger\r\nthe best table, the best room, and the best bed in the house. Upon\r\nseeing the windows opened wide to admit freely the healthful sea-breeze\r\nand the echoes of its eternal lament, no one in the Philippines would\r\nhave said that a sick person was to be found there, since it is the\r\ncustom to close all the windows and stop up all the cracks just as soon\r\nas any one catches a cold or gets an insignificant headache.\r\n\r\nPadre Florentine looked toward the bed and was astonished to see that\r\nthe sick man’s face had lost its tranquil and ironical expression.\r\nHidden grief seemed to knit his brows, anxiety was depicted in his\r\nlooks, his lips were curled in a smile of pain.\r\n\r\n“Are you suffering, Señor Simoun?” asked the priest solicitously, going\r\nto his side.\r\n\r\n“Some! But in a little while I shall cease to suffer,” he replied with\r\na shake of his head.\r\n\r\nPadre Florentine clasped his hands in fright, suspecting that he\r\nunderstood the terrible truth. “My God, what have you done? What have\r\nyou taken?” He reached toward the bottles.\r\n\r\n“It’s useless now! There’s no remedy at all!” answered Simoun with a\r\npained smile. “What did you expect me to do? Before the clock strikes\r\neight—alive or dead—dead, yes, but alive, no!”\r\n\r\n“My God, what have you done?”\r\n\r\n“Be calm!” urged the sick man with a wave of his hand. “What’s done is\r\ndone. I must not fall into anybody’s hands—my secret would be torn from\r\nme. Don’t get excited, don’t lose your head, it’s useless! Listen—the\r\nnight is coming on and there’s no time to be lost. I must tell you my\r\nsecret, and intrust to you my last request, I must lay my life open\r\nbefore you. At the supreme moment I want to lighten myself of a load, I\r\nwant to clear up a doubt of mine. You who believe so firmly in God—I\r\nwant you to tell me if there is a God!”\r\n\r\n“But an antidote, Señor Simoun! I have ether, chloroform—”\r\n\r\nThe priest began to search for a flask, until Simoun cried impatiently,\r\n“Useless, it’s useless! Don’t waste time! I’ll go away with my secret!”\r\n\r\nThe bewildered priest fell down at his desk and prayed at the feet of\r\nthe Christ, hiding his face in his hands. Then he arose serious and\r\ngrave, as if he had received from his God all the force, all the\r\ndignity, all the authority of the Judge of consciences. Moving a chair\r\nto the head of the bed he prepared to listen.\r\n\r\nAt the first words Simoun murmured, when he told his real name, the old\r\npriest started back and gazed at him in terror, whereat the sick man\r\nsmiled bitterly. Taken by surprise, the priest was not master of\r\nhimself, but he soon recovered, and covering his face with a\r\nhandkerchief again bent over to listen.\r\n\r\nSimoun related his sorrowful story: how, thirteen years before, he had\r\nreturned from Europe filled with hopes and smiling illusions, having\r\ncome back to marry a girl whom he loved, disposed to do good and\r\nforgive all who had wronged him, just so they would let him live in\r\npeace. But it was not so. A mysterious hand involved him in the\r\nconfusion of an uprising planned by his enemies. Name, fortune, love,\r\nfuture, liberty, all were lost, and he escaped only through the heroism\r\nof a friend. Then he swore vengeance. With the wealth of his family,\r\nwhich had been buried in a wood, he had fled, had gone to foreign lands\r\nand engaged in trade. He took part in the war in Cuba, aiding first one\r\nside and then another, but always profiting. There he made the\r\nacquaintance of the General, then a major, whose good-will he won first\r\nby loans of money, and afterwards he made a friend of him by the\r\nknowledge of criminal secrets. With his money he had been able to\r\nsecure the General’s appointment and, once in the Philippines, he had\r\nused him as a blind tool and incited him to all kinds of injustice,\r\navailing himself of his insatiable lust for gold.\r\n\r\nThe confession was long and tedious, but during the whole of it the\r\nconfessor made no further sign of surprise and rarely interrupted the\r\nsick man. It was night when Padre Florentino, wiping the perspiration\r\nfrom his face, arose and began to meditate. Mysterious darkness flooded\r\nthe room, so that the moonbeams entering through the window filled it\r\nwith vague lights and vaporous reflections.\r\n\r\nInto the midst of the silence the priest’s voice broke sad and\r\ndeliberate, but consoling: “God will forgive you, Señor—Simoun,” he\r\nsaid. “He knows that we are fallible, He has seen that you have\r\nsuffered, and in ordaining that the chastisement for your faults should\r\ncome as death from the very ones you have instigated to crime, we can\r\nsee His infinite mercy. He has frustrated your plans one by one, the\r\nbest conceived, first by the death of Maria Clara, then by a lack of\r\npreparation, then in some mysterious way. Let us bow to His will and\r\nrender Him thanks!”\r\n\r\n“According to you, then,” feebly responded the sick man, “His will is\r\nthat these islands—”\r\n\r\n“Should continue in the condition in which they suffer?” finished the\r\npriest, seeing that the other hesitated. “I don’t know, sir, I can’t\r\nread the thought of the Inscrutable. I know that He has not abandoned\r\nthose peoples who in their supreme moments have trusted in Him and made\r\nHim the Judge of their cause, I know that His arm has never failed\r\nwhen, justice long trampled upon and every recourse gone, the oppressed\r\nhave taken up the sword to fight for home and wife and children, for\r\ntheir inalienable rights, which, as the German poet says, shine ever\r\nthere above, unextinguished and inextinguishable, like the eternal\r\nstars themselves. No, God is justice, He cannot abandon His cause, the\r\ncause of liberty, without which no justice is possible.”\r\n\r\n“Why then has He denied me His aid?” asked the sick man in a voice\r\ncharged with bitter complaint.\r\n\r\n“Because you chose means that He could not sanction,” was the severe\r\nreply. “The glory of saving a country is not for him who has\r\ncontributed to its ruin. You have believed that what crime and iniquity\r\nhave defiled and deformed, another crime and another iniquity can\r\npurify and redeem. Wrong! Hate never produces anything but monsters and\r\ncrime criminals! Love alone realizes wonderful works, virtue alone can\r\nsave! No, if our country has ever to be free, it will not be through\r\nvice and crime, it will not be so by corrupting its sons, deceiving\r\nsome and bribing others, no! Redemption presupposes virtue, virtue\r\nsacrifice, and sacrifice love!”\r\n\r\n“Well, I accept your explanation,” rejoined the sick man, after a\r\npause. “I have been mistaken, but, because I have been mistaken, will\r\nthat God deny liberty to a people and yet save many who are much worse\r\ncriminals than I am? What is my mistake compared to the crimes of our\r\nrulers? Why has that God to give more heed to my iniquity than to the\r\ncries of so many innocents? Why has He not stricken me down and then\r\nmade the people triumph? Why does He let so many worthy and just ones\r\nsuffer and look complacently upon their tortures?”\r\n\r\n“The just and the worthy must suffer in order that their ideas may be\r\nknown and extended! You must shake or shatter the vase to spread its\r\nperfume, you must smite the rock to get the spark! There is something\r\nprovidential in the persecutions of tyrants, Señor Simoun!”\r\n\r\n“I knew it,” murmured the sick man, “and therefore I encouraged the\r\ntyranny.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend, but more corrupt influences than anything else were\r\nspread. You fostered the social rottenness without sowing an idea. From\r\nthis fermentation of vices loathing alone could spring, and if anything\r\nwere born overnight it would be at best a mushroom, for mushrooms only\r\ncan spring spontaneously from filth. True it is that the vices of the\r\ngovernment are fatal to it, they cause its death, but they kill also\r\nthe society in whose bosom they are developed. An immoral government\r\npresupposes a demoralized people, a conscienceless administration,\r\ngreedy and servile citizens in the settled parts, outlaws and brigands\r\nin the mountains. Like master, like slave! Like government, like\r\ncountry!”\r\n\r\nA brief pause ensued, broken at length by the sick man’s voice. “Then,\r\nwhat can be done?”\r\n\r\n“Suffer and work!”\r\n\r\n“Suffer—work!” echoed the sick man bitterly. “Ah, it’s easy to say\r\nthat, when you are not suffering, when the work is rewarded. If your\r\nGod demands such great sacrifices from man, man who can scarcely count\r\nupon the present and doubts the future, if you had seen what I have,\r\nthe miserable, the wretched, suffering unspeakable tortures for crimes\r\nthey have not committed, murdered to cover up the faults and incapacity\r\nof others, poor fathers of families torn from their homes to work to no\r\npurpose upon highways that are destroyed each day and seem only to\r\nserve for sinking families into want. Ah, to suffer, to work, is the\r\nwill of God! Convince them that their murder is their salvation, that\r\ntheir work is the prosperity of the home! To suffer, to work! What God\r\nis that?”\r\n\r\n“A very just God, Señor Simoun,” replied the priest. “A God who\r\nchastises our lack of faith, our vices, the little esteem in which we\r\nhold dignity and the civic virtues. We tolerate vice, we make ourselves\r\nits accomplices, at times we applaud it, and it is just, very just that\r\nwe suffer the consequences, that our children suffer them. It is the\r\nGod of liberty, Señor Simoun, who obliges us to love it, by making the\r\nyoke heavy for us—a God of mercy, of equity, who while He chastises us,\r\nbetters us and only grants prosperity to him who has merited it through\r\nhis efforts. The school of suffering tempers, the arena of combat\r\nstrengthens the soul.\r\n\r\n“I do not mean to say that our liberty will be secured at the sword’s\r\npoint, for the sword plays but little part in modern affairs, but that\r\nwe must secure it by making ourselves worthy of it, by exalting the\r\nintelligence and the dignity of the individual, by loving justice,\r\nright, and greatness, even to the extent of dying for them,—and when a\r\npeople reaches that height God will provide a weapon, the idols will be\r\nshattered, the tyranny will crumble like a house of cards and liberty\r\nwill shine out like the first dawn.\r\n\r\n“Our ills we owe to ourselves alone, so let us blame no one. If Spain\r\nshould see that we were less complaisant with tyranny and more disposed\r\nto struggle and suffer for our rights, Spain would be the first to\r\ngrant us liberty, because when the fruit of the womb reaches maturity\r\nwoe unto the mother who would stifle it! So, while the Filipino people\r\nhas not sufficient energy to proclaim, with head erect and bosom bared,\r\nits rights to social life, and to guarantee it with its sacrifices,\r\nwith its own blood; while we see our countrymen in private life ashamed\r\nwithin themselves, hear the voice of conscience roar in rebellion and\r\nprotest, yet in public life keep silence or even echo the words of him\r\nwho abuses them in order to mock the abused; while we see them wrap\r\nthemselves up in their egotism and with a forced smile praise the most\r\niniquitous actions, begging with their eyes a portion of the booty—why\r\ngrant them liberty? With Spain or without Spain they would always be\r\nthe same, and perhaps worse! Why independence, if the slaves of today\r\nwill be the tyrants of tomorrow? And that they will be such is not to\r\nbe doubted, for he who submits to tyranny loves it.\r\n\r\n“Señor Simoun, when our people is unprepared, when it enters the fight\r\nthrough fraud and force, without a clear understanding of what it is\r\ndoing, the wisest attempts will fail, and better that they do fail,\r\nsince why commit the wife to the husband if he does not sufficiently\r\nlove her, if he is not ready to die for her?”\r\n\r\nPadre Florentino felt the sick man catch and press his hand, so he\r\nbecame silent, hoping that the other might speak, but he merely felt a\r\nstronger pressure of the hand, heard a sigh, and then profound silence\r\nreigned in the room. Only the sea, whose waves were rippled by the\r\nnight breeze, as though awaking from the heat of the day, sent its\r\nhoarse roar, its eternal chant, as it rolled against the jagged rocks.\r\nThe moon, now free from the sun’s rivalry, peacefully commanded the\r\nsky, and the trees of the forest bent down toward one another, telling\r\ntheir ancient legends in mysterious murmurs borne on the wings of the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nThe sick man said nothing, so Padre Florentino, deeply thoughtful,\r\nmurmured: “Where are the youth who will consecrate their golden hours,\r\ntheir illusions, and their enthusiasm to the welfare of their native\r\nland? Where are the youth who will generously pour out their blood to\r\nwash away so much shame, so much crime, so much abomination? Pure and\r\nspotless must the victim be that the sacrifice may be acceptable! Where\r\nare you, youth, who will embody in yourselves the vigor of life that\r\nhas left our veins, the purity of ideas that has been contaminated in\r\nour brains, the fire of enthusiasm that has been quenched in our\r\nhearts? We await you, O youth! Come, for we await you!”\r\n\r\nFeeling his eyes moisten he withdrew his hand from that of the sick\r\nman, arose, and went to the window to gaze out upon the wide surface of\r\nthe sea. He was drawn from his meditation by gentle raps at the door.\r\nIt was the servant asking if he should bring a light.\r\n\r\nWhen the priest returned to the sick man and looked at him in the light\r\nof the lamp, motionless, his eyes closed, the hand that had pressed his\r\nlying open and extended along the edge of the bed, he thought for a\r\nmoment that he was sleeping, but noticing that he was not breathing\r\ntouched him gently, and then realized that he was dead. His body had\r\nalready commenced to turn cold. The priest fell upon his knees and\r\nprayed.\r\n\r\nWhen he arose and contemplated the corpse, in whose features were\r\ndepicted the deepest grief, the tragedy of a whole wasted life which he\r\nwas carrying over there beyond death, the old man shuddered and\r\nmurmured, “God have mercy on those who turned him from the straight\r\npath!”\r\n\r\nWhile the servants summoned by him fell upon their knees and prayed for\r\nthe dead man, curious and bewildered as they gazed toward the bed,\r\nreciting requiem after requiem, Padre Florentino took from a cabinet\r\nthe celebrated steel chest that contained Simoun’s fabulous wealth. He\r\nhesitated for a moment, then resolutely descended the stairs and made\r\nhis way to the cliff where Isagani was accustomed to sit and gaze into\r\nthe depths of the sea.\r\n\r\nPadre Florentino looked down at his feet. There below he saw the dark\r\nbillows of the Pacific beating into the hollows of the cliff, producing\r\nsonorous thunder, at the same time that, smitten by the moonbeams, the\r\nwaves and foam glittered like sparks of fire, like handfuls of diamonds\r\nhurled into the air by some jinnee of the abyss. He gazed about him. He\r\nwas alone. The solitary coast was lost in the distance amid the dim\r\ncloud that the moonbeams played through, until it mingled with the\r\nhorizon. The forest murmured unintelligible sounds.\r\n\r\nThen the old man, with an effort of his herculean arms, hurled the\r\nchest into space, throwing it toward the sea. It whirled over and over\r\nseveral times and descended rapidly in a slight curve, reflecting the\r\nmoonlight on its polished surface. The old man saw the drops of water\r\nfly and heard a loud splash as the abyss closed over and swallowed up\r\nthe treasure. He waited for a few moments to see if the depths would\r\nrestore anything, but the wave rolled on as mysteriously as before,\r\nwithout adding a fold to its rippling surface, as though into the\r\nimmensity of the sea a pebble only had been dropped.\r\n\r\n“May Nature guard you in her deep abysses among the pearls and corals\r\nof her eternal seas,” then said the priest, solemnly extending his\r\nhands. “When for some holy and sublime purpose man may need you, God\r\nwill in his wisdom draw you from the bosom of the waves. Meanwhile,\r\nthere you will not work woe, you will not distort justice, you will not\r\nfoment avarice!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY\r\n\r\n\r\nabá: A Tagalog exclamation of wonder, surprise, etc., often used to\r\nintroduce or emphasize a contradictory statement.\r\n\r\nalcalde: Governor of a province or district, with both executive and\r\njudicial authority.\r\n\r\nAyuntamiento: A city corporation or council, and by extension the\r\nbuilding in which it has its offices; specifically, in Manila, the\r\ncapitol.\r\n\r\nbalete: The Philippine banyan, a tree sacred in Malay folk-lore.\r\n\r\nbanka: A dugout canoe with bamboo supports or outriggers.\r\n\r\nbatalan: The platform of split bamboo attached to a nipa house.\r\n\r\nbatikúlin: A variety of easily-turned wood, used in carving.\r\n\r\nbibinka: A sweetmeat made of sugar or molasses and rice-flour, commonly\r\nsold in the small shops.\r\n\r\nbuyera: A woman who prepares and sells the buyo.\r\n\r\nbuyo: The masticatory prepared by wrapping a piece of areca-nut with a\r\nlittle shell-lime in a betel-leaf—the pan of British India.\r\n\r\ncabesang: Title of a cabeza de barangay; given by courtesy to his wife\r\nalso.\r\n\r\ncabeza de barangay: Headman and tax-collector for a group of about\r\nfifty families, for whose “tribute” he was personally responsible.\r\n\r\ncalesa: A two-wheeled chaise with folding top.\r\n\r\ncalle: Street (Spanish).\r\n\r\ncamisa: 1.

Gathered in small bands with such arms as they\r\ncould secure, they sustained themselves by highway robbery and the\r\nlevying of black-mail from the country folk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Spanish designation for the Christianized Malay of the\r\nPhilippines was indio (Indian), a term used rather contemptuously, the\r\nname filipino being generally applied in a restricted sense to the\r\nchildren of Spaniards born in the Islands.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[2] Now generally known as the Mariquina.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[3] This bridge, constructed in Lukban under the supervision of a\r\nFranciscan friar, was jocularly referred to as the Puente de Capricho,\r\nbeing apparently an ignorant blunder in the right direction, since it\r\nwas declared in an official report made by Spanish engineers in 1852 to\r\nconform to no known principle of scientific construction, and yet\r\nproved to be strong and durable.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[4] Don Custodio’s gesture indicates money.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[5] Duck eggs, that are allowed to advance well into the duckling\r\nstage, then boiled and eaten. The señora is sneering at a custom among\r\nsome of her own people.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[6] The Jesuit College in Manila, established in 1859.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[7] Natives of Spain; to distinguish them from the Filipinos, i.e.,\r\ndescendants of Spaniards born in the Philippines. See Glossary:\r\n“Indian.”—Tr.\r\n\r\n[8] It was a common saying among the old Filipinos that the Spaniards\r\n(white men) were fire (activity), while they themselves were water\r\n(passivity).—Tr.\r\n\r\n[9] The “liberal” demonstrations in Manila, and the mutiny in the\r\nCavite Arsenal, resulting in the garroting of the three native priests\r\nto whom this work was dedicated: the first of a series of fatal\r\nmistakes, culminating in the execution of the author, that cost Spain\r\nthe loyalty of the Filipinos.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[10] Archbishop of Manila from 1767 to 1787.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[11] “Between this island (Talim) and Halahala point extends a strait a\r\nmile wide and a league long, which the Indians call ‘Kinabutasan,’ a\r\nname that in their language means ‘place that was cleft open’; from\r\nwhich it is inferred that in other times the island was joined to the\r\nmainland and was separated from it by some severe earthquake, thus\r\nleaving this strait: of this there is an old tradition among the\r\nIndians.”—Fray Martinez de Zuñiga’s Estadismo (1803).\r\n\r\n[12] The reference is to the novel Noli Me Tangere (The Social Cancer),\r\nthe author’s first work, of which, the present is in a way a\r\ncontinuation.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[13] This legend is still current among the Tagalogs. It circulates in\r\nvarious forms, the commonest being that the king was so confined for\r\ndefying the lightning; and it takes no great stretch of the imagination\r\nto fancy in this idea a reference to the firearms used by the Spanish\r\nconquerors. Quite recently (January 1909), when the nearly extinct\r\nvolcano of Banahao shook itself and scattered a few tons of mud over\r\nthe surrounding landscape, the people thereabout recalled this old\r\nlegend, saying that it was their King Bernardo making another effort to\r\nget that right foot loose.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[14] The reference is to Noli Me Tangere, in which Sinang appears.\r\n\r\n[15] The Dominican school of secondary instruction in Manila.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[16] “The studies of secondary instruction given in Santo Tomas, in the\r\ncollege of San Juan de Letran, and of San José, and in the private\r\nschools, had the defects inherent in the plan of instruction which the\r\nfriars developed in the Philippines. It suited their plans that\r\nscientific and literary knowledge should not become general nor very\r\nextensive, for which reason they took but little interest in the study\r\nof those subjects or in the quality of the instruction. Their\r\neducational establishments were places of luxury for the children of\r\nwealthy and well-to-do families rather than establishments in which to\r\nperfect and develop the minds of the Filipino youth. It is true they\r\nwere careful to give them a religious education, tending to make them\r\nrespect the omnipotent power (sic) of the monastic corporations.\r\n\r\n“The intellectual powers were made dormant by devoting a greater part\r\nof the time to the study of Latin, to which they attached an\r\nextraordinary importance, for the purpose of discouraging pupils from\r\nstudying the exact and experimental sciences and from gaining a\r\nknowledge of true literary studies.\r\n\r\n“The philosophic system explained was naturally the scholastic one,\r\nwith an exceedingly refined and subtile logic, and with deficient ideas\r\nupon physics. By the study of Latin, and their philosophic systems,\r\nthey converted their pupils into automatic machines rather than into\r\npractical men prepared to battle with life.”—Census of the Philippine\r\nIslands (Washington, 1905), Volume III, pp. 601, 602.\r\n\r\n[17] The nature of this booklet, in Tagalog, is made clear in several\r\npassages. It was issued by the Franciscans, but proved too outspoken\r\nfor even Latin refinement, and was suppressed by the Order itself.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[18] The rectory or parish house.\r\n\r\n[19] Friends of the author, who suffered in Weyler’s expedition,\r\nmentioned below.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[20] The Dominican corporation, at whose instigation Captain-General\r\nValeriano Weyler sent a battery of artillery to Kalamba to destroy the\r\nproperty of tenants who were contesting in the courts the friars’\r\ntitles to land there. The author’s family were the largest\r\nsufferers.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[21] A relative of the author, whose body was dragged from the tomb and\r\nthrown to the dogs, on the pretext that he had died without receiving\r\nfinal absolution.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[22] Under the Spanish régime the government paid no attention to\r\neducation, the schools (!) being under the control of the religious\r\norders and the friar-curates of the towns.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[23] The cockpits are farmed out annually by the local governments, the\r\nterms “contract,” and “contractor,” having now been softened into\r\n“license” and “licensee.”—Tr.\r\n\r\n[24] The “Municipal School for Girls” was founded by the municipality\r\nof Manila in 1864.... The institution was in charge of the Sisters of\r\nCharity.—Census of the Philippine Islands, Vol. III, p. 615.\r\n\r\n[25] Now known as Plaza España.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[26] Patroness of the Dominican Order. She was formally and sumptuously\r\nrecrowned a queen of the skies in 1907.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[27] A burlesque on an association of students known as the Milicia\r\nAngelica, organized by the Dominicans to strengthen their hold on the\r\npeople. The name used is significant, “carbineers” being the local\r\nrevenue officers, notorious in their later days for graft and\r\nabuse.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[28] “Tinamáan ñg lintik!”—a Tagalog exclamation of anger,\r\ndisappointment, or dismay, regarded as a very strong expression,\r\nequivalent to profanity. Literally, “May the lightning strike you!”—Tr.\r\n\r\n[29] “To lie about the stars is a safe kind of lying.”—Tr.\r\n\r\n[30] Throughout this chapter the professor uses the familiar tu in\r\naddressing the students, thus giving his remarks a contemptuous\r\ntone.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[31] The professor speaks these words in vulgar dialect.\r\n\r\n[32] To confuse the letters p and f in speaking Spanish was a common\r\nerror among uneducated Filipinos.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[33] No cristianos, not Christians, i.e., savages.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[34] The patron saint of Spain, St. James.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[35] Houses of bamboo and nipa, such as form the homes of the masses of\r\nthe natives.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[36] “In this paragraph Rizal alludes to an incident that had very\r\nserious results. There was annually celebrated in Binondo a certain\r\nreligious festival, principally at the expense of the Chinese mestizos.\r\nThe latter finally petitioned that their gobernadorcillo be given the\r\npresidency of it, and this was granted, thanks to the fact that the\r\nparish priest (the Dominican, Fray José Hevia Campomanes) held to the\r\nopinion that the presidency belonged to those who paid the most. The\r\nTagalogs protested, alleging their better right to it, as the genuine\r\nsons of the country, not to mention the historical precedent, but the\r\nfriar, who was looking after his own interests, did not yield. General\r\nTerrero (Governor, 1885–1888), at the advice of his liberal councilors,\r\nfinally had the parish priest removed and for the time being decided\r\nthe affair in favor of the Tagalogs. The matter reached the Colonial\r\nOffice (Ministerio de Ultramar) and the Minister was not even content\r\nmerely to settle it in the way the friars desired, but made amends to\r\nPadre Hevia by appointing him a bishop.”—W. E. Retana, who was a\r\njournalist in Manila at the time, in a note to this chapter.\r\n\r\nChildish and ridiculous as this may appear now, it was far from being\r\nso at the time, especially in view of the supreme contempt with which\r\nthe pugnacious Tagalog looks down upon the meek and complaisant Chinese\r\nand the mortal antipathy that exists between the two races.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[37] It is regrettable that Quiroga’s picturesque butchery of Spanish\r\nand Tagalog—the dialect of the Manila Chinese—cannot be reproduced\r\nhere. Only the thought can be given. There is the same difficulty with\r\nr’s, d’s, and l’s that the Chinese show in English.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[38] Up to the outbreak of the insurrection in 1896, the only genuinely\r\nSpanish troops in the islands were a few hundred artillerymen, the rest\r\nbeing natives, with Spanish officers.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[39] Abaka is the fiber obtained from the leaves of the Musa textilis\r\nand is known commercially as Manila hemp. As it is exclusively a\r\nproduct of the Philippines, it may be taken here to symbolize the\r\ncountry.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[40] Yet Ben-Zayb was not very much mistaken. The three legs of the\r\ntable have grooves in them in which slide the mirrors hidden below the\r\nplatform and covered by the squares of the carpet. By placing the box\r\nupon the table a spring is pressed and the mirrors rise gently. The\r\ncloth is then removed, with care to raise it instead of letting it\r\nslide off, and then there is the ordinary table of the talking heads.\r\nThe table is connected with the bottom of the box. The exhibition\r\nended, the prestidigitator again covers the table, presses another\r\nspring, and the mirrors descend.—Author’s note.\r\n\r\n[41] The Malay method of kissing is quite different from the\r\nOccidental. The mouth is placed close to the object and a deep breath\r\ntaken, often without actually touching the object, being more of a\r\nsniff than a kiss.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[42] Now Calle Tetuan, Santa Cruz. The other names are still in\r\nuse.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[43] The Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País for the encouragement of\r\nagricultural and industrial development, was established by Basco de\r\nVargas in 1780.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[44] Funds managed by the government for making loans and supporting\r\ncharitable enterprises.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[45] The names are fictitious burlesques.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[46] “Boiled Shrimp”—Tr.\r\n\r\n[47] “Uncle Frank.”—Tr.\r\n\r\n[48] Messageries Maritimes, a French line of steamers in the Oriental\r\ntrade.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[49] Referring to the expeditions—Misión Española Católica—to the\r\nCaroline and Pelew Islands from 1886 to 1895, headed by the Capuchin\r\nFathers, which brought misery and disaster upon the natives of those\r\nislands, unprofitable losses and sufferings to the Filipino soldiers\r\nengaged in them, discredit to Spain, and decorations of merit to a\r\nnumber of Spanish officers.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[50] Over the possession of the Caroline and Pelew Islands. The\r\nexpeditions referred to in the previous note were largely inspired by\r\nGerman activity with regard to those islands, which had always been\r\nclaimed by Spain, who sold her claim to them to Germany after the loss\r\nof the Philippines.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[51] “Where the wind wrinkles the silent waves, that rapidly break,\r\n    of their own movement, with a gentle murmur on the shore.”—Tr.\r\n\r\n[52] “Where rapid and winged engines will rush in flight.”—Tr.\r\n\r\n[53] There is something almost uncanny about the general accuracy of\r\nthe prophecy in these lines, the economic part of which is now so well\r\non the way to realization, although the writer of them would doubtless\r\nhave been a very much surprised individual had he also foreseen how it\r\nwould come about. But one of his own expressions was “fire and steel to\r\nthe cancer,” and it surely got them.\r\n\r\nOn the very day that this passage was translated and this note written,\r\nthe first commercial liner was tied up at the new docks, which have\r\ndestroyed the Malecon but raised Manila to the front rank of Oriental\r\nseaports, and the final revision is made at Baguio, Mountain Province,\r\namid the “cooler temperatures on the slopes of the mountains.” As for\r\nthe political portion, it is difficult even now to contemplate calmly\r\nthe blundering fatuity of that bigoted medieval brand of “patriotism”\r\nwhich led the decrepit Philippine government to play the Ancient\r\nMariner and shoot the Albatross that brought this message.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[54] These establishments are still a notable feature of native life in\r\nManila. Whether the author adopted a title already common or\r\npopularized one of his own invention, the fact is that they are now\r\ninvariably known by the name used here. The use of macanista was due to\r\nthe presence in Manila of a large number of Chinese from Macao.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[55] Originally, Plaza San Gabriel, from the Dominican mission for the\r\nChinese established there; later, as it became a commercial center,\r\nPlaza Vivac; and now known as Plaza Cervantes, being the financial\r\ncenter of Manila.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[56] “The manager of this restaurant warns the public to leave\r\nabsolutely nothing on any table or chair.”—Tr.\r\n\r\n[57] “We do not believe in the verisimilitude of this dialogue,\r\nfabricated by the author in order to refute the arguments of the\r\nfriars, whose pride was so great that it would not permit any Isagani\r\nto tell them these truths face to face. The invention of Padre\r\nFernandez as a Dominican professor is a stroke of generosity on Rizal’s\r\npart, in conceding that there could have existed any friar capable of\r\ntalking frankly with an Indian.”—W. E. Retana, in note to this chapter\r\nin the edition published by him at Barcelona in 1908. Retana ought to\r\nknow of what he is writing, for he was in the employ of the friars for\r\nseveral years and later in Spain wrote extensively for the journal\r\nsupported by them to defend their position in the Philippines. He has\r\nalso been charged with having strongly urged Rizal’s execution in 1896.\r\nSince 1898, however, he has doubled about, or, perhaps more aptly,\r\nperformed a journalistic somersault—having written a diffuse biography\r\nand other works dealing with Rizal. He is strong in unassorted facts,\r\nbut his comments, when not inane and wearisome, approach a maudlin wail\r\nover “spilt milk,” so the above is given at its face value only.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[58] Quite suggestive of, and perhaps inspired by, the author’s own\r\nexperience.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[59] The Walled City, the original Manila, is still known to the\r\nSpaniards and older natives exclusively as such, the other districts\r\nbeing referred to by their distinctive names.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[60] Nearly all the dialogue in this chapter is in the mongrel\r\nSpanish-Tagalog “market language,” which cannot be reproduced in\r\nEnglish.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[61] Doubtless a reference to the author’s first work, Noli Me Tangere,\r\nwhich was tabooed by the authorities.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[62] Such inanities as these are still a feature of Manila\r\njournalism.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[63] “Whether there would be a talisain cock, armed with a sharp gaff,\r\nwhether the blessed Peter’s fighting-cock would be a bulik—”\r\n\r\nTalisain and bulik are distinguishing terms in the vernacular for\r\nfighting-cocks, tari and sasabung̃in the Tagalog terms for “gaff” and\r\n“game-cock,” respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Tagalog terminology of the cockpit and monkish Latin certainly make\r\na fearful and wonderful mixture—nor did the author have to resort to\r\nhis imagination to get samples of it.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[64] This is Quiroga’s pronunciation of Christo.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[65] The native priests Burgos, Gomez, and Zamora, charged with\r\ncomplicity in the uprising of 1872, and executed.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[66] This versicle, found in the booklets of prayer, is common on the\r\nscapularies, which, during the late insurrection, were easily converted\r\ninto the anting-anting, or amulets, worn by the fanatics.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[67] This practise—secretly compelling suspects to sign a request to be\r\ntransferred to some other island—was by no means a figment of the\r\nauthor’s imagination, but was extensively practised to anticipate any\r\nlegal difficulties that might arise.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[68] “Hawk-Eye.”—Tr.\r\n\r\n[69] Ultima Razón de Reyes: the last argument of kings—force.\r\n(Expression attributed to Calderon de la Barca, the great Spanish\r\ndramatist.)—Tr.\r\n\r\n[70] Curiously enough, and by what must have been more than a mere\r\ncoincidence, this route through Santa Mesa from San Juan del Monte was\r\nthe one taken by an armed party in their attempt to enter the city at\r\nthe outbreak of the Katipunan rebellion on the morning of August 30,\r\n1896. (Foreman’s The Philippine Islands, Chap. XXVI.)\r\n\r\nIt was also on the bridge connecting these two places that the first\r\nshot in the insurrection against American sovereignty was fired on the\r\nnight of February 4, 1899.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[71] Spanish etiquette requires a host to welcome his guest with the\r\nconventional phrase: “The house belongs to you.”—Tr.\r\n\r\n[72] The handwriting on the wall at Belshazzar’s feast, foretelling the\r\ndestruction of Babylon. Daniel, v, 25–28.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[73] A town in Ciudad Real province, Spain.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[74] The italicized words are in English in the original.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[75] A Spanish hero, whose chief exploit was the capture of Gibraltar\r\nfrom the Moors in 1308.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[76] Emilio Castelar (1832–1899), generally regarded as the greatest of\r\nSpanish orators.—Tr.\r\n\r\n[77] In the original the message reads: “Español escondido casa Padre\r\nFlorentino cojera remitirá vivo muerto.” Don Tiburcio understands\r\ncojera as referring to himself; there is a play upon the Spanish words\r\ncojera, lameness, and cogerá, a form of the verb coger, to seize or\r\ncapture—j and g in these two words having the same sound, that of the\r\nEnglish h.—Tr.",
