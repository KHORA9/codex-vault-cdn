Jurists have commonly\r\nleft its study to scholars, who have generally refrained from comparing\r\nthe institutions of the Greeks with those of other nations. Greek law\r\nhas, however, been partially compared with Roman law, and has been\r\nincidentally illustrated with the aid of the primitive institutions of\r\nthe Germanic nations. It may now be studied in its earlier stages in the\r\nlaws of Gortyn; its influence may be traced in legal documents preserved\r\nin Egyptian papyri; and it may be recognized as a consistent whole in\r\nits ultimate relations to Roman law in the eastern provinces of the\r\nRoman empire.\r\n\r\nThe existence of certain panhellenic principles of law is implied by the\r\ncustom of settling a difference between two Greek states, or between\r\nmembers of a single state, by resorting to external arbitration. The\r\ngeneral unity of Greek law is mainly to be seen in the laws of\r\ninheritance and adoption, in laws of commerce and contract, and in the\r\npublicity uniformly given to legal agreements.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Original authorities.\r\n\r\nNo systematic collection of Greek laws has come down to us. Our\r\nknowledge of some of the earliest notions of the subject is derived from\r\nthe Homeric poems. For the details of Attic law we have to depend on _ex\r\nparte_ statements in the speeches of the Attic orators, and we are\r\nsometimes enabled to check those statements by the trustworthy, but\r\noften imperfect, aid of inscriptions. Incidental illustrations of the\r\nlaws of Athens may be found in the Laws of Plato, who deals with the\r\ntheory of the subject without exercising any influence on actual\r\npractice. The Laws of Plato are criticized in the _Politics_ of\r\nAristotle, who, besides discussing laws in their relation to\r\nconstitutions, reviews the work of certain early Greek lawgivers. The\r\ntreatise on the _Constitution of Athens_ includes an account of the\r\njurisdiction of the various public officials and of the machinery of the\r\nlaw courts, and thus enables us to dispense with the second-hand\r\ntestimony of grammarians and scholiasts who derived their information\r\nfrom that treatise (see CONSTITUTION OF ATHENS). The works of\r\nTheophrastus _On the Laws_, which included a recapitulation of the laws\r\nof various barbaric as well as Grecian states, are now represented by\r\nonly a few fragments (Nos. 97-106, ed. Wimmer).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Law in Homer.\r\n\r\nOur earliest evidence is to be sought in the Homeric poems. In the\r\nprimitive society of the heroic age (as noticed by Plato) written laws\r\nwere necessarily unknown; for, \"in that early period, they had no\r\nletters; they lived by habit and by the customs of their ancestors\"\r\n(_Laws_, 680 A). We find a survival from a still more primitive time in\r\nthe savage Cyclops, who is \"unfamiliar with dooms of law, or rules of\r\nright\" ([Greek: oute dikas eu eidota oute themistas], _Od._ ix. 215 and\r\n112 f.).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dike.\r\n\r\n  _Dike_ ([Greek: dike]), assigned by Curtius (_Etym._ 134) to the same\r\n  root as [Greek: deiknymi], primarily means a \"way pointed out,\" a\r\n  \"course prescribed by usage,\" hence \"way\" or \"fashion,\" \"manner\" or\r\n  \"precedent.\" In the Homeric poems it sometimes signifies a \"doom\" of\r\n  law, a legal \"right,\" a \"lawsuit\"; while it is rarely synonymous with\r\n  \"justice,\" as in _Od._ xiv. 84, where \"the gods honour justice,\"\r\n  [Greek: tiousi diken].\r\n\r\n\r\n    Themis.\r\n\r\n  Various senses of \"right\" are expressed in the same poems by _themis_\r\n  ([Greek: themis]), a term assigned (_ib._ 254) to the same root as\r\n  [Greek: tithemi]. In its primary sense _themis_ is that which \"has\r\n  been laid down\"; hence a particular decision or \"doom.\" The plural\r\n  _themistes_ implies a body of such precedents, \"rules of right,\" which\r\n  the king receives from Zeus with his sceptre (_Il._ ix. 99). _Themis_\r\n  and _dike_ have sometimes been compared with the Roman _fas_ and _jus_\r\n  respectively, the former being regarded as of divine, the latter of\r\n  human origin; and this is more satisfactory than the latest view (that\r\n  of Hirzel), which makes \"counsel\" the primary meaning of _themis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Thesmos. Nomos.\r\n\r\n  _Thesmos_ ([Greek: thesmos]), an ordinance (from the same root as\r\n  themis), is not found in \"Homer,\" except in the last line of the\r\n  original form of the _Odyssey_ (xxiii. 296), where it probably refers\r\n  to the \"ordinance\" of wedlock. The common term for law, [Greek:\r\n  nomos], is first found in Hesiod, but not in a specially legal sense\r\n  (e.g. _Op._ 276).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The trial scene.\r\n\r\nA trial for homicide is one of the scenes represented on the shield of\r\nAchilles (_Il._ xviii. 497-508). The folk are here to be seen thronging\r\nthe market-place, where a strife has arisen between two men as to the\r\nprice of a man that has been slain. The slayer vows that he has paid all\r\n([Greek: eucheto pant' apodounai]), the kinsman of the slain protests\r\nthat he has received nothing ([Greek: anaineto meden helesthai]); both\r\nare eager to join issue before an umpire, and both are favoured by their\r\nfriends among the folk, who are kept back by the heralds. The cause is\r\ntried by the elders, who are seated on polished stones in a sacred\r\ncircle, and in the midst there lie two talents of gold, \"to give to him\r\nwho, among them all, sets forth the cause most rightly\" ([Greek: to\r\ndomen hos meta toisi diken ithyntata eipoi]).\r\n\r\n  The discussions of the above passage have chiefly turned on two\r\n  points: (1) the legal questions at issue; and (2) the destination of\r\n  the \"two talents.\" (1) In the ordinary view (a), it is solely a\r\n  question whether the fine or blood-money, corresponding to the\r\n  _Wergeld_ (see WERGELD, TEUTONIC PEOPLES, BRITAIN: _Anglo-Saxon_) of\r\n  the old Germanic law (Grimm, _Rechtsalterthumer_, 661 f.), has been\r\n  paid or not. (This is accepted by Thonissen, Lipsius, Sidgwick and\r\n  Ridgeway.) In the other view (b), it is held that the slayer \"claimed\r\n  to pay\" the fine, and the kinsman of the slain \"refused to accept any\r\n  compensation\" (so Passow and Leaf, approved by Pollock). (2) The \"two\r\n  talents\" (shown by Ridgeway to be a small sum, equal in value to two\r\n  oxen) are awarded either (a) to the litigant who \"pleads his cause\r\n  most justly before them\" (so Thonissen, Shilleto and Lipsius, in\r\n  accordance with the Attic use of phrases like [Greek: diken eipein]),\r\n  or (b) to the judge \"who, among all the elders, gives the most\r\n  righteous judgment\" (so Maine, approved by Sidgwick, Pollock, Leaf and\r\n  Ridgeway).\r\n\r\n  On this controversy, cf. Maine's _Ancient Law_, chap. x. pp. 385 f.,\r\n  405 f., ed. Pollock; Thonissen, _Droit penal_ (1875), 27; P. M.\r\n  Laurence (on Shilleto's view) in _Journal of Philology_, viii. (1879),\r\n  125 f.; Ridgeway, _ib._ x. (1882), 30 f., and _Journal of Hellenic\r\n  Studies_, viii. (1887), 133 f.; and Leaf, _ib._ viii. 122 f., and in\r\n  his Commentary on _Iliad_, ii. (1902), 610-614; also J. H. Lipsius in\r\n  _Leipziger Studien_, xii. (1890), 225-231, criticized by H. Sidgwick\r\n  in _Classical Review_, viii. (1894), 1-4.\r\n\r\nWe are told elsewhere in Homer that sometimes a man accepted blood-money\r\nfrom the slayer of his brother or his son, and that the slayer remained\r\nin the land after paying this penalty (_Il._ ix. 633). As a rule the\r\nslayer found it safest to flee (_Od._ xxiii. 118 f.), but even so, he\r\nmight be pursued by the friends of the slain (_Od._ xv. 272-278). If he\r\nremained, the land was not (as in later ages) deemed to be polluted by\r\nhis presence. In Homer, Orestes does not slay Clytaemestra, and he needs\r\nno \"purification\" for slaying Aegisthus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Greek lawgivers: Lycurgus at Sparta.\r\n\r\nThe laws of Sparta are ascribed to the legislation of Lycurgus, whose\r\ntraditional date is 884 B.C. Written laws are said to have been\r\nexpressly forbidden by Lycurgus (Plutarch, _Lycurgus_, 13); hence the\r\n\"laws of Sparta\" are simply a body of traditional observances. We learn\r\nthat all trials for homicide came before the Council of Elders and\r\nlasted for several days, and that all civil causes were tried by the\r\nephors (q.v.). We are also told that originally the land was equally\r\ndivided among the citizens of Sparta, and that this equality was\r\nenforced by law (Polybius vi. 45-46). Early in the 4th century the ephor\r\nEpitadeus, owing to a disagreement with his son, enacted that every\r\nSpartan should be allowed to transfer his estate and his allotment to\r\nany other person (Plutarch, _Agis_, 5), while Aristotle, in a\r\nmuch-debated passage of the _Politics_ (ii. 9. 14-15), criticizes the\r\nSpartan constitution for allowing the accumulation of property in a few\r\nhands, an evil aggravated by the large number of \"heiresses\"; \"a man (he\r\nadds) may bestow his heiress on any one he pleases; and, if he dies\r\nintestate, this privilege descends to his heir.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Era of written laws.\r\n\r\nLaw was first reduced to writing in the 7th century B.C. A written code\r\nis a necessary condition of just judgment, and such a code was the first\r\nconcession which the people in the Greek cities extorted from the ruling\r\naristocracies. The change was generally effected with the aid of a\r\nsingle legislator entrusted with complete authority to draw up a code.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Zaleucus at Locri Epizephyrii.\r\n\r\n  Charondas at Catana, etc.\r\n\r\n  Androdamas of Rhegium.\r\n\r\n  Philolaus of Corinth.\r\n\r\nThe first communities to reach this stage of progress were the Greek\r\ncolonies in the West. The Epizephyrian Locrians, near the extreme south\r\nof Italy, received the earliest written code from Zaleucus (663 B.C.),\r\nwhose strict and severe legislation put an end to a period of strife and\r\nconfusion, though we know little of his laws, except that they attached\r\ndefinite penalties to each offence, and that they strictly protected the\r\nrights of property. Two centuries later, his code was adopted even by\r\nthe Athenian colony of Thurii in south Italy (443 B.C.). Charondas, the\r\n\"disciple\" of Zaleucus, became the lawgiver, not only of his native town\r\nof Catana on the east coast of Sicily, but also of other Chalcidian\r\ncolonies in Sicily and Italy. The laws of Charondas were marked by a\r\nsingular precision, but there was nothing (says Aristotle) that he could\r\nclaim as his own except the special procedure against false witnesses\r\n(_Politics_, ii. 12. 11). In the case of judges who neglected to serve\r\nin the law courts, he inflicted a large fine on the rich and a small\r\nfine on the poor (_ib._ vi. (iv.) 13. 2). Androdamas of Rhegium gave\r\nlaws on homicide and on heiresses to the Chalcidians of Thrace, while\r\nPhilolaus of Corinth provided the Thebans with \"laws of adoption\" with a\r\nview to preventing any change in the number of the allotments of land\r\n(_ib._ ii. 12. 8-14).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The laws of Gortyn.\r\n\r\nLocal legislation in Crete is represented by the laws of the important\r\ncity of Gortyn, which lies to the south of Ida in a plain watered by the\r\nLethaeus. Part of that stream forms a sluice for a water-mill, and at or\r\nnear this mill some fragmentary inscriptions were found by French\r\narchaeologists in 1857 and 1879. The great inscription, to which most of\r\nour knowledge of the laws is due, was not discovered until 1884. It had\r\nbeen preserved on a wall 27 ft. long and 5 ft. high, the larger part of\r\nwhich was buried in the ground, while its farthest extremity passed\r\nobliquely athwart the bed of the mill-stream. It was necessary to divert\r\nthe water before the last four columns could be transcribed by the\r\nItalian scholar, Federico Halbherr, whose work was completed in the same\r\nyear by the excavation and transcription of the first eight columns by\r\nthe German scholar, E. Fabricius. In the following year Halbherr\r\ndiscovered more than eighty small fragments on the neighbouring site of\r\na former temple of the Pythian Apollo.\r\n\r\n  These fragments, which are far earlier than the great inscription\r\n  above-mentioned, have been assigned to about 650 B.C. They precede the\r\n  introduction of coined money into Crete, the penalties being reckoned,\r\n  not in coins, but in caldrons. They deal with the powers of the\r\n  magistrates and the observances of religion, but are mainly concerned\r\n  with private matters of barter and sale, dowry and adoption,\r\n  inheritance and succession, fines for trespass and questions of\r\n  blood-money. As in the code of Zaleucus, we have a fixed scale of\r\n  penalties, including the fine of a single tripod, and ranging from one\r\n  to a hundred caldrons.\r\n\r\n  The great inscription is perhaps two centuries later (c. 450 B.C.). It\r\n  consists of a number of amendments or additions to an earlier code,\r\n  and it deals exclusively with private law, in which the family and\r\n  family property occupy the largest part. The procedure is entirely\r\n  oral; oaths and other oral testimony are alone admitted; there are no\r\n  documentary proofs, and no record of the verdict except in the memory\r\n  of the judge or of his \"remembrancer.\" All the causes are tried before\r\n  a single judge, who varies according to the nature of the suit. Where\r\n  the law specially enjoins it, he is bound to give judgment ([Greek:\r\n  dikadden]) in accordance with the law and the \"witnesses or oaths,\"\r\n  but, in other cases, he is permitted to take oath and decide ([Greek:\r\n  krinein]) in view of \"the contentions of the parties,\" as\r\n  distinguished from \"the declarations of the witnesses.\" Offences\r\n  against the person are treated as matters of private compensation\r\n  according to a carefully graduated tariff. In certain cases the\r\n  defendant may clear himself by an \"oath of purgation\" with the support\r\n  of \"cojurors\" ([Greek: homomotai]), the _Eideshelfer_ of old Germanic\r\n  law (Grimm 859 f.), who have no necessary knowledge of the facts.\r\n  There is no interference with the exposure of infants, except in the\r\n  interest of the father (if the child is free-born) or of the lord (in\r\n  the case of serfs). The law of debt is primitive, though less severe\r\n  than that of the early Romans. In contrast with these primitive\r\n  elements we have others which are distinctly progressive. The estates\r\n  of husband, wife and sons are regarded as absolutely distinct. Wills\r\n  are unknown, even in their most restricted form. Elaborate provisions\r\n  are made to secure with all speed the marriage of an \"heiress\"; she is\r\n  bound to marry the eldest of her paternal uncles or to surrender part\r\n  of her estate, and it is only if there are no paternal uncles that she\r\n  is permitted to marry one (and that the eldest) of their sons.\r\n  Adoption is made by the simple procedure of mounting a block of stone\r\n  in the market-place and making a public announcement at a time when\r\n  the citizens are assembled. The adopted son does not inherit any\r\n  larger share than that of a daughter. Any one who desires to repudiate\r\n  his adopted son makes a public announcement as before, and the person\r\n  repudiated receives, by way of nominal compensation, the gift of a\r\n  small number of staters. In these later \"laws of Gortyn\" we have\r\n  reached the time when payments are made, not in \"caldrons,\" but in\r\n  coins. In the inscription itself the laws are simply described as\r\n  \"these writings.\"\r\n\r\n  The text of the great inscription was first published by E. Fabricius\r\n  in _Ath. Mitth._ ix. (1885), 362-384; there is a cast of the whole in\r\n  the Cambridge Museum of Classical Archaeology. Cf. Comparetti's _Leggi\r\n  di Gortyna_ (1893); Bucheler and Zittelmann in _Rhein.

Hist._ iii. 38), and the Athenians themselves regarded\r\ntheir tribunals of homicide as institutions of immemorial antiquity\r\n(Isocr. _Paneg._ 40). On the abolition of the single decennial\r\narchon[1] in 683 B.C., his duties were distributed over several\r\nofficials holding office for one year only. The judicial duties\r\nthenceforth discharged by the chief archon (_the_ archon), in the case\r\nof citizens, were discharged by the polemarch in the case of foreign\r\nsettlers or metics ([Greek: metoikoi]); while the king-archon, who\r\nsucceeded to the religious functions of the ancient kings, decided cases\r\nconnected with religious observances (see ARCHON). He also presided over\r\nthe primitive council of the state, which was identical with the council\r\nof the Areopagus. It was possibly with a view to the recognition of the\r\nrights of the lower classes that, about the middle of the 7th century\r\nB.C., the three archons were raised to the number of nine by the\r\ninstitution of the joint board of the six _thesmothetae_, who\r\nsuperintended the judicial system in general, kept a record of all legal\r\ndecisions, and drew attention to any defects in the laws. It is probable\r\nthat in their title we have the earliest example in Attic Greek of the\r\nuse of _thesmos_ in the sense of \"law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Draco.\r\n\r\nThe constitution was at this time thoroughly oligarchical. With a view,\r\nhowever, to providing a remedy for the conflict between the several\r\norders of the state, the first code of Athenian law was drawn up and\r\npublished by Draco (strictly Dracon), who is definitely described as a\r\n_thesmothetes_ (621). His laws were known as _thesmoi_. The distinctive\r\npart of his legislation was the law of homicide, which was held in such\r\nhigh esteem that it was left unaltered in the legislation of Solon and\r\nin the democratic restoration of 411 B.C. It is partly preserved in an\r\ninscription of 409, which has been restored with the aid of quotations\r\nfrom the orators (_C.I.A._ i. 61; _Inscr. jurid. grecques_, ii. 1. 1-24;\r\nand Hicks, _Gk. Hist. Inscr._ No. 59). It drew a careful distinction\r\nbetween different kinds of homicide. Of the rest of Draco's legislation\r\nwe only know that Aristotle (_Politics_, ii. 12, 13) was struck by the\r\nseverity of the penalties, and that the creditor was permitted to seize\r\nthe person of the debtor as security for his debt.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Solon.\r\n\r\nThe conflict of the orders was not allayed until both parties agreed in\r\nchoosing Solon as mediator and as archon (594 B.C.). Solon cancelled all\r\nmortgages and debts secured on the person of the debtor, set free all\r\nwho had become slaves for debt, and forbade such slavery for the future\r\n(see SOLON). Thenceforth every citizen had also \"the right of appeal to\r\nthe law-courts,\" and the privilege of claiming legal satisfaction on\r\nbehalf of any one who was wronged. Cases of constitutional law (_inter\r\nalia_) came before large law-courts numbering hundreds of jurors, and\r\nthe power of voting in these law-courts made the people masters of the\r\nconstitution (Aristotle's _Constitution of Athens_, c. 9). Solon's\r\nlegislation also had an important effect on the law of property. In\r\nprimitive times, on a man's death, his money or lands remained in the\r\nfamily, and, even in the absence of direct descendants, the owner could\r\nnot dispose of his property by will. Permission to execute a will was\r\nfirst given to Athenian citizens by the laws of Solon. But \"the Athenian\r\nWill was only an inchoate Testament\" (Maine's _Ancient Law_, c. vi.);\r\nfor this permission was expressly limited to those citizens who had no\r\ndirect male descendants (Dem. _Lept._ 102; Plutarch, _Solon_, 21; cf.\r\nWyse on Isaeus, p. 325).\r\n\r\nThe law of intestate succession is imperfectly preserved in [Dem.] 43, S\r\n51 (cf. Wyse, _ib._ p. 562 f.). In the absence of direct male\r\ndescendants, a daughter who survived her father was known as an [Greek:\r\nepikleros], not an \"heiress,\" but a \"person who went with the estate\";\r\nand, in the absence of a will, the right or duty of marrying the\r\ndaughter followed (with certain obvious exceptions) the same rules as\r\nthe right of succession to the estate (cf. Wyse, _ib._ p. 348 f.).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cleisthenes, Ephialtes.\r\n\r\n  Pericles, Cleon.\r\n\r\nAmong the reforms of Cleisthenes (508) was the law of ostracism (q.v.).\r\nThe privileges of the Areopagus were curtailed (while its right to try\r\ncertain cases of homicide was left untouched) by the reforms of\r\nEphialtes (462), and of Pericles, who also restored the thirty \"local\r\njustices\" (453), limited the franchise to those of citizen-blood by both\r\nparents (451), and was the first to assign to jurors a fee for their\r\nservices in the law-courts, which was raised to three obols by Cleon\r\n(425).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ordinary course of legislation.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to legislative reforms brought about by lawgivers entrusted\r\nwith special authority, such as Draco, Solon and Cleisthenes, there was\r\nthe regular and normal course of public legislation. The legislative\r\npower was not exercised directly by the popular assembly (see ECCLESIA),\r\nbut the preliminary consent of that body was necessary for the\r\nappointment of a legislative commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Syngrapheis. Nomothetae.\r\n\r\nIn the 5th century (e.g. in 450 and 446 B.C.) certain commissioners\r\ncalled [Greek: syngrapheis] were appointed to draw up laws which, after\r\napproval by the council, were submitted to the assembly. The same term\r\nwas still in use in March 411 (Thuc. viii. 61). But in October, on the\r\noverthrow of the Four Hundred, the commissioners are for the first time\r\ncalled _nomothetae_ (_ib._ 97).\r\n\r\n  The procedure in ordinary legislation was as follows. At the first\r\n  meeting of the assembly in the year, the people was asked whether it\r\n  would permit motions to be made for altering or supplementing the\r\n  existing laws. A debate ensued, and, if such permission were granted,\r\n  any citizen who wished to make a motion to the above effect was\r\n  required to publish his proposals in the market-place, and to hand\r\n  them to the secretary of the council (Boule) to be read aloud at more\r\n  than one meeting of the assembly. At the third regular meeting the\r\n  people appointed the legislative commissioners, who were drawn by lot\r\n  from the whole number of those then qualified to act as jurors. The\r\n  number, and the duration of the commission, were determined in each\r\n  case by the people. The proceedings before the commission were\r\n  conducted exactly in the manner of a lawsuit. Those who desired to see\r\n  old laws repealed, altered or replaced by new laws came forward as\r\n  _accusers_ of those laws; those of the contrary opinion, as\r\n  _defenders_; and the defence was formally entrusted to public\r\n  advocates specially appointed for the purpose ([Greek: sunegoroi]).\r\n  The number of the commissioners varied with the number or importance\r\n  of the laws in question; there is evidence for the number 1001 (Dem.\r\n  xxiv. 27). If a law approved by the commission was deemed to be\r\n  unconstitutional, the proposer was liable to be prosecuted (by a\r\n  [Greek: graphe paranomon]), just as in the case of the proposer of an\r\n  unconstitutional decree in the public assembly. Formal proceedings\r\n  might also be instituted against laws on the sole ground of their\r\n  inexpediency (see note on Aristotle's _Constitution of Athens_, p.\r\n  219, ed. Sandys). A prosecutor who (like Aeschines in his indictment\r\n  of Ctesiphon) failed to obtain one-fifth of the votes was fined 1000\r\n  _drachmae_ (L40), and lost the right to adopt this procedure in\r\n  future. When a year had elapsed, the proposer of a law or a decree was\r\n  free from personal responsibility. This was the case with Leptines,\r\n  but the law itself could still be attacked, and, in this event, five\r\n  advocates were appointed to defend it ([Greek: sundikoi]), cf. Dem.\r\n  _Lept._ 144, 146.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The laws of Athens.\r\n\r\nLimits of space make it impossible to include in the present article any\r\nsurvey of the purport of the extant remains of the laws of Athens. Such\r\na survey would begin with the laws of the family, including laws of\r\nmarriage, adoption and inheritance, followed by the law of property and\r\ncontracts, and the laws for the protection of life, the protection of\r\nthe person, and the protection of the constitution. The texts have been\r\ncollected and classified in Telfy's _Corpus juris Attici_ (1867), a work\r\nwhich can be supplemented or corrected with the aid of Aristotle's\r\n_Constitution of Athens_; while some of the recent expositions of the\r\nsubject are mentioned in the bibliography at the end of this article. We\r\nnow proceed to notice the law of homicide, but solely in connexion with\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jurisdiction; the five primitive tribunals for the trial of homicide.\r\n\r\nThe general term for a tribunal is [Greek: dikasterion] (from [Greek:\r\ndikazo]), Anglicized \"dicastery.\" Of all the tribunals of Athens those\r\nfor the trial of homicide were at once the most primitive and the least\r\nliable to suffer change through lapse of time. In the old Germanic law\r\nall trials whatsoever were held in the open air (Grimm 793 f.). At\r\nAthens this custom was characteristic of all the five primitive courts\r\nof homicide, the object being to prevent the prosecutor and the judges\r\nfrom coming under the same roof as one who was charged with the shedding\r\nof blood (Antiphon, _De caede Herodis_, 11). The place where the trial\r\nwas held depended on the nature of the charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n    On the Areopagus.\r\n\r\n  1. The rock of the Acropolis, outside the earliest of the city-walls,\r\n  was the proper place for the trial of persons charged with\r\n  premeditated homicide, or with wounding with intent to kill. The\r\n  penalty for the former crime was death; for the latter exile; and, in\r\n  either case, the property was confiscated. If the votes were equal,\r\n  the person accused was acquitted. The proceedings lasted for three\r\n  days, and each side might make two speeches. After the first speech\r\n  the person accused of premeditated homicide was mercifully permitted\r\n  to go into exile, in which case his property was confiscated, and in\r\n  the ordinary course he remained in exile for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n    At the Palladion.\r\n\r\n  2. Charges of unpremeditated homicide, or of instigating another to\r\n  inflict bodily harm on a third person, or of killing a slave or a\r\n  resident alien or a foreigner, were tried at the Palladion, the\r\n  ancient shrine of Pallas, east of the city-walls. The punishment for\r\n  unpremeditated homicide was exile (without confiscation) until such\r\n  time as the criminal had propitiated the relatives of the person\r\n  slain, or (failing that) for some definite time. The punishment for\r\n  instigating a crime was the same as for actually committing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    At the Delphinion.\r\n\r\n  3. Trials at the Delphinion, the shrine of Apollo Delphinios, in the\r\n  same quarter, were reserved for special cases of either accidental or\r\n  justifiable homicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n    At Phreatto.\r\n\r\n  4. If a man already in exile for unpremeditated homicide were accused\r\n  of premeditated homicide, or of wounding with intent to kill,\r\n  provision was made for this rare contingency by permitting him to\r\n  approach the shore of Attica and conduct his defence on board a boat,\r\n  while his judges heard the cause on shore, at a \"place of pits\" called\r\n  Phreatto, near the harbour of Zea. If the accused were found guilty,\r\n  he incurred the proper penalty; if acquitted, he remained in exile.\r\n\r\n\r\n    At the Prytaneum.\r\n\r\n  5. The court in the precincts of the Prytaneum, to the north of the\r\n  Acropolis, was only of ceremonial importance. It \"solemnly heard and\r\n  condemned undiscovered murderers, and animals or inanimate objects\r\n  that had caused the loss of life.\"[2] The writ ran \"against the doer\r\n  of the deed,\" and any instrument of death that was found guilty was\r\n  thrown across the frontier. The trial was held by the four\r\n  \"tribe-kings\" ([Greek: phylobasileis]), an archaic survival from\r\n  before the time of Cleisthenes. (On these five courts see Aristotle's\r\n  _Constitution of Athens_, c. 57, and Dem. _Aristocr._ 65-79.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ephetae.\r\n\r\n  In all the courts of homicide the president was the archon-basileus,\r\n  or king-archon, who on these occasions laid aside his crown.\r\n  Originally all these courts were under the jurisdiction of an ancient\r\n  body of judges called the ephetae ([Greek: ephetai]), whose\r\n  institution was ascribed to Draco. The transfer of the first of the\r\n  above courts to the council of the Areopagus is attributed to Solon.\r\n  In practice the jurisdiction of the ephetae (see also AREOPAGUS) was\r\n  probably confined to the courts at the Palladion and Delphinion; but\r\n  even there the rights of this primitive body became obsolete, for\r\n  trials \"at the Palladion\" sometimes came before an ordinary tribunal\r\n  of 500 or 700 jurors (Isocr. _c. Callim._ 52, 54; [Dem.] _c. Neaeram_,\r\n  10).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The presidents of the tribunals.\r\n\r\n  The chief archon.\r\n\r\n  The king-archon.\r\n\r\n  The polemarch.\r\n\r\n  The strategi.\r\n\r\n  The thesmothetae.\r\n\r\nExcept in the case of the primitive courts of homicide, the right of\r\njurisdiction was entrusted to the several archons until the date of\r\nSolon (594). When the direct jurisdiction of the archons was impaired by\r\nSolon's institution of the \"right of appeal to the law-courts,\" the\r\ndignity of those officials was recognized by their having the privilege\r\nof presiding over the new tribunals ([Greek: hegemonia dikasteriou]). A\r\nsimilar position was assigned to the other executive officers, such as\r\nthe strategi (generals), the board of police called the \"Eleven,\" and\r\nthe financial officers, all of whom presided over cases connected with\r\ntheir respective departments. In their new position as presidents of the\r\nseveral courts, the archons received plaints, obtained from both parties\r\nthe evidence which they proposed to present, formally presided at the\r\ntrial, and gave instructions for the execution of the sentence. The\r\nchoice of the presiding magistrate in each case was determined by the\r\nnormal duties of his office. Thus the chief archon, the official\r\nguardian of orphans and widows, presided in all cases, public or\r\nprivate, connected with the family property of citizens (Aristotle,\r\n_u.s._ c. 56). The king-archon had charge of all offences against\r\nreligion, e.g. indictments for impiety, disputes within the family as to\r\nthe right to hold a particular priesthood, and all actions for homicide\r\n(c. 57). The third archon, the polemarch, discharged in relation to\r\nresident aliens all such legal duties as were discharged by the chief\r\narchon in relation to citizens (c. 58). The trial of military offences\r\nwas under the presidency of the strategi, who were assisted by the other\r\nmilitary officers in preparing the case for the court. The six junior\r\narchons, the _thesmothetae_, acted as a board which was responsible for\r\nall cases not specially assigned to any other officials (details in c.\r\n59).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Forty.\r\n\r\nThe Forty, who were appointed by lot, four for each of the ten tribes,\r\nacted as sole judges in petty cases where the damages claimed did not\r\nexceed ten _drachmae_. Claims beyond that amount they handed over to the\r\narbitrators. The four representatives of any given tribe received notice\r\nof such claims brought against members of that tribe. It seems probable\r\nthat they dealt with all private suits not otherwise assigned, but,\r\nunlike the archons, they did not prepare any case for the court but\r\nreferred it, in the first instance, to a public arbitrator appointed by\r\nlot (c. 53).[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The public arbitrators.\r\n\r\nThe public arbitrators ([Greek: diaitetai]) were a body including all\r\nAthenian citizens in the sixtieth year of their age. The arbitrator, on\r\nreceiving the case from the four representatives of the Forty, first\r\nendeavoured to bring the parties to an agreement. If this failed, he\r\nheard the evidence and gave a decision. If the decision were accepted,\r\nthe case was at an end, but, if either of the two parties insisted on\r\nappealing to a law-court, the arbitrator placed in two caskets (one for\r\neach party) copies of all the depositions, oaths and challenges, and of\r\nall the laws quoted in the case, sealed them up, and, after attaching a\r\ncopy of his own decision, handed them over to the four representatives\r\nof the Forty, who brought the case into court and presided over the\r\ntrial. Documents which had not been brought before the arbitrator could\r\nnot be produced in court. The court consisted of 201 jurors where the\r\nsum in question was not more than 1000 _drachmae_ (L40); in other cases\r\nthe number of jurors was 401 (c. 53).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Eisagogeis.\r\n\r\nA small board of five appointed by lot, one for each pair of tribes, and\r\nknown as the \"introducers\" ([Greek: eisagogeis]), brought up certain of\r\nthe cases that had to be decided within a month ([Greek: emmenoi\r\ndikai]), such as actions for restitution of dowry, repayment of capital\r\nfor setting up a business, and cases connected with banking.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Heliaea.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most important of the legal tribunals, the \"dicastery\"\r\n(_par excellence_), was known as the _heliaea_. The name, which is of\r\nuncertain origin,[4] denotes not only the place where the court was held\r\nbut also the members of the court,--the _heliastae_ of Aristophanes, the\r\n_dicastae_, or [Greek: andres dikastai], of the Attic orators. During\r\nthe palmy days of the Athenian democracy, in the interval between the\r\nPersian and the Peloponnesian wars, the total number liable to serve as\r\njurors is said to have been 6000 (Aristotle, _u.s._ c. 24. 3), and this\r\nnumber was never exceeded (Aristoph. _Vesp._ 661 f.). Any Athenian\r\ncitizen in full possession of his rights, and over thirty years of age,\r\nwas entitled to be placed on the list (Aristotle, _u.s._ c. 63. 3). At\r\nthe beginning of the year the whole body of jurors assembled on the hill\r\nof Ardettos looking down on the Panathenaic Stadium, and there took a\r\nsolemn oath to the effect that they would judge according to the laws\r\nand decrees of the Athenian people and of the council of the Five\r\nHundred (Boule), and that, in cases where there were no laws, they would\r\ndecide to the best of their judgment; that they would hear both sides\r\nimpartially, and vote on the case actually before the court.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that, as the normal number of a court was 500, the\r\nmaximum number of 6000 jurors was probably divided into ten sections of\r\n500 each, with 1000 reserves. There is evidence in the 4th century for\r\ncourts of 200, 400, 500, 700 and (in important political trials)\r\nvarious multiples of 500, namely, 1000, 1500, 2000 or 2500. To some of\r\nthese numbers one juror is added; it was probably added to all, to\r\nobviate the risk of the votes being exactly equal.\r\n\r\nThe evidence as to the organization of the jurors in the early part of\r\nthe 4th century is imperfect. Passages in Aristophanes (_Ecclesiazusae_,\r\n682-688; _Plutus_, 1166 f.) imply that in 392-388 B.C. the total number\r\nwas divided into ten sections distinguished by the first ten letters of\r\nthe Greek alphabet, A to K. Every juror, on his first appointment,\r\nreceived a ticket of boxwood (or of bronze) bearing his name with that\r\nof his father and his deme, and with one of the above letters in the\r\nupper left-hand corner. Of the bronze tickets many have been found (see\r\nnotes on Aristotle's _Constitution of Athens_, c. 63, and fig. 1 in\r\nfrontispiece, ed. Sandys). These tickets formed part of the machinery\r\nfor allotting the jurors to the several courts. To guard against the\r\npossibility of bribery or other undue influence, the allotment did not\r\ntake place until immediately before the hearing of the case. Each court\r\ncontained an equal number of jurors from each of the ten tribes, and\r\nthus represented the whole body of the state. The juror, on entering the\r\ncourt assigned him, received a counter (see fig. 3 in frontispiece,\r\n_u.s._), on presenting which at the end of the day he received his fee.\r\nThe machinery for carrying out the above arrangements is minutely\r\ndescribed at the end of Aristotle's _Constitution of Athens_ (for\r\ndetails, cf. Gilbert, 397-399, Eng. trans., or Wyse in Whibley's\r\n_Companion to Greek Studies_, 387 f.).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jurisdiction of the council and assembly.\r\n\r\n  Eisangelia.\r\n\r\nThe law-courts gradually superseded most of the ancient judicial\r\nfunctions of the council and the assembly, but the council continued to\r\nhold a strict scrutiny ([Greek: dokimasia]) of candidates for office or\r\nfor other privileges, while the council itself, as well as all other\r\nofficials, had to give account ([Greek: euthyna]) on ceasing to hold\r\noffice. The council also retained the right to deal with extraordinary\r\ncrimes against the state. It was open to any citizen to bring such\r\ncrimes to the knowledge of the council in writing. The technical term\r\nfor this information, denunciation or impeachment was _eisangelia_\r\n([Greek: eisangelia]). The council could inflict a fine of 500\r\n_drachmae_ (L20), or, in important cases, refer the matter either to a\r\nlaw-court, as in the trial of Antiphon (Thuc. viii. 68), or to the\r\necclesia, as in that of Alcibiades (415 B.C.), and the strategi in\r\ncommand at Arginusae (406; Xen. _Hell._ i. 7. 19). The term [Greek:\r\neisangelia] was also applied to denunciations brought against persons\r\nwho wronged the orphan or the widow, or against a public arbitrator who\r\nhad neglected his duty (Dem. _Meidias_, 86 f.).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Probole.\r\n\r\nA \"presentation\" of criminal information ([Greek: probole]) might be\r\nlaid before the assembly with a view to obtaining its preliminary\r\nsanction for bringing the case before a judicial tribunal. Such was the\r\nmode of procedure adopted against persons who had brought malicious,\r\ngroundless or vexatious accusations, or who had violated the sanctity of\r\ncertain public festivals. The leading example of the former is the trial\r\nof the accusers who prompted the people to put to death the generals who\r\nhad won the Battle of Arginusae (Xen. _Hell._ i. 7. 34); and, of the\r\nlatter, the proceedings of Demosthenes against Meidias.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Classes of legal actions.\r\n\r\nLegal actions ([Greek: dikai]) were classified as private ([Greek:\r\nidiai]) or public ([Greek: demosiai]). The latter were also described as\r\n[Greek: graphai] or \"prosecutions,\" but some [Greek: graphai] were\r\ncalled \"private,\" when the state was regarded as only indirectly injured\r\nby a wrong done to an individual citizen (Dem. xxi. 47). A private suit\r\ncould only be brought by the man directly interested, or, in the case of\r\na slave, a ward or an alien, by the master, guardian or patron\r\nrespectively; and, if the suit were successful, the sum claimed\r\ngenerally went to the plaintiff. Public actions may be divided into\r\nordinary criminal cases, and offences against the state. As a rule they\r\ncould be instituted by any person who possessed the franchise, and the\r\npenalty was paid to the state. If the prosecutor failed to obtain\r\none-fifth of the votes, he had to pay a fine of 1000 _drachmae_ (L40),\r\nand lost the right of ever bringing a similar action.\r\n\r\nLawsuits, whether public or private, were also distinguished as [Greek:\r\ndikai kata tinos] or [Greek: pros tina], according as the defeated party\r\ncould or could not be personally punished. Actions ([Greek: agones])\r\nwere also distinguished as [Greek: agones timetoi] (\"to be assessed\"),\r\nin which the amount of damages had to be determined by the court,\r\nbecause it had not been fixed by law, and [Greek: atimetoi] (\"not to be\r\nassessed\"), in which the damages had _not_ to be determined by the\r\ncourt, because they had already been fixed by law or by special\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\nAmong special kinds of action were [Greek: apagoge], [Greek: ephegesis]\r\nand [Greek: endeixis]. These could only be employed when the offence was\r\npatent and could not be denied. In the first, the person accused was\r\nsummarily arrested by the prosecutor and haled into the presence of the\r\nproper official. In the second, the accuser took the officer with him to\r\narrest the culprit (Dem. xxii. 26). In the third, he lodged an\r\ninformation with the official, and left the latter to effect the\r\ncapture. [Greek: Phasis], a general term for many kinds of legal\r\n\"information,\" was a form of procedure specially directed against those\r\nwho injured the fiscal interests of the state, and against guardians who\r\nneglected the pecuniary interests of their wards. [Greek: Apographe] was\r\nan action for confiscating property in private hands, which was claimed\r\nas belonging to the state, the term being derived from the claimants'\r\nwritten inventory of the property in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ordinary legal procedure.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary procedure in all lawsuits, public or private, began with a\r\npersonal summons ([Greek: prosklesis]) of the defendant by the plaintiff\r\naccompanied by two witnesses ([Greek: kleteres]). If the defendant\r\nfailed to appear in court, these witnesses gave proof of the summons,\r\nand judgment went by default.\r\n\r\nThe action was begun by presenting a written statement of the case to\r\nthe magistrate who presided over trials of the class in question. If the\r\nstatement were accepted, court-fees were paid by both parties in a\r\nprivate action, and by the prosecutor alone in a public action. The\r\nmagistrate fixed a day for the preliminary investigation ([Greek:\r\nanakrisis]), and, whenever several causes were instituted at the same\r\ntime, he drew lots to determine the order in which they should be taken.\r\nHence the plaintiff was said \"to have a suit assigned him by lot\"\r\n([Greek: lanchanein diken]), a phrase practically equivalent to\r\n\"obtaining leave to bring an action.\" At the [Greek: anakrisis] the\r\nplaintiff and defendant both swore to the truth of their statements. If\r\nthe defendant raised no formal protest, the trial proceeded in regular\r\ncourse ([Greek: euthydikia]), but he might contend that the suit was\r\ninadmissible, and, to prove his point, might bring witnesses to confront\r\nthose on the side of the plaintiff ([Greek: diamartyria]), or he might\r\nrely on argument without witnesses by means of a written statement\r\ntraversing that of the plaintiff ([Greek: paragraphe]). The person who\r\nsubmitted the special plea in bar of action naturally spoke first, and,\r\nif he gained the verdict, the main suit could not come on, or, at any\r\nrate, not in the way proposed or before the same court. A cross-action\r\n([Greek: antigraphe]) might be brought by the defendant, but the verdict\r\ndid not necessarily affect that of the original suit.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Documents.\r\n\r\n  Challenges.\r\n\r\nIn the preliminary examination copies of the laws or other documents\r\nbearing on the case were produced. If any such document were in the\r\nhands of a third person, he could be compelled to produce it by an\r\naction for that purpose ([Greek: eis emphanon katastasin]). The\r\ndepositions were ordinarily made before the presiding officer and were\r\ntaken down in his presence. If a witness were compelled to be absent, a\r\ncertified copy of his deposition might be sent ([Greek: ekmartyria]).\r\nThe depositions of slaves were not accepted, unless made under torture,\r\nand for receiving such evidence the consent of both parties was\r\nrequired. Either party could challenge the other to submit his slaves to\r\nthe test ([Greek: proklesis eis basanon]), and, in the event of the\r\nchallenge being refused, could comment on the fact when the case came\r\nbefore the court. Either party could also challenge the other to take an\r\noath ([Greek: proklesis eis horkon]), and, if the oath were declined,\r\ncould similarly comment on the fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The trial.\r\n\r\nMercantile cases had to be decided within the interval of a month;\r\nothers might be postponed for due cause. If, on the day of trial, one of\r\nthe parties was absent, his representative had to show cause under oath\r\n([Greek: hupomosia]); if the other party objected, he did so under oath\r\n([Greek: anthupomosia]). If the plea for delay were refused by the\r\ncourt, and it were the defendant who failed to appear, judgment went by\r\ndefault; in the absence of the plaintiff, the case was given in favour\r\nof the defendant.\r\n\r\nThe official who had conducted the preliminary inquiry also presided at\r\nthe trial. The proceedings began with a solemn sacrifice. The plea of\r\nthe plaintiff and the formal reply of the defendant were then read by\r\nthe clerk. The court was next addressed first by the plaintiff, next by\r\nthe defendant; in some cases there were two speeches on each side. Every\r\nlitigant was legally required to conduct his own case. The speeches were\r\noften composed by professional experts for delivery by the parties to\r\nthe suit, who were required to speak in person, though one or more\r\nunprofessional supporters ([Greek: synhegoroi]) might subsequently speak\r\nin support of the case. The length of the speeches was in many cases\r\nlimited by law to a fixed time recorded by means of a water-clock\r\n(clepsydra). Documents were not regarded as part of the speech, and,\r\nwhile these were being read, the clock was stopped (Goethe found a\r\nsimilar custom in force in Venice in October 1786). The witnesses were\r\nnever cross-examined, but one of the litigants might formally\r\ninterrogate the other. The case for the defence was sometimes finally\r\nsupported by pathetic appeals on the part of relatives and friends.\r\n\r\nWhen the speeches were over, the votes were taken. In the 5th century\r\nmussel-shells ([Greek: choirinai]) were used for the purpose. Each of\r\nthe jurors received a shell, which he placed in one of the two urns, in\r\nthat to the front if he voted for acquittal; in that to the back if he\r\nvoted for condemnation. If a second vote had to be taken to determine\r\nthe amount of the penalty, wax tablets were used, on which the juror\r\ndrew a long line, if he gave the heavy penalty demanded by the\r\nplaintiff; a short one, if he decided in favour of the lighter penalty\r\nproposed by the defendant.\r\n\r\nIn the 4th century the mussel-shells were replaced by disks of bronze.\r\nEach disk (inscribed with the words [Greek: PSEPHOS DEMOSIA]) was about\r\n1 in. in diameter, with a short tube running through the centre. This\r\ntube was either perforated or closed (see figs. 6 and 7 in frontispiece\r\nto Aristotle's _Constitution of Athens_, ed. Sandys). One of each kind\r\nwas given to every juror, who was required to use the perforated or the\r\nclosed disk, according as he voted for the plaintiff or for the\r\ndefendant. On the platform there were two urns, one of bronze and one of\r\nwood. The juror placed in the hollow of his hand the disk that he\r\nproposed to use, and closed his fingers on the extremity of the tube, so\r\nthat no one could see whether it were a perforated disk or not, and then\r\ndeposited it in the bronze urn, and (with the same precaution to ensure\r\nsecrecy) dropped the unused disk into the wooden urn. The votes were\r\nsorted by persons appointed by lot, and counted by the president of the\r\ncourt, and the result announced by the herald. For any second vote the\r\nsame procedure was adopted (Aristotle, _u.s._, c. 68 of Kenyon's Berlin\r\ntext).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Penalties.\r\n\r\nPecuniary penalties were inflicted both in public and in private suits;\r\npersonal penalties, in public suits only. Personal penalties included\r\nsentences of death or exile, or different degrees of disfranchisement\r\n([Greek: atimia]) with or without confiscation. Imprisonment _before_\r\ntrial was common, and persons mulcted in penalties might be imprisoned\r\nuntil the penalties were paid, but imprisonment was never inflicted as\r\nthe _sole_ penalty after conviction. Foreigners alone could be sold into\r\nslavery. Sentences of death were carried out under the supervision of\r\nthe board of police called the \"Eleven.\" In ancient times a person\r\ncondemned was hurled into a deep pit (the barathrum) in a north-western\r\nsuburb of Athens. In later times he was compelled to drink the fatal\r\ndraught of hemlock. Common malefactors were beaten to death with clubs.\r\nFines were collected and confiscated property sold by special\r\nofficials, called [Greek: praktores] and [Greek: poletai] respectively.\r\nIn private suits the sentence was executed by the state if the latter\r\nhad a share in any fine imposed, or if imprisonment were part of the\r\npenalty. Otherwise, the execution of the sentence was left to the\r\nplaintiff, who had the right of distraint, or, if this failed, could\r\nbring an action of ejectment ([Greek: dike hexouges]).\r\n\r\nFrom the verdict of the heliaea there was no appeal. But, if judgment\r\nhad been given by default, the person condemned might bring an action to\r\nprove that he was not responsible for such default, [Greek: ten eremon]\r\n(_sc._ [Greek: diken]) [Greek: antilanchanein]. The corresponding term\r\nfor challenging the award of an arbitrator was [Greek: ten me ousan\r\nantilanchanein]. He might also bring an action for false evidence\r\n([Greek: dike pseudomartyrion]) against his opponent's witnesses, and,\r\non their conviction, have the sentence annulled. This \"denunciation\" of\r\nfalse evidence was technically called [Greek: episkepsis] and [Greek:\r\nepiskeptesthai].\r\n\r\n\r\n  Character of the Athenian tribunals.\r\n\r\nThe large number of the jurors made bribery difficult, but, as was first\r\nproved by Anytus (in 409), not impossible. It also diminished the\r\nfeeling of personal responsibility, while it increased the influence of\r\npolitical motives. In addressing such a court, the litigants were not\r\nabove appealing to the personal interests of the general public. We have\r\na striking example of this in the terms in which Lysias makes one of his\r\nclients close a speech in prosecution of certain retail corn-dealers who\r\nhave incurred the penalty of death by buying more than 75 bushels of\r\nwheat at one time: \"If you _condemn_ these persons, you will be doing\r\nwhat is right, and will pay _less_ for the purchase of your corn; if you\r\n_acquit_ them, you will pay _more_\" (xxii. S 22).\r\n\r\nSpeakers were also tempted to take advantage of the popular ignorance by\r\nmisinterpreting the enactments of the law, and the jurors could look for\r\nno aid from the officials who formally presided over the courts. The\r\nlatter were not necessarily experts, for they owed their own original\r\nappointment to the caprice of the lot. Almost the only officials\r\nspecially elected as experts were the strategi, and these presided only\r\nin their own courts. Again, there was every temptation for the informer\r\nto propose the confiscation of the property of a wealthy citizen, who\r\nwould naturally prefer paying blackmail to running the risk of having\r\nhis case tried before a large tribunal which was under every temptation\r\nto decide in the interests of the treasury. In conclusion we may quote\r\nthe opinions on the judicial system of Athens which have been expressed\r\nby two eminent classical scholars and English lawyers.\r\n\r\n  A translator of Aristophanes, Mr B. B. Rogers, records his opinion\r\n  \"that it would be difficult to devise a judicial system less adapted\r\n  for the due administration of justice\" (Preface to _Wasps_, xxxv. f.),\r\n  while a translator of Demosthenes, Mr C. R. Kennedy, observes that the\r\n  Athenian jurors \"were persons of no legal education or learning; taken\r\n  at haphazard from the whole body of citizens, and mostly belonging to\r\n  the lowest and poorest class. On the other hand, the Athenians were\r\n  naturally the quickest and cleverest people in the world. Their wits\r\n  were sharpened by the habit ... of taking an active part in important\r\n  debates, and hearing the most splendid orators. There was so much\r\n  litigation at Athens that they were constantly either engaged as\r\n  jurors, or present as spectators in courts of law\" (_Private\r\n  Orations_, p. 361).\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--1.

These are dealt with below in that order.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE ANCIENT GREEK LITERATURE\r\n\r\nThe ancient literature falls into three periods: (A) _The Early\r\nLiterature_, to about 475 B.C.; epic, elegiac, iambic and lyric poetry;\r\nthe beginnings of literary prose. (B) _The Attic Literature_ 475-300\r\nB.C.; tragic and comic drama; historical, oratorical and philosophical\r\nprose. (C) _The Literature of the Decadence_, 300 B.C. to A.D. 529;\r\nwhich may again be divided into the Alexandrian period, 300-146 B.C.,\r\nand the Graeco-Roman period, 146 B.C. to A.D. 529.\r\n\r\nFor details regarding particular works or the lives of their authors\r\nreference should be made to the separate articles devoted to the\r\nprincipal Greek writers. The object of the following pages is to sketch\r\nthe literary development as a whole, to show how its successive periods\r\nwere related to each other, and to mark the dominant characteristics of\r\neach.\r\n\r\n(A) _The Early Literature._--A process of natural growth may be traced\r\nthrough all the best work of the Greek genius. The Greeks were not\r\nliterary imitators of foreign models; the forms of poetry and prose in\r\nwhich they attained to such unequalled excellence were first developed\r\nby themselves. Their literature had its roots in their political and\r\nsocial life; it is the spontaneous expression of that life in youth,\r\nmaturity and decay; and the order in which its several fruits are\r\nproduced is not the result of accident or caprice. Further, the old\r\nGreek literature has a striking completeness, due to the fact that each\r\ngreat branch of the Hellenic race bore a characteristic part in its\r\ndevelopment. Ionians, Aeolians, Dorians, in turn contributed their\r\nshare. Each dialect corresponded to a certain aspect of Hellenic life\r\nand character. Each found its appropriate work.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The dialects.\r\n\r\nThe Ionians on the coast of Asia Minor--a lively and genial people,\r\ndelighting in adventure, and keenly sensitive to everything bright and\r\njoyous--created artistic epic poetry out of the lays in which Aeolic\r\nminstrels sang of the old Achaean wars. And among the Ionians arose\r\nelegiac poetry, the first variation on the epic type. These found a\r\nfitting instrument in the harmonious Ionic dialect, the flexible\r\nutterance of a quick and versatile intelligence. The Aeolians of Lesbos\r\nnext created the lyric of personal passion, in which the traits of their\r\nrace--its chivalrous pride, its bold but sensuous fancy--found a fitting\r\nvoice in the fiery strength and tenderness of Aeolic speech. The Dorians\r\nof the Peloponnesus, Sicily and Magna Graecia then perfected the choral\r\nlyric for festivals and religious worship; and here again an earnest\r\nfaith, a strong pride in Dorian usage and renown had an apt interpreter\r\nin the massive and sonorous Doric. Finally, the Attic branch of the\r\nIonian stock produced the drama, blending elements of all the other\r\nkinds, and developed an artistic literary prose in history, oratory and\r\nphilosophy. It is in the Attic literature that the Greek mind receives\r\nits most complete interpretation.\r\n\r\nA natural affinity was felt to exist between each dialect and that\r\nspecies of composition for which it had been specially used. Hence the\r\ndialect of the Ionian epic poets would be adopted with more or less\r\nthoroughness even by epic or elegiac poets who were not Ionians. Thus\r\nthe Aeolian Hesiod uses it in epos, the Dorian Theognis in elegy, though\r\nnot without alloy. Similarly, the Dorian Theocritus wrote love-songs in\r\nAeolic. All the faculties and tones of the language were thus gradually\r\nbrought out by the co-operation of the dialects. Old Greek literature\r\nhas an essential unity--the unity of a living organism; and this unity\r\ncomprehends a number of distinct types, each of which is complete in its\r\nown kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pre-Homeric poetry.\r\n\r\n  Songs of the seasons.\r\n\r\n  Hymns.\r\n\r\nExtant Greek literature begins with the Homeric poems. These are works\r\nof art which imply a long period of antecedent poetical cultivation. Of\r\nthe pre-Homeric poetry we have no remains, and very little knowledge.\r\nSuch glimpses as we get of it connect it with two different stages in\r\nthe religion of the prehistoric Hellenes. The first of these stages is\r\nthat in which the agencies or forms of external nature were personified\r\nindeed, yet with the consciousness that the personal names were only\r\nsymbols. Some very ancient Greek songs of which mention is made may have\r\nbelonged to this stage--as the songs of Linus, Ialemus and Hylas. Linus,\r\nthe fair youth killed by dogs, seems to be the spring passing away\r\nbefore Sirius. Such songs have been aptly called \"songs of the seasons.\"\r\nThe second stage is that in which the Hellenes have now definitively\r\npersonified the powers which they worship. Apollo, Demeter, Dionysus,\r\nCybele, have now become to them beings with clearly conceived\r\nattributes. To this second stage belong the hymns connected with the\r\nnames of the legendary bards, such as Orpheus, Musaeus, Eumolpus, who\r\nare themselves associated with the worship of the Pierian Muses and the\r\nAttic ritual of Demeter. The seats of this early sacred poetry are not\r\nonly \"Thracian\"--i.e. on the borders of northern Greece--but also\r\n\"Phrygian\" and \"Cretan.\" It belongs, that is, presumably to an age when\r\nthe ancestors of the Hellenes had left the Indo-European home in central\r\nAsia, but had not yet taken full possession of the lands which were\r\nafterwards Hellenic. Some of their tribes were still in Asia; others\r\nwere settling in the islands of the Aegean; others were passing through\r\nthe lands on its northern seaboard. If there was a period when the\r\nGreeks possessed no poetry but hymns forming part of a religious ritual,\r\nit may be conjectured that it was not of long duration. Already in the\r\n_Iliad_ a secular character belongs to the marriage hymn and to the\r\ndirge for the dead, which in ancient India were chanted by the priest.\r\nThe bent of the Greeks was to claim poetry and music as public joys;\r\nthey would not long have suffered them to remain sacerdotal mysteries.\r\nAnd among the earliest themes on which the lay artist in poetry was\r\nemployed were probably war-ballads, sung by minstrels in the houses of\r\nthe chiefs whose ancestors they celebrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Epos.\r\n\r\nSuch war-ballads were the materials from which the earliest epic poetry\r\nof Greece was constructed. By an \"epic\" poem the Greeks meant a\r\nnarrative of heroic action in hexameter verse. The term [Greek: epe]\r\nmeant at first simply \"verses\"; it acquired its special meaning only\r\nwhen [Greek: mele], lyric songs set to music, came to be distinguished\r\nfrom [Greek: epe] verses not set to music, but merely recited. Epic\r\npoetry is the only kind of extant Greek poetry which is older than about\r\n700 B.C. The early epos of Greece is represented by the _Iliad_ and the\r\n_Odyssey_, Hesiod and the Homeric hymns; also by some fragments of the\r\n\"Cyclic\" poets.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Dorian conquest of the Peloponnesus, the Aeolian emigrants who\r\nsettled in the north-west of Asia Minor brought with them the warlike\r\nlegends of their chiefs, the Achaean princes of old. These legends lived\r\nin the ballads of the Aeolic minstrels, and from them passed southward\r\ninto Ionia, where the Ionian poets gradually shaped them into higher\r\nartistic forms. Among the seven places which claimed to be the\r\nbirthplace of Homer, that which has the best title is Smyrna. Homer\r\nhimself is called \"son of Meles\"--the stream which flowed through old\r\nSmyrna, on the border between Aeolia and Ionia. The tradition is\r\nsignificant in regard to the origin and character of the _Iliad_, for in\r\nthe _Iliad_ we have Achaean ballads worked up by Ionian art. A\r\npreponderance of evidence is in favour of the view that the _Odyssey_\r\nalso, at least in its earliest form, was composed on the Ionian coast of\r\nAsia Minor. According to the Spartan account, Lycurgus was the first to\r\nbring to Greece a complete copy of the Homeric poems, which he had\r\nobtained from the Creophylidae, a clan or gild of poets in Samos. A\r\nbetter authenticated tradition connects Athens with early attempts to\r\npreserve the chief poetical treasure of the nation. Peisistratus is said\r\nto have charged some learned men with the task of collecting all \"the\r\npoems of Homer\"; but it is difficult to decide how much was comprehended\r\nunder this last phrase, or whether the province of the commission went\r\nbeyond the mere task of collecting. Nor can it be determined what\r\nexactly it was that Solon and Hipparchus respectively did for the\r\nHomeric poems. Solon, it has been thought, enacted that the poems should\r\nbe recited from an authorized text ([Greek: ex hypoboles]); Hipparchus,\r\nthat they should be recited in a regular order ([Greek: ex\r\nhypolepseos]). At any rate, we know that in the 6th century B.C. a\r\nrecitation of the poems of Homer was one of the established competitions\r\nat the Panathenaea, held once in four years. The reciter was called a\r\n_rhapsodist_--properly one who weaves a long, smoothly-flowing chant,\r\nthen an epic poet who chants his own or another's poem. The rhapsodist\r\ndid not, like the early minstrel, use the accompaniment of the harp; he\r\ngave the verses in a flowing recitative, bearing in his hand a branch of\r\nlaurel, the symbol of Apollo's inspiration. In the 5th century B.C. we\r\nfind that various Greek cities had their own editions ([Greek: hai\r\npolitikai, kata poleis] or [Greek: ek poleon ekdoseis]) of the poems,\r\nfor recitation at their festivals. Among these were the editions of\r\nMassilia, of Chios and of Argolis. There were also editions bearing the\r\nname of the individual editor ([Greek: hai kat' andra])--the best known\r\nbeing that which Aristotle prepared for Alexander. The recension of the\r\npoems by Aristarchus (156 B.C.) became the standard one, and is probably\r\nthat on which the existing text is based. The oldest Homeric MS. extant,\r\nVenetus A of the _Iliad_, is of the 10th century; the first printed\r\nedition of Homer was that edited by the Byzantine Demetrius Chalcondyles\r\n(Florence, 1488).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Homeric question.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks were almost unanimous in believing the _Iliad_ and\r\nthe _Odyssey_ to be the work of one man, Homer, to whom they also\r\nascribed some extant hymns, and probably much more besides. Aristotle\r\nand Aristarchus seem to have put Homer's date about 1044 B.C., Herodotus\r\nabout 850 B.C. It is not till about 170 B.C. that the grammarians\r\nHellanicus and Xenon put forward the view that Homer was the author of\r\nthe _Iliad_, but not of the _Odyssey_. Those who followed them in\r\nassigning different authors to the two poems were called the Separators\r\n(_Chorizontes_). Aristarchus combated \"the paradox of Xenon,\" and it\r\ndoes not seem to have had much acceptance in antiquity. Giovanni\r\nBattista Vico, a Neapolitan (1668-1744), seems to have been the first\r\nmodern to suggest the composite authorship and oral tradition of the\r\nHomeric poems; but this was a pure conjecture in support of his theory\r\nthat the names of ancient lawgivers and poets are often mere symbols. F.\r\nA. Wolf, in the _Prolegomena_ to his edition (1795), was the founder of\r\na scientific scepticism. The _Iliad_, he said (for he recognized the\r\ncomparative unity and consistency of the _Odyssey_), was pieced together\r\nfrom many small unwritten poems by various hands, and was first\r\ncommitted to writing in the time of Peisistratus. This view was in\r\nharmony with the tone of German criticism at the time; it was welcomed\r\nas a new testimony to the superiority of popular poetry, springing from\r\nfresh natural sources, to elaborate works of art; and it at once found\r\nenthusiastic adherents. For the course of Homeric controversy since Wolf\r\nthe reader is referred to the article HOMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cyclic poems.\r\n\r\nThe Ionian school of epos produced a number of poems founded on the\r\nlegends of the Trojan war, and intended as introductions or\r\ncontinuations to the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_. The grammarian Proclus\r\n(A.D. 140) has preserved the names and subjects of some of these; but\r\nthe fragments are very scanty. The _Nostoi_ or _Homeward Voyages_, by\r\nAgias (or Hagias) of Troezen, filled up the gap of ten years between\r\nthe _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_; the _Lay of Telegonus_, by Eugammon of\r\nCyrene, continued the story of the Odyssey to the death of Odysseus by\r\nthe hand of Telegonus, the son whom Circe bore to him. Similarly the\r\n_Cyprian Lays_ by Stasinus of Cyprus, ascribed by others to Hegesias (or\r\nHegesinus) of Salamis or Halicarnassus, was introductory to the _Iliad_;\r\nthe _Aethiopis_ and the _Sack of Troy_, by Arctinus of Miletus, and the\r\n_Little Iliad_, by Lesches of Mytilene, were supplementary to it. These\r\nand many other names of lost epics--some taken also from the Theban\r\nmyths (_Thebais_, _Epigoni_, _Oedipodea_)--serve to show how prolific\r\nwas that epic school of which only two great examples remain. The name\r\nof _epic cycle_ was properly applied to a prose compilation of abstracts\r\nfrom these epics, pieced together in the order of the events. The\r\ncompilers were called \"cyclic\" writers; and the term has now been\r\ntransferred to the epic poets whom they used.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hesiodic epos.\r\n\r\nThe epic poetry of Ionia celebrated the great deeds of heroes in the old\r\nwars. But in Greece proper there arose another school of epos, which\r\nbusied itself with religious lore and ethical precepts, especially in\r\nrelation to the rural life of Boeotia. This school is represented by the\r\nname of Hesiod. The legend spoke of him as vanquishing Homer in a\r\npoetical contest of Chalcis in Euboea; and it expresses the fact that,\r\nto the old Greek mind, these two names stood for two contrasted epic\r\ntypes. Nothing is certainly known of his date, except that it must have\r\nbeen subsequent to the maturity of Ionian epos. He is conjecturally\r\nplaced about 850-800 B.C.; but some would refer him to the early part of\r\nthe 7th century B.C. His home was at Ascra, a village in a valley under\r\nHelicon, whither his father had migrated from Cyme in Aeolis on the\r\ncoast of Asia Minor. In Hesiod's _Works and Days_ we have the earliest\r\nexample of a didactic poem. The seasons and the labours of the Boeotian\r\nfarmer's year are followed by a list of the days which are lucky or\r\nunlucky for work. The _Theogony_, or \"Origin of the Gods,\" describes\r\nfirst how the visible order of nature arose out of chaos; next, how the\r\ngods were born. Though it never possessed the character of a sacred\r\nbook, it remained a standard authority on the genealogies of the gods.\r\nSo far as a corrupt and confused text warrants a judgment, the poet was\r\npiecing together--not always intelligently--the fragments of a very old\r\ncosmogonic system, using for this purpose both the hymns preserved in\r\nthe temples and the myths which lived in folklore. The epic lay in 480\r\nlines called the _Shield of Heracles_--partly imitated from the 18th\r\nbook of the _Iliad_--is the work of an author or authors later than\r\nHesiod. In the Hesiodic poetry, as represented by the _Works and Days_\r\nand the _Theogony_, we see the influence of the temple at Delphi. Hesiod\r\nrecognizes the existence of [Greek: daimones]--spirits of the departed\r\nwho haunt the earth as the invisible guardians of justice; and he\r\nconnects the office of the poet with that of the prophet. The poet is\r\none whom the gods have authorized to impress doctrine and practical\r\nduties on men. A religious purpose was essentially characteristic of the\r\nHesiodic school. Its poets treated the old legends as relics of a sacred\r\nhistory, and not merely, in the Ionian manner, as subjects of idealizing\r\nart. Such titles as the _Maxims of Cheiron_ and the _Lay of Melampus_,\r\nthe seer--lost poems of the Hesiodic school--illustrate its ethical and\r\nits mystic tendencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Homeric hymns.\r\n\r\nThe _Homeric Hymns_ are a collection of pieces, some of them very short,\r\nin hexameter verse. Their traditional title is--_Hymns_ or _Preludes of\r\nHomer and the Homeridae_. The second of the alternative designations is\r\nthe true one. The pieces are not \"hymns\" used in formal worship, but\r\n\"preludes\" or prefatory addresses ([Greek: prooimia]) with which the\r\nrhapsodists ushered in their recitations of epic poetry. The \"prelude\"\r\nmight be addressed to the presiding god of the festival, or to any local\r\ndeity whom the reciter wished to honour. The pieces (of which there are\r\n33) range in date perhaps from 750 to 500 B.C. (though some authorities\r\nassign dates as late as the 3rd and 4th centuries A.D.; see ed. by Sikes\r\nand Allen, e.g. p. 228), and it is probable that the collection was\r\nformed in Attica, for the use of rhapsodists. The style is that of the\r\nIonian or Homeric epos; but there are also several traces of the\r\nHesiodic or Boeotian school. The principal \"hymns\" are (1) to Apollo\r\n(generally treated as two or more hymns combined in one); (2) to Hermes;\r\n(3) to Aphrodite; and (4) to Demeter. The hymn to Apollo, quoted by\r\nThucydides (iii. 104) as Homer's, is of peculiar interest on account of\r\nthe lines describing the Ionian festival at Delos. Two celebrated pieces\r\nof a sportive kind passed under Homer's name. The _Margites_--a comic\r\npoem on one \"who knew many things but knew them all badly\"--is regarded\r\nby Aristotle as the earliest germ of comedy, and was possibly as old as\r\n700 B.C. Only a few lines remain. The _Batracho(myo)machia_, or _Battle\r\nof the Frogs and Mice_ probably belongs to the decline of Greek\r\nliterature, perhaps to the 2nd century B.C.[2] About 300 verses of it\r\nare extant.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transition from epos to elegy.\r\n\r\nIn the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ the personal opinions or sympathies of\r\nthe poet may sometimes be conjectured, but they are not declared or even\r\nhinted. Hesiod, indeed, sometimes gives us a glimpse of his own troubles\r\nor views. Yet Hesiod is, on the whole, essentially a prophet. The\r\nmessage which he delivers is not from himself; the truths which he\r\nimparts have not been discovered by his own search. He is the mouthpiece\r\nof the Delphian Apollo. Personal opinion and feeling may tinge his\r\nutterance, but they do not determine its general complexion. The egotism\r\nis a single thread; it is not the basis of the texture. Epic poetry was\r\nin Greece the foundation of all other poetry; for many centuries no\r\nother kind was generally cultivated, no other could speak to the whole\r\npeople. Politically, the age was monarchical or aristocratic;\r\nintellectually, it was too simple for the analysis of thought or\r\nemotion. Kings and princes loved to hear of the great deeds of their\r\nancestors; common men loved to hear of them too, for they had no other\r\ninterest. The mind of Greece found no subject of contemplation so\r\nattractive as the warlike past of the race, or so useful as that lore\r\nwhich experience and tradition had bequeathed. But in the course of the\r\n8th century B.C. the rule of hereditary princes began to disappear.\r\nMonarchy gave place to oligarchy, and this--often after the intermediate\r\nphase of a tyrannis--to democracy. Such a change was necessarily\r\nfavourable to the growth of reflection. The private citizen is no longer\r\na mere cipher, the Homeric [Greek: tis], a unit in the dim multitude of\r\nthe king-ruled folk; he gains more power of independent action, his\r\nmental horizon is widened, his life becomes fuller and more interesting.\r\nHe begins to feel the need of expressing the thoughts and feelings that\r\nare stirred in him. But as yet a prose literature does not exist; the\r\nnew thoughts, like the old heroic stories, must still be told in verse.\r\nThe forms of verse created by this need were the Elegiac and the Iambic.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Elegy.\r\n\r\nThe elegiac metre is, in form, a simple variation on the epic metre,\r\nobtained by docking the second of two hexameters so as to make it a\r\nverse of five feet or measures. But the poetical capabilities of the\r\nelegiac couplet are of a wholly different kind from those of heroic\r\nverse. [Greek: elegos] seems to be the Greek form of a name given by the\r\nCarians and Lydians to a lament for the dead. This was accompanied by\r\nthe soft music of the Lydian flute, which continued to be associated\r\nwith Greek elegy. The non-Hellenic origin of elegy is indicated by this\r\nvery fact. The flute was to the Greeks an Asiatic instrument--string\r\ninstruments were those which they made their own--and it would hardly\r\nhave been wedded by them to a species of poetry which had arisen among\r\nthemselves. The early elegiac poetry of Greece was by no means confined\r\nto mourning for the dead. War, love, politics, proverbial philosophy,\r\nwere in turn its themes; it dealt, in fact, with the chief interest of\r\nthe poet and his friends, whatever that might be at the time. It is the\r\ndirect expression of the poet's own thoughts, addressed to a\r\nsympathizing society. This is its first characteristic. The second is\r\nthat, even when most pathetic or most spirited, it still preserves, on\r\nthe whole, the tone of conversation or of narrative. Greek elegy stops\r\nshort of lyric passion. English elegy, whether funereal as in Dryden and\r\nPope, or reflective as in Gray, is usually true to the same normal type.\r\nRoman elegy is not equally true to it, but sometimes tends to trench on\r\nthe lyric province. For Roman elegy is mainly amatory or sentimental;\r\nand its masters imitated, as a rule, not the early Greek elegists, not\r\nTyrtaeus or Theognis, but the later Alexandrian elegists, such as\r\nCallimachus or Philetas. Catullus introduced the metre to Latin\r\nliterature, and used it with more fidelity than his followers to its\r\ngenuine Greek inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Iambic verse.\r\n\r\nElegy, as we have seen, was the first slight deviation from epos. But\r\nalmost at the same time another species arose which had nothing in\r\ncommon with epos, either in form or in spirit. This was the iambic. The\r\nword [Greek: iambos], _iambus_ ([Greek: iaptein], to dart or shoot) was\r\nused in reference to the licensed raillery at the festivals of Demeter;\r\nit was the maiden Iambe, the myth said, who drew the first smile from\r\nthe mourning goddess. The iambic metre was at first used for satire; and\r\nit was in this strain that it was chiefly employed by its earliest\r\nmaster of note, Archilochus of Paros (670 B.C.). But it was adapted to\r\nthe expression generally of any pointed thought. Thus it was suitable to\r\nfables. Elegiac and iambic poetry both belong to the borderland between\r\nepic and lyric. While, however, elegy stands nearer to epos, iambic\r\nstands nearer to the lyric. Iambic poetry can express the personal\r\nfeeling of the poet with greater intensity than elegy does; on the other\r\nhand, it has not the lyric flexibility, self-abandonment or glow. As we\r\nsee in the case of Solon, iambic verse could serve for the expression of\r\nthat deeper thought, that more inward self-communing, for which the\r\nelegiac form would have been inappropriate.\r\n\r\nBut these two forms of poetry, both Ionian, the elegiac and the iambic,\r\nbelong essentially to the same stage of the literature. They stand\r\nbetween the Ionian epos and the lyric poetry of the Aeolians and\r\nDorians. The earliest of the Greek elegists, Callinus and Tyrtaeus, use\r\nelegy to rouse a warlike spirit in sinking hearts. Archilochus too wrote\r\nwarlike elegy, but used it also in other strains, as in lament for the\r\ndead. The elegy of Mimnermus of Smyrna or Colophon is the plaintive\r\nfarewell of an ease-loving Ionian to the days of Ionian freedom. In\r\nSolon elegy takes a higher range; it becomes political and ethical.[3]\r\nTheognis represents the maturer union of politics with a proverbial\r\nphilosophy. Another gnomic poet was Phocylides of Miletus; an admonitory\r\npoem extant under his name is probably the work of an Alexandrine Jewish\r\nChristian. Xenophanes gives a philosophic strain to elegy. With\r\nSimonides of Ceos it reverts, in an exquisite form, to its earliest\r\ndestination, and becomes the vehicle of epitaph on those who fell in the\r\nPersian Wars. Iambic verse was used by Simonides (or Semonides) of\r\nAmorgus, as by Archilochus, for satire--but satire directed against\r\nclasses rather than persons. Solon's iambics so far preserve the old\r\nassociations of the metre that they represent the polemical or\r\ncontroversial side of his political poetry. Hipponax of Ephesus was\r\nanother iambic satirist--using the [Greek: skazon] (\"limping\") or\r\ncholiambic verse, produced by substituting a spondee for an iambus in\r\nthe last place. But it was not until the rise of the Attic drama that\r\nthe full capabilities of iambic verse were seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lyric poetry.\r\n\r\nThe lyric poetry of early Greece may be regarded as the final form of\r\nthat effort at self-expression which in the elegiac and iambic is still\r\nincomplete. The lyric expression is deeper and more impassioned. Its\r\nintimate union with music and with the rhythmical movement of the dance\r\ngives to it more of an ideal character. At the same time the continuity\r\nof the music permits pauses to the voice--pauses necessary as reliefs\r\nafter a climax. Before lyric poetry could be effective, it was necessary\r\nthat some progress should have been made in the art of music. The\r\ninstrument used by the Greeks to accompany the voice was the\r\nfour-stringed lyre, and the first great epoch in Greek music was when\r\nTerpander of Lesbos (660 B.C.), by adding three strings, gave the lyre\r\nthe compass of the octave. Further improvements are ascribed to Olympus\r\nand Thaletas. By 500 B.C. Greek music had probably acquired all the\r\npowers of expression which the lyric poet could demand. The period of\r\nGreek lyric poetry may be roughly defined as from 670 to 440 B.C. Two\r\ndifferent parts in its development were taken by the Aeolians and the\r\nDorians.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aeolian school.\r\n\r\nThe lyric poetry of the Aeolians--especially of Lesbos--was essentially\r\nthe utterance of personal feeling, and was usually intended for a single\r\nvoice, not for a chorus. Lesbos, in the 7th century B.C., had attained\r\nsome naval and commercial importance. But the strife of oligarchy and\r\ndemocracy was active; the Lesbian nobles were often driven by revolution\r\nto exchange their luxurious home-life for the hardships of exile. It is\r\nsuch a life of contrasts and excitements, working on a sensuous and\r\nfiery temperament, that is reflected in the fragments of Alcaeus. In\r\nthese glimpses of war and love, of anxiety for the storm-tossed state\r\nand of careless festivity, there is much of the cavalier spirit; if\r\nArchilochus is in certain aspects a Greek Byron, Alcaeus might be\r\ncompared to Lovelace. The other great representative of the Aeolian\r\nlyric is Sappho, the only woman of Greek race who is known to have\r\npossessed poetical genius of the first order. Intensity and melody are\r\nthe characteristics of the fragments that remain to us.[4] Probably no\r\npoet ever surpassed Sappho as an interpreter of passion in exquisitely\r\nsubtle harmonies of form and sound. Anacreon of Teos, in Ionia, may be\r\nclassed with the Aeolian lyrists in so far as the matter and form of his\r\nwork resembled theirs, though the dialect in which he wrote was mainly\r\nthe Ionian. A few fragments remain from his hymns to the gods, from\r\nlove-poems and festive songs. The collection of sixty short pieces which\r\npasses current under his name date only from the 10th century. The short\r\npoems which it comprises are of various age and authorship, probably\r\nranging in date from c. 200 B.C. to A.D. 400 or 500. They have not the\r\npure style, the flexible grace, or the sweetness of the classical\r\nfragments; but the verses, though somewhat mechanical, are often pretty.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dorian school.\r\n\r\nThe Dorian lyric poetry, in contrast with the Aeolian, had more of a\r\npublic than of a personal character, and was for the most part choral.\r\nHymns or choruses for the public worship of the gods, and odes to be\r\nsung at festivals on occasions of public interest, were its\r\ncharacteristic forms. Its central inspiration was the pride of the\r\nDorians in the Dorian past, in their traditions of worship, government\r\nand social usage. The history of the Dorian lyric poetry does not\r\npresent us with vivid expressions of personal character, like those of\r\nAlcaeus and Sappho, but rather with a series of artists whose names are\r\nassociated with improvements of form. Thus Alcman (the Doric form of\r\nAlcmaeon; 660 B.C.) is said to have introduced the balanced movement of\r\nstrophe and antistrophe. Stesichorus, of Himera in Sicily, added the\r\nepode, sung by the chorus while stationary after these movements; Arion\r\nof Methymna in Lesbos gave a finished form to the choral hymn\r\n(\"dithyramb\") in honour of Dionysus, and organized the \"cyclic\" or\r\ncircular chorus which sang it at the altar. Ibycus of Rhegium (c. 540)\r\nwrote choral lyrics after Stesichorus and glowing love-songs in the\r\nAeolic style.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Simonides and Pindar.\r\n\r\nThe culmination of the lyric poetry is marked by two great names,\r\nSimonides and Pindar. Simonides (556-468) was an Ionian of the island of\r\nCeos, but his lyrics belonged by form to the choral Dorian school. Many\r\nof his subjects were taken from the events of the Persian wars: his\r\nepitaphs on those who fell at Thermopylae and Salamis were celebrated.\r\nIn him the lyric art of the Dorians is interpreted by Ionian genius, and\r\nAthens--where part of his life was passed--is the point at which they\r\nmeet. Simonides is the first Greek lyrist whose significance is not\r\nmerely Aeolian or Dorian but Panhellenic. The same character belongs\r\neven more completely to his younger contemporary. Pindar (518-c. 443)\r\nwas born in Boeotia of a Dorian stock; thus, as Ionian and Dorian\r\nelements meet in Simonides, so Dorian and Aeolian elements meet in\r\nPindar. Simonides was perhaps the most tender and most exquisite of the\r\nlyric poets. Pindar was the boldest, the most fervid and the most\r\nsublime. His extant fragments[5] represent almost every branch of the\r\nlyric art. But he is known to us mainly by forty-four _Epinicia_, or\r\nodes of victory, for the Olympian, Pythian, Nemean and Isthmian\r\nfestivals. The general characteristic of the treatment is that the\r\nparticular victory is made the occasion of introducing heroic legends\r\nconnected with the family or city of the victor, and of inculcating the\r\nmoral lessons which they teach. No Greek lyric poetry can be completely\r\nappreciated apart from the music, now lost, to which it was set.\r\nPindar's odes were, further, essentially occasional poems; they abound\r\nin allusions of which the effect is partly or wholly lost on us; and the\r\nglories which they celebrate belong to a life which we can but\r\nimperfectly realize. Of all the great Greek poets, Pindar is perhaps the\r\none to whom it is hardest for us to do justice; yet we can at least\r\nrecognize his splendour of imagination, his strong rapidity and his\r\nsoaring flight.\r\n\r\nBacchylides of Ceos (c. 504-430), the youngest of the three great lyric\r\npoets and nephew of Simonides, was known only by scanty fragments until\r\nthe discovery of nineteen poems on an Egyptian papyrus in 1896. They\r\nconsist of thirteen (or fourteen) epinicia, two of which celebrate the\r\nsame victories as two odes of Pindar. The papyrus also contains six odes\r\nfor the festivals of gods or heroes. The poems contain valuable\r\ninformation on the court life of the time and legendary history.\r\nBacchylides, the little \"Cean nightingale,\" is inferior to his great\r\nrival Pindar, \"the Swan of Dirce,\" in originality and splendour of\r\nlanguage, but he writes simply and elegantly, while his excellent\r\n[Greek: gnomai] attracted readers of a philosophical turn of mind,\r\namongst them the emperor Julian.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the scanty fragments of Timotheus of Miletus (d. 357),\r\nmusical composer and poet, and inventor of the eleven-stringed lyre,\r\nwere increased by the discovery in 1902 of some 250 lines of his \"nome\"\r\nthe _Persae_, written after the manner of Terpander. The beginning is\r\nlost; the middle describes the battle of Salamis; the end is of a\r\npersonal nature. The papyrus is the oldest Greek MS. and belongs to the\r\nage of Alexander the Great. The language is frequently very obscure, and\r\nthe whole is a specimen of lyric poetry in its decline.\r\n\r\n(B) _The Attic Literature._--The Ionians of Asia Minor, the Aeolians and\r\nthe Dorians had now performed their special parts in the development of\r\nGreek literature. Epic poetry had interpreted the heroic legends of\r\nwarlike deeds done by Zeus-nourished kings and chiefs. Then, as the\r\nindividual life became more and more elegiac and iambic poetry had\r\nbecome the social expression of that life in all its varied interests\r\nand feelings. Lastly, lyric poetry had arisen to satisfy a twofold\r\nneed--to be the more intense utterance of personal emotion, or to give\r\nchoral voice, at stirring moments, to the faith or fame, the triumph or\r\nthe sorrow, of a city or a race. A new form of poetry was now to be\r\ncreated, with elements borrowed from all the rest. And this was to be\r\nachieved by the people of Attica, in whose character and language the\r\ndistinctive traits of an Ionian descent were tempered with some of the\r\nbest qualities of the Dorian stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Origin of drama.\r\n\r\n  Tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe drama (q.v.) arose from the festivals of Dionysus, the god of wine,\r\nwhich were held at intervals from the beginning of winter to the\r\nbeginning of spring. A troop of rustic worshippers would gather around\r\nthe altar of the god, and sing a hymn in his honour, telling of his\r\nvictories or sufferings in his progress over the earth. \"Tragedy\" meant\r\n\"the goat-song,\" a goat ([Greek: tragos]) being sacrificed to Dionysus\r\nbefore the hymn was sung. \"Comedy,\" \"the village-song,\" is the same hymn\r\nregarded as an occasion for rustic jest. Then the leader of the chorus\r\nwould assume the part of a messenger from Dionysus, or even that of the\r\ngod himself, and recite an adventure to the worshippers, who made choral\r\nresponse. The next step was to arrange a dialogue between the leader\r\n([Greek: koryphaios], _coryphaeus_) and one chosen member of the chorus,\r\nhence called \"the answerer\" ([Greek: hypokrites], _hypocrites_,\r\nafterwards the ordinary word for \"actor\"). This last improvement is\r\nascribed to the Attic Thespis (about 536 B.C.). The elements of drama\r\nwere now ready. The choral hymn to Dionysus (the \"dithyramb\") had\r\nreceived an artistic form from the Dorians; dialogue, though only\r\nbetween the leader of the chorus and a single actor, had been introduced\r\nin Attica. Phrynichus, an Athenian, celebrated in this manner some\r\nevents of the Persian Wars; but in his \"drama\" there was still only one\r\nactor. Choerilus of Athens and Pratinas of Phlius, who belonged to the\r\nsame period, developed the satyric drama; Pratinas also wrote tragedies,\r\ndithyrambs, and _hyporchemata_ (lively choral odes chiefly in honour of\r\nApollo).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aeschylus.\r\n\r\n  Sophocles.\r\n\r\n  Euripides.\r\n\r\nAeschylus (born 525 B.C.) became the real founder of tragedy by\r\nintroducing a second actor, and thus rendering the dialogue independent\r\nof the chorus. At the same time the choral song--hitherto the principal\r\npart of the performance--became subordinate to the dialogue; and drama\r\nwas mature. Aeschylus is also said to have made various improvements of\r\ndetail in costume and the like; and it was early in his career that the\r\ntheatre of Dionysus under the acropolis was commenced--the first\r\npermanent home of Greek drama, in place of the temporary wooden\r\nplatforms which had hitherto been used. The system of the \"trilogy\" and\r\nthe \"tetralogy\" is further ascribed to Aeschylus,--the \"trilogy\" being\r\nproperly a series of three tragedies connected in subject, such as the\r\n_Agamemnon_, _Choephori_, _Eumenides_, which together form the\r\n_Oresteia_, or Story of Orestes. The \"tetralogy\" is such a triad with a\r\n\"satyric drama\" added--that is, a drama in which \"satyrs,\" the grotesque\r\nwoodland beings who attended on Dionysus, formed the chorus, as in the\r\nearlier dithyramb from which drama sprang. The _Cyclops_ of Euripides is\r\nthe only extant specimen of a satyric drama. In the seven tragedies\r\nwhich alone remain of the seventy which Aeschylus is said to have\r\ncomposed, the forms of kings and heroes have a grandeur which is truly\r\nHomeric; there is a spirit of Panhellenic patriotism such as the Persian\r\nWars in which he fought might well quicken in a soldier-poet; and,\r\npervading all, there is a strain of speculative thought which seeks to\r\nreconcile the apparent conflicts between the gods of heaven and of the\r\nunderworld by the doctrine that both alike, constrained by necessity,\r\nare working out the law of righteousness. Sophocles, who was born thirty\r\nyears after Aeschylus (495 B.C.), is the most perfect artist of the\r\nancient drama. No one before or after him gave to Greek tragedy so high\r\na degree of ideal beauty, or appreciated so finely the possibilities and\r\nthe limitations of its sphere. He excels especially in drawing\r\ncharacter; his _Antigone_, his _Ajax_, his _Oedipus_--indeed, all the\r\nchief persons of his dramas--are typical studies in the great primary\r\nemotions of human nature. He gave a freer scope to tragic dialogue by\r\nadding a third actor; and in one of his later plays, the _Oedipus at\r\nColonus_, a fourth actor is required. From the time when he won the\r\ntragic prize against Aeschylus in 468 to his death in 405 B.C. he was\r\nthe favourite dramatist of Athens; and for us he is not only a great\r\ndramatist, but also the most spiritual representative of the age of\r\nPericles. The distinctive interest of Euripides is of another kind. He\r\nwas only fifteen years younger than Sophocles; but when he entered on\r\nhis poetical career, the old inspirations of tragedy were already\r\nfailing. Euripides marks a period of transition in the tragic art, and\r\nis, in fact, the mediator between the classical and the romantic drama.\r\nThe myths and traditions with which the elder dramatists had dealt no\r\nlonger commanded an unquestioning faith. Euripides himself was imbued\r\nwith the new intellectual scepticism of the day; and the speculative\r\nviews which were conflicting in his own mind are reflected in his plays.\r\nHe had much picturesque and pathetic power; he was a master of\r\nexpression; and he shows ingenuity in devising fresh resources for\r\ntragedy--especially in his management of the choral songs. Aeschylus is\r\nPanhellenic, Sophocles is Athenian, Euripides is cosmopolitan. He stands\r\nnearer to the modern world than either of his predecessors; and though\r\nwith him Attic tragedy loses its highest beauty, it acquires new\r\nelements of familiar human interest.\r\n\r\nIn Attica, as in England, a period of rather less than fifty years\r\nsufficed for the complete development of the tragic art. The two\r\ndistinctive characteristics of Athenian drama are its originality and\r\nits abundance. The Greeks of Attica were not the only inventors of\r\ndrama, but they were the first people who made drama a complete work of\r\nart. And the great tragic poets of Attica were remarkably prolific.\r\nAeschylus was the reputed author of 70 tragedies, Sophocles of 113,\r\nEuripides of 92; and there were others whose productiveness was equally\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Comedy.\r\n\r\n  Aristophanes.\r\n\r\nComedy represented the lighter side, as tragedy the graver side, of the\r\nDionysiac worship; it was the joy of spring following the gloom of\r\nwinter. The process of growth was nearly the same as in tragedy; but the\r\nDorians, not the Ionians of Attica, were the first who added dialogue to\r\nthe comic chorus. Susarion, a Dorian of Megara, exhibited, about 580\r\nB.C., pieces of the kind known as \"Megarian farces.\" Epicharmus of Cos\r\n(who settled at Syracuse) gave literary form to the Doric farce, and\r\ntreated in burlesque style the stories of gods and heroes, and subjects\r\ntaken from everyday life. His Syracusan contemporary Sophron (c. 450)\r\nwas a famous writer of mimes, chiefly scenes from low-class life. The\r\nmost artistic form of comedy seems, however, to have been developed in\r\nAttica. The greatest names before Aristophanes are those of Cratinus and\r\nEupolis; but from about 470 B.C. there seems to have been a continuous\r\nsuccession of comic dramatists, amongst them Plato Comicus, the author\r\nof 28 comedies, political satires and parodies after the style of the\r\nMiddle Comedy. Aristophanes came forward as a comic poet in 427 B.C.,\r\nand retained his popularity for about forty years. He presents a perhaps\r\nunique union of bold fancy, exquisite humour, critical acumen and\r\nlyrical power. His eleven extant comedies may be divided into three\r\ngroups, according as the licence of political satire becomes more and\r\nmore restricted. In the _Acharnians_, _Knights_, _Clouds_, _Wasps_ and\r\n_Peace_ (425-421) the poet uses unrestrained freedom. In the _Birds_,\r\n_Lysistrata_, _Thesmophoriazusae_ and _Frogs_ (414-405) a greater\r\nreserve may be perceived. Lastly, in the _Ecclesiazusae_ and the\r\n_Plutus_ (392-388) personal satire is almost wholly avoided. The same\r\ngeneral tendency continued. The so-called \"Middle Comedy\" (390-320)\r\nrepresents the transition from the Old Comedy, or political satire, to\r\nsatire of a literary or social nature; its chief writers were Antiphanes\r\nof Athens and Alexis of Thurii. The \"New Comedy\" (320-250) resembled the\r\nmodern \"comedy of manners.\"\r\n\r\nIts chief representative was Menander (342-291), the author of 105\r\ncomedies. Fragments have been discovered of seven of these, of\r\nsufficient length to give an idea of their dramatic action. His plays\r\nwere produced on the stage as late as the time of Plutarch, and his\r\n[Greek: gnomai], distinguished by worldly wisdom, were issued in the\r\nform of anthologies, which enjoyed great popularity. Other prominent\r\nwriters of this class were Diphilus, Philemon, Posidippus and\r\nApollodorus of Carystus. About 330 B.C. Rhinthon of Tarentum revived the\r\nold Doric farce in his _Hilarotragoediae_ or travesties of tragic\r\nstories. These successive periods cannot be sharply or precisely marked\r\noff. The change which gradually passed over the comic drama was simply\r\nthe reflection of the change which passed over the political and social\r\nlife of Athens. The Old Comedy, as we see it in the earlier plays of\r\nAristophanes, was probably the most powerful engine of public criticism\r\nthat has ever existed in any community. Unsparing personality was its\r\nessence. The comic poet used this recognized right on an occasion at\r\nonce festive and sacred, in a society where every man of any note was\r\nknown by name and sight to the rest. The same thousands who heard a\r\npolicy or a character denounced or lauded in the theatre might be\r\nrequired to pass sentence on it in the popular assembly or in the courts\r\nof law.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Literary prose.\r\n\r\nThe development of Greek poetry had been completed before a prose\r\nliterature had begun to exist. The earliest name in extant Greek prose\r\nliterature is that of Herodotus; and, when he wrote, the Attic drama had\r\nalready passed its prime. There had been, indeed, writers of prose\r\nbefore Herodotus; but there had not been, in the proper sense of the\r\nterm, a prose literature. The causes of this comparatively late origin\r\nof Greek literary prose are independent of the question as to the time\r\nat which the art of writing began to be generally used for literary\r\npurposes. Epic poetry exercised for a very long period a sovereign spell\r\nover the Greek mind. In it was deposited all that the race possessed of\r\nhistory, theology, philosophy, oratory. Even after an age of reflection\r\nhad begun, elegiac poetry, the first offshoot of epic, was, with iambic\r\nverse, the vehicle of much which among other races would have been\r\ncommitted to prose. The basis of Greek culture was essentially poetical.\r\nA political cause worked in the same direction. In the Eastern\r\nmonarchies the king was the centre of all, and the royal records\r\nafforded the elements of history from a remote date. The Greek nation\r\nwas broken up into small states, each busied with its own affairs and\r\nits own men. It was the collision between the Greek and the barbarian\r\nworld which first provided a national subject for a Greek historian. The\r\nwork of Herodotus, in its relation to Greek prose, is so far analogous\r\nto the _Iliad_ in its relation to Greek poetry, that it is the earliest\r\nwork of art, and that it bears a Panhellenic stamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Early prose writers.\r\n\r\nThe sense and the degree in which Herodotus was original may be inferred\r\nfrom what is known of earlier prose-writers. For about a century before\r\nHerodotus there had been a series of writers in philosophy, mythology,\r\ngeography and history. The earliest, or among the earliest, of the\r\nphilosophical writers were Pherecydes of Syros (550 B.C.) and the Ionian\r\nAnaximenes and Anaximander. It is doubtful whether Cadmus of Miletus,\r\nsupposed to have been the first prose writer, was an historical\r\npersonage. The Ionian writers, especially called [Greek: logographoi],\r\n\"narrators in prose\" (as distinguished from [Greek: epopoioi], makers of\r\nverse), were those who compiled the myths, especially in genealogies, or\r\nwho described foreign countries, their physical features, usages and\r\ntraditions. Hecataeus of Miletus (500 B.C.) is the best-known\r\nrepresentative of the _logographi_ in both these branches. Hellanicus of\r\nMytilene (450 B.C.), among whose works was a history of Attica, appears\r\nto have made a nearer approach to the character of a systematic\r\nhistorian. Other logographi were Charon of Lampsacus; Pherecydes of\r\nLeros, who wrote on the myths of early Attica; Hippys of Rhegium, the\r\noldest writer on Italy and Sicily; and Acusilaus of Argos in Boeotia,\r\nauthor of genealogies (see LOGOGRAPHI, and GREECE: _Ancient History_,\r\n\"Authorities\").\r\n\r\n\r\n  Herodotus.\r\n\r\nHerodotus was born in 484 B.C.; and his history was probably not\r\ncompleted before the beginning of the Peloponnesian War (431 B.C.). His\r\nsubject is the struggle between Greece and Asia, which he deduces from\r\nthe legendary rape of the Argive Io by Phoenicians, and traces down to\r\nthe final victory of the Greeks over the invading host of Xerxes. His\r\nliterary kinship with the historical or geographical writers who had\r\npreceded him is seen mainly in two things. First, though he draws a line\r\nbetween the mythological and the historical age, he still holds that\r\nmyths, as such, are worthy to be reported, and that in certain cases it\r\nis part of his duty to report them. Secondly, he follows the example of\r\nsuch writers as Hecataeus in describing the natural and social features\r\nof countries. He seeks to combine the part of the geographer or\r\nintelligent traveller with his proper part as historian. But when we\r\nturn from these minor traits to the larger aspects of his work,\r\nHerodotus stands forth as an artist whose conception and whose method\r\nwere his own. His history has an epic unity. Various as are the\r\nsubordinate parts, the action narrated is one, great and complete; and\r\nthe unity is due to this, that Herodotus refers all events of human\r\nhistory to the principle of divine Nemesis. If Sophocles had told the\r\nstory of Oedipus in the _Oedipus Tyrannus_ alone, and had not added to\r\nit the _Oedipus at Colonus_, it would have been comparable to the story\r\nof Xerxes as told by Herodotus. Great as an artist, great too in the\r\nlargeness of his historical conception, Herodotus fails chiefly by lack\r\nof insight into political cause and effect, and by a general silence in\r\nregard to the history of political institutions. Both his strength and\r\nhis weakness are seen most clearly when he is contrasted with that other\r\nhistorian who was strictly his contemporary and who yet seems divided\r\nfrom him by centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Thucydides.\r\n\r\nThucydides was only thirteen years younger than Herodotus; but the\r\nintellectual space between the men is so great that they seem to belong\r\nto different ages. Herodotus is the first artist in historical writing;\r\nThucydides is the first thinker. Herodotus interweaves two threads of\r\ncausation--human agency, represented by the good or bad qualities of\r\nmen, and divine agency, represented by the vigilance of the gods on\r\nbehalf of justice. Thucydides concentrates his attention on the human\r\nagency (without, however, denying the other), and strives to trace its\r\nexact course. The subject of Thucydides is the Peloponnesian War. In\r\nresolving to write its history, he was moved, he says, by these\r\nconsiderations. It was probably the greatest movement which had ever\r\naffected Hellas collectively. It was possible for him as a contemporary\r\nto record it with approximate accuracy. And this record was likely to\r\nhave a general value, over and above its particular interest as a\r\nrecord, seeing that the political future was likely to resemble the\r\npolitical past. This is what Thucydides means when he calls his work \"a\r\npossession for ever.\" The speeches which he ascribes to the persons of\r\nthe history are, as regards form, his own essays in rhetoric of the\r\nschool to which Antiphon belongs. As regards matter, they are always so\r\nfar dramatic that the thoughts and sentiments are such as he conceived\r\npossible for the supposed speaker. Thucydides abstains, as a rule, from\r\nmoral comment; but he tells his story as no one could have told it who\r\ndid not profoundly feel its tragic force; and his general claim to the\r\nmerit of impartiality is not invalidated by the possible\r\nexceptions--difficult to estimate--in the cases of Cleon and Hyperbolus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Xenophon.\r\n\r\nStrong as is the contrast between Herodotus and Thucydides, their works\r\nhave yet a character which distinguish both alike from the historical\r\nwork of Xenophon in the _Anabasis_ and the _Hellenica_. Herodotus gives\r\nus a vivid drama with the unity of an epic. Thucydides takes a great\r\nchapter of contemporary history and traces the causes which are at work\r\nthroughout it, so as to give the whole a scientific unity. Xenophon has\r\nnot the grasp either of the dramatist or of the philosopher. His work\r\ndoes not possess the higher unity either of art or of science. The true\r\ndistinction of Xenophon consists in his thorough combination of the\r\npractical with the literary character. He was an accomplished soldier,\r\nwho had done and seen much. He was also a good writer, who could make a\r\nstory both clear and lively. But the several parts of the story are not\r\ngrouped around any central idea, such as a divine Nemesis is for\r\nHerodotus, or such as Thucydides finds in the nature of political man.\r\nThe seven books of the _Hellenica_ form a supplement to the history of\r\nThucydides, beginning in 411 and going down to 362 B.C. The chief blot\r\non the _Hellenica_ is the author's partiality to Sparta, and in\r\nparticular to Agesilaus. Some of the greatest achievements of\r\nEpaminondas and Pelopidas are passed over in silence. On the whole,\r\nXenophon is perhaps seen at his best in his narrative of the _Retreat of\r\nthe Ten Thousand_--a subject which exactly suits him. The _Cyropaedeia_\r\nis a romance of little historical worth, but with many good passages.\r\n_The Recollections of Socrates_, on the other hand, derive their\r\nprincipal value from being uniformly matter-of-fact. In his minor pieces\r\non various subjects Xenophon appears as the earliest essayist. It may be\r\nnoted that one of the essays erroneously ascribed to him--that _On the\r\nAthenian Polity_--is probably the oldest specimen in existence of\r\nliterary Attic prose.\r\n\r\nHis contemporaries Ctesias of Cnidus and Philistus of Syracuse wrote\r\nhistories of Persia and Sicily. In the second half of the 4th century a\r\nnumber of histories were compiled by literary men of little practical\r\nknowledge, who had been trained in the rhetorical schools. Such were\r\nEphorus of Cyme and Theopompus of Chios, both pupils of Isocrates; and\r\nthe writers of _Atthides_ (chronicles of Attic history), the chief of\r\nwhom were Androtion and Philochorus. Timaeus of Tauromenium was the\r\nauthor of a great work on Sicily, and introduced the system of reckoning\r\nby Olympiads.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Oratory.\r\n\r\nThe steps by which an Attic prose style was developed, and the principal\r\nforms which it assumed, can be traced most clearly in the Attic orators.\r\nEvery Athenian citizen who aspired to take part in the affairs of the\r\ncity, or even to be qualified for self-defence before a law-court,\r\nrequired to have some degree of skill in public speaking; and an\r\nAthenian audience looked upon public debate, whether political or\r\nforensic, as a competitive trial of proficiency in a fine art. Hence the\r\nspeaker, no less than the writer, was necessarily a student of finished\r\nexpression; and oratory had a more direct influence on the general\r\nstructure of literary prose than has ever perhaps been the case\r\nelsewhere. A systematic rhetoric took its rise in Sicily, where Corax of\r\nSyracuse (466 B.C.) devised his _Art of Words_ to assist those who were\r\npleading before the law-courts; and it was brought to Athens by his\r\ndisciple Tisias. The teaching of the Sophists, again, directed\r\nattention, though in a superficial and imperfect way, to the elements of\r\ngrammar and logic; and Gorgias of Leontini--whose declamation, however\r\nturgid, must have been striking--gave an impulse at Athens to the taste\r\nfor elaborate rhetorical brilliancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Attic orators.\r\n\r\n  Demosthenes.\r\n\r\nAntiphon represents the earliest, and what has been called the grand,\r\nstyle of Attic prose; its chief characteristics are a grave, dignified\r\nmovement, a frequent emphasis on verbal contrasts, and a certain austere\r\nelevation. The interest of Andocides is mainly historical; but he has\r\ngraphic power. Lysias, the representative of the \"plain style,\" breaks\r\nthrough the rigid mannerism of the elder school, and uses the language\r\nof daily life with an ease and grace which, though the result of study,\r\ndo not betray their art. He is, in his own way, the canon of an Attic\r\nstyle; and his speeches, written for others, exhibit also a high degree\r\nof dramatic skill. Isocrates, whose manner may be regarded as\r\nintermediate between that of Antiphon and that of Lysias, wrote for\r\nreaders rather than for hearers. The type of literary prose which he\r\nfounded is distinguished by ample periods, by studied smoothness and by\r\nthe temperate use of rhetorical ornament. From the middle of the 4th\r\ncentury B.C. the Isocratic style of prose became general in Greek\r\nliterature. From the school of Rhodes, in which it became more florid,\r\nit passed to Cicero, and through him it has helped to shape the literary\r\nprose of the modern world. The speeches of Isaeus in will-cases are\r\ninteresting,--apart from their bearing on Attic life,--because in them\r\nwe see, as Dionysius says, \"the seeds and the beginnings\" of that\r\ntechnical mastery in rhetorical argument which Demosthenes carries to\r\nperfection. Isaeus has also, in a degree, some of the qualities of\r\nLysias. Demosthenes excels all other masters of Greek prose not only in\r\npower but in variety; his political speeches, his orations in public or\r\nprivate causes, show his consummate and versatile command over all the\r\nresources of the language. In him the development of Attic prose is\r\ncompleted, and the best elements in each of its earlier phases are\r\nunited. The modern world can more easily appreciate Demosthenes as a\r\ngreat natural orator than as an elaborate artist. But, in order to\r\napprehend his place in the history of Attic prose, we must remember that\r\nthe ancients felt him to be both; and that he was even reproached by\r\ndetractors with excessive study of effect. Aeschines is the most\r\ntheatrical of the Greek orators; he is vehement, and often brilliant,\r\nbut seldom persuasive. Hypereides was, after Demosthenes, probably the\r\nmost effective; he had much of the grace of Lysias, but also a wit, a\r\nfire and a pathos which were his own. Portions of six of his speeches,\r\nfound in Egypt between 1847 and 1890, are extant. The one oration of\r\nLycurgus which remains to us is earnest and stately, reminding us both\r\nof Antiphon and of Isocrates. Dinarchus was merely a bad imitator of\r\nDemosthenes. There seems more reason to regret that Demades is not\r\nrepresented by larger fragments. The decline of Attic oratory may be\r\ndated from Demetrius of Phalerum (318 B.C.), the pupil of Aristotle, and\r\nthe first to introduce the custom of making speeches on imaginary\r\nsubjects as practised in the rhetorical schools. Cicero names him as the\r\nfirst who impaired the vigour of the earlier eloquence, \"preferring his\r\nown sweetness to the weight and dignity of his predecessors.\" He forms a\r\nconnecting link between Athens and Alexandria, where he found refuge\r\nafter his downfall and promoted the foundation of the famous library.\r\n\r\nIn later times oratory chiefly flourished in the coast and island\r\nsettlements of Asia Minor, especially Rhodes. Here a new, florid style\r\nof oration arose, called the \"Asiatic,\" which owed its origin to\r\nHegesias of Magnesia (c. 250 B.C.).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Philosophical prose--Plato and Aristotle.\r\n\r\nThe place of Plato in the history of Greek literature is as unique as\r\nhis place in the history of Greek thought. The literary genius shown in\r\nthe dialogues is many-sided: it includes dramatic power, remarkable\r\nskill in parody, a subtle faculty of satire, and, generally, a command\r\nover the finer tones of language. In passages of continuous exposition,\r\nwhere the argument rises into the higher regions of discussion, Plato's\r\nprose takes a more decidedly poetical colouring--never florid or\r\nsentimental, however, but lofty and austere. In Plato's later\r\nworks--such, for instance, as the _Laws_, _Timaeus_, _Critias_--we can\r\nperceive that his style did not remain unaffected by the smooth literary\r\nprose which contemporary writers had developed. Aristotle's influence on\r\nthe form of Attic prose literature would probably have been considerable\r\nif his _Rhetoric_ had been published while Attic oratory had still a\r\nvigorous life before it. But in this, as in other departments of mental\r\neffort, it was Aristotle's lot to set in order what the Greek intellect\r\nhad done in that creative period which had now come to an end. His own\r\nchief contribution to the original achievements of the race was the most\r\nfitting one that could have been made by him in whose lifetime they were\r\nclosed. He bequeathed an instrument by which analysis could be carried\r\nfurther, he founded a science of reasoning, and left those who followed\r\nhim to apply it in all those provinces of knowledge which he had mapped\r\nout.[6] Theophrastus, his pupil and his successor in the Lyceum, opens\r\nthe new age of research and scientific classification with his extant\r\nworks on botany, but is better known to modern readers by his lively\r\n_Characters_, the prototypes of such sketches in English literature as\r\nthose of Hall, Overbury and Earle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Character of the creative age.\r\n\r\n(C) _The Literature of the Decadence._--The period of decadence in Greek\r\nliterature begins with the extinction of free political life in the\r\nGreek cities. So long as the Greek commonwealths were independent and\r\nvigorous, Greek life rested on the identity of the man with the citizen.\r\nThe city state was the highest unit of social organization; the whole\r\ntraining and character of the man were viewed relatively to his\r\nmembership of the city. The market-place, the assembly, the theatre were\r\nplaces of frequent meeting, where the sense of citizenship was\r\nquickened, where common standards of opinion or feeling were formed.\r\nPoetry, music, sculpture, literature, art, in all their forms, were\r\nmatters of public interest. Every citizen had some degree of\r\nacquaintance with them, and was in some measure capable of judging them.\r\nThe poet and the musician, the historian and the sculptor, did not live\r\na life of studious seclusion or engrossing professional work. They were,\r\nas a rule, in full sympathy with the practical interests of their time.\r\nTheir art, whatever its form might be, was the concentrated and ennobled\r\nexpression of their political existence. Aeschylus breathed into tragedy\r\nthe inspiration of one who had himself fought the great fight of\r\nnational liberation. Sophocles was the colleague of Pericles in a high\r\nmilitary command. Thucydides describes the operations of the\r\nPeloponnesian War with the practical knowledge of one who had been in\r\ncharge of a fleet. Ictinus and Pheidias gave shape in stone, not to mere\r\nvisions of the studio, but to the more glorious, because more real and\r\nvivid, perceptions which had been quickened in them by a living\r\ncommunion with the Athenian spirit, by a daily contemplation of Athenian\r\ngreatness, in the theatre where tragic poets idealized the legends of\r\nthe past, in the ecclesia where every citizen had his vote on the policy\r\nof the state, or in that free and gracious society, full of beauty, yet\r\nexempt from vexatious constraint, which belonged to the age of Pericles.\r\nThe tribunal which judged these works of literature or art was such as\r\nwas best fitted to preserve the favourable conditions under which they\r\narose. Criticism was not in the hands of a literary clique or of a\r\nsocial caste. The influence of jealousy or malevolence, and the more\r\nfatal influence of affectation, had little power to affect the verdict.\r\nThe verdict was pronounced by the whole body of the citizens. The\r\nsuccess or failure of a tragedy was decided, not by the minor\r\ncircumstance that it gained the first or second prize, but by the\r\ncollective opinion of the citizens assembled in the theatre of Dionysus.\r\nA work of architecture or sculpture was approved or condemned, not by\r\nthe sentence of a few whom the multitude blindly followed, but by the\r\ngeneral judgment of some twenty thousand persons, each of whom was in\r\nsome degree qualified by education and by habit to form an independent\r\nestimate. The artist worked for all his fellow-citizens, and knew that\r\nhe would be judged by all. The soul of his work was the fresh and living\r\ninspiration of nature; it was the ennobled expression of his own life;\r\nand the public opinion before which it came was free, intelligent and\r\nsincere.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The transition to Hellenism.\r\n\r\nPhilip of Macedon did not take away the municipal independence of the\r\nGreek cities, but he dealt a death-blow to the old political life. The\r\nAthenian poet, historian, artist might still do good work, but he could\r\nnever again have that which used to be the very mainspring of all such\r\nactivity--the daily experience and consciousness of participation in the\r\naffairs of an independent state. He could no longer breathe the\r\ninvigorating air of constitutional freedom, or of the social intercourse\r\nto which that freedom lent dignity as well as grace. Then came\r\nAlexander's conquests; Greek civilization was diffused over Asia and the\r\nEast by means of Greek colonies in which Asiatic and Greek elements were\r\nmingled. The life of such settlements, under the monarchies into which\r\nAlexander's empire broke up, could not be animated by the spirit of the\r\nGreek commonwealths in the old days of political freedom. But the\r\nexternals of Greek life were there--the temples, the statues, the\r\ntheatres, the porticos. Ceremonies and festivals were conducted in the\r\nGreek manner. In private life Greek usages prevailed. Greek was the\r\nlanguage most used; Greek books were in demand. The mixture of races\r\nwould always in some measure distinguish even the outward life of such a\r\ncommunity from that of a pure Greek state; and the facility with which\r\nGreek civilization was adopted would vary in different places. Syria,\r\nfor example, was rapidly and completely Hellenized. Judaea resisted the\r\nprocess to the last. In Egypt a Greek aristocracy of office, birth and\r\nintellect existed side by side with a distinct native life. But, viewed\r\nin its broadest aspect, this new civilization may be called Hellenism.\r\nHellenism (q.v.) means the adoption of Hellenic ways; and it is properly\r\napplied to a civilization, generally Hellenic in external things,\r\npervading people not necessarily or exclusively Hellenic by race. What\r\nthe Hellenic literature was to Hellas, that the Hellenistic literature\r\nwas to Hellenism. The literature of Hellenism has the Hellenic form\r\nwithout the Hellenic soul. The literature of Hellas was creative; the\r\nliterature of Hellenism is derivative.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Alexandrian period.\r\n\r\n  Poetry.\r\n\r\n  Erudition and science.\r\n\r\n  Summary.\r\n\r\nAlexandria was the centre of Greek intellectual activity from Alexander\r\nto Augustus. Its \"Museum,\" or college, and its library, both founded by\r\nthe first Ptolemy (Soter), gave it such attractions for learned men as\r\nno other city could rival. The labours of research or arrangement are\r\nthose which characterize the Alexandrian period. Even in its poetry\r\nspontaneous motive was replaced by erudite skill, as in the hymns,\r\nepigrams and elegies of Callimachus, in the enigmatic verses of\r\nLycophron, in the highly finished epic of Apollonius Rhodius, and in the\r\nversified lore, astronomical or medical, of Aratus and Nicander. The\r\nmimes of Herodas (or Herondas) of Cos (c. 200 B.C.), written in the\r\nIonic dialect and choliambic verse, represent scenes from everyday life.\r\nThe papyrus (published in 1891) contains seven complete poems and\r\nfragments of an eighth. They are remarkably witty and full of shrewd\r\nobservations, but at times coarse. The pastoral poetry of the\r\nage--Dorian by origin--was the most pleasing; for this, if it is to\r\nplease at all, must have its spring in the contemplation of nature.\r\nTheocritus is not exempt from the artificialism of the Hellenizing\r\nliterature; but his true sense of natural beauty entitles him to a place\r\nin the first rank of pastoral poets. Bion of Ionia and Moschus of\r\nSyracuse also charm by the music and often by the pathos of their\r\nbucolic verse. Excavations on the site of the temple of Asclepius at\r\nEpidaurus have brought to light two hexameter poems and a paean (in\r\nIonic metre) on Apollo and Asclepius by a local poet named Isyllus, who\r\nflourished about 280. Tragedy was represented by the poets known as the\r\nAlexandrian _Pleiad_. But it is not for its poetry of any kind that this\r\nperiod of Greek literature is memorable. Its true work was in erudition\r\nand science. Aristarchus (156 B.C.), the greatest in a long line of\r\nAlexandrian critics, set the example of a more thorough method in\r\nrevising and interpreting the ancient texts, and may in this sense be\r\nsaid to have become the founder of scientific scholarship. The critical\r\nstudies of Alexandria, carried on by the followers of Aristarchus,\r\ngradually formed the basis for a science of grammar. The earliest Greek\r\ngrammar is that of Dionysius Thrax (born c. 166), a pupil of\r\nAristarchus. Translation was another province of work which employed the\r\nlearned of Alexandria--where the Septuagint version of the Old Testament\r\nwas begun, probably about 300-250 B.C. Chronology was treated\r\nscientifically by Eratosthenes, and was combined with history by Manetho\r\nin his chronicles of Egypt, and by Berossus in his chronicles of\r\nChaldaea. Euclid was at Alexandria in the reign of Ptolemy Soter.\r\nHerophilus and Erasistratus were distinguished physicians and\r\nanatomists, and the authors of several medical works. The general\r\nresults of the Alexandrian period might perhaps be stated thus.\r\nAlexandria produced a few eminent men of science, some learned poets (in\r\na few cases, of great literary merit) and many able scholars. The\r\npreservation of the best Greek literature was due chiefly to the\r\nunremitting care of the Alexandrian critics, whose appreciation of it\r\npartly compensated for the decay of the old Greek perceptions in\r\nliterature and art, and who did their utmost to hand it down in a form\r\nas free as possible from the errors of copyists. On the whole, the\r\npatronage of letters by the Ptolemies had probably as large a measure of\r\nsuccess as was possible under the existing conditions; and it was\r\nafforded at a time when there was special danger that a true literary\r\ntradition might die out of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Graeco-Roman period.\r\n\r\nThe Graeco-Roman period in the literature of Hellenism may be dated from\r\nthe Roman subjugation of Greece. \"Greece made a captive of the rough\r\nconqueror,\" but it did not follow from this intellectual conquest that\r\nAthens became once more the intellectual centre of the world. Under the\r\nempire, indeed, the university of Athens long enjoyed a pre-eminent\r\nreputation. But Rome gradually became the point to which the greatest\r\nworkers in every kind were drawn. Greek literature had already made a\r\nhome there before the close of the 2nd century B.C. Sulla brought a\r\nGreek library from Athens to Rome. Such men as Cicero and Atticus were\r\nindefatigable collectors and readers of Greek books. The power of\r\nspeaking and writing the Greek language became an indispensable\r\naccomplishment for highly educated Romans. The library planned by Julius\r\nCaesar and founded by Augustus had two principal departments, one for\r\nLatin, the other for Greek works. Tiberius, Vespasian, Domitian and\r\nTrajan contributed to enlarge the collection. Rome became more and more\r\nthe rival of Alexandria, not only as possessing great libraries, but\r\nalso as a seat of learning at which Greek men of letters found\r\nappreciation and encouragement. Greek poetry, especially in its higher\r\nforms, rhetoric and literary criticism, history and philosophy, were all\r\ncultivated by Greek writers at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n  First part: 146-30 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the Graeco-Roman period may be defined as extending\r\nfrom 146 B.C. to the close of the Roman republic. At its commencement\r\nstands the name of one who had more real affinity than any of his\r\ncontemporaries with the great writers of old Athens, and who, at the\r\nsame time, saw most clearly how the empire of the world was passing to\r\nRome. The subject of Polybius (c. 205-120) was the history of Roman\r\nconquest from 264 to 146 B.C. His style, plain and straightforward, is\r\nfree from the florid rhetoric of the time. But the distinction of\r\nPolybius is that he is the last Greek writer who in some measure retains\r\nthe spirit of the old citizen-life. He chose his subject, not because it\r\ngave scope to learning or literary skill, but with a motive akin to that\r\nwhich prompted the history of Thucydides--namely, because, as a Greek\r\ncitizen, he felt intensely the political importance of those wars which\r\nhad given Rome the mastery of the world. The chief historical work which\r\nthe following century produced--the _Universal History_ of Diodorus\r\nSiculus (fl. c. 50 B.C.)--resembled that of Polybius in recognizing Rome\r\nas the political centre of the earth, as the point on which all earlier\r\nseries of events converged. In all else Diodorus represents the new age\r\nin which the Greek historian had no longer the practical knowledge and\r\ninsight of a traveller, a soldier or a statesman, but only the\r\ndiligence, and usually the dullness, of a laborious compiler.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Second part: 30 B.C.-A.D. 529.\r\n\r\nThe Greek literature of the Roman empire, from Augustus to Justinian,\r\nwas enormously prolific. The area over which the Greek language was\r\ndiffused--either as a medium of intercourse or as an established branch\r\nof the higher education--was co-extensive with the empire itself. An\r\nimmense store of materials had now been accumulated, on which critics,\r\ncommentators, compilers, imitators, were employed with incessant\r\nindustry. In very many of its forms, the work of composition or\r\nadaptation had been reduced to a mechanical knack. If there is any one\r\ncharacteristic which broadly distinguishes the Greek literature of these\r\nfive centuries, it is the absence of originality either in form or in\r\nmatter. Lucian is, in his way, a rare exception; and his great\r\npopularity--he is the only Greek writer of this period, except Plutarch,\r\nwho has been widely popular--illustrates the flatness of the arid level\r\nabove which he stands out. The sustained abundance of literary\r\nproduction under the empire was partly due to the fact that there was no\r\nopen political career. Never, probably, was literature so important as a\r\nresource for educated men; and the habit of reciting before friendly or\r\nobsequious audiences swelled the number of writers whose taste had been\r\ncultivated to a point just short of perceiving that they ought not to\r\nwrite.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Departments of prose literature.\r\n\r\nIn the manifold prose work of this period, four principal departments\r\nmay be distinguished. (1) _History_, with _Biography_, and _Geography_.\r\nHistory is represented by Dionysius of Halicarnassus--also memorable for\r\nhis criticisms on the orators and his effort to revive a true standard\r\nof Attic prose--by Cassius Dio, Josephus, Arrian, Appian, Herodian,\r\nEusebius and Zosimus. In biography, the foremost names are Plutarch,\r\nDiogenes Laertius and Philostratus; in geography, Hipparchus of Nicaea,\r\nStrabo, Ptolemy and Pausanias. (2) _Erudition_ and _Science_. The\r\nlearned labours of the Alexandrian schools were continued in all their\r\nvarious fields. Under this head may be mentioned such works as the\r\nlexicons of Julius Pollux, Harpocration and Hesychius, Hephaestion's\r\ntreatise on metre, and Herodian's system of accentuation; the\r\ncommentaries of Galen on Plato and on Hippocrates; the learned\r\nmiscellanies of Athenaeus, Aelian and Stobaeus; and the _Stratagems_ of\r\nPolyaenus. (3) _Rhetoric_ and _Belles-Lettres_. The most popular writers\r\non the theory of rhetoric were Hermagoras, Hermogenes, Aphthonius and\r\nCassius Longinus--the last the reputed author of the essay _On\r\nSublimity_. Among the most renowned teachers of rhetoric--now\r\ndistinctively called \"Sophists,\" or rhetoricians--were Dio Chrysostom,\r\nAelius Aristides, Themistius, Himerius, Libanius and Herodes Atticus.\r\nAkin to the rhetorical exercises were various forms of ornamental or\r\nimaginative prose--dialogues, letters, essays or novels. Lucian, in his\r\ndialogues, exhibits more of the classical style and of the classical\r\nspirit than any writer of the later age; he has also a remarkable\r\naffinity with the tone of modern satire, as in Swift or Voltaire. His\r\nAttic prose, though necessarily artificial, was at least the best that\r\nhad been written for four centuries. The emperor Julian was the author\r\nboth of orations and of satirical pieces. The chief of the Greek\r\nnovelists (the forerunner of whom was Aristides of Miletus, c. 100 B.C.,\r\nin his _Milesian Tales_) are Xenophon of Ephesus and Longus,\r\nrepresenting a purely Greek type of romance, and Heliodorus--with his\r\nimitators Achilles Tatius and Chariton--representing a school influenced\r\nby Oriental fiction. There were also many Christian romances in Greek,\r\nusually of a religious tendency. Alciphron's fictitious\r\n_Letters_--founded largely on the New Comedy of Athens--represent the\r\nsame kind of industry which produced the letters of Phalaris,\r\nAristaenetus and similar collections. (4) _Philosophy_ is represented\r\nchiefly by Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, in both of whom the Stoic\r\nelement is the prevailing one; by the Neoplatonists, such as Plotinus,\r\nPorphyry, Iamblichus; and by Proclus, of that eclectic school which\r\narose at Athens in the 5th century A.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Verse.\r\n\r\n  The Anthology.\r\n\r\nThe Greek poetry of this period presents no work of high merit. Babrius\r\nversified the Aesopic _Fables_; Oppian (or two poets of this name) wrote\r\ndidactic poems on fishing and hunting; Nonnus and Quintus Smyrnaeus made\r\nelaborate essays in epic verse; and the Orphic lore inspired some poems\r\nand hymns of a mystic character. The so-called _Sibylline Oracles_, in\r\nhexameter verse, range in date from about 170 B.C. to A.D. 700, and are\r\npartly the expression of the Jewish longings for the restoration of\r\nIsrael, partly predictions of the triumph of Christianity. By far the\r\nmost pleasing compositions in verse which have come to us from this age\r\nare some of the short poems in the Greek Anthology, which includes some\r\npieces as early as the beginning of the 5th century B.C. and some as\r\nlate as the 6th century of the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe 4th century may be said to mark the beginning of the last stage in\r\nthe decay of literary Hellenism. From that point the decline was rapid\r\nand nearly continuous. The attitude of the church towards it was no\r\nlonger that which had been held by Clement of Alexandria, by Justin\r\nMartyr or by Origen. There was now a Christian Greek literature, and a\r\nChristian Greek eloquence of extraordinary power. The laity became more\r\nand more estranged from the Greek literature--however intrinsically pure\r\nand noble--of the pagan past. At the same time the Greek language--which\r\nhad maintained its purity in Italian seats--was becoming corrupted in\r\nthe new Greek Rome of the East. In A.D. 529 Justinian put forth an edict\r\nby which the schools of heathen philosophy were formally closed. The act\r\nhad at least a symbolical meaning. It is necessary to guard against the\r\nsupposition that such assumed landmarks in political or literary history\r\nalways mark a definite transition from one order of things to another.\r\nBut it is practically convenient, or necessary, to use such landmarks.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--The first attempt at a connected history of Greek\r\n  literature was the monumental and still indispensable work of J. A.\r\n  Fabricius (14 vols., 1705-1728; new ed. in 12 vols. by G. C. Harless,\r\n  1790-1809); this was followed by F. Scholl's _Hist. de la litterature\r\n  grecque_ (1813). Both these works begin with the earliest times and go\r\n  down to the latest period of the Byzantine empire. Of more modern and\r\n  recent works the following may be mentioned: G. Bernhardy, _Grundriss\r\n  der griechischen Literatur_ (1836-1845; 4th ed., 1876-1880; 5th ed. of\r\n  vol. i., by R. Volkmann, 1892), chiefly confined to the poets; C. O.\r\n  Muller, _History of Greek Literature_ (unfinished), written for the\r\n  London Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, and published in\r\n  English in 1840, the translation being by G. Cornewall Lewis and J. W.\r\n  Donaldson (the latter completed the work to the end of the Byzantine\r\n  period for the edition of 1858; the German text was published by E.\r\n  Muller in 1841; 4th ed. by E. Heitz, 1882-1884); W. Mure, _Critical\r\n  History of the Language and Literature of Ancient Greece_ (1850-1857);\r\n  T. Bergk, _Griechische Literaturgeschichte_ (1872-1894, vols. 2, 3,\r\n  ed. G. Hinrichs, vol. 4 by R. Peppmuller) containing epos, lyric,\r\n  drama down to Euripides, and the beginnings of prose; R. Nicolai,\r\n  _Griechische Literaturgeschichte_ (2nd ed., 1873-1878), useful for\r\n  bibliography, but in other respects unsatisfactory; J. P. Mahaffy,\r\n  _Hist. of Classical Greek Literature_ (4th ed., 1903); A. and M.\r\n  Croiset, _Hist. de la litterature grecque_ (1887-1899, 2nd ed. 1896);\r\n  W. Christ, _Geschichte der griechischen Literatur bis auf die Zeit\r\n  Justinians_ (4th ed., 1905; 5th ed., pt. i., by O. Stahlin and W.\r\n  Schmid, 1908), by far the most serviceable handbook for the student.\r\n  F. Susemihl's _Geschichte der griechischen Literatur in der\r\n  Alexandrinerzeit_ (1891-1892) is especially valuable for its notes. Of\r\n  smaller manuals the following will be found most useful: G. G. Murray,\r\n  _History of Ancient Greek Literature_ (1897); F. B. Jevons, _History\r\n  of Greek Literature_ (3rd ed., 1900) down to the time of Demosthenes;\r\n  A. and M. Croiset, _Manuel d'hist. de la litterature grecque_ (1900;\r\n  Eng. trans., by G. F. Heffelbower, N.Y., 1904); also the general\r\n  sketches by U. von Wilamowitz-Mollendorff in _Die Kultur der\r\n  Gegenwart_, i. 8 (1905), by A. Gercke in the _Sammlung Goschen_\r\n  (Leipzig, 2nd ed., 1905), and by R. C. Jebb in _Companion to Greek\r\n  Studies_ (Cambridge, 1905). Other works generally connected with the\r\n  subject are: E. Hubner, _Bibliographie der klassischen\r\n  Altertumswissenschaft_ (2nd ed., 1889), pp. 161-17l; W. Engelmann,\r\n  _Bibliotheca scriptorum classicorum_ (8th ed., by E. Preuss, 1880); J.\r\n  B. Mayor, _Guide to the Choice of Classical Books_ (1896), p. 86; W.\r\n  Kroll, _Die Altertumswissenschaft im letzten Vierteljahrhundert_\r\n  1875-1900 (1905), p. 465 foll.; J. E. Sandys, _History of Classical\r\n  Scholarship_ (1906-1908); \"Bibliotheca philologica classica,\" in C.\r\n  Bursian's _Jahresbericht uber die Fortschritte der klassischen\r\n  Altertumswissenschaft_; articles in Pauly-Wissowa's _Realencyclopadie\r\n  der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft_ (1894--).     (R. C. J.; X.)\r\n\r\n\r\nII. BYZANTINE LITERATURE\r\n\r\n  Definition.\r\n\r\nBy \"Byzantine literature\" is generally meant the literature, written in\r\nGreek, of the so-called Byzantine period. There is no justification\r\nwhatever for the inclusion of Latin works of the time of the East Roman\r\nempire. The close of the Byzantine period is clearly marked by the year\r\n1453, at which date, with the fall of the Eastern empire, the peculiar\r\nculture and literary life of the Byzantines came to an end. It is only\r\nas regards the beginning of the Byzantine period that any doubts exist.\r\nThere are no sufficient grounds for dating it from Justinian, as was\r\nformerly often done. In surveying the whole development of the\r\npolitical, ecclesiastical and literary life and of the general culture\r\nof the Roman empire, and particularly of its eastern portion, we arrive,\r\non the contrary, at the conclusion that the actual date of the beginning\r\nof this new era--i.e. the Christian-Byzantine, in contradistinction to\r\nthe Pagan-Greek and Pagan-Roman--falls within the reign of Constantine\r\nthe Great. By the foundation of the new capital city of Constantinople\r\n(which lay amid Greek surroundings) and by the establishment of the\r\nChristian faith as the state religion, Constantine finally broke with\r\nthe Roman-Pagan tradition, and laid the foundation of the\r\nChristian-Byzantine period of development. Moreover, in the department\r\nof language, so closely allied with that of literature, the 4th century\r\nmarks a new epoch. About this time occurred the final disappearance of a\r\ncharacteristic of the ancient Greek language, important alike in poetry\r\nand in rhythmic prose, the difference of \"quantity.\" Its place was\r\nhenceforth taken by the accent, which became a determining principle in\r\npoetry, as well as for the rhythmic conclusion of the prose sentence.\r\nThus the transition from the old musical language to a modern\r\nconversational idiom was complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transitional period.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Constantine the Great undoubtedly marks the beginning of a\r\nnew period in the most important spheres of national life, but it is\r\nequally certain that in most of them ancient tradition long continued to\r\nexercise an influence. Sudden breaches of continuity are less common in\r\nthe general culture and literary life of the world than in its political\r\nor ecclesiastical development. This is true of the transition from pagan\r\nantiquity to the Christian middle ages. Many centuries passed before the\r\nfinal victory of the new religious ideas and the new spirit in public\r\nand private intellectual and moral life. The last noteworthy remnants of\r\npaganism disappeared as late as the 6th and 7th centuries. The last\r\ngreat educational establishment which rested upon pagan foundations--the\r\nuniversity of Athens--was not abolished till A.D. 529. The Hellenizing\r\nof the seat of empire and of the state, which was essential to the\r\nindependent development of Byzantine literature, proceeds yet more\r\nslowly. The first purely _Greek_ emperor was Tiberius II. (578-582); but\r\nthe complete Hellenizing of the character of the state had not been\r\naccomplished until the 7th century. We shall, therefore, regard the\r\nperiod from the 4th to the 7th century as that of the transition between\r\nancient times and the middle ages. This period coincides with the rise\r\nof a new power in the world's history--Islam. But though, in this\r\ntransitional period, the old and the new elements are both to a large\r\nextent present and are often inextricably interwoven, yet it is certain\r\nthat the new elements are, both as regards their essential force and\r\ntheir influence upon the succeeding period, of infinitely greater moment\r\nthan the decrepit and mostly artificial survivals of the antique.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mixed character of Byzantine culture.\r\n\r\nIn order to estimate rightly the character of Byzantine literature and\r\nits distinctive peculiarities, in contradistinction to ancient Greek, it\r\nis imperative to examine the great difference between the civilizations\r\nthat produced them. The Byzantine did not possess the homogeneous,\r\norganically constructed system of the ancient civilization, but was the\r\noutcome of an amalgamation of which Hellenism formed the basis. For,\r\nalthough the Latin character of the empire was at first completely\r\nretained, even after its final division in 395, yet the dominant\r\nposition of Greek in the Eastern empire gradually led to the Hellenizing\r\nof the state. The last great act of the Latin tradition was the\r\ncodification, in the Latin language, of the law by Justinian (527-565).\r\nBut it is significant that the _Novels_ of Justinian were composed\r\npartly in Greek, as were all the laws of the succeeding period. Of the\r\nemperors in the centuries following Justinian, many of course were\r\nforeigners, Isaurians, Armenians and others; but in language and\r\neducation they were all Greeks. In the last five centuries of the\r\nempire, under the Comneni and the Palaeologi, court and state are purely\r\nGreek.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the dominant position of Greek in the Eastern empire, a\r\nlinguistic and national uniformity such as formed the foundation of the\r\nold Latin _Imperium Romanum_ never existed there. In the West, with the\r\nexpansion of Rome's political supremacy, the Latin language and Latin\r\nculture were everywhere introduced--first into the non-Latin provinces\r\nof Italy, later into Spain, Gaul and North Africa, and at last even into\r\ncertain parts of the Eastern empire. This Latinizing was so thorough\r\nthat it weathered all storms, and, in the countries affected by it, was\r\nthe parent of new and vigorous nationalities, the French, the Spaniards,\r\nthe Portuguese and the Rumanians. Only in Africa did \"Latinism\" fail to\r\ntake root permanently. From the 6th century that province relapsed into\r\nthe hands of the native barbarians and of the immigrant Arabs, and both\r\nthe Latin and the Greek influences (which had grown in strength during\r\nthe period of the Eastern empire) were, together with Christianity,\r\nswept away without leaving a trace behind. It might have been expected\r\nthat the Hellenizing of the political system of the Eastern empire would\r\nhave likewise entailed the Hellenizing of the non-Greek portions of the\r\nempire. Such, however, was not the case; for all the conditions\r\nprecedent to such a development were wanting. The non-Greek portions of\r\nthe Eastern empire were not, from the outset, gradually incorporated\r\ninto the state from a Greek centre, as were the provinces in the West\r\nfrom a Latin centre. They had been acquired in the old period of the\r\nhomogeneous Latin _Imperium_. In the centuries immediately following the\r\ndivision of the empire, the idea of Hellenizing the Eastern provinces\r\ncould not take root, owing to the fact that Latin was retained, at least\r\nin principle, as the state language. During the later centuries, in the\r\nnon-Greek parts, centrifugal tendencies and the destructive inroads of\r\nbarbarians began on all sides; and the government was too much occupied\r\nwith the all but impossible task of preserving the political unity of\r\nthe empire to entertain seriously the wider aim of an assimilation of\r\nlanguage and culture. Moreover, the Greeks did not possess that enormous\r\npolitical energy and force which enabled the Romans to assimilate\r\nforeign races; and, finally, they were confronted by sturdy Oriental,\r\nmostly Semitic, peoples, who were by no means so easy to subjugate as\r\nwere the racially related inhabitants of Gaul and Spain. Their\r\nimpotence against the peoples of the East will be still less hardly\r\njudged if we remember the fact already mentioned, that even the Romans\r\nwere within a short period driven back and overwhelmed by the North\r\nAfrican Semites who for centuries had been subjected to an apparently\r\nthorough process of Latinization.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Greek culture then, was very slight; how little indeed\r\nit penetrated into the oriental mind is shown by the fact that, after\r\nthe violent Arab invasion in the south-east corner of the Mediterranean,\r\nthe Copts and Syrians were able to retain their language and their\r\nnational characteristics, while Greek culture almost completely\r\ndisappeared. The one great instance of assimilation of foreign\r\nnationalities by the Greeks is the Hellenizing of the Slavs, who from\r\nthe 6th century had migrated into central Greece and the Peloponnese.\r\nAll other non-Greek tribes of any importance which came, whether for\r\nlonger or for shorter periods, within the sphere of the Eastern empire\r\nand its civilization--such as the Copts, Syrians, Armenians, Georgians,\r\nRumanians, Serbs, Bulgarians, Albanians--one and all retained their\r\nnationality and language. The complete Latinizing of the West has,\r\naccordingly, no counterpart in a similar Hellenizing of the East. This\r\nis clearly shown during the Byzantine period in the progress of\r\nChristianity. Everywhere in the West, even among the non-Romanized\r\nAnglo-Saxons, Irish and Germans, Latin maintained its position in the\r\nchurch services and in the other branches of the ecclesiastical system;\r\ndown to the Reformation the church remained a complete organic unity. In\r\nthe East, at the earliest period of its conversion to Christianity,\r\nseveral foreign tongues competed with Greek, i.e. Syrian, Coptic,\r\nArmenian, Georgian, Gothic, Old-Bulgarian and others. The sacred books\r\nwere translated into these languages and the church services were held\r\nin them and not in Greek. One noticeable effect of this linguistic\r\ndivision in the church was the formation of various sects and national\r\nchurches (cf. the Coptic Nestorians, the Syrian Monophysites, the\r\nArmenian and, in more recent times, the Slavonic national churches). The\r\nChurch of the West was characterized by uniformity in language and in\r\nconstitution. In the Eastern Church parallel to the multiplicity of\r\nlanguages developed also a corresponding variety of doctrine and\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Roman influence.\r\n\r\nThough the character of Byzantine culture is mainly Greek, and Byzantine\r\nliterature is attached by countless threads to ancient Greek literature,\r\nyet the Roman element forms a very essential part of it. The whole\r\npolitical character of the Byzantine empire is, despite its Greek form\r\nand colouring, genuinely Roman. Legislation and administration, the\r\nmilitary and naval traditions, are old Roman work, and as such, apart\r\nfrom immaterial alterations, they continued to exist and operate, even\r\nwhen the state in head and limbs had become Greek. It is strange,\r\nindeed, how strong was the political conception of the Roman state\r\n(_Staatsgedanke_), and with what tenacity it held its own, even under\r\nthe most adverse conditions, down to the latter days of the empire. The\r\nGreeks even adopted the name \"Romans,\" which gradually became so closely\r\nidentified with them as to supersede the name \"Hellenes\"; and thus a\r\npolitical was gradually converted into an ethnographical and linguistic\r\ndesignation. _Rhomaioi_ was the most common popular term for Greeks\r\nduring the Turkish period, and remains so still. The old glorious name\r\n\"Hellene\" was used under the empire and even during the middle ages in a\r\ncontemptuous sense--\"Heathen\"--and has only in quite modern times, on\r\nthe formation of the kingdom of \"Hellas,\" been artificially revived. The\r\nvast organization of the Roman political system could not but exercise\r\nin various ways a profound influence upon Byzantine civilization; and it\r\noften seemed as if Roman political principles had educated and nerved\r\nthe unpolitical Greek people to great political enterprise. The Roman\r\ninfluence has left distinct traces in the Greek language, Greek of the\r\nByzantine and modern period is rich in Latin terms for conceptions\r\nconnected with the departments of justice, administration and the\r\nimperial court. In literature such \"barbarisms\" were avoided as far as\r\npossible, and were replaced by Greek periphrases.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Christianity.\r\n\r\n  The Orient.\r\n\r\nBut by far the most momentous and radical change wrought on the old\r\nHellenism was effected by Christianity; and yet the transition was, in\r\nfact, by no means so abrupt as one might be led to believe by comparing\r\nthe Pagan-Hellenic culture of Plato's day with the Christian-Byzantine\r\nof the time of Justinian. For the path had been most effectually\r\nprepared for the new religion by the crumbling away of the ancient\r\nbelief in the gods, by the humane doctrine of the Stoics, and, finally,\r\nby the mystic intellectual tendencies of Neoplatonism. Moreover, in many\r\nrespects Christianity met paganism halfway by adapting itself to popular\r\nusages and ideas and by adopting important parts of the pagan\r\nliterature. The whole educational system especially, even in Christian\r\ntimes, was in a very remarkable manner based almost entirely on the\r\nmethods and material inherited from paganism. Next to the influences of\r\nRome and of Christianity, that of the East was of importance in\r\ndeveloping the Byzantine civilization, and in lending Byzantine\r\nliterature its distinctive character. Much that was oriental in the\r\nEastern empire dates back to ancient times, notably to the period of\r\nAlexander the Great and his successors. Since the Greeks had at that\r\nperiod Hellenized the East to the widest extent, and had already founded\r\neverywhere flourishing cities, they themselves fell under the manifold\r\ninfluences of the soil they occupied. In Egypt, Palestine and Syria, in\r\nAsia Minor as far inland as Mesopotamia, Greek and oriental\r\ncharacteristics were often blended. In respect of the wealth and the\r\nlong duration of its Greek intellectual life, Egypt stands supreme. It\r\ncovers a period of nearly a thousand years from the foundation of\r\nAlexandria down to the conquest of Egypt by the Arabs (A.D. 643). The\r\nreal significance of Egyptian Hellenism during this long period can be\r\nproperly estimated only if a practical attempt be made to eliminate from\r\nthe history of Greek literature and science in pagan and in Christian\r\ntimes all that owed its origin to the land of the Nile. The soil of\r\nEgypt proved itself especially productive of Greek literature under the\r\nCross (Origen, Athanasius, Arius, Synesius), in the same way as the soil\r\nof North Africa was productive of Latin literature (Tertullian, Cyprian,\r\nLactantius, Augustine). Monastic life, which is one of the chief\r\ncharacteristic elements of Christian-Byzantine civilization, had its\r\nbirth in Egypt.\r\n\r\nSyria and Palestine came under the influence of Greek civilization at a\r\nlater date than Egypt. In these, Greek literature and culture attained\r\ntheir highest development between the 3rd and the 8th centuries of the\r\nChristian era. Antioch rose to great influence, owing at first to its\r\npagan school of rhetoric and later to its Christian school of exegesis.\r\nGaza was renowned for its school of rhetoric; Berytus for its academy of\r\nlaw. It is no mere accident that sacred poetry, aesthetically the most\r\nvaluable class of Byzantine literature, was born in Syria and Palestine.\r\n\r\nIn Asia Minor, the cities of Tarsus, Caesarea, Nicaea, Smyrna, Ephesus,\r\nNicopolis, &c., were all influential centres of Greek culture and\r\nliterature. For instance, the three great fathers of Cappadocia, Basil,\r\nGregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus all belonged to Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nIf all the greater Greek authors of the first eight centuries of the\r\nChristian era, i.e. the period of the complete development of Byzantine\r\nculture, be classified according to the countries of their birth, the\r\nsignificant fact becomes evident that nine-tenths come from the African\r\nand Asiatic districts, which were for the most part opened up only after\r\nAlexander the Great, and only one-tenth from European Greece. In other\r\nwords, the old original European Greece was, under the emperors,\r\ncompletely outstripped in intellectual productive force by the newly\r\nfounded African and Asiatic Greece. This huge tide of conquest which\r\nsurged from Greece over African and Syrian territories occupied largely\r\nby foreign races and ancient civilizations, could not fail to be fraught\r\nwith serious consequences for the Greeks themselves. The experience of\r\nthe Romans in their conquest of Greece (_Graecia capta ferum victorem\r\ncepit_) repeated itself in the conquest of the East by Greece, though to\r\na minor extent and in a different way. The whole literature of Egypt,\r\nSyria and Asia Minor cannot, despite its international and cosmopolitan\r\ncharacter, disavow the influence of the Oriental soil on which it was\r\nnourished. Yet the growth of too strong a local colouring in its\r\nliterature was repressed, partly by the checks imposed by ancient Greek\r\ntradition, partly by the spirit of Christianity which reconciled all\r\nnational distinctions. Even more clearly and unmistakably is Oriental\r\ninfluence shown in the province of Byzantine art, as Joseph Strzygowski\r\nhas conclusively proved.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Language.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of Greek literature from the close of ancient times\r\ndown to the threshold of modern history was written in a language\r\nidentical in its principal features with the common literary language,\r\nthe so-called Koine, which had its origin in the Alexandrian age. This\r\nis the literary form of Greek as a universal language, though a form\r\nthat scintillates with many facets, from an almost Attic diction down to\r\none that approaches the language of everyday life such as we have, for\r\ninstance, in the New Testament. From what has been already said, it\r\nfollows that this stable literary language cannot always have remained a\r\nlanguage of ordinary life. For, like every living tongue, the vernacular\r\nGreek continually changed in pronunciation and form, as well as in\r\nvocabulary and grammar, and thus the living language surely and\r\ngradually separated itself from the rigid written language. This gulf\r\nwas, moreover, considerably widened owing to the fact that there took\r\nplace in the written language a retrograde movement, the so-called\r\n\"Atticism.\" Introduced by Dionysius of Halicarnassus in the 1st century\r\nbefore Christ, this linguistic-literary fashion attained its greatest\r\nheight in the 2nd century A.D., but still continued to flourish in\r\nsucceeding centuries, and, indirectly, throughout the whole Byzantine\r\nperiod. It is true that it often seemed as though the living language\r\nwould be gradually introduced into literature; for several writers, such\r\nas the chronicler Malalas in the 6th century, Leontius of Neapolis (the\r\nauthor of _Lives of Saints_) in the 7th century, the chronicler\r\nTheophanes at the beginning of the 9th century, and the emperor\r\nConstantine Porphyrogenitus in the 10th century, made in their writings\r\nnumerous concessions to the living language. This progressive tendency\r\nmight well have led, in the 11th and 12th centuries, to the founding in\r\nthe Greek vernacular of a new literary language similar to the promising\r\nnational languages and literature which, at that period, in the Romance\r\ncountries, developed out of the despised popular idiom. In the case of\r\nthe Byzantines, unfortunately, such a radical change never took place.\r\nAll attempts in the direction of a popular reform of the literary\r\nlanguage, which were occasionally made in the period from the 6th to the\r\n10th centuries, were in turn extinguished by the resuscitation of\r\nclassical studies, a movement which, begun in the 9th century by Photius\r\nand continued in the 11th by Psellus, attained its full development\r\nunder the Comneni and the Palaeologi. This classical renaissance turned\r\nback the literary language into the old ossified forms, as had\r\npreviously happened in the case of the Atticism of the early centuries\r\nof the empire. In the West, humanism (so closely connected with the\r\nByzantine renaissance under the Comneni and the Palaeologi) also\r\nartificially reintroduced the \"Ciceronian\" Latin, but was unable\r\nseriously to endanger the development of the national languages, which\r\nhad already attained to full vitality. In Byzantium, the humanistic\r\nmovement came prematurely, and crushed the new language before it had\r\nfairly established itself. Thus the language of the Byzantine writers of\r\nthe 11th-15th centuries is almost Old Greek in colour; artificially\r\nlearnt by grammar, lexicon and assiduous reading, it followed Attic\r\nmodels more and more slavishly; to such an extent that, in determining\r\nthe date of works, the paradoxical principle holds good that the more\r\nancient the language, the more recent the author.\r\n\r\nOwing to this artificial return to ancient Greek, the contrast that had\r\nlong existed with the vernacular was now for the first time fully\r\nrevealed. The gulf between the two forms of language could no longer be\r\nbridged; and this fact found its expression in literature also. While\r\nthe vulgarizing authors of the 6th-10th centuries, like the\r\nLatin-writing Franks (such as Gregory of Tours), still attempted a\r\ncompromise between the language of the schools and that of conversation,\r\nwe meet after the 12th century with authors who freely and naturally\r\nemployed the vernacular in their literary works. They accordingly form\r\nthe Greek counterpart of the oldest writers in Italian, French and other\r\nRomance languages. That they could not succeed like their Roman\r\ncolleagues, and always remained the pariahs of Greek literature, is due\r\nto the all-powerful philological-antiquarian tendency which existed\r\nunder the Comneni and the Palaeologi. Yet once more did the vernacular\r\nattempt to assert its literary rights, i.e. in Crete and some other\r\nislands in the 16th and 17th centuries. But this attempt also was foiled\r\nby the classical reaction of the 19th century. Hence it comes about that\r\nGreek literature even in the 20th century employs grammatical forms\r\nwhich were obsolete long before the 10th century. Thus the Greeks, as\r\nregards their literary language, came into a _cul de sac_ similar to\r\nthat in which certain rigidly conservative Oriental nations find\r\nthemselves, e.g. the Arabs and Chinese, who, not possessing a literary\r\nlanguage suited to modern requirements, have to content themselves with\r\nthe dead Old-Arabic or the ossified Mandarin language. The divorce of\r\nthe written and spoken languages is the most prominent and also the most\r\nfatal heritage that the modern Greeks have received from their Byzantine\r\nforefathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  General character of Byzantine literature.\r\n\r\nThe whole Byzantine intellectual life, like that of the Western medieval\r\nperiod, is dominated by theological interests. Theology accordingly, in\r\nliterature too, occupies the chief place, in regard to both quantity and\r\nquality. Next to it comes the writing of history, which the Byzantines\r\ncultivated with great conscientiousness until after the fall of the\r\nempire. All other kinds of prose writing, e.g. in geography, philosophy,\r\nrhetoric and the technical sciences, were comparatively neglected, and\r\nsuch works are of value for the most part only in so far as they\r\npreserve and interpret old material. In poetry, again, theology takes\r\nthe lead. The poetry of the Church produced works of high aesthetic\r\nmerit and enduring value. In secular poetry, the writing of epigrams\r\nespecially was cultivated with assiduity and often with ability. In\r\npopular literature poetry predominates, and many productions worthy of\r\nnotice, new both in matter and in form, are here met with.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Theology.\r\n\r\nThe great classical period of Greek theological literature is that of\r\nthe 4th century. Various factors contributed to this result--some of\r\nthem positive, particularly the establishment of Christianity as the\r\nofficial religion and the protection accorded to it by the state, others\r\nnegative, i.e. the heretical movements, especially Arianism, which at\r\nthis period arose in the east of the empire and threatened the unity of\r\nthe doctrine and organization of the church. It was chiefly against\r\nthese that the subtle Athanasius of Alexandria directed his attacks. The\r\nlearned Eusebius founded a new department of literature, church history.\r\nIn Egypt, Antonius (St Anthony) founded the Greek monastic system;\r\nSynesius of Cyrene, like his greater contemporary Augustine in the West,\r\nrepresents both in his life and in his writings the difficult transition\r\nfrom Plato to Christ. At the centre, in the forefront of the great\r\nintellectual movement of this century, stand the three great\r\nCappadocians, Basil the Great, the subtle dogmatist, his brother Gregory\r\nof Nyssa, the philosophically trained defender of the Christian faith,\r\nand Gregory of Nazianzus, the distinguished orator and poet. Closely\r\nallied to them was St Chrysostom, the courageous champion of\r\necclesiastical liberty and of moral purity. To modern readers the\r\ngreater part of this literature appears strange and foreign; but, in\r\norder to be appreciated rightly, it must be regarded as the outcome of\r\nthe period in which it was produced, a period stirred to its depths by\r\nreligious emotions. For the times in which they lived and for their\r\nreaders, the Greek fathers reached the highest attainable; though, of\r\ncourse, they produced nothing of such general human interest, nothing\r\nso deep and true, as the _Confessions_ of St Augustine, with which the\r\npoetical autobiography of Gregory of Nazianzus cannot for a moment be\r\ncompared.\r\n\r\nThe glorious bloom of the 4th century was followed by a perceptible\r\ndecay in theological intellectual activity. Independent production was\r\nin succeeding centuries almost solely prompted by divergent dogmatical\r\nviews and heresies, for the refutation of which orthodox authors were\r\nimpelled to take up the pen. In the 5th and 6th centuries a more copious\r\nliterature was called into existence by the Monophysites, who maintained\r\nthat there was but _one_ nature in Christ; in the 7th century by the\r\nMonothelites, who acknowledged but _one_ will in Christ; in the 8th\r\ncentury by the Iconoclasts and by the new teaching of Mahomet. One very\r\neminent theologian, whose importance it has been reserved for modern\r\ntimes to estimate aright--Leontius of Byzantium (6th century)--was the\r\nfirst to introduce Aristotelian definitions into theology, and may thus\r\nbe called the first scholastic. In his works he attacked the heretics of\r\nhis age, particularly the Monophysites, who were also assailed by his\r\ncontemporary Anastasius of Antioch. The chief adversaries of the\r\nMonothelites were Sophronius, patriarch of Jerusalem (whose main\r\nimportance, however, is due to his work in other fields, in hagiography\r\nand homiletics), Maximus the Confessor, and Anastasius Sinaites, who\r\nalso composed an interpretation of the _Hexaemeron_ in twelve books.\r\nAmong writers in the departments of critical interpretation and\r\nasceticism in this period must be enumerated Procopius of Gaza, who\r\ndevoted himself principally to the exegesis of the Old Testament;\r\nJohannes Climax (6th century), named after his much-read ascetic work\r\n_Klimax_ (Jacob's ladder); and Johannes Moschus (d. 619), whose chief\r\nwork _Leimon_ (\"spiritual pasture\") describes monastic life in the form\r\nof statements and narratives of their experiences by monks themselves.\r\nThe last great heresy, which shook the Greek Church to its very\r\nfoundations, the Iconoclast movement, summoned to the fray the last\r\ngreat Greek theologian, John of Damascus (Johannes Damascenus). Yet his\r\nchief merit lies not so much in his polemical speeches against the\r\nIconoclasts, and in his much admired but over-refined poetry, as in his\r\ngreat dogmatic work, _The Fountain of Knowledge_, which contains the\r\nfirst comprehensive exposition of Christian dogma. It has remained the\r\nstandard work on Greek theology down to the present day. Just as the\r\ninternal development of the Greek Church in all essentials reached its\r\nlimit with the Iconoclasts, so also its productive intellectual activity\r\nceased with John of Damascus. Such theological works as were\r\nsubsequently produced, consisted mostly in the interpretation and\r\nrevision of old materials. An extremely copious, but unfruitful,\r\nliterature was produced by the disputes about the reunion of the Greek\r\nand Roman Churches. Of a more independent character is the literature\r\nwhich in the 14th century centred round the dissensions of the\r\nHesychasts.\r\n\r\nAmong theologians after John of Damascus must be mentioned: the emperor\r\nLeo VI., the Wise (886-911), who wrote numerous homilies and church\r\nhymns, and Theodorus of Studium (759-826), who in his numerous writings\r\naffords us instructive glimpses of monastic life. Pre-eminent stands the\r\nfigure of the patriarch Photius. Yet his importance consists less in his\r\nwritings, which often, to a remarkable extent, lack independence of\r\nthought and judgment, than in his activity as a prince of the church.\r\nFor he it was who carried the differences which had already repeatedly\r\narisen between Rome and Constantinople to a point at which\r\nreconciliation was impossible, and was mainly instrumental in preparing\r\nthe way for the separation of the Greek and Latin Churches accomplished\r\nin 1054 under the patriarch Michael Cerularius. In the 11th century the\r\npolyhistor Michael Psellus also wrote polemics against the Euchites,\r\namong whom the Syrian Gnosis was reviving. All literature, including\r\ntheology, experienced a considerable revival under the Comneni. In the\r\nreign of Alexius I. Comnenus (1081-1118), Euthymius Zigabenus wrote his\r\ngreat dogmatic work, the _Dogmatic Panoply_, which, like _The Fountain\r\nof Knowledge_ of John of Damascus in earlier times, was partly positive,\r\nfurnishing an armoury of theology, partly negative and directed against\r\nthe sects. In addition to attacking the dead and buried doctrines of the\r\nMonothelites, Iconoclasts, &c., to fight which was at this time a mere\r\ntilting at windmills, Zigabenus also carried on a polemic against the\r\nheretics of his own day, the Armenians, Bogomils and Saracens.\r\nZigabenus's _Panoply_ was continued and enlarged a century later by the\r\nhistorian Nicetas Acominatus, who published it under the title _Treasure\r\nof Orthodoxy_. To the writings against ancient heresies were next added\r\na flood of tracts, of all shapes and sizes, \"against the Latins,\" i.e.\r\nagainst the Roman Church, and among their authors must also be\r\nenumerated an emperor, the gifted Theodore II. Lascaris (1254-1258). The\r\nchief champion of the union with the Roman Church was the learned\r\nJohannes Beccus (patriarch of Constantinople 1275-1282). Of his\r\nopponents by far the most eminent was Gregory of Cyprus, who succeeded\r\nhim on the patriarchal throne. The fluctuations in the fortunes of the\r\ntwo ecclesiastical parties are reflected in the occupation of the\r\npatriarchal throne. The battles round the question of the union, which\r\nwere waged with southern passion, were for a while checked by the\r\ndissensions aroused by the mystic tendency of the Hesychasts. The\r\nimpetus to this great literary movement was given by the monk Barlaam, a\r\nnative of Calabria, who came forward in Constantinople as an opponent of\r\nthe Latins and was in 1339 entrusted by Andronicus III. with a mission\r\nto Pope Benedict XII. at Avignon. He condemned the doctrine of the\r\nHesychasts, and attacked them both orally and in writing. Among those\r\nwho shared his views are conspicuous the historian Nicephorus Gregoras\r\nand Gregorius Acindynus, the latter of whom closely followed Thomas\r\nAquinas in his writings. In fact the struggle against the Hesychasts was\r\nessentially a struggle between sober western scholasticism and dreamy\r\nGraeco-Oriental mysticism. On the side of the Hesychasts fought\r\nGregorius Palamas, who tried to give a dogmatic foundation to the\r\nmysticism of the Hesychasts, Cabasilas, and the emperor John VI.\r\nCantacuzenus who, after his deposition, sought, in the peaceful retreat\r\nof a monastery, consolation in theological studies, and in his literary\r\nworks refuted the Jews and the Mahommedans. For the greatest Byzantine\r\n\"apologia\" against Islamism we are indebted to an emperor, Manuel II.\r\nPalaeologus (1391-1425), who by learned discussions tried to make up for\r\nthe deficiency in martial prowess shown by the Byzantines in their\r\nstruggle with the Turks. On the whole, theological literature was in the\r\nlast century of the empire almost completely occupied with the struggles\r\nfor and against the union with Rome. The reason lay in the political\r\nconditions. The emperors saw more and more clearly that without the aid\r\nof the West they would no longer be able to stand their ground against\r\nthe Turks, the vanguard of the armies of the Crescent; while the\r\nmajority of Byzantine theologians feared that the assistance of the West\r\nwould force the Greeks to unite with Rome, and thereby to forfeit their\r\necclesiastical independence. Considering the supremacy of the\r\ntheological party in Byzantium, it was but natural that religious\r\nconsiderations should gain the day over political; and this was the view\r\nalmost universally held by the Byzantines in the later centuries of the\r\nempire; in the words of the chronicler Ducas: \"it is better to fall into\r\nthe hands of the Turks than into those of the Franks.\" The chief\r\nopponent of the union was Marcus Eugenicus, metropolitan of Ephesus,\r\nwho, at the Council of Florence in 1439, denounced the union with Rome\r\naccomplished by John VIII. Palaeologus. Conspicuous there among the\r\npartisans of the union, by reason of his erudition and general literary\r\nmerit, was Bessarion, afterwards cardinal, whose chief activity already\r\nfalls under the head of Graeco-Italian humanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hagiography.\r\n\r\nHagiography, i.e. the literature of the acts of the martyrs and the\r\nlives of the saints, forms an independent group and one comparatively\r\nunaffected by dogmatic struggles. The main interest centres here round\r\nthe objects described, the personalities of the martyrs and saints\r\nthemselves. The authors, on the other hand--the _Acts of the Martyrs_\r\nare mostly anonymous--keep more in the background than in other branches\r\nof literature. The man whose name is mainly identified with Greek\r\nhagiography, Symeon Metaphrastes, is important not as an original\r\nauthor, but only as an editor. Symeon revised in the 10th century,\r\naccording to the rhetorical and linguistic principles of his day,\r\nnumerous old _Acts of the Martyrs_, and incorporated them in a\r\ncollection consisting of several volumes, which was circulated in\r\ninnumerable copies, and thus to a great extent superseded the older\r\noriginal texts. These _Acts of the Martyrs_, in point of time, are\r\nanterior to our period; but of the _Lives of Saints_ the greater portion\r\nbelong to Byzantine literature. They began with biographies of monks\r\ndistinguished for their saintly living, such as were used by Palladius\r\nabout 420 in his _Historia Lausiaca_. The most famous work of this\r\ndescription is that by Athanasius of Alexandria, viz. the biography of\r\nSt Anthony, the founder of monachism. In the 6th century Cyril of\r\nScythopolis wrote several lives of saints, distinguished by a simple and\r\nstraightforward style. More expert than any one else in reproducing the\r\nnaive popular style was Leontius of Neapolis in Cyprus who, in the 7th\r\ncentury, wrote, among other works, a life of St John the Merciful,\r\narchbishop of Alexandria, which is very remarkable as illustrating the\r\nsocial and intellectual conditions of the time. From the popular _Lives\r\nof Saints_, which for the reading public of the middle ages formed the\r\nchief substitute for modern \"belles lettres,\" it is easy to trace the\r\ntransition to the religious novel. The most famous work of this class is\r\nthe history of BARLAAM AND JOSAPHAT (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Religious poetry.\r\n\r\nThe religious poetry of the Greeks primarily suffered from the influence\r\nof the ancient Greek form, which was fatal to original development. The\r\noldest work of this class is the hymn, composed in anapaestic monometers\r\nand dimeters, which was handed down in the manuscripts with the\r\n_Paedagogus_ of Clement of Alexandria (d. about 215), but was probably\r\nnot his work. The next piece of this class is the famous \"Maidens' Song\"\r\nin the _Banquet_ of St Methodius (d. about 311), in which many striking\r\nviolations of the old rules of quantity are already apparent. More\r\nfaithful to the tradition of the schools was Gregory of Nazianzus. But,\r\nowing to the fact that he generally employed antiquated versification\r\nand very erudite language, his poems failed to reach the people or to\r\nfind a place in the services of the church. Just as little could the\r\nartificial paraphrase of the Psalms composed by the younger Apollinaris,\r\nor the subtle poems of Synesius, become popular. It became more and more\r\npatent that, with the archaic metre which was out of keeping with the\r\ncharacter of the living language, no genuine poetry suited to the age\r\ncould possibly be produced. Fortunately, an entirely new form of\r\npoetical art was discovered, which conferred upon the Greek people the\r\nblessings of an intelligible religious poetry--the rhythmic poem. This\r\nno longer depended on difference of quantity in the syllables, which had\r\ndisappeared from the living language, but on the accent. Yet the\r\ntransition was not effected by the substitution of accent for the old\r\nlong syllables; the ancient verse form was entirely abandoned, and in\r\nits stead new and variously constructed lines and strophes were formed.\r\nIn the history of the rhythmic sacred poetry three periods are clearly\r\nmarked--the preparatory period; that of the hymns; and that of the\r\n_Canones_. About the first period we know, unfortunately, comparatively\r\nlittle. It appears that in it church music was in the main confined to\r\nthe insertion of short songs between the Psalms or other portions of\r\nHoly Writ and the acclamations of the congregation. The oldest rhythmic\r\nsongs date from Gregory of Nazianzus--his \"Maidens' Song\" and his\r\n\"Evening Hymn.\" Church poetry reached its highest expression in the\r\nsecond period, in the grand development of the hymns, i.e. lengthy songs\r\ncomprising from twenty to thirty similarly constructed strophes, each\r\nconnected with the next in acrostic fashion. Hymnology, again, attained\r\nits highest perfection in the first half of the 6th century with\r\nRomanos, who in the great number and excellence of his hymns dominated\r\nthis species of poetry, as Homer did the Greek epic. From this period\r\ndates, moreover, the most famous song of the Greek Church, the so-called\r\n_Acathistus_, an anonymous hymn of praise to the Virgin Mary, which has\r\nsometimes, but erroneously, been attributed to the patriarch Sergius.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Canones.\r\n\r\nChurch poetry entered upon a new stage, characterized by an increase in\r\nartistic finish and a falling off in poetical vigour, with the\r\ncomposition of the _Canones_, songs artfully built up out of eight or\r\nnine lyrics, all differently constructed. Andreas, archbishop of Crete\r\n(c. 650-720), is regarded as the inventor of this new class of song. His\r\nchief work, \"the great Canon,\" comprises no less than 250 strophes. The\r\nmost celebrated writers of _Canones_ are John of Damascus and Cosmas of\r\nJerusalem, both of whom flourished in the first half of the 8th century.\r\nThe \"vulgar\" simplicity of Romanos was regarded by them as an obsolete\r\nmethod; they again resorted to the classical style of Gregory of\r\nNazianzus, and John of Damascus even took a special delight in the most\r\nelaborate tricks of expression. In spite of this, or perhaps on that\r\nvery account, both he and Cosmas were much admired in later times, were\r\nmuch read, and--as was very necessary--much commentated. Later, sacred\r\npoetry was more particularly cultivated in the monastery of the Studium\r\nat Constantinople by the abbot Theodorus and others. Again, in the 9th\r\ncentury, Joseph, \"the hymn-writer,\" excelled as a writer of songs, and,\r\nfinally, John Mauropus (11th century), bishop of Euchaita, John Zonaras\r\n(12th century), and Nicephorus Blemmydes (13th century), were also\r\ndistinguished as authors of sacred poems, i.e. _Canones_. The Basilian\r\nAbbey of Grotta Ferrata near Rome, founded in 1004, and still existing,\r\nwas also a nursery of religious poetry. As regards the rhythmic church\r\npoetry, it may now be regarded as certain that its origin was in the\r\nEast. Old Hebrew and Syrian models mainly stimulated it, and Romanos\r\n(q.v.) was especially influenced by the metrical homilies of the great\r\nSyrian father Ephraem (d. about 373).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Profane literature; historical accounts.\r\n\r\nIn profane literature the writing of history takes the first place, as\r\nregards both form and substance. The Greeks have always been deeply\r\ninterested in history, and they have never omitted, amid all the\r\nvicissitudes of their existence, to hand down a record to posterity.\r\nThus, they have produced a literature extending from the Ionian\r\nlogographers and Herodotus down to the times of Sultan Mahommed II. In\r\nthe Byzantine period all historical accounts fall under one of two\r\ngroups, entirely different, both in form and in matter, (1) historical\r\nworks, the authors of which described, as did most historians of ancient\r\ntimes, a period of history in which they themselves had lived and moved,\r\nor one which only immediately preceded their own times; and (2)\r\nchronicles, shortly recapitulating the history of the world. This latter\r\nclass has no exact counterpart in ancient literature. The most clearly\r\nmarked stage in the development of a Christian-Byzantine universal\r\nhistory was the chronicle (unfortunately lost) written by the Hellenized\r\nJew, Justus of Tiberias, at the beginning of the 2nd century of the\r\nChristian era; this work began with the story of Moses.\r\n\r\nByzantine histories of contemporary events do not differ substantially\r\nfrom ancient historical works, except in their Christian colouring. Yet\r\neven this is often very faint and blurred owing to close adherence to\r\nancient methods. Apart from this, neither a new style nor a new critical\r\nmethod nor any radically new views appreciably altered the main\r\ncharacter of Byzantine historiography. In their style most Byzantine\r\ncompilers of contemporary history followed the beaten track of older\r\nhistorians, e.g. Herodotus, Thucydides, and, in some details, also\r\nPolybius. But, in spite of their often excessive tendency to imitation,\r\nthey displayed considerable power in the delineation of character and\r\nwere not wanting in independent judgment. As regards the selection of\r\ntheir matter, they adhered to the old custom of beginning their\r\nnarrative where their predecessors left off.\r\n\r\nThe outstripping of the Latin West by the Greek East, which after the\r\nclose of the 4th century was a self-evident fact, is reflected in\r\nhistoriography also. After Constantine the Great, the history of the\r\nempire, although its Latin character was maintained until the 6th\r\ncentury, was mostly written by Greeks; e.g. Eunapius (c. 400),\r\nOlympiodorus (c. 450), Priscus (c. 450), Malchus (c. 490), and Zosimus,\r\nthe last pagan historian (c. 500), all of whom, with the exception of\r\nZosimus, are unfortunately preserved to us only in fragments.\r\nHistoriography received a great impulse in the 6th century. The powerful\r\nProcopius and Agathias (q.v.), tinged with poetical rhetoric, described\r\nthe stirring and eventful times of Justinian, while Theophanes of\r\nByzantium, Menander Protector, Johannes of Epiphaneia and Theophylactus\r\nof Simocatta described the second half of the 6th century. Towards the\r\nclose of the 6th century also flourished the last independent\r\necclesiastical historian, Evagrius, who wrote the history of the church\r\nfrom 431 to 593. There now followed, however, a lamentable falling off\r\nin production. From the 7th to the 10th century the historical side is\r\nrepresented by a few chronicles, and it was not until the 10th century\r\nthat, owing to the revival of ancient classical studies, the art of\r\nwriting history showed some signs of life. Several historical works are\r\nassociated with the name of the emperor Constantine VII.\r\nPorphyrogenitus. To his learned circle belonged also Joseph Genesius,\r\nwho at the emperor's instance compiled the history of the period from\r\n813 to 886. A little work, interesting from the point of view of\r\nhistorical and ethnographical science, is the account of the taking of\r\nThessalonica by the Cretan Corsairs (A.D. 904), which a priest, Johannes\r\nCameniata, an eyewitness of the event, has bequeathed to posterity.\r\nThere is also contained in the excellent work of Leo Diaconus (on the\r\nperiod from 959 to 975) a graphic account of the bloody wars of the\r\nByzantines with the Arabs in Crete and with the Bulgarians. A\r\ncontinuation was undertaken by the philosopher Michael Psellus in a work\r\ncovering the period from 976 to 1077. A valuable supplement to the\r\nlatter (describing the period from 1034 to 1079) was supplied by the\r\njurist Michael Attaliata. The history of the Eastern empire during the\r\nCrusades was written in four considerable works, by Nicephorus\r\nBryennius, his learned consort Anna Comnena, the \"honest Aetolian,\"\r\nJohannes Cinnamus, and finally by Nicetas Acominatus in an exhaustive\r\nwork which is authoritative for the history of the 4th Crusade. The\r\nmelancholy conditions and the ever increasing decay of the empire under\r\nthe Palaeologi (13th-15th centuries) are described in the same lofty\r\nstyle, though with a still closer following of classical models. The\r\nevents which took place between the taking of Constantinople by the\r\nLatins and the restoration of Byzantine rule (1203-1261) are recounted\r\nby Georgius Acropolita, who emphasizes his own share in them. The\r\nsucceeding period was written by the versatile Georgius Pachymeres, the\r\nerudite and high-principled Nicephorus Gregoras, and the emperor John\r\nVI. Cantacuzenus. Lastly, the death-struggle between the East Roman\r\nempire and the mighty rising power of the Ottomans was narrated by three\r\nhistorians, all differing in culture and in style, Laonicus\r\nChalcocondyles, Ducas and Georgius Phrantzes. With them may be classed a\r\nfourth (though he lived outside the Byzantine period), Critobulus, a\r\nhigh-born Greek of Imbros, who wrote, in the style of the age of\r\nPericles, the history of the times of the sultan Mahommed II. (down to\r\n1467).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chronicles.\r\n\r\nThe essential importance of the Byzantine chronicles (mostly chronicles\r\nof the history of the world from the Creation) consists in the fact that\r\nthey in part replace older lost works, and thus fill up many gaps in our\r\nhistorical survey (e.g. for the period from about 600 to 800 of which\r\nvery few records remain). They lay no claim to literary merit, but are\r\noften serviceable for the history of language. Many such chronicles were\r\nfurnished with illustrations. The remains of one such illustrated\r\nchronicle on papyrus, dating from the beginning of the 5th century, has\r\nbeen preserved for us by the soil of Egypt.[7] The authors of the\r\nchronicles were mostly monks, who wished to compile handbooks of\r\nuniversal history for their brethren and for pious laymen; and this\r\nexplains the strong clerical and popular tendency of these works. And it\r\nis due to these two qualities that the chronicles obtained a\r\ncirculation abroad, both in the West and also among the peoples\r\nChristianized from Byzantium, e.g. the Slavs, and in all of them sowed\r\nthe seeds of an indigenous historical literature. Thus the chronicles,\r\ndespite the jejuneness of their style and their uncritical treatment of\r\nmaterial were for the general culture of the middle ages of far greater\r\nimportance than the erudite contemporary histories designed only for the\r\nhighly educated circles in Byzantium. The oldest Byzantine chronicle of\r\nuniversal history preserved to us is that of Malalas (6th century),\r\nwhich is also the purest type of this class of literature. In the 7th\r\ncentury was completed the famous _Easter_ or _Paschal Chronicle_\r\n(_Chronicon Paschale_). About the end of the 8th or the beginning of the\r\n9th century Georgius Syncellus compiled a concise chronicle, which began\r\nwith the Creation and was continued down to the year 284. At the request\r\nof the author, when on his death-bed, the continuation of this work was\r\nundertaken by Theophanes Confessor, who brought down the account from\r\nA.D. 284 to his own times (A.D. 813). This exceedingly valuable work of\r\nTheophanes was again continued (from 813-961) by several anonymous\r\nchroniclers. A contemporary of Theophanes, the patriarch Nicephorus,\r\nwrote, in addition to a _Short History_ of the period from 602 to 769, a\r\nchronological sketch from Adam down to the year of his own death in 829.\r\nOf great influence on the age that followed was Georgius Monachus, only\r\nsecond in importance as chronicler of the early Byzantine period, who\r\ncompiled a chronicle of the world's history (from Adam until the year\r\n843, the end of the Iconoclast movement), far more theological and\r\nmonkish in character than the work of Theophanes. Among later\r\nchroniclers Johannes Scylitza stands out conspicuously. His work\r\n(covering the period from 811 to 1057), as regards the range of its\r\nsubject-matter, is something between a universal and a contemporary\r\nhistory. Georgius Cedrenus (c. 1100) embodied the whole of Scylitza's\r\nwork, almost unaltered, in his _Universal Chronicle_. In the 12th\r\ncentury the general increase in literary production was evident also in\r\nthe department of chronicles of the world. From this period dates, for\r\ninstance, the most distinguished and learned work of this class, the\r\ngreat universal chronicle of John Zonaras. In the same century Michael\r\nGlycas compiled his chronicle of the world's history, a work written in\r\nthe old popular style and designed for the widest circles of readers.\r\nLastly, in the 12th century, Constantine Manasses wrote a universal\r\nchronicle in the so-called \"political\" verse. With this verse-chronicle\r\nmust be classed the imperial chronicle of Ephraem, written in Byzantine\r\ntrimeters at the beginning of the 14th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Geography.\r\n\r\nGeography and topography, subjects so closely connected with history,\r\nwere as much neglected by the Byzantines as by their political\r\nforerunners, the Romans. Of purely practical importance are a few\r\nhandbooks of navigation, itineraries, guides for pilgrims, and\r\ncatalogues of provinces and cities, metropolitan sees and bishoprics.\r\nThe geographical work of Stephanus of Byzantium, which dates from\r\nJustinian's time, has been lost. To the same period belongs the only\r\nlarge geographical work which has been preserved to us, the _Christian\r\nTopography_ of Cosmas Indicopleustes. For the topography of\r\nConstantinople a work entitled _Ancient History (Patria) of\r\nConstantinople_, which may be compared to the medieval _Mirabilia urbis\r\nRomae_, and in late manuscripts has been wrongly attributed to a certain\r\nCodinus, is of great importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Philosophy.\r\n\r\nAncient Greek philosophy under the empire sent forth two new\r\nshoots--Neopythagoreanism and Neoplatonism. It was the latter with which\r\nmoribund paganism essayed to stem the advancing tide of Christianity.\r\nThe last great exponent of this philosophy was Proclus in Athens (d.\r\n485). The dissolution, by order of Justinian, of the school of\r\nphilosophy at Athens in 529 was a fatal blow to this nebulous system,\r\nwhich had long since outlived the conditions that made it a living\r\nforce. In the succeeding period philosophical activity was of two main\r\nkinds; on the one hand, the old philosophy, e.g. that of Aristotle, was\r\nemployed to systematize Christian doctrine, while, on the other, the\r\nold works were furnished with copious commentaries and paraphrases.\r\nLeontius of Byzantium had already introduced Aristotelian definitions\r\ninto Christology; but the real founder of medieval ecclesiastical\r\nphilosophy was John of Damascus. Owing, however, to his having early\r\nattained to canonical authority, the independent progress of\r\necclesiastical philosophy was arrested; and to this it is due that in\r\nthis respect the later Byzantine period is far poorer than is the West.\r\nByzantium cannot boast a scholastic like Thomas Aquinas. In the 11th\r\ncentury philosophical studies experienced a satisfactory revival, mainly\r\nowing to Michael Psellus, who brought Plato as well as Aristotle again\r\ninto fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Rhetoric.\r\n\r\nAncient rhetoric was cultivated in the Byzantine period with greater\r\nardour than scientific philosophy, being regarded as an indispensable\r\naid to instruction. It would be difficult to imagine anything more\r\ntedious than the numerous theoretical writings on the subject and the\r\nexamples of their practical application: mechanical school essays, which\r\nhere count as \"literature,\" and innumerable letters, the contents of\r\nwhich are wholly insignificant. The evil effects of this were felt\r\nbeyond the proper sphere of rhetoric. The anxious attention paid to the\r\nlaws of rhetoric and the unrestricted use of its withered flowers were\r\ndetrimental to a great part of the rest of Byzantine literature, and\r\ngreatly hampered the development of any individuality and simplicity of\r\nstyle. None the less, among the rhetorical productions of the time are\r\nto be found a few interesting pieces, such as the _Philopatris_, in the\r\nstyle of Lucian, which gives us a remarkable picture of the times of\r\nNicephorus Phocas (10th century). In two other smaller works a journey\r\nto the dwellings of the dead is described, after the pattern of Lucian's\r\n_Nekyomanteia_, viz. in _Timarion_ (12th century) and in Mazaris'\r\n_Journey to the Underworld_ (c. 1414). A very charming representative of\r\nByzantine rhetoric is Michael Acominatus, who, in addition to\r\ntheological works, wrote numerous occasional speeches, letters and\r\npoems.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The sciences.\r\n\r\nIn the field of scientific production, which can be accounted literature\r\nin the modern acceptation of the term only in a limited sense, Byzantium\r\nwas dominated to an extravagant and even grotesque extent by the rules\r\nof what in modern times is termed \"classical scholarship.\" The numerous\r\nworks which belong to this category, such as grammars, dictionaries,\r\ncommentaries on ancient authors, extracts from ancient literature, and\r\nmetrical and musical treatises, are of little general interest, although\r\nof great value for special branches of philological study, e.g. for\r\ntracing the influences through which the ancient works handed down to us\r\nhave passed, as well as for their interpretation and emendation; for\r\ninformation about ancient authors now lost; for the history of\r\neducation; and for the underlying principles of intellectual life in\r\nByzantium. The most important monument of Byzantine philology is,\r\nperhaps, the _Library_ of the patriarch Photius. The period from about\r\n650 to 850 is marked by a general decay of culture. Photius, who in the\r\nyear 850 was about thirty years of age, now set himself with admirable\r\nenergy to the task of making ancient literature, now for the most part\r\ndead and forgotten, known once more to his contemporaries, thus\r\ncontributing to its preservation. He gave an account of all that he\r\nread, and in this way composed 280 essays, which were collected in what\r\nis commonly known as the _Library_ or _Myriobiblon_. The character of\r\nthe individual sketches is somewhat mechanical and formal; a more or\r\nless complete account of the contents is followed by critical\r\ndiscussion, which is nearly always confined to the linguistic form. With\r\nthis work may be compared in importance the great _Lexikon_ of Suidas,\r\nwhich appeared about a century later, a sort of encyclopaedia, of which\r\nthe main feature was its articles on the history of literature. A truly\r\nsympathetic figure is Eustathius, the famous archbishop of Thessalonica\r\n(12th century). His voluminous commentaries on Homer, however, rivet the\r\nattention less than his enthusiastic devotion to science, his energetic\r\naction on behalf of the preservation of the literary works of antiquity,\r\nand last, not least, his frank and heroic character, which had nothing\r\nin it of the Byzantine. If, on the other hand, acquaintance with a\r\ncaricature of Byzantine philology be desired, it is afforded by Johannes\r\nTzetzes, a contemporary of Eustathius, a Greek in neither name nor\r\nspirit, narrow-minded, angular, superficial, and withal immeasurably\r\nconceited and ridiculously coarse in his polemics. The transition to\r\nWestern humanism was effected by the philologists of the period of the\r\nPalaeologi, such as Maximus Planudes, whose translations of numerous\r\nworks renewed the long-broken ties between Byzantium and the West;\r\nManuel Moschopulus, whose grammatical works and commentaries were, down\r\nto the 16th century, used as school text-books; Demetrius Triclinius,\r\ndistinguished as a textual critic; the versatile Theodorus Metochites,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nOriginally, as is well known, Latin was the exclusive language of Roman\r\nlaw. But with Justinian, who codified the laws in his _Corpus juris_,\r\nthe Hellenizing of the legal language also began. The _Institutes_ and\r\nthe _Digest_ were translated into Greek, and the _Novels_ also were\r\nissued in a Greek form. Under the Macedonian dynasty there began, after\r\na long stagnation, the resuscitation of the code of Justinian. The\r\nemperor Basilius I. (867-886) had extracts made from the existing law,\r\nand made preparations for the codifying of all laws. But the whole work\r\nwas not completed till the time of Leo VI. the Wise (886-912), and\r\nConstantine VII. Porphyrogenitus (912-959), when it took the form of a\r\ngrand compilation from the _Digests_, the _Codex_, and the _Novels_, and\r\nis commonly known as the _Basilica_ ([Greek: Ta basilika]). In the East\r\nit completely superseded the old Latin _Corpus juris_ of Justinian. More\r\nthat was new was produced, during the Byzantine period, in canon law\r\nthan in secular legislation. The purely ecclesiastical rules of law, the\r\n_Canones_, were blended with those of civil law, and thus arose the\r\nso-called _Nomocanon_, the most important edition of which is that of\r\nTheodorus Bestes in 1090. The alphabetical handbook of canon law written\r\nby Matthaeus Blastares about the year 1335 also exercised a great\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mathematics and astronomy.\r\n\r\nIn the province of mathematics and astronomy the remarkable fact must be\r\nrecorded that the revival among the Greeks of these long-forgotten\r\nstudies was primarily due to Perso-Arabian influence. The _Great\r\nSyntaxis_ of Ptolemy operated in the oriental guise of the _Almagest_.\r\nThe most important direct source of this intellectual loan was not\r\nArabia, however, but Persia. Towards the close of the 13th century the\r\nGreeks became acquainted with Persian astronomy. At the beginning of the\r\n14th century Georgius Chrysococca and Isaac Argyrus wrote astronomical\r\ntreatises based on Persian works. Then the Byzantines themselves,\r\nnotably Theodorus Metochites and Nicephorus Gregoras, at last had\r\nrecourse to the original Greek sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Military science.\r\n\r\nThe Byzantines did much independent work in the field of military\r\nscience. The most valuable work of the period on this subject is one on\r\ntactics, which has come down to posterity associated with the name of\r\nLeo VI., the Wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Profane poetry.\r\n\r\nOf profane poetry--in complete contrast to sacred poetry--the general\r\ncharacteristic was its close imitation of the antique in point of form.\r\nAll works belonging to this category reproduce the ancient style and are\r\nframed after ancient models. The metre is, for the most part, either the\r\nByzantine regular twelve-syllable trimeter, or the \"political\" verse;\r\nmore rarely the heroic and Anacreontic measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Epic.\r\n\r\nEpic popular poetry, in the ancient sense, begins only with the\r\nvernacular Greek literature (see below); but among the literary works of\r\nthe period there are several which can be compared with the epics of the\r\nAlexandrine age. Nonnus (c. 400) wrote, while yet a pagan, a fantastic\r\nepic on the triumphal progress of the god Dionysus to India, and, as a\r\nChristian, a voluminous commentary on the gospel of St John. In the 7th\r\ncentury, Georgius Pisides sang in several lengthy iambic poems the\r\nmartial deeds of the emperor Heraclius, while the deacon Theodosius\r\n(10th century) immortalized in extravagant language the victories of the\r\nbrave Nicephorus Phocas.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Didactic poems.\r\n\r\nFrom the 11th century onwards, religious, grammatical, astrological,\r\nmedical, historical and allegorical poems, framed partly in\r\nduodecasyllables and partly in \"political\" verse, made their appearance\r\nin large quantities. Didactic religious poems were composed, for\r\nexample, by Philippus ([Greek: ho Monotropos], Solitarius, c. 1100),\r\ngrammatico-philological poems by Johannes Tzetzes, astrological by\r\nJohannes Camaterus (12th century), others on natural science by Manuel\r\nPhiles (14th century) and a great moral, allegorical, didactic epic by\r\nGeorgius Lapithes (14th century).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Romances.\r\n\r\nTo these may be added some voluminous poems, which in style and matter\r\nmust be regarded as imitations of the ancient Greek romances. They all\r\ndate from the 12th century, a fact evidently connected with the general\r\nrevival of culture which characterizes the period of the Comneni. Two of\r\nthese romances are written in the duodecasyllable metre, viz. the story\r\nof Rodanthe and Dosicles by Theodorus Prodromus, and an imitation of\r\nthis work, the story of Drusilla and Charicles by Nicetas Eugenianus;\r\none in \"political\" verse, the love story of Aristander and Callithea by\r\nConstantine Manasses, which has only been preserved in fragments, and\r\nlastly one in prose, the story of Hysmine and Hysminias, by Eustathius\r\n(or Eumathius) Macrembolita, which is the most insipid of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lyrics.\r\n\r\n  The epigram.\r\n\r\nThe objective point of view which dominated the whole Byzantine period\r\nwas fatal to the development of a profane lyrical poetry. At most a few\r\npoems by Johannes Geometres and Christophorus of Mytilene and others, in\r\nwhich personal experiences are recorded with some show of taste, may be\r\nplaced in this category. The dominant form for all subjective poetry was\r\nthe epigram, which was employed in all its variations from playful\r\ntrifles to long elegiac and narrative poems. Georgius Pisides (7th\r\ncentury) treated the most diverse themes. In the 9th century Theodorus\r\nof Studium had lighted upon the happy idea of immortalizing monastic\r\nlife in a series of epigrams. The same century produced the only poetess\r\nof the Byzantine period, Casia, from whom we have several epigrammatic\r\nproductions and church hymns, all characterized by originality.\r\nEpigrammatic poetry reached its highest development in the 10th and 11th\r\ncenturies, in the productions of Johannes Geometres, Christophorus of\r\nMytilene and John Mauropus. Less happy are Theodorus Prodromus (12th\r\ncentury) and Manuel Philes (14th century). From the beginning of the\r\n10th century also dates the most valuable collection of ancient and of\r\nByzantine epigrammatic poems, the _Anthologia Palatina_ (see ANTHOLOGY).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Drama.\r\n\r\nDramatic poetry, in the strict sense of the term, was as completely\r\nlacking among the Byzantine Greeks as was the condition precedent to its\r\nexistence, namely, public performance. Apart from some moralizing\r\nallegorical dialogues (by Theodorus Prodromus, Manuel Philes and\r\nothers), we possess only a single work of the Byzantine period that, at\r\nleast in external form, resembles a drama: the _Sufferings of Christ_\r\n([Greek: Christos Paschon]). This work, written probably in the 12th\r\ncentury, or at all events not earlier, is a cento, i.e. is in great\r\nmeasure composed of verses culled from ancient writers, e.g. Aeschylus,\r\nEuripides and Lycophron; but it was certainly not written with a view to\r\nthe dramatic production.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Vernacular Greek literature.\r\n\r\nThe vernacular literature stands alone, both in form and in contents. We\r\nhave here remarkable originality of conception and probably also\r\nentirely new and genuinely medieval matter. While in the artificial\r\nliterature prose is pre-eminent, in the vernacular literature, poetry,\r\nboth in quantity and quality, takes the first place, as was also the\r\ncase among the Latin nations, where the vulgar tongue first invaded the\r\nfield of poetry and only later that of prose. Though a few preliminary\r\nattempts were made (proverbs, acclamations addressed by the people to\r\nthe emperor, &c.), the Greek vernacular was employed for larger works\r\nonly from the 12th century onwards; at first in poems, of which the\r\nmajor portion were cast in \"political\" verse, but some in the trochaic\r\neight-syllabled line. Towards the close of the 15th century rhyme came\r\ninto use. The subjects treated in this vernacular poetry are\r\nexceedingly diverse. In the capital city a mixture of the learned and\r\nthe popular language was first used in poems of admonition, praise and\r\nsupplication. In this oldest class of \"vulgar\" works must be reckoned\r\nthe _Spaneas_, an admonitory poem in imitation of the letter of\r\nPseudo-Isocrates addressed to Demonicus; a supplicatory poem composed in\r\nprison by the chronicler Michael Glycas, and several begging poems of\r\nTheodorus Prodromus (Ptochoprodromos). In the succeeding period erotic\r\npoems are met with, such as the Rhodian love songs preserved in a MS. in\r\nthe British Museum (ed. W. Wagner, Leipzig, 1879), fairy-tale like\r\nromances such as the _Story of Ptocholeon_, oracles, prayers, extracts\r\nfrom Holy Writ, lives of saints, &c. Great epic poems, in which antique\r\nsubjects are treated, such as the legends of Troy and of Alexander, form\r\na separate group. To these may be added romances in verse after the\r\nmanner of the works written in the artificial classical language, e.g.\r\n_Callimachus and Chrysorrhoe_, _Belthandrus and Chrysantza_, _Lybistrus\r\nand Rhodamne_, also romances in verse after the Western pattern, such as\r\n_Phlorius_ and _Platziaphlora_ (the old French story of _Flore et\r\nBlanchefleur_). Curious are also sundry legends connected with animals\r\nand plants, such as an adaptation of the famous medieval animal fables\r\nof the _Physiologus_, a history of quadrupeds, and a book of birds, both\r\nwritten with a satirical intention, and, lastly, a rendering of the\r\nstory of Reynard the Fox. Of quite peculiar originality also are several\r\nlegendary and historical poems, in which famous heroes and historical\r\nevents are celebrated. There are, for instance, poems on the fall of\r\nConstantinople, the taking of Athens and Trebizond, the devastating\r\ncampaign of Timur, the plague in Rhodes in 1498, &c. In respect of\r\nimportance and antiquity the great heroic epic of Digenis Akritas stands\r\npre-eminent.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Vulgar\" prose works.\r\n\r\nAmong prose works written in the vulgar tongue, or at least in a\r\ncompromise with it, may be mentioned the Greek rendering of two works\r\nfrom an Indian source, the _Book of the Seven Wise Masters_ (as\r\n_Syntipas the Philosopher_ by Michael Andreopulus), and the _Hitopadera_\r\nor _Mirror of Princes_ (through the Arabic _Kalilah and Dimnah_ by\r\nSimeon Sethus as [Greek: Stephanites kai Iknelates]), a fish book, a\r\nfruit book (both skits on the Byzantine court and official circles). To\r\nthese must be added the Greek laws of Jerusalem and of Cyprus of the\r\n12th and 13th centuries, chronicles, &c. In spite of many individual\r\nsuccesses, the literature written in the vulgar tongue succumbed, in the\r\nrace for existence, to its elder sister, the literature written in\r\nclassical and polished Greek. This was mainly due to the continuous\r\nemployment of the ancient language in the state, the schools and the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n\r\n  General significance of Byzantine literature.\r\n\r\nThe importance of Byzantine culture and literature in the history of the\r\nworld is beyond dispute. The Christians of the East Roman empire guarded\r\nfor more than a thousand years the intellectual heritage of antiquity\r\nagainst the violent onslaught of the barbarians. They also called into\r\nlife a peculiar medieval culture and literature. They communicated the\r\ntreasures of the old pagan as well as of their own Christian literature\r\nto neighbouring nations; first to the Syrians, then to the Copts, the\r\nArmenians, the Georgians; later, to the Arabians, the Bulgarians, the\r\nSerbs and the Russians. Through their teaching they created a new East\r\nEuropean culture, embodied above all in the Russian empire, which, on\r\nits religious side, is included in the Orthodox Eastern Church, and from\r\nthe point of view of nationality touches the two extremes of Greek and\r\nSlav. Finally the learned men of the dying Byzantine empire, fleeing\r\nfrom the barbarism of the Turks, transplanted the treasures of old\r\nHellenic wisdom to the West, and thereby fertilized the Western peoples\r\nwith rich germs of culture.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--1.

MODERN GREEK LITERATURE (1453-1908)\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Constantinople, the destruction of Greek national\r\nlife and the almost total effacement of Greek civilization naturally\r\ninvolved a more or less complete cessation of Greek literary production\r\nin the regions subjected to the rule of a barbarous conqueror. Learned\r\nGreeks found a refuge away from their native land; they spoke the\r\nlanguages of foreign people, and when they wrote books they often used\r\nthose languages, but in most cases they also wrote in Greek. The fall of\r\nConstantinople must not therefore be taken as indicating a break in the\r\ncontinuity of Greek literary history. Nor had that event so decisive an\r\ninfluence as has been supposed on the revival of learning in western\r\nEurope. The crusades had already brought the Greeks and Westerns\r\ntogether, and the rule of the Franks at Constantinople and in the Levant\r\nhad rendered the contact closer. Greeks and Latins had keenly discussed\r\nthe dogmas which divided the Eastern and Western Churches; some Greeks\r\nhad adopted the Latin faith or had endeavoured to reconcile the two\r\ncommunions, some had attained preferment in the Roman Church. Many had\r\nbecome connected by marriage or other ties with the Italian nobles who\r\nruled in the Aegean or the Heptanesos, and circumstances led them to\r\nsettle in Italy. Of the writers who thus found their way to the West\r\nbefore the taking of Constantinople the most prominent were Leon or\r\nLeontios Pilatos, Georgius Gemistus, or Pletho, Manuel and John\r\nChrysoloras, Theodore Gazes, George of Trebizond and Cardinal Bessarion.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Klephtic poetry.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman conquest had reduced the Christian races in the plains to a\r\ncondition of serfdom, but the spirit of liberty continued to breathe in\r\nthe mountains, where groups of desperate men, the Klephts and the\r\nHaiduks, maintained the struggle against alien tyranny. The adventurous\r\nand romantic life of these champions of freedom, spent amid the noblest\r\nsolitudes of nature and often tinged with the deepest tragedy, naturally\r\nproduced a poetry of its own, fresh, spontaneous and entirely\r\nindigenous. The Klephtic ballads, all anonymous and composed in the\r\nlanguage of the people, are unquestionably the best and most genuine\r\nGreek poetry of this epoch. They breathe the aroma of the forests and\r\nmountains; like the early rhapsodies of antiquity, which peopled nature\r\nwith a thousand forms, they lend a voice to the trees, the rocks, the\r\nrivers and to the mountains themselves, which sing the prowess of the\r\nKlepht, bewail his death and comfort his disconsolate wife or mother.\r\nOlympia boasts to Ossa that the footstep of the Turk has never\r\ndesecrated its valleys; the standard of freedom floats over its springs;\r\nthere is a Klepht beneath every tree of its forests; an eagle sits on\r\nits summit with the head of a warrior in its talons. The dying Klepht\r\nbids his companions make him a large and lofty tomb that he may stand\r\ntherein and load his musket: \"Make a window in the side that the\r\nswallows may tell me that spring has come, that the nightingales may\r\nsing me the approach of flowery May.\" The wounded Vervos is addressed by\r\nhis horse: \"Rise, my master, let us go and find our comrades.\" \"My bay\r\nhorse, I cannot rise; I am dying: dig me a tomb with thy silver-shod\r\nhoof; take me in thy teeth and lay me therein. Bear my arms to my\r\ncompanions and this handkerchief to my beloved, that she may see it and\r\nlament me.\" Another type of the popular poetry is presented by the\r\nfolk-songs of the Aegean islanders and the maritime population of the\r\nAsiatic coast. In many of the former the influence of the Frankish\r\nconquest is apparent. Traces of the ancient mythology are often to be\r\nfound in the popular songs. Death is commonly personified by Charon, who\r\nstruggles with his victim; Charon is sometimes worsted, but as a rule he\r\ntriumphs in the conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cretan poets.\r\n\r\nIn Crete, which for nearly two centuries after the fall of\r\nConstantinople remained under Venetian rule, a school of Greek poetry\r\narose strongly impressed with Italian influences. The language employed\r\nis the dialect of the Candiotes, with its large admixture of Venetian\r\nwords. The first product of this somewhat hybrid literature was\r\n_Erotocritos_, an epic poem in five cantos, which relates the love story\r\nof Arete, daughter of Hercules, king of Athens, and Erotocritos, the son\r\nof his minister. The poem presents an interesting picture of Greece\r\nunder the feudal Frankish princes, though professing to describe an\r\nepisode of the classical epoch; notwithstanding some tedious passages,\r\nit possesses considerable merit and contains some charming scenes. The\r\nmetre is the rhymed alexandrine. Of the author, Vicence Cornaro, who\r\nlived in the middle or end of the 16th century, little is known; he\r\nprobably belonged to the ducal family of that name, from which Tasso was\r\ndescended. The second poem is the _Erophile_ of George Chortakis, a\r\nCretan, also written in the Candiote dialect. It is a tragic drama, the\r\nscene of which is laid in Egypt. The dialogue is poor, but there are\r\nsome fine choral interludes, which perhaps are by a different hand.\r\nChortakis, who was brought up at Retimo, lived at the end of the 16th\r\nand beginning of the 17th centuries. The third Cretan poem worthy of\r\nnotice is the _Shepherdess_, a charming and graceful idyll written by\r\nNicolas Drimyticos, a native of Apokorona, early in the 17th century.\r\nOther Cretan poets were J. Gregoropoulos and G. Melissinos (1500), who\r\nwrote epigrams, and Maroulos (1493), who endeavoured to write Pindaric\r\nodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Literary activity after the fall of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks who were prominent in spreading a knowledge of Greek in\r\nEurope after the fall of Constantinople were John Argyropulos, Demetrius\r\nChalcondyles, Constantine and John Lascaris and Marcus Musurus, a\r\nCretan. These men wrote in the accepted literary language; in general,\r\nhowever, they were rather employed about literature than engaged in\r\nproducing it. They taught Greek; several of them wrote Greek grammars;\r\nthey transcribed and edited Greek classical writers, and they collected\r\nmanuscripts. Their stores enriched the newly founded libraries of St\r\nMark at Venice, of the Escorial, of the Vatican and of the National\r\nLibrary in Paris. But none of them accomplished much in literature\r\nstrictly so called. The question which most deeply interested them was\r\nthat of the rival merits of the Platonic and Aristotelian philosophies,\r\nover which a controversy of extraordinary bitterness broke out towards\r\nthe close of the 15th century. The dispute was in reality theological\r\nrather than philosophical; the cause of Plato was championed by the\r\nadvocates of a union between the Eastern and Western Churches, that of\r\nAristotle was upheld by the opposing party, and all the fury of the old\r\nByzantine dogmatic controversies was revived. The patriarch, George\r\nKurtesios or Gennadius, whom Mahommed II. had appointed after the\r\ncapture of Constantinople, wrote a treatise in favour of Aristotle and\r\nexcommunicated Gemistus Pletho, the principal writer among the\r\nPlatonists. On the other hand, George of Trebizond, who attacked Pletho\r\nwith unmeasured virulence, was compelled to resign his post of secretary\r\nto Pope Nicholas V. and was imprisoned by Pope Paul I. Scholarship was\r\nnot wholly extinct in Greece or among the Greeks for a considerable time\r\nafter the Turkish conquest. Arsenius, who succeeded Musurus as bishop of\r\nMonemvasia (1510), wrote commentaries on Aristophanes and Euripides; his\r\nfather, Apostoles, made a collection of Greek proverbs. Aemilius Portos,\r\na Cretan, and Leo Allatios (1600-1650) of Chios edited a number of works\r\nof the classical and later periods with commentaries and translations;\r\nAllatios also wrote Greek verses showing skill and cleverness.\r\nConstantine Rhodokanakes, physician to Charles II. of England, wrote\r\nverses on the return of that monarch to England. About the time of the\r\nfall of Constantinople we meet with some versifiers who wrote poems in\r\nthe spoken dialect on historical subjects; among these were\r\nPapaspondylos Zotikos (1444), Georgilas Limenitis (1450-1500) and\r\nJacobos Trivoles (beginning of the 16th century); their poems have\r\nlittle merit, but are interesting as specimens of the popular language\r\nof the day and as illustrating the manners and ideas of contemporary\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Historical works.\r\n\r\nAmong the prose writers of the 16th century were a number of\r\nchroniclers. At the end of the 15th, Kritobulos of Imbros, who had been\r\nprivate secretary of Mahommed II., wrote the history of his master,\r\nEmmanuel Melaxos a history of the patriarchate, and Phranzes a history\r\nof the Palaeologi. Theodosius Zygomalas (1580) wrote a history of\r\nConstantinople from 1391 to 1578. In the 17th century Demetrius\r\nCantemir, a Moldavian by birth, wrote a history of the Ottoman empire,\r\nand G. Kontares tales of ancient Athens. Others composed chronicles of\r\nCyprus and Crete, narratives of travels and biographies of saints. Most\r\nof these works are written in the literary language, the study of which\r\nwas kept alive by the patriarchate and the schools which it maintained\r\nat Constantinople and elsewhere. Various theological and philosophical\r\nworks, grammars and dictionaries were written during this period, but\r\nelegant literature practically disappears.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The literary revival.\r\n\r\nA literary revival followed in the 18th century, the precursor of the\r\nnational uprising which resulted in the independence of Greece. The\r\nefforts of the great Phanariote families at Constantinople, the\r\neducational zeal of the higher Greek clergy and the munificence of\r\nwealthy Greeks in the provinces, chiefly merchants who had acquired\r\nfortunes by commerce, combined to promote the spread of education among\r\na people always eager for instruction. The Turks, indifferent to\r\neducational matters, failed to discern the significance of the movement.\r\nSchools were established in every important Greek town, and school-books\r\nand translations from Western languages issued from the presses of\r\nVenice, Triest, Vienna and other cities where the Greeks possessed\r\ncolonies. Young men completed their studies in the Western universities\r\nand returned to the East as the missionaries of modern civilization. For\r\nthe greater part of the 18th century the literature was mainly\r\ntheological. Notable theological writers of this epoch were Elias\r\nMiniates, an elegant preacher, whose sermons are written in the popular\r\nlanguage, and Meletios of Iannina, metropolitan of Athens, whose\r\nprincipal works were an ecclesiastical history, written in ancient\r\nGreek, and a descriptive geography of Greece in the modern language,\r\ncomposed, like the work of Pausanias, after a series of tours. The works\r\nof two distinguished prelates, both natives of Corfu and both ardent\r\npartisans of Russia, Nikephoros Theotokes (1731?-1800) and Eugenios\r\nBulgares (1715-1806), mark the beginning of the national and literary\r\nrenaissance. They wrote much in defence of Greek orthodoxy against\r\nLatin heresy. Theotokes, famous as a preacher, wrote, besides\r\ntheological and controversial works, treatises on mathematics, geography\r\nand physics. Bulgares was a most prolific author; he wrote numerous\r\ntranslations and works on theology, archaeology, philosophy,\r\nmathematics, physics and astronomy; he translated the _Aeneid_ and\r\n_Georgics_ of Virgil into Homeric verse at the request of Catherine II.\r\nHis writings exercised a considerable influence over his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Poets of the Greek revival.\r\n\r\nThe poets of the earlier period of the Greek revival were Constantinos\r\nRhigas (q.v.), the Alcman of the revolutionary movement, whose songs\r\nfired the spirit of his fellow-countrymen; Christopoulos (1772-1847), a\r\nPhanariote, who wrote some charming Anacreontics, and Jacobos Rizos\r\nNeroulos (1778-1850), also a Phanariote, author of tragedies, comedies\r\nand lyrics, and of a work in French on modern Greek literature. They are\r\nfollowed in the epoch of Greek independence by the brothers Panagiotes\r\nand Alexander Soutzos (1800-1868 and 1803-1863) and Alexander Rhizos\r\nRhangabes (Rhankaves, 1810-1892), all three Phanariotes. Both Soutzos\r\nhad a rich command of musical language, were highly ideal in their\r\nconceptions, strongly patriotic and possessed an ardent love of liberty.\r\nBoth imitated to some extent Byron, Lamartine and Beranger; they tried\r\nvarious forms of poetry, but the genius of Panagiotes was essentially\r\nlyrical, that of Alexander satirical. The other great poet of the Greek\r\nrevival, Alexander Rizos Rhangabe, was a writer with a fine poetic\r\nfeeling, exquisite diction and singular beauty and purity of thought and\r\nsentiment. Besides numerous odes, hymns, ballads, narrative poems,\r\ntragedies and comedies, he wrote several prose works, including a\r\nhistory of ancient Greece, a history of modern Greek literature, several\r\nnovels and works on ancient art and archaeology. Among the numerous\r\ndramatic works of this time may be mentioned the [Greek: Maria\r\nDoxipatre] of Demetrios Bernardakes, a Cretan, the scene of which is\r\nlaid in the Morea at the time of the crusades.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Prose writers of the revival.\r\n\r\nIn prose composition, as in poetry, the national revival was marked by\r\nan abundant output. Among the historians the greatest is Spiridon\r\nTrikoupis, whose _History of the Revolution_ is a monumental work. It is\r\ndistinguished by beauty of style, clearness of exposition and an\r\nimpartiality which is all the more remarkable as the author played a\r\nleading part in the events which he narrates. Almost all the chiefs of\r\nthe revolutionary movement left their memoirs; even Kolokotrones, who\r\nwas illiterate, dictated his recollections. John Philemon, of\r\nConstantinople, wrote a history of the revolution in six volumes. He was\r\nan ardent partisan of Russia, and as such was opposed to Trikoupis, who\r\nwas attached to the English party. K. Paparrhegopoulos's _History of the\r\nGreek Nation_ is especially valuable in regard to the later periods; in\r\nregard to the earlier he largely follows Gibbon and Grote. With him may\r\nbe mentioned Moustoxides of Corfu, who wrote on Greek history and\r\nliterature; Sakellarios, who dealt with the topography and history of\r\nCyprus; N. Dragoumes, whose historical memoirs treat of the period which\r\nfollowed the revolution; K. Assopios, who wrote on Greek literature and\r\nhistory. In theology Oeconomos fills the place occupied by Miniates in\r\nthe 17th century as a great preacher. Kontogones is well known by his\r\n_History of Patristic Literature of the First Three Centuries_ and his\r\n_Ecclesiastical History_, and Philotheos Bryennios, bishop of Serres, by\r\nhis elaborate edition of _Clemens Romanus_. Kastorches wrote well on\r\nLatin literature. Great literary activity in the domains of law,\r\npolitical economy, mathematics, the physical sciences and archaeology\r\ndisplayed itself in the generation after the establishment of the Greek\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Coraes.\r\n\r\nBut the writer who at the time of the national revival not only\r\nexercised the greatest influence over his contemporaries but even to a\r\nlarge extent shaped the future course of Greek literature was Adamantios\r\nCoraes (Korais) of Chios. This remarkable man, who devoted his life to\r\nphilological studies, was at the same time an ardent patriot, and in the\r\nprolegomena to his numerous editions of the classical writers, written\r\nIn Greek or French, he strove to awake the interest of his countrymen in\r\nthe past glories of their race or administered to them sage counsels, at\r\nthe same time addressing ardent appeals to civilized Europe on their\r\nbehalf. The great importance of Coraes, however, lies in the fact that\r\nhe was practically the founder of the modern literary language.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The modern literary language.\r\n\r\nIn contemporary Greek literature two distinct forms of the modern\r\nlanguage present themselves--the vernacular ([Greek: he kathomiloumene])\r\nand the purified ([Greek: he kathareuousa]). The former is the oral\r\nlanguage, spoken by the whole Greek world, with local dialectic\r\nvariations; the latter is based on the Greek of the Hellenistic writers,\r\nmodified, but not essentially altered, in successive ages by the popular\r\nspeech. At the time of the War of Independence the enthusiasm of the\r\nGreeks and the Philhellenes was fired by the memory of an illustrious\r\npast, and at its close a classical reaction followed: the ancient\r\nnomenclature was introduced in every department of the new state, towns\r\nand districts received their former names, and children were christened\r\nafter Greek heroes and philosophers instead of the Christian saints. In\r\nthe literary revival which attended the national movement, two schools\r\nof writers made their appearance--the purists, who, rejecting the spoken\r\nidiom as degenerate and corrupt, aimed at the restoration of the\r\nclassical language, and the vulgarists, who regarded the vernacular or\r\n\"Romaic\" as the genuine and legitimate representative of the ancient\r\ntongue. A controversy which had existed in former times was thus\r\nrevived, with the result that a state of confusion still prevails in the\r\nnational literature. The classical scholar who is as yet unacquainted\r\nwith modern Greek will find, in the pages of an ordinary periodical or\r\nnewspaper, specimens of the conventional literary language, which he can\r\nread with ease side by side with poems or even prose in the vernacular\r\nwhich he will be altogether unable to interpret.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Reforms of Coraes.\r\n\r\nThe vernacular or oral language is never taught, but is universally\r\nspoken. It has been evolved from the ancient language by a natural and\r\nregular process, similar to that which has produced the Romance\r\nlanguages from the Latin, or the Russian, Bulgarian and Servian from the\r\nold Slavonic. It has developed on parallel lines with the modern\r\nEuropean languages, and in obedience to the same laws; like them, it\r\nmight have grown into a literary language had any great writers arisen\r\nin the middle ages to do for it what Dante and his successors of the\r\n_trecento_ did for Italian. But the effort to adapt it to the\r\nrequirements of modern literature could hardly prove successful. In the\r\nfirst place, the national sentiment of the Greeks prompts them to\r\nimitate the classical writers, and so far as possible to appropriate\r\ntheir diction. The beauty and dignity of the ancient tongue possesses\r\nsuch an attraction for cultivated writers that they are led insensibly\r\nto adopt its forms and borrow from its wealth of phrase and idiom. In\r\nthe next place, a certain literary tradition and usage has already been\r\nformed which cannot easily be broken down. For more than half a century\r\nthe generally accepted written language, half modern half ancient, has\r\nbeen in use in the schools, the university, the parliament, the state\r\ndepartments and the pulpit, and its influence upon the speech of the\r\nmore educated classes is already noticeable. It largely owes its present\r\nform--though a fixed standard is still lacking--to the influence and\r\nteaching of Coraes. As in the time of the decadence a [Greek: koine\r\ndialektos] stood midway between the classical language and the popular\r\nspeech, so at the beginning of the 19th century there existed a common\r\nliterary dialect, largely influenced by the vernacular, but retaining\r\nthe characteristics of the old Hellenistic, from which it was derived by\r\nan unbroken literary tradition. This written language Coraes took as the\r\nbasis of his reforms, purging it of foreign elements, preserving its\r\nclassical remnants and enlarging its vocabulary with words borrowed from\r\nthe ancient lexicon or, in case of need, invented in accordance with a\r\nfixed principle. He thus adopted a middle course, discountenancing alike\r\nthe pedantry of the purists and the over-confident optimism of the\r\nvulgarists, who found in the uncouth popular speech all the material\r\nfor a _langue savante_. The language which he thus endeavoured to shape\r\nand reconstruct is, of course, conventional and artificial. In course of\r\ntime it will probably tend to approach the vernacular, while the latter\r\nwill gradually be modified by the spread of education. The spoken and\r\nwritten languages, however, will always be separated by a wide interval.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Poetical writers in the vernacular.\r\n\r\nMany of the best poets of modern Greece have written in the vernacular,\r\nwhich is best adapted for the natural and spontaneous expression of the\r\nfeelings. Dionysios Solomos (1798-1857), the greatest of them all,\r\nemployed the dialect of the Ionian Islands. Of his lyrics, which are\r\nfull of poetic fire and inspiration, the most celebrated is his \"Ode to\r\nLiberty.\" Other poets, of what may be described as the Ionic school,\r\nsuch as Andreas Kalvos (1796-1869), Julius Typaldos (1814-1883), John\r\nZampelios (1787-1856), and Gerasimos Markoras (b. 1826), followed his\r\nexample in using the Heptanesian dialect. On the other hand, Georgios\r\nTerzetes (1806-1874), Aristotle Valaorites (1824-1879) and Gerasimos\r\nMavrogiannes, though natives of the Ionian Islands, adopted in their\r\nlyrics the language of the Klephtic ballads--in other words, the\r\nvernacular of the Pindus range and the mountainous district of Epirus.\r\nThis dialect had at least the advantage of being generally current\r\nthroughout the mainland, while it derived distinction from the heroic\r\nexploits of the champions of Greek liberty. The poems of Valaorites,\r\nwhich are characterized by vivid imagination and grace of style, have\r\nmade a deep impression on the nation. Other poets who largely employed\r\nthe Epirotic dialect and drew their inspiration from the Klephtic songs\r\nwere John Vilaras (1771-1823), George Zalokostas (1805-1857) in his\r\nlyric pieces, and Theodore Aphentoules, a Cretan (d. 1893). With the\r\npoems of this group may be classed those of Demetrius Bikelas (b. 1835).\r\nThe popular language has been generally adopted by the younger\r\ngeneration of poets, among whom may be mentioned Aristomenes Probelegios\r\n(b. 1850), George Bizyenos (1853-1896), George Drosines, Kostes Palamas\r\n(b. 1859), John Polemes, Argyres Ephthaliotes, and Jacob Polylas (d.\r\n1896).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Poetical writers in the conventional language.\r\n\r\nContemporary with the first-mentioned or Ionic group, there existed at\r\nConstantinople a school of poets who wrote in the accepted literary\r\nlanguage, and whose writings serve as models for the later group which\r\ngathered at Athens after the emancipation of Greece. The literary\r\ntraditions founded by Alexander Rizos Rhangabes (1810-1892) and the\r\nbrothers Alexander and Panagiotis Soutzos (1803-1863 and 1800-1868), who\r\nbelonged to Phanariot families, were maintained in Athens by Spiridion\r\nBasiliades (1843-1874) Angelos Vlachos (b. 1838), John Karasoutzas\r\n(1824-1873), Demetrios Paparrhegopoulos (1843-1873), and Achilles\r\nParaschos (b. 1838). The last, a poet of fine feeling, has also employed\r\nthe popular language. In general the practice of versification in the\r\nconventional literary language has declined, though sedulously\r\nencouraged by the university of Athens, and fostered by annual poetic\r\ncompetitions with prizes provided by patriotic citizens. Greek lyric\r\npoetry during the first half of the century was mainly inspired by the\r\npatriotic sentiment aroused by the struggle for independence, but in the\r\npresent generation it often shows a tendency towards the philosophic and\r\ncontemplative mood under the influence of Western models.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dramatists, translators and satirists.\r\n\r\nThere has been an abundant production of dramatic literature in recent\r\nyears. In succession to Alexander Rhangabes, John Zampelios and the two\r\nSoutzos, who belong to the past generation, Kleon Rhangabes, Angelos\r\nVlachos, Demetrios Koromelas, Basiliades and Bernadakes are the most\r\nprominent among modern dramatic writers. Numerous translations of\r\nforeign masterpieces have appeared, among which the metrical versions of\r\n_Romeo and Juliet_, _Othello_, _King Lear_, _Hamlet_, _Macbeth_ and _The\r\nMerchant of Venice_, by Demetrios Bikelas, deserve mention as examples\r\nof artistic excellence. Goethe's _Faust_ has been rendered into verse by\r\nProbelegios, and _Hamlet_, _Antony and Cleopatra_, _Coriolanus and\r\nJulius Caesar_, into prose by Damiroles. Among recent satirists, George\r\nSoures (b. 1853) occupies a unique position. He reviews social and\r\npolitical events in the [Greek: Rhomeos], a witty little newspaper\r\nwritten entirely in verse, which is read with delight by all classes of\r\nthe population.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Recent prose writers.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the prose writers have employed the literary language. In\r\nhistorical research the Greeks continue to display much activity and\r\nerudition, but no great work comparable to Spiridion Trikoupis's\r\n_History of the Revolution_ has appeared in the present generation. A\r\nhistory of the Greek nation from the earliest times to the present day,\r\nby Spiridion Lampros, and a general history of the 19th century by\r\nKarolides, have recently been published. The valuable [Greek: Mnemeia]\r\nof Sathas, the [Greek: meletai Byzantines historias] of Spiridion\r\nZampelios and Mavrogiannes's _History of the Ionian Islands_ deserve\r\nspecial mention, as well as the essays of Bikelas, which treat of the\r\nByzantine and modern epochs of Greek history. Some of the last-named\r\nwere translated into English by the late marquis of Bute. Among the\r\nwriters on jurisprudence are Peter Paparrhegopoulos, Kalligas, Basileios\r\nOekonomedes and Nikolaos Saripolos. Brailas-Armenes and John\r\nSkaltzounes, the latter an opponent of Darwin, have written\r\nphilosophical works. The _Ecclesiastical History_ of Diomedes Kyriakos\r\nand the _Theological Treatises_ of Archbishop Latas should be noted. The\r\nbest-known writers of philological works are Constantine Kontos, a\r\nstrong advocate of literary purism, George Hatzidakes, Theodore\r\nPapademetrakopoulos and John Psichari; in archaeology, Stephen\r\nKoumanoudes, Panagiotes Kavvadias and Christos Tsountas have won a\r\nrecognized position among scholars. John Svoronos is a high authority on\r\nnumismatics. The works of John Hatzidakes on mathematics, Anast.\r\nChristomanos on chemistry, and Demetrios Aeginetes on astronomy are well\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fiction.\r\n\r\nThe earlier works of fiction, written in the period succeeding the\r\nemancipation of Greece, were much affected by foreign influence. Modern\r\nGreece has not produced any great novelist. The [Greek: Kretikoi gamoi]\r\nof Spiridion Zampelios, the scene of which is laid in Crete, and the\r\n_Thanos Blechas_ of Kalligas are interesting, the former for accuracy of\r\nhistorical detail, the latter as a picture of peasant life in the\r\nmountains of Greece. Original novel writing has not been much\r\ncultivated, but translations of foreign romances abound. In later times\r\nthe short story has come into vogue through the example of D. Bikelas,\r\nwhose tales have acquired great popularity; one of them, _Loukis Laras_,\r\nhas been translated into many languages. The example of Bikelas has been\r\nfollowed by Drosines Karkavitzas, Ephthaliotis, Xenopoulos and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Prose writers in the vernacular.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished of the writers who adhere to the vernacular in\r\nprose is John Psichari, professor of the Ecole des Hautes Etudes in\r\nParis. He is the recognized leader of the vulgarists. Among the best\r\nknown of his works are [Greek: To taxeidi mou], a narrative of a journey\r\nin Greek lands, [Greek: Toneiro tou Giannire], [Greek: He Zoulea], and\r\n[Greek: ho Magos]. The tales of Karkavitzas and Ephthaliotis are also in\r\nthe vernacular. Among the younger of M. Psichari's followers is M.\r\nPalli, who has recently published a translation of the _Iliad_. Owing to\r\nthe limited resources of the popular language, the writers of this\r\nschool are sometimes compelled to employ strange and little-known words\r\nborrowed from the various dialects. The vernacular has never been\r\nadopted by writers on scientific subjects, owing to its inherent\r\nunsuitability and the incongruity arising from the introduction of\r\ntechnical terms derived from the ancient language. Notwithstanding the\r\nzeal of its adherents, it seems unlikely to maintain its place in\r\nliterature outside the domain of poetry; nor can any other result be\r\nexpected, unless its advocates succeed in reforming the system of public\r\ninstruction in Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Periodicals and Journals.\r\n\r\nMany periodicals are published at Athens, among which may be mentioned\r\nthe _Athena_, edited by Constantine Kontos, the _Ethnike Agoge_, a\r\ncontinuation of the old _Hestia_, the _Harmonia_ and the [Greek:\r\nDiaplasis ton paidon], an educational review. The Parnassos, the\r\nArchaeological Society and other learned bodies issue annual or\r\nquarterly reports. The Greek journals are both numerous and widely read.\r\nThey contain much clever writing, which is often marred by inaccuracy\r\nand a deficient sense of responsibility. Their tendency to exaggerated\r\npatriotic sentiment sometimes borders on the ludicrous. For many years\r\nthe Nea _Hemera_ of Trieste exerted a considerable influence over the\r\nGreek world, owing to the able political reviews of its editor,\r\nAnastasios Byzantios (d. 1898), a publicist of remarkable insight and\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Constantine Sathas, [Greek: Neoellenike philologia]\r\n  (Athens, 1868); D.

The recent development of anthropological science and of\r\nthe comparative study of religions has enabled us at last to assign to\r\nancient Greek religion its proper place in the classification of creeds\r\nand to appreciate its importance for the history of civilization. In\r\nspite of all the diversities of local cults we may find a general\r\ndefinition of the theological system of the Hellenic communities, and\r\nwith sufficient accuracy may describe it as an anthropomorphic\r\npolytheism, preserving many traces of a pre-anthropomorphic period,\r\nunchecked by any exacting dogma or tradition of revelation, and\r\ntherefore pliantly adapting itself to all the changing circumstance of\r\nthe social and political history of the race, and easily able to\r\nassimilate alien ideas and forms. Such a religion, continuing in whole\r\nor in part throughout a period of at least 2000 years, was more capable\r\nof progress than others, possibly higher, that have crystallized at an\r\nearly period into a fixed dogmatic type; and as, owing to its essential\r\ncharacter, it could not be convulsed by any inner revolution that might\r\nobliterate the deposits of its earlier life, it was likely to preserve\r\nthe imprints of the successive ages of culture, and to reveal more\r\nclearly than any other testimony the evolution of the race from savagery\r\nto civilization. Hence it is that Greek religion appears to teem with\r\nincongruities, the highest forms of religious life being often\r\nconfronted with the most primitive. And for this reason the student of\r\nsavage anthropology and the student of the higher religions of the\r\nworld are equally rewarded by its study.\r\n\r\nModern ethnology has arrived at the conviction that the Hellenic nation,\r\nlike others that have played great parts in history, was the product of\r\na blend of populations, the conquering tribes of Aryan descent coming\r\nfrom the north and settling among and upon certain pre-Hellenic\r\nMediterranean stocks. The conclusion that is naturally drawn from this\r\nis that Hellenic religion is also the product of a blend of early Aryan\r\nor Indo-Germanic beliefs with the cult-ideas and practices of the\r\nMediterranean area that were from of old indigenous in the lands which\r\nthe later invaders conquered. But to disentangle these two component\r\nparts of the whole, which might seem to be the first problem for the\r\nhistory of the development of this religion, is by no means an easy\r\ntask; we may advance further towards its solution, when the mysterious\r\npre-Hellenic Mediterranean language or group of languages, of which\r\ntraces remain in Hellenic place-names, and which may be lying\r\nuninterpreted on the brick-tablets of the palace of Cnossus, has found\r\nits interpreter. For the first question is naturally one of language.\r\nBut the comparative study of the Indo-European speech-group, great as\r\nits philological triumphs have been, has been meagre in its\r\ncontributions to our positive knowledge of the original belief of the\r\nprimitive stock. It is not possible to reconstruct a common\r\nIndo-European religion. The greater part of the separate Aryan\r\ncult-systems may have developed after the diffusion and may have been\r\nthe result of contact in prehistoric days with non-Aryan peoples. And\r\nmany old religious etymological equations, such as [Greek: Ouranos] =\r\nSanskrit Varuna, [Greek: Hermes] = Saramey[=a]s, Athena = Ahana, were\r\nuncritically made and have been abandoned. The chief fact that philology\r\nhas revealed concerning the religious vocabulary of the Aryan peoples is\r\nthat many of them are found to have designated a high god by a word\r\nderived from a root meaning \"bright,\" and which appears in Zeus,\r\nJupiter, Sanskrit _Dyaus_. This is important enough, but we should not\r\nexaggerate its importance, nor draw the unwarranted inference that\r\ntherefore the primitive Indo-Europeans worshipped one supreme God, the\r\nSky-Father. Besides the word \"Zeus,\" the only other names of the\r\nHellenic pantheon that can be explained wholly or partly as words of\r\nAryan formation are Poseidon, Demeter, Hestia, Dionysus (whose name and\r\ncult were derived from the Aryan stock of the Thraco-Phrygians) and\r\nprobably Pan. But other names, such as Athena, Ares, Apollo, Artemis,\r\nHera, Hermes, have no discovered affinities with other Aryan\r\nspeech-groups; and yet there is nothing suspiciously non-Aryan in the\r\nformation of these words, and they may all have belonged to the earliest\r\nHellenic-Aryan vocabulary. In regard to others, such as Rhea, Hephaestus\r\nand Aphrodite, it is somewhat more probable that they belonged to an\r\nolder pre-Hellenic stock that survived in Crete and other islands, and\r\nhere and there on the mainland; while we know that Zeus derived certain\r\nunintelligible titles in Cretan cult from the indigenous Eteo-cretan\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nA minute consideration of a large mass of evidence justifies the\r\nconclusion that the main tribes of the Aryan Hellenes, pushing down from\r\nthe north, already possessed certain deities in common such as Zeus,\r\nPoseidon and Apollo with whom they associated certain goddesses, and\r\nthat they maintained the cult of Hestia or \"Holy Hearth.\" Further, a\r\ncomparison of the developed religions of the respective Aryan peoples\r\nsuggests that they tended to give predominance to the male divinity,\r\nalthough we have equally good reason to assert that the cult of\r\ngoddesses, and especially of the earth-goddess, is a genuinely \"Aryan\"\r\nproduct. But when the tribes of this family poured into the Greek\r\npeninsula, it is probable that they would find in certain centres of a\r\nvery ancient civilization, such as Argolis and Crete, the dominant cult\r\nof a female divinity.[1] The recent excavations on the site of the Hera\r\ntemple at Argos prove that a powerful goddess was worshipped here many\r\ncenturies before it is probable that the Hellenic invader appeared. He\r\nmay have even found the name Hera there, or may have brought it with him\r\nand applied it to the indigenous divinity. Again, we are certain that\r\nthe great mother-goddess of Crete, discovered by Dr Arthur Evans, is the\r\nancestress of Rhea and of the Greek \"Mother of the gods\": and it is a\r\nreasonable conjecture that she accounts for many of the forms of Artemis\r\nand perhaps for Athena. But the evidence by no means warrants us in\r\nassuming as an axiom that wherever we find a dominant goddess-cult, as\r\nthat of Demeter at Eleusis, we are confronted with a non-Hellenic\r\nreligious phenomenon. The very name \"Demeter\" and the study of other\r\nAryan religions prove the prominence of the worship of the earth-goddess\r\nin our own family of the nations. Finally, we must reckon with the\r\npossibility that the other great nations which fringed the\r\nMediterranean, Hittite, Semitic and Egyptian peoples, left their impress\r\non early Greek religion, although former scholars may have made rash use\r\nof this hypothesis.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Animism.\r\n\r\nRecognizing then the great perplexity of these problems concerning the\r\nethnic origins of Hellenic religion, we may at least reduce the tangle\r\nof facts to some order by distinguishing its lower from its higher\r\nforms, and thus provide the material for some theory of evolution. We\r\nmay collect and sift the phenomena that remain over from a\r\npre-anthropomorphic period, the imprints of a savage past, the beliefs\r\nand practices that belong to the animistic or even the pre-animistic\r\nperiod, fetishism, the worship of animals, human sacrifice. We shall at\r\nonce be struck with the contrast between such civilized cults as those\r\nof Zeus, Athena, Apollo, high personal divinities to whom the attributes\r\nof a progressive morality could be attached, and practices that long\r\nsurvived in backward communities, such as the Arcadian worship of the\r\nthunder and the winds, the cult of Zeus [Greek: Keraunos] \"the thunder\"\r\nat Mantinea and Zeus [Greek: Kappotas] in Laconia, who is none other\r\nthan the mysterious meteoric stone that falls from heaven. These are\r\nexamples of a religious view in which certain natural phenomena or\r\nobjects are regarded as mysteriously divine or sacred in their own right\r\nand a personal divinity has not yet emerged or been separated from them.\r\nA noteworthy product of primitive animistic feeling is the universally\r\nprevalent cult of Hestia, who is originally \"Holy Hearth\" pure and\r\nsimple, and who even under the developed polytheism, in which she played\r\nno small part, was never established as a separate anthropomorphic\r\npersonage.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fetishism\r\n\r\nThe animistic belief that certain material objects can be charged with a\r\ndivine potency or spirit gives rise to fetishism, a term which properly\r\ndenotes the worshipful or superstitious use of objects made by art and\r\ninvested with mysterious power, so as to be used like amulets for the\r\npurposes of protective magic or for higher purposes of communion with\r\nthe divinity. From the earliest discoverable period down to the present\r\nday fetishism has been a powerful factor in the religion of the\r\nGraeco-Roman world. The importance of the sacred stone and pillar in the\r\n\"Mycenaean\" or \"Minoan\" period which preceded Homer has been\r\nimpressively shown by Dr Arthur Evans, and the same fetishistic worship\r\ncontinued throughout the historic ages of classic paganism, the rude\r\naniconic emblem of pillar or tree-trunk surviving often by the side of\r\nthe iconic masterpiece. It is a reasonable conjecture that the earliest\r\nanthropomorphic images of divinities, which were beginning to make their\r\nappearance by the time of Homer, were themselves evolved by slow\r\ntransformation from the upright sacred column. And the altar itself may\r\nhave arisen as another form of this; the simple heap of stones, such as\r\nthose erected to Hermes by the way-side and called [Greek: Hermaioi\r\nlophoi], may have served both as a place of worship and as an _agalma_\r\nthat could attract and absorb a divine potency into itself. Hence the\r\nfetishistic power of the altar was fully recognized in Greek ritual, and\r\nhence also in the cult of Apollo Agyieus the god and the altar are\r\ncalled by the same name.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that the ancestors of the historic Greeks, before\r\nthey were habituated to conceive of their divinities as in human form,\r\nmay have been accustomed to invest them with animal attributes and\r\ntraits. We must not indeed suppose it to be a general law of religious\r\nevolution that \"theriomorphism\" must always precede anthropomorphism and\r\nthat the latter transcends and obliterates the former. The two systems\r\ncan exist side by side, and savages of low religious development can\r\nconceive of their deities as assuming at one time human, at another\r\nbestial, shape. Now the developed Greek religion was devotedly\r\nanthropomorphic, and herein lay its strength and its weakness;\r\nnevertheless, the advanced Hellene could imagine his Dionysus entering\r\ntemporarily into the body of the sacrificial bull or goat, and the men\r\nof Phigalia in Arcadia were attached to their horse-headed Demeter, and\r\nthe primitive Laconians possibly to a ram-headed Apollo. Theriolatry in\r\nitself, i.e. the worship of certain animals as of divine power in their\r\nown right, apart from any association with higher divinities, can\r\nscarcely be traced among the Greek communities at any period. They are\r\nnot found to have paid reverence to any species, though individual\r\nanimals could acquire temporarily a divine character through communion\r\nwith the altar or with the god. The wolf might at one time have been\r\nregarded as the incarnation of Apollo, the wolf-god, and here and there\r\nwe find faint traces of a wolf-sacrifice and of offerings laid out for\r\nwolves. But the occasional propitiation of wild beasts may fall short of\r\nactual worship. The Athenian who slew a wolf might give it a sumptuous\r\nfuneral, probably to avoid a blood-feud with the wolf's relatives, yet\r\nthe Athenian state offered rewards for a wolf's head. Nor did any Greek\r\nindividual or state worship flies as a class, although a small oblation\r\nmight be thrown to the flies before the great sacrifice to Apollo on the\r\nLeucadian rock, to please them and to persuade them not to worry the\r\nworshippers at the great solemnity, where the reek of roast flesh would\r\nbe likely to attract them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Totemism.\r\n\r\nTheriolatry suggests totemism; and though we now know that the former\r\ncan arise and exist quite independently of the latter, recent\r\nanthropologists have interpreted the apparent sanctity or prestige of\r\ncertain animals in parts of Greek mythology and religion as the deposit\r\nof an earlier totemistic system. But this interpretation, originated and\r\nmaintained with great acumen by Andrew Lang and W. Robertson Smith,\r\nappears now somewhat hazardous; and as a scientific hypothesis there are\r\nmany flaws in it. The more observant study of existing totem-tribes has\r\nweakened our impression of the importance of totemism as a primitive\r\nreligious phenomenon. It is in reality more important as a social than\r\nas a religious factor. If indeed we choose to regard totemism as a mere\r\nsystem of nomenclature, by which a tribe names itself after some animal\r\nor plant, then we might quote a few examples of Hellenic tribes\r\ntotemistic in this sense. But totemism is a fact of importance only when\r\nit affects the tribal marriage laws or the tribal religion. And the\r\ntribal marriage laws of ancient Greece, so far as they are known, betray\r\nno clear mark of totemistic arrangements; nor does the totemism of\r\ncontemporary savages appear to affect their religion in any such way as\r\nto suggest a natural explanation for any of the peculiar phenomena of\r\nearly Hellenic polytheism. Here and there we have traces of a\r\nsnake-tribe in Greece, the [Greek: Ophieis] in Aetolia, the [Greek:\r\nOphiogeneis] in Cyprus and Parium, but we are not told that these\r\nworshipped the snake, though the latter clan were on terms of intimacy\r\nwith it. Where the snake was actually worshipped in Hellenic cult--the\r\ncases are few and doubtful--it may have been regarded as the incarnation\r\nof the ancestor or as the _avatar_ of the under-world divinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Human sacrifice.\r\n\r\nFinally, among the primitive or savage phenomena the practice of human\r\nsacrifice looms large. Encouraged at one time by the Delphic oracle, it\r\nwas becoming rare and repellent to the conscience by the 6th century\r\nB.C.; but it was not wholly extinct in the Greek world even by the time\r\nof Porphyry. The facts are very complex and need critical handling, and\r\na satisfying scientific explanation of them all is still to be sought.\r\n\r\nWe can now observe the higher aspects of the advanced polytheism. And at\r\nthe outset we must distinguish between mythology and religion strictly\r\nunderstood, between the stories about the divinities and the private or\r\npublic religious service. No doubt the former are often a reflection of\r\nthe latter, in many cases being suggested by the ritual which they may\r\nhave been invented to interpret, and often envisaging important\r\ncult-ideas. Such for example are the myths about the purification and\r\ntrial of Orestes, Theseus, Ixion, the story of Demeter's sorrow, of the\r\nsufferings and triumph of Dionysus, and those about the abolition of\r\nhuman sacrifice. Yet Greek mythology as a whole was irresponsible,\r\nwithout reserve, and unchecked by dogma or sacerdotal prohibition; and\r\nfrequently it sank below the level of the current religion, which was\r\nalmost free from the impurities which shock the modern reader of\r\nHellenic myths. Nor again did any one feel himself called upon to\r\nbelieve any particular myth; in fact, faith, understood in the sense in\r\nwhich the term is used in Christian theology, as the will to believe\r\ncertain dogmatic statements about the nature and action of divinity, is\r\na concept which was neither named nor recognized in Hellenic ethics or\r\nreligious doctrine; only, if a man proclaimed his disbelief in the\r\nexistence of the gods and refused to join in the ritual of the\r\ncommunity, he would become \"suspect,\" and might at times be persecuted\r\nby his fellows. Greek religion was not so much an affair of doctrine as\r\nof ritual, religious formulae of which the cult-titles of the divinities\r\nwere an important component, and prayer; and the most illuminative\r\nsources of our knowledge of it are the ritual-inscriptions and other\r\nstate-documents, the private dedications, the monuments of religious art\r\nand certain passages in the literature, philology and archaeology being\r\nequally necessary to the equipment of the student.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Religion in Homer.\r\n\r\nWe are tempted to turn to Homer as the earliest authority. And though\r\nHomer is not primitive and does not present even an approximately\r\ncomplete account of Greek religion, we can gather from his poems a\r\npicture of an advanced polytheism which in form and structure at least\r\nis that which was presented to the world of Aeschylus. We discern a\r\npantheon already to some extent systematized, a certain hierarchy and\r\nfamily of divinities in which the supremacy of Zeus is established as\r\nincontestable. And the anthropomorphic impulse, the strongest trend in\r\nthe Greek religious imagination, which filled the later world with\r\nfictitious personages, generating transparent shams such as an\r\nAmpidromus for the ritual of the Ampidromia, Amphiction for the\r\nAmphictiones, a hero [Greek: Keramos] for the gild of potters, is\r\nalready at its height in the Homeric poems. The deities are already\r\nclear-cut, individual personalities of distinct ethos, plastically\r\nshaped figures such as the later sculpture and painting could work upon,\r\nnot vaguely conceived _numina_ like the forms of the old Roman religion.\r\nNor can we call them for the most part nature-deities like the\r\npersonages of the Vedic system, thinly disguised \"personifications\" of\r\nnatural phenomena. Athena is not the blue sky nor Apollo the sun; they\r\nare simply Athena and Apollo, divine personages with certain powers and\r\ncharacter, as real for their people as Christ and the Virgin for\r\nChristendom. By the side of these, though generally in a subordinate\r\nposition, we find that Homer recognized certain divinities that we may\r\nproperly call nature-powers, such as Helios, Gaia and the river-deities,\r\nforms descending probably from a remote animistic period, but\r\nmaintaining themselves within the popular religion till the end of\r\nPaganism. Again, though Homer may talk and think at times with levity\r\nand _banalite_ about his deities, his deeper utterances impute an\r\nadvanced morality to the supreme God. His Zeus is on the whole a power\r\nof righteousness, dealing with men by a righteous law of nemesis, never\r\nbeing himself the author of evil--an idea revealed in the opening\r\npassage of the _Odyssey_--but protecting the good and punishing the\r\nwicked. Vengeance, indeed, was one of the attributes of divinity both\r\nfor Homer and the average Greek of the later period, as it is in Judaic\r\nand Christian theology, though Plato and Euripides protested strongly\r\nagainst such a view. But the Homeric Zeus is equally a god of pity and\r\nmercy, and the man who neglects the prayers of the sorrowful and\r\nafflicted, who violates the sanctity of the suppliant and guest, or\r\noppresses the poor or the wanderer, may look for divine punishment.\r\nThough not regarded as the physical author of the universe or the\r\nCreator, he is in a moral sense the father of gods and men. And though\r\nthe sense of sin and the need of piacular sacrifice are expressed in the\r\nHomeric poems, the relations between gods and men that they reveal are\r\non the whole genial and social; the deity sits unseen at the good man's\r\nfestal sacrifice, and there is a simple apprehension of the idea of\r\ndivine communion. There is also indeed a glimmering of the dark\r\nbackground of the nether world, and the chthonian powers that might send\r\nup the Erinys to fulfil the curse of the wronged. Yet on the whole the\r\nreligious atmosphere is generally cheerful and bright; freer than that\r\nof the later ages from the taint of magic and superstition; nor is Homer\r\ntroubled much about the life after death; he scarcely recognizes the\r\ncult of the dead,[3] and is not oppressed by fear of the ghost-world.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The post-Homeric period.\r\n\r\nIf we look now broadly over the salient facts of the Greek public and\r\nprivate worship of the historic period we find much in it that agrees\r\nwith Homeric theology. His \"Olympian\" system retains a certain life\r\nalmost to the end of Paganism, and it is a serious mistake to suppose\r\nthat it had lost its hold upon the people of the 5th and 4th century\r\nB.C. We find it, indeed, enriched in the post-Homeric period with new\r\nfigures of prestige and power; Dionysus, of whom Homer had only faintly\r\nheard, becomes a high god with a worship full of promise for the future.\r\nDemeter and Kore, the mother and the girl, whom Homer knew well enough\r\nbut could not use for his epic purposes, attract the ardent affections\r\nand hopes of the people; and Asclepius, whom the old poet did not\r\nrecognize as a god, wins a conspicuous place in the later shrines. But\r\nmuch that has been said of the Homeric may be said of the later\r\nclassical theology. The deities remain anthropomorphic, and appear as\r\nclearly defined individuals. A certain hierarchy is recognized; Zeus is\r\nsupreme, even in the city of Athena, but each of the higher divinities\r\nplayed many parts, and local enthusiasm could frustrate the departmental\r\nsystem of divine functions; certain members of the pantheon had a\r\npreference for the life of the fields, but as the _polis_ emerged from\r\nthe village communities, Demeter, Hermes, Artemis and others, the gods\r\nand goddesses of the husbandmen and shepherds, become powers of the\r\ncouncil-chamber and the market-place. The moral ideas that we find in\r\nthe Homeric religion are amply attested by cult-records of the later\r\nperiod. The deities are regarded on the whole as beneficent, though\r\nrevengeful if wronged or neglected; the cult-titles used in prayer,\r\nwhich more than any other witnesses reveal the thought and wish of the\r\nworshipper, are nearly always euphemistic, the doubtful title of Demeter\r\nErinys being possibly an exception. The important cults of Zeus [Greek:\r\nHikesios] and [Greek: Prostropaios], the suppliant's protecting deity,\r\nembody the ideas of pity and mercy that mark advanced religion; and many\r\nmomentous steps in the development of morality and law were either\r\nsuggested or assisted by the state-religion. For example, the sanctity\r\nof the oath, the main source of the secular virtue of truthfulness, was\r\noriginally a religious sanction, and though the Greek may have been\r\nprone to perjury, yet the Hellenic like the Hebraic religious ethics\r\nregarded it as a heinous sin. The sanctity of family duties, the\r\nsacredness of the life of the kinsman, were ideas fostered by early\r\nHellenic religion before they generated principles of secular ethics. In\r\nthe post-Homeric period, the development of the doctrine of purity,\r\nwhich was associated with the Apolline religion, combining with a\r\ngrowing dread of the ghost-world, stimulated and influenced in many\r\nimportant ways the evolution of the Greek law concerning homicide.[4]\r\nAnd the beginnings of international law and morality were rooted in\r\nreligious sanctions and taboo. In fact, Greek state-life was indebted in\r\nmanifold ways to Greek religion, and the study of the Greek oracles\r\nwould alone supply sufficient testimony of this. In many cases the very\r\norigin of the state was religious, the earliest _polis_ sometimes having\r\narisen under the shadow of the temple.\r\n\r\nYet as Greek religion was always in the service of the state, and the\r\npriest a state-official, society was the reverse of theocratic. Secular\r\nadvance, moral progress and the march of science, could never long be\r\nthwarted by religious tradition; on the contrary, speculative thought\r\nand artistic creation were considered as attributes of divinity. We may\r\nsay that the religion of Hellas penetrated the whole life of the people,\r\nbut rather as a servant than as a master.\r\n\r\nDistinct and apart from these public worships and those of the clan and\r\nfamily were the mystic cults of Eleusis, Andania and Samothrace, and the\r\nprivate services of the mystic brotherhoods. The latter were scattered\r\nbroadcast over Hellas, and the influence of the former was strengthened\r\nand their significance intensified by the wave of mysticism that spread\r\nat first from the north from the beginning of the 7th century onwards,\r\nand derived its strength from the power of Dionysus and the Orphic\r\nbrotherhoods. New ideals and hopes began to stir in the religious\r\nconsciousness, and we find a strong Salvationist tendency, the promise\r\nof salvation relying on mystic communion with the deity. Also a new and\r\nvital principle is at work; Orphism is the only force in Greek religion\r\nof a clear apostolic purpose, for it broke the barriers of the old\r\ntribal and civic cults, and preached its message to bond and free,\r\nHellene and barbarian.\r\n\r\nThe later history of Greek paganism is mainly concerned with its gradual\r\npenetration by Oriental ideas and worships, and the results of this\r\n[Greek: theokrasia] are discerned in an ever increasing mysticism and a\r\ntendency towards monotheism. Obliterated as the old Hellenic religion\r\nappeared to be by Christianity, it nevertheless retained a certain life,\r\nthough transformed, under the new creed to which it lent much of its\r\nhieratic organization and religious terminology. The indebtedness of\r\nChristianity to Hellenism is one of the most interesting problems of\r\ncomparative religion; and for an adequate estimate a minute knowledge of\r\nthe ritual and the mystic cults of Hellas is one of the essential\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--Older Authorities: A.

His parents\r\nwere of Scottish-Irish descent, but the ancestors of both had been in\r\nNew England for several generations. He was the third of seven children.\r\nHis father, Zaccheus Greeley, owned a farm of 50 acres of stony, sterile\r\nland, from which a bare support was wrung. Horace was a feeble and\r\nprecocious lad, taking little interest in the ordinary sports of\r\nchildhood, learning to read before he was able to talk plainly, and the\r\nprodigy of the neighbourhood for accurate spelling. Before Horace was\r\nten years old (1820), his father became bankrupt, his home was sold by\r\nthe sheriff, and Zaccheus Greeley himself fled the state to escape\r\narrest for debt. The family soon removed to West Haven, Vermont, where,\r\nall working together, they made a scanty living as day labourers. Horace\r\nfrom childhood desired to be a printer, and, when barely eleven years\r\nold, tried to be taken as an apprentice in an office at Whitehall, New\r\nYork, but was rejected on account of his youth. After three years more\r\nwith the family as a day labourer at West Haven, he succeeded, with his\r\nfather's consent, in being apprenticed in the office of _The Northern\r\nSpectator_, at East Poultney, Vermont. Here he soon became a good\r\nworkman, developed a passion for politics and especially for political\r\nstatistics, came to be depended upon for more or less of the editing of\r\nthe paper, and was a figure in the village debating society. He received\r\nonly $40 a year, but he sent most of his money to his father. In June\r\n1830 _The Northern Spectator_ was suspended. Meantime his father had\r\nremoved to a small tract of wild land in the dense forests of Western\r\nPennsylvania, 30 m. from Erie. The released apprentice now visited his\r\nparents, and worked for a little time with them on the farm, meanwhile\r\nseeking employment in various printing offices, and, when he got it,\r\ngiving nearly all his earnings to his father. At last, with no further\r\nprospect of work nearer home, he started for New York. He travelled on\r\nfoot and by canal-boat, entering New York in August 1831, with all his\r\nclothes in a bundle carried over his back with a stick, and with but $10\r\nin his pocket. More than half of this sum was exhausted while he made\r\nvain efforts to find employment. Many refused to employ him, in the\r\nbelief that he was a runaway apprentice, and his poor, ill-fitting\r\napparel and rustic look were everywhere greatly against him. At last he\r\nfound work on a 32mo New Testament, set in agate, double columns, with a\r\nmiddle column of notes in pearl. It was so difficult and so poorly paid\r\nthat other printers had all abandoned it. He barely succeeded in making\r\nenough to pay his board bill, but he finished the task, and thus found\r\nsubsequent employment easier to get.\r\n\r\nIn January 1833 Greeley formed a partnership with Francis V. Story, a\r\nfellow-workman. Their combined capital amounted to about $150. Procuring\r\ntheir type on credit, they opened a small office, and undertook the\r\nprinting of the _Morning Post_, the first cheap paper published in New\r\nYork. Its projector, Dr Horatio D. Shepard, meant to sell it for one\r\ncent, but under the arguments of Greeley he was persuaded to fix the\r\nprice at two cents. The paper failed in less than three weeks, the\r\nprinters losing only $50 or $60 by the experiment. They still had a\r\n_Bank Note Reporter_ to print, and soon got the printing of a tri-weekly\r\npaper, the _Constitutionalist_, the organ of some lottery dealers.\r\nWithin six months Story was drowned, but his brother-in-law, Jonas\r\nWinchester, took his place in the firm. Greeley was now asked by James\r\nGordon Bennett to go into partnership with him in starting _The Herald_.\r\nHe declined the venture, but recommended the partner whom Bennett\r\nsubsequently took. On the 2nd of March 1834, Greeley and Winchester\r\nissued the first number of _The New Yorker_, a weekly literary and news\r\npaper, the firm then supposing itself to be worth about $3000. Of the\r\nfirst number they sold about 100 copies; of the second, nearly 200.\r\nThere was an average increase for the next month of about 100 copies per\r\nweek. The second volume began with a circulation of about 4550 copies,\r\nand with a loss on the first year's publication of $3000. The second\r\nyear ended with 7000 subscribers and a further loss of $2000. By the end\r\nof the third year _The New Yorker_ had reached a circulation of 9500\r\ncopies, and had sustained a total loss of $7000. It was published seven\r\nyears (until the 20th of September 1841), and was never profitable, but\r\nit was widely popular, and it gave Greeley, who was its sole editor,\r\nmuch prominence. On the 5th of July 1836 Greeley married Miss Mary Y.\r\nCheney, a Connecticut school teacher, whom he had met in a Grahamite\r\n(vegetarian) boarding-house in New York.\r\n\r\nDuring the publication of _The New Yorker_ he added to the scanty income\r\nwhich the job printing brought him by supplying editorials to the\r\nshort-lived _Daily Whig_ and various other publications. In 1838 he had\r\ngained such standing as a writer that he was selected by Thurlow Weed,\r\nWilliam H. Seward, and other leaders of the Whig Party, for the\r\neditorship of a campaign paper entitled _The Jeffersonian_, published at\r\nAlbany. He continued _The New Yorker_, and travelled between Albany and\r\nNew York each week to edit the two papers. The _Jeffersonian_ was a\r\nquiet and instructive rather than a vehement campaign sheet, and the\r\nWhigs believed that it had a great effect upon the elections of the next\r\nyear. When, on the 2nd of May 1840, some time after the nomination by\r\nthe Whig party of William Henry Harrison for the Presidency, Greeley\r\nbegan the publication of a new weekly campaign paper, _The Log Cabin_,\r\nit sprang at once into a great circulation; 40,000 copies of the first\r\nnumber were sold, and it finally rose to 80,000. It was considered a\r\nbrilliant political success, but it was not profitable, and in September\r\n1841 was merged in the _Weekly Tribune_. On the 3rd of April 1841,\r\nGreeley announced that on the following Saturday (April 10th) he would\r\nbegin the publication of a daily newspaper of the same general\r\nprinciples, to be called _The Tribune_. He was now entirely without\r\nmoney. From a personal friend, James Coggeshall, he borrowed $1000, on\r\nwhich capital and the editor's reputation _The Tribune_ was founded. It\r\nbegan with 500 subscribers. The first week's expenses were $525 and the\r\nreceipts $92. By the end of the fourth week it had run up a circulation\r\nof 6000, and by the seventh reached 11,000, which was then the full\r\ncapacity of its press. It was alert, cheerful and aggressive, was\r\ngreatly helped by the attacks of rival papers, and promised success\r\nalmost from the start.\r\n\r\nFrom this time Greeley was popularly identified with _The Tribune_, and\r\nits share in the public discussion of the time is his history. It soon\r\nbecame moderately prosperous, and his assured income should have placed\r\nhim beyond pecuniary worry. His income was long above $15,000 per year,\r\nfrequently as much as $35,000 or more. But he lacked business thrift,\r\ninherited a disposition to endorse for his friends, and was often unable\r\nto distinguish between deserving applicants for aid and adventurers. He\r\nwas thus frequently straitened, and, as his necessities pressed, he sold\r\nsuccessive interests in his newspaper. At the outset he owned the whole\r\nof it. When it was already firmly established (in July 1841), he took in\r\nThomas McElrath as an equal partner, upon the contribution of $2000 to\r\nthe common fund. By the 1st of January 1849 he had reduced his interest\r\nto 31-1/2 shares out of 100; by July 2nd, 1860, to 15 shares; in 1868 he\r\nowned only 9; and in 1872, only 6. In 1867 the stock sold for $6500 per\r\nshare, and his last sale was for $9600. He bought wild lands, took stock\r\nin mining companies, desiccated egg companies, patent looms,\r\nphoto-lithographic companies, gave away profusely, lent to plausible\r\nrascals, and was the ready prey of every new inventor who chanced to\r\nfind him with money or with property that he could readily convert into\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nIn September 1841 Greeley merged his weekly papers, _The Log Cabin_ and\r\n_The New Yorker_, into _The Weekly Tribune_, which soon attained as wide\r\ncirculation as its predecessors, and was much more profitable. It rose\r\nin a time of great political excitement to a total circulation of a\r\nquarter of a million, and it sometimes had for successive years 140,000\r\nto 150,000. For several years it was rarely much below 100,000. Its\r\nsubscribers were found throughout all quarters of the northern half of\r\nthe Union from Maine to Oregon, large packages going to remote districts\r\nbeyond the Mississippi or Missouri, whose only connexion with the\r\noutside world was through a weekly or semi-weekly mail. The readers of\r\nthis weekly paper acquired a personal affection for its editor, and he\r\nwas thus for many years the American writer most widely known and most\r\npopular among the rural classes. The circulation of _The Daily Tribune_\r\nwas never proportionately great--its advocacy of a protective tariff,\r\nprohibitory liquor legislation and other peculiarities, repelling a\r\nlarge support which it might otherwise have commanded in New York. It\r\nrose within a short time after its establishment to a circulation of\r\n20,000, reached 50,000 and 60,000 during the Civil War, and thereafter\r\nranged at from 30,000 to 45,000. After May 1845 a semi-weekly edition\r\nwas also printed, which ultimately reached a steady circulation of from\r\n15,000 to 25,000.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset it was a cardinal principle with Greeley to hear all\r\nsides, and to extend a special hospitality to new ideas. In March 1842\r\n_The Tribune_ began to give one column daily to a discussion of the\r\ndoctrines of Charles Fourier, contributed by Albert Brisbane. Gradually\r\nGreeley came to advocate some of these doctrines editorially. In 1846 he\r\nhad a sharp discussion upon them with a former subordinate, Henry J.\r\nRaymond, then employed upon a rival journal. It continued through twelve\r\narticles on each side, and was subsequently published in book form.\r\nGreeley became personally interested in one of the Fourierite\r\nassociations, the North American Phalanx, at Red Bank, N. J.\r\n(1843-1855), while the influence of his discussions doubtless led to or\r\ngave encouragement to other socialistic experiments, such as that at\r\nBrook Farm. When this was abandoned, its leader George Ripley, with one\r\nor two other members, sought employment from Greeley upon _The Tribune_.\r\nGreeley dissented from many of Fourier's propositions, and in later\r\nyears was careful to explain that the principle of association for the\r\ncommon good of working men and the elevation of labour was the chief\r\nfeature which attracted him. Co-operation among working men he continued\r\nto urge throughout his life. In 1850 the Fox Sisters, on his wife's\r\ninvitation, spent several weeks in his house. His attitude towards their\r\n\"rappings\" and \"spiritual manifestations\" was one of observation and\r\ninquiry; and in his _Recollections_ he wrote concerning these\r\nmanifestations: \"That some of them are the result of juggle, collusion\r\nor trick I am confident; that others are _not_, I decidedly believe.\"\r\n\r\nFrom boyhood he had believed in a protective tariff, and throughout his\r\nactive life he was its most trenchant advocate and propagandist. Besides\r\nconstantly urging it in the columns of _The Tribune_, he appeared as\r\nearly as 1843 in a public debate on \"The Grounds of Protection,\" with\r\nSamuel J. Tilden and Parke Godwin as his opponents. A series of popular\r\nessays on the subject were published over his own signature in _The\r\nTribune_ in 1869, and subsequently republished in book form, with a\r\ntitle-page describing protection to home industry as a system of\r\nnational co-operation for the elevation of labour. He opposed woman\r\nsuffrage on the ground that the majority of women did not want it and\r\nnever would, and declared that until woman should \"emancipate herself\r\nfrom the thraldom to etiquette,\" he \"could not see how the 'woman's\r\nrights theory' is ever to be anything more than a logically defensible\r\nabstraction.\" He aided practical efforts, however, for extending the\r\nsphere of woman's employments. He opposed the theatres, and for a time\r\nrefused to publish their advertisements. He held the most rigid views on\r\nthe sanctity of marriage and against easy divorce, and vehemently\r\ndefended them in controversies with Robert Dale Owen and others. He\r\npractised and pertinaciously advocated total abstinence from spirituous\r\nliquors, but did not regard prohibitory laws as always wise. He\r\ndenounced the repudiation of state debts or the failure to pay interest\r\non them. He was zealous for Irish repeal, once held a place in the\r\n\"Directory of the Friends of Ireland,\" and contributed liberally to its\r\nsupport. He used the occasion of Charles Dickens's first visit to\r\nAmerica to urge international copyright, and was one of the few editors\r\nto avoid alike the flunkeyism with which Dickens was first received, and\r\nthe ferocity with which he was assailed after the publication of his\r\n_American Notes_. On the occasion of Dickens's second visit to America,\r\nGreeley presided at the great banquet given him by the press of the\r\ncountry. He made the first elaborate reports of popular scientific\r\nlectures by Louis Agassiz and other authorities. He gave ample hearing\r\nto the advocates of phonography and of phonographic spelling. He was one\r\nof the most conspicuous advocates of the Pacific railroads, and of many\r\nother internal improvements.\r\n\r\nBut it is as an anti-slavery leader, and as perhaps the chief agency in\r\neducating the mass of the Northern people to that opposition through\r\nlegal forms to the extension of slavery which culminated in the election\r\nof Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War, that Greeley's main work was done.\r\nIncidents in it were his vehement opposition to the Mexican War as a\r\nscheme for more slavery territory, the assault made upon him in\r\nWashington by Congressman Albert Rust of Arkansas in 1856, an indictment\r\nin Virginia in the same year for circulating incendiary documents,\r\nperpetual denunciation of him in Southern newspapers and speeches, and\r\nthe hostility of the Abolitionists, who regarded his course as too\r\nconservative. His anti-slavery work culminated in his appeal to\r\nPresident Lincoln, entitled \"The Prayer of Twenty Millions,\" in which he\r\nurged \"that all attempts to put down the rebellion and at the same time\r\nuphold its inciting cause\" were preposterous and futile, and that \"every\r\nhour of deference to slavery\" was \"an hour of added and deepened peril\r\nto the Union.\" President Lincoln in his reply said: \"My paramount object\r\nis to save the Union, and not either to save or destroy slavery.... What\r\nI do about slavery and the coloured race, I do because I believe it\r\nhelps to save this Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not\r\nbelieve it would help to save the Union ... I have here stated my\r\npurpose according to my views of official duty; and I intend no\r\nmodification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere\r\ncould be free.\" Precisely one month after the date of this reply the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation was issued.\r\n\r\nGreeley's political activity, first as a Whig, and then as one of the\r\nfounders of the Republican party, was incessant; but he held few\r\noffices. In 1848-1849 he served a three months' term in Congress,\r\nfilling a vacancy. He introduced the first bill for giving small tracts\r\nof government land free to actual settlers, and published an exposure of\r\nabuses in the allowance of mileage to members, which corrected the evil,\r\nbut brought him much personal obloquy. In the National Republican\r\nConvention in 1860, not being sent by the Republicans of his own state\r\non account of his opposition to William Seward as a candidate, he was\r\nmade a delegate for Oregon. His active hostility to Seward did much to\r\nprevent the success of that statesman, and to bring about instead the\r\nnomination of Abraham Lincoln. This was attributed by his opponents to\r\npersonal motives, and a letter from Greeley to Seward, the publication\r\nof which he challenged, was produced, to show that in his struggling\r\ndays he had been wounded at Seward's failure to offer him office. In\r\n1861 he was a candidate for United States senator, his principal\r\nopponent being William M. Evarts. When it was clear that Evarts could\r\nnot be elected, his supporters threw their votes for a third candidate,\r\nIra Harris, who was thus chosen over Greeley by a small majority. At the\r\noutbreak of the war he favoured allowing the Southern states to secede,\r\nprovided a majority of their people at a fair election should so decide,\r\ndeclaring \"that he hoped never to live in a Republic whereof one section\r\nwas pinned to the other by bayonets.\" When the war began he urged the\r\nmost vigorous prosecution of it. The \"On to Richmond\" appeal, which\r\nappeared day after day in _The Tribune_, was incorrectly attributed to\r\nhim, and it did not wholly meet his approval; but after the defeat in\r\nthe first battle of Bull Run he was widely blamed for it. In 1864 he\r\nurged negotiations for peace with representatives of the Southern\r\nConfederacy in Canada, and was sent by President Lincoln to confer with\r\nthem. They were found to have no sufficient authority. In 1864 he was\r\none of the Lincoln Presidential electors for New York. At the close of\r\nthe war, contrary to the general feeling of his party, he urged\r\nuniversal amnesty and impartial suffrage as the basis of reconstruction.\r\nIn 1867 his friends again wished to elect him to the Senate of the\r\nUnited States, and the indications were all in his favour. But he\r\nrefused to be elected under any misapprehension of his attitude, and\r\nwith what his friends thought unnecessary candour re-stated his\r\nobnoxious views on universal amnesty at length, just before the time for\r\nthe election, with the certainty that this would prevent his success.\r\nSome months later he signed the bail bond of Jefferson Davis, and this\r\nprovoked a torrent of public indignation. He had written a popular\r\nhistory of the late war, the first volume having an immense sale and\r\nbringing him unusually large profits. The second was just issued, and\r\nthe subscribers, in their anger, refused by thousands to receive it. An\r\nunsuccessful attempt was also made to expel him from the Union League\r\nClub of New York.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 he was a delegate-at-large to the convention for the revision of\r\nthe state constitution, and in 1869 and 1870 he was the Republican\r\ncandidate for controller of the state and member of Congress\r\nrespectively, but in each case was defeated.\r\n\r\nHe was dissatisfied with General Grant's administration, and became its\r\nsharp critic. The discontent which he did much to develop ended in the\r\norganization of the Liberal Republican party, which held its National\r\nConvention at Cincinnati in 1872, and nominated Greeley for the\r\npresidency. For a time the tide of feeling ran strongly in his favour.\r\nIt was first checked by the action of his life-long opponents, the\r\nDemocrats, who also nominated him at their National Convention. He\r\nexpected their support, on account of his attitude toward the South and\r\nhostility to Grant, but he thought it a mistake to give him their formal\r\nnomination. The event proved his wisdom. Many Republicans who had\r\nsympathized with his criticisms of the administration, and with the\r\ndeclaration of principles adopted at the first convention, were repelled\r\nby the coalition. This feeling grew stronger until the election. His old\r\nparty associates regarded him as a renegade, the Democrats gave him a\r\nhalf-hearted support. The tone of the canvass was one of unusual\r\nbitterness, amounting sometimes to actual ferocity. In August, on\r\nrepresentations of the alarming state of the contest, he took the field\r\nin person, and made a series of campaign speeches, beginning in New\r\nEngland and extending throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana, which\r\naroused great enthusiasm, and were regarded at the time by both friends\r\nand opponents as the most brilliant continuous exhibition of varied\r\nintellectual power ever made by a candidate in a presidential canvass.\r\nGeneral Grant received in the election 3,597,070 votes, Greeley\r\n2,834,079. The only states Greeley carried were Georgia, Kentucky,\r\nMaryland, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas.\r\n\r\nHe had resigned his editorship of _The Tribune_ immediately after the\r\nnomination; he now resumed it cheerfully; but it was soon apparent that\r\nhis powers had been overstrained. For years he had suffered greatly from\r\nsleeplessness. During the intense excitement of the campaign the\r\ndifficulty was increased. Returning from his campaign tour, he went\r\nimmediately to the bedside of his dying wife, and for some weeks had\r\npractically no sleep at all. This resulted in an inflammation of the\r\nupper membrane of the brain, delirium and death. He expired on the 29th\r\nof November 1872. His funeral was a simple but impressive public\r\npageant. The body lay in state in the City Hall, where it was surrounded\r\nby crowds of many thousands. The ceremonies were attended by the\r\nPresident and Vice-President of the United States, the Chief-Justice of\r\nthe Supreme Court, and a large number of eminent public men of both\r\nparties, who followed the hearse in a solemn procession, preceded by the\r\nmayor and other civic authorities, down Broadway. He had been the target\r\nof constant attack during his life, and his personal foibles, careless\r\ndress and mental eccentricities were the theme of endless ridicule. But\r\nhis death revealed the high regard in which he was generally held as a\r\nleader of opinion and faithful public servant. \"Our later Franklin\"\r\nWhittier called him, and it is in some such light his countrymen\r\nremember him.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Greeley visited Europe for the first time, serving as a juryman\r\nat the Crystal Palace Exhibition, appearing before a committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons on newspaper taxes, and urging the repeal of the stamp\r\nduty on advertisements. In 1855 he made a second trip to Europe. In\r\nParis he was arrested on the suit of a sculptor, whose statue had been\r\ninjured in the New York World's Fair (of which he had been a director),\r\nand spent two days in Clichy, of which he gave an amusing account. In\r\n1859 he visited California by the overland route, and had numerous\r\npublic receptions. In 1871 he visited Texas, and his trip through the\r\nsouthern country, where he had once been so hated, was an ovation. About\r\n1852 he purchased a farm at Chappaqua, New York, where he afterwards\r\nhabitually spent his Saturdays, and experimented in agriculture. He was\r\nin constant demand as a lecturer from 1843, when he made his first\r\nappearance on the platform, always drew large audiences, and, in spite\r\nof his bad management in money matters, received considerable sums,\r\nsometimes $6000 or $7000 for a single winter's lecturing. He was also\r\nmuch sought for as a contributor, over his own signature, to the weekly\r\nnewspapers, and was sometimes largely paid for these articles. In\r\nreligious faith he was from boyhood a Universalist, and for many years\r\nwas a conspicuous member of the leading Universalist church in New York.\r\n\r\nHis published works are: _Hints Toward Reforms_ (1850); _Glances at\r\nEurope_ (1851); _History of the Struggle for Slavery Extension_ (1856);\r\n_Overland Journey to San Francisco_ (1860); _The American Conflict_ (2\r\nvols., 1864-1866); _Recollections of a Busy Life_ (1868; new edition,\r\nwith appendix containing an account of his later years, his argument\r\nwith Robert Dale Owen on Marriage and Divorce, and Miscellanies, 1873);\r\n_Essays on Political Economy_ (1870); and _What I know of Farming_\r\n(1871). He also assisted his brother-in-law, John F. Cleveland, in\r\nediting _A Political Text-book_ (1860), and supervised for many years\r\nthe annual issues of _The Whig Almanac_ and _The Tribune Almanac_,\r\ncomprising extensive political statistics.\r\n\r\n  The best Lives of Greeley are those by James Parton (New York, 1855;\r\n  new ed., Boston, 1872) and W. A. Linn (N.Y. 1903). Lives have also\r\n  been written by L. U. Reavis (New York, 1872), and L. D. Ingersoll\r\n  (Chicago, 1873); and there is a _Memorial of Horace Greeley_ (New\r\n  York, 1873).     (W. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREELEY, a city and the county-seat of Weld county, Colorado, U.S.A.,\r\nabout 50 m. N. by E. of Denver. Pop. (1890) 2395; (1900) 3023 (286\r\nforeign-born); (1910) 8179. It is served by the Union Pacific and the\r\nColorado & Southern railways. In 1908 a franchise was granted to the\r\nDenver & Greeley Electric railway. The city is the seat of the State\r\nNormal School of Colorado (1889). There are rich coal-fields near the\r\ncity. The county is naturally arid and unproductive, and its\r\nagricultural importance is due to an elaborate system of irrigation. In\r\n1899 Weld county had under irrigation 226,613 acres, representing an\r\nincrease of 102.2% since 1889, and a much larger irrigated area than in\r\nany other county of the state. Irrigation ditches are supplied with\r\nwater chiefly from the Cache la Poudre, Big Thompson and South Platte\r\nrivers, near the foothills. The principal crops are potatoes, sugar\r\nbeets, onions, cabbages and peas; in 1899 Weld county raised 2,821,285\r\nbushels of potatoes on 23,195 acres (53% of the potato acreage for the\r\nentire state). The manufacture of beet sugar is a growing industry, a\r\nlarge factory having been established at Greeley in 1902. Beets are also\r\ngrown as food for live stock, especially sheep. Peas, tomatoes, cabbages\r\nand onions are canned here. Greeley was founded in 1870 by Nathan Cook\r\nMeeker (1817-1879), agricultural editor of the New York _Tribune_. With\r\nthe support of Horace Greeley (in whose honour the town was named), he\r\nbegan in 1869 to advocate in _The Tribune_ the founding of an\r\nagricultural colony in Colorado. Subsequently President Hayes appointed\r\nhim Indian agent at White River, Colorado, and he was killed at what is\r\nnow Meeker, Colorado, in an uprising of the Ute Indians. Under Meeker's\r\nscheme, which attracted mainly people from New England and New York\r\nstate, most of whom were able to contribute at least a little capital,\r\nthe Union Colony of Colorado was organized and chartered, and bought\r\noriginally 11,000 acres of land, each member being entitled to buy from\r\nit one residence lot, one business lot, and a tract of farm land. The\r\nfunds thus acquired were, to a large extent, expended in making public\r\nimprovements. A clause inserted in all deeds forbade the sale of\r\nintoxicating liquors on the land concerned, under pain of the reversion\r\nof such property to the colony. The initiation fees ($5) were used for\r\nthe expenses of locating the colony, and the membership certificate fees\r\n($150) were expended in the construction of irrigating ditches, as was\r\nthe money received from the sale of town lots, except about $13,000\r\ninvested in a school building (now the Meeker Building). Greeley was\r\norganized as a town in 1871, and was chartered as a city of the second\r\nclass in 1886. The \"Union Colony of Colorado\" still exists as an\r\nincorporated body and holds reversionary rights in streets, alleys and\r\npublic grounds, and in all places \"where intoxicating liquors are\r\nmanufactured, sold or given away, as a beverage.\"\r\n\r\n  See Richard T. Ely, \"A Study of a 'Decreed' Town,\" _Harper's\r\n  Magazine_, vol. 106 (1902-1903), p. 390 sqq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN, ALEXANDER HENRY (1832-1896), English geologist, son of the Rev.\r\nThomas Sheldon Green, master of the Ashby Grammar School, was born at\r\nMaidstone on the 10th of October 1832. He was educated partly at his\r\nfather's school, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and afterwards at Gonville and Caius\r\nCollege, Cambridge, where he graduated as sixth wrangler in 1855 and was\r\nelected a fellow of his college. In 1861 he joined the Geological Survey\r\nof Great Britain, and surveyed large areas of the midland counties,\r\nDerbyshire and Yorkshire. He wrote (wholly or in part) memoirs on the\r\nGeology of Banbury (1864), of Stockport (1866), of North Derbyshire\r\n(1869, 2nd ed. 1887), and of the Yorkshire Coal-field (1878). In 1874 he\r\nretired from the Geological Survey, having been appointed professor of\r\ngeology in the Yorkshire College at Leeds; in 1885 he became also\r\nprofessor of mathematics, while for many years he held the lectureship\r\non geology at the school of military engineering at Chatham. He was\r\nelected F.R.S. in 1886, and two years later was chosen professor of\r\ngeology in the university of Oxford. His manual of _Physical Geology_\r\n(1876, 3rd ed. 1882) is an excellent book. He died at Boar's Hill,\r\nOxford, on the 19th of August 1896.\r\n\r\n  A portrait of him, with brief memoir, was published in _Proc. Yorksh.\r\n  Geol. and Polytechnic Soc._ xiii. 232.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN, DUFF (1791-1875), American politician and journalist, was born in\r\nWoodford county, Kentucky, on the 15th of August 1791. He was a school\r\nteacher in his native state, served during the War of 1812 in the\r\nKentucky militia, and then settled in Missouri, where he worked as a\r\nschoolmaster and practised law. He was a member of the Missouri\r\nConstitutional Convention of 1820, and was elected to the state House of\r\nRepresentatives in 1820 and to the state Senate in 1822, serving one\r\nterm in each house. Becoming interested in journalism, he purchased and\r\nfor two years edited the St Louis _Enquirer_. In 1825 he bought and\r\nafterwards edited in Washington, D.C., _The United States Telegraph_,\r\nwhich soon became the principal organ of the Jackson men in opposition\r\nto the Adams administration. Upon Andrew Jackson's election to the\r\npresidency, the _Telegraph_ became the principal mouthpiece of the\r\nadministration, and received printing patronage estimated in value at\r\n$50,000 a year, while Green became one of the coterie of unofficial\r\nadvisers of Jackson known as the \"Kitchen Cabinet.\" In the quarrel\r\nbetween Jackson and John C. Calhoun, Green supported the latter, and\r\nthrough the columns of the _Telegraph_ violently attacked the\r\nadministration. In consequence, his paper was deprived of the government\r\nprinting in the spring of 1831. Green, however, continued to edit it in\r\nthe Calhoun interest until 1835, and gave vigorous support to that\r\nleader's nullification views. From 1835 to 1838 he edited _The\r\nReformation_, a radically partisan publication, devoted to free trade\r\nand the extreme states' rights theory. In 1841-1843 he was in Europe on\r\nbehalf of the Tyler administration, and he is said to have been\r\ninstrumental in causing the appointment of Lord Ashburton to negotiate\r\nin Washington concerning the boundary dispute between Maine and Canada.\r\nIn January 1843 Green established in New York City a short-lived\r\njournal, _The Republic_, to combat the spoils system and to advocate\r\nfree trade. In September 1844 Calhoun, then secretary of state, sent\r\nGreen to Texas ostensibly as consul at Galveston, but actually, it\r\nappears, to report to the administration, then considering the question\r\nof the annexation of Texas, concerning the political situation in Texas\r\nand Mexico. After the close of the war with Mexico Green was sent to\r\nthat country in 1849 by President Taylor to negotiate concerning the\r\nmoneys which, by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United States had\r\nagreed to pay; and he saved his country a considerable sum by arranging\r\nfor payment in exchange instead of in specie. Subsequently Green was\r\nengaged in railway building in Georgia and Alabama. On the 10th of June\r\n1875 he died in Dalton, Georgia, a city which in 1848 he had helped to\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN, JOHN RICHARD (1837-1883), English historian, was born at Oxford\r\non 12th December 1837, and educated at Magdalen College School and at\r\nJesus College, where he obtained an open scholarship. On leaving Oxford\r\nhe took orders and became the incumbent of St Philip's, Stepney. His\r\npreaching was eloquent and able; he worked diligently among his poor\r\nparishioners and won their affection by his ready sympathy. Meanwhile he\r\nstudied history in a scholarly fashion, and wrote much for the _Saturday\r\nReview_. Partly because his health was weak and partly because he ceased\r\nto agree with the teaching of the Church of England, he abandoned\r\nclerical life and devoted himself to history; in 1868 he took the post\r\nof librarian at Lambeth, but his health was already breaking down and he\r\nwas attacked by consumption. His _Short History of the English People_\r\n(1874) at once attained extraordinary popularity, and was afterwards\r\nexpanded in a work of four volumes (1877-1880). Green is pre-eminently a\r\npicturesque historian; he had a vivid imagination and a keen eye for\r\ncolour. His chief aim was to depict the progressive life of the English\r\npeople rather than to write a political history of the English state. In\r\naccomplishing this aim he worked up the results of wide reading into a\r\nseries of brilliant pictures. While generally accurate in his statement\r\nof facts, and showing a firm grasp of the main tendency of a period, he\r\noften builds more on his authorities than is warranted by their words,\r\nand is apt to overlook points which would have forced him to modify his\r\nrepresentations and lower the tone of his colours. From his animated\r\npages thousands have learned to take pleasure in the history of their\r\nown people, but could scarcely learn to appreciate the complexity\r\ninherent in all historical movement. His style is extremely bright, but\r\nit lacks sobriety and presents some affectations. His later histories,\r\n_The Making of England_ (1882) and _The Conquest of England_ (1883), are\r\nmore soberly written than his earlier books, and are valuable\r\ncontributions to historical knowledge. Green died at Mentone on the 7th\r\nof March 1883. He was a singularly attractive man, of wide intellectual\r\nsympathies and an enthusiastic temperament; his good-humour was\r\nunfailing and he was a brilliant talker; and his work was done with\r\nadmirable courage in spite of ill-health. It is said that Mrs Humphry\r\nWard's _Robert Elsmere_ is largely a portrait of him. In 1877 Green\r\nmarried Miss Alice Stopford; and Mrs Green, besides writing a memoir of\r\nher husband, prefixed to the 1888 edition of his _Short History_, has\r\nherself done valuable work as an historian, particularly in her _Henry\r\nII._ in the \"English Statesmen\" series (1888), her _Town Life in the\r\n15th Century_ (1894), and _The Making of Ireland and its Undoing_\r\n(1908).\r\n\r\n  See the _Letters of J. R. Green_ (1901), edited by Leslie Stephen.\r\n       (W. Hu.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN, MATTHEW (1696-1737), English poet, was born of Nonconformist\r\nparents. He had a post in the custom house, and the few anecdotes that\r\nhave been preserved of him show him to have been as witty as his poems\r\nwould lead one to expect. He died unmarried at his lodging in Nag's Head\r\nCourt, Gracechurch Street, in 1737. His _Grotto_, a poem on Queen\r\nCaroline's grotto at Richmond, was printed in 1732; and his chief poem,\r\n_The Spleen_, in 1737 with a preface by his friend Richard Glover. These\r\nand some other short poems were printed in Dodsley's collection (1748),\r\nand subsequently in various editions of the British poets. They were\r\nedited In 1796 with a preface by Dr Aikin and in 1883 by R. E. A.\r\nWillmott with the poems of Gray and others. _The Spleen_ is an epistle\r\nto Mr Cuthbert Jackson, advocating cheerfulness, exercise and a quiet\r\ncontent as remedies. It is full of witty sayings. Thomas Gray said of\r\nit: \"There is a profusion of wit everywhere; reading would have formed\r\nhis judgment, and harmonized his verse, for even his wood-notes often\r\nbreak out into strains of real poetry and music.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN, THOMAS HILL (1836-1882), English philosopher, the most typical\r\nEnglish representative of the school of thought called _Neo-Kantian_, or\r\n_Neo-Hegelian_, was born on the 7th of April 1836 at Birkin, a village\r\nin the West Riding of Yorkshire, of which his father was rector. On the\r\npaternal side he was descended from Oliver Cromwell, whose honest,\r\nsturdy independence of character he seemed to have inherited. His\r\neducation was conducted entirely at home until, at the age of fourteen,\r\nhe entered Rugby, where he remained five years. In 1855 he became an\r\nundergraduate member of Balliol College, Oxford, of which society he\r\nwas, in 1860, elected fellow. His life henceforth, was devoted to\r\nteaching (mainly philosophical) in the university--first as college\r\ntutor, afterwards, from 1878 until his death (at Oxford on the 26th of\r\nMarch 1882) as Whyte's Professor of Moral Philosophy. The lectures he\r\ndelivered as professor form the substance of his two most important\r\nworks, viz. the _Prolegomena to Ethics_ and the _Lectures on the\r\nPrinciples of Political Obligation_, which contain the whole of his\r\npositive constructive teaching. These works were not published until\r\nafter his death, but Green's views were previously known indirectly\r\nthrough the _Introduction_ to the standard edition of Hume's works by\r\nGreen and T. H. Grose (d. 1906), fellow of Queen's College, in which the\r\ndoctrine of the \"English\" or \"empirical\" philosophy was exhaustively\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nHume's empiricism, combined with a belief in biological evolution\r\n(derived from Herbert Spencer), was the chief feature in English thought\r\nduring the third quarter of the 19th century. Green represents primarily\r\nthe reaction against doctrines which, when carried out to their logical\r\nconclusion, not only \"rendered all philosophy futile,\" but were fatal to\r\npractical life. By reducing the human mind to a series of unrelated\r\natomic sensations, this teaching destroyed the possibility of knowledge,\r\nand further, by representing man as a \"being who is simply the result of\r\nnatural forces,\" it made conduct, or any theory of conduct, unmeaning;\r\nfor life in any human, intelligible sense implies a personal self which\r\n(1) _knows_ what to do, (2) has _power_ to do it. Green was thus driven,\r\nnot theoretically, but as a practical necessity, to raise again the\r\nwhole question of man in relation to nature. When (he held) we have\r\ndiscovered what man in himself is, and what his relation to his\r\nenvironment, we shall then know his function--what he is fitted to do.\r\nIn the light of this knowledge we shall be able to formulate the moral\r\ncode, which, in turn, will serve as a criterion of actual civic and\r\nsocial institutions. These form, naturally and necessarily, the\r\nobjective expression of moral ideas, and it is in some civic or social\r\nwhole that the moral ideal must finally take concrete shape.\r\n\r\nTo ask \"What is man?\" is to ask \"What is experience?\" for experience\r\nmeans that of which I am conscious. The facts of consciousness are the\r\nonly facts which, to begin with, we are justified in asserting to exist.\r\nOn the other hand, they are valid evidence for whatever is necessary to\r\ntheir own explanation, i.e. for whatever is logically involved in them.\r\nNow the most striking characteristic of man, that in fact which marks him\r\nspecially, as contrasted with other animals, is _self_-consciousness. The\r\nsimplest mental act into which we can analyse the operations of the human\r\nmind--the act of sense-perception--is never merely a _change_, physical\r\nor psychical, but is the _consciousness_ of a change. Human experience\r\nconsists, not of processes in an animal organism, but of these processes\r\nrecognized as such. That which we perceive is from the outset an\r\napprehended fact--that is to say, it cannot be analysed into isolated\r\nelements (so-called sensations) which, as such, are not constituents of\r\nconsciousness at all, but exists from the first as a synthesis of\r\nrelations in a consciousness which keeps distinct the \"self\" and the\r\nvarious elements of the \"object,\" though holding all together in the\r\nunity of the act of perception. In other words, the whole mental\r\nstructure we call knowledge consists, in its simplest equally with its\r\nmost complex constituents, of the \"work of the mind.\" Locke and Hume held\r\nthat the work of the mind was _eo ipso_ unreal because it was \"made by\"\r\nman and not \"given to\" man. It thus represented a subjective creation,\r\nnot an objective fact. But this consequence follows only upon the\r\nassumption that the work of the mind is arbitrary, an assumption shown to\r\nbe unjustified by the results of exact science, with the distinction,\r\nuniversally recognized, which such science draws between truth and\r\nfalsehood, between the real and \"mere ideas.\" This (obviously valid)\r\ndistinction logically involves the consequence that the object, or\r\ncontent, of knowledge, viz. reality, is an intelligible ideal reality, a\r\nsystem of thought relations, a spiritual cosmos. How is the existence of\r\nthis ideal whole to be accounted for? Only by the existence of some\r\n\"principle which renders all relations possible and is itself determined\r\nby none of them\"; an eternal self-consciousness which knows in whole what\r\nwe know in part. To God the world _is_, to man the world _becomes_. Human\r\nexperience is God gradually made manifest.\r\n\r\nCarrying on the same analytical method into the special department of\r\nmoral philosophy, Green held that ethics applies to the peculiar\r\nconditions of social life that investigation into man's nature which\r\nmetaphysics began. The faculty employed in this further investigation is\r\nno \"separate moral faculty,\" but that same reason which is the source of\r\nall our knowledge--ethical and other. Self-reflection gradually reveals\r\nto us human capacity, human function, with, consequently, human\r\nresponsibility. It brings out into clear consciousness certain\r\npotentialities in the realization of which man's true good must consist.\r\nAs the result of this analysis, combined with an investigation into the\r\nsurroundings man lives in, a \"content\"--a moral code--becomes gradually\r\nevolved. Personal good is perceived to be realizable only by making\r\nactual the conceptions thus arrived at. So long as these remain\r\npotential or ideal, they form the motive of action; motive consisting\r\nalways in the idea of some \"end\" or \"good\" which man presents to himself\r\nas an end in the attainment of which he would be satisfied, that is, in\r\nthe realization of which he would find his true self. The determination\r\nto realize the self in some definite way constitutes an \"act of will,\"\r\nwhich, as thus constituted, is neither arbitrary nor externally\r\ndetermined. For the motive which may be said to be its cause lies _in_\r\nthe man himself, and the identification of the self with such a motive\r\nis a _self_-determination, which is at once both rational and free. The\r\n\"freedom of man\" is constituted, not by a supposed ability to do\r\nanything he may choose, but in the power to identify himself with that\r\ntrue good which reason reveals to him as _his_ true good. This good\r\nconsists in the realization of personal character; hence the final good,\r\ni.e. the moral ideal, as a whole, can be realized only in some society\r\nof persons who, while remaining ends to themselves in the sense that\r\ntheir individuality is not lost but rendered more perfect, find this\r\nperfection attainable only when the separate individualities are\r\nintegrated as part of a social whole. Society is as necessary to form\r\npersons as persons are to constitute society. Social union is the\r\nindispensable condition of the development of the special capacities of\r\nthe individual members. Human self-perfection cannot be gained in\r\nisolation; it is attainable only in inter-relation with fellow-citizens\r\nin the social community.\r\n\r\nThe law of our being, so revealed, involves in its turn civic or\r\npolitical duties. Moral goodness cannot be limited to, still less\r\nconstituted by, the cultivation of self-regarding virtues, but consists\r\nin the attempt to realize in practice that moral ideal which\r\nself-analysis has revealed to us as _our_ ideal. From this fact arises\r\nthe ground of political obligation, for the institutions of political or\r\ncivic life are the concrete embodiment of moral ideas in terms of our\r\nday and generation. But, as society exists only for the proper\r\ndevelopment of persons, we have a criterion by which to test these\r\ninstitutions, viz. do they, or do they not, contribute to the\r\ndevelopment of moral character in the individual citizens? It is obvious\r\nthat the final moral ideal is not realized in any body of civic\r\ninstitutions actually existing, but the same analysis which demonstrates\r\nthis deficiency points out the direction which a true development will\r\ntake. Hence arises the conception of rights and duties which _should_\r\nbe maintained by law, as opposed to those actually maintained; with the\r\nfurther consequence that it may become occasionally a moral duty to\r\nrebel against the state in the interest of the state itself, that is, in\r\norder better to subserve that end or function which constitutes the\r\n_raison d'etre_ of the state. The state does not consist in any definite\r\nconcrete organization formed once for all. It represents a \"general\r\nwill\" which is a desire for a common good. Its basis is not a coercive\r\nauthority imposed upon the citizens from without, but consists in the\r\nspiritual recognition, on the part of the citizens, of that which\r\nconstitutes their true nature. \"Will, not force, is the basis of the\r\nstate.\"\r\n\r\n  Green's teaching was, directly and indirectly, the most potent\r\n  philosophical influence in England during the last quarter of the 19th\r\n  century, while his enthusiasm for a common citizenship, and his\r\n  personal example in practical municipal life, inspired much of the\r\n  effort made, in the years succeeding his death, to bring the\r\n  universities more into touch with the people, and to break down the\r\n  rigour of class distinctions.\r\n\r\n  Of his philosophical doctrine proper, the most striking characteristic\r\n  is Integration, as opposed to Disintegration, both in thought and in\r\n  reality. \"That which is\" is a _whole_, not an _aggregate_; an organic\r\n  complex of parts, not a mechanical mass; a \"whole\" too not material\r\n  but spiritual, a \"world of thought-relations.\" On the critical side\r\n  this teaching is now admittedly valid against the older empiricism,\r\n  and the cogency of the reasoning by which his constructive theory is\r\n  supported is generally recognized. Nevertheless, Green's statement of\r\n  his conclusions presents important difficulties. Even apart from the\r\n  impossibility of conceiving a whole of relations which are relations\r\n  and nothing else (this objection is perhaps largely verbal), no\r\n  explanation is given of the fact (obvious in experience) that the\r\n  spiritual entities of which the Universe is composed _appear_\r\n  material. Certain elements present themselves in feeling which seem\r\n  stubbornly to resist any attempt to explain them in terms of thought.\r\n  While, again, legitimately insisting upon personality as a fundamental\r\n  constituent in any true theory of reality, the relation between human\r\n  individualities and the divine Person is left vague and obscure; nor\r\n  is it easy to see how the existence of several individualities--human\r\n  or divine--in one cosmos is theoretically possible. It is at the\r\n  solution of these two questions that philosophy in the immediate\r\n  future may be expected to work.\r\n\r\n  Green's most important treatise--the _Prolegomena to\r\n  Ethics_--practically complete in manuscript at his death--was\r\n  published in the year following, under the editorship of A. C. Bradley\r\n  (4th ed., 1899). Shortly afterwards R. L. Nettleship's standard\r\n  edition of his _Works_ (exclusive of the _Prolegomena_) appeared in\r\n  three volumes: vol. i. containing reprints of Green's criticism of\r\n  Hume, Spencer, Lewes; vol. ii. Lectures on Kant, on Logic, on the\r\n  Principles of Political Obligation; vol. iii. Miscellanies, preceded\r\n  by a full _Memoir_ by the Editor. The _Principles of Political\r\n  Obligation_ was afterwards published in separate form. A criticism of\r\n  _Neo-Hegelianism_ will be found in Andrew Seth (Pringle Pattison),\r\n  _Hegelianism and Personality_. See also articles in _Mind_ (January\r\n  and April 1884) by A. J. Balfour and Henry Sidgwick, in the _Academy_\r\n  (xxviii. 242 and xxv. 297) by S. Alexander, and in the _Philosophical\r\n  Review_ (vi., 1897) by S. S. Laurie; W. H.

In 1765 he migrated to London and began work\r\nas a mezzotint engraver, having taught himself the technicalities of\r\nthis art, and quickly rose to a position in absolutely the front rank of\r\nBritish engravers. He became a member of the Incorporated Society of\r\nArtists in 1767, an associate-engraver of the Royal Academy in 1775, and\r\nfor some forty years he followed his profession with the greatest\r\nsuccess. The exclusive right of engraving and publishing plates from the\r\npictures in the Dusseldorf gallery was granted him by the duke of\r\nBavaria in 1789, but, after he had issued more than twenty of these\r\nplates, the siege of that city by the French put an end to this\r\nundertaking and caused him serious financial loss. From this cause, and\r\nthrough the failure of certain other speculations, he was reduced to\r\npoverty; and in consequence he took the post of keeper of the British\r\nInstitution in 1805, and continued in this office for the remainder of\r\nhis life. During his career as an engraver he produced some four hundred\r\nplates after portraits by Reynolds, Romney, and other British artists,\r\nafter the compositions of Benjamin West, and after pictures by Van Dyck,\r\nRubens, Murillo, and other old masters. It is claimed for him that he\r\nwas one of the first engravers to show how admirably mezzotint could be\r\napplied to the translation of pictorial compositions as well as\r\nportraits, but at the present time it is to his portraits that most\r\nattention is given by collectors. His engravings are distinguished by\r\nexceptional richness and subtlety of tone, and by very judicious\r\nmanagement of relations of light and shade; and they have, almost\r\nwithout exception, notable freshness and grace of handling.\r\n\r\n  See _Valentine Green_, by Alfred Whitman (London, 1902).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN, WILLIAM HENRY (1825-1900), American Hebrew scholar, was born in\r\nGroveville, near Bordentown, New Jersey, on the 27th of January 1825. He\r\nwas descended in the sixth generation from Jonathan Dickinson, first\r\npresident of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), and\r\nhis ancestors had been closely connected with the Presbyterian church.\r\nHe graduated in 1840 from Lafayette College, where he was tutor in\r\nmathematics (1840-1842) and adjunct professor (1843-1844). In 1846 he\r\ngraduated from Princeton Theological Seminary, and was instructor in\r\nHebrew there in 1846-1849. He was ordained in 1848 and was pastor of the\r\nCentral Presbyterian church of Philadelphia in 1849-1851. From August\r\n1851 until his death, in Princeton, New Jersey, on the 10th of February\r\n1900, he was professor of Biblical and Oriental Literature in Princeton\r\nTheological Seminary. From 1859 the title of his chair was Oriental and\r\nOld Testament Literature. In 1868 he refused the presidency of Princeton\r\nCollege; as senior professor he was long acting head of the Theological\r\nSeminary. He was a great Hebrew teacher: his _Grammar of the Hebrew\r\nLanguage_ (1861, revised 1888) was a distinct improvement in method on\r\nGesenius, Roediger, Ewald and Nordheimer. All his knowledge of Semitic\r\nlanguages he used in a \"conservative Higher Criticism,\" which is\r\nmaintained in the following works: _The Pentateuch Vindicated from the\r\nAspersions of Bishop Colenso_ (1863), _Moses and the Prophets_ (1883),\r\n_The Hebrew Feasts in their Relation to Recent Critical Hypotheses\r\nConcerning the Pentateuch_ (1885), _The Unity of the Book of Genesis_\r\n(1895), _The Higher Criticism of the Pentateuch_ (1895), and _A General\r\nIntroduction to the Old Testament_, vol. i. Canon (1898), vol. ii.\r\n_Text_ (1899). He was the scholarly leader of the orthodox wing of the\r\nPresbyterian church in America, and was moderator of the General\r\nAssembly of 1891. Green was chairman of the Old Testament committee of\r\nthe Anglo-American Bible revision committee.\r\n\r\n  See the articles by John D. Davis in _The Biblical World_, new series,\r\n  vol. xv., pp. 406-413 (Chicago, 1900), and _The Presbyterian and\r\n  Reformed Review_, vol. xi. pp. 377-396 (Philadelphia, 1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENAWAY, KATE (1846-1901), English artist and book illustrator, was\r\nthe daughter of John Greenaway, a well-known draughtsman and engraver on\r\nwood, and was born in London on the 17th of March 1846. After a course\r\nof study at South Kensington, at \"Heatherley's\" life classes, and at the\r\nSlade School, Kate Greenaway began, in 1868, to exhibit water-colour\r\ndrawings at the Dudley Gallery, London. Her more remarkable early work,\r\nhowever, consisted of Christmas cards, which, by reason of their quaint\r\nbeauty of design and charm of draughtsmanship, enjoyed an extraordinary\r\nvogue. Her subjects were, in the main, young girls, children, flowers,\r\nand landscape; and the air of artless simplicity, freshness, humour, and\r\npurity of these little works so appealed to public and artists alike\r\nthat the enthusiastic welcome habitually accorded to them is to be\r\nattributed to something more than love of novelty. In the line she had\r\nstruck out Kate Greenaway was encouraged by H. Stacy Marks, R.A., and\r\nshe refused to listen to those friends who urged her to return to a more\r\nconventional manner. Thenceforward her illustrations for children (such\r\nas for _Little Folks_, 1873, _et seq._) attracted much attention. In\r\n1877 her drawings at the Dudley Gallery were sold for L54, and her Royal\r\nAcademy picture for eighteen guineas; and in the same year she began to\r\ndraw for the _Illustrated London News_. In the year 1879 she produced\r\n_Under the Window_, of which 150,000 copies are said to have been sold,\r\nand of which French and German editions were also issued. Then followed\r\n_The Birthday Book_, _Mother Goose_, _Little Ann_, and other books for\r\nchildren which were appreciated not less by adults, and were to be found\r\non sale in the bookshops of every capital in Europe and in the cities of\r\nAmerica. The extraordinary success achieved by the young girl may be\r\nestimated by the amounts paid to her as her share of the profits: for\r\n_Under the Window_ she received L1130; for _The Birthday Book_, L1250;\r\nfor _Mother Goose_, L905; and for _Little Ann_, L567. These four books\r\nalone produced a clear return of L8000. \"Toy-books\" though they were,\r\nthese little works created a revolution in illustration, and so were of\r\nreal importance; they were loudly applauded by John Ruskin (_Art of\r\nEngland_ and _Fors Clavigera_), by Ernest Chesneau and Arsene Alexandre\r\nin France, by Dr Muther in Germany, and by leading art-critics\r\nthroughout the world. In 1890 Kate Greenaway was elected a member of the\r\nRoyal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, and in 1891, 1894 and 1898\r\nshe exhibited water-colour drawings, including illustrations for her\r\nbooks, at the gallery of the Fine Art Society (by which a representative\r\nselection was exhibited in 1902), where they surprised the world by the\r\ninfinite delicacy, tenderness, and grace which they displayed. A leading\r\nfeature in Miss Greenaway's work was her revival of the delightfully\r\nquaint costume of the beginning of the 19th century; this lent humour to\r\nher fancy, and so captivated the public taste that it has been said,\r\nwith poetic exaggeration, that \"Kate Greenaway dressed the children of\r\ntwo continents.\" Her drawings of children have been compared with\r\nStothard's for grace and with Reynolds's for naturalness, and those of\r\nflowers with the work of van Huysum and Botticelli. From 1883 to 1897,\r\nwith a break only in 1896, she issued a series of _Kate Greenaway's\r\nAlmanacs_. Although she illustrated _The Pied Piper of Hamelin_ and\r\nother works, the artist preferred to provide her own text; the numerous\r\nverses which were found among her papers after her death prove that she\r\nmight have added to her reputation with her pen. She had great charm of\r\ncharacter, but was extremely shy of public notice, and not less modest\r\nin private life. She died at Hampstead on the 6th of November 1901.\r\n\r\n  See the _Life_, by M. H. Spielmann and G. S. Layard (1905).\r\n       (M. H. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENBACKS, a form of paper currency in the United States, so named from\r\nthe green colour used on the backs of the notes. They are treasury\r\nnotes, and were first issued by the government in 1862, \"as a question\r\nof hard necessity,\" to provide for the expenses of the Civil War. The\r\ngovernment, following the example of the banks, had suspended specie\r\npayment. The new notes were therefore for the time being an\r\ninconvertible paper currency, and, since they were made legal tender,\r\nwere really a form of fiat money. The first act, providing for the issue\r\nof notes to the amount of $150,000,000, was that of the 25th February\r\n1862; the acts of 11th July 1862 and 3rd March 1863 each authorized\r\nfurther issues of $150,000,000. The notes soon depreciated in value, and\r\nat the lowest were worth only 35 cents on the dollar. The act of 12th\r\nApril 1866 authorized the retirement of $10,000,000 of notes within six\r\nmonths and of $4,000,000 per month thereafter; this was discontinued by\r\nact of 4th February 1868. On 1st January 1879 specie payment was\r\nresumed, and the nominal amount of notes then stood at $346,681,000,\r\nwhich is still outstanding.\r\n\r\n  The so-called _Greenback party_ (also called the _Independent_, and\r\n  the _National_ party) first appeared in a presidential campaign in\r\n  1876, when its candidate, Peter Cooper, received 81,740 votes. It\r\n  advocated increasing the volume of greenbacks, forbidding bank issues,\r\n  and the paying in greenbacks of the principal of all government bonds\r\n  not expressly payable in coin. In 1878 the party, by various fusions,\r\n  cast over 1,000,000 votes and elected 14 Congressmen; and in 1880\r\n  there was fusion with labour reformers and it cast 308,578 votes for\r\n  its presidential candidate, J. B. Weaver, and elected 8 Congressmen.\r\n  In 1884 their candidate Benjamin F. Butler (also the candidate of the\r\n  Anti-Monopoly party) received 175,370 votes. Subsequently the party\r\n  went out of existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN BAY, a city and the county-seat of Brown county, Wisconsin,\r\nU.S.A., at the S. extremity of Green Bay, at the mouth of the Fox\r\nriver, 114 m. N. of Milwaukee. Pop. (1890) 9069; (1900) 18,684, of whom\r\n4022 were foreign-born and 33 were negroes; (1910 census) 25,236. The\r\ncity is served by the Chicago & North-Western, the Chicago, Milwaukee &\r\nSt Paul, the Kewaunee, Green Bay & Western, and the Green Bay & Western\r\nrailways, by an inter-urban electric railway connecting with other Fox\r\nRiver Valley cities, and by lake and river steamboat lines. Green Bay\r\nlies on high level ground on both sides of the river, which is here\r\ncrossed by several bridges. The city has the Kellogg Public Library, the\r\nBrown County Court House, two high schools, a business college, several\r\nacademies, two hospitals, an orphan asylum and the State Odd Fellows'\r\nHome. It is the seat of a Roman Catholic cathedral, the bishopric being\r\nthe earliest established in the North-west. The so-called \"Tank\r\nCottage,\" now in Washington Park, is said to be the oldest house in\r\nWisconsin; it was built on the W. bank of the river near its mouth by\r\nJoseph Roy, a French-Canadian _voyageur_, in 1766, was subsequently\r\nsomewhat modified, and in 1908 was bought and removed to its present\r\nsite by the Green Bay Historical Society. Midway between Green Bay and\r\nDe Pere (5 m. S.W. of Green Bay) is the state reformatory, opened in\r\n1899-1901. Green Bay's fine harbour accommodates a considerable lake\r\ncommerce, and the city is the most important railway and wholesale\r\ndistributing centre in N.E. Wisconsin. Its manufactures include lumber\r\nand lumber products, furniture, wagons, woodenware, farm implements and\r\nmachinery, flour, beer, canned goods, brick and tile and dairy products;\r\nand it has lumber yards, grain elevators, fish warehouses and railway\r\nrepair shops. The total value of the factory product in 1905 was\r\n$4,873,027, an increase of 79.9% since 1900. The first recorded visit of\r\na European to the vicinity of what is now Green Bay is that of Jean\r\nNicolet, who was sent west by Champlain in 1634, and found, probably at\r\nthe Red Banks, some 10 m. below the present city, a village of Winnebago\r\nIndians, who he thought at first were Chinese. Between 1654 and 1658\r\nRadisson and Groseilliers and other _coureurs des bois_ were at Green\r\nBay. Claude Jean Allouez, the Jesuit missionary, established a mission\r\non the W. shore of the bay, about 20 m. from the present city. Later he\r\nremoved his mission to the Red Banks, and in the winter of 1671-1672\r\nestablished it permanently 5 m. above the present city, at Rapides des\r\nPeres, on the E. shore of the Fox river. In 1673 Joliet and Marquette\r\nvisited the spot. In 1683-1685 Le Sueur and Nicholas Perrot traded with\r\nthe Indians here. In 1718-1720 Fort St Francis was erected at the mouth\r\nof the river on the W. bank, and after being several times deserted was\r\npermanently re-established in 1732. About 1745 Augustin de Langlade\r\nestablished a trading post at La Baye and later brought his family there\r\nfrom Mackinac. This was the first permanent settlement at Green Bay and\r\nin Wisconsin. The British garrison which occupied the fort from 1761 to\r\n1763, during which time the fort received the name of Fort Edward\r\nAugustus, was removed at the time of Pontiac's rising, and the fort was\r\nnever re-garrisoned by the English, except for a short time during the\r\nWar of 1812. The inhabitants of La Baye were, however, acknowledged\r\nsubjects of Great Britain, the jurisdiction of the United States being\r\npractically a dead letter until the American fort (Fort Howard) was\r\ngarrisoned in 1816. As early as 1810 fur traders, employed by John Jacob\r\nAstor, were stationed here; about 1820 Astor erected a warehouse and\r\nother buildings; and for many years Green Bay consisted of two distinct\r\nsettlements, Astor and Navarino, which were finally united in 1839 as\r\nGreen Bay. The city was chartered in 1854. In 1893 Fort Howard was\r\nconsolidated with it. The Green Bay _Intelligencer_, the first newspaper\r\nin Wisconsin, began publication here in 1833.\r\n\r\n  See Neville and Martin, _Historic Green Bay_ (Green Bay, 1893); and\r\n  Martin and Beaumont, _Old Green Bay_ (Green Bay, 1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENCASTLE, a city and the county-seat of Putnam county, Indiana,\r\nU.S.A., about 38 m. W. by S. of Indianapolis and on the Big Walnut\r\nriver. Pop. (1900) 3661; (1910) 3790. It is served by the Cleveland,\r\nCincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis, the Chicago, Indianapolis &\r\nLouisville, the Vandalia, and the Terre Haute, Indianapolis & Eastern\r\n(electric) railways. It has manufactures of some importance, including\r\nlumber, pumps, kitchen-cabinets, drag-saws, lightning-rods and\r\ntin-plate, is in the midst of a blue grass region, and is a shipping\r\npoint for beef cattle. The city has a Carnegie library and is the seat\r\nof the de Pauw University (co-educational), a Methodist Episcopal\r\ninstitution, founded as Indiana Asbury University in 1837, and renamed\r\nin 1884 in honour of Washington Charles de Pauw (1822-1887), a\r\nsuccessful capitalist, banker and glass manufacturer. The total gifts of\r\nMr de Pauw and his family to the institution amount to about $600,000.\r\nAmong the presidents of the university have been Bishop Matthew Simpson,\r\nBishop Thomas Bowman (b. 1817), and Bishop Edwin Holt Hughes (b. 1866),\r\nall of the Methodist Episcopal church. The university comprises the\r\nAsbury College of Liberal Arts, a School of Music, a School of Art and\r\nan Academy, and had in 1909-1910 43 instructors, a library of 37,000\r\nvolumes, and 1017 students. Greencastle was first settled about 1820,\r\nand was chartered as a city in 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENE, GEORGE WASHINGTON (1811-1883), American historian, was born at\r\nEast Greenwich, Rhode Island, on the 8th of April 1811, the grandson of\r\nMajor-General Nathanael Greene. He entered Brown University in 1824,\r\nleft in his junior year on account of ill-health, was in Europe during\r\nthe next twenty years, except in 1833-1834, when he was principal of\r\nKent Academy at East Greenwich, and was the United States consul at Rome\r\nfrom 1837 to 1845. He was instructor in modern languages in Brown\r\nUniversity from 1848 to 1852; and in 1871-1875 was non-resident lecturer\r\nin American history in Cornell University. He died at East Greenwich,\r\nRhode Island, on the 2nd of February 1883. His published works include\r\nFrench and Italian text-books; _Historical Studies_ (1850);\r\n_Biographical Studies_ (1860); _Historical View of the American\r\nRevolution_ (1865); _Life of Nathanael Greene_ (3 vols., 1867-1871);\r\n_The German Element in the War of American Independence_ (1876); and a\r\n_Short History of Rhode Island_ (1877).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENE, MAURICE (1695-1755) English musical composer, was born in\r\nLondon. He was the son of a clergyman in the city, and soon became a\r\nchorister of St Paul's cathedral, where he studied under Charles King,\r\nand subsequently under Richard Brind, organist of the cathedral from\r\n1707 to 1718, whom, on his death in the last-named year, he succeeded.\r\nNine years later he became organist and composer to the chapel royal, on\r\nthe death of Dr Croft. In 1730 he was elected to the chair of music in\r\nthe university of Cambridge, and had the degree of doctor of music\r\nconferred on him. Dr Greene was a voluminous composer of church music,\r\nand his collection of _Forty Select Anthems_ became a standard work of\r\nits kind. He wrote a \"Te Deum,\" several oratorios, a masque, _The\r\nJudgment of Hercules_, and a pastoral opera, _Phoebe_ (1748); also glees\r\nand catches: and a collection of _Catches and Canons for Three and Four\r\nVoices_ is amongst his compositions. In addition he composed many\r\noccasional pieces for the king's birthday, having been appointed master\r\nof the king's band in 1735. But it is as a composer of church music that\r\nGreene is chiefly remembered. It is here that his contrapuntal skill and\r\nhis sound musical scholarship are chiefly shown. With Handel, Greene was\r\noriginally on intimate terms, but his equal friendship for Buononcini,\r\nHandel's rival, estranged the German master's feelings from him, and all\r\npersonal intercourse between them ceased. Greene, in conjunction with\r\nthe violinist Michael Christian Festing (1727-1752) and others,\r\noriginated the Society of Musicians, for the support of poor artists and\r\ntheir families. He died on the 1st of December 1755.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENE, NATHANAEL (1742-1786), American general, son of a Quaker farmer\r\nand smith, was born at Potowomut, in the township of Warwick, Rhode\r\nIsland, on the 7th of August (not, as has been stated, 6th of June)\r\n1742. Though his father's sect discouraged \"literary accomplishments,\"\r\nhe acquired a large amount of general information, and made a special\r\nstudy of mathematics, history and law. At Coventry, R.I., whither he\r\nremoved in 1770 to take charge of a forge built by his father and his\r\nuncles, he was the first to urge the establishment of a public school;\r\nand in the same year he was chosen a member of the legislature of Rhode\r\nIsland, to which he was re-elected in 1771, 1772 and 1775. He\r\nsympathized strongly with the Whig, or Patriot, element among the\r\ncolonists, and in 1774 joined the local militia. At this time he began\r\nto study the art of war. In December 1774 he was on a committee\r\nappointed by the assembly to revise the militia laws. His zeal in\r\nattending to military duty led to his expulsion from the Society of\r\nFriends.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, in command of the contingent raised by Rhode Island, he joined\r\nthe American forces at Cambridge, and on the 22nd of June was appointed\r\na brigadier by Congress. To him Washington assigned the command of the\r\ncity of Boston after it was evacuated by Howe in March 1776. Greene's\r\nletters of October 1775 and January 1776 to Samuel Ward, then a delegate\r\nfrom Rhode Island to the Continental Congress, favoured a declaration of\r\nindependence. On the 9th of August 1776 he was promoted to be one of the\r\nfour new major-generals and was put in command of the Continental troops\r\non Long Island; he chose the place for fortifications (practically the\r\nsame as that picked by General Charles Lee) and built the redoubts and\r\nentrenchments of Fort Greene on Brooklyn Heights. Severe illness\r\nprevented his taking part in the battle of Long Island. He was prominent\r\namong those who advised a retreat from New York and the burning of the\r\ncity, so that the British might not use it. Greene was placed in command\r\nof Fort Lee, and on the 25th of October succeeded General Israel Putnam\r\nin command of Fort Washington. He received orders from Washington to\r\ndefend Fort Washington to the last extremity, and on the 11th of October\r\nCongress had passed a resolution to the same effect; but later\r\nWashington wrote to him to use his own discretion. Greene ordered\r\nColonel Magaw, who was in immediate command, to defend the place until\r\nhe should hear from him again, and reinforced it to meet General Howe's\r\nattack. Nevertheless, the blame for the losses of Forts Washington and\r\nLee was put upon Greene, but apparently without his losing the\r\nconfidence of Washington, who indeed himself assumed the responsibility.\r\nAt Trenton Greene commanded one of the two American columns, his own,\r\naccompanied by Washington, arriving first; and after the victory here he\r\nurged Washington to push on immediately to Princeton, but was over-ruled\r\nby a council of war. At the Brandywine Greene commanded the reserve. At\r\nGermantown Greene's command, having a greater distance to march than the\r\nright wing under Sullivan, failed to arrive in good time--a failure\r\nwhich Greene himself thought (without cause) would cost him Washington's\r\nregard; on this, with the affair of Fort Washington, Bancroft based his\r\nunfavourable estimate of Greene's ability. But on their arrival, Greene\r\nand his troops distinguished themselves greatly.\r\n\r\nAt the urgent request of Washington, on the 2nd of March 1778, at Valley\r\nForge, he accepted the office of quartermaster-general (succeeding\r\nThomas Mifflin), and of his conduct in this difficult work, which\r\nWashington heartily approved, a modern critic, Colonel H. B. Carrington,\r\nhas said that it was \"as good as was possible under the circumstances of\r\nthat fluctuating uncertain force.\" He had become quartermaster-general\r\non the understanding, however, that he should retain the right to\r\ncommand troops in the field; thus we find him at the head of the right\r\nwing at Monmouth on the 28th of June. In August Greene and Lafayette\r\ncommanded the land forces sent to Rhode Island to co-operate with the\r\nFrench admiral d'Estaing, in an expedition which proved abortive. In\r\nJune 1780 Greene commanded in a skirmish at Springfield, New Jersey. In\r\nAugust he resigned the office of quartermaster-general, after a long and\r\nbitter struggle with Congress over the interference in army\r\nadministration by the Treasury Board and by commissions appointed by\r\nCongress. Before his resignation became effective it fell to his lot to\r\npreside over the court which, on the 29th of September, condemned Major\r\nJohn Andre to death.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of October he succeeded Gates as commander-in-chief of the\r\nSouthern army, and took command at Charlotte, N.C., on the 2nd of\r\nDecember. The army was weak and badly equipped and was opposed by a\r\nsuperior force under Cornwallis. Greene decided to divide his own\r\ntroops, thus forcing the division of the British as well, and creating\r\nthe possibility of a strategic interplay of forces. This strategy led to\r\nGeneral Daniel Morgan's victory of Cowpens (just over the South Carolina\r\nline) on the 17th of January 1781, and to the battle at Guilford Court\r\nHouse, N.C. (March 15), in which after having weakened the British\r\ntroops by continual movements, and drawn in reinforcements for his own\r\narmy, Greene was defeated indeed, but only at such cost to the victor\r\nthat Tarleton called it \"the pledge of ultimate defeat.\" Three days\r\nafter this battle Cornwallis withdrew toward Wilmington. Greene's\r\ngeneralship and judgment were again conspicuously illustrated in the\r\nnext few weeks, in which he allowed Cornwallis to march north to\r\nVirginia and himself turned swiftly to the reconquest of the inner\r\ncountry of South Carolina. This, in spite of a reverse sustained at Lord\r\nRawdon's hands at Hobkirk's Hill (2 m. N. of Camden) on the 25th of\r\nApril, he achieved by the end of June, the British retiring to the\r\ncoast. Greene then gave his forces a six weeks' rest on the High Hills\r\nof the Santee, and on the 8th of September, with 2600 men, engaged the\r\nBritish under Lieut.-Colonel James Stuart (who had succeeded Lord\r\nRawdon) at Eutaw Springs; the battle, although tactically drawn, so\r\nweakened the British that they withdrew to Charleston, where Greene\r\npenned them during the remaining months of the war. Greene's Southern\r\ncampaign showed remarkable strategic features that remind one of those\r\nof Turenne, the commander whom he had taken as his model in his studies\r\nbefore the war. He excelled in dividing, eluding and tiring his opponent\r\nby long marches, and in actual conflict forcing him to pay for a\r\ntemporary advantage a price that he could not afford. He was greatly\r\nassisted by able subordinates, including the Polish engineer, Tadeusz\r\nKosciusko, the brilliant cavalry captains, Henry (\"Light-Horse Harry\")\r\nLee and William Washington, and the partisan leaders, Thomas Sumter and\r\nFrancis Marion.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina and Georgia voted Greene liberal grants of lands and\r\nmoney. The South Carolina estate, Boone's Barony, S. of Edisto in\r\nBamberg County, he sold to meet bills for the rations of his Southern\r\narmy. On the Georgia estate, Mulberry Grove, 14 m. above Savannah, on\r\nthe river, he settled in 1785, after twice refusing (1781 and 1784) the\r\npost of secretary of war, and there he died of sunstroke on the 19th of\r\nJune 1786. Greene was a singularly able, and--like other prominent\r\ngenerals on the American side--a self-trained soldier, and was second\r\nonly to Washington among the officers of the American army in military\r\nability. Like Washington he had the great gift of using small means to\r\nthe utmost advantage. His attitude towards the Tories was humane and\r\neven kindly, and he generously defended Gates, who had repeatedly\r\nintrigued against him, when Gates's conduct of the campaign in the South\r\nwas criticized. There is a monument to Greene in Savannah (1829). His\r\nstatue, with that of Roger Williams, represents the state of Rhode\r\nIsland in the National Hall of Statuary in the Capitol at Washington; in\r\nthe same city there is a bronze equestrian statue of him by H. K. Brown.\r\n\r\n  See the _Life of Nathanael Greene_ (3 vols., 1867-1871), by his\r\n  grandson, George W. Greene, and the biography (New York, 1893), by\r\n  Brig.-Gen. F. V. Greene, in the \"Great Commanders Series.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENE, ROBERT (c. 1560-1592), English dramatist and miscellaneous\r\nwriter, was born at Norwich about 1560. The identity of his father has\r\nbeen disputed, but there is every reason to believe that he belonged to\r\nthe tradesmen's class and had small means. It is doubtful whether Robert\r\nGreene attended Norwich grammar school; but, as an eastern counties man\r\n(to one of whose plays, _Friar Bacon_, the Norfolk and Suffolk\r\nborderland owes a lasting poetic commemoration) he naturally found his\r\nway to Cambridge, where he entered St John's College as a sizar in 1575\r\nand took his B.A. thence in 1579, proceeding M.A. in 1583 from Clare\r\nHall. His life at the university was, according to his own account,\r\nspent \"among wags as lewd as himself, with whom he consumed the flower\r\nof his youth.\" In 1588 he was incorporated at Oxford, so that on some\r\nof his title-pages he styles himself \"utriusque Academiae in Artibus\r\nMagister\"; and Nashe humorously refers to him as \"utriusque Academiae\r\nRobertus Greene.\" Between the years 1578 and 1583 he had travelled\r\nabroad, according to his own account very extensively, visiting France,\r\nGermany, Poland and Denmark, besides learning at first-hand to \"hate the\r\npride of Italie\" and to know the taste of that poet's fruit, \"Spanish\r\nmirabolones.\" The grounds upon which it has been suggested that he took\r\nholy orders are quite insufficient; according to the title-page of a\r\npamphlet published by him in 1585 he was then a \"student in phisicke.\"\r\nAlready, however, after taking his M.A. degree, he had according to his\r\nown account begun his London life, and his earliest extant literary\r\nproduction was in hand as early as 1580. He now became \"an author of\r\nplayes and a penner of love-pamphlets, so that I soone grew famous in\r\nthat qualitie, that who for that trade growne so ordinary about London\r\nas Robin Greene?\" \"Glad was that printer,\" says Nashe, \"that might bee\r\nso blest to pay him deare for the very dregs of his wit.\" By his own\r\naccount he rapidly sank into the worst debaucheries of the town, though\r\nNashe declares that he never knew him guilty of notorious crime. He was\r\nnot without passing impulses towards a more righteous and sober life,\r\nand was derided in consequence by his associates as a \"Puritane and\r\nPresizian.\" It is possible that he, as well as his bitter enemy, Gabriel\r\nHarvey, exaggerated the looseness of his conduct. His marriage, which\r\ntook place in 1585 or 1586, failed to steady him; if Francesco, in\r\nGreene's pamphlet _Never too late to mend_ (1590), is intended for the\r\nauthor himself, it had been a runaway match; but the fiction and the\r\nautobiographical sketch in the _Repentance_ agree in their account of\r\nthe unfaithfulness which followed on the part of the husband. He lived\r\nwith his wife, whose name seems to have been Dorothy (\"Doll\"; and cf.\r\nDorothea in _James IV._), for a while; \"but forasmuch as she would\r\nperswade me from my wilful wickednes, after I had a child by her, I cast\r\nher off, having spent up the marriage-money which I obtained by her.\r\nThen left I her at six or seven, who went into Lincolnshire, and I to\r\nLondon,\" where his reputation as a playwright and writer of pamphlets of\r\n\"love and vaine fantasyes\" continued to increase, and where his life was\r\na feverish alternation of labour and debauchery. In his last years he\r\ntook it upon himself to make war on the cutpurses and \"conny-catchers\"\r\nwith whom he came into contact in the slums, and whose doings he\r\nfearlessly exposed in his writings. He tells us how at last he was\r\nfriendless \"except it were in a fewe alehouses,\" where he was respected\r\non account of the score he had run up. When the end came he was a\r\ndependant on the charity of the poor and the pitying love of the\r\nunfortunate. Henri Murger has drawn no picture more sickening and more\r\npitiful than the story of Greene's death, as told by his Puritan\r\nadversary, Gabriel Harvey--a veracious though a far from unprejudiced\r\nnarrator. Greene had taken up the cudgels provided by the Harvey\r\nbrothers on their intervention in the Marprelate controversy, and made\r\nan attack (immediately suppressed) upon Gabriel's father and family in\r\nthe prose-tract _A Quip for an Upstart Courtier, or a Quaint Dispute\r\nbetween Velvet Breeches and Cloth Breeches_ (1592). After a banquet\r\nwhere the chief guest had been Thomas Nashe--an old associate and\r\nperhaps a college friend of Greene's, any great intimacy with whom,\r\nhowever, he seems to have been anxious to disclaim--Greene had fallen\r\nsick \"of a surfeit of pickle herringe and Rennish wine.\" At the house of\r\na poor shoemaker near Dowgate, deserted by all except his compassionate\r\nhostess (Mrs Isam) and two women--one of them the sister of a notorious\r\nthief named \"Cutting Ball,\" and the mother of his illegitimate son,\r\nFortunatus Greene--he died on the 3rd of September 1592. Shortly before\r\nhis death he wrote under a bond for L10 which he had given to the good\r\nshoemaker, the following words addressed to his long-forsaken wife:\r\n\"Doll, I charge thee, by the loue of our youth and by my soules rest,\r\nthat thou wilte see this man paide; for if hee and his wife had not\r\nsuccoured me, I had died in the streetes.--Robert Greene.\"\r\n\r\n_Four Letters and Certain Sonnets_, Harvey's attack on Greene, appeared\r\nalmost immediately after his death, as to the circumstances of which his\r\nrelentless adversary had taken care to inform himself personally. Nashe\r\ntook up the defence of his dead friend and ridiculed Harvey in _Strange\r\nNews_ (1593); and the dispute continued for some years. But, before this,\r\nthe dramatist Henry Chettle published a pamphlet from the hand of the\r\nunhappy man, entitled _Greene's Groat's-worth of Wit bought with a\r\nMillion of Repentance_ (1592), containing the story of Roberto, who may\r\nbe regarded, for practical purposes, as representing Greene himself. This\r\nill-starred production may almost be said to have done more to excite the\r\nresentment of posterity against Greene's name than all the errors for\r\nwhich he professed his repentance. For in it he exhorted to repentance\r\nthree of his _quondam_ acquaintance. Of these three Marlowe was one--to\r\nwhom and to whose creation of \"that Atheist Tamberlaine\" he had\r\nrepeatedly alluded. The second was Peele, the third probably Nashe. But\r\nthe passage addressed to Peele contained a transparent allusion to a\r\nfourth dramatist, who was an actor likewise, as \"an vpstart crow\r\nbeautified with our feathers, that with his _Tygres heart wrapt in a\r\nplayer's hyde_ supposes hee is as well able to bombast out a blanke-verse\r\nas the best of you; and being an absolute Iohannes-fac-totum, is in his\r\nowne conceyt the onely shake-scene in a countrey.\" The phrase italicized\r\nparodies a passage occurring in _The True Tragedie of Richard, Duke of\r\nYork_, &c., and retained in Part III. of Henry VI. If Greene (as many\r\neminent critics have thought) had a hand in _The True Tragedie_, he must\r\nhere have intended a charge of plagiarism against Shakespeare. But while\r\nit seems more probable that (as the late R. Simpson suggested) the\r\nupstart crow beautified with the feathers of the three dramatists is a\r\nsneering description of the actor who declaimed their verse, the _animus_\r\nof the whole attack (as explained by Dr Ingleby) is revealed in its\r\nconcluding phrases. This \"shake-scene,\" i.e. this _actor_ had ventured to\r\nintrude upon the domain of the regular staff of playwrights--their\r\nmonopoly was in danger!\r\n\r\nTwo other prose pamphlets of an autobiographical nature were issued\r\nposthumously. Of these, _The Repentance of Robert Greene, Master of\r\nArts_ (1592), must originally have been written by him on his death-bed,\r\nunder the influence, as he says, of Father Parsons's _Booke of\r\nResolution_ (_The Christian Directorie, appertayning to Resolution_,\r\n1582, republished in an enlarged form, which became very popular, in\r\n1585); but it bears traces of having been improved from the original;\r\nwhile _Greene's Vision_ was certainly not, as the title-page avers,\r\nwritten during his last illness.\r\n\r\nAltogether not less than thirty-five prose-tracts are ascribed to\r\nGreene's prolific pen. Nearly all of them are interspersed with verses;\r\nin their themes they range from the \"misticall\" wonders of the heavens\r\nto the familiar but \"pernitious sleights\" of the sharpers of London. But\r\nthe most widely attractive of his prose publications were his\r\n\"love-pamphlets,\" which brought upon him the outcry of Puritan censors.\r\nThe earliest of his novels, as they may be called, _Mamillia_, was\r\nlicensed in 1583. This interesting story may be said to have accompanied\r\nGreene through life; for even part ii., of which, though probably\r\ncompleted several years earlier, the earliest extant edition bears the\r\ndate 1593, had a sequel, _The Anatomie of Love's Flatteries_, which\r\ncontains a review of suitors recalling Portia's in _The Merchant of\r\nVenice_. _The Myrrour of Modestie_ (the story of Susanna) (1584); _The\r\nHistorie of Arhasto, King of Denmarke_ (1584); _Morando, the Tritameron\r\nof Love_ (a rather tedious imitation of the _Decameron_ (1584);\r\n_Planetomachia_ (1585) (a contention in story-telling between Venus and\r\nSaturn); _Penelope's Web_ (1587) (another string of stories); _Alcida_,\r\n_Greene's Metamorphosis_ (1588), and others, followed. In these popular\r\nproductions he appears very distinctly as a follower of John Lyly;\r\nindeed, the first part of _Mamillia_ was entered in the Stationers'\r\nRegisters in the year of the appearance of _Euphues_, and two of\r\nGreene's novels are by their titles announced as a kind of sequel to the\r\nparent romance: _Euphues his Censure to Philautus_ (1587), _Menaphon.\r\nCamilla's Alarum to Slumbering Euphues_ (1589), named in some later\r\neditions _Greene's Arcadia_. This pastoral romance, written in direct\r\nemulation of Sidney's, with a heroine called Samila, contains St\r\nSephestia's charming lullaby, with its refrain \"Father's sorowe,\r\nfather's joy.\" But, though Greene's style copies the balanced\r\noscillation, and his diction the ornateness (including the proverbial\r\nphilosophy) of Lyly, he contrives to interest by the matter as well as\r\nto attract attention by the manner of his narratives. Of his highly\r\nmoral intentions he leaves the reader in no doubt, since they are\r\nexposed on the title-pages. The full title of the _Myrrour of Modestie_\r\nfor instance continues: \"wherein appeareth as in a perfect glasse how\r\nthe Lord delivereth the innocent from all imminent perils, and plagueth\r\nthe blood-thirsty hypocrites with deserved punishments,\" &c. On his\r\n_Pandosto, The Triumph of Time_ (1588) Shakespeare founded _A Winter's\r\nTale_; in fact, the novel contains the entire plot of the comedy, except\r\nthe device of the living statue; though some of the subordinate\r\ncharacters in the play, including Autolycus, were added by Shakespeare,\r\ntogether with the pastoral fragrance of one of its episodes.\r\n\r\nIn Greene's _Never too Late_ (1590), announced as a \"Powder of\r\nExperience: sent to all youthfull gentlemen\" for their benefit, the\r\nhero, Francesco, is in all probability intended for Greene himself, the\r\nsequel or second part is, however, pure fiction. This episodical\r\nnarrative has a vivacity and truthfulness of manner which savour of an\r\n18th century novel rather than of an Elizabethan tale concerning the\r\ndays of \"Palmerin, King of Great Britain.\" Philador, the prodigal of\r\n_The Mourning Garment_ (1590), is obviously also in some respects a\r\nportrait of the writer. The experiences of the Roberto of _Greene's\r\nGroat's-worth of Wit_ (1592) are even more palpably the experiences of\r\nthe author himself, though they are possibly overdrawn--for a born\r\nrhetorician exaggerates everything, even his own sins. Besides these and\r\nthe posthumous pamphlets on his repentance, Greene left realistic\r\npictures of the very disreputable society to which he finally descended,\r\nin his pamphlets on \"conny-catching\": _A Notable Discovery of Coosnage_\r\n(1591), _The Blacke Bookes Messenger, Laying open the Life and Death of\r\nNed Browne, one of the most Notable Cutpurses, Crossbiters, and\r\nConny-catchers that ever lived in England_ (1592). Much in Greene's\r\nmanner, both in his romances and in his pictures of low life,\r\nanticipated what proved the slow course of the actual development of the\r\nEnglish novel; and it is probable that his true _metier_, and that which\r\nbest suited the bright fancy, ingenuity and wit of which his genius was\r\ncompounded, was pamphlet-spinning and story-telling rather than dramatic\r\ncomposition. It should be added that, euphuist as Greene was, few of his\r\ncontemporaries in their lyrics warbled wood-notes which like his\r\nresemble Shakespeare's in their native freshness.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, as Mr Churton Collins has pointed out, Greene, except\r\nin the two pamphlets written just before his death, never refers to his\r\nhaving written plays; and before 1592 his contemporaries are equally\r\nsilent as to his labours as a playwright. Only four plays remain to us\r\nof which he was indisputably the sole author. The earliest of these\r\nseems to have been the _Comicall History of Alphonsus, King of Arragon_,\r\nof which Henslowe's _Diary_ contains no trace. But it can hardly have\r\nbeen first acted long after the production of Marlowe's _Tamburlaine_,\r\nwhich had, in all probability, been brought on the stage in 1587. For\r\nthis play, \"comical\" only in the negative sense of having a happy\r\nending, was manifestly written in emulation as well as in direct\r\nimitation of Marlowe's tragedy. While Greene cannot have thought himself\r\ncapable of surpassing Marlowe as a tragic poet, he very probably wished\r\nto outdo him in \"business,\" and to equal him in the rant which was sure\r\nto bring down at least part of the house. _Alphonsus_ is a _history_\r\nproper--a dramatized chronicle or narrative of warlike events. Its fame\r\ncould never equal that of Marlowe's tragedy; but its composition showed\r\nthat Greene could seek to rival the most popular drama of the day,\r\nwithout falling very far short of his model.\r\n\r\nIn the _Honourable History of Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay_ (not known\r\nto have been acted before February, 1592, but probably written in 1589)\r\nGreene once more attempted to emulate Marlowe; and he succeeded in\r\nproducing a masterpiece of his own. Marlowe's _Doctor Faustus_, which\r\ndoubtless suggested the composition of Greene's comedy, reveals the\r\nmighty tragic genius of its author; but Greene resolved on an altogether\r\ndistinct treatment of a cognate theme. Interweaving with the popular\r\ntale of Friar Bacon and his wondrous doings a charming idyl (so far as\r\nwe know, of his own invention), the story of Prince Edward's love for\r\nthe Fair Maid of Fressingfield, he produced a comedy brimful of amusing\r\naction and genial fun. _Friar Bacon_ remains a dramatic picture of\r\nEnglish Elizabethan life with which _The Merry Wives_ alone can vie; and\r\nnot even the ultra-classicism in the similes of its diction can destroy\r\nthe naturalness which constitutes its perennial charm. _The History of\r\nOrlando Furioso, one of the Twelve Peeres of France_ has on\r\nunsatisfactory evidence been dated as before 1586, and is known to have\r\nbeen acted on the 21st of February 1592. It is a free dramatic\r\nadaptation of Ariosto, Harington's translation of whom appeared in 1591,\r\nand who in one passage is textually quoted; and it contains a large\r\nvariety of characters and a superabundance oi action. Fairly lucid in\r\narrangement and fluent in style, the treatment of the madness oi Orlando\r\nlacks tragic power. Very few dramatists from Sophocles to Shakespeare\r\nhave succeeded in subordinating the grotesque effect of madness to the\r\ntragic; and Greene is not to be included in the list.\r\n\r\nIn _The Scottish Historie of James IV._ (acted 1592, licensed for\r\npublication 1594) Greene seems to have reached the climax of his\r\ndramatic powers. The \"historical\" character of this play is pure\r\npretence. The story is taken from one of Giraldi Cinthio's tales. Its\r\ntheme is the illicit passion of King James for the chaste lady Ida, to\r\nobtain whose hand he endeavours, at the suggestion of a villain called\r\nAteukin, to make away with his own wife. She escapes in doublet and\r\nhose, attended by her faithful dwarf; but, on her father's making war\r\nupon her husband to avenge her wrongs, she brings about a reconciliation\r\nbetween them. Not only is this well-constructed story effectively worked\r\nout, but the characters are vigorously drawn, and in Ateukin there is a\r\ntouch of Iago. The fooling by Slipper, the clown of the piece, is\r\nunexceptionable; and, lest even so the play should hang heavy on the\r\naudience, its action is carried off by a \"pleasant comedie\"--i.e. a\r\nprelude and some dances between the acts--\"presented by Oboram, King of\r\nFayeries,\" who is, however, a very different person from the Oberon of\r\n_A Midsummer Night's Dream_.\r\n\r\n_George-a-Greene the Pinner of Wakefield_ (acted 1593, printed 1599), a\r\ndelightful picture of English life fully worthy of the author of _Friar\r\nBungay_, has been attributed to him; but the external evidence is very\r\nslight, and the internal unconvincing. Of the comedy of _Fair Em_, which\r\nresembles _Friar Bacon_ in more than one point, Greene cannot have been\r\nthe author; the question as to the priority between the two plays is not\r\nso easily solved. The conjecture as to his supposed share in the plays\r\non which the second and third parts of _Henry VI._ are founded has been\r\nalready referred to. He was certainly joint author with Thomas Lodge of\r\nthe curious drama called _A Looking Glasse for London and England_\r\n(acted in 1592 and printed in 1594)--a dramatic apologue conveying to\r\nthe living generation of Englishmen the warning of Nineveh's corruption\r\nand prophesied doom. The lesson was frequently repeated in the streets\r\nof London by the \"Ninevitical motions\" of the puppets; but there are\r\nboth fire and wealth of language in Greene and Lodge's oratory. The\r\ncomic element is not absent, being supplied in abundance by Adam, the\r\nclown of the piece, who belongs to the family of Slipper, and of Friar\r\nBacon's servant, Miles.\r\n\r\nGreene's dramatic genius has nothing in it of the intensity of Marlowe's\r\ntragic muse; nor perhaps does he ever equal Peele at his best. On the\r\nother hand, his dramatic poetry is occasionally animated with the breezy\r\nfreshness which no artifice can simulate. He had considerable\r\nconstructive skill, but he has created no character of commanding\r\npower--unless Ateukin be excepted; but his personages are living men and\r\nwomen, and marked out from one another with a vigorous but far from rude\r\nhand. His comic humour is undeniable, and he had the gift of light and\r\ngraceful dialogue. His diction is overloaded with classical ornament,\r\nbut his versification is easy and fluent, and its cadence is at times\r\nsingularly sweet. He creates his best effects by the simplest means; and\r\nhe is indisputably one of the most attractive of early English dramatic\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\n  Greene's dramatic works and poems were edited by Alexander Dyce in\r\n  1831 with a life of the author. This edition was reissued in one\r\n  volume in 1858. His complete works were edited for the Huth Library by\r\n  A. B. Grosart. This issue (1881-1886) contains a translation of\r\n  Nicholas Storojhenko's monograph on Greene (Moscow, 1878). Greene's\r\n  plays and poems were edited with introductions and notes by J. Churton\r\n  Collins in 2 vols. (Oxford, 1905); the general introduction to this\r\n  edition has superseded previous accounts of Greene and his dramatic\r\n  and lyrical writings. An account of his pamphlets is to be found in J.\r\n  J. Jusserand's _English Novel in the Time of Shakespeare_ (Eng.\r\n  trans., 1890). See also W. Bernhardi, _Robert Greenes Leben und\r\n  Schriften_ (1874); F. M. Bodenstedt, in _Shakespeare's Zeitgenossen\r\n  und ihre Werke_ (1858); and an introduction by A. W. Ward to _Friar\r\n  Bacon and Friar Bungay_ (Oxford, 1886, 4th ed., 1901).     (A. W. W.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENFIELD, a township and the county-seat of Franklin county, in N.E.\r\nMassachusetts, U.S.A., including an area of 20 sq. m. of meadow and hill\r\ncountry, watered by the Green and Deerfield rivers and various small\r\ntributaries. Pop. (1890) 5252, (1900) 7927, of whom 1431 were\r\nforeign-born; (1910 census) 10,427. The principal village, of the same\r\nname as the township, is situated on the N. bank of the Deerfield river,\r\nand on the Boston & Maine railway and the Connecticut Valley street\r\nrailway (electric). Among Greenfield's manufactures are cutlery,\r\nmachinery, and taps and dies. Greenfield, originally part of Deerfield,\r\nwas settled about 1682, was established as a \"district\" in 1753, and on\r\nthe 23rd of August 1775 was, by a general Act, separated from Deerfield\r\nand incorporated as a separate township, although it had assumed full\r\ntownship rights in 1774 by sending delegates to the Provincial Congress.\r\nIn 1793 part of it was taken to form the township of Gill; in 1838 part\r\nof it was annexed to Bernardston; and in 1896 it annexed a part of\r\nDeerfield. It was much disaffected at the time of Shays's Rebellion.\r\n\r\n  See F. M. Thompson, _History of Greenfield_ (2 vols., Greenfield,\r\n  1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENFINCH (Ger. _Grunfink_), or GREEN LINNET, as it is very often\r\ncalled, a common European bird, the _Fringilla chloris_ of Linnaeus,\r\nranked by many systematists with one section of hawfinches,\r\n_Coccothraustes_, but apparently more nearly allied to the other section\r\n_Hesperiphona_, and perhaps justifiably deemed the type of a distinct\r\ngenus, to which the name _Chloris_ or _Ligurinus_ has been applied. The\r\ncock, in his plumage of yellowish-green and yellow is one of the most\r\nfinely coloured of common English birds, but he is rather heavily built,\r\nand his song is hardly commended. The hen is much less brightly tinted.\r\nThroughout Britain, as a rule, this species is one of the most plentiful\r\nbirds, and is found at all seasons of the year. It pervades almost the\r\nwhole of Europe, and in Asia reaches the river Ob. It visits Palestine,\r\nbut is unknown in Egypt. It is, however, abundant in Mauritania, whence\r\nspecimens are so brightly coloured that they have been deemed to form a\r\ndistinct species, the _Ligurinus aurantiiventris_ of Dr Cabanis, but\r\nthat view is now generally abandoned. In the north-east of Asia and its\r\nadjacent islands occur two allied species--the _Fringilla sinica_ of\r\nLinnaeus and the _F. kawarahiba_ of Temminck. (A. N.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENHEART, one of the most valuable of timbers, the produce of\r\n_Nectandra Rodiaei_, natural order Lauraceae, a large tree, native of\r\ntropical South America and the West Indies. The Indian name of the tree\r\nis _sipiri_ or _bibiru_, and from its bark and fruits is obtained the\r\nfebrifuge principle bibirine. Greenheart wood is of a dark-green colour,\r\nsap wood and heart wood being so much alike that they can with difficulty\r\nbe distinguished from each other. The heart wood is one of the most\r\ndurable of all timbers, and its value is greatly enhanced by the fact\r\nthat it is proof against the ravages of many marine borers which rapidly\r\ndestroy piles and other submarine structures of most other kinds of wood\r\navailable for such purposes. In the Kelvingrove Museum, Glasgow, there\r\nare two pieces of planking from a wreck submerged during eighteen years\r\non the west coast of Scotland. The one specimen--greenheart--is merely\r\nslightly pitted on the surface, the body of the wood being perfectly\r\nsound and untouched, while the other--teak--is almost entirely eaten\r\naway. Greenheart, tested either by transverse or by tensile strain, is\r\none of the strongest of all woods, and it is also exceedingly dense, its\r\nspecific gravity being about 1150. It is included in the second line of\r\nLloyd's Register for shipbuilding purposes, and it is extensively used\r\nfor keelsons, beams, engine-bearers and planking, &c., as well as in the\r\ngeneral engineering arts, but its excessive weight unfits it for many\r\npurposes for which its other properties would render it eminently\r\nsuitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENLAND (Danish, &c., _Gronland_), a large continental island, the\r\ngreater portion of which lies within the Arctic Circle, while the whole\r\nis arctic in character. It is not connected with any portion of Europe\r\nor America except by suboceanic ridges; but in the extreme north it is\r\nseparated only by a narrow strait from Ellesmere Land in the archipelago\r\nof the American continent. It is bounded on the east by the North\r\nAtlantic, the Norwegian and Greenland Seas--Jan Mayen, Iceland, the\r\nFaeroe Islands and the Shetlands being the only lands between it and\r\nNorway. Denmark Strait is the sea between it and Iceland, and the\r\nnorthern Norwegian Sea or Greenland Sea separates it from Spitsbergen.\r\nOn the west Davis Strait and Baffin Bay separate it from Baffin Land.\r\nThe so-called bay narrows northward into the strait successively known\r\nas Smith Sound, Kane Basin, Kennedy Channel and Robeson Channel. A\r\nsubmarine ridge, about 300 fathoms deep at its deepest, unites Greenland\r\nwith Iceland (across Denmark Strait), the Faeroes and Scotland. A\r\nsimilar submarine ridge unites it with the Cumberland Peninsula of\r\nBaffin Land, across Davis Strait. Two large islands (with others\r\nsmaller) lie probably off the north coast, being apparently divided from\r\nit by very narrow channels which are not yet explored. If they be\r\nreckoned as integral parts of Greenland, then the north coast, fronting\r\nthe polar sea, culminates about 83 deg. 40' N. Cape Farewell, the most\r\nsoutherly point (also on a small island), is in 59 deg. 45' N. The\r\nextreme length of Greenland may therefore be set down at about 1650 m.,\r\nwhile its extreme breadth, which occurs about 77 deg. 30' N., is\r\napproximately 800 m. The area is estimated at 827,275 sq. m. Greenland\r\nis a Danish colony, inasmuch as the west coast and also the southern\r\neast coast belong to the Danish crown. The scattered settlements of\r\nEuropeans on the southern parts of the coasts are Danish, and the trade\r\nis a monopoly of the Danish government.\r\n\r\nThe southern and south-western coasts have been known, as will be\r\nmentioned later, since the 10th century, when Norse settlers appeared\r\nthere, and the names of many famous arctic explorers have been\r\nassociated with the exploration of Greenland. The communication between\r\nthe Norse settlements in Greenland and the motherland Norway was broken\r\noff at the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th century, and\r\nthe Norsemen's knowledge about their distant colony was gradually more\r\nor less forgotten. The south and west coast of Greenland was then\r\nre-discovered by John Davis in July 1585, though previous explorers, as\r\nCortereal, Frobisher and others, had seen it, and at the end of the 16th\r\nand the beginning of the 17th century the work of Davis (1586-1588).\r\nHudson (1610) and Baffin (1616) in the western seas afforded some\r\nknowledge of the west coast. This was added to by later explorers and by\r\nwhalers and sealers. Among explorers who in the 19th century were\r\nspecially connected with the north-west coast may be mentioned E. A.\r\nInglefield (1852) who sailed into Smith's Sound,[1] Elisha Kent Kane\r\n(1853-1855)[2] who worked northward through Smith Sound into Kane Basin,\r\nand Charles Francis Hall (1871) who explored the strait (Kennedy Channel\r\nand Robeson Channel) to the north of this.[3]\r\n\r\nThe northern east coast was sighted by Hudson (1607) in about 73 deg.\r\n30' N. (C. Hold with Hope), and during the 17th century and later this\r\nnorthern coast was probably visited by many Dutch whalers. The first who\r\ngave more accurate information was the Scottish whaler, Captain William\r\nScoresby, jun. (1822), who, with his father, explored the coast between\r\n69 deg. and 75 deg. N., and gave the first fairly trustworthy map of\r\nit.[4] Captains Edward Sabine and Clavering (1823) visited the coast\r\nbetween 72 deg. 5' and 75 deg. 12' N. and met the only Eskimo ever seen\r\nin this part of Greenland. The second German polar expedition in 1870,\r\nunder Carl Christian Koldewey[5] (1837-1908), reached 77 deg. N. (Cape\r\nBismarck); and the duke of Orleans, in 1905, ascertained that this point\r\nwas on an island (the Dove Bay of the German expedition being in reality\r\na strait) and penetrated farther north, to about 78 deg. 16'. From this\r\npoint the north-east coast remained unexplored, though a sight was\r\nreported in 1670 by a whaler named Lambert, and again in 1775 as far\r\nnorth as 79 deg. by Daines Barrington, until a Danish expedition under\r\nMylius Erichsen in 1906-1908 explored it, discovering North-East\r\nForeland, the easternmost point (see Polar Regions and map). The\r\nsouthern part of the east coast was first explored by the Dane Wilhelm\r\nAugust Graah (1829-1830) between Cape Farewell and 65 deg. 16' N.[6] In\r\n1883-1885 the Danes G. Holm and T. V. Garde carefully explored and\r\nmapped the coast from Cape Farewell to Angmagssalik, in 66 deg. N.[7] F.\r\nNansen and his companions also travelled along a part of this coast in\r\n1888.[8] A. E. Nordenskiold, in the \"Sophia,\" landed near Angmagssalik,\r\nin 65 deg. 36' N., in 1883.[9] Captain C. Ryder, in 1891-1892, explored\r\nand mapped the large Scoresby Sound, or, more correctly, Scoresby\r\nFjord.[10] Lieutenant G. Amdrup, in 1899, explored the coast from\r\nAngmagssalik north to 67 deg. 22' N.[11] A part of this coast, about 67\r\ndeg. N., had also been seen by Nansen in 1882.[12] In 1899 Professor A.\r\nG. Nathorst explored the land between Franz Josef Fjord and Scoresby\r\nFjord, where the large King Oscar Fjord, connecting Davy's Sound with\r\nFranz Joseph Fjord, was discovered.[13] In 1900 Lieutenant Amdrup\r\nexplored the still unknown east coast from 690 10' N. south to 67 deg.\r\nN.[14]\r\n\r\nFrom the work of explorers in the north-west it had been possible to\r\ninfer the approximate latitude of the northward termination of Greenland\r\nlong before it was definitely known. Towards the close of the 19th\r\ncentury several explorers gave attention to this question. Lieutenant\r\n(afterwards Admiral) L. A. Beaumont (1876), of the Nares Expedition,\r\nexplored the coast north-east of Robeson Channel to 82 deg. 20' N.[15]\r\nIn 1882 Lieut. J. B. Lockwood and Sergeant (afterwards Captain) D. L.\r\nBrainard, of the U.S. expedition to Lady Franklin Bay,[16] explored the\r\nnorth-west coast beyond Beaumont's farthest to a promontory in 83 deg.\r\n24' N. and 40 deg. 46' E. and they saw to the north-east Cape\r\nWashington, in about 83 deg. 38' N. and 39 deg. 30' E., the most\r\nnortherly point of land till then observed. In July 1892 R. E. Peary and\r\nE. Astrup, crossing by land from Inglefield Gulf, Smith Sound,\r\ndiscovered Independence Bay on the north-east coast in 81 deg. 37' N.\r\nand 34 deg. 5' W.[17] In May 1895 it was revisited by Peary, who\r\nsupposed this bay to be a sound communicating with Victoria Inlet on the\r\nnorth-west coast. To the north Heilprin Land and Melville Land were seen\r\nstretching northwards, but the probability seemed to be that the coast\r\nsoon trended north-west. In 1901 Peary rounded the north point, and\r\npenetrated as far north as 83 deg. 50' N. The scanty exploration of the\r\ngreat ice-cap, or inland ice, which may be asserted to cover the whole\r\nof the interior of Greenland, has been prosecuted chiefly from the west\r\ncoast. In 1751 Lars Dalager, a Danish trader, took some steps in this\r\ndirection from Frederikshaab. In 1870 Nordenskiold and Berggren walked\r\n35 m. inland from the head of Aulatsivik Fjord (near Disco Bay) to an\r\nelevation of 2200 ft. The Danish captain Jens Arnold Dietrich Jensen\r\nreached, in 1878, the Jensen Nunataks (5400 ft. above the sea), about 45\r\nm. from the western margin, in 62 deg. 50' N.[18] Nordenskiold\r\npenetrated in 1883 about 70 m. inland in 68 deg. 20' N., and two Lapps\r\nof his expedition went still farther on skis, to a point nearly under 45\r\ndeg. W. at an elevation of 6600 ft. Peary and Maigaard reached in 1886\r\nabout 100 m. inland, a height of 7500 ft. in 69 deg. 30' N. Nansen with\r\nfive companions in 1888 made the first complete crossing of the inland\r\nice, working from the east coast to the west, about 64 deg. 25' N., and\r\nreached a height of 8922 ft. Peary and Astrup, as already indicated,\r\ncrossed in 1892 the northern part of the inland ice between 78 deg. and\r\n82 deg. N., reaching a height of about 8000 ft., and determined the\r\nnorthern termination of the ice-covering. Peary made very nearly the\r\nsame journey again in 1895. Captain T. V. Garde explored in 1893 the\r\ninterior of the inland ice between 61 deg. and 62 deg. N. near its\r\nsouthern termination, and he reached a height of 7080 ft. about 60 m.\r\nfrom the margin.[19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Greenland.]\r\n\r\n  _Coasts._--The coasts of Greenland are for the most part deeply\r\n  indented with fjords, being intensely glaciated. The coast-line of\r\n  Melville Bay (the northern part of the west coast) is to some degree\r\n  an exception, though the fjords may here be somewhat filled with\r\n  glaciers, and, for another example, it may be noted that Peary\r\n  observed a marked contrast on the north coast. Eastward as far as Cape\r\n  Morris Jesup there are precipitous headlands and islands, as\r\n  elsewhere, with deep water close inshore. East of the same cape there\r\n  is an abrupt change; the coast is unbroken, the mountains recede\r\n  inland, and there is shoal-water for a considerable distance from the\r\n  coast. Numerous islands lie off the coasts where they are indented;\r\n  but these are in no case large, excepting those off the north coast,\r\n  and that of Disco off the west, which is crossed by the parallel of\r\n  70 deg. N. This island, which is separated by Waigat Strait from the\r\n  Nugsuak peninsula, is lofty, and has an area of 3005 sq. m. Steenstrup\r\n  in 1898 discovered in it the warmest spring known in Greenland, having\r\n  a temperature of 66 deg. F.\r\n\r\n  The unusual glaciation of the east coast is evidently owing to the\r\n  north polar current carrying the ice masses from the north polar basin\r\n  south-westward along the land, and giving it an entirely arctic\r\n  climate down to Cape Farewell. In some parts the interior ice-covering\r\n  extends down to the outer coast, while in other parts its margin is\r\n  situated more inland, and the ice-bare coast-land is deeply\r\n  intersected by fjords extending far into the interior, where they are\r\n  blocked by enormous glaciers or \"ice-currents\" from the interior\r\n  ice-covering which discharge masses of icebergs into them. The east\r\n  coast of Greenland is in this respect highly interesting. All coasts\r\n  in the world which are much intersected by deep fjords have, with very\r\n  few exceptions, a western exposure, e.g. Norway, Scotland, British\r\n  Columbia and Alaska, Patagonia and Chile, and even Spitsbergen and\r\n  Novaya Zemlya, whose west coasts are far more indented than their east\r\n  ones. Greenland forms the most prominent exception, its eastern coast\r\n  being quite as much indented as its western. The reason is to be found\r\n  in its geographical position, a cold ice-covered polar current running\r\n  south along the land, while not far outside there is an open warmer\r\n  sea, a circumstance which, while producing a cold climate, must also\r\n  give rise to much precipitation, the land being thus exposed to the\r\n  alternate erosion of a rough atmosphere and large glaciers. On the\r\n  east coast of Baffin Land and Labrador there are similar conditions.\r\n  The result is that the east coast of Greenland has the largest system\r\n  of typical fjords known on the earth's surface. Scoresby Fjord has a\r\n  length of about 180 m. from the outer coast to the point where it is\r\n  blocked by the glaciers, and with its numerous branches covers an\r\n  enormous area. Franz Josef Fjord, with its branch King Oscar Fjord,\r\n  communicating with Davy's Sound, forms a system of fjords on a similar\r\n  scale. These fjords are very deep; the greatest depth found by Ryder\r\n  in Scoresby Sound was 300 fathoms, but there are certainly still\r\n  greater depths; like the Norwegian fjords they have, however, probably\r\n  all of them, a threshold or sill, with shallow water, near their\r\n  mouths. A few soundings made outside this coast seem to indicate that\r\n  the fjords continue as deep submarine valleys far out into the sea. On\r\n  the west coast there are also many great fjords. One of the best known\r\n  from earlier days is the great Godthaab Fjord (or Baals Revier) north\r\n  of 64 deg. N. Along the east coast there are many high mountains,\r\n  exceeding 6000 and 7000 ft. in height. One of the highest peaks\r\n  hitherto measured is at Tiningnertok, on the Lindenov Fjord, in 60\r\n  deg. 35' N., which is 7340 ft. high. At the bottom of Mogens Heinesen\r\n  Fjord, 62 deg. 30' N., the peaks are 6300 ft., and in the region of\r\n  Umanak, 63 deg. N., they even exceed 6600 ft. At Umivik, where Nansen\r\n  began his journey across the inland ice, the highest peak projecting\r\n  through the ice-covering was Gamel's Nunatak, 6440 ft., in 64 deg. 34'\r\n  N. In the region of Angmagssalik, which is very mountainous, the\r\n  mountains rise to 6500 ft., the most prominent peak being Ingolf's\r\n  Fjeld, in 66 deg. 20' N., about 6000 ft., which is seen from far out\r\n  at sea, and forms an excellent landmark. This is probably the Blaaserk\r\n  (i.e. Blue Sark or blue shirt) of the old Norsemen, their first\r\n  landmark on their way from Iceland to the Oster Bygd, the present\r\n  Julianehaab district, on the south-west coast of Greenland. A little\r\n  farther north the coast is much lower, rising only to heights of 2000\r\n  ft., and just north of 67 deg. 10' N. only to 500 ft. or less.[20] The\r\n  highest mountains near the inner branches of Scoresby Fjord are about\r\n  7000 ft. The Petermann Spitze, near the shore of Franz Josef Fjord,\r\n  measured by Payer and found to be 11,000 ft., has hitherto been\r\n  considered to be the highest mountain in Greenland, but according to\r\n  Nathorst it \"is probably only two-thirds as high as Payer supposed,\"\r\n  perhaps between 8000 and 9000 ft.\r\n\r\n  Along the west coast of Greenland the mountains are generally not\r\n  quite so high, but even here peaks of 5000 and 6000 ft. are not\r\n  uncommon. As a whole the coasts are unusually mountainous, and\r\n  Greenland forms in this respect an interesting exception, as there is\r\n  no other known land of such a size so filled along its coasts on all\r\n  sides with high mountains and deep fjords and valleys.\r\n\r\n  _The Inland Ice._--The whole interior of Greenland is completely\r\n  covered by the so-called inland ice, an enormous glacier forming a\r\n  regular shield-shaped expanse of snow and glacier ice, and burying all\r\n  valleys and mountains far below its surface. Its area is about 715,400\r\n  sq. m., and it is by far the greatest glacier of the northern\r\n  hemisphere. Only occasionally there emerge lofty rocks, isolated but\r\n  not completely covered by the ice-cap; such rocks are known as\r\n  _nunataks_ (an Eskimo word). The inland ice rises in the interior to a\r\n  level of 9000, and in places perhaps 10,000 ft. or more, and descends\r\n  gradually by extremely gentle slopes towards the coasts or the bottom\r\n  of the fjords on all sides, discharging a great part of its yearly\r\n  drainage or surplus of precipitation in the form of icebergs in the\r\n  fjords, the so-called ice-fjords, which are numerous both on the west\r\n  and on the east coast. These icebergs float away, and are gradually\r\n  melted in the sea, the temperature of which is thus lowered by cold\r\n  stored up in the interior of Greenland. The last remains of these\r\n  icebergs are met with in the Atlantic south of Newfoundland. The\r\n  surface of the inland ice forms in a transverse section from the west\r\n  to the east coast an extremely regular curve, almost approaching an\r\n  arc of a wide circle, which along Nansen's route has its highest ridge\r\n  somewhat nearer the east than the west coast. The same also seems to\r\n  be the case farther south. The curve shows, however, slight\r\n  irregularities in the shape of undulations. The angle of the slope\r\n  decreases gradually from the margin of the inland ice, where it may be\r\n  1 deg. or more, towards the interior, where it is 0 deg. In the\r\n  interior the surface of the inland ice is composed of dry snow which\r\n  never melts, and is constantly packed and worked smooth by the winds.\r\n  It extends as a completely even plain of snow, with long, almost\r\n  imperceptible, undulations or waves, at a height of 7000 to 10,000\r\n  ft., obliterating the features of the underlying land, the mountains\r\n  and valleys of which are completely interred. Over the deepest valleys\r\n  of the land in the interior this ice-cap must be at least 6000 or 7000\r\n  ft. thick or more. Approaching the coasts from the interior, the snow\r\n  of the surface gradually changes its structure. At first it becomes\r\n  more coarse-grained, like the _Firn Schnee_ of the Alps, and is moist\r\n  by melting during the summer. Nearer the coast, where the melting on\r\n  the surface is more considerable, the wet snow freezes hard during the\r\n  winter and is more or less transformed into ice, on the surface of\r\n  which rivers and lakes are formed, the water of which, however, soon\r\n  finds its way through crevasses and holes in the ice down to its under\r\n  surface, and reaches the sea as a sub-glacial river. Near its margin\r\n  the surface of the inland ice is broken up by numerous large\r\n  crevasses, formed by the outward motion of the glacier covering the\r\n  underlying land. The steep ice-walls at the margin of the inland ice\r\n  show, especially where the motion of the ice is slow, a distinct\r\n  striation, which indicates the strata of annual precipitation with the\r\n  intervening thin seams of dust (Nordenskiold's kryokonite). This is\r\n  partly dust blown on to the surface of the ice from the ice-bare\r\n  coast-land and partly the dust of the atmosphere brought down by the\r\n  falling snow and accumulated on the surface of the glacier's covering\r\n  by the melting during the summer. In the rapidly moving glaciers of\r\n  the ice-fjords this striation is not distinctly visible, being\r\n  evidently obliterated by the strong motion of the ice masses.\r\n\r\n  The ice-cap of Greenland must to some extent be considered as a\r\n  viscous mass, which, by the vertical pressure in its interior, is\r\n  pressed outwards and slowly flows towards the coasts, just as a mass\r\n  of pitch placed on a table and left to itself will in the course of\r\n  time flow outwards towards all sides. The motion of the\r\n  outwards-creeping inland ice will naturally be more independent of the\r\n  configurations of the underlying land in the interior, where its\r\n  thickness is so enormous, than near the margin where it is thinner.\r\n  Here the ice converges into the valleys and moves with increasing\r\n  velocity in the form of glaciers into the fjords, where they break off\r\n  as icebergs. The drainage of the interior of Greenland is thus partly\r\n  given off in the solid form of icebergs, partly by the melting of the\r\n  snow and ice on the surface of the ice-cap, especially near its\r\n  western margin, and to some slight extent also by the melting produced\r\n  on its under side by the interior heat of the earth. After Professor\r\n  Amund Helland had, in July 1875, discovered the amazingly great\r\n  velocity, up to 64-3/4 ft. in twenty-four hours, with which the\r\n  glaciers of Greenland move into the sea, the margin of the inland ice\r\n  and its glaciers was studied by several expeditions. K. J. V.\r\n  Steenstrup during several years, Captain Hammer in 1879-1880, Captain\r\n  Ryder in 1886-1887, Dr Drygalski in 1891-1893,[21] and several\r\n  American expeditions in later years, all examined the question\r\n  closely. The highest known velocities of glaciers were measured by\r\n  Ryder in the Upernivik glacier (in 73 deg. N.), where, between the\r\n  13th and 14th of August of 1886, he found a velocity of 125 ft. in\r\n  twenty-four hours, and an average velocity during several days of 101\r\n  ft. (Danish).[22] It was, however, ascertained that there is a great\r\n  difference between the velocities of the glaciers in winter and in\r\n  summer. For instance, Ryder found that the Upernivik glacier had an\r\n  average velocity of only 33 ft. in April 1887. There seem to be\r\n  periodical oscillations in the extension of the glaciers and the\r\n  inland ice similar to those that have been observed on the glaciers of\r\n  the Alps and elsewhere. But these interesting phenomena have not\r\n  hitherto been subject to systematic observation, and our knowledge of\r\n  them is therefore uncertain. Numerous glacial marks, however, such as\r\n  polished striated rocks, moraines, erratic blocks, &c., prove that the\r\n  whole of Greenland, even the small islands and skerries outside the\r\n  coast, has once been covered by the inland ice.\r\n\r\n  Numerous raised beaches and terraces, containing shells of marine\r\n  mollusca, &c., occur along the whole coast of Greenland, and indicate\r\n  that the whole of this large island has been raised, or the sea has\r\n  sunk, in post-glacial times, after the inland ice covered its now\r\n  ice-bare outskirts. In the north along the shores of Smith Sound these\r\n  traces of the gradual upheaval of the land, or sinking of the sea, are\r\n  very marked; but they are also very distinct in the south, although\r\n  not found so high above sea-level, which seems to show that the\r\n  upheaval has been greater in the north. In Uvkusigsat Fjord (72 deg.\r\n  20' N.) the highest terrace is 480 ft. above the sea.[23] On Manitsok\r\n  (65 deg. 30' N.) the highest raised beach was 360 ft. above the\r\n  sea.[24] In the Isortok Fjord (67 deg. 11' N.) the highest raised\r\n  beach is 380 ft. above sea-level.[25] In the Ameralik Fjord (64 deg.\r\n  14' N.) the highest marine terrace is about 340 ft. above sea-level,\r\n  and at Ilivertalik (63 deg. 14' N.), north of Fiskernaes, the highest\r\n  terrace is about 325 ft. above the sea. At Kakarsuak, near the\r\n  Bjornesund (62 deg. 50' N.), a terrace is found at 615 ft. above the\r\n  sea, but it is doubtful whether this is of marine origin.[26] In the\r\n  Julianehaab district, between 60 deg. and 61 deg. N., the highest\r\n  marine terraces are found at about 160 ft. above the sea.[27] The\r\n  highest marine terrace observed in Scoresby Fjord, on the east coast,\r\n  was 240 ft. above sea-level.[28] There is a common belief that during\r\n  quite recent times the west and south-west coast, within the Danish\r\n  possessions, has been sinking. Although there are many indications\r\n  which may make this probable, none of them can be said to be quite\r\n  decisive.[29]\r\n\r\n  [_Geology._--So far as made out, the structure of explored Greenland\r\n  is as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. _Laurentian gneiss_ forms the greatest mass of the exposed rocks of\r\n  the country bare of ice. They are found on both sides of Smith Sound,\r\n  rising to heights of 2000 ft., and underlie the Miocene and Cretaceous\r\n  rocks of Disco Island, Noursoak Peninsula and the Oolites of Pendulum\r\n  Island in East Greenland. Ancient schists occur on the east coast\r\n  south of Angmagssalik, and basalts and schists are found in Scoresby\r\n  Fjord. It is possible that some of these rocks are also of Huronian\r\n  age, but it is doubtful whether the rocks so designated by the\r\n  geologists of the \"Alert\" and \"Discovery\" expedition are really the\r\n  rocks so known in Canada, or are a continuous portion of the\r\n  fundamental or oldest gneiss of the north-west of Scotland and the\r\n  western isles.\r\n\r\n  2. _Silurian._--Upper Silurian, having a strong relation to the\r\n  Wenlock group of Britain, but with an American facies, and Lower\r\n  Silurian, with a succession much the same as in British North America,\r\n  are found on the shores of Smith Sound, and Nathorst has discovered\r\n  them in King Oscar Fjord, but not as yet so far south as the Danish\r\n  possessions.\r\n\r\n  3. _Devonian_ rocks are believed to occur in Igaliko and Tunnudiorbik\r\n  Fjords, in S.W. Greenland, but as they are unfossiliferous sandstone,\r\n  rapidly disintegrating, this cannot be known. It is, however, likely\r\n  that this formation occurs in Greenland, for in Dana Bay, Captain\r\n  Feilden found a species of _Spirifera_ and _Productus mesolobus_ or\r\n  _costatus_, though it is possible that these fossils represent the\r\n  \"Ursa stage\" (Heer) of the Lower Carboniferous. A few Devonian forms\r\n  have also been recorded from the Parry Archipelago, and Nathorst has\r\n  shown the existence of Old Red Sandstone facies of Devonian in Traill\r\n  Island, Geographical Society Island, Ymer Island and Gauss Peninsula.\r\n\r\n  4. _Carboniferous._--In erratic blocks of sandstone, found on the\r\n  Disco shore of the Waigat have been detected a _Sigillaria_ and a\r\n  species of either _Pecopteris_ or _Gleichenia_, perhaps of this age;\r\n  and probably much of the extreme northern coast of Ellesmere Land, and\r\n  therefore, in all likelihood, the opposite Greenland shore, contains a\r\n  clearly developed Carboniferous Limestone fauna, identical with that\r\n  so widely distributed over the North American continent, and referable\r\n  also to British and Spitsbergen species. Of the Coal Measures above\r\n  these, if they occur, we know nothing at present. Capt. Feilden notes\r\n  as suggestive that, though the explorers have not met with this\r\n  formation on the northern shores of Greenland, yet it was observed\r\n  that a continuation of the direction of the known strike of the\r\n  limestones of Feilden peninsula, carried over the polar area, passes\r\n  through the neighbourhood of Spitsbergen, where the formation occurs,\r\n  and contains certain species identical with those of the Grinnell Land\r\n  rocks of this horizon. The facies of the fossils is, according to Mr\r\n  Etheridge, North American and Canadian, though many of the species are\r\n  British. The corals are few in number, but the _Molluscoida_\r\n  (_Polyzoa_) are more numerous in species and individuals. No Secondary\r\n  rocks have been discovered in the extreme northern parts of West\r\n  Greenland, but they are present on the east and west coasts in more\r\n  southerly latitudes than Smith Sound.\r\n\r\n  5. _Jurassic._--These do not occur on the west coast, but on the east\r\n  coast the German expedition discovered marls and sandstones on Kuhn\r\n  Island, resembling those of the Russian Jurassic, characterized by the\r\n  presence of the genus _Aucella_, _Olcostephanus Payeri_, _O.\r\n  striolaris_, _Belemnites Panderianus_, _B. volgensis_, _B. absolutus_,\r\n  and a _Cyprina_ near to _C. syssolae_. On the south coast of the same\r\n  island are coarse-grained, brownish micaceous and light-coloured\r\n  calcareous sandstone and marls, containing fossils, which render it\r\n  probable that they are of the same age as the coal-bearing Jurassic\r\n  rocks of Brora (Scotland) and the Middle Dogger of Yorkshire. There is\r\n  also coal on Kuhn Island.\r\n\r\n  The Danish expeditions of 1899-1900 have added considerably to our\r\n  knowledge of the Jurassic rocks of East Greenland. Rhaetic-Lias plants\r\n  have been described by Dr Hartz from Cape Stewart and Vardekloft. Dr\r\n  Madsen has recognized fossils that correspond with those from the\r\n  Inferior oolite, Cornbrash and Callovian of England. Upper Kimmeridge\r\n  and Portlandian beds also occur.\r\n\r\n  6. _Cretaceous._--Beds of this age, consisting of sandstones and coal,\r\n  are found on the northern coast of Disco Island and the southern side\r\n  of the Noursoak Peninsula, the beds in the former locality, \"the Kome\r\n  strata\" of Nordenskiold, being the oldest. They reach 1000 ft. in\r\n  thickness, occupying undulating hollows in the underlying gneiss, and\r\n  dip towards the Noursoak Peninsula at 20 deg., when the overlying\r\n  Atanakerdluk strata come in. Both these series contain numerous plant\r\n  remains, evergreen oaks, magnolias, aralias, &c., and seams of lignite\r\n  (coal), which is burnt; but in neither occur the marine beds of the\r\n  United States. Still, the presence of dicotyledonous leaves, such as\r\n  _Magnolia alternans_, in the Atanakerdluk strata, proves their close\r\n  alliance with the Dakota series of the United States. The underlying\r\n  Kome beds are not present in the American series. They are\r\n  characterized by fine cycads (_Zamites arcticus_ and _Glossozamites\r\n  Hoheneggeri_), which also occur in the Urgonian strata of Wernsdorff.\r\n\r\n  7. _Miocene._--This formation, one of the most widely spread in polar\r\n  lands, though the most local in Greenland, is also the best known\r\n  feature in its geology. It is limited to Disco Island, and perhaps to\r\n  a small part of the Noursoak Peninsula, and the neighbouring country,\r\n  and consists of numerous thin beds of sandstone, shale and coal--the\r\n  sideritic shale containing immense quantities of leaves, stems, fruit,\r\n  &c., as well as some insects, and the coal pieces of retinite. The\r\n  study of these plant and insect remains shows that forests containing\r\n  a vegetation very similar to that of California and the southern\r\n  United States, in some instances even the species of trees being all\r\n  but identical, flourished in 70 deg. N. during geological periods\r\n  comparatively recent. These beds, as well as the Cretaceous series,\r\n  from which they are as yet only imperfectly distinguished, are\r\n  associated with sheets of basalt, which penetrate them in great dikes,\r\n  and in some places, owing to the wearing away of the softer\r\n  sedimentary rocks, stand out in long walls running across the beds.\r\n  These Miocene strata have not been found farther north on the\r\n  Greenland shore than the region mentioned; but in Lady Franklin Bay,\r\n  on the Grinnell Land side of Smith Sound, they again appear, so that\r\n  the chances are they will be found on the opposite coast, though\r\n  doubtless the great disintegration Greenland has undergone and is\r\n  undergoing has destroyed many of the softer beds of fossiliferous\r\n  rocks. On the east coast, more particularly in Hochstetter Foreland,\r\n  the Miocene beds again appear, and we may add that there are traces of\r\n  them even on the west coast, between Sonntag Bay and Foulke Fjord, at\r\n  the entrance to Smith Sound. It thus appears that since early Tertiary\r\n  times there has been a great change in the climate of Greenland.\r\n\r\n  Nathorst has suggested that the whole of Greenland is a \"horst,\" in\r\n  the subordinate folds of which, as well as in the deeper \"graben,\" the\r\n  younger rocks are preserved, often with a covering of Tertiary or\r\n  later lava flows.[30]--J. A. H.]\r\n\r\n  _Minerals._--Native iron was found by Nordenskiold at Ovifak, on Disco\r\n  Island, in 1870, and brought to Sweden (1871) as meteorites. The\r\n  heaviest nodule weighed over 20 tons. Similar native iron has later\r\n  been found by K. J. V. Steenstrup in several places on the west coast\r\n  enclosed as smaller or larger nodules in the basalt. This iron has\r\n  very often beautiful Widmannstatten figures like those of iron\r\n  meteorites, but it is obviously of telluric origin.[31] In 1895 Peary\r\n  found native iron at Cape York; since John Ross's voyage in 1818 it\r\n  has been known to exist there, and from it the Eskimo got iron for\r\n  their weapons. In 1897 Peary brought the largest nodule to New York;\r\n  it was estimated to weigh nearly 100 tons. This iron is considered by\r\n  several of the first authorities on the subject to be of meteoric\r\n  origin,[32] but no evidence hitherto given seems to prove decisively\r\n  that it cannot be telluric. That the nodules found were lying on\r\n  gneissic rock, with no basaltic rocks in the neighbourhood, does not\r\n  prove that the iron may not originate from basalt, for the nodules may\r\n  have been transported by the glaciers, like other erratic blocks, and\r\n  will stand erosion much longer than the basalt, which may long ago\r\n  have disappeared. This iron seems, however, in several respects to be\r\n  unlike the celebrated large nodules of iron found by Nordenskiold at\r\n  Ovifak, but appears to resemble much more closely the softer kind of\r\n  iron nodules found by Steenstrup in the basalt;[33] it stands exposure\r\n  to the air equally well, and has similar Widmannstatten figures very\r\n  sharp, as is to be expected in such a large mass. It contains,\r\n  however, more nickel and also phosphorus. A few other minerals may be\r\n  noticed, and some have been worked to a small extent--graphite is\r\n  abundant, particularly near Upernivik; cryolite is found almost\r\n  exclusively at Ivigtut; copper has been observed at several places,\r\n  but only in nodules and laminae of limited extent; and coal of poor\r\n  quality is found in the districts about Disco Bay and Umanak Fjord.\r\n  Steatite or soapstone has long been used by the natives for the\r\n  manufacture of lamps and vessels.\r\n\r\n  _Climate._--The climate is very uncertain, the weather changing\r\n  suddenly from bright sunshine (when mosquitoes often swarm) to dense\r\n  fog or heavy falls of snow and icy winds. At Julianehaab in the\r\n  extreme south-west the winter is not much colder than that of Norway\r\n  and Sweden in the same locality; but its mean temperature for the\r\n  whole year probably approximates to that on the Norwegian coast 600 m.\r\n  farther north. The climate of the interior has been found to be of a\r\n  continental character, with large ranges of temperature, and with an\r\n  almost permanent anti-cyclonic region over the interior of the inland\r\n  ice, from which the prevailing winds radiate towards the coasts. On\r\n  the 64th parallel the mean annual temperature at an elevation of 6560\r\n  ft. is supposed to be -13 deg. F., or reduced to sea-level 5 deg. F.\r\n  The mean annual temperature in the interior farther north is supposed\r\n  to be -10 deg. F. reduced to sea-level. The mean temperature of the\r\n  warmest month, July, in the interior should be, reduced to sea-level,\r\n  on the 64th parallel 32 deg. F., and that of the coldest month,\r\n  January, about -22 deg. F., while in North Greenland it is probably\r\n  -40 deg. reduced to sea-level. Here we may probably find the lowest\r\n  temperatures of the northern hemisphere. The interior of Greenland\r\n  contains both summer and winter a pole of cold, situated in the\r\n  opposite longitude to that of Siberia, with which it is well able to\r\n  compete in extreme severity. On Nansen's expedition temperatures of\r\n  about -49 deg. F. were experienced during the nights in the beginning\r\n  of September, and the minimum during the winter may probably sink to\r\n  -90 deg. F. in the interior of the inland ice. These low temperatures\r\n  are evidently caused by the radiation of heat from the snow-surface in\r\n  the rarefied air in the interior. The daily range of temperature is\r\n  therefore very considerable, sometimes amounting to 40 deg. Such a\r\n  range is elsewhere found only in deserts, but the surface of the\r\n  inland ice may be considered to be an elevated desert of snow.[34] The\r\n  climate of the east coast is on the whole considerably more arctic\r\n  than that of the west coast on corresponding latitudes; the land is\r\n  much more completely snow-covered, and the snow-line goes considerably\r\n  lower. The probability also is that there is more precipitation, and\r\n  that the mean temperatures are lower.[35] The well-known strangely\r\n  warm and dry _fohn_-winds of Greenland occur both on the west and the\r\n  east coast; they are more local than was formerly believed, and are\r\n  formed by cyclonic winds passing either over mountains or down the\r\n  outer slope of the inland ice.[36] Mirage and similar phenomena and\r\n  the aurora are common.\r\n\r\n  _Fauna and Flora._--It was long a common belief that the fauna and\r\n  flora of Greenland were essentially European, a circumstance which\r\n  would make it probable that Greenland has been separated by sea from\r\n  America during a longer period of time than from Europe. The\r\n  correctness of this hypothesis may, however, be doubted. The land\r\n  mammals of Greenland are decidedly more American than European; the\r\n  musk-ox, the banded lemming (_Cuniculus torquatus_), the white polar\r\n  wolf, of which there seems to have been a new invasion recently round\r\n  the northern part of the country to the east coast, the Eskimo and the\r\n  dog--probably also the reindeer--have all come from America, while the\r\n  other land mammals, the polar bear, the polar fox, the Arctic hare,\r\n  the stoat (_Mustela erminea_), are perfectly circumpolar forms. The\r\n  species of seals and whales are, if anything, more American than\r\n  European, and so to some extent are the fishes. The bladder-nose seal\r\n  (_Cystophora cristata_), for instance, may be said to be a\r\n  Greenland-American species, while a Scandinavian species, such as the\r\n  grey seal (_Halichoerus grypus_), appears to be very rare both in\r\n  Greenland and America. Of the sixty-one species of birds breeding in\r\n  Greenland, eight are European-Asiatic, four are American, and the rest\r\n  circumpolar or North Atlantic and North Pacific in their\r\n  distribution.[37] About 310 species of vascular plants are found, of\r\n  which about forty species are American, forty-four European-Asiatic,\r\n  fifteen endemic, and the rest common both to America and Europe or\r\n  Asia. We thus see that the American and the European-Asiatic elements\r\n  of the flora are nearly equivalent; and if the flora of Arctic North\r\n  America were better known, the number of plants common to America\r\n  might be still more enlarged.[38]\r\n\r\n  In the south, a few goats, sheep, oxen and pigs have been introduced.\r\n  The whaling industry was formerly prolific off the west coast but\r\n  decayed when the right whale nearly disappeared. The white whale\r\n  fishery of the Eskimo, however, continued, and sealing is important;\r\n  walruses are also caught and sometimes narwhal. There are also\r\n  important fisheries for cod, caplin, halibut, red fish (_Sebastes_)\r\n  and _nepisak_ (_Cyclopterus lumpus_); a shark (_Somniosus\r\n  microcephalus_) is taken for the oil from its liver; and sea-trout are\r\n  found in the streams and small lakes of the south. On land reindeer\r\n  were formerly hunted, to their practical extinction in the south, but\r\n  in the districts of Godthaab, Sukkertoppen and Holstensborg there are\r\n  still many reindeer. The eider-duck, guillemot and other sea-birds are\r\n  in some parts valuable for food in winter, and so is the ptarmigan.\r\n  Eggs of sea-birds are collected and eider-down. Valuable fur is\r\n  obtained from the white and blue fox, the skin of the eider-duck and\r\n  the polar bear.\r\n\r\n  At Tasiusak (73 deg. 22' N.), the most northern civilized settlement\r\n  in the world, gardening has been attempted without success, but\r\n  several plants do well in forcing frames. At Umanak (70 deg. 40' N.)\r\n  is the most northern garden in the world. Broccoli and radishes grow\r\n  well, turnips (but not every year), lettuce and chervil succeed\r\n  sometimes, but parsley cannot be reared. At Jacobshavn (69 deg. 12'\r\n  N.), only some 15 m. from the inland ice, gardening succeeds very\r\n  well; broccoli and lettuce grow willingly; the spinach produces large\r\n  leaves; chervil, pepper-grass, leeks, parsley and turnips grow very\r\n  well; the radishes are sown and gathered twice during the summer (June\r\n  to August). In the south, in the Julianehaab district, even flowering\r\n  plants, such as aster, nemophilia and mignonette, are cultivated, and\r\n  broccoli, spinach, sorrel, chervil, parsley, rhubarb, turnips,\r\n  lettuce, radishes grow well. Potatoes give fair results when they are\r\n  taken good care of, carrots grow to a thickness of 1-1/2 in., while\r\n  cabbage does poorly. Strawberries and cucumbers have been ripened in a\r\n  forcing frame. In the \"Kongespeil\" (King's mirror) of the 13th century\r\n  it is stated that the old Norsemen tried in vain to raise barley.\r\n\r\n  The wild vegetation in the height of summer is, in favourable\r\n  situations, profuse in individual plants, though scanty in species.\r\n  The plants are of the usual arctic type, and identical with or allied\r\n  to those found in Lapland or on the summits of the highest British\r\n  hills. Forest there is none in all the country. In the north, where\r\n  the lichen-covered or ice-shaven rocks do not protrude, the ground is\r\n  covered with a carpet of mosses, creeping dwarf willows, crow-berries\r\n  and similar plants, while the flowers most common are the andromeda,\r\n  the yellow poppy, pedicularis, pyrola, &c. besides the flowering\r\n  mosses; but in South Greenland there is something in the shape of\r\n  bush, the dwarf birches even rising a few feet in very sheltered\r\n  places, the willows may grow higher than a man, and the vegetation is\r\n  less arctic and more abundant.\r\n\r\n_Government and Trade._--The trade of Greenland is a monopoly of the\r\nDanish crown, dating from 1774, and is administered in Copenhagen by a\r\ngovernment board (_Kongelige Gronlandske Handel_) and in the country by\r\nvarious government officials. In order to meet the double purposes of\r\ngovernment and trade the west coast, up to nearly 74 deg. N., is divided\r\ninto two inspectorates, the southern extending to 67 deg. 40' N., the\r\nnorthern comprising the rest of the country; the respective seats of\r\ngovernment being at Godthaab and Godhavn. These inspectorates are ruled\r\nby two superior officials or governors responsible to the director of\r\nthe board in Copenhagen. Each of the inspectorates is divided into\r\ndistricts, each district having, in addition to the chief settlement or\r\n_coloni_, several outlying posts and Eskimo hunting stations, each\r\npresided over by an _udligger_, who is responsible to the\r\n_coloni-bestyrer_, or superintendent of the district. These trading\r\nsettlements, which dot the coast for a distance of 1000 m., are about\r\nsixty in number. From the Eskimo hunting and fishing stations blubber is\r\nthe chief article received, and is forwarded in casks to the _coloni_,\r\nwhere it is boiled into oil, and prepared for being despatched to\r\nCopenhagen by means of the government ships which arrive and leave\r\nbetween May and November. For the rest of the year navigation is\r\nstopped, though the winter months form the busy seal-killing season. The\r\nprinciple upon which the government acts is to give the natives low\r\nprices for their produce, but to sell them European articles of\r\nnecessity at prime cost, and other stores, such as bread, at prices\r\nwhich will scarcely pay for the purchase and freight, while no\r\nmerchandise is charged, on an average, more than 20% over the cost price\r\nin Denmark. In addition the Greenlanders are allowed to order goods from\r\nprivate dealers on paying freight for them at the rate of 2-1/2d. per 10\r\nlb., or 1s. 6d. per cub. ft. The prices to be paid for European and\r\nnative articles are fixed every year, the prices current in Danish and\r\nEskimo being printed and distributed by the government. Out of the\r\npayment five-sixths are given to the sellers, and one-sixth devoted to\r\nthe Greenlanders' public fund, spent in \"public works,\" in charity, and\r\non other unforeseen contingencies. The object of the monopoly is solely\r\nfor the good of the Greenlanders--to prevent spirits being sold to them,\r\nand the vice, disease and misery which usually attend the collision\r\nbetween natives and civilization of the trader's type being introduced\r\ninto the primitive arctic community. The inspectors, in addition to\r\nbeing trade superintendents, are magistrates, but serious crime is very\r\nrare. Though the officials are all-powerful, local councils or\r\n_parsissaet_ were organized in 1857 in every district. To these parish\r\nparliaments delegates are sent from every station. These _parsissoks_,\r\nelected at the rate of about one representative to 120 voters, wear a\r\ncap with a badge (a bear rampant), and aid the European members of the\r\ncouncil in distributing the surplus profit apportioned to each district,\r\nand generally in advising as to the welfare of that part of Greenland\r\nunder their partial control. The municipal council has the disposal of\r\n20% of the annual profits made on produce purchased within the confines\r\nof each district. It holds two sessions every year, and the discussions\r\nare entirely in the Eskimo language. In addition to their functions as\r\nguardians of the poor, the parish members have to investigate crimes and\r\npunish misdemeanours, settle litigations and divide inheritances. They\r\ncan impose fines for small offences not worth sending before the\r\ninspector, and, in cases of high misdemeanour, have the power of\r\ninflicting corporal punishment.\r\n\r\nA Danish _coloni_ in Greenland might seem to many not to be a cheerful\r\nplace at best; though in the long summer days they would certainly find\r\nsome of those on the southern fjords comparatively pleasant. The fact\r\nis, however, that most people who ever lived some time in Greenland\r\nalways long to go back. There are generally in a _coloni_ three or four\r\nDanish houses, built of wood and pitched over, in addition to\r\nstorehouses and a blubber-boiling establishment. The Danish residents\r\nmay include, besides a _coloni-bestyrer_ and his assistant, a\r\n_missionair_ or clergyman, at a few places also a doctor, and perhaps a\r\ncarpenter and a schoolmaster. In addition there are generally from\r\ntwenty to several hundred Eskimo, who live in huts built of stone and\r\nturf, each entered by a short tunnel. Lately their houses in the\r\n_colonis_ have also to some extent been built of imported wood.\r\nFollowing the west coast northward, the trading centres are these: in\r\nthe south inspectorate, Julianehaab, near which are remains of the early\r\nNorse settlements of Eric the Red and his companions (the _Oster-Bygd_);\r\nFrederikshaab, in which district are the cryolite mines of Ivigtut;\r\nGodthaab, the principal settlement of all, in the neighbourhood of which\r\nare also early Norse remains (the _Vester-Bygd_); Sukkertoppen, a most\r\npicturesque locality; and Holstenborg. In the north inspectorate the\r\ncentres are: Egedesminde, on an islet at the mouth of Disco Bay;\r\nChristianshaab, one of the pleasantest settlements in the north, and\r\nJacobshavn, on the inner shores of the same bay; Godhavn (or Lievely) on\r\nthe south coast of Disco Island, formerly an important seat of the\r\nwhaling industry; Ritenbenk, Umanak, and, most northerly of all,\r\nUpernivik. On the east coast there is but one coloni, Angmagssalik, in\r\n65 deg. 30' N., only established in 1894. For ecclesiastical purposes\r\nDanish Greenland is reckoned in the province of the bishop of Zeeland.\r\nThe Danish mission in Greenland has a yearly grant of L2000 from the\r\ntrading revenue of the colony, besides a contribution of L880 from the\r\nstate. The Moravian mission, which had worked in Greenland for a century\r\nand a half, retired from the country in 1900. The trade of Greenland has\r\non the whole much decreased in modern times, and trading and missions\r\ncost the Danish state a comparatively large sum (about L11,000 every\r\nyear), although this is partly covered by the income from the royalty of\r\nthe cryolite mines at Ivigtut. There is, however, a yearly deficiency of\r\nmore than L6000. The decline in the value of the trade, which was\r\nformerly very profitable, has to a great extent been brought about by\r\nthe fall in the price of seal-oil. It might be expected that there\r\nshould be a decrease in the Greenland seal fisheries, caused by the\r\nEuropean and American sealers catching larger quantities every year,\r\nespecially along the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador, and so\r\nactually diminishing the number of the animals in the Greenland seas.\r\nThe statistics of South Greenland, however, do not seem to demonstrate\r\nany such decrease. The average number of seals killed annually is about\r\n33,000.[39] The annual value of imports, consisting of manufactured\r\ngoods, foodstuffs, &c., may be taken somewhat to exceed L40,000. The\r\nchief articles of export (together with those that have lapsed) have\r\nbeen already indicated; but they may be summarized as including\r\nseal-oil, seal, fox, bird and bear skins, fish products and eiderdown,\r\nwith some quantity of worked skins. Walrus tusks and walrus hides, which\r\nin the days of the old Norse settlements were the chief articles of\r\nexport, are now of little importance.\r\n\r\n_Population._--The area of the entire Danish colony is estimated at\r\n45,000 sq. m., and its population in 1901 was 11,893. The Europeans\r\nnumber about 300. The Eskimo population of Danish Greenland (west coast)\r\nseems to have decreased since the middle of the 18th century. Hans Egede\r\nestimated the population then at 30,000, but this is probably a large\r\nover-estimate. The decrease may chiefly have been due to infectious\r\ndiseases, especially a very severe epidemic of smallpox. During the last\r\nhalf of the 19th century there was on the whole a slight increase of the\r\nnative population. The population fluctuates a good deal, owing, to some\r\nextent, to an immigration of natives from the east to the west coast.\r\nThe population of the east coast seems on the whole to be decreasing in\r\nnumber, several hundreds chiefly living at Angmagssalik. In the north\r\npart of the east coast, in the region of Scoresby Fjord and Franz Josef\r\nFjord, numerous ruins of Eskimo settlements are found, and in 1823\r\nClavering met Eskimo there, but now they have either completely died out\r\nor have wandered south. A little tribe of Eskimo living in the region of\r\nCape York near Smith Sound--the so-called \"Arctic Highlanders\" or Smith\r\nSound Eskimo--number about 240.\r\n\r\n_History._--In the beginning of the 10th century the Norwegian\r\nGunnbjorn, son of Ulf Kraka, is reported to have found some islands to\r\nthe west of Iceland, and he may have seen, without landing upon it, the\r\nsouthern part of the east coast of Greenland. In 982 the Norwegian Eric\r\nthe Red sailed from Iceland to find the land which Gunnbjorn had seen,\r\nand he spent three years on its south-western coasts exploring the\r\ncountry. On his return to Iceland in 985 he called the land Greenland in\r\norder to make people more willing to go there, and reported so\r\nfavourably on its possibilities that he had no difficulty in obtaining\r\nfollowers. In 986 he started again from Iceland with 25 ships, but only\r\n14 of them reached Greenland, where a colony was founded on the\r\nsouth-west coast, in the present Julianehaab district. Eric built his\r\nhouse at Brattalid, near the inner end oi the fjord Tunugdliarfik, just\r\nnorth of the present Julianehaab. Other settlers followed and in a few\r\nyears two colonies had been formed, one called Osterbygd in the present\r\ndistrict of Julianehaab comprising later about 190 farms, and another\r\ncalled Vesterbygd farther north on the west coast in the present\r\ndistrict of Godthaab, comprising later about 90 farms. Numerous ruins in\r\nthe various fjords of these two districts indicate now where these\r\ncolonies were. Wooden coffins, with skeletons wrapped in coarse hairy\r\ncloth, and both pagan and Christian tombstones with runic inscriptions\r\nhave been found. On a voyage from Norway to Greenland Leif Ericsson (son\r\nof Eric the Red) discovered America in the year 1000, and a few years\r\nlater Torfinn Karlsefne sailed with three ships and about 150 men, from\r\nGreenland to Nova Scotia to form a colony, but returned three years\r\nlater (see VINLAND).\r\n\r\nWhen the Norsemen came to Greenland they found various remains\r\nindicating, as the old sagas say, that there had been people of a\r\nsimilar kind as those they met with in Vinland, in America, whom they\r\ncalled _Skraeling_ (the meaning of the word is uncertain, it means\r\npossibly weak people); but the sagas do not report that they actually\r\nmet the natives then. But somewhat later they have probably met with the\r\nEskimo farther north on the west coast in the neighbourhood of Disco\r\nBay, where the Norsemen went to catch seals, walrus, &c. The Norse\r\ncolonists penetrated on these fishing expeditions at least to 73 deg.\r\nN., where a small runic stone from the 14th century has been found. On a\r\nvoyage in 1267 they penetrated even still farther north into the\r\nMelville Bay.\r\n\r\nChristianity was introduced by Leif Ericsson at the instance of Olaf\r\nTrygvasson, king of Norway, in 1000 and following years. In the\r\nbeginning of the 12th century Greenland got its own bishop, who resided\r\nat Garolar, near the present Eskimo station Igoliko, on an isthmus\r\nbetween two fjords, Igaliksfjord (the old Einarsfjord) and Tunugdliarfik\r\n(the old Eriksfjord), inside the present colony Julianehaab. The Norse\r\ncolonies had twelve churches, one monastery and one nunnery in the\r\nOsterbygd, and four churches in the Vesterbygd. Greenland, like Iceland,\r\nhad a republican organization up to the years 1247 to 1261, when the\r\nGreenlanders were induced to swear allegiance to the king of Norway.\r\nGreenland belonged to the Norwegian crown till 1814, when, at the\r\ndissolution of the union between Denmark and Norway, neither it nor\r\nIceland and the Faeroes were mentioned, and they, therefore, were kept\r\nby the Danish king and thus came to Denmark. The settlements were called\r\nrespectively _Oster Bygd_ (or eastern settlement) and _Vester_ (western)\r\n_Bygd_, both being now known to be on the south and west coast (in the\r\ndistricts of Julianehaab and Godthaab respectively), though for long the\r\nview was persistently held that the first was on the east coast, and\r\nnumerous expeditions have been sent in search of these \"lost colonies\"\r\nand their imaginary survivors. These settlements at the height of their\r\nprosperity are estimated to have had 10,000 inhabitants, which, however,\r\nis an over-estimate, the number having probably been nearer one-half or\r\none-third of that number. The last bishop appointed to Greenland died in\r\n1540, but long before that date those appointed had never reached their\r\nsees; the last bishop who resided in Greenland died there in 1377. After\r\nthe middle of the 14th century very little is heard of the settlements,\r\nand their communication with the motherland, Norway, evidently gradually\r\nceased. This may have been due in great part to the fact that the\r\nshipping and trade of Greenland became a monopoly of the king of Norway,\r\nwho kept only one ship sailing at long intervals (of years) to\r\nGreenland; at the same time the shipping and trade of Norway came more\r\nand more in the hands of the Hanseatic League, which took no interest in\r\nGreenland. The last ship that is known to have visited the Norse colony\r\nin Greenland returned to Norway in 1410. With no support from home the\r\nsettlements seem to have decayed rapidly. It has been supposed that they\r\nwere destroyed by attacks of the Eskimo, who about this period seem to\r\nhave become more numerous and to have extended southwards along the\r\ncoast from the north. This seems a less feasible explanation; it is more\r\nprobable that the Norse settlers intermarried with the Eskimo and were\r\ngradually absorbed. About the end of the 15th or the beginning of the\r\n16th century it would appear that all Norse colonization had practically\r\ndisappeared. When in 1585 John Davis visited it there was no sign of any\r\npeople save the Eskimo, among whose traditions are a few directly\r\nrelating to the old Norsemen, and several traces of Norse influence.[40]\r\nFor more than two hundred years Greenland seems to have been neglected,\r\nalmost forgotten. It was visited by whalers, chiefly Dutch, but nothing\r\nin the form of permanent European settlements was established until the\r\nyear 1721, when the first missionary, the Norwegian clergyman Hans\r\nEgede, landed, and established a settlement near Godthaab. Amid many\r\nhardships and discouragements he persevered; and at the present day the\r\nnative race is civilized and Christianized. Many of the colonists of the\r\n18th century were convicts and other offenders; and in 1750 the trade\r\nbecame a monopoly in the hands of a private company. In 1733-1734 there\r\nwas a dreadful epidemic of smallpox, which destroyed a great number of\r\nthe people. In 1774 the trade ceased to be profitable as a private\r\nmonopoly, and to prevent it being abandoned the government took it over.\r\nJulianehaab was founded in the following year. In 1807-1814, owing to\r\nthe war, communication was cut off with Norway and Denmark; but\r\nsubsequently the colony prospered in a languid fashion.\r\n\r\n  _Authorities._--As to the discovery of Greenland by the Norsemen and\r\n  its early history see Konrad Maurer's excellent paper, \"Geschichte der\r\n  Entdeckung Ostgronlands\" in the report of _Die zweite deutsche\r\n  Nordpolarfahrt 1869-1870_ (Leipzig, 1874), vol. i.; G.

This act empowered the crown, by order in council, to put\r\n    its provisions in force, when any foreign state, whose ships or\r\n    subjects were engaged in the seal fishery in the area mentioned in\r\n    the schedule thereto, had made, or was about to make, similar\r\n    provisions with respect to its ships and subjects. An order in\r\n    council under the act, declaring the season to begin on the 3rd of\r\n    April in each year, was issued February 8, 1876. Rescinded February\r\n    15, 1876, it was re-enacted on November 28, 1876, and is still\r\n    operative.\r\n\r\n  [40] Cf. F. Nansen, _Eskimo Life_ (London, 1893).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENLAW (a \"grassy hill\"), a town of Berwickshire, Scotland. Pop.\r\n(1901) 611. It is situated on the Blackadder, 62-1/4 m. S.E. of\r\nEdinburgh by the North British railway company's branch line from Reston\r\nJunction to St Boswells. The town was built towards the end of the 17th\r\ncentury, to take the place of an older one, which stood about a mile to\r\nthe S.E. It was the county town from 1696 to 1853, when for several\r\nyears it shared this dignity with Duns, which, however, is now the sole\r\ncapital. The chief manufactures are woollens and agricultural\r\nimplements. About 3 m. to the S. the ruin of Hume Castle, founded in the\r\n13th century, occupies a commanding site. Captured by the English in\r\n1547, in spite of Lady Home's gallant defence, it was retaken two years\r\nafterwards, only to fall again in 1569. After its surrender to Cromwell\r\nin 1650 it gradually decayed. Towards the close of the 18th century the\r\n3rd earl of Marchmont had the walls rebuilt out of the old stones, and\r\nthe castle, though a mere shell of the original structure, is now a\r\npicturesque ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENLEAF, SIMON (1783-1853), American jurist, was born at Newburyport,\r\nMassachusetts, on the 5th of December 1783. When a child he was taken by\r\nhis father to Maine, where he studied law, and in 1806 began to practise\r\nat Standish. He soon removed to Gray, where he practised for twelve\r\nyears, and in 1818 removed to Portland. He was reporter of the supreme\r\ncourt of Maine from 1820 to 1832, and published nine volumes of _Reports\r\nof Cases in the Supreme Court of Maine_ (1822-1835). In 1833 he became\r\nRoyall professor, and in 1846 succeeded Judge Joseph Story as Dane\r\nprofessor of law in Harvard University; in 1848 he retired from his\r\nactive duties, and became professor emeritus. After being for many years\r\npresident of the Massachusetts Bible Society, he died at Cambridge,\r\nMass., on the 6th of October 1853. Greenleaf's principal work is a\r\n_Treatise on the Law of Evidence_ (3 vols., 1842-1853). He also\r\npublished _A Full Collection of Cases Overruled, Denied, Doubted, or\r\nLimited in their Application, taken from American and English Reports_\r\n(1821), and _Examination of the Testimony of the Four Evangelists by the\r\nRules of Evidence administered in the Courts of Justice, with an account\r\nof the Trial of Jesus_ (1846; London, 1847). He revised for the American\r\ncourts William Cruise's _Digest of Laws respecting Real Property_ (3\r\nvols., 1849-1850).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN MONKEY, a west African representative of the typical group of the\r\nguenon monkeys technically known as _Cercopithecus callitrichus_, taking\r\nits name from the olive-greenish hue of the fur of the back, which forms\r\na marked contrast to the white whiskers and belly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENOCK, a municipal and police burgh and seaport of Renfrewshire,\r\nScotland, on the southern shore of the Firth of Clyde, 23 m. W. by N. of\r\nGlasgow by the Caledonian and the Glasgow & South-Western railways, 21\r\nm. by the river and firth. Pop. (1901) 68,142. The town has a water\r\nfrontage of nearly 4 m. and rises gradually to the hills behind the town\r\nin which are situated, about 3 m. distant, Loch Thom and Loch Gryfe,\r\nfrom both of which is derived the water supply for domestic use, and for\r\ndriving several mills and factories. The streets are laid out on the\r\ncomparatively level tract behind the firth, the older thoroughfares and\r\nbuildings lying in the centre. The west end contains numerous handsome\r\nvillas and a fine esplanade, 1-1/2 m. long, running from Prince's Pier to\r\nFort Matilda, which is supplied with submarine mines for the defence of\r\nthe river. The capacious bay, formerly known as the Bay of St Lawrence\r\nfrom a religious house long since demolished, is protected by a sandbank\r\nthat ends here, and is hence known as the Tail of the Bank. The fairway\r\nbetween this bank, which begins to the west of Dumbarton, and the\r\nsouthern shore constitutes the safest anchorage in the upper firth.\r\nThere is a continuous line of electric tramways, connecting with Port\r\nGlasgow on the east and Gourock on the west, a total distance of 7-1/2 m.\r\nThe annual rainfall amounts to 64 in. and Greenock thus has the\r\nreputation of being the wettest town in Scotland.\r\n\r\nMany of the public buildings are fine structures. The municipal\r\nbuildings, an ornate example of Italian Renaissance, with a tower 244\r\nft. high, were opened in 1887. The custom house on the old steamboat\r\nquay, in classic style with a Doric portico, dates from 1818. The county\r\nbuildings (1867) have a tower and spire 112 ft. high. The Watt\r\nInstitution, founded in 1837 by a son of the famous engineer, James\r\nWatt, contains the public library (established in 1783), the Watt\r\nscientific library (presented in 1816 by Watt himself), and the marble\r\nstatue of James Watt by Sir Francis Chantrey. Adjoining it are the\r\nmuseum and lecture hall, the gift of James McLean, opened in 1876. Other\r\nbuildings are the sheriff court house, and the Spence Library, founded\r\nby the widow of William Spence the mathematician. In addition to\r\nnumerous board schools there are the Greenock academy for secondary\r\neducation, the technical college (1900), the school of art, and a school\r\nof navigation and engineering. The charitable institutions include the\r\ninfirmary; the cholera hospital; the eye infirmary; the fever reception\r\nhouse; Sir Gabriel Wood's mariners' asylum, an Elizabethan building\r\nerected in 1851 for the accommodation of aged merchant seamen; and the\r\nSmithson poorhouse and lunatic asylum, built beyond the southern\r\nboundary in 1879. Near Albert Harbour stands the old west now the north\r\nparish church (a Gothic edifice dating from 1591) containing some\r\nstained-glass windows by William Morris; in its kirkyard Burns's\r\n\"Highland Mary\" was buried (1786). The west parish church in Nicholson\r\nStreet (1839) is in the Italian Renaissance style and has a campanile.\r\nThe middle parish church (1759) in Cathcart Square is in the Classic\r\nstyle with a fine spire. Besides burial grounds near the infirmary and\r\nattached to a few of the older churches, a beautiful cemetery, 90 acres\r\nin extent, has been laid out in the south-western district. The parks\r\nand open spaces include Wellington Park, Well Park in the heart of the\r\ntown (these were the gift of Sir Michael Shaw-Stewart), Whin Hill, Lyle\r\nRoad--a broad drive winding over the heights towards Gourock,\r\nconstructed as a \"relief work\" in the severe winter of 1879-1880.\r\n\r\nGreenock is under the jurisdiction of a town council with provost and\r\nbailies. It is a parliamentary burgh, represented by one member. The\r\ncorporation owns the supplies of water (the equipment of works and\r\nreservoirs is remarkably complete), gas, electric light and power, and\r\nthe tramways (leased to a company). The staple industries are\r\nshipbuilding (established in 1760) and sugar refining (1765).\r\nGreenock-built vessels have always been esteemed, and many Cunard, P. &\r\nO. and Allan liners have been constructed in the yards. The town has\r\nbeen one of the chief centres of the sugar industry. Other important\r\nindustries include the making of boilers, steam-engines, locomotives,\r\nanchors, chain-cables, sailcloth, ropes, paper, woollen and worsted\r\ngoods, besides general engineering, an aluminium factory, a\r\nflax-spinning mill, distilleries and an oil-refinery. The seal and whale\r\nfisheries, once vigorously prosecuted, are extinct, but the\r\nfishing-fleets for the home waters and the Newfoundland grounds are\r\nconsiderable. Till 1772 the town leased the first harbour (finished in\r\n1710) from Sir John Shaw, the superior, but acquired it in that and the\r\nfollowing year, and a graving dock was opened in 1786. Since then\r\nadditions and improvements have been periodically in progress, and there\r\nare now several tidal harbours--among them Victoria harbour, Albert\r\nharbour, the west harbour, the east harbour, the northern tidal harbour,\r\nthe western tidal harbour, the great harbour and James Watt dock\r\n(completed in 1886 at a cost of L650,000 with an area of 2000 ft. by 400\r\nft. with a depth at low water of 32 ft.), Garvel graving dock and other\r\ndry docks. The quayage exceeds 100 acres in area and the quay walls are\r\nover 3 m. in length. Both the Caledonian and the Glasgow & South-Western\r\nrailways (in Prince's Pier the latter company possesses a landing-stage\r\nnearly 1400 ft. long) have access to the quays. From first to last the\r\noutlay on the harbour has exceeded L1,500,000.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier part of the 17th century Greenock was a fishing village,\r\nconsisting of one row of thatched cottages. A century later there were\r\nonly six slated houses in the place. In 1635 it was erected by Charles\r\nI. into a burgh of barony under a charter granted to John Shaw, the\r\ngovernment being administered by a baron-bailie, or magistrate,\r\nappointed by the superior. Its commercial prosperity received an\r\nenormous impetus from the Treaty of Union (1707), under which trade with\r\nAmerica and the West Indies rapidly developed. The American War of\r\nIndependence suspended progress for a brief interval, but revival set in\r\nin 1783, and within the following seven years shipping trebled in\r\namount. Meanwhile Sir John Shaw--to whom and to whose descendants, the\r\nShaw-Stewarts, the town has always been indebted--by charter (dated 1741\r\nand 1751) had empowered the householders to elect a council of nine\r\nmembers, which proved to be the most liberal constitution of any Scots\r\nburgh prior to the Reform Act of 1832, when Greenock was raised to the\r\nstatus of a parliamentary burgh with the right to return one member to\r\nparliament. Greenock was the birthplace of James Watt, William Spence\r\n(1777-1815) and Dr John Caird (1820-1898), principal of Glasgow\r\nUniversity, who died in the town and was buried in Greenock cemetery.\r\nJohn Galt, the novelist, was educated in Greenock, where he also served\r\nsome time in the custom house as a clerk. Rob Roy is said to have raided\r\nthe town in 1715.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENOCKITE, a rare mineral composed of cadmium sulphide, CdS, occurring\r\nas small, brilliant, honey-yellow crystals or as a canary-yellow powder.\r\nCrystals are hexagonal with hemimorphic development, being differently\r\nterminated at the two ends. The faces of the hexagonal prism and of the\r\nnumerous hexagonal pyramids are deeply striated horizontally. The\r\ncrystals are translucent to transparent, and have an adamantine to\r\nresinous lustre; hardness 3-3-1/2; specific gravity 4.9. Crystals have\r\nbeen found only in Scotland, at one or two places in the neighbourhood\r\nof Glasgow, where they occur singly on prehnite in the amygdaloidal\r\ncavities of basaltic igneous rocks--a rather unusual mode of occurrence\r\nfor a metallic sulphide. The first, and largest crystal (about 1/2 in.\r\nacross) was found, about the year 1810, in the dolerite quarry at\r\nBowling in Dumbartonshire, but this was thought to be blende. A larger\r\nnumber of crystals, but of smaller size, were found in 1840 during the\r\ncutting of the Bishopton tunnel on the Glasgow & Greenock railway; they\r\nwere detected by Lord Greenock, afterwards the 2nd earl of Cathcart,\r\nafter whom the mineral was named. A third locality is the Boyleston\r\nquarry near Barrhead. At all other localities--Przibram in Bohemia,\r\nLaurion in Greece, Joplin in Missouri, &c.--the mineral is represented\r\nonly as a powder dusted over the surface of zinc minerals, especially\r\nblende and calamine, which contain a small amount of cadmium replacing\r\nzinc.\r\n\r\nIsomorphous with greenockite is the hexagonal zinc sulphide (ZnS) known\r\nas wurtzite. Both minerals have been prepared artificially, and are not\r\nuncommon as furnace products. Previous to the recent discovery in\r\nSardinia of cadmium oxide as small octahedral crystals, greenockite was\r\nthe only known mineral containing cadmium as an essential constituent.\r\n     (L. J. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENORE, a seaport and watering-place of county Louth, Ireland,\r\nbeautifully situated at the north of Carlingford Lough on its western\r\nshore. It was brought to importance by the action of the London &\r\nNorth-Western railway company of England, which owns the pier and\r\nrailways joining the Great Northern system at Dundalk (12-1/2 m.) and\r\nNewry (14 m.). A regular service of passenger steamers controlled by\r\nthe company runs to Holyhead, Wales, 80 m. S.E. A steam ferry crosses\r\nthe Lough to Greencastle, for Kilkeel, and the southern watering-places\r\nof county Down. The company also owns the hotel, and laid out the golf\r\nlinks. In the vicinity a good example of raised beach, some 10 ft. above\r\npresent sea-level, is to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENOUGH, GEORGE BELLAS (1778-1855), English geologist, was born in\r\nLondon on the 18th of January 1778. He was educated at Eton, and\r\nafterwards (1795) entered Pembroke College, Oxford, but never graduated.\r\nIn 1798 he proceeded to Gottingen to prosecute legal studies, but having\r\nattended the lectures of Blumenbach he was attracted to the study of\r\nnatural history, and, coming into the possession of a fortune, he\r\nabandoned law and devoted his attention to science. He studied\r\nmineralogy at Freiburg under Werner, travelled in various parts of\r\nEurope and the British Isles, and worked at chemistry at the Royal\r\nInstitution. A visit to Ireland aroused deep interest in political\r\nquestions, and he was in 1807 elected member of parliament for the\r\nborough of Gatton, continuing to hold his seat until 1812. Meanwhile his\r\ninterest in geology increased, he was elected F.R.S. in 1807, and he was\r\nthe chief founder with others of the Geological Society of London in\r\n1807. He was the first chairman of that Society, and in 1811, when it\r\nwas more regularly constituted, he was the first president: and in this\r\ncapacity he served on two subsequent occasions, and did much to promote\r\nthe advancement of geology. In 1819 he published _A Critical Examination\r\nof the First Principles of Geology_, a work which was useful mainly in\r\nrefuting erroneous theories. In the same year was published his famous\r\n_Geological Map of England and Wales_, in six sheets; of which a second\r\nedition was issued in 1839. This map was to a large extent based on the\r\noriginal map of William Smith; but much new information was embodied. In\r\n1843 he commenced to prepare a geological map of India, which was\r\npublished in 1854. He died at Naples on the 2nd of April 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENOUGH, HORATIO (1805-1852), American sculptor, son of a merchant,\r\nwas born at Boston, on the 6th of September 1805. At the age of sixteen\r\nhe entered Harvard, but he devoted his principal attention to art, and\r\nin the autumn of 1825 he went to Rome, where he studied under\r\nThorwaldsen. After a short visit in 1826 to Boston, where he executed\r\nbusts of John Quincy Adams and other people of distinction, he returned\r\nto Italy and took up his residence at Florence. Here one of his first\r\ncommissions was from James Fenimore Cooper for a group of Chanting\r\nCherubs; and he was chosen by the American government to execute the\r\ncolossal statue of Washington for the national capital. It was unveiled\r\nin 1843, and was really a fine piece of work for its day; but in modern\r\ntimes it has been sharply criticized as unworthy and incongruous.\r\nShortly afterwards he received a second government commission for a\r\ncolossal group, the \"Rescue,\" intended to represent the conflict between\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon and Indian races. In 1851 he returned to Washington to\r\nsuperintend its erection, and in the autumn of 1852 he was attacked by\r\nbrain fever, of which he died in Somerville near Boston on the 18th of\r\nDecember. Among other works of Greenough may be mentioned a bust of\r\nLafayette, the Medora and the Venus Victrix in the gallery of the Boston\r\nAthenaeum. Greenough was a man of wide culture, and wrote well both in\r\nprose and verse.\r\n\r\n  See H. T. Tuckerman, _Memoir of Horatio Greenough_ (New York, 1853).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENOUGH, JAMES BRADSTREET (1833-1901), American classical scholar, was\r\nborn in Portland, Maine, on the 4th of May 1833. He graduated at Harvard\r\nin 1856, studied one year at the Harvard Law School, was admitted to the\r\nMichigan bar, and practised in Marshall, Michigan, until 1865, when he\r\nwas appointed tutor in Latin at Harvard. In 1873 he became assistant\r\nprofessor, and in 1883 professor of Latin, a post which he resigned\r\nhardly six weeks before his death at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the\r\n11th of October 1901. Following the lead of Goodwin's _Moods and Tenses_\r\n(1860), he set himself to study Latin historical syntax, and in 1870\r\npublished _Analysis of the Latin Subjunctive_, a brief treatise,\r\nprivately printed, of much originality and value, and in many ways\r\ncoinciding with Berthold Delbruck's _Gebrauch des Conjunctivs und\r\nOptativs in Sanskrit und Griechischen_ (1871), which, however, quite\r\novershadowed the Analysis. In 1872 appeared _A Latin Grammar for Schools\r\nand Colleges, founded on Comparative Grammar_, by Joseph A. Allen and\r\nJames B. Greenough, a work of great critical carefulness. His theory of\r\n_cum_-constructions is that adopted and developed by William Gardner\r\nHale. In 1872-1880 Greenough offered the first courses in Sanskrit and\r\ncomparative philology given at Harvard. His fine abilities for advanced\r\nscholarship were used outside the classroom in editing the Allen and\r\nGreenough Latin Series of text-books, although he occasionally\r\ncontributed to _Harvard Studies in Classical Philology_ (founded in 1889\r\nand endowed at his instance by his own class) papers on Latin syntax,\r\nprosody and etymology--a subject on which he planned a long work--on\r\nRoman archaeology and on Greek religion at the time of the New Comedy.\r\nHe assisted largely in the founding of Radcliffe College. An able\r\nEnglish scholar and an excellent etymologist, he collaborated with\r\nProfessor George L. Kittredge on _Words and their Ways in English\r\nSpeech_ (1901), one of the best books on the subject in the language. He\r\nwrote clever light verse, including _The Blackbirds_, a comedietta,\r\nfirst published in _The Atlantic Monthly_ (vol. xxxix. 1877); _The Rose\r\nand the Ring_ (1880), a pantomime adapted from Thackeray; _The Queen of\r\nHearts_ (1885), a dramatic fantasia; and _Old King Cole_ (1889), an\r\noperetta.\r\n\r\n  See the sketch by George L. Kittredge in _Harvard Studies in Classical\r\n  Philology_, vol. xiv. (1903). pp. 1-17 (also printed in _Harvard\r\n  Graduates' Magazine_, vol. x., Dec. 1901, pp. 196-201).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN RIBBON CLUB, one of the earliest of the loosely combined\r\nassociations which met from time to time in London taverns or\r\ncoffee-houses for political purposes in the 17th century. It had its\r\nmeeting-place at the King's Head tavern at Chancery Lane End, and was\r\ntherefore known as the \"King's Head Club.\" It seems to have been founded\r\nabout the year 1675 as a resort for members of the political party\r\nhostile to the court, and as these associates were in the habit of\r\nwearing in their hats a bow, or \"bob,\" of green ribbon, as a\r\ndistinguishing badge useful for the purpose of mutual recognition in\r\nstreet brawls, the name of the club became changed, about 1679, to the\r\nGreen Ribbon Club. The frequenters of the club were the extreme faction\r\nof the country party, the men who supported Titus Oates, and who were\r\nconcerned in the Rye House Plot and Monmouth's rebellion. Roger North\r\ntells us that \"they admitted all strangers that were confidingly\r\nintroduced, for it was a main end of their institutions to make\r\nproselytes, especially of the raw estated youth newly come to town.\"\r\nAccording to Dryden (_Absalom and Achitophel_) drinking was the chief\r\nattraction, and the members talked and organized sedition over their\r\ncups. Thomas Dangerfield supplied the court with a list of forty-eight\r\nmembers of the Green Ribbon Club in 1679; and although Dangerfield's\r\nnumerous perjuries make his unsupported evidence worthless, it receives\r\nconfirmation as regards several names from a list given to James II. by\r\nNathan Wade in 1885 (_Harleian MSS._ 6845), while a number of more\r\neminent personages are mentioned in _The Cabal_, a satire published in\r\n1680, as also frequenting the club. From these sources it would appear\r\nthat the duke of Monmouth himself, and statesmen like Halifax,\r\nShaftesbury, Buckingham, Macclesfield, Cavendish, Bedford, Grey of\r\nWarke, Herbert of Cherbury, were among those who fraternized at the\r\nKing's Head Tavern with third-rate writers such as Scroop, Mulgrave and\r\nShadwell, with remnants of the Cromwellian regime like Falconbridge,\r\nHenry Ireton and Claypole, with such profligates as Lord Howard of\r\nEscrik and Sir Henry Blount, and with scoundrels of the type of\r\nDangerfield and Oates. An allusion to Dangerfield, notorious among his\r\nother crimes and treacheries for a seditious paper found in a meal-tub,\r\nis found in connexion with the club in _The Loyal Subjects' Litany_, one\r\nof the innumerable satires of the period, in which occur the lines:\r\n\r\n  \"From the dark-lanthorn Plot, and the Green Ribbon Club\r\n   From brewing sedition in a sanctified Tub,\r\n            _Libera nos, Domine_.\"\r\n\r\nThe club was the headquarters of the Whig opposition to the court, and\r\nits members were active promoters of conspiracy and sedition. The\r\npresident was either Lord Shaftesbury or Sir Robert Peyton, M.P. for\r\nMiddlesex, who afterwards turned informer. The Green Ribbon Club served\r\nboth as a debating society and an intelligence department for the Whig\r\nfaction. Questions under discussion in parliament were here threshed out\r\nby the members over their tobacco and ale; the latest news from\r\nWestminster or the city was retailed in the tavern, \"for some or others\r\nwere continually coming and going,\" says Roger North, \"to import or\r\nexport news and stories.\" Slander of the court or the Tories was\r\ninvented in the club and sedulously spread over the town, and measures\r\nwere there concerted for pushing on the Exclusion Bill, or for promoting\r\nthe pretensions of the duke of Monmouth. The popular credulity as to\r\nCatholic outrages in the days of the Popish Plot was stimulated by the\r\nscandalmongers of the club, whose members went about in silk armour,\r\nsupposed to be bullet proof, \"in which any man dressed up was as safe as\r\na house,\" says North, \"for it was impossible to strike him for\r\nlaughing\"; while in their pockets, \"for street and crowd-work,\" they\r\ncarried the weapon of offence invented by Stephen College and known as\r\nthe \"Protestant Flail.\"\r\n\r\nThe genius of Shaftesbury found in the Green Ribbon Club the means of\r\nconstructing the first systematized political organization in England.\r\nNorth relates that \"every post conveyed the news and tales legitimated\r\nthere, as also the malign constructions of all the good actions of the\r\ngovernment, especially to places where elections were depending, to\r\nshape men's characters into fit qualifications to be chosen or\r\nrejected.\" In the general election of January and February 1679 the Whig\r\ninterest throughout the country was managed and controlled by a\r\ncommittee sitting at the club in Chancery Lane. The club's organizing\r\nactivity was also notably effective in the agitation of the Petitioners\r\nin 1679. This celebrated movement was engineered from the Green Ribbon\r\nClub with all the skill and energy of a modern caucus. The petitions\r\nwere prepared in London and sent down to every part of the country,\r\nwhere paid canvassers took them from house to house collecting\r\nsignatures with an air of authority that made refusal difficult. The\r\ngreat \"pope-burning\" processions in 1680 and 1681, on the anniversary of\r\nQueen Elizabeth's accession, were also organized by the club. They ended\r\nby the lighting of a huge bon-fire in front of the club windows; and as\r\nthey proved an effective means of inflaming the religious passions of\r\nthe populace, it was at the Green Ribbon Club that the _mobile vulgus_\r\nfirst received the nickname of \"the mob.\" The activity of the club was,\r\nhowever, short-lived. The failure to carry the Exclusion Bill, one of\r\nthe favourite projects of the faction, was a blow to its influence,\r\nwhich declined rapidly after the flight of Shaftesbury, the confiscation\r\nof the city of London's charter, and the discovery of the Rye House\r\nPlot, in which many of its members were implicated. In 1685 John\r\nAyloffe, who was found to have been \"a clubber at the King's Head Tavern\r\nand a green-ribon man,\" was executed in front of the premises on the\r\nspot where the \"pope-burning\" bon-fires had been kindled; and although\r\nthe tavern was still in existence in the time of Queen Anne, the Green\r\nRibbon Club which made it famous did not survive the accession of James\r\nII. The precise situation of the King's Head Tavern, described by North\r\nas \"over against the Inner Temple Gate,\" was at the corner of Fleet\r\nStreet and Chancery Lane, on the east side of the latter thoroughfare.\r\n\r\n  See Sir George Sitwell, _The First Whig_ (Scarborough, 1894),\r\n  containing an illustration of the Green Ribbon Club and a pope-burning\r\n  procession; Roger North, _Examen_ (London, 1740); Anchitell Grey,\r\n  _Debates of the House of Commons_, 1667-1684, vol. viii. (10 vols.,\r\n  London, 1769); Sir John Bramston, _Autobiography_ (Camden Soc.,\r\n  London, 1845).     (R. J. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENSAND, in geology, the name that has been applied to no fewer than\r\nthree distinct members of the Cretaceous System, viz. the Upper\r\nGreensand (see GAULT), the Lower Greensand and the so-called Cambridge\r\nGreensand, a local phase of the base of the Chalk (q.v.). The term was\r\nintroduced by the early English geologists for certain sandy rocks which\r\nfrequently exhibited a greenish colour on account of the presence of\r\nminute grains of the green mineral glauconite. Until the fossils of\r\nthese rocks came to be carefully studied there was much confusion\r\nbetween what is now known as the Upper Greensand (Selbornian) and the\r\nLower Greensand. Here we shall confine our attention to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Greensand was first examined in detail by W. H. Fitton\r\n(_Q.J.G.S._ iii., 1847), who, in 1845, had proposed the name \"Vectine\"\r\nfor the formation. The name was revived under the form \"Vectian\" in 1885\r\nby A. J. Jukes-Browne, because, although sands and sandstones prevail,\r\nthe green colour has often changed by oxidation of the iron to various\r\nshades of red and brown, and other lithological types, clays and\r\nlimestones represent this horizon in certain areas. The Lower Greensand\r\nis typically developed in the Wealden district, in the Isle of Wight, in\r\nDorsetshire about Swanage, and it appears again beneath the northern\r\noutcrop of the Chalk in Berkshire, Oxfordshire and Bedfordshire, and\r\nthence it is traceable through Norfolk and Lincolnshire into east\r\nYorkshire. It rests conformably upon the Wealden formation in the south\r\nof England, but it is clearly separable from the beds beneath by the\r\noccurrence of marine fossils, and by the fact that there is a marked\r\noverlap of the Lower Greensand on the Weald in Wiltshire, and derived\r\npebbles are found in the basal beds. The whole series is 800 ft. thick\r\nat Atherfield in the Isle of Wight, but it thins rapidly westward. It is\r\nusually clearly marked off from the overlying Gault.\r\n\r\nIn the Wealden area the Lower Greensand has been subdivided as follows,\r\nalthough the several members are not everywhere recognizable:--\r\n\r\n                                           Isle of Wight.\r\n  Folkestone Beds (70-100 ft.)    Carstone and Sand rock series.\r\n  Sandgate Beds (75-100 ft.)      Ferruginous Sands (Shanklin sands).\r\n  Hythe Beds (80-300 ft.)         Ferruginous Sands (Walpen sands).\r\n  Atherfield Clay (20-90 ft.)     Atherfield Clay.\r\n\r\nThe Atherfield Clay is usually a sandy clay, fossiliferous. The basal\r\nportion, 5-6 ft., is known as the \"Perna bed\" from the abundance of\r\n_Perna Mulleti_; other fossils are _Hoplites Deshayesii_, _Exogyra\r\nsinuata_, _Ancyloceras Mathesonianum_. The Hythe beds are\r\ninterstratified thin limestones and sandstones; the former are\r\nbluish-grey in colour, compact and hard, with a certain amount of quartz\r\nand glauconite. The limestone is known locally as \"rag\"; the Kentish Rag\r\nhas been largely employed as a building stone and roadstone; it\r\nfrequently contains layers of chert (known as Sevenoaks stone near that\r\ntown). The sandy portions are very variable; the stone is often clayey\r\nand calcareous and rarely hard enough to make a good building stone;\r\nlocally it is called \"hassock\" (or Calkstone). The two stones are well\r\nexposed in the Iguanodon Quarry near Maidstone (so called from the\r\ndiscovery of the bones of that reptile). Southwest of Dorking sandstone\r\nand grit become more prevalent, and it is known there as \"Bargate\r\nstone,\" much used around Godalming. Pulborough stone is another local\r\nsandstone of the Hythe beds. Fuller's earth occurs in parts of this\r\nformation in Surrey. The Sandgate beds, mainly dark, argillaceous sand\r\nand clay, are well developed in east Kent, and about Midhurst,\r\nPulborough and Petworth. At Nutfield the celebrated fuller's earth\r\ndeposits occur on this horizon; it is also found near Maidstone, at\r\nBletchingley and Red Hill. The Folkestone beds are light-coloured,\r\nrather coarse sands, enclosing layers of siliceous limestone (Folkestone\r\nstone) and chert; a phosphatic bed is found near the top. These beds are\r\nwell seen in the cliffs at Folkestone and near Reigate. At Ightham there\r\nis a fine, hard, white sandstone along with a green, quartzitic variety\r\n(Ightham stone). In Sussex the limestone and chert are usually lacking,\r\nbut a ferruginous grit, \"carstone,\" occurs in lenticular masses and\r\nlayers, which is used for road metal at Pulborough, Fittleworth, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Greensand usually forms picturesque, healthy country, as about\r\nLeith Hill, Hindhead, Midhurst, Petworth, at Woburn, or at Shanklin and\r\nSandown in the Isle of Wight. Outside the southern area the Lower\r\nGreensand is represented by the Faringdon sponge-bearing beds in\r\nBerkshire, the Sandy and Potton beds in Bedfordshire, the Shotover iron\r\nsands of Oxfordshire, the sands and fuller's earth of Woburn, the\r\nLeighton Buzzard sands, the brick clays of Snettisham, and perhaps the\r\nSandringham sands of Norfolk, and the carstone of that county and\r\nLincolnshire. The upper ironstone, limestone and clay of the\r\nLincolnshire Tealby beds appear to belong to this horizon along with the\r\nupper part of the Speeton beds of Yorkshire. The sands of the Lower\r\nGreensand are largely employed for the manufacture of glass, for which\r\npurpose they are dug at Aylesford, Godstone, near Reigate, Hartshill,\r\nnear Aylesbury and other places; the ferruginous sand is worked as an\r\niron ore at Seend.\r\n\r\nThis formation is continuous across the channel into France, where it is\r\nwell developed in Boulonnais. According to the continental\r\nclassification the Atherfield Clay is equivalent to the Urgonian or\r\nBarremian; the Sandgate and Hythe beds belong to the Aptian (q.v.);\r\nwhile the upper part of the Folkestone beds would fall within the lower\r\nAlbian (q.v.).\r\n\r\n  See the _Memoirs of the Geological Survey_, \"Geology of the Weald\"\r\n  (1875), \"Geology of the Isle of Wight\" (2nd ed., 1889), \"Geology of\r\n  the Isle of Purbeck\" (1898); and the _Record of Excursions_,\r\n  Geologists' Association (London, 1891).

(1890) 3317, (1900)\r\n10,035, of whom 4086 were negroes; (1910 census), 15,895. Greensboro is\r\nserved by several lines of the Southern railway. It is situated in the\r\nPiedmont region of the state and has an excellent climate. The city is\r\nthe seat of the State Normal and Industrial College (1892) for girls; of\r\nthe Greensboro Female College (Methodist Episcopal, South; chartered in\r\n1838 and opened in 1846), of which the Rev. Charles F. Deems was\r\npresident in 1850-1854, and which, owing to the burning of its\r\nbuildings, was suspended from 1863 to 1874; and of two institutions for\r\nnegroes--a State Agricultural and Mechanical College, and Bennett\r\nCollege (Methodist Episcopal, co-educational, 1873). Another school for\r\nnegroes, Immanuel Lutheran College (Evangelical Lutheran,\r\nco-educational), was opened at Concord, N.C., in 1903, was removed to\r\nGreensboro in 1905, and in 1907 was established at Lutherville, E. of\r\nGreensboro. About 6 m. W. of Greensboro is Guilford College\r\n(co-educational; Friends), founded as \"New Garden Boarding School\" in\r\n1837 and rechartered under its present name in 1888. Greensboro has a\r\nCarnegie library, St Leo hospital and a large auditorium. It is the\r\nshipping-point for an agricultural, lumbering and trucking region, among\r\nwhose products Indian corn, tobacco and cotton are especially important;\r\nis an important insurance centre; has a large wholesale trade; and has\r\nvarious manufactures, including cotton goods[1] (especially blue denim),\r\ntobacco and cigars, lumber, furniture, sash, doors and blinds,\r\nmachinery, foundry products and terra-cotta. The value of the factory\r\nproducts increased from $925,411 in 1900 to $1,828,837 in 1905, or\r\n97.6%. The municipality owns and operates the water-works. Greensboro\r\nwas named in honour of General Nathanael Greene, who on the 15th of\r\nMarch 1781 fought with Cornwallis the battle of Guilford Court House,\r\nabout 6 m. N.W. of the city, where there is now a Battle-Ground Park of\r\n100 acres (including Lake Wilfong); this park contains a Revolutionary\r\nmuseum, and twenty-nine monuments, including a Colonial Column, an arch\r\n(1906) in memory of Brig.-General Francis Nash (1720-1777), of North\r\nCarolina, who died in October 1777 of wounds received at Germantown, and\r\nDavidson Arch (1905), in honour of William Lee Davidson (1746-1781), a\r\nbrigadier-general of North Carolina troops, who was killed at Catawba\r\nand in whose honour Davidson College, at Davidson, N.C., was named.\r\nGreensboro was founded and became the county-seat in 1808, was organized\r\nas a town in 1829, and was first chartered as a city in 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] One of the first cotton mills in the South and probably the first\r\n    in this state was established at Greensboro in 1832. It closed about\r\n    20 years afterwards, and in 1889 new mills were built. Three very\r\n    large mills were built in the decade after 1895, and three mill\r\n    villages, Proximity, Revolution and White Oak, named from these three\r\n    mills, lie immediately N. of the city; in 1908 their population was\r\n    estimated at 8000. The owners of these mills maintain schools for the\r\n    children of operatives and carry on \"welfare work\" in these villages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENSBURG, a borough and the county-seat of Westmoreland county,\r\nPennsylvania, U.S.A., 31 m. E.S.E. of Pittsburg. Pop. (1890) 4202;\r\n(1900) 6508 (484 foreign-born); (1910) 5420. It is served by two lines\r\nof the Pennsylvania railway. It is an important coal centre, and\r\nmanufactures engines, iron and brass goods, flour, lumber and bricks. In\r\naddition to its public school system, it has several private schools,\r\nincluding St Mary's Academy and St Joseph's Academy, both Roman\r\nCatholic. About 3 m. N.E. of what is now Greensburg stood the village of\r\nHanna's Town, settled about 1770 and almost completely destroyed by the\r\nIndians on the 13th of July 1782; here what is said to have been the\r\nfirst court held west of the Alleghanies opened on the 6th of April\r\n1773, and the county courts continued to be held here until 1787.\r\nGreensburg was settled in 1784-1785, immediately after the opening of\r\nthe state road, not far from the trail followed by General John Forbes\r\non his march to Fort Duquesne in 1758; it was made the county-seat in\r\n1787, and was incorporated in 1799. In 1905 the boroughs of Ludwick\r\n(pop. in 1900, 901), East Greensburg (1050), and South-east Greensburg\r\n(620) were merged with Greensburg.\r\n\r\n  See John N. Boucher's _History of Westmoreland County, Pa._ (3 vols.,\r\n  New York, 1906).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENSHANK, one of the largest of the birds commonly known as\r\nsandpipers, the _Totanus glottis_ of most ornithological writers. Some\r\nexercise of the imagination is however needed to see in the dingy\r\nolive-coloured legs of this species a justification of the English name\r\nby which it goes, and the application of that name, which seems to be\r\ndue to Pennant, was probably by way of distinguishing it from two allied\r\nbut perfectly distinct species of _Totanus_ (_T. calidris_ and _T.\r\nfuscus_) having red legs and usually called redshanks. The greenshank is\r\na native of the northern parts of the Old World, but in winter it\r\nwanders far to the south, and occurs regularly at the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nin India and thence throughout the Indo-Malay Archipelago to Australia.\r\nIt has also been recorded from North America, but its appearance there\r\nmust be considered accidental. Almost as bulky as a woodcock, it is of a\r\nmuch more slender build, and its long legs and neck give it a graceful\r\nappearance, which is enhanced by the activity of its actions. Disturbed\r\nfrom the moor or marsh, where it has its nest, it rises swiftly into the\r\nair, conspicuous by its white back and rump, and uttering shrill cries\r\nflies round the intruder. It will perch on the topmost bough of a tree,\r\nif a tree be near, to watch his proceedings, and the cock exhibits all\r\nthe astounding gesticulations in which the males of so many other\r\n_Limicolae_ indulge during the breeding-season--with certain variations,\r\nhowever, that are peculiarly its own. It breeds in no small numbers in\r\nthe Hebrides, and parts of the Scottish Highlands from Argyllshire to\r\nSutherland, as well as in the more elevated or more northern districts\r\nof Norway, Sweden and Finland, and probably also thence to Kamchatka. In\r\nNorth America it is represented by two species, _Totanus semipalmatus_\r\nand _T. melanoleucus_, there called willets, telltales or tattlers,\r\nwhich in general habits resemble the greenshank of the Old World.\r\n     (A. N.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENVILLE, a city and the county-seat of Washington county,\r\nMississippi, U.S.A., on the E. bank of the Mississippi river, about 75\r\nm. N. of Vicksburg. Pop. (1890) 6658; (1900) 7642 (4987 negroes); (1910)\r\n9610. Greenville is served by the Southern and the Yazoo & Mississippi\r\nValley railways, and by various passenger and freight steamboat lines on\r\nthe Mississippi river. It is situated in the centre of the Yazoo Delta,\r\na rich cotton-producing region, and its industries are almost\r\nexclusively connected with that staple. There are large warehouses,\r\ncompresses and gins, extensive cotton-seed oil works and sawmills. Old\r\nGreenville, about 1 m. S. of the present site, was the county seat of\r\nJefferson county until 1825 (when Fayette succeeded it), and later\r\nbecame the county-seat of Washington county. Much of the old town caved\r\ninto the river, and during the Civil War it was burned by the Federal\r\nforces soon after the capture of Memphis. The present site was then\r\nadopted. The town of Greenville was incorporated in 1870; in 1886 it was\r\nchartered as a city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENVILLE, a city and the county-seat of Darke county, Ohio, U.S.A., on\r\nGreenville Creek, 36 m. N.W. of Dayton. Pop. (1900) 5501; (1910) 6237.\r\nIt is served by the Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Chicago & St Louis and the\r\nCincinnati Northern railways, and by interurban electric railways. It is\r\nsituated about 1050 ft. above sea-level and is the trade centre of a\r\nlarge and fertile agricultural district, producing cereals and tobacco.\r\nIt manufactures lumber, foundry products, canned goods and creamery\r\nproducts and has grain elevators and tobacco warehouses. In the city is\r\na Carnegie library, and 3 m. distant there is a county Children's Home\r\nand Infirmary. The municipality owns and operates its water-works.\r\nGreenville occupies the site of an Indian village and of Fort Greenville\r\n(built by General Anthony Wayne in 1793 and burned in 1796). Here, on\r\nthe 3rd of August 1795, General Wayne, the year after his victory over\r\nthe Indians at Fallen Timbers, concluded with them the treaty of\r\nGreenville, the Indians agreeing to a cessation of hostilities and\r\nceding to the United States a considerable portion of Ohio and a number\r\nof small tracts in Indiana, Illinois and Michigan (including the sites\r\nof Sandusky, Toledo, Defiance, Fort Wayne, Detroit, Mackinac, Peoria and\r\nChicago), and the United States agreeing to pay to the Indians $20,000\r\nworth of goods immediately and an annuity of goods, valued at $9500, for\r\never. The tribes concerned were the Wyandots, the Delawares, the\r\nShawnees, the Ottawas, the Chippewas, the Pottawatomies, the Miamis, the\r\nWeeas, the Kickapoos, the Piankashas, the Kaskaskias and the Eel-river\r\ntribe. Tecumseh lived at Greenville from 1805 to 1809, and a second\r\nIndian treaty was negotiated there in July 1814 by General W. H.\r\nHarrison and Lewis Cass, by which the Wyandots, the Delawares, the\r\nShawnees, the (Ohio) Senecas and the Miamis agreed to aid the United\r\nStates in the war with Great Britain. The first permanent white\r\nsettlement of Greenville was established in 1808 and the town was laid\r\nout in the same year. It was made the county-seat of the newly erected\r\ncounty in 1809, was incorporated as a town in 1838 and chartered as a\r\ncity in 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENVILLE, a city and the county-seat of Greenville county, South\r\nCarolina, U.S.A., on the Reedy river, about 140 m. N.W. of Columbia, in\r\nthe N.W. part of the state. Pop. (1890) 8607; (1900) 11,860, of whom\r\n5414 were negroes; (1910, census) 15,741. It is served by the Southern,\r\nthe Greenville & Knoxville and the Charleston & Western Carolina\r\nrailways. It lies 976 ft. above sea-level, near the foot of the Blue\r\nRidge Mountains, its climate and scenery attracting summer visitors. It\r\nis in an extensive cotton-growing and cotton-manufacturing district.\r\nGreenville's chief interest is in cotton, but it has various other\r\nmanufactures, including carriages, wagons, iron and fertilizers. The\r\ntotal value of the factory products of the city in 1905 was $1,676,774,\r\nan increase of 73.5% since 1900. The city is the seat of Furman\r\nUniversity, Chicora College for girls (1893; Presbyterian), and\r\nGreenville Female College (1854; Baptist), which in 1907-1908 had 379\r\nstudents, and which, besides the usual departments, has a conservatory\r\nof music, a school of art, a school of expression and physical culture\r\nand a kindergarten normal training school. Furman University (Baptist;\r\nopened in 1852) grew out of the \"Furman Academy and Theological\r\nInstitution,\" opened at Edgefield, S.C., in 1827, and named in honour of\r\nRichard Furman (1755-1825), a well-known Baptist clergyman of South\r\nCarolina, whose son, James C. Furman (1809-1891), was long president of\r\nthe University. In 1907-1908 the university had a faculty of 15 and 250\r\nstudents, of whom 101 were in the Furman Fitting School. Greenville was\r\nlaid out in 1797, was originally known as Pleasantburg and was first\r\nchartered as a city in 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENVILLE, a city and the county-seat of Hunt county, Texas, U.S.A.,\r\nnear the headwaters of the Sabine river, 48 m. N.E. of Dallas. Pop.\r\n(1900) 6860, of whom 114 were foreign-born and 1751 were negroes; (1910)\r\n8850. It is served by the Missouri, Kansas & Texas, the St Louis\r\nSouth-Western and the Texas Midland railways. It is an important cotton\r\nmarket, has gins and compresses, a large cotton seed oil refinery, and\r\nother manufactories, and is a trade centre for a rich agricultural\r\ndistrict. The city owns and operates its electric-lighting plant. It is\r\nthe seat of Burleson College (Baptist), founded in 1893, and 1 m. from\r\nthe city limits, in the village of Peniel (pop. 1908, about 500), a\r\ncommunity of \"Holiness\" people, are the Texas Holiness University\r\n(1898), a Holiness orphan asylum and a Holiness press. Greenville was\r\nsettled in 1844, and was chartered as a city in 1875. In 1907 the Texas\r\nlegislature granted to the city a new charter establishing a commission\r\ngovernment similar to that of Galveston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENWICH, a township of Fairfield county, Connecticut, U.S.A., on Long\r\nIsland Sound, in the extreme S.W. part of the state, about 28 m. N.E. of\r\nNew York City. It contains a borough of the same name and the villages\r\nof Cos Cob, Riverside and Sound Beach, all served by the New York, New\r\nHaven & Hartford Railway; the township has steamboat and electric\r\nrailway connexions with New York City. Pop. of the township (1900)\r\n12,172, of whom 3271 were foreign-born; (1910) 16,463; of the borough\r\n(1910) 3886. Greenwich is a summer resort, principally for New Yorkers.\r\nAmong the residents have been Edwin Thomas Booth, John Henry Twachtman,\r\nthe landscape painter, and Henry Osborne Havemeyer (1847-1907), founder\r\nof the American Sugar Company. There are several fine churches in the\r\ntownship; of one in Sound Beach the Rev. William H. H. Murray\r\n(1840-1904), called \"Adirondack Murray,\" from his _Camp Life in the\r\nAdirondack Mountains_ (1868), was once pastor. In the borough are a\r\npublic library, Greenwich Academy (1827; co-educational), the Brunswick\r\nSchool for boys (1901), with which Betts Academy of Stamford was united\r\nin 1908, and a hospital. The principal manufactures are belting,\r\nwoollens, tinners' hardware, iron and gasolene motors. Oysters are\r\nshipped from Greenwich. The first settlers came from the New Haven\r\nColony in 1640; but the Dutch, on account of the exploration of Long\r\nIsland Sound by Adrian Blok in 1614, laid claim to Greenwich, and as New\r\nHaven did nothing to assist the settlers, they consented to union with\r\nNew Netherland in 1642. Greenwich then became a Dutch manor. By a treaty\r\nof 1650, which fixed the boundary between New Netherland and the New\r\nHaven Colony, the Dutch relinquished their claim to Greenwich, but the\r\ninhabitants of the town refused to submit to the New Haven Colony until\r\nOctober 1656. Six years later Greenwich was one of the first towns of\r\nthe New Haven Colony to submit to Connecticut. The township suffered\r\nseverely during the War of Independence on account of the frequent\r\nquartering of American troops within its borders, the depredations of\r\nbands of lawless men after the occupation of New York by the British in\r\n1778 and its invasion by the British in 1779 (February 25) and 1781\r\n(December 5). There was also a strong loyalist sentiment. On the old\r\npost-road in Greenwich is the inn, built about 1729, at which Israel\r\nPutnam was surprised in February 1779 by a force under General Tryon;\r\naccording to tradition he escaped by riding down a flight of steep stone\r\nsteps. The inn was purchased in 1901 by the Daughters of the American\r\nRevolution, who restored it and made it a Putnam Memorial. The township\r\ngovernment of Greenwich was instituted in the colonial period. The\r\nborough of Greenwich was incorporated in 1858.\r\n\r\n  See D. M. Mead, _History of the Town of Greenwich_ (New York, 1857).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENWICH, a south-eastern metropolitan borough of London, England,\r\nbounded N. by the river Thames, E. by Woolwich, S. by Lewisham and W. by\r\nDeptford. Pop. (1901) 95,770. Area, 3851.7 acres. It has a\r\nriver-frontage of 4-1/2 m., the Thames making two deep bends, enclosing\r\nthe Isle of Dogs on the north and a similar peninsula on the Greenwich\r\nside. Greenwich is connected with Poplar on the north shore by the\r\nGreenwich tunnel (1902), for foot-passengers, to the Isle of Dogs\r\n(Cubitt Town), and by the Blackwall Tunnel (1897) for street traffic,\r\ncrossing to a point between the East and West India Docks (see POPLAR).\r\nThe main thoroughfares from W. to E. are Woolwich and Shooter's Hill\r\nRoads, the second representing the old high road through Kent, the Roman\r\nWatling Street. Greenwich is first noticed in the reign of Ethelred,\r\nwhen it was a station of the Danish fleet (1011-1014).\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy buildings are the hospital and the observatory.\r\nGreenwich Hospital, as it is still called, became in 1873 a Royal Naval\r\nCollege. Upon it or its site centre nearly all the historical\r\nassociations of the place. The noble buildings, contrasting strangely\r\nwith the wharves adjacent and opposite to it, make a striking picture,\r\nstanding on the low river-bank with a background formed by the wooded\r\nelevation of Greenwich Park. They occupy the site of an ancient royal\r\npalace called Greenwich House, which was a favourite royal residence as\r\nearly as 1300, but was granted by Henry V. to Thomas Beaufort, duke of\r\nExeter, from whom it passed to Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, who largely\r\nimproved the property and named it _Placentia_. It did not revert to the\r\ncrown till his death in 1447. It was the birthplace of Henry VIII.,\r\nQueen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, and here Edward VI. died. The building\r\nwas enlarged by Edward IV., by Henry VIII., who made it one of his chief\r\nresidences, by James I. and by Charles I., who erected the \"Queen's\r\nHouse\" for Henrietta Maria. The tenure of land from the crown \"as of the\r\nmanor of East Greenwich\" became at this time a recognized formula, and\r\noccurs in a succession of American colonial charters from those of\r\nVirginia in 1606, 1609 and 1612 to that of New Jersey in 1674. Along\r\nwith other royal palaces Greenwich was at the Revolution appropriated by\r\nthe Protector, but it reverted to the crown on the restoration of\r\nCharles II., by whom it was pulled down, and the west wing of the\r\npresent hospital was erected as part of an extensive design which was\r\nnot further carried out. In its unfinished state it was assigned by the\r\npatent of William and Mary to certain of the great officers of state, as\r\ncommissioners for its conversion into a hospital for seamen; and it was\r\nopened as such in 1705. The building consists of four blocks. Behind a\r\nterrace 860 ft. in length, stretching along the river side, are the\r\nbuildings erected in the time of Charles II. from Inigo Jones's designs,\r\nand in that of Queen Anne from designs by Sir Christopher Wren; and\r\nbehind these buildings are on the west those of King William and on the\r\neast those of Queen Mary, both from Wren's designs. In the King William\r\nrange is the painted hall. Here in 1806 the remains of Nelson lay in\r\nstate before their burial in St Paul's Cathedral. Its walls and ceiling\r\nwere painted by Sir James Thornhill with various emblematic devices, and\r\nit is hung with portraits of the most distinguished admirals and\r\npaintings of the chief naval battles of England. In the Queen Anne range\r\nis the Royal Naval Museum, containing models, relics of Nelson and of\r\nFranklin, and other objects. In the centre of the principal quadrangle\r\nof the hospital there is a statue of George II. by Rysbrack, sculptured\r\nout of a single block of marble taken from the French by Admiral Sir\r\nGeorge Rooke. In the upper quadrangle is a bust of Nelson by Chantrey,\r\nand there are various other memorials and relics. The oldest part of the\r\nbuilding was in some measure rebuilt in 1811, and the present chapel was\r\nerected to replace one destroyed by fire in 1779. The endowments of the\r\nhospital were increased at various periods from bequests and forfeited\r\nestates. Formerly 2700 retired seamen were boarded within it, and 5000\r\nor 6000 others, called out-pensioners, received stipends at various\r\nrates out of its funds; but in 1865 an act was passed empowering the\r\nAdmiralty to grant liberal pensions in lieu of food and lodging to such\r\nof the inmates as were willing to quit the hospital, and in 1869 another\r\nact was passed making their leaving on these conditions compulsory. It\r\nwas then devoted to the accommodation of the students of the Royal Naval\r\nCollege, the Infirmary being granted to the Seamen's Hospital Society.\r\nBehind the College is the Royal Hospital School, where 1000 boys, sons\r\nof petty officers and seamen, are boarded.\r\n\r\nTo the south of the hospital is Greenwich Park (185 acres), lying high,\r\nand commanding extensive views over London, the Thames and the plain of\r\nEssex. It was enclosed by Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, and laid out by\r\nCharles II., and contains a fine avenue of Spanish chestnuts planted in\r\nhis time. In it is situated the Royal Observatory, built in 1675 for the\r\nadvancement of navigation and nautical astronomy. From it the exact time\r\nis conveyed each day at one o'clock by electric signal to the chief\r\ntowns throughout the country; British and the majority of foreign\r\ngeographers reckon longitude from its meridian. A standard clock and\r\nmeasures are seen at the entrance. A new building was completed in 1899,\r\nthe magnetic pavilion lying some 400 yds. to the east, so placed to\r\navoid the disturbance of instruments which would be occasioned by the\r\niron used in the principal building. South of the park lies the open\r\ncommon of Blackheath, mainly within the borough of Lewisham, and in the\r\neast the borough includes the greater part of Woolwich Common.\r\n\r\nAt Greenwich an annual banquet of cabinet ministers, known as the\r\nwhitebait dinner, formerly took place. This ceremony arose out of a\r\ndinner held annually at Dagenham, on the Essex shore of the Thames, by\r\nthe commissioners for engineering works carried out there in\r\n1705-1720--a remarkable achievement for this period--to save the\r\nlowlands from flooding. To one of these dinners Pitt was invited, and\r\nwas subsequently accompanied by some of his colleagues. Early in the\r\n19th century the venue of the dinner, which had now become a ministerial\r\nfunction, was transferred to Greenwich, and though at first not always\r\nheld here, was later celebrated regularly at the \"Ship,\" an hotel of\r\nancient foundation, closed in 1908. The banquet continued till 1868, was\r\nrevived in 1874-1880, and was held for the last time in 1894.\r\n\r\nThe parish church of Greenwich, in Church Street, is dedicated to St\r\nAlphege, archbishop, who was martyred here by the Danes in 1012. In the\r\nchurch Wolfe, who died at Quebec (1759), and Tallis, the musician, are\r\nburied. A modern stained-glass window commemorates Wolfe.\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary borough of Greenwich returns one member. Two burgesses\r\nwere returned in 1577, but it was not again represented till the same\r\nprivilege was conferred on it in 1832. The borough council consists of a\r\nmayor, five aldermen and thirty councillors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENWOOD, FREDERICK (1830-1909), English journalist and man of letters,\r\nwas born in April 1830. He was one of three brothers--the others being\r\nJames and Charles--who all gained reputation as journalists. Frederick\r\nstarted life in a printing house, but at an early age began to write in\r\nperiodicals. In 1853 he contributed a sketch of Napoleon III. to a\r\nvolume called _The Napoleon Dynasty_ (2nd ed., 1855). He also wrote\r\nseveral novels: _The Loves of an Apothecary_ (1854), _The Path of Roses_\r\n(1859) and (with his brother James) _Under a Cloud_ (1860). To the\r\nsecond number of the _Cornhill Magazine_ he contributed \"An Essay\r\nwithout End,\" and this led to an introduction to Thackeray. In 1862,\r\nwhen Thackeray resigned the editorship of the _Cornhill_, Greenwood\r\nbecame joint editor with G. H. Lewes. In 1864 he was appointed sole\r\neditor, a post which he held until 1868. While at the _Cornhill_ he\r\nwrote an article in which he suggested, to some extent, how Thackeray\r\nmight have intended to conclude his unfinished work _Denis Duval_, and\r\nin its pages appeared _Margaret Denzil's History_, Greenwood's most\r\nambitious work of fiction, published in volume form in 1864. At that\r\ntime Greenwood had conceived the idea of an evening newspaper, which,\r\nwhile containing \"all the news proper to an evening journal,\" should,\r\nfor the most part, be made up \"of original articles upon the many things\r\nwhich engage the thoughts, or employ the energies, or amuse the leisure\r\nof mankind.\" Public affairs, literature and art, \"and all the influences\r\nwhich strengthen or dissipate society\" were to be discussed by men whose\r\nindependence and authority were equally unquestionable. Canning's\r\n_Anti-Jacobin_ and the _Saturday Review_ of 1864 were the joint models\r\nGreenwood had before him. The idea was taken up by Mr George Smith, and\r\nthe _Pall Mall Gazette_ (so named after Thackeray's imaginary paper in\r\n_Pendennis_) was launched in February 1865, with Greenwood as editor.\r\nWithin a few years he had come to exercise a great influence on public\r\naffairs. His views somewhat rapidly ripened from what was described as\r\nphilosophic Liberalism into Conservatism. No minister in Great Britain,\r\nMr Gladstone declared, ever had a more able, a more zealous, a more\r\neffective supporter for his policy than Lord Beaconsfield had in\r\nGreenwood. It was on the suggestion of Greenwood that Beaconsfield\r\npurchased in 1875 the Suez Canal shares of the Khedive Ismail; the\r\nBritish government being ignorant, until informed by Greenwood, that the\r\nshares were for sale and likely to be bought by France. It was\r\ncharacteristic of Greenwood that he declined to publish the news of the\r\npurchase of the shares in the _Pall Mall_ before the official\r\nannouncement was made.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1880 the _Pall Mall_ changed owners, and the new proprietor\r\nrequired it to support Liberal policy. Greenwood at once resigned his\r\neditorship, but in May a new paper, the _St James's Gazette_, was\r\nstarted for him by Mr Henry Hucks Gibbs (afterwards Lord Aldenham), and\r\nGreenwood proceeded to carry on in it the tradition which he had\r\nestablished in the _Pall Mall_. At the _St James's_ Greenwood remained\r\nfor over eight years, continuing to exercise a marked influence upon\r\npolitical affairs, notably as a pungent critic of the Gladstone\r\nadministration (1880-1885) and an independent supporter of Lord\r\nSalisbury. His connexion with the paper ceased in August 1888, owing to\r\ndisagreements with the new proprietor, Mr E. Steinkopff, who had bought\r\nthe _St James's_ at Greenwood's own suggestion. In January 1891\r\nGreenwood brought out a weekly review which he named the _Anti-Jacobin_.\r\nIt failed, however, to gain public support, the last number appearing in\r\nJanuary 1892. In 1893 he published _The Lover's Lexicon_ and in 1894\r\n_Imagination in Dreams_. He continued to express his views on political\r\nand social questions in contributions to newspapers and magazines,\r\nwriting frequently in the _Westminster Gazette_, the _Pall Mall_,\r\n_Blackwood_, the _Cornhill_, &c. Towards the end of his life his\r\npolitical views reverted in some respects to the Liberalism of his early\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nIn the words of George Meredith \"Greenwood was not only a great\r\njournalist, he had a statesman's head. The national interests were\r\nalways urgent at his heart.\" He was remarkable for securing for his\r\npapers the services of the ablest writers of the day, and for the gift\r\nof recognizing merit in new writers, such, for instance, as Richard\r\nJeffries and J. M. Barrie. His instinct for capacity in others was as\r\nsure as was his journalistic judgment. In 1905, on the occasion of his\r\n75th birthday, a dinner was given in his honour by leading statesmen,\r\njournalists, and men of letters (with John Morley--who had succeeded him\r\nas editor of the _Pall Mall_--in the chair). In May 1907 he contributed\r\nto _Blackwood_ an article on \"The New Journalism,\" in which he drew a\r\nsharp contrast between the old and the new conditions under which the\r\nwork of a newspaper writer is conducted. He died at Sydenham on the 14th\r\nof December 1909.\r\n\r\n  See _Honouring Frederick Greenwood_, being a report of the speeches at\r\n  the dinner on the 8th of April 1905 (London, privately printed, 1905);\r\n  \"Birth and Infancy of the _Pall Mall Gazette_,\" an article contributed\r\n  by Greenwood to the _Pall Mall_ of the 14th of April 1897; \"The\r\n  Blowing of the Trumpet\" in the introduction to the _St James's_ (May\r\n  31, 1880); obituary notices in the _Athenaeum_ (Dec. 25, 1909) and\r\n  _The Times_ (Dec. 17, 1909).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENWOOD, JOHN (d. 1593), English Puritan and Separatist (the date and\r\nplace of his birth are unknown), entered as a sizar at Corpus Christi\r\nCollege, Cambridge, on the 18th of March 1577-1578, and commenced B.A.\r\n1581. Whether he was directly influenced by the teaching of Robert\r\nBrowne (q.v.), a graduate of the same college, is uncertain; in any case\r\nhe held strong Puritan opinions, which ultimately led him to Separatism\r\nof the most rigid type. In 1581 he was chaplain to Lord Rich, at\r\nRochford, Essex. At some unspecified time he had been made deacon by\r\nJohn Aylmer, bishop of London, and priest by Thomas Cooper, bishop of\r\nLincoln; but ere long he renounced this ordination as \"wholly unlawful.\"\r\nDetails of the next few years are lacking; but by 1586 he was the\r\nrecognized leader of the London Separatists, of whom a considerable\r\nnumber had been imprisoned at various times since 1567. Greenwood was\r\narrested early in October 1586, and the following May was committed to\r\nthe Fleet prison for an indefinite time, in default of bail for\r\nconformity. During his imprisonment he wrote some controversial tracts\r\nin conjunction with his fellow-prisoner Henry Barrowe (q.v.). He is\r\nunderstood to have been at liberty in the autumn of 1588; but this may\r\nhave been merely \"the liberty of the prison.\" However, he was certainly\r\nat large in September 1592, when he was elected \"teacher\" of the\r\nSeparatist church. Meanwhile he had written (1590) \"An Answer to George\r\nGifford's pretended Defence of Read Prayers.\" On the 5th of December he\r\nwas again arrested; and the following March was tried, together with\r\nBarrowe, and condemned to death on a charge of \"devising and circulating\r\nseditious books.\" After two respites, one at the foot of the gallows, he\r\nwas hanged on the 6th of April 1593.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--H.

He was educated at the\r\nuniversity of Edinburgh and for a time managed a mill of his father's at\r\nBury, and in 1832 began business on his own account. He entered with\r\nardour into the struggle for free trade, and obtained in 1842 the prize\r\noffered by the Anti-Corn Law League for the best essay on \"Agriculture\r\nand the Corn Laws.\" He was too much occupied with political, economical\r\nand theological speculations to give undivided attention to his\r\nbusiness, which he gave up in 1850 to devote himself to writing. His\r\n_Creed of Christendom_ was published in 1851, and in 1852 he contributed\r\nno less than twelve articles to four leading quarterlies. Disraeli\r\npraised him; Sir George Cornewall Lewis bestowed a Commissionership of\r\nCustoms upon him in 1856; and in 1864 he was made Comptroller of the\r\nStationery Office. Besides contributions to periodicals he produced\r\nseveral volumes of essays on political and social philosophy. The\r\ngeneral spirit of these is indicated by the titles of two of the best\r\nknown, _The Enigmas of Life_ (1872) and _Rocks Ahead_ (1874). They\r\nrepresent a reaction from the high hopes of the author's youth, when\r\nwise legislation was assumed to be a remedy for every public ill. Greg\r\nwas a man of deep moral earnestness of character and was interested in\r\nmany philanthropic works. He died at Wimbledon on the 15th of November\r\n1881. His brother, ROBERT HYDE GREG (1795-1875), was an economist and\r\nantiquary of some distinction. Another brother, SAMUEL GREG (1804-1876),\r\nbecame well known in Lancashire by his philanthropic efforts on behalf\r\nof the working-people. PERCY GREG (1836-1889), son of William Rathbone\r\nGreg, also wrote, like his father, on politics, but his views were\r\nviolently reactionary. His _History of the United States to the\r\nReconstruction of the Union_ (1887) is a polemic rather than a history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREGARINES (mod. Lat. _Gregarina_, from _gregarius_, collecting in a\r\nflock or herd, _grex_) a large and abundant order of Sporozoa Ectospora,\r\nin which a very high degree of morphological specialization and\r\ncytological differentiation of the cell-body is frequently found. On the\r\nother hand, the life-cycle is, in general, fairly simple. Other\r\nprincipal characters which distinguish Gregarines from allied Sporozoan\r\nparasites are as follows:--The fully-grown adult (trophozoite) is always\r\n\"free\" in some internal cavity, i.e. it is extracellular; in nearly all\r\ncases prior to sporulation two Gregarines (associates) become attached\r\nto one another, forming a couple (syzygy), and are surrounded by a\r\ncommon cyst; inside the cyst the body of each associate becomes\r\nsegmented up into a number of sexual elements (gametes, primary\r\nsporoblasts), which then conjugate in pairs; the resulting copula\r\n(zygote, definitive sporoblast) becomes usually a spore by the secretion\r\nof spore-membranes (sporocyst), its protoplasm (sporoplasm) dividing up\r\nto form the germs (sporozoites).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Historical.\r\n\r\nF. Redi (1684) is said to have been the first to observe a Gregarine\r\nparasite, but his claim to this honour is by no means certain. Much\r\nlater (1787) Cavolini described and figured an indubitable Gregarine\r\n(probably the form now known as _Aggregata conformis_) from a Crustacean\r\n(_Pachygrapsus_), which, however, he regarded as a tapeworm. Leon\r\nDufour, who in his researches on insect anatomy came across several\r\nspecies of these parasites, also considered them as allied to the worms\r\nand proposed the generic name of _Gregarina_. The unicellular nature of\r\nGregarines was first realized by A. von Kolliker, who from 1845-1848\r\nadded considerably to our knowledge of the frequent occurrence and wide\r\ndistribution of these organisms. Further progress was due to F. Stein\r\nwho demonstrated about this time the relation of the \"pseudo-navicellae\"\r\n(spores) to the reproduction of the parasites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Wasielewswi's _Sporozoenkunde_, after Pfeiffer.\r\n\r\nFIG. 1.--a, Transverse Section of Intestine of Mealworm, infected with\r\n_Gregarina_ (_Clepsydrina_) _polymorpha_;[1] b, Part of a highly\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\nApart from the continually increasing number of known species, matters\r\nremained at about this stage for many years. It is, in fact, only since\r\nthe closing years of the 19th century that the complete life-history has\r\nbeen fully worked out; this has now been done in many cases, thanks to\r\nthe researches of M. Siedlecki, L. Cuenot, L. Leger, O. Duboscq, A.\r\nLaveran, M. Caullery, F. Mesnil and others, to whom also we owe most of\r\nour knowledge regarding the relations of the parasites to the cells of\r\ntheir host during their early development.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Occurrence; mode of infection.\r\n\r\nGregarines are essentially parasites of Invertebrates; they are not\r\nknown to occur in any true Vertebrate although met with in Ascidians. By\r\nfar the greatest number of hosts is furnished by the Arthropods. Many\r\nmembers of the various groups of worms (especially the Annelids) also\r\nharbour the parasites, and certain very interesting forms are found in\r\nEchinoderms; in the other classes, they either occur only sporadically\r\nor else are absent. Infection is invariably of the accidental (casual)\r\ntype, by way of the alimentary canal, the spores being usually swallowed\r\nby the host when feeding; a novel variation of this method has been\r\ndescribed by Woodcock (31) in the case of a Gregarine parasitic in\r\nCucumaria, where the spores are sucked up through the cloaca into the\r\nrespiratory trees, by the inhalant current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Wasielewski, after Leger.\r\n\r\nFIG. 2.--Cysts of a Coelomic Gregarine, in the body-cavity of a larva of\r\n_Tipula_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Habitat and effects on host.\r\n\r\nThe favourite habitat is either the intestine (fig. 1) or its\r\ndiverticula (e.g. the Malpighian tubules), or the body-cavity. In the\r\nlatter case, after infection has occurred, the liberated germs at once\r\ntraverse the intestinal epithelium. They may come to rest in the\r\nconnective tissue of the sub-mucosa (remaining, however,\r\nextracellular), grow considerably in that situation, and ultimately fall\r\ninto the body-cavity (e.g. _Diplocystis_); or they may pass straightway\r\ninto the body-cavity and there come into relation with some organ or\r\ntissue (e.g. _Monocystis_) of the earthworm, which is for a time\r\nintracellular in the spermatoblasts (fig. 4, c). In the case of\r\nintestinal Gregarines, the behaviour of the young trophozoite with\r\nrespect to the epithelial cells of its host varies greatly. The parasite\r\nmay remain only attached to the host-cell, never becoming actually\r\nintracellular (e.g. _Pterocephalus_); more usually it penetrates\r\npartially into it, the extracellular portion of the Gregarine, however,\r\ngiving rise subsequently to most of the adult (e.g. _Gregarina_); or\r\nlastly, in a few forms, the early development is entirely intracellular\r\n(e.g. _Lankesteria_, _Stenophora_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Lankester.\r\n\r\nFIG. 3.--_Porospora gigantea f_, (E. van Ben.), from the intestine of\r\nthe lobster. a, Nucleus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Lankester, after various authors.\r\n\r\nFIG. 4.\r\n\r\n  a-c, Trophozoites of _Monocystis agilis_.\r\n  a and b, Young individuals showing changes of body-form.\r\n  c, Older individual, still enveloped in a coat of spermatozoa.\r\n  d, e, Trophozoites of _M. magna_ attached to seminal funnel of\r\n    _Lumbricus_.\r\n  Goblet-shaped epithelial cells, in which the extremity of the parasite\r\n    is inserted.]\r\n\r\nThe effects on the host are confined to the parasitized cells. These\r\ngenerally undergo at first marked hypertrophy and alteration in\r\ncharacter; this condition is succeeded by one of atrophy, when the\r\nsubstance of the cell becomes in one way or another practically absorbed\r\nby the growing parasite (cf. also COCCIDIA). Since, however, the\r\nGregarines never overrun their hosts in the way that many other Sporozoa\r\ndo (because of their lack, in general, of the power of endogenous\r\nmultiplication), the number of cells of any tissue attacked, even in the\r\ncase of a strong infection, is only a very small percentage of the\r\nwhole. In short the hosts do not, as a rule, suffer any appreciable\r\ninconvenience from the presence of the parasites.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Morphology.\r\n\r\n  The body of a Gregarine is always of a definite shape, usually oval\r\n  or elongated; in one or two instances (e.g. _Diplodina_) it is\r\n  spherical, and, on the other hand, in _Porospora_ (fig. 3) it is\r\n  greatly drawn out and vermiform. In many adult Gregarines, the body is\r\n  divided into two distinct but unequal regions or halves, the anterior\r\n  part being known as the _protomerite_, the hinder, generally the\r\n  larger, as the _deutomerite_. This feature is closely associated with\r\n  another important morphological character, one which is observable,\r\n  however, only during the earlier stages of growth and development,\r\n  namely, the presence of a definite organ, the _epimerite_, which\r\n  serves for the attachment of the parasite to the host-cell (fig. 6).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After Siedlecki, from Lankester's _Treatise on\r\n  Zoology_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 5.--Part of a section through the apparatus of fixation of a\r\n  _Pterocephalus_, showing root-like processes extending from the\r\n  Gregarine between the epithelial cells. g, Head of Gregarine; r,\r\n  Root-like processes; ep, Epithelial cells.]\r\n\r\n  In those Gregarines (most intestinal forms) which become attached to\r\n  an epithelial cell, the attachment occurs by means of a minute\r\n  projection or beak (rostrum) at the anterior end of the sporozoite,\r\n  which pushes its way into the cell, followed by the first part of the\r\n  growing germ. This portion of the body increases in size much quicker\r\n  at first than the rest (the extracellular part), more or less fills up\r\n  the host-cell, and forms the well-developed epimerite or secondary\r\n  attaching organella. The extracellular part of the Gregarine next\r\n  grows rapidly, and a transverse septum is formed at a short distance\r\n  away from (outside) the point where the body penetrates into the cell\r\n  (fig. 6); this marks off the large deutomerite posteriorly (distally).\r\n  Leger thinks that this partition most likely owes its origin to\r\n  trophic considerations, i.e. to the slightly different manner in which\r\n  the two halves of the young parasite (the proximal, largely\r\n  intracellular part, and the distal, extracellular one) may be supposed\r\n  to obtain their nutriment. In the case of the one half, the host-cell\r\n  supplies the nutriment, in that of the other, the intestinal liquid;\r\n  and the septum is, as it were, the expression of the conflicting limit\r\n  between these two methods. Nevertheless, the present writer does not\r\n  think that mechanical considerations should be altogether left out of\r\n  account. The septum may also be, to some extent, an adaption for\r\n  strengthening the body of the fixed parasite against lateral thrusts\r\n  or strains, due to the impact of foreign bodies (food, &c.) in the\r\n  intestine.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Wasielewski, after Leger.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 6.--_Corycella armata_, Leger. a, Cephalont; b, Epimerite in\r\n  host-cell; c, Sporont.]\r\n\r\n  At the point where the body becomes actually intracellular, it is\r\n  constricted, and this constriction marks off the epimerite\r\n  (internally) from the middle portion (between this point and the\r\n  septum), which is the protomerite. Further growth is restricted,\r\n  practically, to the extracellular regions, and the epimerite often\r\n  comes to appear ultimately as a small appendage at the anterior end of\r\n  the protomerite. A Gregarine at this stage is known as a cephalont.\r\n  Later on, the parasite breaks loose from the host-cell and becomes\r\n  free in the lumen, the separation taking place at the constriction\r\n  between the protomerite and the epimerite; the latter is left behind\r\n  in the remains of the host-cell, the former becomes the anterior part\r\n  of the free trophozoite.\r\n\r\n  In other Gregarines, however, those, namely, which pass inwards,\r\n  ultimately becoming \"coelomic,\" as well as those which become entirely\r\n  intracellular, no epimerite is ever developed, and, further, the body\r\n  remains single or unseptate. These forms, which include, for instance,\r\n  _Monocystis_ (fig. 4), _Lankesteria_, _Diplocystis_, are\r\n  distinguished, as _Acephalina_ or _Aseptata_ (_Haplocyta_,\r\n  _Monocystida_), according to which character is referred to, from the\r\n  others, termed _Cephalina_ or _Septata_ (_Polycystida_).\r\n\r\n  The two sets of terms are not, however, completely identical or\r\n  interchangeable, for there are a few forms which possess an epimerite,\r\n  but which lack the division into protomerite and deutomerite, and are\r\n  hence known as _Pseudomonocystida_; this condition may be primitive\r\n  (_Doliocystis_) or (possibly) secondary, the partition having in\r\n  course of time disappeared. Again, _Stenophora_ is a septate form\r\n  which has become, secondarily, completely intracellular during the\r\n  young stages, and, doubtless correlated with this, shows no sign of an\r\n  epimerite.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Wasielewski, after Leger.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 7.--Forms of Epimerites.\r\n\r\n    1, _Gregarina longa_.\r\n    2, _Sycia inopinata_.\r\n    3, _Pileocephalus heerii_.\r\n    4, _Stylorhynchus longicollis_.\r\n    5, _Beloides firmus_.\r\n    6, _Cometoides crinitus_.\r\n    7, _Geneiorhynchus monnieri_.\r\n    8, _Echinomera hispida_.\r\n    9, _Pterocephalus nobilis_.]\r\n\r\n  With regard to the epimerites themselves, they are of all variety of\r\n  form and shape and need not be described in detail (fig. 7). In one or\r\n  two cases, however, another variety of attaching organella is met\r\n  with. Thus in _Pterocephalus_, only the rostrum of the sporozoite\r\n  penetrates into the host-cell, and no epimerite is formed. Instead, a\r\n  number of fine root-like processes are developed from near the\r\n  anterior end, which pass in between the host-cells (fig. 5) and thus\r\n  anchor the parasite firmly. Similarly, in the curious\r\n  _Schizogregarinae_, the anterior end of the (unseptate) body forms a\r\n  number of stiff, irregular processes, which perform the same function\r\n  (fig. 8). It is to be noted that these processes are non-motile, and\r\n  not in any way comparable to pseudopodia, to which they were formerly\r\n  likened.\r\n\r\n  A very interesting and remarkable morphological peculiarity has been\r\n  recently described by Leger (18) in the case of a new Gregarine,\r\n  _Taeniocystis_. In this form the body is elongated and metamerically\r\n  segmented, recalling that of a segmented worm, the adult trophozoites\r\n  possessing numerous partitions or segments (each corresponding to the\r\n  septum between the proto- and deuto-merite in an ordinary Polycystid),\r\n  which divide up the cytoplasm into roughly equal compartments. Leger\r\n  thinks only the deutomerite becomes thus segmented, the protomerite\r\n  remaining small and undivided. The nucleus remains single, so that\r\n  there is no question as to the unicellular or individual nature of the\r\n  entire animal.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After Leger and Hagenmuller, from Lankester's _Treatise\r\n  on Zoology_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 8.--Three Individuals (G) of _Ophryocystis schneideri_, attached\r\n  to wall of Malpighian tubule of _Blaps_ sp. p, Syncytial protoplasm of\r\n  the tubule; c, Cilia lining the lumen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Minute structure.\r\n\r\n  The general cytoplasm usually consists of distinct ectoplasm and\r\n  endoplasm, and is limited by a membrane or cuticle (epicyte), secreted\r\n  by the former. The cuticle varies considerably in thickness, being\r\n  well developed in active, intestinal forms, but very thin and delicate\r\n  in non-motile coelomic forms (e.g. _Diplodina_). In the former case it\r\n  may show longitudinal striations. The cuticle also forms the hooks or\r\n  spines of many epimerites. The ectoplasm usually shows (fig. 9A) a\r\n  differentiation into two layers, an outer, firmer layer, clear and\r\n  hyaline, the sarcocyte, and an inner layer, the myocyte, which is\r\n  formed of a network of muscle-fibrillae (mainly longitudinal and\r\n  transverse, fig. 9B). The sarcocyte alone constitutes the septum,\r\n  traversing the endoplasm, in septate Gregarines. The myonemes are\r\n  undoubtedly the agents responsible for the active \"gregarinoid\"\r\n  movements (of flexion and contraction) to be observed in many forms.\r\n  The peculiar gliding movements were formerly thought to be produced by\r\n  the extrusion of a gelatinous thread posteriorly, but Crawley (8) has\r\n  recently ascribed them to a complicated succession of wave-like\r\n  contractions of the myocyte layer. This view is supported by the fact\r\n  that certain coelomic forms, like _Diplodina_ and others, which either\r\n  lack muscle-fibrils or else show no ectoplasmic differentiation at\r\n  all, are non-motile. The endoplasm, or nutritive plasm, consists of a\r\n  semi-fluid matrix in which are embedded vast numbers of grains and\r\n  spherules of various kinds and of all sizes, representing an\r\n  accumulation of food-material which is being stored up prior to\r\n  reproduction. The largest and most abundant grains are of a substance\r\n  termed para-glycogen, a carbohydrate; in addition, flattened\r\n  lenticular platelets, of an albuminoid character, and\r\n  highly-refringent granules often occur.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After Schewiakoff, from Lankester's _Treatise on\r\n  Zoology_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 9A.--Longitudinal section of a Gregarine in the region of the\r\n  septum between protomerite and deutomerite.\r\n\r\n    Pr, Protomerite.\r\n    De, Deutomerite.\r\n    s,  Septum.\r\n    en, Endoplasm.\r\n    sc, Sarcocyte.\r\n    c,  Cuticle.\r\n    m, f, Myocyte fibrils (cut across).\r\n    g, Gelatinous layer.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9B.--_Gregarina munieri_, showing the network of\r\n  myocyte fibrillae.]\r\n\r\n  The nucleus is always lodged in the endoplasm, and, in the septate\r\n  forms, in the deutomeritic half of the body. It is normally spherical\r\n  and always limited by a distinct nuclear membrane, which itself often\r\n  contains chromatin. The most characteristic feature of the nucleus is\r\n  the deeply-staining, more or less vacuolated spherical karyosome\r\n  (consisting of chromatin intimately bound up with a plastinoid basis)\r\n  which is invariably present. In one or two instances (e.g.\r\n  _Diplocystis schneideri_) the nucleus has more than one karyosome. All\r\n  the chromatin of the nucleus is not, however, confined to the\r\n  karyosome, some being in the form of grains in the nuclear sap; and in\r\n  some cases at any rate (e.g. _Diplodina, Lankesteria_) there is a\r\n  well-marked nuclear reticulum which is impregnated with granules and\r\n  dots of chromatin.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Wasielewski, after A. Schneider.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 10.--Schizogony in _Ophryocystis francisci_. a, Rosette of small\r\n  individuals, produced from a schizont which has just divided; b, A\r\n  later stage, the daughter-individuals about to separate and assuming\r\n  the characters of the adult.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Life-history.\r\n\r\n  A sexual multiplication (schizogony) is only known certainly to occur\r\n  in a few cases, one being in a Monocystid form, a species of\r\n  _Gonospora_, which is for a long time intracellular (Caullery and\r\n  Mesnil [4]), the rest among the _Schizogregarinae_, so named for this\r\n  reason, in which schizogonous fission takes place regularly during the\r\n  free, trophic condition. Usually, the body divides up, by a process of\r\n  multiple fission (fig. 10), into a few (up to eight)\r\n  daughter-individuals; but in a new genus (_Eleutheroschizon_), Brasil\r\n  (3) finds that a great number of little merozoites are formed, and a\r\n  large amount of vacuolated cytoplasm is left over unused.\r\n\r\n  In the vast majority of Gregarines, however, the life-cycle is limited\r\n  to gametogony and sporogony. A very general, if not indeed universal,\r\n  prelude to gametogony is the characteristic and important feature of\r\n  the order, known as association, the biological significance of which\r\n  has only lately been fully brought out (see H. M. Woodcock [31]). In\r\n  normal association, two individuals which are to be regarded as of\r\n  opposite sex, come into close contact with each other and remain thus\r\n  attached. The manner in which the parasites join varies in different\r\n  forms; the association may be end-to-end (terminal), either by like or\r\n  by unlike poles, or it may be side-to-side (lateral) (fig. 12). The\r\n  couple (syzygy) thus formed may proceed forthwith to encystment and\r\n  sporoblast-formation (_Lankesteria, Monocystis_), or may continue in\r\n  the trophic phase for some time longer (_Gregarina_). In one or two\r\n  instances (_Zygocystis_), association occurs as soon as the\r\n  trophozoites become adult. This leads on to the interesting\r\n  phenomenon of precocious association (neogamy), found in non-motile,\r\n  coelomic Gregarines (e.g. _Cystobia_, _Diplodina_ and _Diplocystis_),\r\n  in which the parasitism is most advanced. Woodcock (_loc. cit._) has\r\n  described and compared the different methods adopted to ensure a\r\n  permanent union, and the degree of neogamy attained, in these forms.\r\n  Here it must suffice to say that, in the extreme condition (seen, for\r\n  instance, in _Diplodina minchinii_) the union takes place very early\r\n  in the life-history, between individuals which are little more than\r\n  sporozoites, and is of a most intimate character, the actual cytoplasm\r\n  of the two associates joining. In such cases, there is absolutely\r\n  nothing to indicate the \"double\" nature of the growing trophozoite,\r\n  but the presence of the two nuclei which remain quite distinct.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Wasielewski, after Leger.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 11.--_Eirmocystis spp._ a, b, Associations of two and three\r\n  Gregarines; c, Chain of five parasites; p, Primite; s, Satellites.]\r\n\r\n  There can be little doubt that, in the great majority, if not in all\r\n  Gregarines, association is necessary for subsequent sporulation to\r\n  take place; i.e. that the cytotactic attraction imparts a\r\n  developmental stimulus to both partners, which is requisite for the\r\n  formation of primary sporoblasts (gametes). This association is\r\n  usually permanent; but in one or two cases (perhaps _Gonospora sp._)\r\n  temporary association may suffice. While association has fundamentally\r\n  a reproductive (sexual) significance, in some cases, this function may\r\n  be delayed or, as it were, temporarily suspended, the cytotactic\r\n  attraction serving meanwhile a subsidiary purpose in trophic life.\r\n  Thus, probably, are to be explained the curious multiple associations\r\n  and long chains of Gregarines (fig. 11) sometimes met with (e.g.\r\n  _Eirmocystis_, _Clepsydrina_).\r\n\r\n  Encystment is nearly always double, i.e. of an associated couple.\r\n  Solitary encystment has been described, but whether successful\r\n  independent sporulation results, is uncertain; if it does, the\r\n  encystment in such cases is, in all probability, only after prior\r\n  (temporary) association. In the case of free parasites, a\r\n  well-developed cyst is secreted by the syzygy, which rotates and\r\n  gradually becomes spherical. A thick, at first gelatinous, outer\r\n  cyst-membrane (_ectocyst_) is laid down, and then a thin, but firm\r\n  internal one (endocyst). The cyst once formed, further development is\r\n  quite independent of the host, and, in fact, often proceeds outside\r\n  it. In certain coelomic Gregarines, on the other hand, which remain in\r\n  very close relation with the host's tissues, little or nothing of an\r\n  encystment-process on the part of the parasites is recognizable, the\r\n  cyst-wall being formed by an enclosing layer of the host\r\n  (_Diplodina_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Wasielewski, after Leger.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 12.--Associations of _Gonospora sparsa_.]\r\n\r\n  The nuclear changes and multiplication which precede\r\n  sporoblast-formation vary greatly in different Gregarines and can only\r\n  be outlined here. In the formation of both sets of sexual elements\r\n  (gametes) there is always a comprehensive nuclear purification or\r\n  maturation. This elimination of a part of the nuclear material (to be\r\n  distinguished as trophic or somatic, from the functional or germinal\r\n  portion, which forms the sexual nuclei) may occur at widely-different\r\n  periods. In some cases (_Lankesteria_, _Monocystis_), a large part of\r\n  the original (sporont-) nucleus of each associate is at once got rid\r\n  of, and the resulting (segmentation-) nucleus, which is\r\n  highly-specialized, represents the sexual part. In other cases, again,\r\n  the entire sporont-nucleus proceeds to division, and the distinction\r\n  between somatic and germinal portions does not become manifest until\r\n  after nuclear multiplication has continued for some little time, when\r\n  certain of the daughter-nuclei become altered in character, and\r\n  ultimately degenerate, the remainder giving rise to the\r\n  sporoblast-nuclei (_Diplodina_, _Stylorhynchus_). Even after the\r\n  actual sporoblasts (sex-cells) themselves are constituted, their\r\n  nuclei may yet undergo a final maturation (e.g. _Clepsydrina ovata_);\r\n  and in _Monocystis_, indeed, Brasil (2) finds that what is apparently\r\n  a similar process is delayed until after conjugation and formation of\r\n  the zygote (definitive sporoblast).\r\n\r\n  Nuclear multiplication is usually indirect, the mitosis being, as a\r\n  rule, more elaborate in the earlier than in the later divisions. The\r\n  attraction-spheres are generally large and conspicuous, sometimes\r\n  consisting of a well-developed centrosphere, with or without\r\n  centrosomic granules, at other times of very large centrosomes with a\r\n  few astral rays. In those cases where the karyosome is retained, and\r\n  the sporont-nucleus divides up as a whole, however, the earliest\r\n  nuclear divisions are direct; the daughter-nuclei being formed either\r\n  by a process of simple constriction (e.g. _Diplodina_), or by a kind\r\n  of multiple fission or fragmentation (_Gregarina_ and _Selenidium\r\n  spp._). Nevertheless, the later divisions, at any rate in _Diplodina_,\r\n  are indirect.\r\n\r\n  By the time nuclear multiplication is well advanced or completed, the\r\n  bodies of the two parent-Gregarines (associates) have usually become\r\n  very irregular in shape, and produced into numerous lobes and\r\n  processes. While in some forms (e.g. _Monocystis_, _Urospora_,\r\n  _Stylorhynchus_) the two individuals remain fairly separate and\r\n  independent of each other, in others (_Lankesteria_) they become\r\n  intertwined and interlocked, often to a remarkable extent\r\n  (_Diplodina_). The sexual nuclei next pass to the surface of the\r\n  processes and segments, where they take up a position of uniform\r\n  distribution. Around each, a small area of cytoplasm becomes\r\n  segregated, the whole often projecting as a little bud or hillock from\r\n  the general surface. These uninuclear protuberances are at length cut\r\n  off as the sporoblasts or gametes. Frequently a large amount of the\r\n  general protoplasm of each parent-individual is left over unused,\r\n  constituting two cystal residua, which may subsequently fuse; in\r\n  _Diplodina_, however, practically the whole cytoplasm is used up in\r\n  the formation of the gametes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: After Leger, from Lankester's _Treatise on Zoology_.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 13.--Development of the Gametes and Conjugation in _Stylorhynchus\r\n  longicollis_.\r\n\r\n    a, Undifferentiated gamete, attached to body of parent-individual.\r\n    b-d, Stages in development of motile male gamete.\r\n    e, Mature female gamete.\r\n    f, g, Stages in conjugation and nuclear union of the two elements.\r\n    h, Zygote (copula).\r\n    i, Spore, still with single nucleus and undivided sporoplasm.]\r\n\r\n  The sporoblasts themselves show all gradations from a condition of\r\n  marked differentiation into male and female (anisogamy), to one of\r\n  complete equality (isogamy). Anisogamy is most highly developed in\r\n  _Pterocephalus_. Here, the male elements (microgametes) are minute,\r\n  elongated and spindle-like in shape, with a minute rostrum anteriorly\r\n  and a long flagellum posteriorly, and very active; the female elements\r\n  (megagametes) are much larger, oblong to ovoid, and quite passive. In\r\n  _Stylorhynchus_ the difference between the conjugating gametes is not\r\n  quite so pronounced (fig. 13), the male elements being of about the\r\n  same bulk as the females, but pyriform instead of round, and\r\n  possessing a distinct flagellum; a most interesting point about this\r\n  parasite is that certain highly motile and spermatozoon-like male\r\n  gametes are formed (fig. 13), which are, however, quite sterile and\r\n  have acquired a subsidiary function. In other cases, again, the two\r\n  kinds of element exhibit either very slight differences (_Monocystis_)\r\n  or none (_Urospora_, _Gonospora_), in size and appearance, the chief\r\n  distinction being in the nuclei, those of the male elements being\r\n  smaller and chromatically denser than those of the females.\r\n\r\n  Lastly, in _Lankesteria_, _Gregarina_, _Clepsydrina_, _Diplocystis_\r\n  and _Diplodina_ complete isogamy is found, there being no apparent\r\n  difference whatever between the conjugating elements. Nevertheless,\r\n  these forms are also to be regarded as instances of binary sexuality\r\n  and not merely of exogamy; for it is practically certain that this\r\n  condition of isogamy is derived from one of typical anisogamy, through\r\n  a stage such as is seen in _Gonospora_, &c. And, similarly, just as in\r\n  all instances where the formation of differentiated gametes has been\r\n  observed, the origin of the two conjugates is from different\r\n  associates (parent-sporonts), and all the elements arising from the\r\n  same parent are of the same sex, so it is doubtless the case here.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Cyst of _Monocystis agilis_, the common\r\n  Gregarine of the Earthworm, showing ripe spores and absence of any\r\n  residual protoplasm in the cyst. (From Lankester.)]\r\n\r\n  The actual union is brought about or facilitated by the well-known\r\n  phenomenon termed the _danse des sporoblastes_, which is due to\r\n  various causes. In the case of highly-differentiated gametes\r\n  (_Pterocephalus_), the actively motile microgametes rush about here\r\n  and there, and seek out the female elements. In _Stylorhynchus_, Leger\r\n  has shown that the function of the sterile male gametes is to bring\r\n  about, by their vigorous movements, the _melee sexuelle_. In the forms\r\n  where the gametes are isogamous or only slightly differentiated and\r\n  (probably) not of themselves motile, other factors aid in producing\r\n  the necessary commingling. Thus in _Gregarina sp._ from the mealworm,\r\n  the unused somata or cystal residua become amoeboid and send out\r\n  processes which drive the peripherally-situated gametes round in the\r\n  cyst; in some cases where the residual soma becomes liquefied\r\n  (_Urospora_) the movements of the host are considered to be\r\n  sufficient; and lastly, in _Diplodina_, owing to the extent to which\r\n  the intertwining process is carried, if each gamete is not actually\r\n  contiguous to a suitable fellow-conjugant, a very slight movement or\r\n  mutual attraction will bring two such, when liberated, into contact.\r\n\r\n  An unusual modification of the process of sporoblast-formation and\r\n  conjugation, which occurs in _Ophryocystis_, must be mentioned. Here\r\n  encystment of two associates takes place as usual; the sporont-nucleus\r\n  of each, however, only divides twice, and one of the daughter-nuclei\r\n  resulting from each division degenerates. Hence only one\r\n  sporoblast-nucleus, representing a quarter of the original\r\n  nuclear-material, persists in each half. Around this some of the\r\n  cytoplasm condenses, the rest forming a residuum. The sporoblast or\r\n  gamete thus formed is completely isogamous and normally conjugates\r\n  with the like one from the other associate, when a single zygote\r\n  results which becomes a spore containing eight sporozoites, in the\r\n  ordinary manner. Sometimes, however, the septum between the two halves\r\n  of the cyst does not break down, in which case parthenogenesis occurs,\r\n  each sporoblast developing by itself into a small spore.\r\n\r\n  The two conjugating elements unite completely, cytoplasm with\r\n  cytoplasm and nucleus with nucleus, to form the definitive sporoblast\r\n  or zygote. The protoplasm assumes a definite outline, generally that\r\n  of an ovoid or barrel, and secretes a delicate membrane, the\r\n  ectospore. This subsequently becomes thickened, and often produced\r\n  into rims, spines or processes, giving rise to the characteristic\r\n  appearance of the Gregarine spore. Internal to the ectocyst, another,\r\n  thinner membrane, the endocyst, is also laid down. These two membranes\r\n  form the spore-wall (sporocyst). Meanwhile the contents of the spore\r\n  have been undergoing division. By successive divisions, usually\r\n  mitotic, the zygote-nucleus gives rise to eight daughter-nuclei, each\r\n  of which becomes the nucleus of a sporozoite. Next, the sporoplasm\r\n  becomes split longitudinally, around each nucleus, and thus eight\r\n  sickle-shaped (falciform) sporozoites are formed. There is usually a\r\n  certain amount of unused sporoplasm left over in the centre of the\r\n  spore, constituting the sporal residuum. It is important to note that\r\n  in all known Gregarines, with one exception, the number of sporozoites\r\n  in the spore is eight; the exception is _Selenidium_, in many ways far\r\n  from typical, where the number is half, viz. four.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Ripe Cyst of _Gregarina blattarum_, partially\r\n  emptied. (From Lankester.) a, Channels leading to the sporoducts; b,\r\n  Mass of spores still left in the cyst; c, Endocyst; d, The everted\r\n  sporoducts; e, Gelatinous ectocyst.]\r\n\r\n  Hitherto a variation from the general mode of spore-formation has been\r\n  considered to occur in certain Crustacean Gregarines, the\r\n  _Aggregatidae_ and the _Porosporidae_. The spores of these forms have\r\n  been regarded as gymnospores (naked), lacking the enveloping membranes\r\n  (sporocyst) of the ordinary spores, and the sporozoites, consequently,\r\n  as developed freely in the cyst. In the case of the first-named\r\n  parasites, however, what was taken for sporogony has been proved to be\r\n  really schizogony, and on other grounds these forms are, in the\r\n  present writer's opinion, preferably associated with the Coccidia\r\n  (q.v.). With regard to the _Porosporidae_, also, it is quite likely\r\n  that the gymnosporous cysts considered to belong to the Gregarine\r\n  _Porospora_ (as known in the trophic condition) have really no\r\n  connexion with it, but represent the schizogonous generation of some\r\n  other form, similar to _Aggregata_; in which case the true spores of\r\n  _Porospora_ have yet to be identified.\r\n\r\n  In the intestine of a fresh host the cysts rupture and the spores are\r\n  liberated. This is usually largely brought about by the swelling of\r\n  the residual protoplasm. Sometimes (e.g. _Gregarina_) long tubular\r\n  outgrowths, known as sporoducts (fig. 15), are developed from the\r\n  residual protoplasm, for the passage of the spores to the exterior.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Classification.\r\n\r\n  The Gregarines are extremely numerous, and include several families,\r\n  characterized, for the most part, by the form of the spores (fig. 16).\r\n  The specialized _Schizogregarinae_ are usually separated off from the\r\n  rest as a distinct sub-order.\r\n\r\n  SUB-ORDER I.--_Schizogregarinae._\r\n\r\n  Forms in which schizogonic reproduction is of general occurrence\r\n  during the extra-cellular, trophic phase. Three genera,\r\n  _Ophryocystis_, _Schizocystis_ and _Eleutheroschizon_, different\r\n  peculiarities of which have been referred to above. Mostly parasitic\r\n  in the intestine or Malpighian tubules of insects. (In this type of\r\n  parasite, as exemplified by _Ophryocystis_, the body was formerly\r\n  wrongly considered as amoeboid, and hence this genus was placed in a\r\n  special order, the _Amoebosporidia_.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From Wasielewski, after Leger.\r\n\r\n  FIG. 16.--Spores of various Gregarines.\r\n\r\n    a, _Eirmocystis, Sphaerocystis_, &c.\r\n    b, _Echinomera, Pterocephalus_, &c.\r\n    c, _Gregarina_, &c.\r\n    d, _Beloides_.\r\n    e, _Ancyrophora_.\r\n    f, _Stylorhynchidae_ (type of).\r\n    g, _Menosporidae_.\r\n    h, _Gonospora terebellae_.\r\n    i, _Ceratospora_.\r\n    k, _Urospora synaptae_.]\r\n\r\n  SUB-ORDER II.--_Eugregarinae._\r\n\r\n  Schizogony very exceptional, only occurring during the intracellular\r\n  phase, if at all. Gregarines fall naturally into two tribes, described\r\n  as cephalont and septate, or as acephalont and aseptate (haplocytic),\r\n  respectively. In strictness, however, as already mentioned, these two\r\n  sets of terms do not agree absolutely, and whichever set is adopted,\r\n  the other must be taken into account in estimating the proper position\r\n  of certain parasites. Here the cephalont or acephalont condition is\r\n  regarded as the more primary and fundamental.\r\n\r\n  Tribe A.--_Cephalina_ (practically equivalent to _Septata_).\r\n\r\n  Save exceptionally, the body possesses an epimerite, at any rate\r\n  during the early stages of growth, and is typically septate. Mostly\r\n  intestinal parasites of Arthropods.\r\n\r\n  The chief families, with representative genera, are as follows:\r\n  _Porosporidae_, with _Porospora gigantea_, at present thought to be\r\n  gymnosporous; _Gregarinidae_ (_Clepsydrinidae_), with _Gregarina_,\r\n  _Clepsydrina_, _Eirmocystis_, _Hyalospora_, _Cmenidospora_,\r\n  _Stenophora_; _Didymophyidae_, with _Didymophyes_; _Dactylophoridae_,\r\n  with _Dactylophorus_, _Pterocephalus_, _Echinomera_, _Rhopalonia_;\r\n  _Actinocephalidae_ with _Actinocephalus_, _Pyxinia_, _Coleorhynchus_,\r\n  _Stephanophora_, _Legeria_, _Stictospora_, _Pileocephalus_,\r\n  _Sciadophora_; _Acanthosporidae_ with _Acanthospora_, _Corycella_,\r\n  _Cometoides_; _Menosporidae_ with _Menospora_, _Hoplorhynchus_;\r\n  _Stylorhynchidae_, with _Stylorhynchus_, _Lophocephalus_;\r\n  _Doliocystidae_ with _Doliocystis_; and _Taeniocystidae_, with\r\n  _Taeniocystis_. The curious genus _Selenidium_ is somewhat apart.\r\n\r\n  Tribe B.--_Acephalina_ (practically equivalent to _Aseptata_,\r\n  _Haplocyta_).\r\n\r\n  The body never possesses an epimerite and is non-septate. Chiefly\r\n  coelomic parasites of \"worms,\" Holothurians and insects.\r\n\r\n  The _Aseptata_ have not been so completely arranged in families as the\r\n  _Septata_. Leger has distinguished two well-marked ones, but the\r\n  remaining genera still want classifying more in detail. Fam.\r\n  _Gonosporidae_, with _Gonospora_, _Diplodina_; and _Urosporidae_, with\r\n  _Urosopora_, _Cystobia_, _Lithocystis_, _Ceratospora_; the genera\r\n  _Monocystis_, _Diplocystis Lankesteria_ and _Zygocystis_ probably\r\n  constitute another; _Pterospora_ and, again, _Syncystis_ are distinct;\r\n  lastly, certain forms, e.g. _Zygosoma_, _Anchora_ (_Anchorina_), are\r\n  incompletely known.\r\n\r\n  There remains for mention the remarkable parasite, recently described\r\n  by J. Nusbaum (24) under the appropriate name of _Schaudinnella\r\n  henleae_, which inhabits the intestine of _Henlea leptodera_. Briefly\r\n  enumerated, the principal features in the life-cycle are as follows.\r\n  The young trophozoites (aseptate) are attached to the intestinal\r\n  cells, but practically entirely extracellular. Association is very\r\n  primitive in character and indiscriminate; it takes place\r\n  indifferently between individuals which will give rise to gametes of\r\n  the same or opposite sex. Often it is only temporary; at other times\r\n  it is multiple, several adults becoming more or less enclosed in a\r\n  gelatinous investment. Nevertheless, in no case does true encystment\r\n  occur, the sex-cells being developed practically free. The female\r\n  gametes are large and egg-like; the males, minute and sickle-like, but\r\n  with no flagellum and apparently non-motile. While many of the zygotes\r\n  (\"amphionts\") resulting from copulation pass out to the exterior, to\r\n  infect a new host, others, possessing a more delicate\r\n  investing-membrane, penetrate in between the intestinal cells,\r\n  producing a further infection (auto-infection). Numerous sporozoites\r\n  are formed in each zygote. It will be seen that _Schaudinnella_ is a\r\n  practically unique form. While, on the one hand, it recalls the\r\n  Gregarines in many ways, on the other hand it differs widely from them\r\n  in several characteristic features, being primitive in some respects,\r\n  but highly specialized in others, so that it cannot be properly\r\n  included in the order. _Schaudinnella_ rather represents a primitive\r\n  Ectosporan parasite, which has proceeded upon a line of its own,\r\n  intermediate between the Gregarines and Coccidia.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--Among the important papers relating to Gregarines are\r\n  the following: 1.

Educated at the Jesuit college at Nancy, he\r\nbecame cure of Embermenil and a teacher at the Jesuit school at\r\nPont-a-Mousson. In 1783 he was crowned by the academy of Nancy for his\r\n_Eloge de la poesie_, and in 1788 by that of Metz for an _Essai sur la\r\nregeneration physique et morale des Juifs_. He was elected in 1789 by\r\nthe clergy of the _bailliage_ of Nancy to the states-general, where he\r\nsoon became conspicuous in the group of clerical and lay deputies of\r\nJansenist or Gallican sympathies who supported the Revolution. He was\r\namong the first of the clergy to join the third estate, and contributed\r\nlargely to the union of the three orders; he presided at the permanent\r\nsitting of sixty-two hours while the Bastille was being attacked by the\r\npeople, and made a vehement speech against the enemies of the nation. He\r\nsubsequently took a leading share in the abolition of the privileges of\r\nthe nobles and the Church. Under the new civil constitution of the\r\nclergy, to which he was the first priest to take the oath (December 27,\r\n1790), he was elected bishop by two departments. He selected that of\r\nLoire-et-Cher, taking the old title of bishop of Blois, and for ten\r\nyears (1791-1801) ruled his diocese with exemplary zeal. An ardent\r\nrepublican, it was he who in the first session of the National\r\nConvention (September 21, 1792) proposed the motion for the abolition of\r\nthe kingship, in a speech in which occurred the memorable phrase that\r\n\"kings are in the moral order what monsters are in the natural.\" On the\r\n15th of November he delivered a speech in which he demanded that the\r\nking should be brought to trial, and immediately afterwards was elected\r\npresident of the Convention, over which he presided in his episcopal\r\ndress. During the trial of Louis XVI., being absent with other three\r\ncolleagues on a mission for the union of Savoy to France, he along with\r\nthem wrote a letter urging the condemnation of the king, but omitting\r\nthe words _a mort_; and he endeavoured to save the life of the king by\r\nproposing in the Convention that the penalty of death should be\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\nWhen on the 7th of November 1793 Gobel, bishop of Paris, was intimidated\r\ninto resigning his episcopal office at the bar of the Convention,\r\nGregoire, who was temporarily absent from the sitting, hearing what had\r\nhappened, hurried to the hall, and in the face of a howling mob of\r\ndeputies refused to abjure either his religion or his office. He was\r\nprepared to face the death which he expected; but his courage, a rare\r\nquality at that time, won the day, and the hubbub subsided in cries of\r\n\"Let Gregoire have his way!\" Throughout the Terror, in spite of attacks\r\nin the Convention, in the press, and on placards posted at the street\r\ncorners, he appeared in the streets in his episcopal dress and daily\r\nread mass in his house. After Robespierre's fall he was the first to\r\nadvocate the reopening of the churches (speech of December 21, 1794). He\r\nalso exerted himself to get measures put in execution for restraining\r\nthe vandalistic fury against the monuments of art, extended his\r\nprotection to artists and men of letters, and devoted much of his\r\nattention to the reorganization of the public libraries, the\r\nestablishment of botanic gardens, and the improvement of technical\r\neducation. He had taken during the Constituent Assembly a great interest\r\nin Negro emancipation, and it was on his motion that men of colour in\r\nthe French colonies were admitted to the same rights as whites. On the\r\nestablishment of the new constitution, Gregoire was elected to the\r\nCouncil of 500, and after the 18th Brumaire he became a member of the\r\nCorps Legislatif, then of the Senate (1801). He took the lead in the\r\nnational church councils of 1797 and 1801; but he was strenuously\r\nopposed to Napoleon's policy of reconciliation with the Holy See, and\r\nafter the signature of the concordat he resigned his bishopric (October\r\n8, 1801). He was one of the minority of five in the Senate who voted\r\nagainst the proclamation of the empire, and he opposed the creation of\r\nthe new nobility and the divorce of Napoleon from Josephine; but\r\nnotwithstanding this he was subsequently created a count of the empire\r\nand officer of the Legion of Honour. During the later years of\r\nNapoleon's reign he travelled in England and Germany, but in 1814 he had\r\nreturned to France and was one of the chief instigators of the action\r\nthat was taken against the empire.\r\n\r\nTo the clerical and ultra-royalist faction which was supreme in the\r\nLower Chamber and in the circles of the court after the second\r\nRestoration, Gregoire, as a revolutionist and a schismatic bishop, was\r\nan object of double loathing. He was expelled from the Institute and\r\nforced into retirement. But even in this period of headlong reaction his\r\ninfluence was felt and feared. In 1814 he had published a work, _De la\r\nconstitution francaise de l'an 1814_, in which he commented on the\r\nCharter from a Liberal point of view, and this reached its fourth\r\nedition in 1819. In this latter year he was elected to the Lower Chamber\r\nby the department of Isere. By the powers of the Quadruple Alliance this\r\nevent was regarded as of the most sinister omen, and the question was\r\neven raised of a fresh armed intervention in France under the terms of\r\nthe secret treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. To prevent such a catastrophe\r\nLouis XVIII. decided on a modification of the franchise; the Dessolle\r\nministry resigned; and the first act of Decazes, the new premier, was to\r\ncarry a vote in the chamber annulling the election of Gregoire. From\r\nthis time onward the ex-bishop lived in retirement, occupying himself in\r\nliterary pursuits and in correspondence with most of the eminent savants\r\nof Europe; but as he had been deprived of his pension as a senator he\r\nwas compelled to sell his library to obtain means of support. He died on\r\nthe 20th of May 1831.\r\n\r\nTo the last Gregoire remained a devout Catholic, exactly fulfilling all\r\nhis obligations as a Christian and a priest; but he refused to budge an\r\ninch from his revolutionary principles. During his last illness he\r\nconfessed to his parish _cure_, a priest of Jansenist sympathies, and\r\nexpressed his desire for the last sacraments of the Church. These the\r\narchbishop of Paris would only concede on condition that he would\r\nretract his oath to the civil constitution of the clergy, which he\r\nperemptorily refused to do. Thereupon, in defiance of the archbishop,\r\nthe abbe Baradere gave him the _viaticum_, while the rite of extreme\r\nunction was administered by the abbe Guillon, an opponent of the civil\r\nconstitution, without consulting the archbishop or the parish cure. The\r\nattitude of the archbishop roused great excitement in Paris, and the\r\ngovernment had to take precautions to avoid a repetition of the riots\r\nwhich in the preceding February had led to the sacking of the church of\r\nSt Germain l'Auxerrois and the archiepiscopal palace. On the day after\r\nhis death Gregoire's funeral was celebrated at the church of the\r\nAbbaye-aux-Bois; the clergy of the church had absented themselves in\r\nobedience to the archbishop's orders, but mass was sung by the abbe\r\nGrieu assisted by two clergy, the catafalque being decorated with the\r\nepiscopal insignia. After the hearse set out from the church the horses\r\nwere unyoked, and it was dragged by students to the cemetery of\r\nMontparnasse, the cortege being followed by a sympathetic crowd of some\r\n20,000 people.\r\n\r\nWhatever his merits as a writer or as a philanthropist, Gregoire's name\r\nlives in history mainly by reason of his wholehearted effort to prove\r\nthat Catholic Christianity is not irreconcilable with modern conceptions\r\nof political liberty. In this effort he was defeated, mainly because the\r\nRevolution, for lack of experience in the right use of liberty, changed\r\ninto a military despotism which allied itself with the spiritual\r\ndespotism of Rome; partly because, when the Revolution was overthrown,\r\nthe parties of reaction sought salvation in the \"union of altar and\r\nthrone.\" Possibly Gregoire's Gallicanism was fundamentally\r\nirreconcilable with the Catholic idea of authority. At least it made\r\ntheir traditional religion possible for those many French Catholics who\r\nclung passionately to the benefits the Revolution had brought them; and\r\nhad it prevailed, it might have spared France and the world that fatal\r\ngulf between Liberalism and Catholicism which Pius IX.'s Syllabus of\r\n1864 sought to make impassable.\r\n\r\n  Besides several political pamphlets, Gregoire was the author of\r\n  _Histoire des sectes religieuses, depuis le commencement du siecle\r\n  dernier jusqu'a l'epoque actuelle_ (2 vols., 1810); _Essai historique\r\n  sur les libertes de l'eglise gallicane_ (1818); _De l'influence du\r\n  Christianisme sur la condition des femmes_ (1821); _Histoire des\r\n  confesseurs des empereurs, des rois, et d'autres princes_ (1824);\r\n  _Histoire du mariage des pretres en France_ (1826). _Gregoireana, ou\r\n  resume general de la conduite, des actions, et des ecrits de M. le\r\n  comte Henri Gregoire_, preceded by a biographical notice by Cousin\r\n  d'Avalon, was published in 1821; and the _Memoires ... de Gregoire_,\r\n  with a biographical notice by H. Carnot, appeared in 1837 (2 vols.).\r\n  See also A. Debidour, _L'Abbe Gregoire_ (1881); A. Gazier, Etudes sur\r\n  l'histoire religieuse de la Revolution Francaise (1883); L. Maggiolo,\r\n  La Vie et les oeuvres de l'abbe Gregoire (Nancy, 1884), and numerous\r\n  articles in _La Revolution Francaise_; E.

In 1326 Gregoras\r\nproposed (in a still extant treatise) certain reforms in the calendar,\r\nwhich the emperor refused to carry out for fear of disturbances; nearly\r\ntwo hundred years later they were introduced by Gregory XIII. on almost\r\nthe same lines. When Andronicus was dethroned (1328) by his grandson\r\nAndronicus III., Gregoras shared his downfall and retired into private\r\nlife. Attacked by Barlaam, the famous monk of Calabria, he was with\r\ndifficulty persuaded to come forward and meet him in a war of words, in\r\nwhich Barlaam was worsted. This greatly enhanced his reputation and\r\nbrought him a large number of pupils. Gregoras remained loyal to the\r\nelder Andronicus to the last, but after his death he succeeded in\r\ngaining the favour of his grandson, by whom he was appointed to conduct\r\nthe unsuccessful negotiations (for a union of the Greek and Latin\r\nchurches) with the ambassadors of Pope John XXII. (1333). Gregoras\r\nsubsequently took an important part in the Hesychast controversy, in\r\nwhich he violently opposed Gregorius Palamas, the chief supporter of the\r\nsect. After the doctrines of Palamas had been recognized at the synod of\r\n1351, Gregoras, who refused to acquiesce, was practically imprisoned in\r\na monastery for two years. Nothing is known of the end of his life. His\r\nchief work is his _Roman History_, in 37 books, of the years 1204 to\r\n1359. It thus partly supplements and partly continues the work of George\r\nPachymeres. Gregoras shows considerable industry, but his style is\r\npompous and affected. Far too much space is devoted to religious matters\r\nand dogmatic quarrels. This work and that of John Cantacuzene supplement\r\nand correct each other, and should be read together. The other writings\r\nof Gregoras, which (with a few exceptions) still remain unpublished,\r\nattest his great versatility. Amongst them may be mentioned a history of\r\nthe dispute with Palamas; biographies of his uncle and early instructor\r\nJohn, metropolitan of Heraclea, and of the martyr Codratus of Antioch;\r\nfuneral orations for Theodore Metochita, and the two emperors\r\nAndronicus; commentaries on the wanderings of Odysseus and on Synesius's\r\ntreatise on dreams; tracts on orthography and on words of doubtful\r\nmeaning; a philosophical dialogue called _Florentius or Concerning\r\nWisdom_; astronomical treatises on the date of Easter and the\r\npreparation of the astrolabe; and an extensive correspondence.\r\n\r\n  _Editions_: in Bonn _Corpus scriptorum hist.

After spending some years in teaching he took up his\r\nresidence in Italy in 1852, remaining in that country for over twenty\r\nyears. He was made a citizen of Rome, and he died at Munich on the 1st\r\nof May 1891. Gregorovius's interest in and acquaintance with Italy and\r\nItalian history is mainly responsible for his great book, _Geschichte\r\nder Stadt Rom im Mittelalter_ (Stuttgart, 1859-1872, and other\r\neditions), a work of much erudition and interest, which has been\r\ntranslated into English by A. Hamilton (13 vols., 1894-1900), and also\r\ninto Italian at the expense of the Romans (Venice, 1874-1876). It deals\r\nwith the history of Rome from about A.D. 400 to the death of Pope\r\nClement VII. in 1534, and in the words of its author it describes \"how,\r\nfrom the time of Charles the Great to that of Charles V., the historic\r\nsystem of the papacy remained inseparable from that of the Empire.\" The\r\nother works of Gregorovius include: _Geschichte des Kaisers Hadrian und\r\nseiner Zeit_ (Konigsberg, 1851), English translation by M. E. Robinson\r\n(1898); _Corsica_ (Stuttgart, 1854), English translation by R. Martineau\r\n(1855); _Lucrezia Borgia_ (Stuttgart, 1874), English translation by J.\r\nL. Garner (1904); _Die Grabdenkmaler der Papste_ (Leipzig, 1881),\r\nEnglish translation by R. W. Seton-Watson (1903); _Wanderjahre in\r\nItalien_ (5 vols., Leipzig, 1888-1892); _Geschichte der Stadt Athen im\r\nMittelalter_ (1889); _Kleine Schriften zur Geschichte der Kultur_\r\n(Leipzig, 1887-1892); and _Urban VIII. im Widerspruch zu Spanien und dem\r\nKaiser_ (Stuttgart, 1879). This last work was translated into Italian by\r\nthe author himself (Rome, 1879). Gregorovius was also something of a\r\npoet; he wrote a drama, _Der Tod des Tiberius_ (1851), and some\r\n_Gedichte_ (Leipzig, 1891).\r\n\r\n  His _Romische Tagebucher_ were edited by F. Althaus (Stuttgart, 1892),\r\n  and were translated into English as the _Roman Journals of F.\r\n  Gregorovius_, by A. Hamilton (1907).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREGORY, ST (c. 213-c. 270), surnamed in later ecclesiastical tradition\r\nThaumaturgus (the miracle-worker), was born of noble and wealthy pagan\r\nparents at Neocaesarea in Pontus, about A.D. 213. His original name was\r\nTheodorus. He took up the study of civil law, and, with his brother\r\nAthenodorus, was on his way to Berytus to complete his training when at\r\nCaesarea he met Origen, and became his pupil and then his convert (A.D.\r\n233). In returning to Cappadocia some five years after his conversion,\r\nit had been his original intention to live a retired ascetic life (Eus.\r\n_H.E._ vi. 30), but, urged by Origen, and at last almost compelled by\r\nPhaedimus of Amasia, his metropolitan, neither of whom was willing to\r\nsee so much learning, piety and masculine energy practically lost to the\r\nchurch, he, after many attempts to evade the dignity, was consecrated\r\nbishop of his native town (about 240). His episcopate, which lasted some\r\nthirty years, was characterized by great missionary zeal, and by so much\r\nsuccess that, according to the (doubtless somewhat rhetorical) statement\r\nof Gregory of Nyssa, whereas at the outset of his labours there were\r\nonly seventeen Christians in the city, there were at his death only\r\nseventeen persons in all who had not embraced Christianity. This result\r\nhe achieved in spite of the Decian persecution (250-251), during which\r\nhe had felt it to be his duty to absent himself from his diocese, and\r\nnotwithstanding the demoralizing effects of an irruption of barbarians\r\n(Goths and Boranians) who laid waste the diocese in A.D. 253-254.\r\nGregory, although he has not always escaped the charge of Sabellianism,\r\nnow holds an undisputed place among the fathers of the church; and\r\nalthough the turn of his mind was practical rather than speculative, he\r\nis known to have taken an energetic part in most of the doctrinal\r\ncontroversies of his time. He was active at the first synod of Antioch\r\n(A.D. 264-265), which investigated and condemned the heresies of Paul of\r\nSamosata; and the rapid spread in Pontus of a Trinitarianism approaching\r\nthe Nicene type is attributed in large measure to the weight of his\r\ninfluence. Gregory is believed to have died in the reign of Aurelian,\r\nabout the year 270, though perhaps an earlier date is more probable. His\r\nfestival (semiduplex) is observed by the Roman Catholic Church on the\r\n17th of November.\r\n\r\n  For the facts of his biography we have an outline of his early years\r\n  in his eulogy on Origen, and incidental notices in the writings of\r\n  Eusebius, of Basil of Caesarea and Jerome. Gregory of Nyssa's\r\n  untrustworthy panegyric represents him as having wrought miracles of a\r\n  very startling description; but nothing related by him comes near the\r\n  astounding narratives given in the _Martyrologies_, or even in the\r\n  _Breviarium Romanum_, in connexion with his name.\r\n\r\n  The principal works of Gregory Thaumaturgus are the _Panegyricus in\r\n  Origenem_ ([Greek: Eis Origenen panegyrikos logos]), which he wrote\r\n  when on the point of leaving the school of that great master (it\r\n  contains a valuable minute description of Origen's mode of\r\n  instruction), a _Metaphrasis in Ecclesiasten_, characterized by Jerome\r\n  as \"short but useful\"; and an _Epistola canonica_, which treats of the\r\n  discipline to be undergone by those Christians who under pressure of\r\n  persecution had relapsed into paganism, but desired to be restored to\r\n  the privileges of the Church. It gives a good picture of the\r\n  conditions of the time, and shows Gregory to be a true shepherd (cf.\r\n  art PENANCE). The [Greek: Ekthesis pisteos] (_Expositio fidei_), a\r\n  short creed usually attributed to Gregory, and traditionally alleged\r\n  to have been received by him immediately in vision from the apostle\r\n  John himself, is probably authentic. A sort of Platonic dialogue of\r\n  doubtful authenticity \"on the impassivity and the passivity of God\" in\r\n  Syriac is in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n  _Editions_: Gerhard Voss (Mainz, 1604), Fronto Ducaus (Paris, 1622),\r\n  Migne, Patr.

(where full bibliographies are given).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREGORY, ST, OF NAZIANZUS (329-389), surnamed Theologus, one of the four\r\ngreat fathers of the Eastern Church, was born about the year A.D. 329,\r\nat or near Nazianzus, Cappadocia. His father, also named Gregory, had\r\nlately become bishop of the diocese; his mother, Nonna, exercised a\r\npowerful influence over the religious convictions of both father and\r\nson. Gregory visited successively the two Caesareas, Alexandria and\r\nAthens, as a student of grammar, mathematics, rhetoric and philosophy;\r\nat Athens he had for fellow-students Basil (q.v.), who afterwards became\r\nbishop of Caesarea, and Julian, afterwards emperor. Shortly after his\r\nreturn to his father's house at Nazianzus (about the year 360) Gregory\r\nreceived baptism. He resolved to give himself to the service of\r\nreligion; but for some time, and indeed more or less throughout his\r\nwhole life, was in a state of hesitation as to the form which that\r\nservice ought to take. Strongly inclined by nature and education to a\r\ncontemplative life spent among books and in the society of congenial\r\nfriends, he was continually urged by outward circumstances, as well as\r\nby an inward call, to active pastoral labour. The spirit of refined\r\nintellectual monasticism, which clung to him through life and never\r\nceased to struggle for the ascendancy, was about this time strongly\r\nencouraged by his intercourse with Basil, who induced him to share the\r\nexalted pleasures of his retirement in Pontus. To this period belongs\r\nthe preparation of the [Greek: Philokalia], a sort of chrestomathy\r\ncompiled by the two friends from the writings of Origen. But the events\r\nwhich were stirring the political and ecclesiastical life of Cappadocia,\r\nand indeed of the whole Roman world, made a career of learned leisure\r\ndifficult if not impossible to a man of Gregory's position and\r\ntemperament. The emperor Constantius, having by intrigue and\r\nintimidation succeeded in thrusting a semi-Arian formula upon the\r\nWestern bishops assembled at Ariminum in Italy, had next attempted to\r\nfollow the same course with the Eastern episcopate. The aged bishop of\r\nNazianzus having yielded to the imperial threats, a great storm arose\r\namong the monks of the diocese, which was only quelled by the influence\r\nof the younger Gregory, who shortly afterwards (about 361) was ordained\r\nto the priesthood. After a vain attempt to evade his new duties and\r\nresponsibilities by flight, he appears to have continued to act as a\r\npresbyter in his father's diocese without interruption for some\r\nconsiderable time; and it is probable that his two _Invectives_ against\r\nJulian are to be assigned to this period. Subsequently (about 372),\r\nunder a pressure which he somewhat resented, he allowed himself to be\r\nnominated by Basil as bishop of Sasima, a miserable little village some\r\n32 m. from Tyana; but he seems hardly, if at all, to have assumed the\r\nduties of this diocese, for after another interval of \"flight\" we find\r\nhim once more (about 372-373) at Nazianzus, assisting his aged father,\r\non whose death (374) he retired to Seleucia in Isauria for a period of\r\nsome years. Meanwhile a more important field for his activities was\r\nopening up. Towards 378-379 the small and depressed remnant of the\r\northodox party in Constantinople sent him an urgent summons to undertake\r\nthe task of resuscitating their cause, so long persecuted and borne down\r\nby the Arians of the capital. With the accession of Theodosius to the\r\nimperial throne, the prospect of success to the Nicene doctrine had\r\ndawned, if only it could find some courageous and devoted champion. The\r\nfame of Gregory as a learned and eloquent disciple of Origen, and still\r\nmore of Athanasius, pointed him out as such a defender; nor could he\r\nresist the appeal made to him, although he took the step reluctantly.\r\nOnce arrived in Constantinople, he laboured so zealously and well that\r\nthe orthodox party speedily gathered strength; and the small apartment\r\nin which they had been accustomed to meet was soon exchanged for a vast\r\nand celebrated church which received the significant name of Anastasia,\r\nthe Church of the Resurrection. Among the hearers of Gregory were to be\r\nfound, not only churchmen like Jerome and Evagrius, but also heretics\r\nand pagans; and it says much for the sound wisdom and practical tact of\r\nthe preacher that he set himself less to build up and defend a doctrinal\r\nposition than to urge his flock to the cultivation of the loving\r\nChristian spirit which cherishes higher aims than mere heresy hunting or\r\nendless disputation. Doctrinal, nevertheless, he was, as is abundantly\r\nshown by the famous five discourses on the Trinity, which earned for him\r\nthe distinctive appellation of [Greek: theologos]. These orations are\r\nthe finest exposition of the Catholic doctrine of the Trinity as\r\nconceived by the orthodox teachers of the East, and they were directed\r\nespecially against the Eunomians and Macedonians. \"There is perhaps no\r\nsingle book in Greek patristic literature to which the student who\r\ndesires to gain an exact and comprehensive view of Greek theology can be\r\nmore confidently referred.\" With the arrival of Theodosius in 380 came\r\nthe visible triumph of the orthodox cause; the metropolitan see was then\r\nconferred upon Gregory, and after the assembling of the second\r\necumenical council in 381 he received consecration from Meletius. In\r\nconsequence, however, of a spirit of discord and envy which had\r\nmanifested itself in connexion with this promotion, he soon afterwards\r\nresigned his dignity and withdrew into comparative retirement. The rest\r\nof his days were spent partly at Nazianzus in ecclesiastical affairs,\r\nand partly on his neighbouring patrimonial estate at Arianzus, where he\r\nfollowed his favourite literary pursuits, especially poetical\r\ncomposition, until his death, which occurred in 389 or 390. His festival\r\nis celebrated in the Eastern Church on the 25th and 30th of January, in\r\nthe Western on the 9th of May (duplex).\r\n\r\n  His extant works consist of poems, epistles and orations. The poems,\r\n  which include epigrams, elegies and an autobiographical sketch, have\r\n  been frequently printed, the _editio princeps_ being the Aldine\r\n  (1504). Other editions are those of Tollius (1696) and Muratori\r\n  (1709); a volume of _Carmina selecta_ also has been edited by Dronke\r\n  (1840). The tragedy entitled [Greek: Christos paschon] usually\r\n  included is certainly not genuine. Gregory's poetry did not absorb his\r\n  best energies; it was adopted in his later years as a recreation\r\n  rather than as a serious pursuit; thus it is occasionally delicate,\r\n  graphic, beautiful, but it is not sustained. Of the hymns none have\r\n  passed into ecclesiastical use. The letters are entitled to a higher\r\n  place in literature. They are always easy and natural; and there is\r\n  nothing forced in the manner in which their acute, witty and profound\r\n  sayings are introduced. Those to Basil introduce us to the story of a\r\n  most romantic friendship, those to Cledonius have theological value\r\n  for their bearing on the Apollinarian controversy. As an orator he was\r\n  so facile, vigorous and persuasive, that men forgot his small stature\r\n  and emaciated countenance. Forty-five orations are extant. Gregory was\r\n  less an independent theologian than an interpreter. He was influenced\r\n  by Athanasius in his Christology, by Origen in his anthropology, for,\r\n  though teaching original sin and deriving human mortality from the\r\n  Fall, he insists on the ability of the human will to choose the good\r\n  and to co-operate in the work of salvation with the will of God.\r\n  Though possessed neither of Basil's gift of government nor of Gregory\r\n  of Nyssa's power of speculative thought, he worthily takes a place in\r\n  that triumvirate of Cappadocians whom the Catholic Church gratefully\r\n  recognizes as having been, during the critical struggles in the latter\r\n  half of the 4th century, the best defenders of its faith. The _Opera\r\n  omnia_ were first published by Hervagius (Basel, 1550); the\r\n  subsequent editions have been those of Billius (Paris, 1609, 1611;\r\n  aucta ex interpretatione Morelli, 1630), of the Benedictines (begun in\r\n  1778, but interrupted by the French Revolution and not completed until\r\n  1840, Caillau being the final editor) and of Migne. The _Theological\r\n  Orations_ (edited by A. J. Mason) were published separately at\r\n  Cambridge in 1899.\r\n\r\n  Scattered notices of the life of Gregory Nazianzen are to be found in\r\n  the writings of Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret and Rufinus, as well as\r\n  in his own letters and poems. The data derived from these sources do\r\n  not always harmonize with the account of Suidas. The earlier modern\r\n  authorities, such as Tillemont (_Mem. Eccl._ t. ix.) and Leclerc\r\n  (_Bib. Univ._ t. xviii.), were used by Gibbon. See also C. Ullmann,\r\n  _Gregorius von Nazianz, der Theologe_ (1825; Eng. trans. by G. F.\r\n  Coxe, M.A., 1857); A.

Theologie_, vii. 138.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREGORY, ST, OF NYSSA (c. 331-c. 396), one of the four great fathers of\r\nthe Eastern Church, designated by one of the later ecumenical councils\r\nas \"a father of fathers,\" was a younger brother of Basil (the Great),\r\nbishop of Caesarea, and was born (probably) at Neocaesarea about A.D.\r\n331. For his education he was chiefly indebted to his elder brother. At\r\na comparatively early age he entered the church, and held for some time\r\nthe office of anagnost or reader; subsequently he manifested a desire to\r\ndevote himself to the secular life as a rhetorician, an impulse which\r\nwas checked by the earnest remonstrances of Gregory of Nazianzus.\r\nFinally, in 371 or 372 he was ordained by his brother Basil to the\r\nbishopric of Nyssa, a small town in Cappadocia. Here he is usually said\r\n(but on inadequate data) to have adopted the opinion then gaining ground\r\nin favour of the celibacy of the clergy, and to have separated from his\r\nwife Theosebia, who became a deaconess in the church. His strict\r\northodoxy on the subject of the Trinity and the Incarnation, together\r\nwith his vigorous eloquence, combined to make him peculiarly obnoxious\r\nto the Arian faction, which was at that time in the ascendant through\r\nthe protection of the emperor Valens; and in 375, the synod of Ancyra,\r\nconvened by Demetrius the Arian governor of Pontus, condemned him for\r\nalleged irregularities in his election and in the administration of the\r\nfinances of his diocese. In 376 he was deprived of his see, and Valens\r\nsent him into exile, whence he did not return till the publication of\r\nthe edict of Gratian in 378. Shortly afterwards he took part in the\r\nproceedings of the synod which met at Antioch in Caria, principally in\r\nconnexion with the Meletian schism. At the great ecumenical council held\r\nat Constantinople in 381, he was a conspicuous champion of the orthodox\r\nfaith; according to Nicephorus, indeed, the additions made to the Nicene\r\ncreed were entirely due to his suggestion, but this statement is of\r\ndoubtful authority. That his eloquence was highly appreciated is shown\r\nby the facts that he pronounced the discourse at the consecration of\r\nGregory of Nazianzus, and that he was chosen to deliver the funeral\r\noration on the death of Meletius the first president of the council. In\r\nthe following year, moreover (382), he was commissioned by the council\r\nto inspect and set in order the churches of Arabia, in connexion with\r\nwhich mission he also visited Jerusalem. The impressions he gathered\r\nfrom this journey may, in part at least, be gathered from his famous\r\nletter _De euntibus Hierosolyma_, in which an opinion strongly\r\nunfavourable to pilgrimages is expressed. In 383 he was probably again\r\nin Constantinople; where in 385 he pronounced the funeral orations of\r\nthe princess Pulcheria and afterwards of the empress Placilla. Once more\r\nwe read of him in 394 as having been present in that metropolis at the\r\nsynod held under the presidency of Nectarius to settle a controversy\r\nwhich had arisen among the bishops of Arabia; in the same year he\r\nassisted at the consecration of the new church of the apostles at\r\nChalcedon, on which occasion there is reason to believe that his\r\ndiscourse commonly but wrongly known as that [Greek: Eis ten heautou\r\ncheirotonian] was delivered. The exact date of his death is unknown;\r\nsome authorities refer it to 396, others to 400. His festival is\r\nobserved by the Greek Church on the 10th of January; in the Western\r\nmartyrologies he is commemorated on the 9th of March.\r\n\r\nGregory of Nyssa was not so firm and able an administrator as his\r\nbrother Basil, nor so magnificent an orator as Gregory of Nazianzus, but\r\nhe excelled them both, alike as a speculative and constructive\r\ntheologian, and in the wide extent of his acquirements. His teaching,\r\nthough strictly trinitarian, shows considerable freedom and originality\r\nof thought; in many points his mental and spiritual affinities with\r\nOrigen show themselves with advantage, as in his doctrine of [Greek:\r\napokatastasis] or final restoration. There are marked pantheistic\r\ntendencies, e.g. the inclusion of sin as a necessary part of the\r\ncosmical process, which make him akin to the pantheistic monophysites\r\nand to some modern thinkers.\r\n\r\n  His style has been frequently praised by competent authorities for\r\n  sweetness, richness and elegance. His numerous works may be classified\r\n  under five heads: (1) Treatises in doctrinal and polemical theology.\r\n  Of these the most important is that _Against Eunomius_ in twelve\r\n  books. Its doctrinal thesis (which is supported with great philosophic\r\n  acumen and rhetorical power) is the divinity and consubstantiality of\r\n  the Word; incidentally the character of Basil, which Eunomius had\r\n  aspersed, is vindicated, and the heretic himself is held up to scorn\r\n  and contempt. This is the work which, most probably in a shorter\r\n  draft, was read by its author when at Constantinople before Gregory\r\n  Nazianzen and Jerome in 381 (Jerome, _De vir. ill._ 128). To the same\r\n  class belong the treatise _To Ablavius_, against the tritheists; _On\r\n  Faith_, against the Arians; _On Common Notions_, in explanation of the\r\n  terms in current employment with regard to the Trinity; _Ten\r\n  Syllogisms_, against the Manichaeans; _To Theophilus_, against the\r\n  Apollinarians; an _Antirrhetic_ against the same; _Against Fate_, a\r\n  disputation with a heathen philosopher; _De anima et resurrectione_, a\r\n  dialogue with his dying sister Macrina; and the _Oratio catechetica\r\n  magna_, an argument for the incarnation as the best possible form of\r\n  redemption, intended to convince educated pagans and Jews. (2)\r\n  Practical treatises. To this category belong the tracts _On Virginity_\r\n  and _On Pilgrimages_; as also the _Canonical Epistle_ upon the rules\r\n  of penance. (3) Expository and homiletical works, including the\r\n  _Hexaemeron_, and several series of discourses _On the Workmanship of\r\n  Man_, _On the Inscriptions of the Psalms_, _On the Sixth Psalm_, _On\r\n  the first three Chapters of Ecclesiastes_, _On Canticles_, _On the\r\n  Lord's Prayer_ and _On the Eight Beatitudes_. (4) Biographical,\r\n  consisting chiefly of funeral orations. (5) Letters.\r\n\r\n  The only complete editions of the whole works are those by Fronton le\r\n  Duc (Fronto Ducaus, Paris, 1615; with additions, 1618 and 1638) and by\r\n  Migne. G. H. Forbes began an excellent critical edition, but only two\r\n  parts of the first volume appeared (Burntisland, 1855 and 1861)\r\n  containing the _Explicatio apologetica in hexaemeron_ and the _De\r\n  opificio hominis_. Of the new edition projected by F. Oehler only the\r\n  first volume, containing the _Opera dogmatica_, has appeared (1865).\r\n  There have been numerous editions of several single treatises, as for\r\n  example of the _Oratio catechetica_ (J. G. Krabinger, Munich, 1838; J.\r\n  H. Crawley, Cambridge, 1903), _De precatione_ and _De anima et\r\n  resurrectione_.\r\n\r\n  See F. W. Farrar, _Lives of the Fathers_, ii. 56-83, the monograph by\r\n  J. Rupp (_Gregors, des Bischofs von Nyssa, Leben und Meinungen_,\r\n  Leipzig, 1834), and compare P. Heyns (_Disputatio historico-theologica\r\n  de Greg. Nyss._, 1835), C. W. Moller (_Gregorii Nyss. doctrinam de\r\n  hominis natura et illustravit et cum Origeniana comparavit_, 1854) and\r\n  J. N. Stigler, _Die Psychologie des h. Gregors von Nyssa_ (Regensburg,\r\n  1857), and many smaller monographs cited in Hauck-Herzog's _Realencyk.\r\n  fur prot. Theol._ vii. 149.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREGORY, ST, OF TOURS (538-594), historian of the Franks, was born in\r\nthe chief city of the Arverni (the modern Clermont-Ferrand) on the 30th\r\nof November 538. His real name was Georgius Florentius, Georgius being\r\nhis grandfather's name and Florentius his father's. He was called\r\nGregory after his maternal great-grandfather, the bishop of Langres.\r\nGregory belonged to an illustrious senatorial family, many of whose\r\nmembers held high office in the church and bear honoured names in the\r\nhistory of Christianity. He was descended, it is said, from Vettius\r\nEpagathus, who was martyred at Lyons in 177 with St Pothinus; his\r\npaternal uncle, Gallus, was bishop of Clermont; his maternal\r\ngrand-uncle, Nicetius (St Nizier), occupied the see of Lyons; and he was\r\na kinsman of Euphronius, bishop of Tours.\r\n\r\nGregory lost his father early, and his mother Armentaria settled in the\r\nkingdom of Burgundy on an estate belonging to her near Cavaillon, where\r\nher son often visited her. Gregory was brought up at Clermont-Ferrand by\r\nhis uncle Gallus and by his successor, Avitus, and there he received his\r\neducation. Among profane authors he read the first six books of the\r\n_Aeneid_ and Sallust's history of the Catiline conspiracy, but his\r\neducation was mainly religious. The principles of religion he learnt\r\nfrom the Bible, Sulpicius Severus and some lives of saints, but to\r\npatristic literature and the subtleties of theology he remained a\r\nstranger. In 563, at the age of twenty-five, he was ordained deacon.\r\nFalling seriously ill, he went to Tours to seek a cure at the tomb of St\r\nMartin. At Tours he lived with Euphronius, and so great was the young\r\nman's popularity that, on the death of Euphronius in 573, the people\r\nunanimously designated him bishop.\r\n\r\nAt that time Tours belonged to Austrasia, and King Sigebert hastened to\r\nconfirm Gregory's election. After the assassination of Sigebert (575),\r\nthe province was ruled by Chilperic for nine years, during which period\r\nGregory displayed the greatest energy in protecting his town and church\r\nfrom the Frankish king. He had to contend with Count Leudast, the\r\ngovernor of Tours; despite all the king's threats, he refused to give up\r\nChilperic's son Meroving, who had sought refuge from his father's wrath\r\nat the sanctuary of St Martin; and he defended Bishop Pretextatus\r\nagainst Chilperic, by whom he had been condemned for celebrating the\r\nmarriage of Merovech and Queen Brunhilda. In 580 Gregory was himself\r\naccused before a council at Berny of using abusive language against\r\nQueen Fredegond, but he cleared himself of the charge by an oath and was\r\nacquitted. On the death of Chilperic, Tours remained for two years\r\n(584-585) in the hands of Guntram, but when Guntram adopted his nephew\r\nChildebert, Sigebert's son, it again became Austrasian. This change was\r\nwelcome to Gregory, who often visited the court. In 586 he was at\r\nCoblenz, and on his return to Yvois (the modern Carignan) visited the\r\nstylite Wulfilaic; in 588 we hear of him at Metz and also at\r\nChalon-sur-Saone, whither he was sent to obtain from King Guntram the\r\nratification of the pact of Andelot; in 593 he was at Orleans, where\r\nChildebert had just succeeded his uncle Guntram. In the intervals of\r\nthese journeys he governed Tours with great firmness, repressing\r\ndisorders and reducing the monks and nuns to obedience. He died on the\r\n17th of November 594.\r\n\r\nGregory left many writings, of which he himself gives an enumeration at\r\nthe end of his _Historia Francorum_: \"Decem libros Historiarum, septem\r\nMiraculorum, unum de Vita Patrum scripsi; in Psalterii tractatu librum\r\nunum commentatus sum; de Cursibus etiam ecclesiasticis unum librum\r\ncondidi.\" The ten books of history are discussed below. The seven books\r\nof miracles are divided into the _De gloria martyrum_, the _De\r\nvirtutibus sancti Juliani_, four books of _Miracula sancti Martini_, and\r\nthe _De gloria confessorum_, the last dealing mainly with confessors who\r\nhad dwelt in the cities of Tours and Clermont. The _Vitae patrum_\r\nconsists of twenty biographies of bishops, abbots and hermits belonging\r\nto Gaul. The commentary on the Psalms is lost, the preface and the\r\ntitles of the chapters alone being extant. The treatise _De cursibus\r\necclesiasticis_, discovered in 1853, is a liturgical manual for\r\ndetermining the hour of divers nocturnal offices by the position of the\r\nstars. Gregory also left a life of St Andrew, translated from the Greek,\r\nand a history of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, translated from Syriac.\r\n\r\nHis most important work, however, is the _Historia Francorum_, which is\r\ndivided into three parts. The first four books, which were composed at\r\none time, cover the period from the creation of the world to the death\r\nof Sigebert in 575. The first book, which is a mere compilation from the\r\nchronicles of St Jerome and Orosius, is of no value. The second book,\r\nfrom 397 to 511, deals with the invasions of the Franks, and is based on\r\nthe histories of Sulpicius Alexander and Renatus Profuturus Frigeridus,\r\nnow lost; on the catalogues of the bishops of Clermont and Tours; on\r\nsome lives of saints, e.g. Remigius and Maxentius, now lost; on the\r\nannals of Arles and Angers, now lost; and on legends, either collected\r\nby Gregory himself from oral tradition, or cantilenes or epics written\r\nin the Latin and Germanic languages. In the third and fourth books the\r\nearlier part is based on materials collected from men older than\r\nhimself; of the later events he was himself an eye-witness. The fifth\r\nand sixth books, up to the death of Chilperic (584), deal with matters\r\nwithin his own experience. The first six books are often separate in the\r\nMSS., and it was these alone that were used by the chronicler\r\nFredegarius in his abridgment of Gregory's history. To the first six\r\nbooks Gregory subsequently added chapters on the bishops Salonius and\r\nSagittarius, and on his quarrels with Felix of Nantes. The authenticity\r\nof these chapters has been undeservedly attacked by Catholic writers.\r\nBooks vii. to x., from 584 to 591, were written in the form of a diary;\r\nof each important event, as it occurred, he inserted an account in his\r\nbook. The last six books are of great historical value.\r\n\r\nGregory had an intimate knowledge of contemporary events. He was\r\nfrequently at court, and he found Tours an excellent place for\r\ncollecting information. The shrine of St Martin attracted the sick from\r\nall quarters, and the basilica of the saint was a favourite sanctuary\r\nfor political refugees. Moreover, Tours was on the high road between the\r\nnorth and south of France, and was a convenient stage for travellers,\r\nthe ambassadors going to and from Spain frequently halting there.\r\nGregory plied every one with questions, and in this way gathered a great\r\nmass of detailed information. He was, besides, at great pains to be an\r\nimpartial writer, but was not always successful. His devotion to\r\nAustrasia made him very bitter against, and perhaps unjust to, the\r\nsovereigns of Neustria, Chilperic and Fredegond. As an orthodox\r\nChristian, he had no good word for the Arians. He excuses the crimes of\r\nkings who protected the church, such as Clovis, Clotaire I. and Guntram,\r\nbut had no mercy for those who violated ecclesiastical privileges. This\r\nattitude, no doubt, explains his hatred for Chilperic. But if Gregory's\r\nhistorical judgments are suspect, he at least concealed nothing and\r\ninvented nothing; and we can correct his judgments by his own narrative.\r\nHis history is a curious compound of artlessness and shrewdness. He was\r\nignorant of the rules of grammar, confused genders and cases, and wrote\r\nin the vernacular Latin of his time, apart from certain passages which\r\nare especially elaborated and filled with poetical and elegant\r\nexpressions. But in spite of his shortcomings he is an exceedingly\r\nattractive writer, and his mastery of the art of narrative has earned\r\nfor him the name of the Herodotus of the barbarians.\r\n\r\n  T. Ruinart brought out a complete edition of Gregory's works at Paris\r\n  in 1699. The best modern complete edition is that of W. Arndt and B.\r\n  Krusch in _Mon. Germ. hist. script. rer. Merov._ (vol. i., 1885). Of\r\n  the many editions of the _Historia Francorum_ may be mentioned those\r\n  of Guadet and Taranne in the _Soc. de l'hist. de France_ (4 vols.,\r\n  with French translation, 1836-1838), of Omont (the first six books; a\r\n  reproduction of the Corvey MS.) and of G. Collon (the last four books;\r\n  a reproduction of the Brussels MS. No. 9, 403). Gregory's hagiographic\r\n  works were published by H. Bordier in the _Soc. de l'hist. de France_\r\n  (4 vols., with French translation, 1857-1864). Cf. J. W. Lobell,\r\n  _Gregor von Tours und seine Zeit_ (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1868); G. Monod,\r\n  \"Etudes critiques sur les sources de l'histoire merovingienne\" in the\r\n  _Bibl. de l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes_ (1872); G. Kurth, \"Gregoire de\r\n  Tours et les etudes classiques au VI^e siecle\" in the _Revue des\r\n  questions historiques_ (xxiv. 586 seq., 1878); Max Bonnet, _Le Latin\r\n  de Gregoire de Tours_ (Paris, 1890). For details, see Ulysse\r\n  Chevalier, _Biobibliographie_ (2nd ed.).     (C. Pf.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREGORY THE ILLUMINATOR, the reputed founder of the Armenian Church. His\r\nlegend is briefly as follows. His father Anak, head of the Parthian clan\r\nof Suren, was bribed about the time of his birth (c. 257) by the\r\nSassanid king of Persia to assassinate the Armenian king, Chosroes, who\r\nwas of the old Arsacid dynasty, and father of Tiridates or Trdat, first\r\nChristian king of Armenia. Anak was slain by his victim's soldiers;\r\nGregory was rescued by his Christian nurse, carried to Caesarea in\r\nCappadocia, and brought up a Christian. Grown to manhood he took service\r\nunder Tiridates, now king of Armenia, in order by his own fidelity to\r\natone for his father's treachery. Presently at a feast of Anahite\r\nGregory refused to assist his sovereign in offering pagan sacrifice, and\r\nhis parentage being now revealed, was thrown into a deep pit at\r\nArtashat, where he languished for fourteen years, during which\r\npersecution raged in Armenia.\r\n\r\nThe scene of the legend now shifts to Rome, where Diocletian falls in\r\nlove with a lovely nun named Ripsime; she, rather than gratify his\r\npassion, flees with her abbess Gaiana and several priests to Armenia.\r\nDiocletian asks her back of Tiridates, who meanwhile has fallen in love\r\nwith her himself. He too is flouted, and in his rage tortures and slays\r\nher and her companions. The traditional date of this massacre is the 5th\r\nof October, A.D. 301. Providence, incensed at such cruelty, turns\r\nTiridates into a wild boar, and afflicts his subjects with madness; but\r\nhis sister, Chosrowidukht, has a revelation to bring Gregory back out of\r\nhis pit. The king consents, the saint is acclaimed, the bodies of the\r\nthirty-seven martyrs solemnly interred, and the king, after fasting\r\nfive, and listening to Gregory's homilies for sixty days, is healed.\r\nThis all took place at Valarshapat, where Gregory, anxious to fix a site\r\non which to build shrines for the relics of Ripsime and Gaiana, saw the\r\nSon of God come down in a sheen of light, the stars of heaven attending,\r\nand smite the earth with a golden hammer till the nether world resounded\r\nto his blows. Three chapels were built on the spot, and Gregory raised\r\nhis cross there and elsewhere for the people to worship, just as St Nino\r\nwas doing about the same time in Georgia. There followed a campaign\r\nagainst the idols whose temples and books were destroyed. The time had\r\nnow come for Gregory, who was still a layman and father of two sons, to\r\nreceive ordination; so he went to Caesarea, where Leontius ordained and\r\nconsecrated him catholicos or vicar-general of Armenia. This was\r\nsometime about 290, when Leontius may have acceded, though we first hear\r\nof him as bishop in 314.\r\n\r\nGregory's ordination at Caesarea is historical. The vision at\r\nValarshapat was invented later by the Armenians when they broke with the\r\nGreeks, in order to give to their church the semblance, if not of\r\napostolic, at least of divine origin.\r\n\r\nAccording to Agathangelus, Tiridates went to Rome with Gregory,\r\nAristaces, son of Gregory, and Albianos, head of the other priestly\r\nfamily, to make a pact with Constantine, newly converted to the faith,\r\nand receive a pallium from Silvester. The better sources make Sardica\r\nthe scene of meeting and name Eusebius (of Nicomedia) as the prelate who\r\nattended Constantine. There is no reason to doubt that some such visit\r\nwas made about the year 315, when the death of Maximin Daza left\r\nConstantine supreme. Eusebius testifies (_H.E._ ix. 8) that the\r\nArmenians were ardent Christians, and ancient friends and allies of the\r\nRoman empire when Maximin attacked them about the year 308. The\r\nconversion of Tiridates was probably a matter of policy. His kingdom was\r\nhoneycombed with Christianity, and he wished to draw closer to the West,\r\nwhere he foresaw the victory of the new faith, in order to fortify his\r\nrealm against the Sassanids of Persia. Following the same policy he sent\r\nAristaces in 325 to the council of Nice. Gregory is related to have\r\nadded a clause to the creed which Aristaces brought back; he became a\r\nhermit on Mount Sebuh about the year 332, and died there.\r\n\r\nIs the Ripsime episode mere legend? The story of the conversion of\r\nGeorgia by St Nino in the same age is so full of local colour, and\r\ncoheres so closely with the story of Ripsime and Gaiana, that it seems\r\nover-sceptical to explain the latter away as a mere doublet of the\r\nlegend of Prisca and Valeria. The historians Faustus of Byzant and Lazar\r\nof Pharp in the 5th century already attest the reverence with which\r\ntheir memory was invested. We know from many sources the prominence\r\nassigned to women prophets in the Phrygian church. Nino's story reads\r\nlike that of such a female missionary, and something similar must\r\nunderlie the story of her Armenian companions.\r\n\r\nThe history of Gregory by Agathangelus is a compilation of about 450,\r\nwhich was rendered into Greek 550. Professor Marr has lately published\r\nan Arabic text from a MS. in Sinai which seems to contain an older\r\ntradition. A letter of Bishop George of Arabia to Jeshu, a priest of the\r\ntown Anab, dated 714 (edited by Dashian, Vienna, 1891), contains an\r\nindependent tradition of Gregory, and styles him a Roman by birth.\r\n\r\nIn spite of legendary accretions we can still discern the true outlines\r\nand significance of his life. He did not really illumine or convert\r\ngreat Armenia, for the people were in the main already converted by\r\nSyrian missionaries to the Adoptionist or Ebionite type of faith which\r\nwas dominant in the far East, and was afterwards known as Nestorianism.\r\nMarcionites and Montanists had also worked in the field. Gregory\r\npersuaded Tiridates to destroy the last relics of the old paganism, and\r\ncarried out in the religious sphere his sovereign's policy of detaching\r\nGreat Armenia from the Sassanid realm and allying it with the\r\nGraeco-Roman empire and civilization. He set himself to Hellenize or\r\nCatholicize Armenian Christianity, and in furtherance of this aim set up\r\na hierarchy officially dependent on the Cappadocian. He in effect turned\r\nhis country into a province of the Greek see of Cappadocia. This\r\nhierarchical tie was soon snapped, but the Hellenizing influence\r\ncontinued to work, and bore its most abundant fruit in the 5th century.\r\nHis career was thus analogous to that of St Patrick in Ireland.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--S.

C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREGORY (_Gregorius_), the name of sixteen popes and one anti-pope.\r\n\r\nSAINT GREGORY, surnamed the Great (_c._ 540-604), the first pope of that\r\nname, and the last of the four doctors of the Latin Church, was born in\r\nRome about the year 540. His father was Gordianus \"the regionary,\" a\r\nwealthy man of senatorial rank, owner of large estates in Sicily and of\r\na palace on the Caelian Hill in Rome; his mother was Silvia, who is\r\ncommemorated as a saint on the 3rd of November. Of Gregory's early\r\nperiod we know few details, and almost all the dates are conjectural. He\r\nreceived the best education to be had at the time, and was noted for his\r\nproficiency in the arts of grammar, rhetoric and dialectic. Entering on\r\na public career he held, about 573, the high office of prefect of the\r\ncity of Rome; but about 574, feeling irresistibly attracted to the\r\n\"religious\" life, he resigned his post, founded six monasteries in\r\nSicily and one in Rome, and in the last--the famous monastery of St\r\nAndrew--became himself a monk. This grateful seclusion, however, he was\r\nnot permitted long to enjoy. About 578 he was ordained \"seventh deacon\"\r\n(or possibly archdeacon) of the Roman Church, and in the following\r\nspring Pope Pelagius II. appointed him \"apocrisiarius,\" or resident\r\nambassador, at the imperial court in Constantinople. Here he represented\r\nthe interests of his church till about 586, when he returned to Rome and\r\nwas made abbot of St Andrew's monastery. His rule, though popular, was\r\ncharacterized by great severity, as may be inferred from the story of\r\nthe monk Justus, who was denied Christian burial because he had secreted\r\na small sum of money. About this time Gregory completed and published\r\nhis well-known exposition of the book of Job, commenced in\r\nConstantinople: he also delivered lectures on the Heptateuch, the books\r\nof Kings, the Prophets, the book of Proverbs and the Song of Songs. To\r\nthis period, moreover, Bede's incident of the English slave-boys (if\r\nindeed it be accepted as historical) ought to be assigned. Passing one\r\nday through the Forum, Gregory saw some handsome slaves offered for\r\nsale, and inquired their nation. \"Angles,\" was the reply. \"Good,\" said\r\nthe abbot, \"they have the faces of angels, and should be coheirs with\r\nthe angels in heaven. From what province do they come?\" \"From Deira.\"\r\n\"Deira. Yea, verily, they shall be saved from God's ire (_de ira_) and\r\ncalled to the mercy of Christ. How is the king of that country named?\"\r\n\"Aella.\" \"Then must Allelulia be sung in Aella's land.\" Gregory\r\ndetermined personally to undertake the conversion of Britain, and with\r\nthe pope's consent actually set out upon the mission, but on the third\r\nday of his journey he was overtaken by messengers recalling him to Rome.\r\nIn the year 590 Pelagius II. died of the plague that was raging in the\r\ncity; whereupon the clergy and people unanimously chose Gregory as his\r\nsuccessor. The abbot did his best to avoid the dignity, petitioned the\r\nemperor Maurice not to ratify his election, and even meditated going\r\ninto hiding; but, \"while he was preparing for flight and concealment, he\r\nwas seized and carried off and dragged to the basilica of St Peter,\" and\r\nthere consecrated bishop, on the 3rd of September 590.\r\n\r\nThe fourteen years of Gregory's pontificate were marked by extraordinary\r\nvigour and activity. \"He never rested,\" writes a biographer, \"he was\r\nalways engaged in providing for the interests of his people, or in\r\nwriting some composition worthy of the church, or in searching out the\r\nsecrets of heaven by the grace of contemplation.\" His mode of life was\r\nsimple and ascetic in the extreme. Having banished all lay attendants\r\nfrom his palace, he surrounded himself with clerics and monks, with whom\r\nhe lived as though he were still in a monastery. To the spiritual needs\r\nof his people he ministered with pastoral zeal, frequently appointing\r\n\"stations\" and delivering sermons; nor was he less solicitous in\r\nproviding for their physical necessities. Deaconries (offices of alms)\r\nand guest-houses were liberally endowed, and free distributions of food\r\nwere made to the poor in the convents and basilicas. The funds for these\r\nand similar purposes were supplied from the Patrimony of St Peter--the\r\npapal estates in Italy, the adjacent islands, Gaul, Dalmatia and Africa.\r\nThese extensive domains were usually administered by specially appointed\r\nagents,--rectors and defensors,--who resided on the spot; but the\r\ngeneral superintendence devolved upon the pope. In this sphere Gregory\r\nmanifested rare capacity. He was one of the best of the papal landlords.\r\nDuring his pontificate the estates increased in value, while at the same\r\ntime the real grievances of the tenants were redressed and their general\r\nposition was materially improved. Gregory's principal fault as a man of\r\nbusiness was that he was inclined to be too lavish of his revenues. It\r\nis said that he even impoverished the treasury of the Roman Church by\r\nhis unlimited charities.\r\n\r\nWithin the strict bounds of his patriarchate, i.e. the churches of the\r\nsuburbicarian provinces and the islands, it was Gregory's policy to\r\nwatch with particular care over the election and discipline of the\r\nbishops. With wise toleration he was willing to recognize local\r\ndeviations from Roman usage (e.g. in the ritual of baptism and\r\nconfirmation), yet he was resolute to withstand any unauthorized\r\nusurpation of rights and privileges. The following rules he took pains\r\nto enforce: that clerics in holy orders should not cohabit with their\r\nwives or permit any women, except those allowed by the canons, to live\r\nin their houses; that clerics accused on ecclesiastical or lesser\r\ncriminal charges should be tried only in the ecclesiastical courts; that\r\nclerics in holy orders who had lapsed should \"utterly forfeit their\r\norders and never again approach the ministry of the altar\"; that the\r\nrevenues of each church should be divided by its bishop into four equal\r\nparts, to be assigned to the bishop, the clergy, the poor and the repair\r\nof the fabric of the church.\r\n\r\nIn his relations with the churches which lay outside the strict limits\r\nof his patriarchate, in northern Italy, Spain, Gaul, Africa and\r\nIllyricum and also in the East, Gregory consistently used his influence\r\nto increase the prestige and authority of the Roman See. In his view\r\nRome, as the see of the Prince of the Apostles, was by divine right \"the\r\nhead of all the churches.\" The decrees of councils would have no binding\r\nforce \"without the authority and consent of the apostolic see\": appeals\r\nmight be made to Rome against the decisions even of the patriarch of\r\nConstantinople: all bishops, including the patriarchs, if guilty of\r\nheresy or uncanonical proceedings, were subject to correction by the\r\npope. \"If any fault is discovered in a bishop,\" Gregory wrote, \"I know\r\nof no one who is not subject to the apostolic see.\" It is true that\r\nGregory respected the rights of metropolitans and disapproved of\r\nunnecessary interference within the sphere of their jurisdiction\r\ncanonically exercised; also that in his relations with certain churches\r\n(e.g. those in Africa) he found it expedient to abstain from any\r\nobtrusive assertion of Roman claims. But of his general principle there\r\ncan be no doubt. His sincere belief in the apostolic authority of the\r\nsee of St Peter, his outspoken assertion of it, the consistency and\r\nfirmness with which in practice he maintained it (e.g. in his\r\ncontroversies with the bishops of Ravenna concerning the use of the\r\npallium, with Maximus the \"usurping\" bishop of Salona, and with the\r\npatriarchs of Constantinople in respect of the title \"ecumenical\r\nbishops\"), contributed greatly to build up the system of papal\r\nabsolutism. Moreover this consolidation of spiritual authority coincided\r\nwith a remarkable development of the temporal power of the papacy. In\r\nItaly Gregory occupied an almost regal position. Taking advantage of the\r\nopportunity which circumstances offered, he boldly stepped into the\r\nplace which the emperors had left vacant and the Lombard kings had not\r\nthe strength to seize. For the first time in history the pope appeared\r\nas a political power, a temporal prince. He appointed governors to\r\ncities, issued orders to generals, provided munitions of war, sent his\r\nambassadors to negotiate with the Lombard king and actually dared to\r\nconclude a private peace. In this direction Gregory went farther than\r\nany of his predecessors: he laid the foundation of a political influence\r\nwhich endured for centuries. \"Of the medieval papacy,\" says Milman, \"the\r\nreal father is Gregory the Great.\"\r\n\r\nThe first monk to become pope, Gregory was naturally a strong supporter\r\nof monasticism. He laid himself out to diffuse the system, and also to\r\ncarry out a reform of its abuses by enforcing a strict observance of the\r\nRule of St Benedict (of whom, it may be noted, he was the earliest\r\nbiographer). Two slight innovations were introduced: the minimum age of\r\nan abbess was fixed at sixty, and the period of novitiate was prolonged\r\nfrom one year to two. Gregory sought to protect the monks from episcopal\r\noppression by issuing _privilegia_, or charters in restraint of abuses,\r\nin accordance with which the jurisdiction of the bishops over the\r\nmonasteries was confined to spiritual matters, all illegal aggressions\r\nbeing strictly prohibited. The documents are interesting as marking the\r\nbeginning of a revolution which eventually emancipated the monks\r\naltogether from the control of their diocesans and brought them under\r\nthe direct authority of the Holy See. Moreover Gregory strictly forbade\r\nmonks to minister in parish churches, ordaining that any monk who was\r\npromoted to such ecclesiastical cure should lose all rights in his\r\nmonastery and should no longer reside there. \"The duties of each office\r\nseparately are so weighty that no one can rightly discharge them. It is\r\ntherefore very improper that one man should be considered fit to\r\ndischarge the duties of both, and that by this means the ecclesiastical\r\norder should interfere with the monastic life, and the rule of the\r\nmonastic life in turn interfere with the interests of the churches.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more, Gregory is remembered as a great organizer of missionary\r\nenterprise for the conversion of heathens and heretics. Most important\r\nwas the two-fold mission to Britain--of St Augustine in 596, of\r\nMellitus, Paulinus and others in 601; but Gregory also made strenuous\r\nefforts to uproot paganism in Gaul, Italy, Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica,\r\nArianism in Spain, Donatism in Africa, Manichaeism in Sicily, the heresy\r\nof the Three Chapters in Istria and northern Italy. In respect of the\r\nmethods of conversion which he advocated he was not less intolerant than\r\nhis contemporaries. Towards the Jews, however, he acted with exceptional\r\nlenity, protecting them from persecution and securing them the enjoyment\r\nof their legal privileges. The so-called \"simoniacal heresy,\"\r\nparticularly prevalent in Gaul, Illyricum and the East, be repeatedly\r\nattacked; and against the Gallican abuse of promoting laymen to\r\nbishoprics he protested with vigour.\r\n\r\nThe extent and character of Gregory's works in connexion with the\r\nliturgy and the music of the church is a subject of dispute. If we are\r\nto credit a 9th century biographer, Gregory abbreviated and otherwise\r\nsimplified the Sacramentary of Gelasius, producing a revised edition\r\nwith which his own name has become associated, and which represents the\r\ngroundwork of the modern Roman Missal. But though it is certain that he\r\nintroduced three changes in the liturgy itself (viz. the addition of\r\nsome words in the prayer _Hanc igitur_, the recitation of the Pater\r\nNoster at the end of the Canon immediately before the fraction of the\r\nbread, and the chanting of the Allelulia after the Gradual at other\r\ntimes besides the season of Easter) and two others in the ceremonial\r\nconnected therewith (forbidding deacons to perform any musical portion\r\nof the service except the chanting of the gospel, and subdeacons to wear\r\nchasubles), neither the external nor the internal evidence appears to\r\nwarrant belief that the Gregorian Sacramentary is his work.\r\nEcclesiastical tradition further ascribes to Gregory the compilation of\r\nan Antiphonary, the revision and rearrangement of the system of church\r\nmusic, and the foundation of the Roman _schola cantorum_. It is highly\r\ndoubtful, however, whether he had anything to do either with the\r\nAntiphonary or with the invention or revival of the _cantus planus_; it\r\nis certain that he was not the founder of the Roman singing-school,\r\nthough he may have interested himself in its endowment and extension.\r\n\r\nFinally, as Fourth Doctor of the Latin Church, Gregory claims the\r\nattention of theologians. He is the link between two epochs. The last of\r\nthe great Latin Fathers and the first representative of medieval\r\nCatholicism he brings the dogmatic theology of Tertullian, Ambrose and\r\nAugustine into relation with the Scholastic speculation of later ages.\r\n\"He connects the Graeco-Roman with the Romano-Germanic type of\r\nChristianity.\" His teaching, indeed, is neither philosophical,\r\nsystematic nor truly original. Its importance lies mainly in its simple,\r\npopular summarization of the doctrine of Augustine (whose works Gregory\r\nhad studied with infinite care, but not always with insight), and in its\r\ndetailed exposition of various religious conceptions which were current\r\nin the Western Church, but had not hitherto been defined with precision\r\n(e.g. the views on angelology and demonology, on purgatory, the\r\nEucharistic Sacrifice, and the efficacy of relics). In his exposition of\r\nsuch ideas Gregory made a distinct advance upon the older theology and\r\ninfluenced profoundly the dogmatic development of the future. He\r\nimparted a life and impulse to prevailing tendencies, helping on the\r\nconstruction of the system hereafter to be completed in Scholasticism.\r\nHe gave to theology a tone and emphasis which could not be disregarded.\r\nFrom his time to that of Anselm no teacher of equal eminence arose in\r\nthe Church.\r\n\r\nGregory died on the 12th of March 604, and was buried the same day in\r\nthe portico of the basilica of St Peter, in front of the sacristy.\r\nTranslations took place in the 9th, 15th and 17th centuries, and the\r\nremains now rest beneath the altar in the chapel of Clement VIII. In\r\nrespect of his character, while most historians agree that he was a\r\nreally great man, some deny that he was also a great saint. The worst\r\nblot on his fair fame is his adulatory congratulation of the murderous\r\nusurper Phocas; though his correspondence with the Frankish queen\r\nBrunhilda, and the series of letters to and concerning the renegade monk\r\nVenantius also present problems which his admirers find difficult of\r\nsolution. But while it may be admitted that Gregory was inclined to be\r\nunduly subservient to the great, so that at times he was willing to shut\r\nhis eyes to the vices and even the crimes of persons of rank; yet it\r\ncannot fairly be denied that his character as a whole was singularly\r\nnoble and unselfish. His life was entirely dominated by the religious\r\nmotive. His sole desire was to promote the glory of God and of his\r\nchurch. At all times he strove honestly to live up to the light that was\r\nin him. \"His goal,\" says Lau, \"was always that which he acknowledged as\r\nthe best.\" Physically, Gregory was of medium height and good figure. His\r\nhead was large and bald, surrounded with a fringe of dark hair. His face\r\nwas well-proportioned, with brown eyes, aquiline nose, thick and red\r\nlips, high-coloured cheeks, and prominent chin sparsely covered with a\r\ntawny beard. His hands, with tapering fingers, were remarkable for their\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n  _Gregory's Works._--The following are now universally admitted to be\r\n  genuine:--_Epistolarum libri xiv._, _Moralium libri xxxv._, _Regulae\r\n  pastoralis liber_, _Dialogorum libri iv._, _Homiliarum in Ezechielem\r\n  prophetam libri ii._, _Homiliarum in Evangelia libri ii._ These are\r\n  all printed in Migne's _Patrologia Latina_. The _Epistolae_, however,\r\n  have been published separately by P. Ewald and L. M. Hartmann in the\r\n  _Monumenta Germaniae historica_ (Berlin, 1887-1899), and this splendid\r\n  edition has superseded all others. The question of the chronological\r\n  reconstruction of the _Register_ is dealt with by Ewald in his\r\n  celebrated article in the _Neues Archiv der Gesellschaft fur altere\r\n  deutsche Geschichtskunde_, iii. pp. 433-625; and briefly by T.\r\n  Hodgkin, _Italy and her Invaders_, v. 333-343. For information about\r\n  these writings of Gregory, consult especially G. J. T. Lau, _Gregor I.\r\n  der Grosse_, pt. ii. chap. i. _Die Schriften Gregors_ and F. Homes\r\n  Dudden, _Gregory the Great_ (see Index II. B.). In addition to the\r\n  above-mentioned works there are printed under Gregory's name in\r\n  Migne's _Patrologia Latina_, vol. lxxix., the following:--_Super\r\n  Cantico Canticorum expositio_, _In librum primum Regum variarum\r\n  expositionum libri vi._, _In septem psalmos poenitentiales expositio_\r\n  and _Concordia quorundam teslimoniorum s. scripturae_. But (with the\r\n  possible exception of the first) none of these treatises are of\r\n  Gregorian authorship.

(F. H. D.)\r\n\r\nGREGORY II., pope from 715 to 731, succeeded Constantine I., whom he\r\naccompanied from Constantinople in 710. Gregory did all in his power to\r\npromote the spread of Christianity in Germany, and gave special\r\nencouragement to the mission of St Boniface, whom he consecrated bishop\r\nin 722. He was a staunch adherent of the East Roman empire, which still\r\nexercised sovereignty over Rome, Ravenna and some other parts of Italy,\r\nand he impeded as far as possible the progress of the Lombards. About\r\n726, however, he became involved in a conflict with the emperor Leo the\r\nIsaurian on account of the excessive taxation of the Italians, and,\r\nlater, on the question of image worship, which had been proscribed by\r\nthe government of Constantinople. Leo endeavoured to rid himself of the\r\npope by violence, but Gregory, supported by the people of Rome and also\r\nby the Lombards, succeeded in eluding the emperor's attacks, and died\r\npeacefully on the 11th of February 731.\r\n\r\nGREGORY III., pope from 731 to 741. He condemned the iconoclasts at a\r\ncouncil convened at Rome in November 731, and, like his predecessor\r\nGregory II., stimulated the missionary labours of St Boniface, on whom\r\nhe conferred the pallium. Towards the Lombards he took up an imprudent\r\nattitude, in support of which he in vain invoked the aid of the Frankish\r\nprince Charles Martel.\r\n\r\nGREGORY IV., pope from 827 to 844, was chosen to succeed Valentinus in\r\nDecember 827, on which occasion he recognized the supremacy of the\r\nFrankish emperor in the most unequivocal manner. His name is chiefly\r\nassociated with the quarrels between Lothair and Louis the Pious, in\r\nwhich he espoused the cause of the former, for whom, in the Campus\r\nMendacii (_Lugenfeld_, field of lies), as it is usually called (833), he\r\nsecured by his treachery a temporary advantage. The institution of the\r\nfeast of All Saints is usually attributed to this pope. He died on the\r\n25th of January 844, and was succeeded by Sergius II.\r\n\r\nGREGORY V. (Bruno), pope from 996 to 999, a great-grandson of the\r\nemperor Otto the Great, succeeded John XV. when only twenty-four years\r\nof age, and until the council of Pavia (997) had a rival in the person\r\nof the anti-pope John XVI., whom the people of Rome, in revolt against\r\nthe will of the youthful emperor Otto III., had chosen after having\r\nexpelled Gregory. The most memorable acts of his pontificate were those\r\narising out of the contumacy of the French king, Robert, who was\r\nultimately brought to submission by the rigorous infliction of a\r\nsentence of excommunication. Gregory died suddenly, and not without\r\nsuspicion of foul play, on the 18th of February 999. His successor was\r\nSilvester II.\r\n\r\nGREGORY VI., pope from 1045 to 1046. As Johannes Gratianus he had earned\r\na high reputation for learning and probity, and in 1045 he bought the\r\nRoman pontificate from his godson Benedict IX. At a council held by the\r\nemperor Henry III. at Sutri in 1046, he was accused of simony and\r\ndeposed. He was banished into Germany, where he died in 1047. He was\r\naccompanied into exile by his young protege Hildebrand (afterwards pope\r\nas Gregory VII.), and was succeeded by Clement II. (L. D.*)\r\n\r\nGREGORY VII., pope from 1073 to 1085. Hildebrand (the future pope) would\r\nseem to have been born in Tuscany--perhaps Raovacum--early in the third\r\ndecade of the 11th century. The son of a plain citizen, Bunicus or\r\nBonizo, he came to Rome at an early age for his education; an uncle of\r\nhis being abbot of the convent of St Mary on the Aventine. His\r\ninstructors appear to have included the archpriest Johannes Gratianus,\r\nwho, by disbursing a considerable sum to Benedict IX., smoothed his way\r\nto the papal throne and actually ascended it as Gregory VI. But when the\r\nemperor Henry III., on his expedition to Rome (1046), terminated the\r\nscandalous _impasse_ in which three popes laid claim to the chair of\r\nPeter by deposing all three, Gregory VI. was banished to Germany, and\r\nHildebrand found himself obliged to accompany him. As he himself\r\nafterwards admitted, it was with extreme reluctance that he crossed the\r\nAlps. But his residence in Germany was of great educative value, and\r\nfull of significance for his later official activity. In Cologne he was\r\nenabled to pursue his studies; he came into touch with the circles of\r\nLorraine where interest in the elevation of the Church and her life was\r\nhighest, and gained acquaintance with the political and ecclesiastical\r\ncircumstances of that country which was destined to figure so largely in\r\nhis career. Whether, on the death of Gregory VI. in the beginning of\r\n1048, Hildebrand proceeded to Cluny is doubtful. His brief residence\r\nthere, if it actually occurred, is to be regarded as no more than a\r\nvisit; for he was never a monk of Cluny. His contemporaries indeed\r\ndescribe him as a monk; but his entry into the convent must be assigned\r\nto the period preceding or following his German travels and presumably\r\ntook place in Rome. He returned to that city with Bishop Bruno of Toul,\r\nwho was nominated pope under the title of Leo IX. (1048-1054). Under him\r\nHildebrand found his first employment in the ecclesiastical service,\r\nbecoming a sub-deacon and steward in the Roman Church. He acted,\r\nmoreover, as a legate in France, where he was occupied _inter alia_ with\r\nthe question of Berengarius of Tours, whose views on the Lord's Supper\r\nhad excited opposition. On the death of Leo IX. he was commissioned by\r\nthe Romans as their envoy to the German court, to conduct the\r\nnegotiations with regard to his successor. The emperor pronounced in\r\nfavour of Bishop Gebhard of Eichstadt, who, in the course of his short\r\nreign as Victor II. (1055-1057), again employed Hildebrand as his legate\r\nto France. When Stephen IX. (Frederick of Lorraine) was raised to the\r\npapacy, without previous consultation with the German court, Hildebrand\r\nand Bishop Anselm of Lucca were despatched to Germany to secure a\r\nbelated recognition, and he succeeded in gaining the consent of the\r\nempress Agnes. Stephen, however, died before his return, and, by the\r\nhasty elevation of Bishop Johannes of Velletri, the Roman aristocracy\r\nmade a last attempt to recover their lost influence on the appointment\r\nto the papal throne--a proceeding which was charged with peril to the\r\nChurch as it implied a renewal of the disastrous patrician regime. That\r\nthe crisis was surmounted was essentially the work of Hildebrand. To\r\nBenedict X., the aristocratic nominee, he opposed a rival pope in the\r\nperson of Bishop Gerhard of Florence, with whom the victory rested. The\r\nreign of Nicholas II. (1059-1061) was distinguished by events which\r\nexercised a potent influence on the policy of the Curia during the next\r\ntwo decades--the _rapprochement_ with the Normans in the south of Italy,\r\nand the alliance with the democratic and, subsequently, anti-German\r\nmovement of the Patarenes in the north. It was also under his\r\npontificate (1059) that the law was enacted which transferred the papal\r\nelection to the College of Cardinals, thus withdrawing it from the\r\nnobility and populace of Rome and thrusting the German influence on one\r\nside. It would be too much to maintain that these measures were due to\r\nHildebrand alone, but it is obvious that he was already a dominant\r\npersonality on the Curia, through he still held no more exalted office\r\nthan that of archdeacon, which was indeed only conferred on him in 1059.\r\nAgain, when Nicholas II. died and a new schism broke out, the\r\ndiscomfiture of Honorius II. (Bishop Cadalus of Parma) and the success\r\nof his rival (Anselm of Lucca) must be ascribed principally, if not\r\nentirely, to Hildebrand's opposition to the former. Under the sway of\r\nAlexander II. (1061-1073) this man loomed larger and larger in the eye\r\nof his contemporaries as the soul of the Curial policy. It must be\r\nconfessed the general political conditions, especially in Germany, were\r\nat that period exceptionally favourable to the Curia, but to utilize\r\nthem with the sagacity actually shown was nevertheless no slight\r\nachievement, and the position of Alexander at the end of his pontificate\r\nwas a brilliant justification of the Hildebrandine statecraft.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Alexander II. (April 21, 1073), Hildebrand became pope\r\nand took the style of Gregory VII. The mode of his election was bitterly\r\nassailed by his opponents. True, many of the charges preferred are\r\nobviously the emanations of scandal and personal dislike, liable to\r\nsuspicion from the very fact that they were not raised to impugn his\r\npromotion till several years had elapsed (_c._ 1076); still it is plain\r\nfrom his own account of the circumstances of his elevation that it was\r\nconducted in extremely irregular fashion, and that the forms prescribed\r\nby the law of 1059 were not observed. But the sequel justified his\r\nelection--of which the worst that can be said is that there was no\r\ngeneral suffrage. And this sequel again owed none of its success to\r\nchance, but was the fruit of his own exertions. In his character were\r\nunited wide experience and great energy tested in difficult situations.\r\nIt is proof of the popular faith in his qualifications that, although\r\nthe circumstances of his election invited assault in 1073, no sort of\r\nattempt was then made to set up a rival pontiff. When, however, the\r\nopposition which took head against him had gone so far as to produce a\r\npretender to the chair, his long and undisputed possession tended to\r\nprove the original legality of his papacy; and the appeal to\r\nirregularities at its beginning not only lost all cogency but assumed\r\nthe appearance of a mere biased attack. On the 22nd of May he received\r\nsacerdotal ordination, and on the 30th of June episcopal consecration;\r\nthe empress Agnes and the duchess Beatrice of Tuscany being present at\r\nthe ceremony, in addition to Bishop Gregory of Vercelli, the chancellor\r\nof the German king, to whom Gregory would thus seem to have communicated\r\nthe result of the election.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the ecclesiastico-political projects of Gregory VII. is to\r\nbe found in his relationship with Germany. Since the death of Henry III.\r\nthe strength of the monarchy in that country had been seriously\r\nimpaired, and his son Henry IV. had to contend with great internal\r\ndifficulties. This state of affairs was of material assistance to the\r\npope. His advantage was still further accentuated by the fact that in\r\n1073 Henry was but twenty-three years of age and by temperament inclined\r\nto precipitate action. Many sharp lessons were needful before he learned\r\nto bridle his impetuosity, and he lacked the support and advice of a\r\ndisinterested and experienced statesman. Such being the conditions, a\r\nconflict between Gregory VII. and Henry IV. could have only one\r\nissue--the victory of the former.\r\n\r\nIn the two following years Henry was compelled by the Saxon rebellion to\r\ncome to amicable terms with the pope at any cost. Consequently in May\r\n1074 he did penance at Nuremberg in presence of the legates to expiate\r\nhis continued intimacy with the members of his council banned by\r\nGregory, took an oath of obedience, and promised his support in the work\r\nof reforming the Church. This attitude, however, which at first won him\r\nthe confidence of the pope, he abandoned so soon as he gained the upper\r\nhand of the Saxons: this he achieved by his victory at Hohenburg on the\r\nUnstrut (June 9, 1075). He now attempted to reassert his rights of\r\nsuzerain in upper Italy without delay. He sent Count Eberhard to\r\nLombardy to combat the Patarenes; nominated the cleric Tedaldo to the\r\narchbishopric of Milan, thus settling a prolonged and contentious\r\nquestion; and finally endeavoured to establish relations with the Norman\r\nduke, Robert Guiscard. Gregory VII. answered with a rough letter, dated\r\nDecember 8, in which--among other charges--he reproached the German king\r\nwith breach of his word and with his further countenance of the\r\nexcommunicated councillors; while at the same time he sent by word of\r\nmouth a brusque message intimating that the enormous crimes which would\r\nbe laid to his account rendered him liable, not only to the ban of the\r\nchurch, but to the deprivation of his crown. Gregory ventured on these\r\naudacious measures at a time when he himself was confronted by a\r\nreckless opponent in the person of Cencius, who on Christmas-night did\r\nnot scruple to surprise him in church and carry him off as a prisoner,\r\nthough on the following day he was obliged to surrender his captive. The\r\nreprimands of the pope, couched as they were in such an unprecedented\r\nform, infuriated Henry and his court, and their answer was the hastily\r\nconvened national council in Worms, which met on the 24th of January\r\n1076. In the higher ranks of the German clergy Gregory had many enemies,\r\nand a Roman cardinal, Hugo Candidus, once on intimate terms with him but\r\nnow at variance, had made a hurried expedition to Germany for the\r\noccasion and appeared at Worms with the rest. All the gross scandals\r\nwith regard to the pontiff that this prelate could utter were greedily\r\nreceived by the assembly, which committed itself to the ill-considered\r\nand disastrous resolution that Gregory had forfeited his papal dignity.\r\nIn a document full of accusations the bishops renounced their\r\nallegiance. In another King Henry pronounced him deposed, and the Romans\r\nwere required to choose a new occupant for the vacant chair of St Peter.\r\nWith the utmost haste two bishops were despatched to Italy in company\r\nwith Count Eberhard under commission of the council, and they succeeded\r\nin procuring a similar act of deposition from the Lombard bishops in the\r\nsynod of Piacenza. The communication of these decisions to the pope was\r\nundertaken by the priest Roland of Parma, and he was fortunate enough to\r\ngain an opportunity for speech in the synod, which had barely assembled\r\nin the Lateran church, and there to deliver his message announcing the\r\ndethronement of the pontiff. For the moment the members were petrified\r\nwith horror, but soon such a storm of indignation was aroused that it\r\nwas only due to the moderation of Gregory himself that the envoy was not\r\ncut down on the spot. On the following day the pope pronounced the\r\nsentence of excommunication against the German king with all formal\r\nsolemnity, divested him of his royal dignity and absolved his subjects\r\nfrom the oaths they had sworn to him. This sentence purported to eject\r\nthe king from the church and to strip him of his crown. Whether it would\r\nproduce this effect, or whether it would remain an idle threat, depended\r\nnot on the author of the verdict, but on the subjects of Henry--before\r\nall, on the German princes. We know from contemporary evidence that the\r\nexcommunication of the king made a profound impression both in Germany\r\nand Italy. Thirty years before, Henry III. had deposed three popes, and\r\nthereby rendered a great and acknowledged service to the church. When\r\nHenry IV. attempted to copy this summary procedure he came to grief, for\r\nhe lacked the support of the people. In Germany there was a speedy and\r\ngeneral revulsion of sentiment in favour of Gregory, and the\r\nparticularism of the princes utilized the auspicious moment for\r\nprosecuting their anti-regal policy under the cloak of respect for the\r\npapal decision. When at Whitsuntide the king proposed to discuss the\r\nmeasures to be taken against Gregory in a council of his nobles at\r\nMainz, only a few made their appearance; the Saxons snatched at the\r\ngolden opportunity for renewing their insurrection and the anti-royalist\r\nparty grew in strength from month to month. The situation now became\r\nextremely critical for Henry. As a result of the agitation, which was\r\nzealously fostered by the papal legate Bishop Altmann of Passau, the\r\nprinces met in October at Tribur to elect a new German king, and Henry,\r\nwho was stationed at Oppenheim on the left bank of the Rhine, was only\r\nsaved from the loss of his sceptre by the failure of the assembled\r\nprinces to agree on the question of his successor. Their dissension,\r\nhowever, merely induced them to postpone the verdict. Henry, they\r\ndeclared, must make reparation to the pope and pledge himself to\r\nobedience; and they settled that, if, on the anniversary of his\r\nexcommunication, he still lay under the ban, the throne should be\r\nconsidered vacant. At the same time they determined to invite Gregory to\r\nAugsburg, there to decide the conflict. These arrangements showed Henry\r\nthe course to be pursued. It was imperative, under any circumstances and\r\nat any price, to secure his absolution from Gregory before the period\r\nnamed, otherwise he could scarcely foil his opponents in their intention\r\nto pursue their attack against himself and justify their measures by an\r\nappeal to his excommunication. At first he attempted to attain his ends\r\nby an embassy, but when Gregory rejected his overtures he took the\r\ncelebrated step of going to Italy in person. The pope had already left\r\nRome, and had intimated to the German princes that he would expect their\r\nescort for his journey on January 8 in Mantua. But this escort had not\r\nappeared when he received the news of the king's arrival. Henry, who\r\ntravelled through Burgundy, had been greeted with wild enthusiasm by the\r\nLombards, but resisted the temptation to employ force against Gregory.\r\nHe chose instead the unexpected and unusual, but, as events proved, the\r\nsafest course, and determined to compel the pope to grant him absolution\r\nby doing penance before him at Canossa, where he had taken refuge. This\r\noccurrence was quickly embellished and inwoven by legend, and great\r\nuncertainty still prevails with regard to several important points. The\r\nreconciliation was only effected after prolonged negotiations and\r\ndefinite pledges on the part of the king, and it was with reluctance\r\nthat Gregory at length gave way, for, if he conferred his absolution,\r\nthe diet of princes in Augsburg, in which he might reasonably hope to\r\nact as arbitrator, would either be rendered purposeless, or, if it met\r\nat all, would wear an entirely different character. It was impossible,\r\nhowever, to deny the penitent re-entrance into the church, and the\r\npolitician had in this case to be subordinated to the priest. Still the\r\nremoval of the ban did not imply a genuine reconciliation, and no basis\r\nwas gained for a settlement of the great questions at issue--notably\r\nthat of investiture. A new conflict was indeed inevitable from the very\r\nfact that Henry IV. naturally considered the sentence of deposition\r\nrepealed with that of excommunication; while Gregory on the other hand,\r\nintent on reserving his freedom of action, gave no hint on the subject\r\nat Canossa.\r\n\r\nThat the excommunication of Henry IV. was simply a pretext--not a\r\nmotive--for the opposition of the rebellious German nobles is manifest.\r\nFor not only did they persist in their policy after his absolution, but\r\nthey took the more decided step of setting up a rival king in the person\r\nof Duke Rudolph of Swabia (Forchheim, March 1077). At the election the\r\npapal legates present observed the appearance of neutrality, and Gregory\r\nhimself sought to maintain this attitude during the following years. His\r\ntask was the easier in that the two parties were of fairly equal\r\nstrength, each endeavouring to gain the upper hand by the accession of\r\nthe pope to their side. But his hopes and labours, with the object of\r\nreceiving an appeal to act as arbitrator in the dynastic strife, were\r\nfruitless, and the result of his non-committal policy was that he\r\nforfeited in large measure the confidence of both parties. Finally he\r\ndecided for Rudolph of Swabia in consequence of his victory at\r\nFlarchheim (January 27, 1080). Under pressure from the Saxons, and\r\nmisinformed as to the significance of this battle, Gregory abandoned his\r\nwaiting policy and again pronounced the excommunication and deposition\r\nof King Henry (March 7, 1080), unloosing at the same time all oaths\r\nsworn to him in the past or the future. But the papal censure now proved\r\na very different thing from the papal censure four years previously. In\r\nwide circles it was felt to be an injustice, and men began to put the\r\nquestion--so dangerous to the prestige of the pope--whether an\r\nexcommunication pronounced on frivolous grounds was entitled to respect.\r\nTo make matters worse, Rudolph of Swabia died on the 16th of October of\r\nthe same year. True, a new claimant--Hermann of Luxemburg--was put\r\nforward in August 1081, but his personality was ill adapted for a leader\r\nof the Gregorian party in Germany, and the power of Henry IV. was in the\r\nascendant. The king, who had now been schooled by experience, took up\r\nthe struggle thus forced upon him with great vigour. He refused to\r\nacknowledge the ban on the ground of illegality. A council had been\r\nsummoned at Brixen, and on the 25th of June 1080 it pronounced Gregory\r\ndeposed and nominated the archbishop Guibert of Ravenna as his\r\nsuccessor--a policy of anti-king, anti-pope. In 1081 Henry opened the\r\nconflict against Gregory in Italy. The latter had now fallen on evil\r\ndays, and he lived to see thirteen cardinals desert him, Rome\r\nsurrendered by the Romans to the German king, Guibert of Ravenna\r\nenthroned as Clement III. (March 24, 1084), and Henry crowned emperor by\r\nhis rival, while he himself was constrained to flee from Rome.\r\n\r\nThe relations of Gregory to the remaining European states were\r\npowerfully influenced by his German policy; for Germany, by engrossing\r\nthe bulk of his powers, not infrequently compelled him to show to other\r\nrulers that moderation and forbearance which he withheld from the German\r\nking. The attitude of the Normans brought him a rude awakening. The\r\ngreat concessions made to them under Nicholas II. were not only\r\npowerless to stem their advance into central Italy but failed to secure\r\neven the expected protection for the papacy. When Gregory was hard\r\npressed by Henry IV., Robert Guiscard left him to his fate, and only\r\ninterfered when he himself was menaced with the German arms. Then, on\r\nthe capture of Rome, he abandoned the city to the tender mercies of his\r\nwarriors, and by the popular indignation evoked by his act brought about\r\nthe banishment of Gregory.\r\n\r\nIn the case of several countries, Gregory attempted to establish a claim\r\nof suzerainty on the part of the see of St Peter, and to secure the\r\nrecognition of its self-asserted rights of possession. On the ground of\r\n\"immemorial usage\" Corsica and Sardinia were assumed to belong to the\r\nRoman Church. Spain and Hungary were also claimed as her property, and\r\nan attempt was made to induce the king of Denmark to hold his realm as a\r\nfief from the pope. Philip I. of France, by his simony and the violence\r\nof his proceedings against the church, provoked a threat of summary\r\nmeasures; and excommunication, deposition and the interdict, appeared to\r\nbe imminent in 1074. Gregory, however, refrained from translating his\r\nmenaces into actions, although the attitude of the king showed no\r\nchange, for he wished to avoid a dispersion of his strength in the\r\nconflict soon to break out in Germany. In England, again, William the\r\nConqueror derived no less benefit from this state of affairs. He felt\r\nhimself so safe that he interfered autocratically with the management of\r\nthe church, forbade the bishops to visit Rome, filled bishoprics and\r\nabbeys, and evinced little anxiety when the pope expatiated to him on\r\nthe different principles which he entertained as to the relationship of\r\nchurch and state, or when he prohibited him from commerce or commanded\r\nhim to acknowledge himself a vassal of the apostolic chair. Gregory had\r\nno power to compel the English king to an alteration in his\r\necclesiastical policy, so chose to ignore what he could not approve, and\r\neven considered it advisable to assure him of his particular affection.\r\n\r\nGregory, in fact, established relations--if no more--with every land in\r\nChristendom; though these relations did not invariably realize the\r\necclesiastico-political hopes connected with them. His correspondence\r\nextended to Poland, Russia and Bohemia. He wrote in friendly terms to\r\nthe Saracen king of Mauretania in north Africa, and attempted, though\r\nwithout success, to bring the Armenians into closer contact with Rome.\r\nThe East, especially, claimed his interest. The ecclesiastical rupture\r\nbetween the bishops of Rome and Byzantium was a severe blow to him, and\r\nhe laboured hard to restore the former amicable relationship. At that\r\nperiod it was impossible to suspect that the schism implied a definite\r\nseparation, for prolonged schisms had existed in past centuries, but had\r\nalways been surmounted in the end. Both sides, moreover, had an\r\ninterest in repairing the breach between the churches. Thus,\r\nimmediately on his accession to the pontificate, Gregory sought to come\r\ninto touch with the emperor Michael VII. and succeeded. When the news of\r\nthe Saracenic outrages on the Christians in the East filtered to Rome,\r\nand the political embarrassments of the Byzantine emperor increased, he\r\nconceived the project of a great military expedition and exhorted the\r\nfaithful to participation in the task of recovering the sepulchre of the\r\nLord (1074). Thus the idea of a crusade to the Holy Land already floated\r\nbefore Gregory's vision, and his intention was to place himself at the\r\nhead. But the hour for such a gigantic enterprise was not yet come, and\r\nthe impending struggle with Henry IV. turned his energies into another\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\nIn his treatment of ecclesiastical policy and ecclesiastical reform,\r\nGregory did not stand alone, but on the contrary found powerful support.\r\nSince the middle of the 11th century the tendency--mainly represented by\r\nCluny--towards a stricter morality and a more earnest attitude to life,\r\nespecially on the part of the clergy, had converted the papacy; and,\r\nfrom Leo IX. onward, the popes had taken the lead in the movement. Even\r\nbefore his election, Gregory had gained the confidence of these circles,\r\nand, when he assumed the guidance of the church, they laboured for him\r\nwith extreme devotion. From his letters we see how he fostered his\r\nconnexion with them and stimulated their zeal, how he strove to awake\r\nthe consciousness that his cause was the cause of God and that to\r\nfurther it was to render service to God. By this means he created a\r\npersonal party, unconditionally attached to himself, and he had his\r\nconfidants in every country. In Italy Bishop Anselm of Lucca, to take an\r\nexample, belonged to their number. Again, the duchess Beatrice of\r\nTuscany and her daughter the Margravine Matilda, who put her great\r\nwealth at his disposal, were of inestimable service. The empress Agnes\r\nalso adhered to his cause. In upper Italy the Patarenes had worked for\r\nhim in many ways, and all who stood for their objects stood for the\r\npope. In Germany at the beginning of his reign the higher ranks of the\r\nclergy stood aloof from him and were confirmed in their attitude by some\r\nof his regulations. But Bishop Altmann of Passau, who has already been\r\nmentioned, and Archbishop Gebhard of Salzburg, were among his most\r\nzealous followers. That the convent of Hirschau in Swabia was held by\r\nGregory was a fact of much significance, for its monks spread over the\r\nland as itinerant agitators and accomplished much for him in southern\r\nGermany. In England Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury probably stood\r\nclosest to him; in France his champion was Bishop Hugo of Die, who\r\nafterwards ascended the archiepiscopal chair of Lyons.\r\n\r\nThe whole life-work of Gregory VII. was based on his conviction that the\r\nchurch has been founded by God and entrusted with the task of embracing\r\nall mankind in a single society in which His will is the only law; that,\r\nin her capacity as a divine institution, she outtops all human\r\nstructures; and that the pope, _qua_ head of the church, is the\r\nvice-regent of God on earth, so that disobedience to him implies\r\ndisobedience to God--or, in other words, a defection from Christianity.\r\nElaborating an idea discoverable in St Augustine, he looked on the\r\nworldly state--a purely human creation--as an unhallowed edifice whose\r\ncharacter is sufficiently manifest from the fact that it abolishes the\r\nequality of man, and that it is built up by violence and injustice. He\r\ndeveloped these views in a famous series of letters to Bishop Hermann of\r\nMetz. But it is clear from the outset that we are only dealing with\r\nreflections of strictly theoretical importance; for any attempt to\r\ninterpret them in terms of action would have bound the church to\r\nannihilate not merely a single definite state, but all states. Thus\r\nGregory, as a politician desirous of achieving some result, was driven\r\nin practice to adopt a different standpoint. He acknowledged the\r\nexistence of the state as a dispensation of Providence, described the\r\ncoexistence of church and state as a divine ordinance, and emphasized\r\nthe necessity of union between the _sacerdotium_ and the _imperium_. But\r\nat no period would he have dreamed of putting the two powers on an\r\nequality; the superiority of church to state was to him a fact which\r\nadmitted of no discussion and which he had never doubted. Again, this\r\nvery superiority of the church implied in his eyes a superiority of the\r\npapacy, and he did not shrink from drawing the extreme conclusions from\r\nthese premises. In other words, he claimed the right of excommunicating\r\nand deposing incapable monarchs, and of confirming the choice of their\r\nsuccessors. This habit of thought needs to be appreciated in order to\r\nunderstand his efforts to bring individual states into feudal subjection\r\nto the chair of St Peter. It was no mere question of formality, but the\r\nfirst step to the realization of his ideal theocracy comprising each and\r\nevery state.\r\n\r\nSince this papal conception of the state involved the exclusion of\r\nindependence and autonomy, the history of the relationship between\r\nchurch and state is the history of one continued struggle. In the time\r\nof Gregory it was the question of appointment to spiritual offices--the\r\nso-called _investiture_--which brought the theoretical controversy to a\r\nhead. The preparatory steps had already been taken by Leo IX., and the\r\nsubsequent popes had advanced still further on the path he indicated;\r\nbut it was reserved for Gregory and his enactments to provoke the\r\noutbreak of the great conflict which dominated the following decades. By\r\nthe first law (1075) the right of investiture for churches was in\r\ngeneral terms denied to the laity. In 1078 neglect of this prohibition\r\nwas made punishable by excommunication, and, by a further decree of the\r\nsame year, every investiture conferred by a layman was declared invalid\r\nand its acceptance pronounced liable to penalty. It was, moreover,\r\nenacted that every layman should restore, under pain of excommunication,\r\nall lands of the church, held by him as fiefs from princes or clerics;\r\nand that, henceforward, the assent of the pope, the archbishop, &c., was\r\nrequisite for any investiture of ecclesiastical property. Finally in\r\n1080 the forms regulating the canonical appointment to a bishopric were\r\npromulgated. In case of a vacancy the election was to be conducted by\r\nthe people and clergy under the auspices of a bishop nominated by the\r\npope or metropolitan; after which the consent of the pope or archbishop\r\nwas to be procured; if any violation of these injunctions occurred, the\r\nelection should be null and void and the right of choice pass to the\r\npope or metropolitan. In so legislating, Gregory had two objects: in the\r\nfirst place, to withdraw the appointment to episcopal offices from the\r\ninfluence of the king; in the second, to replace that influence by his\r\nown. The intention was not to increase the power of the metropolitan: he\r\nsimply desired that the nomination of bishops by the pope should be\r\nsubstituted for the prevalent nomination of bishops by the king. But in\r\nthis course of action Gregory had a still more ambitious goal before his\r\neyes. If he could once succeed in abolishing the lay investiture the\r\nking would, _ipso facto_, be deprived of his control over the great\r\npossessions assigned to the church by himself and his predecessors, and\r\nhe could have no security that the duties and services attached to those\r\npossessions would continue to be discharged for the benefit of the\r\nEmpire. The bishops in fact were to retain their position as princes of\r\nthe Empire, with all the lands and rights of supremacy pertaining to\r\nthem in that capacity, but the bond between them and the Empire was to\r\nbe dissolved: they were to owe allegiance not to the king, but to the\r\npope--a non-German sovereign who, in consequence of the Italian policy\r\nof the German monarchy, found himself in perpetual opposition to\r\nGermany. Thus, by his ecclesiastical legislation, Gregory attempted to\r\nshake the very foundations on which the constitution of the German\r\nempire rested, while completely ignoring the historical development of\r\nthat constitution (see INVESTITURE).\r\n\r\nThat energy which Gregory threw into the expansion of the papal\r\nauthority, and which brought him into collision with the secular powers,\r\nwas manifested no less in the internal government of the church. He\r\nwished to see all important matters of dispute referred to Rome; appeals\r\nwere to be addressed to himself, and he arrogated the right of\r\nlegislation. The fact that his laws were usually promulgated by Roman\r\nsynods which he convened during Lent does not imply that these possessed\r\nan independent position; on the contrary, they were entirely dominated\r\nby his influence, and were no more than the instruments of his will.\r\nThe centralization of ecclesiastical government in Rome naturally\r\ninvolved a curtailment of the powers of the bishops and metropolitans.\r\nSince these in part refused to submit voluntarily and attempted to\r\nassert their traditional independence, the pontificate of Gregory is\r\ncrowded with struggles against the higher ranks of the prelacy. Among\r\nthe methods he employed to break their power of resistance, the despatch\r\nof legates proved peculiarly effective. The regulation, again, that the\r\nmetropolitans should apply at Rome in person for the pallium--pronounced\r\nessential to their qualifications for office--served to school them in\r\nhumility.\r\n\r\nThis battle for the foundation of papal omnipotence within the church is\r\nconnected with his championship of compulsory celibacy among the clergy\r\nand his attack on simony. Gregory VII. did not introduce the celibacy of\r\nthe priesthood into the church, for even in antiquity it was enjoined by\r\nnumerous laws. He was not even the first pope to renew the injunction in\r\nthe 11th century, for legislation on the question begins as early as in\r\nthe reign of Leo IX. But he took up the struggle with greater energy and\r\npersistence than his predecessors. In 1074 he published an encyclical,\r\nrequiring all to renounce their obedience to those bishops who showed\r\nindulgence to their clergy in the matter of celibacy. In the following\r\nyear he commanded the laity to accept no official ministrations from\r\nmarried priests and to rise against all such. He further deprived these\r\nclerics of their revenues. Wherever these enactments were proclaimed\r\nthey encountered tenacious opposition, and violent scenes were not\r\ninfrequent, as the custom of marriage was widely diffused throughout the\r\ncontemporary priesthood. Other decrees were issued by Gregory in\r\nsubsequent years, but were now couched in milder terms, since it was no\r\npart of his interest to increase the numbers of the German faction. As\r\nto the objectionable nature of simony--the transference or acquisition\r\nof a spiritual office for monetary considerations--no doubt could exist\r\nin the mind of an earnest Christian, and no theoretical justification\r\nwas ever attempted. The practice, however, had attained great dimensions\r\nboth among the clergy and the laity, and the sharp campaign, which had\r\nbeen waged since the days of Leo IX., had done little to limit its\r\nscope. The reason was that in many cases it had assumed an extremely\r\nsubtle form, and detection was difficult when the simony took the\r\ncharacter of a tax or an honorarium. The fact, again, that lay\r\ninvestiture was described as simony, inevitably brought with it an\r\nelement of confusion, and, in the case of a charge of simoniacal\r\npractices, enormously accentuates the difficulty of determining the\r\nactual state of affairs. The war against simony in its original form was\r\nundoubtedly necessary, but it led to highly complicated and problematic\r\nissues. Was the priest or bishop, whose ordination was due to simony,\r\nactually in the possession of the sacerdotal or episcopal power or not?\r\nIf the answer was in the affirmative, it would seem possible to buy the\r\nHoly Ghost; if in the negative, then obviously all the official acts of\r\nthe respective priest or bishop--which, according to the doctrine of the\r\nchurch, presupposed the possession of a spiritual quality--were invalid.\r\nAnd, since the number of simoniacal bishops was at that period extremely\r\nlarge, incalculable consequences resulted. The difficulty of the problem\r\naccounts for the diversity of solutions propounded. The perplexity of\r\nthe situation was aggravated by the fact that, if the stricter view was\r\nadopted, it followed that the sacrament of ordination must be pronounced\r\ninvalid, even in the cases where it had been unconsciously sought at the\r\nhands of a simoniac, for the dispenser was in point of fact no bishop,\r\nalthough he exercised the episcopal functions and his transgressions\r\nwere unknown, and consequently it was impossible for him to ordain\r\nothers. In the time of Gregory the conflict was still swaying to and\r\nfro, and he himself in 1078 declared consecration by a simoniac null and\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\nThe pontificate of Gregory VII. came to a melancholy close, for he died\r\nan exile in Salerno; the Romans and a number of his most trusted\r\ncoadjutors had renounced him, and the faithful band in Germany had\r\nshrunk to scant proportions. Too much the politician, too rough in his\r\nmethods, too exclusively the representative of the Roman see and its\r\ninterests, he had gained more enemies than friends. He was of course a\r\nmaster of statecraft; he had pursued political ends with consummate\r\nskill, causing them to masquerade as requirements of religion; but he\r\nforgot that incitement to civil war, the preaching of rebellion, and the\r\nrelease of subjects from their oaths, were methods which must infallibly\r\nlead to moral anarchy, and tend, with justice, to stifle the confidence\r\nonce felt in him. The more he accustomed his contemporaries to the\r\nbelief that any and every measure--so long as it opened up some prospect\r\nof success--was good in his sight, no matter how dangerous the fruits it\r\nmight mature, the fainter grew their perception of the fact that he was\r\nnot only a statesman but primarily the head of the Christian Church.\r\nThat the frail bonds of piety and religious veneration for the chair of\r\nSt Peter had given way in the struggle for power was obvious to all,\r\nwhen he himself lost that power and the star of his opponent was in the\r\nascendant. He had given the rein to his splendid gifts as a ruler, and\r\nin his capacity of pope he omitted to provide an equivalent\r\ncounterpoise. We are told that he was once an impressive preacher, and\r\nhe could write to his faithful countesses in terms which prove that he\r\nwas not wanting in religious feeling; but in the whirlpool of secular\r\npolitics this phase of his character was never sufficiently developed to\r\nallow the vice-gerent of Christ to be heard instead of the hierarch in\r\nhis official acts.\r\n\r\nBut to estimate the pontificate of Gregory by the disasters of its\r\nclosing years would be to misconceive its significance for the history\r\nof the papacy entirely. On the contrary, his reign forms an important\r\nchapter in the history of the popedom as an institution; it contains the\r\ngerms of far-reaching modifications of the church, and it gave new\r\nimpulses to both theory and practice, the value of which may indeed be\r\ndifferently estimated, but of which the effects are indubitable. It was\r\nhe who conceived and formulated the ideal of the papacy as a structure\r\nembracing all peoples and lands. He took the first step towards the\r\ncodification of ecclesiastical law and the definite ratification of the\r\nclaims of the apostolic chair as corner-stones in the church's\r\nfoundation. He educated the clergy and the lay world in obedience to\r\nRome; and, finally, it was due to his efforts that the duty of the\r\npriest with regard to sexual abstinence was never afterwards a matter of\r\ndoubt in the Catholic Christianity of the West.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of May 1085 he died, unbroken by the misfortunes of his last\r\nyears, and unshaken in his self-certainty. _Dilexi justitiam et odivi\r\niniquitatem: propterea morior in exilio_--are said to have been his last\r\nwords. In 1584 Gregory XIII. received him into the _Martyrologium\r\nRomanum_; in 1606 he was canonized by Paul V. The words dedicated to him\r\nin the _Breviarium Romanum_, for May 25, contain such an apotheosis of\r\nhis pontificate that in the 18th and 19th centuries they were prohibited\r\nby the governments of several countries with Roman Catholic populations.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--A comprehensive survey of the sources and literature\r\n  for the history of Gregory VII. is given by C. Mirbt, s.v. \"Gregor\r\n  VII.\" in Herzog-Hauck, _Realencyklopadie_, 3rd ed. vol. vii. pp. 96\r\n  sqq. The main source for the reign of Gregory consists of his letters\r\n  and decrees, the greater part of which are collected in the\r\n  _Registrum_ (ed. P. Jaffe, _Bibliotheca rerum Germanicarum_, ii.,\r\n  Berlin, 1865). The letters preserved in addition to this official\r\n  collection are also reprinted by Jaffe under the title of _Epistolae\r\n  collectae_. The _Dictatus Papae_--a list of twenty-seven short\r\n  sentences on the rights of the pope,--which is given in the\r\n  _Registrum_, is not the work of Gregory VII., but should probably be\r\n  ascribed to Cardinal Deusdedit. Further: A. Potthast, _Bibliotheca\r\n  historica medii aevi_, i. (2nd ed., Berlin, 1896), pp. 541 sq., ii.\r\n  1351; P. Jaffe, _Regesta pontificum_ (2nd ed., 1865), tome i. pp.\r\n  594-649, Nr. 4771-5313, tome ii. p. 751. The most important letters\r\n  and decrees of Gregory VII. are reprinted by C. Mirbt, _Quellen zur\r\n  Geschichte des Papsttums_ (2nd ed., Tubingen, 1901), Nr. 183 sqq., pp.\r\n  100 sqq. The oldest life of Gregory is that by Paul von Bermried,\r\n  reprinted, e.g. by Watterich, _Vitae pontificum_, i. 474-546. Among\r\n  the historians the following are of especial importance: Berthold,\r\n  Bernold, Lambert von Hersfeld, Bruno, Marianus Scotus, Leo of Ostia,\r\n  Peter of Marte Cassino, Sigebert of Gembloux, Hugo of Flavigny,\r\n  Arnulph and Landulf of Milan, Donizo--their works being reprinted in\r\n  the section \"Scriptores\" in the _Monumenta Germaniae historica_, vols.\r\n  v., vi., vii., viii., xii. The struggles which broke out under Gregory\r\n  VII. and were partially continued in the subsequent decades gave rise\r\n  to a pamphlet literature which is of extreme importance for their\r\n  internal history. The extant materials vary greatly in extent, and\r\n  display much diversity from the literary-historical point of view.\r\n  Most of them are printed in the _Monumenta Germaniae_, under the\r\n  title, _Libelli de lite imperatorum et pontificum saeculis XI. et XII.\r\n  conscripti_, tome i. (Hanover, 1891), tome ii. (1892), tome iii.\r\n  (1897). The scientific investigation of the Gregorian age has received\r\n  enormous benefit from the critical editions of the sources in the\r\n  _Monumenta Germaniae_, so that the old literature is for the most part\r\n  antiquated. This is true even of the great monograph on this pope--A.\r\n  F. Gfrorer, _Papst Gregorius VII. und sein Zeitalter_ (7 vols.,\r\n  Schaffhausen, 1859-1861), which must be used with extreme caution. The\r\n  present state of criticism is represented by the following works: G.\r\n  Meyer von Knonau, _Jahrbucher des deutschen Reichs unter Heinrich IV.\r\n  und Heinrich V._, vol. i. (Leipzig, 1890), ii. (1894), iii. (1900),\r\n  iv. (1903); W. Martens, _Gregor VII., sein Leben und Werken_ (2 vols.,\r\n  Leipzig, 1904); C. Mirbt, _Die Publizistik im Zeitalter Gregors VII._\r\n  (Leipzig, 1894); A. Hauck, _Kirchengeschichte Deutschlands_ (3 vols.,\r\n  Leipzig, 1894). The special literature on individual events during the\r\n  Gregorian pontificate is so extensive that no list can be given here.\r\n  On Gregory's elevation to the chair, cf. C. Mirbt, _Die Wahl Gregors\r\n  VII._ (Marburg, 1892). See also A. H. Mathew, D.D., _Life and Times of\r\n  Hildebrand, Pope Gregory VII._ (1910).     (C. M.)\r\n\r\nGREGORY VIII. (_Mauritius Burdinus_), antipope from 1118 to 1121, was a\r\nnative of southern France, who had crossed the Pyrenees while young and\r\nhad later been made archbishop of Braga. Suspended by Paschal II. in\r\n1114 on account of a dispute with the Spanish primate and papal legate,\r\nthe archbishop of Toledo, he went to Rome and regained favour to such an\r\nextent that he was employed by the pope on important legations. He\r\nopposed the extreme Hildebrandine policy, and, on the refusal of\r\nGelasius II. to concede the emperor's claim to investiture, he was\r\nproclaimed pope at Rome by Henry V. on the 8th of March 1118. He was not\r\nuniversally recognized, however, and never fully enjoyed the papal\r\noffice. He was excommunicated by Gelasius II. in April 1118, and by\r\nCalixtus II. at the synod of Reims (October 1119). He was driven from\r\nRome by the latter in June 1121, and, having been surrendered by the\r\ncitizens of Sutri, he was forced to accompany in ridiculous guise the\r\ntriumphal procession of Calixtus through Rome. He was exiled to the\r\nconvent of La Cava, where he died.\r\n\r\n  The life of Gregory VIII. by Baluzius in _Baluzii miscellanea_, vol.\r\n  i, ed. by J. D. Mansi (Lucca, 1761), is an excellent vindication of an\r\n  antipope. The chief sources are in _Monumenta Germaniae historica_,\r\n  _Scriptores_, vols. 5 and 20, and in J. M. Watterich, _Pontif.

(_Alberto de Mora_), pope from the 21st of October to the\r\n17th of December 1187, a native of Benevento and Praemonstratensian\r\nmonk, successively abbot of St Martin at Laon, cardinal-deacon of San'\r\nAdriano al foro, cardinal-priest of San Lorenzo in Lucina, and\r\nchancellor of the Roman Church, was elected to succeed Urban III. Of\r\namiable disposition, he hastened to make peace with Henry VI. and\r\npromised not to oppose the latter's claim to Sicily. He addressed\r\ngeneral letters both to the bishops, reminding them of their duties to\r\nthe Roman Church, especially of their required visits _ad limina_, and\r\nto the whole Christian people, urging a new crusade to recover\r\nJerusalem. He died at Pisa while engaged in making peace between the\r\nPisans and Genoese in order to secure the help of both cities in the\r\ncrusade. His successor was Clement III.\r\n\r\n  His letters are in J. P. Migne, _Patrol. Lat._ vol. 202. Consult also\r\n  J. M. Watterich, _Pontif.

(_Ugolino Conti de Segni_), pope from the 19th of March\r\n1227, to the 22nd of August 1241, was a nobleman of Anagni and probably\r\na nephew of Innocent III. He studied at Paris and Bologna, and, having\r\nbeen successively archpriest of St Peter's, papal chaplain,\r\ncardinal-deacon of Sant' Eustachio, cardinal-bishop of Ostia, the first\r\nprotector of the Franciscan order, and papal legate in Germany under\r\nInnocent III., and Honorius III., he succeeded the latter in the papacy.\r\nHe had long been on friendly terms with the emperor Frederick II., but\r\nnow excommunicated him (29th of September 1227) for continued neglect of\r\nhis vows and refusal to undertake the crusade. When Frederick finally\r\nset out the following June without making submission to the pope,\r\nGregory raised an insurrection against him in Germany, and forced him in\r\n1230 to beg for absolution. The Romans, however, soon began a very\r\nbitter war against the temporal power and exiled the pope (1st of June\r\n1231). Hardly had this contest been brought to an end favourable to the\r\npapacy (May 1235) when Gregory came into fresh conflict with Frederick\r\nII. He again excommunicated the emperor and released his subjects from\r\ntheir allegiance (24th of March 1239). Frederick, on his side, invaded\r\nthe Papal States and prevented the assembling of a general council\r\nconvoked for Easter 1241. The work of Gregory, however, was by no means\r\nlimited to his relations with emperor and Romans. He systematized the\r\nInquisition and entrusted it to the Dominicans; his rules against\r\nheretics remained in force until the time of Sixtus V. He supported\r\nHenry III. against the English barons, and protested against the\r\nPragmatic Sanction of Louis IX. of France. He sent monks to\r\nConstantinople to negotiate with the Greeks for church unity, but\r\nwithout result. He canonized Saints Elizabeth of Thuringia, Dominic,\r\nAnthony of Padua and Francis of Assisi. He permitted free study of the\r\nAristotelian writings, and issued (1234), through his chaplain, Raymond\r\nof Pennaforte, an important new compilation of decretals which he\r\nprescribed in the bull _Rex pacificus_ should be the standard text-book\r\nin canon law at the universities of Bologna and Paris. Gregory was famed\r\nfor his learning and eloquence, his blameless life, and his great\r\nstrength of character. He died on the 22nd of August 1241, while\r\nFrederick II. was advancing against him, and was succeeded by Celestine\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n  For the life of Gregory IX., consult his Letters in _Monumenta\r\n  Germaniae historica, Epistolae saeculi XIII. e regestis pontif.

(_Tebaldo Visconti_), pope from the 1st of September 1271, to\r\nthe 10th of January 1276, was born at Piacenza in 1208, studied for the\r\nchurch, and became archdeacon of Liege. The eighteen cardinals who met\r\nto elect a successor to Clement IV. were divided into French and Italian\r\nfactions, which wrangled over the election for nearly three years in the\r\nmidst of great popular excitement, until finally, stirred by the\r\neloquence of St Bonaventura, the Franciscan monk, they entrusted the\r\nchoice to six electors, who hit on Visconti, at that time accompanying\r\nEdward of England on the crusade. He returned to Rome and was ordained\r\npriest on the 19th of March 1272, and consecrated on the 27th. He at\r\nonce summoned the fourteenth general council of the Catholic Church,\r\nwhich met at Lyons in 1274, with an attendance of some 1600 prelates,\r\nfor the purpose of considering the eastern schism, the condition of the\r\nHoly Land, and the abuses in the church. The Greeks were persuaded,\r\nthanks to St Bonaventura, to consent to a union with Rome for the time\r\nbeing, and Rudolph of Habsburg renounced at the council all imperial\r\nrights in the States of the Church. The most celebrated among the many\r\nreform decrees issued by Gregory was the constitution determining for\r\nthe first time the form of conclave at papal elections, which in large\r\nmeasure has remained ever since the law of the church. Gregory was on\r\nhis way to Rome to crown Rudolph and send him out on a great crusade in\r\ncompany with the kings of England, France, Aragon and Sicily, when he\r\ndied at Arezzo on the 10th of January 1276. He was a nobleman, fond of\r\npeace and actuated by the consciousness of a great mission. He has been\r\nhonoured as a saint by the inhabitants of Arezzo and Piacenza. His\r\nsuccessor in the papacy was Innocent V.\r\n\r\n  The registers of Gregory X. have been published by J.

(_Pierre Roger de Beaufort_), pope from the 30th of December\r\n1370 to the 27th of March 1378, born in Limousin in 1330, created\r\ncardinal-deacon of Sta Maria Nuova by his uncle, Clement VI., was the\r\nsuccessor of Urban V. His efforts to establish peace between France and\r\nEngland and to aid the Eastern Christians against the Turks were\r\nfruitless, but he prevented the Visconti of Milan from making further\r\nencroachments on the States of the Church. He introduced many reforms in\r\nthe various monastic orders and took vigorous measures against the\r\nheresies of the time. His energy was stimulated by the stirring words of\r\nCatherine of Siena, to whom in particular the transference of the papal\r\nsee back to Italy (17th of January 1377) was almost entirely due. Whilst\r\nat Rome he issued several bulls to the archbishop of Canterbury, the\r\nking of England, and the university of Oxford, commanding an\r\ninvestigation of Wycliffe's doctrines. Gregory was meditating a return\r\nto Avignon when he died. He was the last of the French popes who for\r\nsome seventy years had made Avignon their see, a man learned and full of\r\nzeal for the church, but irresolute and guilty of nepotism. The great\r\nschism, which was to endure fifty years, broke out soon after the\r\nelection of his successor, Urban VI.\r\n\r\n  See H. J. Tomaseth, \"Die Register u. Secretare Urbans V. u.

(_Angelo Coriaro_, or _Correr_), pope from the 30th of\r\nNovember 1406, to the 4th of July 1415, was born of a noble family at\r\nVenice about 1326. Successively bishop of Castello, Latin patriarch of\r\nConstantinople, cardinal-priest of San Marco, and papal secretary, he\r\nwas elected to succeed Innocent VII., after an interregnum of\r\ntwenty-four days, under the express condition that, should the antipope\r\nBenedict XIII. at Avignon renounce all claim to the papacy, he also\r\nwould renounce his, so that the long schism might be terminated. As\r\npope, he concluded a treaty with his rival at Marseilles, by which a\r\ngeneral council was to be held at Savona in September, 1408, but King\r\nLadislaus of Naples, who opposed the plan from policy, seized Rome and\r\nbrought the negotiations to nought. Gregory had promised not to create\r\nany more cardinals, and when he did so, in 1408, his former cardinals\r\ndeserted him and, together with the Avignon cardinals, convoked the\r\ncouncil of Pisa, which, despite its irregularity, proclaimed in June\r\n1409 the deposition of both popes and the election of Alexander V.\r\nGregory, still supported by Naples, Hungary, Bavaria, and by Rupert,\r\nking of the Romans, found protection with Ladislaus, and in a synod at\r\nCividale del Friuli banned Benedict and Alexander as schismatical,\r\nperjured and scandalous. John XXIII., having succeeded to the claims of\r\nAlexander in 1410, concluded a treaty with Ladislaus, by which Gregory\r\nwas banished from Naples on the 31st of October 1411. The pope then took\r\nrefuge with Carlo Malatesta, lord of Rimini, through whom he presented\r\nhis resignation to the council of Constance on the 4th of July 1415. A\r\nweak and easily-influenced old man, his resignation was the noblest act\r\nof his pontificate. The rest of his life was spent in peaceful obscurity\r\nas cardinal-bishop of Porto and legate of the mark of Ancona. He died at\r\nRecanati on the 18th of October 1417. Some writers reckon Alexander V.\r\nand John XXIII. as popes rather than as antipopes, and accordingly count\r\nGregory's pontificate from 1406 to 1409. Roman Catholic authorities,\r\nhowever, incline to the other reckoning.\r\n\r\n  See L. Pastor, _History of the Popes_, vol. i., trans. by F. I.\r\n  Antrobus (London, 1899); M.

(_Ugo Buoncompagno_), pope from 1572 to 1585, was born on\r\nthe 7th of January 1502, in Bologna, where he received his education,\r\nand subsequently taught, until called to Rome (1539) by Paul III., who\r\nemployed him in various offices. He bore a prominent part in the council\r\nof Trent, 1562-1563. In 1564 he was made cardinal by Pius IV., and, in\r\nthe following year, sent to Spain as legate. On the 13th of May 1572 he\r\nwas chosen pope to succeed Pius V. His previous life had been rather\r\nworldly, and not wholly free from spot; but as pope he gave no occasion\r\nof offence. He submitted to the influence of the rigorists, and carried\r\nforward the war upon heresy, though not with the savage vehemence of his\r\npredecessor. However, he received the news of the massacre of St\r\nBartholomew (23rd of August 1572) with joy, and publicly celebrated the\r\nevent, having been led to believe, according to his apologists, that\r\nFrance had been miraculously delivered, and that the Huguenots had\r\nsuffered justly as traitors. Having failed to rouse Spain and Venice\r\nagainst the Turks, Gregory attempted to form a general coalition against\r\nthe Protestants. He subsidized Philip II. in his wars in the\r\nNetherlands; aided the Catholic League in France; incited attacks upon\r\nElizabeth by way of Ireland. With the aid of the Jesuits, whose\r\nprivileges he multiplied, he conducted a vigorous propaganda. He\r\nestablished or endowed above a score of colleges, among them the\r\nCollegium Romanum (founded by Ignatius Loyola in 1550), and the\r\nCollegium Germanicum, in Rome. Among his noteworthy achievements are the\r\nreform of the calendar on the 24th of February 1582 (see CALENDAR); the\r\nimproved edition of the _Corpus juris canonici_, 1582; the splendid\r\nGregorian Chapel in St Peter's; the fountains of the Piazza Navona; the\r\nQuirinal Palace; and many other public works. To meet the expenses\r\nentailed by his liberality and extravagance, Gregory resorted to\r\nconfiscation, on the pretext of defective titles or long-standing\r\narrearages. The result was disastrous to the public peace: nobles armed\r\nin their defence; old feuds revived; the country became infested with\r\nbandits; not even in Rome could order be maintained. Amid these\r\ndisturbances Gregory died, on the 10th of April 1585, leaving to his\r\nsuccessor, Sixtus V., the task of pacifying the state.\r\n\r\n  See the contemporary lives by Cicarella, continuator of Platina, _De\r\n  vitis pontiff.

(_Nicolo Sfondrato_), pope 1590-1591, was born in Cremona,\r\non the 11th of February 1535, studied in Perugia, and Padua, became\r\nbishop of his native place in 1560, and took part in the council of\r\nTrent, 1562-1563. Gregory XIII. made him a cardinal, 1583, but\r\nill-health forbade his active participation in affairs. His election to\r\nthe papacy, to succeed Urban VII., on the 5th of December 1590, was due\r\nto Spanish influence. Gregory was upright and devout, but utterly\r\nignorant of politics. During his short pontificate the States of the\r\nChurch suffered dire calamities, famine, epidemic and a fresh outbreak\r\nof brigandage. Gregory was completely subservient to Philip II.; he\r\naided the league, excommunicated Henry of Navarre, and threatened his\r\nadherents with the ban; but the effect of his intervention was only to\r\nrally the moderate Catholics to the support of Henry, and to hasten his\r\nconversion. Gregory died on the 15th of October 1591, and was succeeded\r\nby Innocent IX.\r\n\r\n  See Ciaconius, _Vitae et res gestae summorum pontiff.

(_Alessandro Ludovisi_) was born on the 9th of January 1554,\r\nin Bologna, where he also studied and taught. He was made archbishop of\r\nhis native place and cardinal by Paul V., whom he succeeded as pope on\r\nthe 9th of February 1621. Despite his age and feebleness, Gregory\r\ndisplayed remarkable energy. He aided the emperor in the Thirty Years'\r\nWar, and the king of Poland against the Turks. He endorsed the claims of\r\nMaximilian of Bavaria to the electoral dignity, and was rewarded with\r\nthe gift of the Heidelberg library, which was carried off to Rome.\r\nGregory founded the Congregation of the Propaganda, encouraged missions,\r\nfixed the order to be observed in conclaves, and canonized Ignatius\r\nLoyola, Francis Xavier, Philip Neri and Theresa de Jesus. He died on the\r\n8th of July 1623, and was succeeded by Urban VIII.\r\n\r\n  See the contemporary life by Vitorelli, continuator of Ciaconius,\r\n  _Vitae et res gestae summorum pontiff.

F. C.)\r\n\r\nGREGORY XVI. (_Bartolommeo Alberto Cappellari_), pope from 1831 to 1846,\r\nwas born at Belluno on the 18th of September 1765, and at an early age\r\nentered the order of the Camaldoli, among whom he rapidly gained\r\ndistinction for his theological and linguistic acquirements. His first\r\nappearance before a wider public was in 1799, when he published against\r\nthe Italian Jansenists a controversial work entitled _Il Trionfo della\r\nSanta Sede_, which, besides passing through several editions in Italy,\r\nhas been translated into several European languages. In 1800 he became a\r\nmember of the Academy of the Catholic Religion, founded by Pius VII., to\r\nwhich he contributed a number of memoirs on theological and\r\nphilosophical questions and in 1805 was made abbot of San Gregorio on\r\nthe Caelian Hill. When Pius VII. was carried off from Rome in 1809,\r\nCappellari withdrew to Murano, near Venice, and in 1814, with some other\r\nmembers of his order, he removed to Padua; but soon after the\r\nrestoration of the pope he was recalled to Rome, where he received\r\nsuccessive appointments as vicar-general of the Camaldoli, councillor of\r\nthe Inquisition, prefect of the Propaganda, and examiner of bishops. In\r\nMarch 1825 he was created cardinal by Leo XII., and shortly afterwards\r\nwas entrusted with an important mission to adjust a concordat regarding\r\nthe interests of the Catholics of Belgium and the Protestants of\r\nHolland. On the 2nd of February 1831 he was, after sixty-four days'\r\nconclave, unexpectedly chosen to succeed Pius VIII. in the papal chair.\r\nThe revolution of 1830 had just inflicted a severe blow on the\r\necclesiastical party in France, and almost the first act of the new\r\ngovernment there was to seize Ancona, thus throwing all Italy, and\r\nparticularly the Papal States, into an excited condition which seemed to\r\ndemand strongly repressive measures. In the course of the struggle which\r\nensued it was more than once necessary to call in the Austrian bayonets.\r\nThe reactionaries in power put off their promised reforms so\r\npersistently as to anger even Metternich; nor did the replacement of\r\nBernetti by Lambruschini in 1836 mend matters; for the new cardinal\r\nsecretary of state objected even to railways and illuminating gas, and\r\nwas liberal chiefly in his employment of spies and of prisons. The\r\nembarrassed financial condition in which Gregory left the States of the\r\nChurch makes it doubtful how far his lavish expenditure in architectural\r\nand engineering works, and his magnificent patronage of learning in the\r\nhands of Mai, Mezzofanti, Gaetano, Moroni and others, were for the real\r\nbenefit of his subjects. The years of his pontificate were marked by the\r\nsteady development and diffusion of those ultramontane ideas which were\r\nultimately formulated, under the presidency of his successor Pius IX.,\r\nby the council of the Vatican. He died on the 1st of June 1846.\r\n\r\n  See A. M.

R.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREGORY,[1] the name of a Scottish family, many members of which\r\nattained high eminence in various departments of science, fourteen\r\nhaving held professorships in mathematics or medicine. Of the most\r\ndistinguished of their number a notice is given below.\r\n\r\nI. DAVID GREGORY (1627-1720), eldest son of the Rev. John Gregory of\r\nDrumoak, Aberdeenshire, who married Janet Anderson in 1621. He was for\r\nsome time connected with a mercantile house in Holland, but on\r\nsucceeding to the family estate of Kinardie returned to Scotland, and\r\noccupied most of his time in scientific pursuits, freely giving his\r\npoorer neighbours the benefit of his medical skill. He is said to have\r\nbeen the first possessor of a barometer in the north of Scotland; and on\r\naccount of his success by means of it in predicting changes in the\r\nweather, he was accused of witchcraft before the presbytery of Aberdeen,\r\nbut he succeeded in convincing that body of his innocence.\r\n\r\nII. JAMES GREGORY (1638-1675), Scottish mathematician, younger brother\r\nof the preceding, was educated at the grammar school of Aberdeen and at\r\nMarischal College of that city. At an early period he manifested a\r\nstrong inclination and capacity for mathematics and kindred sciences;\r\nand in 1663 he published his famous treatise _Optica promota_, in which\r\nhe made known his great invention, the Gregorian reflecting telescope.\r\nAbout 1665 he went to the university of Padua, where he studied for some\r\nyears, and in 1667 published _Vera circuli et hyperbolae quadratura_, in\r\nwhich he discussed infinite convergent series for the areas of the\r\ncircle and hyperbola. In the following year he published also at Padua\r\n_Geometriae pars universalis_, in which he gave a series of rules for\r\nthe rectification of curves and the mensuration of their solids of\r\nrevolution. On his return to England in this year he was elected a\r\nfellow of the Royal Society; in 1669 he became professor of mathematics\r\nin the university of St Andrews; and in 1674 he was transferred to the\r\nchair of mathematics in Edinburgh. In October 1675, while showing the\r\nsatellites of the planet Jupiter to some of his students through one of\r\nhis telescopes, he was suddenly struck with blindness, and he died a few\r\ndays afterwards.\r\n\r\n  He was also the author of _Exercitationes geometricae_ (1668), and, it\r\n  is alleged, of a satirical tract entitled _The Great and New Art of\r\n  Weighing Vanity_, intended to ridicule certain fallacies of a\r\n  contemporary writer on hydraulics, and published at Glasgow in 1672,\r\n  professedly by \"Patrick Mathers, archbeadle of the university of St\r\n  Andrews.\"\r\n\r\nIII. DAVID GREGORY (1661-1708), son of David Gregory (1627-1720), was\r\nborn in Aberdeen and educated partly in his native city and partly in\r\nEdinburgh, where he became professor of mathematics in 1683. From 1691\r\ntill his death he was Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford. His\r\nprincipal works are _Exercitatio geometrica de dimensione figurarum_\r\n(1684), _Catoptricae et dioptricae sphaericae elementa_ (1695), and\r\n_Astronomiae physicae et geometricae elementa_ (1702)--the last a work\r\nhighly esteemed by Sir Isaac Newton, of whose system it is an\r\nillustration and a defence. _A Treatise on Practical Geometry_ which he\r\nleft in manuscript was translated from the Latin and published in 1745.\r\nHe was succeeded in the chair of mathematics in Edinburgh by bis brother\r\nJames; another brother, Charles, was in 1707 appointed professor of\r\nmathematics in the university of St Andrews; and his eldest son, David\r\n(1696-1767), became professor of modern history at Oxford, and canon and\r\nsubsequently dean of Christ Church.\r\n\r\nIV. JOHN GREGORY (1724-1773), Scottish physician, grandson of James\r\nGregory (1638-1675) and youngest son of Dr James Gregory (d. 1731),\r\nprofessor of medicine in King's College, Aberdeen, was born at Aberdeen\r\non the 3rd of June 1724. He received his early education at the grammar\r\nschool of Aberdeen and at King's College in that city, and in 1741 he\r\nattended the medical classes at Edinburgh university. In 1745 he went to\r\nLeiden to complete his medical studies, and during his stay there he\r\nreceived without solicitation the degree of doctor of medicine from\r\nKing's College, Aberdeen. On his return from Holland he was elected\r\nprofessor of philosophy at King's College, but in 1749 he resigned his\r\nprofessorship on account of its duties interfering too much with his\r\nprivate practice. In 1754 he proceeded to London, where he made the\r\nacquaintance of many persons of distinction, and the same year was\r\nchosen fellow of the Royal Society. On the death in November 1755 of his\r\nbrother Dr James Gregory, who had succeeded his father as professor of\r\nmedicine in King's College, Aberdeen, he was appointed to that office.\r\nIn 1764 he removed to Edinburgh in the hope of obtaining a more extended\r\nfield of practice as a physician, and in 1766 he was appointed professor\r\nof the practice of medicine in the university of Edinburgh, to whose\r\neminence as a medical school he largely contributed. He died of gout on\r\nthe 10th of February 1773.\r\n\r\n  He is the author of _A Comparative View of the State and Faculties of\r\n  Man with those of the Animal World_ (1765); _Observations on the\r\n  Duties, Offices and Qualifications of a Physician_ (1772); _Elements\r\n  of the Practice of Physic_ (1772); and _A Father's Legacy to his\r\n  Daughters_ (1774). _His Whole Works_, with a life by Mr Tytler\r\n  (afterwards Lord Woodhouselee), were published at Edinburgh in 1788.\r\n\r\nV. JAMES GREGORY (1753-1821), Scottish physician, eldest son of the\r\npreceding, was born at Aberdeen in January 1753. He accompanied his\r\nfather to Edinburgh in 1764, and after going through the usual course of\r\nliterary studies at that university, he was for a short time a student\r\nat Christchurch, Oxford. It was there probably that he acquired that\r\ntaste for classical learning which afterwards distinguished him. He\r\nstudied medicine at Edinburgh, and, after graduating doctor of medicine\r\nin 1774, spent the greater part of the next two years in Holland, France\r\nand Italy. Shortly after his return to Scotland he was appointed in 1776\r\nto the chair his father had formerly held, and in the following year he\r\nalso entered on the duties of teacher of clinical medicine in the Royal\r\nInfirmary. On the illness of Dr William Cullen in 1790 he was appointed\r\njoint-professor of the practice of medicine, and he became the head of\r\nthe Edinburgh Medical School on the death of Dr Cullen in the same year.\r\nHe died on the 2nd of April 1821. As a medical practitioner Gregory was\r\nfor the last ten years of his life at the head of the profession in\r\nScotland. He was at one time president of the Edinburgh College of\r\nPhysicians, but his indiscretion in publishing certain private\r\nproceedings of the college led to his suspension on the 13th of May 1809\r\nfrom all rights and privileges which pertained to the fellowship.\r\n\r\n  Besides his _Conspectus medicinae theoreticae_, published in 1788 as a\r\n  text-book for his lectures on the institutes, Dr Gregory was the\r\n  author of \"A Theory of the Moods of Verbs,\" published in the _Edin.\r\n  Phil. Trans._ (1787), and of _Literary and Philosophical Essays_,\r\n  published in two volumes in 1792.\r\n\r\nVI. WILLIAM GREGORY (1803-1858), son of James Gregory (1753-1821), was\r\nborn on the 25th of December 1803. In 1837 he became professor of\r\nchemistry at the Andersonian Institution, Glasgow, in 1839 at King's\r\nCollege, Aberdeen, and in 1844 at Edinburgh University. He died on the\r\n24th of April 1858. Gregory was one of the first in England to advocate\r\nthe theories of Justus von Liebig, and translated several of his works.\r\nHe is also the author of _Outlines of Chemistry_ (1845), and an\r\n_Elementary Treatise on Chemistry_ (1853).\r\n\r\nVII. DUNCAN FARQUHARSON GREGORY (1813-1844), brother of the preceding,\r\nwas born on the 13th of April 1813. After studying at the university of\r\nEdinburgh he in 1833 entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was\r\nfor a time assistant professor of chemistry, but he devoted his\r\nattention chiefly to mathematics. He died on the 23rd of February 1844.\r\n\r\n  The _Cambridge Mathematical Journal_ was originated, and for some time\r\n  edited, by him; and he also published a _Collection of Examples of\r\n  Processes in the Differential and Integral Calculus_ (1841). A\r\n  _Treatise on the Application of Analysis to Solid Geometry_, which he\r\n  left unfinished, was completed by W. Walton, and published\r\n  posthumously in 1846. His _Mathematical Writings_, edited by W.\r\n  Walton, with a biographical memoir by Robert Leslie Ellis, appeared in\r\n  1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] See A. G. Stewart, _The Academic Gregories_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREGORY, EDWARD JOHN (1850-1909), British painter, born at Southampton,\r\nbegan work at the age of fifteen in the engineer's drawing office of the\r\nPeninsular and Oriental Company. Afterwards he studied at South\r\nKensington, and about 1871 entered on a successful career as an\r\nillustrator and as an admirable painter in oil and water colour. He was\r\nelected associate of the Royal Academy in 1883, academician in 1898, and\r\npresident of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1898.\r\nHis work is distinguished by remarkable technical qualities, by\r\nexceptional firmness and decision of draughtsmanship and by unusual\r\ncertainty of handling. His \"Marooned,\" a water colour, is in the\r\nNational Gallery of British Art. Many of his pictures were shown at\r\nBurlington House at the winter exhibition of 1909-1910 after his death\r\nin June 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREGORY, OLINTHUS GILBERT (1774-1841), English mathematician, was born\r\non the 29th of January 1774 at Yaxley in Huntingdonshire. Having been\r\neducated by Richard Weston, a Leicester botanist, he published in 1793 a\r\ntreatise, Lessons _Astronomical and Philosophical_. Having settled at\r\nCambridge in 1796, Gregory first acted as sub-editor on the _Cambridge\r\nIntelligencer_, and then opened a bookseller's shop. In 1802 he obtained\r\nan appointment as mathematical master at Woolwich through the influence\r\nof Charles Hutton, to whose notice he had been brought by a manuscript\r\non the \"Use of the Sliding Rule\"; and when Hutton resigned in 1807\r\nGregory succeeded him in the professorship. Failing health obliged him\r\nto retire in 1838, and he died at Woolwich on the 2nd of February 1841.\r\n\r\n  Gregory wrote _Hints for the Use of Teachers of Elementary\r\n  Mathematics_ (1840, new edition 1853), and _Mathematics for Practical\r\n  Men_ (1825), which was revised and enlarged by Henry Law in 1848, and\r\n  again by J. R. Young in 1862. His _Letters on the Evidences of\r\n  Christianity_ (1815) have been several times reprinted, and an\r\n  abridgment was published by the Religious Tract Society in 1853. He\r\n  will probably be longest remembered for his _Biography of Robert\r\n  Hall_, which first appeared in the collected edition of Hall's works,\r\n  was published separately in 1833, and has since passed through several\r\n  editions. The minor importance of his _Memoir of John Mason Good_\r\n  (1828) is due to the narrower fame of the subject. Gregory was one of\r\n  the founders of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1802 he was\r\n  appointed editor of the _Gentlemen's Diary_, and in 1818 editor of the\r\n  _Ladies' Diary_ and superintendent of the almanacs of the Stationers'\r\n  Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREIFENBERG, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Pomerania,\r\non the Rega, 45 m. N.E. of Stettin on the railway to Kolberg. Pop.\r\n(1905) 7208. It has two Evangelical churches (among them that of St\r\nMary, dating from 13th century), two ancient gateways, a powder tower\r\nand a gymnasium. The manufacture of machines, stoves and bricks are the\r\nprincipal industries. Greifenberg possessed municipal rights as early as\r\n1262, and in the 14th and 15th centuries had a considerable shipping\r\ntrade, but it lost much of its prosperity during the Thirty Years' War.\r\n\r\n  See Riemann, _Geschichte der Stadt Greifenberg_ (1862).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREIFENHAGEN, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Pomerania,\r\non the Reglitz, 12 m. S.S.W. of Stettin by rail. Pop. (1905) 6473. Its\r\nprosperity depends chiefly on agriculture and it has a considerable\r\ntrade in cattle. There are also felt manufactures and saw mills.\r\nGreifenhagen was built in 1230, and was raised to the rank of a town and\r\nfortified about 1250. In the Thirty Years' War it was taken both by the\r\nimperialists and the Swedes, and in 1675 it was captured by the\r\nBrandenburgers, into whose possession it came finally in 1679.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREIFSWALD, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Pomerania, on\r\nthe navigable Ryk, 3 m. from its mouth on the Baltic at the little port\r\nof Wyk, and 20 m. S.E. from Stralsund by rail. Pop. (1875) 18,022,\r\n(1905) 23,750. It has wide and regular streets, flanked by numerous\r\ngabled houses, and is surrounded by pleasant promenades on the site of\r\nits old ramparts. The three Gothic Protestant churches, the\r\nMarienkirche, the Nikolaikirche and the Jakobikirche, and the town-hall\r\n(Rathaus) are the principal edifices, and these with their lofty spires\r\nare very picturesque. There is a statue of the emperor Frederick III.\r\nand a war memorial in the town. The industries mainly consist in\r\nshipbuilding, fish-curing, and the manufacture of machinery\r\n(particularly for agriculture), and the commerce in the export of corn,\r\nwood and fish. There is a theatre, an orphanage and a municipal library.\r\nGreifswald is, however, best known to fame by reason of its university.\r\nThis, founded in 1456, is well endowed and is largely frequented by\r\nstudents of medicine. Connected with it are a library of 150,000 volumes\r\nand 800 MSS., a chemical laboratory, a zoological museum, a\r\ngynaecological institute, an ophthalmological school, a botanical garden\r\nand at Eldena (a seaside resort on the Baltic) an agricultural school.\r\nIn front of the university, which had 775 students and about 100\r\nteachers in 1904, stands a monument commemorating its four hundredth\r\nanniversary.\r\n\r\nGreifswald was founded about 1240 by traders from the Netherlands. In\r\n1250 it received a town constitution and Lubeck rights from Duke\r\nWratislaw of Pomerania. In 1270 it joined the Hanse towns, Stralsund,\r\nRostock, Wismar and Lubeck, and took part in the wars which they carried\r\non against the kings of Denmark and Norway. During the Thirty Years' War\r\nit was formed into a fortress by the imperialists, but they vacated it\r\nin 1631 to the Swedes, in whose possession it remained after the peace\r\nof Westphalia. In 1678 it was captured by the elector of Brandenburg,\r\nbut was restored to the Swedes in the following year; in 1713 it was\r\ndesolated by the Russians; in 1715 it came into the possession of\r\nDenmark; and in 1721 it was again restored to Sweden, under whose\r\nprotection it remained till 1815, when, along with the whole of Swedish\r\nPomerania, it came into the possession of Prussia.\r\n\r\n  See J. G. L. Kosegarten, _Geschichte der Universitat Greifswald_\r\n  (1856); C. Gesterding, _Beitrag zur Geschichte der Stadt Greifswald_\r\n  (3 vols., 1827-1829); and I. Ziegler, _Geschichte der Stadt\r\n  Greifswald_ (Greifswald, 1897).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREISEN (in French, _hyalomicte_), a modification of granite, consisting\r\nessentially of quartz and white mica, and distinguished from granite by\r\nthe absence of felspar and biotite. In the hand specimen the rock has a\r\nsilvery glittering appearance from the abundance of lamellar crystals of\r\nmuscovite, but many greisens have much of the appearance of granite,\r\nexcept that they are paler in colour. The commonest accessory minerals\r\nare tourmaline, topaz, apatite, fluorspar and iron oxides; a little\r\nfelspar more or less altered may also be present and a brown mica which\r\nis biotite or lithionite. The tourmaline in section is brown, green,\r\nblue or colourless, and often the same crystal shows many different\r\ntints. The white mica forms mostly large plates with imperfect\r\ncrystalline outlines. The quartz is rich in fluid enclosures. Apatite\r\nand topaz are both colourless and of irregular form. Felspar if present\r\nmay be orthoclase and oligoclase.\r\n\r\nGreisen occurs typically in belts or veins intersecting granite. At the\r\ncentre of each vein there is usually a fissure which may be open or\r\nfilled with quartz. The greisen bands are from 1 in. up to 2 ft. or more\r\nin thickness. At their outer edges they pass gradually into the granite,\r\nfor they contain felspar crystals more or less completely altered into\r\naggregates of white mica and quartz. The transition between the two\r\nrocks is perfectly gradual, a fact which shows that the greisen has been\r\nproduced by alteration of the granite. Vapours or fluids rising through\r\nthe fissure have been the agents which effected the transmutation. They\r\nmust have contained fluorine, boron and probably also lithium, for\r\ntopaz, mica and tourmaline, the new minerals of the granite, contain\r\nthese elements. The change is a post-volcanic or pneumatolytic one\r\ninduced by the vapours set free by the granite magma when it cools.\r\nProbably the rock was at a relatively high temperature at the time. A\r\nsimilar type of alteration, the development of white mica, quartz and\r\ntourmaline, is found sometimes in sedimentary rocks around granite\r\nmasses. Greisen is closely connected with schorl rock both in its\r\nmineralogical composition and in its mode of origin. The latter is a\r\npneumatolytic product consisting of quartz and tourmaline; it often\r\ncontains white mica and thus passes by all stages into greisen. Both of\r\nthese rocks carry frequently small percentages of tin oxide\r\n(cassiterite) and may be worked as ores of tin. They are common in\r\nCornwall, Saxony, Tasmania and other districts which are centres of\r\ntin-mining. Many other greisens occur in which no tin is found. The\r\nanalyses show the composition of Cornish granite and greisen.

F.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREIZ, a town of Germany, capital of the principality of Reuss-Greiz\r\n(Reuss the Elder), in a pleasant valley on the right bank of the White\r\nElster, near the borders of Saxony, and 66 m. by rail S. from Leipzig.\r\nPop. (1875) 12,657; (1905) 23,114. It consists of two parts, the old\r\ntown on the right bank and the new town on the left bank of the river;\r\nit is rapidly growing and is regularly laid out. The principal buildings\r\nare the palace of the prince of Reuss-Greiz, surrounded by a fine park,\r\nthe old chateau on a rocky hill overlooking the town, the summer palace\r\nwith a fine garden, the old town church dating from 1225 and possessing\r\na beautiful tower, the town hall, the governmental buildings and statues\r\nof the emperor William I. and of Bismarck. There are classical and\r\nmodern schools and a school of textile industry. The industries are\r\nconsiderable, and include dyeing, tanning and the manufacture of\r\nwoollen, cotton, shawls, coverlets and paper. Greiz (formerly _Grewcz_)\r\nis apparently a town of Slav origin. From the 12th century it was\r\ngoverned by _advocati_ (_Vogte_), but in 1236 it came into the\r\npossession of Gera, and in 1550 of the younger line of the house of\r\nPlauen. It was wholly destroyed by fire in 1494, and almost totally in\r\n1802.\r\n\r\n  See Wilke, _Greiz und seine Umgebung_ (1875), and _Jahresberichte des\r\n  Vereins fur Greizer Geschichte_ (1894, seq.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRENADA, the southernmost of the Windward Islands, British West Indies.\r\nIt lies between 11 deg. 58' and 12 deg. 15' N. and between 61 deg. 35'\r\nand 61 deg. 50' W., being 140 m. S.W. of Barbados and 85 m. N. by W. of\r\nTrinidad. In shape oval, it is 21 m. long, 12 m. broad at its maximum\r\nand has an area of 133 sq. m. It owes much of its beauty to a\r\nwell-wooded range of mountains traversing the island from N. to S. and\r\nthrowing off from the centre spurs which form picturesque and fertile\r\nvalleys. These mountains attain their highest elevation in Mount\r\nCatharine (2750 ft.). In the S.E. and N.W. there are stretches of low or\r\nundulating ground, devoted to fruit growing and cattle raising. The\r\nisland is of volcanic origin; the only signs of upheaval are raised\r\nlimestone beaches in the extreme N. Red and grey sandstones, hornblende\r\nand argillaceous schist are found in the mountains, porphyry and\r\nbasaltic rocks also occur; sulphur and fuller's earth are worked. In the\r\ncentre, at the height of 1740 ft. above the sea, is the chief natural\r\ncuriosity of Grenada, the Grand Etang, a circular lake, 13 acres in\r\nextent, occupying the site of an ancient crater. Near it is a large\r\nsanatorium, much frequented as a health resort. In the north-east is a\r\nlarger lake, Lake Antoine, also occupying a crater, but it lies almost\r\nat the sea level. The island is watered by several short rivers, mainly\r\non the east and south; there are numerous fresh water springs, as well\r\nas hot chalybeate and sulphurous springs. The south-eastern coast is\r\nmuch indented with bays. The climate is good, the temperature equable\r\nand epidemic diseases are rare. In the low country the average yearly\r\ntemperature is 82 deg. F., but it is cooler in the heights. The rainfall\r\nis very heavy, amounting in some parts to as much as 200 in., a year.\r\nThe rainy season lasts from May to December, but refreshing showers\r\nfrequently occur during other parts of the year. The average annual\r\nrainfall at St Georges is 79.07 in., and at Grand Etang 164 in. The\r\nexcellent climate and good sea-bathing have made Grenada the health\r\nresort of the neighbouring islands, especially of Trinidad. Good roads\r\nand byeways intersect it in every direction. The soil is extraordinarily\r\nfertile, the chief products being cocoa and spices, especially nutmegs.\r\nThe exports, sent chiefly to Great Britain, are cocoa, spices, wool,\r\ncotton, coffee, live stock, hides, turtles, turtle shell, kola nuts,\r\nvanilla and timber. Barbados is dependent on Grenada for the majority of\r\nits firewood. Sugar is still grown, and rum and molasses are made, but\r\nthe consumption of these is confined to the island.\r\n\r\nElementary education is chiefly in the hands of the various\r\ndenominations, whose schools are assisted by government grants-in-aid.\r\nThere are, however, a few secular schools conducted by the government,\r\nand government-aided secondary schools for girls and a grammar school\r\nfor boys. The schools are controlled by a board of education, the\r\nmembers of which are nominated by the government, and small fees are\r\ncharged in all schools. The governor of the Windward Islands resides in\r\nGrenada and is administrator of it. The Legislative Council consists of\r\n14 members; 7 including the governor are _ex-officio_ members and the\r\nrest are nominated by the Crown. English is universally spoken, but the\r\nnegroes use a French _patois_, which, however, is gradually dying out.\r\nOnly 2% of the inhabitants are white, the rest being negroes and\r\nmulattoes with a few East Indians. The capital, St George, in the\r\nsouth-west, is built upon a lava peninsula jutting into the sea and\r\nforming one side of its land-locked harbour. It is surrounded by an\r\namphitheatre of hills, up the sides of which climb the red-brick houses\r\nof the town. At the extremity of the peninsula is Fort St George, with a\r\nsaluting battery. The ridge connecting Fort St George with Hospital Hill\r\nis tunnelled to give access to the two parts of the town lying on either\r\nside. The population in 1901 was 5198. There are four other towns--on\r\nthe west coast Gouyave, or Charlotte Town, and 4 m. N. of it Victoria;\r\non the north coast Sauteurs; and Grenville at the head of a wide bay on\r\nthe east. They are all in frequent communication with the capital by\r\nsteamer. The population of the entire colony in 1901 was 63,438.\r\n\r\n_History._--Grenada was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, who named it\r\nConception. Neither the Spanish nor the British, to whom it was granted\r\nin 1627, settled on the island. The governor of Martinique, du Parquet,\r\npurchased it in 1650, and the French were well received by the Caribs,\r\nwhom they afterwards extirpated with the greatest cruelty. In 1665\r\nGrenada passed into the hands of the French West India Company, and was\r\nadministered by it until its dissolution in 1674, when the island passed\r\nto the French Crown. Cocoa, coffee and cotton were introduced in 1714.\r\nDuring the wars between Great Britain and France, Grenada capitulated to\r\nthe British forces in 1762, and was formally ceded next year by the\r\nTreaty of Paris. The French, under Count d'Estaing, re-captured the\r\nisland in 1779, but it was restored to Great Britain by the Treaty of\r\nVersailles in 1783. A rebellion against the British rule, instigated and\r\nassisted by the French, occurred in 1795, but was quelled by Sir Ralph\r\nAbercromby in the following year. The emancipation of the slaves took\r\nplace in 1837, and by 1877 it was found necessary to introduce East\r\nIndian labour. Grenada, with cocoa as its staple, has not experienced\r\nsimilar depression to that which overtook the sugar-growing islands of\r\nthe West Indies.\r\n\r\n  See _Grenada Handbook_ (London, 1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRENADE (from the French word for a pomegranate, from a resemblance in\r\nshape to that fruit), a small spherical explosive vessel thrown by hand.\r\nHand-grenades were used in war in the 16th century, but the word\r\n\"grenade\" was also from the first used to imply an explosive shell\r\nfired from a gun; this survives to the present day in the German\r\n_Granate_. These weapons were employed after about 1660, by special\r\ntroops called \"grenadiers\" (q.v.), and in the wars of the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies they are continually met with. They became obsolete in the\r\n19th century, but were given a new lease of life in the 20th, owing to\r\ntheir employment in the siege of Port Arthur in 1904, where\r\nhand-grenades of a modern type, and containing powerful modern\r\nexplosives, proved very effective (see AMMUNITION, _shell_).\r\nHand-grenades filled with chemicals and made of glass are used as a\r\nmethod of fire-extinction, and similar vessels containing a liquid with\r\na very strong smell are used to discover defects in a drain or sewer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRENADIER, originally a soldier whose special duty it was to throw\r\nhand-grenades. The latter were in use for a considerable time before any\r\nspecial organization was given to the troops who were to use them. In\r\n1667 four men per company in the French _Regiment du Roi_ were trained\r\nwith grenades (siege of Lille), and in 1668-1670 grenadier companies\r\nwere formed in this regiment and in about thirty others of the French\r\nline. Evelyn, in his _Diary_, tells us that on the 29th of June 1678 he\r\nsaw at Hounslow \"a new sort of soldiers called granadiers, who were\r\ndexterous in flinging hand-granades.\" As in the case of the fusiliers,\r\nthe French practice was therefore quickly copied in England. Eventually\r\neach English battalion had a grenadier company (see for illustrations\r\n_Archaeological Journal_, xxiii. 222, and xlvii. 321-324). Besides their\r\ngrenades and the firelock, grenadiers carried axes which, with the\r\ngrenades, were employed in the assault of fortresses, as we are told in\r\nthe celebrated song, \"The British Grenadiers.\"\r\n\r\nThe grenadier companies were formed always of the most powerful men in\r\nthe regiment and, when the grenade ceased to be used, they maintained\r\ntheir existence as the \"crack\" companies of their battalions, taking the\r\nright of the line on parade and wearing the distinctive grenadier\r\nheaddress. This system was almost universal, and the typical infantry\r\nregiment of the 18th and early 19th century had a grenadier and a light\r\ncompany besides its \"line\" companies. In the British and other armies\r\nthese _elite_ companies were frequently taken from their regiments and\r\ncombined in grenadier and light infantry battalions for special service,\r\nand Napoleon carried this practice still further in the French army by\r\norganizing brigades and divisions of grenadiers (and correspondingly of\r\n_voltigeurs_). Indeed the companies thus detached from the line\r\npractically never returned to it, and this was attended with serious\r\nevils, for the battalion at the outbreak of war lost perhaps a quarter\r\nof its best men, the average men only remaining with the line. This\r\nspecial organization of grenadiers and light companies lasted in the\r\nBritish army until about 1858. In the Prussian service the grenadiers\r\nbecame permanent and independent battalions about 1740, and the gradual\r\nadoption of the four-company battalion by Prussia and other nations\r\ntended still further to place the grenadiers by themselves and apart\r\nfrom the line. Thus at the present day in Germany, Russia and other\r\ncountries, the title of \"grenadiers\" is borne by line regiments,\r\nindistinguishable, except for details of uniform and often the _esprit\r\nde corps_ inherited from the old _elite_ companies, from the rest. In\r\nthe British service the only grenadiers remaining are the Grenadier\r\nGuards, originally the 1st regiment of Foot Guards, which was formed in\r\n1660 on the nucleus of a regiment of English royalists which followed\r\nthe fortunes of Charles II. in exile. In Russia a whole army corps\r\n(headquarters Moscow), inclusive of its artillery units, bears the\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\nThe special headdress of the grenadier was a pointed cap, with peak and\r\nflaps, of embroidered cloth, or a loose fur cap of similar shape; both\r\nthese were light field service caps. The fur cap has in the course of\r\ntime developed into the tall \"bearskin\" worn by British guards and\r\nvarious corps of other armies; the embroidered field cap survives,\r\ntransformed, however, into a heavy brass headdress, in the uniform of\r\nthe 1st Prussian Foot Guards, the 1st Prussian Guard Grenadiers and the\r\nRussian Paul (Pavlovsky) Grenadier Guards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRENADINES, a chain of islets in the Windward Islands, West Indies. They\r\nstretch for 60 m. between St Vincent and Grenada, following a N.E. to\r\nS.W. direction, and consist of some 600 islets and rocks. Some are a few\r\nsquare miles in extent, others are merely rocky cones projecting from\r\nthe deep. For purposes of administration they are divided between St\r\nVincent and Grenada. Bequia, the chief island in the St Vincent group,\r\nis long and narrow, with an area 6 sq. m. Owing to a lack of water it is\r\nonly slightly cultivated, but game is plentiful. Admiralty Bay, on the\r\nW. side, is a safe and commodious harbour. Carriacou, belonging to\r\nGrenada, is the largest of the group, being 7 m. long, 2 m. wide and 13\r\nsq. m. in extent. A ridge of hills, rising to an altitude of 700 ft.,\r\ntraverses the centre from N.E. to S.W.; here admirable building stone is\r\nfound. There are two good harbours on the west coast, Hillsborough Bay\r\non which stands Hillsborough, the chief town, and Tyrell Bay, farther\r\nsouth. The island is thickly populated, the negro peasantry occupying\r\nsmall lots and working on the _metayer_ system. Excellent oysters are\r\nfound along the coast, and cotton and cattle are the chief exports. Pop.\r\nof the group, mostly on Carriacou (1901) 6497.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRENOBLE, the ancient capital of the Dauphine in S.E. France, and now\r\nthe chief town of the Isere department, 75 m. by rail from Lyons, 38-1/2\r\nm. from Chambery and 85-1/2 m. from Gap. Pop. (1906), town, 58,641;\r\ncommune, 73,022. It is one of the most beautifully situated, and also\r\none of the most strongly fortified, cities in Europe. Built at a height\r\nof 702 ft. on both banks of the river Isere just above its junction with\r\nthe Drac, the town occupies a considerable plain at the south-western\r\nend of the fertile Graisivaudan valley. To the north rise the mountains\r\nof the Grande Chartreuse, to the east the range of Belledonne, and to\r\nthe south those of Taillefer and the Moucherotte, the higher summits of\r\nthese ranges being partly covered with snow. From the Jardin de Ville\r\nand the quays of the banks of the Isere the summit of Mont Blanc itself\r\nis visible. The greater part of the town rises on the left bank of the\r\nIsere, which is bordered by broad quays. The older portion has the\r\ntortuous and narrow streets usual in towns that have been confined\r\nwithin fortifications, but in modern times these hindrances have been\r\ndemolished. The newer portion of the town has wide thoroughfares and\r\nbuildings of the modern French type, solid but not picturesque. The\r\noriginal town (of but small extent) was built on the right bank of the\r\nIsere at the southern foot of the Mont Rachais, now covered by a\r\nsuccession of fortresses that rise picturesquely on the slope of that\r\nhill to a very considerable height (885 ft. above the town).\r\n\r\nGrenoble is the seat of a bishopric which was founded in the 4th\r\ncentury, and now comprises the department of the Isere--formerly a\r\nsuffragan of Vienne it now forms part of the ecclesiastical province of\r\nLyons. The most remarkable building in the town is the Palais de\r\nJustice, erected (late 15th century to 16th century) on the site of the\r\nold palace of the Parlement of the Dauphine. Opposite is the most\r\nnoteworthy church of the city, that of St Andre (13th century), formerly\r\nthe chapel of the dauphins of the Viennois: in it is the 17th century\r\nmonument of Bayard (1476-1524), the _chevalier sans peur et sans\r\nreproche_, which was removed hither in 1822; but it is uncertain whose\r\nbones are therein. The cathedral church of Notre Dame is a heavy\r\nbuilding, dating in part from the 11th century. The church of St\r\nLaurent, on the right bank of the Isere, is the oldest in the city (11th\r\ncentury) and has a remarkable crypt, dating from Merovingian times. The\r\ntown hall is a mainly modern building, constructed on the site of the\r\npalace of the dauphins, while the prefecture is entirely modern. The\r\ntown library contains a considerable collection of paintings, mainly of\r\nthe modern French school, but is more remarkable for its very rich\r\ncollection of MSS. (7000) and printed books (250,000 vols.) which in\r\ngreat part belonged till 1793 to the monastery of the Grande Chartreuse.\r\nThe natural history museum houses rich collections of various kinds,\r\nwhich contain (_inter alia_) numerous geological specimens from the\r\nneighbouring districts of the Dauphine and Savoy. The university,\r\nrevived in modern times after a long abeyance, occupies a modern\r\nbuilding, as does also the hospital, though founded as far back as the\r\n15th century. There are numerous societies in the town, including the\r\nAcademie Delphinale (founded in 1772), and many charitable institutions.\r\n\r\nThe staple industry of Grenoble is the manufacture of kid gloves, most\r\nof the so-called _gants Jouvin_ being made here--they are named after\r\nthe reviver of the art, X. Jouvin (1800-1844). There are about 80 glove\r\nfactories, which employ 18,500 persons (of whom 15,000 are women), the\r\nannual output being about 800,000 dozen pairs of gloves. Among other\r\narticles produced at Grenoble are artificial cements, liqueurs, straw\r\nhats and carved furniture.\r\n\r\nGrenoble occupies the site of Cularo, a village of the Allobroges, which\r\nonly became of importance when fortified by Diocletian and Maximian at\r\nthe end of the 3rd century. Its present name is a corruption of\r\nGratianopolis, a title assumed probably in honour of Gratian (4th\r\ncentury), who raised it to the rank of a _civitas_. After passing under\r\nthe power of the Burgundians (c. 440) and the Franks (532) it became\r\npart of the kingdom of Provence (879-1032). On the break-up of that\r\nkingdom a long struggle for supremacy ensued between the bishops of the\r\ncity and the counts of Albon, the latter finally winning the day in the\r\n12th century, and taking the title of Dauphins of the Viennois in the\r\n13th century. In 1349 Grenoble was ceded with the rest of the Dauphine\r\nto France, but retained various municipal privileges which had been\r\ngranted by the dauphins to the town, originally by a charter of 1242. In\r\n1562 it was sacked by the Protestants under the baron des Adrets, but in\r\n1572 the firmness of its governor, Bertrand de Gordes, saved it from a\r\nrepetition of the Massacre of St Bartholomew. In 1590 Lesdiguieres\r\n(1543-1626) took the town in the name of Henry IV., then still a\r\nProtestant, and during his long governorship (which lasted to his death)\r\ndid much for it by the construction of fortifications, quays, &c. In\r\n1788 the attempt of the king to weaken the power of the parlement of\r\nGrenoble (which, though strictly a judicial authority, had preserved\r\ntraditions of independence, since the suspension of the states-general\r\nof the Dauphine in 1628) roused the people to arms, and the \"day of the\r\ntiles\" (7th of June 1788) is memorable for the defeat of the royal\r\nforces. In 1790, on the formation of the department of the Isere,\r\nGrenoble became its capital. Grenoble was the first important town to\r\nopen its gates to Napoleon on his return from Elba (7th of March 1815),\r\nbut a few months later (July) it was obliged to surrender to the\r\nAustrian army. Owing to its situation Grenoble was formerly much subject\r\nto floods, particularly in the case of the wild Drac. One of the worst\r\ntook place in 1219, while that of 1778 was known as the _deluge de la\r\nSaint Crepin_. Among the celebrities who have been born at Grenoble are\r\nVaucanson (1709-1782), Mably (1709-1785), Condillac (1715-1780), Beyle,\r\nbest known as Stendhal, his _nom de guerre_ (1783-1842), Barnave\r\n(1761-1793) and Casimir Perier (1777-1832).\r\n\r\n  See A. Prudhomme, _Histoire de Grenoble_ (1888); X. Roux, _La\r\n  Corporation des gantiers de Grenoble_ (1887); H. Duhamel, _Grenoble\r\n  considere comme centre d'excursions_ (1902); J. Marion, _Cartulaires\r\n  de l'eglise cathedrale de Grenoble_ (Paris, 1869).     (W. A. B. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRENVILLE, SIR BEVIL (1596-1643), Royalist soldier in the English Civil\r\nWar (see GREAT REBELLION), was educated at Exeter College, Oxford. As\r\nmember of Parliament, first for Cornwall, then for Launceston, Grenville\r\nsupported Sir John Eliot and the opposition, and his intimacy with Eliot\r\nwas life-long. In 1639, however, he appears as a royalist going to the\r\nScottish War in the train of Charles I. The reasons of this change of\r\nfront are unknown, but Grenville's honour was above suspicion, and he\r\nmust have entirely convinced himself that he was doing right. At any\r\nrate he was a very valuable recruit to the royalist cause, being \"the\r\nmost generally loved man in Cornwall.\" At the outbreak of the Civil War\r\nhe and others of the gentry not only proclaimed the king's Commission of\r\nArray at Launceston assizes, but also persuaded the grand jury of the\r\ncounty to declare their opponents guilty of riot and unlawful assembly,\r\nwhereupon the _Posse comitatus_ was called out to expel them. Under the\r\ncommand of Sir Ralph Hopton, Sir Bevil took a distinguished part in the\r\naction of Bradock Down, and at Stratton (16 May 1643), where the\r\nparliamentary earl of Stamford was completely routed by the Cornishmen,\r\nled one of the storming parties which captured Chudleigh's lines\r\n(_Clarendon_, vii. 89). A month later, the endeavour of Hopton to unite\r\nwith Maurice and Hertford from Oxford brought on the battle of Lansdown,\r\nnear Bath. Here Grenville was killed at the head of the Cornish infantry\r\nas it reached the top of the hill. His death was a blow from which the\r\nking's cause in the West never recovered, for he alone knew how to\r\nhandle the Cornishmen. Hopton they revered and respected, but Grenville\r\nthey loved as peculiarly their own commander, and after his death there\r\nis little more heard of the reckless valour which had won Stratton and\r\nLansdown. Grenville is the type of all that was best in English\r\nroyalism. He was neither rapacious, drunken nor dissolute, but his\r\nloyalty was unselfish, his life pure and his skill no less than his\r\nbravery unquestionable. A monument to him has been erected on the field\r\nof Lansdown.\r\n\r\n  See Lloyd, _Memoirs of Excellent Personages_ (1668); S. R. Gardiner,\r\n  _History of the English Civil War_ (vol. i. _passim_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRENVILLE, GEORGE (1712-1770), English statesman, second son of Richard\r\nGrenville and Hester Temple, afterwards Countess Temple, was born on the\r\n14th of October 1712. He was educated at Eton and at Christ Church,\r\nOxford, and was called to the bar in 1735. He entered parliament in 1741\r\nas member for Buckingham, and continued to represent that borough till\r\nhis death. In parliament he was a member of the \"Boy Patriot\" party\r\nwhich opposed Sir Robert Walpole. In December 1744 he became a lord of\r\nthe admiralty in the Pelham administration. He allied himself with his\r\nbrother Richard and with William Pitt in forcing their feeble chief to\r\ngive them promotion by rebelling against his authority and obstructing\r\nbusiness. In June 1747 he became a lord of the treasury, and in 1754\r\ntreasurer of the navy and privy councillor. As treasurer of the navy in\r\n1758 he introduced and carried a bill which established a less unfair\r\nsystem of paying the wages of the seamen than had existed before. He\r\nremained in office in 1761, when his brother Lord Temple and his\r\nbrother-in-law Pitt resigned upon the question of the war with Spain,\r\nand in the administration of Lord Bute he was entrusted with the\r\nleadership of the House of Commons. In May 1762 he was appointed\r\nsecretary of state, and in October first lord of the admiralty; and in\r\nApril 1763 he became first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the\r\nexchequer. The most prominent measures of his administration were the\r\nprosecution of Wilkes and the passing of the American Stamp Act, which\r\nled to the first symptoms of alienation between America and the mother\r\ncountry. During the latter period of his term of office he was on a very\r\nunsatisfactory footing with the young king George III., who gradually\r\ncame to feel a kind of horror of the interminable persistency of his\r\nconversation, and whom he endeavoured to make use of as the mere puppet\r\nof the ministry. The king made various attempts to induce Pitt to come\r\nto his rescue by forming a ministry, but without success, and at last\r\nhad recourse to the marquis of Rockingham, on whose agreeing to accept\r\noffice Grenville was dismissed July 1765. He never again held office,\r\nand died on the 13th of November 1770.\r\n\r\nThe nickname of \"gentle shepherd\" was given him because he bored the\r\nHouse by asking over and over again, during the debate on the Cider Bill\r\nof 1763, that somebody should tell him \"where\" to lay the new tax if it\r\nwas not to be put on cider. Pitt whistled the air of the popular tune\r\n\"Gentle Shepherd, tell me where,\" and the House laughed. Though few\r\nexcelled him in a knowledge of the forms of the House or in mastery of\r\nadministrative details, his tact in dealing with men and with affairs\r\nwas so defective that there is perhaps no one who has been at the head\r\nof an English administration to whom a lower place can be assigned as a\r\nstatesman.\r\n\r\nIn 1749 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Wyndham, by whom\r\nhe had a large family. His son, the second Earl Temple, was created\r\nmarquess, and his grandson duke, of Buckingham. Another son was William,\r\nafterwards Lord Grenville. Another, Thomas Grenville (1755-1846), who\r\nwas, with one interval, a member of parliament from 1780 to 1818, and\r\nfor a few months during 1806 and 1807 president of the board of control\r\nand first lord of the admiralty, is perhaps more famous as a\r\nbook-collector than as a statesman; he bequeathed his large and valuable\r\nlibrary to the British Museum.\r\n\r\n  _The Grenville Papers, being the Correspondence of Richard Grenville,\r\n  Earl Temple, K.G., and the Right Hon. George Grenville, their Friends\r\n  and Contemporaries_, were published at London in 1852, and afford the\r\n  chief authority for his life. But see also H. Walpole's _Memoirs of\r\n  the Reign of George II._ (London, 1845); Lord Stanhope's _History of\r\n  England_ (London, 1858); Lecky's _History of England_ (1885); and E.\r\n  D. Adams, _The Influence of Grenville on Pitt's Foreign Policy_\r\n  (Washington, 1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRENVILLE (or GREYNVILE), SIR RICHARD (c. 1541-1591), British naval\r\ncommander, was born of an old Cornish family about 1541. His\r\ngrandfather, Sir Richard, had been marshal of Calais in the time of\r\nHenry VIII., and his father commanded and was lost in the \"Mary Rose\" in\r\n1545. At an early age Grenville is supposed to have served in Hungary\r\nunder the emperor Maximilian against the Turks. In the years 1571 and\r\n1584 he sat in parliament for Cornwall, and in 1583 and 1584 he was\r\ncommissioner of the works at Dover harbour. He appears to have been a\r\nman of much pride and ambition. Of his bravery there can be no doubt. In\r\n1585 he commanded the fleet of seven vessels by which the colonists sent\r\nout by his cousin, Sir Walter Raleigh, were carried to Roanoke Island in\r\nthe present North Carolina. Grenville himself soon returned with the\r\nfleet to England, capturing a Spanish vessel on his way, but in 1586 he\r\ncarried provisions to Roanoke, and finding the colony deserted, left a\r\nfew men to maintain possession. He then held an important post in charge\r\nof the defences of the western counties of England. When a squadron was\r\ndespatched in 1591, under Lord Thomas Howard, to intercept the\r\nhomeward-bound treasure-fleet of Spain, Grenville was appointed as\r\nsecond in command on board the \"Revenge,\" a ship of 500 tons which had\r\nbeen commanded by Drake against the Armada in 1588. At the end of August\r\nHoward with 16 ships lay at anchor to the north of Flores in the Azores.\r\nOn the last day of the month he received news from a pinnace, sent by\r\nthe earl of Cumberland, who was then off the Portugal coast, that a\r\nSpanish fleet of 53 vessels was then bearing up to the Azores to meet\r\nthe treasure-ships. Not being in a position to fight a fleet more than\r\nthree times the size of his own, Howard gave orders to weigh anchor and\r\nstand out to sea. But, either from some misunderstanding of the order,\r\nor from some idea of Grenville's that the Spanish vessels rapidly\r\napproaching were the ships for which they had been waiting, the\r\n\"Revenge\" was delayed and cut off from her consorts by the Spaniards.\r\nGrenville resolved to try to break through the middle of the Spanish\r\nline. His ship was becalmed under the lee of a huge galleon, and after a\r\nhand-to-hand fight lasting through fifteen hours against fifteen Spanish\r\nships and a force of five thousand men, the \"Revenge\" with her hundred\r\nand fifty men was captured. Grenville himself was carried on board the\r\nSpanish flag-ship \"San Pablo,\" and died a few days later. The incident\r\nis commemorated in Tennyson's ballad of \"The Revenge.\"\r\n\r\nThe spelling of Sir Richard's name has led to much controversy. Four\r\ndifferent families, each of which claim to be descended from him, spell\r\nit Granville, Grenville, Grenfell and Greenfield. The spelling usually\r\naccepted is Grenville, but his own signature, in a bold clear\r\nhandwriting, among the Tanner MSS. in the Bodleian library at Oxford, is\r\nGreynvile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRENVILLE (or GRANVILLE), SIR RICHARD (1600-1658), English royalist, was\r\nthe third son of Sir Bernard Grenville (1559-1636), and a grandson of\r\nthe famous seaman, Sir Richard Grenville. Having served in France,\r\nGermany and the Netherlands, Grenville gained the favour of the duke of\r\nBuckingham, took part in the expeditions to Cadiz, to the island of Rhe\r\nand to La Rochelle, was knighted, and in 1628 was chosen member of\r\nparliament for Fowey. Having married Mary Fitz (1596-1671), widow of Sir\r\nCharles Howard (d. 1622) and a lady of fortune, Grenville was made a\r\nbaronet in 1630; his violent temper, however, made the marriage an\r\nunhappy one, and he was ruined and imprisoned as the result of two\r\nlawsuits, one with his wife, and the other with her kinsman, the earl of\r\nSuffolk. In 1633 he escaped from prison and went to Germany, returning\r\nto England six years later to join the army which Charles I. was\r\ncollecting to march against the Scots. Early in 1641, just after the\r\noutbreak of the Irish rebellion, Sir Richard led some troops to Ireland,\r\nwhere he won some fame and became governor of Trim; then returning to\r\nEngland in 1643 he was arrested at Liverpool by an officer of the\r\nparliament, but was soon released and sent to join the parliamentary\r\narmy. Having, however, secured men and money, he hurried to Charles I.\r\nat Oxford and was despatched to take part in the siege of Plymouth,\r\nquickly becoming the leader of the forces engaged in this enterprise.\r\nCompelled to raise the siege he retired into Cornwall, where he helped\r\nto resist the advancing Parliamentarians; but he quickly showed signs of\r\ninsubordination, and, whilst sharing in the siege of Taunton, he was\r\nwounded and obliged to resign his command. About this time loud\r\ncomplaints were brought against Grenville. He had behaved, it was said,\r\nin a very arbitrary fashion; he had hanged some men and imprisoned\r\nothers; he had extorted money and had used the contributions towards the\r\ncost of the war for his own ends. Many of these charges were undoubtedly\r\ntrue, but upon his recovery the councillors of the prince of Wales gave\r\nhim a position under Lord Goring, whom, however, he refused to obey.\r\nEqually recalcitrant was his attitude towards Goring's successor, Sir\r\nRalph Hopton, and in January 1646 he was arrested. But he was soon\r\nreleased; he went to France and Italy, and after visiting England in\r\ndisguise passed some time in Holland. He was excepted by parliament from\r\npardon in 1648, and after the king's execution he was with Charles II.\r\nin France and elsewhere until some unfounded accusation which he brought\r\nagainst Edward Hyde, afterwards earl of Clarendon, led to his removal\r\nfrom court. He died in 1658, and was buried at Ghent. In 1644, when\r\nGrenville deserted the parliamentary party, a proclamation was put out\r\nagainst him; in this there were attached to his name several offensive\r\nepithets, among them being _skellum_, a word probably derived from the\r\nGerman _Schelm_, a scoundrel. Hence he is often called \"skellum\r\nGrenville.\"\r\n\r\n  Grenville wrote an account of affairs in the west of England, which\r\n  was printed in T. Carte's _Original Letters_ (1739). To this partisan\r\n  account Clarendon drew up an answer, the bulk of which he afterwards\r\n  incorporated in his _History_. In 1654 Grenville wrote his _Single\r\n  defence against all aspersions of all malignant persons_. This is\r\n  printed in the _Works_ of George Granville, Lord Lansdowne (London,\r\n  1736), where Lansdowne's _Vindication_ of his kinsman, Sir Richard,\r\n  against Clarendon's charges is also found. See also Clarendon,\r\n  _History of the Rebellion_, edited by W. D. Macray (Oxford, 1888); and\r\n  R. Granville, _The King's General in the West_ (1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRENVILLE, WILLIAM WYNDHAM GRENVILLE, BARON (1759-1834), English\r\nstatesman, youngest son of George Grenville, was born on the 25th of\r\nOctober 1759. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, gaining\r\nthe chancellor's prize for Latin verse in 1779. In February 1782\r\nGrenville was returned to parliament as member for the borough of\r\nBuckingham, and in the following September he became secretary to the\r\nlord lieutenant of Ireland, who at this time was his brother, Earl\r\nTemple, afterwards marquess of Buckingham. He left office in June 1783,\r\nbut in the following December he became paymaster-general of the forces\r\nunder his cousin, William Pitt, and in 1786 vice-president of the\r\ncommittee of trade. In 1787 he was sent on an important mission to the\r\nHague and Versailles with reference to the affairs of Holland. In\r\nJanuary 1789 he was chosen speaker of the House of Commons, but he\r\nvacated the chair in the same year on being appointed secretary of state\r\nfor the home department; about the same time he resigned his other\r\noffices, but he became president of the board of control, and in\r\nNovember 1790 was created a peer as Baron Grenville. In the House of\r\nLords he was very active in directing the business of the government,\r\nand in 1791 he was transferred to the foreign office, retaining his post\r\nat the board of control until 1793. He was doubtless regarded by Pitt as\r\nthe man best fitted to carry out his policy with reference to France,\r\nbut in the succeeding years he and his chief were frequently at variance\r\non important questions of foreign policy. In spite of his multifarious\r\nduties at the foreign office Grenville continued to take a lively\r\ninterest in domestic matters, which he showed by introducing various\r\nbills into the House of Lords. In February 1801 he resigned office with\r\nPitt because George III. would not consent to the introduction of any\r\nmeasure of Roman Catholic relief, and in opposition he gradually\r\nseparated himself from his former leader. When Pitt returned to power in\r\n1804 Grenville refused to join the ministry unless his political ally,\r\nFox, was also admitted thereto; this was impossible and he remained out\r\nof office until February 1806, when just after Pitt's death he became\r\nthe nominal head of a coalition government. This ministry was very\r\nunfortunate in its conduct of foreign affairs, but it deserves to be\r\nremembered with honour on account of the act passed in 1807 for the\r\nabolition of the slave trade. Its influence, however, was weakened by\r\nthe death of Fox, and in consequence of a minute drawn up by Grenville\r\nand some of his colleagues the king demanded from his ministers an\r\nassurance that in future they would not urge upon him any measures for\r\nthe relief of Roman Catholics. They refused to give this assurance and\r\nin March 1807 they resigned. Grenville's attitude in this matter was\r\nsomewhat aggressive; his colleagues were not unanimous in supporting\r\nhim, and Sheridan, one of them, said \"he had known many men knock their\r\nheads against a wall, but he had never before heard of any man who\r\ncollected the bricks and built the very wall with an intention to knock\r\nout his own brains against it.\"\r\n\r\nLord Grenville never held office again, although he was requested to do\r\nso on several occasions. He continued, however, to take part in public\r\nlife, being one of the chief supporters of Roman Catholic emancipation,\r\nand during the remaining years of his active political career, which\r\nended in 1823, he generally voted with the Whigs, although in 1815 he\r\nseparated himself from his colleague, Charles Grey, and supported the\r\nwarlike policy of Lord Liverpool. In 1819, when the marquess of\r\nLansdowne brought forward his motion for an inquiry into the causes of\r\nthe distress and discontent in the manufacturing districts, Grenville\r\ndelivered an alarmist speech advocating repressive measures. His\r\nconcluding years were spent at Dropmore, Buckinghamshire, where he died\r\non the 12th of January 1834. His wife, whom he married in 1792, was Anne\r\n(1772-1864), daughter of Thomas Pitt, 1st Baron Camelford, but he had no\r\nissue and his title became extinct. In 1809 he was elected chancellor of\r\nOxford university.\r\n\r\nThough Grenville's talents were not of the highest order his\r\nstraightforwardness and industry, together with his knowledge of\r\npolitics and the moderation of his opinions, secured for him\r\nconsiderable political influence. He may be enrolled among the band of\r\nEnglish statesmen who have distinguished themselves in literature. He\r\nedited Lord Chatham's letters to his nephew, Thomas Pitt, afterwards\r\nLord Camelford (London, 1804, and other editions); he wrote a small\r\nvolume, _Nugae Metricae_ (1824), being translations into Latin from\r\nEnglish, Greek and Italian, and an _Essay on the Supposed Advantages of\r\na Sinking Fund_ (1828).\r\n\r\n  The Dropmore MSS. contain much of Grenville's correspondence, and on\r\n  this the Historical Manuscripts Commission has published a report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRESHAM, SIR THOMAS (1519-1579), London merchant, the founder of the\r\nRoyal Exchange and of Gresham College, London, was descended from an old\r\nNorfolk family; he was the only son of Sir Richard Gresham, a leading\r\nLondon merchant, who for some time held the office of lord mayor, and\r\nfor his services as agent of Henry VIII. in negotiating loans with\r\nforeign merchants received the honour of knighthood. Though his father\r\nintended him to follow his own profession, he nevertheless sent him for\r\nsome time to Caius College, Cambridge, but there is no information as to\r\nthe duration of his residence. It is uncertain also whether it was\r\nbefore or after this that he was apprenticed to his uncle Sir John\r\nGresham, who was also a merchant, but we have his own testimony that he\r\nserved an apprenticeship of eight years. In 1543, at the age of\r\ntwenty-four, he was admitted a member of the Mercers' Company, and in\r\nthe same year he went to the Low Countries, where, either on his own\r\naccount or on that of his father or uncle, he both carried on business\r\nas a merchant and acted in various matters as an agent for Henry VIII.\r\nIn 1544 he married the widow of William Read, a London merchant, but he\r\nstill continued to reside principally in the Low Countries, having his\r\nheadquarters at Antwerp. When in 1551 the mismanagement of Sir William\r\nDansell, \"king's merchant\" in the Low Countries, had brought the English\r\ngovernment into great financial embarrassment, Gresham was called in to\r\ngive his advice, and chosen to carry out his own proposals. Their\r\nleading feature was the adoption of various methods--highly ingenious,\r\nbut quite arbitrary and unfair--for raising the value of the pound\r\nsterling on the \"bourse\" of Antwerp, and it was so successful that in a\r\nfew years nearly all King Edward's debts were discharged. The advice of\r\nGresham was likewise sought by the government in all their money\r\ndifficulties, and he was also frequently employed in various diplomatic\r\nmissions. He had no stated salary, but in reward of his services\r\nreceived from Edward various grants of lands, the annual value of which\r\nat that time was ultimately about L400 a year. On the accession of Mary\r\nhe was for a short time in disfavour, and was displaced in his post by\r\nAlderman William Dauntsey. But Dauntsey's financial operations were not\r\nvery successful and Gresham was soon reinstated; and as he professed his\r\nzealous desire to serve the queen, and manifested great adroitness both\r\nin negotiating loans and in smuggling money, arms and foreign goods, not\r\nonly were his services retained throughout her reign, but besides his\r\nsalary of twenty shillings _per diem_ he received grants of church lands\r\nto the yearly value of L200. Under Queen Elizabeth, besides continuing\r\nin his post as financial agent of the crown, he acted temporarily as\r\nambassador at the court of the duchess of Parma, being knighted in 1559\r\nprevious to his departure. By the outbreak of the war in the Low\r\nCountries he was compelled to leave Antwerp on the 19th of March 1567;\r\nbut, though he spent the remainder of his life in London, he continued\r\nhis business as merchant and financial agent of the government in much\r\nthe same way as formerly. Elizabeth also found him useful in a great\r\nvariety of other ways, among which was that of acting as jailer, to Lady\r\nMary Grey, who, as a punishment for marrying Thomas Keys the sergeant\r\nporter, remained a prisoner in his house from June 1569 to the end of\r\n1572. In 1565 Gresham made a proposal to the court of aldermen of London\r\nto build at his own expense a bourse or exchange, on condition that they\r\npurchased for this purpose a piece of suitable ground. In this proposal\r\nhe seems to have had an eye to his own interest as well as to the\r\ngeneral good of the merchants, for by a yearly rental of L700 obtained\r\nfor the shops in the upper part of the building he received a sufficient\r\nreturn for his trouble and expense. Gresham died suddenly, apparently of\r\napoplexy, on the 21st of November 1579. His only son predeceased him,\r\nand his illegitimate daughter Anne he married to Sir Nathaniel Bacon,\r\nbrother of the great Lord Bacon. With the exception of a number of small\r\nsums bequeathed to the support of various charities, the bulk of his\r\nproperty, consisting of estates in various parts of England of the\r\nannual value of more than L2300, was bequeathed to his widow and her\r\nheirs with the stipulation that after her decease his residence in\r\nBishopsgate Street, as well as the rents arising from the Royal\r\nExchange, should be vested in the hands of the corporation of London and\r\nthe Mercers' Company, for the purpose of instituting a college in which\r\nseven professors should read lectures--one each day of the week--on\r\nastronomy, geometry, physic, law, divinity, rhetoric and music. The\r\nlectures were begun in 1597, and were delivered in the original building\r\nuntil 1768, when, on the ground that the trustees were losers by the\r\ngift, it was made over to the crown for a yearly rent of L500, and\r\nconverted into an excise office. From that time a room in the Royal\r\nExchange was used for the lectures until in 1843 the present building\r\nwas erected at a cost of L7000.\r\n\r\n  A notice of Gresham is contained in Fuller's _Worthies_ and Ward's\r\n  _Gresham Professors_; but the fullest account of him, as well as of\r\n  the history of the Exchange and Gresham College is that by J. M.\r\n  Burgon in his _Life and Times of Sir Thomas Gresham_ (2 vols., 1839).\r\n  See also a _Brief Memoir of Sir Thomas Gresham_ (1833); and _The Life\r\n  of Sir Thomas Gresham, Founder of the Royal Exchange_ (1845).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRESHAM, WALTER QUINTON (1832-1895), American statesman and jurist, was\r\nborn near Lanesville, Harrison county, Indiana, on the 17th of March\r\n1832. He spent two years in an academy at Corydon, Indiana, and one year\r\nat the Indiana State University at Bloomington, then studied law, and in\r\n1854 was admitted to the bar. He was active as a campaign speaker for\r\nthe Republican ticket in 1856, and in 1860 was elected to the State\r\nHouse of Representatives as a Republican in a strong Democratic\r\ndistrict. In the House, as chairman of the committee on military\r\naffairs, he did much to prepare the Indiana troops for service in the\r\nFederal army; in 1861 he became colonel of the 53rd Indiana Volunteer\r\nInfantry, and subsequently took part in Grant's Tennessee campaign of\r\n1862, and in the operations against Corinth and Vicksburg, where he\r\ncommanded a brigade. In August 1863 he was appointed brigadier-general\r\nof volunteers, and was placed in command of the Federal forces at\r\nNatchez. In 1864 he commanded a division of the 17th Army Corps in\r\nSherman's Atlanta campaign, and before Atlanta, on the 20th of July, he\r\nreceived a wound which forced him to retire from active service, and\r\nleft him lame for life. In 1865 he was brevetted major-general of\r\nvolunteers. After the war he practised law at New Albany, Indiana, and\r\nin 1869 was appointed by President Grant United States District Judge\r\nfor Indiana. In April 1883 he succeeded Timothy O. Howe (1816-1883) as\r\npostmaster-general in President Arthur's cabinet, taking an active part\r\nin the suppression of the Louisiana Lottery, and in September 1884\r\nsucceeded Charles J. Folger as secretary of the treasury. In the\r\nfollowing month he resigned to accept an appointment as United States\r\nJudge for the Seventh Judicial Circuit. Gresham was a candidate for the\r\nRepublican presidential nomination in 1884 and 1888, in the latter year\r\nleading for some time in the balloting. Gradually, however, he grew out\r\nof sympathy with the Republican leaders and policy, and in 1892\r\nadvocated the election of the Democratic candidate, Grover Cleveland,\r\nfor the presidency. From the 7th of March 1893 until his death at\r\nWashington on the 28th of May 1895, he was secretary of state in\r\nPresident Cleveland's cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRESHAM'S LAW, in economics, the name suggested in 1857 by H. D. Macleod\r\nfor the principle of currency which may be briefly summarized--\"bad\r\nmoney drives out good.\" Macleod gave it this name, which has been\r\nuniversally adopted, under the impression that the principle was first\r\nexplained by Sir Thomas Gresham in 1558. In reality it had been well set\r\nforth by earlier economic writers, notably Oresme and Copernicus.\r\nMacleod states the law in these terms: the worst form of currency in\r\ncirculation regulates the value of the whole currency and drives all\r\nother forms of currency out of circulation. Gresham's law applies where\r\nthere is under-weight or debased coin in circulation with full-weight\r\ncoin of the same metal; where there are two metals in circulation, and\r\none is undervalued as compared with the other, and where inconvertible\r\npaper money is put into circulation side by side with a metallic\r\ncurrency. See further BIMETALLISM; MONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRESSET, JEAN BAPTISTE LOUIS (1709-1777), French poet and dramatist, was\r\nborn at Amiens on the 29th of August 1709. His poem _Vert Vert_ is his\r\nmain title to fame. He spent, however, the last twenty-five years of his\r\nlife in regretting the frivolity which enabled him to produce this most\r\ncharming of poems. He was brought up by the Jesuits of Amiens. He was\r\naccepted as a novice at the age of sixteen, and sent to pursue his\r\nstudies at the College Louis le Grand in Paris. After completing his\r\ncourse he was appointed, being then under twenty years of age, to a post\r\nas assistant master in a college at Rouen. He published _Vert Vert_ at\r\nRouen in 1734. It is a story, in itself exceedingly humorous, showing\r\nhow a parrot, the delight of a convent, whose talk was all of prayers\r\nand pious ejaculations, was conveyed to another convent as a visitor to\r\nplease the nuns. On the way he falls among bad companions, forgets his\r\nconvent language, and shocks the sisters on arrival by profane swearing.\r\nHe is sent back in disgrace, punished by solitude and plain bread,\r\npresently repents, reforms and is killed by kindness. The story,\r\nhowever, is nothing. The treatment of the subject, the atmosphere which\r\nsurrounds it, the delicacy in which the little prattling ways of the\r\nnuns, their jealousies, their tiny trifles, are presented, takes the\r\nreader entirely by surprise. The poem stands absolutely unrivalled, even\r\namong French _contes en vers_.\r\n\r\nGresset found himself famous. He left Rouen, went up to Paris, where he\r\nfound refuge in the same garret which had sheltered him when a boy at\r\nthe College Louis le Grand, and there wrote his second poem, _La\r\nChartreuse_. It was followed by the _Careme impromptu_, the _Lutrin\r\nvivant_ and _Les Ombres_. Then trouble came upon him; complaints were\r\nmade to the fathers of the alleged licentiousness of his verses, the\r\nreal cause of complaint being the ridicule which _Vert Vert_ seemed to\r\nthrow upon the whole race of nuns and the anti-clerical tendency of the\r\nother poems. An example, it was urged, must be made; Gresset was\r\nexpelled the order. Men of robust mind would have been glad to get rid\r\nof such a yoke. Gresset, who had never been taught to stand alone, went\r\nforth weeping. He went to Paris in 1740 and there produced _Edouard\r\nIII_, a tragedy (1740) and _Sidnei_ (1745), a comedy. These were\r\nfollowed by _Le Mechant_ which still keeps the stage, and is qualified\r\nby Brunetiere as the best verse comedy of the French 18th century\r\ntheatre, not excepting even the _Metromanie_ of Alexis Piron. Gresset\r\nwas admitted to the Academy in 1748. And then, still young, he retired\r\nto Amiens, where his relapse from the discipline of the church became\r\nthe subject of the deepest remorse. He died at Amiens on the 16th of\r\nJune 1777.\r\n\r\n  The best edition of his poems is A. A. Renouard's (1811). See Jules\r\n  Wogue, _J. B. L. Gresset_ (1894).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRETNA GREEN, or GRAITNEY GREEN, a village in the south-east of\r\nDumfriesshire, Scotland, about 8 m. E. of Annan, 9 m. N.N.W. of\r\nCarlisle, and 3/4 m. from the river Sark, here the dividing-line between\r\nEngland and Scotland, with a station on the Glasgow & South-Western\r\nrailway. The Caledonian and North British railways have a station at\r\nGretna on the English side of the Border. As the nearest village on the\r\nScottish side, Gretna Green was notorious as the resort of eloping\r\ncouples, who had failed to obtain the consent of parents or guardians to\r\ntheir union. Up till 1754, when Lord Hardwicke's act abolishing\r\nclandestine marriages came into force, the ceremony had commonly been\r\nperformed in the Fleet prison in London. After that date runaway couples\r\nwere compelled to seek the hospitality of a country where it sufficed\r\nfor them to declare their wish to marry in the presence of witnesses. At\r\nGretna Green the ceremony was usually performed by the blacksmith, but\r\nthe toll-keeper, ferryman or in fact any person might officiate, and the\r\ntoll-house, the inn, or, after 1826, Gretna Hall was the scene of many\r\nsuch weddings, the fees varying from half a guinea to a sum as large as\r\nimpudence could extort or extravagance bestow. As many as two hundred\r\ncouples were married at the toll-house in a year. The romantic traffic\r\nwas practically, though not necessarily, put an end to in 1856, when the\r\nlaw required one of the contracting parties to reside in Scotland three\r\nweeks previous to the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRETRY, ANDRE ERNEST MODESTE (1741-1813), French composer, was born at\r\nLiege on the 8th of February 1741, his father being a poor musician. He\r\nwas a choir boy at the church of St Denis. In 1753 he became a pupil of\r\nLeclerc and later of Renekin and Moreau. But of greater importance was\r\nthe practical tuition he received by attending the performance of an\r\nItalian opera company. Here he heard the operas of Galuppi, Pergolesi\r\nand other masters; and the desire of completing his own studies in Italy\r\nwas the immediate result. To find the necessary means he composed in\r\n1759 a mass which he dedicated to the canons of the Liege cathedral, and\r\nit was at the cost of Canon Hurley that he went to Italy in the March of\r\n1759. In Rome he went to the College de Liege. Here Gretry resided for\r\nfive years, studiously employed in completing his musical education\r\nunder Casali. His proficiency in harmony and counterpoint was, however,\r\naccording to his own confession, at all times very moderate. His first\r\ngreat success was achieved by _La Vendemmiatrice_, an Italian intermezzo\r\nor operetta, composed for the Aliberti theatre in Rome and received with\r\nuniversal applause. It is said that the study of the score of one of\r\nMonsigny's operas, lent to him by a secretary of the French embassy in\r\nRome, decided Gretry to devote himself to French comic opera. On New\r\nYear's day 1767 he accordingly left Rome, and after a short stay at\r\nGeneva (where he made the acquaintance of Voltaire, and produced another\r\noperetta) went to Paris. There for two years he had to contend with the\r\ndifficulties incident to poverty and obscurity. He was, however, not\r\nwithout friends, and by the intercession of Count Creutz, the Swedish\r\nambassador, Gretry obtained a libretto from Marmontel, which he set to\r\nmusic in less than six weeks, and which, on its performance in August\r\n1768, met with unparalleled success. The name of the opera was _Le\r\nHuron_. Two others, _Lucile_ and _Le Tableau parlant_, soon followed,\r\nand thenceforth Gretry's position as the leading composer of comic opera\r\nwas safely established. Altogether he composed some fifty operas. His\r\nmasterpieces are _Zemire et Azor_ and _Richard Coeur de Lion_,--the\r\nfirst produced in 1771, the second in 1784. The latter in an indirect\r\nway became connected with a great historic event. In it occurs the\r\ncelebrated romance, _O Richard, o mon roi, l'univers t'abandonne_, which\r\nwas sung at the banquet--\"fatal as that of Thyestes,\" remarks\r\nCarlyle--given by the bodyguard to the officers of the Versailles\r\ngarrison on October 3, 1789. The _Marseillaise_ not long afterwards\r\nbecame the reply of the people to the expression of loyalty borrowed\r\nfrom Gretry's opera. The composer himself was not uninfluenced by the\r\ngreat events he witnessed, and the titles of some of his operas, such as\r\n_La Rosiere republicaine_ and _La Fete de la raison_, sufficiently\r\nindicate the epoch to which they belong; but they are mere _pieces de\r\ncirconstance_, and the republican enthusiasm displayed is not genuine.\r\nLittle more successful was Gretry in his dealings with classical\r\nsubjects. His genuine power lay in the delineation of character and in\r\nthe expression of tender and typically French sentiment. The structure\r\nof his concerted pieces on the other hand is frequently flimsy, and his\r\ninstrumentation so feeble that the orchestral parts of some of his works\r\nhad to be rewritten by other composers, in order to make them acceptable\r\nto modern audiences. During the revolution Gretry lost much of his\r\nproperty, but the successive governments of France vied in favouring the\r\ncomposer, regardless of political differences. From the old court he\r\nreceived distinctions and rewards of all kinds; the republic made him an\r\ninspector of the conservatoire; Napoleon granted him the cross of the\r\nlegion of honour and a pension. Gretry died on the 24th of September\r\n1813, at the Hermitage in Montmorency, formerly the house of Rousseau.\r\nFifteen years after his death Gretry's heart was transferred to his\r\nbirthplace, permission having been obtained after a tedious lawsuit. In\r\n1842 a colossal bronze statue of the composer was set up at Liege.\r\n\r\n  See Michael Brenet, _Vie de Gretry_ (Paris, 1884); Joach. le Breton,\r\n  _Notice historique sur la vie et les ouvrages de Gretry_ (Paris,\r\n  1814); A.

Grandon not only persuaded the father of Greuze to\r\ngive way to his son's wishes, and permit the lad to accompany him as his\r\npupil to Lyons, but, when at a later date he himself left Lyons for\r\nParis--where his son-in-law Gretry the celebrated composer enjoyed the\r\nheight of favour--Grandon carried young Greuze with him. Settled in\r\nParis, Greuze worked from the living model in the school of the Royal\r\nAcademy, but did not attract the attention of his teachers; and when he\r\nproduced his first picture, \"Le Pere de famille expliquant la Bible a\r\nses enfants,\" considerable doubt was felt and shown as to his share in\r\nits production. By other and more remarkable works of the same class\r\nGreuze soon established his claims beyond contest, and won for himself\r\nthe notice and support of the well-known connoisseur La Live de Jully,\r\nthe brother-in-law of Madame d'Epinay. In 1755 Greuze exhibited his\r\n\"Aveugle trompe,\" upon which, presented by Pigalle the sculptor, he was\r\nimmediately _agree_ by the Academy. Towards the close of the same year\r\nhe left France for Italy, in company with the Abbe Louis Gougenot, who\r\nhad deserted from the magistrature--although he had obtained the post of\r\n\"conseillier au Chatelet\"--in order to take the \"petit collet.\" Gougenot\r\nhad some acquaintance with the arts, and was highly valued by the\r\nAcademicians, who, during his journey with Greuze, elected him an\r\nhonorary member of their body on account of his studies in mythology and\r\nallegory; his acquirements in these respects are said to have been\r\nlargely utilized by them, but to Greuze they were of doubtful advantage,\r\nand he lost rather than gained by this visit to Italy in Gougenot's\r\ncompany. He had undertaken it probably in order to silence those who\r\ntaxed him with ignorance of \"great models of style,\" but the Italian\r\nsubjects which formed the entirety of his contributions to the Salon of\r\n1757 showed that he had been put on a false track, and he speedily\r\nreturned to the source of his first inspiration. In 1759, 1761\r\n(\"L'Accordee de village\"--Louvre), and 1763 Greuze exhibited with\r\never-increasing success; in 1765 he reached the zenith of his powers and\r\nreputation. In that year he was represented with no less than thirteen\r\nworks, amongst which may be cited \"La Jeune Fille qui pleure son oiseau\r\nmort,\" \"La Bonne Mere,\" \"Le Mauvais fils puni\" (Louvre) and \"La\r\nMalediction paternelle\" (Louvre). The Academy took occasion to press\r\nGreuze for his diploma picture, the execution of which had been long\r\ndelayed, and forbade him to exhibit on their walls until he had complied\r\nwith their regulations. \"J'ai vu la lettre,\" says Diderot, \"qui est un\r\nmodele d'honnetete et d'estime; j'ai vu la reponse de Greuze, qui est un\r\nmodele de vanite et d'impertinence: il fallait appuyer cela d'un\r\nchef-d'oeuvre, et c'est ce que Greuze n'a pas fait.\" Greuze wished to be\r\nreceived as a historical painter, and produced a work which he intended\r\nto vindicate his right to despise his qualifications as a _peintre de\r\ngenre_. This unfortunate canvas--\"Severe et Caracalla\" (Louvre)--was\r\nexhibited in 1769 side by side with Greuze's portrait of Jeaurat\r\n(Louvre) and his admirable \"Petite Fille au chien noir.\" The\r\nAcademicians received their new member with all due honours, but at the\r\nclose of the ceremonies the Director addressed Greuze in these\r\nwords--\"Monsieur, l'Academie vous a recu, mais c'est comme peintre de\r\ngenre; elle a eu egard a vos anciennes productions, qui sont\r\nexcellentes, et elle a ferme les yeux sur celle-ci, qui n'est digne ni\r\nd'elle ni de vous.\" Greuze, greatly incensed, quarrelled with his\r\n_confreres_, and ceased to exhibit until, in 1804, the Revolution had\r\nthrown open the doors of the Academy to all the world. In the following\r\nyear, on the 4th of March 1805, he died in the Louvre in great poverty.\r\nHe had been in receipt of considerable wealth, which he had dissipated\r\nby extravagance and bad management, so that during his closing years he\r\nwas forced even to solicit commissions which his enfeebled powers no\r\nlonger enabled him to carry out with success. The brilliant reputation\r\nwhich Greuze acquired seems to have been due, not to his acquirements as\r\na painter--for his practice is evidently that current in his own\r\nday--but to the character of the subjects which he treated. That return\r\nto nature which inspired Rousseau's attacks upon an artificial\r\ncivilization demanded expression in art. Diderot, in _Le Fils naturel et\r\nle pere de famille_, tried to turn the vein of domestic drama to account\r\non the stage; that which he tried and failed to do Greuze, in painting,\r\nachieved with extraordinary success, although his works, like the plays\r\nof Diderot, were affected by that very artificiality against which they\r\nprotested. The touch of melodramatic exaggeration, however, which runs\r\nthrough them finds an apology in the firm and brilliant play of line, in\r\nthe freshness and vigour of the flesh tints, in the enticing softness of\r\nexpression (often obtained by almost an abuse of _meplats_), by the\r\nalluring air of health and youth, by the sensuous attractions, in short,\r\nwith which Greuze invests his lessons of bourgeois morality. As Diderot\r\nsaid of \"La Bonne Mere,\" \"ca preche la population;\" and a certain\r\npiquancy of contrast is the result which never fails to obtain\r\nadmirers. \"La Jeune Fille a l'agneau\" fetched, indeed, at the Pourtales\r\nsale in 1865, no less than 1,000,200 francs. One of Greuze's pupils,\r\nMadame Le Doux, imitated with success the manner of her master; his\r\ndaughter and granddaughter, Madame de Valory, also inherited some\r\ntraditions of his talent. Madame de Valory published in 1813 a\r\ncomedie-vaudeville, _Greuze, ou l'accordee de village_, to which she\r\nprefixed a notice of her grandfather's life and works, and the _Salons_\r\nof Diderot also contain, besides many other particulars, the story at\r\nfull length of Greuze's quarrel with the Academy. Four of the most\r\ndistinguished engravers of that date, Massard pere, Flipart, Gaillard\r\nand Levasseur, were specially entrusted by Greuze with the reproduction\r\nof his subjects, but there are also excellent prints by other engravers,\r\nnotably by Cars and Le Bas.\r\n\r\n  See also Normand, _J. B. Greuze_ (1892).     (E. F. S. D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREVILLE, CHARLES CAVENDISH FULKE (1794-1865), English diarist, a\r\ngreat-grandson by his father of the 5th earl of Warwick, and son of Lady\r\nCharlotte Bentinck, daughter of the duke of Portland, formerly a leader\r\nof the Whig party, and first minister of the crown, was born on the 2nd\r\nof April 1794. Much of his childhood was spent at his grandfather's\r\nhouse at Bulstrode. He was one of the pages of George III., and was\r\neducated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford; but he left the university\r\nearly, having been appointed private secretary to Earl Bathurst before\r\nhe was twenty. The interest of the duke of Portland had secured for him\r\nthe secretaryship of the island of Jamaica, which was a sinecure office,\r\nthe duties being performed by a deputy, and the reversion of the\r\nclerkship of the council. Greville entered upon the discharge of the\r\nduties of clerk of the council in ordinary in 1821, and continued to\r\nperform them for nearly forty years. He therefore served under three\r\nsuccessive sovereigns,--George IV., William IV. and Victoria,--and\r\nalthough no political or confidential functions are attached to that\r\noffice, it is one which brings a man into habitual intercourse with the\r\nchiefs of all the parties in the state. Well-born, well-bred, handsome\r\nand accomplished, Greville led the easy life of a man of fashion, taking\r\nan occasional part in the transactions of his day and much consulted in\r\nthe affairs of private life. Until 1855 when he sold his stud he was an\r\nactive member of the turf, and he trained successively with Lord George\r\nBentinck, and with the duke of Portland. But the celebrity which now\r\nattaches to his name is entirely due to the posthumous publication of a\r\nportion of a Journal or Diary which it was his practice to keep during\r\nthe greater part of his life. These papers were given by him to his\r\nfriend Mr Henry Reeve a short time before his death (which took place on\r\nthe 18th of January 1865), with an injunction that they should be\r\npublished, as far as was feasible, at not too remote a period after the\r\nwriter's death. The journals of the reigns of George IV. and William IV.\r\n(extending from 1820 to 1837) were accordingly so published in obedience\r\nto his directions about ten years after that event. Few publications\r\nhave been received with greater interest by the public; five large\r\neditions were sold in little more than a year, and the demand in America\r\nwas as great as in England. These journals were regarded as a faithful\r\nrecord of the impressions made on the mind of a competent observer, at\r\nthe time, by the events he witnessed and the persons with whom he\r\nassociated. Greville did not stoop to collect or record private scandal.\r\nHis object appears to have been to leave behind him some of the\r\nmaterials of history, by which the men and actions of his own time would\r\nbe judged. He records not so much public events as the private causes\r\nwhich led to them; and perhaps no English memoir-writer has left behind\r\nhim a more valuable contribution to the history of the 19th century.\r\nGreville published anonymously, in 1845, a volume on the _Past and\r\nPresent Policy of England to Ireland_, in which he advocated the payment\r\nof the Roman Catholic clergy; and he was also the author of several\r\npamphlets on the events of his day.\r\n\r\nHis brother, HENRY GREVILLE (1801-1872), attache to the British embassy\r\nin Paris from 1834 to 1844, also kept a diary, of which part was\r\npublished by Viscountess Enfield, _Leaves from the Diary of Henry\r\nGreville_ (London, 1883-1884).\r\n\r\n  See the preface and notes to the _Greville Memoirs_ by Henry Reeve.\r\n  The memoirs appeared in three sets--one from 1817 to 1837 (London,\r\n  1875, 3 vols.), and two for the period from 1837 to 1860, three\r\n  volumes in 1885 and two in 1887. When the first series appeared in\r\n  1875 some passages caused extreme offence. The copies issued were as\r\n  far as possible recalled and passages suppressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREVIN, JACQUES (c. 1539-1570), French dramatist, was born at Clermont\r\nabout 1539. He studied medicine at the university of Paris. He became a\r\ndisciple of Ronsard, and was one of the band of dramatists who sought to\r\nintroduce the classical drama in France. As Sainte-Beuve points out, the\r\ncomedies of Grevin show considerable affinity with the farces and\r\n_soties_ that preceded them. His first play, _La Maubertine_, was lost,\r\nand formed the basis of a new comedy, _La Tresoriere_, first performed\r\nat the college of Beauvais in 1558, though it had been originally\r\ncomposed at the desire of Henry II. to celebrate the marriage of Claude,\r\nduchess of Lorraine. In 1560 followed the tragedy of _Jules Cesar_,\r\nimitated from the Latin of Muret, and a comedy, _Les Ebahis_, the most\r\nimportant but also the most indecent of his works. Grevin was also the\r\nauthor of some medical works and of miscellaneous poems, which were\r\npraised by Ronsard until the friends were separated by religious\r\ndifferences. Grevin became in 1561 physician and counsellor to Margaret\r\nof Savoy, and died at her court in Turin in 1570.\r\n\r\n  The _Theatre_ of Jacques Grevin was printed in 1562, and in the\r\n  _Ancien Theatre francais_, vol. iv. (1855-1856). See L. Pinvert,\r\n  _Jacques Grevin_ (1899).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREVY, FRANCOIS PAUL JULES (1813-1891). President of the French\r\nRepublic, was born at Mont-sous-Vaudrey in the Jura, on the 15th of\r\nAugust 1813. He became an advocate in 1837, and, having steadily\r\nmaintained republican principles under the Orleans monarchy, was elected\r\nby his native department to the Constituent Assembly of 1848. Foreseeing\r\nthat Louis Bonaparte would be elected president by the people, he\r\nproposed to vest the chief authority in a president of the Council\r\nelected and removable by the Assembly, or in other words, to suppress\r\nthe Presidency of the Republic. After the _coup d'etat_ this proposition\r\ngained Grevy a reputation for sagacity, and upon his return to public\r\nlife in 1868 he took a prominent place in the republican party. After\r\nthe fall of the Empire he was chosen president of the Assembly on the\r\n16th of February 1871, and occupied this position till the 2nd of April\r\n1876, when he resigned on account of the opposition of the Right, which\r\nblamed him for having called one of its members to order in the session\r\nof the previous day. On the 8th of March 1876 he was elected president\r\nof the Chamber of Deputies, a post which he filled with such efficiency\r\nthat upon the resignation of Marshal MacMahon he seemed to step\r\nnaturally into the Presidency of the Republic (30th January 1879), and\r\nwas elected without opposition by the republican parties (see FRANCE:\r\n_History_). Quiet, shrewd, attentive to the public interest and his own,\r\nbut without any particular distinction, he would have left an\r\nunblemished reputation if he had not unfortunately accepted a second\r\nterm (18th December 1885). Shortly afterwards the traffic of his\r\nson-in-law (Daniel Wilson) in the decorations of the Legion of Honour\r\ncame to light. Grevy was not accused of personal participation in these\r\nscandals, but he was somewhat obstinate in refusing to realize that he\r\nwas responsible indirectly for the use which his relative had made of\r\nthe Elysee, and it had to be unpleasantly impressed upon him that his\r\nresignation was inevitable (2nd December 1887). He died at\r\nMont-sous-Vaudrey on the 9th of September 1891. He owed both his success\r\nand his failure to the completeness with which he represented the\r\nparticular type of the thrifty, generally sensible and patriotic, but\r\nnarrow-minded and frequently egoistic _bourgeois_.\r\n\r\n  See his _Discours politiques et judiciaires, rapports et messages ...\r\n  accompagnes de notices historiques et precedes d'une introduction par\r\n  L. Delabrousse_ (2 vols., 1888).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREW, NEHEMIAH (1641-1712), English vegetable anatomist and\r\nphysiologist, was the only son of Obadiah Grew (1607-1688),\r\nNonconformist divine and vicar of St Michael's, Coventry, and was born\r\nin Warwickshire in 1641. He graduated at Cambridge in 1661, and ten\r\nyears later took the degree of M.D. at Leiden, his thesis being\r\n_Disputatio medico-physica ... de liquore nervoso_. He began\r\nobservations on the anatomy of plants in 1664, and in 1670 his essay,\r\n_The Anatomy of Vegetables begun_, was communicated to the Royal Society\r\nby Bishop Wilkins, on whose recommendation he was in the following year\r\nelected a fellow. In 1672, when the essay was published, he settled in\r\nLondon, and soon acquired an extensive practice as a physician. In 1673\r\nhe published his _Idea of a Phytological History_, which consisted of\r\npapers he had communicated to the Royal Society in the preceding year,\r\nand in 1677 he succeeded Henry Oldenburg as secretary of the society. He\r\nedited the _Philosophical Transactions_ in 1678-1679, and in 1681 he\r\npublished \"by request\" a descriptive catalogue of the rarities preserved\r\nat Gresham College, with which were printed some papers he had read to\r\nthe Royal Society on the _Comparative Anatomy of Stomachs and Guts_. In\r\n1682 appeared his great work on the _Anatomy of Plants_, which also was\r\nlargely a collection of previous publications. It was divided into four\r\nbooks, _Anatomy of Vegetables begun_, _Anatomy of Roots_, _Anatomy of\r\nTrunks_ and _Anatomy of Leaves, Flowers, Fruits and Seeds_, and was\r\nillustrated with eighty-two plates, while appended to it were seven\r\npapers mostly of a chemical character. Among his other publications were\r\n_Sea-water made Fresh_ (1684), the _Nature and Use of the Salt contained\r\nin Epsom and such other Waters_ (1697), which was a rendering of his\r\n_Tractatus de salis ... usu_ (1695), and _Cosmologia sacra_ (1701). He\r\ndied suddenly on the 25th of March 1712. Linnaeus named a genus of trees\r\n_Grewia_ (nat. ord. Tiliaceae) in his honour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREY, CHARLES GREY, 2ND EARL (1764-1845), English statesman, was the\r\neldest surviving son of General Sir Charles Grey, afterwards 1st Earl\r\nGrey. He was born at his father's residence, Fallodon, near Alnwick, on\r\nthe 13th of March 1764. General Grey (1729-1807), who was a younger son\r\nof the house of Grey of Howick, one of the most considerable territorial\r\nfamilies in Northumberland, had already begun a career of active service\r\nwhich, like the political career of his son, covered nearly half a\r\ncentury. Before the latter was born, General Grey had served on the\r\nstaff of Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick in the Seven Years' War and had\r\nbeen wounded at Minden. While the son was making verses at Eton, the\r\nfather was serving against the revolted colonists in Pennsylvania and\r\nNew Jersey, and while the young member for Northumberland was denouncing\r\nPitt's war against the Convention, the veteran soldier was destroying\r\nthe remnant of the French colonial empire by the capture of Martinique\r\nand Guadeloupe. When Napoleon threatened an invasion, General Grey took\r\nthe command of the southern district, and at the peace of Amiens he was\r\nrewarded with a peerage, as Baron Grey of Alnwick, being created in 1806\r\nEarl Grey and Viscount Howick. His elder brother, Sir Henry Grey of\r\nHowick, the head of the family, had supported the government in\r\nparliament. But the political career of young Grey, who was\r\nheir-presumptive to the family estates, took a different complexion.\r\n\r\nYoung Grey expected to reoccupy the seat which had been his uncle's; and\r\nhis early years were spent in preparation for a parliamentary career. He\r\nwas sent to Eton, and proceeded thence to Cambridge. William Pitt, a\r\nyouth five years older, was then in residence as a master of arts,\r\nstudiously paying court to the Whigs of the university; and at the\r\ngeneral election of 1780 he came forward as a candidate for the\r\nacademical seat. His name stood last on the poll, but he was brought in\r\nelsewhere, and his first speech proved him a man of the first mark. The\r\nunparalleled successes which followed portended grave changes. Pitt's\r\nelevation to the premiership, his brilliant and hard-fought battle in\r\nthe house, and his complete rout of the Whig party at the general\r\nelection of 1784, when he came in for Cambridge at the head of the poll,\r\nthreatened the great territorial interest with nothing less than\r\nextinction. It was to this interest that Grey belonged; and hence, when\r\nat length returned for Northumberland in 1786, he at once came forward\r\nas a vigorous assailant of the government of Pitt. He was hailed by the\r\nopposition, and associated with Fox, Burke and Sheridan as a manager in\r\nthe Hastings impeachment. During the nineteen years which remained of\r\nthe career of Fox, he followed the great Whig statesman with absolute\r\nfidelity, and succeeded him as leader of the party. The shortcomings of\r\nFox's statesmanship were inherited by Grey. Both were equally devoid of\r\npolitical originality, shunned the severer labours of the politician,\r\nand instinctively feared any deviation from the traditions of their\r\nparty. Such men cannot save a party in its decadence, and the history of\r\nFox and Grey has been aptly termed the history of the decline and fall\r\nof Whiggism.\r\n\r\nThe stunning blow of 1784 was the first incident in this history. Its\r\nfull significance was not at once perceived. An opposition, however weak\r\nin the beginning, generally has a tendency to revive, and Grey's early\r\nsuccesses in the house helped to revive the Foxites. The European\r\nsituation became favourable to this revival. The struggle in France for\r\npopular rights, culminating in the great Revolution, was watched by Fox\r\nwith interested sympathy. He affected to regard the domination of Pitt\r\nas the domination of the crown, and as leading logically to absolutism,\r\nand saw in that popular sympathy for the French Revolution which\r\nnaturally arose in England an instrument which might be employed to\r\noverthrow this domination.\r\n\r\nBut Pitt gathered the fruits of the windfall. The spread of\r\n\"Jacobinism,\" or \"French principles,\" became the pretext on which the\r\nstronger half of the opposition went over to the government. Burke led\r\nthe movement in the Commons, the duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliam\r\nin the Lords, and with this second incident in the Whig decline began\r\nthe difficulties of Grey's career. The domination of the premier had\r\nalready stirred the keenest resentment in the younger and more ambitious\r\nmembers of the Whig party. Freed from the restraint of the steadier\r\npoliticians under Burke and Portland, the residuum under Fox fell into a\r\nseries of grave mistakes. Of this residuum Grey became the moving\r\nspirit, for though Fox did not check their activity, he disclaimed the\r\nresponsibility of their policy. Fox had refused to condemn \"French\r\nprinciples,\" and denounced the war with France; but he would take no\r\npart in exciting agitation in England. It was otherwise with the\r\nrestless spirits among whom Grey was found. Enraged by the attitude of\r\nPitt, which was grounded on the support of the constituencies as they\r\nthen stood, the residuum plotted an ill-timed agitation for\r\nparliamentary reform.\r\n\r\nThe demand for parliamentary reform was as yet in a rudimentary stage.\r\nForty years later it had become the demand of an unenfranchised nation,\r\ndisabused by a sudden spread of political and economical knowledge. It\r\nwas as yet but the occasional instrument of the scheming politician.\r\nChatham had employed the cry in this sense. The Middlesex agitators had\r\ndone the same; even the premier of the time, after his accession to\r\npower, had sought to strengthen his hands in the same way. But Pitt's\r\nhands were now strengthened abundantly; whereas the opposition had\r\nnothing to lose and much to gain by such a measure. The cry for reform\r\nthus became their natural expedient. Powerless to carry reform in the\r\nHouse, they sought to overawe parliament by external agitation, and\r\nformed the Society of the Friends of the People, destined to unite the\r\nforces of all the \"patriotic\" societies which already existed in the\r\ncountry, and to pour their violence irresistibly on a terrified\r\nparliament. Grey and his friends were enrolled in this portentous\r\nassociation, and presented in parliament its menacing petitions. Such\r\npetitions, which were in fact violent impeachments of parliament itself,\r\nproceeding from voluntary associations having no corporate existence,\r\nhad been hitherto unknown in the English parliament. They had been well\r\nknown in the French assembly. They had heralded and furthered the\r\nvictory of the Jacobins, the dissolution of the constitution, the\r\ncalling of the Convention and the fall of the monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe Society of the Friends of the People was originally an after-dinner\r\nfolly, extemporized at the house of a man who afterwards gained an\r\nearldom by denouncing it as seditious. Fox discountenanced it, though he\r\ndid not directly condemn it; but Grey was overborne by the fierce\r\nJacobinism of Lauderdale, and avowed himself the parliamentary\r\nmouthpiece of this dangerous agitation. But Pitt, strong in his\r\nposition, cut the ground from under Grey's feet by suppressing the\r\nagitation with a strong hand. The suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act,\r\nthe Gagging Acts and the state prosecutions form a painful historical\r\nepisode. But the discredit belongs as much to Grey and Lauderdale as to\r\nPitt. Grey always spoke regretfully of his share in the movement. \"One\r\nword from Fox,\" he said, \"would have kept me out of all the mess of the\r\nFriends of the People. But he never spoke it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Grey who moved the impeachment of Pitt, and he next promoted the\r\nequally foolish \"Secession.\" Since the parliament did not properly\r\nrepresent the nation, and refused to reform itself or to impeach the\r\nminister, nothing remained but to disown it; and the opposition\r\nannounced their intention of \"seceding,\" or systematically absenting\r\nthemselves from their places in parliament. This futile movement was\r\noriginated by Grey, Lauderdale and the duke of Bedford. It obtained a\r\nsomewhat wider support. It suited the languor of some dispirited\r\npoliticians like Fox, and the avarice of some lawyers in large practice\r\nlike Erskine; but sensible politicians at once condemned it. It directly\r\nignored parliamentary government, and amounted to nothing but a pettish\r\nthreat of revolution. \"Secession,\" said Lord Lansdowne, with\r\ncharacteristic shrewdness, \"either means rebellion, or it is nonsense.\"\r\nPitt easily dashed this feeble weapon from the hands of his opponents.\r\nHe roused jealousy in the absent by praising the parts and the\r\npatriotism of the rest, and thus gradually brought them back. Grey\r\nhimself reappeared to protest against the union with Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhen Pitt died in 1806 nothing could prevent the reunited opposition\r\nfrom coming into power, and thus the Broad-bottom ministry was formed\r\nunder Fox. On his death Grenville became premier, and Grey, now Lord\r\nHowick, foreign secretary, and leader of the House of Commons. Disunion,\r\nalways the bane of English Liberalism, lurked in the coalition, and the\r\nFoxites and Grenvillites were only ostensibly at one. Grey opposed the\r\nwar policy of Grenville; and this policy was not more successful than it\r\nhad been in the hands of Pitt. And the change from the leadership of Fox\r\nto that of Grenville was only too perceptible. Both in court and country\r\nGrenville affected the role of Pitt, and assumed a stiff and peremptory\r\nattitude which ill became him. An ill-advised dissolution weakened their\r\nmajority; they lost ground by the \"delicate investigation\" into the\r\nconduct of the princess of Wales; Lord Henry Petty's budget was too\r\nspecious to command confidence; and the king, fully aware of their weak\r\nsituation, resolved to get rid of them. When they proposed to concede a\r\nportion of the Catholic claims, George refused and demanded of them an\r\nundertaking never to propose such a measure again. This was refused, and\r\nthe Grenville-Grey cabinet retired in March 1807. In the same year\r\nGrey's father died, and Grey went to the Upper House. Opposition united\r\nGrey and Grenville for a time, but the parties finally split on the old\r\nwar question. When Napoleon returned from Elba in 1815, and once more\r\nseized the government of France, the same question arose which had\r\narisen in 1792, Was England to go to war for the restoration of the\r\nBourbons? Grenville followed the traditions of Pitt, and supported the\r\nministry in at once renewing hostilities. Grey followed those of Fox,\r\nand maintained the right of France to choose her own governors, and the\r\nimpossibility of checking the reaction in the emperor's favour. The\r\nvictory of Waterloo put an end to the dispute, but the disruption became\r\npermanent. The termination of the war, and the cessation of all action\r\nin common, reduced the power of the opposition to nothing. Grenville\r\nretired from public life, and his adherents reinforced the ministry.\r\nLittle remained for the Whigs to do. But the persecution of the queen\r\nafforded an opportunity of showing that the ministry were not\r\nomnipotent; and the part taken on that occasion by Grey won him at once\r\nthe increased respect of the nation and the undying aversion of George\r\nIV. It sealed the exclusion of himself and his few friends from office\r\nduring the king's life; and when in 1827 Grey came forth to denounce the\r\nministry of Canning, he declared that he stood alone in the political\r\nworld. His words were soon justified, for when Lord Goderich resigned,\r\nthe remnant which had hitherto supported Grey, hastened to support the\r\nministry of the duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\nWe now reach the principal episode in Grey's career. In 1827 he seemed\r\nto stand forth the solitary and powerless relic of an extinct party. In\r\n1832 we find that party restored to its old numbers and activity,\r\nsupreme in parliament, popular in the nation, and Lord Grey at its head.\r\nThe duke of Wellington's foolish declaration against parliamentary\r\nreform, made in a season of great popular excitement, suddenly deprived\r\nhim of the confidence of the country, and a coalition of the Whigs and\r\nCanningites became inevitable. The Whigs had in 1827 supported the\r\nCanningites; the latter now supported the Whigs, of whom Grey remained\r\nthe traditional head. George IV. was dead, and no obstacle existed to\r\nGrey's elevation. Grey was sent for by William IV. in November 1830, and\r\nformed a coalition cabinet, pledged to carry on the work in which the\r\nduke of Wellington had faltered. But Grey himself was the mere\r\ninstrument of the times. An old-fashioned Whig, he had little personal\r\nsympathy with the popular cause, though he had sometimes indicated a\r\ncertain measure of reform as necessary. When he took office, he guessed\r\nneither the extent to which the Reform Act would go, nor the means by\r\nwhich it would be carried. That he procured for the country a measure of\r\nconstitutional reform for which he had agitated in his youth was little\r\nmore than a coincidence. In his youth he had put himself at the head of\r\na frantic agitation against parliament, because he there found himself\r\npowerless. In his old age the case was reversed. Suddenly raised to a\r\nposition of authority in the country, he boldly stood between\r\nparliament, as then constituted, and the formidable agitation which now\r\nthreatened it and by a forced reform saved it from revolution. In his\r\nyouth he had assailed Pitt's administration because Pitt's\r\nadministration threatened with extinction the political monopoly of that\r\nlanded interest to which he belonged. In his old age, on the contrary,\r\nunable to check the progress of the wave, he swam with it, and headed\r\nthe movement which compelled that landed interest to surrender its\r\nmonopoly.\r\n\r\nThe second reading of the first Reform Bill was carried in the Commons\r\nby a majority of one. This was equivalent to a defeat, and further\r\nfailures precipitated a dissolution. The confidence which the bold\r\naction of the ministry had won was soon plainly proved, for the second\r\nreading was carried in the new parliament by a majority of 136. When the\r\nbill had at length passed the Commons after months of debate, it was\r\nGrey's task to introduce it to the Lords. It was rejected by a majority\r\nof 41. The safety of the country now depended on the prudence and\r\ncourage of the ministry. The resignation of Grey and his colleagues was\r\ndreaded even by the opposition, and they remained in office with the\r\nintention of introducing a third Reform Bill in the next session. The\r\nlast months of 1831 were the beginning of a political crisis such as\r\nEngland had not seen since 1688. The two extreme parties, the\r\nUltra-Radicals and the Ultra-Tories, were ready for civil war. Between\r\nthem stood the ministry and the majority of intelligent peace-loving\r\nEnglishmen; and their course of action was soon decided. The bill must\r\nbe passed, and there were but two ways of passing it. One was to declare\r\nthe consent of the House of Lords unnecessary to the measure, the other\r\nto create, if necessary, new peers in sufficient number to outvote the\r\nopposition. These two expedients did not in reality differ. To swamp the\r\nhouse in the way proposed would have been to destroy it. The question\r\nwhether the ministry should demand the king's consent to such a\r\ncreation, if necessary, was debated in the cabinet in September.\r\nBrougham proposed it, and gradually a majority of the cabinet were won\r\nover. Grey had at first refused to employ even the threat of so\r\nunconstitutional a device as a means to the proposed end. But his\r\ncontinued refusal would have broken up the ministry, and the breaking up\r\nof the ministry must now have been the signal for revolution. The second\r\nreading in the Commons was passed in December by a majority of 162, and\r\non New-Year's day 1832 the majority of the cabinet resolved on demanding\r\npower to carry it in the Lords by a creation of peers. Grey carried the\r\nresolution to the king. Some time still remained before the bill could\r\nbe committed and read a third time. It was not until the 9th of April\r\nthat Grey moved the second reading in the Lords. A sufficient number of\r\nthe opposition temporized; and the second reading was allowed to pass by\r\na majority of nine. Their intention was to mutilate the bill in\r\ncommittee. The Ultra-Tories, headed by the duke of Wellington, had\r\nentered a protest against the second reading, but they were now\r\npolitically powerless. The struggle had become a struggle on the one\r\nhand for the whole bill, to be carried by a creation of peers, and on\r\nthe other for some mutilated measure. Grey's instinct divined that the\r\ncrisis was approaching. Either the king must consent to swamp the House,\r\nor the ministry must cease to stand in the breach between the peers and\r\nthe country. The king, a weak and inexperienced politician, had in the\r\nmeantime been wrought upon by the temporizing leaders in the Lords. He\r\nwas induced to believe that if the Commons should reject the mutilated\r\nbill when it was returned to them, and the ministry should consequently\r\nretire, the mutilated bill might be reintroduced and passed by a Tory\r\nministry. He was deaf to all representations of the state of public\r\nopinion; and to the surprise of the ministry, and the terror and\r\nindignation of every man of sense in the country, he rejected their\r\nproposal and accepted their resignation, May 9, 1832. The duke of\r\nWellington undertook the hopeless task of constructing a ministry which\r\nshould pass a restricted or sham Reform Bill. The only man who could\r\nhave made the success of such a ministry even probable was Peel, and\r\nPeel's conscience and good sense forbade the attempt. He refused, and\r\nafter a week of the profoundest agitation throughout the country, the\r\nking, beaten and mortified, was forced to send for Grey and Brougham. On\r\nbeing told that his consent to the creation of peers was the only\r\ncondition on which they could undertake the government, he angrily and\r\nreluctantly yielded. The chancellor, with cool forethought, demanded\r\nthis consent in writing. Grey thought such a demand harsh and\r\nunnecessary. \"I wonder,\" he said to Brougham, when the interview was\r\nover, \"you could have had the heart to press it.\" But Brougham was\r\ninexorable, and the king signed the following paper: \"The king grants\r\npermission to Earl Grey, and to his chancellor, Lord Brougham, to create\r\nsuch a number of peers as will be sufficient to ensure the passing of\r\nthe Reform Bill, first calling up peers' eldest sons.--WILLIAM R.,\r\nWindsor, May 17, 1832.\"\r\n\r\nGrey had now won the game. There was no danger that he would have to\r\nresort to the expedient which he was authorized to employ. The\r\nintroduction of sixty new peers would have destroyed the opposition, but\r\nit would have been equivalent to the abolition of the House. The king's\r\nconsent made known, a sufficient number of peers were sure to withdraw\r\nto enable the bill to pass, and thus the dignity of both king and\r\npeerage would be saved. The duke of Wellington headed this movement on\r\nthe part of the opposition; and the third reading of the bill was\r\ncarried in the Lords by a majority of 84.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that in after years both Grey and Brougham disclaimed\r\nany intention of executing their threat. If this were so, they must have\r\nmerely pretended to brave a danger which they secretly feared to face,\r\nand intended to avoid; and the credit of rescuing the country would\r\nbelong to the duke of Wellington and the peers who seceded with him. To\r\nargue such cowardice in them from statements made when the crisis was\r\nlong past, and when they were naturally willing to palliate the rough\r\npolicy which they were forced to adopt, would be to set up a needless\r\nand unjustifiable paradox. Nothing else in the career of either Grey or\r\nBrougham leads us to suppose them capable of the moral baseness of\r\nyielding up the helm of state, in an hour of darkness and peril, to\r\nreckless and unskilled hands. Such would have been the result if they\r\nhad lacked the determination to carry out their programme to the end.\r\nThe influence of every statesman in the country would then have been\r\nextinguished, and the United Kingdom would have been absolutely in the\r\nhands of O'Connell and Orator Hunt.\r\n\r\nGrey took but little part in directing the legislation of the reformed\r\nparliament. Never anxious for power, he had executed the arduous task\r\nof 1831-1832 rather as a matter of duty than of inclination, and wished\r\nfor an opportunity of retiring. Such an opportunity very shortly\r\npresented itself. The Irish policy of the ministry had not conciliated\r\nthe Irish people, and O'Connell denounced them with the greatest\r\nbitterness. On the renewal of the customary Coercion Bill, the ministry\r\nwas divided on the question whether to continue to the lord-lieutenant\r\nthe power of suppressing public meetings. Littleton, the Irish\r\nsecretary, was for abolishing it; and with the view of conciliating\r\nO'Connell, he informed him that the ministry intended to abandon it. But\r\nthe result proved him to have been mistaken, and O'Connell, with some\r\nreason supposing himself to have been duped, called on Littleton to\r\nresign his secretaryship. It had also transpired in the discussion that\r\nLord Althorp, the leader of the House of Commons, was privately opposed\r\nto retaining those clauses which it was his duty to push through the\r\nhouse. Lord Althorp therefore resigned, and Grey, who had lately passed\r\nhis seventieth year, took the opportunity of resigning also. It was his\r\nopinion, it appeared, which had overborne the cabinet in favour of the\r\npublic meeting clauses; and his voluntary withdrawal enabled Lord\r\nAlthorp to return to his post and to proceed with the bill in its milder\r\nform. Grey was succeeded by Lord Melbourne; but no other change was made\r\nin the cabinet. Grey took no further part in politics. During most of\r\nhis remaining years he continued to live in retirement at Howick, where\r\nhe died on the 17th of July 1845, in his eighty-second year. By his wife\r\nMary Elizabeth, only daughter of the first Lord Ponsonby, whom he\r\nmarried on the 18th of November 1794, he became the father of ten sons\r\nand five daughters. Grey's eldest son Henry (q.v.) became the 3rd earl,\r\nand among his other sons were General Charles Grey (1804-1870) and\r\nAdmiral Frederick Grey (1805-1878).\r\n\r\nIn public life, Grey could always be upon occasion bold, strenuous and\r\nself-sacrificing; but he was little disposed for the active work of the\r\npolitician. He was not one of those who took the statesman's duty \"as a\r\npleasure he was to enjoy.\" A certain stiffness and reserve ever seemed\r\nin the popular eye to hedge him in; nor was his oratory of the kind\r\nwhich stirs enthusiasm and delight. A tall, stately figure, fine voice\r\nand calm aristocratic bearing reminded the listener of Pitt rather than\r\nof Fox, and his speeches were constructed on the Attic rather than the\r\nAsiatic model. Though simple and straightforward, they never lacked\r\neither point or dignity; and they were admirably adapted to the audience\r\nto which they were addressed. The scrupulous uprightness of Grey's\r\npolitical and private character completed the ascendancy which he\r\ngained; and no politician could be named who, without being a statesman\r\nof the highest class, has left a name more enviably placed in English\r\nhistory.     (E. J. P.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREY, SIR EDWARD, 3rd Bart. (1862-   ), English statesman, was educated\r\nat Winchester and at Balliol College, Oxford, and succeeded his\r\ngrandfather, the 2nd baronet, at the age of twenty. He entered the House\r\nof Commons as Liberal member for Berwick-on-Tweed in 1885, but he was\r\nbest known as a country gentleman with a taste for sport, and as amateur\r\nchampion tennis-player. His interest in politics was rather languid, but\r\nhe was a disciple of Lord Rosebery, and in the 1892-1895 Liberal\r\nministry he was under-secretary for foreign affairs. In this position he\r\nearned a reputation as a politician of thorough straightforwardness and\r\ngrit, and as one who would maintain British interests independently of\r\nparty; and he shared with Mr Asquith the reputation of being the ablest\r\nof the Imperialists who followed Lord Rosebery. Though outside foreign\r\naffairs he played but a small part in the period of Liberal opposition\r\nbetween 1895 and 1905, he retained public confidence as one who was\r\nindispensable to a Liberal administration. When Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman's cabinet was formed in December 1905 he became\r\nforeign minister, and he retained this office when in April 1908 Mr\r\nAsquith became prime minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREY, SIR GEORGE (1812-1898), British colonial governor and statesman,\r\nonly son of Lieutenant-Colonel Grey of the 30th Foot, was born in Lisbon\r\non the 14th of April 1812, eight days after the death of his father at\r\nthe storming of Badajoz. He passed through Sandhurst with credit, and\r\nreceived his commission in 1829. His lieutenancy was dated 1833, and his\r\ncaptaincy 1839, in which year he sold out and left the army. In the\r\nearly 'thirties he was quartered in Ireland, where the wretchedness of\r\nthe poorer classes left a deep impression on his mind. In 1836 the Royal\r\nGeographical Society accepted his offer to explore the north-west region\r\nof West Australia, and accordingly he landed at Hanover Bay at the end\r\nof 1837. The surrounding country he found broken and difficult, and his\r\nhardships were aggravated by the tropical heat and his ignorance of the\r\ncontinent. In a skirmish with the natives, in which he was speared near\r\nthe hip, he showed great courage, and put the assailants to flight,\r\nshooting the chief, who had wounded him. After a brave endeavour to\r\ncontinue his journey his wound forced him to retreat to the coast,\r\nwhence he sailed to Mauritius to recruit. Next year he again essayed\r\nexploration, this time on the coast to the north and south of Shark's\r\nBay. He had three whale-boats and an ample supply of provisions, but by\r\na series of disasters his stores were spoilt by storms, his boats\r\nwrecked in the surf, and the party had to tramp on foot from Gantheaume\r\nBay to Perth, where Grey, in the end, walked in alone, so changed by\r\nsuffering that friends did not know him. In 1839 he was appointed\r\ngovernor-resident at Albany, and during his stay there married Harriett,\r\ndaughter of Admiral Spencer, and also prepared for publication an\r\naccount, in two volumes, of his expeditions. In 1840 he returned to\r\nEngland, to be immediately appointed by Lord John Russell to succeed\r\nColonel Gawler as governor of South Australia. Reaching the colony in\r\nMay 1841, he found it in the depths of a depression caused by\r\nmismanagement and insane land speculation. By rigorously reducing public\r\nexpenditure, and forcing the settlers to quit the town and betake\r\nthemselves to tilling their lands, and with the opportune help of\r\nvaluable copper discoveries, Grey was able to aid the infant colony to\r\nemerge from the slough. So striking were his energy and determination\r\nthat when, in 1845, the little settlements in New Zealand were found to\r\nbe involved in a native war, and on the verge of ruin, he was sent to\r\nsave them. The Maori chiefs in open rebellion were defeated, and made\r\ntheir submission. Another powerful leader suspected of fomenting\r\ndiscontent was arrested, and friendly chieftains were subsidized and\r\nhonoured. Bands of the natives were employed in making government roads,\r\nand were paid good wages. The governor gained the veneration of the\r\nMaori tribes, in whose welfare he took a close personal interest, and of\r\nwhose legends and myths he made a valuable and scholarly collection,\r\npublished in New Zealand in 1855 and reprinted thirty years afterwards.\r\nWith peace prosperity came to New Zealand, and the colonial office\r\ndesired to give the growing settlements full self-government. Grey,\r\narguing that this would renew war with the Maori, returned the\r\nconstitution to Downing Street. But though the colonial office sustained\r\nhim, he became involved in harassing disputes with the colonists, who\r\norganized an active agitation for autonomy. In the end a second\r\nconstitution, partly framed by Grey himself, was granted them, and Grey,\r\nafter eight years of despotic but successful rule, was transferred to\r\nCape Colony. He had been knighted for his services, and had undoubtedly\r\nshown strength, dexterity and humanity in dealing with the whites and\r\nnatives. In South Africa his success continued. He thwarted a formidable\r\nKaffir rebellion in the Eastern Provinces, and pushed on the work of\r\nsettlement by bringing out men from the German Legion and providing them\r\nwith homes. He gained the respect of the British, the confidence of the\r\nBoers, the admiration and the trust of the natives. The Dutch of the\r\nFree State and the Basuto chose him as arbitrator of their quarrels.\r\nWhen the news of the Indian Mutiny reached Cape Town he strained every\r\nnerve to help Lord Canning, despatching men, horses, stores and L60,000\r\nin specie to Bombay. He persuaded a detachment, then on its way round\r\nthe Cape as a reinforcement for Lord Elgin in China, to divert its\r\nvoyage to Calcutta. Finally, in 1859, Grey almost reached what would\r\nhave been the culminating point of his career by federating South\r\nAfrica. Persuaded by him, the Orange Free State passed resolutions in\r\nfavour of this great step, and their action was welcomed by Cape Town.\r\nBut the colonial office disapproved of the change, and when Grey\r\nattempted to persevere with it Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton recalled him. A\r\nchange of ministry during his voyage to England displaced Sir Edward\r\nBulwer Lytton. But though the duke of Newcastle reinstated Grey, it was\r\nwith instructions to let federation drop. In 1861 the colonial office\r\nsent him, for the fourth time in succession, to take up a post of\r\nexceptional difficulty by again entrusting him with the governorship of\r\nNew Zealand, where an inglorious native war in Taranaki had just been\r\nsucceeded by an armed truce. Grey did his best to make terms with the\r\nrebels and to re-establish friendship with the Maori king and the land\r\nleague of tribes formed to stop further sales of land to the whites. But\r\nthe Maori had got guns and powder, and were suspicious and truculent. In\r\nvain Grey, supported by Bishop Selwyn and by Fox and the peace party\r\namong the settlers, strove to avert war. It came in 1863, and spread\r\nfrom province to province. Ten thousand regulars and as many colonial\r\nriflemen were employed to put it down. The imperial troops were badly\r\nhandled, and Grey, losing patience, became involved in bitter disputes\r\nwith their commanders. As an example to the former he himself attacked\r\nand captured Weraroa, the strongest of the Maori stockades, with a\r\nhandful of militia, a feat which delighted the colonists, but made him\r\nas much disliked at the war office as he now was at Downing Street.\r\nMoreover, Grey had no longer real control over the islands. New Zealand\r\nhad become a self-governing colony, and though he vindicated the\r\ncolonists generally when libellous imputations of cruelty and\r\nland-grabbing were freely made against them in London, he crossed swords\r\nwith his ministers when the latter confiscated three million acres of\r\ntribal land belonging to the insurgent Maori. Yet through all these\r\ntroubles progress was made; many successes were gained in 1866, chiefly\r\nby the colonial militia, and a condition of something like tranquillity\r\nhad been reached in 1867, when he received a curt intimation from the\r\nduke of Buckingham that he was about to be superseded. The colonists,\r\nwho believed he was sacrificed for upholding their interests and good\r\nname, bade farewell to him in 1868 in an outburst of gratitude and\r\nsympathy; but his career as a colonial governor was at an end. Returning\r\nto England, he tried to enter public life, delivered many able speeches\r\nadvocating what later came to be termed Imperialism, and stood for\r\nNewark. Discouraged, however, by the official Liberals, he withdrew and\r\nturned again to New Zealand. In 1872 he was given a pension of L1000 a\r\nyear, and settled down on the island of Kawau, not far from Auckland,\r\nwhich he bought, and where he passed his leisure in planting, gardening\r\nand collecting books. In 1875, on the invitation of the Auckland\r\nsettlers, he became superintendent of their province, and entered the\r\nNew Zealand House of Representatives to resist the abolition of the\r\nprovincial councils of the colony, a change then being urged on by Sir\r\nJulius Vogel in alliance with the Centralist Party. In this he failed,\r\nbut his eloquence and courage drew round him a strong Radical following,\r\nand gave him the premiership in 1877. Manhood suffrage, triennial\r\nparliaments, a land-tax, the purchase of large estates and the popular\r\nelection of the governor, were leading points of his policy. All these\r\nreforms, except the last, he lived to see carried; none of them were\r\npassed by him. A commercial depression in 1879 shook his popularity, and\r\non the fall of his ministry in 1879 he was deposed, and for the next\r\nfifteen years remained a solitary and pathetic figure in the New Zealand\r\nparliament, respectfully treated, courteously listened to, but never\r\nagain invited to lead. In 1891 he came before Australia as one of the\r\nNew Zealand delegates to the federal convention at Sydney, and\r\ncharacteristically made his mark by standing out almost alone for \"one\r\nman one vote\" as the federal franchise. This point he carried, and the\r\nAustralians thronged to hear him, so that his visits to Victoria and\r\nSouth Australia were personal triumphs. When, too, in 1894, he quitted\r\nNew Zealand for London, some reparation was at last made him by the\r\nimperial government; he was called to the privy council, and graciously\r\nreceived by Queen Victoria on his visit to Windsor. Thereafter he lived\r\nin London, and died on the 20th of September 1898. He was given a public\r\nfuneral at St Paul's. Grey was all his life a collector of books and\r\nmanuscripts. After leaving Cape Colony, he gave his library to Cape Town\r\nin 1862; his subsequent collection, which numbered 12,000 volumes, he\r\npresented to the citizens of Auckland in 1887. In gratitude the people\r\nof Cape Town erected a statue of him opposite their library building.\r\n\r\n  _Lives_ of Sir George Grey have been written by W. L. and L. Rees\r\n  (1892), Professor G. C. Henderson (1907) and J. Collier (1909).\r\n       (W. P. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREY, HENRY GREY, 3RD EARL (1802-1894), English statesman, was born on\r\nthe 28th of December 1802, the son of the 2nd Earl Grey, prime minister\r\nat the time of the Reform Bill of 1832. He entered parliament in 1826,\r\nunder the title of Viscount Howick, as member for Winchelsea, which\r\nconstituency he left in 1831 for Northumberland. On the accession of the\r\nWhigs to power in 1830 he was made under-secretary for the colonies, and\r\nlaid the foundation of his intimate acquaintance with colonial\r\nquestions. He belonged at the time to the more advanced party of\r\ncolonial reformers, sharing the views of Edward Gibbon Wakefield on\r\nquestions of land and emigration, and resigned in 1834 from\r\ndissatisfaction that slave emancipation was made gradual instead of\r\nimmediate. In 1835 he entered Lord Melbourne's cabinet as secretary at\r\nwar, and effected some valuable administrative reforms, especially by\r\nsuppressing malpractices detrimental to the troops in India. After the\r\npartial reconstruction of the ministry in 1839 he again resigned,\r\ndisapproving of the more advanced views of some of his colleagues. These\r\nrepeated resignations gave him a reputation for crotchetiness, which he\r\ndid not decrease by his disposition to embarrass his old colleagues by\r\nhis action on free trade questions in the session of 1841. During the\r\nexile of the Liberals from power he went still farther on the path of\r\nfree trade, and anticipated Lord John Russell's declaration against the\r\ncorn laws. When, on Sir Robert Peel's resignation in December 1845, Lord\r\nJohn Russell was called upon to form a ministry, Howick, who had become\r\nEarl Grey by the death of his father in the preceding July, refused to\r\nenter the new cabinet if Lord Palmerston were foreign secretary (see J.\r\nR. Thursfield in vol. i. and Hon. F. H. Baring in vol. xxiii. of the\r\n_English Historical Review_). He was greatly censured for perverseness,\r\nand particularly when in the following July he accepted Lord Palmerston\r\nas a colleague without remonstrance. His conduct, nevertheless, afforded\r\nLord John Russell an escape from an embarrassing situation. Becoming\r\ncolonial secretary in 1846, he found himself everywhere confronted with\r\narduous problems, which in the main he encountered with success. His\r\nadministration formed an epoch. He was the first minister to proclaim\r\nthat the colonies were to be governed for their own benefit and not for\r\nthe mother-country's; the first systematically to accord them\r\nself-government so far as then seemed possible; the first to introduce\r\nfree trade into their relations with Great Britain and Ireland. The\r\nconcession by which colonies were allowed to tax imports from the\r\nmother-country _ad libitum_ was not his; he protested against it, but\r\nwas overruled. In the West Indies he suppressed, if he could not\r\novercome, discontent; in Ceylon he put down rebellion; in New Zealand he\r\nsuspended the constitution he had himself accorded, and yielded\r\neverything into the masterful hands of Sir George Grey. The least\r\nsuccessful part of his administration was his treatment of the convict\r\nquestion at the Cape of Good Hope, which seemed an exception to his rule\r\nthat the colonies were to be governed for their own benefit and in\r\naccordance with their own wishes, and subjected him to a humiliating\r\ndefeat. After his retirement he wrote a history and defence of his\r\ncolonial policy in the form of letters to Lord John Russell, a dry but\r\ninstructive book (_Colonial Policy of Lord John Russell's\r\nAdministration_, 1853). He resigned with his colleagues in 1852. No room\r\nwas found for him in the Coalition Cabinet of 1853, and although during\r\nthe Crimean struggle public opinion pointed to him as the fittest man as\r\nminister for war, he never again held office. During the remainder of\r\nhis long life he exercised a vigilant criticism on public affairs. In\r\n1858 he wrote a work (republished in 1864) on parliamentary reform; in\r\n1888 he wrote another on the state of Ireland; and in 1892 one on the\r\nUnited States tariff. In his latter years he was a frequent contributor\r\nof weighty letters to _The Times_ on land, tithes, currency and other\r\npublic questions. His principal parliamentary appearances were when he\r\nmoved for a committee on Irish affairs in 1866, and when in 1878 he\r\npassionately opposed the policy of the Beaconsfield cabinet in India. He\r\nnevertheless supported Lord Beaconsfield at the dissolution, regarding\r\nMr Gladstone's accession to power with much greater alarm. He was a\r\ndetermined opponent of Mr Gladstone's Home Rule policy. He died on the\r\n9th of October 1894. None ever doubted his capacity or his\r\nconscientiousness, but he was generally deemed impracticable and\r\ndisagreeable. Prince Albert, however, who expressed himself as ready to\r\nsubscribe to all Grey's principles, and applauded him for having\r\nprinciples, told Stockmar that, although dogmatic, he was amenable to\r\nargument; and Sir Henry Taylor credits him with \"more freedom from\r\nlittlenesses of feeling than I have met before in any public man.\" His\r\nchief defect was perceived and expressed by his original tutor and\r\nsubsequent adversary in colonial affairs, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who\r\nwrote, \"With more than a common talent for understanding principles, he\r\nhas no originality of thought, which compels him to take all his ideas\r\nfrom somebody; and no power of working out theory in practice, which\r\ncompels him to be always in somebody's hands as respects decision and\r\naction.\"\r\n\r\nThe earl had no sons, and he was followed as 4th earl by his nephew\r\nAlbert Henry George (b. 1851), who in 1904 became governor-general of\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREY, LADY JANE (1537-1554), a lady remarkable no less for her\r\naccomplishments than for her misfortunes, was the great-granddaughter of\r\nHenry VII. of England. Her descent from that king was traced through a\r\nline of females. His second daughter Mary, after being left a widow by\r\nLouis XII. of France, married Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, who was\r\na favourite with her brother King Henry VIII. Of this marriage came two\r\ndaughters, the elder of whom, Lady Frances Brandon, was married to Henry\r\nGrey, marquess of Dorset; and their issue, again, consisted of daughters\r\nonly. Lady Jane, the subject of this article, was the eldest of three\r\nwhom the marquess had by Lady Frances. Thus it will appear that even if\r\nthe crown of England had ever fallen into the female line of descent\r\nfrom Henry VII., she could not have put in a rightful claim unless the\r\nissue of his elder daughter, Margaret, had become extinct. But Margaret\r\nhad married James IV. of Scotland; and, though her descendant, James\r\nVI., was ultimately called to the English throne, Henry VIII. had placed\r\nher family after that of his second sister in the succession; so that,\r\nfailing the lawful issue of Henry himself, Lady Jane would, according to\r\nthis arrangement, have succeeded. It was to these circumstances that she\r\nowed her exceptional position in history, and became the victim of an\r\nambition which was not her own.\r\n\r\nShe was born at her father's seat named Bradgate in Leicestershire about\r\nthe year 1537. Her parents, though severe disciplinarians, bestowed more\r\nthan ordinary care upon her education, and she herself was so teachable\r\nand delighted so much in study that she became the marvel of the age for\r\nher acquirements. She not only excelled in needlework and in music, both\r\nvocal and instrumental, but while still very young she had thoroughly\r\nmastered Latin, Greek, French and Italian. She was able to speak and\r\nwrite both Greek and Latin with an accuracy that satisfied even such\r\ncritics as Ascham and her tutor Dr Aylmer, afterwards bishop of London.\r\nShe also acquired some knowledge of at least three Oriental tongues,\r\nHebrew, Chaldee and Arabic. In Ascham's _Schoolmaster_ is given a\r\ntouching account of the devotion with which she pursued her studies and\r\nthe harshness she experienced from her parents. The love of learning was\r\nher solace; in reading Demosthenes and Plato she found a refuge from\r\ndomestic unhappiness. When about ten years old she was placed for a time\r\nin the household of Thomas, Lord Seymour, who, having obtained her\r\nwardship, induced her parents to let her stay with him, even after the\r\ndeath of his wife, Queen Catherine Parr, by promising to marry her to\r\nhis nephew, King Edward VI. Lord Seymour, however, was attainted of high\r\ntreason and beheaded in 1549, and his brother, the duke of Somerset,\r\nmade some overtures to the marquess of Dorset to marry her to his son\r\nthe earl of Hertford. These projects, however, came to nothing. The duke\r\nof Somerset in his turn fell a victim to the ambition of Dudley, duke of\r\nNorthumberland, and was beheaded three years after his brother.\r\nMeanwhile, the dukedom of Suffolk having become extinct by the deaths of\r\nCharles Brandon and his two sons, the title was conferred upon the\r\nmarquess of Dorset, Lady Jane's father. Northumberland, who was now\r\nall-powerful, fearing a great reverse of fortune in case of the king's\r\ndeath, as his health began visibly to decline, endeavoured to strengthen\r\nhimself by marriages between his family and those of other powerful\r\nnoblemen, especially of the new-made duke of Suffolk. His three eldest\r\nsons being already married, the fourth, who was named Lord Guilford\r\nDudley, was accordingly wedded to Lady Jane Grey about the end of May\r\n1553. The match received the full approval of the king, who furnished\r\nthe wedding apparel of the parties by royal warrant. But Edward's state\r\nof health warned Northumberland that he must lose no time in putting the\r\nrest of his project into execution. He persuaded the king that if the\r\ncrown should descend to his sister Mary the work of the Reformation\r\nwould be undone and the liberties of the kingdom would be in danger.\r\nBesides, both Mary and her sister Elizabeth had been declared\r\nillegitimate by separate acts of parliament, and the objections to Mary\r\nqueen of Scots did not require to be pointed out. Edward was easily\r\npersuaded to break through his father's will and make a new settlement\r\nof the crown by deed. The document was witnessed by the signatures of\r\nall the council and of all but one of the judges; but those of the\r\nlatter body were obtained only with difficulty by threats and\r\nintimidation.\r\n\r\nEdward VI. died on the 6th July 1553, and it was announced to Lady Jane\r\nthat she was queen. She was then but sixteen years of age. The news came\r\nupon her as a most unwelcome surprise, and for some time she resisted\r\nall persuasions to accept the fatal dignity; but at length she yielded\r\nto the entreaties of her father, her father-in-law and her husband. The\r\nbetter to mature their plans the cabal had kept the king's death secret\r\nfor some days, but they proclaimed Queen Jane in the city on the 10th.\r\nThe people received the announcement with manifest coldness, and a\r\nvintner's boy was even so bold as to raise a cry for Queen Mary, for\r\nwhich he next day had his ears nailed to the pillory and afterwards cut\r\noff. Mary, however, had received early intimation of her brother's\r\ndeath, and, retiring from Hunsdon into Norfolk, gathered round her the\r\nnobility and commons of those parts. Northumberland was despatched\r\nthither with an army to oppose her; but after reaching Newmarket he\r\ncomplained that the council had not sent him forces in sufficient\r\nnumbers and his followers began to desert. News also came that the earl\r\nof Oxford had declared for Queen Mary; and as most of the council\r\nthemselves were only seeking an opportunity to wash their hands of\r\nrebellion, they procured a meeting at Baynard's Castle, revoked their\r\nformer acts as done under coercion, and caused the lord mayor to\r\nproclaim Queen Mary, which he did amid the shouts of the citizens. The\r\nduke of Suffolk was obliged to tell his daughter that she must lay aside\r\nher royal dignity and become a private person once more. She replied\r\nthat she relinquished most willingly a crown that she had only accepted\r\nout of obedience to him and her mother, and her nine days' reign was\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThe leading actors in the conspiracy were now called to answer for their\r\ndeeds. Northumberland was brought up to London a prisoner, tried and\r\nsent to the block, along with some of his partisans. The duke of Suffolk\r\nand Lady Jane were also committed to the Tower; but the former, by the\r\ninfluence of his duchess, procured a pardon. Lady Jane and her husband\r\nLord Guilford Dudley were also tried, and received sentence of death for\r\ntreason. This, however, was not immediately carried out; on the\r\ncontrary, the queen seems to have wished to spare their lives and\r\nmitigated the rigour of their confinement. Unfortunately, owing to the\r\ngeneral dislike of the queen's marriage with Philip of Spain, Sir Thomas\r\nWyat soon after raised a rebellion in which the duke of Suffolk and his\r\nbrothers took part, and on its suppression the queen was persuaded that\r\nit was unsafe to spare the lives of Lady Jane and her husband any\r\nlonger. On hearing that they were to die, Lady Jane declined a parting\r\ninterview with her husband lest it should increase their pain, and\r\nprepared to meet her fate with Christian fortitude. She and her husband\r\nwere executed on the same day, on the 12th of February 1554, her husband\r\non Tower Hill, and herself within the Tower an hour afterwards, amidst\r\nuniversal sympathy and compassion.\r\n\r\n  See Ascham's _Schoolmaster_; Burnet's _History of the Reformation_;\r\n  Howard's _Lady Jane Grey_; Nicolas's Literary _Remains of Lady Jane\r\n  Grey_; Tytler's _England under Edward VI. and Mary_; _The Chronicles\r\n  of Queen Jane_, ed.

The first Baron Grey de Wilton was\r\nReginald de Grey, who was summoned to parliament as a baron in 1295 and\r\nwho died in 1308. Reginald's son John, the 2nd baron (1268-1323), was\r\none of the lords ordainers in 1310 and was a prominent figure in English\r\npolitics during the reign of Edward II. The later barons Grey de Wilton\r\nwere descended from John's eldest son Henry (d. 1342), while a younger\r\nson Roger (d. 1353) was the ancestor of the barons Grey de Ruthyn.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM, 13TH LORD GREY DE WILTON (d. 1562), who succeeded to the title\r\non the death of his brother Richard, about 1520, won great fame as a\r\nsoldier by his conduct in France during the concluding years of Henry\r\nVIII.'s reign, and was one of the leaders of the victorious English army\r\nat the battle of Pinkie in 1547. He was then employed on the Scottish\r\nmarches and in Scotland, and in 1549 he rendered good service in\r\nsuppressing the rebellion in Oxfordshire and in the west of England; in\r\n1551 he was imprisoned as a friend of the fallen protector, the duke of\r\nSomerset, and he was concerned in the attempt made by John Dudley, duke\r\nof Northumberland, to place Lady Jane Grey on the English throne In\r\n1553. However, he was pardoned by Queen Mary and was entrusted with the\r\ndefence of Guines. Although indifferently supported he defended the town\r\nwith great gallantry, but in January 1558 he was forced to surrender and\r\nfor some time he remained a prisoner in France. Under Elizabeth, Grey\r\nwas again employed on the Scottish border, and he was responsible for\r\nthe pertinacious but unavailing attempt to capture Leith in May 1560. He\r\ndied at Cheshunt in Hertfordshire on the 14th/25th of December 1562.\r\n\r\n  He was described by William Cecil as \"a noble, valiant, painful and\r\n  careful gentleman,\" and his son and successor, Arthur, wrote _A\r\n  Commentary of the Services and Charges of William, Lord Grey of\r\n  Wilton, K.G._ This has been edited by Sir P. de M. Grey Egerton for\r\n  the Camden Society (1847).\r\n\r\nGrey's elder son ARTHUR, 14TH LORD GREY DE WILTON (1536-1593), was\r\nduring early life with his father in France and in Scotland; he fought\r\nat the battle of St Quentin and helped to defend Guines and to assault\r\nLeith. In July 1580 he was appointed lord deputy of Ireland, and after\r\nan initial defeat in Wicklow was successful in reducing many of the\r\nrebels to a temporary submission. Perhaps the most noteworthy event\r\nduring his tenure of this office was the massacre of 600 Italians and\r\nSpaniards at Smerwick in November 1580, an action for which he was\r\nresponsible. Having incurred a heavy burden of debt Grey frequently\r\nimplored the queen to recall him, and in August 1582 he was allowed to\r\nreturn to England (see E. Spenser, _View of the State of Ireland_,\r\nedited by H. Morley, 1890, and R. Bagwell, _Ireland under the Tudors_,\r\nvol. iii., 1890). While in Ireland Grey was served as secretary by\r\nEdmund Spenser, and in book v. of the _Faerie Queene_ the poet\r\nrepresents his patron as a knight of very noble qualities named\r\nArtegall. As one of the commissioners who tried Mary queen of Scots,\r\nGrey defended the action of Elizabeth's secretary, William Davison, with\r\nregard to this matter, and he took part in the preparations for the\r\ndefence of England against the Spaniards in 1588. His account of the\r\ndefence of Guines was used by Holinshed in his _Chronicles_.\r\n\r\nWhen he died on the 14th of October 1593 he was succeeded as 15th baron\r\nby his son THOMAS (d. 1614), who while serving in Ireland incurred the\r\nenmity of Robert Devereux, earl of Essex, and of Henry Wriothesley, earl\r\nof Southampton; and after fighting against Spain in the Netherlands he\r\nwas a member of the court which sentenced these two noblemen to death in\r\n1601. On the accession of James I. he was arrested for his share in the\r\n\"Bye\" plot, an attempt made by William Watson and others to seize the\r\nking. He was tried and sentenced to death, but the sentence was not\r\ncarried out and he remained in prison until his death on the 9th of July\r\n1614. He displayed both ability and courage at his trial, remarking\r\nafter sentence had been passed, \"the house of Wilton hath spent many\r\nlives in their prince's service and Grey cannot beg his.\" Like his\r\nfather Grey was a strong Puritan. He left no children and his barony\r\nbecame extinct.\r\n\r\n  In 1784 Sir Thomas Egerton, Bart., a descendant in the female line of\r\n  the 14th baron, was created Baron Grey de Wilton. He died without sons\r\n  in September 1814, when his barony became extinct; but the titles of\r\n  Viscount Grey de Wilton and earl of Wilton, which had been conferred\r\n  upon him in 1801, passed to Thomas Grosvenor (1799-1882), the second\r\n  son of his daughter Eleanor (d. 1846); and her husband Robert\r\n  Grosvenor, 1st marquess of Westminster. Thomas took the name of\r\n  Egerton and his descendants still hold the titles.\r\n\r\nROGER GREY, 1ST BARON GREY DE RUTHYN, who was summoned to parliament as\r\na baron in 1324, saw much service as a soldier before his death on the\r\n6th of March 1353. The second baron was his son Reginald, whose son\r\nREGINALD (c. 1362-1440) succeeded to the title on his father's death in\r\nJuly 1388. In 1410 after a long dispute the younger Reginald won the\r\nright to bear the arms of the Hastings family. He enjoyed the favour\r\nboth of Richard II. and Henry IV., and his chief military exploits were\r\nagainst the Welsh, who took him prisoner in 1402 and only released him\r\nupon payment of a heavy ransom. Grey was a member of the council which\r\ngoverned England during the absence of Henry V. in France in 1415; he\r\nfought in the French wars in 1420 and 1421 and died on the 30th of\r\nSeptember 1440. His eldest son, Sir John Grey, K.G. (d. 1439), who\r\npredeceased his father, fought at Agincourt and was deputy of Ireland in\r\n1427. He was the father of EDMUND GREY (d. 1489), who succeeded his\r\ngrandfather as Lord Grey de Ruthyn in 1440 and was created earl of Kent\r\nin 1465.\r\n\r\n  One of Reginald Grey's younger sons, Edward (1415-1457), succeeded his\r\n  maternal grandfather as Baron Ferrers of Groby in 1445. He was the\r\n  ancestor of the earls of Stamford and also of the Greys, marquesses of\r\n  Dorset and dukes of Suffolk.\r\n\r\n  The barony of Grey de Ruthyn was merged in the earldom of Kent until\r\n  the death of Henry, the 8th earl, in November 1639. It then devolved\r\n  upon Kent's nephew Charles Longueville (1612-1643), through whose\r\n  daughter Susan (d. 1676) it came to the family of Yelverton, who were\r\n  earls of Sussex from 1717 to 1799. The next holder was Henry Edward\r\n  Gould (1780-1810), a grandson of Henry Yelverton, earl of Sussex; and\r\n  through Gould's daughter Barbara, marchioness of Hastings (d. 1858),\r\n  it passed to the last marquess of Hastings, on whose death in 1868 the\r\n  barony fell into abeyance, this being terminated in 1885 in favour of\r\n  Hastings's sister Bertha (d. 1887), the wife of Augustus Wykeham\r\n  Clifton. Their son, Rawdon George Grey Clifton (b. 1858), succeeded\r\n  his mother as 24th holder of the barony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREYMOUTH, a seaport of New Zealand, the principal port on the west\r\ncoast of South Island, in Grey county. Pop. (1906) 4569. It stands on\r\nthe small estuary of the Grey or Mawhera river, has a good harbour, and\r\nrailway communication with Hokitika, Reefton, &c., while the\r\nconstruction of a line to connect with Christchurch and Nelson was begun\r\nin 1887. The district is both auriferous and coal-bearing. Gold-dredging\r\nis a rich industry, and the coal-mines have attendant industries in\r\ncoke, bricks and fire-clay. The timber trade is also well developed. The\r\nneighbouring scenery is picturesque, especially among the hills\r\nsurrounding Lake Brunner (15 m. S.E.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREYTOWN (SAN JUAN DEL NORTE), the principal seaport on the Caribbean\r\ncoast of Nicaragua, in the extreme south-eastern corner of the republic,\r\nand at the mouth of the northern channel of the San Juan river delta.\r\nPop. (1905) about 2500. The town occupies the seaward side of a narrow\r\npeninsula, formed by the windings of the river. Most of its houses are\r\nraised on piles 2 or 3 ft. above the ground. The neighbourhood is\r\nunhealthy and unsuited for agriculture, so that almost all food-stuffs\r\nmust be imported, and the cost of living is high. Greytown has suffered\r\nseverely from the accumulation of sand in its once fine harbour. Between\r\n1832 and 1848 Point Arenas, the seaward end of the peninsula, was\r\nenlarged by a sandbank more than 1 m. long; between 1850 and 1875 the\r\ndepth of water over the bar decreased from about 25 ft. to 5 ft., and\r\nthe entrance channel, which had been nearly 1/2 m. wide, was almost\r\nclosed. Subsequent attempts to improve the harbour by dredging and\r\nbuilding jetties have only had partial success; but Greytown remains the\r\nheadquarters of Nicaraguan commerce with Europe and eastern America. The\r\nvillage called America, 1 m. N., was built as the eastern terminus of a\r\nproposed interoceanic canal.\r\n\r\nThe harbour of San Juan, discovered by Columbus, was brought into\r\nfurther notice by Captain Diego Machuca, who in 1529 sailed down the\r\nriver from Lake Nicaragua. The date of the first Spanish settlement on\r\nthe spot is not known, but in the 17th century there were fortifications\r\nat the mouth of the river. In 1796 San Juan was made a port of entry by\r\nroyal charter, and new defences were erected in 1821. In virtue of the\r\nprotectorate claimed by Great Britain over the Mosquito Coast (q.v.),\r\nthe Mosquito Indians, aided by a British force, seized the town in 1848\r\nand occupied it until 1860, when Great Britain ceded its protectorate to\r\nNicaragua by the treaty of Managua. This treaty secured religious\r\nliberty and trial by jury for all civil and criminal charges in\r\nGreytown; its seventh article declared the port free, but was never\r\nenforced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREYWACKE, or GRAUWACKE (a German word signifying a grey earthy rock),\r\nthe designation, formerly more generally used by English geologists than\r\nat the present day, for impure, highly composite, gritty rocks belonging\r\nto the Palaeozoic systems. They correspond to the sandstones, grits and\r\nfine conglomerates of the later periods. Greywackes are mostly grey,\r\nbrown, yellow or black, dull-coloured, sandy rocks which may occur in\r\nthick or thin beds along with slates, limestones, &c., and are abundant\r\nin Wales, the south of Scotland and the Lake district of England. They\r\ncontain a very great variety of minerals, of which the principal are\r\nquartz, orthoclase and plagioclase, calcite, iron oxides and graphitic\r\ncarbonaceous matters, together with (in the coarser kinds) fragments of\r\nsuch rocks as felsite, chert, slate, gneiss, various schists, quartzite.\r\nAmong other minerals found in them are biotite and chlorite, tourmaline,\r\nepidote, apatite, garnet, hornblende and augite, sphene, pyrites. The\r\ncementing material may be siliceous or argillaceous, and is sometimes\r\ncalcareous. As a rule greywackes are not fossiliferous, but organic\r\nremains may be common in the finer beds associated with them. Their\r\ncomponent particles are usually not much rounded by attrition, and the\r\nrocks have often been considerably indurated by pressure and mineral\r\nchanges, such as the introduction of interstitial silica. In some\r\ndistricts the greywackes are cleaved, but they show phenomena of this\r\nkind much less perfectly than the slates. Although the group is so\r\ndiverse that it is difficult to characterize mineralogically, it has a\r\nwell-established place in petrographical classifications, because these\r\npeculiar composite arenaceous deposits are very frequent among Silurian\r\nand Cambrian rocks, and rarely occur in Secondary or Tertiary systems.\r\nTheir essential features are their gritty character and their complex\r\ncomposition. By increasing metamorphism greywackes frequently pass into\r\nmica-schists, chloride schists and sedimentary gneisses.     (J. S.

He entered the French royal artillery in 1732 as a\r\nvolunteer, and became an officer in 1735. For nearly twenty years\r\nregimental duty and scientific work occupied him, and in 1752 he became\r\ncaptain of a company of miners. A few years later he was employed in a\r\nmilitary mission in Prussia. In 1757, being then a lieutenant-colonel,\r\nhe was lent to the Austrian army on the outbreak of the Seven Years'\r\nWar, and served as a general officer of artillery. The siege of Glatz\r\nand the defence of Schweidnitz were his principal exploits. The empress\r\nMaria Theresa rewarded him for his work with the rank of lieutenant\r\nfield-marshal and the cross of the Maria Theresa order. On his return to\r\nFrance he was made _marechal de camp_, in 1764 inspector of artillery,\r\nand in 1765 lieutenant-general and commander of the order of St Louis.\r\nFor some years after this he was in disfavour at court, and he became\r\nfirst inspector of artillery only in 1776, in which year also he\r\nreceived the grand cross of the St Louis order.

He then obtained a commission in a hussar regiment, but\r\nresigned it in 1816. Next year he entered the civil service, and in 1818\r\nwas appointed secretary of the Russian legation in Persia, whence he was\r\ntransferred to Georgia. He had commenced writing early, and had produced\r\non the stage at St Petersburg in 1816 a comedy in verse, translated from\r\nthe French, called _The Young Spouses_, which was followed by other\r\npieces of the same kind. But neither these nor the essays and verses\r\nwhich he wrote would have been long remembered but for the immense\r\nsuccess gained by his comedy in verse, _Gore ot uma_, or \"Misfortune\r\nfrom Intelligence\" (Eng. trans. by N. Benardaky, 1857). A satire upon\r\nRussian society, or, as a high official styled it, \"A pasquinade on\r\nMoscow,\" its plot is slight, its merits consisting in its accurate\r\nrepresentation of certain social and official types--such as Famousoff,\r\nthe lover of old abuses, the hater of reforms; his secretary, Molchanin,\r\nservile fawner upon all in office; the aristocratic young liberal and\r\nAnglomaniac, Repetiloff; contrasted with whom is the hero of the piece,\r\nTchatsky, the ironical satirist, just returned from the west of Europe,\r\nwho exposes and ridicules the weaknesses of the rest, his words echoing\r\nthat outcry of the young generation of 1820 which reached its climax in\r\nthe military insurrection of 1825, and was then sternly silenced by\r\nNicholas. Griboyedov spent the summer of 1823 in Russia, completed his\r\nplay and took it to St Petersburg. There it was rejected by the\r\ncensorship. Many copies were made and privately circulated, but\r\nGriboyedov never saw it published. The first edition was printed in\r\n1833, four years after his death. Only once did he see it on the stage,\r\nwhen it was acted by the officers of the garrison at Erivan. Soured by\r\ndisappointment he returned to Georgia, made himself useful by his\r\nlinguistic knowledge to his relative Count Paskievitch-Erivansky during\r\na campaign against Persia, and was sent to St Petersburg with the treaty\r\nof 1828. Brilliantly received there, he thought of devoting himself to\r\nliterature, and commenced a romantic drama, _A Georgian Night_. But he\r\nwas suddenly sent to Persia as minister-plenipotentiary. Soon after his\r\narrival at Teheran a tumult arose, caused by the anger of the populace\r\nagainst some Georgian and Armenian captives--Russian subjects--who had\r\ntaken refuge in the Russian embassy. It was stormed, Griboyedov was\r\nkilled (February 11, 1829), and his body was for three days so\r\nill-treated by the mob that it was at last recognized only by an old\r\nscar on the hand, due to a wound received in a duel. It was taken to\r\nTiflis, and buried in the monastery of St David. There a monument was\r\nerected to his memory by his widow, to whom he had been but a few months\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIEG, EDVARD HAGERUP (1843-1907), Norwegian musical composer, was born\r\non the 15th of June 1843 in Bergen, where his father, Alexander Grieg\r\n(_sic_), was English consul. The Grieg family were of Scottish origin,\r\nbut the composer's grandfather, a supporter of the Pretender, left his\r\nhome at Aberdeen after Charles Edward's defeat at Culloden, and went to\r\nBergen, where he carried on business. The composer's mother, Gesine\r\nHagerup, belonged to a pure Norwegian peasant family; and it is from the\r\nmother rather than from the father that Edvard Grieg derived his musical\r\ntalent. She had been educated as a pianist and began to give her son\r\nlessons on the pianoforte when he was six years of age. His first\r\ncomposition, \"Variations on a German melody,\" was written at the age of\r\nnine. A summer holiday in Norway with his father in 1858 seems to have\r\nexercised a powerful influence on the child's musical imagination, which\r\nwas easily kindled at the sight of mountain and fjord. In the autumn of\r\nthe same year, at the recommendation of Ole Bull, young Grieg entered\r\nthe Leipzig Conservatorium, where he passed, like all his\r\ncontemporaries, under the influence of the Mendelssohn and Schumann\r\nschool of romantics. But the curriculum of academic study was too narrow\r\nfor him. He dreamed half his time away and overworked during the other\r\nhalf. In 1862 he completed his Leipzig studies, and appeared as pianist\r\nand composer before his fellow-citizens of Bergen. In 1863 he studied in\r\nCopenhagen for a short time with Gade and Emil Hartmann, both composers\r\nrepresenting a sentimental strain of Scandinavian temperament, from\r\nwhich Grieg emancipated himself in favour of the harder inspiration of\r\nRichard Nordraak. \"The scales fell from my eyes,\" says Grieg of his\r\nacquaintance with Nordraak. \"For the first time I learned through him to\r\nknow the northern folk tunes and my own nature. We made a pact to combat\r\nthe effeminate Gade-Mendelssohn mixture of Scandinavism, and boldly\r\nentered upon the new path along which the northern school at present\r\npursues its course.\" Grieg now made a kind of crusade in favour of\r\nnational music. In the winter of 1864-1865 he founded the Copenhagen\r\nconcert-society Euterpe, which was intended to produce the works of\r\nyoung Norwegian composers. During the winters of 1865-1866 and 1869-1870\r\nGrieg was in Rome. In the autumn of 1866 he settled in Christiania,\r\nwhere from 1867 till 1880 he conducted a musical union. From 1880 to\r\n1882 he directed the concerts of the Harmonic Society in Bergen. In 1872\r\nthe Royal Musical Academy of Sweden made Grieg a member; in 1874 the\r\nNorwegian Storthing granted him an annual stipend of 1600 kronen. He had\r\nalready been decorated with the Olaf order in 1873. In 1888 he played\r\nhis pianoforte concerto and conducted his \"two melodies for strings\" at\r\na Philharmonic concert in London, and visited England again in 1891,\r\n1894 and 1896, receiving the degree of Mus.D. from the university of\r\nCambridge in 1894. He died at Bergen on the 4th of September 1907.\r\n\r\nAs a composer Grieg's distinguishing quality is lyrical. Whether his\r\norchestral works or his songs or his best pianoforte works are submitted\r\nto examination, it is almost always the note of song that tells.\r\nSometimes, as in the music to Ibsen's _Peer Gynt_, or in the suite for\r\nstringed orchestra, _Aus Holbergs Zeit_, this characteristic is combined\r\nwith a strong power for raising pictures in the listener's mind, and the\r\nromantic \"programme\" tendency in Grieg's music becomes clearer the\r\nfarther writers like Richard Strauss carry this movement. Grieg's songs\r\nmay be said to be generally the more spontaneous the more closely they\r\nconform to the simple model of the _Volkslied_; yet the much sung \"Ich\r\nliebe dich\" is a song of a different kind, which has hardly ever been\r\nsurpassed for the perfection with which it depicts a strong momentary\r\nemotion, and it is difficult to ascribe greater merits to songs of Grieg\r\neven so characteristic as \"Solvejg's Lied\" and \"Ein Schwan.\" The\r\npianoforte concerto is brilliant and spontaneous; it has been performed\r\nby most pianists of the first rank, but its essential qualities and the\r\npure nationality of its themes have been brought out to their perfection\r\nby one player only--the Norwegian pianist Knudsen. The first and second\r\nof Grieg's violin sonatas are agreeable, so free and artless is the flow\r\nof their melody. In his numerous piano pieces and in those of his songs\r\nwhich are devoid of a definitely national inspiration the impression\r\nmade is less permanent. Bulow called Grieg the \"Chopin of the North.\"\r\nThe phrase is an exaggeration rather than an expression of the truth,\r\nfor the range of the appeal in Chopin is far wider, nor has the\r\nnational movement inaugurated by Grieg shown promise of great\r\ndevelopment. He is rather to be regarded as the pioneer of a musical\r\nmission which has been perfectly carried out by himself alone.\r\n\r\n  See La Mara, _Edvard Grieg_ (Leipzig, 1898).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIESBACH, JOHANN JAKOB (1745-1812), German biblical critic, was born at\r\nButzbach, a small town of Hesse-Darmstadt, where his father, Konrad\r\nKaspar (1705-1777), was pastor, on the 4th of January 1745. He was\r\neducated at Frankfort-on-the-Main, and at the universities of Tubingen,\r\nLeipzig and Halle, where he became one of J. S. Semler's most ardent\r\ndisciples. It was Semler who induced him to turn his attention to the\r\ntextual criticism of the New Testament. At the close of his\r\nundergraduate career he undertook a literary tour through Germany,\r\nHolland, France and England. On his return to Halle, he acted for some\r\ntime as _Privatdozent_, but in 1773 was appointed to a professorial\r\nchair; in 1775 he was translated to Jena, where the rest of his life was\r\nspent (though he received calls to other universities). He died on the\r\n24th of March 1812. Griesbach's fame rests upon his work in New\r\nTestament criticism, in which he inaugurated a new epoch.\r\n\r\n  His critical edition of the New Testament first appeared at Halle, in\r\n  three volumes, in 1774-1775. The first volume contained the first\r\n  three Gospels, synoptically arranged; the second, the Epistles and the\r\n  book of Revelation. All the historical books were reprinted in one\r\n  volume in 1777, the synoptical arrangement of the Gospels having been\r\n  abandoned as inconvenient. Of the second edition, considerably\r\n  enlarged and improved, the first volume appeared in 1796 and the\r\n  second in 1806 (Halle and London). Of a third edition, edited by David\r\n  Schulz, only the first volume, containing the four Gospels, appeared\r\n  (1827).\r\n\r\n  For the construction of his critical text Griesbach took as his basis\r\n  the Elzevir edition. Where he differed from it he placed the Elzevir\r\n  reading on the inner margin along with other readings he thought\r\n  worthy of special consideration (these last, however, being printed in\r\n  smaller type). To all the readings on this margin he attached special\r\n  marks indicating the precise degree of probability in his opinion\r\n  attaching to each. In weighing these probabilities he proceeded upon a\r\n  particular theory which in its leading features he had derived from J.\r\n  A. Bengel and J. S. Semler, dividing all the MSS. into three main\r\n  groups--the Alexandrian, the Western and the Byzantine (see BIBLE:\r\n  _New Testament_, \"Textual Criticism\"). A reading supported by only one\r\n  recension he considered as having only one witness in its favour;\r\n  those readings which were supported by all the three recensions, or\r\n  even by two of them, especially if these two were the Alexandrian and\r\n  the Western, he unhesitatingly accepted as genuine. Only when each of\r\n  the three recensions gives a different reading does he proceed to\r\n  discuss the question on other grounds. See his _Symbolae criticae ad\r\n  supplendas et corrigendas variarum N.T. lectionum collectiones_\r\n  (Halle, 1785, 1793), and his _Commentarius criticus in textum Graecum\r\n  N.T._, which extends to the end of Mark, and discusses the more\r\n  important various readings with great care and thoroughness (Jena,\r\n  1794 ff.). Among the other works of Griesbach (which are comparatively\r\n  unimportant) may be mentioned his university thesis _De codicibus\r\n  quatuor evangelistarum Origenianis_ (Halle, 1771) and a work upon\r\n  systematic theology (_Anleitung zur Kenntniss der popularen Dogmatik_,\r\n  Jena, 1779). His _Opuscula_, consisting chiefly of university\r\n  \"Programs\" and addresses, were edited by Gabler (2 vols., Jena, 1824).\r\n\r\n  See the article in Herzog-Hauck, _Realencyklopadie_, and the\r\n  _Allgemeine deutsche Biographie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIESBACH, a watering-place in the grand duchy of Baden, in the valley\r\nof the Rench, 1550 ft. above the sea, 6 m. W. from Freudenstadt in\r\nWurttemberg. It is celebrated for its saline chalybeate waters (twelve\r\nsprings), which are specific in cases of anaemia, feminine disorders and\r\ndiseases of the nervous system, and were used in the 16th century. The\r\nannual number of visitors is nearly 2000. Pop. (1900) 800. From 1665 to\r\n1805 Griesbach was part of the bishopric of Strassburg.\r\n\r\n  See Haberer, _Die Renchbader Petersthal und Griesbach_ (Wurzburg,\r\n  1866).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIFFE (French for \"claw\"), an architectural term for the spur, an\r\nornament carved at the angle of the square base of columns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIFFENFELDT, PEDER, COUNT (_Peder Schumacher_) (1635-1699), Danish\r\nstatesman, was born at Copenhagen on the 24th of August 1635, of a\r\nwealthy trading family connected with the leading civic, clerical and\r\nlearned circles in the Danish capital. His tutor, Jens Vorde, who\r\nprepared him in his eleventh year for the university, praises his\r\nextraordinary gifts, his mastery of the classical languages and his\r\nalmost disquieting diligence. The brilliant way in which he sustained\r\nhis preliminary examination won him the friendship of the examiner,\r\nBishop Jasper Brokman, at whose palace he first met Frederick III. The\r\nking was struck with the lad's bright grey eyes and pleasant humorous\r\nface; and Brokman, proud of his pupil, made him translate a chapter from\r\na Hebrew Bible first into Latin and then into Danish, for the\r\nentertainment of the scholarly monarch. In 1654 young Schumacher went\r\nabroad for eight years, to complete his education. From Germany he\r\nproceeded to the Netherlands, staying at Leiden, Utrecht and Amsterdam,\r\nand passing in 1657 to Queen's College, Oxford, where he lived three\r\nyears. The epoch-making events which occurred in England, while he was\r\nat Oxford, profoundly interested him, and coinciding with the Revolution\r\nin Denmark, which threw open a career to the middle classes, convinced\r\nhim that his proper sphere was politics. In the autumn of 1660\r\nSchumacher visited Paris, shortly after Mazarin's death, when the young\r\nLouis XIV. first seized the reins of power. Schumacher seems to have\r\nbeen profoundly impressed by the administrative superiority of a strong\r\ncentralised monarchy in the hands of an energetic monarch who knew his\r\nown mind; and, in politics, as in manners, France ever afterwards was\r\nhis model. The last year of his travels was spent in Spain, where he\r\nobtained a thorough knowledge of the Castilian language and literature.\r\nHis travels, however, if they enriched his mind, relaxed his character,\r\nand he brought home easy morals as well as exquisite manners.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Copenhagen, in 1662, Schumacher found the monarchy\r\nestablished on the ruins of the aristocracy, and eager to buy the\r\nservices of every man of the middle classes who had superior talents to\r\noffer. Determined to make his way in this \"new Promised Land,\" the young\r\nadventurer contrived to secure the protection of Kristoffer Gabel, the\r\nking's confidant, and in 1663 was appointed the royal librarian. A\r\nromantic friendship with the king's bastard, Count Ulric Frederick\r\nGyldenlove, consolidated his position. In 1665 Schumacher obtained his\r\nfirst political post as the king's secretary, and the same year composed\r\nthe memorable _Kongelov_ (see DENMARK: _History_). He was now a\r\npersonage at court, where he won all hearts by his amiability and\r\ngaiety; and in political matters also his influence was beginning to be\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Frederick III. (February 9th, 1670) Schumacher was the\r\nmost trusted of all the royal counsellors. He alone was aware of the\r\nexistence of the new throne of walrus ivory embellished with three\r\nsilver life-size lions, and of the new regalia, both of which treasures\r\nhe had, by the king's command, concealed in a vault beneath the royal\r\ncastle. Frederick III. had also confided to him a sealed packet\r\ncontaining the _Kongelov_, which was to be delivered to his successor\r\nalone. Schumacher had been recommended to his son by Frederick III. on\r\nhis death-bed. \"Make him a great man, but do it slowly!\" said Frederick,\r\nwho thoroughly understood the characters of his son and of his minister.\r\nChristian V. was, moreover, deeply impressed by the confidence which his\r\nfather had ever shown to Schumacher. When, on the 9th of February 1670,\r\nSchumacher delivered the _Kongelov_ to Christian V., the king bade all\r\nthose about him withdraw, and after being closeted a good hour with\r\nSchumacher, appointed him his \"Obergeheimesekreter.\" His promotion was\r\nnow almost disquietingly rapid. In May 1670 he received the titles of\r\nexcellency and privy councillor; in July of the same year he was\r\nennobled under the name of Griffenfeldt, deriving his title from the\r\ngold griffin with outspread wings which surmounted his escutcheon; in\r\nNovember 1673 he was created a count, a knight of the Elephant and,\r\nfinally, imperial chancellor. In the course of the next few months he\r\ngathered into his hands every branch of the government: he had reached\r\nthe apogee of his short-lived greatness.\r\n\r\nBut if his offices were manifold, so also were his talents. Seldom has\r\nany man united so many and such various gifts in his own person and\r\ncarried them so easily--a playful wit, a vivid imagination, oratorical\r\nand literary eloquence and, above all, a profound knowledge of human\r\nnature both male and female, of every class and rank, from the king to\r\nthe meanest citizen. He had captivated the accomplished Frederick III.\r\nby his literary graces and ingenious speculations; he won the obtuse and\r\nignorant Christian V. by saving him trouble, by acting and thinking for\r\nhim, and at the same time making him believe that he was thinking and\r\nacting for himself. Moreover, his commanding qualities were coupled with\r\nan organizing talent which made itself felt in every department of the\r\nstate, and with a marvellous adaptability which made him an ideal\r\ndiplomatist.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of May 1671 the dignities of count and baron were introduced\r\ninto Denmark \"to give lustre to the court\"; a few months later the order\r\nof the Danebrog was instituted as a fresh means of winning adherents by\r\nmarks of favour. Griffenfeldt was the originator of these new\r\ninstitutions. To him monarchy was the ideal form of government. But he\r\nhad also a political object. The aristocracy of birth, despite its\r\nreverses, still remained the elite of society; and Griffenfeldt, the son\r\nof a burgess as well as the protagonist of monarchy, was its most\r\ndetermined enemy. The new baronies and countships, owing their existence\r\nentirely to the crown, introduced a strong solvent into aristocratic\r\ncircles. Griffenfeldt saw that, in future, the first at court would be\r\nthe first everywhere. Much was also done to promote trade and industry,\r\nnotably by the revival of the _Kammer Kollegium_, or board of trade, and\r\nthe abolition of some of the most harmful monopolies. Both the higher\r\nand the provincial administrations were thoroughly reformed with the\r\nview of making them more centralized and efficient; and the positions\r\nand duties of the various magistrates, who now also received fixed\r\nsalaries, were for the first time exactly defined. But what Griffenfeldt\r\ncould create, Griffenfeldt could dispense with, and it was not long\r\nbefore he began to encroach upon the jurisdiction of the new departments\r\nof state by private conferences with their chiefs. Nevertheless it is\r\nindisputable that, under the single direction of this master-mind, the\r\nDanish state was now able, for a time, to utilize all its resources as\r\nit had never done before.\r\n\r\nIn the last three years of his administration, Griffenfeldt gave himself\r\nentirely to the conduct of the foreign policy of Denmark. It is\r\ndifficult to form a clear idea of this, first, because his influence was\r\nperpetually traversed by opposite tendencies; in the second place,\r\nbecause the force of circumstances compelled him, again and again, to\r\nshift his standpoint; and finally because personal considerations\r\nlargely intermingled with his foreign policy, and made it more elusive\r\nand ambiguous than it need have been. Briefly, Griffenfeldt aimed at\r\nrestoring Denmark to the rank of a great power. He proposed to\r\naccomplish this by carefully nursing her resources, and in the meantime\r\nsecuring and enriching her by alliances, which would bring in large\r\nsubsidies while imposing a minimum of obligations. Such a conditional\r\nand tentative policy, on the part of a second-rate power, in a period of\r\nuniversal tension and turmoil, was most difficult; but Griffenfeldt did\r\nnot regard it as impossible. The first postulate of such a policy was\r\npeace, especially peace with Denmark's most dangerous neighbour, Sweden.\r\nThe second postulate was a sound financial basis, which he expected the\r\nwealth of France to supply in the shape of subsidies to be spent on\r\narmaments. Above all things Denmark was to beware of making enemies of\r\nFrance and Sweden at the same time. An alliance, on fairly equal terms,\r\nbetween the three powers, would, in these circumstances, be the\r\nconsummation of Griffenfeldt's \"system\"; an alliance with France to the\r\nexclusion of Sweden would be the next best policy; but an alliance\r\nbetween France and Sweden, without the admission of Denmark, was to be\r\navoided at all hazards. Had Griffenfeldt's policy succeeded, Denmark\r\nmight have recovered her ancient possessions to the south and east\r\ncomparatively cheaply. But again and again he was overruled. Despite his\r\nopen protests and subterraneous counter-mining, war was actually\r\ndeclared against Sweden in 1675, and his subsequent policy seemed so\r\nobscure and hazardous to those who did not possess the clue to the\r\nperhaps purposely tangled skein, that the numerous enemies whom his\r\narrogance and superciliousness had raised up against him, resolved to\r\ndestroy him.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of March 1676, while on his way to the royal apartments,\r\nGriffenfeldt was arrested in the king's name and conducted to the\r\ncitadel, a prisoner of state. A minute scrutiny of his papers, lasting\r\nnearly six weeks, revealed nothing treasonable; but it provided the\r\nenemies of the fallen statesman with a deadly weapon against him in the\r\nshape of an entry in his private diary, in which he had imprudently\r\nnoted that on one occasion Christian V. in a conversation with a foreign\r\nambassador had \"spoken like a child.\" On the 3rd of May Griffenfeldt was\r\ntried not by the usual tribunal, in such cases the _Hojesteret_, or\r\nsupreme court, but by an extraordinary tribunal of 10 dignitaries, none\r\nof whom was particularly well disposed towards the accused.\r\nGriffenfeldt, who was charged with simony, bribery, oath-breaking,\r\nmalversation and _lese-majeste_, conducted his own defence under every\r\nimaginable difficulty. For forty-six days before his trial he had been\r\nclosely confined in a dungeon without lights, books or writing\r\nmaterials. Every legal assistance was illegally denied him. Nevertheless\r\nhe proved more than a match for the forensic ability arrayed against\r\nhim, and his first plea in defence is in a high degree dignified and\r\nmanly. Finally, he was condemned to degradation and decapitation; though\r\none of the ten judges not only refused to sign the sentence, but\r\nremonstrated in private with the king against its injustice. And indeed\r\nits injustice was flagrant. The primary offence of the ex-chancellor was\r\nthe taking of bribes, which no twisting of the law could convert into a\r\ncapital offence, while the charge of treason had not been substantiated.\r\nGriffenfeldt was pardoned on the scaffold, at the very moment when the\r\naxe was about to descend. On hearing that the sentence was commuted to\r\nlife-long imprisonment, he declared that the pardon was harder than the\r\npunishment, and vainly petitioned for leave to serve his king for the\r\nrest of his life as a common soldier. For the next two and twenty years\r\nDenmark's greatest statesman lingered out his life in a lonely\r\nstate-prison, first in the fortress of Copenhagen, and finally at\r\nMunkholm on Trondhjem fiord. He died at Trondhjem on the 12th of March\r\n1699. Griffenfeldt married Kitty Nansen, the granddaughter of the great\r\nBurgomaster Hans Nansen, who brought him half a million rix-dollars. She\r\ndied in 1672, after bearing him a daughter.\r\n\r\n  See _Danmark's Riges Histoire_, vol. v.

B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIFFIN [O'GRIOBTA, O'GREEVA], GERALD (1803-1840), Irish novelist and\r\ndramatic writer, was born at Limerick of good family, on the 12th of\r\nDecember 1803. His parents emigrated in 1820 to America, but he was left\r\nwith an elder brother, who was a medical practitioner at Adare. As early\r\nas his eighteenth year he undertook for a short time the editorship of a\r\nnewspaper in Limerick. Having written a tragedy, _Aguire_, which was\r\nhighly praised by his friends, he set out in 1823 for London with the\r\npurpose of \"revolutionizing the dramatic taste of the time by writing\r\nfor the stage.\" In spite of the recommendations of John Banim, he had a\r\nhard struggle with poverty. It was only by degrees that his literary\r\nwork obtained any favour. _The Noyades_, an opera entirely in\r\nrecitative, was produced at the English Opera House in 1826; and the\r\nsuccess of _Holland Tide Tales_ (1827) led to _Tales of the Munster\r\nFestivals_ (3 vols., 1827), which were still more popular. In 1829\r\nappeared his fine novel, _The Collegians_, afterwards successfully\r\nadapted for the stage by Dion Boucicault under the title of _The Colleen\r\nBawn_. He followed up this success with _The Invasion_ (1832), _Tales of\r\nmy Neighbourhood_ (1835), _The Duke of Monmouth_ (1836), and _Talis\r\nQualis, or Tales of the Jury-room_ (1842). He also wrote a number of\r\nlyrics touched with his native melancholy. But he became doubtful as to\r\nthe moral influence of his writings, and ultimately he came to the\r\nconclusion that his true sphere of duty was to be found within the\r\nChurch. He was admitted into a society of the Christian Brothers at\r\nDublin, in September 1838, under the name of Brother Joseph, and in the\r\nfollowing summer he removed to Cork, where he died of typhus fever on\r\nthe 12th of June 1840. Before adopting the monastic habit he burned all\r\nhis manuscripts; but _Gisippus_, a tragedy which he had composed before\r\nhe was twenty, accidentally escaped destruction, and in 1842 was put on\r\nthe Drury Lane stage by Macready with great success.\r\n\r\n  The collected works of Gerald Griffin were published in 1842-1843 in\r\n  eight volumes, with a _Life_ by his brother William Griffin, M.D.; an\r\n  edition of his _Poetical and Dramatic Works_ (Dublin, 1895) by C. G.\r\n  Duffy; and a selection of his lyrics, with a notice by George\r\n  Sigerson, is included in the _Treasury of Irish Poetry_, edited by\r\n  Stopford A. Brooke and T. W. Rolleston (London, 1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIFFIN, a city and the county-seat of Spalding county, Georgia, U.S.A.,\r\n43 m. S. of Atlanta, and about 970 ft. above the sea. Pop. (1890) 4503;\r\n(1900) 6857 (3258 negroes); (1910) 7478. It is served by the Southern\r\nand the Central of Georgia railways, and is the southern terminus of the\r\nGriffin & Chattanooga Division of the latter. The city is situated in a\r\nrich agricultural region, and just outside the corporate limits is an\r\nagricultural experiment station, established by the state but maintained\r\nby the Federal government. Griffin has a large trade in cotton and\r\nfruit. The principal industry is the manufacture of cotton and\r\ncotton-seed oil. Buggies, wagons, chairs and harness are among the other\r\nmanufactures. The municipality owns and operates the water and\r\nelectric-lighting systems. Griffin was founded in 1840 and was chartered\r\nas a city in 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIFFIN, GRIFFON or GRYPHON (from Fr. _griffon_, Lat. _gryphus_, Gr.\r\n[Greek: gryps]), in the natural history of the ancients, the name of an\r\nimaginary rapacious creature of the eagle species, represented with four\r\nlegs, wings and a beak,--the fore part resembling an eagle and the\r\nhinder a lion. In addition, some writers describe the tail as a serpent.\r\nThis animal, which was supposed to watch over gold mines and hidden\r\ntreasures, and to be the enemy of the horse, was consecrated to the Sun;\r\nand the ancient painters represented the chariot of the Sun as drawn by\r\ngriffins. According to Spanheim, those of Jupiter and Nemesis were\r\nsimilarly provided. The griffin of Scripture is probably the osprey, and\r\nthe name is now given to a species of vulture. The griffin was said to\r\ninhabit Asiatic Scythia, where gold and precious stones were abundant;\r\nand when strangers approached to gather these the creatures leapt upon\r\nthem and tore them in pieces, thus chastising human avarice and greed.\r\nThe one-eyed Arimaspi waged constant war with them, according to\r\nHerodotus (iii. 16). Sir John de Mandeville, in his _Travels_, described\r\na griffin as eight times larger than a lion.\r\n\r\nThe griffin is frequently seen as a charge in heraldry (see HERALDRY,\r\nfig. 163); and in architectural decoration is usually represented as a\r\nfour-footed beast with wings and the head of a leopard or tiger with\r\nhorns, or with the head and beak of an eagle; in the latter case, but\r\nvery rarely, with two legs. To what extent it owes its origin to Persian\r\nsculpture is not known, the capitals at Persepolis have sometimes\r\nleopard or lion heads with horns, and four-footed beasts with the beaks\r\nof eagles are represented in bas-reliefs. In the temple of Apollo\r\nBranchidae near Miletus in Asia Minor, the winged griffin of the\r\ncapitals has leopards' heads with horns. In the capitals of the\r\nso-called lesser propylaea at Eleusis conventional eagles with two feet\r\nsupport the angles of the abacus. The greater number of those in Rome\r\nhave eagles' beaks, as in the frieze of the temple of Antoninus and\r\nFaustina, and their tails develop into conventional foliage. A similar\r\ndevice was found in the Forum of Trajan. The best decorative employment\r\nof the griffin is found in the vertical supports of tables, of which\r\nthere are two or three examples in Pompeii and others in the Vatican and\r\nthe museums in Rome. In some of these cases the head is that of a lion\r\nat one end of the support and an eagle at the other end, and there is\r\nonly one strongly developed paw; the wings circling round at the top\r\nform conspicuous features on the sides of these supports, the surfaces\r\nbelow being filled with conventional Greek foliage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIFFITH, SIR RICHARD JOHN (1784-1878), Irish geologist, was born in\r\nDublin on the 20th of September 1784. He obtained in 1799 a commission\r\nin the Royal Irish Artillery, but a year later, when the corps was\r\nincorporated with that of England, he retired, and devoted his attention\r\nto civil engineering and mining. He studied chemistry, mineralogy and\r\nmining for two years in London under William Nicholson (editor of the\r\n_Journal of Nat. Phil._), and afterwards examined the mining districts\r\nin various parts of England, Wales and Scotland. While in Cornwall he\r\ndiscovered ores of nickel and cobalt in material that had been rejected\r\nas worthless. He completed his studies under Robert Jameson and others\r\nat Edinburgh, was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in\r\n1807, a member of the newly established Geological Society of London in\r\n1808, and in the same year he returned to Ireland. In 1809 he was\r\nappointed by the commissioners to inquire into the nature and extent of\r\nthe bogs in Ireland, and the means of improving them. In 1812 he was\r\nelected professor of geology and mining engineer to the Royal Dublin\r\nSociety. During subsequent years he made many surveys and issued many\r\nreports on mineral districts in Ireland, and these formed the foundation\r\nof his first geological map of the country (1815). In 1822 Griffith\r\nbecame engineer of public works in Cork, Kerry and Limerick, and was\r\noccupied until 1830 in repairing old roads and in laying out many miles\r\nof new roads. Meanwhile in 1825 he was appointed to carry out the\r\nperambulation or boundary survey of Ireland, the object of which was to\r\nascertain and mark the boundaries of every county, barony, parish and\r\ntownland in preparation for the ordnance survey. This work was finished\r\nin 1844. He was also called upon to assist in preparing a bill for the\r\ngeneral valuation of Ireland; the act was passed in 1826, and he was\r\nappointed commissioner of valuation, in which capacity he continued to\r\nact until 1868. On \"Griffith's valuation\" the various local and public\r\nassessments were made. His extensive investigations furnished him with\r\nample material for improving his geological map, and the second edition\r\nwas published in 1835. A third edition on a larger scale (1 in. to 4 m.)\r\nwas issued under the Board of Ordnance in 1839, and it was further\r\nrevised in 1855. For this great work and his other services to science\r\nhe was awarded the Wollaston medal by the Geological Society in 1854. In\r\n1850 he was made chairman of the Irish Board of Works, and in 1858 he\r\nwas created a baronet. He died in Dublin on the 22nd of September 1878.\r\n\r\n  Among his many geological works the following may be mentioned:\r\n  _Outline of the Geology of Ireland_ (1838); _Notice respecting the\r\n  Fossils of the Mountain Limestone of Ireland, as compared with those\r\n  of Great Britain, and also with the Devonian System_ (1842); _A\r\n  Synopsis of the Characters of the Carboniferous Limestone Fossils of\r\n  Ireland_ (1844) (with F. McCoy); _A Synopsis of the Silurian Fossils\r\n  of Ireland_ (1846) (with F. McCoy). See memoirs in _Quart. Journ.\r\n  Geol. Soc._ xxxv. 39; and _Geol. Mag._, 1878, p. 524, with\r\n  bibliography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRILLE, a French term for an enclosure in either iron or bronze; there\r\nis no equivalent in English, \"grating\" applying more to a horizontal\r\nframe of bars over a sunk area, and \"grate\" to the iron bars of an open\r\nfireplace. The finest examples of the grille are those known as the\r\n_rejas_, which in Spanish churches form the enclosures of the chapels,\r\nsuch as the _reja_ in the Capilla Real at Granada in wrought iron partly\r\ngilt (1522). Similar grilles are employed to protect the ground-floor\r\nwindows of mansions not only in Spain but in Italy and Germany. In\r\nEngland the most beautiful example is that in front of Queen Eleanor's\r\ntomb in Westminster Abbey, in wrought iron. The finest grilles in Italy\r\nare the enclosures of the tombs of the Della Scalas at Verona (end of\r\n13th century), in Germany the grille of the cenotaph of Maximilian at\r\nInnsbruck (early 16th century) and in France those which enclose the\r\nPlace Stanislaus, the Place de la Carriere and the churches of Nancy,\r\nwhich were wrought by Jean Lamour in the middle of the 18th century.\r\nGenerally, however, throughout Germany the wrought iron grilles are fine\r\nexamples of forging, and they are employed for the enclosures of the\r\nnumerous fountains, in the tympana of gateways, and for the protection\r\nof windows. At Danzig in the Marienkirche are some fine examples in\r\nbrass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRILLPARZER, FRANZ (1791-1872), the greatest dramatic poet of Austria,\r\nwas born in Vienna, on the 15th of January 1791. His father, severe,\r\npedantic, a staunch upholder of the liberal traditions of the reign of\r\nJoseph II., was an advocate of some standing; his mother, a nervous,\r\nfinely-strung woman, belonged to the well-known musical family of\r\nSonnleithner. After a desultory education, Grillparzer entered in 1807\r\nthe university of Vienna as a student of jurisprudence; but two years\r\nlater his father died, leaving the family in straitened circumstances,\r\nand Franz, the eldest son, was obliged to turn to private tutoring. In\r\n1813 he received an appointment in the court library, but as this was\r\nunpaid, he accepted after some months a clerkship that offered more\r\nsolid prospects, in the Lower Austrian revenue administration. Through\r\nthe influence of Graf Stadion, the minister of finance, he was in 1818\r\nappointed poet to the Hofburgtheater, and promoted to the _Hofkammer_\r\n(exchequer); in 1832 he became director of the archives of that\r\ndepartment, and in 1856 retired from the civil service with the title of\r\n_Hofrat_. Grillparzer had little capacity for an official career and\r\nregarded his office merely as a means of independence.\r\n\r\nIn 1817 the first representation of his tragedy _Die Ahnfrau_ made him\r\nfamous, but before this he had written a long tragedy in iambics,\r\n_Bianca von Castilien_ (1807-1809), which was obviously modelled on\r\nSchiller's _Don Carlos_; and even more promising were the dramatic\r\nfragments _Spartacus_ and _Alfred der Grosse_ (1809). _Die Ahnfrau_ is a\r\ngruesome \"fate-tragedy\" in the trochaic measure of the Spanish drama,\r\nalready made popular by Adolf Mullner in his _Schuld_; but Grillparzer's\r\nwork is a play of real poetic beauties, and reveals an instinct for\r\ndramatic as opposed to merely theatrical effect, which distinguishes it\r\nfrom other \"fate-dramas\" of the day. Unfortunately its success led to\r\nthe poet's being classed for the best part of his life with playwrights\r\nlike Mullner and Houwald. _Die Ahnfrau_ was followed by _Sappho_ (1818),\r\na drama of a very different type; in the classic spirit of Goethe's\r\n_Tasso_, Grillparzer unrolled the tragedy of poetic genius, the\r\nrenunciation of earthly happiness imposed upon the poet by his higher\r\nmission. In 1821 appeared _Das goldene Vliess_, a trilogy which had been\r\ninterrupted in 1819 by the death of the poet's mother--in a fit of\r\ndepression she had taken her own life--and a subsequent visit to Italy.\r\nOpening with a powerful dramatic prelude in one act, _Der Gastfreund_,\r\nGrillparzer depicts in _Die Argonauten_ Jason's adventures in his quest\r\nfor the Fleece; while _Medea_, a tragedy of noble classic proportions,\r\ncontains the culminating events of the story which had been so often\r\ndramatized before. The theme is similar to that of _Sappho_, but the\r\nscale on which it is represented is larger; it is again the tragedy of\r\nthe heart's desire, the conflict of the simple happy life with that\r\nsinister power--be it genius, or ambition--which upsets the equilibrium\r\nof life. The end is bitter disillusionment, the only consolation\r\nrenunciation. Medea, her revenge stilled, her children dead, bears the\r\nfatal Fleece back to Delphi, while Jason is left to realize the\r\nnothingness of human striving and earthly happiness.\r\n\r\nFor his historical tragedy _Konig Ottokars Gluck und Ende_ (1823, but\r\nowing to difficulties with the censor, not performed until 1825),\r\nGrillparzer chose one of the most picturesque events in Austrian\r\ndomestic history, the conflict of Ottokar of Bohemia with Rudolph von\r\nHabsburg. With an almost modern realism he reproduced the motley world\r\nof the old chronicler, at the same time not losing sight of the needs of\r\nthe theatre; the fall of Ottokar is but another text from which the poet\r\npreached the futility of endeavour and the vanity of worldly greatness.\r\nA second historical tragedy, _Ein treuer Diener seines Herrn_ (1826,\r\nperformed 1828), attempts to embody a more heroic gospel; but the\r\nsubject--the superhuman self-effacement of Bankbanus before Duke Otto of\r\nMeran--proved too uncompromising an illustration of Kant's categorical\r\nimperative of duty to be palatable in the theatre. With these historical\r\ntragedies began the darkest ten years in the poet's life. They brought\r\nhim into conflict with the Austrian censor--a conflict which grated on\r\nGrillparzer's sensitive soul, and was aggravated by his own position as\r\na servant of the state; in 1826 he paid a visit to Goethe in Weimar, and\r\nwas able to compare the enlightened conditions which prevailed in the\r\nlittle Saxon duchy with the intellectual thraldom of Vienna. To these\r\ntroubles were added more serious personal worries. In the winter of\r\n1820-1821 he had met for the first time Katharina Frohlich (1801-1879),\r\nand the acquaintance rapidly ripened into love on both sides; but\r\nwhether owing to a presentiment of mutual incompatibility, or merely\r\nowing to Grillparzer's conviction that life had no happiness in store\r\nfor him, he shrank from marriage. Whatever the cause may have been, the\r\npoet was plunged into an abyss of misery and despair to which his diary\r\nbears heart-rending witness; his sufferings found poetic expression in\r\nthe fine cycle of poems bearing the significant title _Tristia ex Ponto_\r\n(1835).\r\n\r\nYet to these years we owe the completion of two of Grillparzer's\r\ngreatest dramas, _Des Meeres und der Liebe Wellen_ (1831) and _Der\r\nTraum, ein Leben_ (1834). In the former tragedy, a dramatization of the\r\nstory of Hero and Leander, he returned to the Hellenic world of\r\n_Sappho_, and produced what is perhaps the finest of all German\r\nlove-tragedies. His mastery of dramatic technique is here combined with\r\na ripeness of poetic expression and with an insight into motive which\r\nsuggests the modern psychological drama of Hebbel and Ibsen; the old\r\nGreek love-story of Musaeus is, moreover, endowed with something of that\r\nineffable poetic grace which the poet had borrowed from the great\r\nSpanish poets, Lope de Vega and Calderon. _Der Traum, ein Leben_,\r\nGrillparzer's technical masterpiece, is in form perhaps even more\r\nSpanish; it is also more of what Goethe called a \"confession.\" The\r\naspirations of Rustan, an ambitious young peasant, are shadowed forth in\r\nthe hero's dream, which takes up nearly three acts of the play;\r\nultimately Rustan awakens from his nightmare to realize the truth of\r\nGrillparzer's own pessimistic doctrine that all earthly ambitions and\r\naspirations are vanity; the only true happiness is contentment with\r\none's lot, \"des Innern stiller Frieden und die schuldbefreite Brust.\"\r\n_Der Traum, ein Leben_ was the first of Grillparzer's dramas which did\r\nnot end tragically, and in 1838 he produced his only comedy, _Weh' dem,\r\nder lugt_. But _Weh' dem, der lugt_, in spite of its humour of\r\nsituation, its sparkling dialogue and the originality of its\r\nidea--namely, that the hero gains his end by invariably telling the\r\ntruth, where his enemies as invariably expect him to be lying--was too\r\nstrange to meet with approval in its day. Its failure was a blow to the\r\npoet, who turned his back for ever on the German theatre. In 1836\r\nGrillparzer paid a visit to Paris and London, in 1843 to Athens and\r\nConstantinople. Then came the Revolution which struck off the\r\nintellectual fetters under which Grillparzer and his contemporaries had\r\ngroaned in Austria, but the liberation came too late for him. Honours\r\nwere heaped upon him; he was made a member of the Academy of Sciences;\r\nHeinrich Laube, as director of the Burgtheater, reinstated his plays on\r\nthe repertory; he was in 1861 elected to the Austrian _Herrenhaus_; his\r\neightieth birthday was a national festival, and when he died in Vienna,\r\non the 21st of January 1872, the mourning of the Austrian people was\r\nuniversal. With the exception of a beautiful fragment, _Esther_ (1861),\r\nGrillparzer published no more dramatic poetry after the fiasco of _Weh'\r\ndem, der lugt_, but at his death three completed tragedies were found\r\namong his papers. Of these, _Die Judin von Toledo_, an admirable\r\nadaptation from the Spanish, has won a permanent place in the German\r\nclassical repertory; _Ein Bruderzwist im Hause Habsburg_ is a powerful\r\nhistorical tragedy and _Libussa_ is perhaps the ripest, as it is\r\ncertainly the deepest, of all Grillparzer's dramas; the latter two plays\r\nprove how much was lost by the poet's divorce from the theatre.\r\n\r\nAlthough Grillparzer was essentially a dramatist, his lyric poetry is in\r\nthe intensity of its personal note hardly inferior to Lenau's; and the\r\nbitterness of his later years found vent in biting and stinging epigrams\r\nthat spared few of his greater contemporaries. As a prose writer, he has\r\nleft one powerful short story, _Der arme Spielmann_ (1848), and a volume\r\nof critical studies on the Spanish drama, which shows how completely he\r\nhad succeeded in identifying himself with the Spanish point of view.\r\n\r\nGrillparzer's brooding, unbalanced temperament, his lack of will-power,\r\nhis pessimistic renunciation and the bitterness which his self-imposed\r\nmartyrdom produced in him, made him peculiarly adapted to express the\r\nmood of Austria in the epoch of intellectual thraldom that lay between\r\nthe Napoleonic wars and the Revolution of 1848; his poetry reflects\r\nexactly the spirit of his people under the Metternich regime, and there\r\nis a deep truth behind the description of _Der Traum, ein Leben_ as the\r\nAustrian _Faust_. His fame was in accordance with the general tenor of\r\nhis life; even in Austria a true understanding for his genius was late\r\nin coming, and not until the centenary of 1891 did the German-speaking\r\nworld realize that it possessed in him a dramatic poet of the first\r\nrank; in other words, that Grillparzer was no mere \"Epigone\" of the\r\nclassic period, but a poet who, by a rare assimilation of the strength\r\nof the Greeks, the imaginative depth of German classicism and the\r\ndelicacy and grace of the Spaniards, had opened up new paths for the\r\nhigher dramatic poetry of Europe.\r\n\r\n  Grillparzer's _Samtliche Werke_ are edited by A. Sauer, in 20 vols.,\r\n  5th edition (Stuttgart, 1892-1894); also, since the expiry of the\r\n  copyright in 1901, innumerable cheap reprints. _Briefe und\r\n  Tagebucher_, edited by C. Glossy and A.

Of\r\n  Grillparzer's works, translations have appeared in English of _Sappho_\r\n  (1820, by J. Bramsen; 1846, by E. B. Lee; 1855, by L. C. Cumming;\r\n  1876, by E. Frothingham); and of _Medea_ (1879, by F. W. Thurstan and\r\n  J. A. Wittmann). Byron's warm admiration of _Sappho_ (_Letters and\r\n  Journals_, v. 171) is well known, while Carlyle's criticism, in his\r\n  essay on _German Playwrights_ (1829), is interesting as expressing the\r\n  generally accepted estimate of Grillparzer in the first half of the\r\n  19th century. See the bibliography in K. Goedeke's _Grundriss zur\r\n  Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung_, 2nd ed., vol. viii. (1905).\r\n       (J. G. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIMALD (or GRIMOALD), NICHOLAS (1519-1562), English poet, was born in\r\nHuntingdonshire, the son probably of Giovanni Baptista Grimaldi, who had\r\nbeen a clerk in the service of Empson and Dudley in the reign of Henry\r\nVII. He was educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he took his\r\nB.A. degree in 1540. He then removed to Oxford, becoming a\r\nprobationer-fellow of Merton College in 1541. In 1547 he was lecturing\r\non rhetoric at Christ Church, and shortly afterwards became chaplain to\r\nBishop Ridley, who, when he was in prison, desired Grimald to translate\r\nLaurentius Valla's book against the alleged _Donation of Constantine_,\r\nand the _De gestis Basiliensis Concilii_ of Aeneas Sylvius (Pius II.).\r\nHis connexion with Ridley brought him under suspicion, and he was\r\nimprisoned in the Marshalsea. It is said that he escaped the penalties\r\nof heresy by recanting his errors, and was despised accordingly by his\r\nProtestant contemporaries. Grimald contributed to the original edition\r\n(June 1557) of _Songes and Sonettes_ (commonly known as _Tottel's\r\nMiscellany_), forty poems, only ten of which are retained in the second\r\nedition published in the next month. He translated (1553) Cicero's _De\r\nofficiis as Marcus Tullius Ciceroes thre bokes of duties_ (2nd ed.,\r\n1556); a Latin paraphrase of Virgil's _Georgics_ (printed 1591) is\r\nattributed to him, but most of the works assigned to him by Bale are\r\nlost. Two Latin tragedies are extant; _Archipropheta sive Johannes\r\nBaptista_, printed at Cologne in 1548, probably performed at Oxford the\r\nyear before, and _Christus redivivus_ (Cologne, 1543), edited by Prof.\r\nJ. M. Hart (for the Modern Language Association of America, 1886,\r\nseparately issued 1899). It cannot be determined whether Grimald was\r\nfamiliar with Buchanan's _Baptistes_ (1543), or with J. Schoeppe's\r\n_Johannes decollatus vel Ectrachelistes_ (1546). Grimald provides a\r\npurely romantic motive for the catastrophe in the passionate attachment\r\nof Herodias to Herod, and constantly resorts to lyrical methods. As a\r\npoet Grimald is memorable as the earliest follower of Surrey in the\r\nproduction of blank verse. He writes sometimes simply enough, as in the\r\nlines on his own childhood addressed to his mother, but in general his\r\nstyle is more artificial, and his metaphors more studied than is the\r\ncase with the other contributors to the _Miscellany_. His classical\r\nreading shows itself in the comparative terseness and smartness of his\r\nverses. His epitaph was written by Barnabe Googe in May 1562.\r\n\r\n  See C. H. Herford, _Studies in the Literary Relations of England and\r\n  Germany_ (pp. 113-119, 1886). _A Catalogue of printed books ... by\r\n  writers bearing the name of Grimaldi_ (ed. A. B. Grimaldi), printed\r\n  1883; and Arber's reprint oi _Tottel's Miscellany_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIMALDI, GIOVANNI FRANCESCO (1606-1680), Italian architect and painter,\r\nnamed Il Bolognese from the place of his birth, was a relative of the\r\nCaracci family, under whom it is presumed he studied first. He was\r\nafterwards a pupil of Albani. He went to Rome, and was appointed\r\narchitect to Pope Paul V., and was also patronized by succeeding popes.\r\nTowards 1648 he was invited to France by Cardinal Mazarin, and for about\r\ntwo years was employed in buildings for that minister and for Louis\r\nXIV., and in fresco-painting in the Louvre. His colour was strong,\r\nsomewhat excessive in the use of green; his touch light. He painted\r\nhistory, portraits and landscapes--the last with predilection,\r\nespecially in his advanced years--and executed engravings and etchings\r\nfrom his own landscapes and from those of Titian and the Caracci.\r\nReturning to Rome, he was made president of the Academy of St Luke; and\r\nin that city he died on the 28th of November 1680, in high repute not\r\nonly for his artistic skill but for his upright and charitable deeds.\r\nHis son Alessandro assisted him both in painting and in engraving.\r\nPaintings by Grimaldi are preserved in the Quirinal and Vatican palaces,\r\nand in the church of S. Martino a'Monti; there is also a series of his\r\nlandscapes in the Colonna Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIMALDI, JOSEPH (1779-1837), the most celebrated of English clowns, was\r\nborn in London on the 18th of December 1779, the son of an Italian\r\nactor. When less than two years old he was brought upon the stage at\r\nDrury Lane; at the age of three he began to appear at Sadler's Wells;\r\nand he did not finally retire until 1828. As the clown of pantomime he\r\nwas considered without an equal, his greatest success being in _Mother\r\nGoose_, at Covent Garden (1806 and often revived). Grimaldi died on the\r\n31st of May 1837.\r\n\r\n  His _Memoirs_ in two volumes (1838) were edited by Charles Dickens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIMKE, SARAH MOORE (1792-1873) and ANGELINA EMILY (1805-1879), American\r\nreformers, born in Charleston, South Carolina--Sarah on the 6th of\r\nNovember 1792, and Angelina on the 20th of February 1805--were daughters\r\nof John Fachereau Grimke (1752-1819), an artillery officer in the\r\nContinental army, a jurist of some distinction, a man of wealth and\r\nculture and a slave-holder.\r\n\r\nTheir older brother, THOMAS SMITH GRIMKE (1786-1834), was born in\r\nCharleston; graduated at Yale in 1807; was a successful lawyer, and in\r\n1826-1830 was a member of the state Senate, in which he, almost alone of\r\nthe prominent lawyers of the state, opposed nullification; he strongly\r\nadvocated spelling-reform, temperance and absolute non-resistance, and\r\npublished _Addresses on Science, Education and Literature_ (1831). His\r\nearly intellectual influence on Sarah was strong.\r\n\r\nIn her thirteenth year Sarah was godmother to her sister Angelina. Sarah\r\nin 1821 revisited Philadelphia, whither she had accompanied her father\r\non his last illness, and there, having been already dissatisfied with\r\nthe Episcopal Church and with the Presbyterian, she became a Quaker; so,\r\ntoo, did Angelina, who joined her in 1829. Both sisters (Angelina first)\r\nsoon grew into a belief in immediate abolition, strongly censured by\r\nmany Quakers, who were even more shocked by a sympathetic letter dated\r\n\"8th Month, 30th, 1835\" written by Angelina to W. L. Garrison, followed\r\nin 1836 by her _Appeal to the Christian Women of the South_, and at the\r\nend of that year, by an _Epistle to the Clergy of the Southern States_,\r\nwritten by Sarah, who now thoroughly agreed with her younger sister. In\r\nthe same year, at the invitation of Elizur Wright (1804-1885),\r\ncorresponding secretary of the American Anti-Slavery Society, Angelina,\r\naccompanied by Sarah, began giving talks on slavery, first in private\r\nand then in public, so that in 1837, when they set to work in\r\nMassachusetts, they had to secure the use of large halls. Their speaking\r\nfrom public platforms resulted in a letter issued by some members of the\r\nGeneral Association of Congregational Ministers of Massachusetts,\r\ncalling on the clergy to close their churches to women exhorters;\r\nGarrison denounced the attack on the Grimke sisters and Whittier\r\nridiculed it in his poem \"The Pastoral Letter.\" Angelina pointedly\r\nanswered _Miss Beecher on the Slave Question_ (1837) in letters in the\r\n_Liberator_. Sarah, who had never forgotten that her studies had been\r\ncurtailed because she was a girl, contributed to the Boston _Spectator_\r\npapers on \"The Province of Woman\" and published _Letters on the\r\nCondition of Women and the Equality of the Sexes_ (1838)--the real\r\nbeginning of the \"woman's rights\" movement in America, and at the time a\r\ncause of anxiety to Whittier and others, who urged upon the sisters the\r\nprior importance of the anti-slavery cause. In 1838 Angelina married\r\nTheodore Dwight Weld (1803-1895), a reformer and abolition orator and\r\npamphleteer, who had taken part in the famous Lane Seminary debates in\r\n1834, had left the Seminary for the lecture platform when the\r\nanti-slavery society was broken up by the Lane trustees, but had lost\r\nhis voice in 1836 and had become editor of the publications of the\r\nAmerican Anti-Slavery Society.[1] They lived, with Sarah, at Fort Lee,\r\nNew Jersey, in 1838-1840, then on a farm at Belleville, New Jersey, and\r\nthen conducted a school for black and white alike at Eagleswood, near\r\nPerth Amboy, New Jersey, from 1854 to 1864. Removing to Hyde Park,\r\nMassachusetts, the three were employed in Dr Lewis's school. There Sarah\r\ndied on the 23rd of December 1873, and Angelina on the 26th of October\r\n1879. Both sisters indulged in various \"fads\"--Graham's diet,\r\nbloomer-wearing, absolute non-resistance. Angelina did no public\r\nspeaking after her marriage, save at Pennsylvania Hall (Philadelphia),\r\ndestroyed by a mob immediately after her address there; but besides her\r\ndomestic and school duties she was full of tender charity. Sarah at the\r\nage of 62 was still eager to study law or medicine, or to do something\r\nto aid her sex; at 75 she translated and abridged Lamartine's life of\r\nJoan of Arc.\r\n\r\n  See Catherine H. Birney, _The Grimke Sisters_ (Boston, 1885).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Weld was the author of several anti-slavery books which had\r\n    considerable influence at the time. Among them are _The Bible against\r\n    Slavery_ (1837), _American Slavery as It Is_ (1839), a collection of\r\n    extracts from Southern papers, and _Slavery and the Internal Slave\r\n    Trade in the U.S._ (1841).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIMM, FRIEDRICH MELCHIOR, BARON VON (1723-1807), French author, the son\r\nof a German pastor, was born at Ratisbon on the 26th of December 1723.\r\nHe studied at the University of Leipzig, where he came under the\r\ninfluence of Gottsched and of J. A. Ernesti, to whom he was largely\r\nindebted for his critical appreciation of classical literature. When\r\nnineteen he produced a tragedy, _Banise_, which met with some success.\r\nAfter two years of study he returned to Ratisbon, where he was attached\r\nto the household of Count Schonberg. In 1748 he accompanied August\r\nHeinrich, Count Friesen, to Paris as secretary, and he is said by\r\nRousseau to have acted for some time as reader to Frederick, the young\r\nhereditary prince of Saxe-Gotha. His acquaintance with Rousseau, through\r\na mutual sympathy in regard to musical matters, soon ripened into\r\nintimate friendship, and led to a close association with the\r\nencyclopaedists. He rapidly obtained a thorough knowledge of the French\r\nlanguage, and acquired so perfectly the tone and sentiments of the\r\nsociety in which he moved that all marks of his foreign origin and\r\ntraining seemed effaced. A witty pamphlet entitled _Le Petit Prophete de\r\nBoehmischbroda_ (1753), written by him in defence of Italian as against\r\nFrench opera, established his literary reputation. It is possible that\r\nthe origin of the pamphlet is partly to be accounted for by his vehement\r\npassion[1] for Mlle Fel, the _prima donna_ of the Italian company. In\r\n1753 Grimm, following the example of the abbe Raynal, began a literary\r\ncorrespondence with various German sovereigns. Raynal's letters,\r\n_Nouvelles litteraires_, ceased early in 1755. With the aid of friends,\r\nespecially of Diderot and Mme d'Epinay, during his temporary absences\r\nfrom France, Grimm himself carried on the correspondence, which\r\nconsisted of two letters a month, until 1773, and eventually counted\r\namong his subscribers Catherine II. of Russia, Stanislas Poniatowski,\r\nking of Poland, and many princes of the smaller German States. It was\r\nprobably in 1754 that Grimm was introduced by Rousseau to Madame\r\nd'Epinay, with whom he soon formed a _liaison_ which led to an\r\nirreconcilable rupture between him and Rousseau. Rousseau was induced by\r\nhis resentment to give in his _Confessions_ a wholly mendacious portrait\r\nof Grimm's character. In 1755, after the death of Count Friesen, who was\r\na nephew of Marshal Saxe and an officer in the French army, Grimm became\r\n_secretaire des commandements_ to the duke of Orleans, and in this\r\ncapacity he accompanied Marshal d'Estrees on the campaign of Westphalia\r\nin 1756-57. He was named envoy of the town of Frankfort at the court of\r\nFrance in 1759, but was deprived of his office for criticizing the comte\r\nde Broglie in a despatch intercepted by Louis XV. He was made a baron of\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire in 1775. His introduction to Catherine II. of\r\nRussia took place at St Petersburg in 1773, when he was in the suite of\r\nWilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt on the occasion of her marriage to the\r\nczarevitch Paul. He became minister of Saxe-Gotha at the court of France\r\nin 1776, but in 1777 he again left Paris on a visit to St Petersburg,\r\nwhere he remained for nearly a year in daily intercourse with Catherine.\r\nHe acted as Paris agent for the empress in the purchase of works of art,\r\nand executed many confidential commissions for her. In 1783 and the\r\nfollowing years he lost his two most intimate friends, Mme d'Epinay and\r\nDiderot. In 1792 he emigrated, and in the next year settled in Gotha,\r\nwhere his poverty was relieved by Catherine, who in 1796 appointed him\r\nminister of Russia at Hamburg. On the death of the empress Catherine he\r\ntook refuge with Mme d'Epinay's granddaughter, Emilie de Belsunce,\r\ncomtesse de Bueil. Grimm had always interested himself in her, and had\r\nprocured her dowry from the empress Catherine. She now received him with\r\nthe utmost kindness. He died at Gotha on the 19th of December 1807.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of Grimm was strictly confidential, and was not\r\ndivulged during his lifetime. It embraces nearly the whole period from\r\n1750 to 1790, but the later volumes, 1773 to 1790, were chiefly the work\r\nof his secretary, Jakob Heinrich Meister. At first he contented himself\r\nwith enumerating the chief current views in literature and art and\r\nindicating very slightly the contents of the principal new books, but\r\ngradually his criticisms became more extended and trenchant, and he\r\ntouched on nearly every subject--political, literary, artistic, social\r\nand religious--which interested the Parisian society of the time. His\r\nnotices of contemporaries are somewhat severe, and he exhibits the\r\nfoibles and selfishness of the society in which he moved; but he was\r\nunbiassed in his literary judgments, and time has only served to confirm\r\nhis criticisms. In style and manner of expression he is thoroughly\r\nFrench. He is generally somewhat cold in his appreciation, but his\r\nliterary taste is delicate and subtle; and it was the opinion of\r\nSainte-Beuve that the quality of his thought in his best moments will\r\ncompare not unfavourably even with that of Voltaire. His religious and\r\nphilosophical opinions were entirely negative.\r\n\r\n  Grimm's _Correspondance litteraire, philosophique et critique ...,\r\n  depuis 1753 jusqu'en 1769_, was edited, with many excisions, by J. B.\r\n  A. Suard and published at Paris in 1812, in 6 vols. 8vo; _deuxieme\r\n  partie, de 1771 a 1782_, in 1812 in 5 vols. 8vo; and _troisieme\r\n  partie, pendant une partie des annees 1775 et 1776, et pendant les\r\n  annees 1782 a 1790 inclusivement_, in 1813 in 5 vols. 8vo. A\r\n  supplementary volume appeared in 1814; the whole correspondence was\r\n  collected and published by M. Jules Taschereau, with the assistance of\r\n  A. Chaude, in a _Nouvelle Edition, revue et mise dans un meilleur\r\n  ordre, avec des notes et des eclaircissements, et ou se trouvent\r\n  retablies pour la premiere fois les phrases supprimees par la censure\r\n  imperiale_ (Paris, 1829, 15 vols. 8vo); and the _Correspondance\r\n  inedite, et recueil de lettres, poesies, morceaux, et fragments\r\n  retranches par la censure imperiale en 1812 et 1813_ was published in\r\n  1829. The standard edition is that of M. Tourneux (16 vols.,\r\n  1877-1882). Grimm's _Memoire historique sur l'origine et les suites de\r\n  mon attachement pour l'imperatrice Catherine II jusqu'au deces de sa\r\n  majeste imperiale_, and Catherine's correspondence with Grimm\r\n  (1774-1796) were published by J. Grot in 1880, in the _Collection_ of\r\n  the Russian Imperial Historical Society. She treats him very\r\n  familiarly, and calls him Heraclite, Georges Dandin, &c. At the time\r\n  of the Revolution she begged him to destroy her letters, but he\r\n  refused, and after his death they were returned to St Petersburg.\r\n  Grimm's side of the correspondence, however, is only partially\r\n  preserved. He signs himself \"Pleureur.\" Some of Grimm's letters,\r\n  besides the official correspondence, are included in the edition of M.\r\n  Tourneux; others are contained in the _Erinnerungen einer\r\n  Urgrossmutter_ of K. von Bechtolsheim, edited (Berlin, 1902) by Count\r\n  C. Oberndorff.

Georges,\r\n  _Friedrich Melchior Grimm_ (Hanover and Leipzig, 1904).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Rousseau's account of this affair (_Confessions_, 2nd part, 8th\r\n    book) must be received with caution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIMM, JACOB LUDWIG CARL (1785-1863), German philologist and\r\nmythologist, was born on the 4th of January 1785 at Hanau, in\r\nHesse-Cassel. His father, who was a lawyer, died while he was a child,\r\nand the mother was left with very small means; but her sister, who was\r\nlady of the chamber to the landgravine of Hesse, helped to support and\r\neducate her numerous family. Jacob, with his younger brother Wilhelm\r\n(born on the 24th of February 1786), was sent in 1798 to the public\r\nschool at Cassel. In 1802 he proceeded to the university of Marburg,\r\nwhere he studied law, a profession for which he had been destined by his\r\nfather. His brother joined him at Marburg a year later, having just\r\nrecovered from a long and severe illness, and likewise began the study\r\nof law. Up to this time Jacob Grimm had been actuated only by a general\r\nthirst for knowledge and his energies had not found any aim beyond the\r\npractical one of making himself a position in life. The first definite\r\nimpulse came from the lectures of Savigny, the celebrated investigator\r\nof Roman law, who, as Grimm himself says (in the preface to the\r\n_Deutsche Grammatik_), first taught him to realize what it meant to\r\nstudy any science. Savigny's lectures also awakened in him that love for\r\nhistorical and antiquarian investigation which forms the basis of all\r\nhis work. Then followed personal acquaintance, and it was in Savigny's\r\nwell-provided library that Grimm first turned over the leaves of\r\nBodmer's edition of the Old German minnesingers and other early texts,\r\nand felt an eager desire to penetrate further into the obscurities and\r\nhalf-revealed mysteries of their language. In the beginning of 1805 he\r\nreceived an invitation from Savigny, who had removed to Paris, to help\r\nhim in his literary work. Grimm passed a very happy time in Paris,\r\nstrengthening his taste for the literatures of the middle ages by his\r\nstudies in the Paris libraries. Towards the close of the year he\r\nreturned to Cassel, where his mother and Wilhelm had settled, the latter\r\nhaving finished his studies. The next year he obtained a situation in\r\nthe war office with the very small salary of 100 thalers. One of his\r\ngrievances was that he had to exchange his stylish Paris suit for a\r\nstiff uniform and pigtail. But he had full leisure for the prosecution\r\nof his studies. In 1808, soon after the death of his mother, he was\r\nappointed superintendent of the private library of Jerome Buonaparte,\r\nking of Westphalia, into which Hesse-Cassel had been incorporated by\r\nNapoleon. Jerome appointed him an auditor to the state council, while he\r\nretained his other post. His salary was increased in a short interval\r\nfrom 2000 to 4000 francs, and his official duties were hardly more than\r\nnominal. After the expulsion of Jerome and the reinstalment of an\r\nelector, Grimm was appointed in 1813 secretary of legation, to accompany\r\nthe Hessian minister to the headquarters of the allied army. In 1814 he\r\nwas sent to Paris to demand restitution of the books carried off by the\r\nFrench, and in 1814-1815 he attended the congress of Vienna as secretary\r\nof legation. On his return he was again sent to Paris on the same errand\r\nas before. Meanwhile Wilhelm had received an appointment in the Cassel\r\nlibrary, and in 1816 Jacob was made second librarian under Volkel. On\r\nthe death of Volkel in 1828 the brothers expected to be advanced to the\r\nfirst and second librarianships respectively, and were much dissatisfied\r\nwhen the first place was given to Rommel, keeper of the archives. So\r\nthey removed next year to Gottingen, where Jacob received the\r\nappointment of professor and librarian, Wilhelm that of under-librarian.\r\nJacob Grimm lectured on legal antiquities, historical grammar, literary\r\nhistory, and diplomatics, explained Old German poems, and commented on\r\nthe _Germania_ of Tacitus. At this period he is described as small and\r\nlively in figure, with a harsh voice, speaking a broad Hessian dialect.\r\nHis powerful memory enabled him to dispense with the manuscript which\r\nmost German professors rely on, and he spoke extempore, referring only\r\noccasionally to a few names and dates written on a slip of paper. He\r\nhimself regretted that he had begun the work of teaching so late in\r\nlife; and as a lecturer he was not successful: he had no idea of\r\ndigesting his facts and suiting them to the comprehension of his\r\nhearers; and even the brilliant, terse and eloquent passages which\r\nabound in his writings lost much of their effect when jerked out in the\r\nmidst of a long array of dry facts. In 1837, being one of the seven\r\nprofessors who signed a protest against the king of Hanover's abrogation\r\nof the constitution established some years before, he was dismissed from\r\nhis professorship, and banished from the kingdom of Hanover. He returned\r\nto Cassel together with his brother, who had also signed the protest,\r\nand remained there till, in 1840, they accepted an invitation from the\r\nking of Prussia to remove to Berlin, where they both received\r\nprofessorships, and were elected members of the Academy of Sciences. Not\r\nbeing under any obligation to lecture, Jacob seldom did so, but together\r\nwith his brother worked at the great dictionary. During their stay at\r\nCassel Jacob regularly attended the meetings of the academy, where he\r\nread papers on the most varied subjects. The best known of these are\r\nthose on Lachmann, Schiller, and his brother Wilhelm (who died in 1859),\r\non old age, and on the origin of language. He also described his\r\nimpressions of Italian and Scandinavian travel, interspersing his more\r\ngeneral observations with linguistic details, as is the case in all his\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nGrimm died in 1863, working up to the last. He was never ill, and worked\r\non all day, without haste and without pause. He was not at all impatient\r\nof interruption, but seemed rather to be refreshed by it, returning to\r\nhis work without effort. He wrote for the press with great rapidity, and\r\nhardly ever made corrections. He never revised what he had written,\r\nremarking with a certain wonder of his brother, \"Wilhelm reads his\r\nmanuscripts over again before sending them to press!\" His temperament\r\nwas uniformly cheerful, and he was easily amused. Outside his own\r\nspecial work he had a marked taste for botany. The spirit which animated\r\nhis work is best described by himself at the end of his autobiography.\r\n\"Nearly all my labours have been devoted, either directly or indirectly,\r\nto the investigation of our earlier language, poetry and laws. These\r\nstudies may have appeared to many, and may still appear, useless; to me\r\nthey have always seemed a noble and earnest task, definitely and\r\ninseparably connected with our common fatherland, and calculated to\r\nfoster the love of it. My principle has always been in these\r\ninvestigations to under-value nothing, but to utilize the small for the\r\nillustration of the great, the popular tradition for the elucidation of\r\nthe written monuments.\"\r\n\r\nThe purely scientific side of Grimm's character developed slowly. He\r\nseems to have felt the want of definite principles of etymology without\r\nbeing able to discover them, and indeed even in the first edition of his\r\ngrammar (1819) he seems to be often groping in the dark. As early as\r\n1815 we find A. W. Schlegel reviewing the _Altdeutsche Walder_ (a\r\nperiodical published by the two brothers) very severely, condemning the\r\nlawless etymological combinations it contained, and insisting on the\r\nnecessity of strict philological method and a fundamental investigation\r\nof the laws of language, especially in the correspondence of sounds.\r\nThis criticism is said to have had a considerable influence on the\r\ndirection of Grimm's studies.\r\n\r\nThe first work he published, _Uber den altdeutschen Meistergesang_\r\n(1811), was of a purely literary character. Yet even in this essay Grimm\r\nshowed that _Minnesang_ and _Meistersang_ were really one form of\r\npoetry, of which they merely represented different stages of\r\ndevelopment, and also announced his important discovery of the\r\ninvariable division of the _Lied_ into three strophic parts.\r\n\r\nHis text-editions were mostly prepared in common with his brother. In\r\n1812 they published the two ancient fragments of the _Hildebrandslied_\r\nand the _Weissenbrunner Gebet_, Jacob having discovered what till then\r\nhad never been suspected--the alliteration in these poems. However,\r\nJacob had little taste for text-editing, and, as he himself confessed,\r\nthe evolving of a critical text gave him little pleasure. He therefore\r\nleft this department to others, especially Lachmann, who soon turned his\r\nbrilliant critical genius, trained in the severe school of classical\r\nphilology, to Old and Middle High German poetry and metre. Both brothers\r\nwere attracted from the beginning by all national poetry, whether in the\r\nform of epics, ballads or popular tales. They published in 1816-1818 an\r\nanalysis and critical sifting of the oldest epic traditions of the\r\nGermanic races under the title of _Deutsche Sagen_. At the same time\r\nthey collected all the popular tales they could find, partly from the\r\nmouths of the people, partly from manuscripts and books, and published\r\nin 1812-1815 the first edition of those _Kinder- und Hausmarchen_ which\r\nhave carried the name of the brothers Grimm into every household of the\r\ncivilized world, and founded the science of folk-lore. The closely\r\nallied subject of the satirical beast epic of the middle ages also had a\r\ngreat charm for Jacob Grimm, and he published an edition of the\r\n_Reinhart Fuchs_ in 1834. His first contribution to mythology was the\r\nfirst volume of an edition of the Eddaic songs, undertaken conjointly\r\nwith his brother, published in 1815, which, however, was not followed by\r\nany more. The first edition of his _Deutsche Mythologie_ appeared in\r\n1835. This great work covers the whole range of the subject, tracing the\r\nmythology and superstitions of the old Teutons back to the very dawn of\r\ndirect evidence, and following their decay and loss down to the popular\r\ntraditions, tales and expressions in which they still linger.\r\n\r\nAlthough by the introduction of the Code Napoleon into Westphalia\r\nGrimm's legal studies were made practically barren, he never lost his\r\ninterest in the scientific study of law and national institutions, as\r\nthe truest exponents of the life and character of a people. By the\r\npublication (in 1828) of his _Rechtsalterthumer_ he laid the foundations\r\nof that historical study of the old Teutonic laws and constitutions\r\nwhich was continued with brilliant success by Georg L. Maurer and\r\nothers. In this work Grimm showed the importance of a linguistic study\r\nof the old laws, and the light that can be thrown on many a dark passage\r\nin them by a comparison of the corresponding words and expressions in\r\nthe other old cognate dialects. He also knew how--and this is perhaps\r\nthe most original and valuable part of his work--to trace the spirit of\r\nthe laws in countless allusions and sayings which occur in the old poems\r\nand sagas, or even survive in modern colloquialisms.\r\n\r\nOf all his more general works the boldest and most far-reaching is his\r\n_Geschichte der deutschen Sprache_, where at the same time the\r\nlinguistic element is most distinctly brought forward. The subject of\r\nthe work is, indeed, nothing less than the history which lies hidden in\r\nthe words of the German language--the oldest national history of the\r\nTeutonic tribes determined by means of language. For this purpose he\r\nlaboriously collects the scattered words and allusions to be found in\r\nclassical writers, and endeavours to determine the relations in which\r\nthe German language stood to those of the Getae, Thracians, Scythians,\r\nand many other nations whose languages are known only by doubtfully\r\nidentified, often extremely corrupted remains preserved by Greek and\r\nLatin authors. Grimm's results have been greatly modified by the wider\r\nrange of comparison and improved methods of investigation which now\r\ncharacterize linguistic science, and many of the questions raised by him\r\nwill probably for ever remain obscure; but his book will always be one\r\nof the most fruitful and suggestive that have ever been written.\r\n\r\nGrimm's famous _Deutsche Grammatik_ was the outcome of his purely\r\nphilological work. The labours of past generations--from the humanists\r\nonwards--had collected an enormous mass of materials in the shape of\r\ntext-editions, dictionaries and grammars, although most of it was\r\nuncritical and often untrustworthy. Something had even been done in the\r\nway of comparison and the determination of general laws, and the\r\nconception of a comparative Teutonic grammar had been clearly grasped by\r\nthe illustrious Englishman George Hickes, at the beginning of the 18th\r\ncentury, and partly carried out by him in his _Thesaurus_. Ten Kate in\r\nHolland had afterwards made valuable contributions to the history and\r\ncomparison of the Teutonic languages. Even Grimm himself did not at\r\nfirst intend to include all the languages in his grammar; but he soon\r\nfound that Old High German postulated Gothic, that the later stages of\r\nGerman could not be understood without the help of the Low German\r\ndialects, including English, and that the rich literature of Scandinavia\r\ncould as little be ignored. The first edition of the first part of the\r\n_Grammar_, which appeared in 1819, and is now extremely rare, treated of\r\nthe inflections of all these languages, together with a general\r\nintroduction, in which he vindicated the importance of an historical\r\nstudy of the German language against the a priori, quasi-philosophical\r\nmethods then in vogue.\r\n\r\nIn 1822 this volume appeared in a second edition--really a new work,\r\nfor, as Grimm himself says in the preface, it cost him little reflection\r\nto mow down the first crop to the ground. The wide distance between the\r\ntwo stages of Grimm's development in these two editions is significantly\r\nshown by the fact that while the first edition gives only the\r\ninflections, in the second volume phonology takes up no fewer than 600\r\npages, more than half of the whole volume. Grimm had, at last, awakened\r\nto the full conviction that all sound philology must be based on\r\nrigorous adhesion to the laws of sound-change, and he never afterwards\r\nswerved from this principle, which gave to all his investigations, even\r\nin their boldest flights, that iron-bound consistency, and that force of\r\nconviction which distinguish science from dilettanteism; up to Grimm's\r\ntime philology was nothing but a more or less laborious and\r\nconscientious dilettanteism, with occasional flashes of scientific\r\ninspiration; he made it into a science. His advance must be attributed\r\nmainly to the influence of his contemporary R. Rask. Rask was born two\r\nyears later than Grimm, but his remarkable precocity gave him somewhat\r\nthe start. Even in Grimm's first editions his Icelandic paradigms are\r\nbased entirely on Rask's grammar, and in his second edition he relied\r\nalmost entirely on Rask for Old English. His debt to Rask can only be\r\nestimated at its true value by comparing his treatment of Old English in\r\nthe two editions; the difference is very great. Thus in the first\r\nedition he declines _daeg_, _daeges_, plural _daegas_, not having\r\nobserved the law of vowel-change pointed out by Rask. There can be\r\nlittle doubt that the appearance of Rask's Old English grammar was a\r\nmain inducement for him to recast his work from the beginning. To Rask\r\nalso belongs the merit of having first distinctly formulated the laws of\r\nsound-correspondence in the different languages, especially in the\r\nvowels, those more fleeting elements of speech which had hitherto been\r\nignored by etymologists.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a question which has been the subject of much\r\ncontroversy,--Who discovered what is known as _Grimm's law_? This law of\r\nthe correspondence of consonants in the older Indo-germanic, Low and\r\nHigh German languages respectively was first fully stated by Grimm in\r\nthe second edition of the first part of his grammar. The correspondence\r\nof single consonants had been more or less clearly recognized by several\r\nof his predecessors; but the one who came nearest to the discovery of\r\nthe complete law was the Swede J. Ihre, who established a considerable\r\nnumber of \"literarum permutationes,\" such as _b_ for _f_, with the\r\nexamples _baera = ferre_, _befwer = fiber_. Rask, in his essay on the\r\norigin of the Icelandic language, gives the same comparisons, with a few\r\nadditions and corrections, and even the very same examples in most\r\ncases. As Grimm in the preface to his first edition expressly mentions\r\nthis essay of Rask, there is every probability that it gave the first\r\nimpulse to his own investigations. But there is a wide difference\r\nbetween the isolated permutations of his predecessors and the\r\ncomprehensive generalizations under which he himself ranged them. The\r\nextension of the law to High German is also entirely his own. The only\r\nfact that can be adduced in support of the assertion that Grimm wished\r\nto deprive Rask of his claims to priority is that he does not expressly\r\nmention Rask's results in his second edition. But this is part of the\r\nplan of his work, viz. to refrain from all controversy or reference to\r\nthe works of others. In his first edition he expressly calls attention\r\nto Rask's essay, and praises it most ungrudgingly. Rask himself refers\r\nas little to Ihre, merely alluding in a general way to Ihre's\r\npermutations, although his own debt to Ihre is infinitely greater than\r\nthat of Grimm to Rask or any one else. It is true that a certain\r\nbitterness of feeling afterwards sprang up between Grimm and Rask, but\r\nthis was the fault of the latter, who, impatient of contradiction and\r\nirritable in controversy, refused to acknowledge the value of Grimm's\r\nviews when they involved modification of his own. The importance of\r\nGrimm's generalization in the history of philology cannot be\r\noverestimated, and even the mystic completeness and symmetry of its\r\nformulation, although it has proved a hindrance to the correct\r\nexplanation of the causes of the changes, was well calculated to strike\r\nthe popular mind, and give it a vivid idea of the paramount importance\r\nof law, and the necessity of disregarding mere superficial resemblance.\r\nThe most lawless etymologist bows down to the authority of Grimm's law,\r\neven if he honours it almost as much in the breach as in the observance.\r\n\r\nThe grammar was continued in three volumes, treating principally of\r\nderivation, composition and syntax, which last was left unfinished.\r\nGrimm then began a third edition, of which only one part, comprising the\r\nvowels, appeared in 1840, his time being afterwards taken up mainly by\r\nthe dictionary. The grammar stands alone in the annals of science for\r\ncomprehensiveness, method and fullness of detail. Every law, every\r\nletter, every syllable of inflection in the different languages is\r\nillustrated by an almost exhaustive mass of material. It has served as a\r\nmodel for all succeeding investigators. Diez's grammar of the Romance\r\nlanguages is founded entirely on its methods, which have also exerted a\r\nprofound influence on the wider study of the Indo-Germanic languages in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nIn the great German dictionary Grimm undertook a task for which he was\r\nhardly suited. His exclusively historical tendencies made it impossible\r\nfor him to do justice to the individuality of a living language; and the\r\ndisconnected statement of the facts of language in an ordinary\r\nalphabetical dictionary fatally mars its scientific character. It was\r\nalso undertaken on so large a scale as to make it impossible for him and\r\nhis brother to complete it themselves. The dictionary, as far as it was\r\nworked out by Grimm himself, may be described as a collection of\r\ndisconnected antiquarian essays of high value.\r\n\r\nGrimm's scientific character is notable for its combination of breadth\r\nand unity. He was as far removed from the narrowness of the specialist\r\nwho has no ideas, no sympathies beyond some one author, period or corner\r\nof science, as from the shallow dabbler who feverishly attempts to\r\nmaster the details of half-a-dozen discordant pursuits. Even within his\r\nown special studies there is the same wise concentration; no\r\nMezzofanti-like parrot display of useless polyglottism. The very\r\nfoundations of his nature were harmonious; his patriotism and love of\r\nhistorical investigation received their fullest satisfaction in the\r\nstudy of the language, traditions, mythology, laws and literature of his\r\nown countrymen and their nearest kindred. But from this centre his\r\ninvestigations were pursued in every direction as far as his unerring\r\ninstinct of healthy limitation would allow. He was equally fortunate in\r\nthe harmony that subsisted between his intellectual and moral nature. He\r\nmade cheerfully the heavy sacrifices that science demands from its\r\ndisciples, without feeling any of that envy and bitterness which often\r\ntorment weaker natures; and although he lived apart from his fellow men,\r\nhe was full of human sympathies, and no man has ever exercised a\r\nprofounder influence on the destinies of mankind. His was the very ideal\r\nof the noblest type of German character.\r\n\r\n  The following is a complete list of his separately published works,\r\n  those which he published in common with his brother being marked with\r\n  a star. For a list of his essays in periodicals, &c., see vol. v. of\r\n  his _Kleinere Schriften_, from which the present list is taken.

Sw.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIMM, WILHELM CARL (1786-1859). For the chief events in the life of\r\nWilhelm Grimm see article on Jacob Grimm above. As Jacob himself said in\r\nhis celebrated address to the Berlin Academy on the death of his\r\nbrother, the whole of their lives were passed together. In their\r\nschooldays they had one bed and one table in common, as students they\r\nhad two beds and two tables in the same room, and they always lived\r\nunder one roof, and had their books and property in common. Nor did\r\nWilhelm's marriage in any way disturb their harmony. As Cleasby said\r\n(\"Life of Cleasby,\" prefixed to his _Icelandic Dictionary_, p. lxix.),\r\n\"they both live in the same house, and in such harmony and community\r\nthat one might almost imagine the children were common property.\"\r\nWilhelm's character was a complete contrast to that of his brother. As a\r\nboy he was strong and healthy, but as he grew up he was attacked by a\r\nlong and severe illness, which left him weak all his life. His was a\r\nless comprehensive and energetic mind than that of his brother, and he\r\nhad less of the spirit of investigation, preferring to confine himself\r\nto some limited and definitely bounded field of work; he utilized\r\neverything that bore directly on his own studies, and ignored the rest.\r\nThese studies were almost always of a literary nature. It is\r\ncharacteristic of his more aesthetic nature that he took great delight\r\nin music, for which his brother had but a moderate liking, and had a\r\nremarkable gift of story-telling. Cleasby, in the account of his visit\r\nto the brothers, quoted above, tells that \"Wilhelm read a sort of farce\r\nwritten in the Frankfort dialect, depicting the 'malheurs' of a rich\r\nFrankfort tradesman on a holiday jaunt on Sunday. It was very droll, and\r\nhe read it admirably.\" Cleasby describes him as \"an uncommonly animated,\r\njovial fellow.\" He was, accordingly, much sought in society, which he\r\nfrequented much more than his brother.\r\n\r\n  His first work was a spirited translation of the Danish _Kaempeviser,\r\n  Altdanische Heldenlieder_, published in 1811-1813, which made his name\r\n  at first more widely known than that of his brother. The most\r\n  important of his text editions are--_Ruolandslied_ (Gottingen, 1838);\r\n  _Konrad von Wurzburg's Goldene Schmiede_ (Berlin, 1840); _Grave\r\n  Ruodolf_ (Gottingen, 1844, 2nd ed.); _Athis und Prophilias_ (Berlin,\r\n  1846); _Altdeutsche Gesprache_ (Berlin, 1851); _Freidank_ (Gottingen,\r\n  1860, 2nd ed.). Of his other works the most important is _Deutsche\r\n  Heldensage_ (Berlin, 1868, 2nd ed.). His _Deutsche Runen_ (Gottingen,\r\n  1821) has now only an historical interest.     (H. Sw.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIMMA, a town in the kingdom of Saxony, on the left bank of the Mulde,\r\n19 m. S.E. of Leipzig on the railway Dobeln-Dresden. Pop. (1905) 11,182.\r\nIt has a Roman Catholic and three Evangelical churches, and among other\r\nprincipal buildings are the Schloss built in the 12th century, and long\r\na residence of the margraves of Meissen and the electors of Saxony; the\r\ntown-hall, dating from 1442, and the famous school Furstenschule\r\n(_Illustre Moldanum_), erected by the elector Maurice on the site of the\r\nformer Augustinian monastery in 1550, having provision for 104 free\r\nscholars and a library numbering 10,000 volumes. There are also a modern\r\nschool, a teachers' seminary, a commercial school and a school of\r\nbrewing. Among the industries of the town are ironfounding, machine\r\nbuilding and dyeworks, while paper and gloves are manufactured there.\r\nGardening and agriculture generally are also important branches of\r\nindustry. In the immediate neighbourhood are the ruins of the Cistercian\r\nnunnery from which Catherine von Bora fled in 1523, and the village of\r\nDoben, with an old castle. Grimma is of Sorbian origin, and is first\r\nmentioned in 1203. It passed then into possession of Saxony and has\r\nremained since part of that country.\r\n\r\n  See Lorenz, _Die Stadt Grimma, historisch beschrieben_ (Leipzig,\r\n  1871); Rossler, _Geschichte der koniglich sachsischen Fursten- und\r\n  Landesschule Grimma_ (Leipzig, 1891); L. Schmidt, _Urkundenbuch der\r\n  Stadt Grimma_ (Leipzig, 1895); and Fraustadt, _Grimmenser Stammbuch_\r\n  (Grimma, 1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIMMELSHAUSEN, HANS JAKOB CHRISTOFFEL VON (c. 1625-1676), German\r\nauthor, was born at Gelnhausen in or about 1625. At the age of ten he\r\nwas kidnapped by Hessian soldiery, and in their midst tasted the\r\nadventures of military life in the Thirty Years' War. At its close,\r\nGrimmelshausen entered the service of Franz Egon von Furstenberg, bishop\r\nof Strassburg and in 1665 was made _Schultheiss_ (magistrate) at Renchen\r\nin Baden. On obtaining this appointment, he devoted himself to literary\r\npursuits, and in 1669 published _Der abenteuerliche Simplicissimus,\r\nTeutsch, d.h. die Beschreibung des Lebens eines seltsamen Vaganten,\r\ngenannt Melchior Sternfels von Fuchsheim_, the greatest German novel of\r\nthe 17th century. For this work he took as his model the picaresque\r\nromances of Spain, already to some extent known in Germany.\r\n_Simplicissimus_ is in great measure its author's autobiography; he\r\nbegins with the childhood of his hero, and describes the latter's\r\nadventures amid the stirring scenes of the Thirty Years' War. The\r\nrealistic detail with which these pictures are presented makes the book\r\none of the most valuable documents of its time. In the later parts\r\nGrimmelshausen, however, over-indulges in allegory, and finally loses\r\nhimself in a Robinson Crusoe story. Among his other works the most\r\nimportant are the so-called _Simplicianische Schriften: Die\r\nErzbetrugerin und Landstortzerin Courasche_ (c. 1669); _Der seltsame\r\nSpringinsfeld_ (1670) and _Das wunderbarliche Vogelnest_ (1672). His\r\nsatires, such as _Der teutsche Michel_ (1670), and \"gallant\" novels,\r\nlike _Dietwald und Amelinde_ (1670) are of inferior interest. He died at\r\nRenchen on the 17th of August 1676, where a monument was erected to him\r\nin 1879.\r\n\r\n  Editions of _Simplicissimus_ and the _Simplicianische Schriften_ have\r\n  been published by A. von Keller (1854), H. Kurz (1863-1864), J.\r\n  Tittmann (1877) and F. Bobertag (1882). A reprint of the first edition\r\n  of the novel was edited by R. Kogel for the series of _Neudrucke des\r\n  16. und 17. Jahrhunderts_ (1880). See the introductions to these\r\n  editions; also F. Antoine, _Etude sur le Simplicissimus de\r\n  Grimmelshausen_ (1882) and E. Schmidt in his _Charakteristiken_, vol.\r\n  i. (1886).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIMOARD, PHILIPPE HENRI, COMTE DE (1753-1815), French soldier and\r\nmilitary writer, entered the royal army at the age of sixteen, and in\r\n1775 published his _Essai theorique et practique sur les batailles_.\r\nShortly afterwards Louis XVI. placed him in his own military cabinet and\r\nemployed him especially in connexion with schemes of army reform. By the\r\nyear of the Revolution he had become one of Louis's most valued\r\ncounsellors, in political as well as military matters, and was marked\r\nout, though only a colonel, as the next Minister of War. In 1791\r\nGrimoard was entrusted with the preparation of the scheme of defence for\r\nFrance, which proved two years later of great assistance to the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety. The events of 1792 put an end to his\r\nmilitary career, and the remainder of his life was spent in writing\r\nmilitary books.\r\n\r\n  The following works by him, besides his first essay, have retained\r\n  some importance: _Histoire des dernieres campagnes de Turenne_ (Paris,\r\n  1780), _Lettres et memoires de Turenne_ (Paris, 1780), _Troupes\r\n  legeres et leur emploi_ (Paris, 1782), _Conquetes de Gustave-Adolphe_\r\n  (Stockholm and Neufchatel, 1782-1791); _Memoires de Gustave Adolphe_\r\n  (Paris, 1790), Correspondence of Marshal Richelieu (Paris, 1789), St\r\n  Germain (1789), and Bernis (1790), _Vie et regne de Frederic le Grand_\r\n  (London, 1788), _Lettres et memoires du marechal de Saxe_ (Paris,\r\n  1794), _L'Expedition de Minorque en 1756_ (Paris, 1798), _Recherches\r\n  sur la force de l'armee francaise depuis Henri IV jusqu'en 1805_\r\n  (Paris, 1806), _Memoires du marechal de Tesse_ (Paris, 1806), _Lettres\r\n  de Bolingbroke_ (Paris, 1808), _Traite, sur le service d'etat-major_\r\n  (Paris, 1809), and (with Servan) _Tableau historique de la guerre de\r\n  la Revolution 1792-1794_ (Paris, 1808).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIMSBY, or GREAT GRIMSBY, a municipal, county and parliamentary borough\r\nof Lincolnshire, England; an important seaport near the mouth of the\r\nHumber on the south shore. Pop. (1901) 63,138. It is 155 m. N. by E.\r\nfrom London by the Great Northern railway, and is also served by the\r\nGreat Central railway. The church of St James, situated in the older\r\npart of the town, is a cruciform Early English building, retaining, in\r\nspite of injudicious restoration, many beautiful details. The chief\r\nbuildings are that containing the town hall and the grammar school (a\r\nfoundation of 1547), the exchange, a theatre, and the customs house and\r\ndock offices. A sailors' and fishermen's Harbour of Refuge, free\r\nlibrary, constitutional club and technical school are maintained. The\r\nduke of York public gardens were opened in 1894. Adjacent to Grimsby on\r\nthe east is the coastal watering-place of Cleethorpes.\r\n\r\nThe dock railway station lies a mile from the town station. In 1849 the\r\nGreat Central (then the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire) railway\r\ninitiated a scheme of reclamation and dock-construction. This was\r\ncompleted in 1854, and subsequent extensions were made. There are two\r\nlarge fish-docks, and, for general traffic, the Royal dock,\r\ncommunicating with the Humber through a tidal basin, the small Union\r\ndock, and the extensive Alexandra dock, together with graving docks,\r\ntimber yards, a patent slip, &c. These docks have an area of about 104\r\nacres, but were found insufficient for the growing traffic of the port,\r\nand in 1906 the construction of a large new dock, of about 40 acres'\r\narea and 30 to 35 ft. depth, was undertaken by the Great Central Company\r\nat Immingham, 5 m. above Grimsby on the Humber. The principal imports\r\nare butter, woollens, timber, cereals, eggs, glass, cottons, preserved\r\nmeat, wool, sugar and bacon. The exports consist chiefly of woollen\r\nyarn, woollens, cotton goods, cotton yarn, machinery, &c. and coal. It\r\nis as a fishing port, however, that Grimsby is chiefly famous. Two of\r\nthe docks are for the accommodation of the fishing fleet, which,\r\nconsisting principally of steam trawlers, numbers upwards of 500\r\nvessels. Regular passenger steamers run from Grimsby to Dutch and south\r\nSwedish ports, and to Esbjerg (Denmark), chiefly those of the Wilson\r\nline and the Great Central railway. The chief industries of Grimsby are\r\nshipbuilding, brewing, tanning, manufactures of ship tackle, ropes, ice\r\nfor preserving fish, turnery, flour, linseed cake, artificial manure;\r\nand there are saw mills, bone and corn mills, and creosote works. The\r\nmunicipal borough is under a mayor, 12 aldermen and 36 councillors.\r\nArea, 2852 acres.\r\n\r\nGrimsby (_Grimesbi_) is supposed to have been the landing-place of the\r\nDanes on their first invasion of Britain towards the close of the 8th\r\ncentury. It was a borough by prescription as early as 1201, in which\r\nyear King John granted the burgesses a charter of liberties according to\r\nthe custom of the burgesses of Northampton. Henry III. in 1227 granted\r\nto \"the mayor and good men\" of Grimsby, that they should hold the town\r\nfor a yearly rent of L111, and confirmed the same in 1271. These\r\ncharters were confirmed by later sovereigns. A governing charter, under\r\nthe title of mayor and burgesses, was given by James II. in 1688, and\r\nunder this the appointment of officers and other of the corporation,\r\narrangements are to a great extent regulated. In 1201 King John granted\r\nthe burgesses an annual fair for fifteen days, beginning on the 25th of\r\nMay. Two annual fairs are now held, namely on the first Monday in April\r\nand the second Monday in October. No early grant of a market can be\r\nfound, but in 1792 the market-day was Wednesday. In 1888 it had ceased\r\nto exist. Grimsby returned two members to the parliament of 1298, but in\r\n1833 the number was reduced to one.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Edward III. Grimsby was an important seaport, but the\r\nhaven became obstructed by sand and mud deposited by the Humber, and so\r\nthe access of large vessels was prevented. At the beginning of the 19th\r\ncentury a subscription was raised by the proprietors of land in the\r\nneighbourhood for improving the harbour, and an act was obtained by\r\nwhich they were incorporated under the title \"The Grimsby Haven Co.\" The\r\nfishing trade had become so important by 1800 that it was necessary to\r\nconstruct a new dock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIMSTON, SIR HARBOTTLE (1603-1685), English politician, second son of\r\nSir Harbottle Grimston, Bart. (d. 1648), was born at Bradfield Hall,\r\nnear Manningtree, on the 27th of January 1603. Educated at Emmanuel\r\nCollege, Cambridge, he became a barrister of Lincoln's Inn, then\r\nrecorder of Harwich and recorder of Colchester. As member for\r\nColchester, Grimston sat in the Short Parliament of 1640, and he\r\nrepresented the same borough during the Long Parliament, speedily\r\nbecoming a leading member of the popular party. He attacked Archbishop\r\nLaud with great vigour; was a member of the important committees of the\r\nparliament, including the one appointed in consequence of the attempted\r\nseizure of the five members; and became deputy-lieutenant of Essex after\r\nthe passing of the militia ordinance in January 1642. He disliked taking\r\nup arms against the king, but remained nominally an adherent of the\r\nparliamentary party during the Civil War. In the words of Clarendon, he\r\n\"continued rather than concurred with them.\" Grimston does not appear to\r\nhave taken the Solemn League and Covenant, but after the conclusion of\r\nthe first period of the war he again became more active. He was\r\npresident of the committee which investigated the escape of the king\r\nfrom Hampton Court in 1647, and was one of those who negotiated with\r\nCharles at Newport in 1648, when, according to Burnet, he fell upon his\r\nknees and urged the king to come to terms. From this time Grimston's\r\nsympathies appear to have been with the Royalists. Turned out of the\r\nHouse of Commons when the assembly was \"purged\" by colonel Pride, he was\r\nimprisoned; but was released after promising to do nothing detrimental\r\nto the parliament or the army, and spent the next few years in\r\nretirement. Before this time, his elder brother having already died, he\r\nhad succeeded his father as 2nd baronet. In 1656 Sir Harbottle was\r\nreturned to Cromwell's second parliament as member for Essex; but he was\r\nnot allowed to take his seat; and with 97 others who were similarly\r\ntreated he issued a remonstrance to the public. He was among the\r\nsecluded members who re-entered the Long Parliament in February 1660,\r\nwas then a member of the council of state, and was chosen Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Commons in the Convention Parliament of 1660. As Speaker he\r\nvisited Charles II. at Breda, and addressed him in very flattering terms\r\non his return to London; but he refused to accede to the king's demand\r\nthat he should dismiss Burnet from his position as chaplain to the\r\nMaster of the Rolls, and in parliament he strongly denounced any\r\nrelaxation of the laws against papists. Grimston did not retain the\r\noffice of Speaker after the dissolution of the Convention Parliament,\r\nbut he was a member of the commission which tried the regicides, and in\r\nNovember 1660 he was appointed Master of the Rolls. Report says he paid\r\nClarendon L8000 for the office, while Burnet declares he obtained it\r\n\"without any application of his own.\" He died on the 2nd of January\r\n1685. His friend and chaplain, Burnet, speaks very highly of his piety\r\nand impartiality, while not omitting the undoubted fact that he was\r\n\"much sharpened against popery.\" He translated the law reports of his\r\nfather-in-law, the judge, Sir George Croke (1560-1642), which were\r\nwritten in Norman-French, and five editions of this work have appeared.\r\nSeven of his parliamentary speeches were published, and he also wrote\r\n_Strena Christiana_ (London, 1644, and other editions). Grimston's first\r\nwife, Croke's daughter Mary, bore him six sons and two daughters; and by\r\nhis second wife, Anne, daughter and heiress of Sir Nathaniel Bacon,\r\nK.B., a grandson of Sir Nicholas Bacon, he had one daughter.\r\n\r\nOf his sons one only, Samuel (1643-1700), survived his father, and when\r\nhe died in October 1700 the baronetcy became extinct. Sir Harbottle's\r\neldest daughter, Mary, married Sir Capel Luckyn, Bart., and their\r\ngrandson, William Luckyn, succeeded to the estates of his great-uncle,\r\nSir Samuel Grimston, and took the name of Grimston in 1700. This William\r\nLuckyn Grimston (1683-1756) was created Baron Dunboyne and Viscount\r\nGrimston in the peerage of Ireland in 1719. He was succeeded as 2nd\r\nviscount by his son James (1711-1773), whose son James Bucknall\r\n(1747-1808) was made an English peer as baron Verulam of Gorhambury in\r\n1790. Then in 1815 his son James Walter (1775-1845), 2nd baron Verulam,\r\nwas created earl of Verulam, and the present peer is his direct\r\ndescendant. Sir Harbottle Grimston bought Sir Nicholas Bacon's estate\r\nat Gorhambury, which is still the residence of his descendants.\r\n\r\n  See G. Burnet, _History of My Own Time_, edited by O. Airy (Oxford,\r\n  1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIMTHORPE, EDMUND BECKETT, 1ST BARON (1816-1905), son of Sir Edmund\r\nBeckett Denison, was born on the 12th of May 1816. He was educated at\r\nDoncaster and Eton, whence he proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge,\r\nand graduated thirtieth wrangler in 1838. He was called to the bar at\r\nLincoln's Inn in 1841. Upon succeeding to the baronetcy in 1874 he\r\ndropped the name of Denison, which his father had assumed in 1816. From\r\n1877 to 1900 he was chancellor and vicar-general of York, and he was\r\nraised to the peerage in 1886. He was made a Q.C. in 1854, and was for\r\nmany years a leader of the Parliamentary Bar. He devoted himself to the\r\nstudy of astronomy, horology and architecture, more especially Gothic\r\necclesiastical architecture. As early as 1850 he had become a recognized\r\nauthority on clocks, watches and bells, and in particular on the\r\nconstruction of turret clocks, for he had designed Dent's Great\r\nExhibition clock, and his _Rudimentary Treatise_ had gone through many\r\neditions. In 1851 he was called upon, in conjunction with the astronomer\r\nroyal (Mr, afterwards Sir, G. B. Airy) and Mr Dent, to design a suitable\r\nclock for the new Houses of Parliament. The present tower clock,\r\npopularly known as \"Big Ben,\" was constructed after Lord Grimthorpe's\r\ndesigns. In a number of burning questions during his time Lord\r\nGrimthorpe took a prominent part. It is, however, in connexion with the\r\nrestoration of St Albans Abbey that he is most widely known. The St\r\nAlbans Abbey Reparation Committee, which had been in existence since\r\n1871, and for which Sir Gilbert Scott had carried out some admirable\r\nrepairs, obtained a faculty from the Diocesan Court in 1877 to repair\r\nand restore the church and fit it for cathedral and parochial services.\r\nVery soon, however, the committee found itself unable to raise the\r\nnecessary funds, and it was at this juncture that a new faculty was\r\ngranted to Lord Grimthorpe (then Sir Edmund Beckett) to \"restore, repair\r\nand refit\" the abbey at his own expense. Lord Grimthorpe made it an\r\nexpress stipulation that the work should be done according to his own\r\ndesigns and under his own supervision. His public spirit in undertaking\r\nthe task was undeniable, but his treatment of the roof, the new west\r\nfront, and the windows inserted in the terminations of the transepts,\r\nexcited a storm of adverse criticism, and was the subject of vigorous\r\nprotests from the professional world of architecture. He died on the\r\n29th of April 1905, being succeeded as 2nd baron by his nephew, E. W.\r\nBeckett (b. 1856), who had sat in parliament as conservative member for\r\nthe Whitby division of Yorkshire from 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRINDAL, EDMUND (c. 1519-1583), successively bishop of London,\r\narchbishop of York and archbishop of Canterbury, born about 1519, was\r\nson of William Grindal, a farmer of Hensingham, in the parish of St\r\nBees, Cumberland. He was educated at Magdalene and Christ's Colleges and\r\nthen at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. and was\r\nelected fellow in 1538. He proceeded M.A. in 1541, was ordained deacon\r\nin 1544 and was proctor and Lady Margaret preacher in 1548-1549.\r\nProbably through the influence of Ridley, who had been master of\r\nPembroke Hall, Grindal was selected as one of the Protestant disputants\r\nduring the visitation of 1549. He had a considerable talent for this\r\nwork and was often employed on similar occasions. When Ridley became\r\nbishop of London, he made Grindal one of his chaplains and gave him the\r\nprecentorship of St Paul's. He was soon promoted to be one of Edward\r\nVI.'s chaplains and prebendary of Westminster, and in October 1552 was\r\none of the six divines to whom the Forty-two articles were submitted for\r\nexamination before being sanctioned by the Privy Council. According to\r\nKnox, Grindal distinguished himself from most of the court preachers in\r\n1553 by denouncing the worldliness of the courtiers and foretelling the\r\nevils to follow on the king's death.\r\n\r\nThat event frustrated Grindal's proposed elevation to the episcopal\r\nbench and he did not consider himself bound to await the evils which he\r\nhad foretold. He abandoned his preferments on Mary's accession and made\r\nhis way to Strassburg. Thence, like so many of the Marian exiles, he\r\nproceeded to Frankfurt, where he endeavoured to compose the disputes\r\nbetween the \"Coxians\" (see COX, RICHARD), who regarded the 1552 Prayer\r\nBook as the perfection of reform, and the Knoxians, who wanted further\r\nsimplification. He returned to England in January 1559, was appointed\r\none of the committee to revise the liturgy, and one of the Protestant\r\nrepresentatives at the Westminster conference. In July he was also\r\nelected Master of Pembroke Hall in succession to the recusant Dr Thomas\r\nYoung (1514-1580) and Bishop of London in succession to Bonner.\r\n\r\nGrindal himself was, however, inclined to be recalcitrant from different\r\nmotives. He had qualms about vestments and other traces of \"popery\" as\r\nwell as about the Erastianism of Elizabeth's ecclesiastical government.\r\nHis Protestantism was robust enough; he did not mind recommending that a\r\npriest \"might be put to some torment\" (_Hatfield MSS._ i. 269); and in\r\nOctober 1562 he wrote to Cecil begging to know \"if that second Julian,\r\nthe king of Navarre, is killed; as he intended to preach at St Paul's\r\nCross, and might take occasion to mention God's judgements on him\"\r\n(_Domestic Cal._, 1547-1580, p. 209). But he was loth to execute\r\njudgments upon English Puritans, and modern high churchmen complain of\r\nhis infirmity of purpose, his opportunism and his failure to give Parker\r\nadequate assistance in rebuilding the shattered fabric of the English\r\nChurch. Grindal lacked that firm faith in the supreme importance of\r\nuniformity and autocracy which enabled Whitgift to persecute with a\r\nclear conscience nonconformists whose theology was indistinguishable\r\nfrom his own. Perhaps he was as wise as his critics; at any rate the\r\nrigour which he repudiated hardly brought peace or strength to the\r\nChurch when practised by his successors, and London, which was always a\r\ndifficult see, involved Bishop Sandys in similar troubles when Grindal\r\nhad gone to York. As it was, although Parker said that Grindal \"was not\r\nresolute and severe enough for the government of London,\" his attempts\r\nto enforce the use of the surplice evoked angry protests, especially in\r\n1565, when considerable numbers of the nonconformists were suspended;\r\nand Grindal of his own motion denounced Cartwright to the Council in\r\n1570. Other anxieties were brought upon him by the burning of his\r\ncathedral in 1561, for although Grindal himself is said to have\r\ncontributed L1200 towards its rebuilding, the laity of his diocese were\r\nniggardly with their subscriptions and even his clergy were not liberal.\r\n\r\nIn 1570 Grindal was translated to the archbishopric of York, where\r\nPuritans were few and coercion would be required mainly for Roman\r\nCatholics. His first letter from Cawood to Cecil told that he had not\r\nbeen well received, that the gentry were not \"well-affected to godly\r\nreligion and among the common people many superstitious practices\r\nremained.\" It is admitted by his Anglican critics that he did the work\r\nof enforcing uniformity against the Roman Catholics with good-will and\r\nconsiderable tact. He must have given general satisfaction, for even\r\nbefore Parker's death two persons so different as Burghley and Dean\r\nNowell independently recommended Grindal's appointment as his successor,\r\nand Spenser speaks warmly of him in the _Shepherd's Calendar_ as the\r\n\"gentle shepherd Algrind.\" Burghley wished to conciliate the moderate\r\nPuritans and advised Grindal to mitigate the severity which had\r\ncharacterized Parker's treatment of the nonconformists. Grindal indeed\r\nattempted a reform of the ecclesiastical courts, but his metropolitical\r\nactivity was cut short by a conflict with the arbitrary temper of the\r\nqueen. Elizabeth required Grindal to suppress the \"prophesyings\" or\r\nmeetings for discussion which had come into vogue among the Puritan\r\nclergy, and she even wanted him to discourage preaching; she would have\r\nno doctrine that was not inspired by her authority. Grindal\r\nremonstrated, claiming some voice for the Church, and in June 1577 was\r\nsuspended from his jurisdictional, though not his spiritual, functions\r\nfor disobedience. He stood firm, and in January 1578 Secretary Wilson\r\ninformed Burghley that the queen wished to have the archbishop deprived.\r\nShe was dissuaded from this extreme course, but Grindal's sequestration\r\nwas continued in spite of a petition from Convocation in 1581 for his\r\nreinstatement. Elizabeth then suggested that he should resign; this he\r\ndeclined to do, and after making an apology to the queen he was\r\nreinstated towards the end of 1582. But his infirmities were increasing,\r\nand while making preparations for his resignation, he died on the 6th of\r\nJuly 1583 and was buried in Croydon parish church. He left considerable\r\nbenefactions to Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, Queen's College, Oxford, and\r\nChrist's College, Cambridge; he also endowed a free school at St Bees,\r\nand left money for the poor of St Bees, Canterbury, Lambeth and Croydon.\r\n\r\n  Strype's _Life of Grindal_ is the principal authority; see also _Dict.\r\n  Nat.

P.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRINDELWALD, a valley in the Bernese Oberland, and one of the chief\r\nresorts of tourists in Switzerland. It is shut in on the south by the\r\nprecipices of the Wetterhorn, Mettenberg and Eiger, between which two\r\nfamous glaciers flow down. On the north it is sheltered by the Faulhorn\r\nrange, while on the east the Great Scheidegg Pass leads over to\r\nMeiringen; and on the south-west the Little Scheidegg or Wengern Alp\r\n(railway 11-1/2 m. across) divides it from Lauterbrunnen. The main\r\nvillage is connected with Interlaken by a rack railway (13 m.). The\r\nvalley is very green, and possesses excellent pastures, as well as fruit\r\ntrees, though little corn is grown. It is watered by the Black\r\nLutschine, a tributary of the Aar. The height of the parish church above\r\nthe sea-level is 3468 ft. The population in 1900 was 3346, practically\r\nall Protestant and German-speaking, and living in 558 houses. The\r\nglacier guides are among the best in the Alps. The valley was originally\r\ninhabited by the serfs of various great lords in summer for the sake of\r\npasturage. A chapel in a cave was superseded about 1146 by a wooden\r\nchurch, replaced about 1180 by a stone church, which was pulled down in\r\n1793 to erect the present building. Gradually the Austin canons of\r\nInterlaken bought out all the other owners in the valley, but when that\r\nhouse was suppressed in 1528 by the town of Bern the inhabitants gained\r\ntheir freedom. The houses near the hotel Adler bear the name of\r\nGydisdorf, but there is no village of Grindelwald properly speaking,\r\nthough that name is usually given to the assemblage of hotels and shops\r\nbetween Gydisdorf and the railway station. Grindelwald is now very much\r\nfrequented by visitors in winter.\r\n\r\n  See W. A. B. Coolidge, _Walks and Excursions in the Valley of\r\n  Grindelwald_ (also in French and German) (Grindelwald, 1900); Emmanuel\r\n  Friedli, _Barndutsch als Spiegel bernischen Volkstums_, vol. ii.\r\n  (Grindelwald, Bern, 1908); E.

(W. A. B. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRINGOIRE (or GRINGORE), PIERRE (c. 1480-1539), French poet and\r\ndramatist, was born about the year 1480, probably at Caen. In his first\r\nwork, _Le Chasteau de labour_ (1499), a didactic poem in praise of\r\ndiligence, he narrates the troubles following on marriage. A young\r\ncouple are visited by Care, Need, Discomfort, &c.; and other personages\r\ncommon to medieval allegories take part in the action. In November 1501\r\nGringoire was in Paris directing the production of a mystery play in\r\nhonour of the archduke Philip of Austria, and in subsequent years he\r\nreceived many similar commissions. The fraternity of the _Enfans sans\r\nSouci_ advanced him to the dignity of _Mere Sotte_ and afterwards to the\r\nhighest honour of the gild, that of _Prince des Sots_. For twenty years\r\nGringoire seems to have been at the head of this illustrious confrerie.\r\nAs _Prince des Sots_ he exercised an extraordinary influence. At no time\r\nwas the stage, rude and coarse as it was, more popular as a true\r\nexponent of the popular mind. Gringoire's success lay in the fact that\r\nhe followed, but did not attempt to lead; on his stage the people saw\r\nexhibited their passions, their judgments of the moment, their\r\njealousies, their hatreds and their ambitions. Brotherhoods of the kind\r\nexisted all over France. In Paris there were the _Enfans sans Souci_,\r\nthe _Basochiens_, the _Confrerie de la Passion_ and the _Souverain\r\nEmpire de Galilee_; at Dijon there were the _Mere Folle_ and her family;\r\nin Flanders the _Societe des Arbaletriers_ played comedies; at Rouen the\r\n_Cornards_ or _Conards_ yielded to none in vigour and fearlessness of\r\nsatire. On Shrove Tuesday 1512 Gringoire, who was the accredited\r\ndefender of the policy of Louis XII., and had already written many\r\npolitical poems, represented the _Jeu du Prince des Sots et Mere Sotte_.\r\nIt was at the moment when the French dispute with Julius II. was at its\r\nheight. _Mere Sotte_ was disguised as the Church, and disputed the\r\nquestion of the temporal power with the prince. The political meaning\r\nwas even more thinly veiled in the second part of the entertainment, a\r\nmorality named _L'Homme obstine_, the principal personage representing\r\nthe pope. The performance concluded with a farce. Gringoire adopted for\r\nhis device on the frontispiece of this trilogy, _Tout par Raison_,\r\n_Raison par Tout_, _Par tout Raison_. He has been called the\r\n_Aristophane des Halles_. In one respect at least he resembles\r\nAristophanes. He is serious in his merriment; there is purpose behind\r\nhis extravagances. The Church was further attacked in a poem printed\r\nabout 1510, _La Chasse du cerf des cerfs_ (_serf des serfs_, i.e.\r\n_servus servorum_), under which title that of the pope is thinly veiled.\r\nAbout 1514 he wrote his mystery of the _Vie de Monseigneur Saint-Louis\r\npar personnages_ in nine books for the _confrerie_ of the masons and\r\ncarpenters. He became in 1518 herald at the court of Lorraine, with the\r\ntitle of Vaudemont, and married Catherine Roger, a lady of gentle birth.\r\nDuring the last twenty years of a long life he became orthodox, and\r\ndedicated a _Blason des heretiques_ to the duke of Lorraine. There is no\r\nrecord of the payment of his salary as a herald after Christmas 1538, so\r\nthat he died probably in 1539.\r\n\r\n  His works were edited by C. d'Hericault and A. de Montaiglon for the\r\n  _Bibliotheque elzevirienne_ in 1858. This edition was incomplete, and\r\n  was supplemented by a second volume in 1877 by Montaiglon and M. James\r\n  de Rothschild. These volumes include the works already mentioned,\r\n  except _Le Chasteau de labour_, and in addition, _Les Folles\r\n  Entreprises_ (1505), a collection of didactic and satirical poems,\r\n  chiefly ballades and rondeaux, one section of which is devoted to the\r\n  exposition of the tyranny of the nobles, and another to the vices of\r\n  the clergy; _L'Entreprise de Venise_ (c. 1509), a poem in seven-lined\r\n  stanzas, giving a list of the Venetian fortresses which belonged,\r\n  according to Gringoire, to other powers; _L'Espoir de paix_ (1st ed.\r\n  not dated; another, 1510), a verse treatise on the deeds of \"certain\r\n  popes of Rome,\" dedicated to Louis XII.; and _La Coqueluche_ (1510), a\r\n  verse description of an epidemic, apparently influenza. For details of\r\n  his other satires, _Les Abus du monde_ (1509), _Complainte de trop\r\n  tard marie, Les Fantasies du monde qui regne_; of his religious verse,\r\n  _Chants royaux_ (on the Passion, 1527), _Heures de Notre Dame_ (1525);\r\n  and a collection of tales in prose and verse, taken from the _Gesta\r\n  Romanorum_, entitled _Les Fantasies de Mere Sotte_ (1516), see G.\r\n  Brunet, _Manuel du libraire_ (_s.v._ Gringore). Most of Gringoire's\r\n  works conclude with an acrostic giving the name of the author. The\r\n  _Chasteau de labour_ was translated into English by Alexander Barclay\r\n  and printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1506. Barclay's translation was\r\n  edited (1905) with his original for the Roxburghe Club by Mr A. W.\r\n  Pollard, who provided an account of Gringoire, and a bibliography of\r\n  the book. See also, for the _Jeu du Prince des Sots_, Petit de\r\n  Julleville, _La Comedie et les moeurs en France au moyen age_, pp.\r\n  151-168 (Paris, 1886); for _Saint Louis_, the same author's _Les\r\n  Mysteres_, i. 331 et seq., ii. 583-597 (1880), with further\r\n  bibliographical references; and E. Picot, _Gringore et les comediens\r\n  italiens_ (1877). The real Gringoire cannot be said to have many\r\n  points of resemblance with the poet described in Victor Hugo's\r\n  _Notre-Dame de Paris_, nor is there more foundation in fact for the\r\n  one-act prose comedy of Theodore de Banville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRINNELL, a city in Poweshiek county, Iowa, U.S.A., 55 m. E. by N. of\r\nDes Moines. Pop. (1900) 3860, of whom 274 were foreign-born; (1905)\r\n4634; (1910) 5036. Grinnell is served by the Chicago, Rock Island &\r\nPacific, and the Iowa Central railways. It is the seat of Iowa College\r\n(co-educational), founded in 1847 by the Iowa Band (Congregationalists\r\nand graduates of New England colleges and Andover Theological Seminary,\r\nwho had devoted themselves to home missionary educational work in Iowa,\r\nand who came to Iowa in 1843), and by a few earlier pioneers from New\r\nEngland. The college opened in 1848 at Davenport, and in 1859 removed to\r\nGrinnell, where there was a school called Grinnell University, which it\r\nabsorbed. Closely affiliated with the college are the Grinnell Academy\r\nand the Grinnell School of Music. In 1907-1908 the College had 463\r\nstudents, the Academy had 129 students, and the School of Music had 141\r\nstudents. Among the manufactures are carriages and gloves. The city was\r\nnamed in honour of one of its founders, Josiah Bushnell Grinnell\r\n(1821-1891), a Congregational clergyman, friend of and sympathizer with\r\nJohn Brown, and from 1863 to 1867 a member of the National House of\r\nRepresentatives. Grinnell was settled in 1854, was incorporated as a\r\ntown in 1865, and in 1882 was chartered as a city of the second class.\r\nIn 1882 it suffered severely from a cyclone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIQUALAND EAST and GRIQUALAND WEST, territorial divisions of the Cape\r\nProvince of the Union of South Africa. Griqualand East, which lies south\r\nof Basutoland and west of Natal, is so named from the settlement there\r\nin 1862 of Griquas under Adam Kok. It forms part of the Transkeian\r\nTerritories of the Cape, and is described under KAFFRARIA. Griqualand\r\nWest, formerly Griqualand simply, also named after its Griqua\r\ninhabitants, is part of the great tableland of South Africa. It is\r\nbounded S. by the Orange river, W. and N. by Bechuanaland, E. by the\r\nTransvaal and Orange Free State Province, and has an area of 15,197 sq.\r\nm. It has a general elevation of 3000 to 4000 ft. above the sea, low\r\nranges of rocky hills, the Kaap, Asbestos, Vansittart and Langeberg\r\nmountains, traversing its western portion in a general N.E.-S.W.\r\ndirection. The only perennial rivers are in the eastern district,\r\nthrough which the Vaal flows from a point a little above Fourteen\r\nStreams to its junction with the Orange (160 m.). In this part of its\r\ncourse the Vaal receives the Harts river from the north and the Riet\r\nfrom the east. The Riet, 4 m. within the Griqualand frontier, is joined\r\nby the Modder. The banks of the rivers are shaded by willows; elsewhere\r\nthe only tree is the mimosa. The greater part of the country is barren,\r\nmerging N.W. into absolute desert. The soil is, however, wherever\r\nirrigated, extremely fertile. The day climate is hot and dry, but the\r\nnights are frequently cold. Rain rarely falls, though thunderstorms of\r\ngreat severity occasionally sweep over the land, and sandstorms are\r\nprevalent in the summer. A portion of the country is adapted for\r\nsheep-farming and the growing of crops, horse-breeding is carried on at\r\nKimberley, and asbestos is worked in the south-western districts, but\r\nthe wealth of Griqualand West lies in its diamonds, which are found\r\nalong the banks of the Vaal and in the district between that river and\r\nthe Riet. From the first discovery of diamonds in 1867 up to the end of\r\n1905 the total yield of diamonds was estimated at 13-1/2 tons, worth\r\nL95,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe chief town is Kimberley (q.v.), the centre of the diamond mining\r\nindustry. It is situated on the railway from Cape Town to the Zambezi,\r\nwhich crosses the country near its eastern border. Three miles south of\r\nKimberley is Beaconsfield (q.v.). On the banks of the Vaal are Barkly\r\nWest (q.v.), Windsorton (pop. 800) and Warrenton (pop. 1500); at all\r\nthese places are river diggings, diamonds being found along the river\r\nfrom Fourteen Streams to the Harts confluence. Warrenton is 44 m. N. by\r\nrail from Kimberley. Douglas (pop. 300), on the south bank of the Vaal,\r\n12 m. above its confluence with the Orange, is the centre of an\r\nagricultural district, a canal 9-1/2 m. long serving to irrigate a\r\nconsiderable area. Thirty-five miles N.W. of Douglas is Griquatown (pop.\r\n401), the headquarters of the first Griqua settlers. Campbell (pop. 250)\r\nis 30 m. E. of Griquatown, and Postmasburg 42 m. N. by W. A census taken\r\nin 1877 showed the population of Griqualand West to be 45,277, of whom\r\n12,347 were whites. At the census of 1891 the population was 83,215, of\r\nwhom 29,602 were whites, and in 1904 the population was 108,498, of whom\r\n32,570 were whites.\r\n\r\n_History._--Before the settlement in it of Griqua clans the district was\r\nthinly inhabited by Bushmen and Hottentots. At the end of the 18th\r\ncentury a horde known as Bastaards, descendants of Dutch farmers and\r\nHottentot women, led a nomadic life on the plains south of the Orange\r\nriver. In 1803 a missionary named Anderson induced a number of the\r\nBastaards with their chief Barend Barends to settle north of the river,\r\nand a mission station was formed at a place where there was a strong\r\nflowing fountain, which has now disappeared, which gave the name of\r\nKlaarwater to what is now known as Griquatown or Griquastad. Klaarwater\r\nbecame a retreat for other Bastaards, Hottentot refugees, Kaffirs and\r\nBechuanas. From Little Namaqualand came a few half-breeds and others\r\nunder the leadership of Adam Kok, son of Cornelius Kok and grandson of\r\nAdam Kok (c. 1710-1795), a man of mixed white and Hottentot blood who is\r\nregarded as the founder of the modern Griquas. The settlement prospered,\r\nand in 1813, at the instance of the Rev. John Campbell, who had been\r\nsent by the London Missionary Society to inspect the country, the\r\ntribesmen abandoned the name of Bastaards in favour of that of\r\nGriquas,[1] some of them professing descent from a Hottentot tribe,\r\noriginally settled near Saldanha Bay, called by the early Dutch settlers\r\nat the Cape Chariguriqua or Grigriqua. Under the guidance of\r\nmissionaries the Griquas made some progress in civilization, and many\r\nprofessed Christianity. Adam Kok and Barends having moved eastward in\r\n1820, those who remained behind elected as their head man a teacher in\r\nthe mission school named Andries Waterboer, who successfully\r\nadministered the settlement, and by defeating the Makololo raiders\r\ngreatly increased the prestige of the tribe. Meanwhile Adam Kok and his\r\ncompanions had occupied part of the country between the Modder and\r\nOrange rivers. In 1825 Kok settled at the mission station of Philippolis\r\n(founded two years previously), and in a short time had exterminated the\r\nBushmen inhabiting that region. He died about 1835, and after a period\r\nof civil strife was succeeded by his younger son, Adam Kok III. This\r\nchief in November 1843 signed a treaty placing himself under British\r\nprotection. Many Dutch farmers were settled on the land he claimed. In\r\n1845 he received British military aid in a contest with the white\r\nsettlers, and in 1848 helped the British under Sir Harry Smith against\r\nthe Boers (see ORANGE FREE STATE: _History_). Eventually finding himself\r\nstraitened by the Boers of the newly established Orange Free State, he\r\nremoved in 1861-1863 with his people, some 3000 in number, to the region\r\n(then depopulated by Kaffir wars) now known as Griqualand East. His\r\nsovereign rights to all territory north of the Orange he sold to the\r\nFree State for L4000. He founded Kokstad (q.v.) and died in 1876.\r\nWaterboer, the principal Griqua chief, had entered into treaty relations\r\nwith the British government as early as 1834, and he received a subsidy\r\nof L150 a year. He proved a stanch ally of the British, and kept the\r\npeace on the Cape frontier to the day of his death in 1852. He was\r\nsucceeded by his son Nicholas Waterboer, under whom the condition of the\r\nGriquas declined--a decline induced by the indolence of the people and\r\nintensified by the drying up of the water supplies, cattle plague and\r\nbrandy drinking. During this period white settlers acquired farms in the\r\ncountry, and the loss of their independence by the Griquas became\r\ninevitable. The discovery of diamonds along the banks of the Vaal in\r\n1867 entirely altered the fortunes of the country, and by the end of\r\n1869 the rush to the alluvial diggings had begun. At the diggers' camps\r\nthe Griquas exercised no authority, but over part of the district the\r\nSouth African Republic and the Orange Free State claimed sovereignty. At\r\nKlip Drift (now Barkly West) the diggers formed a regular government and\r\nelected Theodore Parker as their president. Most of the diggers being\r\nBritish subjects, the high commissioner of South Africa interfered, and\r\na Cape official was appointed magistrate at Klip Drift, President Parker\r\nresigning office in February 1871. At this time the \"dry diggings,\" of\r\nwhich Kimberley is the centre, had been discovered,[2] and over the\r\nminers there the Orange Free State asserted jurisdiction. The land was,\r\nhowever, claimed by Nicholas Waterboer, who, on the advice of his agent,\r\nDavid Arnot, petitioned the British to take over his country. This Great\r\nBritain consented to do, and on the 27th of October 1871 proclamations\r\nwere issued by the high commissioner receiving Waterboer and his\r\nGriquas as British subjects and defining the limits of his territory. In\r\naddition to the Kimberley district this territory included that part of\r\nthe diamondiferous area which had been claimed by the Transvaal, but\r\nwhich had been declared, as the result of the arbitration of R. W.\r\nKeate, lieutenant-governor of Natal, part of Waterboer's land. On the\r\n4th of November a small party of Cape Mounted Police took possession of\r\nthe dry diggings and hoisted the British flag. Shortly afterwards the\r\nrepresentative of the Orange Free State withdrew. The Free State was\r\ngreatly incensed by the action of the British government, but the\r\ndispute as to the sovereignty was settled in 1876 by the payment of\r\nL90,000 by the British to the Free State as compensation for any injury\r\ninflicted on the state.\r\n\r\nThe diggers, who under the nominal rule of the Transvaal and Free State\r\nhad enjoyed practical independence, found the new government did little\r\nfor their benefit, and a period of disorder ensued, which was not put an\r\nend to by the appointment in January 1873 of Mr (afterwards Sir) Richard\r\nSouthey[3] as sole administrator, in place of the three commissioners\r\nwho had previously exercised authority. In the July following the\r\nterritory was made a crown colony and Southey's title changed to that of\r\nlieutenant-governor. The government remained unpopular, the diggers\r\ncomplaining of its unrepresentative character, the heavy taxation\r\nexacted, and the inadequate protection of property. They formed a\r\nsociety for mutual protection, and the discontent was so great that an\r\narmed force was sent (early in 1875) from the Cape to overawe the\r\nagitators. At the same time measures were taken to render the government\r\nmore popular. The settlement of the dispute with the Free State paved\r\nthe way for the annexation of Griqualand to the Cape Colony on the 15th\r\nof October 1880.\r\n\r\n  See KIMBERLEY, CAPE COLONY, TRANSVAAL and ORANGE FREE STATE.

From 1864\r\n    to 1872 he was colonial secretary at the Cape. He gave up his\r\n    appointment in Griqualand West in 1875, and lived thereafter in\r\n    retirement.

The frescoes of the roof of the Sistine\r\nchapel have portions of the design in _grisaille_. At Hampton Court the\r\nlower part of the decoration of the great staircase by Verrio is in\r\n_grisaille_. The term is also applied to monochrome painting in enamels,\r\nand also to stained glass; a fine example of _grisaille_ glass is in the\r\nwindow known as the Five Sisters, at the end of the north transept in\r\nYork cathedral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRISELDA, a heroine of romance. She is said to have been the wife of\r\nWalter, marquis of Saluces or Saluzzo, in the 11th century, and her\r\nmisfortunes were considered to belong to history when they were handled\r\nby Boccaccio and Petrarch, although the probability is that Boccaccio\r\nborrowed his narrative from a Provencal _fabliau_. He included it in the\r\nrecitations of the tenth day (_Decamerone_), and must have written it\r\nabout 1350. Petrarch related it in a Latin letter in 1373, and his\r\ntranslation formed the basis of much of the later literature. The letter\r\nwas printed by Ulrich Zel about 1470, and often subsequently. It was\r\ntranslated into French as _La Patience de Griselidis_ and printed at\r\nBrehan-Loudeac in 1484, and its popularity is shown by the number of\r\nearly editions quoted by Brunet (_Manuel du libraire, s.v._ Petrarca).\r\nThe story was dramatized in 1395, and a _Mystere de Griselidis, marquise\r\nde Saluses par personnaiges_ was printed by Jehan Bonfons (no date).\r\nChaucer followed Petrarch's version in the _Canterbury Tales_. Ralph\r\nRadcliffe, who flourished under Henry VIII., is said to have written a\r\nplay on the subject, and the story was dramatized by Thomas Dekker,\r\nHenry Chettle and W. Haughton in 1603.\r\n\r\n  An example of the many ballads of Griselda is given in T. Deloney's\r\n  _Garland of Good Will_ (1685), and the 17th-century chap-book, _The\r\n  History of Patient Grisel_ (1619), was edited by H. B. Wheatley (1885)\r\n  for the Villon Society with a bibliographical and literary\r\n  introduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRISI, GIULIA (1811-1869), Italian opera-singer, daughter of one of\r\nNapoleon's Italian officers, was born in Milan. She came of a family of\r\nmusical gifts, her maternal aunt Josephina Grassini (1773-1850) being a\r\nfavourite opera-singer both on the continent and in London; her mother\r\nhad also been a singer, and her elder sister Giudetta and her cousin\r\nCarlotta were both exceedingly talented. Giulia was trained to a musical\r\ncareer, and made her stage debut in 1828. Rossini and Bellini both took\r\nan interest in her, and at Milan she was the first Adalgisa in Bellini's\r\n_Norma_, in which Pasta took the title-part. Grisi appeared in Paris in\r\n1832, as Semiramide in Rossini's opera, and had a great success; and in\r\n1834 she appeared in London. Her voice was a brilliant dramatic soprano,\r\nand her established position as a prima donna continued for thirty\r\nyears. She was a particularly fine actress, and in London opera her\r\nassociation with such singers as Lablache, Rubini, Tamburini and Mario\r\nwas long remembered as the palmy days of Italian opera. In 1854 she\r\ntoured with Mario In America. She had married Count de Melcy in 1836,\r\nbut this ended in a divorce; and in 1856 she married Mario (q.v.). She\r\ndied in Berlin on the 29th of November 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRISON (_Galictis vittata_), a carnivorous mammal, of the family\r\n_Mustelidae_, common in Central and South America and Mexico. It is\r\nabout the size of a marten, and has the upper surface of a bluish-grey\r\ntint, and the under surface is dark brown. The grison lives on small\r\nmammals and birds, and in settled districts is destructive to poultry.\r\nAllamand's grison (_G. allamandi_), with the same range, is somewhat\r\nlarger. Another member of the genus is the tayra or taira (_G.\r\nbarbara_), about as large as an otter, with a range from Mexico to\r\nArgentina. This species hunts in companies (see CARNIVORA).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRISONS (Ger. _Graubunden_), the most easterly of the Swiss cantons and\r\nalso the largest in extent, though relatively the most sparsely\r\npopulated. Its total area is 2753.2 sq. m., of which 1634.4 sq. m. are\r\nclassed as \"productive\" (forests covering 503.1 sq. m. and vineyards 1.3\r\nsq. m.), but it has also 138.6 sq. m. of glaciers, ranking in this\r\nrespect next after the Valais and before Bern. The whole canton is\r\nmountainous, the principal glacier groups being those of the Todi, N.\r\n(11,887 ft.), of Medels, S.W. (Piz Medel, 10,509 ft.), of the Rheinwald\r\nor the Adula Alps, S.W. (Rheinwaldhorn, 11,149 ft.), with the chief\r\nsource of the Rhine, of the Bernina, S.E. (Piz Bernina, 13,304 ft.), the\r\nmost extensive, of the Albula, E. (Piz Kesch, 11,228 ft.), and of the\r\nSilvretta, N.E. (Piz Linard, 11,201 ft.). The principal valleys are\r\nthose of the upper Rhine and of the upper Inn (or Engadine, q.v.). The\r\nthree main sources of the Rhine are in the canton. The valley of the\r\nVorder Rhine is called the Bundner Oberland, that of the Mittel Rhine\r\nthe Val Medels, and that of the Hinter Rhine (the principal), in\r\ndifferent parts of its course, the Rheinwald, the Schams valley and the\r\nDomleschg valley, while the upper valley of the Julia is named the\r\nOberhalbstein. The chief affluents of the Rhine in the canton are the\r\nGlenner (flowing through the Lugnetz valley), the Avers Rhine, the\r\nAlbula (swollen by the Julia and the Landwasser), the Plessur (Schanfigg\r\nvalley) and the Landquart (coming from the Prattigau). The Rhine and the\r\nInn flow respectively into the North and the Black Seas. Of other\r\nstreams that of Val Mesocco joins the Ticino and so the Po, while the\r\nMaira or Mera (Val Bregaglia) and the Poschiavino join the Adda, and the\r\nRambach (Munster valley) the Adige, all four thus ultimately reaching\r\nthe Adriatic Sea. The inner valleys are the highest in Central Europe,\r\nand among the loftiest villages are Juf, 6998 ft. (the highest\r\npermanently inhabited village in the Alps), at the head of the Avers\r\nglen, and St Moritz, 6037 ft., in the Upper Engadine. The lower courses\r\nof the various streams are rent by remarkable gorges, such as the Via\r\nMala, the Rofna, the Schyn, and those in the Avers, Medels and Lugnetz\r\nglens, as well as that of the Zuge in the Landwasser glen. Below Coire,\r\nnear Malans, good wine is produced, while in the Val Mesocco, &c., maize\r\nand chestnuts flourish. But the forests and the mountain pasturages are\r\nthe chief source of wealth. The lower pastures maintain a fine breed of\r\ncows, while the upper are let out in summer to Bergamasque shepherds.\r\nThere are many mineral springs, such as those of St Moritz, Schuls,\r\nAlvaneu, Fideris, Le Prese and San Bernardino. The climate and\r\nvegetation, save on the southern slope of the Alps, are alpine and\r\nsevere. But yearly vast numbers of strangers visit different spots in\r\nthe canton, especially Davos (q.v.), Arosa and the Engadine. As yet\r\nthere are comparatively few railways. There is one from Maienfeld\r\n(continued north to Constance and north-west to Zurich) to Coire (11\r\nm.), which sends off a branch line from Landquart, E., past Klosters to\r\nDavos (31 m.). From Coire the line bears west to Reichenau (6 m.),\r\nwhence one branch runs S.S.E. beneath the Albula Pass to St Moritz (50\r\nm.), and another S.W. up the Hinter Rhine valley to Ilanz (20-1/2 m.).\r\nThere are, however, a number of fine carriage roads across the passes\r\nleading to or towards Italy. Besides those leading to the Engadine may\r\nbe noted the roads from Ilanz past Disentis over the Oberalp Pass (6719\r\nft.) to Andermatt, from Disentis over the Lukmanier Pass (6289 ft.) to\r\nBiasca, on the St Gotthard railway, from Reichenau past Thusis and\r\nSplugen over the San Bernardino Pass (6769 ft.) to Bellinzona on the\r\nsame railway line, and from Splugen over the Splugen Pass (6946 ft.) to\r\nChiavenna. The Septimer Pass (7582 ft.) from the Julier route to the\r\nMaloja route has now only a mule path, but was probably known in Roman\r\ntimes (as was possibly the Splugen), and was much frequented in the\r\nmiddle ages.\r\n\r\nThe population of the canton in 1900 was 104,520. Of this number 55,155\r\n(mainly near Coire and Davos, in the Prattigau and in the Schanfigg\r\nvalley) were Protestants, while 49,142 (mainly in the Bundner Oberland,\r\nthe Val Mesocco and the Oberhalbstein) were Romanists, while there were\r\nalso 114 Jews (81 of whom lived in Davos). In point of language 48,762\r\n(mainly near Coire and Davos, in the Prattigau and in the Schanfigg\r\nvalley) were German-speaking, while 17,539 (mostly in the Val Mesocco,\r\nthe Val Bregaglia and the valley of Poschiavo, but including a number of\r\nItalian labourers engaged on the construction of the Albula railway)\r\nwere Italian-speaking. But the characteristic tongue of the Grisons is a\r\nsurvival of an ancient Romance language (the _lingua rustica_ of the\r\nRoman Empire), which has lagged behind its sisters. It has a scanty\r\nprinted literature, but is still widely spoken, so that, of the 38,651\r\npersons in the Swiss Confederation who speak it, no fewer than 36,472\r\nare in the Grisons. It is distinguished into two dialects: the Romonsch\r\n(sometimes wrongly called Romansch), which prevails in the Bundner\r\nOberland and in the Hinter Rhine valley (Schams and Domleschg), and the\r\nLadin (closely related to the tongue spoken in parts of the South\r\nTyrol), that survives in the Engadine and in the neighbouring valleys of\r\nBergun, Oberhalbstein and Munster. (See F. Rausch's _Geschichte der\r\nLiteratur des rhaeto-romanischen Volkes_, Frankfort, 1870, and Mr\r\nCoolidge's bibliography of this language, given on pp. 22-23 of Lorria\r\nand Martel's _Le Massif de la Bernina_, Zurich, 1894.) Yet in the midst\r\nof this Romance-speaking population are islets (mostly, if not entirely,\r\ndue to immigration in the 13th century from the German-speaking Upper\r\nValais) of German-speaking inhabitants, so in the Vals and Safien glens,\r\nand at Obersaxen (all in the Bundner Oberland), in the Rheinwald (the\r\nhighest part of the Hinter Rhine valley), and in the Avers glen (middle\r\nreach of the Hinter Rhine valley), as well as in and around Davos\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThere is not much industrial activity in the Grisons. A considerable\r\nportion of the population is engaged in attending to the wants of the\r\nforeign visitors, but there is a considerable trade with Italy,\r\nparticularly in the wines of the Valtellina, while many young men seek\r\ntheir fortunes abroad (returning home after having accumulated a small\r\nstock of money) as confectioners, pastry-cooks and coffee-house keepers.\r\nA certain number of lead and silver mines were formerly worked, but are\r\nnow abandoned. The capital of the canton is Coire (q.v.).\r\n\r\nThe canton is divided into 14 administrative districts, and includes 224\r\ncommunes. It sends 2 members (elected by a popular vote) to the Federal\r\n_Standerath_, and 5 members (also elected by a popular vote) to the\r\nFederal _Nationalrath_. The existing cantonal constitution was accepted\r\nby the people in 1892, and came into force on 1st January 1894. The\r\nlegislature (_Grossrath_--no numbers fixed by the constitution) is\r\nelected for 2 years by a popular vote, as are the 5 members of the\r\nexecutive (_Kleinrath_) for 3 years. The \"obligatory referendum\" obtains\r\nin the case of all laws and important matters of expenditure, while 3000\r\ncitizens can demand (\"facultative referendum\") a popular vote as to\r\nresolutions and ordinances made by the legislature. Three thousand\r\ncitizens also have the right of \"initiative\" as to legislative projects,\r\nbut 5000 signatures are required for a proposed revision of the cantonal\r\nconstitution. In the revenue and expenditure of the canton the taxes are\r\nnever counted. This causes an apparent deficit which is carried to the\r\ncapital account, and is met by the land tax (art. 19 of the\r\nconstitution), so that there is never a real deficit, as the amount of\r\nthe land tax varies annually according to the amount that _must_ be\r\nprovided. In the pre-1799 constitution of the three Raetian Leagues the\r\nsystem of the \"referendum\" was in working as early as the 16th century,\r\nnot merely as between the three Leagues themselves, but as between the\r\nbailiwicks (_Hochgerichte_), the sovereign units within each League, and\r\nsometimes (as in the Upper Engadine) between the villages composing each\r\nbailiwick.\r\n\r\nThe greater part (excluding the three valleys where the inhabitants\r\nspeak Italian) of the modern canton of the Grisons formed the southern\r\npart of the province of Raetia (probably the aboriginal inhabitants, the\r\nRaeti, were Celts rather than, as was formerly believed, Etruscans), set\r\nup by the Romans after their conquest of the region in 15 B.C. The\r\nRomanized inhabitants were to a certain extent (The Romonsch or Ladin\r\ntongue is a survival of the Roman dominion) Teutonized under the\r\nOstrogoths (A.D. 493-537) and under the Franks (from 537 onwards).\r\nGovernors called _Praesides_ are mentioned in the 7th and 8th centuries,\r\nwhile members of the same family occupied the episcopal see of Coire\r\n(founded 4th-5th centuries). About 806 Charles the Great made this\r\nregion into a county, but in 831 the bishop procured for his dominions\r\nexemption (\"immunity\") from the jurisdiction of the counts, while before\r\n847 his see was transferred from the Italian province of Milan to the\r\nGerman province of Mainz (Mayence) and was thus cut off from Italy to be\r\njoined to Germany. In 916 the region was united with the duchy of\r\nAlamannia, but the bishop still retained practical independence, and his\r\nwide-spread dominions placed him even above the abbots of Disentis and\r\nPfafers, who likewise enjoyed \"immunity.\" In the 10th century the bishop\r\nobtained fresh privileges from the emperors (besides the Val Bregaglia\r\nin 960), and so became the chief of the many feudal nobles who struggled\r\nfor power in the region. He became a prince of the empire in 1170 and\r\nlater allied himself with the rising power (in the region) of the\r\nHabsburgers. This led in 1367 to the foundation of the League of God's\r\nHouse or the _Gotteshausbund_ (composed of the city and chapter of\r\nCoire, and of the bishop's subjects, especially in the Engadine, Val\r\nBregaglia, Domleschg and Oberhalbstein) in order to stem his rising\r\npower, the bishop entering it in 1392. In 1395 the abbot of Disentis,\r\nthe men of the Lugnetz valley, and the great feudal lords of Razuns and\r\nSax (in 1399 the counts of Werdenberg came in) formed another League,\r\ncalled the _Ober Bund_ (as comprising the highlands in the Vorder Rhine\r\nvalley) and also wrongly the \"Grey League\" (as the word interpreted\r\n\"grey\" is simply a misreading of _graven_ or counts, though the false\r\nview has given rise to the name of Grisons or Graubunden for the whole\r\ncanton), their alliance being strengthened in 1424 when, too, the free\r\nmen of the Rheinwald and Schams came in, and in 1480 the Val Mesocco\r\nalso. Finally, in 1436, the third Raetian League was founded, that of\r\nthe _Zehngerichtenbund_ or League of the Ten Jurisdictions, by the\r\nformer subjects of the count of Toggenburg, whose dynasty then became\r\nextinct; they include the inhabitants of the Prattigau, Davos,\r\nMaienfeld, the Schanfigg valley, Churwalden, and the lordship of Belfort\r\n(i.e. the region round Alvaneu), and formed ten bailiwicks, whence the\r\nname of the League. In 1450 the _Zehngerichtenbund_ concluded an\r\nalliance with the _Gotteshausbund_ and in 1471 with the _Ober Bund_; but\r\nof the so-called perpetual alliance at Vazerol, near Tiefenkastels,\r\nthere exists no authentic evidence in the oldest chronicles, though\r\ndiets were held there. By a succession of purchases (1477-1496) nearly\r\nall the possessions of the extinct dynasty of the counts of Toggenburg\r\nin the Prattigau had come to the junior or Tyrolese line of the\r\nHabsburgers. On its extinction (1496) in turn they passed to the elder\r\nline, the head of which, Maximilian, was already emperor-elect and\r\ndesired to maintain the rights of his family there and in the Lower\r\nEngadine. Hence in 1497 the Ober Bund and in 1498 the _Gotteshausbund_\r\nbecame allies of the Swiss Confederation. War broke out in 1499, but was\r\nended by the great Swiss victory (22nd May 1499) at the battle of the\r\nCalven gorge (above Mals) which, added to another Swiss victory at\r\nDornach (near Basel), compelled the emperor to recognize the _practical_\r\nindependence of the Swiss and their allies of the Empire. The religious\r\nReformation brought disunion into the three Leagues, as the _Ober Bund_\r\nclung in the main to the old faith, and for this reason their connexion\r\nwith the Swiss Confederation was much weakened. In 1526, by the Articles\r\nof Ilanz, the last remaining traces of the temporal jurisdiction of the\r\nbishop of Coire was abolished. In 1486 Poschiavo had at last been\r\nsecured from Milan, and Maienfeld with Malans was bought in 1509, while\r\nin 1549 the Val Mesocco (included in the _Ober Bund_ since 1480)\r\npurchased its freedom of its lords, the Trivulzio family of Milan. In\r\n1512 the three Leagues conquered from Milan the rich and fertile\r\nValtellina, with Bormio and Chiavenna, and held these districts as\r\nsubject lands till in 1797 they were annexed to the Cisalpine Republic.\r\nThe struggle for lucrative offices in these lands further sharpened the\r\nlong rivalry between the families of Planta (Engadine) and Salis (Val\r\nBregaglia), while in the 17th century this rivalry was complicated by\r\npolitical enmities, as the Plantas favoured the Spanish side and the\r\nSalis that of France during the long struggle (1620-1639) for the\r\nValtellina (see JENATSCH and VALTELLINA). Troubles arose (1622) also in\r\nthe Prattigau through the attempts of the Habsburgers to force the\r\ninhabitants to give up Protestantism. Finally, after the emperor had\r\n_formally_ recognized, by the treaty of Westphalia (1648), the\r\nindependence of the Swiss Confederation, the rights of the Habsburgers\r\nin the Prattigau and the Lower Engadine were bought up (1649 and 1652).\r\nBut the Austrian _enclaves_ of Tarasp (Lower Engadine) and of Razuns\r\n(near Reichenau) were only annexed to the Grisons in 1809 and 1815\r\nrespectively, in each case France holding the lordship for a short time\r\nafter its cession by Austria. In 1748 (finally in 1762) the three\r\nLeagues secured the upper portion of the valley of Munster. In 1799 the\r\nFrench invaded the canton, which became the scene of a fierce conflict\r\n(1799-1800) between them and the united Russian and Austrian army, in\r\nthe course of which the French burnt (May 1799) the ancient convent of\r\nDisentis with all its literary treasures. In April 1799 the provisional\r\ngovernment agreed to the incorporation of the three Leagues in the\r\nHelvetic Republic, though it was not till June 1801 that the canton of\r\nRaetia became formally part of the Helvetic Republic. In 1803, by\r\nNapoleon's Act of Mediation, it entered, under the name of Canton of the\r\nGrisons or Graubunden, the reconstituted Swiss Confederation, of which\r\nit then first became a full member.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--A.

He travelled\r\nextensively, worked in newspaper offices, was a Baptist clergyman for a\r\ntime, and finally became a journalist in New York City, where he was\r\nsuccessively a member of the staffs of _The Brother Jonathan_, _The New\r\nWorld_ (1839-1840) and _The New Yorker_ (1840). From 1841 to 1843 he\r\nedited _Graham's Magazine_ (Philadelphia), and added to its list of\r\ncontributors many leading American writers. From 1850 to 1852 he edited\r\nthe _International Magazine_ (New York), which in 1852 was merged into\r\n_Harper's Magazine_. He died in New York City on the 27th of August\r\n1857. He is best known as the compiler and editor of various anthologies\r\n(with brief biographies and critiques), such as _Poets and Poetry of\r\nAmerica_ (1842), his most popular and valuable book; _Prose Writers of\r\nAmerica_ (1846); _Female Poets of America_ (1848); and _Sacred Poets of\r\nEngland and America_ (1849). Of his own writings his _Republican Court:\r\nor American Society in the Days of Washington_ (1854) is the only one of\r\npermanent value. He edited the first American edition of Milton's prose\r\nworks (1845), and, as literary executor, edited, with James R. Lowell\r\nand N. P. Willis, the works (1850) of Edgar Allan Poe. Griswold's great\r\ncontemporary reputation as a critic has not stood the test of time; but\r\nhe rendered a valuable service in making Americans better acquainted\r\nwith the poetry and prose of their own countrymen.\r\n\r\n  See _Passages from the Correspondence and Other Papers of Rufus W.\r\n  Griswold_ (Cambridge, Mass., 1898), edited by his son William\r\n  McCrillis Griswold (1853-1899).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIVET, a monkey, _Cercopithecus sabaeus_, of the guenon group, nearly\r\nallied to the green monkey. It is common throughout equatorial Africa.\r\nThe chin, whiskers and a broad band across the forehead, as well as the\r\nunder-parts, are white, and the head and back olive-green. These monkeys\r\nare very commonly seen in menageries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROAT (adapted from the Dutch _groot_, great, thick; cf. Ger.\r\n_Groschen_; the Med. Lat. _grossus_ gives Ital. _grosso_, Fr. _gros_, as\r\nnames for the coin), a name applied as early as the 13th century on the\r\ncontinent of Europe to any large or thick coin. The groat was almost\r\nuniversally a silver coin, but its value varied considerably, as well at\r\ndifferent times as in different countries. The English groat was first\r\ncoined in 1351, of a value somewhat higher than a penny. The continuous\r\ndebasement of both the penny and the groat left the latter finally worth\r\nfour pennies. The issue of the groat was discontinued after 1662, but a\r\ncoin worth fourpence was again struck in 1836. Although frequently\r\nreferred to as a groat, it had no other official designation than a\r\n\"fourpenny piece.\" Its issue was again discontinued in 1856. The groat\r\nwas imitated in Scotland by a coin struck by David II. in 1358. In\r\nIreland it was first struck by Edward IV. in 1460.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROCER, literally one who sells by the gross, a wholesale dealer; the\r\nword is derived through the O. Fr. form, _grossia_, from the Med. Lat.\r\n_grossarius_, defined by du Cange, _Glossarium_, s.v. _Grossares_, as\r\n_solidae mercis propola_. The name, as a general one for dealers by\r\nwholesale, \"engrossers\" as opposed to \"regrators,\" the retail dealers,\r\nis found with the commodity attached; thus in the _Munimenta Gildhallae_\r\n(\"Rolls\" series) ii. 1.304 (quoted in the _New English Dictionary_) is\r\nfound an allusion to _grossours de vin_, cf. _groser of fysshe_,\r\n_Surtees Misc._ (1888) 63, for the customs of Malton (quoted _ib._). The\r\nspecific application of the word to one who deals either by wholesale or\r\nretail in tea, coffee, cocoa, dried fruits, spices, sugar and all kinds\r\nof articles of use or consumption in a household is connected with the\r\nhistory of the Grocers' Company of London, one of the twelve \"great\"\r\nlivery companies. In 1345 the pepperers and the spicers amalgamated and\r\nwere known as the Fraternity of St Anthony. The name \"grocers\" first\r\nappears in 1373 in the records of the company. In 1386 the association\r\nwas granted a right of search over all \"spicers\" in London, and in 1394\r\nthey obtained the right to inspect or \"garble\" spices and other \"subtil\r\nwares.\" Their first charter was obtained in 1428; letters patent in 1447\r\ngranted an extension of the right of search over the whole county, but\r\nremoved the \"liberties\" of the city of London. They sold all kinds of\r\ndrugs, medicines, ointments, plasters, and medicated and other waters.\r\nFor the separation of the apothecaries from the grocers in 1617 see\r\nAPOTHECARY. (See further LIVERY COMPANIES.)\r\n\r\n  See _The Grocery Trade_, by J. Aubrey Rees (1910).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROCYN, WILLIAM (1446?-1519), English scholar, was born at Colerne,\r\nWiltshire, about 1446. Intended by his parents for the church, he was\r\nsent to Winchester College, and in 1465 was elected to a scholarship at\r\nNew College, Oxford. In 1467 he became a fellow, and had among his\r\npupils William Warham, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury. In 1479 he\r\naccepted the rectory of Newton Longville, in Buckinghamshire, but\r\ncontinued to reside at Oxford. As reader in divinity in Magdalen College\r\nin 1481, he held a disputation with John Taylor, professor of divinity,\r\nin presence of King Richard III., and the king acknowledged his skill as\r\na debater by the present of a buck and five marks. In 1485 he became\r\nprebendary of Lincoln cathedral. About 1488 Grocyn left England for\r\nItaly, and before his return in 1491 he had visited Florence, Rome and\r\nPadua, and studied Greek and Latin under Demetrius Chalchondyles and\r\nPolitian. As lecturer in Exeter College he found an opportunity of\r\nindoctrinating his countrymen in the new Greek learning.\r\n\r\nErasmus says in one of his letters that Grocyn taught Greek at Oxford\r\nbefore his visit to Italy. The Warden of New College, Thomas Chaundler,\r\ninvited Cornelius Vitelli, then on a visit to Oxford, to act as\r\npraelector. This was about 1475, and as Vitelli was certainly familiar\r\nwith Greek literature, Grocyn may have learnt Greek from him. He seems\r\nto have lived in Oxford until 1499, but when his friend Colet became\r\ndean of St Paul's in 1504 he was settled in London. He was chosen by his\r\nfriend to deliver lectures in St Paul's; and in this connexion he gave a\r\nsingular proof of his honesty. He had at first denounced all who\r\nimpugned the authenticity of the _Hierarchia ecclesiastica_ ascribed to\r\nDionysius the Areopagite, but, being led to modify his views by further\r\ninvestigation, he openly declared that he had been completely mistaken.\r\nHe also counted Linacre, William Lily, William Latimer and More among\r\nhis friends, and Erasmus writing in 1514 says that he was supported by\r\nGrocyn in London, and calls him \"the friend and preceptor of us all.\" He\r\nheld several preferments, but his generosity to his friends involved him\r\nin continual difficulties, and though in 1506 he was appointed on\r\nArchbishop Warham's recommendation master or warden of All Hallows\r\nCollege at Maidstone in Kent, he was still obliged to borrow from his\r\nfriends, and even to pledge his plate as a security. He died in 1519,\r\nand was buried in the collegiate church at Maidstone. Linacre acted as\r\nhis executor, and expended the money he received in gifts to the poor\r\nand the purchase of books for poor scholars. With the exception of a few\r\nlines of Latin verse on a lady who snowballed him, and a letter to Aldus\r\nManutius at the head of Linacre's translation of Proclus's _Sphaera_\r\n(Venice, 1499), Grocyn has left no literary proof of his scholarship or\r\nabilities. His proposal to execute a translation of Aristotle in company\r\nwith Linacre and Latimer was never carried out. Wood assigns some Latin\r\nworks to Grocyn, but on insufficient authority. By Erasmus he has been\r\ndescribed as \"vir severissimae castissimae vitae, ecclesiasticarum\r\nconstitutionum observantissimus pene usque ad superstitionem,\r\nscholasticae theologiae ad unguem doctus ac natura etiam acerrimi\r\njudicii, demum in omni disciplinarum genere exacte versatus\"\r\n(_Declarationes ad censuras facultatis theologiae Parisianae_, 1522).\r\n\r\n  An account of Grocyn by Professor Burrows appeared in the Oxford\r\n  Historical Society's _Collectanea_ (1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRODNO, one of the Lithuanian governments of western Russia, lying\r\nbetween 51 deg. 40' and 52 deg. N. and between 22 deg. 12' and 26 deg.\r\nE., and bounded N. by the government of Vilna, E. by Minsk, S. by\r\nVolhynia, and W. by the Polish governments of Lomza and Siedlce. Area,\r\n14,926 sq. m. Except for some hills (not exceeding 925 ft.) in the N.,\r\nit is a uniform plain, and is drained chiefly by the Bug, Niemen, Narev\r\nand Bobr, all navigable. There are also several canals, the most\r\nimportant being the Augustowo and Oginsky. Granites and gneisses crop\r\nout along the Bug, Cretaceous, and especially Tertiary, deposits\r\nelsewhere. The soil is mostly sandy, and in the district of Grodno and\r\nalong the rivers is often drift-sand. Forests, principally of\r\n_Coniferae_, cover more than one-fourth of the area. Amongst them are\r\nsome of vast extent, e.g. those of Grodno (410 sq. m.) and Byelovitsa\r\n(Bialowice) (376 sq. m.), embracing wide areas of marshy ground. In the\r\nlast mentioned forest the wild ox survives, having been jealously\r\npreserved since 1803. Peat bogs, sometimes as much as 4 to 7 ft. thick,\r\ncover extensive districts. The climate is wet and cold; the annual mean\r\ntemperature being 44.5 deg. F., the January mean 22.5 deg. and the July\r\nmean 64.5 deg. The rainfall amounts to 21-1/2 in.; hail is frequent.\r\nAgriculture is the predominant industry. The peasants own 42-1/2% of the\r\nland, that is, about 4,000,000 acres, and of these over 2-1/4 million\r\nacres are arable. The crops principally grown are potatoes, rye, oats,\r\nwheat, flax, hemp and some tobacco. Horses, cattle and sheep are bred in\r\nfairly large numbers. There is, however, a certain amount of\r\nmanufacturing industry, especially in woollens, distilling and tobacco.\r\nIn woollens this government ranks second (after Moscow) in the empire,\r\nthe centre of the industry being Byelostok. Other factories produce\r\nsilk, shoddy and leather. The government is crossed by the main lines of\r\nrailway from Warsaw to St Petersburg and from Warsaw to Moscow. The\r\npopulation numbered 1,008,521 in 1870 and 1,616,630 in 1897; of these\r\nlast 789,801 were women and 255,946 were urban. In 1906 it was estimated\r\nat 1,826,600. White Russians predominate (54%), then follow Jews\r\n(17.4%), Poles (10%), Lithuanians and Germans. The government is divided\r\ninto nine districts, the chief towns, with their populations in 1897,\r\nbeing Grodno (q.v.), Brest-Litovsk (pop. 42,812 in 1901), Byelsk (7461),\r\nByelostok or Bialystok (65,781 in 1901), Kobrin (10,365), Pruzhany\r\n(7634), Slonim (15,893), Sokolsk (7595) and Volkovysk (10,584). In 1795\r\nGrodno, which had been Polish for ages, was annexed by Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRODNO, a town of Russia, capital of the government of the same name in\r\n53 deg. 40' N. and 23 deg. 50' E., on the right bank of the Niemen, 160\r\nm. by rail N.E. of Warsaw and 98 m. S.W. of Vilna on the main line to St\r\nPetersburg. Pop. (1901) 41,736, nearly two-thirds Jews. It is an\r\nepiscopal see of the Orthodox Greek church and the headquarters of the\r\nII. Army Corps. It has two old castles, now converted to other uses, and\r\ntwo churches (16th and 17th centuries). Tobacco factories and\r\ndistilleries are important; machinery, soap, candles, vehicles and\r\nfirearms are also made. Built in the 12th century, Grodno was almost\r\nentirely destroyed by the Mongols (1241) and Teutonic knights (1284 and\r\n1391). Stephen Bathory, king of Poland, made it his capital, and died\r\nthere in 1586. The Polish Estates frequently met at Grodno after 1673,\r\nand there in 1793 they signed the second partition of Poland. It was at\r\nGrodno that Stanislaus Poniatowski resigned the Polish crown in 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROEN VAN PRINSTERER, GUILLAUME (1801-1876), Dutch politician and\r\nhistorian, was born at Voorburg, near the Hague, on the 21st of August\r\n1801. He studied at Leiden university, and graduated in 1823 both as\r\ndoctor of literature and LL.D. From 1829 to 1833 he acted as secretary\r\nto King William I. of Holland, afterwards took a prominent part in Dutch\r\nhome politics, and gradually became the leader of the so-called\r\nanti-revolutionary party, both in the Second Chamber, of which he was\r\nfor many years a member, and outside. In Groen the doctrines of Guizot\r\nand Stahl found an eloquent exponent. They permeate his controversial\r\nand political writings and historical studies, of which his _Handbook of\r\nDutch History_ (in Dutch) and _Maurice et Barnevelt_ (in French, 1875, a\r\ncriticism of Motley's _Life of Van Olden-Barnevelt_) are the principal.\r\nGroen was violently opposed to Thorbecke, whose principles he denounced\r\nas ungodly and revolutionary. Although he lived to see these principles\r\ntriumph, he never ceased to oppose them until his death, which occurred\r\nat the Hague on the 19th of May 1876. He is best known as the editor of\r\nthe _Archives et correspondance de la maison d'Orange_ (12 vols.,\r\n1835-1845), a great work of patient erudition, which procured for him\r\nthe title of the \"Dutch _Gachard_.\" J. L. Motley acknowledges his\r\nindebtedness to Groen's Archives in the preface to his _Rise of the\r\nDutch Republic_, at a time when the American historian had not yet made\r\nthe acquaintance of King William's archivist, and also bore emphatic\r\ntestimony to Groen's worth as a writer of history in the correspondence\r\npublished after his death. At the first reception, in 1858, of Motley at\r\nthe royal palace at the Hague, the king presented him with a copy of\r\nGroen's _Archives_ as a token of appreciation and admiration of the work\r\ndone by the \"worthy vindicator of William I., prince of Orange.\" This\r\ncopy, bearing the king's autograph inscription, afterwards came into the\r\npossession of Sir William Vernon Harcourt, Motley's son-in-law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROIN. (1) An obsolete word for the grunting of swine, from Lat.\r\n_grunnire_, and so applied to the snout of a pig; it is probably the\r\norigin of the word, more commonly spelled \"groyne,\" for a small timber\r\nframework or wall of masonry used on sea coasts as a breakwater to\r\nprevent the encroachment of sand and shingle. (2) (Of uncertain origin;\r\nfrom an older form _grynde_ or _grinde_; the derivation from \"grain,\" an\r\nobsolete word meaning \"fork,\" cannot, according to the _New English\r\nDictionary_, be accepted), in anatomy the folds or grooves formed\r\nbetween the lower part of the abdomen and the thighs, covering the\r\ninguinal glands, and so applied in architecture to the angle or \"arris\"\r\nformed by the intersection of two vaults crossing one another,\r\noccasionally called by workmen \"groin point.\" If the vaults are both of\r\nthe same radius and height, their intersections lie in a vertical plane,\r\nin other cases they form winding curves for which it is difficult to\r\nprovide centering. In early medieval vaulting this was sometimes\r\narranged by a slight alteration in the geometrical curve of the vault,\r\nbut the problem was not satisfactorily solved until the introduction of\r\nthe rib which henceforth ruled the vaulting surface of the web or cell\r\n(see VAULT). The name \"Welsh groin\" or \"underpitch\" is generally given\r\nto the vaulting surface or web where the main longitudinal vault is\r\nhigher than the cross or transverse vaults; as the transverse rib (of\r\nmuch greater radius than that of the wall rib), projected diagonally in\r\nfront of the latter, the filling-in or web has to be carried back from\r\nthe transverse to the wall rib. The term \"groin centering\" is used\r\nwhere, in groining without ribs, the whole surface is supported by\r\ncentering during the erection of the vaulting. In ribbed work the stone\r\nribs only are supported by timber ribs during the progress of the work,\r\nany light stuff being used while filling in the spandrils. (See VAULT.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROLMANN, KARL WILHELM GEORG VON (1777-1843), Prussian soldier, was born\r\nin Berlin on the 30th of July 1777. He entered an infantry regiment when\r\nscarcely thirteen, became an ensign in 1795, second lieutenant 1797,\r\nfirst lieutenant 1804 and staff-captain in 1805. As a subaltern he had\r\nbecome one of Scharnhorst's intimates, and he was distinguished for his\r\nenergetic and fearless character before the war of 1806, in which he\r\nserved throughout, from Jena to the peace of Tilsit, as a staff officer,\r\nand won the rank of major for distinguished service in action. After the\r\npeace, and the downfall of Prussia, he was one of the most active of\r\nScharnhorst's assistants in the work of reorganization (1809), joined the\r\n_Tugendbund_ and endeavoured to take part in Schill's abortive\r\nexpedition, after which he entered the Austrian service as a major on the\r\ngeneral staff. Thereafter he journeyed to Cadiz to assist the Spaniards\r\nagainst Napoleon, and he led a corps of volunteers in the defence of that\r\nport against Marshal Victor in 1810. He was present at the battle of\r\nAlbuera, at Saguntum, and at Valencia, becoming a prisoner of war at the\r\nsurrender of the last-named place. Soon, however, he escaped to\r\nSwitzerland, whence early in 1813 he returned to Prussia as a major on\r\nthe general staff. He served successively under Colonel von Dolffs and\r\nGeneral von Kleist, and as commissioner at the headquarters of the\r\nRussian general Barclay de Tolly. He took part with Kleist in the victory\r\nof Kulm, and recovered from a severe wound received at that action in\r\ntime to be present at the battle of Leipzig. He played a conspicuous part\r\nin the campaign of 1814 in France, after which he was made a\r\nmajor-general. In this rank he was appointed quartermaster-general to\r\nField Marshal Prince Blucher, and, after his chief and Gneisenau,\r\nGrolmann had the greatest share in directing the Prussian operations of\r\n1815. In the decision, on the 18th of June 1815, to press forward to\r\nWellington's assistance (see WATERLOO CAMPAIGN), Grolmann actively\r\nconcurred, and as the troops approached the battle-field, he is said to\r\nhave overcome the momentary hesitation of the commander-in-chief and the\r\nchief of staff by himself giving the order to advance. After the peace of\r\n1815, Grolmann occupied important positions in the ministry of war and\r\nthe general staff. His last public services were rendered in Poland as\r\ncommander-in-chief, and practically as civil administrator of the\r\nprovince of Posen. He was promoted general of infantry in 1837 and died\r\non the 1st of June 1843, at Posen. His two sons became generals in the\r\nPrussian army. The Prussian 18th infantry regiment bears his name.\r\n\r\nGeneral von Grolmann supervised and provided much of the material for\r\nvon Damitz's _Gesch. des Feldzugs 1815_ (Berlin, 1837-1838), and _Gesch.\r\ndes Feldzugs 1814 in Frankreich_ (Berlin, 1842-1843).\r\n\r\n  See v. Conrady, _Leben und Wirken des Generals Karl von Grolmann_\r\n  (Berlin, 1894-1896).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROMATICI (from _groma_ or _gruma_, a surveyor's pole), or\r\n_Agrimensores_, the name for land-surveyors amongst the Romans. The art\r\nof surveying was probably at first in the hands of the augurs, by whom\r\nit was exercised in all cases where the demarcation of a _templum_ (any\r\nconsecrated space) was necessary. Thus, the boundaries of Rome itself,\r\nof colonies and camps, were all marked out in accordance with the rules\r\nof augural procedure. The first professional surveyor mentioned is L.\r\nDecidius Saxa, who was employed by Antony in the measurement of camps\r\n(Cicero, _Philippics_, xi. 12, xiv. 10). During the empire their number\r\nand reputation increased. The distribution of land amongst the veterans,\r\nthe increase in the number of military colonies, the settlement of\r\nItalian peasants in the provinces, the general survey of the empire\r\nunder Augustus, the separation of private and state domains, led to the\r\nestablishment of a recognized professional corporation of surveyors.\r\nDuring later times they were in receipt of large salaries, and in some\r\ncases were even honoured with the title _clarissimus_. Their duties were\r\nnot merely geometrical or mathematical, but required legal knowledge for\r\nconsultations or the settlement of disputes. This led to the institution\r\nof special schools for the training of surveyors and a special\r\nliterature, which lasted from the 1st to the 6th century A.D. The\r\nearliest of the gromatic writers was Frontinus (q.v.), whose _De agrorum\r\nqualitate_, dealing with the legal aspect of the art, was the subject of\r\na commentary by Aggenus Urbicus, a Christian schoolmaster. Under Trajan\r\na certain Balbus, who had accompanied the emperor on his Dacian\r\ncampaign, wrote a still extant manual of geometry for land surveyors\r\n(_Expositio et ratio omnium formarum_ or _mensurarum_, probably after a\r\nGreek original by Hero), dedicated to a certain Celsus who had invented\r\nan improvement in a gromatic instrument (perhaps the dioptra, resembling\r\nthe modern theodolite); for the treatises of Hyginus see that name.\r\nSomewhat later than Trajan was Siculus Flaccus (_De condicionibus\r\nagrorum_, extant), while the most curious treatise on the subject,\r\nwritten in barbarous Latin and entitled _Casae litterarum_ (long a\r\nschool text-book) is the work of a certain Innocentius (4th-5th\r\ncentury). It is doubtful whether Boetius is the author of the treatises\r\nattributed to him. The _Gromatici veteres_ also contains extracts from\r\nofficial registers (probably belonging to the 5th century) of colonial\r\nand other land surveys, lists and descriptions of boundary stones, and\r\nextracts from the Theodosian Codex. According to Mommsen, the collection\r\nhad its origin during the 5th century in the office of a vicarius\r\n(diocesan governor) of Rome, who had a number of surveyors under him.\r\nThe surveyors were known by various names: _decempedator_ (with\r\nreference to the instrument used); _finitor_, _metator_ or _mensor\r\ncastrorum_ in republican times; _togati Augustorum_ as imperial civil\r\nofficials; _professor_, _auctor_ as professional instructors.\r\n\r\n  The best edition of the Gromatici is by C. Lachmann and others (1848)\r\n  with supplementary volume, _Die Schriften der romischen Feldmesser_\r\n  (1852); see also B. G. Niebuhr, _Roman History_, ii., appendix (Eng.\r\n  trans.), who first revived interest in the subject; M. Cantor, _Die\r\n  romischen Agrimensoren_ (Leipzig, 1875); P. de Tissot, _La Condition\r\n  des Agrimensores dans l'ancienne Rome_ (1879); G. Rossi, _Groma e\r\n  squadro_ (Turin, 1877); articles by F. Hultsch in Ersch and Gruber's\r\n  _Allgem. Encyklopadie_, and by G.

It includes the islands of Boschplaat and\r\nRottumeroog, belonging to the group of Frisian islands (q.v.). Area, 887\r\nsq. m.; pop. (1900) 299,602. Groningen is connected with the Drente\r\nplateau by the sandy tongue of the Hondsrug which extends almost up to\r\nthe capital. West, north and north-east of this the province is flat and\r\nconsists of sea-clay or sand and clay mixed, except where patches of low\r\nand high fen occur on the Frisian borders. Low fen predominates to the\r\neast of the capital, between the Zuidlardermeer and the Schildmeer or\r\nlakes. The south-eastern portion of the province consists of high fen\r\nresting on diluvial sand. A large part of this has been reclaimed and\r\nthe sandy soil laid bare, but on the Drente and Prussian borders areas\r\nof fen still remain. The so-called Boertanger Morass on the Prussian\r\nborder was long considered as the natural protection of the eastern\r\nfrontier, and with the view of preserving its impassable condition\r\nneither agriculture nor cattle-rearing might be practised here until\r\n1824, and it was only in 1868 that the building of houses was sanctioned\r\nand the work of reclamation begun. The gradual extension of the seaward\r\nboundaries of the province owing to the process of littoral deposits may\r\nbe easily traced, a triple line of sea-dikes in places marking the\r\nsuccessive stages in this advance. The rivers of Groningen descending\r\nfrom the Drente plateau meet at the capital, whence they are continued\r\nby the Reitdiep to the Lauwers Zee (being discharged through a lock),\r\nand by the Ems canal (1876) to Delfzyl. The south-eastern corner of the\r\nprovince is traversed by the Westerwolde Aa, which discharges into the\r\nDollart. The railway system belongs to the northern section of the State\r\nrailways, and affords communication with Germany via Winschoten.\r\nSteam-tramways also serve many parts of the province. Agriculture is the\r\nmain industry. The proportion of landowners is a very large one, and the\r\nprosperous condition of the Groningen farmer is attested by the style of\r\nhis home, his dress and his gig. As a result, however, partly of the\r\nusual want of work on the grasslands in certain seasons, there has been\r\na considerable emigration to America. The ancient custom called the\r\n_beklem-recht_, or lease-right, doubtless accounts for the extended\r\nownership of the land. By this law a tenant-farmer is able to bequeath\r\nhis farm, that is to say, he holds his lease in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nThe chief agricultural products are barley, oats, wheat, and in the\r\nnorth-east flax is also grown, and exported to South Holland and\r\nBelgium. On the higher clay grounds cattle-rearing and horse-breeding\r\nare also practised, together with butter and cheese making. The\r\ncultivation of potatoes on the sandgrounds in the south and the fen\r\ncolonies along the Stads-Canal invite general comparison with the\r\nindustries of Drente (q.v.). Hoogezand and Sappemeer, Veendam and\r\nWildervank, New and Old Pekela, New and Old Stads-Canal are instances of\r\nvillages which have extended until they overlap one another and are\r\nsimilar in this respect to the industrial villages of the Zaan Streek in\r\nNorth Holland. The coast fisheries are considerable. Groningen (q.v.) is\r\nthe chief and only large town of the province. Delfzyl, which was\r\nformerly an important fortress for the protection of the ancient sluices\r\non the little river Delf (hence its name), has greatly benefited by the\r\nconstruction of the Ems (Eems) ship-canal connecting it with Groningen,\r\nand has a good harbour with a considerable import trade in wood.\r\nAppingedam and Winschoten are very old towns, having important cattle\r\nand horse markets. The pretty wood at Winschoten was laid out by the\r\nSociety for Public Welfare (_Tot Nut van het Algemeen_) in 1826.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRONINGEN, a town of Holland, capital of the province of the same name,\r\nat the confluence of the two canalized rivers the Drentsche Aa and the\r\nHunse (which are continued to the Lauwers Zee as the Reit Diep), 16 m.\r\nN. of Assen and 33 m. E. of Leeuwarden by rail. Pop. (1900) 67,563.\r\nGroningen is the centre from which several important canals radiate.\r\nBesides the Reit Diep, there are the Ems Canal and the Damster Diep,\r\nconnecting it with Delfzyl and the Dollart, the Kolonel's Diep with\r\nLeeuwarden, the Nord Willem's Canal with Assen and the south and the\r\nStads-Canal south-east with the Ems. Hence steamers ply in all\r\ndirections, and there is a regular service to Emden and the island of\r\nBorkum via Delfzyl, and via the Lauwers Zee to the island of\r\nSchiermonnikoog. Groningen is the most important town in the north of\r\nHolland, with its fine shops and houses and wide clean streets, while\r\nbrick houses of the 16th and 17th centuries help it to retain a certain\r\nold-world air. The ancient part of the town is still surrounded by the\r\nformer moat, and in the centre lies a group of open places, of which the\r\nGroote Markt is one of the largest market-squares in Holland. Pleasant\r\ngardens and promenades extend on the north side of the town, together\r\nwith a botanical garden. The chief church is the Martini-kerk, with a\r\nhigh tower (432 ft.) dating from 1477, and an organ constructed by the\r\nfamous scholar and musician Rudolph Agricolo, who was born near\r\nGroningen in 1443. The Aa church dates from 1465, but was founded in\r\n1253. The Roman Catholic Broederkerk (rebuilt at the end of the 19th\r\ncentury) contains some remarkable pictures of the Passion by L. Hendricx\r\n(1865). There is also a Jewish synagogue. The large town hall (in\r\nclassical style), one of the finest public buildings, was built at the\r\nbeginning of the 19th century and enlarged in 1873. The provincial\r\ngovernment offices also occupy a fine building which received a splendid\r\nfront in 1871. Other noteworthy buildings are the provincial museum of\r\nantiquities, containing interesting Germanic antiquities, as well as\r\nmedieval and modern collections of porcelain, pictures, &c.; the courts\r\nof justice (transformed in the middle of the 18th century); the old\r\nOmmelanderhuis, formerly devoted to the administration of the\r\nsurrounding district, built in 1509 and restored in 1899; the\r\nweigh-house (1874); the civil and military prison; the arsenal; the\r\nmilitary hospital; and the concert hall.\r\n\r\nThe university of Groningen, founded in 1614, received its present fine\r\nbuildings in classical style in 1850. Among its auxiliary establishments\r\nare a good natural history museum, an observatory, a laboratory, and a\r\nlibrary which contains a copy of Erasmus' New Testament with marginal\r\nannotations by Luther. Other educational institutions are the deaf and\r\ndumb institution founded by Henri Daniel Guyot (d. 1828) in 1790, a\r\ngymnasium, and schools of navigation, art and music. There are learned\r\nsocieties for the study of law (1761) and natural science (1830); an\r\nacademy of fine arts (1830); an archaeological society; and a central\r\nbureau for collecting information concerning the province.\r\n\r\nAs capital of the province, and on account of the advantages of its\r\nnatural position, Groningen maintains a very considerable trade, chiefly\r\nin oil-seed, grain, wood, turf and cattle, with Great Britain, Germany,\r\nScandinavia and Russia. The chief industries are flax-spinning,\r\nrope-making, sugar refining, book printing, wool combing and dyeing, and\r\nit also manufactures beer, tobacco and cigars, cotton and woollen\r\nstuffs, furniture, organs and pianos; besides which there are saw, oil\r\nand grain mills, machine works, and numerous goldsmiths and\r\nsilversmiths.\r\n\r\n_History._--The town of Groningen belonged originally to the _pagus_, or\r\n_gouw_, of Triantha (Drente), the countship of which was bestowed by the\r\nemperor Henry II. on the bishop and chapter of Utrecht in 1024. In 1040\r\nHenry III. gave the church of Utrecht the royal domain of Groningen, and\r\nin the deed of gift the \"villa Cruoninga\" is mentioned. Upon this\r\ncharter the bishops of Utrecht based their claim to the overlordship of\r\nthe town, a claim which the citizens hotly disputed. At the time of the\r\ndonation, indeed, the town can hardly be said to have existed, but the\r\nroyal \"villa\" rapidly developed into a community which strove to assert\r\nthe rights of a free imperial city. At first the bishops were too strong\r\nfor the townsmen; the defences built in 1110 were pulled down by the\r\nbishop's order two years later; and during the 12th and 13th centuries\r\nthe see of Utrecht, in spite of frequent revolts, succeeded in\r\nmaintaining its authority. Down to the 15th century an episcopal\r\nprefect, or burgrave, had his seat in the city, his authority extending\r\nover the neighbouring districts known as the Gorecht. In 1143 Heribert\r\nof Bierum, bishop of Utrecht, converted the office into an hereditary\r\nfief in favour of his brother Liffert, on the extinction of whose male\r\nline it was partitioned between the families of Koevorden (or Coevorden)\r\nand van den Hove. Gradually, however, the burghers, aided by the\r\nneighbouring Frisians, succeeded in freeing themselves from the\r\nepiscopal yoke. The city was again walled in 1255; before 1284 it had\r\nbecome a member of the Hanseatic league; and by the end of the 14th\r\ncentury it was practically a powerful independent republic, which\r\nexercised an effective control over the Frisian Ommelande between the\r\nEms and the Lauwers Zee. At the close of the 14th century the heirs of\r\nthe Koevorden and van den Hove families sold their rights, first to the\r\ntown, and then to the bishop. A struggle followed, in which the city was\r\ntemporarily worsted; but in 1440 Bishop Dirk II. finally sold to the\r\ncity the rights of the see of Utrecht over the Gorecht.\r\n\r\nThe medieval constitution of Groningen, unlike that of Utrecht, was\r\naristocratic. Merchant gild there was none; and the craft gilds were\r\nwithout direct influence on the city government, which held them in\r\nsubjection. Membership of the governing council, which selected from its\r\nown body the four _rationales_ or burgomasters, was confined to men of\r\napproved \"wisdom,\" and wisdom was measured in terms of money. This\r\n_Raad_ of wealthy burghers gradually monopolized all power. The bishop's\r\nbailiff (_schout_), with his nominated assessors (_scabini_), continued\r\nto exercise jurisdiction, but members of the Raad sat on the bench with\r\nhim, and an appeal lay from his court to the Raad itself. The council\r\nwas, in fact, supreme in the city, and not in the city only. In 1439 it\r\ndecreed that no one might trade in all the district between the Ems and\r\nthe Lauwers Zee except burghers, and those who had purchased the\r\n_burwal_ (right of residence in the city) and the freedom of the gilds.\r\nMaximilian I. assigned Groningen to Albert of Saxony, hereditary\r\npodestat of Friesland, but the citizens preferred to accept the\r\nprotection of the bishop of Utrecht; and when Albert's son George\r\nattempted in 1505 to seize the town, they recognized the lordship of\r\nEdzart of East Frisia. On George's renewal of hostilities they\r\ntransferred their allegiance to Duke Charles of Gelderland, in 1515. In\r\n1536 the city passed into the hands of Charles V., and in the great\r\nwars of the 16th century suffered all the miseries of siege and military\r\noccupation. From 1581 onwards, Groningen still held by the Spaniards,\r\nwas constantly at war with the \"Ommelanden\" which had declared against\r\nthe king of Spain. This feud continued, in spite of the capture of the\r\ncity in 1594 by Maurice of Nassau, and of a decree of the States in 1597\r\nwhich was intended to set them at rest. In 1672 the town was besieged by\r\nthe bishop of Munster, but it was successfully defended, and in 1698 its\r\nfortifications were improved under Coehoorn's direction. The French\r\nRepublicans planted their tree of liberty in the Great Market on the\r\n14th of February 1795, and they continued in authority till the 16th of\r\nNovember 1814. The fortifications of the city were doomed to destruction\r\nby the law of the 18th of April 1874.\r\n\r\n  See C. Hegel, _Stadte und Gilden_ (Leipzig, 1891); Stokvis, _Manuel\r\n  d'histoire_, iii. 496 (Leiden, 1890-1893); also s.v. in Chevalier,\r\n  _Repertoire des sources hist. du moyen age_ (_Topo-bibliographie_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRONLUND, LAURENCE (1846-1899), American socialist, was born in\r\nCopenhagen, Denmark, on the 13th of July 1846. He graduated from the\r\nuniversity of Copenhagen in 1865, began the study of law, removed to the\r\nUnited States in 1867, taught German in Milwaukee, was admitted to the\r\nbar in 1869, and practised in Chicago. He became a writer and lecturer\r\non socialism and was closely connected with the work of the Socialist\r\nLabor party from 1874 to 1884, then devoted himself almost exclusively\r\nto lecturing until his appointment to a post in the bureau of labour\r\nstatistics. He again returned to the lecture field, and was an editorial\r\nwriter for the New York and Chicago _American_ from 1898 until his death\r\nin New York City on the 15th of October 1899. His principal works are:\r\n_The Coming Revolution_ (1880); _The Co-operative Commonwealth in its\r\nOutlines, An Exposition of Modern Socialism_ (1884); _Ca Ira, or Danton\r\nin the French Revolution_ (1888), a rehabilitation of Danton; _Our\r\nDestiny, The Influence of Socialism on Morals and Religion_ (1890); and\r\n_The New Economy_ (1898).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRONOVIUS (the latinized form of GRONOV), JOHANN FRIEDRICH (1611-1671),\r\nGerman classical scholar and critic, was born at Hamburg on the 8th of\r\nSeptember 1611. Having studied at several universities, he travelled in\r\nEngland, France and Italy. In 1643 he was appointed professor of\r\nrhetoric and history at Deventer, and in 1658 to the Greek chair at\r\nLeiden, where he died on the 28th of December 1671. (See also FABRETTI,\r\nRAPHAEL.) Besides editing, with notes, Statius, Plautus, Livy, Tacitus,\r\nAulus Gellius and Seneca's tragedies, Gronovius was the author, amongst\r\nnumerous other works, of _Commentarius de sestertiis_ (1643) and of an\r\nedition of Hugo Grotius' De jure belli et pacis (1660). His\r\n_Observationes_ contain a number of brilliant emendations. His son,\r\nJAKOB GRONOVIUS (1645-1716), is chiefly known as the editor of the\r\n_Thesaurus antiquitatum Graecarum_ (1697-1702, in 13 volumes).\r\n\r\n  See J. E. Sandys, _Hist. of Class. Schol._ ii. (1908); F. A. Eckstein\r\n  in Ersch and Gruber's _Allgemeine Encyklopadie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROOM, in modern usage a male servant attached to the stables, whose\r\nduties are to attend to the cleaning, feeding, currying and care\r\ngenerally of horses. The earliest meaning of the word appears to be that\r\nof a boy, and in 16th and 17th century literature it frequently occurs,\r\nin pastorals, for a shepherd lover. Later it is used for any male\r\nattendant, and thus survives in the name for several officials in the\r\nroyal household, such as the grooms-in-waiting, and the grooms of the\r\ngreat chamber. The groom-porter, whose office was abolished by George\r\nIII., saw to the preparation of the sovereign's apartment, and, during\r\nthe 16th and 17th centuries, provided cards and dice for playing, and\r\nwas the authority to whom were submitted all questions of gaming within\r\nthe court. The origin of the word is obscure. The O. Fr. _gromet_, shop\r\nboy, is taken by French etymologists to be derived from the English.\r\nFrom the application of this word to a wine-taster in a wine merchant's\r\nshop, is derived _gourmet_, an epicure. According to the _New English\r\nDictionary_, though there are no instances of groom in other Teutonic\r\nlanguages, the word may be ultimately connected with the root of \"to\r\ngrow.\" In \"bridegroom,\" a newly married man, \"grom\" in the 16th century\r\ntook the place of an older _gome_, a common old Teutonic word meaning\r\n\"man,\" and connected with the Latin _homo_. The Old English word was\r\n_brydguma_, later _bridegome_. The word survives in the German\r\n_Brautigam_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROOT, GERHARD (1340-1384), otherwise Gerrit or Geert Groet, in Latin\r\nGerardus Magnus, a preacher and founder of the society of Brothers of\r\nCommon Life (q.v.), was born in 1340 at Deventer in the diocese of\r\nUtrecht, where his father held a good civic position. He went to the\r\nuniversity of Paris when only fifteen. Here he studied scholastic\r\nphilosophy and theology under a pupil of Occam's, from whom he imbibed\r\nthe nominalist conception of philosophy; in addition he studied canon\r\nlaw, medicine, astronomy and even magic, and apparently some Hebrew.\r\nAfter a brilliant course he graduated in 1358, and possibly became\r\nmaster in 1363. He pursued his studies still further in Cologne, and\r\nperhaps in Prague. In 1366 he visited the papal court at Avignon. About\r\nthis time he was appointed to a canonry in Utrecht and to another in\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, and the life of the brilliant young scholar was rapidly\r\nbecoming luxurious, secular and selfish, when a great spiritual change\r\npassed over him which resulted in a final renunciation of every worldly\r\nenjoyment. This conversion, which took place In 1374, appears to have\r\nbeen due partly to the effects of a dangerous illness and partly to the\r\ninfluence of Henry de Calcar, the learned and pious prior of the\r\nCarthusian monastery at Munnikhuizen near Arnhem, who had remonstrated\r\nwith him on the vanity of his life. About 1376 Gerhard retired to this\r\nmonastery and there spent three years in meditation, prayer and study,\r\nwithout, however, becoming a Carthusian. In 1379, having received\r\nordination as a deacon, he became missionary preacher throughout the\r\ndiocese of Utrecht. The success which followed his labours not only in\r\nthe town of Utrecht, but also in Zwolle, Deventer, Kampen, Amsterdam,\r\nHaarlem, Gouda, Leiden, Delft, Zutphen and elsewhere, was immense;\r\naccording to Thomas a Kempis the people left their business and their\r\nmeals to hear his sermons, so that the churches could not hold the\r\ncrowds that flocked together wherever he came. The bishop of Utrecht\r\nsupported him warmly, and got him to preach against concubinage in the\r\npresence of the clergy assembled in synod. The impartiality of his\r\ncensures, which he directed not only against the prevailing sins of the\r\nlaity, but also against heresy, simony, avarice, and impurity among the\r\nsecular and regular clergy, provoked the hostility of the clergy, and\r\naccusations of heterodoxy were brought against him. It was in vain that\r\nGroot emitted a _Publica Protestatio_, in which he declared that Jesus\r\nChrist was the great subject of his discourses, that in all of them he\r\nbelieved himself to be in harmony with Catholic doctrine, and that he\r\nwillingly subjected them to the candid judgment of the Roman Church. The\r\nbishop was induced to issue an edict which prohibited from preaching all\r\nwho were not in priest's orders, and an appeal to Urban VI. was without\r\neffect. There is a difficulty as to the date of this prohibition; either\r\nit was only a few months before Groot's death, or else it must have been\r\nremoved by the bishop, for Groot seems to have preached in public in the\r\nlast year of his life. At some period (perhaps 1381, perhaps earlier) he\r\npaid a visit of some days' duration to the famous mystic Johann\r\nRuysbroeck, prior of the Augustinian canons at Groenendael near\r\nBrussels; at this visit was formed Groot's attraction for the rule and\r\nlife of the Augustinian canons which was destined to bear such notable\r\nfruit. At the close of his life he was asked by some of the clerics who\r\nattached themselves to him to form them into a religious order, and\r\nGroot resolved that they should be canons regular of St Augustine. No\r\ntime was lost in the effort to carry out the project, but Groot died\r\nbefore a foundation could be made. In 1387, however, a site was secured\r\nat Windesheim, some 20 m. north of Deventer, and here was established\r\nthe monastery that became the cradle of the Windesheim congregation of\r\ncanons regular, embracing in course of time nearly one hundred houses,\r\nand leading the way in the series of reforms undertaken during the 15th\r\ncentury by all the religious orders in Germany. The initiation of this\r\nmovement was the great achievement of Groot's life; he lived to preside\r\nover the birth and first days of his other creation, the society of\r\nBrothers of Common Life. He died of the plague at Deventer in 1384, at\r\nthe age of 44.\r\n\r\n  The chief authority for Groot's life is Thomas a Kempis, _Vita Gerardi\r\n  Magni_ (translated into English by J. P. Arthur, _The Founders of the\r\n  New Devotion_, 1905); also the _Chronicon Windeshemense_ of Johann\r\n  Busch (ed. K. Grube, 1886). An account, based on these sources, will\r\n  be found in S. Kettlewell, _Thomas a Kempis and the Brothers of Common\r\n  Life_ (1882). i. c. 5; and a shorter account in F. R. Cruise, _Thomas\r\n  a Kempis_, 1887, pt. ii. An excellent sketch, with an account of\r\n  Groot's writings, is given by L. Schulze in Herzog-Hauck,\r\n  _Realencyklopadie_ (ed. 3); he insists on the fact that Groot's\r\n  theological and ecclesiastical ideas were those commonly current in\r\n  his day, and that the attempts to make him \"a reformer before the\r\n  Reformation\" are unhistorical.     (E. C. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROOVE-TOOTHED SQUIRREL, a large and brilliantly coloured Bornean\r\nsquirrel, _Rhithrosciurus macrotis_, representing a genus by itself\r\ndistinguished from all other members of the family _Sciuridae_ by having\r\nnumerous longitudinal grooves on the front surface of the incisor teeth;\r\nthe molars being of a simpler type than in other members of the family.\r\nThe tail is large and fox-like, and the ears are tufted and the flanks\r\nmarked by black and white bands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROS, ANTOINE JEAN, BARON (1771-1835), French painter, was born at Paris\r\nin 1771. His father, who was a miniature painter, began to teach him to\r\ndraw at the age of six, and showed himself from the first an exacting\r\nmaster. Towards the close of 1785 Gros, by his own choice, entered the\r\nstudio of David, which he frequented assiduously, continuing at the same\r\ntime to follow the classes of the College Mazarin. The death of his\r\nfather, whose circumstances had been embarrassed by the Revolution,\r\nthrew Gros, in 1791, upon his own resources. He now devoted himself\r\nwholly to his profession, and competed in 1792 for the _grand prix_, but\r\nunsuccessfully. About this time, however, on the recommendation of the\r\nEcole des Beaux Arts, he was employed on the execution of portraits of\r\nthe members of the Convention, and when--disturbed by the development of\r\nthe Revolution--Gros in 1793 left France for Italy, he supported himself\r\nat Genoa by the same means, producing a great quantity of miniatures and\r\n_fixes_. He visited Florence, but returning to Genoa made the\r\nacquaintance of Josephine, and followed her to Milan, where he was well\r\nreceived by her husband. On November 15, 1796, Gros was present with the\r\narmy near Arcola when Bonaparte planted the tricolor on the bridge. Gros\r\nseized on this incident, and showed by his treatment of it that he had\r\nfound his vocation. Bonaparte at once gave him the post of \"inspecteur\r\naux revues,\" which enabled him to follow the army, and in 1797 nominated\r\nhim on the commission charged to select the spoils which should enrich\r\nthe Louvre. In 1799, having escaped from the besieged city of Genoa,\r\nGros made his way to Paris, and in the beginning of 1801 took up his\r\nquarters in the Capucins. His \"esquisse\" (Musee de Nantes) of the\r\n\"Battle of Nazareth\" gained the prize offered in 1802 by the consuls,\r\nbut was not carried out, owing it is said to the jealousy of Junot felt\r\nby Napoleon; but he indemnified Gros by commissioning him to paint his\r\nown visit to the pest-house of Jaffa. \"Les Pestiferes de Jaffa\" (Louvre)\r\nwas followed by the \"Battle of Aboukir\" 1806 (Versailles), and the\r\n\"Battle of Eylau,\" 1808 (Louvre). These three subjects--the popular\r\nleader facing the pestilence unmoved, challenging the splendid instant\r\nof victory, heart-sick with the bitter cost of a hard-won field--gave to\r\nGros his chief title to fame. As long as the military element remained\r\nbound up with French national life, Gros received from it a fresh and\r\nenergetic inspiration which carried him to the very heart of the events\r\nwhich he depicted; but as the army and its general separated from the\r\npeople, Gros, called on to illustrate episodes representative only of\r\nthe fulfilment of personal ambition, ceased to find the nourishment\r\nnecessary to his genius, and the defect of his artistic position became\r\nevident. Trained in the sect of the Classicists, he was shackled by\r\ntheir rules, even when--by his naturalistic treatment of types, and\r\nappeal to picturesque effect in colour and tone--he seemed to run\r\ncounter to them. In 1810 his \"Madrid\" and \"Napoleon at the Pyramids\"\r\n(Versailles) show that his star had deserted him. His \"Francis I.\" and\r\n\"Charles V.,\" 1812 (Louvre), had considerable success; but the\r\ndecoration of the dome of St Genevieve (begun in 1811 and completed in\r\n1824) is the only work of Gros's later years which shows his early force\r\nand vigour, as well as his skill. The \"Departure of Louis XVIII.\"\r\n(Versailles), the \"Embarkation of Madame d'Angouleme\" (Bordeaux), the\r\nplafond of the Egyptian room in the Louvre, and finally his \"Hercules\r\nand Diomedes,\" exhibited in 1835, testify only that Gros's efforts--in\r\naccordance with the frequent counsels of his old master David--to stem\r\nthe rising tide of Romanticism, served but to damage his once brilliant\r\nreputation. Exasperated by criticism and the consciousness of failure,\r\nGros sought refuge in the grosser pleasures of life. On the 25th of June\r\n1835 he was found drowned on the shores of the Seine near Sevres. From a\r\npaper which he had placed in his hat it became known that \"las de la\r\nvie, et trahi par les dernieres facultes qui la lui rendaient\r\nsupportable, il avait resolu de s'en defaire.\" The number of Gros's\r\npupils was very great, and was considerably augmented when, in 1815,\r\nDavid quitted Paris and made over his own classes to him. Gros was\r\ndecorated and named baron of the empire by Napoleon, after the Salon of\r\n1808, at which he had exhibited the \"Battle of Eylau.\" Under the\r\nRestoration he became a member of the Institute, professor at the Ecole\r\ndes Beaux Arts, and was named chevalier of the order of St Michel.\r\n\r\n  M. Delecluze gives a brief notice of his life in _Louis David et son\r\n  temps_, and Julius Meyer's _Geschichte der modernen franzosischen\r\n  Malerei_ contains an excellent criticism on his works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSART, ALEXANDER BALLOCH (1827-1899), Scottish divine and literary\r\neditor, the son of a building contractor, was born at Stirling on the\r\n18th of June 1827. He was educated at Edinburgh University, and in 1856\r\nbecame a Presbyterian minister at Kinross. In 1865 he went to Liverpool,\r\nand three years later to Blackburn. He resigned from the ministry in\r\n1892, and died at Dublin on the 16th of March 1899. Dr Grosart is\r\nchiefly remembered for his exertions in reprinting much rare Elizabethan\r\nliterature, a work which he undertook in the first instance from his\r\nstrong interest in Puritan theology. Among the first writers whose works\r\nhe edited were the Puritan divines, Richard Sibbes, Thomas Brooks and\r\nHerbert Palmer. Editions of Michael Bruce's _Poems_ (1865) and Richard\r\nGilpin's _Demonologia sacra_ (1867) followed. In 1868 he brought out a\r\nbibliography of the writings of Richard Baxter, and from that year until\r\n1876 he was occupied in reproducing for private subscribers the \"Fuller\r\nWorthies Library,\" a series of thirty-nine volumes which included the\r\nworks of Thomas Fuller, Sir John Davies, Fulke Greville, Henry Vaughan,\r\nAndrew Marvell, George Herbert, Richard Crashaw, John Donne and Sir\r\nPhilip Sidney. The last four volumes of the series were devoted to the\r\nworks of many little known and otherwise inaccessible authors. His\r\n_Occasional Issues of Unique and Very Rare Books_ (1875-1881) is of the\r\nutmost interest to the book-lover. It included among other things the\r\n_Annalia Dubrensia_ of Robert Dover. In 1876 still another series, known\r\nas the \"Chertsey Worthies Library,\" was begun. It included editions of\r\nthe works of Nicholas Breton, Francis Quarles, Dr Joseph Beaumont,\r\nAbraham Cowley, Henry More and John Davies of Hereford. Grosart was\r\nuntiring in his enthusiasm and energy for this kind of work. The two\r\nlast-named series were being produced simultaneously until 1881, and no\r\nsooner had they been completed than Grosart began the \"Huth Library,\" so\r\ncalled from the bibliophile Henry Huth, who possessed the originals of\r\nmany of the reprints. It included the works of Robert Greene, Thomas\r\nNash, Gabriel Harvey, and the prose tracts of Thomas Dekker. He also\r\nedited the complete works of Edmund Spenser and Samuel Daniel. From the\r\nTownley Hall collection he reprinted several MSS. and edited Sir John\r\nEliot's works, Sir Richard Boyle's _Lismore Papers_, and various\r\npublications for the Chetham Society, the Camden Society and the\r\nRoxburghe Club. Dr Grosart's faults of style and occasional inaccuracy\r\ndo not seriously detract from the immense value of his work. He was\r\nunwearied in searching for rare books, and he brought to light much\r\ninteresting literature, formerly almost inaccessible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSBEAK (Fr. _Grosbec_), a name very indefinitely applied to many birds\r\nbelonging to the families _Fringillidae_ and _Ploceidae_ of modern\r\nornithologists, and perhaps to some members of the _Emberizidae_ and\r\n_Tanagridae_, but always to birds distinguished by the great size of\r\ntheir bill. Taken alone it is commonly a synonym of hawfinch (q.v.), but\r\na prefix is usually added to indicate the species, as pine-grosbeak,\r\ncardinal-grosbeak and the like. By early writers the word was generally\r\ngiven as an equivalent of the Linnaean _Loxia_, but that genus has been\r\nfound to include many forms not now placed in the same family.\r\n\r\nThe Pine-grosbeak (_Pinicola enucleator_) inhabits the conifer-zone of\r\nboth the Old and the New Worlds, seeking, in Europe and probably\r\nelsewhere, a lower latitude as winter approaches--often journeying in\r\nlarge flocks; stragglers have occasionally reached the British Islands\r\n(Yarrell, _Br. Birds_, ed. 4, ii. 177-179). In structure and some of its\r\nhabits much resembling a bullfinch, but much exceeding that bird in\r\nsize, it has the plumage of a crossbill and appears to undergo the same\r\nchanges as do the members of the restricted genus _Loxia_--the young\r\nbeing of a dull greenish-grey streaked with brownish-black, the adult\r\nhens tinged with golden-green, and the cocks glowing with crimson-red on\r\nnearly all the body-feathers, this last colour being replaced after\r\nmoulting in confinement by bright yellow. Nests of this species were\r\nfound in 1821 by Johana Wilhelm Zetterstedt near Juckasjarwi in Swedish\r\nLapland, but little was known concerning its nidification until 1855,\r\nwhen John Wolley, after two years' ineffectual search, succeeded in\r\nobtaining near the Finnish village Muonioniska, on the Swedish frontier,\r\nwell-authenticated specimens with the eggs, both of which are like\r\nexaggerated bullfinches'. The food of this species seems to consist of\r\nthe seeds and buds of many sorts of trees, though the staple may very\r\npossibly be those of some kind of pine.\r\n\r\nAllied to the pine-grosbeak are a number of species of smaller size, but\r\nits equals in beauty of plumage.[1] They have been referred to several\r\ngenera, such as _Carpodacus_, _Propasser_, _Bycanetes_, _Uragus_ and\r\nothers; but possibly _Carpodacus_ is sufficient to contain all. Most of\r\nthem are natives of the Old World, and chiefly of its eastern division,\r\nbut several inhabit the western portion of North America, and one, _C.\r\ngithagineus_ (of which there seem to be at least two local races), is an\r\nespecial native of the deserts, or their borders, of Arabia and North\r\nAfrica, extending even to some of the Canary Islands--a singular\r\nmodification in the _habitat_ of a form which one would be apt to\r\nassociate exclusively with forest trees, and especially conifers.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal grosbeak, or Virginian nightingale, _Cardinalis\r\nvirginianus_, claims notice here, though doubts may be entertained as to\r\nthe family to which it really belongs. It is no less remarkable for its\r\nbright carmine attire, and an elongated crest of the same colour, than\r\nfor its fine song. Its ready adaptation to confinement has made it a\r\npopular cage-bird on both sides of the Atlantic. The hen is not so good\r\na songster as the cock bird. Her plumage, with exception of the wings\r\nand tail, which are of a dull red, is light-olive above and\r\nbrownish-yellow beneath. This species inhabits the eastern parts of the\r\nUnited States southward of 40 deg. N. lat., and also occurs in the\r\nBermudas. It is represented in the south-west of North America by other\r\nforms that by some writers are deemed species, and in the northern parts\r\nof South America by the _C. phoeniceus_, which would really seem\r\nentitled to distinction. Another kindred bird placed from its short and\r\nbroad bill in a different genus, and known as _Pyrrhuloxia sinuata_ or\r\nthe Texan cardinal, is found on the southern borders of the United\r\nStates and in Mexico; while among North American \"grosbeaks\" must also\r\nbe named the birds belonging to the genera _Guiraca_ and\r\n_Hedymeles_--the former especially exemplified by the beautiful blue _G.\r\ncaerulea_, and the latter by the brilliant rose-breasted _H.\r\nludovicianus_, which last extends its range into Canada.\r\n\r\nThe species of the Old World which, though commonly called \"grosbeaks,\"\r\ncertainly belong to the family _Ploceidae_, are treated under\r\nWEAVER-BIRD.     (A. N.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Many of them are described and illustrated in the _Monographie\r\n    des loxiens_ of Prince C. L. Bonaparte and Professor Schlegel (1850),\r\n    though it excludes many birds which an English writer would call\r\n    \"grosbeaks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSE, FRANCIS (c. 1730-1791), English antiquary, was born at Greenford\r\nin Middlesex, about the year 1730. His father was a wealthy Swiss\r\njeweller, settled at Richmond, Surrey. Grose early showed an interest in\r\nheraldry and antiquities, and his father procured him a position in the\r\nHeralds' College. In 1763, being then Richmond Herald, he sold his\r\ntabard, and shortly afterwards became adjutant and paymaster of the\r\nHampshire militia, where, as he himself humorously observed, the only\r\naccount-books he kept were his right and left pockets, into the one of\r\nwhich he received, and from the other of which he paid. This\r\ncarelessness exposed him to serious financial difficulties; and after a\r\nvain attempt to repair them by accepting a captaincy in the Surrey\r\nmilitia, the fortune left him by his father being squandered, he began\r\nto turn to account his excellent education and his powers as a\r\ndraughtsman. In 1757 he had been elected fellow of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries. In 1773 he began to publish his _Antiquities of England and\r\nWales_, a work which brought him money as well as fame. This, with its\r\nsupplementary parts relating to the Channel Islands, was not completed\r\ntill 1787. In 1789 he set out on an antiquarian tour through Scotland,\r\nand in the course of this journey met Burns, who composed in his honour\r\nthe famous song beginning \"Ken ye aught o' Captain Grose,\" and in that\r\nother poem, still more famous, \"Hear, land o' cakes, and brither Scots,\"\r\nwarned all Scotsmen of this \"chield amang them taking notes.\" In 1790 he\r\nbegan to publish the results of what Burns called \"his peregrinations\r\nthrough Scotland;\" but he had not finished the work when he bethought\r\nhimself of going over to Ireland and doing for that country what he had\r\nalready done for Great Britain. About a month after his arrival, while\r\nin Dublin, he died in an apoplectic fit at the dinner-table of a friend,\r\non the 12th of June 1791.\r\n\r\nGrose was a sort of antiquarian Falstaff--at least he possessed in a\r\nstriking degree the knight's physical peculiarities; but he was a man of\r\ntrue honour and charity, a valuable friend, \"overlooking little faults\r\nand seeking out greater virtues,\" and an inimitable boon companion. His\r\nhumour, his varied knowledge and his good nature were all eminently\r\ncalculated to make him a favourite in society. As Burns says of him--\r\n\r\n    \"But wad ye see him in his glee,\r\n     For meikle glee and fun has he,\r\n     Then set him down, and twa or three\r\n             Gude fellows wi' him;\r\n     And _port, O port!_ shine thou a wee,\r\n             And THEN ye'll see him!\"\r\n\r\n  Grose's works include _The Antiquities of England and Wales_ (6 vols.,\r\n  1773-1787); _Advice to the Officers of the British Army_ (1782), a\r\n  satire in the manner of Swift's _Directions to Servants; A Guide to\r\n  Health, Beauty, Riches and Honour_ (1783), a collection of\r\n  advertisements of the period, with characteristic satiric preface; _A\r\n  Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue_ (1785); _A Treatise on\r\n  Ancient Armour and Weapons_ (1785-1789); Darrell's _History of Dover_\r\n  (1786); _Military Antiquities_ (2 vols., 1786-1788); _A Provincial\r\n  Glossary_ (1787); _Rules for Drawing Caricatures_ (1788); _The\r\n  Antiquities of Scotland_ (2 vols., 1789-1791); _Antiquities of\r\n  Ireland_ (2 vols., 1791), edited and partly written by Ledwich. _The\r\n  Grumbler_, sixteen humerous essays, appeared in 1791 after his death;\r\n  and in 1793 _The Olio_, a collection of essays, jests and small pieces\r\n  of poetry, highly characteristic of Grose, though certainly not all by\r\n  him, was put together from his papers by his publisher, who was also\r\n  his executor.\r\n\r\n  A capital full-length portrait of Grose by N. Dance is in the first\r\n  volume of the _Antiquities of England and Wales_, and another is among\r\n  Kay's _Portraits_. A versified sketch of him appeared in the\r\n  _Gentleman's Magazine_, lxi. 660. See _Gentleman's Magazine_, lxi.\r\n  498, 582; Noble's _Hist. of the College of Arms_, p. 434; _Notes and\r\n  Queries_, 1st ser., ix. 350; 3rd ser., i. 64, x. 280-281; 5th ser.,\r\n  xii. 148; 6th ser., ii. 47, 257, 291; Hone, _Every-day Book_, i. 655.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSS, properly thick, bulky, the meaning of the Late Lat. _grossus_.\r\nThe Latin word has usually been taken as cognate with _crassus_, thick,\r\nbut this is now doubted. It also appears not to be connected with the\r\nGer. _gross_, a Teutonic word represented in English by \"great.\" Apart\r\nfrom its direct meaning, and such figurative senses as coarse, vulgar\r\nor flagrant, the chief uses are whole, entire, without deduction, as\r\nopposed to \"net,\" or as applied to that which is sold in bulk as opposed\r\nto \"retail\" (cf. \"grocer\" and \"engrossing\"). As a unit of tale, \"gross\"\r\nequals 12 dozen, 144, sometimes known as \"small gross,\" in contrast with\r\n\"great gross,\" i.e. 12 gross, 144 dozen. As a technical expression in\r\nEnglish common law, \"in gross\" is applied to an incorporeal hereditament\r\nattached to the person of an owner, in contradistinction to one which is\r\nappendant or appurtenant, that is, attached to the ownership of land\r\n(see COMMONS).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSSE, JULIUS WALDEMAR (1828-1902), German poet, the son of a military\r\nchaplain, was born at Erfurt on the 25th of April 1828. He received his\r\nearly education at the gymnasium in Magdeburg, and on leaving school and\r\nshowing disinclination for the ministry, entered an architect's office.\r\nBut his mind was bent upon literature, and in 1849 he entered the\r\nuniversity of Halle, where, although inscribed as a student of law, he\r\ndevoted himself almost exclusively to letters. His first poetical essay\r\nwas with the tragedy _Cola di Rienzi_ (1851), followed in the same year\r\nby a comedy, _Eine Nachtpartie Shakespeares_, which was at once produced\r\non the stage. The success of these first two pieces encouraged him to\r\nfollow literature as a profession, and proceeding in 1852 to Munich, he\r\njoined the circle of young poets of whom Paul Heyse (q.v.) and Hermann\r\nLingg (1820-1905) were the chief. For six years (1855-1861) he was\r\ndramatic critic of the _Neue Munchener Zeitung_, and was then for a\r\nwhile on the staff of the _Leipziger Illustrierte Zeitung_, but in 1862\r\nhe returned to Munich as editor of the _Bayrische Zeitung_, a post he\r\nretained until the paper ceased to exist in 1867. In 1869 Grosse was\r\nappointed secretary of the _Schiller-Stiftung_, and lived for the next\r\nfew years alternately in Weimar, Dresden and Munich, until, in 1890, he\r\ntook up his permanent residence in Weimar. He was made grand-ducal\r\n_Hofrat_ and had the title of \"professor.\" He died at Torbole on the\r\nLago di Garda on the 9th of May 1902.\r\n\r\nGrosse was a most prolific writer of novels, dramas and poems. As a\r\nlyric poet, especially in _Gedichte_ (1857) and _Aus bewegten Tagen_, a\r\nvolume of poems (1869), he showed himself more to advantage than in his\r\nnovels, of which latter, however, _Untreu aus Mitleid_ (2 vols., 1868);\r\n_Vox populi, vox dei_ (1869); _Maria Mancini_ (1871); _Neue Erzahlungen_\r\n(1875); _Sophie Monnier_ (1876), and _Ein Frauenlos_ (1888) are\r\nremarkable for a certain elegance of style. His tragedies, _Die\r\nYnglinger_ (1858); _Tiberius_ (1876); _Johann von Schwaben_; and the\r\ncomedy _Die steinerne Braut_, had considerable success on the stage.\r\n\r\n  Grosse's _Gesammelte dramatische Werke_ appeared in 7 vols. in Leipzig\r\n  (1870), while his _Erzahlende Dichtungen_ were published at Berlin (6\r\n  vols., 1871-1873). An edition of his selected works by A. Bartels is\r\n  in preparation. See also his autobiography, _Literarische Ursachen und\r\n  Wirkungen_ (1896); R. Prutz, _Die Literatur der Gegenwart_ (1859); J.\r\n  Ethe, _J. Grosse als epischer Dichter_ (1872).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSSENHAIN, a town In the kingdom of Saxony, 20 m. N. from Dresden, on\r\nthe main line of railway (via Elsterwerda) to Berlin and at the junction\r\nof lines to Priestewitz and Frankfort-on-Oder. Pop. (1905) 12,015. It\r\nhas an Evangelical church, a modern and a commercial school, a library\r\nand an extensive public park. The industries are very important, and\r\nembrace manufactures of woollen and cotton stuffs, buckskin, leather,\r\nglass and machinery. Grossenhain was originally a Sorb settlement. It\r\nwas for a time occupied by the Bohemians, by whom it was strongly\r\nfortified. It afterwards came into the possession of the margraves of\r\nMeissen, from whom it was taken in 1312 by the margraves of Brandenburg.\r\nIt suffered considerably in all the great German wars, and in 1744 was\r\nnearly destroyed by fire. On the 16th of May 1813, a battle took place\r\nhere between the French and the Russians.\r\n\r\n  See G. W. Schuberth, _Chronik der Stadt Grossenhain_ (Grossenhain,\r\n  1887-1892).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSSETESTE, ROBERT (c. 1175-1253), English statesman, theologian and\r\nbishop of Lincoln, was born of humble parents at Stradbrook in Suffolk.\r\nHe received his education at Oxford where he became proficient in law,\r\nmedicine and the natural sciences. Giraldus Cambrensis, whose\r\nacquaintance he had made, introduced him, before 1199, to William de\r\nVere, bishop of Hereford. Grosseteste aspired to a post in the bishop's\r\nhousehold, but being deprived by death of this patron betook himself to\r\nthe study of theology. It is possible that he visited Paris for this\r\npurpose, but he finally settled in Oxford as a teacher. His first\r\npreferment of importance was the chancellorship of the university. He\r\ngained considerable distinction as a lecturer, and was the first rector\r\nof the school which the Franciscans established in Oxford about 1224.\r\nGrosseteste's learning is highly praised by Roger Bacon, who was a\r\nsevere critic. According to Bacon, Grosseteste knew little Greek or\r\nHebrew and paid slight attention to the works of Aristotle, but was\r\npre-eminent among his contemporaries for his knowledge of the natural\r\nsciences. Between 1214 and 1231 Grosseteste held in succession the\r\narchdeaconries of Chester, Northampton and Leicester. In 1232, after a\r\nsevere illness, he resigned all his benefices and preferments except one\r\nprebend which he held at Lincoln. His intention was to spend the rest of\r\nhis life in contemplative piety. But he retained the office of\r\nchancellor, and in 1235 accepted the bishopric of Lincoln. He undertook\r\nwithout delay the reformation of morals and clerical discipline\r\nthroughout his vast diocese. This scheme brought him into conflict with\r\nmore than one privileged corporation, but in particular with his own\r\nchapter, who vigorously disputed his claim to exercise the right of\r\nvisitation over their community. The dispute raged hotly from 1239 to\r\n1245. It was conducted on both sides with unseemly violence, and those\r\nwho most approved of Grosseteste's main purpose thought it needful to\r\nwarn him against the mistake of over-zeal. But in 1245, by a personal\r\nvisit to the papal court at Lyons, he secured a favourable verdict. In\r\necclesiastical politics the bishop belonged to the school of Becket. His\r\nzeal for reform led him to advance, on behalf of the courts-Christian,\r\npretensions which it was impossible that the secular power should admit.\r\nHe twice incurred a well-merited rebuke from Henry III. upon this\r\nsubject; although it was left for Edward I. to settle the question of\r\nprinciple in favour of the state. The devotion of Grosseteste to the\r\nhierarchical theories of his age is attested by his correspondence with\r\nhis chapter and the king. Against the former he upheld the prerogative\r\nof the bishops; against the latter he asserted that it was impossible\r\nfor a bishop to disregard the commands of the Holy See. Where the\r\nliberties of the national church came into conflict with the pretensions\r\nof Rome he stood by his own countrymen. Thus in 1238 he demanded that\r\nthe king should release certain Oxford scholars who had assaulted the\r\nlegate Otho. But at least up to the year 1247 he submitted patiently to\r\npapal encroachments, contenting himself with the protection (by a\r\nspecial papal privilege) of his own diocese from alien clerks. Of royal\r\nexactions he was more impatient; and after the retirement of Archbishop\r\nSaint Edmund (q.v.) constituted himself the spokesman of the clerical\r\nestate in the Great Council. In 1244 he sat on a committee which was\r\nempanelled to consider a demand for a subsidy. The committee rejected\r\nthe demand, and Grosseteste foiled an attempt on the king's part to\r\nseparate the clergy from the baronage. \"It is written,\" the bishop said,\r\n\"that united we stand and divided we fall.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, however, soon made clear that the king and pope were in alliance\r\nto crush the independence of the English clergy; and from 1250 onwards\r\nGrosseteste openly criticized the new financial expedients to which\r\nInnocent IV. had been driven by his desperate conflict with the Empire.\r\nIn the course of a visit which he made to Innocent in this year, the\r\nbishop laid before the pope and cardinals a written memorial in which he\r\nascribed all the evils of the Church to the malignant influence of the\r\nCuria. It produced no effect, although the cardinals felt that\r\nGrosseteste was too influential to be punished for his audacity. Much\r\ndiscouraged by his failure the bishop thought of resigning. In the end,\r\nhowever, he decided to continue the unequal struggle. In 1251 he\r\nprotested against a papal mandate enjoining the English clergy to pay\r\nHenry III. one-tenth of their revenues for a crusade; and called\r\nattention to the fact that, under the system of provisions, a sum of\r\n70,000 marks was annually drawn from England by the alien nominees of\r\nRome. In 1253, upon being commanded to provide in his own diocese for a\r\npapal nephew, he wrote a letter of expostulation and refusal, not to the\r\npope himself but to the commissioner, Master Innocent, through whom he\r\nreceived the mandate. The text of the remonstrance, as given in the\r\n_Burton Annals_ and in Matthew Paris, has possibly been altered by a\r\nforger who had less respect than Grosseteste for the papacy. The\r\nlanguage is more violent than that which the bishop elsewhere employs.\r\nBut the general argument, that the papacy may command obedience only so\r\nfar as its commands are consonant with the teaching of Christ and the\r\napostles, is only what should be expected from an ecclesiastical\r\nreformer of Grosseteste's time. There is much more reason for suspecting\r\nthe letter addressed \"to the nobles of England, the citizens of London,\r\nand the community of the whole realm,\" in which Grosseteste is\r\nrepresented as denouncing in unmeasured terms papal finance in all its\r\nbranches. But even in this case allowance must be made for the\r\ndifference between modern and medieval standards of decorum.\r\n\r\nGrosseteste numbered among his most intimate friends the Franciscan\r\nteacher, Adam Marsh (q.v.). Through Adam he came into close relations\r\nwith Simon de Montfort. From the Franciscan's letters it appears that\r\nthe earl had studied a political tract by Grosseteste on the difference\r\nbetween a monarchy and a tyranny; and that he embraced with enthusiasm\r\nthe bishop's projects of ecclesiastical reform. Their alliance began as\r\nearly as 1239, when Grosseteste exerted himself to bring about a\r\nreconciliation between the king and the earl. But there is no reason to\r\nsuppose that the political ideas of Montfort had matured before the\r\ndeath of Grosseteste; nor did Grosseteste busy himself overmuch with\r\nsecular politics, except in so far as they touched the interest of the\r\nChurch. Grosseteste realized that the misrule of Henry III. and his\r\nunprincipled compact with the papacy largely accounted for the\r\ndegeneracy of the English hierarchy and the laxity of ecclesiastical\r\ndiscipline. But he can hardly be termed a constitutionalist.\r\n\r\nGrosseteste died on the 9th of October 1253. He must then have been\r\nbetween seventy and eighty years of age. He was already an elderly man,\r\nwith a firmly established reputation, when he became a bishop. As an\r\necclesiastical statesman he showed the same fiery zeal and versatility\r\nof which he had given proof in his academical career; but the general\r\ntendency of modern writers has been to exaggerate his political and\r\necclesiastical services, and to neglect his performances as a scientist\r\nand scholar. The opinion of his own age, as expressed by Matthew Paris\r\nand Roger Bacon, was very different. His contemporaries, while admitting\r\nthe excellence of his intentions as a statesman, lay stress upon his\r\ndefects of temper and discretion. But they see in him the pioneer of a\r\nliterary and scientific movement; not merely a great ecclesiastic who\r\npatronized learning in his leisure hours, but the first mathematician\r\nand physicist of his age. It is certainly true that he anticipated, in\r\nthese fields of thought, some of the most striking ideas to which Roger\r\nBacon subsequently gave a wider currency.\r\n\r\n  See the _Epistolae Roberti Grosseteste_ (Rolls Series, 1861) edited\r\n  with a valuable introduction by H. R. Luard. Grosseteste's famous\r\n  memorial to the pope is printed in the appendix to E. Brown's\r\n  _Fasciculus rerum expetendarum et fugiendarum_ (1690). A tract _De\r\n  phisicis, lineis, angulis et figuris_ was printed at Nuremberg in\r\n  1503, A French poem, _Le Chastel d'amour_, sometimes attributed to\r\n  him, has been printed by the Caxton Society. Two curious tracts, the\r\n  \"De moribus pueri ad mensam\" (printed by Wynkyn de Worde) and the\r\n  \"Statuta familiae Roberti Grosseteste\" (printed by J. S. Brewer in\r\n  _Monumenta Franciscana_, i. 582), may be from his pen; but the editor\r\n  of the latter work ascribes it to Adam de Marsh. There is less doubt\r\n  respecting the _Reules Seynt Robert_, a tract giving advice for the\r\n  management of the household of the countess of Lincoln. For\r\n  Grosseteste's life and work see Roger Bacon's _Opus majus_ (ed. J. H.\r\n  Bridges, 1897, 2 vols.) and _Opera quaedam inedita_ (ed. J. S. Brewer,\r\n  Rolls Series, 1859); M. Paris's _Chronica majora_ (ed. H. R. Luard,\r\n  Rolls Series, 1872-1883, 5 vols.); and the _Lives_ by S. Pegge (1793)\r\n  and F. S. Stevenson (1899).     (H. W. C. D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSSETO, a town and episcopal see of Tuscany, capital of the province\r\nof Grosseto, 90 m. S.S.E. of Pisa by rail. Pop. (1901) 5856 (town), 8843\r\n(commune). It is 38 ft. above sea-level, and is almost circular in\r\nshape; it is surrounded by fortifications, constructed by Francis I.\r\n(1574-1587) and Ferdinand I. (1587-1609), which form a hexagonal\r\nenceinte with projecting bastions, with two gates only. The small\r\ncathedral, begun in 1294, is built of red and white marble alternating,\r\nin the Italian Gothic style; it was restored in 1855. The citadel was\r\nbuilt in 1311 by the Sienese. Grosseto is on the main line from Pisa to\r\nRome, and is also the starting-point (Montepescali, 8 m. to the N., is\r\nthe exact point of divergence) of a branch line to Asciano and Siena.\r\n\r\nThe town dates from the middle ages. In 1138 the episcopal see was\r\ntransferred thither from Rusellae. In 1230 it, with the rest of the\r\nMaremma, of which it is the capital, came under the dominion of Siena.\r\nBy the peace of 1559, however, it passed to Cosimo I. of Tuscany. In\r\n1745 the malaria had grown to such an extent, owing to the neglect of\r\nthe drainage works, that Grosseto had only 648 inhabitants, though in\r\n1224 it had 3000 men who bore arms. Leopold I. renewed drainage\r\noperations, and by 1836 the population had risen to 2392. The malaria is\r\nnot yet entirely conquered, however, and the official headquarters of\r\nthe province are in summer transferred to Scansano (1837 ft.), 20 m. to\r\nthe S.E. by road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSSI, GIOVANNI FRANCESCO (?-1699), one of the greatest Italian singers\r\nof the age of _bel canto_, better known as Siface, was born at Pescia in\r\nTuscany about the middle of the 17th century. He entered the papal\r\nchapel in 1675, and later sang at Venice. He derived his nickname of\r\nSiface from his impersonation of that character in an opera of Cavalli.\r\nIt has generally been said that he appeared as Siface in Alessandro\r\nScarlatti's _Mitridate_, but the confusion is due to his having sung the\r\npart of Mitridate in Scarlatti's _Pompeo_ at Naples in 1683. In 1687 he\r\nwas sent to London by the duke of Modena, to become a member of the\r\nchapel of James II. He probably did much for the introduction of Italian\r\nmusic into England, but soon left the country on account of the climate.\r\nAmong Purcell's harpsichord music is an air entitled \"Sefauchi's\r\nFarewell.\" He was murdered in 1699 on the road between Bologna and\r\nFerrara, probably by the agents of a nobleman with whose wife he had a\r\n_liaison_.\r\n\r\n  See Corrado Ricci's _Vita Barocca_ (Milan, 1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSSI, TOMMASO (1791-1853), Lombard poet and novelist, was born at\r\nBellano, on the Lake of Como, on the 20th of January 1791. He took his\r\ndegree in law at Pavia in 1810, and proceeded thence to Milan to\r\nexercise his profession; but the Austrian government, suspecting his\r\nloyalty, interfered with his prospects, and in consequence Grossi was a\r\nsimple notary all his life. That the suspicion was well grounded he soon\r\nshowed by writing in the Milanese dialect the battle poem _La Prineide_,\r\nin which he described with vivid colours the tragical death of Prina,\r\nchief treasurer during the empire, whom the people of Milan, instigated\r\nby Austrian agitators, had torn to pieces and dragged through the\r\nstreets of the town (1814). The poem, being anonymous, was first\r\nattributed to the celebrated Porta, but Grossi of his own accord\r\nacknowledged himself the author. In 1816 he published other two poems,\r\nwritten likewise in Milanese--_The Golden Rain_ (La Pioggia d'oro) and\r\n_The Fugitive_ (La Fuggitiva). These compositions secured him the\r\nfriendship of Porta and Manzoni, and the three poets came to form a sort\r\nof romantic literary triumvirate. Grossi took advantage of the\r\npopularity of his Milanese poems to try Italian verse, into which he\r\nsought to introduce the moving realism which had given such satisfaction\r\nin his earliest compositions; and in this he was entirely successful\r\nwith his poem _Ildegonda_ (1814). He next wrote an epic poem, entitled\r\n_The Lombards in the First Crusade_, a work of which Manzoni makes\r\nhonourable mention in _I Promessi Sposi_. This composition, which was\r\npublished by subscription (1826), attained a success unequalled by that\r\nof any other Italian poem within the century. The example of Manzoni\r\ninduced Grossi to write an historical novel entitled _Marco Visconti_\r\n(1834)--a work which contains passages of fine description and deep\r\npathos. A little later Grossi published a tale in verse, _Ulrico and\r\nLida_, but with this publication his poetical activity ceased. After\r\nhis marriage in 1838 he continued to employ himself as a notary in Milan\r\ntill his death on the 10th of December 1853.\r\n\r\n  His _Life_ by Cantu appeared at Milan in 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSSMITH, GEORGE (1847-   ), English comedian, was born on the 9th of\r\nDecember 1847, the son of a law reporter and entertainer of the same\r\nname. After some years of journalistic work he started about 1870 as a\r\npublic entertainer, with songs and recitations; but in 1877 he began a\r\nlong connexion with the Gilbert and Sullivan operas at the Savoy\r\nTheatre, London, in _The Sorcerer_. For twelve years he had the leading\r\npart, his capacity for \"patter-songs,\" and his humorous acting, dancing\r\nand singing marking his creations of the chief characters in the Gilbert\r\nand Sullivan operas as the expression of a highly original\r\nindividuality. In 1889 he left the Savoy, and again set up as an\r\nentertainer, visiting all the cities of Great Britain and the United\r\nStates, but retiring in 1901. Among other books he wrote _The\r\nReminiscences of a Society Clown_ (1888); and, with his brother Weedon,\r\n_The Diary of a Nobody_ (1894). His humorous songs and sketches numbered\r\nover six hundred. His younger brother, Weedon Grossmith, who was\r\neducated as a painter and exhibited at the Academy, also took to the\r\nstage, his first notable success being in the _Pantomime Rehearsal_; in\r\n1894 he went into management on his own account, and had much success as\r\na comedian. George Grossmith's two sons, Laurence Grossmith and George\r\nGrossmith, jun., were both actors, the latter becoming a well-known\r\nfigure in the musical comedies at the Gaiety Theatre, London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROS VENTRES (Fr. for \"Great Bellies\"), or Atsina, a tribe of North\r\nAmerican Indians of Algonquian stock. The name is said to have reference\r\nto the greediness of the people, but more probably originated from their\r\nprominent tattooing. They are settled at Fort Belknap agency, Montana.\r\nThe name has also been given to other tribes, e.g. the Hidatsa or\r\nMinitari, now at Fort Berthold, North Dakota.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROTE, GEORGE (1794-1871), English historian of Greece, was born on the\r\n17th of November 1794, at Clay Hill near Beckenham in Kent. His\r\ngrandfather, Andreas, originally a Bremen merchant, was one of the\r\nfounders (1st of January 1766) of the banking-house of Grote, Prescott &\r\nCompany in Threadneedle Street, London (the name of Grote did not\r\ndisappear from the firm till 1879). His father, also George, married\r\n(1793) Selina, daughter of Henry Peckwell (1747-1787), minister of the\r\ncountess of Huntingdon's chapel in Westminster (descended from a\r\nHuguenot family, the de Blossets, who had left Touraine on the\r\nrevocation of the Edict of Nantes), and had one daughter and ten sons,\r\nof whom the historian was the eldest. Educated at first by his mother,\r\nGeorge Grote was sent to the Sevenoaks grammar school (1800-1804) and\r\nafterwards to Charterhouse (1804-1810), where he studied under Dr Raine\r\nin company with Connop Thirlwall, George and Horace Waddington and Henry\r\nHavelock. In spite of Grote's school successes, his father refused to\r\nsend him to the university and put him in the bank in 1810. He spent all\r\nhis spare time in the study of classics, history, metaphysics and\r\npolitical economy, and in learning German, French and Italian. Driven by\r\nhis mother's Puritanism and his father's contempt for academic learning\r\nto outside society, he became intimate with Charles Hay Cameron, who\r\nstrengthened him in his love of philosophy, and George W. Norman,\r\nthrough whom he met his wife, Miss Harriet Lewin (see below). After\r\nvarious difficulties the marriage took place on the 5th of March 1820,\r\nand was in all respects a happy union.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Grote had finally decided his philosophic and political\r\nattitude. In 1817 he came under the influence of David Ricardo, and\r\nthrough him of James Mill and Jeremy Bentham. He settled in 1820 in a\r\nhouse attached to the bank in Threadneedle Street, where his only child\r\ndied a week after its birth. During Mrs Grote's slow convalescence at\r\nHampstead, he wrote his first published work, the _Statement of the\r\nQuestion of Parliamentary Reform_ (1821), in reply to Sir James\r\nMackintosh's article in the _Edinburgh Review_, advocating popular\r\nrepresentation, vote by ballot and short parliaments. In 1822 he\r\npublished in the _Morning Chronicle_ (April) a letter against Canning's\r\nattack on Lord John Russell, and edited, or rather re-wrote, some\r\ndiscursive papers of Bentham, which he published under the title\r\n_Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the Temporal Happiness\r\nof Mankind by Philip Beauchamp_ (1822). The book was published in the\r\nname of Richard Carlile, then in gaol at Dorchester. Though not a member\r\nof J. S. Mill's Utilitarian Society (1822-1823). he took a great\r\ninterest in a society for reading and discussion, which met (from 1823)\r\nin a room at the bank before business hours twice a week. From the\r\n_Posthumous Papers_ (pp. 22, 24) it is clear that Mrs Grote was wrong in\r\nasserting that she first in 1823 (autumn) suggested the _History of\r\nGreece_; the book was already in preparation in 1822, though what was\r\nthen written was subsequently reconstructed. In 1826 Grote published in\r\nthe _Westminster Review_ (April) a criticism of Mitford's _History of\r\nGreece_, which shows that his ideas were already in order. From 1826 to\r\n1830 he was hard at work with J. S. Mill and Henry Brougham in the\r\norganization of the new \"university\" in Gower Street. He was a member of\r\nthe council which organized the faculties and the curriculum; but in\r\n1830, owing to a difference with Mill as to an appointment to one of the\r\nphilosophical chairs, he resigned his position.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 he went abroad, and, attracted by the political crisis, spent\r\nsome months in Paris in the society of the Liberal leaders. Recalled by\r\nhis father's death (6th of July), he not only became manager of the\r\nbank, but took a leading position among the city Radicals. In 1831 he\r\npublished his important _Essentials of Parliamentary Reform_ (an\r\nelaboration of his previous _Statement_), and, after refusing to stand\r\nas parliamentary candidate for the city in 1831, changed his mind and\r\nwas elected head of the poll, with three other Liberals, in December\r\n1832. After serving in three parliaments, he resigned in 1841, by which\r\ntime his party (\"the philosophic Radicals\") had dwindled away. During\r\nthese years of active public life, his interest in Greek history and\r\nphilosophy had increased, and after a trip to Italy in 1842, he severed\r\nhis connexion with the bank and devoted himself to literature. In 1846\r\nthe first two volumes of the _History_ appeared, and the remaining ten\r\nbetween 1847 and the spring of 1856. In 1845 with Molesworth and Raikes\r\nCurrie he gave monetary assistance to Auguste Comte (q.v.), then in\r\nfinancial difficulties. The formation of the Sonderbund (20th of July\r\n1847) led him to visit Switzerland and study for himself a condition of\r\nthings in some sense analogous to that of the ancient Greek states. This\r\nvisit resulted in the publication in the _Spectator_ of seven weekly\r\nletters, collected in book form at the end of 1847 (see a letter to de\r\nTocqueville in Mrs Grote's reprint of the _Seven Letters_, 1876).\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Grote began to prepare his works on Plato and Aristotle. _Plato\r\nand the Other Companions of Sokrates_ (3 vols.) appeared in 1865, but\r\nthe work on Aristotle he was not destined to complete. He had finished\r\nthe _Organon_ and was about to deal with the metaphysical and physical\r\ntreatises when he died on the 18th of June 1871, and was buried in\r\nWestminster Abbey. He was a man of strong character and self-control,\r\nunfailing courtesy and unswerving devotion to what he considered the\r\nbest interests of the nation. To colleagues and subordinates alike, he\r\nwas considerate and tolerant; he was unassuming, trustworthy in the\r\nsmallest detail, accurate and comprehensive in thought, energetic and\r\nconscientious in action. Yet, hidden under his calm exterior there was a\r\nburning enthusiasm and a depth of passion of which only his intimate\r\nfriends were aware.\r\n\r\nHis work may best be considered under the following heads:\r\n\r\n1. _Grote's Services to Education._--He took, as already stated, an\r\nimportant part in the foundation and organization of the original\r\nuniversity of London, which began its public work in Gower Street on the\r\n28th of October 1828, and in 1836, on the incorporation of the\r\nuniversity of London proper, became known as University College. In 1849\r\nhe was re-elected to the council, in 1860 he became treasurer, and on\r\nthe death of Brougham (1868) president. He took a keen interest in all\r\nthe work of the college, presented to it the _Marmor Homericum_, and\r\nfinally bequeathed the reversion of L6000 for the endowment of a chair\r\nof philosophy of mind and logic. The emoluments of this sum were,\r\nhowever, to be held over and added to the principal if at any time the\r\nholder of the chair should be \"a minister of the Church of England or of\r\nany other religious persuasion.\" In 1850 the senate of the university\r\nwas reconstituted, and Grote was one of seven eminent men who were added\r\nto it. Eventually he became the strongest advocate for open\r\nexaminations, for the claims not only of philosophy and classics but\r\nalso of natural science, and, as vice-chancellor in 1862, for the\r\nadmission of women to examinations. This latter reform was carried in\r\n1868. He succeeded his friend Henry Hallam as a trustee of the British\r\nMuseum in 1859, and took part in the reorganization of the departments\r\nof antiquities and natural science.\r\n\r\nThe honours which he received in recognition of these services were as\r\nfollows: D.C.L. of Oxford (1853); LL.D. Cambridge (1861); F.R.S. (1857);\r\nhonorary professor of ancient history in the Royal Academy (1859). By\r\nthe French Academy of Moral and Political Sciences he was made\r\ncorrespondent (1857) and foreign associate (the first Englishman since\r\nMacaulay) (1864). In 1869 he refused Gladstone's offer of a peerage.\r\n\r\n2. _Political Career._--In politics Grote belonged to the \"philosophic\r\nRadicals\" of the school of J. S. Mill and Bentham, whose chief\r\nprinciples were representative government, vote by ballot, the abolition\r\nof a state church, frequent elections. He adhered to these principles\r\nthroughout, and refused to countenance any reforms which were\r\nincompatible with them. By this uncompromising attitude, he gradually\r\nlost all his supporters save a few men of like rigidity. As a speaker,\r\nhe was clear, logical and impressive, and on select committees his\r\ncommon sense was most valuable. For his speeches see A. Bain in the\r\n_Minor Works_; see also BALLOT.\r\n\r\n3. _The History of Greece._--It is on this work that Grote's reputation\r\nmainly rests. Though half a century has passed since its production, it\r\nis still in some sense the text-book. It consists of two parts, the\r\n\"Legendary\" and the \"Historical\" Greece. The former, owing to the\r\ndevelopment of comparative mythology, is now of little authority, and\r\nportions of part ii. are obsolete owing partly to the immense\r\naccumulations of epigraphic and archaeological research, partly to the\r\nsubsequent discovery of the Aristotelian _Constitution of Athens_, and\r\npartly also to the more careful weighing of evidence which Grote himself\r\nmisinterpreted. The interest of the work is twofold. In the first place\r\nit contains a wonderful mass of information carefully collected from all\r\nsources, arranged on a simple plan, and expressed in direct forcible\r\nlanguage. It is in this respect one of the few great comprehensive\r\nhistories in our possession, great in scope, conception and\r\naccomplishment. But more than this it is interesting as among the first\r\nworks in which Greek history became a separate study, based on real\r\nevidence and governed by the criteria of modern historical science.\r\nFurther Grote, a practical man, a rationalist and an enthusiast for\r\ndemocracy, was the first to consider Greek political development with a\r\nsympathetic interest (see GREECE: _History, Ancient_, section\r\n\"Authorities\"), in opposition to the Tory attitude of John Gillies and\r\nMitford, who had written under the influence of horror at the French\r\nRevolution. On the whole his work was done with impartiality, and more\r\nrecent study has only confirmed his general conclusions. Much has been\r\nmade of his defective accounts of the tyrants and the Macedonian empire,\r\nand his opinion that Greek history ceased to be interesting or\r\ninstructive after Chaeronea. It is true that he confined his interest to\r\nthe fortunes of the city state and neglected the wider diffusion of the\r\nGreek culture, but this is after all merely a criticism of the title of\r\nthe book. The value of the _History_ consists to-day primarily in its\r\nexamination of the Athenian democracy, its growth and decline, an\r\nexamination which is still the most inspiring, and in general the most\r\ninstructive, in any language. In the description of battles and military\r\noperations generally Grote was handicapped by the lack of personal\r\nknowledge of the country. In this respect he is inferior to men like\r\nErnst Curtius and G. B. Grundy.\r\n\r\n4. _In Philosophy_ Grote was a follower of the Mills and Bentham. J. S.\r\nMill paid a tribute to him in the preface to the third edition of his\r\n_Examination of Sir Wm. Hamilton's Philosophy_, and there is no doubt\r\nthat the empirical school owed a great deal to his sound, accurate\r\nthinking, untrammelled by any reverence for authority, technique and\r\nconvention. In dealing with Plato he was handicapped by this very common\r\nsense, which prevented him from appreciating the theory of ideas in its\r\nwidest relations. His _Plato_ is important in that it emphasizes the\r\ngenerally neglected passages of Plato in which he seems to indulge in\r\nmere Socratic dialectic rather than to seek knowledge; it is, therefore,\r\nto be read as a corrective to the ordinary criticism of Plato. The more\r\ncongenial study of Aristotle, though incomplete, is more valuable in the\r\npositive sense, and has not received the attention it deserves. Perhaps\r\nGrote's most distinctive contribution to the study of Greek philosophy\r\nis his chapter in the _History of Greece_ on the Sophists, of whom he\r\ntook a view somewhat more favourable than has been accepted before or\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nHis wife, HARRIET LEWIN (1792-1878), was the daughter of Thomas Lewin, a\r\nretired Indian civilian, settled in Southampton. After her marriage with\r\nGrote in 1820 she devoted herself to the subjects in which he was\r\ninterested and was a prominent figure in the literary, political and\r\nphilosophical circle in which he lived. She carefully read the proofs of\r\nhis work and relieved him of anxiety in connexion with his property.\r\nAmong her writings are: _Memoir of Ary Scheffer_ (1860); _Collected\r\nPapers_ (1862); and her biography of her husband (1873). Another\r\npublication, _The Philosophical Radicals of 1832_ (privately circulated\r\nin 1866), is interesting for the light it throws on the Reform movement\r\nof 1832 to 1842, especially on Molesworth.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--_The History of Greece_ passed through five editions\r\n  the fifth (10 vols., 1888) being final. An edition covering the period\r\n  from Solon to 403, with new notes and excursuses, was published by J.\r\n  M. Mitchell and M. O. B. Caspari in 1907. The _Plato_ was finally\r\n  edited by Alexander Bain in 4 vols. See Mrs Grote's _Personal Life of\r\n  George Grote_, and article in _Dict. Nat. Biog._ by G. Croom\r\n  Robertson.     (J. M. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROTEFEND, GEORG FRIEDRICH (1775-1853), German epigraphist, was born at\r\nMunden in Hanover on the 9th of June 1775. He was educated partly in his\r\nnative town, partly at Ilfeld, where he remained till 1795, when he\r\nentered the university of Gottingen, and there became the friend of\r\nHeyne, Tychsen and Heeren. Heyne's recommendation procured for him an\r\nassistant mastership in the Gottingen gymnasium in 1797. While there he\r\npublished his work _De pasigraphia sive scriptura universali_ (1799),\r\nwhich led to his appointment in 1803 as prorector of the gymnasium of\r\nFrankfort-on-Main, and shortly afterwards as conrector. Grotefend was\r\nbest known during his lifetime as a Latin and Italian philologist,\r\nthough the attention he paid to his own language is shown by his\r\n_Anfangsgrunde der deutschen Poesie_, published in 1815, and his\r\nfoundation of a society for investigating the German tongue in 1817. In\r\n1821 he became director of the gymnasium at Hanover, a post which he\r\nretained till his retirement in 1849. In 1823-1824 appeared his revised\r\nedition of Wenck's Latin grammar, in two volumes, followed by a smaller\r\ngrammar for the use of schools in 1826; in 1835-1838 a systematic\r\nattempt to explain the fragmentary remains of the Umbrian dialect,\r\nentitled _Rudimenta linguae Umbricae ex inscriptionibus antiquis\r\nenodata_ (in eight parts); and in 1839 a work of similar character upon\r\nOscan (_Rudimenta linguae Oscae_). In the same year he published an\r\nimportant memoir on the coins of Bactria, under the name of _Die Munzen\r\nder griechischen, parthischen, und indoskythischen Konige von Bactrien\r\nund den Landern am Indus_. He soon, however, returned to his favourite\r\nsubject, and brought out a work in five parts, _Zur Geographie und\r\nGeschichte von Altitalien_ (1840-1842). Previously, in 1836, he had\r\nwritten a preface to Wagenfeld's translation of the spurious\r\n_Sanchoniathon_ of Philo Byblius, which was alleged to have been\r\ndiscovered in the preceding year in the Portuguese convent of Santa\r\nMaria de Merinhao. But it was in the East rather than in the West that\r\nGrotefend did his greatest work. The cuneiform inscriptions of Persia\r\nhad for some time been attracting attention in Europe; exact copies of\r\nthem had been published by the elder Niebuhr, who lost his eyesight over\r\nthe work; and Grotefend's friend, Tychsen of Rostock, believed that he\r\nhad ascertained the characters in the column, now known to be Persian,\r\nto be alphabetic. At this point Grotefend took the matter up. His first\r\ndiscovery was communicated to the Royal Society of Gottingen in 1800,\r\nand reviewed by Tychsen two years afterwards. In 1815 he gave an account\r\nof it in Heeren's great work on ancient history, and in 1837 published\r\nhis _Neue Beitrage zur Erlauterung der persepolitanischen Keilschrift_.\r\nThree years later appeared his _Neue Beitrage zur Erlauterung der\r\nbabylonischen Keilschrift_. His discovery may be summed up as follows:\r\n(1) that the Persian inscriptions contain three different forms of\r\ncuneiform writing, so that the decipherment of the one would give the\r\nkey to the decipherment of the others; (2) that the characters of the\r\nPersian column are alphabetic and not syllabic; (3) that they must be\r\nread from left to right; (4) that the alphabet consists of forty\r\nletters, including signs for long and short vowels; and (5) that the\r\nPersepolitan inscriptions are written in Zend (which, however, is not\r\nthe case), and must be ascribed to the age of the Achaemenian princes.\r\nThe process whereby Grotefend arrived at these conclusions is a\r\nprominent illustration of persevering genius (see CUNEIFORM). A solid\r\nbasis had thus been laid for the interpretation of the Persian\r\ninscriptions, and all that remained was to work out the results of\r\nGrotefend's brilliant discovery, a task ably performed by Burnouf,\r\nLassen and Rawlinson. Grotefend died on the 15th of December 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROTESQUE, strictly a form of decorative art, in painting or sculpture,\r\nconsisting of fantastic shapes of human beings, animals and the like,\r\njoined together by wreaths of flowers, garlands or arabesques. The word\r\nis also applied to any whimsical design or decorative style, if\r\ncharacterized by unnatural distortion, and, generally, to anything\r\nludicrous or extravagantly fanciful. \"Grotesque\" comes through the\r\nFrench from the Ital. _grottesco_, an adjective formed from _grotta_,\r\nwhich has been corrupted in English to \"grotto.\" The commonly accepted\r\nexplanation of the special use of the term \"grotesque\" is that this\r\nparticular form of decorative art was most frequently found in the\r\nexcavated ancient Roman and Greek dwellings found in Italy, to which was\r\napplied the name _grotte_. The derivation of _grotta_ is through popular\r\nLat. _crupta_ or _grupta_ (cf. \"crypt\"), from Gr. [Greek: kypte], a\r\nvault, [Greek: kryptein], to hide. Such a term would be applicable both\r\nto the buried dwellings of ancient Italy, and to a cavern, artificial or\r\nnatural, the ordinary sense of the word. An interesting parallel with\r\nthis origin of the word is found in that of \"antic,\" now meaning a\r\nfreak, a jest, absurd fancy, &c. This word is the same as \"antique,\" and\r\nwas, like \"grotesque,\" first applied to the fanciful decorations of\r\nancient art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROTH, KLAUS (1819-1899), Low German poet, was born at Heide in\r\nSchleswig-Holstein, on the 24th of April 1819. After studying at the\r\nseminary in Tondern (1838-1841), he became a teacher at the girls'\r\nschool in his native village, but in 1847 went to Kiel to qualify for a\r\nhigher educational post. Ill-health interrupted his studies and it was\r\nnot until 1853 that he was able to resume them at Kiel. In 1856 he took\r\nthe degree of doctor of philosophy at Bonn, and in 1858 settled as\r\n_privatdocent_ in German literature and languages at Kiel, where, in\r\n1866, he was made professor, and where he lived until his death on the\r\n1st of June 1899. In his Low German (_Plattdeutsch_) lyric and epic\r\npoems, which reflect the influence of Johann Peter Hebel (q.v.), Groth\r\ngives poetic expression to the country life of his northern home; and\r\nthough his descriptions may not always reflect the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of the peasantry of Holstein as faithfully as those of\r\nF. Reuter (q.v.), yet Groth is a lyric poet of genuine inspiration. His\r\nchief works are _Quickborn, Volksleben in plattdeutschen Gedichten\r\nDitmarscher Mundart_ (1852; 25th ed. 1900; and in High German\r\ntranslations, notably by M. J. Berchem, Krefeld, 1896); and two volumes\r\nof stories, _Vertelln_ (1855-1859, 3rd ed. 1881); also _Voer de Goern_\r\n(1858) and _Ut min Jungsparadies_ (1875).\r\n\r\n  Groth's _Gesammelte Werke_ appeared in 4 vols. (1893). His\r\n  _Lebenserinnerungen_ were edited by E. Wolff in 1891; see also K.\r\n  Eggers, _K. Groth und die plattdeutsche Dichtung_ (1885); and\r\n  biographies by A. Bartels (1899) and H. Siercks (1899.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROTH, PAUL HEINRICH VON (1843-   ), German mineralogist, was born at\r\nMagdeburg on the 23rd of June 1843. He was educated at Freiberg, Dresden\r\nand Berlin, and took the degree of Ph.D. in 1868. After holding from\r\n1872 the chair of mineralogy at Strasburg, he was in 1883 appointed\r\nprofessor of mineralogy and curator of minerals in the state museum at\r\nMunich. He carried on extensive researches on crystals and minerals, and\r\nalso on rocks; and published _Tabellarische Ubersicht der einfachen\r\nMineralien_ (1874-1898), and _Physikalische Krystallographie_\r\n(1876-1895, ed. 4, 1905). He edited for some years the _Zeitschrift fur\r\nKrystallographie und Mineralogie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROTIUS, HUGO (1583-1645), in his native country Huig van Groot, but\r\nknown to the rest of Europe by the latinized form of the name, Dutch\r\npublicist and statesman, was born at Delft on Easter day, the 10th of\r\nApril 1583. The Groots were a branch of a family of distinction, which\r\nhad been noble in France, but had removed to the Low Countries more than\r\na century before. Their French name was de Cornets, and this cadet\r\nbranch had taken the name of Groot on the marriage of Hugo's\r\ngreat-grandfather with a Dutch heiress. The father of Hugo was a lawyer\r\nin considerable practice, who had four times served the office of\r\nburgomaster of Leiden, and was one of the three curators of the\r\nuniversity of that place.\r\n\r\nIn the annals of precocious genius there is no greater prodigy on record\r\nthan Hugo Grotius, who was able to make good Latin verses at nine, was\r\nripe for the university at twelve, and at fifteen edited the\r\nencyclopaedic work of Martianus Capella. At Leiden he was much noticed\r\nby J. J. Scaliger, whose habit it was to engage his young friends in the\r\nediting of some classical text. At fifteen Grotius accompanied Count\r\nJustin of Nassau, and the grand pensionary J. van Olden Barneveldt on\r\ntheir special embassy to the court of France. After a year spent in\r\nacquiring the language and making acquaintance with the leading men of\r\nFrance, Grotius returned home. He took the degree of doctor of law at\r\nLeiden, and entered on practice as an advocate.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his successes in his profession, his inclination was to\r\nliterature. In 1600 he edited the remains of Aratus, with the versions\r\nof Cicero, Germanicus and Avienus. Of the _Germanicus_ Scaliger says--\"A\r\nbetter text than that which Grotius has given, it is impossible to\r\ngive\"; but it is probable that Scaliger had himself been the reviser.\r\nGrotius vied with the Latinists of his day in the composition of Latin\r\nverses. Some lines on the siege of Ostend spread his fame beyond the\r\ncircle of the learned. He wrote three dramas in Latin:--_Christus\r\npatiens; Sophomphaneas_, on the story of Joseph and his brethren; and\r\n_Adamus exul_, a production still remembered as having given hints to\r\nMilton. The _Sophomphaneas_ was translated into Dutch by Vondel, and\r\ninto English by Francis Goldsmith (1652); the _Christus patiens_ into\r\nEnglish by George Sandys (1640).\r\n\r\nIn 1603 the United Provinces, desiring to transmit to posterity some\r\naccount of their struggle with Spain, determined to appoint a\r\nhistoriographer. The choice of the states fell upon Grotius, though he\r\nwas but twenty years of age, and had not offered himself for the post.\r\nThere was some talk at this time in Paris of calling Grotius to be\r\nlibrarian of the royal library. But it was a ruse of the Jesuit party,\r\nwho wished to persuade the public that the opposition to the appointment\r\nof Isaac Casaubon did not proceed from theological motives, since they\r\nwere ready to appoint a Protestant in the person of Grotius.\r\n\r\nHis next preferment was that of advocate-general of the fisc for the\r\nprovinces of Holland and Zeeland. This was followed by his marriage, in\r\n1608, to Marie Reigersberg, a lady of family in Zeeland, a woman of\r\ngreat capacity and noble disposition.\r\n\r\nGrotius had already passed from occupation with the classics to studies\r\nmore immediately connected with his profession. In the winter of 1604 he\r\ncomposed (but did not publish) a treatise entitled _De jure praedae_.\r\nThe MS. remained unknown till 1868, when it was brought to light, and\r\nprinted at the Hague under the auspices of Professor Fruin. It shows\r\nthat the principles and the plan of the celebrated _De jure belli_,\r\nwhich was not composed till 1625, more than twenty years after, had\r\nalready been conceived by a youth of twenty-one. It has always been a\r\nquestion what it was that determined Grotius, when an exile in Paris in\r\n1625, to that particular subject, and various explanations have been\r\noffered; among others a casual suggestion of Peiresc in a letter of\r\nearly date. The discovery of the MS. of the _De jure praedae_ discloses\r\nthe whole history of Grotius's ideas, and shows that from youth upwards\r\nhe had steadily read and meditated in one direction, that, namely, of\r\nwhich the famous _De jure belli_ was the mature product. In the _De jure\r\npraedae_ of 1604 there is much more than the germ of the later treatise\r\n_De jure belli_. Its main principles, and the whole system of thought\r\nimplied in the later, are anticipated in the earlier work. The\r\narrangement even is the same. The chief difference between the two\r\ntreatises is one which twenty years' experience in affairs could not but\r\nbring--the substitution of more cautious and guarded language, less\r\ndogmatic affirmation, more allowance for exceptions and deviations. The\r\n_Jus pacis_ was an addition introduced first in the later work, an\r\ninsertion which is the cause of not a little of the confused arrangement\r\nwhich has been found fault with in the _De jure belli_.\r\n\r\nThe _De jure praedae_ further demonstrates that Grotius was originally\r\ndetermined to this subject, not by any speculative intellectual\r\ninterest, but by a special occasion presented by his professional\r\nengagements. He was retained by the Dutch East India Company as their\r\nadvocate. One of their captains, Heemskirk, had captured a rich\r\nPortuguese galleon in the Straits of Malacca. The right of a private\r\ncompany to make prizes was hotly contested in Holland, and denied by the\r\nstricter religionists, especially the Mennonites, who considered all war\r\nunlawful. Grotius undertook to prove that Heemskirk's prize had been\r\nlawfully captured. In doing this he was led to investigate the grounds\r\nof the lawfulness of war in general. Such was the casual origin of a\r\nbook which long enjoyed such celebrity that it used to be said, with\r\nsome exaggeration indeed, that it had founded a new science.\r\n\r\nA short treatise which was printed in 1609, Grotius says without his\r\npermission, under the title of _Mare liberum_, is nothing more than a\r\nchapter--the 12th--of the _De jure praedae_. It was necessary to\r\nGrotius's defence of Heemskirk that he should show that the Portuguese\r\npretence that Eastern waters were their private property was untenable.\r\nGrotius maintains that the ocean is free to all nations. The occasional\r\ncharacter of this piece explains the fact that at the time of its\r\nappearance it made no sensation. It was not till many years afterwards\r\nthat the jealousies between England and Holland gave importance to the\r\nnovel doctrine broached in the tract by Grotius, a doctrine which Selden\r\nset himself to refute in his _Mare clausum_ (1632).\r\n\r\nEqually due to the circumstances of the time was his small contribution\r\nto constitutional history entitled _De antiquitate reipublicae Batavae_\r\n(1610). In this he vindicates, on grounds of right, prescriptive and\r\nnatural, the revolt of the United Provinces against the sovereignty of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nGrotius, when he was only thirty, was made pensionary of the city of\r\nRotterdam. In 1613 he formed one of a deputation to England, in an\r\nattempt to adjust those differences which gave rise afterwards to a\r\nnaval struggle disastrous to Holland. He was received by James with\r\nevery mark of distinction. He also cultivated the acquaintance of the\r\nAnglican ecclesiastics John Overall and L. Andrewes, and was much in the\r\nsociety of the celebrated scholar Isaac Casaubon, with whom he had been\r\nin correspondence by letter for many years. Though the mediating views\r\nin the great religious conflict between Catholic and Protestant, by\r\nwhich Grotius was afterwards known, had been arrived at by him by\r\nindependent reflection, yet it could not but be that he would be\r\nconfirmed in them by finding in England a developed school of thought of\r\nthe same character already in existence. How highly Casaubon esteemed\r\nGrotius appears from a letter of his to Daniel Heinsius, dated London,\r\n13th of April 1613. \"I cannot say how happy I esteem myself in having\r\nseen so much of one so truly great as Grotius. A wonderful man! This I\r\nknew him to be before I had seen him; but the rare excellence of that\r\ndivine genius no one can sufficiently feel who does not see his face,\r\nand hear him speak. Probity is stamped on his features; his conversation\r\nsavours of true piety and profound learning. It is not only upon me that\r\nhe has made this impression; all the pious and learned to whom he has\r\nbeen here introduced have felt the same towards him; the king especially\r\nso!\"\r\n\r\nAfter Grotius's return from England the exasperation of theological\r\nparties in Holland rose to such a pitch that it became clear that an\r\nappeal to force would be made. Grotius sought to find some mean term in\r\nwhich the two hostile parties of Remonstrants and Anti-remonstrants, or\r\nas they were subsequently called Arminians and Gomarists (see\r\nRemonstrants), might agree. A form of edict drawn by Grotius was\r\npublished by the states, recommending mutual toleration, and forbidding\r\nministers in the pulpit from handling the disputed dogmas. To the\r\northodox Calvinists the word toleration was insupportable. They had the\r\npopulace on their side. This fact determined the stadtholder, Maurice of\r\nNassau, to support the orthodox party--a party to which he inclined the\r\nmore readily that Olden Barneveldt, the grand pensionary, the man whose\r\nuprightness and abilities he most dreaded, sided with the Remonstrants.\r\n\r\nIn 1618 Prince Maurice set out on a sort of pacific campaign, disbanding\r\nthe civic guards in the various cities of Guelders, Holland and Zeeland,\r\nand occupying the places with troops on whom he could rely. The states\r\nof Holland sent a commission, of which Grotius was chairman, to Utrecht,\r\nwith the view of strengthening the hands of their friends, the\r\nRemonstrant party, in that city. Feeble plans were formed, but not\r\ncarried into effect, for shutting the gates upon the stadtholder, who\r\nentered the city with troops on the night of the 26th of July 1618.\r\nThere were conferences in which Grotius met Prince Maurice, and taught\r\nhim that Olden Barneveldt was not the only man of capacity in the ranks\r\nof the Remonstrants whom he had to fear. On the early morning of the\r\n31st of July the prince's _coup d'etat_ against the liberties of Utrecht\r\nand of Holland was carried out; the civic guard was disarmed--Grotius\r\nand his colleagues saving themselves by a precipitate flight. But it was\r\nonly a reprieve. The grand pensionary, Olden Barneveldt, the leader of\r\nthe Remonstrant party, Grotius and Hoogerbeets were arrested, brought to\r\ntrial, and condemned--Olden Barneveldt to death, and Grotius to\r\nimprisonment for life and confiscation of his property. In June 1619 he\r\nwas immured in the fortress of Louvestein near Gorcum. His confinement\r\nwas rigorous, but after a time his wife obtained permission to share his\r\ncaptivity, on the condition that if she came out, she should not be\r\nsuffered to return.\r\n\r\nGrotius had now before him, at thirty-six, no prospect but that of a\r\nlife-long captivity. He did not abandon himself to despair, but sought\r\nrefuge in returning to the classical pursuits of his youth. Several of\r\nhis translations (into Latin) from the Greek tragedians and other\r\nwriters, made at this time, have been printed. \"The Muses,\" he writes to\r\nVoss, \"were now his consolation, and appeared more amiable than ever.\"\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity of Madame Grotius at length devised a mode of escape. It\r\nhad grown into a custom to send the books which he had done with in a\r\nchest along with his linen to be washed at Gorcum. After a time the\r\nwarders began to let the chest pass without opening it. Madame Grotius,\r\nperceiving this, prevailed on her husband to allow himself to be shut up\r\nin it at the usual time. The two soldiers who carried the chest out\r\ncomplained that it was so heavy \"there must be an Arminian in it.\"\r\n\"There are indeed,\" said Madame Grotius, \"Arminian books in it.\" The\r\nchest was carried to the house of a friend, where Grotius was released.\r\nHe was then dressed like a mason with hod and trowel, and so conveyed\r\nover the frontier. His first place of refuge was Antwerp, from which he\r\nproceeded to Paris, where he arrived in April 1621. In October he was\r\njoined by his wife. There he was presented to the king, Louis XIII., and\r\na pension of 3000 livres conferred upon him. French pensions were easily\r\ngranted, all the more so as they were never paid. Grotius was now\r\nreduced to great straits. He looked about for any opening through which\r\nhe might earn a living. There was talk of something in Denmark; or he\r\nwould settle in Spires, and practise in the court there. Some little\r\nrelief he got through the intervention of Etienne d'Aligre, the\r\nchancellor, who procured a royal mandate which enabled Grotius to draw,\r\nnot all, but a large part of his pension. In 1623 the president Henri de\r\nMeme lent him his chateau of Balagni near Senlis (dep. Oise), and there\r\nGrotius passed the spring and summer of that year. De Thou gave him\r\nfacilities to borrow books from the superb library formed by his father.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the _De jure belli et pacis_ was composed. That a\r\nwork of such immense reading, consisting in great part of quotation,\r\nshould have been written in little more than a year was a source of\r\nastonishment to his biographers. The achievement would have been\r\nimpossible, but for the fact that Grotius had with him the first draft\r\nof the work made in 1604. He had also got his brother William, when\r\nreading his classics, to mark down all the passages which touched upon\r\nlaw, public or private. In March 1625 the printing of the _De jure\r\nbelli_, which had taken four months, was completed, and the edition\r\ndespatched to the fair at Frankfort. His own honorarium as author\r\nconsisted of 200 copies, of which, however, he had to give away many to\r\nfriends, to the king, the principal courtiers, the papal nuncio, &c.\r\nWhat remained he sold for his own profit at the price of a crown each,\r\nbut the sale did not recoup him his outlay. But though his book brought\r\nhim no profit it brought him reputation, so widely spread, and of such\r\nlong endurance, as no other legal treatise has ever enjoyed.\r\n\r\nGrotius hoped that his fame would soften the hostility of his foes, and\r\nthat his country would recall him to her service. Theological rancour,\r\nhowever, prevailed over all other sentiments, and, after fruitless\r\nattempts to re-establish himself in Holland, Grotius accepted service\r\nunder Sweden, in the capacity of ambassador to France. He was not very\r\nsuccessful in negotiating the treaty on behalf of the Protestant\r\ninterest in Germany, Richelieu having a special dislike to him. He never\r\nenjoyed the confidence of the court to which he was accredited, and\r\nfrittered away his influence in disputes about precedence. In 1645 he\r\ndemanded and obtained his recall. He was honourably received at\r\nStockholm, but neither the climate nor the tone of the court suited him,\r\nand he asked permission to leave. He was driven by a storm on the coast\r\nnear Dantzig. He got as far as Rostock, where he found himself very ill.\r\nStockman, a Scottish physician who was sent for, thought it was only\r\nweakness, and that rest would restore the patient. But Grotius sank\r\nrapidly, and died on the 29th of August 1645.\r\n\r\nGrotius combined a wide circle of general knowledge with a profound\r\nstudy of one branch of law. History, theology, jurisprudence, politics,\r\nclassics, poetry,--all these fields he cultivated. His commentaries on\r\nthe Scriptures were the first application on an extensive scale of the\r\nprinciple affirmed by Scaliger, that, namely, of interpretation by the\r\nrules of grammar without dogmatic assumptions. Grotius's philological\r\nskill, however, was not sufficient to enable him to work up to this\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nAs in many other points Grotius inevitably recalls Erasmus, so he does\r\nin his attitude towards the great schism. Grotius was, however, animated\r\nby an ardent desire for peace and concord. He thought that a basis for\r\nreconciliation of Protestant and Catholic might be found in a common\r\npiety, combined with reticence upon discrepancies of doctrinal\r\nstatement. His _De veritate religionis Christianae_ (1627), a\r\npresentment of the evidences, is so written as to form a code of common\r\nChristianity, irrespective of sect. The little treatise became widely\r\npopular, gaining rather than losing popularity in the 18th century. It\r\nbecame the classical manual of apologetics in Protestant colleges, and\r\nwas translated for missionary purposes into Arabic (by Pococke, 1660),\r\nPersian, Chinese, &c. His _Via et votum ad pacem ecclesiasticam_ (1642)\r\nwas a detailed proposal of a scheme of accommodation. Like all men of\r\nmoderate and mediating views, he was charged by both sides with\r\nvacillation. An Amsterdam minister, James Laurent, published his\r\n_Grotius papizans_ (1642), and it was continually being announced from\r\nParis that Grotius had \"gone over.\" Hallam, who has collected all the\r\npassages from Grotius's letters in which the prejudices and narrow\r\ntenets of the Reformed clergy are condemned, thought he had a \"bias\r\ntowards popery\" (_Lit. of Europe_, ii. 312). The true interpretation of\r\nGrotius's mind appears to be an indifference to dogmatic propositions,\r\nproduced by a profound sentiment of piety. He approached parties as a\r\nstatesman approaches them, as facts which have to be dealt with, and\r\ngoverned, not suppressed in the interests of some one of their number.\r\n\r\nHis editions and translations of the classics were either juvenile\r\nexercises prescribed by Scaliger, or \"lusus poetici,\" the amusement of\r\nvacant hours. Grotius read the classics as a humanist, for the sake of\r\ntheir contents, not as a professional scholar.\r\n\r\nHis _Annals of the Low Countries_ was begun as an official duty while he\r\nheld the appointment of historiographer, and was being continued and\r\nretouched by him to the last. It was not published till 1657, by his\r\nsons Peter and Cornelius.\r\n\r\nGrotius was a great jurist, and his _De jure belli et pacis_ (Paris,\r\n1625), though not the first attempt in modern times to ascertain the\r\nprinciples of jurisprudence, went far more fundamentally into the\r\ndiscussion than any one had done before him. The title of the work was\r\nso far misleading that the _jus belli_ was a very small part of his\r\ncomprehensive scheme. In his treatment of this narrower question he had\r\nthe works of Alberico Gentili and Ayala before him, and has acknowledged\r\nhis obligations to them. But it is in the larger questions to which he\r\nopened the way that the merit of Grotius consists. His was the first\r\nattempt to obtain a principle of right, and a basis for society and\r\ngovernment, outside the church or the Bible. The distinction between\r\nreligion on the one hand and law and morality on the other is not indeed\r\nclearly conceived by Grotius, but he wrestles with it in such a way as\r\nto make it easy for those who followed him to seize it. The law of\r\nnature is unalterable; God Himself cannot alter it any more than He can\r\nalter a mathematical axiom. This law has its source in the nature of man\r\nas a social being; it would be valid even were there no God, or if God\r\ndid not interfere in the government of the world. These positions,\r\nthough Grotius's religious temper did not allow him to rely unreservedly\r\nupon them, yet, even in the partial application they find in his book,\r\nentitle him to the honour of being held the founder of the modern\r\nscience of the law of nature and nations. The _De jure_ exerted little\r\ninfluence on the practice of belligerents, yet its publication was an\r\nepoch in the science. De Quincey has said that the book is equally\r\ndivided between \"empty truisms and time-serving Dutch falsehoods.\" For a\r\nsaner judgment and a brief abstract of the contents of the _De jure_,\r\nconsult J. K. Bluntschli, _Geschichte des allgemeinen Staatsrechts_\r\n(Munich, 1864). A fuller analysis, and some notice of the predecessors\r\nof Grotius, will be found in Hely, _Etude sur le droit de la guerre de\r\nGrotius_ (Paris, 1875). The writer, however, had never heard of the _De\r\njure praedae_, published in 1868. Hallam, _Lit. of Europe_, ii. p. 543,\r\nhas an abstract done with his usual conscientious pains. Dugald Stewart\r\n(_Collected Works_, i. 370) has dwelt upon the confusion and defects of\r\nGrotius's theory. Sir James Mackintosh (_Miscell. Works_, p. 166) has\r\ndefended Grotius, affirming that his work \"is perhaps the most complete\r\nthat the world has yet owed, at so early a stage in the progress of any\r\nscience, to the genius and learning of one man.\"\r\n\r\n  The chief writings of Grotius have been named. For a complete\r\n  bibliography of his works, see Lehmann, _Hugonis Grotii manes\r\n  vindicati_ (Delft, 1727), which also contains a full biography. Of\r\n  this Latin life De Burigny published a rechauffee in French (2 vols.,\r\n  8vo, Paris, 1752). Other lives are: Van Brandt, _Historie van het\r\n  Leven H. de Groot_ (2 vols., 8vo, Dordrecht, 1727); Von Luden, _Hugo\r\n  Grotius nach seinen Schicksalen und Schriften dargestellt_ (8vo,\r\n  Berlin, 1806); _Life of Hugo Grotius_, by Charles Butler of Lincoln's\r\n  Inn (8vo, London, 1826). The work of the Abbe Hely contains a life of\r\n  Grotius. See also _Hugo Grotius_, by L. Neumann (Berlin, 1884);\r\n  _Opinions of Grotius_, by D. P. de Bruyn (London, 1894).\r\n\r\n  Grotius's theological works were collected in 3 vols. fol. at\r\n  Amsterdam (1644-1646; reprinted London, 1660; Amsterdam, 1679; and\r\n  again Amsterdam, 1698). His letters were printed first in a selection,\r\n  _Epistolae ad Gallos_ (12mo, Leiden, 1648), abounding, though an\r\n  Elzevir, in errors of the press. They were collected in _H. Grotii\r\n  epistolae quotquot reperiri poluerunt_ (fol., Amsterdam, 1687). A few\r\n  may be found scattered in other collections of _Epistolae_.\r\n  Supplements to the large collection of 1687 were published at Haarlem,\r\n  1806; Leiden, 1809; and Haarlem, 1829. The _De jure belli_ was\r\n  translated into English by Whewell (3 vols., 8vo, Cambridge, 1853);\r\n  into French by Barbeyrac (2 vols. 4to, Amsterdam, 1724); into German\r\n  in Kirchmann's _Philosophische Bibliothek_ (3 vols. 12mo, Leipzig,\r\n  1879).

It was fortified at the end of the\r\n15th century by Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere (afterwards Pope Julius\r\nII.), whose arms may be seen about it. The massive towers added by him\r\ngive it a picturesque appearance. The church belongs to the 12th\r\ncentury, and the original portal, with a mosaic over it, is still\r\npreserved; the interior was restored in 1574 and in 1754, but there are\r\nsome remains of frescoes of the 13th century. The chapel of S. Nilus\r\ncontains frescoes by Domenico Zampieri (Domenichino) of 1610,\r\nillustrating the life of the saint, which are among his most important\r\nworks. The abbot's palace has a fine Renaissance portico, and contains\r\nan interesting museum of local antiquities. The library contains\r\nvaluable MSS., among them one from the hand of S. Nilus (965); and a\r\npalaeographical school, for the copying of MSS. in the ancient style, is\r\nmaintained. An _omophorion_ of the 11th or 12th century, with scenes\r\nfrom the Gospel in needlework, and a chalice of the 15th century with\r\nenamels, given by Cardinal Bessarion, the predecessor of Giuliano della\r\nRovere as commendatory of the abbey, are among its treasures. An\r\nimportant exhibition of Italo-Byzantine art was held here in 1905-1906.\r\n\r\n  See A. Rocchi, _La Badia di Grottaferrata_ (Rome, 1884); A. Munoz,\r\n  _L'Art byzantin a l'exposition de Grottaferrata_ (Rome, 1905); T.\r\n  Ashby in _Papers of the British School at Rome_, iv. (1907).\r\n       (T. As.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUCHY, EMMANUEL, MARQUIS DE (1766-1847), marshal of France, was born\r\nin Paris on the 23rd of October 1766. He entered the French artillery in\r\n1779, transferred to the cavalry in 1782, and to the _Gardes du corps_\r\nin 1786. In spite of his aristocratic birth and his connexions with the\r\ncourt, he was a convinced supporter of the principles of the Revolution,\r\nand had in consequence to leave the Guards. About the time of the\r\noutbreak of war in 1792 he became colonel of a cavalry regiment, and\r\nsoon afterwards, as a _marechal de camp_, he was sent to serve on the\r\nsouth-eastern frontier. In 1793 he distinguished himself in La Vendee,\r\nand was promoted general of division. Grouchy was shortly afterwards\r\ndeprived of his rank as being of noble birth, but in 1795 he was again\r\nplaced on the active list. He served on the staff of the Army of Ireland\r\n(1796-1797), and took a conspicuous part in the Irish expedition. In\r\n1798 he administered the civil and military government of Piedmont at\r\nthe time of the abdication of the king of Sardinia, and in 1799 he\r\ndistinguished himself greatly as a divisional commander in the campaign\r\nagainst the Austrians and Russians. In covering the retreat of the\r\nFrench after the defeat of Novi, Grouchy received fourteen wounds and\r\nwas taken prisoner. On his release he returned to France. In spite of\r\nhis having protested against the _coup d'etat_ of the 18th of Brumaire\r\nhe was at once re-employed by the First Consul, and distinguished\r\nhimself again at Hohenlinden. It was not long before he accepted the new\r\nregime in France, and from 1801 onwards he was employed by Napoleon in\r\nmilitary and political positions of importance. He served in Austria in\r\n1805, in Prussia in 1806, Poland in 1807, Spain in 1808, and commanded\r\nthe cavalry of the Army of Italy in 1809 in the Viceroy Eugene's advance\r\nto Vienna. In 1812 he was made commander of one of the four cavalry\r\ncorps of the Grand Army, and during the retreat from Moscow Napoleon\r\nappointed him to command the escort squadron, which was composed\r\nentirely of picked officers. His almost continuous service with the\r\ncavalry led Napoleon to decline in 1813 to place Grouchy at the head of\r\nan army corps, and Grouchy thereupon retired to France. In 1814,\r\nhowever, he hastened to take part in the defensive campaign in France,\r\nand he was severely wounded at Craonne. At the Restoration he was\r\ndeprived of the post of colonel-general of _chasseurs a cheval_ and\r\nretired. He joined Napoleon on his return from Elba, and was made\r\nmarshal and peer of France. In the campaign of Waterloo he commanded the\r\nreserve cavalry of the army, and after Ligny he was appointed to command\r\nthe right wing to pursue the Prussians. The march on Wavre, its\r\ninfluence on the result of the campaign, and the controversy to which\r\nGrouchy's conduct on the day of Waterloo has given rise, are dealt with\r\nbriefly in the article WATERLOO CAMPAIGN, and at length in nearly every\r\nwork on the campaign of 1815. Here it is only necessary to say that on\r\nthe 17th Grouchy was unable to close with the Prussians, and on the\r\n18th, though urged to march towards the sound of the guns of Waterloo,\r\nhe permitted himself, from whatever cause, to be held up by a Prussian\r\nrearguard while the Prussians and English united to crush Napoleon. On\r\nthe 19th Grouchy won a smart victory over the Prussians at Wavre, but it\r\nwas then too late. So far as resistance was possible after the great\r\ndisaster, Grouchy made it. He gathered up the wrecks of Napoleon's army,\r\nand retired, swiftly and unbroken, to Paris, where, after interposing\r\nhis reorganized forces between the enemy and the capital, he resigned\r\nhis command into the hands of Marshal Davout. The rest of his life was\r\nspent in defending himself. An attempt to have him condemned to death by\r\na court-martial failed, but he was exiled and lived in America till\r\namnestied in 1821. On his return to France he was reinstated as general,\r\nbut not as marshal nor as peer of France. For many years thereafter he\r\nwas equally an object of aversion to the court party, as a member of\r\ntheir own caste who had followed the Revolution and Napoleon, and to his\r\ncomrades of the Grand Army as the supposed betrayer of Napoleon. In 1830\r\nLouis Philippe gave him back the marshal's baton and restored him to the\r\nChamber of Peers. He died at St-Etienne on the 29th of May 1847.\r\n\r\n  See Marquis de Grouchy, _Memoires du marechal Marquis de Grouchy_\r\n  (Paris, 1873-1874); General Marquis de Grouchy, _Le General Grouchy en\r\n  Irlande_ (Paris, 1866), and _Le Marechal Grouchy du 16 au 18 juin,\r\n  1815_ (Paris, 1864); _Appel a l'histoire sur les faites de l'aile\r\n  droite de l'armee francaise_ (Paris, n.d.); _Severe Justice sur les\r\n  faits ... du 28 juin au 3 juillet, 1815_ (Paris, 1866); and the\r\n  literature of the Waterloo campaign. Marshal Grouchy himself wrote the\r\n  following: _Observations sur la relation de la campagne de 1815 par le\r\n  general de Gourgaud_ (Philadelphia and Paris, 1818); _Refutation de\r\n  quelques articles des memoires de M. le Duc de Rovigo_ (Paris, 1829);\r\n  _Fragments historiques relatifs a la campagne et a la bataille de\r\n  Waterloo_ (Paris, 1829-1830, in reply to Barthelemy and Mery, and to\r\n  Marshal Gerard); _Reclamation du marechal de Grouchy_ (Paris, 1834);\r\n  _Plainte contre le general Baron Berthezene_ (Berthezene, formerly a\r\n  divisional commander under Gerard, stated in reply to this defence\r\n  that he had no intention of accusing Grouchy of ill faith).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUND-ICE,[1] ice formed at the bottom of streams while the temperature\r\nof the water is above freezing-point. Everything points to radiation as\r\nthe prime cause of the formation of ground-ice. It is formed only under\r\na clear sky, never in cloudy weather; it is most readily formed on dark\r\nrocks, and never under any covering such as a bridge, and rarely under\r\nsurface-ice. Professor Howard T. Barnes of McGill University concludes\r\nthat the radiation from a river bed in cold and clear nights goes\r\nthrough the water in long rays that penetrate much more easily from\r\nbelow upwards than the sun's heat rays from above downwards, which are\r\nmostly absorbed by the first few feet of water. On a cold clear night,\r\ntherefore, the radiation from the bottom is excessive, and loosely-grown\r\nspongy masses of anchor-ice form on the bottom, which on the following\r\nbright sunny day receive just sufficient heat from the sun to detach the\r\nmass of ice, which rises to the surface with considerable force. It is\r\nprobable that owing to surface tension a thin film of stationary water\r\nrests upon the boulders and sand over which a stream flows, and that\r\nthis, becoming frozen owing to radiation, forms the foundation for the\r\nanchor-ice and produces a surface upon which the descending frazil-ice\r\n(see below) can lodge. The theory of radiation from the boulders is\r\nsupported by the fact that as the ice is formed upon them in response to\r\na sudden fall in the air temperature, it is only released under the\r\ninfluence of a strong rise of temperature during the morning. It may not\r\nrise for several days, but the advent of bright sunlight is followed by\r\nthe appearance on the surface of masses of ground-ice. This ice has a\r\nspongy texture and frequently carries gravel with it when it rises. It\r\nis said that the bottom of Lake Erie is strewn with gravel that has been\r\nfloated down in this way. This \"anchor-ice,\" as it was called by\r\nCanadian trappers, frequently forms dams across narrow portions of the\r\nriver where the floating masses are caught. Dr H. Landor pointed out\r\nthat the Mackenzie and Mississippi rivers, which rise in the same region\r\nand flow in opposite directions, carry ground-ice from their head-waters\r\nfor a considerable distance down stream, and suggested that here and in\r\nSiberia many forms of vegetable and animal life may be distributed from\r\na centre by this agency, since the material carried by the floating ice\r\nwould contain the seeds and eggs or larvae of many forms.\r\n\r\nBesides ground-ice and anchor-ice this formation is called also\r\nbottom-ice, ground-gru and lappered ice, the two last names being\r\nScottish. In France it is called _glace du fond_, in Germany _Grundeis_,\r\nand in French Canada _moutonne_ from the appearance of sheep at rest,\r\nsince the ice formed at the bottom grows in woolly, spongy masses upon\r\nboulders or other projections.\r\n\r\n\"Frazil-ice\" is a Canadian term from the French for \"forge-cinders.\" It\r\nis surface ice formed in spicules and carried downwards in water\r\nagitated by winds or rapids. The frazil-ice may render swiftly moving\r\nwater turbid with ice crystals, it may be swirled downwards and\r\naccumulated upon the ground ice, or it may be swept under the sheet of\r\nsurface-ice, coating the under surface of the sheet to a thickness as\r\ngreat as 80 ft. of loose spicular ice.\r\n\r\n  See W. G. Thompson, in _Nature_, i. 555 (1870); H. Landor, in\r\n  _Geological Magazine_, decade II., vol. iii., p. 459 (1876); H.

Eng. word _grund_, ground, is common to Teutonic\r\n    languages, cf. Du. _grond_, Ger. _Grund_, but has no cognates outside\r\n    Teutonic. The suggestion that the origin is to be found in \"grind,\"\r\n    to crush small, reduce to powder, is plausible, but the primary\r\n    meaning seems to be the lowest part or bottom of anything rather than\r\n    grit, sand or gravel. The main branches in sense appear to be, first,\r\n    bottom, as of the sea or a river, cf. the use, in the plural, for\r\n    dregs; second, base or foundation, actual, as of the first or main\r\n    surface of a painting, fabric, &c., or figurative, as of a principle\r\n    or reason; third, the surface of the earth, or a particular part of\r\n    that surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUND NUT (Earth Nut, Pistache de Terre, Monkey Nut, Pea Nut, Manilla\r\nNut), in botany, the fruit or pod of _Arachis hypogaea_ (nat. ord.\r\nLeguminosae). The plant is an annual of diffuse habit, with hairy stem,\r\nand two-paired, abruptly pinnate leaflets. The pods or legumes are\r\nstalked, oblong, cylindrical, about 1 in. in length, the thin\r\nreticulated shell containing one or two irregularly ovoid seeds. After\r\nthe flower withers, the stalk of the ovary has the peculiarity of\r\nelongating and bending down, forcing the young pod underground, and thus\r\nthe seeds become matured at some distance below the surface. Hence the\r\nspecific and vernacular names of the plant. Originally a native of South\r\nAmerica, it is extensively cultivated in all tropical and subtropical\r\ncountries. The plant affects a light sandy soil, and is very prolific,\r\nyielding in some instances 30 to 38 bushels of nuts per acre. The pods\r\nwhen ripe are dug up and dried. The seeds when fresh are largely eaten\r\nin tropical countries, and in taste are almost equal to almonds; when\r\nroasted they are used as a substitute for chocolate. In America they are\r\nconsumed in large quantities as the \"pea-nut\"; but are not much\r\nappreciated in England except by the poorer children, who know them as\r\n\"monkey-nuts.\" By expression the seeds yield a large quantity of oil,\r\nwhich is used by natives for lamps, as a fish or curry oil and for\r\nmedicinal purposes. The leaves form an excellent food for cattle, being\r\nvery like clover.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of seeds are imported to Europe, chiefly to Marseilles,\r\nLondon and Hamburg, for the sake of their contained oil. The seeds yield\r\nfrom 42 to 50% of oil by cold expression, but a larger quantity is\r\nobtained by heat, although of an inferior quality. The seeds being soft\r\nfacilitate mechanical expression, and where bisulphide of carbon or\r\nother solvent is used, a very pure oil is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe expressed oil is limpid, of a light yellowish or straw colour,\r\nhaving a faint smell and bland taste; it forms an excellent substitute\r\nfor olive oil, although in a slight degree more prone to rancidity than\r\nthe latter. Its specific gravity is 0.916 to 0.918; it becomes turbid at\r\n3 deg. C., concretes at +3 deg. to -4 deg. C., and hardens at +7 deg. C.\r\nIt is a non-drying oil. Ground nut oil consists of (1) oleic acid\r\n(C18H34O2); (2) hypogaeic acid (C16H30O2), by some supposed to be\r\nidentical with a fatty acid found in whale oil; (3) palmitic acid\r\n(C16H32O2); and (4) arachic acid (C20H40O2). The oil is used in the\r\nadulteration of gingelly oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUND-PEARL, the glassy secretion forming the pupacase of coccid\r\ninsects of the genus _Margarodes_, belonging to the homopterous division\r\nof the Hemiptera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUND RENT. In Roman law, ground rent (_solarium_) was an annual rent\r\npayable by the lessee of a _superficies_ or perpetual lease of building\r\nland. In English law, it appears that the term was at one time popularly\r\nused for the houses and lands out of which ground rents issue as well as\r\nfor the rents themselves (cf. _Maundy_ v. _Maundy_, 2 Strange, 1020);\r\nand Lord Eldon observed in 1815 that the context in which the term\r\noccurred may materially vary its meaning (_Stewart_ v. _Alliston_, 1\r\nMer. 26). But at the present time the accepted meaning of ground rent is\r\nthe rent at which land is let for the purpose of improvement by\r\nbuilding, i.e. a rent charged in respect of the land only and not in\r\nrespect of the buildings to be placed thereon. It thus conveys the idea\r\nof something lower than a rack rent (see RENT); and accordingly if a\r\nvendor described property as property for which he paid a \"ground rent,\"\r\nwithout any further explanation of the term, a purchaser would not be\r\nobliged to accept the property if it turned out to be held at a rack\r\nrent. But while a rack rent is generally higher in amount than a ground\r\nrent, the latter is usually better secured, as it carries with it the\r\nreversionary interest in buildings and improvements put on the ground\r\n_after_ the date at which the ground rent was fixed, and accordingly\r\nground rents have been regarded as a good investment. Trustees empowered\r\nto invest money on the security of freehold or copyhold hereditaments,\r\nmay invest upon freehold ground rents reserved out of house property. In\r\nestimating the amount that may be so invested, account may be taken of\r\nthe value of the houses, as, if the ground rents are not paid, the\r\nlandlord can re-enter. Again, where a settlement authorizes trustees to\r\npurchase lands or hereditaments in fee-simple or possession, a purchase\r\nof freehold ground rents has been held to be proper. A devise of \"ground\r\nrent\" carries not only the rent but the reversion. Where a tenant is\r\ncompelled, in order to protect himself in the enjoyment of the land in\r\nrespect of which his rent is payable, to pay ground rent to a superior\r\nlandlord (who is of course in a position to distrain on him for it), he\r\nis considered as having been authorized by his immediate landlord to\r\napply his rent, due or accruing due, in this manner, and the payment of\r\nthe ground rent will be held to be payment of the rent itself or part of\r\nit. A lodger should make any payment of this character under the Law of\r\nDistress Amendment Act 1908 (s. 3; and see RENT). Ground rents are\r\napportionable (see APPORTIONMENT).\r\n\r\n  In Scots law, the term \"ground rent\" is not employed, but its place is\r\n  taken, for practical purposes, by the \"ground-annual,\" which bears a\r\n  double meaning. (i.) At the time of the Reformation in Scotland, the\r\n  lands of the Church were parcelled out by the crown into various\r\n  lordships--the grantees being called Lords of Erection. In the 17th\r\n  century these Lords of Erection resigned their superiorities to the\r\n  crown, with the exception of the feu-duties, which were to be retained\r\n  till a price agreed upon for their redemption had been paid. This\r\n  reserved power of redemption was, however, resigned by the crown on\r\n  the eve of the Union and the feu-duties became payable in perpetuity\r\n  to the Lords of Erection as a \"ground-annual.\" (ii.) Speculators in\r\n  building ground usually grant sub-feus to builders at a high feu-duty.\r\n  But where sub-feus are prohibited--as they might be, prior to the\r\n  Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1874--and there is much demand for\r\n  building ground, the feuars frequently stipulate for an annual rent\r\n  from the builders rather than for a price payable at once. This annual\r\n  rent is called a \"ground-annual.\" Interest is not due on arrears of\r\n  ground-annuals. Like other real burdens, ground-annuals may now be\r\n  freely assigned and conveyed (Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1874, s.\r\n  30).\r\n\r\nThe term \"ground rent\" in the English sense does not seem to be\r\ngenerally used in the United States, but is applied in Pennsylvania to a\r\nkind of tenure, created by a grant in fee simple, the grantor reserving\r\nto himself and his heirs a certain rent, which is the interest of the\r\nmoney value of the land. These \"ground rents\" are real estate, and, in\r\ncases of intestacy, go to the heir. They are rent services and not rent\r\ncharges--the statute _Quia Emptores_ never having been in force in\r\nPennsylvania, and are subject to all the incidents of such rents (see\r\nRENT). The grantee of such a \"ground rent\" may mortgage, sell, or\r\notherwise dispose of the grant as he pleases; and while the rent is paid\r\nthe land cannot be sold or the value of the improvements lost.\r\n\r\nA ground rent being a freehold estate, created by deed and perpetual in\r\nduration, no presumption could, at common law, arise from lapse of time,\r\nthat it had been released. But now, by statute (Act of 27th of April\r\n1855, s. 7), a presumption of release or extinguishment is created where\r\nno payment, claim or demand has been made for the rent, nor any\r\ndeclaration or acknowledgment of its existence made or given by the\r\nowner of the premises subject to it, for the period of 21 years. Ground\r\nrents were formerly irredeemable after a certain time. But the creation\r\nof irredeemable ground rents is now forbidden (Pennsylvania Act 7\r\nAssembly, 22nd of April 1850).\r\n\r\n  For English Law see Foa, _Landlord and Tenant_ (3rd ed., London,\r\n  1901); Scots Law, Bell's _Principles_ (10th ed., Edinburgh, 1899);\r\n  American Law, Bouvier, _Law Dict._ (Boston and London, 1897).\r\n       (A. W. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUNDSEL (Ger. _Kreuzkraut_; Fr. _senecon_), _Senecio vulgaris_, an\r\nannual, glabrous, or more or less woolly plant of the natural order\r\nCompositae, having a branched succulent stem 6 to 15 in. in height,\r\npinnatifid irregularly and coarsely-toothed leaves, and small\r\ncylindrical heads of yellow tubular florets enveloped in an involucre of\r\nnumerous narrow bracts; the ribbed fruit bears a soft, feathery, hoary\r\ntuft of hairs (_pappus_). The plant is indigenous to Europe, whence it\r\nhas been introduced into all temperate climates. It is a troublesome\r\nweed, flowering throughout the year, and propagating itself rapidly by\r\nmeans of its light feathery fruits; it has its use, however, as a food\r\nfor cage-birds. _Senecio Jacobaea_, ragwort, is a showy plant with heads\r\nof bright yellow flowers, common in pastures and by roadsides. The genus\r\n_Senecio_ is a very large one, widely distributed in temperate and cold\r\nclimates. The British species are all herbs, but the genus also includes\r\nshrubs and even arborescent forms, which are characteristic features of\r\nthe vegetation of the higher levels on the mountains of tropical Africa.\r\nMany species of the genus are handsome florists' plants. The groundsel\r\ntree, _Baccharis halimifolia_, a native of the North American sea-coast\r\nfrom Massachusetts southward, is a Composite shrub, attaining 6 to 12\r\nft. in height, and having angular branches, obovate or oblong-cuneate,\r\nsomewhat scurfy leaves, and flowers larger than but similar to those of\r\ncommon groundsel. The long white pappus of the female plant renders it a\r\nconspicuous object in autumn. The groundsel tree has been cultivated in\r\nBritish gardens since 1683.\r\n\r\n  The Old English word, represented by \"groundsel,\" appears in two\r\n  forms, _grundeswylige_ and _gundaeswelgiae_; of the first form the\r\n  accepted derivation is from _grund_, ground, and _swelgau_, to\r\n  swallow; a weed of such rapid growth would not inaptly be styled a\r\n  \"ground-swallower.\" If the form without the r be genuine, the word\r\n  might mean \"pus-absorber\" (O.E. _gund_, filth, matter), with reference\r\n  to its use in poultices for abscesses and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUND-SQUIRREL, one of the names for a group of (chiefly) North\r\nAmerican striped terrestrial squirrel-like rodents, more generally known\r\nas chipmunks. They are closely allied to squirrels, from which they are\r\ndistinguished by the possession of cheek-pouches for the storage of\r\nfood. The sides, or the sides and back, are marked with light stripes\r\nbordered by dark bands; the ears are small, and without tufts; and the\r\ntail is relatively short. With the exception of one Siberian species\r\n(_Tamias asiaticus_), ground-squirrels are confined to North America,\r\nwhere they are represented by a large number of species and races, all\r\nreferable to the genus _Tamias_. In North America ground-squirrels are\r\nmigratory, and may be abundant in a district one year, and absent the\r\nnext. They feed on nuts, beechmast, corn and roots, and also on grubs.\r\nWith the assistance of their cheek-pouches they accumulate large\r\nsupplies of food for the winter, during which season they lie dormant in\r\nholes. Although generally keeping to the ground, when hunted they take\r\nto trees, which they climb in search of food. One of the longest known\r\nAmerican species is _T. striatus_.",
