Moyle, D.C.L. of Lincoln's Inn,\r\nBarrister-at-Law, Fellow and Late Tutor of New College, Oxford\r\n\r\nFifth Edition (1913)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROOEMIVM\r\n\r\nIn the name of Our Lord, Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Caesar Flavius Justinian, conqueror of the Alamanni, the\r\nGoths, the Franks, the Germans, the Antes, the Alani, the Vandals, the\r\nAfricans, pious, prosperous, renowned, victorious, and triumphant, ever\r\naugust,\r\n\r\nTo the youth desirous of studying the law:\r\n\r\nThe imperial majesty should be armed with laws as well as glorified\r\nwith arms, that there may be good government in times both of war and\r\nof peace, and the ruler of Rome may not only be victorious over his\r\nenemies, but may show himself as scrupulously regardful of justice as\r\ntriumphant over his conquered foes.\r\n\r\nWith deepest application and forethought, and by the blessing of God, we\r\nhave attained both of these objects. The barbarian nations which we have\r\nsubjugated know our valour, Africa and other provinces without number\r\nbeing once more, after so long an interval, reduced beneath the sway of\r\nRome by victories granted by Heaven, and themselves bearing witness to\r\nour dominion. All peoples too are ruled by laws which we have either\r\nenacted or arranged. Having removed every inconsistency from the sacred\r\nconstitutions, hitherto inharmonious and confused, we extended our care\r\nto the immense volumes of the older jurisprudence; and, like sailors\r\ncrossing the mid-ocean, by the favour of Heaven have now completed a\r\nwork of which we once despaired. When this, with God's blessing, had\r\nbeen done, we called together that distinguished man Tribonian, master\r\nand exquaestor of our sacred palace, and the illustrious Theophilus and\r\nDorotheus, professors of law, of whose ability, legal knowledge, and\r\ntrusty observance of our orders we have received many and genuine\r\nproofs, and especially commissioned them to compose by our authority and\r\nadvice a book of Institutes, whereby you may be enabled to learn your\r\nfirst lessons in law no longer from ancient fables, but to grasp them by\r\nthe brilliant light of imperial learning, and that your ears and minds\r\nmay receive nothing useless or incorrect, but only what holds good in\r\nactual fact. And thus whereas in past time even the foremost of you were\r\nunable to read the imperial constitutions until after four years, you,\r\nwho have been so honoured and fortunate as to receive both the beginning\r\nand the end of your legal teaching from the mouth of the Emperor, can\r\nnow enter on the study of them without delay. After the completion\r\ntherefore of the fifty books of the Digest or Pandects, in which all\r\nthe earlier law has been collected by the aid of the said distinguished\r\nTribonian and other illustrious and most able men, we directed the\r\ndivision of these same Institutes into four books, comprising the\r\nfirst elements of the whole science of law. In these the law previously\r\nobtaining has been briefly stated, as well as that which after becoming\r\ndisused has been again brought to light by our imperial aid. Compiled\r\nfrom all the Institutes of our ancient jurists, and in particular from\r\nthe commentaries of our Gaius on both the Institutes and the common\r\ncases, and from many other legal works, these Institutes were submitted\r\nto us by the three learned men aforesaid, and after reading\r\nand examining them we have given them the fullest force of our\r\nconstitutions.\r\n\r\nReceive then these laws with your best powers and with the eagerness of\r\nstudy, and show yourselves so learned as to be encouraged to hope that\r\nwhen you have compassed the whole field of law you may have ability to\r\ngovern such portion of the state as may be entrusted to you.\r\n\r\nGiven at Constantinople the 21st day of November, in the third consulate\r\nof the Emperor Justinian, Father of his Country, ever august.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n     TITLES\r\n     I.

OF JUSTICE AND LAW\r\n\r\nJustice is the set and constant purpose which gives to every man his\r\ndue.\r\n\r\n1 Jurisprudence is the knowledge of things divine and human, the science\r\nof the just and the unjust.\r\n\r\n2 Having laid down these general definitions, and our object being\r\nthe exposition of the law of the Roman people, we think that the most\r\nadvantageous plan will be to commence with an easy and simple path, and\r\nthen to proceed to details with a most careful and scrupulous exactness\r\nof interpretation. Otherwise, if we begin by burdening the student's\r\nmemory, as yet weak and untrained, with a multitude and variety of\r\nmatters, one of two things will happen: either we shall cause him wholly\r\nto desert the study of law, or else we shall bring him at last, after\r\ngreat labour, and often, too, distrustful of his own powers (the\r\ncommonest cause, among the young, of ill-success), to a point which\r\nhe might have reached earlier, without such labour and confident in\r\nhimself, had he been led along a smoother path.\r\n\r\n3 The precepts of the law are these: to live honestly, to injure no one,\r\nand to give every man his due.\r\n\r\n4 The study of law consists of two branches, law public, and law\r\nprivate. The former relates to the welfare of the Roman State; the\r\nlatter to the advantage of the individual citizen. Of private law then\r\nwe may say that it is of threefold origin, being collected from the\r\nprecepts of nature, from those of the law of nations, or from those of\r\nthe civil law of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE II. OF THE LAW OF NATURE, THE LAW OF NATIONS, AND THE CIVIL LAW\r\n\r\n1 The law of nature is that which she has taught all animals; a law not\r\npeculiar to the human race, but shared by all living creatures, whether\r\ndenizens of the air, the dry land, or the sea. Hence comes the union\r\nof male and female, which we call marriage; hence the procreation and\r\nrearing of children, for this is a law by the knowledge of which we see\r\neven the lower animals are distinguished. The civil law of Rome, and\r\nthe law of all nations, differ from each other thus. The laws of every\r\npeople governed by statutes and customs are partly peculiar to itself,\r\npartly common to all mankind. Those rules which a state enacts for its\r\nown members are peculiar to itself, and are called civil law: those\r\nrules prescribed by natural reason for all men are observed by all\r\npeoples alike, and are called the law of nations. Thus the laws of\r\nthe Roman people are partly peculiar to itself, partly common to all\r\nnations; a distinction of which we shall take notice as occasion offers.\r\n\r\n2 Civil law takes its name from the state wherein it binds; for\r\ninstance, the civil law of Athens, it being quite correct to speak thus\r\nof the enactments of Solon or Draco. So too we call the law of the Roman\r\npeople the civil law of the Romans, or the law of the Quirites; the law,\r\nthat is to say, which they observe, the Romans being called Quirites\r\nafter Quirinus. Whenever we speak, however, of civil law, without any\r\nqualification, we mean our own; exactly as, when 'the poet' is spoken\r\nof, without addition or qualification, the Greeks understand the great\r\nHomer, and we understand Vergil. But the law of nations is common to the\r\nwhole human race; for nations have settled certain things for themselves\r\nas occasion and the necessities of human life required. For instance,\r\nwars arose, and then followed captivity and slavery, which are contrary\r\nto the law of nature; for by the law of nature all men from the\r\nbeginning were born free. The law of nations again is the source of\r\nalmost all contracts; for instance, sale, hire, partnership, deposit,\r\nloan for consumption, and very many others.\r\n\r\n3 Our law is partly written, partly unwritten, as among the Greeks.\r\nThe written law consists of statutes, plebiscites, senatusconsults,\r\nenactments of the Emperors, edicts of the magistrates, and answers of\r\nthose learned in the law.\r\n\r\n4 A statute is an enactment of the Roman people, which it used to make\r\non the motion of a senatorial magistrate, as for instance a consul. A\r\nplebiscite is an enactment of the commonalty, such as was made on the\r\nmotion of one of their own magistrates, as a tribune. The commonalty\r\ndiffers from the people as a species from its genus; for 'the people'\r\nincludes the whole aggregate of citizens, among them patricians and\r\nsenators, while the term 'commonalty' embraces only such citizens as are\r\nnot patricians or senators. After the passing, however, of the statute\r\ncalled the lex Hortensia, plebiscites acquired for the first time the\r\nforce of statutes.\r\n\r\n5 A senatusconsult is a command and ordinance of the senate, for when\r\nthe Roman people had been so increased that it was difficult to assemble\r\nit together for the purpose of enacting statutes, it seemed right that\r\nthe senate should be consulted instead of the people.\r\n\r\n6 Again, what the Emperor determines has the force of a statute, the\r\npeople having conferred on him all their authority and power by the\r\n'lex regia,' which was passed concerning his office and authority.\r\nConsequently, whatever the Emperor settles by rescript, or decides in\r\nhis judicial capacity, or ordains by edicts, is clearly a statute: and\r\nthese are what are called constitutions. Some of these of course are\r\npersonal, and not to be followed as precedents, since this is not the\r\nEmperor's will; for a favour bestowed on individual merit, or a\r\npenalty inflicted for individual wrongdoing, or relief given without\r\na precedent, do not go beyond the particular person: though others are\r\ngeneral, and bind all beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\n7 The edicts of the praetors too have no small legal authority, and\r\nthese we are used to call the 'ius honorarium,' because those who occupy\r\nposts of honour in the state, in other words the magistrates, have given\r\nauthority to this branch of law. The curule aediles also used to issue\r\nan edict relating to certain matters, which forms part of the ius\r\nhonorarium.\r\n\r\n8 The answers of those learned in the law are the opinions and views of\r\npersons authorized to determine and expound the law; for it was of old\r\nprovided that certain persons should publicly interpret the laws, who\r\nwere called jurisconsults, and whom the Emperor privileged to give\r\nformal answers. If they were unanimous the judge was forbidden by\r\nimperial constitution to depart from their opinion, so great was its\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n9 The unwritten law is that which usage has approved: for ancient\r\ncustoms, when approved by consent of those who follow them, are like\r\nstatute.\r\n\r\n10 And this division of the civil law into two kinds seems not\r\ninappropriate, for it appears to have originated in the institutions of\r\ntwo states, namely Athens and Lacedaemon; it having been usual in the\r\nlatter to commit to memory what was observed as law, while the Athenians\r\nobserved only what they had made permanent in written statutes.\r\n\r\n11 But the laws of nature, which are observed by all nations alike, are\r\nestablished, as it were, by divine providence, and remain ever fixed and\r\nimmutable: but the municipal laws of each individual state are subject\r\nto frequent change, either by the tacit consent of the people, or by the\r\nsubsequent enactment of another statute.\r\n\r\n12 The whole of the law which we observe relates either to persons, or\r\nto things, or to actions. And first let us speak of persons: for it is\r\nuseless to know the law without knowing the persons for whose sake it\r\nwas established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE III. OF THE LAW OF PERSONS\r\n\r\nIn the law of persons, then, the first division is into free men and\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n1 Freedom, from which men are called free, is a man's natural power of\r\ndoing what he pleases, so far as he is not prevented by force or law:\r\n\r\n2 slavery is an institution of the law of nations, against nature\r\nsubjecting one man to the dominion of another.\r\n\r\n3 The name 'slave' is derived from the practice of generals to order the\r\npreservation and sale of captives, instead of killing them; hence they\r\nare also called mancipia, because they are taken from the enemy by the\r\nstrong hand.\r\n\r\n4 Slaves are either born so, their mothers being slaves themselves; or\r\nthey become so, and this either by the law of nations, that is to say\r\nby capture in war, or by the civil law, as when a free man, over twenty\r\nyears of age, collusively allows himself to be sold in order that he may\r\nshare the purchase money.\r\n\r\n5 The condition of all slaves is one and the same: in the conditions\r\nof free men there are many distinctions; to begin with, they are either\r\nfree born, or made free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE IV. OF MEN FREE BORN\r\n\r\nA freeborn man is one free from his birth, being the offspring of\r\nparents united in wedlock, whether both be free born or both made free,\r\nor one made free and the other free born. He is also free born if his\r\nmother be free even though his father be a slave, and so also is\r\nhe whose paternity is uncertain, being the offspring of promiscuous\r\nintercourse, but whose mother is free. It is enough if the mother be\r\nfree at the moment of birth, though a slave at that of conception: and\r\nconversely if she be free at the time of conception, and then becomes a\r\nslave before the birth of the child, the latter is held to be free born,\r\non the ground that an unborn child ought not to be prejudiced by the\r\nmother's misfortune. Hence arose the question of whether the child of a\r\nwoman is born free, or a slave, who, while pregnant, is manumitted, and\r\nthen becomes a slave again before delivery. Marcellus thinks he is born\r\nfree, for it is enough if the mother of an unborn infant is free at any\r\nmoment between conception and delivery: and this view is right.\r\n\r\n1 The status of a man born free is not prejudiced by his being placed\r\nin the position of a slave and then being manumitted: for it has been\r\ndecided that manumission cannot stand in the way of rights acquired by\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE V. OF FREEDMEN\r\n\r\nThose are freedmen, or made free, who have been manumitted from legal\r\nslavery. Manumission is the giving of freedom; for while a man is in\r\nslavery he is subject to the power once known as 'manus'; and from that\r\npower he is set free by manumission. All this originated in the law\r\nof nations; for by natural law all men were born free--slavery, and by\r\nconsequence manumission, being unknown. But afterwards slavery came in\r\nby the law of nations; and was followed by the boon of manumission; so\r\nthat though we are all known by the common name of 'man,' three classes\r\nof men came into existence with the law of nations, namely men free\r\nborn, slaves, and thirdly freedmen who had ceased to be slaves.\r\n\r\n1 Manumission may take place in various ways; either in the holy church,\r\naccording to the sacred constitutions, or by default in a fictitious\r\nvindication, or before friends, or by letter, or by testament or any\r\nother expression of a man's last will: and indeed there are many other\r\nmodes in which freedom may be acquired, introduced by the constitutions\r\nof earlier emperors as well as by our own.\r\n\r\n2 It is usual for slaves to be manumitted by their masters at any time,\r\neven when the magistrate is merely passing by, as for instance while the\r\npraetor or proconsul or governor of a province is going to the baths or\r\nthe theatre.\r\n\r\n3 Of freedmen there were formerly three grades; for those who were\r\nmanumitted sometimes obtained a higher freedom fully recognised by the\r\nlaws, and became Roman citizens; sometimes a lower form, becoming by\r\nthe lex Iunia Norbana Latins; and sometimes finally a liberty still more\r\ncircumscribed, being placed by the lex Aelia Sentia on the footing of\r\nenemies surrendered at discretion. This last and lowest class, however,\r\nhas long ceased to exist, and the title of Latin also had become rare:\r\nand so in our goodness, which desires to raise and improve in every\r\nmatter, we have amended this in two constitutions, and reintroduced the\r\nearlier usage; for in the earliest infancy of Rome there was but one\r\nsimple type of liberty, namely that possessed by the manumitter, the\r\nonly distinction possible being that the latter was free born, while\r\nthe manumitted slave became a freedman. We have abolished the class of\r\n'dediticii,' or enemies surrendered at discretion, by our constitution,\r\npublished among those our decisions, by which, at the suggestion of the\r\neminent Tribonian, our quaestor, we have set at rest the disputes of\r\nthe older law. By another constitution, which shines brightly among the\r\nimperial enactments, and suggested by the same quaestor, we have altered\r\nthe position of the 'Latini Iuniani,' and dispensed with all the rules\r\nrelating to their condition; and have endowed with the citizenship\r\nof Rome all freedmen alike, without regard to the age of the person\r\nmanuumitted, and nature of the master's ownership, or the mode of\r\nmanumission, in accordance with the earlier usage; with the addition of\r\nmany new modes in which freedom coupled with the Roman citizenship, the\r\nonly kind of freedom now known may be bestowed on slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE VI. OF PERSONS UNABLE TO MANUMIT, AND THE CAUSES OF THEIR\r\nINCAPACITY\r\n\r\nIn some cases, however, manumission is not permitted; for an owner who\r\nwould defraud his creditors by an intended manumission attempts in vain\r\nto manumit, the act being made of no effect by the lex Aelia Sentia.\r\n\r\n1 A master, however, who is insolvent may institute one of his slaves\r\nheir in his will, conferring freedom on him at the same time, so that\r\nhe may become free and his sole and necessary heir, provided no one else\r\ntakes as heir under the will, either because no one else was instituted\r\nat all, or because the person instituted for some reason or other does\r\nnot take the inheritance. And this was a judicious provision of the\r\nlex Aelia Sentia, for it was most desirable that persons in embarrassed\r\ncircumstances, who could get no other heir, should have a slave as\r\nnecessary heir to satisfy their creditors' claims, or that at least (if\r\nhe did not do this) the creditors might sell the estate in the slave's\r\nname, so as to save the memory of the deceased from disrepute.\r\n\r\n2 The law is the same if a slave be instituted heir without liberty\r\nbeing expressly given him, this being enacted by our constitution in\r\nall cases, and not merely where the master is insolvent; so that in\r\naccordance with the modern spirit of humanity, institution will be\r\nequivalent to a gift of liberty; for it is unlikely, in spite of the\r\nomission of the grant of freedom, that one should have wished the person\r\nwhom one has chosen as one's heir to remain a slave, so that one should\r\nhave no heir at all.\r\n\r\n3 If a person is insolvent at the time of a manumission, or becomes so\r\nby the manumission itself, this is manumission in fraud of creditors.\r\nIt is, however, now settled law, that the gift of liberty is not avoided\r\nunless the intention of the manumitter was fraudulent, even though his\r\nproperty is in fact insufficient to meet his creditors' claims; for men\r\noften hope and believe that they are better off than they really are.\r\nConsequently, we understand a gift of liberty to be avoided only when\r\nthe creditors are defrauded both by the intention of the manumitter,\r\nand in fact: that is to say, by his property being insufficient to meet\r\ntheir claims.\r\n\r\n4 The same lex Aelia Sentia makes it unlawful for a master under twenty\r\nyears of age to manumit, except in the mode of fictitious vindication,\r\npreceded by proof of some legitimate motive before the council.\r\n\r\n5 It is a legitimate motive of manumission if the slave to be manumitted\r\nbe, for instance, the father or mother of the manumitter, or his son\r\nor daughter, or his natural brother or sister, or governor or nurse or\r\nteacher, or fosterson or fosterdaughter or fosterbrother, or a slave\r\nwhom he wishes to make his agent, or a female slave whom he intends to\r\nmarry; provided he marry her within six months, and provided that the\r\nslave intended as an agent is not less than seventeen years of age at\r\nthe time of manumission.\r\n\r\n6 When a motive for manumission, whether true or false, has once been\r\nproved, the council cannot withdraw its sanction.\r\n\r\n7 Thus the lex Aelia Sentia having prescribed a certain mode of\r\nmanumission for owners under twenty, it followed that though a person\r\nfourteen years of age could make a will, and therein institute an heir\r\nand leave legacies, yet he could not confer liberty on a slave until he\r\nhad completed his twentieth year. But it seemed an intolerable hardship\r\nthat a man who had the power of disposing freely of all his property\r\nby will should not be allowed to give his freedom to a single slave:\r\nwherefore we allow him to deal in his last will as he pleases with his\r\nslaves as with the rest of his property, and even to give them their\r\nliberty if he will. But liberty being a boon beyond price, for which\r\nvery reason the power of manumission was denied by the older law to\r\nowners under twenty years of age, we have as it were selected a middle\r\ncourse, and permitted persons under twenty years of age to manumit their\r\nslaves by will, but not until they have completed their seventeenth\r\nand entered on their eighteenth year. For when ancient custom allowed\r\npersons of this age to plead on behalf of others, why should not their\r\njudgement be deemed sound enough to enable them to use discretion in\r\ngiving freedom to their own slaves?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE VII. OF THE REPEAL OF THE LEX FUFIA CANINIA\r\n\r\nMoreover, by the lex Fufia Caninia a limit was placed on the number of\r\nslaves who could be manumitted by their master's testament: but this\r\nlaw we have thought fit to repeal, as an obstacle to freedom and to some\r\nextent invidious, for it was certainly inhuman to take away from a man\r\non his deathbed the right of liberating the whole of his slaves, which\r\nhe could have exercised at any moment during his lifetime, unless there\r\nwere some other obstacle to the act of manumission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE VIII. OF PERSONS INDEPENDENT OR DEPENDENT\r\n\r\nAnother division of the law relating to persons classifies them as\r\neither independent or dependent. Those again who are dependent are in\r\nthe power either of parents or of masters. Let us first then consider\r\nthose who are dependent, for by learning who these are we shall at the\r\nsame time learn who are independent. And first let us look at those who\r\nare in the power of masters.\r\n\r\n1 Now slaves are in the power of masters, a power recognised by the\r\nlaw of all nations, for all nations present the spectacle of masters\r\ninvested with power of life and death over slaves; and to whatever is\r\nacquired through a slave his owner is entitled.\r\n\r\n2 But in the present day no one under our sway is permitted to\r\nindulge in excessive harshness towards his slaves, without some reason\r\nrecognised by law; for, by a constitution of the Emperor Antoninus Pius,\r\na man is made as liable to punishment for killing his own slave as for\r\nkilling the slave of another person; and extreme severity on the part of\r\nmasters is checked by another constitution whereby the same Emperor, in\r\nanswer to inquiries from presidents of provinces concerning slaves who\r\ntake refuge at churches or statues of the Emperor, commanded that on\r\nproof of intolerable cruelty a master should be compelled to sell his\r\nslaves on fair terms, so as to receive their value. And both of these\r\nare reasonable enactments, for the public interest requires that no one\r\nshould make an evil use of his own property. The terms of the rescript\r\nof Antoninus to Aelius Marcianus are as follow:--'The powers of masters\r\nover their slaves ought to continue undiminished, nor ought any man to\r\nbe deprived of his lawful rights; but it is the master's own interest\r\nthat relief justly sought against cruelty, insufficient sustenance, or\r\nintolerable wrong, should not be denied. I enjoin you then to look\r\ninto the complaints of the slaves of Iulius Sabinus, who have fled for\r\nprotection to the statue of the Emperor, and if you find them treated\r\nwith undue harshness or other ignominious wrong, order them to be sold,\r\nso that they may not again fall under the power of their master; and the\r\nlatter will find that if he attempts to evade this my enactment, I shall\r\nvisit his offence with severe punishment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE IX. OF PATERNAL POWER\r\n\r\nOur children whom we have begotten in lawful wedlock are in our power.\r\n\r\n1 Wedlock or matrimony is the union of male and female, involving the\r\nhabitual intercourse of daily life.\r\n\r\n2 The power which we have over our children is peculiar to Roman\r\ncitizens, and is found in no other nation.\r\n\r\n3 The offspring then of you and your wife is in your power, and so too\r\nis that of your son and his wife, that is to say, your grandson and\r\ngranddaughter, and so on. But the offspring of your daughter is not in\r\nyour power, but in that of its own father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE X. OF MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nRoman citizens are joined together in lawful wedlock when they are\r\nunited according to law, the man having reached years of puberty, and\r\nthe woman being of a marriageable age, whether they be independent or\r\ndependent: provided that, in the latter case, they must have the consent\r\nof the parents in whose power they respectively are, the necessity of\r\nwhich, and even of its being given before the marriage takes place, is\r\nrecognised no less by natural reason than by law. Hence the question has\r\narisen, can the daughter or son of a lunatic lawfully contract marriage?\r\nand as the doubt still remained with regard to the son, we decided that,\r\nlike the daughter, the son of a lunatic might marry even without the\r\nintervention of his father, according to the mode prescribed by our\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n1 It is not every woman that can be taken to wife: for marriage with\r\ncertain classes of persons is forbidden. Thus, persons related as\r\nascendant and descendant are incapable of lawfully intermarrying; for\r\ninstance, father and daughter, grandfather and granddaughter, mother and\r\nson, grandmother and grandson, and so on ad infinitum; and the union of\r\nsuch persons is called criminal and incestuous. And so absolute is\r\nthe rule, that persons related as ascendant and descendant merely by\r\nadoption are so utterly prohibited from intermarriage that dissolution\r\nof the adoption does not dissolve the prohibition: so that an\r\nadoptive daughter or granddaughter cannot be taken to wife even after\r\nemancipation.\r\n\r\n2 Collateral relations also are subject to similar prohibitions, but\r\nnot so stringent. Brother and sister indeed are prohibited from\r\nintermarriage, whether they are both of the same father and mother, or\r\nhave only one parent in common: but though an adoptive sister cannot,\r\nduring the subsistence of the adoption, become a man's wife, yet if the\r\nadoption is dissolved by her emancipation, or if the man is emancipated,\r\nthere is no impediment to their intermarriage. Consequently, if a man\r\nwished to adopt his son-in-law, he ought first to emancipate his\r\ndaughter: and if he wished to adopt his daughter-in-law, he ought first to\r\nemancipate his son.\r\n\r\n3 A man may not marry his brother's or his sister's daughter, or even\r\nhis or her granddaughter, though she is in the fourth degree; for when\r\nwe may not marry a person's daughter, we may not marry the granddaughter\r\neither. But there seems to be no obstacle to a man's marrying the\r\ndaughter of a woman whom his father has adopted, for she is no relation\r\nof his by either natural or civil law.\r\n\r\n4 The children of two brothers or sisters, or of a brother and sister,\r\nmay lawfully intermarry.\r\n\r\n5 Again, a man may not marry his father's sister, even though the tie\r\nbe merely adoptive, or his mother's sister: for they are considered to\r\nstand in the relation of ascendants. For the same reason too a man may\r\nnot marry his great-aunt either paternal or maternal.\r\n\r\n6 Certain marriages again are prohibited on the ground of affinity, or\r\nthe tie between a man or his wife and the kin of the other respectively.\r\nFor instance, a man may not marry his wife's daughter or his son's wife,\r\nfor both are to him in the position of daughters. By wife's daughter\r\nor son's wife we must be understood to mean persons who have been thus\r\nrelated to us; for if a woman is still your daughterinlaw, that is,\r\nstill married to your son, you cannot marry her for another reason,\r\nnamely, because she cannot be the wife of two persons at once. So too\r\nif a woman is still your stepdaughter, that is, if her mother is still\r\nmarried to you, you cannot marry her for the same reason, namely,\r\nbecause a man cannot have two wives at the same time.\r\n\r\n7 Again, it is forbidden for a man to marry his wife's mother or his\r\nfather's wife, because to him they are in the position of a mother,\r\nthough in this case too our statement applies only after the\r\nrelationship has finally terminated; otherwise, if a woman is still your\r\nstepmother, that is, is married to your father, the common rule of law\r\nprevents her from marrying you, because a woman cannot have two husbands\r\nat the same time: and if she is still your wife's mother, that is, if\r\nher daughter is still married to you, you cannot marry her because you\r\ncannot have two wives at the same time.\r\n\r\n8 But a son of the husband by another wife, and a daughter of the wife\r\nby another husband, and vice versa, can lawfully intermarry, even though\r\nthey have a brother or sister born of the second marriage.\r\n\r\n9 If a woman who has been divorced from you has a daughter by a second\r\nhusband, she is not your stepdaughter, but Iulian is of opinion that you\r\nought not to marry her, on the ground that though your son's betrothed\r\nis not your daughterinlaw, nor your father's betrothed you stepmother,\r\nyet it is more decent and more in accordance with what is right to\r\nabstain from intermarrying with them.\r\n\r\n10 It is certain that the rules relating to the prohibited degrees of\r\nmarriage apply to slaves: supposing, for instance, that a father and\r\ndaughter, or a brother and sister, acquired freedom by manumission.\r\n\r\n11 There are also other persons who for various reasons are forbidden to\r\nintermarry, a list of whom we have permitted to be inserted in the books\r\nof the Digest or Pandects collected from the older law.\r\n\r\n12 Alliances which infringe the rules here stated do not confer the\r\nstatus of husband and wife, nor is there in such case either wedlock or\r\nmarriage or dowry. Consequently children born of such a connexion\r\nare not in their father's power, but as regards the latter are in\r\nthe position of children born of promiscuous intercourse, who, their\r\npaternity being uncertain, are deemed to have no father at all, and\r\nwho are called bastards, either from the Greek word denoting illicit\r\nintercourse, or because they are fatherless. Consequently, on the\r\ndissolution of such a connexion there can be no claim for return of\r\ndowry. Persons who contract prohibited marriages are subjected to\r\npenalties set forth in our sacred constitutions.\r\n\r\n13 Sometimes it happens that children who are not born in their father's\r\npower are subsequently brought under it. Such for instance is the case\r\nof a natural son made subject to his father's power by being inscribed a\r\nmember of the curia; and so too is that of a child of a free woman with\r\nwhom his father cohabited, though he could have lawfully married her,\r\nwho is subjected to the power of his father by the subsequent execution\r\nof a dowry deed according to the terms of our constitution: and the same\r\nboon is in effect bestowed by that enactment on children subsequently\r\nborn of the same marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XI. OF ADOPTIONS\r\n\r\nNot only natural children are subject, as we said, to paternal power,\r\nbut also adoptive children.\r\n\r\n1 Adoption is of two forms, being effected either by rescript of the\r\nEmperor, or by the judicial authority of a magistrate. The first is the\r\nmode in which we adopt independent persons, and this form of adoption\r\nis called adrogation: the second is the mode in which we adopt a person\r\nsubject to the power of an ascendant, whether a descendant in the first\r\ndegree, as a son or daughter, or in a remoter degree, as a grandson,\r\ngranddaughter, great-grandson, or great-granddaughter.\r\n\r\n2 But by the law, as now settled by our constitution, when a child in\r\npower is given in adoption to a stranger by his natural father, the\r\npower of the latter is not extinguished; no right passes to the adoptive\r\nfather, nor is the person adopted in his power, though we have given a\r\nright of succession in case of the adoptive father dying intestate.\r\nBut if the person to whom the child is given in adoption by its natural\r\nfather is not a stranger, but the child's own maternal grandfather, or,\r\nsupposing the father to have been emancipated, its paternal grandfather,\r\nor its great-grandfather paternal or maternal, in this case, because the\r\nrights given by nature and those given by adoption are vested in one\r\nand the same person, the old power of the adoptive father is left\r\nunimpaired, the strength of the natural bond of blood being augmented by\r\nthe civil one of adoption, so that the child is in the family and\r\npower of an adoptive father, between whom and himself there existed\r\nantecedently the relationship described.\r\n\r\n3 When a child under the age of puberty is adopted by rescript of\r\nthe Emperor, the adrogation is only permitted after cause shown, the\r\ngoodness of the motive and the expediency of the step for the pupil\r\nbeing inquired into. The adrogation is also made under certain\r\nconditions; that is to say, the adrogator has to give security to a\r\npublic agent or attorney of the people, that if the pupil should die\r\nwithin the age of puberty, he will return his property to the persons\r\nwho would have succeeded him had no adoption taken place. The adoptive\r\nfather again may not emancipate them unless upon inquiry they are found\r\ndeserving of emancipation, or without restoring them their property.\r\nFinally, if he disinherits him at death, or emancipates him in his\r\nlifetime without just cause, he is obliged to leave him a fourth of\r\nhis own property, besides that which he brought him when adopted, or by\r\nsubsequent acquisition.\r\n\r\n4 It is settled that a man cannot adopt another person older than\r\nhimself, for adoption imitates nature, and it would be unnatural for a\r\nson to be older than his father. Consequently a man who desires either\r\nto adopt or to adrogate a son ought to be older than the latter by the\r\nfull term of puberty, or eighteen years.\r\n\r\n5 A man may adopt a person as grandson or granddaughter, or as\r\ngreat-grandson or great-granddaughter, and so on, without having a son at\r\nall himself; 6 and similarly he may adopt another man's son as grandson,\r\nor another man's grandson as son.\r\n\r\n7 If he wishes to adopt some one as grandson, whether as the son of an\r\nadoptive son of his own, or of a natural son who is in his power, the\r\nconsent of this son ought to be obtained, lest a family heir be thrust\r\nupon him against his will: but on the other hand, if a grandfather\r\nwishes to give a grandson by a son in adoption to some one else, the\r\nson's consent is not requisite.\r\n\r\n8 An adoptive child is in most respects in the same position, as regards\r\nthe father, as a natural child born in lawful wedlock. Consequently\r\na man can give in adoption to another a person whom he has adopted by\r\nimperial rescript, or before the praetor or governor of a province,\r\nprovided that in this latter case he was not a stranger (i.e. was a\r\nnatural descendant) before he adopted him himself.\r\n\r\n9 Both forms of adoption agree in this point, that persons incapable\r\nof procreation by natural impotence are permitted to adopt, whereas\r\ncastrated persons are not allowed to do so.\r\n\r\n10 Again, women cannot adopt, for even their natural children are not\r\nsubject to their power; but by the imperial clemency they are enabled to\r\nadopt, to comfort them for the loss of children who have been taken from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n11 It is peculiar to adoption by imperial rescript, that children in the\r\npower of the person adrogated, as well as their father, fall under the\r\npower of the adrogator, assuming the position of grandchildren. Thus\r\nAugustus did not adopt Tiberius until Tiberius had adopted Germanicus,\r\nin order that the latter might become his own grandson directly the\r\nsecond adoption was made.\r\n\r\n12 The old writers record a judicious opinion contained in the writings\r\nof Cato, that the adoption of a slave by his master is equivalent to\r\nmanumission. In accordance with this we have in our wisdom ruled by a\r\nconstitution that a slave to whom his master gives the title of son by\r\nthe solemn form of a record is thereby made free, although this is not\r\nsufficient to confer on him the rights of a son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XII. OF THE MODES IN WHICH PATERNAL POWER IS EXTINGUISHED\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the modes in which persons dependent on a superior\r\nbecome independent. How slaves are freed from the power of their\r\nmasters can be gathered from what has already been said respecting their\r\nmanumission. Children under paternal power become independent at the\r\nparent's death, subject, however, to the following distinction.\r\nThe death of a father always releases his sons and daughters from\r\ndependence; the death of a grandfather releases his grandchildren from\r\ndependence only provided that it does not subject them to the power of\r\ntheir father. Thus, if at the death of the grandfather the father is\r\nalive and in his power, the grandchildren, after the grandfather's\r\ndeath, are in the power of the father; but if at the time of the\r\ngrandfather's death the father is dead, or not subject to the\r\ngrandfather, the grandchildren will not fall under his power, but become\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\n1 As deportation to an island for some penal offence entails loss of\r\ncitizenship, such removal of a man from the list of Roman citizens has,\r\nlike his death, the effect of liberating his children from his power;\r\nand conversely, the deportation of a person subject to paternal power\r\nterminates the power of the parent. In either case, however, if the\r\ncondemned person is pardoned by the grace of the Emperor, he recovers\r\nall his former rights.\r\n\r\n2 Relegation to an island does not extinguish paternal power, whether it\r\nis the parent or the child who is relegated.\r\n\r\n3 Again, a father's power is extinguished by his becoming a 'slave of\r\npunishment,' for instance, by being condemned to the mines or exposed to\r\nwild beasts.\r\n\r\n4 A person in paternal power does not become independent by entering\r\nthe army or becoming a senator, for military service or consular\r\ndignity does not set a son free from the power of his father. But by\r\nour constitution the supreme dignity of the patriciate frees a son from\r\npower immediately on the receipt of the imperial patent; for who would\r\nallow anything so unreasonable as that, while a father is able by\r\nemancipation to release his son from the tie of his power, the imperial\r\nmajesty should be unable to release from dependence on another the man\r\nwhom it has selected as a father of the State? 5 Again, capture of the\r\nfather by the enemy makes him a slave of the latter; but the status\r\nof his children is suspended by his right of subsequent restoration by\r\npostliminium; for on escape from captivity a man recovers all his former\r\nrights, and among them the right of paternal power over his children,\r\nthe law of postliminium resting on a fiction that the captive has never\r\nbeen absent from the state. But if he dies in captivity the son is\r\nreckoned to have been independent from the moment of his father's\r\ncapture. So too, if a son or a grandson is captured by the enemy, the\r\npower of his ascendant is provisionally suspended, though he may again\r\nbe subjected to it by postliminium. This term is derived from 'limen'\r\nand 'post,' which explains why we say that the person who has been\r\ncaptured by the enemy and has come back into our territories has\r\nreturned by postliminium: for just as the threshold forms the boundary\r\nof a house, so the ancients represented the boundaries of the empire as\r\na threshold; and this is also the origin of the term 'limes, signifying\r\na kind of end and limit. Thus postliminium means that the captive\r\nreturns by the same threshold at which he was lost. A captive who is\r\nrecovered after a victory over the enemy is deemed to have returned by\r\npostliminium.\r\n\r\n6 Emancipation also liberates children from the power of the parent.\r\nFormerly it was effected either by the observance of an old form\r\nprescribed by statute by which the son was fictitiously sold and then\r\nmanumitted, or by imperial rescript. Our forethought, however, has\r\namended this by a constitution, which has abolished the old fictitious\r\nform, and enabled parents to go directly to a competent judge or\r\nmagistrate, and in his presence release their sons or daughters,\r\ngrandsons or granddaughters, and so on, from their power. After this,\r\nthe father has by the praetor's edict the same rights over the property\r\nof the emancipated child as a patron has over the property of his\r\nfreedman: and if at the time of emancipation the child, whether son or\r\ndaughter, or in some remoter degree of relationship, is beneath the age\r\nof puberty, the father becomes by the emancipation his or her guardian.\r\n\r\n7 It is to be noted, however, that a grandfather who has both a son,\r\nand by that son a grandson or granddaughter, in his power, may either\r\nrelease the son from his power and retain the grandson or granddaughter,\r\nor emancipate both together; and a great-grandfather has the same\r\nlatitude of choice.\r\n\r\n8 Again, if a father gives a son whom he has in his power in adoption\r\nto the son's natural grandfather or great-grandfather, in accordance\r\nwith our constitution on this subject, that is to say, by declaring\r\nhis intention, before a judge with jurisdiction in the matter, in the\r\nofficial records, and in the presence and with the consent of the person\r\nadopted, the natural father's power is thereby extinguished, and passes\r\nto the adoptive father, adoption by whom under these circumstances\r\nretains, as we said, all its old legal consequences.\r\n\r\n9 It is to be noted, that if your daughterinlaw conceives by your son,\r\nand you emancipate or give the latter in adoption during her pregnancy,\r\nthe child when born will be in your power; but if the child is conceived\r\nafter its father's emancipation or adoption, it is in the power of its\r\nnatural father or its adoptive grandfather, as the case may be.\r\n\r\n10 Children, whether natural or adoptive, are only very rarely able to\r\ncompel their parent to release them from his power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XIII. OF GUARDIANSHIPS\r\n\r\nLet us now pass on to another classification of persons. Persons\r\nnot subject to power may still be subject either to guardians or to\r\ncurators, or may be exempt from both forms of control. We will first\r\nexamine what persons are subject to guardians and curators, and thus\r\nwe shall know who are exempt from both kinds of control. And first of\r\npersons subject to guardianship or tutelage.\r\n\r\n1 Guardianship, as defined by Servius, is authority and control over a\r\nfree person, given and allowed by the civil law, in order to protect one\r\ntoo young to defend himself:\r\n\r\n2 and guardians are those persons who possess this authority and\r\ncontrol, their name being derived from their very functions; for they\r\nare called guardians as being protectors and defenders, just as those\r\nentrusted with the care of sacred buildings are called 'aeditui.'\r\n\r\n3 The law allows a parent to appoint guardians in his will for those\r\nchildren in his power who have not attained the age of puberty, without\r\ndistinction between sons and daughters; but a grandson or granddaughter\r\ncan receive a testamentary guardian only provided that the death of the\r\ntestator does not bring them under the power of their own father.\r\nThus, if your son is in your power at the time of your death, your\r\ngrandchildren by him cannot have a guardian given them by your will,\r\nalthough they are in your power, because your death leaves them in the\r\npower of their father.\r\n\r\n4 And as in many other matters afterborn children are treated on the\r\nfooting of children born before the execution of the will, so it is\r\nruled that afterborn children, as well as children born before the will\r\nwas made, may have guardians therein appointed to them, provided that\r\nif born in the testator's lifetime they would be family heirs and in his\r\npower.\r\n\r\n5 If a testamentary guardian be given by a father to his emancipated\r\nson, he must be approved by the governor in all cases, though inquiry\r\ninto the case is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XIV. WHO CAN BE APPOINTED GUARDIANS BY WILL\r\n\r\n1 Persons who are in the power of others may be appointed testamentary\r\nguardians no less than those who are independent; and a man can also\r\nvalidly appoint one of his own slaves as testamentary guardian, giving\r\nhim at the same time his liberty; and even in the absence of express\r\nmanumission his freedom is to be presumed to have been tacitly conferred\r\non him, whereby his appointment becomes a valid act, although of course\r\nit is otherwise if the testator appointed him guardian in the erroneous\r\nbelief that he was free. The appointment of another man's slave as\r\nguardian, without any addition or qualification, is void, though valid\r\nif the words 'when he shall be free' are added: but this latter form is\r\nineffectual if the slave is the testator's own, the appointment being\r\nvoid from the beginning.\r\n\r\n2 If a lunatic or minor is appointed testamentary guardian, he cannot\r\nact until, if a lunatic, he recovers his faculties, and, if a minor, he\r\nattains the age of twentyfive years.\r\n\r\n3 There is no doubt that a guardian may be appointed for and from a\r\ncertain time, or conditionally, or before the institution of the heir.\r\n\r\n4 A guardian cannot, however, be appointed for a particular matter or\r\nbusiness, because his duties relate to the person, and not merely to a\r\nparticular business or matter.\r\n\r\n5 If a man appoints a guardian to his sons or daughters, he is held to\r\nhave intended them also for such as may be afterborn, for the latter\r\nare included in the terms son and daughter. In the case of grandsons,\r\na question may arise whether they are implicitly included in an\r\nappointment of guardians to sons; to which we reply, that they are\r\nincluded in an appointment of guardians if the term used is 'children,'\r\nbut not if it is 'sons': for the words son and grandson have quite\r\ndifferent meanings. Of course an appointment to afterborn children\r\nincludes all children, and not sons only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XV. OF THE STATUTORY GUARDIANSHIP OF AGNATES\r\n\r\nIn default of a testamentary guardian, the statute of the Twelve Tables\r\nassigns the guardianship to the nearest agnates, who are hence called\r\nstatutory guardians.\r\n\r\n1 Agnates are persons related to one another by males, that is, through\r\ntheir male ascendants; for instance, a brother by the same father, a\r\nbrother's son, or such son's son, a father's brother, his son or son's\r\nson. But persons related only by blood through females are not agnates,\r\nbut merely cognates. Thus the son of your father's sister is no agnate\r\nof yours, but merely your cognate, and vice versa; for children are\r\nmember's of their father's family, and not of your mother's.\r\n\r\n2 It was said that the statute confers the guardianship, in case\r\nof intestacy, on the nearest agnates; but by intestacy here must be\r\nunderstood not only complete intestacy of a person having power to\r\nappoint a testamentary guardian, but also the mere omission to make\r\nsuch appointment, and also the case of a person appointed testamentary\r\nguardian dying in the testator's lifetime.\r\n\r\n3 Loss of status of any kind ordinarily extinguishes rights by agnation,\r\nfor agnation is a title of civil law. Not every kind of loss of status,\r\nhowever, affects rights by cognation; because civil changes cannot\r\naffect rights annexed to a natural title to the same extent that they\r\ncan affect those annexed to a civil one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XVI. OF LOSS OF STATUS\r\n\r\nLoss of status, or change in one's previous civil rights, is of three\r\norders, greatest, minor or intermediate, and least.\r\n\r\n1 The greatest loss of status is the simultaneous loss of citizenship\r\nand freedom, exemplified in those persons who by a terrible sentence are\r\nmade 'slaves of punishment,' in freedmen condemned for ingratitude to\r\ntheir patrons, and in those who allow themselves to be sold in order to\r\nshare the purchase money when paid.\r\n\r\n2 Minor or intermediate loss of status is loss of citizenship\r\nunaccompanied by loss of liberty, and is incident to interdiction of\r\nfire and water and to deportation to an island.\r\n\r\n3 The least loss of status occurs when citizenship and freedom are\r\nretained, but a man's domestic position is altered, and is exemplified\r\nby adrogation and emancipation.\r\n\r\n4 A slave does not suffer loss of status by being manumitted, for while\r\na slave he had no civil rights:\r\n\r\n5 and where the change is one of dignity, rather than of civil rights,\r\nthere is no loss of status; thus it is no loss of status to be removed\r\nfrom the senate.\r\n\r\n6 When it was said that rights by cognation are not affected by loss of\r\nstatus, only the least loss of status was meant; by the greatest loss\r\nof status they are destroyed--for instance, by a cognate's becoming\r\na slave--and are not recovered even by subsequent manumission. Again,\r\ndeportation to an island, which entails minor or intermediate loss of\r\nstatus, destroys rights by cognation.\r\n\r\n7 When agnates are entitled to be guardians, it is not all who are so\r\nentitled, but only those of the nearest degree, though if all are in the\r\nsame degree, all are entitled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XVII. OF THE STATUTORY GUARDIANSHIP OF PATRONS\r\n\r\nThe same statute of the Twelve Tables assigns the guardianship of\r\nfreedmen and freedwomen to the patron and his children, and this\r\nguardianship, like that of agnates, is called statutory guardianship;\r\nnot that it is anywhere expressly enacted in that statute, but because\r\nits interpretation by the jurists has procured for it as much reception\r\nas it could have obtained from express enactment: the fact that the\r\ninheritance of a freedman or freedwoman, when they die intestate, was\r\ngiven by the statute to the patron and his children, being deemed a\r\nproof that they were intended to have the guardianship also, partly\r\nbecause in dealing with agnates the statute coupled guardianship with\r\nsuccession, and partly on the principle that where the advantage of\r\nthe succession is, there, as a rule, ought too to be the burden of the\r\nguardianship. We say 'as a rule,' because if a slave below the age of\r\npuberty is manumitted by a woman, though she is entitled, as patroness,\r\nto the succession, another person is guardian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XVIII. OF THE STATUTORY GUARDIANSHIP OF PARENTS\r\n\r\nThe analogy of the patron guardian led to another kind of socalled\r\nstatutory guardianship, namely that of a parent over a son or daughter,\r\nor a grandson or granddaughter by a son, or any other descendant through\r\nmales, whom he emancipates below the age of puberty: in which case he\r\nwill be statutory guardian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XIX. OF FIDUCIARY GUARDIANSHIP\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of guardianship known as fiduciary guardianship,\r\nwhich arises in the following manner. If a parent emancipates a son or\r\ndaughter, a grandson or granddaughter, or other descendant while under\r\nthe age of puberty, he becomes their statutory guardian: but if at his\r\ndeath he leaves male children, they become fiduciary guardians of their\r\nown sons, or brothers and sisters, or other relatives who had been thus\r\nemancipated. But on the decease of a patron who is statutory guardian\r\nhis children become statutory guardians also; for a son of a deceased\r\nperson, supposing him not to have been emancipated during his father's\r\nlifetime, becomes independent at the latter's death, and does not\r\nfall under the power of his brothers, nor, consequently, under their\r\nguardianship; whereas a freedman, had he remained a slave, would at\r\nhis master's death have become the slave of the latter's children. The\r\nguardianship, however, is not cast on these persons unless they are of\r\nfull age, which indeed has been made a general rule in guardianship and\r\ncuratorship of every kind by our constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XX. OF ATILIAN GUARDIANS, AND THOSE APPOINTED UNDER THE LEX IULIA\r\nET TITIA\r\n\r\nFailing every other kind of guardian, at Rome one used to be appointed\r\nunder the lex Atilia by the praetor of the city and the majority of the\r\ntribunes of the people; in the provinces one was appointed under the lex\r\nIulia et Titia by the president of the province.\r\n\r\n1 Again, on the appointment of a testamentary guardian subject to a\r\ncondition, or on an appointment limited to take effect after a certain\r\ntime, a substitute could be appointed under these statutes during the\r\npendency of the condition, or until the expiration of the term: and\r\neven if no condition was attached to the appointment of a testamentary\r\nguardian, a temporary guardian could be obtained under these statutes\r\nuntil the succession had vested. In all these cases the office of the\r\nguardian so appointed determined as soon as the condition was fulfilled,\r\nor the term expired, or the succession vested in the heir.\r\n\r\n2 On the capture of a guardian by the enemy, the same statutes regulated\r\nthe appointment of a substitute, who continued in office until the\r\nreturn of the captive; for if he returned, he recovered the guardianship\r\nby the law of postliminium.\r\n\r\n3 But guardians have now ceased to be appointed under these statutes,\r\nthe place of the magistrates directed by them to appoint being taken,\r\nfirst, by the consuls, who began to appoint guardians to pupils of\r\neither sex after inquiry into the case, and then by the praetors, who\r\nwere substituted for the consuls by the imperial constitutions; for\r\nthese statutes contained no provisions as to security to be taken from\r\nguardians for the safety of their pupils' property, or compelling them\r\nto accept the office in case of disinclination.\r\n\r\n4 Under the present law, guardians are appointed at Rome by the\r\nprefect of the city, and by the praetor when the case falls within his\r\njurisdiction; in the provinces they are appointed, after inquiry, by\r\nthe governor, or by inferior magistrates at the latter's behest if the\r\npupil's property is of no great value.\r\n\r\n5 By our constitution, however, we have done away with all difficulties\r\nof this kind relating to the appointing person, and dispensed with the\r\nnecessity of waiting for an order from the governor, by enacting that if\r\nthe property of the pupil or adult does not exceed five hundred solidi,\r\nguardians or curators shall be appointed by the officers known as\r\ndefenders of the city, along with the holy bishop of the place, or in\r\nthe presence of other public persons, or by the magistrates, or by the\r\njudge of the city of Alexandria; security being given in the amounts\r\nrequired by the constitution, and those who take it being responsible if\r\nit be insufficient.\r\n\r\n6 The wardship of children below the age of puberty is in accordance\r\nwith the law of nature, which prescribes that persons of immature years\r\nshall be under another's guidance and control.\r\n\r\n7 As guardians have the management of their pupils' business, they are\r\nliable to be sued on account of their administration as soon as the\r\npupil attains the age of puberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXI. OF THE AUTHORITY OF GUARDIANS\r\n\r\nIn some cases a pupil cannot lawfully act without the authority of\r\nhis guardian, in others he can. Such authority, for instance, is not\r\nnecessary when a pupil stipulates for the delivery of property, though\r\nit is otherwise where he is the promisor; for it is an established rule\r\nthat the guardian's authority is not necessary for any act by which the\r\npupil simply improves his own position, though it cannot be dispensed\r\nwith where he proposes to make it worse. Consequently, unless the\r\nguardian authorizes all transactions generating bilateral obligations,\r\nsuch as sale, hire, agency, and deposit, the pupil is not bound,\r\nthough he can compel the other contracting party to discharge his own\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\n1 Pupils, however, require their guardian's authority before they can\r\nenter on an inheritance, demand the possession of goods, or accept an\r\ninheritance by way of trust, even though such act be advantageous to\r\nthem, and involves no chance of loss.\r\n\r\n2 If the guardian thinks the transaction will be beneficial to his\r\npupil, his authority should be given presently and on the spot.\r\nSubsequent ratification, or authority given by letter, has no effect.\r\n\r\n3 In case of a suit between guardian and pupil, as the former cannot\r\nlawfully authorize an act in which he is personally concerned or\r\ninterested, a curator is now appointed, in lieu of the old praetorian\r\nguardian, with whose cooperation the suit is carried on, his office\r\ndetermining as soon as it is decided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXII. OF THE MODES IN WHICH GUARDIANSHIP IS TERMINATED\r\n\r\nPupils of either sex are freed from guardianship when they reach the age\r\nof puberty, which the ancients were inclined to determine, in the\r\ncase of males, not only by age, but also by reference to the physical\r\ndevelopment of individuals. Our majesty, however, has deemed it not\r\nunworthy of the purity of our times to apply in the case of males also\r\nthe moral considerations which, even among the ancients, forbade in the\r\ncase of females as indecent the inspection of the person. Consequently\r\nby the promulgation of our sacred constitution we have enacted that\r\npuberty in males shall be considered to commence immediately on\r\nthe completion of the fourteenth year, leaving unaltered the rule\r\njudiciously laid down by the ancients as to females, according to which\r\nthey are held fit for marriage after completing their twelfth year.\r\n\r\n1 Again, tutelage is terminated by adrogation or deportation of the\r\npupil before he attains the age of puberty, or by his being reduced to\r\nslavery or taken captive by the enemy.\r\n\r\n2 So too if a testamentary guardian be appointed to hold office until\r\nthe occurrence of a condition, on this occurrence his office determines.\r\n\r\n3 Similarly tutelage is terminated by the death either of pupil or of\r\nguardian.\r\n\r\n4 If a guardian suffers such a loss of status as entails loss of either\r\nliberty or citizenship, his office thereby completely determines. It is,\r\nhowever, only the statutory kind of guardianship which is destroyed by\r\na guardian's undergoing the least loss of status, for instance, by his\r\ngiving himself in adoption. Tutelage is in every case put an end to by\r\nthe pupil's suffering loss of status, even of the lowest order.\r\n\r\n5 Testamentary guardians appointed to serve until a certain time lay\r\ndown their office when that time arrives.\r\n\r\n6 Finally, persons cease to be guardians who are removed from their\r\noffice on suspicion, or who are enabled to lay down the burden of\r\nthe tutelage by a reasonable ground of excuse, according to the rules\r\npresently stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXIII. OF CURATORS\r\n\r\nMales, even after puberty, and females after reaching marriageable\r\nyears, receive curators until completing their twenty-fifth year,\r\nbecause, though past the age fixed by law as the time of puberty, they\r\nare not yet old enough to administer their own affairs.\r\n\r\n1 Curators are appointed by the same magistrates who appoint guardians.\r\nThey cannot legally be appointed by will, though such appointment, if\r\nmade, is usually confirmed by an order of the praetor or governor of the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\n2 A person who has reached the age of puberty cannot be compelled\r\nto have a curator, except for the purpose of conducting a suit: for\r\ncurators, unlike guardians, can be appointed for a particular matter.\r\n\r\n3 Lunatics and prodigals, even though more than twentyfive years of age,\r\nare by the statute of the Twelve Tables placed under their agnates as\r\ncurators; but now, as a rule, curators are appointed for them at Rome\r\nby the prefect of the city or praetor, and in the provinces by the\r\ngovernor, after inquiry into the case.\r\n\r\n4 Curators should also be given to persons of weak mind, to the deaf,\r\nthe dumb, and those suffering from chronic disease, because they are not\r\ncompetent to manage their own affairs.\r\n\r\n5 Sometimes even pupils have curators, as, for instance, when a\r\nstatutory guardian is unfit for his office: for if a pupil already has\r\none guardian, he cannot have another given him. Again, if a testamentary\r\nguardian, or one appointed by the praetor or governor, is not a good man\r\nof business, though perfectly honest in his management of the pupil's\r\naffairs, it is usual for a curator to be appointed to act with\r\nhim. Again, curators are usually appointed in the room of guardians\r\ntemporarily excused from the duties of their office.\r\n\r\n6 If a guardian is prevented from managing his pupil's affairs by\r\nillhealth or other unavoidable cause, and the pupil is absent or an\r\ninfant, the praetor or governor of the province will, at the guardian's\r\nrisk, appoint by decree a person selected by the latter to act as agent\r\nof the pupil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXIV. OF THE SECURITY TO BE GIVEN BY GUARDIANS AND CURATORS\r\n\r\nTo prevent the property of pupils and of persons under curators from\r\nbeing wasted or diminished by their curators or guardians the\r\npraetor provides for security being given by the latter against\r\nmaladministration. This rule, however, is not without exceptions, for\r\ntestamentary guardians are not obliged to give security, the testator\r\nhaving had full opportunities of personally testing their fidelity\r\nand carefulness, and guardians and curators appointed upon inquiry are\r\nsimilarly exempted, because they have been expressly chosen as the best\r\nmen for the place.\r\n\r\n1 If two or more are appointed by testament, or by a magistrate upon\r\ninquiry, any one of them may offer security for indemnifying the pupil\r\nor person to whom he is curator against loss, and be preferred to his\r\ncolleague, in order that he may either obtain the sole administration,\r\nor else induce his colleague to offer larger security than himself, and\r\nso become sole administrator by preference. Thus he cannot directly call\r\nupon his colleague to give security; he ought to offer it himself, and\r\nso give his colleague the option of receiving security on the one hand,\r\nor of giving it on the other. If none of them offer security, and the\r\ntestator left directions as to which was to administer the property,\r\nthis person must undertake it: in default of this, the office is cast\r\nby the praetor's edict on the person whom the majority of guardians or\r\ncurators shall choose. If they cannot agree, the praetor must interpose.\r\nThe same rule, authorizing a majority to elect one to administer the\r\nproperty, is to be applied where several are appointed after inquiry by\r\na magistrate.\r\n\r\n2 It is to be noted that, besides the liability of guardians and\r\ncurators to their pupils, or the persons for whom they act, for the\r\nmanagement of their property, there is a subsidiary action against the\r\nmagistrate accepting the security, which may be resorted to where\r\nall other remedies prove inadequate, and which lies against those\r\nmagistrates who have either altogether omitted to take security from\r\nguardians or curators, or taken it to an insufficient amount. According\r\nto the doctrines stated by the jurists, as well as by imperial\r\nconstitutions, this action may be brought against the magistrate's heirs\r\nas well as against him personally;\r\n\r\n3 and these same constitutions ordain that guardians or curators who\r\nmake default in giving security may be compelled to do so by legal\r\ndistraint of their goods.\r\n\r\n4 This action, however, will not lie against the prefect of the city,\r\nthe praetor, or the governor of a province, or any other magistrate\r\nauthorized to appoint guardians, but only against those to whose usual\r\nduties the taking of security belongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXV. OF GUARDIANS' AND CURATORS' GROUNDS OF EXEMPTION\r\n\r\nThere are various grounds on which persons are exempted from serving the\r\noffice of guardian or curator, of which the most common is their having\r\na certain number of children, whether in power or emancipated. If, that\r\nis to say, a man has, in Rome, three children living, in Italy four, or\r\nin the provinces five, he may claim exemption from these, as from other\r\npublic offices; for it is settled that the office of a guardian or\r\ncurator is a public one. Adopted children cannot be reckoned for this\r\npurpose, though natural children given in adoption to others may:\r\nsimilarly grandchildren by a son may be reckoned, so as to represent\r\ntheir father, while those by a daughter may not. It is, however, only\r\nliving children who avail to excuse their fathers from serving as\r\nguardian or curator; such as have died are of no account, though the\r\nquestion has arisen whether this rule does not admit of an exception\r\nwhere they have died in war; and it is agreed that this is so, but only\r\nwhere they have fallen on the field of battle: for these, because they\r\nhave died for their country, are deemed to live eternally in fame.\r\n\r\n1 The Emperor Marcus, too, replied by rescript, as is recorded in his\r\nSemestria, that employment in the service of the Treasury is a valid\r\nexcuse from serving as guardian or curator so long as that employment\r\nlasts.\r\n\r\n2 Again, those are excused from these offices who are absent in the\r\nservice of the state; and a person already guardian or curator who has\r\nto absent himself on public business is excused from acting in either of\r\nthese capacities during such absence, a curator being appointed to act\r\ntemporarily in his stead. On his return, he has to resume the burden\r\nof tutelage, without being entitled to claim a year's exemption, as has\r\nbeen settled since the opinion of Papinian was delivered in the fifth\r\nbook of his replies; for the year's exemption or vacation belongs only\r\nto such as are called to a new tutelage.\r\n\r\n3 By a rescript of the Emperor Marcus persons holding any magistracy may\r\nplead this as a ground of exemption, though it will not enable them to\r\nresign an office of this kind already entered upon.\r\n\r\n4 No guardian or curator can excuse himself on the ground of an action\r\npending between himself and his ward, unless it relates to the latter's\r\nwhole estate or to an inheritance.\r\n\r\n5 Again, a man who is already guardian or curator to three persons\r\nwithout having sought after the office is entitled to exemption from\r\nfurther burdens of the kind so long as he is actually engaged with\r\nthese, provided that the joint guardianship of several pupils, or\r\nadministration of an undivided estate, as where the wards are brothers,\r\nis reckoned as one only.\r\n\r\n6 If a man can prove that through poverty he is unequal to the burden of\r\nthe office, this, according to rescripts of the imperial brothers and of\r\nthe Emperor Marcus, is a valid ground of excuse.\r\n\r\n7 Illhealth again is a sufficient excuse if it be such as to prevent a\r\nman from attending to even his own affairs:\r\n\r\n8 and the Emperor Pius decided by a rescript that persons unable to read\r\nought to be excused, though even these are not incapable of transacting\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n9 A man too is at once excused if he can show that a father has\r\nappointed him testamentary guardian out of enmity, while conversely no\r\none can in any case claim exemption who promised the ward's father that\r\nhe would act as guardian to them:\r\n\r\n10 and it was settled by a rescript of M. Aurelius and L. Verus that the\r\nallegation that one was unacquainted with the pupil's father cannot be\r\nadmitted as a ground of excuse.\r\n\r\n11 Enmity against the ward's father, if extremely bitter, and if there\r\nwas no reconciliation, is usually accepted as a reason for exemption\r\nfrom the office of guardian;\r\n\r\n12 and similarly a person can claim to be excused whose status or civil\r\nrights have been disputed by the father of the ward in an action.\r\n\r\n13 Again, a person over seventy years of age can claim to be excused\r\nfrom acting as guardian or curator, and by the older law persons less\r\nthan twentyfive were similarly exempted. But our constitution, having\r\nforbidden the latter to aspire to these functions, has made excuses\r\nunnecessary. The effect of this enactment is that no pupil or\r\nperson under twentyfive years of age is to be called to a statutory\r\nguardianship; for it was most incongruous to place persons under the\r\nguardianship or administration of those who are known themselves to need\r\nassistance in the management of their own affairs, and are themselves\r\ngoverned by others.\r\n\r\n14 The same rule is to be observed with soldiers, who, even though they\r\ndesire it, may not be admitted to the office of guardian:\r\n\r\n15 and finally grammarians, rhetoricians, and physicians at Rome, and\r\nthose who follow these callings in their own country and are within the\r\nnumber fixed by law, are exempted from being guardians or curators.\r\n\r\n16 If a person who has several grounds of excuse wishes to obtain\r\nexemption, and some of them are not allowed, he is not prohibited from\r\nalleging others, provided he does this within the time prescribed. Those\r\ndesirous of excusing themselves do not appeal, but ought to allege\r\ntheir grounds of excuse within fifty days next after they hear of their\r\nappointment, whatever the form of the latter, and whatever kind of\r\nguardians they may be, if they are within a hundred miles of the place\r\nwhere they were appointed: if they live at a distance of more than a\r\nhundred miles, they are allowed a day for every twenty miles, and thirty\r\ndays in addition, but this time, as Scaevola has said, must never be so\r\nreckoned as to amount to less than fifty days.\r\n\r\n17 A person appointed guardian is deemed to be appointed to the whole\r\npatrimony;\r\n\r\n18 and after he has once acted as guardian he cannot be compelled\r\nagainst his will to become the same person's curator--not even if the\r\nfather who appointed him testamentary guardian added in the will that\r\nhe made him curator, too, as soon as the ward reached fourteen years of\r\nage--this having been decided by a rescript of the Emperors Severus and\r\nAntoninus.\r\n\r\n19 Another rescript of the same emperors settled that a man is\r\nentitled to be excused from becoming his own wife's curator, even after\r\nintermeddling with her affairs.\r\n\r\n20 No man is discharged from the burden of guardianship who has procured\r\nexemption by false allegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXVI. OF GUARDIANS OR CURATORS WHO ARE SUSPECTED\r\n\r\nThe accusation of guardians or curators on suspicion originated in the\r\nstatute of the Twelve Tables;\r\n\r\n1 the removal of those who are accused on suspicion is part of the\r\njurisdiction, at Rome, of the praetor, and in the provinces of their\r\ngovernors and of the proconsul's legate.\r\n\r\n2 Having shown what magistrates can take cognizance of this subject, let\r\nus see what persons are liable to be accused on suspicion. All guardians\r\nare liable, whether appointed by testament or otherwise; consequently\r\neven a statutory guardian may be made the object of such an accusation.\r\nBut what is to be said of a patron guardian? Even here we must reply\r\nthat he too is liable; though we must remember that his reputation must\r\nbe spared in the event of his removal on suspicion.\r\n\r\n3 The next point is to see what persons may bring this accusation; and\r\nit is to be observed that the action partakes of a public character,\r\nthat is to say, is open to all. Indeed, by a rescript of Severus and\r\nAntoninus even women are made competent to bring it, but only those who\r\ncan allege a close tie of affection as their motive; for instance, a\r\nmother, nurse, grandmother, or sister. And the praetor will allow any\r\nwoman to prefer the accusation in whom he finds an affection real enough\r\nto induce her to save a pupil from suffering harm, without seeming to be\r\nmore forward than becomes her sex.\r\n\r\n4 Persons below the age of puberty cannot accuse their guardians on\r\nsuspicion; but by a rescript of Severus and Antoninus it has been\r\npermitted to those who have reached that age to deal thus with their\r\ncurators, after taking the advice of their nearest relations.\r\n\r\n5 A guardian is 'suspected' who does not faithfully discharge his\r\ntutorial functions, though he may be perfectly solvent, as was the\r\nopinion also of Julian. Indeed, Julian writes that a guardian may be\r\nremoved on suspicion before he commences his administration, and a\r\nconstitution has been issued in accordance with this view.\r\n\r\n6 A person removed from office on suspicion incurs infamy if his offence\r\nwas fraud, but not if it was merely negligence.\r\n\r\n7 As Papinian held, on a person being accused on suspicion he is\r\nsuspended from the administration until the action is decided.\r\n\r\n8 If a guardian or curator who is accused on suspicion dies after the\r\ncommencement of the action, but before it has been decided, the action\r\nis thereby extinguished;\r\n\r\n9 and if a guardian fails to appear to a summons of which the object is\r\nto fix by judicial order a certain rate of maintenance for the pupil,\r\nthe rescript of the Emperors Severus and Antoninus provides that the\r\npupil may be put in possession of the guardian's property, and orders\r\nthe sale of the perishable portions thereof after appointment of a\r\ncurator. Consequently, a guardian may be removed as suspected who does\r\nnot provide his pupil with sufficient maintenance.\r\n\r\n10 If, on the other hand, the guardian appears, and alleges that the\r\npupil's property is too inconsiderable to admit of maintenance being\r\ndecreed, and it is shown that the allegation is false, the proper course\r\nis for him to be sent for punishment to the prefect of the city, like\r\nthose who purchase a guardianship with bribery.\r\n\r\n11 So too a freedman, convicted of having acted fraudulently as guardian\r\nof the sons or grandsons of his patron, should be sent to the prefect of\r\nthe city for punishment.\r\n\r\n12 Finally, it is to be noted, that guardians or curators who are guilty\r\nof fraud in their administration must be removed from their office even\r\nthough they offer to give security, for giving security does not change\r\nthe evil intent of the guardian, but only gives him a larger space of\r\ntime wherein he may injure the pupil's property: 13 for a man's mere\r\ncharacter or conduct may be such as to justify one's deeming him\r\n'suspected.' No guardian or curator, however, may be removed on\r\nsuspicion merely because he is poor, provided he is also faithful and\r\ndiligent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     TITLES\r\n     I.

OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS\r\n\r\nIn the preceding book we have expounded the law of Persons: now let us\r\nproceed to the law of Things. Of these, some admit of private ownership,\r\nwhile others, it is held, cannot belong to individuals: for some things\r\nare by natural law common to all, some are public, some belong to a\r\nsociety or corporation, and some belong to no one. But most things\r\nbelong to individuals, being acquired by various titles, as will appear\r\nfrom what follows.\r\n\r\n1 Thus, the following things are by natural law common to all--the air,\r\nrunning water, the sea, and consequently the seashore. No one therefore\r\nis forbidden access to the seashore, provided he abstains from injury to\r\nhouses, monuments, and buildings generally; for these are not, like the\r\nsea itself, subject to the law of nations.\r\n\r\n2 On the other hand, all rivers and harbours are public, so that all\r\npersons have a right to fish therein.\r\n\r\n3 The seashore extends to the limit of the highest tide in time of storm\r\nor winter.\r\n\r\n4 Again, the public use of the banks of a river, as of the river itself,\r\nis part of the law of nations; consequently every one is entitled to\r\nbring his vessel to the bank, and fasten cables to the trees growing\r\nthere, and use it as a resting-place for the cargo, as freely as he may\r\nnavigate the river itself. But the ownership of the bank is in the owner\r\nof the adjoining land, and consequently so too is the ownership of the\r\ntrees which grow upon it.\r\n\r\n5 Again, the public use of the seashore, as of the sea itself, is part\r\nof the law of nations; consequently every one is free to build a cottage\r\nupon it for purposes of retreat, as well as to dry his nets and haul\r\nthem up from the sea. But they cannot be said to belong to any one as\r\nprivate property, but rather are subject to the same law as the sea\r\nitself, with the soil or sand which lies beneath it.\r\n\r\n6 As examples of things belonging to a society or corporation, and not\r\nto individuals, may be cited buildings in cities--theatres, racecourses,\r\nand such other similar things as belong to cities in their corporate\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\n7 Things which are sacred, devoted to superstitious uses, or sanctioned,\r\nbelong to no one, for what is subject to divine law is no one's\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n8 Those things are sacred which have been duly consecrated to God by\r\nHis ministers, such as churches and votive offerings which have been\r\nproperly dedicated to His service; and these we have by our constitution\r\nforbidden to be alienated or pledged, except to redeem captives from\r\nbondage. If any one attempts to consecrate a thing for himself and by\r\nhis own authority, its character is unaltered, and it does not become\r\nsacred. The ground on which a sacred building is erected remains sacred\r\neven after the destruction of the building, as was declared also by\r\nPapinian.\r\n\r\n9 Any one can devote a place to superstitious uses of his own free\r\nwill, that is to say, by burying a dead body in his own land. It is not\r\nlawful, however, to bury in land which one owns jointly with some one\r\nelse, and which has not hitherto been used for this purpose, without the\r\nother's consent, though one may lawfully bury in a common sepulchre\r\neven without such consent. Again, the owner may not devote a place to\r\nsuperstitious uses in which another has a usufruct, without the consent\r\nof the latter. It is lawful to bury in another man's ground, if he gives\r\npermission, and the ground thereby becomes religious even though he\r\nshould not give his consent to the interment till after it has taken\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n10 Sanctioned things, too, such as city walls and gates, are, in\r\na sense, subject to divine law, and therefore are not owned by any\r\nindividual. Such walls are said to be 'sanctioned,' because any offence\r\nagainst them is visited with capital punishment; for which reason\r\nthose parts of the laws in which we establish a penalty for their\r\ntransgressors are called sanctions.\r\n\r\n11 Things become the private property of individuals in many ways; for\r\nthe titles by which we acquire ownership in them are some of them titles\r\nof natural law, which, as we said, is called the law of nations, while\r\nsome of them are titles of civil law. It will thus be most convenient to\r\ntake the older law first: and natural law is clearly the older, having\r\nbeen instituted by nature at the first origin of mankind, whereas\r\ncivil laws first came into existence when states began to be founded,\r\nmagistrates to be created, and laws to be written.\r\n\r\n12 Wild animals, birds, and fish, that is to say all the creatures which\r\nthe land, the sea, and the sky produce, as soon as they are caught\r\nby any one become at once the property of their captor by the law of\r\nnations; for natural reason admits the title of the first occupant to\r\nthat which previously had no owner. So far as the occupant's title is\r\nconcerned, it is immaterial whether it is on his own land or on that of\r\nanother that he catches wild animals or birds, though it is clear that\r\nif he goes on another man's land for the sake of hunting or fowling,\r\nthe latter may forbid him entry if aware of his purpose. An animal thus\r\ncaught by you is deemed your property so long as it is completely under\r\nyour control; but so soon as it has escaped from your control, and\r\nrecovered its natural liberty, it ceases to be yours, and belongs to the\r\nfirst person who subsequently catches it. It is deemed to have recovered\r\nits natural liberty when you have lost sight of it, or when, though it\r\nis still in your sight, it would be difficult to pursue it.\r\n\r\n13 It has been doubted whether a wild animal becomes your property\r\nimmediately you have wounded it so severely as to be able to catch it.\r\nSome have thought that it becomes yours at once, and remains so as\r\nlong as you pursue it, though it ceases to be yours when you cease\r\nthe pursuit, and becomes again the property of any one who catches it:\r\nothers have been of opinion that it does not belong to you till you have\r\nactually caught it. And we confirm this latter view, for it may happen\r\nin many ways that you will not capture it.\r\n\r\n14 Bees again are naturally wild; hence if a swarm settles on your tree,\r\nit is no more considered yours, until you have hived it, than the birds\r\nwhich build their nests there, and consequently if it is hived by\r\nsome one else, it becomes his property. So too any one may take the\r\nhoneycombs which bees may chance to have made, though, of course, if you\r\nsee some one coming on your land for this purpose, you have a right,\r\nto forbid him entry before that purpose is effected. A swarm which has\r\nflown from your hive is considered to remain yours so long as it is in\r\nyour sight and easy of pursuit: otherwise it belongs to the first person\r\nwho catches it.\r\n\r\n15 Peafowl too and pigeons are naturally wild, and it is no valid\r\nobjection that they are used to return to the same spots from which they\r\nfly away, for bees do this, and it is admitted that bees are wild by\r\nnature; and some people have deer so tame that they will go into the\r\nwoods and yet habitually come back again, and still no one denies that\r\nthey are naturally wild. With regard, however, to animals which have\r\nthis habit of going away and coming back again, the rule has been\r\nestablished that they are deemed yours so long as they have the intent\r\nto return: for if they cease to have this intention they cease to be\r\nyours, and belong to the first person who takes them; and when they lose\r\nthe habit they seem also to have lost the intention of returning.\r\n\r\n16 Fowls and geese are not naturally wild, as is shown by the fact that\r\nthere are some kinds of fowls and geese which we call wild kinds. Hence\r\nif your geese or fowls are frightened and fly away, they are considered\r\nto continue yours wherever they may be, even though you have lost sight\r\nof them; and any one who keeps them intending thereby to make a profit\r\nis held guilty of theft.\r\n\r\n17 Things again which we capture from the enemy at once become ours\r\nby the law of nations, so that by this rule even free men become our\r\nslaves, though, if they escape from our power and return to their own\r\npeople, they recover their previous condition.\r\n\r\n18 Precious stones too, and gems, and all other things found on the\r\nseashore, become immediately by natural law the property of the finder:\r\n\r\n19 and by the same law the young of animals of which you are the owner\r\nbecome your property also.\r\n\r\n20 Moreover, soil which a river has added to your land by alluvion\r\nbecomes yours by the law of nations. Alluvion is an imperceptible\r\naddition; and that which is added so gradually that you cannot perceive\r\nthe exact increase from one moment of time to another is added by\r\nalluvion.\r\n\r\n21 If, however, the violence of the stream sweeps away a parcel of\r\nyour land and carries it down to the land of your neighbour it clearly\r\nremains yours; though of course if in the process of time it becomes\r\nfirmly attached to your neighbour's land, they are deemed from that time\r\nto have become part and parcel thereof.\r\n\r\n22 When an island rises in the sea, though this rarely happens, it\r\nbelongs to the first occupant; for, until occupied, it is held to belong\r\nto no one. If, however (as often occurs), an island rises in a river,\r\nand it lies in the middle of the stream, it belongs in common to the\r\nlandowners on either bank, in proportion to the extent of their riparian\r\ninterest; but if it lies nearer to one bank than to the other, it\r\nbelongs to the landowners on that bank only. If a river divides into\r\ntwo channels, and by uniting again these channels transform a man's land\r\ninto an island, the ownership of that land is in no way altered:\r\n\r\n23 but if a river entirely leaves its old channel, and begins to run in\r\na new one, the old channel belongs to the landowners on either side of\r\nit in proportion to the extent of their riparian interest, while the new\r\none acquires the same legal character as the river itself, and becomes\r\npublic. But if after a while the river returns to its old channel, the\r\nnew channel again becomes the property of those who possess the land\r\nalong its banks.\r\n\r\n24 It is otherwise if one's land is wholly flooded, for a flood does not\r\npermanently alter the nature of the land, and consequently if the water\r\ngoes back the soil clearly belongs to its previous owner.\r\n\r\n25 When a man makes a new object out of materials belonging to another,\r\nthe question usually arises, to which of them, by natural reason, does\r\nthis new object belong--to the man who made it, or to the owner of the\r\nmaterials? For instance, one man may make wine, or oil, or corn, out of\r\nanother man's grapes, olives, or sheaves; or a vessel out of his gold,\r\nsilver, or bronze; or mead of his wine and honey; or a plaster or\r\neyesalve out of his drugs; or cloth out of his wool; or a ship, a chest,\r\nor a chair out of his timber. After many controversies between the\r\nSabinians and Proculians, the law has now been settled as follows, in\r\naccordance with the view of those who followed a middle course between\r\nthe opinions of the two schools. If the new object can be reduced to\r\nthe materials out of which it was made, it belongs to the owner of the\r\nmaterials; if not, it belongs to the person who made it. For instance, a\r\nvessel can be melted down, and so reduced to the rude material--bronze,\r\nsilver, or gold--of which it is made: but it is impossible to reconvert\r\nwine into grapes, oil into olives, or corn into sheaves, or even mead\r\ninto the wine and honey out of which it was compounded. But if a man\r\nmakes a new object out of materials which belong partly to him and\r\npartly to another--for instance, mead of his own wine and another's\r\nhoney, or a plaster or eyesalve of drugs which are not all his own, or\r\ncloth of wool which belongs only in part to him--in this case there\r\ncan be no doubt that the new object belongs to its creator, for he has\r\ncontributed not only part of the material, but the labour by which it\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\n26 If, however, a man weaves into his own cloth another man's purple,\r\nthe latter, though the more valuable, becomes part of the cloth by\r\naccession; but its former owner can maintain an action of theft against\r\nthe purloiner, and also a condiction, or action for reparative damages,\r\nwhether it was he who made the cloth, or some one else; for although the\r\ndestruction of property is a bar to a real action for its recovery,\r\nit is no bar to a condiction against the thief and certain other\r\npossessors.\r\n\r\n27 If materials belonging to two persons are mixed by consent--for\r\ninstance, if they mix their wines, or melt together their gold or their\r\nsilver--the result of the mixture belongs to them in common. And the law\r\nis the same if the materials are of different kinds, and their mixture\r\nconsequently results in a new object, as where mead is made by mixing\r\nwine and honey, or electrum by mixing gold and silver; for even here it\r\nis not doubted that the new object belongs in common to the owners of\r\nthe materials. And if it is by accident, and not by the intention of the\r\nowners, that materials have become mixed, the law is the same, whether\r\nthey were of the same or of different kinds.\r\n\r\n28 But if the corn of Titius has become mixed with yours, and this by\r\nmutual consent, the whole will belong to you in common, because the\r\nseparate bodies or grains, which before belonged to one or the other\r\nof you in severalty, have by consent on both sides been made your joint\r\nproperty. If, however, the mixture was accidental, or if Titius mixed\r\nthe two parcels of corn without your consent, they do not belong to\r\nyou in common, because the separate grains remain distinct, and their\r\nsubstance is unaltered; and in such cases the corn no more becomes\r\ncommon property than does a flock formed by the accidental mixture of\r\nTitius's sheep with yours. But if either of you keeps the whole of the\r\nmixed corn, the other can bring a real action for the recovery of such\r\npart of it as belongs to him, it being part of the province of the judge\r\nto determine the quality of the wheat which belonged to each.\r\n\r\n29 If a man builds upon his own ground with another's materials, the\r\nbuilding is deemed to be his property, for buildings become a part\r\nof the ground on which they stand. And yet he who was owner of the\r\nmaterials does not cease to own them, but he cannot bring a real action\r\nfor their recovery, or sue for their production, by reason of a clause\r\nin the Twelve Tables providing that no one shall be compelled to take\r\nout of his house materials (tignum), even though they belong to another,\r\nwhich have once been built into it, but that double their value may\r\nbe recovered by the action called 'de tigno iniuncto.' The term tignum\r\nincludes every kind of material employed in building, and the object\r\nof this provision is to avoid the necessity of having buildings pulled\r\ndown; but if through some cause or other they should be destroyed, the\r\nowner of the materials, unless he has already sued for double value, may\r\nbring a real action for recovery, or a personal action for production.\r\n\r\n30 On the other hand, if one man builds a house on another's land with\r\nhis own materials, the house belongs to the owner of the land. In this\r\ncase, however, the right of the previous owner in the materials is\r\nextinguished, because he is deemed to have voluntarily parted with them,\r\nthough only, of course, if he was aware that the land on which he was\r\nbuilding belonged to another man. Consequently, though the house should\r\nbe destroyed, he cannot claim the materials by real action. Of course,\r\nif the builder of the house has possession of the land, and the owner of\r\nthe latter claims the house by real action, but refuses to pay for the\r\nmaterials and the workmen's wages, he can be defeated by the plea of\r\nfraud, provided the builder's possession is in good faith: for if he\r\nknew that the land belonged to some one else it may be urged against him\r\nthat he was to blame for rashly building on land owned to his knowledge\r\nby another man.\r\n\r\n31 If Titius plants another man's shrub in land belonging to himself,\r\nthe shrub will become his; and, conversely, if he plants his own shrub\r\nin the land of Maevius, it will belong to Maevius. In neither case,\r\nhowever, will the ownership be transferred until the shrub has taken\r\nroot: for, until it has done this, it continues to belong to the\r\noriginal owner. So strict indeed is the rule that the ownership of\r\nthe shrub is transferred from the moment it has taken root, that if a\r\nneighbour's tree grows so close to the land of Titius that the soil of\r\nthe latter presses round it, whereby it drives its roots entirely into\r\nthe same, we say the tree becomes the property of Titius, on the ground\r\nthat it would be unreasonable to allow the owner of a tree to be a\r\ndifferent person from the owner of the land in which it is rooted.\r\nConsequently, if a tree which grows on the boundaries of two estates\r\ndrives its roots even partially into the neighbour's soil, it becomes\r\nthe common property of the two landowners.\r\n\r\n32 On the same principle corn is reckoned to become a part of the soil\r\nin which it is sown. But exactly as (according to what we said) a man\r\nwho builds on another's land can defend himself by the plea of fraud\r\nwhen sued for the building by the owner of the land, so here too one who\r\nhas in good faith and at his own expense put crops into another man's\r\nsoil can shelter himself behind the same plea, if refused compensation\r\nfor labour and outlay.\r\n\r\n33 Writing again, even though it be in letters of gold, becomes a part\r\nof the paper or parchment, exactly as buildings and sown crops become\r\npart of the soil, and consequently if Titius writes a poem, or a\r\nhistory, or a speech on your paper and parchment, the whole will be held\r\nto belong to you, and not to Titius. But if you sue Titius to recover\r\nyour books or parchments, and refuse to pay the value of the writing,\r\nhe will be able to defend himself by the plea of fraud, provided that he\r\nobtained possession of the paper or parchment in good faith.\r\n\r\n34 Where, on the other hand, one man paints a picture on another's\r\nboard, some think that the board belongs, by accession, to the painter,\r\nothers, that the painting, however great its excellence, becomes part of\r\nthe board. The former appears to us the better opinion, for it is absurd\r\nthat a painting by Apelles or Parrhasius should be an accessory of a\r\nboard which, in itself, is thoroughly worthless. Hence, if the owner\r\nof the board has possession of the picture, and is sued for it by the\r\npainter, who nevertheless refuses to pay the cost of the board, he will\r\nbe able to repel him by the plea of fraud. If, on the other hand, the\r\npainter has possession, it follows from what has been said that the\r\nformer owner of the board, [if he is to be able to sue at all], must\r\nclaim it by a modified and not by a direct action; and in this case,\r\nif he refuses to pay the cost of the picture, he can be repelled by the\r\nplea of fraud, provided that the possession of the painter be in good\r\nfaith; for it is clear, that if the board was stolen by the painter, or\r\nsome one else, from its former owner, the latter can bring the action of\r\ntheft.\r\n\r\n35 If a man in good faith buys land from another who is not its owner,\r\nthough he believed he was, or acquires it in good faith by gift or some\r\nother lawful title, natural reason directs that the fruits which he has\r\ngathered shall be his, in consideration of his care and cultivation:\r\nconsequently if the owner subsequently appears and claims the land by\r\nreal action, he cannot sue for fruits which the possessor has consumed.\r\nThis, however, is not allowed to one who takes possession of land which\r\nto his knowledge belongs to another person, and therefore he is obliged\r\nnot only to restore the land, but to make compensation for fruits even\r\nthough they have been consumed.\r\n\r\n36 A person who has a usufruct in land does not become owner of\r\nthe fruits which grow thereon until he has himself gathered them;\r\nconsequently fruits which, at the moment of his decease, though ripe,\r\nare yet ungathered, do not belong to his heir, but to the owner of the\r\nland. What has been said applies also in the main to the lessee of land.\r\n\r\n37 The term 'fruits,' when used of animals, comprises their young,\r\nas well as milk, hair, and wool; thus lambs, kids, calves, and foals,\r\nbelong at once, by the natural law of ownership, to the fructuary.\r\nBut the term does not include the offspring of a female slave, which\r\nconsequently belongs to her master; for it seemed absurd to reckon human\r\nbeings as fruits, when it is for their sake that all other fruits have\r\nbeen provided by nature.\r\n\r\n38 The usufructuary of a flock, as Julian held, ought to replace any of\r\nthe animals which die from the young of the rest, and, if his usufruct\r\nbe of land, to replace dead vines or trees; for it is his duty to\r\ncultivate according to law and use them like a careful head of a family.\r\n\r\n39 If a man found treasure in his own land, the Emperor Hadrian,\r\nfollowing natural equity, adjudged to him the ownership of it, as he\r\nalso did to a man who found one by accident in soil which was sacred or\r\nreligious. If he found it in another man's land by accident, and without\r\nspecially searching for it, he gave half to the finder, half to the\r\nowner of the soil; and upon this principle, if a treasure were found in\r\nland belonging to the Emperor, he decided that half should belong to\r\nthe latter, and half to the finder; and consistently with this, if a man\r\nfinds one in land which belongs to the imperial treasury or the people,\r\nhalf belongs to him, and half to the treasury or the State.\r\n\r\n40 Delivery again is a mode in which we acquire things by natural law;\r\nfor it is most agreeable to natural equity that where a man wishes to\r\ntransfer his property to another person his wish should be confirmed.\r\nConsequently corporeal things, whatever be their nature, admit of\r\ndelivery, and delivery by their owner makes them the property of the\r\nalienee; this, for instance, is the mode of alienating stipendiary and\r\ntributary estates, that is to say, estates lying in provincial soil;\r\nbetween which, however, and estates in Italy there now exists, according\r\nto our constitution, no difference.\r\n\r\n41 And ownership is transferred whether the motive of the delivery\r\nbe the desire to make a gift, to confer a dowry, or any other motive\r\nwhatsoever. When, however, a thing is sold and delivered, it does not\r\nbecome the purchaser's property until he has paid the price to the\r\nvendor, or satisfied him in some other way, as by getting some one else\r\nto accept liability for him, or by pledge. And this rule, though laid\r\ndown also in the statute of the Twelve Tables, is rightly said to be a\r\ndictate of the law of all nations, that is, of natural law. But if the\r\nvendor gives the purchaser credit, the goods sold belong to the latter\r\nat once.\r\n\r\n42 It is immaterial whether the person who makes delivery is the owner\r\nhimself, or some one else acting with his consent.\r\n\r\n43 Consequently, if any one is entrusted by an owner with the management\r\nof his business at his own free discretion, and in the execution of his\r\ncommission sells and delivers any article, he makes the receiver its\r\nowner.\r\n\r\n44 In some cases even the owner's bare will is sufficient, without\r\ndelivery, to transfer ownership. For instance, if a man sells or makes\r\nyou a present of a thing which he has previously lent or let to you or\r\nplaced in your custody, though it was not from that motive he originally\r\ndelivered it to you, yet by the very fact that he suffers it to be\r\nyours you at once become its owner as fully as if it had been originally\r\ndelivered for the purpose of passing the property.\r\n\r\n45 So too if a man sells goods lying in a warehouse, he transfers the\r\nownership of them to the purchaser immediately he has delivered to the\r\nlatter the keys of the warehouse.\r\n\r\n46 Nay, in some cases the will of the owner, though directly only\r\ntowards an uncertain person, transfers the ownership of the thing, as\r\nfor instance when praetors and consuls throw money to a crowd: here they\r\nknow not which specific coin each person will get, yet they make the\r\nunknown recipient immediately owner, because it is their will that each\r\nshall have what he gets.\r\n\r\n47 Accordingly, it is true that if a man takes possession of property\r\nabandoned by its previous owner, he at once becomes its owner himself:\r\nand a thing is said to be abandoned which its owner throws away with the\r\ndeliberate intention that it shall no longer be part of his property,\r\nand of which, consequently, he immediately ceases to be the owner.\r\n\r\n48 It is otherwise with things which are thrown overboard during a\r\nstorm, in order to lighten the ship; in the ownership of these things\r\nthere is no change, because the reason for which they are thrown\r\noverboard is obviously not that the owner does not care to own them any\r\nlonger, but that he and the ship besides may be more likely to escape\r\nthe perils of the sea. Consequently any one who carries them off after\r\nthey are washed on shore, or who picks them up at sea and keeps them,\r\nintending to make a profit thereby, commits a theft; for such things\r\nseem to be in much the same position as those which fall out of a\r\ncarriage in motion unknown to their owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE II. OF INCORPOREAL THINGS\r\n\r\nSome things again are corporeal, and others incorporeal.\r\n\r\n1 Those are corporeal which in their own nature are tangible, such as\r\nland, slaves, clothing, gold, silver, and others innumerable.\r\n\r\n2 Things incorporeal are such as are intangible: rights, for instance,\r\nsuch as inheritance, usufruct, and obligations, however acquired. And it\r\nis no objection to this definition that an inheritance comprises things\r\nwhich are corporeal; for the fruits of land enjoyed by a usufructuary\r\nare corporeal too, and obligations generally relate to the conveyance of\r\nsomething corporeal, such as land, slaves, or money, and yet the right\r\nof succession, the right of usufruct, and the right existing in every\r\nobligation, are incorporeal.\r\n\r\n3 So too the rights appurtenant to land, whether in town or country,\r\nwhich are usually called servitudes, are incorporeal things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE III. OF SERVITUDES\r\n\r\nThe following are rights appurtenant to country estates: 'iter,'\r\nthe right of passage at will for a man only, not of driving beast or\r\nvehicles; 'actus,' the right of driving beasts or vehicles (of which two\r\nthe latter contains the former, though the former does not contain the\r\nlatter, so that a man who has iter has not necessarily actus, while if\r\nhe has actus he has also iter, and consequently can pass himself even\r\nthough unaccompanied by cattle); 'via,' which is the right of going, of\r\ndriving any thing whatsoever, and of walking, and which thus contains\r\nboth iter and actus; and fourthly, 'aquaeductus,' the right of\r\nconducting water over another man's land.\r\n\r\n1 Servitudes appurtenant to town estates are rights which are attached\r\nto buildings; and they are said to appertain to town estates because all\r\nbuildings are called 'town estates,' even though they are actually in\r\nthe country. The following are servitudes of this kind--the obligation\r\nof a man to support the weight of his neighbour's house, to allow a beam\r\nto be let into his wall, or to receive the rain from his neighbour's\r\nroof on to his own either in drops or from a shoot, or from a gutter\r\ninto his yard; the converse right of exemption from any of these\r\nobligations; and the right of preventing a neighbour from raising his\r\nbuildings, lest thereby one's ancient lights be obstructed.\r\n\r\n2 Some think that among servitudes appurtenant to country estates ought\r\nproperly to be reckoned the rights of drawing water, of watering cattle,\r\nof pasture, of burning lime, and of digging sand.\r\n\r\n3 These servitudes are called rights attached to estates, because\r\nwithout estates they cannot come into existence; for no one can acquire\r\nor own a servitude attached to a town or country estate unless he has an\r\nestate for it to be attached to.\r\n\r\n4 When a landowner wishes to create any of these rights in favour of\r\nhis neighbour, the proper mode of creation is agreement followed by\r\nstipulation. By testament too one can impose on one's heir an obligation\r\nnot to raise the height of his house so as to obstruct his neighbour's\r\nancient lights, or bind him to allow a neighbour to let a beam into\r\nhis wall, to receive the rain water from a neighbour's pipe, or allow a\r\nneighbour a right of way, of driving cattle or vehicles over his land,\r\nor conducting water over it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE IV. OF USUFRUCT\r\n\r\nUsufruct is the right of using and taking the fruits of property not\r\none's own, without impairing the substance of that property; for being\r\na right over a corporeal thing, it is necessarily extinguished itself\r\nalong with the extinction of the latter.\r\n\r\n1 Usufruct is thus a right detached from the aggregate of rights\r\ninvolved in ownership, and this separation can be effected in very many\r\nways: for instance, if one man gives another a usufruct by legacy, the\r\nlegatee has the usufruct, while the heir has merely the bare ownership;\r\nand, conversely, if a man gives a legacy of an estate, reserving\r\nthe usufruct, the usufruct belongs to the heir, while only the bare\r\nownership is vested in the legatee. Similarly, he can give to one man\r\na legacy of the usufruct, to another one of the estate, subject to the\r\nother's usufruct. If it is wished to create a usufruct in favour of\r\nanother person otherwise than by testament, the proper mode is agreement\r\nfollowed by stipulation. However, lest ownership should be entirely\r\nvalueless through the permanent separation from it of the usufruct,\r\ncertain modes have been approved in which usufruct may be extinguished,\r\nand thereby revert to the owner.\r\n\r\n2 A usufruct may be created not only in land or buildings, but also in\r\nslaves, cattle, and other objects generally, except such as are actually\r\nconsumed by being used, of which a genuine usufruct is impossible by\r\nboth natural and civil law. Among them are wine, oil, grain, clothing,\r\nand perhaps we may also say coined money; for a sum of money is in a\r\nsense extinguished by changing hands, as it constantly does in simply\r\nbeing used. For convenience sake, however, the senate enacted that a\r\nusufruct could be created in such things, provided that due security be\r\ngiven to the heir. Thus if a usufruct of money be given by legacy, that\r\nmoney, on being delivered to the legatee, becomes his property, though\r\nhe has to give security to the heir that he will repay an equivalent\r\nsum on his dying or undergoing a loss of status. And all things of this\r\nclass, when delivered to the legatee, become his property, though they\r\nare first appraised, and the legatee then gives security that if he dies\r\nor undergoes a loss of status he will ay the value which was put upon\r\nthem. Thus in point of fact the senate did not introduce a usufruct\r\nof such things, for that was beyond its power, but established a right\r\nanalogous to usufruct by requiring security.\r\n\r\n3 Usufruct determines by the death of the usufructuary, by his\r\nundergoing either of the greater kinds of loss of status, by its\r\nimproper exercise, and by its nonexercise during the time fixed by\r\nlaw; all of which points are settled by our constitution. It is also\r\nextinguished when surrendered to the owner by the usufructuary (though\r\ntransfer to a third person is inoperative); and again, conversely,\r\nby the fructuary becoming owner of the thing, this being called\r\nconsolidation. Obviously, a usufruct of a house is extinguished by\r\nthe house being burnt down, or falling through an earthquake or faulty\r\nconstruction; and in such case a usufruct of the site cannot be claimed.\r\n\r\n4 When a usufruct determines, it reverts to and is reunited with the\r\nownership; and from that moment he who before was but bare owner of the\r\nthing begins to have full power over it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE V. OF USE AND HABITATION\r\n\r\nA bare use, or right of using a thing, is created in the same mode as a\r\nusufruct, and the modes in which it may determine are the same as those\r\njust described.\r\n\r\n1 A use is a less right than a usufruct; for if a man has a bare use of\r\nan estate, he is deemed entitled to use the vegetables, fruit, flowers,\r\nhay, straw, and wood upon it only so far as his daily needs require:\r\nhe may remain on the land only so long as he does not inconvenience its\r\nowner, or impede those who are engaged in its cultivation; but he\r\ncannot let or sell or give away his right to a third person, whereas a\r\nusufructuary may.\r\n\r\n2 Again, a man who has the use of a house is deemed entitled only to\r\nlive in it himself; he cannot transfer his right to a third person, and\r\nit scarcely seems to be agreed that he may take in a guest; but besides\r\nhimself he may lodge there his wife, children, and freedmen, and other\r\nfree persons who form as regular a part of his establishment as his\r\nslaves. Similarly, if a woman has the use of a house, her husband may\r\ndwell there with her.\r\n\r\n3 When a man has the use of a slave, he has only the right of personally\r\nusing his labour and services; in no way is he allowed to transfer his\r\nright to a third person, and the same applies to the use of beasts of\r\nburden.\r\n\r\n4 If a legacy be given of the use of a herd or of a flock of sheep, the\r\nusuary may not use the milk, lambs, or wool, for these are fruits; but\r\nof course he may use the animals for the purpose of manuring his land.\r\n\r\n5 If a right of habitation be given to a man by legacy or in some other\r\nmode, this seems to be neither a use nor a usufruct, but a distinct\r\nand as it were independent right; and by a constitution which we have\r\npublished in accordance with the opinion of Marcellus, and in the\r\ninterests of utility, we have permitted persons possessed of this right\r\nnot only to live in the building themselves, but also to let it out to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n6 What we have here said concerning servitudes, and the rights of\r\nusufruct, use, and habitation, will be sufficient; of inheritance and\r\nobligations we will treat in their proper places respectively. And\r\nhaving now briefly expounded the modes in which we acquire things by the\r\nlaw of nations, let us turn and see in what modes they are acquired by\r\nstatute or by civil law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE VI. OF USUCAPION AND LONG POSSESSION\r\n\r\nIt was a rule of the civil law that if a man in good faith bought a\r\nthing, or received it by way of gift, or on any other lawful ground,\r\nfrom a person who was not its owner, but whom he believed to be such, he\r\nshould acquire it by usucapion--if a movable, by one year's possession,\r\nand by two years' possession if an immovable, though in this case\r\nonly if it were in Italian soil;--the reason of the rule being the\r\ninexpediency of allowing ownership to be long unascertained. The\r\nancients thus considered that the periods mentioned were sufficient to\r\nenable owners to look after their property; but we have arrived at a\r\nbetter opinion, in order to save people from being overquickly defrauded\r\nof their own, and to prevent the benefit of this institution from being\r\nconfined to only a certain part of the empire. We have consequently\r\npublished a constitution on the subject, enacting that the period of\r\nusucapion for movables shall be three years, and that ownership of\r\nimmovables shall be acquired by long possession--possession, that is to\r\nsay, for ten years, if both parties dwell in the same province, and for\r\ntwenty years if in different provinces; and things may in these modes\r\nbe acquired in full ownership, provided the possession commences on a\r\nlawful ground, not only in Italy but in every land subject to our sway.\r\n\r\n1 Some things, however, not withstanding the good faith of the\r\npossessor, and the duration of his possession, cannot be acquired by\r\nusucapion; as is the case, for instance, if one possesses a free man, a\r\nthing sacred or religious, or a runaway slave.\r\n\r\n2 Things again of which the owner lost possession by theft, or\r\npossession of which was gained by violence, cannot be acquired by\r\nusucapion, even by a person who has possessed them in good faith for the\r\nspecified period: for stolen things are declared incapable of usucapion\r\nby the statute of the Twelve Tables and by the lex Atinia, and things\r\ntaken with violence by the lex Iulia et Plautia.\r\n\r\n3 The statement that things stolen or violently possessed cannot, by\r\nstatute, be acquired by usucapion, means, not that the thief or violent\r\ndispossessor is incapable of usucapion--for these are barred by another\r\nreason, namely the fact that their possession is not in good faith; but\r\nthat even a person who has purchased the thing from them in good faith,\r\nor received it on some other lawful ground, is incapable of acquiring by\r\nusucapion. Consequently, in things movable even a person who possesses\r\nin good faith can seldom acquire ownership by usucapion, for he who\r\nsells, or on some other ground delivers possession of a thing belonging\r\nto another, commits a theft.\r\n\r\n4 However, this admits of exception; for if an heir, who believes a\r\nthing lent or let to, or deposited with, the person whom he succeeds,\r\nto be a portion of the inheritance, sells or gives it by way of dowry to\r\nanother who receives it in good faith, there is no doubt that the latter\r\ncan acquire the ownership of it by usucapion; for the thing is here not\r\ntainted with the flaw attaching to stolen property, because an heir does\r\nnot commit a theft who in good faith conveys a thing away believing it\r\nto be his own.\r\n\r\n5 Again, the usufructuary of a female slave, who believes her offspring\r\nto be his property, and sells or gives it away, does not commit a theft:\r\nfor theft implies unlawful intention.\r\n\r\n6 There are also other ways in which one man can transfer to another\r\nproperty which is not his own, without committing a theft, and thereby\r\nenable the receiver to acquire by usucapion.\r\n\r\n7 Usucapion of property classed among things immovable is an easier\r\nmatter; for it may easily happen that a man may, without violence,\r\nobtain possession of land which, owing to the absence or negligence of\r\nits owner, or to his having died and left no successor, is presently\r\npossessed by no one. Now this man himself does not possess in good\r\nfaith, because he knows the land on which he has seized is not his own:\r\nbut if he delivers it to another who receives it in good faith, the\r\nlatter can acquire it by long possession, because it has neither\r\nbeen stolen nor violently possessed; for the idea held by some of the\r\nancients, that a piece of land or a place can be stolen, has now been\r\nexploded, and imperial constitutions have been enacted in the interests\r\nof persons possessing immovables, to the effect that no one ought to\r\nbe deprived of a thing of which he has had long and unquestioned\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n8 Sometimes indeed even things which have been stolen or violently\r\npossessed can be acquired by usucapion, as for instance after they have\r\nagain come under the power of their real owner: for by this they are\r\nrelieved from the taint which had attached to them, and so become\r\ncapable of usucapion.\r\n\r\n9 Things belonging to our treasury cannot be acquired by usucapion. But\r\nthere is on record an opinion of Papinian, supported by the rescripts of\r\nthe Emperors Pius, Severus, and Antoninus, that if, before the property\r\nof a deceased person who has left no heir is reported to the exchequer,\r\nsome one has bought or received some part thereof, he can acquire it by\r\nusucapion.\r\n\r\n10 Finally, it is to be observed that things are incapable of being\r\nacquired through usucapion by a purchaser in good faith, or by one who\r\npossesses on some other lawful ground, unless they are free from all\r\nflaws which vitiate the usucapion.\r\n\r\n11 If there be a mistake as to the ground on which possession is\r\nacquired, and which it is wrongly supposed will support usucapion,\r\nusucapion cannot take place. Thus a man's possession may be founded on\r\na supposed sale or gift, whereas in point of fact there has been no sale\r\nor gift at all.\r\n\r\n12 Long possession which has begun to run in favour of a deceased person\r\ncontinues to run on in favour of his heir or praetorian successor, even\r\nthough he knows that the land belongs to another person. But if the\r\ndeceased's possession had not a lawful inception, it is not available\r\nto the heir or praetorian successor, although ignorant of this. Our\r\nconstitution has enacted that in usucapion too a similar rule shall\r\nbe observed, and that the benefit of the possession shall continue in\r\nfavour of the successor.\r\n\r\n13 The Emperors Severus and Antoninus have decided by a rescript that a\r\npurchaser too may reckon as his own the time during which his vendor has\r\npossessed the thing.\r\n\r\n14 Finally, it is provided by an edict of the Emperor Marcus that after\r\nan interval of five years a purchaser from the treasury of property\r\nbelonging to a third person may repel the owner, if sued by him, by\r\nan exception. But a constitution issued by Zeno of sacred memory has\r\nprotected persons who acquire things from the treasury by purchase,\r\ngift, or other title, affording them complete security from the moment\r\nof transfer, and guaranteeing their success in any action relating\r\nthereto, whether they be plaintiffs or defendants; while it allows those\r\nwho claim any action in respect of such property as owners or pledges\r\nto sue the imperial treasury at any time within four years from the\r\ntransaction. A divine constitution which we ourselves have lately issued\r\nhas extended the operation of Zeno's enactment, respecting conveyances\r\nby the treasury, to persons who have acquired anything from our palace\r\nor that of the Empress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE VII. OF GIFTS\r\n\r\nAnother mode in which property is acquired is gift. Gifts are of two\r\nkinds; those made in contemplation of death, and those not so made.\r\n\r\n1 Gifts of the first kind are those made in view of approaching death,\r\nthe intention of the giver being that in the event of his decease the\r\nthing given should belong to the donee, but that if he should survive or\r\nshould desire to revoke the gift, or if the donee should die first, the\r\nthing should be restored to him. These gifts in contemplation of death\r\nnow stand on exactly the same footing as legacies; for as in some\r\nrespects they were more like ordinary gifts, in others more like\r\nlegacies, the jurists doubted under which of these two classes\r\nthey should be placed, some being for gift, others for legacy: and\r\nconsequently we have enacted by constitution that in nearly every\r\nrespect they shall be treated like legacies, and shall be governed by\r\nthe rules laid down respecting them in our constitution. In a word, a\r\ngift in contemplation of death is where the donor would rather have the\r\nthing himself than that the donee should have it, and that the latter\r\nshould rather have it than his own heir. An illustration may be found in\r\nHomer, where Telemachus makes a gift to Piraeus.\r\n\r\n2 Gifts which are made without contemplation of death, which we call\r\ngifts between the living, are of another kind, and have nothing in\r\ncommon with legacies. If the transaction be complete, they cannot be\r\nrevoked at pleasure; and it is complete when the donor has manifested\r\nhis intention, whether in writing or not. Our constitution has settled\r\nthat such a manifestation of intention binds the donor to deliver,\r\nexactly as in the case of sale; so that even before delivery gifts\r\nare completely effectual, and the donor is under a legal obligation to\r\ndeliver the object. Enactments of earlier emperors required that\r\nsuch gifts, if in excess of two hundred solidi, should be officially\r\nregistered; but our constitution has raised this maximum to five hundred\r\nsolidi, and dispensed with the necessity of registering gifts of this\r\nor of a less amount; indeed it has even specified some gifts which are\r\ncompletely valid, and require no registration, irrespective of their\r\namount. We have devised many other regulations in order to facilitate\r\nand secure gifts, all of which may be gathered from the constitutions\r\nwhich we have issued on this topic. It is to be observed, however,\r\nthat even where gifts have been completely executed we have by our\r\nconstitution under certain circumstances enabled donors to revoke them,\r\nbut only on proof of ingratitude on the part of the recipient of the\r\nbounty; the aim of this reservation being to protect persons, who have\r\ngiven their property to others, from suffering at the hands of the\r\nlatter injury or loss in any of the modes detailed in our constitution.\r\n\r\n3 There is another specific kind of gift between the living, with which\r\nthe earlier jurists were quite unacquainted, and which owed its\r\nlater introduction to more recent emperors. It was called gift before\r\nmarriage, and was subject to the implied condition that it should not\r\nbe binding until the marriage had taken place; its name being due to the\r\nfact that it was always made before the union of the parties, and could\r\nnever take place after the marriage had once been celebrated. The first\r\nchange in this matter was made by our imperial father Justin, who, as\r\nit had been allowed to increase dowries even after marriage, issued a\r\nconstitution authorizing the increase of gifts before marriage during\r\nthe continuance of the marriage tie in cases where an increase had been\r\nmade to the dowry. The name 'gift before marriage' was, however, still\r\nretained, though now inappropriate, because the increase was made to it\r\nafter the marriage. We, however, in our desire to perfect the law, and\r\nto make names suit the things which they are used to denote, have by\r\na constitution permitted such gifts to be first made, and not merely\r\nincreased, after the celebration of the marriage, and have directed that\r\nthey shall be called gifts 'on account of' (and not 'before') marriage,\r\nthereby assimilating them to dowries; for as dowries are not only\r\nincreased, but actually constituted, during marriage, so now gifts\r\non account of marriage may be not only made before the union of\r\nthe parties, but may be first made as well as increased during the\r\ncontinuance of that union.\r\n\r\n4 There was formerly too another civil mode of acquisition, namely, by\r\naccrual, which operated in the following way: if a person who owned\r\na slave jointly with Titius gave him his liberty himself alone by\r\nvindication or by testament, his share in the slave was lost, and went\r\nto the other joint owner by accrual. But as this rule was very bad as a\r\nprecedent--for both the slave was cheated of his liberty, and the kinder\r\nmasters suffered all the loss while the harsher ones reaped all the\r\ngain--we have deemed it necessary to suppress a usage which seemed so\r\nodious, and have by our constitution provided a merciful remedy, by\r\ndiscovering a means by which the manumitter, the other joint owner,\r\nand the liberated slave, may all alike be benefited. Freedom, in whose\r\nbehalf even the ancient legislators clearly established many rules at\r\nvariance with the general principles of law, will be actually acquired\r\nby the slave; the manumitter will have the pleasure of seeing the\r\nbenefit of his kindness undisturbed; while the other joint owner, by\r\nreceiving a money equivalent proportionate to his interest, and on the\r\nscale which we have fixed, will be indemnified against all loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE VIII. OF PERSONS WHO MAY, AND WHO MAY NOT ALIENATE\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that an owner cannot alienate, and that a nonowner\r\ncan. Thus the alienation of dowry land by the husband, without the\r\nconsent of the wife, is prohibited by the lex Iulia, although, since\r\nit has been given to him as dowry, he is its owner. We, however, have\r\namended the lex Iulia, and thus introduced an improvement; for that\r\nstatute applied only to land in Italy, and though it prohibited a\r\nmortgage of the land even with the wife's consent, it forbade it to be\r\nalienated only without her concurrence. To correct these two defects we\r\nhave forbidden mortgages as well as alienations of dowry land even when\r\nit is situated in the provinces, so that such land can now be dealt with\r\nin neither of these ways, even if the wife concurs, lest the weakness\r\nof the female sex should be used as a means to the wasting of their\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n1 Conversely, a pledgee, in pursuance of his agreement, may alienate\r\nthe pledge, though not its owner; this, however, may seem to rest on the\r\nassent of the pledgor given at the inception of the contract, in which\r\nit was agreed that the pledgee should have a power of sale in default of\r\nrepayment. But in order that creditors may not be hindered from pursuing\r\ntheir lawful rights, or debtors be deemed to be overlightly deprived of\r\ntheir property, provisions have been inserted in our constitution and\r\na definite procedure established for the sale of pledges, by which the\r\ninterests of both creditors and debtors have been abundantly guarded.\r\n\r\n2 We must next observe that no pupil of either sex can alienate anything\r\nwithout his or her guardian's authority. Consequently, if a pupil\r\nattempts to lend money without such authority, no property passes, and\r\nhe does not impose a contractual obligation; hence the money, if it\r\nexists, can be recovered by real action. If the money which he attempted\r\nto lend has been spent in good faith by the wouldbe borrower, it can\r\nbe sued for by the personal action called condiction; if it has been\r\nfraudulently spent, the pupil can sue by personal action for its\r\nproduction. On the other hand, things can be validly conveyed to pupils\r\nof either sex without the guardian's authority; accordingly, if a debtor\r\nwishes to pay a pupil, he must obtain the sanction of the guardian to\r\nthe transaction, else he will not be released. In a constitution\r\nwhich we issued to the advocates of Caesarea at the instance of the\r\ndistinguished Tribonian, quaestor of our most sacred palace, it has with\r\nthe clearest reason been enacted, that the debtor of a pupil may safely\r\npay a guardian or curator by having first obtained permission by the\r\norder of a judge, for which no fee is to be payable: and if the judge\r\nmakes the order, and the debtor in pursuance thereof makes payment, he\r\nis completely protected by this form of discharge. Supposing, however,\r\nthat the form of payment be other than that which we have fixed, and\r\nthat the pupil, though he still has the money in his possession, or has\r\nbeen otherwise enriched by it, attempts to recover the debt by action,\r\nhe can be repelled by the plea of fraud. If on the other hand he has\r\nsquandered the money or had it stolen from him, the plea of fraud will\r\nnot avail the debtor, who will be condemned to pay again, as a penalty\r\nfor having carelessly paid without the guardian's authority, and not\r\nin accordance with our regulation. Pupils of either sex cannot validly\r\nsatisfy a debt without their guardian's authority, because the money\r\npaid does not become the creditor's property; the principle being that\r\nno pupil is capable of alienation without his guardian's sanction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE IX. OF PERSONS THROUGH WHOM WE ACQUIRE\r\n\r\nWe acquire property not only by our own acts, but also by the acts\r\nof persons in our power, of slaves in whom we have a usufruct, and of\r\nfreemen and slaves belonging to another but whom we possess in good\r\nfaith. Let us now examine these cases in detail.\r\n\r\n1 Formerly, whatever was received by a child in power of either sex,\r\nwith the exception of military peculium, was acquired for the parent\r\nwithout any distinction; and the parent was entitled to give away or\r\nsell to one child, or to a stranger, what had been acquired through\r\nanother, or dispose of it in any other way that he pleased. This,\r\nhowever, seemed to us to be a cruel rule, and consequently by a general\r\nconstitution which we have issued we have improved the children's\r\nposition, and yet reserved to parents all that was their due. This\r\nenacts that whatever a child gains by and through property, of which\r\nhis father allows him the control, is acquired, according to the old\r\npractice, for the father alone; for what unfairness is there in property\r\nderived from the father returning to him? But of anything which the\r\nchild derives from any source other than his father, though his father\r\nwill have a usufruct therein, the ownership is to belong to the child,\r\nthat he may not have the mortification of seeing the gains which he has\r\nmade by his own toil or good fortune transferred to another.\r\n\r\n2 We have also made a new rule relating to the right which a father had\r\nunder earlier constitutions, when he emancipated a child, of retaining\r\nabsolutely, if he pleased, a third part of such property of the child\r\nas he himself had no ownership in, as a kind of consideration for\r\nemancipating him. The harsh result of this was that a son was by\r\nemancipation deprived of the ownership of a third of his property; and\r\nthus the honour which he got by being emancipated and made independent\r\nwas balanced by the diminution of his fortune. We have therefore enacted\r\nthat the parent, in such a case, shall no longer retain the ownership of\r\na third of the child's property, but, in lieu thereof, the usufruct of\r\none half; and thus the son will remain absolute owner of the whole of\r\nhis fortune, while the father will reap a greater benefit than before,\r\nby being entitled to the enjoyment of a half instead of a third.\r\n\r\n3 Again, all rights which your slaves acquire by tradition, stipulation,\r\nor any other title, are acquired for you, even though the acquisition be\r\nwithout your knowledge, or even against your will; for a slave, who\r\nis in the power of another person, can have nothing of his own.\r\nConsequently, if he is instituted heir, he must, in order to be able to\r\naccept the inheritance, have the command of his master; and if he has\r\nthat command, and accepts the inheritance, it is acquired for his master\r\nexactly as if the latter had himself been instituted heir; and it is\r\nprecisely the same with a legacy. And not only is ownership acquired for\r\nyou by those in your power, but also possession; for you are deemed to\r\npossess everything of which they have obtained detention, and thus\r\nthey are to you instruments through whom ownership may be acquired by\r\nusucapion or long possession.\r\n\r\n4 Respecting slaves in whom a person has only a usufruct, the rule is,\r\nthat what they acquire by means of the property of the usufructuary,\r\nor by their own work, is acquired for him; but what they acquire by\r\nany other means belongs to their owner, to whom they belong themselves.\r\nAccordingly, if such a slave is instituted heir, or made legatee\r\nor donee, the succession, legacy, or gift is acquired, not for the\r\nusufructuary, but for the owner. And a man who in good faith possesses a\r\nfree man or a slave belonging to another person has the same rights as\r\na usufructuary; what they acquire by any other mode than the two we have\r\nmentioned belongs in the one case to the free man, in the other to the\r\nslave's real master. After a possessor in good faith has acquired the\r\nownership of a slave by usucapion, everything which the slave acquires\r\nbelongs to him without distinction; but a fructuary cannot acquire\r\nownership of a slave in this way, because in the first place he does not\r\npossess the slave at all, but has merely a right of usufruct in him,\r\nand because in the second place he is aware of the existence of another\r\nowner. Moreover, you can acquire possession as well as ownership through\r\nslaves in whom you have a usufruct or whom you possess in good faith,\r\nand through free persons whom in good faith you believe to be your\r\nslaves, though as regards all these classes we must be understood to\r\nspeak with strict reference to the distinction drawn above, and to mean\r\nonly detention which they have obtained by means of your property or\r\ntheir own work.\r\n\r\n5 From this it appears that free men not subject to your power, or whom\r\nyou do not possess in good faith, and other persons' slaves, of whom\r\nyou are neither usufructuaries nor just possessors, cannot under any\r\ncircumstances acquire for you; and this is the meaning of the maxim\r\nthat a man cannot be the means of acquiring anything for one who is\r\na stranger in relation to him. To this maxim there is but one\r\nexception--namely, that, as is ruled in a constitution of the Emperor\r\nSeverus, a free person, such as a general agent, can acquire possession\r\nfor you, and that not only when you know, but even when you do not know\r\nof the fact of the acquisition: and through this possession ownership\r\ncan be immediately acquired also, if it was the owner who delivered the\r\nthing; and if it was not, it can be acquired ultimately by usucapion or\r\nby the plea of long possession.\r\n\r\n6 So much at present concerning the modes of acquiring rights over\r\nsingle things: for direct and fiduciary bequests, which are also among\r\nsuch modes, will find a more suitable place in a later portion of our\r\ntreatise. We proceed therefore to the titles whereby an aggregate of\r\nrights is acquired. If you become the successors, civil or praetorian,\r\nof a person deceased, or adopt an independent person by adrogation, or\r\nbecome assignees of a deceased's estate in order to secure their liberty\r\nto slaves manumitted by his will, the whole estate of those persons is\r\ntransferred to you in an aggregate mass. Let us begin with inheritances,\r\nwhose mode of devolution is twofold, according as a person dies testate\r\nor intestate; and of these two modes we will first treat of acquisition\r\nby will. The first point which here calls for exposition is the mode in\r\nwhich wills are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE X. OF THE EXECUTION OF WILLS\r\n\r\nThe term testament is derived from two words which mean a signifying of\r\nintention.\r\n\r\n1 Lest the antiquities of this branch of law should be entirely\r\nforgotten, it should be known that originally two kinds of testaments\r\nwere in use, one of which our ancestors employed in times of peace and\r\nquiet, and which was called the will made in the comitia calata, while\r\nthe other was resorted to when they were setting out to battle, and was\r\ncalled procinctum. More recently a third kind was introduced, called the\r\nwill by bronze and balance, because it was made by mancipation, which\r\nwas a sort of fictitious sale, in the presence of five witnesses and a\r\nbalance holder, all Roman citizens above the age of puberty, together\r\nwith the person who was called the purchaser of the family. The two\r\nfirst-mentioned kinds of testament, however, went out of use even in\r\nancient times, and even the third, or will by bronze and balance, though\r\nit has remained in vogue longer than they, has become partly disused.\r\n\r\n2 All these three kinds of will which we have mentioned belonged to the\r\ncivil law, but later still a fourth form was introduced by the praetor's\r\nedict; for the new law of the praetor, or ius honorarium, dispensed\r\nwith mancipation, and rested content with the seals of seven witnesses,\r\nwhereas the seals of witnesses were not required by the civil law.\r\n\r\n3 When, however, by a gradual process the civil and praetorian\r\nlaws, partly by usage, partly by definite changes introduced by the\r\nconstitution, came to be combined into a harmonious whole, it was\r\nenacted that a will should be valid which was wholly executed at one\r\ntime and in the presence of seven witnesses (these two points being\r\nrequired, in a way, by the old civil law), to which the witnesses\r\nsigned their names--a new formality imposed by imperial legislation--and\r\naffixed their seals, as had been required by the praetor's edict. Thus\r\nthe present law of testament seems to be derived from three distinct\r\nsources; the witnesses, and the necessity of their all being present\r\ncontinuously through the execution of the will in order that the\r\nexecution may be valid, coming from the civil law: the signing of\r\nthe document by the testator and the witnesses being due to imperial\r\nconstitutions, and the exact number of witnesses, and the sealing of the\r\nwill by them, to the praetor's edict.\r\n\r\n4 An additional requirement imposed by our constitution, in order to\r\nsecure the genuineness of testaments and prevent forgery, is that\r\nthe name of the heir shall be written by either the testator or the\r\nwitnesses, and generally that everything shall be done according to the\r\ntenor of that enactment.\r\n\r\n5 The witnesses may all seal the testament with the same seal; for, as\r\nPomponius remarks, what if the device on all seven seals were the same?\r\nIt is also lawful for a witness to use a seal belonging to another\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n6 Those persons only can be witnesses who are legally capable of\r\nwitnessing a testament. Women, persons below the age of puberty, slaves,\r\nlunatics, persons dumb or deaf, and those who have been interdicted from\r\nthe management of their property, or whom the law declares worthless and\r\nunfitted to perform this office, cannot witness a will.\r\n\r\n7 In cases where one of the witnesses to a will was thought free at the\r\ntime of its execution, but was afterwards discovered to be a slave, the\r\nEmperor Hadrian, in his rescript to Catonius Verus, and afterwards the\r\nEmperors Severus and Antoninus declared that of their goodness they\r\nwould uphold such a will as validly made; for, at the time when it was\r\nsealed, this witness was admitted by all to be free, and, as such, had\r\nhad his civil position called in question by no man.\r\n\r\n8 A father and a son in his power, or two brothers who are both in the\r\npower of one father, can lawfully witness the same testament, for there\r\ncan be no harm in several persons of the same family witnessing together\r\nthe act of a man who is to them a stranger.\r\n\r\n9 No one, however, ought to be among the witnesses who is in the\r\ntestator's power, and if a son in power makes a will of military\r\npeculium after his discharge, neither his father nor any one in his\r\nfather's power is qualified to be a witness; for it is not allowed to\r\nsupport a will by the evidence of persons in the same family with the\r\ntestator.\r\n\r\n10 No will, again, can be witnessed by the person instituted heir, or\r\nby any one in his power, or by a father in whose power he is, or by a\r\nbrother under the power of the same father: for the execution of a will\r\nis considered at the present day to be purely and entirely a transaction\r\nbetween the testator and the heir. Through mistaken ideas on this matter\r\nthe whole law of testamentary evidence fell into confusion: for the\r\nancients, though they rejected the evidence of the purchaser of the\r\nfamily and of persons connected with him by the tie of power, allowed\r\na will to be witnessed by the heir and persons similarly connected with\r\nhim, though it must be admitted that they accompanied this privilege\r\nwith urgent cautions against its abuse. We have, however, amended this\r\nrule, and enacted in the form of law what the ancients expressed in the\r\nform only of advice, by assimilating the heir to the old purchaser of\r\nthe family, and have rightly forbidden the heir, who now represents that\r\ncharacter, and all other persons connected with him by the tie referred\r\nto, to bear witness in a matter in which, in a sense, they would be\r\nwitnesses in their own behalf. Accordingly, we have not allowed earlier\r\nconstitutions on this subject to be inserted in our Code.\r\n\r\n11 Legatees, and persons who take a benefit under a will by way of\r\ntrust, and those connected with them, we have not forbidden to be\r\nwitnesses, because they are not universal successors of the deceased:\r\nindeed, by one of our constitutions we have specially granted this\r\nprivilege to them, and, a fortiori, to persons in their power, or in\r\nwhose power they are.\r\n\r\n12 It is immaterial whether the will be written on a tablet, paper,\r\nparchment, or any other substance: and a man may execute any number of\r\nduplicates of his will, for this is sometimes necessary, though in each\r\nof them the usual formalities must be observed. For instance, a person\r\nsetting out upon a voyage may wish to take a statement of his last\r\nwishes along with him, and also to leave one at home; and numberless\r\nother circumstances which happen to a man, and over which he has no\r\ncontrol, will make this desirable.\r\n\r\n14 So far of written wills. When, however, one wishes to make a will\r\nbinding by the civil law, but not in writing, he may summon seven\r\nwitnesses, and in their presence orally declare his wishes; this, it\r\nshould be observed, being a form of will which has been declared by\r\nconstitutions to be perfectly valid by civil law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XI. OF SOLDIERS' WILLS\r\n\r\nSoldiers, in consideration of their extreme ignorance of law, have\r\nbeen exempted by imperial constitutions from the strict rules for the\r\nexecution of a testament which have been described. Neither the legal\r\nnumber of witnesses, nor the observance of the other rules which have\r\nbeen stated, is necessary to give force to their wills, provided, that\r\nis to say, that they are made by them while on actual service; this\r\nlast qualification being a new though wise one introduced by our\r\nconstitution. Thus, in whatever mode a soldier's last wishes are\r\ndeclared, whether in writing or orally, this is a binding will, by force\r\nof his mere intention. At times, however, when they are not employed\r\non actual service, but are living at home or elsewhere, they are not\r\nallowed to claim this privilege: they may make a will, even though they\r\nbe sons in power, in virtue of their service, but they must observe the\r\nordinary rules, and are bound by the forms which we described above as\r\nrequisite in the execution of wills of civilians.\r\n\r\n1 Respecting the testaments of soldiers the Emperor Trajan sent a\r\nrescript to Statilius Severus in the following terms: 'The privilege\r\nallowed to soldiers of having their wills upheld, in whatever manner\r\nthey are made, must be understood to be limited by the necessity of\r\nfirst proving that a will has been made at all; for a will can be made\r\nwithout writing even by civilians. Accordingly, with reference to the\r\ninheritance which is the subject of the action before you, if it can be\r\nshown that the soldier who left it, did in the presence of witnesses,\r\ncollected expressly for this purpose, declare orally who he wished to be\r\nhis heir, and on what slaves he wished to confer liberty, it may well\r\nbe maintained that in this way he made an unwritten testament, and his\r\nwishes therein declared ought to be carried out. But if, as is so common\r\nin ordinary conversation, he said to some one, I make you my heir, or, I\r\nleave you all my property, such expressions cannot be held to amount to\r\na testament, and the interest of the very soldiers, who are privileged\r\nin the way described, is the principal ground for rejecting such a\r\nprecedent. For if it were admitted, it would be easy, after a soldier's\r\ndeath, to procure witnesses to affirm that they had heard him say he\r\nleft his property to any one they pleased to name, and in this way it\r\nwould be impossible to discover the true intentions of the deceased.'\r\n\r\n2 A soldier too may make a will though dumb and deaf.\r\n\r\n3 This privilege, however, which we have said soldiers enjoy, is allowed\r\nthem by imperial constitutions only while they are engaged on actual\r\nservice, and in camp life. Consequently, if veterans wish to make a will\r\nafter their discharge, or if soldiers actually serving wish to do this\r\naway from camp, they must observe the forms prescribed for all\r\ncitizens by the general law; and a testament executed in camp without\r\nformalities, that is to say, not according to the form prescribed by\r\nlaw, will remain valid only for one year after the testator's discharge.\r\nSupposing then that the testator died within a year, but that a\r\ncondition, subject to which the heir was instituted, was not fulfilled\r\nwithin the year, would it be feigned that the testator was a soldier at\r\nthe date of his decease, and the testament consequently upheld? and this\r\nquestion we answer in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n4 If a man, before going on actual service, makes an invalid will,\r\nand then during a campaign opens it, and adds some new disposition, or\r\ncancels one already made, or in some other way makes it clear that he\r\nwishes it to be his testament, it must be pronounced valid, as being, in\r\nfact, a new will made by the man as a soldier.\r\n\r\n5 Finally, if a soldier is adrogated, or, being a son in power, is\r\nemancipated, his previously executed will remains good by the fiction\r\nof a new expression of his wishes as a soldier, and is not deemed to be\r\navoided by his loss of status.\r\n\r\n6 It is, however, to be observed that earlier statutes and imperial\r\nconstitutions allowed to children in power in certain cases a civil\r\npeculium after the analogy of the military peculium, which for that\r\nreason was called quasimilitary, and of which some of them were\r\npermitted to dispose by will even while under power. By an extension\r\nof this principle our constitution has allowed all persons who have a\r\npeculium of this special kind to dispose of it by will, though subject\r\nto the ordinary forms of law. By a perusal of this constitution the\r\nwhole law relating to this privilege may be ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XII. OF PERSONS INCAPABLE OF MAKING WILLS\r\n\r\nCertain persons are incapable of making a lawful will. For instance,\r\nthose in the power of others are so absolutely incapable that they\r\ncannot make a testament even with the permission of their parents, with\r\nthe exception of those whom we have enumerated, and particularly of\r\nchildren in power who are soldiers, and who are permitted by imperial\r\nconstitution to dispose by will of all they may acquire while on actual\r\nservice. This was allowed at first only to soldiers on active service,\r\nby the authority of the Emperors Augustus and Nerva, and of the\r\nillustrious Emperor Trajan; afterwards, it was extended by an enactment\r\nof the Emperor Hadrian to veterans, that is, soldiers who had received\r\ntheir discharge. Accordingly, if a son in power makes a will of his\r\nmilitary peculium, it will belong to the person whom he institutes\r\nas heir: but if he dies intestate, leaving no children or brothers\r\nsurviving him, it will go to the parent in whose power he is, according\r\nto the ordinary rule. From this it can be understood that a parent\r\nhas no power to deprive a son in his power of what he has acquired on\r\nservice, nor can the parent's creditors sell or otherwise touch it; and\r\nwhen the parent dies it is not shared between the soldier's son and\r\nhis brothers, but belongs to him alone, although by the civil law the\r\npeculium of a person in power is always reckoned as part of the property\r\nof the parent, exactly as that of a slave is deemed part of the property\r\nof his master, except of course such property of the son as by imperial\r\nconstitutions, and especially our own, the parent is unable to acquire\r\nin absolute ownership. Consequently, if a son in power, not having a\r\nmilitary or quasimilitary peculium, makes a will, it is invalid, even\r\nthough he is released from power before his decease.\r\n\r\n1 Again, a person under the age of puberty is incapable of making a\r\nwill, because he has no judgement, and so too is a lunatic, because he\r\nhas lost his reason; and it is immaterial that the one reaches the age\r\nof puberty, and the other recovers his faculties, before his decease.\r\nIf, however, a lunatic makes a will during a lucid interval, the will\r\nis deemed valid, and one is certainly valid which he made before he\r\nlost his reason: for subsequent insanity never avoids a duly executed\r\ntestament or any other disposition validly made.\r\n\r\n2 So too a spendthrift, who is interdicted from the management of his\r\nown affairs, is incapable of making a valid will, though one made by him\r\nbefore being so interdicted holds good.\r\n\r\n3 The deaf, again, and the dumb cannot always make a will, though here\r\nwe are speaking not of persons merely hard of hearing, but of total\r\ndeafness, and similarly by a dumb person is meant one totally dumb, and\r\nnot one who merely speaks with difficulty; for it often happens that\r\neven men of culture and learning by some cause or other lose the\r\nfaculties of speech and hearing. Hence relief has been afforded them by\r\nour constitution, which enables them, in certain cases and in certain\r\nmodes therein specified, to make a will and other lawful dispositions.\r\nIf a man, after making his will, becomes deaf or dumb through ill health\r\nor any other cause, it remains valid notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n4 A blind man cannot make a will, except by observing the forms\r\nintroduced by a law of our imperial father Justin.\r\n\r\n5 A will made by a prisoner while in captivity with the enemy is\r\ninvalid, even though he subsequently returns. One made, however,\r\nwhile he was in his own state is valid, if he returns, by the law of\r\npostliminium; if he dies in captivity it is valid by the lex Cornelia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XIII. OF THE DISINHERISON OF CHILDREN\r\n\r\nThe law, however, is not completely satisfied by the observance of the\r\nrules hereinbefore explained. A testator who has a son in his power must\r\ntake care either to institute him heir, or to specially disinherit him,\r\nfor passing him over in silence avoids the will; and this rule is so\r\nstrict, that even if the son die in the lifetime of the father no heir\r\ncan take under the will, because of its original nullity. As regards\r\ndaughters and other descendants of either sex by the male line, the\r\nancients did not observe this rule in all its strictness; for if these\r\npersons were neither instituted nor disinherited, the will was not\r\navoided, but they were entitled to come in with the instituted heirs,\r\nand to take a certain portion of the inheritance. And these persons the\r\nascendant was not obliged to specially disinherit; he could disinherit\r\nthem collectively by a general clause.\r\n\r\n1 Special disinherison may be expressed in these terms--'Be Titius\r\nmy son disinherited,' or in these, 'Be my son disinherited,' without\r\ninserting the name, supposing there is no other son. Children born\r\nafter the making of the will must also be either instituted heirs or\r\ndisinherited, and in this respect are similarly privileged, that if a\r\nson or any other family heir, male or female, born after the making of\r\nthe will, be passed over in silence, the will, though originally valid,\r\nis invalidated by the subsequent birth of the child, and so becomes\r\ncompletely void. Consequently, if the woman from whom a child was\r\nexpected to have an abortive delivery, there is nothing to prevent the\r\ninstituted heirs from taking the inheritance. It was immaterial\r\nwhether the female family heirs born after the making of the will were\r\ndisinherited specially or by a general clause, but if the latter mode be\r\nadopted, some legacy must be left them in order that they may not seem\r\nto have been passed over merely through inadvertence: but male\r\nfamily heirs born after the making of the will, sons and other lineal\r\ndescendants, are held not to be properly disinherited unless they are\r\ndisinherited specially, thus: 'Be any son that shall be born to me\r\ndisinherited.'\r\n\r\n2 With children born after the making of the will are classed children\r\nwho succeed to the place of a family heir, and who thus, by an event\r\nanalogous to subsequent birth, become family heirs to an ancestor.\r\nFor instance, if a testator have a son, and by him a grandson or\r\ngranddaughter in his power, the son alone, being nearer in degree,\r\nhas the right of a family heir, although the grandchildren are in the\r\ntestator's power equally with him. But if the son die in the testator's\r\nlifetime, or is in some other way released from his power, the\r\ngrandson and granddaughter succeed to his place, and thus, by a kind of\r\nsubsequent birth, acquire the rights of family heirs. To prevent this\r\nsubsequent avoidance of one's will, grandchildren by a son must be\r\neither instituted heirs or disinherited, exactly as, to secure the\r\noriginal validity of a testament, a son must be either instituted or\r\nspecially disinherited; for if the son die in the testator's lifetime,\r\nthe grandson and granddaughter take his place, and avoid the will just\r\nas if they were children born after its execution. And this disinherison\r\nwas first allowed by the lex Iunia Vallaea, which explains the form\r\nwhich is to be used, and which resembles that employed in disinheriting\r\nfamily heirs born after the making of a will.\r\n\r\n3 It is not necessary, by the civil law, to either institute or\r\ndisinherit emancipated children, because they are not family heirs. But\r\nthe praetor requires all, females as well as males, unless instituted,\r\nto be disinherited, males specially, females collectively; and if they\r\nare neither appointed heirs nor disinherited as described, the praetor\r\npromises them possession of goods against the will.\r\n\r\n4 Adopted children, so long as they are in the power of their adoptive\r\nfather, are in precisely the same legal position as children born\r\nin lawful wedlock; consequently they must be either instituted or\r\ndisinherited according to the rules stated for the disinherison of\r\nnatural children. When, however, they have been emancipated by their\r\nadoptive father, they are no longer regarded as his children either\r\nby the civil law or by the praetor's edict. Conversely, in relation to\r\ntheir natural father, so long as they remain in the adoptive family they\r\nare strangers, so that he need neither institute nor disinherit them:\r\nbut when emancipated by their adoptive father, they have the same rights\r\nin the succession to their natural father as they would have had if it\r\nhad been he by whom they were emancipated. Such was the law introduced\r\nby our predecessors.\r\n\r\n5 Deeming, however, that between the sexes, to each of which nature\r\nassigns an equal share in perpetuating the race of man, there is in this\r\nmatter no real ground of distinction, and marking that, by the ancient\r\nstatute of the Twelve Tables, all were called equally to the succession\r\non the death of their ancestor intestate (which precedent the praetors\r\nalso seem to have subsequently followed), we have by our constitution\r\nintroduced a simple system of the same kind, applying uniformly to sons,\r\ndaughters, and other descendants by the male line, whether born before\r\nor after the making of the will. This requires that all children,\r\nwhether family heirs or emancipated, shall be specially disinherited,\r\nand declares that their pretermission shall have the effect of avoiding\r\nthe will of their parent, and depriving the instituted heirs of the\r\ninheritance, no less than the pretermission of children who are family\r\nheirs or who have been emancipated, whether already born, or born after,\r\nthough conceived before the making of the will. In respect of adoptive\r\nchildren we have introduced a distinction, which is explained in our\r\nconstitution on adoptions.\r\n\r\n6 If a soldier engaged on actual service makes a testament without\r\nspecially disinheriting his children, whether born before or after the\r\nmaking of the will, but simply passing over them in silence, though he\r\nknows that he has children, it is provided by imperial constitutions\r\nthat his silent pretermission of them shall be equivalent to special\r\ndisinherison.\r\n\r\n7 A mother or maternal grandfather is not bound to institute her or his\r\nchildren or grandchildren; they may simply omit them, for silence on the\r\npart of a mother, or of a maternal grandfather or other ascendant, has\r\nthe same effect as actual disinherison by a father. For neither by the\r\ncivil law, nor by that part of the praetor's edict in which he promises\r\nchildren who are passed over possession of goods against the will, is\r\na mother obliged to disinherit her son or daughter if she does not\r\ninstitute them heirs, or a maternal grandfather to be equally precise\r\nwith reference to grandchildren by a daughter: though such children and\r\ngrandchildren, if omitted, have another remedy, which will shortly be\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XIV. OF THE INSTITUTION OF THE HEIR\r\n\r\nA man may institute as his heirs either free men or slaves, and either\r\nhis own slaves or those of another man. If he wished to institute\r\nhis own slave it was formerly necessary, according to the more common\r\nopinion, that he should expressly give him his liberty in the will:\r\nbut now it is lawful, by our constitution, to institute one's own slave\r\nwithout this express manumission--a change not due to any spirit of\r\ninnovation, but to a sense of equity, and one whose principle was\r\napproved by Atilicinus, as it is stated by Seius in his books on\r\nMasurius Sabinus and on Plautius. Among a testator's own slaves is to be\r\nreckoned one of whom he is bare owner, the usufruct being vested in some\r\nother person. There is, however, one case in which the institution of a\r\nslave by his mistress is void, even though freedom be given him in\r\nthe will, as is provided by a constitution of the Emperors Severus and\r\nAntoninus in these terms: 'Reason demands that no slave, accused of\r\ncriminal intercourse with his mistress, shall be capable of being\r\nmanumitted, before his sentence is pronounced, by the will of the woman\r\nwho is accused of participating in his guilt: accordingly if he be\r\ninstituted heir by that mistress, the institution is void.' Among 'other\r\npersons' slaves' is reckoned one in whom the testator has a usufruct.\r\n\r\n1 If a slave is instituted heir by his own master, and continues in that\r\ncondition until his master's decease, he becomes by the will both free,\r\nand necessary heir. But if the testator himself manumits him in his\r\nlifetime, he may use his own discretion about acceptance; for he is not\r\na necessary heir, because, though he is named heir to the testament, it\r\nwas not by that testament that he became free. If he has been alienated,\r\nhe must have the order of his new master to accept, and then his master\r\nbecomes heir through him, while he personally becomes neither heir nor\r\nfree, even though his freedom was expressly given him in the testament,\r\nbecause by alienating him his former master is presumed to have\r\nrenounced the intention of enfranchising him. When another person's\r\nslave is instituted heir, if he continues in the same condition he\r\nmust have the order of his master to accept; if alienated by him in\r\nthe testator's lifetime, or after the testator's death but before\r\nacceptance, he must have the order of the alienee to accept; finally, if\r\nmanumitted in the testator's lifetime, or after the testator's death but\r\nbefore acceptance, he may accept or not at his own discretion.\r\n\r\n2 A slave who does not belong to the testator may be instituted heir\r\neven after his master's decease, because slaves who belong to an\r\ninheritance are capable of being instituted or made legatees; for an\r\ninheritance not yet accepted represents not the future heir but the\r\nperson deceased. Similarly, the slave of a child conceived but not yet\r\nborn may be instituted heir.\r\n\r\n3 If a slave belonging to two or more joint owners, both or all of whom\r\nare legally capable of being made heirs or legatees, is instituted heir\r\nby a stranger, he acquires the inheritance for each and all of the joint\r\nowners by whose orders he accepts it in proportion to the respective\r\nshares in which they own him.\r\n\r\n4 A testator may institute either a single heir, or as many as he\r\npleases.\r\n\r\n5 An inheritance is usually divided into twelve ounces, and is denoted\r\nin the aggregate by the term as, and each fraction of this aggregate,\r\nranging from the ounce up to the as or pound, has its specific name, as\r\nfollows: sextans (1/6), quadrans (1/4), triens (1/3), quincunx (5/12),\r\nsemis (1/2), septunx (7/12), bes (2/3), dodrans (3/4), dextans (5/6),\r\ndeunx (11/12), and as it is not necessary, however, that there\r\nshould always be twelve ounces, for for the purposes of testamentary\r\ndistribution an as may consist of as many ounces as the testator\r\npleases; for instance, if a testator institutes only a single heir,\r\nbut declares that he is to be heir ex semisse, or to one half of the\r\ninheritance, this half will really be the whole, for no one can die\r\npartly testate and partly intestate, except soldiers, in the carrying\r\nout of whose wills the intention is the only thing regarded. Conversely,\r\na testator may divide his inheritance into as large a number of ounces\r\nas he pleases.\r\n\r\n6 If more heirs than one are instituted, it is unnecessary for the\r\ntestator to assign a specific share in the inheritance to each, unless\r\nhe intends that they shall not take in equal portions; for it is obvious\r\nthat if no shares are specified they divide the inheritance equally\r\nbetween them. Supposing, however, that specific shares are assigned to\r\nall the instituted heirs except one, who is left without any express\r\nshare at all, this last heir will be entitled to any fraction of the as\r\nwhich has not been disposed of; and if there are two or more heirs\r\nto whom no specific shares have been assigned, they will divide this\r\nunassigned fraction equally between them. Finally, if the whole as has\r\nbeen assigned in specific shares to some of the heirs, the one or more\r\nwho have no specific shares take half of the inheritance, while the\r\nother half is divided among the rest according to the shares assigned to\r\nthem; and it is immaterial whether the heir who has no specified share\r\ncome first or last in the institution, or occupies some intermediate\r\nplace; for such share is presumed to be given to him as is not in some\r\nother way disposed of.\r\n\r\n7 Let us now see how the law stands if some part remains undisposed of,\r\nand yet each heir has his share assigned to him--if, for instance\r\nthere are three heirs instituted, and each is assigned a quarter of the\r\ninheritance. It is evident that in this case the part undisposed of will\r\ngo to them in proportion to the share each has assigned to him by\r\nthe will, and it will be exactly as if they had each been originally\r\ninstituted to a third. Conversely, if each heir is given so large a\r\nfraction that the as will be exceeded, each must suffer a proportionate\r\nabatement; thus if four heirs are instituted, and to each is assigned\r\na third of the inheritance, it will be the same as if each had been\r\noriginally instituted to a quarter.\r\n\r\n8 If more than twelve ounces are distributed among some of the heirs\r\nonly, one being left without a specific share, he will have what is\r\nwanting to complete the second as; and the same will be done if more\r\nthan twenty-four ounces are distributed, leaving him shareless; but all\r\nthese ideal sums are afterwards reduced to the single as, whatever be\r\nthe number of ounces they comprise.\r\n\r\n9 The institution of the heir may be either absolute or conditional, but\r\nno heir can be instituted from, or up to, some definite date, as, for\r\ninstance, in the following form--'be so and so my heir after five years\r\nfrom my decease,' or 'after the calends of such a month,' or 'up to and\r\nuntil such calends'; for a time limitation in a will is considered a\r\nsuperfluity, and an heir instituted subject to such a time limitation is\r\ntreated as heir absolutely.\r\n\r\n10 If the institution of an heir, a legacy, a fiduciary bequest, or a\r\ntestamentary manumission is made to depend on an impossible condition,\r\nthe condition is deemed unwritten, and the disposition absolute.\r\n\r\n11 If an institution is made to depend on two or more conditions,\r\nconjunctively expressed,--as, for instance, 'if this and that shall be\r\ndone'--all the conditions must be satisfied: if they are expressed\r\nin the alternative, or disjunctively--as 'if this or that shall be\r\ndone'--it is enough if one of them alone is satisfied.\r\n\r\n12 A testator may institute as his heir a person whom he has never seen,\r\nfor instance, nephews who have been born abroad and are unknown to him:\r\nfor want of this knowledge does not invalidate the institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XV. OF ORDINARY SUBSTITUTION\r\n\r\nA testator may institute his heirs, if he pleases, in two or more\r\ndegrees, as, for instance, in the following form: 'If A shall not be\r\nmy heir, then let B be my heir'; and in this way he can make as many\r\nsubstitutions as he likes, naming in the last place one of his own\r\nslaves as necessary heir, in default of all others taking.\r\n\r\n1 Several may be substituted in place of one, or one in place of\r\nseveral, or to each heir may be substituted a new and distinct person,\r\nor, finally, the instituted heirs may be substituted reciprocally in\r\nplace of one another.\r\n\r\n2 If heirs who are instituted in equal shares are reciprocally\r\nsubstituted to one another, and the shares which they are to have in\r\nthe substitution are not specified, it is presumed (as was settled by\r\na rescript of the Emperor Pius) that the testator intended them to take\r\nthe same shares in the substitution as they took directly under the\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n3 If a third person is substituted to one heir who himself is\r\nsubstituted to his coheir, the Emperors Severus and Antoninus decided\r\nby rescript that this third person is entitled to the shares of both\r\nwithout distinction.\r\n\r\n4 If a testator institutes another man's slave, supposing him to be an\r\nindependent person, and substitutes Maevius in his place to meet the\r\ncase of his not taking the inheritance, then, if the slave accepts\r\nby the order of his master, Maevius is entitled to a half. For, when\r\napplied to a person whom the testator knows to be in the power of\r\nanother, the words 'if he shall not be my heir' are taken to mean 'if\r\nhe shall neither be heir himself nor cause another to be heir'; but when\r\napplied to a person whom the testator supposes to be independent, they\r\nmean 'if he shall not acquire the inheritance either for himself, or for\r\nthat person to whose power he shall subsequently become subject,' and\r\nthis was decided by Tiberius Caesar in the case of his slave Parthenius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XVI. OF PUPILLARY SUBSTITUTION\r\n\r\nTo children below the age of puberty and in the power of the testator,\r\nnot only can such a substitute as we have described be appointed, that\r\nis, one who shall take on their failing to inherit, but also one who\r\nshall be their heir if, after inheriting, they die within the age of\r\npuberty; and this may be done in the following terms, 'Be my son Titius\r\nmy heir; and if he does not become my heir, or, after becoming my heir,\r\ndie before becoming his own master (that is, before reaching puberty),\r\nthen be Seius my heir.' In which case, if the son fails to inherit,\r\nthe substitute is the heir of the testator; but if the son, after\r\ninheriting, dies within the age of puberty, he is the heir of the son.\r\nFor it is a rule of customary law, that when our children are too young\r\nto make wills for themselves, their parents may make them for them.\r\n\r\n1 The reason of this rule has induced us to assert in our Code a\r\nconstitution, providing that if a testator has children, grandchildren,\r\nor greatgrandchildren who are lunatics or idiots, he may, after the\r\nanalogy of pupillary substitution, substitute certain definite persons\r\nto them, whatever their sex or the nearness of their relationship to\r\nhim, and even though they have reached the age of puberty; provided\r\nalways that on their recovering their faculties such substitution shall\r\nat once become void, exactly as pupillary substitution proper ceases to\r\nhave any operation after the pupil has reached puberty.\r\n\r\n2 Thus, in pupillary substitution effected in the form described, there\r\nare, so to speak, two wills, the father's and the son's, just as if the\r\nson had personally instituted an heir to himself; or rather, there is\r\none will dealing with two distinct matters, that is, with two distinct\r\ninheritances.\r\n\r\n3 If a testator be apprehensive that, after his own death, his son,\r\nwhile still a pupil, may be exposed to the danger of foul play, because\r\nanother person is openly substituted to him, he ought to make the\r\nordinary substitution openly, and in the earlier part of the testament,\r\nand write the other substitution, wherein a man is named heir on the\r\nsuccession and death of the pupil, separately on the lower part of the\r\nwill; and this lower part he should tie with a separate cord and fasten\r\nwith a separate seal, and direct in the earlier part of the will that it\r\nshall not be opened in the lifetime of the son before he attains the age\r\nof puberty. Of course a substitution to a son under the age of puberty\r\nis none the less valid because it is a integral part of the very will\r\nin which the testator has instituted him his heir, though such an open\r\nsubstitution may expose the pupil to the danger of foul play.\r\n\r\n4 Not only when we leave our inheritance to children under the age\r\nof puberty can we make such a substitution, that if they accept the\r\ninheritance, and then die under that age, the substitute is their heir,\r\nbut we can do it when we disinherit them, so that whatever the pupil\r\nacquires by way of inheritance, legacy or gift from his relatives or\r\nfriends, will pass to the substitute. What has been said of\r\nsubstitution to children below the age of puberty, whether instituted or\r\ndisinherited, is true also of substitution to afterborn children.\r\n\r\n5 In no case, however, may a man make a will for his children unless\r\nhe makes one also for himself; for the will of the pupil is but a\r\ncomplementary part of the father's own testament; accordingly, if the\r\nlatter is void, the former will be void also.\r\n\r\n6 Substitution may be made either to each child separately, or only to\r\nsuch one of them as shall last die under the age of puberty. The first\r\nis the proper plan, if the testator's intention is that none of them\r\nshall die intestate: the second, if he wishes that, as among them, the\r\norder of succession prescribed by the Twelve Tables shall be strictly\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\n7 The person substituted in the place of a child under the age of\r\npuberty may be either named individually--for instance, Titius--or\r\ngenerally prescribed, as by the words 'whoever shall be my heir'; in\r\nwhich latter case, on the child dying under the age of puberty,\r\nthose are called to the inheritance by the substitution who have been\r\ninstituted heirs and have accepted, their shares in the substitution\r\nbeing proportionate to the shares in which they succeeded the father.\r\n\r\n8 This kind of substitution may be made to males up to the age of\r\nfourteen, and to females up to that of twelve years; when this age is\r\nonce passed, the substitution becomes void.\r\n\r\n9 To a stranger, or a child above the age of puberty whom a man has\r\ninstituted heir, he cannot appoint a substitute to succeed him if he\r\ntake and die within a certain time: he has only the power to bind him by\r\na trust to convey the inheritance to another either wholly or in part;\r\nthe law relating to which subject will be explained in its proper place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XVII. OF THE MODES IN WHICH WILLS BECOME VOID\r\n\r\nA duly executed testament remains valid until either revoked or\r\nrescinded.\r\n\r\n1 A will is revoked when, though the civil condition of the testator\r\nremains unaltered, the legal force of the will itself is destroyed, as\r\nhappens when, after making his will, a man adopts as his son either an\r\nindependent person, in which case the adoption is effected by imperial\r\ndecree, or a person already in power, when it is done through the agency\r\nof the praetor according to our constitution. In both these cases the\r\nwill is revoked, precisely as it would be by the subsequent birth of a\r\nfamily heir.\r\n\r\n2 Again, a subsequent will duly executed is a revocation of a prior\r\nwill, and it makes no difference whether an heir ever actually takes\r\nunder it or not; the only question is whether one might conceivably have\r\ndone so. Accordingly, whether the person instituted declines to be heir,\r\nor dies in the lifetime of the testator, or after his death but before\r\naccepting the inheritance, or is excluded by failure of the condition\r\nunder which he was instituted--in all the cases the testator dies\r\nintestate; for the earlier will is revoked by the later one, and the\r\nlater one is inoperative, as no heir takes under it.\r\n\r\n3 If, after duly making one will, a man executes a second one which is\r\nequally valid, the Emperors Severus and Antoninus decided by rescript\r\nthat the first is revoked by the second, even though the heir instituted\r\nin the second is instituted to certain things only. The terms of this\r\nenactment we have ordered to be inserted here, because it contains\r\nanother provision. 'The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Cocceius\r\nCampanus. A second will, although the heir named therein be instituted\r\nto certain things only, is just as valid as if no mention of the things\r\nhad been made: but the heir is bound to content himself with the things\r\ngiven him, or with such further portion of the inheritance as will make\r\nup the fourth part to which he is entitled under the lex Falcidia, and\r\n(subject thereto) to transfer the inheritance to the persons instituted\r\nin the earlier will: for the words inserted in the later will\r\nundoubtedly contain the expression of a wish that the earlier one shall\r\nremain valid.' This accordingly is a mode in which a testament may be\r\nrevoked.\r\n\r\n4 There is another event by which a will duly executed may be\r\ninvalidated, namely, the testator's undergoing a loss of status: how\r\nthis may happen was explained in the preceding Book.\r\n\r\n5 In this case the will may be said to be rescinded, though both those\r\nthat are revoked, and those that are not duly executed, may be said to\r\nbecome or be rescinded; and similarly too those which are duly executed\r\nbut subsequently rescinded by loss of status may be said to be revoked.\r\nHowever, as it is convenient that different grounds of invalidity should\r\nhave different names to distinguish them, we say that some wills are\r\nunduly executed from the commencement, while others which are duly\r\nexecuted are either revoked or rescinded.\r\n\r\n6 Wills, however, which, though duly executed, are subsequently\r\nrescinded by the testator's undergoing loss of status are not altogether\r\ninoperative: for if the seals of seven witnesses are attached, the\r\ninstituted heir is entitled to demand possession in accordance with the\r\nwill, if only the testator were a citizen of Rome and independent at\r\nthe time of his decease; but if the cause of the rescission was\r\nthe testator's subsequent loss of citizenship or of freedom, or his\r\nadoption, and he dies an alien, or slave, or subject to his adoptive\r\nfather's power, the instituted heir is barred from demanding possession\r\nin accordance with the will.\r\n\r\n7 The mere desire of a testator that a will which he has executed shall\r\nno longer have any validity is not, by itself, sufficient to avoid\r\nit; so that, even if he begins to make a later will, which he does not\r\ncomplete because he either dies first, or changes his mind, the first\r\nwill remains good; it being provided in an address of the Emperor\r\nPertinax to the Senate that one testament which is duly executed is not\r\nrevoked by a later one which is not duly and completely executed; for an\r\nincomplete will is undoubtedly null.\r\n\r\n8 In the same address the Emperor declared that he would accept no\r\ninheritance to which he was made heir on account of a suit between the\r\ntestator and some third person, nor would he uphold a will in which he\r\nwas instituted in order to screen some legal defect in its execution,\r\nor accept an inheritance to which he was instituted merely by word of\r\nmouth, or take any testamentary benefit under a document defective in\r\npoint of law. And there are numerous rescripts of the Emperors Severus\r\nand Antoninus to the same purpose: 'for though,' they say, 'the laws do\r\nnot bind us, yet we live in obedience to them.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XVIII. OF AN UNDUTEOUS WILL\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the disinherison or omission by parents of their children\r\nhas generally no good reason, those children who complain that they have\r\nbeen wrongfully disinherited or passed over have been allowed to bring\r\nan action impeaching the will as unduteous, under the pretext that the\r\ntestator was of unsound mind at the time of its execution. This does\r\nnot mean that he was really insane, but that the will, though legally\r\nexecuted, bears no mark of that affection to which a child is entitled\r\nfrom a parent: for if a testator is really insane, his will is void.\r\n\r\n1 Parents may impeach the wills of their children as unduteous, as well\r\nas children those of their parents. Brothers and sisters of the testator\r\nare by imperial constitutions preferred to infamous persons who are\r\ninstituted to their exclusion, so that it is in these cases only that\r\nthey can bring this action. Persons related to the testator in a further\r\ndegree than as brothers or sisters can in no case bring the action, or\r\nat any rate succeed in it when brought.\r\n\r\n2 Children fully adopted, in accordance with the distinction drawn in\r\nour constitution, can bring this action as well as natural children, but\r\nneither can do so unless there is no other mode in which they can obtain\r\nthe property of the deceased: for those who can obtain the inheritance\r\nwholly or in part by any other title are barred from attacking a will as\r\nunduteous. Afterborn children too can employ this remedy, if they can by\r\nno other means recover the inheritance.\r\n\r\n3 That they may bring the action must be understood to mean, that\r\nthey may bring it only if absolutely nothing has been left them by the\r\ntestator in his will: a restriction introduced by our constitution out\r\nof respect for a father's natural rights. If, however, a part of the\r\ninheritance, however small, or even a single thing is left them, the\r\nwill cannot be impeached, but the heir must, if necessary, make up what\r\nis given them to a fourth of what they would have taken had the testator\r\ndied intestate, even though the will does not direct that this fourth is\r\nto be made up by the assessment of an honest and reliable man.\r\n\r\n4 If a guardian accepts, under his own father's will, a legacy on behalf\r\nof the pupil under his charge, the father having left nothing to him\r\npersonally, he is in no way debarred from impeaching his father's will\r\nas unduteous on his own account.\r\n\r\n5 On the other hand, if he impeaches the will of his pupil's father on\r\nthe pupil's behalf, because nothing has been left to the latter, and is\r\ndefeated in the action, he does not lose a legacy given in the same will\r\nto himself personally.\r\n\r\n6 Accordingly, that a person may be barred from the action impeaching\r\nthe will, it is requisite that he should have a fourth of what he would\r\nhave taken on intestacy, either as heir, legatee direct or fiduciary,\r\ndonee in contemplation of death, by gift from the testator in his\r\nlifetime (though gift of this latter kind bars the action only if made\r\nunder any of the circumstances mentioned in our constitution) or in any\r\nof the other modes stated in the imperial legislation.\r\n\r\n7 In what we have said of the fourth we must be understood to mean that\r\nwhether there be one person only, or more than one, who can impeach the\r\nwill as unduteous, onefourth of the whole inheritance may be given them,\r\nto be divided among them all proportionately, that is to say, to each\r\nperson a fourth of what he would have had if the testator had died\r\nintestate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XIX. OF THE KINDS AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HEIRS\r\n\r\nHeirs are of three kinds, that is to say, they are either necessary,\r\nfamily heirs and necessary, or external.\r\n\r\n1 A necessary heir is a slave of the testator, whom he institutes as\r\nheir: and he is so named because, willing or unwilling, and without\r\nany alternative, he becomes free and necessary heir immediately on the\r\ntestator's decease. For when a man's affairs are embarrassed, it is\r\ncommon for one of his slaves to be instituted in his will, either in\r\nthe first place, or as a substitute in the second or any later place, so\r\nthat, if the creditors are not paid in full, the heir may be insolvent\r\nrather than the testator, and his property, rather than the testator's,\r\nmay be sold by the creditors and divided among them. To balance this\r\ndisadvantage he has this advantage, that his acquisitions after the\r\ntestator's decease are for his own sole benefit; and although the estate\r\nof the deceased is insufficient to pay the creditors in full, the heir's\r\nsubsequent acquisitions are never on that account liable to a second\r\nsale.\r\n\r\n2 Heirs who are both family heirs and necessary are such as a son or a\r\ndaughter, a grandchild by a son, and further similar lineal descendants,\r\nprovided that they are in the ancestor's power at the time of his\r\ndecease. To make a grandson or granddaughter a family heir it is,\r\nhowever, not sufficient for them to be in the grandfather's power at\r\nthe moment of his decease: it is further requisite that their own father\r\nshall, in the lifetime of the grandfather, have ceased to be the family\r\nheir himself, whether by death or by any other mode of release from\r\npower: for by this event the grandson and granddaughter succeed to the\r\nplace of their father. They are called family heirs, because they are\r\nheirs of the house, and even in the lifetime of the parent are to a\r\ncertain extent deemed owners of the inheritance: wherefore in intestacy\r\nthe first right of succession belongs to the children. They are called\r\nnecessary heirs because they have no alternative, but, willing or\r\nunwilling, both where there is a will and where there is not, they\r\nbecome heirs. The praetor, however, permits them, if they wish, to\r\nabstain from the inheritance, and leave the parent to become insolvent\r\nrather than themselves.\r\n\r\n3 Those who are not subject to the testator's power are called external\r\nheirs. Thus children of ours who are not in our power, if instituted\r\nheirs by us, are deemed external heirs; and children instituted by their\r\nmother belong to this class, because women never have children in\r\ntheir power. Slaves instituted heirs by their masters, and manumitted\r\nsubsequently to the execution of the will, belong to the same class.\r\n\r\n4 It is necessary that external heirs should have testamentary capacity,\r\nwhether it is an independent person, or some one in his power, who is\r\ninstituted: and this capacity is required at two times; at the same time\r\nof the making of the will, when, without it, the institution would be\r\nvoid; and at the same time of the testator's decease, when, without\r\nit, the institution would have no effect. Moreover, the instituted\r\nheir ought to have this capacity also at the time when he accepts\r\nthe inheritance, whether he is instituted absolutely or subject to a\r\ncondition; and indeed it is especially at this time that his capacity to\r\ntake ought to be looked to. If, however, the instituted heir undergoes\r\na loss of status in the interval between the making of the will and\r\nthe testator's decease, or the satisfaction of the condition subject to\r\nwhich he was instituted, he is not thereby prejudiced: for, as we\r\nsaid, there are only three points of time which have to be regarded.\r\nTestamentary capacity thus does not mean merely capacity to make a will;\r\nit also means capacity to take for oneself, or for the father or master\r\nin whose power one is, under the will of another person: and this latter\r\nkind of testamentary capacity is quite independent of the capacity to\r\nmake a will oneself. Accordingly, even lunatics, deaf persons, afterborn\r\nchildren, infants, children in power, and other persons' slaves are said\r\nto have testamentary capacity; for though they cannot make a valid will,\r\nthey can acquire for themselves or for another under a will made by\r\nsomeone else.\r\n\r\n5 External heirs have the privilege of deliberating whether they will\r\naccept or disclaim an inheritance. But if a person who is entitled\r\nto disclaim interferes with the inheritance, or if one who has the\r\nprivilege of deliberation accepts it, he no longer has the power of\r\nrelinquishing it, unless he is a minor under the age of twentyfive\r\nyears, for minors obtain relief from the praetor when they incautiously\r\naccept a disadvantageous inheritance, as well as when they take any\r\nother injudicious step.\r\n\r\n6 It is, however, to be observed that the Emperor Hadrian once relieved\r\neven a person who had attained his majority, when, after his accepting\r\nthe inheritance, a great debt, unknown at the time of acceptance, had\r\ncome to light. This was but the bestowal of an especial favour on\r\na single individual; the Emperor Gordian subsequently extended the\r\nprivilege, but only to soldiers, to whom it was granted as a class. We,\r\nhowever, in our benevolence have placed this benefit within the reach of\r\nall our subjects, and drafted a constitution as just as it is splendid,\r\nunder which, if heirs will but observe its terms, they can accept an\r\ninheritance without being liable to creditors and legatees beyond the\r\nvalue of the property. Thus so far as their liability is concerned there\r\nis no need for them to deliberate on acceptance, unless they fail to\r\nobserve the procedure of our constitution, and prefer deliberation, by\r\nwhich they will remain liable to all the risks of acceptance under the\r\nolder law.\r\n\r\n7 An external heir, whether his right accrue to him under a will or\r\nunder the civil law of intestate succession, can take the inheritance\r\neither by acting as heir, or by the mere intention to accept. By acting\r\nas heir is mean, for instance, using things belonging to the inheritance\r\nas one's own, or selling them, or cultivating or giving leases of the\r\ndeceased's estates, provided only one expresses in any way whatsoever,\r\nby deed or word, one's intention to accept the inheritance, so long as\r\none knows that the person with whose property one is thus dealing has\r\ndied testate or intestate, and that one is that person's heir. To act as\r\nheir, in fact, is to act as owner, and the ancients often used the term\r\n'heir' as equivalent to the term 'owner.' And just as the mere intention\r\nto accept makes an external heir heir, so too the mere determination not\r\nto accept bars him from the inheritance. Nothing prevents a person who\r\nis born deaf or dumb, or who becomes so after birth, from acting as heir\r\nand thus acquiring the inheritance, provided only he knows what he is\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XX. OF LEGACIES\r\n\r\nLet us now examine legacies:--a kind of title which seems foreign to\r\nthe matter at hand, for we are expounding titles whereby aggregates of\r\nrights are acquired; but as we have treated in full of wills and heirs\r\nappointed by will, it was natural in close connexion therewith to\r\nconsider this mode of acquisition.\r\n\r\n1 Now a legacy is a kind of gift left by a person deceased;\r\n\r\n2 and formerly they were of four kinds, namely, legacy by vindication,\r\nby condemnation, by permission, and by preception, to each of which a\r\ndefinite form of words was appropriated by which it was known, and which\r\nserved to distinguish it from legacies of the other kinds. Solemn\r\nforms of words of this sort, however, have been altogether abolished by\r\nimperial constitutions; and we, desiring to give greater effect to the\r\nwishes of deceased persons, and to interpret their expressions with\r\nreference rather to those wishes than to their strict literal meaning,\r\nhave issued a constitution, composed after great reflection, enacting\r\nthat in future there shall be but one kind of legacy, and that, whatever\r\nbe the terms in which the bequest is couched, the legatee may sue for\r\nit no less by real or hypothecary than by personal action. How carefully\r\nand wisely this constitution is worded may be ascertained by a perusal\r\nof its contents.\r\n\r\n3 We have determined, however, to go even beyond this enactment; for,\r\nobserving that the ancients subjected legacies to strict rules, while\r\nthe rules which they applied to fiduciary bequests, as springing more\r\ndirectly from the deceased person's wishes, were more liberal, we have\r\ndeemed it necessary to assimilate the former completely to the latter,\r\nso that any future features in which legacies are inferior to fiduciary\r\nbequests may be supplied to them from the latter, and the latter\r\nthemselves may in future possess any superiority which has hitherto\r\nbeen enjoyed by legacies only. In order, however, to avoid perplexing\r\nstudents in their first essays in the law by discussing these two forms\r\nof bequests together, we have thought it worth while to treat them\r\nseparately, dealing first with legacies, and then with fiduciary\r\nbequests, so that the reader, having first learnt their respective\r\nnatures in a separate treatment, may, when his legal education is more\r\nadvanced, be able easily to comprehend their treatment in combination.\r\n\r\n4 A legacy may be given not only of things belonging to the testator\r\nor heir, but also of things belonging to a third person, the heir being\r\nbound by the will to buy and deliver them to the legatee, or to give him\r\ntheir value if the owner is unwilling to sell them. If the thing given\r\nbe one of those of which private ownership is impossible, such, for\r\ninstance, as the Campus Martius, a basilica, a church, or a thing\r\ndevoted to public use, not even its value can be claimed, for the legacy\r\nis void. In saying that a thing belonging to a third person may be given\r\nas a legacy we must be understood to mean that this may be done if the\r\ndeceased knew that it belonged to a third person, and not if he was\r\nignorant of this: for perhaps he would never have given the legacy if\r\nhe had known that the thing belonged neither to him nor to the heir, and\r\nthere is a rescript of the Emperor Pius to this effect. It is also the\r\nbetter opinion that the plaintiff, that is the legatee, must prove that\r\nthe deceased knew he was giving as a legacy a thing which was not his\r\nown, rather than that the heir must prove the contradictory: for the\r\ngeneral rule of law is that the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff.\r\n\r\n5 If the thing which a testator bequests is in pledge to a creditor,\r\nthe heir is obliged to redeem it, subject to the same distinction as has\r\nbeen drawn with reference to a legacy of a thing not belonging to\r\nthe testator; that is to say, the heir is bound to redeem only if the\r\ndeceased knew the thing to be in pledge: and the Emperors Severus and\r\nAntoninus have decided this by rescript. If, however, the deceased\r\nexpresses his intention that the legatee should redeem the thing\r\nhimself, the heir is under no obligation to do it for him.\r\n\r\n6 If a legacy is given of a thing belonging to another person, and the\r\nlegatee becomes its owner during the testator's lifetime by purchase,\r\nhe can obtain its value from the heir by action on the will: but if he\r\ngives no consideration for it, that is to say, gets it by way of gift or\r\nby some similar title, he cannot sue; for it is settled law that where\r\na man has already got a thing, giving no consideration in return, he\r\ncannot get its value by a second title of the same kind. Accordingly, if\r\na man is entitled to claim a thing under each of two distinct wills, it\r\nis material whether he gets the thing, or merely its value, under the\r\nearlier one: for if he gets the thing itself, he cannot sue under\r\nthe second will, because he already has the thing without giving any\r\nconsideration, whereas he has a good right of action if he has merely\r\ngot its value.\r\n\r\n7 A thing which does not yet exist, but will exist, may be validly\r\nbequeathed:--for instance, the produce of such and such land, or the\r\nchild of such and such female slave.\r\n\r\n8 If the same thing is given as a legacy to two persons, whether jointly\r\nor severally, and both claim it, each is entitled to only a half; if one\r\nof them does not claim it, because either he does not care for it, or\r\nhas died in the testator's lifetime, or for some other reason, the whole\r\ngoes to his colegatee. A joint legacy is given in such words as the\r\nfollowing: 'I give and bequeath my slave Stichus to Titius and Seius': a\r\nseveral legacy thus, 'I give and bequeath my slave Stichus to Titius: I\r\ngive and bequeath Stichus to Seius': and even if the testator says 'the\r\nsame slave Stichus' the legacy is still a several one.\r\n\r\n9 If land be bequeathed which belongs to some one other than the\r\ntestator, and the intended legatee, after purchasing the bare ownership\r\ntherein, obtains the usufruct without consideration, and then sues under\r\nthe will, Julian says that this action for the land is well grounded,\r\nbecause in a real action for land a usufruct is regarded merely as a\r\nservitude; but it is part of the duty of the judge to deduct the value\r\nof the usufruct from the sum which he directs to be paid as the value of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n10 A legacy by which something already belonging to the legatee is given\r\nhim is void, for what is his own already cannot become more his own\r\nthan it is: and even though he alienates it before the testator's death,\r\nneither it nor its value can be claimed.\r\n\r\n11 If a testator bequeaths something belonging to him, but which he\r\nthought belonged to another person, the legacy is good, for its validity\r\ndepends not on what he thought, but on the real facts of the case: and\r\nit is clearly good if he thought it already belonged to the legatee,\r\nbecause his expressed wish can thus be carried out.\r\n\r\n12 If, after making his will, a testator alienates property which he has\r\ntherein given away as a legacy, Celsus is of opinion that the legatee\r\nmay still claim it unless the testator's intention was thereby to\r\nrevoke the bequest, and there is a rescript of the Emperors Severus\r\nand Antoninus to this effect, as well as another which decides that\r\nif, after making his will, a testator pledges land which he had therein\r\ngiven as a legacy, the part which has not been alienated can in any case\r\nbe claimed, and the alienated part as well if the alienator's intention\r\nwas not to revoke the legacy.\r\n\r\n13 If a man bequeaths to his debtor a discharge from his debt, the\r\nlegacy is good, and the testator's heir cannot sue either the debtor\r\nhimself, or his heir, or any one who occupies the position of heir to\r\nhim, and the debtor can even compel the testator's heir to formally\r\nrelease him. Moreover, a testator can also forbid his heir to claim\r\npayment of a debt before a certain time has elapsed.\r\n\r\n14 Contrariwise, if a debtor leaves his creditor a legacy of what he\r\nowes him, the legacy is void, if it includes no more than the debt,\r\nfor the creditor is thus in no way benefited; but if the debtor\r\nunconditionally bequeaths a sum of money which the creditor cannot claim\r\nuntil a definite date has arrived or a condition has been satisfied, the\r\nlegacy is good, because it confers on the creditor a right to earlier\r\npayment. And, even if the day arrives, or the condition is satisfied,\r\nduring the testator's lifetime, Papinian decides, and rightly, that\r\nthe legacy is nevertheless a good one, because it was good when first\r\nwritten; for the opinion that a legacy becomes void, because something\r\nhappens to deprive it of all material effect, is now rejected.\r\n\r\n15 If a man leaves his wife a legacy of her dowry, the gift is good,\r\nbecause the legacy is worth more than a mere right of action for the\r\ndowry. If, however, he has never received the dowry which he bequeaths,\r\nthe Emperors Severus and Antoninus have decided by rescript that the\r\nlegacy is void, provided the general term 'dowry' is used, but good,\r\nif in giving it to the wife a definite sum or thing is specified, or\r\ndescribed generally by reference to the dowry deed.\r\n\r\n16 If a thing bequeathed perishes through no act of the heir, the loss\r\nfalls on the legatee: thus if a slave belonging to another person, who\r\nis given in this way, is manumitted through no act of the heir, the\r\nlatter is not bound. If, however, the slave belongs to the heir, who\r\nmanumits him, Julian says that he is bound, and it is immaterial whether\r\nhe knew or not that the slave had been bequeathed away from him.\r\n\r\n17 If a testator gives a legacy of female slaves along with their\r\noffspring, the legatee can claim the latter even if the mothers are\r\ndead, and so again if a legacy is given of ordinary slaves along with\r\ntheir vicarii or subordinates, the latter can be claimed even if\r\nthe former are dead. But if the legacy be of a slave along with his\r\npeculium, and the slave is dead, or has been manumitted or alienated,\r\nthe legacy of the peculium is extinguished; and similarly, if the legacy\r\nbe of land with everything upon it, or with all its instruments of\r\ntillage, by the alienation of the land the legacy of the instruments of\r\ntillage is extinguished.\r\n\r\n18 If a flock be given as a legacy, which is subsequently reduced to a\r\nsingle sheep, this single survivor can be claimed; and Julian says that\r\nin a legacy of a flock are comprised sheep which are added to it after\r\nthe making of the will, a flock being but one aggregate composed of\r\ndistinct members, just as a house is but one aggregate composed of\r\ndistinct stones built together. So if the legacy consists of a house,\r\nwe hold that pillars or marbles added to it after the making of the will\r\npass under the bequest.\r\n\r\n20 If a slave's peculium be given as a legacy, the legatee undoubtedly\r\nprofits by what is added to it, and is a loser by what is taken from\r\nit, during the testator's lifetime. Whatever the slave acquires in\r\nthe interval between the testator's death and the acceptance of the\r\ninheritance belongs, according to Julian, to the legatee, if that\r\nlegatee be the slave himself who is manumitted by the will, because a\r\nlegacy of this kind vests from the acceptance of the inheritance: but\r\nif the legatee be a stranger, he is not entitled to such acquisitions,\r\nunless they are made by means of the peculium itself. A slave manumitted\r\nby a will is not entitled to his peculium unless it is expressly\r\nbequeathed to him, though, if the master manumits him in his lifetime,\r\nit is enough if it be not expressly taken from him, and to this effect\r\nthe Emperors Severus and Antoninus have decided by rescript: as also,\r\nthat a legacy of his peculium to a slave does not carry with it the\r\nright to sue for money which he has expended on his master's account,\r\nand that a legacy of a peculium may be inferred from directions in a\r\nwill that a slave is to be free so soon as he has made a statement of\r\nhis accounts and made up any balance, which may be against him, from his\r\npeculium.\r\n\r\n21 Incorporeal as well as corporeal things can be bequeathed: thus a man\r\ncan leave a legacy even of a debt which is owed to him, and the heir can\r\nbe compelled to transfer to the legatee his rights of action, unless the\r\ntestator has exacted payment in his lifetime, in which case the legacy\r\nis extinguished. Again, such a legacy as the following is good: 'be my\r\nheir bound to repair so and so's house, or to pay so and so's debts.'\r\n\r\n22 If a legacy be a general one, as of a slave or some other thing not\r\nspecifically determined, the legatee is entitled to choose what slave,\r\nor what thing, he will have, unless the testator has expressed a\r\ncontrary intention.\r\n\r\n23 A legacy of selection, that is, when a testator directs the legatee\r\nto select one from among his slaves, or any other class of things, was\r\nheld to be given subject to an implied condition that the legatee should\r\nmake the choice in person; so that if he died before doing so the legacy\r\ndid not pass to his heir. By our constitution, however, we have made an\r\nimprovement in this matter, and allowed the legatee's heir to exercise\r\nthe right of selection, although the legatee has not done so personally\r\nin his lifetime; which enactment, through our careful attention to\r\nthe subject, contains the further provision, that if there are either\r\nseveral colegatees to whom a right of selection has been bequeathed,\r\nand who cannot agree in their choice, or several coheirs of a single\r\nlegatee, who differ through some wishing to choose this thing and others\r\nthat, the question shall be decided by fortune--the legacy not being\r\nextinguished, which many of the jurists in an ungenerous spirit wished\r\nto make the rule--; that is to say, that lots shall be drawn, and he on\r\nwhom the lot falls shall have a priority of choice over the rest.\r\n\r\n24 Three persons only can be legatees who have testamentary capacity,\r\nthat is, who are legally capable of taking under a will.\r\n\r\n25 Formerly it was not allowed to leave either legacies or fiduciary\r\nbequests to uncertain persons, and even soldiers, as the Emperor Hadrian\r\ndecided by rescript, were unable to benefit uncertain persons in this\r\nway. An uncertain person was held to be one of whom the testator had\r\nno certain conception, as the legatee in the following form: 'Whoever\r\nbestows his daughter in marriage on my son, do thou, my heir, give him\r\nsuch or such land.' So too a legacy left to the first consuls designate\r\nafter the writing of the will was held to be given to an uncertain\r\nperson, and many others that might be instanced: and so it was held that\r\nfreedom could not be bequeathed to an uncertain person, because it was\r\nsettled that slaves ought to be enfranchised by name, and an uncertain\r\nperson could not be appointed guardian. But a legacy given with a\r\ncertain demonstration, that is, to an uncertain member of a certain\r\nclass, was valid, for instance, the following: 'Whoever of all my\r\nkindred now alive shall first marry my daughter, do thou, my heir,\r\ngive him such and such thing.' It was, however, provided by imperial\r\nconstitutions that legacies or fiduciary bequests left to uncertain\r\npersons and paid by mistake could not be recovered back.\r\n\r\n26 An afterborn stranger again could not take a legacy; an afterborn\r\nstranger being one who on his birth will not be a family heir to the\r\ntestator; thus a grandson by an emancipated son was held to be an\r\nafterborn stranger to his grandfather.\r\n\r\n27 These parts of the law, however, have not been left without due\r\nalteration, a constitution having been inserted in our Code by which\r\nwe have in these respects amended the rules relating to legacies and\r\nfiduciary bequests no less than to inheritances, as will be made clear\r\nby a perusal of the enactment, which, however, still maintains the old\r\nrule that an uncertain person cannot be appointed guardian: for when a\r\ntestator is appointing a guardian for his issue, he ought to be quite\r\nclear as to the person and character of the party he selects.\r\n\r\n28 An afterborn stranger could and still can be instituted heir, unless\r\nconceived of a woman who cannot by law be a man's wife.\r\n\r\n29 If a testator makes a mistake in any of the names of the legatee, the\r\nlegacy is nevertheless valid provided there is no doubt as to the person\r\nhe intended, and the same rule is very properly observed as to heirs as\r\nwell as legatees; for names are used only to distinguish persons, and\r\nif the person can be ascertained in other ways a mistake in the name is\r\nimmaterial.\r\n\r\n30 Closely akin to this rule is another, namely, that an erroneous\r\ndescription of the thing bequeathed does not invalidate the bequest;\r\nfor instance, if a testator says, 'I give and bequeath Stichus my born\r\nslave,' the legacy is good, if it quite clear who is meant by Stichus,\r\neven though it turn out that he was not born the testator's slave, but\r\nwas purchased by him. Similarly, if he describe Stichus as 'the slave\r\nI bought from Seius,' whereas in fact he bought him from some one else,\r\nthe legacy is good, if it is clear what slave he intended to give.\r\n\r\n31 Still less is a legacy invalidated from a wrong motive being assigned\r\nby the testator for giving it: if, for instance, he says, 'I give and\r\nbequeath Stichus to Titius, because he looked after my affairs while I\r\nwas away,' or 'because I was acquitted on a capital charge through his\r\nundertaking my defence,' the legacy is still good, although in point of\r\nfact Titius never did look after the testator's affairs, or never did,\r\nthrough his advocacy, procure his acquittal. But the law is different\r\nif the testator expresses his motive in the guise of a condition, as: 'I\r\ngive and bequeath such and such land to Titius, if he has looked after\r\nmy affairs.' 32 It is questioned whether a legacy to a slave of the\r\nheir is valid. It is clear that such a legacy is void if given\r\nunconditionally, even though the slave ceases to belong to the heir\r\nduring the testator's lifetime: for a legacy which would be void if\r\nthe testator died immediately after making his will ought not to become\r\nvalid by the simple fact of the testator's living longer. Such a legacy,\r\nhowever, is good if given subject to a condition, the question then\r\nbeing, whether at the vesting of the legacy the slave has ceased to\r\nbelong to the heir.\r\n\r\n33 On the other hand, there is no doubt that even an absolute legacy\r\nto the master of a slave who is instituted heir is good: for, even\r\nsupposing that the testator dies immediately after making the will, the\r\nright to the legacy does not necessarily belong to the person who is\r\nheir; for the inheritance and the legacy are separable, and a different\r\nperson from the legatee may become heir through the slave; as happens\r\nif, before the slave accepts the inheritance at his master's bidding,\r\nhe is conveyed to another person, or is manumitted and thus becomes heir\r\nhimself; in both of which cases the legacy is valid. But if he remains\r\nin the same condition, and accepts at his master's bidding, the legacy\r\nis extinguished.\r\n\r\n34 A legacy given before an heir was appointed was formerly void,\r\nbecause a will derives its operation from the appointment of an heir,\r\nand accordingly such appointment is deemed the beginning and foundation\r\nof the whole testament, and for the same reason a slave could not be\r\nenfranchised before an heir was appointed. Yet even the old lawyers\r\nthemselves disapproved of sacrificing the real intentions of the\r\ntestator by too strictly following the order of the writing: and we\r\naccordingly have deemed these rules unreasonable, and amended them by\r\nour constitution, which permits a legacy, and much more freedom, which\r\nis always more favoured, to be given before the appointment of an heir,\r\nor in the middle of the appointments, if there are several.\r\n\r\n35 Again, a legacy to take effect after the death of the heir or\r\nlegatee, as in the form: 'After my heir's death I give and bequeath,'\r\nwas formerly void, as also was one to take effect on the day preceding\r\nthe death of the heir or legatee. This too, however, we have corrected,\r\nby making such legacies as valid as they would be were they fiduciary\r\nbequests, lest in this point the latter should be found to have some\r\nsuperiority over the former.\r\n\r\n36 Formerly too the gift, revocation, and transference of legacies by\r\nway of penalty was void. A penal legacy is one given in order to coerce\r\nthe heir into doing or not doing something; for instance, the following:\r\n'If my heir gives his daughter in marriage to Titius,' or, conversely,\r\n'if he does not give her in marriage to Titius, let him pay ten aurei\r\nto Seius'; or again, 'if my heir parts with my slave Stichus,' or,\r\nconversely, 'if he does not part with him, let him pay ten aurei to\r\nTitius.' And so strictly was this rule observed, that it is declared\r\nin a large number of imperial constitutions that even the Emperor will\r\naccept no legacy by which a penalty is imposed on some other person: and\r\nsuch legacies were void even when given by a soldier's will, in which\r\nas a rule so much trouble was taken to carry out exactly the testator's\r\nwishes. Moreover, Sabinus was of opinion that a penal appointment of a\r\ncoheir was void, as exemplified in the following: 'Be Titius my heir: if\r\nTitius gives his daughter in marriage to Seius, be Seius my heir also';\r\nthe ground of the invalidity being that it made no difference in what\r\nway Titius was constrained, whether by a legacy being left away from\r\nhim, or by some one being appointed coheir. Of these refinements,\r\nhowever, we disapproved, and have consequently enacted generally\r\nthat bequests, even though given, revoked, or transferred in order to\r\npenalize the heir, shall be treated exactly like other legacies, except\r\nwhere the event on which the penal legacy is contingent is either\r\nimpossible, illegal, or immoral: for such testamentary dispositions as\r\nthese the opinion of my times will not permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXI. OF THE ADEMPTION AND TRANSFERENCE OF LEGACIES\r\n\r\nLegacies may be revoked either in a later clause of the will or by\r\ncodicils, and the revocation may be made either in words contrary\r\nto those of the gift, as the gift thus 'I give and bequeath,' the\r\nrevocation thus 'I do not give and bequeath,' or in words not contrary,\r\nthat is to say, in any words whatsoever.\r\n\r\n1 A legacy may also be transferred from one person to another, as thus:\r\n'I give and bequeath to Seius the slave Stichus whom I. bequeathed to\r\nTitius,' and this may be done either by a later clause of the will or by\r\ncodicils; the result being that the legacy is taken away from Titius and\r\nsimultaneously given to Seius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXII. OF THE LEX FALCIDIA\r\n\r\nWe have finally to consider the lex Falcidia, the most recent enactment\r\nlimiting the amount which can be given in legacies. The statute of the\r\nTwelve Tables had conferred complete liberty of bequest on testators, by\r\nwhich they were enabled to give away their whole patrimony in legacies,\r\nthat statute having enacted: 'let a man's testamentary disposition of\r\nhis property be regarded as valid.' This complete liberty of bequest,\r\nhowever, it was thought proper to limit in the interest of testators\r\nthemselves, for intestacy was becoming common through the refusal of\r\ninstituted heirs to accept inheritances from which they received\r\nlittle or no advantage at all. The lex Furia and the lex Voconia\r\nwere enactments designed to remedy the evil, but as both were found\r\ninadequate to the purpose, the lex Falcidia was finally passed,\r\nproviding that no testator should be allowed to dispose of more than\r\nthree-quarters of his property in legacies, or in other words, that\r\nwhether there was a single heir instituted, or two or more, he or they\r\nshould always be entitled to at least a quarter of the inheritance.\r\n\r\n1 If two heirs, say Titius and Seius, are instituted, and Titius's share\r\nof the inheritance is either wholly exhausted in legacies specifically\r\ncharged thereon, or burdened beyond the limit fixed by the statute,\r\nwhile no legacies at all are charged on Seius, or at any rate legacies\r\nwhich exhaust it only to the extent of one half or less, the question\r\narose whether, as Seius has at least a quarter of the whole inheritance,\r\nTitius was or was not entitled to retain anything out of the legacies\r\nwhich had been charged upon him: and it was settled that he could keep\r\nan entire fourth of his share of the inheritance; for the calculation\r\nof the lex Falcidia is to be applied separately to the share of each of\r\nseveral heirs in the inheritance.\r\n\r\n2 The amount of the property upon which the calculation is brought to\r\nbear is its amount at the moment of the testator's decease. Thus, to\r\nillustrate by an example, a testator who is worth a hundred aurei at his\r\ndecease gives the whole hundred away in legacies: here, if before the\r\nheir accepts, the inheritance is so much augmented through slaves who\r\nbelong to it, or by births of children from such of them as are females,\r\nor by the young of cattle that, even after paying away a hundred aurei\r\nin legacies, the heir will still have a clear fourth of the inheritance,\r\nthe legatee's position is in no way improved, but a quarter of the\r\nsum given in legacies may still be deducted for himself by the heir.\r\nConversely, if only seventyfive aurei are given in legacies, and before\r\nacceptance the inheritance is so much diminished in value, say by\r\nfire, shipwreck, or death of slaves, that no more or even less than\r\nseventyfive aurei are left, the legatees can claim payment of their\r\nlegacies in full. In this latter case, however, the heir is not\r\nprejudiced, for he is quite free to refused the inheritance:\r\nconsequently, the legatees must come to terms with him, and content\r\nthemselves with a portion of their legacies, lest they lose all through\r\nno one's taking under the will.\r\n\r\n3 When the calculation of the lex Falcidia is made, the testator's debts\r\nand funeral expenses are first deducted, and the value of slaves whom he\r\nhas manumitted in the will or directed to be manumitted is not reckoned\r\nas part of the inheritance; the residue is then divided so as to leave\r\nthe heirs a clear fourth, the other three quarters being distributed\r\namong the legatees in proportion to the amount of the legacies given\r\nthem respectively in the will. Thus, if we suppose four hundred aurei\r\nto have been given in legacies, and the value of the inheritance, out\r\nof which they are to be paid, to be exactly that sum, each legatee must\r\nhave his legacy abated by onefourth; if three hundred and fifty have\r\nbeen given in legacies, each legacy will be diminished by one-eighth; if\r\nfive hundred, first a fifth, then a fourth, must be deducted: for\r\nwhen the amount given in legacies actually exceeds the sum of the\r\ninheritance, there must be struck off first the excess, and then the\r\nshare which the heir is entitled to retain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXIII. OF TRUST INHERITANCES\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to fiduciary bequests or trusts; and let us begin with\r\ntrust inheritances.\r\n\r\n1 Legacies or inheritances given by trust had originally no binding\r\nlegal force, because no one could be compelled against his will to do\r\nwhat he was merely asked to do. As there were certain classes of persons\r\nto whom testators were unable to leave inheritances or legacies, when\r\nthey wished to effect these objects they used to trust to the good faith\r\nof some one who had this kind of testamentary capacity, and whom\r\nthey asked to give the inheritance, or the legacy, to the intended\r\nbeneficiary; hence the name 'trusts,' because they were not enforced\r\nby legal obligation, but only by the transferor's sense of honesty.\r\nSubsequently the Emperor Augustus, either out of regard for various\r\nfavourites of his own, or because the request was said to have been made\r\nin the name of the Emperor's safety, or moved thereto by individual\r\nand glaring cases of perfidy, commanded the consuls in certain cases to\r\nenforce the duty by their authority. And this being deemed equitable,\r\nand being approved by the people, there was gradually developed a new\r\nand permanent jurisdiction, and trusts became so popular that soon a\r\nspecial praetor was appointed to hear suits relating to them, who was\r\ncalled the trust praetor.\r\n\r\n2 The first requisite is an heir directly instituted, in trust to\r\ntransfer the inheritance to another, for the will is void without an\r\ninstituted heir in the first instance. Accordingly, when a testator has\r\nwritten: 'Lucius Titius, be thou my heir,' he may add: 'I request you,\r\nLucius Titius, as soon as you can accept my inheritance, to convey and\r\ntransfer it to Gaius Seius'; or he can request him to transfer a part.\r\nSo a trust may be either absolute or conditional, and to be performed\r\neither immediately or on a specified future day.\r\n\r\n3 After the transfer of the inheritance the transferor continues heir,\r\nthe transferee being sometimes regarded as quasi-heir, sometimes as\r\nquasi-legatee.\r\n\r\n4 But during the reign of Nero, in the consulate of Trebellius Maximus\r\nand Annaeus Seneca, a senatusconsult was passed providing that, when\r\nan inheritance is transferred in pursuance of a trust, all the actions\r\nwhich the civil law allows to be brought by or against the heir shall be\r\nmaintainable by and against the transferee: and after this enactment the\r\npraetor used to give indirect or fictitious actions to and against the\r\ntransferee as quasiheir.\r\n\r\n5 However, as the instituted heirs, when (as so often was the case)\r\nthey were requested to transfer the whole or nearly the whole of an\r\ninheritance, declined to accept for what was no benefit, or at most a\r\nvery slight benefit, to themselves, and this caused a failure of the\r\ntrusts, afterwards, in the time of the Emperor Vespasian, and during the\r\nconsulate of Pegasus and Pusio, the senate decreed that an heir who\r\nwas requested to transfer the inheritance should have the same right\r\nto retain a fourth thereof as the lex Falcidia gives to an heir charged\r\nwith the payment of legacies, and gave a similar right of retaining the\r\nfourth of any specific thing left in trust. After the passing of this\r\nsenatusconsult the heir, wherever it came into operation, was sole\r\nadministrator, and the transferee of the residue was in the position of\r\na partiary legatee, that is, of a legatee of a certain specified portion\r\nof the estate under the kind of bequest called participation, so that\r\nthe stipulations which had been usual between an heir and a partiary\r\nlegatee were now entered into by the heir and transferee, in order to\r\nsecure a rateable division of the gains and losses arising out of the\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\n6 Accordingly, after this, if no more than threefourths of the\r\ninheritance was in trust to be transferred, then the SC. Trebellianum\r\ngoverned the transfer, and both were liable to be sued for the debts\r\nof the inheritance in rateable portions, the heir by civil law,\r\nthe transferee, as quasiheir, by that enactment. But if more than\r\nthreefourths, or even the whole was left in trust to be transferred, the\r\nSC. Pegasianum came into operation, and when once the heir had accepted,\r\nof course voluntarily, he was the sole administrator whether he retained\r\nonefourth or declined to retain it: but if he did, he entered into\r\nstipulations with the transferee similar to those usual between the heir\r\nand a partiary legatee, while if he did not, but transferred the whole\r\ninheritance, he covenanted with him as quasi-purchaser. If an instituted\r\nheir refuse to accept an inheritance from a suspicion that the\r\nliabilities exceed the assets, it is provided by the SC. Pegasianum\r\nthat, on the petition of the person to whom he is requested to transfer,\r\nhe shall be ordered by the praetor to accept and transfer it, whereupon\r\nthe transferee shall be as capable of suing and being sued as the\r\ntransferee under the SC. Trebellianum. In this case no stipulations are\r\nnecessary, because by a concurrent operation of the two senatusconsults\r\nboth the transferor is protected, and all actions relating to the\r\ninheritance pass to and against the transferee.\r\n\r\n7 As, however, the covenants which had become necessary through the SC.\r\nPegasianum were disliked even by the older lawyers, and are in certain\r\ncases considered injurious by the eminent jurist Papinian, and it being\r\nour desire that our statute book should be clear and simple rather than\r\ncomplicated, we have, after placing these two senatusconsults side by\r\nside and examining their points of resemblance and difference, resolved\r\nto repeal the SC. Pegasianum, as the later enactment, and to give\r\nexclusive authority to the SC. Trebellianum, under which in future\r\nall trust inheritances are to be transferred, whether the testator has\r\nfreely given his heir a fourth of the property, or more or less, or even\r\nnothing at all: provided always, that when the heir has either nothing\r\nor less than a fourth, it shall be lawful for him, under our authority\r\nexpressed in this statute, to retain a fourth, or to recover it by\r\naction if he has already paid it over, the heir and the transferee being\r\ncapable both of suing and being sued in proportion to their shares in\r\nthe inheritance, after the analogy of the SC. Trebellianum; and provided\r\nalso, that if the heir voluntarily transfers the whole inheritance, the\r\ntransferee shall be able to sue and be sued on all actions relating to\r\nthe inheritance whatsoever. Moreover, we have transferred to the SC.\r\nTrebellianum the leading provision of the SC. Pegasianum, whereby it was\r\nenacted that when an instituted heir refused to accept an inheritance\r\noffered to him, he could be compelled to accept and transfer the whole\r\ninheritance if the intended transferee so desired, and that all actions\r\nshould pass to and against the latter: so that it is under the SC.\r\nTrebellianum alone that the heir, if unwilling to accept, is now obliged\r\nto do so, if the intended transferee desire the inheritance, though to\r\nhim personally no loss or profit can accrue under the transaction.\r\n\r\n8 It makes no difference whether it is a sole or part heir who is under\r\na trust to another, or whether what he is requested to transfer is the\r\nwhole or only a part of that to which he is heir; for we direct that the\r\nsame rules shall be applied in the case of a part being transferred as\r\nwe have said are observed in the transference of a whole inheritance.\r\n\r\n9 If the request addressed to the heir is to transfer the inheritance\r\nafter deducting or reserving some specific thing which is equal in value\r\nto a fourth part thereof, such as land or anything else, the conveyance\r\nwill be made under the SC. Trebellianum, exactly as if he had been\r\nasked after retaining a fourth part of the inheritance to transfer the\r\nresidue. There is, however, some difference between the two cases; for\r\nin the first, where the inheritance is transferred after deducting or\r\nreserving some specific thing, the senatusconsult has the effect of\r\nmaking the transferee the only person who can sue or be sued in respect\r\nof the inheritance, and the part retained by the heir is free from all\r\nencumbrances, exactly as if he had received it under a legacy; whereas\r\nin the second, where the heir, after retaining a fourth part of the\r\ninheritance, transfers the rest as requested, the actions are divided,\r\nthe transferee being able to sue and be sued in respect of threefourths\r\nof the inheritance, and the heir in respect of the rest. Moreover, if\r\nthe heir is requested to transfer the inheritance after deducting or\r\nreserving only a single specific thing, which, however, in value is\r\nequivalent to the greater part of the inheritance, the transferee is\r\nstill the only person who can sue and be sued, so that he ought well\r\nto weigh whether it is worth his while to take it: and the case is\r\nprecisely the same, whether what the heir is directed to deduct or\r\nreserve before transferring is two or more specific things, or a\r\ndefinite sum which in fact is equivalent to a fourth or even the greater\r\npart of the inheritance. What we have said of a sole heir is equally\r\ntrue of one who is instituted only to a part.\r\n\r\n10 Moreover, a man about to die intestate can charge the person to whom\r\nhe knows his property will go by either the civil or praetorian law to\r\ntransfer to some one else either his whole inheritance, or a part of it,\r\nor some specific thing, such as land, a slave, or money: but legacies\r\nhave no validity unless given by will.\r\n\r\n11 The transferee may himself be charged by the deceased with a trust\r\nto transfer to some other person either the whole or a part of what he\r\nreceives, or even something different.\r\n\r\n12 As has been already observed, trusts in their origin depended solely\r\non the good faith of the heir, from which early history they derived\r\nboth their name and their character: and it was for that reason that the\r\nEmperor Augustus made them legally binding obligations. And we, in\r\nour desire to surpass that prince, have recently made a constitution,\r\nsuggested by a matter brought before us by the eminent Tribonian,\r\nquaestor of our sacred palace, by which it is enacted, that if a\r\ntestator charges his heir with a trust to transfer the whole inheritance\r\nor some specific thing, and the trust cannot be proved by writing or\r\nby the evidence of five witnesses--five being, as is known, the number\r\nrequired by law for the proof of oral trusts--through there having been\r\nfewer witnesses than five, or even none at all, and if the heir, whether\r\nit be his own son or some one else whom the testator has chosen to\r\ntrust, and by whom he desired the transfer to be made, perfidiously\r\nrefuses to execute the trust, and in fact denies that he was ever\r\ncharged with it, the alleged beneficiary, having previously sworn to his\r\nown good faith, may put the heir upon his oath: whereupon the heir may\r\nbe compelled to swear that no trust was ever charged upon him, or, in\r\ndefault, to transfer the inheritance or the specific thing, as the case\r\nmay be, in order that the last wishes of the testator, the fulfilment\r\nof which he has left to the honour of his heir, may not be defeated. We\r\nhave also prescribed the same procedure where the person charged with a\r\ntrust is a legatee or already himself a transferee under a prior trust.\r\nFinally, if the person charged admits the trust, but tries to shelter\r\nhimself behind legal technicalities, he may most certainly be compelled\r\nto perform his obligation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXIV. OF TRUST BEQUESTS OF SINGLE THINGS\r\n\r\nSingle things can be left in trust as well as inheritances; land, for\r\ninstance, slaves, clothing, gold, silver, and coined money; and the\r\ntrust may be imposed either on an heir or on a legatee, although a\r\nlegatee cannot be charged with a legacy.\r\n\r\n1 Not only the testator's property, but that of an heir, or legatee, or\r\nperson already benefited by a trust, or any one else may be given by\r\na trust. Thus a legatee, or a person in whose favour the testator has\r\nalready created a trust, may be asked to transfer either a thing left\r\nto him, or any other thing belonging to himself or a stranger, provided\r\nalways that he is not charged with a trust to transfer more than he\r\ntakes by the will, for in respect of such excess the trust would be\r\nvoid. When a person is charged by a trust to transfer a thing belonging\r\nto some one else, he must either purchase and deliver it, or pay its\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n2 Liberty can be left to a slave by a trust charging an heir, legatee,\r\nor other person already benefited by a trust of the testator's, with\r\nhis manumission, and it makes no difference whether the slave is the\r\nproperty of the testator, of the heir, of the legatee or of a stranger:\r\nfor a stranger's slave must be purchased and manumitted; and on his\r\nmaster's refusal to sell (which refusal is allowable only if the master\r\nhas taken nothing under the will) the trust to enfranchise the slave is\r\nnot extinguished, as though its execution had become impossible, but its\r\nexecution is merely postponed; because it may become possible to free\r\nhim at some future time, whenever an opportunity of purchasing him\r\npresents itself. A trust of manumission makes the slave the freedman,\r\nnot of the testator, though he may have been his owner, but of the\r\nmanumitter, whereas a direct bequest of liberty makes a slave the\r\nfreedman of the testator, whence too he is called 'orcinus.' But a\r\ndirect bequest of liberty can be made only to a slave who belongs to the\r\ntestator both at the time of making his will and at that of his decease;\r\nand by a direct bequest of liberty is to be understood the case where\r\nthe testator desires him to become free in virtue, as it were, of his\r\nown testament alone, and so does not ask some one else to manumit him.\r\n\r\n3 The words most commonly used to create a trust are I beg, I. request,\r\nI wish, I commission, I trust to your good faith; and they are just as\r\nbinding when used separately as when united.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXV. OF CODICILS\r\n\r\nIt is certain that codicils were not in use before the time of Augustus,\r\nfor Lucius Lentulus, who was also the originator of trusts, was the\r\nfirst to introduce them, in the following manner. Being on the point of\r\ndeath in Africa, he executed codicils, confirmed by his will, by which\r\nhe begged Augustus to do something for him as a trust; and on the\r\nEmperor's fulfilling his wishes, other persons followed the precedent\r\nand discharged trusts created in this manner, and the daughter of\r\nLentulus paid legacies which could not have been legally claimed from\r\nher. It is said that Augustus called a council of certain jurists, among\r\nthem Trebatius, who at that time enjoyed the highest reputation, and\r\nasked them whether the new usage could be sanctioned, or did not rather\r\nrun counter to the received principles of law, and that Trebatius\r\nrecommended their admission, remarking 'how convenient and even\r\nnecessary the practice was to citizens,' owing to the length of the\r\njourneys which were taken in those early days, and upon which a man\r\nmight often be able to make codicils when he could not make a will.\r\nAnd subsequently, after codicils had been made by Labeo, nobody doubted\r\ntheir complete validity.\r\n\r\n1 Not only can codicils be made after a will, but a man dying intestate\r\ncan create trusts by codicils, though Papinian says that codicils\r\nexecuted before a will are invalid unless confirmed by a later express\r\ndeclaration that they shall be binding. But a rescript of the Emperors\r\nSeverus and Antoninus decides that the performance of a trust imposed\r\nby codicils written before a will may in any case be demanded, if it\r\nappears that the testator had not abandoned the intention expressed in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n2 An inheritance can neither be given nor taken away by codicils, nor,\r\naccordingly, can a child be disinherited in this way: for, if it were\r\notherwise, the law of wills and of codicils would be confounded. By this\r\nit is meant that an inheritance cannot directly be given or taken away\r\nby codicils; for indirectly, by means of a trust, one can very well\r\nbe given in this manner. Nor again can a condition be imposed on an\r\ninstituted heir, or a direct substitution be effected, by codicils.\r\n\r\n3 A man can make any number of codicils, and no solemnities are required\r\nfor their execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE I. OF THE DEVOLUTION OF INHERITANCES ON INTESTACY\r\n\r\nA man is said to die intestate who either has made no will at all, or\r\nhas made one which is invalid, or if one which has been duly executed\r\nhas been subsequently revoked, or rescinded, or finally, if no one\r\naccepts as heir under the testament.\r\n\r\n1 The inheritances of intestate persons go first, by the statute of the\r\nTwelve Tables, to family heirs;\r\n\r\n2 and family heirs, as we said above, are those who were in the power\r\nof the deceased at the time of his death, such as a son or daughter, a\r\ngrandchild by a son, or a greatgrandchild by such grandchild if a male,\r\nand this whether the relationship be natural or adoptive. Among them\r\nmust also be reckoned children who, though not born in lawful wedlock,\r\nhave been inscribed members of the curia according to the tenor of the\r\nimperial constitutions relating to them, and thus acquire the rights of\r\nfamily heirs, or who come within the terms of our constitutions by which\r\nwe have enacted that, if any one shall cohabit with a woman whom he\r\nmight have lawfully married, but for whom he did not at first feel\r\nmarital affection, and shall after begetting children by her begin to\r\nfeel such affection and formally marry her, and then have by her sons or\r\ndaughters, not only shall those be lawful children and in their father's\r\npower who were born after the settlement of the dowry, but also\r\nthose born before, to whom in reality the later born ones owed their\r\nlegitimacy; and we have provided that this rule shall hold even though\r\nno children are born after the execution of the dowry deed, or if,\r\nhaving been born, they are dead. It is to be observed, however, that a\r\ngrandchild or greatgrandchild is not a family heir, unless the person in\r\nthe preceding degree has ceased to be in the power of the parent, either\r\nthrough having died, or by some other means, such as emancipation; for\r\nif at the time of a man's decease a son is in his power, a grandson by\r\nthat son cannot be a family heir, and the case is exactly the same with\r\nmore remote descendants. Children too who are born after the ancestor's\r\ndeath, and who would have been in his power had they been born during\r\nhis lifetime, are family heirs.\r\n\r\n3 Family heirs succeed even though ignorant of their title, and they\r\ncan take upon an intestacy even though insane, because whenever the law\r\nvests property in a person, even when he is ignorant of his title, it\r\nequally vests it in him if insane. Thus, immediately on the parent's\r\ndeath, the ownership is as it were continued without any break, so that\r\npupils who are family heirs do not require their guardian's sanction in\r\norder to succeed, for inheritances go to such heirs even though ignorant\r\nof their title; and similarly an insane family heir does not require his\r\ncurator's consent in order to succeed, but takes by operation of law.\r\n\r\n4 Sometimes, however, a family heir succeeds in this way to his parent,\r\neven though not in the latter's power at the time of his decease, as\r\nwhere a person returns from captivity after his father's death, this\r\nbeing the effect of the law of postliminium.\r\n\r\n5 And sometimes conversely a man is not a family heir although in the\r\npower of the deceased at the time of his death, as where the latter\r\nafter his death is adjudged to have been guilty of treason, and his\r\nmemory is thereby branded with infamy: such a person is unable to have a\r\nfamily heir, for his property is confiscated to the treasury, though one\r\nwho would otherwise have succeeded him may be said to have in law been a\r\nfamily heir, and ceased to be such.\r\n\r\n6 Where there is a son or daughter, and a grandchild by another son,\r\nthese are called together to the inheritance, nor does the nearer in\r\ndegree exclude the more remote, for it seems just that grandchildren\r\nshould represent their father and take his place in the succession.\r\nSimilarly a grandchild by a son, and a greatgrandchild by a grandson\r\nare called to the inheritance together. And as it was thought just that\r\ngrandchildren and greatgrandchildren should represent their father, it\r\nseemed consistent that the inheritance should be divided by the number\r\nof stems, and not by the number of individuals, so that a son should\r\ntake onehalf, and grandchildren by another son the other: or, if two\r\nsons left children, that a single grandchild, or two grandchildren by\r\none son, should take onehalf, and three or four grandchildren by the\r\nother son the other.\r\n\r\n7 In ascertaining whether, in any particular case, so and so is a family\r\nheir, one ought to regard only that moment of time at which it first was\r\ncertain that the deceased died intestate, including hereunder the\r\ncase of no one's accepting under the will. For instance, if a son be\r\ndisinherited and a stranger instituted heir, and the son die after the\r\ndecease of his father, but before it is certain that the heir instituted\r\nin the will either will not or cannot take the inheritance, a grandson\r\nwill take as family heir to his grandfather, because he is the only\r\ndescendant in existence when first it is certain that the ancestor died\r\nintestate; and of this there can be no doubt.\r\n\r\n8 A grandson born after, though conceived before, his grandfather's\r\ndeath, whose father dies in the interval between the grandfather's\r\ndecease and desertion of the latter's will through failure of the\r\ninstituted heir to take, is family heir to his grandfather; though it is\r\nobvious that if (other circumstances remaining the same) he is conceived\r\nas well as born after the grandfather's decease, he is no family heir,\r\nbecause he was never connected with his grandfather by any tie of\r\nrelationship; exactly as a person adopted by an emancipated son is\r\nnot among the children of, and therefore cannot be family heir to, the\r\nlatter's father. And such persons, not being children in relation to\r\nthe inheritance, cannot apply either for possession of the goods of the\r\ndeceased as next of kin. So much for family heirs.\r\n\r\n9 As to emancipated children, they have, by the civil law, no rights to\r\nsucceed to an intestate; for having ceased to be in the power of their\r\nparent, they are not family heirs, nor are they called by any other\r\ntitle in the statute of the Twelve Tables. The praetor, however,\r\nfollowing natural equity, gives them possession of the goods of the\r\ndeceased merely as children, exactly as if they had been in his power\r\nat the time of his death, and this whether they stand alone or whether\r\nthere are family heirs as well. Consequently, if a man die leaving two\r\nchildren, one emancipated, and the other in his power at the time of\r\nhis decease, the latter is sole heir by the civil law, as being the\r\nonly family heir; but through the former's being admitted to part of the\r\ninheritance by the indulgence of the praetor, the family heir becomes\r\nheir to part of the inheritance only.\r\n\r\n10 Emancipated children, however, who have given themselves in adoption\r\nare not thus admitted, under the title of children, to share the\r\nproperty of their natural father, if at the time of his decease they are\r\nin their adoptive family; though it is otherwise if they are emancipated\r\nduring his lifetime by their adoptive father, for then they are admitted\r\nas if they had been emancipated by him and had never been in an adoptive\r\nfamily, while, conversely, as regards their adoptive father, they are\r\nhenceforth regarded as strangers. If, however, they are emancipated\r\nby the adoptive after the death of the natural father, as regards the\r\nformer they are strangers all the same, and yet do not acquire the rank\r\nof children as regards succession to the property of the latter; the\r\nreason of this rule being the injustice of putting it within the power\r\nof an adoptive father to determine to whom the property of the natural\r\nfather shall belong, whether to his children or to his agnates.\r\n\r\n11 Adoptive are thus not so well off as natural children in respect of\r\nrights of succession: for by the indulgence of the praetor the latter\r\nretain their rank as children even after emancipation, although they\r\nlose it by the civil law; while the former, if emancipated, are not\r\nassisted even by the praetor. And there is nothing wrong in their\r\nbeing thus differently treated, because civil changes can affect rights\r\nannexed to a civil title, but not rights annexed to a natural title,\r\nand natural descendants, though on emancipation they cease to be family\r\nheirs, cannot cease to be children or grandchildren; whereas on\r\nthe other hand adoptive children are regarded as strangers after\r\nemancipation, because they lose the title and name of son or daughter,\r\nwhich they have acquired by a civil change, namely adoption, by another\r\ncivil change, namely emancipation.\r\n\r\n12 And the rule is the same in the possession of goods against the will\r\nwhich the praetor promises to children who are passed over in their\r\nparent's testament, that is to say, are neither instituted nor duly\r\ndisinherited; for the praetor calls to this possession children who were\r\nin their parent's power at the time of his decease, or emancipated, but\r\nexcludes those who at that time were in an adoptive family: still less\r\ndoes he here admit adoptive children emancipated by their adoptive\r\nfather, for by emancipation they cease entirely to be children of his.\r\n\r\n13 We should observe, however, that though children who are in an\r\nadoptive family, or who are emancipated by their adoptive after the\r\ndecease of their natural father, are not admitted on the death of the\r\nlatter intestate by that part of the edict by which children are called\r\nto the possession of goods, they are called by another part, namely that\r\nwhich admits the cognates of the deceased, who, however, come in only\r\nif there are no family heirs, emancipated children, or agnates to take\r\nbefore them: for the praetor prefers children, whether family heirs\r\nor emancipated, to all other claimants, ranking in the second degree\r\nstatutory successors, and in the third cognates, or next of kin.\r\n\r\n14 All these rules, however, which to our predecessors were sufficient,\r\nhave received some emendation by the constitution which we have enacted\r\nrelative to persons who have been given in adoption to others by\r\ntheir natural fathers; for we found cases in which sons by entering\r\nan adoptive family forfeited their right of succeeding their natural\r\nparents, and then, the tie of adoption being easily broken by\r\nemancipation, lost all title to succeed their adoptive parents as well.\r\nWe have corrected this, in our usual manner, by a constitution which\r\nenacts that, when a natural father gives his son in adoption to another\r\nperson, the son's rights shall remain the same in every particular as\r\nif he had continued in the power of his natural father, and the adoption\r\nhad never taken place, except only that he shall be able to succeed his\r\nadoptive father should he die intestate. If, however, the latter makes\r\na will, the son cannot obtain any part of the inheritance either by the\r\ncivil or by the praetorian law, that is to say, either by impeaching the\r\nwill as unduteous or by applying for possession against the will; for,\r\nbeing related by no tie of blood, the adoptive father is not bound\r\neither to institute him heir or to disinherit him, even though he has\r\nbeen adopted, in accordance with the SC. Afinianum, from among three\r\nbrothers; for, even under these circumstances, he is not entitled to a\r\nfourth of what he might have taken on intestacy, nor has he any action\r\nfor its recovery. We have, however, by our constitution excepted persons\r\nadopted by natural ascendants, for between them and their adopters there\r\nis the natural tie of blood as well as the civil tie of adoption, and\r\ntherefore in this case we have preserved the older law, as also in that\r\nof an independent person giving himself in adrogation: all of which\r\nenactment can be gathered in its special details from the tenor of the\r\naforesaid constitution.\r\n\r\n15 By the ancient law too, which favoured the descent through males,\r\nthose grandchildren only were called as family heirs, and preferred to\r\nagnates, who were related to the grandfather in this way: grandchildren\r\nby daughters, and greatgrandchildren by granddaughters, whom it regarded\r\nonly as cognates, being called after the agnates in succession to\r\ntheir maternal grandfather or greatgrandfather, or their grandmother or\r\ngreatgrandmother, whether paternal or maternal. But the Emperors would\r\nnot allow so unnatural a wrong to endure without sufficient correction,\r\nand accordingly, as people are, and are called, grandchildren and\r\ngreatgrandchildren of a person whether they trace their descent through\r\nmales or through females, they placed them altogether in the same rank\r\nand order of succession. In order, however, to bestow some privilege on\r\nthose who had in their favour the provisions of the ancient law as\r\nwell as natural right, they determined that grandchildren,\r\ngreatgrandchildren, and others who traced their descent through a female\r\nshould have their portion of the inheritance diminished by receiving\r\nless by onethird than their mother or grandmother would have taken,\r\nor than their father or grandfather, paternal or maternal, when the\r\ndeceased, whose inheritance was in question, was a woman; and they\r\nexcluded the agnates, if such descendants claimed the inheritance, even\r\nthough they stood alone. Thus, exactly as the statute of the Twelve\r\nTables calls the grandchildren and greatgrandchildren to represent their\r\ndeceased father in the succession to their grandfather, so the imperial\r\nlegislation substitutes them for their deceased mother or grandmother,\r\nsubject to the aforesaid deduction of a third part of the share which\r\nshe personally would have taken.\r\n\r\n16 As, however, there was still some question as to the relative rights\r\nof such grandchildren and of the agnates, who on the authority of a\r\ncertain constitution claimed a fourth part of the deceased's estate, we\r\nhave repealed the said enactment, and not permitted its insertion in\r\nour Code from that of Theodosius. By the constitution which we have\r\npublished, and by which we have altogether deprived it of validity,\r\nwe have provided that in case of the survival of grandchildren by\r\na daughter, greatgrandchildren by a granddaughter, or more remote\r\ndescendants related through a female, the agnates shall have no claim to\r\nany part of the estate of the deceased, that collaterals may no longer\r\nbe preferred to lineal descendants; which constitution we hereby reenact\r\nwith all its force from the date originally determined: provided always,\r\nas we direct, that the inheritance shall be divided between sons and\r\ngrandchildren by a daughter, or between all the grandchildren, and other\r\nmore remote descendants, according to stocks, and not by counting heads,\r\non the principle observed by the ancient law in dividing an inheritance\r\nbetween sons and grandchildren by a son, the issue obtaining without\r\nany diminution the portion which would have belonged to their mother or\r\nfather, grandmother or grandfather: so that if, for instance, there be\r\none or two children by one stock, and three or four by another, the\r\none or two, and the three or four, shall together take respectively one\r\nmoiety of the inheritance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE II. OF THE STATUTORY SUCCESSION OF AGNATES\r\n\r\nIf there is no family heir, nor any of those persons called to the\r\nsuccession along with family heirs by the praetor or the imperial\r\nlegislation, to take the inheritance in any way, it devolves, by the\r\nstatute of the Twelve Tables, on the nearest agnate.\r\n\r\n1 Agnates, as we have observed in the first book, are those cognates\r\nwho trace their relationship through males, or, in other words, who are\r\ncognate through their respective fathers. Thus, brothers by the same\r\nfather are agnates, whether by the same mother or not, and are called\r\n'consanguinei'; an uncle is agnate to his brother's son, and vice\r\nversa; and the children of brothers by the same father, who are called\r\n'consobrini, are one another's agnates, so that it is easy to arrive at\r\nvarious degrees of agnation. Children who are born after their father's\r\ndecease acquire the rights of kinship exactly as if they had been born\r\nbefore that event. But the law does not give the inheritance to all the\r\nagnates, but only to those who were nearest in degree at the moment when\r\nit was first certain that the deceased died intestate.\r\n\r\n2 The relation of agnation can also be established by adoption, for\r\ninstance, between a man's own sons and those whom he has adopted, all\r\nof whom are properly called consanguinei in relation to one another.\r\nSo, too, if your brother, or your paternal uncle, or even a more remote\r\nagnate, adopts any one, that person undoubtedly becomes one of your\r\nagnates.\r\n\r\n3 Male agnates have reciprocal rights of succession, however remote the\r\ndegree of relationship: but the rule as regards females, on the other\r\nhand, was that they could not succeed as agnates to any one more\r\nremotely related to them than a brother, while they themselves could\r\nbe succeeded by their male agnates, however distant the connexion: thus\r\nyou, if a male, could take the inheritance of a daughter either of your\r\nbrother or of your paternal uncle, or of your paternal aunt, but she\r\ncould not take yours; the reason of this distinction being the seeming\r\nexpediency of successions devolving as much as possible on males. But as\r\nit was most unjust that such females should be as completely excluded\r\nas if they were strangers, the praetor admits them to the possession of\r\ngoods promised in that part of the edict in which mere natural kinship\r\nis recognised as a title to succession, under which they take provided\r\nthere is no agnate, or other cognate of a nearer degree of relationship.\r\nNow these distinctions were in no way due to the statute of the Twelve\r\nTables, which, with the simplicity proper to all legislation, conferred\r\nreciprocal rights of succession on all agnates alike, whether males\r\nor females, and excluded no degree by reason merely of its remoteness,\r\nafter the analogy of family heirs; but it was introduced by the jurists\r\nwho came between the Twelve Tables and the imperial legislation, and who\r\nwith their legal subtleties and refinements excluded females other\r\nthan sisters altogether from agnatic succession. And no other scheme of\r\nsuccession was in those times heard of, until the praetors, by gradually\r\nmitigating to the best of their ability the harshness of the civil law,\r\nor by filling up voids in the old system, provided through their edicts\r\na new one. Mere cognation was thus in its various degrees recognised\r\nas a title to succession, and the praetors gave relief to such females\r\nthrough the possession of goods, which they promised to them in that\r\npart of the edict by which cognates are called to the succession. We,\r\nhowever, have followed the Twelve Tables in this department of law,\r\nand adhered to their principles: and, while we commend the praetors for\r\ntheir sense of equity, we cannot hold that their remedy was adequate;\r\nfor when the degree of natural relationship was the same, and when the\r\ncivil title of agnation was conferred by the older law on males and\r\nfemales alike, why should males be allowed to succeed all their agnates,\r\nand women (except sisters) be debarred from succeeding any? Accordingly,\r\nwe have restored the old rules in their integrity, and made the law on\r\nthis subject an exact copy of the Twelve Tables, by enacting, in our\r\nconstitution, that all 'statutory' successors, that is, persons tracing\r\ntheir descent from the deceased through males, shall be called alike\r\nto the succession as agnates on an intestacy, whether they be males or\r\nfemales, according to their proximity of degree; and that no females\r\nshall be excluded on the pretence that none but sisters have the right\r\nof succeeding by the title of kinship.\r\n\r\n4 By an addition to the same enactment we have deemed it right to\r\ntransfer one, though only one, degree of cognates into the ranks of\r\nthose who succeed by a statutory title, in order that not only the\r\nchildren of a brother may be called, as we have just explained, to the\r\nsuccession of their paternal uncle, but that the children of a sister\r\ntoo, even though only of the half blood on either side (but not her more\r\nremote descendants), may share with the former the inheritance of their\r\nuncle; so that, on the decease of a man who is paternal uncle to his\r\nbrother's children, and maternal uncle to those of his sister, the\r\nnephews and nieces on either side will now succeed him alike, provided,\r\nof course, that the brother and sister do not survive, exactly as if\r\nthey all traced their relationship through males, and thus all had a\r\nstatutory title. But if the deceased leaves brothers and sisters who\r\naccept the inheritance, the remoter degrees are altogether excluded,\r\nthe division in this case being made individually, that is to say, by\r\ncounting heads, not stocks.\r\n\r\n5 If there are several degrees of agnates, the statute of the Twelve\r\nTables clearly calls only the nearest, so that if, for instance, the\r\ndeceased leaves a brother, and a nephew by another brother deceased, or\r\na paternal uncle, the brother is preferred. And although that statute,\r\nin speaking of the nearest agnate, uses the singular number, there is\r\nno doubt that if there are several of the same degree they are all\r\nadmitted: for though properly one can speak of 'the nearest degree'\r\nonly when there are several, yet it is certain that even though all the\r\nagnates are in the same degree the inheritance belongs to them.\r\n\r\n6 If a man dies without having made a will at all, the agnate who takes\r\nis the one who was nearest at the time of the death of the deceased. But\r\nwhen a man dies, having made a will, the agnate who takes (if one is\r\nto take at all) is the one who is nearest when first it becomes certain\r\nthat no one will accept the inheritance under the testament; for until\r\nthat moment the deceased cannot properly be said to have died intestate\r\nat all, and this period of uncertainty is sometimes a long one, so that\r\nit not unfrequently happens that through the death, during it, of a\r\nnearer agnate, another becomes nearest who was not so at the death of\r\nthe testator.\r\n\r\n7 In agnatic succession the established rule was that the right of\r\naccepting the inheritance could not pass from a nearer to a more remote\r\ndegree; in other words, that if the nearest agnate, who, as we have\r\ndescribed, is called to the inheritance, either refuses it or dies\r\nbefore acceptance, the agnates of the next grade have no claim to\r\nadmittance under the Twelve Tables. This hard rule again the praetors\r\ndid not leave entirely without correction, though their remedy, which\r\nconsisted in the admission of such persons, since they were excluded\r\nfrom the rights of agnation, in the rank of cognates, was inadequate.\r\nBut we, in our desire to have the law as complete as possible, have\r\nenacted in the constitution which in our clemency we have issued\r\nrespecting the rights of patrons, that in agnatic succession the\r\ntransference of the rights to accept from a nearer to a remoter degree\r\nshall not be refused: for it was most absurd that agnates should\r\nbe denied a privilege which the praetor had conferred on cognates,\r\nespecially as the burden of guardianship fell on the second degree of\r\nagnates if there was a failure of the first, the principle which we have\r\nnow sanctioned being admitted so far as it imposed burdens, but rejected\r\nso far as it conferred a boon.\r\n\r\n8 To statutory succession the ascendant too is none the less called who\r\nemancipates a child, grandchild, or remoter descendant under a\r\nfiduciary agreement, which by our constitution is now implied in every\r\nemancipation. Among the ancients the rule was different, for the parent\r\nacquired no rights of succession unless he had entered into a special\r\nagreement of trust to that effect prior to the emancipation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE III. OF THE SENATUSCONSULTUM TERTULLIANUM\r\n\r\nSo strict were the rules of the statute of the Twelve Tables in\r\npreferring the issue of males, and excluding those who traced their\r\nrelationship through females, that they did not confer reciprocal rights\r\nof inheritance even on a mother and her children, though the praetors\r\ncalled them to succeed one another as next of kin by promising them the\r\npossession of goods in the class of cognates.\r\n\r\n1 But this narrowness of the law was afterwards amended, the Emperor\r\nClaudius being the first to confer on a mother, as a consolation for the\r\nloss of her children, a statutory right to their inheritance,\r\n\r\n2 and afterwards, very full provisions were made by the SC.\r\nTertullianum, enacted in the time of the Emperor Hadrian, and relating\r\nto the melancholy succession of children by their mothers, though not\r\nby their grandmothers, whereby it was provided that a freeborn woman who\r\nhad three or a freedwoman who had four children should be entitled to\r\nsucceed to the goods of her children who died intestate, even though\r\nherself under paternal power; though, in this latter case, she cannot\r\naccept the inheritance except by the direction of the person in whose\r\npower she is.\r\n\r\n3 Children of the deceased who are or who rank as family heirs, whether\r\nin the first or any other degree, are preferred to the mother, and even\r\nwhere the deceased is a woman her children by imperial constitutions\r\nhave a prior claim to the mother, that is, to their own grandmother.\r\nAgain, the father of the deceased is preferred to the mother, but not\r\nso the paternal grandfather or greatgrandfather, at least when it is\r\nbetween them only that the question arises who is entitled. A brother by\r\nthe same father excluded the mother from the succession to both sons\r\nand daughters, but a sister by the same father came in equally with the\r\nmother; and where there were both a brother and a sister by the same\r\nfather, as well as a mother who was entitled by number of children,\r\nthe brother excluded the mother, and divided the inheritance in equal\r\nmoieties with the sister.\r\n\r\n4 By a constitution, however, which we have placed in the Code made\r\nillustrious by our name, we have deemed it right to afford relief to the\r\nmother, in consideration of natural justice, of the pains of childbirth,\r\nand of the danger and even death which mothers often incur in this\r\nmanner; for which reason we have judged it a sin that they should be\r\nprejudiced by a circumstance which is entirely fortuitous. For if a\r\nfreeborn woman had not borne three, or a freedwoman four children, she\r\nwas undeservedly defrauded of the succession to her own offspring;\r\nand yet what fault had she committed in bearing few rather than many\r\nchildren? Accordingly, we have conferred on mothers a full statutory\r\nright of succession to their children, and even if they have had no\r\nother child than the one in question deceased.\r\n\r\n5 The earlier constitutions, in their review of statutory rights of\r\nsuccession, were in some points favourable, in others unfavourable,\r\nto mothers; thus in some cases they did not call them to the whole\r\ninheritance of their children, but deducted a third in favour of certain\r\nother persons with a statutory title, while in others they did exactly\r\nthe opposite. We, however, have determined to follow a straightforward\r\nand simple path, and, preferring the mother to all other persons with a\r\nstatutory title, to give her the entire succession of her sons, without\r\ndeduction in favour of any other persons except a brother or sister,\r\nwhether by the same father as the deceased, or possessing rights of\r\ncognation only; so that, as we have preferred the mother to all with\r\na statutory title, so we call to the inheritance, along with her, all\r\nbrothers and sisters of the deceased, whether statutorily entitled or\r\nnot: provided that, if the only surviving relatives of the deceased\r\nare sisters, agnatic or cognatic, and a mother, the latter shall have\r\nonehalf, and all the sisters together the other half of the inheritance;\r\nif a mother and a brother or brothers, with or without sisters agnatic\r\nor cognatic, the inheritance shall be divided among mother, brothers,\r\nand sisters in equal portions.\r\n\r\n6 But, while we are legislating for mothers, we ought also to bestow\r\nsome thought on their offspring; and accordingly mothers should\r\nobserve that if they do not apply within a year for guardians for their\r\nchildren, either originally or in lieu of those who have been removed or\r\nexcused, they will forfeit their title to succeed such children if they\r\ndie under the age of puberty.\r\n\r\n7 A mother can succeed her child under the SC. Tertullianum even though\r\nthe child be illegitimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE IV. OF THE SENATUSCONSULTUM ORFITIANUM\r\n\r\nConversely, children were admitted to succeed their mother on her death\r\nintestate by the SC. Orfitianum, passed in the time of the Emperor\r\nMarcus, when Orfitus and Rufus were consuls: by which a statutory right\r\nof succession was conferred on both sons and daughters, even though in\r\nthe power of another, in preference to their deceased mother's brothers\r\nand sisters and other agnates.\r\n\r\n1 As, however, grandsons were not called by this senatusconsult with a\r\nstatutory title to the succession of their grandmothers,\r\n\r\n2 this was subsequently amended by imperial constitutions, providing\r\nthat grandchildren should be called to inherit exactly like children. It\r\nis to be observed that rights of succession such as those conferred\r\nby the SC. Tertullianum and Orfitianum are not extinguished by loss of\r\nstatus, owing to the rule that rights of succession conferred by later\r\nstatutes are not destroyed in this way, but only such as are conferred\r\nby the statute of the Twelve Tables;\r\n\r\n3 and finally that under the latter of these two enactments even\r\nillegitimate children are admitted to their mother's inheritance.\r\n\r\n4 If there are several heirs with a statutory title, some of whom do\r\nnot accept, or are prevented from doing so by death or some other cause,\r\ntheir shares accrue in equal proportions to those who do accept the\r\ninheritance, or to their heirs, supposing they die before the failure of\r\nthe others to take.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE V. OF THE SUCCESSION OF COGNATES\r\n\r\nAfter family heirs, and persons who by the praetor and the imperial\r\nlegislation are ranked as such, and after persons statutorily entitled,\r\namong whom are the agnates and those whom the aforesaid senatusconsults\r\nand our constitution have raised to the rank of agnates, the praetor\r\ncalls the nearest cognates.\r\n\r\n1 In this class or order natural or blood relationship alone is\r\nconsidered: for agnates who have undergone loss of status and their\r\nchildren, though not regarded as having a statutory title under the\r\nstatute of the Twelve Tables, are called by the praetor in the\r\nthird order of the succession. The sole exceptions to this rule are\r\nemancipated brothers and sisters, though not in equal shares with them,\r\nbut with some deduction, the amount of which can easily be ascertained\r\nfrom the terms of the constitution itself. But to other agnates of\r\nremoter degrees, even though they have not undergone loss of status, and\r\nstill more to cognates, they are preferred by the aforesaid statute.\r\n\r\n2 Again, collateral relations connected with the deceased only by the\r\nfemale line are called to the succession by the praetor in the third\r\norder as cognates;\r\n\r\n3 and children who are in an adoptive family are admitted in this order\r\nto the inheritance of their natural parent.\r\n\r\n4 It is clear that illegitimate children can have no agnates, for in\r\nlaw they have no father, and it is through the father that agnatic\r\nrelationship is traced, while cognatic relationship is traced through\r\nthe mother as well. On the same principle they cannot be held to be\r\nconsanguinei of one another, for consanguinei are in a way agnatically\r\nrelated: consequently, they are connected with one another only as\r\ncognates, and in the same way too with the cognates of their mother.\r\nAccordingly, they can succeed to the possession of goods under that part\r\nof the Edict in which cognates are called by the title of mere kinship.\r\n\r\n5 In this place too we should observe that a person who claims as an\r\nagnate can be admitted to the inheritance, even though ten degrees\r\nremoved from the deceased, both by the statute of the Twelve Tables, and\r\nby the Edict in which the praetor promises the possession of goods to\r\nheirs statutorily entitled: but on the ground of mere natural kinship\r\nthe praetor promises possession of goods to those cognates only who are\r\nwithin the sixth degree; the only persons in the seventh degree whom\r\nhe admits as cognates being the children of a second cousin of the\r\ndeceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE VI. OF THE DEGREES OF COGNATION\r\n\r\nIt is here necessary to explain the way in which the degrees of natural\r\nrelationship are reckoned. In the first place it is to be observed that\r\nthey can be counted either upwards, or downwards, or crosswise, that is\r\nto say, collaterally. Relations in the ascending line are parents, in\r\nthe descending line, children, and similarly uncles and aunts paternal\r\nand maternal. In the ascending and descending lines a man's nearest\r\ncognate may be related to him in the first degree; in the collateral\r\nline he cannot be nearer to him than the second.\r\n\r\n1 Relations in the first degree, reckoning upwards, are the father and\r\nmother; reckoning downwards, the son and daughter.\r\n\r\n2 Those in the second degree, upwards, are grandfather and grandmother;\r\ndownwards, grandson and granddaughter;\r\n\r\n3 and in the collateral line brother and sister. In the third degree,\r\nupwards, are the greatgrandfather and greatgrandmother; downwards, the\r\ngreatgrandson and greatgranddaughter; in the collateral line, the sons\r\nand daughters of a brother or sister, and also uncles and aunts paternal\r\nand maternal. The father's brother is called 'patruus,' in Greek\r\n'patros', the mother's brother avunculus, in Greek specifically\r\n'matros,' though the term theios is used indifferently to indicate\r\neither. The father's sister is called 'amita,' the mother's 'matertera';\r\nboth go in Greek by the name 'theia,' or, with some, 'tithis.'\r\n\r\n4 In the fourth degree, upwards, are the greatgreatgrandfather and\r\nthe greatgreatgrandmother; downwards, the greatgreatgrandson and the\r\ngreat-great-granddaughter; in the collateral line, the paternal greatuncle\r\nand greataunt, that is to say, the grandfather's brother and sister: the\r\nsame relations on the grandmother's side, that is to say, her brother\r\nand sister: and first cousins male and female, that is, children of\r\nbrothers and sisters in relation to one another. The children of two\r\nsisters, in relation to one another, are properly called 'consobrini,'\r\na corruption of 'consororini'; those of two brothers, in relation to one\r\nanother, 'fratres patrueles,' if males, 'sorores patrueles,' if females;\r\nand those of a brother and a sister, in relation to one another,\r\n'amitini'; thus the sons of your father's sister call you 'consobrinus,'\r\nand you call them 'amitini.'\r\n\r\n5 In the fifth degree, upwards, are the grandfather's great-grandfather\r\nand great-grandmother, downwards, the great-grandchildren of one's own\r\ngrandchildren, and in the collateral line the grandchildren of a brother\r\nor sister, a great-grandfather's or great-grandmother's brother or sister,\r\nthe children of one's first cousins, that is, of a 'frater-' or 'soror\r\npatruelis,' of a 'consobrinus' or 'consobrina,' of an 'amitinus' or\r\n'amitina,' and first cousins once removed, that is to say, the children\r\nof a great-uncle or great-aunt paternal or maternal.\r\n\r\n6 In the sixth degree, upwards, are the great-grandfather's\r\ngreat-grandfather and great-grandmother; downwards, the great-grandchildren\r\nof a great-grandchild, and in the collateral line the great-grandchildren\r\nof a brother or sister, as also the brother and sister of a\r\ngreat-great-grandfather or great-great-grandmother, and second cousins,\r\nthat is to say, the children of 'fratres-' or 'sorores patrueles,' of\r\n'consobrini,' or of 'amitini.'\r\n\r\n7 This will be enough to show how the degrees of relationship are\r\nreckoned; for from what has been said it is easy to understand how we\r\nought to calculate the remoter degrees also, each generation always\r\nadding one degree: so that it is far easier to say in what degree any\r\none is related to some one else than to indicate his relationship by the\r\nproper specific term.\r\n\r\n8 The degrees of agnation are also reckoned in the same manner;\r\n\r\n9 but as truth is fixed in the mind of man much better by the eye than\r\nby the ear, we have deemed it necessary, after giving an account of the\r\ndegree of relationship, to have a table of them inserted in the present\r\nbook, that so the youth may be able by both ears and eyes to gain a most\r\nperfect knowledge of them. [Note:--the pedagogical table is omitted in\r\nthe present edition.]\r\n\r\n10 It is certain that the part of the Edict in which the possession\r\nof goods is promised to the next of kin has nothing to do with the\r\nrelationships of slaves with one another, nor is there any old\r\nstatute by which such relationships were recognised. However, in\r\nthe constitution which we have issued with regard to the rights of\r\npatrons--a subject which up to our times had been most obscure, and\r\nfull of difficulties and confusion--we have been prompted by humanity\r\nto grant that if a slave shall beget children by either a free woman\r\nor another slave, or conversely if a slave woman shall bear children of\r\neither sex by either a freeman or a slave, and both the parents and the\r\nchildren (if born of a slave woman) shall become free, or if the mother\r\nbeing free, the father be a slave, and subsequently acquire his freedom,\r\nthe children shall in all these cases succeed their father and mother,\r\nand the patron's rights lie dormant. And such children we have called\r\nto the succession not only of their parents, but also of one another\r\nreciprocally, by this enactment, whether those born in slavery and\r\nsubsequently manumitted are the only children, or whether there be\r\nothers conceived after their parents had obtained their freedom, and\r\nwhether they all have the same father and mother, or the same father and\r\ndifferent mothers, or vice versa; the rules applying to children born in\r\nlawful wedlock being applied here also.\r\n\r\n11 To sum up all that we have said, it appears that persons related\r\nin the same degree of cognation to the deceased are not always called\r\ntogether, and that even a remoter is sometimes preferred to a nearer\r\ncognate. For as family heirs and those whom we have enumerated as\r\nequivalent to family heirs have a priority over all other claimants, it\r\nis clear that a great-grandson or great-great-grandson is preferred to a\r\nbrother, or the father or mother of the deceased; and yet the father and\r\nmother, as we have remarked above, are in the first degree of\r\ncognation, and the brother is in the second, while the great-grandson and\r\ngreat-great-grandson are only in the third and fourth respectively. And it\r\nis immaterial whether the descendant who ranks among family heirs was in\r\nthe power of the deceased at the time of his death, or out of it through\r\nhaving been emancipated or through being the child of an emancipated\r\nchild or a child of the female sex.\r\n\r\n12 When there are no family heirs, and none of those persons who we have\r\nsaid rank as such, an agnate who has lost none of his agnatic rights,\r\neven though very many degrees removed from the deceased, is usually\r\npreferred to a nearer cognate; for instance, the grandson or\r\ngreat-grandson of a paternal uncle has a better title than a maternal\r\nuncle or aunt. Accordingly, in saying that the nearest cognate is\r\npreferred in the succession, or that, if there are several cognates in\r\nthe nearest degree, they are called equally, we mean that this is the\r\ncase if no one is entitled to priority, according to what we have said,\r\nas either being or ranking as a family heir, or as being an agnate; the\r\nonly exceptions to this being emancipated brothers and sisters of the\r\ndeceased who are called to succeed him, and who, in spite of their loss\r\nof status, are preferred to other agnates in a remoter degree than\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE VII. OF THE SUCCESSION TO FREEDMEN\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the property of freedmen. These were originally\r\nallowed to pass over their patrons in their wills with impunity: for by\r\nthe statute of the Twelve Tables the inheritance of a freedman devolved\r\non his patron only when he died intestate without leaving a family\r\nheir. If he died intestate, but left a family heir, the patron was not\r\nentitled to any portion of this property, and this, if the family\r\nheir was a natural child, seemed to be no grievance; but if he was an\r\nadoptive child, it was clearly unfair that the patron should be debarred\r\nfrom all right to the succession.\r\n\r\n1 Accordingly this injustice of the law was at a later period corrected\r\nby the praetor's Edict, by which, if a freedman made a will, he was\r\ncommanded to leave his patron half his property; and, if he left him\r\nnothing at all, or less than a half, possession of such half was given\r\nto him against the testament. If, on the other hand, he died intestate,\r\nleaving as family heir an adoptive son, the patron could obtain even\r\nagainst the latter possession of the goods of the deceased to the extent\r\nof onehalf. But the freedman was enabled to exclude the patron if he\r\nleft natural children, whether in his power at the time of his death, or\r\nemancipated or given in adoption, provided that he made a will in which\r\nhe instituted them heirs to any part of the succession, or that, being\r\npassed over, they demanded possession against the will under the Edict:\r\n\r\n2 if disinherited, they did not avail to bar the patron. At a still\r\nlater period the lex Papia Poppaea augmented the rights of patrons\r\nwho had more wealthy freedmen. By this it was enacted that, whenever\r\na freedman left property amounting in value to a hundred thousand\r\nsesterces and upwards, and not so many as three children, the patron,\r\nwhether he died testate or intestate, should be entitled to a portion\r\nequal to that of a single child. Accordingly, if the freedman left\r\na single son or daughter as heir, the patron could claim half the\r\nproperty, exactly as if he had died without leaving any children: if he\r\nleft two children as heirs, the patron could claim a third: if he left\r\nthree, the patron was excluded altogether.\r\n\r\n3 In our constitution, however, which we have drawn up in a convenient\r\nform and in the Greek language, so as to be known by all, we have\r\nestablished the following rules for application to such cases. If the\r\nfreedman or freedwoman is less than a 'centenarius', that is, has\r\na fortune of less than a hundred aurei (which we have reckoned as\r\nequivalent to the sum of a hundred thousand sesterces fixed by the lex\r\nPapia), the patron shall have no right to any share in the succession\r\nif they make a will; while, if they die intestate without leaving any\r\nchildren, we have retained unimpaired the rights conferred on the patron\r\nby the Twelve Tables. If they are possessed of more than a hundred\r\naurei, and leave a descendant or descendants of either sex and any\r\ndegree to take the inheritance civil or praetorian, we have given to\r\nsuch child or children the succession to their parents, to the exclusion\r\nof every patron and his issue. If, however, they leave no children, and\r\ndie intestate, we have called the patron or patroness to their whole\r\ninheritance: while if they make a will, passing over their patron or\r\npatroness, and leaving no children, or having disinherited such as they\r\nhave, or (supposing them to be mothers or maternal grandfathers) having\r\npassed them over without leaving them the right to impeach the testament\r\nas unduteous, then, under our constitution, the patron shall succeed,\r\nby possession against the will, not, as before, to onehalf of the\r\nfreedman's estate, but to onethird, or, if the freedman or freedwoman\r\nhas left him less than this third in his or her will, to so much as will\r\nmake up the difference. But this third shall be free from all charges,\r\neven from legacies or trust bequests in favour of the children of\r\nthe freedman or freedwoman, all of which are to fall on the patron's\r\ncoheirs. In the same constitution we have gathered together the rules\r\napplying to many other cases, which we deemed necessary for the\r\ncomplete settlement of this branch of law: for instance, a title to the\r\nsuccession of freedmen is conferred not only on patrons and patronesses,\r\nbut on their children and collateral relatives to the fifth degree: all\r\nof which may be ascertained by reference to the constitution itself. If,\r\nhowever, there are several descendants of a patron or patroness, or of\r\ntwo or several, the nearest in degree is to take the succession of the\r\nfreedman or freedwoman, which is to be divided, not among the stocks,\r\nbut by counting the heads of those nearest in degree. And the same\r\nrule is to be observed with collaterals: for we have made the law of\r\nsuccession to freedmen almost identical with that relating to freeborn\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n4 All that has been said relates nowadays to freedmen who are Roman\r\ncitizens, for dediticii and Latini Iuniani having been together\r\nabolished there are now no others. As to a statutory right of succession\r\nto a Latin, there never was any such thing; for men of this class,\r\nthough during life they lived as free, yet as they drew their last\r\nbreath they lost their liberty along with their life, and under the lex\r\nIunia their manumitters kept their property, like that of slaves, as a\r\nkind of peculium. It was subsequently provided by the SC. Largianum\r\nthat the manumitter's children, unless expressly disinherited, should be\r\npreferred to his external heirs in succession to the goods of a Latin;\r\nand this was followed by the edict of the Emperor Trajan, providing that\r\na Latin who contrived, without the knowledge or consent of his patron,\r\nto obtain by imperial favour a grant of citizenship should live\r\na citizen, but die a Latin. Owing, however, to the difficulties\r\naccompanying these changes of condition, and others as well, we have\r\ndetermined by our constitution to repeal for ever the lex Iunia, the SC.\r\nLargianum, and the edict of Trajan, and to abolish them along with the\r\nLatins themselves, so as to enable all freedmen to enjoy the citizenship\r\nof Rome: and we have converted in a wonderful manner the modes in which\r\npersons became Latins, with some additions, into modes of attaining\r\nRoman citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE VIII. OF THE ASSIGNMENT OF FREEDMEN\r\n\r\nBefore we leave the subject of succession to freedmen, we should observe\r\na resolution of the Senate, to the effect that, though the property of\r\nfreedmen belongs in equal portions to all the patron's children who\r\nare in the same degree, it shall yet be lawful for a parent to assign\r\na freedman to one of his children, so that after his own death the\r\nassignee shall be considered his sole patron, and the other children\r\nwho, had it not been for such assignment, would be admitted equally with\r\nhim, shall have no claim to the succession whatever: though they recover\r\ntheir original rights if the assignee dies without issue.\r\n\r\n1 It is lawful to assign freedwomen as well as freedmen, and to\r\ndaughters and granddaughters no less than to sons and grandsons;\r\n\r\n2 and the power of assignment is conferred on all who have two or\r\nmore children in their power, and enables them to assign a freedman or\r\nfreedwoman to such children while so subject to them. Accordingly the\r\nquestion arose, whether the assignment becomes void, if the parent\r\nsubsequently emancipates the assignee? and the affirmative opinion,\r\nwhich was held by Julian and many others, has now become settled law.\r\n\r\n3 It is immaterial whether the assignment is made in a testament or\r\nnot, and indeed patrons are enabled to exercise this power in any terms\r\nwhatsoever, as is provided by the senatusconsult passed in the time of\r\nClaudius, when Suillus Rufus and Ostorius Scapula were consuls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE IX. OF POSSESSION OF GOODS\r\n\r\nThe law as to possession of goods was introduced by the praetor by way\r\nof amending the older system, and this not only in intestate succession,\r\nas has been described, but also in cases where deceased persons have\r\nmade a will. For instance, although the posthumous child of a\r\nstranger, if instituted heir, could not by the civil law enter upon the\r\ninheritance, because his institution would be invalid, he could with\r\nthe assistance of the praetor be made possessor of the goods by the\r\npraetorian law. Such a one can now, however, by our constitution be\r\nlawfully instituted, as being no longer unrecognised by the civil law.\r\n\r\n1 Sometimes, however, the praetor promises the possession of goods\r\nrather in confirmation of the old law than for the purpose of correcting\r\nor impugning it; as, for instance, when he gives possession in\r\naccordance with a duly executed will to those who have been instituted\r\nheirs therein. Again, he calls family heirs and agnates to the\r\npossession of goods on an intestacy; and yet, even putting aside the\r\npossession of goods, the inheritance belongs to them already by the\r\ncivil law.\r\n\r\n2 Those whom the praetor calls to a succession do not become heirs in\r\nthe eye of the law, for the praetor cannot make an heir, because persons\r\nbecome heirs by a statute only, or some similar ordinance such as a\r\nsenatusconsult or an imperial constitution: but as the praetor gives\r\nthem the possession of goods they become quasiheirs, and are called\r\n'possessors of goods.' And several additional grades of grantees of\r\npossession were recognised by the praetor in his anxiety that no\r\none might die without a successor; the right of entering upon an\r\ninheritance, which had been confined by the statute of the Twelve Tables\r\nwithin very narrow limits, having been conferred more extensively by him\r\nin the spirit of justice and equity.\r\n\r\n3 The following are the kinds of testamentary possession of goods.\r\nFirst, the socalled 'contratabular' possession, given to children who\r\nare merely passed over in the will. Second, that which the praetor\r\npromises to all duly instituted heirs, and which is for that reason\r\ncalled secundum tabulas. Then, having spoken of wills, the praetor\r\npasses on to cases of intestacy, in which, firstly, he gives the\r\npossession of goods which is called unde liberi to family heirs and\r\nthose who in his Edict are ranked as such. Failing these, he gives it,\r\nsecondly, to successors having a statutory title: thirdly, to the ten\r\npersons whom he preferred to the manumitter of a free person, if a\r\nstranger in relation to the latter, namely the latter's father and\r\nmother, grandparents paternal and maternal, children, grandchildren by\r\ndaughters as well as by sons, and brothers and sisters whether of the\r\nwhole or of the half blood only. The fourth degree of possession is\r\nthat given to the nearest cognates: the fifth is that called tum quam\r\nex familia: the sixth, that given to the patron and patroness, their\r\nchildren and parents: the seventh, that given to the husband or wife of\r\nthe deceased: the eighth, that given to cognates of the manumitter.\r\n\r\n4 Such was the system established by the praetorian jurisdiction. We,\r\nhowever, who have been careful to pass over nothing, but correct\r\nall defects by our constitutions, have retained, as necessary, the\r\npossession of goods called contra tabulas and secundum tabulas, and also\r\nthe kinds of possession upon intestacy known as unde liberis and unde\r\nlegitimi.\r\n\r\n5 The possession, however, which in the praetor's Edict occupied the\r\nfifth place, and was called unde decem personae, we have with benevolent\r\nintentions and with a short treatment shown to be superfluous. Its\r\neffect was to prefer to the extraneous manumitter the ten persons\r\nspecified above; but our constitution, which we have made concerning the\r\nemancipation of children, has in all cases made the parent implicitly\r\nthe manumitter, as previously under a fiduciary contract, and has\r\nattached this privilege to every such manumission, so as to render\r\nsuperfluous the aforesaid kind of possession of goods. We have therefore\r\nremoved it, and put in its place the possession which the praetor\r\npromises to the nearest cognates, and which we have thus made the fifth\r\nkind instead of the sixth.\r\n\r\n6 The possession of goods which formerly stood seventh in the list,\r\nwhich was called tum quam ex familia, and that which stood eighth,\r\nnamely, the possession entitled unde liberi patroni patronaeque et\r\nparentes eorum, we have altogether suppressed by our constitution\r\nrespecting the rights of patrons. For, having assimilated the succession\r\nto freedmen to the succession to freeborn persons, with this sole\r\nexception--in order to preserve some difference between the two\r\nclasses--that no one has any title to the former who is related more\r\ndistantly than the fifth degree, we have left them sufficient remedies\r\nin the 'contratabular' possession, and in those called unde legitimi and\r\nunde cognati, wherewith to vindicate their rights, so that thus all the\r\nsubtleties and inextricable confusion of these two kinds of possession\r\nof goods have been abolished.\r\n\r\n7 We have preserved in full force another possession of goods, which is\r\ncalled unde vir et uxor, and which occupied the ninth place in the old\r\nclassification, and have given it a higher place, namely, the sixth.\r\nThe tenth kind, which was called unde cognati manumissoris, we have\r\nvery properly abolished for reasons which have been already stated:\r\nthus leaving in full operation only six ordinary kinds of possession of\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n8 The seventh, which follows them, was introduced with most excellent\r\nreason by the praetors, whose Edict finally promised the possession\r\nof goods to those persons expressly entitled to it by any statute,\r\nsenatusconsult, or imperial constitution; but this was not permanently\r\nincorporated by the praetor with either the intestate or the\r\ntestamentary kinds of possession, but was accorded by him, as\r\ncircumstances demanded, as an extreme and extraordinary remedy to\r\nthose persons who claim, either under a will or on an intestacy,\r\nunder statutes, senatusconsults, or the more recent legislation of the\r\nemperors.\r\n\r\n9 The praetor, having thus introduced many kinds of successions, and\r\narranged them in a system, fixed a definite time within which the\r\npossession of goods must be applied for, as there are often several\r\npersons entitled in the same kind of succession, though related in\r\ndifferent degrees to the deceased, in order to save the creditors of\r\nthe estate from delay in their suits, and to provide them with a proper\r\ndefendant to sue; and with the object also of making it less easy\r\nfor them to obtain possession of the property of the deceased, as in\r\nbankruptcy, wherein they consulted their own advantage only. He allowed\r\nto children and parents, adoptive no less than natural, an interval of\r\na year, and to all other persons one hundred days, within which to make\r\nthe application.\r\n\r\n10 If a person entitled does not apply for the possession of goods\r\nwithin the time specified, his portion goes by accrual to those in the\r\nsame degree or class with himself: or, if there be none, the praetor\r\npromises by his successory edict the possession to those in the next\r\ndegree, exactly as if the person in the preceding one were nonexistent.\r\nIf any one refuses the possession of goods which he has the opportunity\r\nof accepting, it is not unusual to wait until the aforesaid interval,\r\nwithin which possession must be applied for, has elapsed, but the next\r\ndegree is admitted immediately under the same edict.\r\n\r\n11 In reckoning the interval, only those days are considered upon which\r\nthe persons entitled could have made application.\r\n\r\n12 Earlier emperors, however, have judiciously provided that no one\r\nneed trouble himself expressly to apply for the possession of goods,\r\nbut that, if he shall within the prescribed time in any manner have\r\nsignified his intention to accept, he shall have the full benefit of\r\nsuch tacit acceptance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE X. OF ACQUISITION BY ADROGATION\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of universal succession which owes its\r\nintroduction neither to the statute of the Twelve Tables nor to the\r\npraetor's Edict, but to the law which is based upon custom and consent.\r\n\r\n1 When an independent person gives himself in adrogation, all his\r\nproperty, corporeal and incorporeal, and all debts due to him formerly\r\npassed in full ownership to the adrogator, except such rights as are\r\nextinguished by loss of status, for instance, bounden services of\r\nfreedmen and rights of agnation. Use and usufruct, though formerly\r\nenumerated among such rights, have now been saved by our constitution\r\nfrom extinction by the least loss of status.\r\n\r\n2 But we have now confined acquisition by adrogation within the same\r\nlimits as acquisition through their children by natural parents; that is\r\nto say, adoptive as well as natural parents acquire no greater right\r\nin property which comes to children in their power from any extraneous\r\nsource than a mere usufruct; the ownership is vested in the children\r\nthemselves. But if a son who has been adrogated dies in his adoptive\r\nfamily, the whole of his property vests in the adrogator, failing those\r\npersons who, under our constitution, are preferred to the father in\r\nsuccession to property which is not acquired immediately from him.\r\n\r\n3 Conversely, the adrogator is not, by strict law, suable for the debts\r\nof his adoptive son, but an action may be brought against him as his\r\nrepresentative; and if he declines to defend the latter, the creditors\r\nare allowed, by an order of the magistrates having jurisdiction in such\r\ncases, to take possession of the property of which the usufruct as well\r\nas the ownership would have belonged to the son, had he not subjected\r\nhimself to the power of another, and to dispose of it in the mode\r\nprescribed by law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XI. OF THE ADJUDICATION OF A DECEASED PERSON'S ESTATE TO PRESERVE\r\nTHE GIFTS OF LIBERTY\r\n\r\nA new form of succession was added by a constitution of the Emperor\r\nMarcus, which provided that if slaves, who have received a bequest of\r\nliberty from their master in a will under which no heir takes, wish\r\nto have his property adjudged to them, their application shall be\r\nentertained.\r\n\r\n1 Such is the substance of a rescript addressed by the Emperor Marcus to\r\nPopilius Rufus, which runs as follows: 'If there is no successor to\r\ntake on the intestacy of Virginius Valens, who by his will has conferred\r\nfreedom on certain of his slaves, and if, consequently, his property\r\nis in danger of being sold, the magistrate who has cognizance of such\r\nmatters shall on application entertain your desire to have the property\r\nadjudged to you, in order to give effect to the bequests of liberty,\r\ndirect and fiduciary, provided you give proper security to the creditors\r\nfor payment of their claims in full. Slaves to whom liberty has been\r\ndirectly bequeathed shall become free exactly as if the inheritance had\r\nbeen actually accepted, and those whom the heir was requested to manumit\r\nshall obtain their liberty from you; provided that if you will have the\r\nproperty adjudged to you only upon the condition, that even the\r\nslaves who have received a direct bequest of liberty shall become your\r\nfreedmen, and if they, whose status is now in question, agree to this,\r\nwe are ready to authorize compliance with your wishes. And lest the\r\nbenefit afforded by this our rescript be rendered ineffectual in another\r\nway, by the Treasury laying claim to the property, be it hereby known\r\nto those engaged in our service that the cause of liberty is to be\r\npreferred to pecuniary advantage, and that they must so effect such\r\nseizures as to preserve the freedom of those who could have obtained it\r\nhad the inheritance been accepted under the will.'\r\n\r\n2 This rescript was a benefit not only to slaves thus liberated, but\r\nalso to the deceased testators themselves, by saving their property from\r\nbeing seized and sold by their creditors; for it is certain that such\r\nseizure and sale cannot take place if the property has been adjudged on\r\nthis account, because some one has come forward to defend the deceased,\r\nand a satisfactory defender too, who gives the creditors full security\r\nfor payment.\r\n\r\n3 Primarily, the rescript is applicable only where freedom is conferred\r\nby a will. How then will the case stand, if a man who dies intestate\r\nmakes gifts of freedom by codicils, and on the intestacy no one accepts\r\nthe inheritance? We answer, that the boon conferred by the constitution\r\nought not here to be refused. No one can doubt that liberty given, in\r\ncodicils, by a man who dies having made a will, is effectual.\r\n\r\n4 The terms of the constitution show that it comes into application when\r\nthere is no successor on an intestacy; accordingly, it is of no use so\r\nlong as it is uncertain whether there will be one or not; but, when this\r\nhas been determined in the negative, it at once becomes applicable.\r\n\r\n5 Again, it may be asked whether, if a person who abstains from\r\naccepting an inheritance can claim a judicial restoration of rights, the\r\nconstitution can still be applied, and the goods adjudged under it? And\r\nwhat, if such person obtains a restoration after they have been actually\r\nadjudged in order to give effect to the bequest of freedom? We reply\r\nthat gifts of liberty to which effect has once been given cannot\r\npossibly be recalled.\r\n\r\n6 The object with which this constitution was enacted was to give effect\r\nto bequests of liberty, and accordingly it is quite inapplicable where\r\nno such bequests are made. Supposing, however, that a man manumits\r\ncertain slaves in his lifetime, or in contemplation of death, and\r\nin order to prevent any questions arising whether the creditors have\r\nthereby been defrauded, the slaves are desirous of having the property\r\nadjudged to them, should this be permitted? and we are inclined to say\r\nthat it should, though the point is not covered by the terms of the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n7 Perceiving, however, that the enactment was wanting in many minute\r\npoints of this kind, we have ourselves issued a very full constitution,\r\nin which have been collected many conceivable cases by which the law\r\nrelating to this kind of succession has been completed, and with which\r\nany one can become acquainted by reading the constitution itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XII. OF UNIVERSAL SUCCESSIONS, NOW OBSOLETE, IN SALE OF GOODS UPON\r\nBANKRUPTCY, AND UNDER THE SC. CLAUDIANUM\r\n\r\nThere were other kinds of universal succession in existence prior to\r\nthat last before mentioned; for instance, the 'purchase of goods' which\r\nwas introduced with many prolixities of form for the sale of insolvent\r\ndebtors' estates, and which remained in use under the socalled\r\n'ordinary' system of procedure. Later generations adopted the\r\n'extraordinary' procedure, and accordingly sales of goods became\r\nobsolete along with the ordinary procedure of which they were a part.\r\nCreditors are now allowed to take possession of their debtor's property\r\nonly by the order of a judge, and to dispose of it as to them seems most\r\nadvantageous; all of which will appear more perfectly from the larger\r\nbooks of the Digest.\r\n\r\n1 There was too a miserable form of universal acquisition under the SC.\r\nClaudianum, when a free woman, through indulgence of her passion for a\r\nslave, lost her freedom by the senatusconsult, and with her freedom her\r\nproperty. But this enactment we deemed unworthy of our times, and have\r\nordered its abolition in our Empire, nor allowed it to be inserted in\r\nour Digest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XIII. OF OBLIGATIONS\r\n\r\nLet us now pass on to obligations. An obligation is a legal bond, with\r\nwhich we are bound by a necessity of performing some act according to\r\nthe laws of our State.\r\n\r\n1 The leading division of obligations is into two kinds, civil and\r\npraetorian. Those obligations are civil which are established by\r\nstatute, or at least are sanctioned by the civil law; those are\r\npraetorian which the praetor has established by his own jurisdiction,\r\nand which are also called honorary.\r\n\r\n2 By another division they are arranged in four classes, contractual,\r\nquasicontractual, delictal, and quasidelictal. And first, we must\r\nexamine those which are contractual, and which again fall into four\r\nspecies, for contract is concluded either by delivery, by a form of\r\nwords, by writing, or by consent: each of which we will treat in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XIV. OF REAL CONTRACTS, OR THE MODES IN WHICH OBLIGATIONS ARE\r\nCONTRACTED BY DELIVERY\r\n\r\nReal contracts, or contracts concluded by delivery, are exemplified\r\nby loan for consumption, that is to say, loan of such things as are\r\nestimated by weight, number, or measure, for instance, wine, oil, corn,\r\ncoined money, copper, silver, or gold: things in which we transfer\r\nour property on condition that the receiver shall transfer to us, at a\r\nfuture time, not the same things, but other things of the same kind and\r\nquality: and this contract is called mutuum, because thereby meum or\r\nmine becomes tuum or thine. The action to which it gives rise is called\r\na condiction.\r\n\r\n1 Again, a man is bound by a real obligation if he takes what is not\r\nowed him from another who pays him by mistake; and the latter can, as\r\nplaintiff, bring a condiction against him for its recovery, after the\r\nanalogy of the action whose formula ran 'if it be proved that he ought\r\nto convey,' exactly as if the defendant had received a loan from him.\r\nConsequently a pupil who, by mistake, is paid something which is not\r\nreally owed him without his guardian's authority, will no more be bound\r\nby a condiction for the recovery of money not owed than by one for money\r\nreceived as a loan: though this kind of liability does not seem to be\r\nfounded on contract; for a payment made in order to discharge a debt is\r\nintended to extinguish, not to create, an obligation.\r\n\r\n2 So too a person to whom a thing is lent for use is laid under a\r\nreal obligation, and is liable to the action on a loan for use. The\r\ndifference between this case and a loan for consumption is considerable,\r\nfor here the intention is not to make the object lent the property of\r\nthe borrower, who accordingly is bound to restore the same identical\r\nthing. Again, if the receiver of a loan for consumption loses what he\r\nhas received by some accident, such as fire, the fall of a building,\r\nshipwreck, or the attack of thieves or enemies, he still remains bound:\r\nbut the borrower for use, though responsible for the greatest care in\r\nkeeping what is lent him--and it is not enough that he has shown as much\r\ncare as he usually bestows on his own affairs, if only some one else\r\ncould have been more diligent in the charge of it--has not to answer for\r\nloss occasioned by fire or accident beyond his control, provided it\r\ndid not occur through any fault of his own. Otherwise, of course, it is\r\ndifferent: for instance, if you choose to take with you on a journey a\r\nthing which has been lent to you for use, and lose it by being attacked\r\nby enemies or thieves, or by a shipwreck, it is beyond question that you\r\nwill be liable for its restoration. A thing is not properly said to\r\nbe lent for use if any recompense is received or agreed upon for the\r\nservice; for where this is the case, the use of the thing is held to be\r\nhired, and the contract is of a different kind, for a loan for use ought\r\nalways to be gratuitous.\r\n\r\n3 Again, the obligation incurred by a person with whom a thing is\r\ndeposited for custody is real, and he can be sued by the action of the\r\ndeposit; he too being responsible for the restoration of the identical\r\nthing deposited, though only where it is lost through some positive\r\nact of commission on his part: for for carelessness, that is to say,\r\ninattention and negligence, he is not liable. Thus a person from whom\r\na thing is stolen, in the charge of which he has been most careless,\r\ncannot be called to account, because, if a man entrusts property to the\r\ncustody of a careless friend, he has no one to blame but himself for his\r\nwant of caution.\r\n\r\n4 Finally, the creditor who takes a thing in pledge is under a real\r\nobligation, and is bound to restore the thing itself by the action of\r\npledge. A pledge, however, is for the benefit of both parties; of\r\nthe debtor, because it enables him to borrow more easily, and of\r\nthe creditor, because he has the better security for repayment; and\r\naccordingly, it is a settled rule that the pledgee cannot be held\r\nresponsible for more than the greatest care in the custody of the\r\npledge; if he shows this, and still loses it by some accident, he\r\nhimself is freed from all liability, without losing his right to sue for\r\nthe debt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XV. OF VERBAL OBLIGATION\r\n\r\nAn obligation is contracted by question and answer, that is to say, by a\r\nform of words, when we stipulate that property shall be conveyed to\r\nus, or some other act be performed in our favour. Such verbal contracts\r\nground two different action, namely condiction, when the stipulation is\r\ncertain, and the action on stipulation, when it is uncertain; and the\r\nname is derived from stipulum, a word in use among the ancients to mean\r\n'firm,' coming possibly from stipes, the trunk of a tree.\r\n\r\n1 In this contract the following forms of words were formerly sanctioned\r\nby usage: 'Do you engage yourself to do so and so?' 'I do engage\r\nmyself.' 'Do you promise?' 'I do promise.' 'Do you pledge your credit?'\r\n'I pledge my credit.' 'Do you guarantee?' 'I guarantee.' 'Will you\r\nconvey?' 'I will convey.' 'Will you do?' 'I will do.' Whether the\r\nstipulation is in Latin, or Greek, or any other language, is immaterial,\r\nprovided the two parties understand one another, so that it is not\r\nnecessary even that they should both speak in the same tongue, so long\r\nas the answer corresponds to the question, and thus two Greeks, for\r\ninstance, may contract an obligation in Latin. But it was only in former\r\ntimes that the solemn forms referred to were in use: for subsequently,\r\nby the enactment of Leo's constitution, their employment was rendered\r\nunnecessary, and nothing was afterwards required except that the parties\r\nshould understand each other, and agree to the same thing, the words in\r\nwhich such agreement was expressed being immaterial.\r\n\r\n2 The terms of a stipulation may be absolute, or performance may either\r\nbe postponed to some future time, or be made subject to a condition.\r\nAn absolute stipulation may be exemplified by the following: 'Do you\r\npromise to give five aurei?' and here (if the promise be made) that sum\r\nmay be instantly sued for. As an instance of stipulation in diem, as\r\nit is called where a future day is fixed for payment, we may take the\r\nfollowing: 'Do you promise to give ten aurei on the first of March?' In\r\nsuch a stipulation as this, an immediate debt is created, but it cannot\r\nbe sued upon until the arrival of the day fixed for payment: and even on\r\nthat very day an action cannot be brought, because the debtor ought to\r\nhave the whole of it allowed to him for payment; for otherwise, unless\r\nthe whole day on which payment was promised is past, it cannot be\r\ncertain that default has been made.\r\n\r\n3 If the terms of your stipulation run 'Do you promise to pay me ten\r\naurei a year so long as I live?' the obligation is deemed absolute, and\r\nthe liability perpetual, for a debt cannot be owed till a certain\r\ntime only; though if the promisee's heir sues for payment, he will be\r\nsuccessfully met by the plea of contrary agreement.\r\n\r\n4 A stipulation is conditional, when performance is made to depend on\r\nsome uncertain event in the future, so that it becomes actionable only\r\non something being done or omitted: for instance, 'Do you promise to\r\ngive five aurei if Titius is made consul?' If, however, a man stipulates\r\nin the form 'Do you promise to give so and so, if I do not go up to the\r\nCapitol?' the effect is the same as if he had stipulated for payment to\r\nhimself at the time of his death. The immediate effect of a conditional\r\nstipulation is not a debt, but merely the expectation that at some time\r\nthere will be a debt: and this expectation devolves on the stipulator's\r\nheir, supposing he dies himself before fulfilment of the condition.\r\n\r\n5 It is usual in stipulations to name a place for payment; for instance,\r\n'Do you promise to give at Carthage?' Such a stipulation as this, though\r\nin its terms absolute, implies a condition that enough time shall be\r\nallowed to the promisor to enable him to pay the money at Carthage.\r\nAccordingly, if a man at Rome stipulates thus, 'Do you promise to pay\r\ntoday at Carthage?' the stipulation is void, because the performance of\r\nthe act to be promised is a physical impossibility.\r\n\r\n6 Conditions relating to past or present time either make the obligation\r\nvoid at once, or have no suspensive operation whatever. Thus, in the\r\nstipulation 'Do you promise to give so and so, if Titius has been\r\nconsul, or if Maevius is alive?' the promise is void, if the condition\r\nis not satisfied; while if it is, it is binding at once: for events\r\nwhich in themselves are certain do not suspend the binding force of an\r\nobligation, however uncertain we ourselves may be about them.\r\n\r\n7 The performance or nonperformance of an act may be the object of a\r\nstipulation no less than the delivery of property, though where this is\r\nthe case, it will be best to connect the nonperformance of the act to be\r\nperformed, or the performance of the act to be omitted, with a pecuniary\r\npenalty to be paid in default, lest there be doubt as to the value of\r\nthe act or omission, which will make it necessary for the plaintiff to\r\nprove to what damages he is entitled. Thus, if it be a performance\r\nwhich is stipulated for, some such penalty should be added as in the\r\nfollowing: 'If so and so is not done, do you promise to pay ten aurei as\r\na penalty?' And if the performance of some acts, and the nonperformance\r\nof others, are bargained for in the same stipulation, a clause of the\r\nfollowing kind should be added, 'If any default is made, either as\r\ncontrary to what is agreed upon, or by way of nonperformance, do you\r\npromise to pay a penalty of ten aurei?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XVI. OF STIPULATIONS IN WHICH THERE ARE TWO CREDITORS OR TWO\r\nDEBTORS\r\n\r\nThere may be two or more parties on either side in a stipulation, that\r\nis to say, as promisors or promisees. Joint promises are so constituted\r\nby the promisor answering, 'I promise,' after they have all first\r\nasked the question; for instance, if after two promises have separately\r\nstipulated from him, he answers, 'I promise to give so and so to each of\r\nyou.' But if he first promises to Titius, and then, on another's putting\r\nthe question to him, promises to him too, there will be two distinct\r\nobligations, namely, one between him and each of the promisees, and they\r\nare not considered joint promisees at all. The usual form to constitute\r\ntwo or more joint promisors is as follows,--'Maevius, do you promise to\r\ngive five aurei? Seius, do you promise to give the same five aurei?' and\r\nin answer they reply separately, 'I promise.'\r\n\r\n1 In obligations of this kind each joint promisee is owed the whole sum,\r\nand the whole sum can be claimed from each joint promisor; and yet\r\nin both cases but one payment is due, so that if one joint promisee\r\nreceives the debt, or one joint promisor pays it, the obligation is\r\nthereby extinguished for all, and all are thereby released from it.\r\n\r\n2 Of two joint promisors one may be bound absolutely, while performance\r\nby the other is postponed to a future day, or made to depend on a\r\ncondition; but such postponement or such condition in no way prevents\r\nthe stipulator from at once suing the one who was bound absolutely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XVII. OF STIPULATIONS MADE BY SLAVES\r\n\r\nFrom his master's legal capacity a slave derives ability to be promisee\r\nin a stipulation. Thus, as an inheritance in most matters represents\r\nthe legal 'person' of the deceased, whatever a slave belonging to it\r\nstipulates for, before the inheritance is accepted, he acquires for the\r\ninheritance, and so for the person who subsequently becomes heir.\r\n\r\n1 All that a slave acquires by a stipulation he acquires for his master\r\nonly, whether it was to that master, or himself, or his fellow slave, or\r\nno one in particular that performance was to be made under the contract;\r\nand the same principle applies to children in power, so far as they now\r\nare instruments of acquisition for their father.\r\n\r\n2 When, however, what is stipulated for is permission to do some\r\nspecific act, that permission cannot extend beyond the person of the\r\npromisee: for instance, if a slave stipulates for permission to cross\r\nthe promisor's land, he cannot himself be denied passage, though his\r\nmaster can.\r\n\r\n3 A stipulation by a slave belonging to joint owners enures to the\r\nbenefit of all of them in proportion to the shares in which they own\r\nhim, unless he stipulated at the bidding, or expressly in favour, of one\r\nof them only, in which case that one alone is benefited. Where a jointly\r\nowned slave stipulates for the transfer of property which cannot be\r\nacquired for one of his two masters, the contract enures to the benefit\r\nof the other only: for instance, where the stipulation is for the\r\ntransfer of a thing which already belongs to one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XVIII. OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF STIPULATIONS\r\n\r\nStipulations are either judicial, praetorian, conventional, or common:\r\nby the latter being meant those which are both praetorian and judicial.\r\n\r\n1 Judicial stipulations are those which it is simply part of the judge's\r\nduty to require; for instance, security against fraud, or for the\r\npursuit of a runaway slave, or (in default) for payment of his value.\r\n\r\n2 Those are praetorian, which the praetor is bound to exact simply in\r\nvirtue of his magisterial functions; for instance, security against\r\napprehended damage, or for payment of legacies by an heir. Under\r\npraetorian stipulations we must include also those directed by the\r\naedile, for these too are based upon jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n3 Conventional stipulations are those which arise merely from the\r\nagreement of the parties, apart from any direction of a judge or of the\r\npraetor, and which one may almost say are of as many different kinds as\r\nthere are conceivable objects to a contract.\r\n\r\n4 Common stipulations may be exemplified by that by which a guardian\r\ngives security that his ward's property will not be squandered or\r\nmisappropriated, which he is sometimes required to enter into by the\r\npraetor, and sometimes also by a judge when the matter cannot be managed\r\nin any other way; or, again, we might take the stipulation by which an\r\nagent promises that his acts shall be ratified by his principal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XIX. OF INVALID STIPULATIONS\r\n\r\nAnything, whether movable or immovable, which admits of private\r\nownership, may be made the object of a stipulation; 1 but if a man\r\nstipulates for the delivery of a thing which either does not or cannot\r\nexist, such as Stichus, who is dead but whom he though alive, or an\r\nimpossible creature, like a hippocentaur, the contract will be void.\r\n\r\n2 Precisely the same principles applies where a man stipulates for the\r\ndelivery of a thing which is sacred or religious, but which he thought\r\nwas a subject of human ownership, or of a thing which is public, that is\r\nto say, devoted in perpetuity to the use and enjoyment of the people\r\nat large, like a forum or theatre, or of a free man whom he thought a\r\nslave, or of a thing which he is incapable of owning, or which is\r\nhis own already. And the fact that a thing which is public may\r\nbecome private property, that a free man may become a slave, that the\r\nstipulator may become capable of owning such and such a thing, or that\r\nsuch and such a thing may cease to belong to him, will not avail to\r\nmerely suspend the force of the stipulation in these cases, but it is\r\nvoid from the outset. Conversely, a stipulation which originally\r\nwas perfectly good may be avoided by the thing, which is its object,\r\nacquiring any of the characters just specified through no fault of the\r\npromisor. And a stipulation, such as 'do you promise to convey Lucius\r\nTitius when he shall be a slave' and others like it, are also void from\r\nthe beginning; for objects which by their very nature cannot be owned by\r\nman cannot either in any way be made the object of an obligation.\r\n\r\n3 If one man promises that another shall convey, or do so and so, as,\r\nfor instance, that Titius shall give five aurei, he will not be bound,\r\nthough he will if he promises to get Titius to give them.\r\n\r\n4 If a man stipulates for conveyance to, or performance in favour of,\r\nanother person who is not his paterfamilias, the contract is void;\r\nthough of course performance to a third person may be bargained for (as\r\nin the stipulation 'do you promise to give to me or to Seius?'); where,\r\nthough the obligation is created in favour of the stipulator only,\r\npayment may still be lawfully made to Seius, even against the\r\nstipulator's will, the result of which, if it is done, being that the\r\npromisor is entirely released from his obligation, while the stipulator\r\ncan sue Seius by the action of agency. If a man stipulates for payment\r\nof ten aurei to himself and another who is not his paterfamilias, the\r\ncontract will be good, though there has been much doubt whether in such\r\na case the stipulator can sue for the whole sum agreed upon, or only\r\nhalf; the law is now settled in favour of the smaller sum. If you\r\nstipulate for performance in favour of one in your power, all benefit\r\nunder the contract is taken by yourself, for your words are as the words\r\nof your son, as his words are as yours, in all cases in which he is\r\nmerely an instrument of acquisition for you.\r\n\r\n5 Another circumstance by which a stipulation may be avoided is want of\r\ncorrespondence between question and answer, as where a man stipulates\r\nfrom you for payment of ten aurei, and you promise five, or vice versa;\r\nor where his question is unconditional, your answer conditional, or vice\r\nversa, provided only that in this latter case the difference is express\r\nand clear; that is to say, if he stipulates for payment on fulfilment\r\nof a condition, or on some determinate future day, and you answer: 'I.\r\npromise to pay today,' the contract is void; but if you merely answer:\r\n'I promise,' you are held by this laconic reply to have undertaken\r\npayment on the day, or subject to the condition specified; for it is not\r\nessential that every word used by the stipulator should be repeated in\r\nthe answer of the promise.\r\n\r\n6 Again, no valid stipulation can be made between two persons of whom\r\none is in the power of the other. A slave indeed cannot be under an\r\nobligation to either his master or anybody else: but children in power\r\ncan be bound in favour of any one except their own paterfamilias.\r\n\r\n7 The dumb, of course, cannot either stipulate or promise, nor can the\r\ndeaf, for the promisee in stipulation must hear the answer, and the\r\npromisor must hear the question; and this makes it clear that we are\r\nspeaking of persons only who are stone deaf, not of those who (as it is\r\nsaid) are hard of hearing.\r\n\r\n8 A lunatic cannot enter into any contract at all, because he does not\r\nunderstand what he is doing.\r\n\r\n9 On the other hand a pupil can enter into any contract, provided that\r\nhe has his guardian's authority, when necessary, as it is for incurring\r\nan obligation, though not for imposing an obligation on another person.\r\n\r\n10 This concession of legal capacity of disposition is manifestly\r\nreasonable in respect of children who have acquired to some\r\nunderstanding, for children below the age of seven years, or who have\r\njust passed that age, resemble lunatics in want of intelligence. Those,\r\nhowever, who have just completed their seventh year are permitted, by\r\na beneficent interpretation of the law, in order to promote their\r\ninterests, to have the same capacity as those approaching the age of\r\npuberty; but a child below the latter age, who is in paternal power,\r\ncannot bind himself even with his father's sanction.\r\n\r\n11 An impossible condition is one which, according to the course of\r\nnature, cannot be fulfilled, as, for instance, if one says: 'Do\r\nyou promise to give if I. touch the sky with my finger?' But if the\r\nstipulation runs: 'Do you promise to give if I do not touch the sky with\r\nmy finger?' it is considered unconditional, and accordingly can be sued\r\nupon at once.\r\n\r\n12 Again, a verbal obligation made between persons who are not present\r\nwith one another is void. This rule, however, afforded contentious\r\npersons opportunities of litigation, by alleging, after some interval,\r\nthat they, or their adversaries, had not been present on the occasion in\r\nquestion; and we have therefore issued a constitution, addressed to the\r\nadvocates of Caesarea, in order with the more dispatch to settle such\r\ndisputes, whereby it is enacted that written documents in evidence of a\r\ncontract which recite the presence of the parties shall be taken to\r\nbe indisputable proof of the fact, unless the person, who resorts to\r\nallegations usually so disgraceful, proves by the clearest evidence,\r\neither documentary or borne by credible witnesses, that he or his\r\nadversary was elsewhere than alleged during the whole day on which the\r\ndocument is stated to have been executed.\r\n\r\n13 Formerly, a man could not stipulate that a thing should be conveyed\r\nto him after his own death, or after that of the promisor; nor could one\r\nperson who was in another's power even stipulate for conveyance after\r\nthat person's death, because he was deemed to speak with the voice of\r\nhis parent or master; and stipulations for conveyance the day before the\r\npromisee's or promisor's decease were also void. Stipulation, however,\r\nas has already been remarked, derive their validity from the consent\r\nof the contracting parties, and we therefore introduced a necessary\r\nemendation in respect also of this rule of law, by providing that a\r\nstipulation shall be good which bargains for performance either after\r\nthe death, or the day before the death, of either promisee or promisor.\r\n\r\n14 Again, a stipulation in the form: 'Do you promise to give today, if\r\nsuch or such a ship arrives from Asia tomorrow?' was formerly void, as\r\nbeing preposterous in its expression, because what should come last\r\nis put first. Leo, however, of famous memory held that a preposterous\r\nstipulation in the settlement of a dowry ought not to be rejected as\r\nvoid, and we have determined to allow it perfect validity in every case,\r\nand not merely in that in which it was formerly sanctioned.\r\n\r\n15 A stipulation, say by Titius, in the form: 'Do you promise to give\r\nwhen I shall die' or 'when you shall die'? is good now, as indeed it\r\nalways was even under the older law.\r\n\r\n16 So too a stipulation for performance after the death of a third\r\nperson is good.\r\n\r\n17 If a document in evidence of a contract states that so and so\r\npromised, the promise is deemed to have been given in answer to a\r\npreceding question.\r\n\r\n18 When several acts of conveyance or performance are comprised in\r\na single stipulation, if the promisor simply answers: 'I promise to\r\nconvey,' he becomes liable on each and all of them, but if he answers\r\nthat he will convey only one or some of them, he incurs an obligation in\r\nrespect of those only which are comprised in his answer, there being\r\nin reality several distinct stipulations of which only one or some\r\nare considered to have acquired binding force: for for each act of\r\nconveyance or performance there ought to be a separate question and a\r\nseparate answer.\r\n\r\n19 As has been already observed, no one can validly stipulate for\r\nperformance to a person other than himself, for the purpose of this\r\nkind of obligation is to enable persons to acquire for themselves that\r\nwhereby they are profited, and a stipulator is not profited if the\r\nconveyance is made to a third person. Hence, if it be wished to make\r\na stipulation in favour of any such third person, a penalty should be\r\nstipulated for, to be paid, in default of performance of that which is\r\nin reality the object of the contract, to the party who otherwise would\r\nhave no interest in such performance; for when one stipulates for a\r\npenalty, it is not his interest in what is the real contract which\r\nis considered, but only the amount to be forfeited to him upon\r\nnonfulfilment of the condition. So that a stipulation for conveyance\r\nto Titius, but made by some one else, is void: but the addition of a\r\npenalty, in the form 'If you do not convey, do you promise to pay me so\r\nmany aurei?' makes it good and actionable.\r\n\r\n20 But where the promisor stipulates in favour of a third person, having\r\nhimself an interest in the performance of the promise, the stipulation\r\nis good. For instance, if a guardian, after beginning to exercise his\r\ntutorial functions, retires from their exercise in favour of his fellow\r\nguardian, taking from him by stipulation security for the due charge of\r\nthe ward's property, he has a sufficient interest in the performance\r\nof this promise, because the ward could have sued him in case of\r\nmaladministration, and therefore the obligation is binding. So too a\r\nstipulation will be good by which one bargains for delivery to one's\r\nagent, or for payment to one's creditor, for in the latter case one may\r\nbe so far interested in the payment that, if it not be made, one will\r\nbecome liable to a penalty or to having a foreclosure of estates which\r\none has mortgaged.\r\n\r\n21 Conversely, he who promises that another shall do so and so is not\r\nbound unless he promises a penalty in default;\r\n\r\n22 and, again, a man cannot validly stipulate that property which will\r\nhereafter be his shall be conveyed to him as soon as it becomes his own.\r\n\r\n23 If a stipulator and the promisor mean different things, there is no\r\ncontractual obligation, but it is just as if no answer had been made to\r\nthe question; for instance, if one stipulates from you for Stichus, and\r\nyou think he means Pamphilus, whose name you believed to be Stichus.\r\n\r\n24 A promise made for an illegal or immoral purpose, as, for instance,\r\nto commit a sacrilege or homicide, is void.\r\n\r\n25 If a man stipulates for performance on the fulfilment of a condition,\r\nand dies before such fulfilment, his heir can sue on the contract when\r\nit occurs: and the heir of the promisor can be sued under the same\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n26 A stipulation for a conveyance this year, or this month, cannot be\r\nsued upon until the whole year, or the whole month, has elapsed:\r\n\r\n27 and similarly the promisee cannot sue immediately upon a stipulation\r\nfor the conveyance of an estate or a slave, but only after allowing a\r\nsufficient interval for the conveyance to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XX. OF FIDEJUSSORS OR SURETIES\r\n\r\nVery often other persons, called fidejussors or sureties, are bound for\r\nthe promisor, being taken by promises as additional security.\r\n\r\n1 Such sureties may accompany any obligation, whether real, verbal,\r\nliteral or consensual: and it is immaterial even whether the principal\r\nobligation be civil or natural, so that a man may go surety for the\r\nobligation of a slave either to a stranger or to his master.\r\n\r\n2 A fidejussor is not only bound himself, but his obligation devolves\r\nalso on his heir' 3 and the contract of suretyship may be entered into\r\nbefore no less than after the creation of the principal obligation.\r\n\r\n4 If there are several fidejussors to the same obligation, each of them,\r\nhowever many they are, is liable for the whole amount, and the creditor\r\nmay sue whichever he chooses for the whole; but by the letter of Hadrian\r\nhe may be compelled to sue for only an aliquot part, determined by the\r\nnumber of sureties who are solvent at the commencement of the action: so\r\nthat if one of them is insolvent at that time the liability of the rest\r\nis proportionately increased. Thus, if one fidejussor pay the whole\r\namount, he alone suffers by the insolvency of the principal debtor; but\r\nthis is his own fault, as he might have availed himself of the letter of\r\nHadrian, and required that the claim should be reduced to his rateable\r\nportion.\r\n\r\n5 Fidejussors cannot be bound for more than their principal, for their\r\nobligation is but accessory to the latter's, and the accessory cannot\r\ncontain more than the principal; but they can be bound for less. Thus,\r\nif the principal debtor promised ten aurei, the fidejussor can well be\r\nbound for five, but not vice versa; and if the principal's promise\r\nis absolute, that of the fidejussor may be conditional, though a\r\nconditional promise cannot be absolutely guaranteed, for more and less\r\nis to be understood of time as well as of quantity, immediate payment\r\nbeing regarded as more, and future payment as less.\r\n\r\n6 For the recovery of anything paid by him for the principal the\r\nfidejussor can sue the latter by the action on agency.\r\n\r\n7 A fidejussor may be taken in Greek, by using the expressions 'tei\r\nemei pistei keleuo,' 'lego,' 'thelo,' or 'boulomai'; and 'phemi' will be\r\ntaken as equivalent to 'lego.'\r\n\r\n8 It is to be observed that in the stipulations of fidejussors the\r\ngeneral rule is that whatever is stated in writing to have been done is\r\ntaken to have really been done; and, accordingly, it is settled law that\r\nif a man signs his name to a paper stating that he became a fidejussor,\r\nall formalities are presumed to have been duly observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXI. OF LITERAL OBLIGATION\r\n\r\nFormerly there was a kind of obligation made by writing, and said to\r\nbe contracted by the entry of a debt in a ledger; but such entries have\r\nnowadays gone out of use. Of course, if a man states in writing that he\r\nowes money which has never been paid over to him, he cannot be allowed,\r\nafter a considerable interval, to defend himself by the plea that\r\nthe money was not, in fact, advanced; for this is a point which has\r\nfrequently been settled by imperial constitutions. The consequence is,\r\nthat even at the present day a person who is estopped from this plea is\r\nbound by his written signature, which (even of course where there is no\r\nstipulation) is ground for a condiction. The length of time after\r\nwhich this defence could not be pleaded was formerly fixed by\r\nimperial constitutions at five years; but it has been reduced by our\r\nconstitution, in order to save creditors from a more extended risk of\r\nbeing defrauded of their money, so that now it cannot be advanced after\r\nthe lapse of two years from the date of the alleged payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXII. OF OBLIGATION BY CONSENT\r\n\r\nObligations contracted by mere consent are exemplified by sale, hire,\r\npartnership and agency, which are called consensual contracts because no\r\nwriting, nor the presence of the parties, nor any delivery is required\r\nto make the obligation actionable, but the consent of the parties is\r\nsufficient. Parties who are not present together, therefore, can form\r\nthese contracts by letter, for instance, or by messenger: and they are\r\nin their nature bilateral, that is, both parties incur a reciprocal\r\nobligation to perform whatever is just and fair, whereas verbal\r\ncontracts are unilateral, one party being promisee, and the other alone\r\npromisor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXIII. OF PURCHASE AND SALE\r\n\r\nThe contract of purchase and sale is complete immediately the price\r\nis agreed upon, and even before the price or as much as any earnest is\r\npaid: for earnest is merely evidence of the completion of the contract.\r\nIn respect of sales unattested by any written evidence this is a\r\nreasonable rule, and so far as they are concerned we have made no\r\ninnovations. By one of our constitutions, however, we have enacted, that\r\nno sale effected by an agreement in writing shall be good or binding,\r\nunless that agreement is written by the contracting parties themselves,\r\nor, if written by some one else, is at least signed by them, or finally,\r\nif written by a notary, is duly drawn by him and executed by the\r\nparties. So long as any of these requirements is unsatisfied, there is\r\nroom to retract, and either purchaser or vendor may withdraw from the\r\nagreement with impunity--provided, that is to say, that no earnest has\r\nbeen given. Where earnest has been given, and either party refuses to\r\nperform the contract, that party, whether the agreement be in writing or\r\nnot, if purchaser forfeits what he has given, and if vendor is compelled\r\nto restore double of what he has received, even though there has been no\r\nexpress agreement in the matter of earnest.\r\n\r\n1 It is necessary that the price should be settled, for without a\r\nprice there can be no purchase and sale, and it ought to be a fixed and\r\ncertain price. For instance, where the parties agreed that the thing\r\nshould be sold at a price to be subsequently fixed by Titius, the older\r\njurists doubted much whether this was a valid contract of sale or not.\r\nThe doubt has been settled in the following way by our decision; if the\r\nthird person named actually fixes the price, it must certainly be paid,\r\nas settled by him, and the thing must be delivered, in order to give\r\neffect to the sale; the purchaser (if not fairly treated) suing by the\r\naction on purchase, and the vendor by the action on sale. But if the\r\nthird person named will not or cannot fix the price, the sale will\r\nbe void, because no price has been settled. This rule, which we have\r\nadopted with regard to sales, may reasonably be extended also to\r\ncontracts of hire.\r\n\r\n2 The price, too, should be in money; for it used to be much disputed\r\nwhether anything else, such as a slave, a piece of land, or a robe,\r\ncould be treated as a price. Sabinus and Cassius held the affirmative,\r\nexplaining thus the common theory that exchange is a species, and the\r\noldest species, of purchase and sale; and in their support they quoted\r\nthe lines of Homer, who says in a certain passage that the army of the\r\nGreeks procured themselves wine by giving other things in exchange,\r\nthe actual words being as follow: 'then the longhaired Greeks bought\r\nthemselves wine, some with bronze, some with shining iron, some\r\nwith hides, some with live oxen, some with slaves.' The other school\r\nmaintained the negative, and distinguished between exchange on the one\r\nhand, and purchase and sale on the other: for if an exchange were the\r\nsame thing as a sale, it would be impossible to determine which is the\r\nthing sold, and which is the price, and both things cannot be regarded\r\nin each of these characters. The opinion, however, of Proculus, who\r\naffirmed that exchange was a species of contract apart by itself, and\r\ndistinct from sale, has deservedly prevailed, as it is confirmed by\r\nother lines from Homer, and by still more cogent reasons, and this has\r\nbeen admitted by preceding Emperors, and is fully stated in our Digest.\r\n\r\n3 As soon as the contract of sale is concluded--that is, as we have\r\nsaid, as soon as the price is agreed upon, if the contract is not in\r\nwriting--the thing sold is immediately at the risk of the purchaser,\r\neven though it has not yet been delivered to him. Accordingly, if a\r\nslave dies, or is injured in any part of his body, or if a house is\r\neither totally or partially burnt down, or if a piece of land is wholly\r\nor partially swept away by a river flood, or is reduced in acreage by\r\nan inundation, or made of less value by a storm blowing down some of\r\nits trees, the loss falls on the purchaser, who must pay the price even\r\nthough he has not got what he purchased. The vendor is not responsible\r\nand does not suffer for anything not due to any design or fault of his\r\nown. If, however, after the purchase of a piece of land, it receives an\r\nincrease by alluvion, it is the purchaser who profits thereby: for the\r\nprofit ought to belong to him who also bears the risk. And if a slave\r\nwho has been sold runs away, or is stolen, without any design or fault\r\nof the vendor, one should look to see whether the latter expressly\r\nundertook to keep him safely until delivery was made; for, if he did\r\nthis, the loss falls upon him, though otherwise he incurs no liability:\r\nand this is a rule which applies to all animals and other objects\r\nwhatsoever. The vendor, however, will be bound to transfer to the\r\npurchaser all his rights of action for the recovery of the object or\r\ndamages, for, not having yet delivered it to the purchaser, he still\r\nremains its owner, and the same holds good of the penal actions on theft\r\nand on unlawful damage.\r\n\r\n4 A sale may be made conditionally as well as absolutely. The following\r\nis an example of a conditional sale: 'If Stichus meets with your\r\napproval within a certain time, he shall be purchased by you for so many\r\naurei.'\r\n\r\n5 If a man buys a piece of land which is sacred, religious, or public,\r\nsuch as a forum or basilica, knowing it to be such, the purchase is\r\nvoid. But if the vendor has fraudulently induced him to believe that\r\nwhat he was buying was not sacred, or was private property, as he cannot\r\nlegally have what he contracted for, he can bring the action on purchase\r\nto recover damages for what he has lost by the fraud; and the same rule\r\napplies to the purchase of a free man represented by the vendor to be a\r\nslave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXIV. OF LETTING AND HIRING\r\n\r\nThe contract of hire resembles very closely the contract of sale, and\r\nthe same rules of law apply to both. Thus, as the contract of sale is\r\nconcluded as soon as the price is agreed upon, so the contract of hire\r\nis held to be concluded as soon as the sum to be paid for the hiring is\r\nsettled, and from that moment the letter has an action on the letting,\r\nand the hirer on the hiring.\r\n\r\n1 What we have said above as to a sale in which the price is left to be\r\nfixed by a third person must be understood to apply also to a contract\r\nof hire in which the amount to be paid for hire is left to be fixed in\r\nthe same way. Consequently, if a man gives clothes to a fuller to clean\r\nor finish, or to a tailor to mend, and the amount of hire is not fixed\r\nat the time, but left to subsequent agreement between the parties, a\r\ncontract of hire cannot properly be said to have been concluded, but\r\nan action is given on the circumstances, as amounting to an innominate\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\n2 Again, a question often arose in connexion with the contract of hire\r\nsimilar to that which was so common, namely, whether an exchange was a\r\nsale. For instance, what is the nature of the transaction if a man gives\r\nyou the use or enjoyment of a thing, and receives in return the use or\r\nenjoyment of another thing from you? It is now settled that this is not\r\na contract of hire, but a kind of contract apart by itself. Thus, if\r\na man had one ox, and his neighbour another, and they agreed that each\r\nshould in turn lend the other his ox for ten days to make use of, and\r\nthen one of the oxen died while working for the man to whom it did not\r\nbelong, an action cannot be brought on hire, nor on a loan for use, for\r\na loan for use ought to be gratuitous: but an action should be brought\r\nas on an innominate contract.\r\n\r\n3 So nearly akin, indeed, is purchase and sale, to letting and hiring,\r\nthat in some cases it is a question to which class of the two a contract\r\nbelongs. As an instance may be taken those lands which are delivered\r\nover to be enjoyed for ever, upon the terms, that is to say, that so\r\nlong as the rent is paid to the owner it shall not be lawful for the\r\nlatter to take the lands away from either the original hirer, or his\r\nheir, or any one else to whom he or his heirs has conveyed them by sale,\r\ngift, dowry, or in any other way whatsoever. The questionings of the\r\nearlier lawyers, some of whom thought this kind of contract a hiring,\r\nand others a sale, occasioned the enactment of the statute of Zeno,\r\nwhich determined that this contract of emphyteusis, as it is called, was\r\nof a peculiar nature, and should not be included under either hire or\r\nsale, but should rest on the terms of the agreement in each particular\r\ncase: so that if anything were agreed upon between the parties, this\r\nshould bind them exactly as if it were inherent in the very nature of\r\nthe contract; while if they did not agree expressly at whose risk the\r\nland should be, it should be at that of the owner in case of total\r\ndestruction, and at that of the tenant, if the injury were merely\r\npartial. And these rules we have adopted in our legislation.\r\n\r\n4 Again, if a goldsmith agrees to make Titius rings of a certain weight\r\nand pattern out of his own gold for, say, ten aurei, it is a question\r\nwhether the contract is purchase and sale or letting and hiring. Cassius\r\nsays the material is bought and sold, the labour let and hired; but it\r\nis now settled that there is only a purchase and sale. But if Titius\r\nprovided the gold, and agreed to pay him for his work, the contract is\r\nclearly a letting and hiring.\r\n\r\n5 The hirer ought to observe all the terms of the contract, and in the\r\nabsence of express agreement his obligations should be ascertained by\r\nreference to what is fair and equitable. Where a man has either given or\r\npromised for hire for the use of clothes, silver, or a beast of burden,\r\nhe is required in his charge of it to show as much care as the most\r\ndiligent father of a family shows in his own affairs; if he do this, and\r\nstill accidentally lose it, he will be under no obligation to restore\r\neither it or its value.\r\n\r\n6 If the hirer dies before the time fixed for the termination of the\r\ncontract has elapsed, his heir succeeds to his rights and obligations in\r\nrespect thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXV. OF PARTNERSHIP\r\n\r\nA partnership either extends to all the goods of the partners, when the\r\nGreeks call it by the special name of 'koinopraxia,' or is confined to\r\na single sort of business, such as the purchase and sale of slaves, oil,\r\nwine, or grain.\r\n\r\n1 If no express agreement has been made as to the division of the profit\r\nand loss, an equal division of both is understood to be intended, but\r\nif it has, such agreement ought to be carried into effect; and there\r\nhas never been any doubt as to the validity of a contract between two\r\npartners that one shall take twothirds of the profit and bear twothirds\r\nof the loss, and that the remaining third shall be taken and borne\r\nrespectively by the other.\r\n\r\n2 If Titius and Seius agreed that the former should take twothirds of\r\nthe profits, and bear only onethird of the loss, and that the latter\r\nshould bear twothirds of the loss, and take only onethird of the\r\nprofits, it has been made a question whether such an agreement ought to\r\nbe held valid. Quintus Mucius thought such an arrangement contrary to\r\nthe very nature of partnership, and therefore not to be supported: but\r\nServius Sulpicius, whose opinion has prevailed, was of a different view,\r\nbecause the services of a particular partner are often so valuable that\r\nit is only just to admit him to the business on more favourable terms\r\nthan the rest. It is certain that a partnership may be formed on the\r\nterms that one partner shall contribute all the capital, and that\r\nthe profits shall be divided equally, for a man's services are often\r\nequivalent to capital. Indeed, the opinion of Quintus Mucius is now so\r\ngenerally rejected, that it is admitted to be a valid contract that\r\na partner shall take a share of the profits, and bear no share in the\r\nloss, which indeed Servius, consistently with his opinion, maintained\r\nhimself. This of course must be taken to mean that if there is a profit\r\non one transaction, and a loss on another, a balance should be struck,\r\nand only the net profit be considered as profits.\r\n\r\n3 It is quite clear that if the shares are expressed in one event only,\r\nas for instance in the event of profit, but not in the event of loss, or\r\nvice versa, the same proportions must be observed, in the event of which\r\nno mention has been made, as in the other.\r\n\r\n4 The continuance of partnership depends on the continuing consent of\r\nthe members; it is dissolved by notice of withdrawal from any one of\r\nthem. But of course if the object of a partner in withdrawing from the\r\npartnership is to fraudulently keep for himself some accruing gain--for\r\ninstance, if a partner in all goods succeeds to an inheritance, and\r\nwithdraws from the partnership in order to have exclusive possession\r\nthereof--he will be compelled to divide this gain with his partners; but\r\nwhat he gains undesignedly after withdrawing he keeps to himself, and\r\nhis partner always has the exclusive benefit of whatever accrues to him\r\nafter such withdrawal.\r\n\r\n5 Again, a partnership is dissolved by the death of a partner, for when\r\na man enters into a contract of partnership, he selects as his partner\r\na definite person. Accordingly, a partnership based on the agreement\r\nof even several persons is dissolved by the death of one of them, even\r\nthough several others survive, unless when the contract was made it was\r\notherwise agreed.\r\n\r\n6 So too a partnership formed for the attainment of some particular\r\nobject is terminated when that object is attained.\r\n\r\n7 It is clear too that a partnership is dissolved by the forfeiture of\r\nthe property of one of the partners, for such an one, as he is replaced\r\nby a successor, is reckoned civilly dead.\r\n\r\n8 So again, if one of the partners is in such embarrassed circumstances\r\nas to surrender all his property to his creditors, and all that he\r\npossessed is sold to satisfy the public or private claims upon him,\r\nthe partnership is dissolved, though if the members still agree to be\r\npartners, a new partnership would seem to have begun.\r\n\r\n9 It has been doubted whether one partner is answerable to another on\r\nthe action of partnership for any wrong less than fraud, like the bailee\r\nin a deposit, or whether he is not suable also for carelessness, that is\r\nto say, for inattention and negligence; but the latter opinion has now\r\nprevailed, with this limitation, that a partner cannot be required\r\nto satisfy the highest standard of carefulness, provided that in\r\npartnership business he shows as much diligence as he does in his own\r\nprivate affairs: the reason for this being that if a man chooses as his\r\npartner a careless person, he has no one to blame but himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXVI. OF AGENCY\r\n\r\nOf the contract of agency there are five modes. A man gives you a\r\ncommission either for his own exclusive benefit, or for his own and\r\nyours together, or for that of some third person, or for his own and the\r\nthird person's, or for the third person's and yours. A commission given\r\nsimply for the sake of the agent gives rise in reality to no relation\r\nof agency, and accordingly no obligation comes into existence, and\r\ntherefore no action.\r\n\r\n1 A commission is given solely for the benefit of the principal when,\r\nfor instance, the latter instructs you to manage his business, to buy\r\nhim a piece of land, or to enter into a stipulation as surety for him.\r\n\r\n2 It is given for your benefit and for that of your principal together\r\nwhen he, for instance, commissions you to lend money at interest to a\r\nperson who borrows it for your principal's benefit; or where, on your\r\nwishing to sue him as surety for some one else, he commissions you to\r\nsue his principal, himself undertaking all risk: or where, at his risk,\r\nyou stipulate for payment from a person whom he substitutes for himself\r\nas your debtor.\r\n\r\n3 It is given for the benefit of a third person when, for instance, some\r\none commissions you to look after Titius's affairs as general agent, or\r\nto buy Titius a piece of land, or to go surety for him.\r\n\r\n4 It is for the benefit of the principal and a third person when, for\r\ninstance, some one instructs you to look after affairs common to himself\r\nand Titius, or to buy an estate for himself and Titius, or to go surety\r\nfor them jointly.\r\n\r\n5 It is for the benefit of yourself and a third person when, for\r\ninstance, some one instructs you to lend money at interest to Titius; if\r\nit were to lend money free of interest, it would be for the benefit of\r\nthe third person only.\r\n\r\n6 It is for your benefit alone if, for instance, some one commissions\r\nyou to invest your money in the purchase of land rather than to lend it\r\nat interest, or vice versa. But such a commission is not really so\r\nmuch a commission in the eye of the law as a mere piece of advice, and\r\nconsequently will not give rise to an obligation, for the law holds no\r\none responsible as on agency for mere advice given, even if it turns\r\nout ill for the person advised, for every one can find out for himself\r\nwhether what he is advised to do is likely to turn out well or ill.\r\nConsequently, if you have money lying idle in your cashbox, and on so\r\nand so's advice buy something with it, or put it out at interest, you\r\ncannot sue that person by the action on agency although your purchase\r\nor loan turns out a bad speculation; and it has even been questioned, on\r\nthis principle, whether a man is suable on agency who commissions you to\r\nlend money to Titius; but the prevalent opinion is that of Sabinus, that\r\nso specific a recommendation is sufficient to support an action, because\r\n(without it) you would never have lent your money to Titius at all.\r\n\r\n7 So too instructions to commit an unlawful or immoral act do not create\r\na legal obligation--as if Titius were to instigate you to steal, or to\r\ndo an injury to the property or person of some one else; and even if you\r\nact on his instructions, and have to pay a penalty in consequence, you\r\ncannot recover its amount from Titius.\r\n\r\n8 An agent ought not to exceed the terms of his commission. Thus, if\r\nsome one commissions you to purchase an estate for him, but not to\r\nexceed the price of a hundred aurei, or to go surety for Titius up\r\nto that amount, you ought not in either transaction to exceed the sum\r\nspecified: for otherwise you will not be able to sue him on the agency.\r\nSabinus and Cassius even thought that in such a case you could not\r\nsuccessfully sue him even for a hundred aurei, though the leaders of\r\nthe opposite school differed from them, and the latter opinion is\r\nundoubtedly less harsh. If you buy the estate for less, you will have\r\na right of action against him, for a direction to buy an estate for a\r\nhundred aurei is regarded as an implied direction to buy, if possible,\r\nfor a smaller sum.\r\n\r\n9 The authority given to an agent duly constituted can be annulled by\r\nrevocation before he commences to act upon it.\r\n\r\n10 Similarly, the death of either the principal or the agent before the\r\nlatter commences to act extinguishes the agent's authority; but equity\r\nhas so far modified this rule that if, after the death of a principal\r\nand without having notice of his decease, an agent executes his\r\ncommission, he can sue on the agency: for otherwise the law would be\r\npenalizing a reasonable and unavoidable ignorance. Similar to this is\r\nthe rule, that debtors who pay a manumitted steward, say, of Titius,\r\nwithout notice of his manumission, are discharged from liability, though\r\nby the strict letter of the law they are not discharged, because they\r\nhave not paid the person whom they were bound to pay.\r\n\r\n11 It is open to every one to decline a commission of agency, but\r\nacceptance must be followed by execution, or by a prompt resignation, in\r\norder to enable the principal to carry out his purpose either personally\r\nor by the appointment of another agent. Unless the resignation is made\r\nin such time that the principal can attain his object without suffering\r\nany prejudice, an action will lie at his suit, in default of proof by\r\nthe agent that he could not resign before, or that his resignation,\r\nthough inconvenient, was justifiable.\r\n\r\n12 A commission of agency may be made to take effect from a specified\r\nfuture day, or may be subject to a condition.\r\n\r\n13 Finally, it should be observed that unless the agent's services\r\nare gratuitous, the relation between him and the principal will not be\r\nagency proper, but some other kind of contract; for if a remuneration is\r\nfixed, the contract is one of hiring. And generally we may say that in\r\nall cases where, supposing a man's services are gratuitous, there would\r\nbe a contract of agency or deposit, there is held to be a contract of\r\nhiring if remuneration is agreed upon; consequently, if you give clothes\r\nto a fuller to clean or to finish, or to a tailor to mend, without\r\nagreeing upon or promising any remuneration, you can be sued by the\r\naction on agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXVII. OF QUASI-CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION\r\n\r\nHaving enumerated the different kinds of contracts, let us now examine\r\nthose obligations also which do not originate, properly speaking, in\r\ncontract, but which, as they do not arise from a delict, seem to be\r\nquasicontractual.\r\n\r\n1 Thus, if one man has managed the business of another during the\r\nlatter's absence, each can sue the other by the action on uncommissioned\r\nagency; the direct action being available to him whose business was\r\nmanaged, the contrary action to him who managed it. It is clear that\r\nthese actions cannot properly be said to originate in a contract, for\r\ntheir peculiarity is that they lie only where one man has come forward\r\nand managed the business of another without having received any\r\ncommission so to do, and that other is thereby laid under a legal\r\nobligation even though he knows nothing of what has taken place. The\r\nreason of this is the general convenience; otherwise people might be\r\nsummoned away by some sudden event of pressing importance, and without\r\ncommissioning any one to look after and manage their affairs, the result\r\nof which would be that during their absence those affairs would be\r\nentirely neglected: and of course no one would be likely to attend to\r\nthem if he were to have no action for the recovery of any outlay he\r\nmight have incurred in so doing. Conversely, as the uncommissioned\r\nagent, if his management is good, lays his principal under a legal\r\nobligation, so too he is himself answerable to the latter for an account\r\nof his management; and herein he must show that he has satisfied the\r\nhighest standard of carefulness, for to have displayed such carefulness\r\nas he is wont to exercise in his own affairs is not enough, if only a\r\nmore diligent person could have managed the business better.\r\n\r\n2 Guardians, again, who can be sued by the action on guardianship,\r\ncannot properly be said to be bound by contract, for there is no\r\ncontract between guardian and ward: but their obligation, as\r\nit certainly does not originate in delict, may be said to be\r\nquasicontractual. In this case too each party has a remedy against\r\nthe other: not only can the ward sue the guardian directly on the\r\nguardianship, but the guardian can also sue the ward by the contrary\r\naction of the same name, if he has either incurred any outlay in\r\nmanaging the ward's property, or bound himself on his behalf, or pledged\r\nhis own property as security for the ward's creditors.\r\n\r\n3 Again, where persons own property jointly without being partners, by\r\nhaving, for instance, a joint bequest or gift made to them, and one of\r\nthem is liable to be sued by the other in a partition suit because he\r\nalone has taken its fruits, or because the plaintiff has laid out money\r\non it in necessary expenses: here the defendant cannot properly be said\r\nto be bound by contract, for there has been no contract made between the\r\nparties; but as his obligation is not based on delict, it may be said to\r\nbe quasicontractual.\r\n\r\n4 The case is exactly the same between joint heirs, one of whom is\r\nliable to be sued by the other on one of these grounds in an action for\r\npartition of the inheritance.\r\n\r\n5 So, too, the obligation of an heir to discharge legacies cannot\r\nproperly be called contractual, for it cannot be said that the legatee\r\nhas contracted at all with either the heir or the testator: yet, as\r\nthe heir is not bound by a delict, his obligation would seem to be\r\nquasicontractual.\r\n\r\n6 Again, a person to whom money not owed is paid by mistake is thereby\r\nlaid under a quasicontractual obligation; an obligation, indeed, which\r\nis so far from being contractual, that, logically, it may be said to\r\narise from the extinction rather than from the formation of a contract;\r\nfor when a man pays over money, intending thereby to discharge a debt,\r\nhis purpose is clearly to loose a bond by which he is already bound, not\r\nto bind himself by a fresh one. Still, the person to whom money is thus\r\npaid is laid under an obligation exactly as if he had taken a loan for\r\nconsumption, and therefore he is liable to a condiction.\r\n\r\n7 Under certain circumstances money which is not owed, and which is paid\r\nby mistake, is not recoverable; the rule of the older lawyers on this\r\npoint being that wherever a defendant's denial of his obligation is\r\npunished by duplication of the damages to be recovered--as in actions\r\nunder the lex Aquilia, and for the recovery of a legacy--he cannot get\r\nthe money back on this plea. The older lawyers, however, applied this\r\nrule only to such legacies of specific sums of money as were given by\r\ncondemnation; but by our constitution, by which we have assimilated\r\nlegacies and trust bequests, we have made this duplication of damages\r\non denial an incident of all actions for their recovery, provided the\r\nlegatee or beneficiary is a church, or other holy place honoured for its\r\ndevotion to religion and piety. Such legacies, although paid when not\r\ndue, cannot be reclaimed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXVIII. OF PERSONS THROUGH WHOM WE CAN ACQUIRE OBLIGATIONS\r\n\r\nHaving thus gone through the classes of contractual and quasicontractual\r\nobligations, we must remark that rights can be acquired by you not only\r\non your own contracts, but also on those of persons in your power--that\r\nis to say, your slaves and children. What is acquired by the contracts\r\nof your slaves becomes wholly yours; but the acquisitions of children in\r\nyour power by obligations must be divided on the principle of ownership\r\nand usufruct laid down in our constitution: that is to say, of the\r\nmaterial results of an action brought on an obligation made in favour\r\nof a son the father shall have the usufruct, though the ownership is\r\nreserved to the son himself: provided, of course, that the action is\r\nbrought by the father, in accordance with the distinction drawn in our\r\nrecent constitution.\r\n\r\n1 Freemen also, and the slaves of another person, acquire for you if\r\nyou possess them in good faith, but only in two cases, namely, when they\r\nacquire by their own labour, or in dealing with your property.\r\n\r\n2 A usufructuary or usuary slave acquires under the same conditions for\r\nhim who has the usufruct or use.\r\n\r\n3 It is settled law that a slave jointly owned acquires for all his\r\nowners in the proportion of their property in him, unless he names one\r\nexclusively in a stipulation, or in the delivery of property to himself,\r\nin which case he acquires for him alone; as in the stipulation 'do you\r\npromise to convey to Titius, my master?' If it was by the direction of\r\none of his joint owners only that he entered into a stipulation, the\r\neffect was formerly doubted; but now it has been settled by our decision\r\nthat (as is said above) under such circumstances he acquires for him\r\nonly who gave him the order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XXIX. OF THE MODES IN WHICH OBLIGATIONS ARE DISCHARGED\r\n\r\nAn obligation is always extinguished by performance of what is owed,\r\nor by performance of something else with the creditor's assent. It is\r\nimmaterial from whom the performance proceeds--be it the debtor himself,\r\nor some one else on his behalf: for on performance by a third person the\r\ndebtor is released, whether he knows of it or not, and even when it is\r\nagainst his will. Performance by the debtor releases, besides himself,\r\nhis sureties, and conversely performance by a surety releases, besides\r\nhimself, the principal debtor.\r\n\r\n1 Acceptilation is another mode of extinguishing an obligation, and\r\nis, in its nature, an acknowledgement of a fictitious performance. For\r\ninstance, if something is due to Titius under a verbal contract, and he\r\nwishes to release it, it can be done by his allowing the debtor to ask\r\n'that which I promised thee has thou received?' and by his replying 'I\r\nhave received it.' An acceptilation can be made in Greek, provided the\r\nform corresponds to that of the Latin words, as 'exeis labon denaria\r\ntosa; exo labon.' This process, as we said, discharges only obligations\r\nwhich arise from verbal contract, and no others, for it seemed only\r\nnatural that where words can bind words may also loose: but a debt due\r\nfrom any other cause may be transformed into a debt by stipulation, and\r\nthen released by an imaginary verbal payment or acceptilation. So, too,\r\nas a debt can be lawfully discharged in part, so acceptilation may be\r\nmade of part only.\r\n\r\n2 A stipulation has been invented, commonly called Aquilian, by which\r\nan obligation of any kind whatsoever can be clothed in stipulation form,\r\nand then extinguished by acceptilation; for by this process any kind of\r\nobligation may be novated. Its terms, as settled by Gallus Aquilius,\r\nare as follow: 'Whatever, and on whatsoever ground, you are or shall\r\nbe compellable to convey to or do for me, either now or on a future\r\nspecified day, and for whatsoever I have or shall have against you an\r\naction personal or real, or any extraordinary remedy, and whatsoever of\r\nmine you hold or possess naturally or civilly, or would possess, or now\r\nfail to possess through some wilful fault of your own--as the value of\r\neach and all of these claims Aulua Agerius stipulated for the payment\r\nof such and such a sum, and payment was formally promised by Numerius\r\nNegidius.' Then conversely, Numerius Negidius asked Aulus Agerius, 'hast\r\nthou received the whole of what I have today engaged, by the Aquilian\r\nstipulation, to pay thee?' to which Aulus Agerius replied 'I have it,\r\nand account it received.'\r\n\r\n3 Novation is another mode of extinguishing an obligation, and takes\r\nplace when you owe Seius a sum, and he stipulates for payment thereof\r\nfrom Titius; for the intervention of a new person gives birth to a new\r\nobligation, and the first obligation is transformed into the second, and\r\nceases to exist. Sometimes indeed the first stipulation is avoided by\r\nnovation even though the second is of no effect: for instance, if you\r\nowe Titius a sum, and he stipulates for payment thereof from a pupil\r\nwithout his guardian's authority, he loses his claim altogether, for\r\nyou, the original debtor, are discharged, and the second obligation is\r\nunenforceable. The same does not hold if one stipulate from a slave; for\r\nthen the former debtor continues bound as fully as if one had stipulated\r\nfrom no one. But when the original debtor is the promisor, a second\r\nstipulation produces a novation only if it contains something new--if\r\na condition, for instance, or a term, or a surety be added, or taken\r\naway--though, supposing the addition of a condition, we must be\r\nunderstood to mean that a novation is produced only if the condition\r\nis accomplished: if it fails, the prior obligation continues in force.\r\nAmong the older lawyers it was an established rule, that a novation was\r\neffected only when it was with that intention that the parties entered\r\ninto the second obligation; but as this still left it doubtful when\r\nthe intention was present and when absent, various presumptions were\r\nestablished as to the matter by different persons in different cases.\r\nWe therefore issued our constitution, enacting most clearly that no\r\nnovation shall take place unless the contracting parties expressly state\r\ntheir intention to be the extinction of the prior obligation, and that\r\nin default of such statement, the first obligation shall subsist, and\r\nhave the second also added to it: the result being two obligations\r\nresting each on its own independent ground, as is prescribed by the\r\nconstitution, and as can be more fully ascertained by perusing the same.\r\n\r\n4 Moreover, those obligations which are contracted by consent alone are\r\ndissolved by a contrary agreement. For instance, if Titius and Seius\r\nagree that the latter shall buy an estate at Tusculum for a hundred\r\naurei, and then before execution on either side by payment of the price\r\nor delivery of the estate they arrange to abandon the sale, they are\r\nboth released. The case is the same with hire and the other contracts\r\nwhich are formed by consent alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE I. OF OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM DELICT\r\n\r\nHaving treated in the preceding Book of contractual and quasicontractual\r\nobligations, it remains to inquire into obligations arising from delict.\r\nThe former, as we remarked in the proper place, are divided into four\r\nkinds; but of these latter there is but one kind, for, like obligations\r\narising from real contracts, they all originate in some act, that is to\r\nsay, in the delict itself, such as a theft, a robbery, wrongful damage,\r\nor an injury.\r\n\r\n1 Theft is a fraudulent dealing with property, either in itself, or in\r\nits use, or in its possession: an offence which is prohibited by natural\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n2 The term furtum, or theft, is derived either from furvum, meaning\r\n'black,' because it is effected secretly and under cover, and usually by\r\nnight: or from fraus, or from ferre, meaning 'carrying off'; or from the\r\nGreek word phor, thief, which indeed is itself derived from pherein, to\r\ncarry off.\r\n\r\n3 There are two kinds of theft, theft detected in the commission, and\r\nsimple theft: the possession of stolen goods discovered upon search, and\r\nthe introduction of stolen goods, are not (as will appear below) so\r\nmuch specific kinds of theft as actionable circumstances connected\r\nwith theft. A thief detected in the commission is termed by the Greeks\r\nep'autophoro; in this kind is included not only he who is actually\r\ncaught in the act of theft, but also he who is detected in the place\r\nwhere the theft is committed; for instance, one who steals from a house,\r\nand is caught before he has got outside the door; or who steals olives\r\nfrom an olive garden, or grapes from a vineyard, and is caught while\r\nstill in the olive garden or vineyard. And the definition of theft\r\ndetected in the commission must be even further extended, so as to\r\ninclude the thief who is caught or even seen with the stolen goods still\r\nin his hands, whether the place be public or private, and whether the\r\nperson who sees or catches him be the owner of the property, or some\r\nthird person, provided he has not yet escaped to the place where he\r\nintended to take and deposit his booty: for if he once escapes there,\r\nit is not theft detected in the commission, even if he be found with the\r\nstolen goods upon him. What is simple theft is clear from what has\r\nbeen said: that is to say, it is all theft which is not detected in the\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\n4 The offence of discovery of stolen goods occurs when a person's\r\npremises are searched in the presence of witnesses, and the stolen\r\nproperty is found thereon; this makes him liable, even though innocent\r\nof theft, to a special action for receiving stolen goods. To introduce\r\nstolen goods is to pass them off to a man, on whose premises they are\r\ndiscovered, provided this be done with the intent that they shall be\r\ndiscovered on his premises rather than on those of the introducer. The\r\nman on whose premises they are found may sue the latter, though innocent\r\nof theft, in an action for the introduction of stolen goods. There is\r\nalso an action for refusal of search, available against him who prevents\r\nanother who wishes to look in the presence of witnesses for stolen\r\nproperty; and finally, by the action for nonproduction of stolen goods,\r\na penalty is imposed by the praetor's edict on him who has failed to\r\nproduce stolen property which is searched for and found on his premises.\r\nBut the lastnamed actions, namely, those for receiving stolen goods, for\r\nintroducing them, for refusal of search, and for nonproduction, have now\r\nbecome obsolete: for the search for such property is no longer made in\r\nthe old fashion, and accordingly these actions went out of use also.\r\nIt is obvious, however, that any one who knowingly receives and hides\r\nstolen property may be sued by the action for simple theft.\r\n\r\n5 The penalty for theft detected in the commission is four times the\r\nvalue, and for simple theft twice the value, of the property stolen,\r\nwhether the thief be a slave or a free person.\r\n\r\n6 Theft is not confined to carrying away the property of another with\r\nthe intent of appropriation, but comprises also all corporeal dealing\r\nwith the property of another against the will of the owner. Thus, for\r\na pawnee to use the thing which he has in pawn, or to use a thing\r\ncommitted to one's keeping as a deposit, or to put a thing which is lent\r\nfor use to a different use than that for which it was lent, is theft; to\r\nborrow plate, for instance, on the representation that the borrower\r\nis going to entertain his friends, and then to carry it away into the\r\ncountry: or to borrow a horse for a drive, and then to take it out of\r\nthe neighbourhood, or like the man in the old story, to take it into\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n7 With regard, however, to those persons who put a thing lent for use to\r\na different purpose than the lender contemplated, the rule is that they\r\nare guilty of theft only if they know it to be contrary to the will of\r\nthe owner, and that if he had notice he would refuse permission; but\r\nif they believe that he would give permission, it is not theft: and the\r\ndistinction is just, for there is no theft without unlawful intention.\r\n\r\n8 It is also said not to be theft if a man turns a thing lent for use to\r\na use other than he believes its owner would sanction, though in point\r\nof fact its owner is consenting. Whence arose the following question:\r\nif Antoninus solicits the slave of Peri to steal property of the latter,\r\nand convey it to him, and the slave informs Peri of it, who, wishing\r\nto detect Antoninus in the very act, allows the slave to convey the\r\nproperty to him; can an action of theft, or for corrupting the slave, or\r\nneither, be maintained against Antoninus? The case was submitted to us,\r\nand we examined the conflicting opinions of the earlier jurists on the\r\nmatter: some of whom thought that neither action lay, and others, that\r\nPeri might sue on theft only. But we, in order to put an end to such\r\nquibbles, have enacted by our decision that in such case both the action\r\non theft and that for corrupting a slave shall lie. It is true that the\r\nslave has not been corrupted by the advances made to him, so that the\r\ncase does not come within the rules which introduced the action for\r\nsuch corruption: yet the wouldbe corrupter's intention was to make him\r\ndishonest, so that he is liable to a penal action, exactly as if the\r\nslave had actually been corrupted, lest his immunity from punishment\r\nshould encourage others to perpetrate a similar wrong on a slave less\r\nstrong to resist temptation.\r\n\r\n9 A free man too may be the subject of a theft--for instance, a child in\r\nmy power, if secretly removed from my control.\r\n\r\n10 So too a man sometimes steals his own property--for instance, a\r\ndebtor who purloins the goods which he has pledged to a creditor.\r\n\r\n11 Theft may be chargeable on a person who is not the perpetrator; on\r\nhim, namely, by whose aid and abetment a theft is committed. Among such\r\npersons we may mention the man who knocks money out of your hand for\r\nanother to pick up, or who stands in your way that another may snatch\r\nsomething from you, or scatters your sheep or your oxen, that another\r\nmay steal them, like the man in the old books, who waved a red cloth to\r\nfrighten a herd. If the same thing were done as a frolic, without the\r\nintention of assisting a theft, the proper action is not theft, but on\r\nthe case. Where, however, Titius commits theft with the aid of Maevius,\r\nboth are liable to an action on theft. A man, too, is held to have aided\r\nand abetted a theft who places a ladder under a window, or breaks open\r\na window or a door, in order that another may steal, or who lends tools\r\nfor the breaking of them open, or a ladder to place under a window, if\r\nhe knows the object for which they are borrowed. It is clear that a\r\nman is not liable on theft, who, though he advises and instigates an\r\noffence, does not actually aid in its commission.\r\n\r\n12 If a child in power, or a slave, steal property of his father or\r\nmaster, it is theft, and the property is deemed stolen, so that no one\r\ncan acquire it by usucapion until it has returned into the hands of the\r\nowner; but no action will lie on the theft, because between a son in\r\npower and his father, or between a slave and his master, no action will\r\nlie on any ground whatsoever. But if the offender is aided and abetted\r\nby a third person, the latter is liable to an action on theft, because a\r\ntheft has in fact been committed, and by his aid and abetment.\r\n\r\n13 The action on theft will lie at the suit of any person interested in\r\nthe security of the property, even though he be not its owner: indeed,\r\neven the owner cannot maintain the action unless he suffers damage from\r\nthe loss.\r\n\r\n14 Hence, when a pawn is stolen the pawnee can sue, even though his\r\ndebtor be perfectly able to pay the debt; for it is more advantageous\r\nto him to rely on the pledge, than to bring a personal action: and this\r\nrule is so unbending that even the pawnor who steals a pawn is suable\r\nfor theft by the pawnee.\r\n\r\n15 So, if clothes are delivered to be cleaned or finished or mended for\r\na certain remuneration, and then are stolen, it is the fuller or tailor\r\nwho can sue on the theft, and not the owner; for the owner suffers\r\nnothing by the loss, having the action of letting against the fuller or\r\ntailor for the recovery of his property. Similarly a purchaser in good\r\nfaith, even though a good title as owner is not given to him, can bring\r\nthe action of theft if the property is stolen, exactly like the pawnee.\r\nThe action is, however, not maintainable at the suit of a fuller or\r\ntailor, unless he is solvent, that is to say, unless he is able to fully\r\nindemnify the owner; if he is insolvent, the owner cannot recover from\r\nhim, and so can maintain an action against the thief, being, on this\r\nhypothesis, interested in the recovery of the property. Where the fuller\r\nor tailor is only partly instead of wholly solvent the rule is the same.\r\n\r\n16 The older lawyers held that what has been said of the fuller and\r\ntailor applied also to the borrower for use, on the ground that as\r\nthe remuneration which the fuller receives makes him responsible for\r\ncustody, so the advantages which the borrower derives from the use\r\nrequires him to keep it safely at his peril. Our wisdom, however, has\r\namended the law in this particular in our decisions, by allowing the\r\nowner the option of suing either the borrower by action on the loan, or\r\nthe thief by action of theft; though when his choice has been determined\r\nhe cannot change his mind, and resort to the other action. If he prefers\r\nto sue the thief, the borrower is absolutely released from liability;\r\nbut if he proceeds against the borrower, he cannot in any way himself\r\nsue the thief on the stealing, though this may be done by the borrower,\r\nwho is defendant in the other action, provided that the owner knew, at\r\nthe time when he began his action against the borrower, that the thing\r\nhad been stolen. If he is ignorant of this, or even if he is merely\r\ndoubtful whether the borrower still has the property in his possession\r\nor not, and sues him on the loan, he may, on subsequently learning the\r\nfacts, and if he wishes to drop the action which he has commenced, and\r\nsue the thief instead, adopt this course, in which case no obstacle is\r\nto be thrown in his way, because it was in ignorance that he took action\r\nand sued the borrower on the loan. If, however, the owner has been\r\nindemnified by the borrower, in no case can he bring the action of theft\r\nagainst the thief, as his rights of action pass to the person who has\r\ncompensated him for the loss of his property. Conversely it is clear,\r\nthat if, at the outset, the owner began an action on the loan against\r\nthe borrower, not knowing that the property had been stolen, and\r\nsubsequently, on learning this, proceeded against the thief instead,\r\nthe borrower is absolutely released from liability, whatever may be the\r\nresult of the owner's action against the thief; the rule being the same,\r\nwhether the borrower be wholly or only partially insolvent.\r\n\r\n17 As a depositary is not answerable for the safe keeping of the thing\r\ndeposited, but only for fraud, and, if it is stolen, is not compellable\r\nto make restitution by action of deposit, he has no interest if it is\r\nlost, and therefore the action of theft is maintainable only by the\r\ndepositor.\r\n\r\n18 Finally, it has been a question whether a child below the age of\r\npuberty, who carries away the property of another, is guilty of theft.\r\nThe answer is that, as theft depends on intention, obligation by theft\r\nis not incurred unless the child is near puberty, and so understands its\r\ndelinquency.\r\n\r\n19 The object of the action on theft, whether it be for double or\r\nquadruple the value of the goods stolen, is merely the recovery of the\r\npenalty; to recover the goods themselves or their value the owner has\r\nan independent remedy by vindication or condiction. The former is\r\nthe proper remedy when it is known who is in possession of the goods,\r\nwhether this be the thief or any one else: the latter lies against the\r\nthief or his heir, whether in possession of the stolen property or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE II. OF ROBBERY\r\n\r\nRobbery is chargeable also as theft; for who deals with the property\r\nof another more against that other's will than the robber? And thus the\r\ndescription of the robber as an audacious thief is a good one. However,\r\nas a special remedy for this offence the praetor has introduced the\r\naction for robbery, or rapine with violence, which may be brought within\r\na year for four times the value, after a year for simple damages, and\r\nwhile lies even when only a single thing of the slightest value has been\r\ntaken with violence. This fourfold value, however, is not all penalty,\r\nnor is there an independent action for the recovery of the property or\r\nits value, as we observed was the case in the action of theft detected\r\nin the commission; but the thing or its value is included in the\r\nfourfold, so that, in point of fact, the penalty is three times the\r\nvalue of the property, and this whether the robber be taken in the act\r\nor not; for it would be absurd to treat a robber more lightly than one\r\nwho carries off property merely secretly.\r\n\r\n1 This action is maintainable only where the robbery is attended with\r\nwrongful intention; consequently, if a man by mistake thought that\r\nproperty was his own, and, in his ignorance of law, forcibly carried it\r\noff in the belief that it was lawful for an owner to take away, even by\r\nforce, a thing belonging to himself from a person in whose possession it\r\nwas, he cannot be held liable to this action; and similarly on principle\r\nhe would not in such a case be suable for theft. Lest, however, robbers,\r\nunder the cloak of such a plea, should discover a method of gratifying\r\na grasping habit with impunity, the law has been amended upon this point\r\nby imperial constitutions, by which it is enacted that it shall not be\r\nlawful for any one to forcibly carry off movable property, inanimate or\r\nanimate, even though he believe it to belong to him; and that whosoever\r\ndisobeys this shall forfeit the property, if, in fact, it be his, and if\r\nit be not, shall restore it, and along with it its value in money.\r\nAnd by the said constitutions it is also declared that this provision\r\nrelates not only to movables (of which alone robbery can be committed),\r\nbut also to forcible entries on land and houses, so as to deter men from\r\nall violent seizing upon property whatsoever under the cloak of such\r\nexcuses.\r\n\r\n2 In order to support this action it is not necessary that the goods\r\nof which robbery has been committed should belong to the plaintiff,\r\nprovided they were taken from among his property. Thus, if a thing be\r\nlet, or lent, or pledged to Titius, or even deposited with him under\r\nsuch circumstances that he has an interest in its not being carried\r\noff--for instance, by his having undertaken the entire responsibility\r\nfor its safe custody;--or if he possesses it in good faith, or has a\r\nusufruct or any other right in it whereby he suffers loss or incurs\r\nliability through its being forcibly taken from him, the action will\r\nbe maintainable by him; not necessarily in order to restore to him the\r\nownership, but only to compensate him for what it is alleged he has lost\r\nby its being taken from his goods or withdrawn from his means. In fact,\r\nit may be said generally that where, supposing property to be taken\r\nsecretly, the action of theft will lie, the action on robbery will lie\r\nat suit of the same person, if it be taken with violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE III. OF THE LEX AQUILIA\r\n\r\nUnlawful damage is actionable under the lex Aquilia, whose first chapter\r\nprovides that if a slave of another man, or a quadruped from his flocks\r\nor herds, be unlawfully killed, the offender shall pay to the owner\r\nwhatever was the highest value thereof within the year next immediately\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\n1 From the fact that this enactment does not speak of quadrupeds simply,\r\nbut only of such quadrupeds as are usually included under the idea of\r\nflocks and herds, it is to be inferred that it has no application to\r\nwild animals or to dogs, but only to such beasts as can properly be said\r\nto graze in herds, namely horses, mules, asses, oxen, sheep, and goats.\r\nIt is settled, too, that swine come under its operation, for they are\r\ncomprehended in 'herds' because they feed in this manner; thus Homer in\r\nhis Odyssey, as quote by Aelius Marcianus in his Institutes, says, You\r\nwill find him sitting among his swine, and they are feeding by the Rock\r\nof Corax, over against the spring Arethusa.'\r\n\r\n2 To kill unlawfully is to kill without any right; thus a man who kills\r\na robber is not liable to this action, if he could in no other way\r\nescape the danger by which he was threatened.\r\n\r\n3 So, too, where one man kills another by misadventure, he is not liable\r\nunder this statute, provided there is no fault or carelessness on his\r\npart; otherwise it is different, for under this statute carelessness is\r\nas punishable as wilful wrongdoing.\r\n\r\n4 Accordingly, if a man, while playing or practising with javelins, runs\r\nyour slave through as he passes by, a distinction is drawn. If it be\r\ndone by a soldier in his exercising ground, that is to say, where such\r\npractice is usually conducted, he is in no way to blame; but if it be\r\ndone by some one else, his carelessness will make him liable; and so\r\nit is with the soldier, if he do it in some place other than that\r\nappropriated to military exercises.\r\n\r\n5 So, too, if a man is trimming a tree, and kills your slave as he\r\npasses by with a bough which he lets fall, he is guilty of negligence,\r\nif it is near a public way, or a private path belonging to a neighbour,\r\nand he does not call out to give people warning; but if he calls out,\r\nand the slave takes no pains to get out of the way, he is not to blame.\r\nNor would such a man be liable, if he was cutting a tree far away from\r\na road, or in the middle of a field, even if he did not call out; for\r\nstrangers had no business to be there.\r\n\r\n6 Again, if a surgeon operates on your slave, and then neglects\r\naltogether to attend to his cure, so that the slave dies in consequence,\r\nhe is liable for his carelessness.\r\n\r\n7 Sometimes, too, unskilfulness is undistinguishable from\r\ncarelessness--as where a surgeon kills your slave by operating upon him\r\nunskilfully, or by giving him wrong medicines;\r\n\r\n8 and similarly, if your slave is run over by a team of mules, which\r\nthe driver has not enough skill to hold, the latter is suable for\r\ncarelessness; and the case is the same if he was simply not strong\r\nenough to hold them, provided they could have been held by a stronger\r\nman. The rule also applies to runaway horses, if the running away is due\r\nto the rider's deficiency either in skill or strength.\r\n\r\n9 The meaning of the words of the statute 'whatever was of the highest\r\nvalue thereof within the year' is that if any one, for instance, kills\r\na slave of yours, who at the moment of his death is lame, or maimed, or\r\nblind of one eye, but within the year was sound and worth a price, the\r\nperson who kills him is answerable not merely for his value at the time\r\nof his death, but for his highest value within the year. It is owing to\r\nthis that the action under this statute is deemed to be penal, because\r\na defendant is sometimes bound to pay a sum not merely equivalent to the\r\ndamage he has done, but far in excess of it; and consequently, the right\r\nof suing under the statute does not pass against the heir, though it\r\nwould have done so if the damages awarded had never exceeded the actual\r\nloss sustained by the plaintiff.\r\n\r\n10 By juristic construction of the statute, though not so enacted in its\r\nterms, it has been settled that one must not only take account, in the\r\nway we have described, of the value of the body of the slave or animal\r\nkilled, but must also consider all other loss which indirectly falls\r\nupon the plaintiff through the killing. For instance, if your slave\r\nhas been instituted somebody's heir, and, before he has by your order\r\naccepted, he is slain, the value of the inheritance you have missed must\r\nbe taken into consideration; and so, too, if one of a pair of mules,\r\nor one of four chariot horses, or one of a company of slave players is\r\nkilled, account is to be taken not only of what is killed, but also of\r\nthe extent to which the others have been depreciated.\r\n\r\n11 The owner whose slave is killed has the option of suing the wrongdoer\r\nfor damages in a private action under the lex Aquilia, or of accusing\r\nhim on a capital charge by indictment.\r\n\r\n12 The second chapter of the lex Aquilia is now obsolete;\r\n\r\n13 the third makes provision for all damage which is not covered by the\r\nfirst. Accordingly, if a slave or some quadruped which comes within\r\nits terms, is wounded, or if a quadruped which does not come within its\r\nterms, such as a dog or wild animal, is wounded or killed, an action is\r\nprovided by this chapter; and if any other animal or inanimate thing\r\nis unlawfully damaged, a remedy is herein afforded; for all burning,\r\nbreaking, and crushing is hereby made actionable, though, indeed, the\r\nsingle word 'breaking' covers all these offences, denoting as it does\r\nevery kind of injury, so that not only crushing and burning, but any\r\ncutting, bruising, spilling, destroying, or deteriorating is hereby\r\ndenominated. Finally, it has been decided that if one man mixes\r\nsomething with another's win or oil, so as to spoil its natural\r\ngoodness, he is liable under this chapter of the statute.\r\n\r\n14 It is obvious that, as a man is liable under the first chapter\r\nonly where a slave or quadruped is killed by express design or through\r\nnegligence on his part, so, too, he is answerable for all other damage\r\nunder this chapter only where it results from some wilful act or\r\ncarelessness of his. Under this chapter, however, it is not the highest\r\nvalue which the thing had within a year, but that which it had within\r\nthe last thirty days, which is chargeable on the author of the mischief.\r\n\r\n15 It is true that here the statute does not expressly say 'the highest\r\nvalue,' but Sabinus rightly held that the damages must be assessed as\r\nif the words 'highest value' occurred also in this chapter; the Roman\r\npeople, who enacted this statute on the proposal of Aquilius the\r\ntribune, having thought it sufficient to use them in the first chapter\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n16 It is held that a direct action lies under this statute only when the\r\nbody of the offender is substantially the instrument of mischief. If a\r\nman occasions loss to another in any other way, a modified action will\r\nusually lie against him; for instance, if he shuts up another man's\r\nslave or quadruped, so as to starve him or it to death, or drives his\r\nhorse so hard as to knock him to pieces, or drives his cattle over a\r\nprecipice, or persuades his slave to climb a tree or go down a well,\r\nwho, in climbing the one or going down the other, is killed or injured\r\nin any part of his body, a modified action is in all these cases given\r\nagainst him. But if a slave is pushed off a bridge or bank into a\r\nriver, and there drowned, it is clear from the facts that the damage\r\nis substantially done by the body of the offender, who is consequently\r\nliable directly under the lex Aquilia. If damage be done, not by the\r\nbody or to a body, but in some other form, neither the direct nor the\r\nmodified Aquilian action will lie, though it is held that the wrongdoer\r\nis liable to an action on the case; as, for instance, where a man is\r\nmoved by pity to loose another's slave from his fetters, and so enables\r\nhim to escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE IV. OF INJURIES\r\n\r\nBy injury, in a general sense, is meant anything which is done without\r\nany right. Besides this, it has three special significations;\r\nfor sometimes it is used to express outrage, the proper word for\r\nwhich--contumely--is derived from the verb 'to contemn,' and so is\r\nequivalent to the Greek 'ubris': sometimes it means culpable negligence,\r\nas where damage is said to be done (as in the lex Aquilia) 'with\r\ninjury,' where it is equivalent to the Greek 'adikema'; and sometimes\r\niniquity and injustice, which the Greeks express by 'adikia'; thus a\r\nlitigant is said to have received an 'injury' when the praetor or judge\r\ndelivers an unjust judgement against him.\r\n\r\n1 An injury or outrage is inflicted not only by striking with the\r\nfirst, a stick, or a whip, but also by vituperation for the purpose of\r\ncollecting a crowd, or by taking possession of a man's effects on\r\nthe ground that he was in one's debt; or by writing, composing, or\r\npublishing defamatory prose or verse, or contriving the doing of any of\r\nthese things by some one else; or by constantly following a matron, or\r\na young boy or girl below the age of puberty, or attempting anybody's\r\nchastity; and, in a word, by innumerable other acts.\r\n\r\n2 An outrage or injury may be suffered either in one's own person, or\r\nin the person of a child in one's power, or even, as now is generally\r\nallowed, in that of one's wife. Accordingly, if you commit an 'outrage'\r\non a woman who is married to Titius, you can be sued not only in her own\r\nname, but also in those of her father, if she be in his power, and of\r\nher husband. But if, conversely, it be the husband who is outraged, the\r\nwife cannot sue; for wives should be protected by their husbands, not\r\nhusbands by their wives. Finally, a father-in-law may sue on an outrage\r\ncommitted on his daughterinlaw, if the son to whom she is married is in\r\nhis power.\r\n\r\n3 Slaves cannot be outraged themselves, but their master may be outraged\r\nin their person, though not by all the acts by which an outrage might be\r\noffered to him in the person of a child or wife, but only by aggravated\r\nassaults or such insulting acts as clearly tend to dishonour the master\r\nhimself: for instance, by flogging the slave, for which an action lies;\r\nbut for mere verbal abuse of a slave, or for striking him with the fist,\r\nthe master cannot sue.\r\n\r\n4 If an outrage is committed on a slave owned by two or more persons\r\njointly, the damages to be paid to these severally should be assessed\r\nwith reference not to the shares in which they own him, but to their\r\nrank or position, as it is to the reputation and not to the property\r\nthat the injury is done;\r\n\r\n5 and if an outrage is committed on a slave belonging to Maevius, but\r\nin whom Titius has a usufruct, the injury is deemed to be done to the\r\nformer rather than to the latter.\r\n\r\n6 But if the person outraged is a free man who believes himself to be\r\nyour slave, you have no action unless the object of the outrage was\r\nto bring you into contempt, though he can sue in his own name. The\r\nprinciple is the same when another man's slave believes himself to\r\nbelong to you; you can sue on an outrage committed on him only when its\r\nobject is to bring contempt upon you.\r\n\r\n7 The penalty prescribed for outrage in the Twelve Tables was, for a\r\nlimb disabled, retaliation, for a bone merely broken a pecuniary mulct\r\nproportionate to the great poverty of the age. The praetors, however,\r\nsubsequently allowed the person outraged to put his own estimate on the\r\nwrong, the judge having a discretion to condemn the defendant either in\r\nthe sum so named by the plaintiff, or in a less amount; and of these\r\ntwo kinds of penalties that fixed by the Twelve Tables is now obsolete,\r\nwhile that introduced by the praetors, which is also called 'honorary,'\r\nis most usual in the actual practice of the courts. Thus the pecuniary\r\ncompensation awarded for an outrage rises and falls in amount according\r\nto the rank and character of the plaintiff, and this principle is\r\nnot improperly followed even where it is a slave who is outraged; the\r\npenalty where the slave is a steward being different from what it is\r\nwhen he is an ordinary menial, and different again when he is condemned\r\nto wear fetters.\r\n\r\n8 The lex Cornelia also contains provisions as to outrages, and\r\nintroduced an action on outrage, available to a plaintiff who alleges\r\nthat he has been struck or beaten, or that a forcible entry has been\r\nmade upon his house; the term 'his house' including not only one which\r\nbelongs to him and in which he lives but also one which is hired by him,\r\nor in which he is received gratuitously as a guest.\r\n\r\n9 An outrage becomes 'aggravated' either from the atrocious character of\r\nthe act, as where a man is wounded or beaten with clubs by another; or\r\nfrom the place where it is committed, for instance, in the theatre or\r\nforum, or in full sight of the praetor; or from the rank of the person\r\noutraged,--if it be a magistrate, for instance, or if a senator be\r\noutraged by a person of low condition, or a parent by his child, or a\r\npatron by his freedman; for such an injury done to a senator, a parent,\r\nor a patron has a higher pecuniary compensation awarded for it than one\r\ndone to a mere stranger, or to a person of low condition. Sometimes too\r\nthe position of the wound makes an outrage aggravated, as where a man\r\nis struck in the eye. Whether the person on whom such an outrage is\r\ninflicted is independent or in the power of another is almost entirely\r\nimmaterial, it being considered aggravated in either case.\r\n\r\n10 Finally, it should be observed that a person who has been outraged\r\nalways has his option between the civil remedy and a criminal\r\nindictment. If he prefers the former, the penalty which is imposed\r\ndepends, as we have said, on the plaintiff's own estimate of the wrong\r\nhe has suffered; if the latter, it is the judge's duty to inflict an\r\nextraordinary penalty on the offender. It should be remembered, however,\r\nthat by a constitution of Zeno persons of illustrious or still higher\r\nrank may bring or defend such criminal actions on outrage by an agent,\r\nprovided they comply with the requirements of the constitution, as may\r\nbe more clearly ascertained by a perusal of the same.\r\n\r\n11 Liability to an action on outrages attaches not only to him who\r\ncommits the act,--the striking of a blow, for instance--but also\r\nto those who maliciously counsel or abet in the commission, as, for\r\ninstance, to a man who gets another struck in the face.\r\n\r\n12 The right of action on outrage is lost by condonation; thus, if a man\r\nbe outraged, and takes no steps to obtain redress, but at once lets\r\nthe matter, as it is said, slip out of his mind, he cannot subsequently\r\nalter his intentions, and resuscitate an affront which he has once\r\nallowed to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE V. OF QUASI-DELICTAL OBLIGATIONS\r\n\r\nThe obligation incurred by a judge who delivers an unjust or partial\r\ndecision cannot properly be called delictal, and yet it does not arise\r\nfrom contract; consequently, as he cannot but be held to have done a\r\nwrong, even though it may be due to ignorance, his liability would seem\r\nto be quasidelictal, and a pecuniary penalty will be imposed on him at\r\nthe judge's discretion.\r\n\r\n1 Another case of quasidelictal obligation is that of a person from\r\nwhose residence, whether it be his own, or rented, or gratuitously lent\r\nhim, anything is thrown or poured out whereby another is injured; the\r\nreason why his liability cannot properly be called delictal being that\r\nit is usually incurred through the fault of some other person, such as\r\na slave or freedman. Of a similar character is the obligation of one who\r\nkeeps something placed or hung over a public way, which might fall and\r\ninjure any one. In this last case the penalty has been fixed at ten\r\naurei; in that of things thrown or poured out of a dwelling-house the\r\naction is for damages equivalent to double the loss sustained, though\r\nif a free man be thereby killed the penalty is fixed at fifty aurei, and\r\neven if he be merely injured he can sue for such damages as the judge\r\nshall in his discretion award; and here the latter should take into\r\naccount the medical and other expenses of the plaintiff's illness, as\r\nwell as the loss which he has sustained through being disabled from\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n2 If a son in power lives apart from his father, and anything is thrown\r\nor poured out of his place of residence, or if he has anything so placed\r\nor hung as to be dangerous to the public, it is the opinion of Julian\r\nthat no action lies against the father, but that the son should be made\r\nsole defendant; and the same principle should be applied to a son in\r\npower who is made a judge, and delivers an unjust or partial decision.\r\n\r\n3 Similarly shipowners, inn and stable keepers are liable as on a\r\nquasi-delict for wilful damage or theft committed in their ships, inns,\r\nor stables, provided the act be done by some or one of their servants\r\nthere employed, and not by themselves; for the action which is given in\r\nsuch cases is not based on contract, and yet as they are in some sense\r\nat fault for employing careless or dishonest servants, their liability\r\nwould seem to be quasidelictal. In such circumstances the action which\r\nis given is on the case, and lies at suit of the injured person's heir,\r\nthough not against the heir of the shipowner, inn or stable keeper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE VI. OF ACTIONS\r\n\r\nThe subject of actions still remains for discussion. An action is\r\nnothing else than the right of suing before a judge for what is due to\r\none.\r\n\r\n1 The leading division of all actions whatsoever, whether tried before\r\na judge or a referee, is into two kinds, real and personal; that is to\r\nsay, the defendant is either under a contractual or delictal obligation\r\nto the plaintiff, in which case the action is personal, and the\r\nplaintiff's contention is that the defendant ought to convey something\r\nto, or do something for him, or of a similar nature; or else, though\r\nthere is no legal obligation between the parties, the plaintiff asserts\r\na ground of action against some one else relating to some thing, in\r\nwhich case the action is real. Thus, a man may be in possession of some\r\ncorporeal thing, in which Titius claims a right of property, and which\r\nthe possessor affirms belongs to him; here, if Titius sues for its\r\nrecovery, the action is real.\r\n\r\n2 It is real also if a man asserts that he has a right of usufruct over\r\na landed estate or a house, or a right of going or driving cattle over\r\nhis neighbour's land, or of drawing water from the same; and so too are\r\nthe actions relating to urban servitudes, as, for instance, where a man\r\nasserts a right to raise his house, to have an uninterrupted prospect,\r\nto project some building over his neighbour's land, or to rest the beams\r\nof his own house on his neighbour's wall. Conversely, there are actions\r\nrelating to usufructs, and to rustic and urban servitudes, of a contrary\r\nimport, which lie at the suit of plaintiffs who deny their opponent's\r\nright of usufruct, of going or driving cattle, of drawing water, of\r\nraising their house, or having an uninterrupted view, of projecting some\r\nbuilding over the plaintiff's land, or of resting the beams of their\r\nhouse in the plaintiff's wall. These actions too are real, but negative,\r\nand never occur in disputes as to corporeal things, in which the\r\nplaintiff is always the party out of possession; and there is no\r\naction by which the possessor can (as plaintiff) deny that the thing in\r\nquestion belongs to his adversary, except in one case only, as to which\r\nall requisite information can be gathered from the fuller books of the\r\nDigest.\r\n\r\n3 The actions which have hitherto been mentioned, and others which\r\nresemble them, are either of statutory origin, or at any rate belong to\r\nthe civil law. There are other actions, however, both real and personal,\r\nwhich the praetor has introduced in virtue of his jurisdiction, and of\r\nwhich it is necessary to give examples. For instance, he will usually,\r\nunder the circumstances to be mentioned, allow a real action to be\r\nbrought with a fictitious allegation--namely, that the plaintiff has\r\nacquired a title by usucapion where this, in fact, is not the case;\r\nor, conversely, he will allow a fictitious plea on the part of the\r\ndefendant, to the effect that the plaintiff has not acquired such a\r\ntitle where, in point of fact, he has.\r\n\r\n4 Thus, if possession of some object be delivered on a ground sufficient\r\nto legally transfer the same--for instance, under a sale or gift, as\r\npart of a dowry, or as a legacy--and the transferee has not yet acquired\r\na complete title by usucapion, he has no direct real action for its\r\nrecovery, if he accidentally loses possession, because by the civil law\r\na real action lies at the suit of the owner only. But as it seemed hard\r\nthat in such a case there should be no remedy, the praetor introduced\r\nan action in which the plaintiff, who has lost possession, fictitiously\r\nallege that he has acquired a full title by usucapion, and thus claims\r\nthe thing as his own. This is called the Publician action, because it\r\nwas first placed in the Edict by a praetor called Publicius.\r\n\r\n5 Conversely, if a person, while absent in the service of the State, or\r\nwhile in the power of an enemy, acquires by usucapion property belonging\r\nto some one resident at home, the latter is allowed, within a year\r\nfrom the cessation of the possessor's public employment, to sue for\r\na recovery of the property by a rescission of the usucapion: by\r\nfictitiously alleging, in other words, that the defendant has not thus\r\nacquired it; and the praetor from motives of equity allows this kind of\r\naction to be brought in certain other cases, as to which information may\r\nbe gathered from the larger work of the Digest or Pandects.\r\n\r\n6 Similarly, if a person conveys away his property in fraud of\r\ncreditors, the latter, on obtaining from the governor of the province a\r\ndecree vesting in them possession of the debtor's estate, are allowed to\r\navoid the conveyance, and sue for the recovery of the property; in other\r\nwords, to allege that the conveyance has never taken place, and that the\r\nproperty consequently still belongs to the debtor.\r\n\r\n7 Again, the Servian and quasi-Servian actions, the latter of which\r\nis also called 'hypothecary,' are derived merely from the praetor's\r\njurisdiction. The Servian action is that by which a landlord sues\r\nfor his tenant's property, over which he has a right in the nature\r\nof mortgage as security for his rent; the quasi-Servian is a similar\r\nremedy, open to every pledgee or hypothecary creditor. So far then as\r\nthis action is concerned, there is no difference between a pledge and a\r\nhypothec: and indeed whenever a debtor and a creditor agree that certain\r\nproperty of the former shall be the latter's security for his debt, the\r\ntransaction is called a pledge or a hypothec indifferently. In other\r\npoints, however, there is a distinction between them; for the term\r\n'pledge' is properly used only where possession of the property in\r\nquestion is delivered to the creditor, especially if that property be\r\nmovable: while a hypothec is, strictly speaking, such a right created by\r\nmere agreement without delivery of possession.\r\n\r\n8 Besides these, there are also personal actions which the praetor has\r\nintroduced in virtue of his jurisdiction, for instance, that brought\r\nto enforce payment of money already owed, and the action on a banker's\r\nacceptance, which closely resembled it. By our constitution, however,\r\nthe first of these actions has been endowed with all the advantages\r\nwhich belonged to the second, and the latter, as superfluous, has\r\ntherefore been deprived of all force and expunged from our legislation.\r\nTo the praetor is due also the action claiming an account of the\r\npeculium of a slave or child in power, that in which the issue is\r\nwhether a plaintiff has made oath, and many others.\r\n\r\n9 The action brought to enforce payment of money already owed is\r\nthe proper remedy against a person who, by a mere promise, without\r\nstipulation, has engaged to discharge a debt due either from himself or\r\nfrom some third party. If he has promised by stipulation, he is liable\r\nby the civil law.\r\n\r\n10 The action claiming an account of a peculium is a remedy introduced\r\nby the praetor against a master or a father. By strict law, such persons\r\nincur no liability on the contracts of their slaves or children in\r\npower; yet it is only equitable that damages should still be recoverable\r\nagainst them to the extent of the peculium, in which children in power\r\nand slaves have a sort of property.\r\n\r\n11 Again, if a plaintiff, on being challenged by the defendant, deposes\r\non oath that the latter owes him the money which is the object of the\r\naction, and payment is not made to him, the praetor most justly grants\r\nto him an action in which the issue is, not whether the money is owing,\r\nbut whether the plaintiff has sworn to the debt.\r\n\r\n12 There is also a considerable number of penal actions which the\r\npraetor has introduced in the exercise of his jurisdiction; for\r\ninstance, against those who in any way injure or deface his album;\r\nor who summon a parent or patron without magisterial sanction; or who\r\nviolently rescue persons summoned before himself, or who compass such a\r\nrescue; and others innumerable.\r\n\r\n13 'Prejudicial' actions would seem to be real, and may be exemplified\r\nby those in which it is inquired whether a man is free born, or has\r\nbecome free by manumission, or in which the question relates to a\r\nchild's paternity. Of these the first alone belongs to the civil law:\r\nthe others are derived from the praetor's jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n14 The kinds of action having been thus distinguished, it is clear that\r\na plaintiff cannot demand his property from another in the form 'if it\r\nbe proved that the defendant is bound to convey.' It cannot be said that\r\nwhat already belongs to the plaintiff ought to be conveyed to him, for\r\nconveyance transfers ownership, and what is his cannot be made more his\r\nthan it is already. Yet for the prevention of theft, and multiplication\r\nof remedies against the thief, it has been provided that, besides the\r\npenalty of twice or four times the value of the property stolen, the\r\nproperty itself, or its value, may be recovered from the thief by a\r\npersonal action in the form 'if it be proved that the defendant ought to\r\nconvey,' as an alternative for the real action which is also available\r\nto the plaintiff, and in which he asserts his ownership of the stolen\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n15 We call a real action a 'vindication,' and a personal action, in\r\nwhich the contention is that some property should be conveyed to us, or\r\nsome service performed for us, a 'condiction,' this term being derived\r\nfrom condicere, which has an old meaning of 'giving notice.' To call\r\na personal action, in which the plaintiff contends that the defendant\r\nought to convey to him, a condiction, is in reality an abuse of the\r\nterm, for nowadays there is no such notice as was given in the old\r\naction of that name.\r\n\r\n16 Actions may be divided into those which are purely reparative, those\r\nwhich are purely penal, and those which are mixed, or partly reparative,\r\npartly penal.\r\n\r\n17 All real actions are purely reparative. Of personal actions those\r\nwhich spring from contract are nearly all of the same character; for\r\ninstance, the actions on loans of money, or stipulations, on loans for\r\nuse, on deposit, agency, partnership, sale, and hire. If, however,\r\nthe action be on a deposit occasioned by a riot, a fire, the fall of a\r\nbuilding, or a shipwreck, the praetor enables the depositor to recover\r\ndouble damages, provided he sues the bailee in person; he cannot recover\r\ndouble damages from the bailee's heir, unless he can prove personal\r\nfraud against the latter. In these two cases the action, though on\r\ncontract, is mixed.\r\n\r\n18 Actions arising from delict are sometimes purely penal, sometimes\r\nare partly penal and partly reparative, and consequently mixed. The sole\r\nobject of the action of theft is the recovery of a penalty, whether\r\nthat penalty be four times the value of the property stolen, as in\r\ntheft detected in the commission, or only twice that value, as in simple\r\ntheft. The property itself is recoverable by an independent action in\r\nwhich the person from whom it has been stolen claims it as his own,\r\nwhether it be in the possession of the thief himself or of some third\r\nperson; and against the thief himself he may even bring a condiction, to\r\nrecover the property or its value.\r\n\r\n19 The action on robbery is mixed, for the damages recoverable\r\nthereunder are four times the value of the property taken, threefourths\r\nbeing pure penalty, and the remaining fourth compensation for the loss\r\nwhich the plaintiff has sustained. So too the action on unlawful damage\r\nunder the lex Aquilia is mixed, not only where the defendant denies his\r\nliability, and so is sued for double damages, but also sometimes where\r\nthe claim is for simple damages only; as where a lame or one-eyed slave\r\nis killed, who within the year previous was sound and of large value; in\r\nwhich case the defendant is condemned to pay his greatest value within\r\nthe year, according to the distinction which has been drawn above.\r\nPersons too who are under an obligation as heirs to pay legacies or\r\ntrust bequests to our holy churches or other venerable places, and\r\nneglect to do so until sued by the legatee, are liable to a mixed\r\naction, by which they are compelled to give the thing or pay the money\r\nleft by the deceased, and, in addition, an equivalent thing or sum as\r\npenalty, the condemnation being thus in twice the value of the original\r\nclaim.\r\n\r\n20 Some actions are mixed in a different sense, being partly real,\r\npartly personal. They are exemplified by the action for the division of\r\na 'family,' by which one of two or more joint heirs can enforce against\r\nthe other or rest a partition of the inheritance, and by the actions\r\nfor the division of common property, and for rectification of boundaries\r\nbetween adjoining landed proprietors. In these three actions the judge\r\nhas power, according as shall to him seem fair and equitable, to adjudge\r\nany part of the joint property, or of the land in dispute, to any one\r\nof the parties, and to order any one of them who seems to have an undue\r\nadvantage in the partition or rectification to pay a certain sum of\r\nmoney to the other or the rest as compensation.\r\n\r\n21 The damages recoverable in an action may be either once, twice,\r\nthree, or four times the value of the plaintiff's original interest;\r\nthere is no action by which more than fourfold damages can be claimed.\r\n\r\n22 Single damages only are recoverable in the actions on stipulation,\r\nloan for consumption, sale, hire, agency, and many others besides.\r\n\r\n23 Actions claiming double damages are exemplified by those on simple\r\ntheft, on unlawful damage under the lex Aquilia, on certain kinds of\r\ndeposit, and for corruption of a slave, which lies against any one by\r\nwhose instigation and advice another man's slave runs away, or becomes\r\ndisobedient to his master, or takes to dissolute habits, or becomes\r\nworse in any way whatsoever, and in which the value of property which\r\nthe runaway slave has carried off is taken into account. Finally, as we\r\nremarked above, the action for the recovery of legacies left to places\r\nof religion is of this character.\r\n\r\n24 An action for triple damages is grounded when a plaintiff makes an\r\noverstatement of his claim in the writ of summons, in consequence of\r\nwhich the officers of the court take too large a fee from the defendant.\r\nIn such a case the latter will be able to recover from the plaintiff\r\nthree times the loss which he sustains by the overcharge, including\r\nin these damages simple compensation for the sum paid in excess of the\r\nproper fee. This is provided by a distinguished constitution in our\r\nCode, under which a statutory condiction clearly lies for the damages in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n25 Quadruple damages are recoverable by the action on theft detected\r\nin the commission, by the action on intimidation, and by the action\r\ngrounded on the giving of money in order to induce one man to bring a\r\nvexatious suit against another, or to desist from a suit when brought.\r\nUnder our constitution too a statutory condiction lies for the recovery\r\nof fourfold damages from officers of the court, who exact money from\r\ndefendants in excess of its provisions.\r\n\r\n26 There is this difference between the actions on simple theft and for\r\nthe corruption of a slave, and the other of which we spoke in connexion\r\nwith them, that by the two former double damages are recoverable under\r\nany circumstances; the latter, namely the action on unlawful damage\r\nunder the lex Aquilia, and that on certain kinds of deposit, entail\r\ndouble damages on the defendant only if he denies his liability; if he\r\nadmits it, simple damages alone can be recovered. The damages are double\r\nunder an action for recovery of legacies left to religious places not\r\nonly when the liability is denied, but also when the defendant delays\r\npayment until sued by the order of a magistrate; if he admits his\r\nliability, and pays before being so sued, he cannot be compelled to pay\r\nmore than the original debt.\r\n\r\n27 The action on intimidation also differs from the others which we\r\nmentioned in the same connexion, in that it contains in its very nature\r\nan implied condition that the defendant is entitled to acquittal if, on\r\nbeing so ordered by the judge, he restores to the plaintiff the property\r\nof which the latter has been deprived. In other actions of the same\r\nclass this is not so; for instance, in the action on theft detected\r\nin the commission, the defendant has under any circumstances to pay\r\nfourfold damages.\r\n\r\n28 Again, some actions are equitable, others are actions of strict\r\nlaw. To the former class belong the actions on sale, hire, unauthorised\r\nagency, agency proper, deposit, partnership, guardianship, loan for use,\r\nmortgage, division of a 'family,' partition of joint property, those\r\non the innominate contracts of sale by commission and exchange, and the\r\nsuit for recovery of an inheritance. Until quite recently it was a moot\r\npoint whether the lastnamed was properly an equitable action, but our\r\nconstitution has definitely decided the question in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n29 Formerly too the action for the recovery of a dowry was an equitable\r\naction: but as we found that the action on stipulation was more\r\nconvenient, we have, while establishing many distinctions, attached\r\nall the advantages which the former remedy possessed to the action\r\non stipulation, when employed for the recovery of a dowry. The former\r\naction being thus by a judicious reform abolished, that on stipulation,\r\nby which it has been replaced, has deservedly been invested with all\r\nthe characteristics of an equitable action, so far as and whenever it is\r\nbrought for the recovery of a dowry. We have also given persons entitled\r\nto sue for such recovery a tacit hypothec over the husband's property,\r\nbut this right is not to give any priority over other hypothecary\r\ncreditors except where it is the wife herself who sues to recover\r\nher dowry; it being in her interest only that we have made this new\r\nprovision.\r\n\r\n30 In equitable actions the judge has full power to assess on good and\r\nfair grounds the amount due to the plaintiff, and in so doing to take\r\ninto account counterclaims of the defendant, condemning the latter only\r\nin the balance. Even in actions of strict law counterclaims have been\r\npermitted since a rescript of the Emperor Marcus, the defendant meeting\r\nthe plaintiff's claim by a plea of fraud. By our constitution, however,\r\na wider field has been given to the principle of setoff, when the\r\ncounterclaim is clearly established, the amount claimed in the\r\nplaintiff's action, whether real or personal, or whatever its nature,\r\nbeing reduced by operation of law to the extent of the defendant's\r\ncounterclaim. The only exception to this rule is the action on deposit,\r\nagainst which we have deemed it no less than dishonest to allow any\r\ncounterclaim to be set up; for if this were permitted persons might\r\nbe fraudulently prevented from recovering property deposited under the\r\npretence of a setoff.\r\n\r\n31 There are some actions again which we call arbitrary, because their\r\nissue depends on an 'arbitrium' or order of the judge. Here, unless on\r\nsuch order the defendant satisfies the plaintiff's claim by restoring or\r\nproducing the property, or by performing his obligation, or in a noxal\r\naction by surrendering the guilty slave, he ought to be condemned. Some\r\nof such actions are real, others personal. The former are exemplified\r\nby the Publician action, the Servian action for the recovery of a tenant\r\nfarmer's stock, and the quasi-Servian or socalled hypothecary action;\r\nthe latter by the actions on intimidation and on fraud, by that for the\r\nrecovery of a thing promised at a particular place, and by the action\r\nclaiming production of property. In all these actions, and others of a\r\nsimilar nature, the judge has full power to determine on good and just\r\ngrounds, according to the circumstances of each particular case, the\r\nform in which reparation ought to be made to the plaintiff.\r\n\r\n32 It is the judge's duty, in delivering judgement, to make his award as\r\ndefinite as possible, whether it relate to the payment of money or\r\nthe delivery of property, and this even when the plaintiff's claim is\r\naltogether unliquidated.\r\n\r\n33 Formerly, if the plaintiff, in his statement of claim, demanded more\r\nthan he was entitled to, his case fell to the ground, that is, he lost\r\neven that which was his due, and in such cases the praetor usually\r\ndeclined to restore him to his previous position, unless he was a minor;\r\nfor in this matter too the general rule was observed of giving relief to\r\nminors after inquiry made, if it were proved that they had made an error\r\nowing to their lack of years. If, however, the mistake was entirely\r\njustifiable, and such as to have possibly misled even the discreetest of\r\nmen, relief was afforded even to persons of full age, as in the case of\r\na man who sues for the whole of a legacy, of which part is found to\r\nhave been taken away by codicils subsequently discovered; or where such\r\nsubsequently discovered codicils give legacies to other persons, so\r\nthat, the total amount given in legacies being reduced under the lex\r\nFalcidia, the first legatee is found to have claimed more than the\r\nthreefourths allowed by that statute. Overstatement of claim takes four\r\nforms; that is, it may relate either to the object, the time, the place,\r\nor the specification. A plaintiff makes an overclaim in the object when,\r\nfor instance, he sues for twenty aurei while only ten are owing to him,\r\nor when, being only part owner of property, he sues to recover the whole\r\nor a greater portion of it than he is entitled to. Overclaim in respect\r\nof time occurs when a man sues for money before the day fixed for\r\npayment, or before the fulfilment of a condition on which payment was\r\ndependent; for exactly as one who pays money only after it falls due\r\nis held to pay less than his just debt, so one who makes his demand\r\nprematurely is held to make an overclaim. Overclaim in respect of place\r\nis exemplified by a man suing at one place for performance of a promise\r\nwhich it was expressly agreed was to be performed at another, without\r\nany reference, in his claim, to the latter: as, for instance, if a man,\r\nafter stipulating thus, 'Do you promise to pay at Ephesus?' were to\r\nclaim the money as due at Rome, without any addition as to Ephesus.\r\nThis is an overclaim, because by alleging that the money is due at Rome\r\nsimply, the plaintiff deprives his debtor of the advantage he might have\r\nderived from paying at Ephesus. On this account an arbitrary action is\r\ngiven to a plaintiff who sues at a place other than that agreed upon\r\nfor payment, in which the advantage which the debtor might have had in\r\npaying at the latter is taken into consideration, and which usually is\r\ngreatest in connexion with commodities which vary in price from district\r\nto district, such as wine, oil, or grain; indeed even the interest\r\non loans of money is different in different places. If, however, a\r\nplaintiff sues at Ephesus--that is, in our example, at the place agreed\r\nupon for the payment--he need do no more than simply allege the debt,\r\nas the praetor too points out, because the debtor has all the advantage\r\nwhich payment in that particular place gives him. Overclaim in respect\r\nof specification closely resembles overclaim in respect of place, and\r\nmay be exemplified by a man's stipulating from you 'do you promise\r\nto convey Stichus or ten aurei?' and then suing for the one or the\r\nother--that is to say, either for the slave only, or for the money only.\r\nThe reason why this is an overclaim is that in stipulations of this sort\r\nit is the promisor who has the election, and who may give the slave\r\nor the money, whichever he prefers; consequently if the promisee sues,\r\nalleging that either the money alone, or the slave alone, ought to be\r\nconveyed to him, he deprives his adversary of his election, and thereby\r\nputs him in a worse position, while he himself acquires an undue\r\nadvantage. Other cases of this form of overclaim occur where a man,\r\nhaving stipulated in general terms for a slave, for wine, or for purple,\r\nsues for the particular slave Stichus, or for the particular wine\r\nof Campania, or for Tyrian purple; for in all of these instances he\r\ndeprives his adversary of his election, who was entitled, under the\r\nterms of the stipulation, to discharge his obligation in a mode other\r\nthan that which is required of him. And even though the specific thing\r\nfor which the promisee sues be of little or no value, it is still an\r\noverclaim: for it is often easier for a debtor to pay what is of greater\r\nvalue than what is actually demanded of him. Such were the rules of the\r\nolder law, which, however, has been made more liberal by our own and\r\nZeno's statutes. Where the overclaim relates to time, the constitution\r\nof Zeno prescribes the proper procedure; if it relates to quantity, or\r\nassumes any other form, the plaintiff, as we have remarked above, is\r\nto be condemned in a sum equivalent to three times any loss which the\r\ndefendant may have sustained thereby.\r\n\r\n34 If the plaintiff in his statement of claim demands less than is his\r\ndue, as for instance by alleging a debt of five aurei, when in fact he\r\nis owed ten, or by claiming only half of an estate the whole of which\r\nreally belongs to him, he runs no risk thereby, for, by the constitution\r\nof Zeno of sacred memory, the judge will in the same action condemn the\r\ndefendant in the residue as well as in the amount actually claimed.\r\n\r\n35 If he demands the wrong thing in his statement of claim, the rule is\r\nthat he runs no risk; for if he discovers his mistake, we allow him\r\nto set it right in the same action. For instance, a plaintiff who is\r\nentitled to the slave Stichus may claim Eros; or he may allege that he\r\nis entitled to a conveyance under a will, when his right is founded in\r\nreality upon a stipulation.\r\n\r\n36 There are again some actions in which we do not always recover the\r\nwhole of what is due to us, but in which we sometimes get the whole,\r\nsometimes only part. For instance, if the fund to which our claim looks\r\nfor satisfaction be the peculium of a son in power or a slave, and it\r\nis sufficient in amount to meet that claim, the father or master is\r\ncondemned to pay the whole debt; but if it is not sufficient, the\r\njudge condemns him to pay only so far as it will go. Of the mode of\r\nascertaining the amount of a peculium we will speak in its proper place.\r\n\r\n37 So too if a woman sues for the recovery of her dowry, the rule is\r\nthat the husband is to be condemned to restore it only so far as he is\r\nable, that is, so far as his means permit. Accordingly, if his means\r\nwill enable him to restore the dowry in full, he will be condemned to do\r\nso; if not, he will be condemned to pay only so much as he is able. The\r\namount of the wife's claim is also usually lessened by the husband's\r\nright of retaining some portion for himself, which he may do to the\r\nextent of any outlay he has made on dowry property, according to\r\nthe rule, stated in the larger work of the Digest, that a dowry is\r\ndiminished by operation of law to the extent of all necessary outlay\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\n38 Again, if a man goes to law with his parent or patron, or if one\r\npartner brings an action of partnership against another, he cannot get\r\njudgement for more than his adversary is able to pay. The rule is the\r\nsame when a man is sued on a mere promise to give a present.\r\n\r\n39 Very often too a plaintiff obtains judgement for less than he was\r\nowed through the defendant's pleading a setoff: for, as has already been\r\nobserved, the judge, acting on equitable principles, would in such a\r\ncase take into account the cross demand in the same transaction of the\r\ndefendant, and condemn him only in the residue.\r\n\r\n40 So too if an insolvent person, who surrenders all his effects to his\r\ncreditors, acquires fresh property of sufficient amount to justify such\r\na step, his creditors may sue him afresh, and compel him to satisfy the\r\nresidue of their claims so far as he is able, but not to give up all\r\nthat he has; for it would be inhuman to condemn a man to pay his debts\r\nin full who has already been once deprived of all his means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE VII. OF CONTRACTS MADE WITH PERSONS IN POWER\r\n\r\nAs we have already mentioned the action in respect of the peculium of\r\nchildren in power and slaves, we must now explain it more fully, and\r\nwith it the other actions by which fathers and masters are sued for the\r\ndebts of their sons or slaves. Whether the contract be made with a slave\r\nor with a child in power, the rules to be applied are much the same; and\r\ntherefore, to make our statements as short as possible, we will speak\r\nonly of slaves and masters, premising that what we say of them is true\r\nalso of children and the parents in whose power they are; where the\r\ntreatment of the latter differs from that of the former, we will point\r\nout the divergence.\r\n\r\n1 If a slave enters into a contract at the bidding of his master, the\r\npraetor allows the latter to be sued for the whole amount: for it is on\r\nhis credit that the other party relies in making the contract.\r\n\r\n2 On the same principle the praetor grants two other actions, in which\r\nthe whole amount due may be sued for; that called exercitoria, to\r\nrecover the debt of a shipmaster, and that called institoria, to recover\r\nthe debt of a manager or factor. The former lies against a master\r\nwho has appointed a slave to be captain of a ship, to recover a debt\r\nincurred by the slave in his character of captain, and it is called\r\nexercitoria, because the person to whom the daily profits of a ship\r\nbelong is termed an exercitor. The latter lies against a man who has\r\nappointed a slave to manage a shop or business, to recover any debt\r\nincurred in that business; it is called institoria, because a person\r\nappointed to manage a business is termed an institor. And these actions\r\nare granted by the praetor even if the person whom one sets over a ship,\r\na shop, or any other business, be a free man or another man's slave,\r\nbecause equity requires their application in these latter cases no less\r\nthan in the former.\r\n\r\n3 Another action of the praetor's introduction is that called\r\ntributoria. If a slave, with the knowledge of his master, devotes his\r\npeculium to a trade or business, the rule which the praetor follows, in\r\nrespect of contracts made in the course of such trade or business, is\r\nthat the peculium so invested and its profits shall be divided between\r\nthe master, if anything is due to him, and the other creditors in the\r\nratio of their claims. The distribution of these assets is left to the\r\nmaster, subject to this provision, that any creditor who complains of\r\nhaving received less than his proper share can bring this action against\r\nhim for an account.\r\n\r\n4 There is also an action in respect of peculium and of what has been\r\nconverted to the uses of the master, under which, if a debt has been\r\ncontracted by a slave without the consent of his master, and some\r\nportion thereof has been converted to his uses, he is liable to that\r\nextent, while if no portion has been so converted, he is liable to the\r\nextent of the slave's peculium. Conversion to his uses is any necessary\r\nexpenditure on his account, as repayment to his creditors of money\r\nborrowed, repair of his falling house, purchase of corn for his slaves,\r\nor of an estate for him, or any other necessary. Thus, if out of ten\r\naurei which your slave borrows from Titius, he pays your creditor five,\r\nand spends the remainder in some other way, you are liable for the whole\r\nof the five, and for the remainder to the extent of the peculium: and\r\nfrom this it is clear that if the whole ten were applied to your uses\r\nTitius could recover the whole from you. Thus, though it is but a single\r\naction which is brought in respect of peculium and of conversion to\r\nuses, it has two condemnatory clauses. The judge by whom the action is\r\ntried first looks to see whether there has been any application to the\r\nuses of the master, and does not proceed to ascertain the amount of\r\nthe peculium unless there has been no such application, or a partial\r\napplication only. In ascertaining the amount of the peculium deduction\r\nis first made of what is owed to the master or any person in his power,\r\nand the residue only is treated as peculium; though sometimes what\r\na slave owes to a person in his master's power is not deducted, for\r\ninstance, where that person is another slave who himself belongs to the\r\npeculium; thus, where a slave owes a debt to his own vicarial slave, its\r\namount is not deducted from the peculium.\r\n\r\n5 There is no doubt that a person with whom a slave enters into a\r\ncontract at the bidding of his master, or who can sue by the actions\r\nexercitoria or institoria, may in lieu thereof bring an action in\r\nrespect of the peculium and of conversion to uses; but it would be most\r\nfoolish of him to relinquish an action by which he may with the greatest\r\nease recover the whole of what is owing to him under the contract, and\r\nundertake the trouble of proving a conversion to uses, or the existence\r\nof a peculium sufficient in amount to cover the whole of the debt. So\r\ntoo a plaintiff who can sue by the action called tributoria may sue in\r\nrespect of peculium and conversion to uses, and sometimes the one\r\naction is the more advisable, sometimes the other. The former has this\r\nadvantage, that in it the master has no priority; there is no deduction\r\nof debts owing to him, but he and the other creditors stand on precisely\r\nthe same footing; while in the action in respect of peculium deduction\r\nis first made of debts owing to the master, who is condemned to pay\r\nover to the creditors only what then remains. On the other hand, the\r\nadvantage of the action in respect of peculium is that in it the slave's\r\nwhole peculium is liable to his creditors, whereas in the action called\r\ntributoria only so much of it is liable as is invested in the trade\r\nor business; and this may be only a third, a fourth, or even a less\r\nfraction, because the slave may have the rest invested in land or\r\nslaves, or out on loan. A creditor ought therefore to select the one\r\nor the other action by considering their respective advantages in each\r\nparticular case; though he certainly ought to choose that in respect of\r\nconversion to uses, if he can prove such conversion.\r\n\r\n6 What we have said of the liability of a master on the contracts of\r\nhis slave is equally applicable where the contract is made by a child or\r\ngrandchild in the power of his or her father or grandfather.\r\n\r\n7 A special enactment in favour of children in power is found in the\r\nsenatusconsult of Macedo, which has prohibited the giving of loans of\r\nmoney to such persons, and refused an action to the lender both against\r\nthe child, whether he be still in power, or has become independent by\r\ndeath of the ancestor or emancipation, and against the parent, whether\r\nhe still retains the child in his power, or has emancipated him. This\r\nenactment was made by the Senate because it was found that persons\r\nin power, when dragged down by the burden of loans which they had\r\nsquandered in profligacy, often plotted against the lives of their\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n8 Finally, it should be observed that where a contract has been entered\r\ninto by a slave or son in power at his master's or parent's bidding,\r\nor where there has been a conversion to his uses, a condiction may be\r\nbrought directly against the parent or master, exactly as if he had\r\nbeen the original contracting party in person. So too, wherever a man\r\nis suable by either of the actions called exercitoria and institoria,\r\nhe may, in lieu thereof, be sued directly by a condiction, because in\r\neffect the contract in such cases is made at his bidding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE VIII. OF NOXAL ACTIONS\r\n\r\nWhere a delict, such as theft, robbery, unlawful damages, or outrage,\r\nis committed by a slave, a noxal action lies against the master, who\r\non being condemned has the option of paying the damages awarded, or\r\nsurrendering the slave in satisfaction of the injury.\r\n\r\n1 The wrongdoer, that is, the slave, is called 'noxa'; 'noxia' is the\r\nterm applied to the wrong itself, that is, the theft, damage, robbery,\r\nor outrage.\r\n\r\n2 This principle of noxal surrender in lieu of paying damages awarded is\r\nbased on most excellent reason, for it would be unjust that the misdeed\r\nof a slave should involve his master in any detriment beyond the loss of\r\nhis body.\r\n\r\n3 If a master is sued by a noxal action on the ground of his slave's\r\ndelict, he is released from all liability by surrendering the slave in\r\nsatisfaction of the wrong, and by this surrender his right of ownership\r\nis permanently transferred; though if the slave can procure enough money\r\nto compensate the surrenderee in full for the wrong he did him, he can,\r\nby applying to the praetor, get himself manumitted even against the will\r\nof his new master.\r\n\r\n4 Noxal actions were introduced partly by statute, partly by the Edict\r\nof the praetor; for theft, by the statute of the Twelve Tables; for\r\nunlawful damages, by the lex Aquilia; for outrage and robbery, by the\r\nEdict.\r\n\r\n5 Noxal actions always follow the person of the wrongdoer. Thus, if your\r\nslave does a wrong while in your power, an action lies against you; if\r\nhe becomes the property of some other person, that other is the proper\r\nperson to be sued; and if he is manumitted, he becomes directly and\r\npersonally liable, and the noxal action is extinguished. Conversely, a\r\ndirect action may change into noxal; thus, in an independent person has\r\ndone a wrong, and then becomes your slave (as he may in several ways\r\ndescribed in the first Book), a noxal action lies against you in lieu of\r\nthe direct action which previously lay against the wrongdoer in person.\r\n\r\n6 But no action lies for an offence committed by a slave against his\r\nmaster, for between a master and a slave in his power there can be no\r\nobligation; consequently, if the slave becomes the property of some\r\nother person, or is manumitted, neither he nor his new master can be\r\nsued; and on the same principle, if another man's slave commits a wrong\r\nagainst you, and then becomes your property, the action is extinguished,\r\nbecause it has come into a condition in which an action cannot exist;\r\nthe result being that even if the slave passes again out of your power\r\nyou cannot sue. Similarly, if a master commits a wrong against his\r\nslave, the latter cannot sue him after manumission or alienation.\r\n\r\n7 These rules were applied by the ancients to wrongs committed by\r\nchildren in power no less than by slaves; but the feeling of modern\r\ntimes has rightly rebelled against such inhumanity, and noxal surrender\r\nof children under power has quite gone out of use. Who could endure in\r\nthis way to give up a son, still more a daughter, to another, whereby\r\nthe father would be exposed to greater anguish in the person of a son\r\nthan even the latter himself, while mere decency forbids such treatment\r\nin the case of a daughter? Accordingly, such noxal actions are permitted\r\nonly where the wrongdoer is a slave, and indeed we find it often laid\r\ndown by old legal writers that sons in power may be sued personally for\r\ntheir own delicts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE IX. OF PAUPERIES, OR DAMAGE DONE BY QUADRUPEDS\r\n\r\nA noxal action was granted by the statute of the Twelve Tables in cases\r\nof mischief done through wantonness, passion, or ferocity, by irrational\r\nanimals; it being by an enactment of that statute provided, that if the\r\nowner of such an animal is ready to surrender it as compensation for the\r\ndamage, he shall thereby be released from all liability. Examples of\r\nthe application of this enactment may be found in kicking by a horse,\r\nor goring by a bull, known to be given that way; but the action does not\r\nlie unless in causing the damage the animal is acting contrary to its\r\nnatural disposition; if its nature be to be savage, this remedy is not\r\navailable. Thus, if a bear runs away from its owner, and causes damage,\r\nthe quondam owner cannot be sued, for immediately with its escape his\r\nownership ceased to exist. The term pauperies, or 'mischief,' is used to\r\ndenote damage done without there being any wrong in the doer of it, for\r\nan unreasoning animal cannot be said to have done a wrong. Thus far as\r\nto the noxal action.\r\n\r\n1 It is, however, to be observed that the Edict of the aedile forbids\r\ndogs, boars, bears, or lions to be kept near where there is a public\r\nroad, and directs that if any injury be caused to a free man through\r\ndisobedience of this provision, the owner of the beast shall be\r\ncondemned to pay such sum as to the judge shall seem fair and equitable:\r\nin case of any other injury the penalty is fixed at double damages.\r\nBesides this aedilician action, that on pauperies may also be sometimes\r\nbrought against the same defendant; for when two or more actions,\r\nespecially penal ones, may be brought on one and the same ground, the\r\nbringing of one does not debar the plaintiff from subsequently bringing\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE X. OF PERSONS THROUGH WHOM WE CAN BRING AN ACTION\r\n\r\nWe must now remark that a man may sue either for himself, or for another\r\nas attorney, guardian, or curator: whereas formerly one man could not\r\nsue for another except in public suits, as an assertor of freedom,\r\nand in certain actions relating to guardianship. The lex Hostilia\r\nsubsequently permitted the bringing of an action of theft on behalf\r\nof persons who were in the hands of an enemy, or absent on State\r\nemployment, and their pupils. It was, however, found extremely\r\ninconvenient to be unable to either bring or defend an action on behalf\r\nof another, and accordingly men began to employ attorneys for this\r\npurpose; for people are often hindered by illhealth, age, unavoidable\r\nabsence, and many other causes from attending to their own business.\r\n\r\n1 For the appointment of an attorney no set form of words is necessary,\r\nnor need it be made in the presence of the other party, who indeed\r\nusually knows nothing about it; for in law any one is your attorney whom\r\nyou allow to bring or defend an action on your behalf.\r\n\r\n2 The modes of appointing guardians and curators have been explained in\r\nthe first Book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XI. OF SECURITY\r\n\r\nThe old system of taking security from litigants differed from that\r\nwhich has more recently come into use.\r\n\r\nFormerly the defendant in a real action was obliged to give security, so\r\nthat if judgement went against him, and he neither gave up the property\r\nwhich was in question, nor paid the damages assessed, the plaintiff\r\nmight be able to sue either him or his sureties: and this is called\r\nsecurity for satisfaction of judgement, because the plaintiff stipulates\r\nfor payment to himself of the sum at which the damages are assessed.\r\nAnd there was all the more reason for compelling the defendant in a real\r\naction to give security if he was merely the representative of another.\r\nFrom the plaintiff in a real action no security was required if it was\r\non his own account that he sued, but if he was merely an attorney, he\r\nwas required to give security for the ratification of his proceedings\r\nby his principal, owing to the possibility of the latter's subsequently\r\nsuing in person on the same claim. Guardians and curators were required\r\nby the Edict to give the same security as attorneys; but when they\r\nappeared as plaintiffs they were sometimes excused.\r\n\r\n1 So much for real actions. In personal actions the same rules applied,\r\nso far as the plaintiff was concerned, as we have said obtained in real\r\nactions. If the defendant was represented by another person, security\r\nhad always to be given, for no one is allowed to defend another without\r\nsecurity; but if the defendant was sued on his own account, he was not\r\ncompelled to give security for satisfaction of judgement.\r\n\r\n2 Nowadays, however, the practice is different; for if the defendant\r\nis sued on his own account, he is not compelled to give security\r\nfor repayment of the damages assessed, whether the action be real or\r\npersonal; all that he has to do is to enter into a personal engagement\r\nthat he will subject himself to the jurisdiction of the court down\r\nto final judgement; the mode of making such engagement being either\r\na promise under oath, which is called a sworn recognizance, or a bare\r\npromise, or giving of sureties, according to the defendant's rank and\r\nstation.\r\n\r\n3 But the case is different where either plaintiff or defendant appears\r\nby an attorney. If the plaintiff does so, and the attorney's appointment\r\nis not enrolled in the records, or confirmed by the principal personally\r\nin court, the attorney must give security for ratification of his\r\nproceedings by his principal; and the rule is the same if a guardian,\r\ncurator, or other person who has undertaken the management of another's\r\naffairs begins an action through an attorney.\r\n\r\n4 If a defendant appears, and is ready to appoint an attorney to defend\r\nthe action for him, he can do this either by coming personally into\r\ncourt, and confirming the appointment by the solemn stipulations\r\nemployed when security is given for satisfaction of judgement, or by\r\ngiving security out of court whereby, as surety for his attorney, he\r\nguarantees the observance of all the clauses of the socalled security\r\nfor satisfaction of judgement. In all such cases, he is obliged to give\r\na right of hypothec over all his property, whether the security be given\r\nin or out of court, and this right avails against his heirs no less than\r\nagainst himself. Finally, he has to enter into a personal engagement\r\nor recognizance to appear in court when judgement is delivered; and in\r\ndefault of such appearance his surety will have to pay all the damages\r\nto which he is condemned, unless notice of appeal is given.\r\n\r\n5 If, however, the defendant for some reason or other does not appear,\r\nand another will defend for him, he may do so, and it is immaterial\r\nwhether the action be real or personal, provided he will give security\r\nfor satisfaction of the judgement in full; for we have already mentioned\r\nthe old rule, that no one is allowed to defend another without security.\r\n\r\n6 All this will appear more clearly and fully by reference to the daily\r\npractice of the courts, and to actual cases of litigation:\r\n\r\n7 and it is our pleasure that these rules shall hold not only in this\r\nour royal city, but also in all our provinces, although it may be\r\nthat through ignorance the practice elsewhere was different: for it\r\nis necessary that the provinces generally shall follow the lead of the\r\ncapital of our empire, that is, of this royal city, and observe its\r\nusages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XII. OF ACTIONS PERPETUAL AND TEMPORAL, AND WHICH MAY BE BROUGHT\r\nBY AND AGAINST HEIRS\r\n\r\nIt should be here observed that actions founded on statutes,\r\nsenatusconsults, and imperial constitutions could be brought at any\r\nlength of time from the accrual of the cause of action, until certain\r\nlimits were fixed for actions both real and personal by imperial\r\nenactments; while actions which were introduced by the praetor in the\r\nexercise of his jurisdiction could, as a rule, be brought only within a\r\nyear, that being the duration of his authority. Some praetorian actions,\r\nhowever, are perpetual, that is to say, can be brought at any time\r\nwhich does not exceed the limit fixed by the enactments referred to; for\r\ninstance, those granted to 'possessors of goods' and other persons who\r\nare fictitiously represented as heirs. So, too, the action for theft\r\ndetected in the commission, though praetorian, is perpetual, the praetor\r\nhaving judged it absurd to limit it by a year.\r\n\r\n1 Actions which will lie against a man under either the civil or the\r\npraetorian law will not always lie against his heir, the rule being\r\nabsolute that for delict--for instance, theft, robbery, outrage, or\r\nunlawful damage--no penal action can be brought against the heir. The\r\nheir of the person wronged, however, may bring these actions, except\r\nin outrage, and similar cases, if any. Sometimes, even an action on\r\ncontract cannot be brought against the heir; this being the case where\r\nthe testator has been guilty of fraud, and his heir has not profited\r\nthereby. If, however, a penal action, such as those we have mentioned,\r\nhas been actually commenced by the original parties, it is transmitted\r\nto the heirs of each.\r\n\r\n2 Finally, it must be remarked that if, before judgement is pronounced,\r\nthe defendant satisfies the plaintiff, the judges ought to absolve him,\r\neven though he was liable to condemnation at the time when the action\r\nwas commenced; this being the meaning of the old dictum, that all\r\nactions involve the power of absolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XIII. OF EXCEPTIONS\r\n\r\nWe have next to examine the nature of exceptions. Exceptions are\r\nintended for the protection of the defendant, who is often in this\r\nposition, that though the plaintiff's case is a good one in the\r\nabstract, yet as against him, the particular defendant, his contention\r\nis inequitable.\r\n\r\n1 For instance, if you are induced by duress, fraud, or mistake to\r\npromise Titius by stipulation what you did not owe him, it is clear that\r\nby the civil law you are bound, and that the action on your promise is\r\nwell grounded; yet it is inequitable that you should be condemned, and\r\ntherefore in order to defeat the action you are allowed to plead\r\nthe exception of duress, or of fraud, or one framed to suit the\r\ncircumstances of the cases.\r\n\r\n2 So too, if, as a preliminary to an advance of money, one stipulates\r\nfrom you for its repayment, and then never advances it after all, it\r\nis clear that he can sue you for the money, and you are bound by your\r\npromise to give it; but it would be iniquitous that you should be\r\ncompelled to fulfil such an engagement, and therefore you are permitted\r\nto defend yourself by the exception that the money, in point of fact,\r\nwas never advanced. The time within which this exception can be pleaded,\r\nas we remarked in a former Book, has been shortened by our constitution.\r\n\r\n3 Again, if a creditor agrees with his debtor not to sue for a debt, the\r\nlatter still remains bound, because an obligation cannot be extinguished\r\nby a bare agreement; accordingly, the creditor can validly bring against\r\nhim a personal action claiming payment of the debt, though, as it would\r\nbe inequitable that he should be condemned in the face of the agreement\r\nnot to sue, he may defend himself by pleading such agreement in the form\r\nof an exception.\r\n\r\n4 Similarly, if at his creditor's challenge a debtor affirms on oath\r\nthat he is not under an obligation to convey, he still remains bound;\r\nbut as it would be unfair to examine whether he has perjured himself,\r\nhe can, on being sued, set up the defence that he has sworn to the\r\nnonexistence of the debt. In real actions, too, exceptions are equally\r\nnecessary; thus, if on the plaintiff's challenge the defendant swears\r\nthat the property is his, there is nothing to prevent the former\r\nfrom persisting in his action; but it would be unfair to condemn the\r\ndefendant, even though the plaintiff's contention that the property is\r\nhis be well founded.\r\n\r\n5 Again, an obligation still subsists even after judgement in an action,\r\nreal or personal, in which you have been defendent, so that in strict\r\nlaw you may be sued again on the same ground of action; but you can\r\neffectually meet the claim by pleading the previous judgement.\r\n\r\n6 These examples will have been sufficient to illustrate our meaning;\r\nthe multitude and variety of the cases in which exceptions are necessary\r\nmay be learnt by reference to the larger work of the Digest or Pandects.\r\n\r\n7 Some exceptions derive their force from statutes or enactments\r\nequivalent to statutes, others from the jurisdiction of the praetor;\r\n\r\n8 and some are said to be perpetual or peremptory, others to be\r\ntemporary or dilatory.\r\n\r\n9 Perpetual or peremptory exceptions are obstructions of unlimited\r\nduration, which practically destroy the plaintiff's ground of action,\r\nsuch as the exceptions of fraud, intimidation, and agreement never to\r\nsue.\r\n\r\n10 Temporary or dilatory exceptions are merely temporary obstructions,\r\ntheir only effect being to postpone for a while the plaintiff's right\r\nto sue; for example, the plea of an agreement not to sue for a certain\r\ntime, say, five years; for at the end of that time the plaintiff can\r\neffectually pursue his remedy. Consequently persons who would like to\r\nsue before the expiration of the time, but are prevented by the plea of\r\nan agreement to the contrary, or something similar, ought to postpone\r\ntheir action till the time specified has elapsed; and it is on this\r\naccount that such exceptions are called dilatory. If a plaintiff brought\r\nhis action before the time had expired, and was met by the exception,\r\nthis would debar him from all success in those proceedings, and formerly\r\nhe was unable to sue again, owing to his having rashly brought the\r\nmatter into court, whereby he consumed his right of action, and lost all\r\nchance of recovering what was his due. Such unbending rules, however, we\r\ndo not at the present day approve. Plaintiffs who venture to commence\r\nan action before the time agreed upon, or before the obligation is yet\r\nactionable, we subject to the constitution of Zeno, which that most\r\nsacred legislator enacted as to overclaims in respect of time; whereby,\r\nif the plaintiff does not observe the stay which he has voluntarily\r\ngranted, or which is implied in the very nature of the action, the time\r\nduring which he ought to have postponed his action shall be doubled, and\r\nat its termination the defendant shall not be suable until he has been\r\nreimbursed for all expenses hitherto incurred. So heavy a penalty it is\r\nhoped will induce plaintiffs in no case to sue until they are entitled.\r\n\r\n11 Moreover, some personal incapacities produce dilatory exceptions,\r\nsuch as those relating to agency, supposing that a party wishes to be\r\nrepresented in an action by a soldier or a woman; for soldiers may not\r\nact as attorneys in litigation even on behalf of such near relatives as\r\na father, mother, or wife, not even in virtue of an imperial rescript,\r\nthough they may attend to their own affairs without committing a breach\r\nof discipline. We have sanctioned the abolition of those exceptions, by\r\nwhich the appointment of an attorney was formerly opposed on account of\r\nthe infamy of either attorney or principal, because we found that they\r\nno longer were met with in actual practice, and to prevent the trial of\r\nthe real issue being delayed by disputes as to their admissibility and\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XIV. OF REPLICATIONS\r\n\r\nSometimes an exception, which prima facie seems just to the defendant,\r\nis unjust to the plaintiff, in which case the latter must protect\r\nhimself by another allegation called a replication, because it parries\r\nand counteracts the force of the exception. For example, a creditor may\r\nhave agreed with his debtor not to sue him for money due, and then have\r\nsubsequently agreed with him that he shall be at liberty to do so; here\r\nif the creditor sues, and the debtor pleads that he ought not to be\r\ncondemned on proof being given of the agreement not to sue, he bars the\r\ncreditor's claim, for the plea is true, and remains so in spite of the\r\nsubsequent agreement; but as it would be unjust that the creditor should\r\nbe prevented from recovering, he will be allowed to plead a replication,\r\nbased upon that agreement.\r\n\r\n1 Sometimes again a replication, though prima facie just, is unjust\r\nto the defendant; in which case he must protect himself by another\r\nallegation called a rejoinder:\r\n\r\n2 and if this again, though on the face of it just, is for some reason\r\nunjust to the plaintiff, a still further allegation is necessary for his\r\nprotection, which is called a surrejoinder.\r\n\r\n3 And sometimes even further additions are required by the multiplicity\r\nof circumstances under which dispositions are made, or by which they\r\nare subsequently affected; as to which fuller information may easily be\r\ngathered from the larger work of the Digest.\r\n\r\n4 Exceptions which are open to a defendant are usually open to his\r\nsurety as well, as indeed is only fair: for when a surety is sued the\r\nprincipal debtor may be regarded as the real defendant, because he can\r\nbe compelled by the action on agency to repay the surety whatsoever he\r\nhas disbursed on his account. Accordingly, if the creditor agrees with\r\nhis debtor not to sue, the latter's sureties may plead this agreement,\r\nif sued themselves, exactly as if the agreement had been made with\r\nthem instead of with the principal debtor. There are, however, some\r\nexceptions which, though pleadable by a principal debtor, are not\r\npleadable by his surety; for instance, if a man surrenders his property\r\nto his creditors as an insolvent, and one of them sues him for his debt\r\nin full, he can effectually protect himself by pleading the surrender;\r\nbut this cannot be done by his surety, because the creditor's main\r\nobject, in accepting a surety for his debtor, is to be able to have\r\nrecourse to the surety for the satisfaction of his claim if the debtor\r\nhimself becomes insolvent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XV. OF INTERDICTS\r\n\r\nWe have next to treat of interdicts or of the actions by which they have\r\nbeen superseded. Interdicts were formulae by which the praetor either\r\nordered or forbad some thing to be done, and occurred most frequently in\r\ncase of litigation about possession or quasi-possession.\r\n\r\n1 The first division of interdicts is into orders of abstention, of\r\nrestitution, and of production. The first are those by which the praetor\r\nforbids the doing of some act--for instance, the violent ejection of\r\na bona fide possessor, forcible interference with the internment of a\r\ncorpse in a place where that may lawfully be done, building upon sacred\r\nground, or the doing of anything in a public river or on its banks\r\nwhich may impede its navigation. The second are those by which he orders\r\nrestitution of property, as where he directs possession to be restored\r\nto a 'possessor of goods' of things belonging to an inheritance, and\r\nwhich have hitherto been in the possession of others under the title\r\nof heir, or without any title at all; or where he orders a person to be\r\nreinstated in possession of land from which he has been forcibly ousted.\r\nThe third are those by which he orders the production of persons or\r\nproperty; for instance, the production of a person whose freedom is in\r\nquestion, of a freedman whose patron wishes to demand from him certain\r\nservices, or of children on the application of the parent in whose power\r\nthey are. Some think that the term interdict is properly applied only to\r\norders of abstention, because it is derived from the verb 'interdicere,'\r\nmeaning to denounce or forbid, and that orders of restitution or\r\nproduction are properly termed decrees; but in practice they are all\r\ncalled interdicts, because they are given 'inter duos,' between two\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n2 The next division is into interdicts for obtaining possession, for\r\nretaining possession, and for recovering possession.\r\n\r\n3 Interdicts for obtaining possession are exemplified by the one given\r\nto a 'possessor of goods,' which is called 'Quorum bonorum,' and which\r\nenjoins that whatever portion of the goods, whereof possession has been\r\ngranted to the claimant, is in the hands of one who holds by the title\r\nof heir or as mere possessor only, shall be delivered up to the grantee\r\nof possession. A person is deemed to hold by the title of heir who\r\nthinks he is an heir; he is deemed to hold as mere possessor who relies\r\non no title at all, but holds a portion of the whole of the inheritance,\r\nknowing that he is not entitled. It is called an interdict for obtaining\r\npossession, because it is available only for initiating possession;\r\naccordingly, it is not granted to a person who has already had and lost\r\npossession. Another interdict for obtaining possession is that named\r\nafter Salvius, by which the landlord gets possession of the tenant's\r\nproperty which has been hypothecated as a security for rent.\r\n\r\n4 The interdicts 'Uti possidetis' and 'Utrubi' are interdicts for\r\nretaining possession, and are employed when two parties claim ownership\r\nin anything, in order to determine which shall be defendant and which\r\nplaintiff; for no real action can be commenced until it is ascertained\r\nwhich of the parties is in possession, because law and reason both\r\nrequire that one of them shall be in possession and shall be sued by\r\nthe other. As the role of defendant in a real action is far more\r\nadvantageous than that of plaintiff, there is almost invariably a keen\r\ndispute as to which party is to have possession pending litigation: the\r\nadvantage consisting in this, that, even if the person in possession has\r\nno title as owner, the possession remains to him unless and until the\r\nplaintiff can prove his own ownership: so that where the rights of the\r\nparties are not clear, judgement usually goes against the plaintiff.\r\nWhere the dispute relates to the possession of land or buildings,\r\nthe interdict called 'Uti possidetis' is employed; where to movable\r\nproperty, that called 'Utrubi.' Under the older law their effects were\r\nvery different. In 'Uti possidetis' the party in possession at the\r\nissue of the interdict was the winner, provided he had not obtained\r\nthat possession from his adversary by force, or clandestinely, or by\r\npermission; whether he had obtained it from some one else in any of\r\nthese modes was immaterial. In 'Utrubi' the winner was the party who\r\nhad been in possession the greater portion of the year next immediately\r\npreceding, provided that possession had not been obtained by force, or\r\nclandestinely, or by permission, from his adversary. At the present\r\nday, however, the practice is different, for as regards the right to\r\nimmediate possession the two interdicts are now on the same footing;\r\nthe rule being, that whether the property in question be movable or\r\nimmovable, the possession is adjudged to the party who has it at the\r\ncommencement of the action, provided he had not obtained it by force, or\r\nclandestinely, or by permission, from his adversary.\r\n\r\n5 A man's possession includes, besides his own personal possession, the\r\npossession of any one who holds in his name, though not subject to his\r\npower; for instance, his tenant. So also a depositary or borrower for\r\nuse may possess for him, as is expressed by the saying that we retain\r\npossession by any one who holds in our name. Moreover, mere intention\r\nsuffices for the retention of possession; so that although a man is not\r\nin actual possession either himself or through another, yet if it was\r\nnot with the intention of abandoning the thing that he left it, but with\r\nthat of subsequently returning to it, he is deemed not to have parted\r\nwith the possession. Through what persons we can obtain possession has\r\nbeen explained in the second Book; and it is agreed on all hands that\r\nfor obtaining possession intention alone does not suffice.\r\n\r\n6 An interdict for recovering possession is granted to persons who have\r\nbeen forcibly ejected from land or buildings; their proper remedy being\r\nthe interdict 'Unde vi,' by which the ejector is compelled to restore\r\npossession, even though it had been originally obtained from him by the\r\ngrantee of the interdict by force, clandestinely, or by permission.\r\nBut by imperial constitutions, as we have already observed, if a man\r\nviolently seizes on property to which he has a title, he forfeits his\r\nright of ownership; if on property which belongs to some one else,\r\nhe has not only to restore it, but also to pay the person whom he has\r\nviolently dispossessed a sum of money equivalent to its value. In cases\r\nof violent dispossession the wrongdoer is liable under the lex Iulia\r\nrelating to private or public violence, by the former being meant\r\nunarmed force, by the latter dispossession effected with arms; and\r\nthe term 'arms' must be taken to include not only shields, swords, and\r\nhelmets, but also sticks and stones.\r\n\r\n7 Thirdly, interdicts are divided into simple and double. Simple\r\ninterdicts are those wherein one party is plaintiff and the other\r\ndefendant, as is always the case in orders of restitution or production;\r\nfor he who demands restitution or production is plaintiff, and he from\r\nwhom it is demanded is defendant. Of interdicts which order abstention\r\nsome are simple, others double. The simple are exemplified by those\r\nwherein the praetor commands the defendant to abstain from desecrating\r\nconsecrated ground, or from obstructing a public river or its banks; for\r\nhe who demands such order is the plaintiff, and he who is attempting\r\nto do the act in question is defendant. Of double interdicts we have\r\nexamples in Uti possidetis and Utrubi; they are called double because\r\nthe footing of both parties is equal, neither being exclusively\r\nplaintiff or defendant, but each sustaining the double role.\r\n\r\n8 To speak of the procedure and result of interdicts under the older law\r\nwould now be a waste of words; for when the procedure is what is called\r\n'extraordinary,' as it is nowadays in all actions, the issue of an\r\ninterdict is unnecessary, the matter being decided without any such\r\npreliminary step in much the same way as if it had actually been taken,\r\nand a modified action had arisen on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XVI. OF THE PENALTIES FOR RECKLESS LITIGATION\r\n\r\nIt should here be observed that great pains have been taken by those\r\nwho in times past had charge of the law to deter men from reckless\r\nlitigation, and this is a thing that we too have at heart. The best\r\nmeans of restraining unjustifiable litigation, whether on the part of\r\na plaintiff or of a defendant, are money fines, the employment of the\r\noath, and the fear of infamy.\r\n\r\n1 Thus under our constitution, the oath has to be taken by every\r\ndefendant, who is not permitted even to state his defence until he\r\nswears that he resists the plaintiff's claim because he believes that\r\nhis cause is a good one. In certain cases where the defendant denies his\r\nliability the action is for double or treble the original claim, as in\r\nproceedings on unlawful damages, and for recovery of legacies bequeathed\r\nto religious places. In various actions the damages are multiplied at\r\nthe outset; in an action on theft detected in the commission they are\r\nquadrupled; for simple theft they are doubled; for in these and some\r\nother actions the damages are a multiple of the plaintiff's loss,\r\nwhether the defendant denies or admits the claim. Vexatious litigation\r\nis checked on the part of the plaintiff also, who under our constitution\r\nis obliged to swear on oath that his action is commenced in good faith;\r\nand similar oaths have to be taken by the advocates of both parties, as\r\nis prescribed in other of our enactments. Owing to these substitutes the\r\nold action of dishonest litigation has become obsolete. The effect\r\nof this was to penalize the plaintiff in a tenth part of the value he\r\nclaimed by action; but, as a matter of fact, we found that the penalty\r\nwas never exacted, and therefore its place has been taken by the oath\r\nabove mentioned, and by the rule that a plaintiff who sues without just\r\ncause must compensate his opponent for all losses incurred, and also pay\r\nthe costs of the action.\r\n\r\n2 In some actions condemnation carries infamy with it, as in those on\r\ntheft, robbery, outrage, fraud, guardianship, agency, and deposit, if\r\ndirect, not contrary; also in the action on partnership, which is always\r\ndirect, and in which infamy is incurred by any partner who suffers\r\ncondemnation. In actions on theft, robbery, outrage, and fraud, it is\r\nnot only infamous to be condemned, but also to compound, as indeed is\r\nonly just; for obligation based on delict differs widely from obligation\r\nbased on contract.\r\n\r\n3 In commencing an action, the first step depends upon that part of the\r\nEdict which relates to summons; for before anything else is done, the\r\nadversary must be summoned, that is to say, must be called before\r\nthe judge who is to try the action. And herein the praetor takes into\r\nconsideration the respect due to parents, patrons, and the children and\r\nparents of patrons, and refuses to allow a parent to be summoned by his\r\nchild, or a patron by his freedman, unless permission so to do has been\r\nasked of and obtained from him; and for nonobservance of this rule he\r\nhas fixed a penalty of fifty solidi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XVII. OF THE DUTIES OF A JUDGE\r\n\r\nFinally we have to treat of the duties of a judge; of which the first is\r\nnot to judge contrary to statutes, the imperial laws, and custom.\r\n\r\n1 Accordingly, if he is trying a noxal action, and thinks that the\r\nmaster ought to be condemned, he should be careful to word his judgement\r\nthus: 'I condemn Publius Maevius to pay ten aurei to Lucius Titius, or\r\nto surrender to him the slave that did the wrong.'\r\n\r\n2 If the action is real, and he finds against the plaintiff, he ought to\r\nabsolve the defendant; if against the latter, he ought to order him\r\nto give up the property in question, along with its fruits. If the\r\ndefendant pleads that he is unable to make immediate restitution and\r\napplies for execution to be stayed, and such application appears to\r\nbe in good faith, it should be granted upon the terms of his finding a\r\nsurety to guarantee payment of the damages assessed, if restitution be\r\nnot made within the time allowed. If the subject of the action be an\r\ninheritance, the same rule applies as regards fruits as we laid down in\r\nspeaking of actions for the recovery of single objects. If the defendant\r\nis a mala fide possessor, fruits which but for his own negligence he\r\nmight have gathered are taken into account in much the same way in both\r\nactions; but a bona fide possessor is not held answerable for fruits\r\nwhich he has not consumed or has not gathered, except from the moment\r\nof the commencement of the action, after which time account is taken as\r\nwell of fruits which might have been gathered but for his negligence as\r\nof those which have been gathered and consumed.\r\n\r\n3 If the object of the action be production of property, its mere\r\nproduction by the defendant is not enough, but it must be accompanied by\r\nevery advantage derived from it; that is to say, the plaintiff must be\r\nplaced in the same position he would have been in if production had\r\nbeen made immediately on the commencement of the action. Accordingly\r\nif, during the delay occasioned by trial, the possessor has completed\r\na title to the property by usucapion, he will not be thereby saved from\r\nbeing condemned. The judge ought also to take into account the mesne\r\nprofits, or fruits produced by the property in the interval between the\r\ncommencement of the action and judgement. If the defendant pleads that\r\nhe is unable to make immediate production, and applies for a stay, and\r\nsuch application appears to be in good faith, it should be granted on\r\nhis giving security that he will render up the property. If he neither\r\ncomplies at once with the judge's order for production, nor gives\r\nsecurity for doing so afterwards, he ought to be condemned in a sum\r\nrepresenting the plaintiff's interest in having production at the\r\ncommencement of the proceedings.\r\n\r\n4 In an action for the division of a 'family' the judge ought to assign\r\nto each of the heirs specific articles belonging to the inheritance, and\r\nif one of them is unduly favoured, to condemn him, as we have already\r\nsaid, to pay a fixed sum to the other as compensation. Again, the fact\r\nthe one only of two jointheirs has gathered the fruits of land comprised\r\nin the inheritance, or has damaged or consumed something belonging\r\nthereto, is ground for ordering him to pay compensation to the other;\r\nand it is immaterial, so far as this action is concerned, whether the\r\njointheirs are only two or more in number.\r\n\r\n5 The same rules are applied in an action for partition of a number\r\nof things held by joint-owners. If such an action be brought for the\r\npartition of a single object, such as an estate, which easily admits\r\nof division, the judge ought to assign a specific portion of each\r\njointowner, condemning such one as seems to be unduly favoured to pay\r\na fixed sum to the other as compensation. If the property cannot be\r\nconveniently divided--as a slave, for instance, or a mule--it ought\r\nto be adjudged entirely to one only of the jointowners, who should be\r\nordered to pay a fixed sum to the other as compensation.\r\n\r\n6 In an action for rectification of boundaries the judge ought to\r\nexamine whether an adjudication of property is actually necessary. There\r\nis only one case where this is so; where, namely, convenience requires\r\nthat the line of separation between fields belonging to different owners\r\nshall be more clearly marked than heretofore, and where, accordingly,\r\nit is requisite to adjudge part of the one's field to the owner of the\r\nother, who ought, in consequence, to be ordered to pay a fixed sum as\r\ncompensation to his neighbour. Another ground for condemnation in\r\nthis action is the commission of any malicious act, in respect of the\r\nboundaries, by either of the parties, such as removal of landmarks, or\r\ncutting down boundary trees: as also is contempt of court, expressed by\r\nrefusal to allow the fields to be surveyed in accordance with a judge's\r\norder.\r\n\r\n7 Wherever property is adjudged to a party in any of these actions, he\r\nat once acquires a complete title thereto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE XVIII. OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS\r\n\r\nPublic prosecutions are not commenced as actions are, nor indeed is\r\nthere any resemblance between them and the other remedies of which we\r\nhave spoken; on the contrary, they differ greatly both in the mode in\r\nwhich they are commenced, and in the rules by which they are conducted.\r\n\r\n1 They are called public because as a general rule any citizen may come\r\nforward as prosecutor in them.\r\n\r\n2 Some are capital, others not. By capital prosecutions we mean those\r\nin which the accused may be punished with the extremest severity of the\r\nlaw, with interdiction from water and fire, with deportation, or with\r\nhard labour in the mines: those which entail only infamy and pecuniary\r\npenalties are public, but not capital.\r\n\r\n3 The following statutes relate to public prosecutions. First, there is\r\nthe lex Iulia on treason, which includes any design against the Emperor\r\nor State; the penalty under it is death, and even after decease the\r\nguilty person's name and memory are branded with infamy.\r\n\r\n4 The lex Iulia, passed for the repression of adultery, punishes with\r\ndeath not only defilers of the marriage-bed, but also those who indulge\r\nin criminal intercourse with those of their own sex, and inflicts\r\npenalties on any who without using violence seduce virgins or widows\r\nof respectable character. If the seducer be of reputable condition,\r\nthe punishment is confiscation of half his fortune; if a mean person,\r\nflogging and relegation.\r\n\r\n5 The lex Cornelia on assassination pursues those persons, who commit\r\nthis crime with the sword of vengeance, and also all who carry weapons\r\nfor the purpose of homicide. By a 'weapon,' as is remarked by Gaius in\r\nhis commentary on the statute of the Twelve Tables, is ordinarily meant\r\nsome missile shot from a bow, but it also signifies anything thrown with\r\nthe hand; so that stones and pieces of wood or iron are included in the\r\nterm. 'Telum,' in fact, or 'weapon,' is derived from the Greek 'telou,'\r\nand so means anything thrown to a distance. A similar connexion of\r\nmeaning may be found in the Greek word 'belos,' which corresponds to our\r\n'telum,' and which is derived from 'ballesthai,' to throw, as we learn\r\nfrom Xenophon, who writes, 'they carried with them 'belei,' namely\r\nspears, bows and arrows, slings, and large numbers of stones.'\r\n'Sicarius,' or assassin, is derived from 'sica,' a long steel knife.\r\nThis statute also inflicts punishment of death on poisoners, who kill\r\nmen by their hateful arts of poison and magic, or who publicly sell\r\ndeadly drugs.\r\n\r\n6 A novel penalty has been devised for a most odious crime by another\r\nstatute, called the lex Pompeia on parricide, which provides that any\r\nperson who by secret machination or open act shall hasten the death of\r\nhis parent, or child, or other relation whose murder amounts in law to\r\nparricide, or who shall be an instigator or accomplice of such a crime,\r\nalthough a stranger, shall suffer the penalty of parricide. This is not\r\nexecution by the sword or by fire, or any ordinary form of punishment,\r\nbut the criminal is sewn up in a sack with a dog, a cock, a viper, and\r\nan ape, and in this dismal prison is thrown into the sea or a river,\r\naccording to the nature of the locality, in order that even before death\r\nhe shall begin to be deprived of the enjoyment of the elements, the\r\nair being denied him while alive, and interment in the earth when dead.\r\nThose who kill persons related to them by kinship or affinity, but whose\r\nmurder is not parricide, will suffer the penalties of the lex Cornelia\r\non assassination.\r\n\r\n7 The lex Cornelia on forgery, otherwise called the statute of wills,\r\ninflicts penalties on all who shall write, seal, or read a forged will\r\nor other document, or shall substitute the same for the real original,\r\nor who shall knowingly and feloniously make, engrave, or use a false\r\nseal. If the criminal be a slave, the penalty fixed by the statute is\r\ndeath, as in the statute relating to assassins and poisoners: if a free\r\nman, deportation.\r\n\r\n8 The lex Iulia, relating to public or private violence, deals with\r\nthose persons who use force armed or unarmed. For the former,\r\nthe penalty fixed by the statute is deportation; for the latter,\r\nconfiscation of one third of the offender's property. Ravishment of\r\nvirgins, widows, persons professed in religion, or others, and all\r\nassistance in its perpetration, is punished capitally under the\r\nprovisions of our constitution, by reference to which full information\r\non this subject is obtainable.\r\n\r\n9 The lex Iulia on embezzlement punishes all who steal money or other\r\nproperty belonging to the State, or devoted to the maintenance of\r\nreligion. Judges who during the term of office embezzle public money are\r\npunishable with death, as also are their aiders and abettors, and any\r\nwho receive such money knowing it to have been stolen. Other persons who\r\nviolate the provisions of this statute are liable to deportation.\r\n\r\n10 A public prosecution may also be brought under the lex Fabia relating\r\nto manstealing, for which a capital penalty is sometimes inflicted under\r\nimperial constitutions, sometimes a lighter punishment.\r\n\r\n11 Other statutes which give rise to such prosecutions are the lex Iulia\r\non bribery, and three others, which are similarly entitled, and which\r\nrelate to judicial extortion, to illegal combinations for raising the\r\nprice of corn, and to negligence in the charge of public moneys. These\r\ndeal with special varieties of crime, and the penalties which they\r\ninflict on those who infringe them in no case amount to death, but are\r\nless severe in character.\r\n\r\n12 We have made these remarks on public prosecutions only to enable you\r\nto have the merest acquaintance with them, and as a kind of guide to a\r\nfuller study of the subject, which, with the assistance of Heaven, you\r\nmay make by reference to the larger volume of the Digest or Pandects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE INSTITUTES OF JUSTINIAN",
