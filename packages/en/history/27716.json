Several\r\nhave been written, but I do want, very, very much, to paint a portrait\r\nof this dear old town of my birth where my parents, my grandparents,\r\ngreat-grandfathers and one great-great-grandfather lived, and which I\r\nlove so dearly.\r\n\r\nA portrait, partly of its physical features, its streets, its houses and\r\ngardens, some of which still exist in their pristine glory but, alas,\r\nmany of which have gone the way of so-called progress. In place of the\r\ndignified houses of yore, of real architectural beauty, stand rows of\r\ncheap dwellings or stores, erected mostly in the seventies and eighties\r\nwhen architecture was at its worst. In 1895 it was that the old names of\r\nthe streets were taken away and from then on we've been just an adjunct\r\nof Washington.\r\n\r\nNot only of its physical side do I wish to tell, but I want to paint a\r\npicture of the kind of people who lived here, from the beginning up\r\nthrough the gay nineties--nearly one hundred and fifty years. Of the\r\nkind of things they did, their work, their play, their thoughts and\r\ntheir beliefs, for the character of the town, like human beings, was\r\nformed largely by their beliefs, and these old Scotsmen--for they were\r\ngreatly in the majority--laid a great deal of stress on their\r\nPresbyterian form of Christianity. Witness the oath that had to be taken\r\nby the Flour Inspector on February 24, 1772: \"I, Thomas Brannan, do\r\ndeclare that I do believe that there is not any trnsubstantiation in\r\nthe Sacrament of the Lord's Supper or in the elements of bread and\r\nwine, at or after the consecration thereof by any person whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, with this strong prejudice, they cooperated and lived on\r\nfriendly terms with the Roman Catholics who, very soon after the taking\r\nof this particular oath, founded their college and established their\r\nconvent for teaching young girls.\r\n\r\nDr. Balch counselled well when he besought his people: \"Let us resolve\r\nto be social rather than fashionable, and generous instead of\r\nextravagant.\"\r\n\r\nAll down through the years and to this day I think that has been the\r\nhall-mark of the real Georgetonian. A great deal of fashion has come to\r\nGeorgetown, as in the early days of the bringing of the government when\r\nWashington City was a waste and almost entirely one big mud puddle, and\r\nthe foreign ministers and many high in our government sought the comfort\r\nand dignity of this town, which was then far from young.\r\n\r\nAgain in later years there has been an exodus across Rock Creek of men\r\nand women high in the government; in the diplomatic corps; in industry;\r\nin literature and the arts; lured hither by the quiet dignity of the\r\nold-time atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThere are today living in Georgetown descendants of nearly every one of\r\nthe original makers of the town, and all through these years the old\r\nfriendships still persist and flourish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to express my thanks to all the people who have\r\nhelped me and made it possible to write this book. I want to mention\r\nMrs. Gilbert Grosvenor; Miss Williams of the Peabody Room of the\r\nGeorgetown Branch of the Public Library; Miss McPherson and Mr. John\r\nBeverley Riggs of the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress;\r\nMr. Meredith Colket and Mr. O. W. Holmes of the National Archives; Dr.\r\nH. Paul Caemmerer, Secretary of the Commission of Fine Arts; Miss\r\nPennybaker, of the Real Estate and Columbia Title Insurance Company; the\r\nMount Vernon Ladies' Association and Mr. C. C. Wall, Superintendent of\r\nMount Vernon. Also the various people who did the typing and helped\r\nsecure the photographs.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least the friends of the old regime who have given to\r\nme freely of the history and traditions of their ancestors. They are too\r\nmany to name, but to each one I owe a real debt of gratitude. Especially\r\nto one, my life-long friend, am I indebted. Without her unceasing\r\ninterest and encouragement this Portrait might never have been done.\r\n\r\nGRACE GLASGOW DUNLOP ECKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                             _Page_\r\n\r\n    DEDICATION                                                   v\r\n\r\n    GEORGE TOWN GHOSTS                                         vii\r\n\r\n    FOREWORD                                                    ix\r\n\r\n    _Chapter_\r\n\r\n    I.

Thus he wrote of the\r\nsite of George Town:\r\n\r\n     \"Monday, the 25th of June, we set sail for the Town of Tohoga,\r\n     where we came to anchor two leagues short of the falls: this place\r\n     is without question the most pleasant in all this country and most\r\n     convenient for habitation; the air temperate in summer and not\r\n     violent in winter. The river aboundeth in all manner of fish, and\r\n     for deer, buffalos, bears and turkeys, the woods do swarm with them\r\n     and the soil is exceedingly fertile.\"\r\n\r\nHenry Fleete remained with the Indians about twelve years, whether of\r\nhis own free will or as a captive is not quite certain, but evidently\r\nthis writing of his was to good purpose, for, in the next decade, small\r\nparties of Scots and Irish began settling on the Potomac at the mouth of\r\nRock Creek.\r\n\r\nThe Indians whom these white men found here belonged to the Algonquin\r\nNation, which included many tribes. Thomas Jefferson says there were\r\nprobably forty of these tribes between the Atlantic Ocean and the\r\nPotomac River. The tribe living within the limits of the present\r\nDistrict of Columbia was the Nacotchankes or Anacostians, as the British\r\ncalled them, hence, the name given to the Eastern branch of the Potomac,\r\nwhere the largest village was situated, near what is now called Benning.\r\nWest of Rock Creek was the village of Tohoga, on the site of what became\r\nGeorge Town.\r\n\r\nThe Indian families lived on cultivated farms of a few acres, each\r\nstrung out along the river. From it came a large part of their food,\r\nand, of course, it was their best mode of communication by canoe.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting activity of these Indians was the manufacture of\r\nall manner of tools from the stones which they found in the surrounding\r\nhills. These cobblestones had been washed down by the river ages before.\r\nIn later years they paved the streets of Georgetown, but these Indians\r\nused them to form arrow-darts, knives, spear points, scrapers, and\r\ndrills of all sizes. Traces of these quarries were found as late as\r\n1900; the largest of them seems to have been on Piney Branch, where it\r\nis crossed by 16th Street. It is now obliterated.\r\n\r\nThere was, also, in this region, soapstone, and from it and from clay,\r\nthe Indians made pots and vessels for household use.\r\n\r\nScientists think that other tribes came from far away to barter their\r\ngoods for these implements, and so, over three hundred years ago, this\r\nplace was a sort of metropolis for the Indians.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, by way of the river that the settlers came to this\r\nregion after the grant of the Colony of Maryland to Lord Baltimore as\r\nLord Proprietor. This colony of Maryland differed from the other\r\ncolonies in the fact that all the land was the property of Lord\r\nBaltimore, to give or sell as he pleased. Another difference was the\r\nestablishment of the Manorial System, by which the owner of one thousand\r\nacres or more became Lord of his Manor. (It was almost like the Feudal\r\nSystem.)\r\n\r\nIn 1703 a grant of 795 acres was made to Ninian Beall, beginning thus:\r\n\r\n    \"Charles, Absolute Lord and Proprietor of the Province of\r\n    Maryland....\r\n\r\n    Know yee that for and in consideration that Ninian Beall of Prince\r\n    Georges County had due unto him 795 acres of land within our\r\n    Province....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. JAMES McVEAN (See Chapter XI)]\r\n\r\n    We do therefore grant unto him the said Ninian Beall all that tract\r\n    or parcell of land called Rock of Dunbarton, lying in the said\r\n    County, beginning at the Southwest corner Tree, of a tract of land\r\n    taken for Robert Mason standing by Potomack River side at the mouth\r\n    of Rock Creek....\r\n\r\n    To have and to hold the same unto him the said Ninian Beall, his\r\n    heirs and assignees forever to be holden of us and our heirs as of\r\n    our manor of Calverton in free and Common Soccage by fealty only\r\n    for all manner of services yielding and paying therefor yearly unto\r\n    us and our heirs at our receipt at the City of St. Maries at the\r\n    two most usual feasts in the year--at the feast of Annunciacion\r\n    of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Michael the Archangell by even\r\n    and equal porcions the rent of one pound eleven shillings and nine\r\n    pence half penny sterling silver or gold....\r\n\r\n    Given under our Greater Seal of Armes, this eighteenth day of\r\n    November, one thousand seven hundred and three, witness our trusty\r\n    and well beloved Colonel Henry Darnell, keeper of our said Greater\r\n    Seale in our said Province of Maryland.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Ninian Beall lived a long and interesting life. He had been born\r\nin Largo, Fifes Shire, Scotland, in 1625. There he had been an officer\r\nin the Scottish-English Army, which fought for the Stuarts' Army against\r\nCromwell; he was made a prisoner at the battle of Dunbar, September 3,\r\n1650, and sentenced to five years servitude in the Barbadoes, West\r\nIndies. Many gentlemen were so sentenced as political prisoners and sent\r\nout as industrial servants at that time. He was eventually sent to\r\nMaryland, where, after completing his term of servitude, he proved his\r\nright to 50 acres of land and received many hundreds more for bringing\r\nout immigrants and settling there.\r\n\r\nHe held many notable and honorable offices in the colony, and, in 1699,\r\nthe General Assembly passed an Act of Gratitude for the distinguished\r\nIndian services of Colonel Ninian Beall.\r\n\r\nAs he was Commander in Chief of the Provincial Forces in Maryland, he\r\nprobably visited the garrison at the Falls and so knew this region long\r\nbefore he was granted this tract of the Rock of Dunbarton. He previously\r\nhad procured 225 acres on the east side of Rock Creek just opposite,\r\ncalled Beall's Levels.\r\n\r\nNinian Beall died in 1717 at his home, Fifer Largo, near Upper Marlboro,\r\nMaryland. From a description of him in the Records of the Columbia\r\nHistorical Society:\r\n\r\n    ... \"He had a complexion characteristic of his nationality, with an\r\n    unusually heavy growth of long red hair, and was over six feet in\r\n    height, powerful in brawn and muscle and phenomenal in physical\r\n    endurance.\"\r\n\r\nHe had twelve children, six sons and six daughters. In his will is\r\nrecorded:\r\n\r\n    \"I do give and bequeath unto my son George, my plantation and tract\r\n    of land called the Rock of Dunbarton, lying and being at Rock\r\n    Creek, containing four hundred and eight acres, with all the stock\r\n    thereon, both cattle and hogs, them and their increase, unto my\r\n    said son, George, and unto his heirs forever.\r\n\r\n    \"I do also give and bequeath, unto my said son, George Beall, his\r\n    choice of one of my feather beds, bolster and pillow and other\r\n    furniture thereunto belonging, with two cows and calves and half my\r\n    sheep from off this plantation I now live on, unto him and his\r\n    heirs forever.\"\r\n\r\nThis son, George, was the eighth child of Ninian Beall. He had a son,\r\nThomas, who always styled himself Thomas Beall of George; of him we\r\nshall hear more later on. The family was not limited to these, for many\r\nother Bealls, men and women, appear in the annals of George Town.\r\n\r\nGeorge Gordon, the other of the two original proprietors of the lands\r\nwhich became George Town, was also a Scotsman and had a share in a\r\nmanufacture at Leith, near Edinburgh, so it is evident that, when he\r\ncame to this country, he had means which he invested in Prince Georges\r\nCounty and Frederick County, Maryland. He held the office of Sheriff of\r\nFrederick County and was a judge of the first County Court.\r\n\r\nA deed to Gordon from James Smith, \"planter,\" is dated November 13,\r\n1734. In it, George Gordon is described as \"merchant.\" The tract\r\nconveyed was one hundred acres, known as \"Knaves' Disappointment,\" a\r\npart of three hundred acres called his Rock Creek Plantation. The\r\nconsideration was one hundred pounds sterling or about five hundred\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that the original Inspection House of George Gordon was\r\nbuilt of logs not far from the mouth of Rock Creek, fronting on the\r\nPotomac, somewhere between 1734 and 1748. The main inspection house was\r\nbuilt later on \"the warehouse lot,\" an acre close to the southwest\r\nintersection of Falls and Water Streets (M Street and Wisconsin Avenue).\r\nHe resided nearby at the site of 3206 M. Street. Later on, in 1745,\r\nGeorge Gordon bought an estate for a permanent home; it is thought to\r\nhave been near Holy Rood Cemetery or near the Industrial Home School on\r\nWisconsin Avenue. After the death of his wife, George Gordon left his\r\nRock Creek Plantation, and went to live at \"Woodyard\" with Stephen West.\r\n\r\nThe will of George Gordon is dated May 10, 1766. At the time of his\r\ndeath he had a son, John, and a daughter, who had married Tobias Belt.\r\nTo his son, John, \"mariner,\" who was in the East India service, he\r\ndevised the dwelling house at Rock Creek Plantation on Goose Creek and\r\nthe waterside lot in Georgetown numbered 75.\r\n\r\nIn those days tobacco was, of course, the big crop, and an English\r\nwriter called it \"the meat, drink, clothing, and money of the\r\ncolonists.\" Regulations were very strict in regard to the exportation of\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nInspection houses for tobacco such as that of George Gordon were also\r\ncalled Rolling Houses, from the fact that the hogsheads of tobacco had a\r\nhole bored in each head and an axle run through from one end to another.\r\nTo this axle a shaft was attached, and drawn by a horse or an ox, so\r\nrolled along over the rough roads of that time to their destinations.\r\nHere was the one place in Frederick County for inspection; here was a\r\nnatural site for a town, and so came the demand for one.\r\n\r\nOn June 8, 1751 the Assembly of the Province of Maryland appointed\r\ncommissioners to lay out a town here in the county of Frederick, which\r\nhad been formed in 1748 from Prince Georges County. The first appointed\r\nwere: Captain Henry Wright Crabb, Masters John Needham, James Perrie,\r\nSamuel Magruder III, Josiah Beall, David Lynn. Appointed as their\r\nsuccessors from time to time as vacancies occurred, were: Andrew Heugh,\r\n1754; Robert Peter, 1757; John Murdock, 1766; Thomas Richardson, 1772;\r\nWilliam Deakins, Jr., 1772; Bernard O'Neill, 1782; Thomas Beall, of\r\nGeorge, 1782; Benj. Stoddert, Samuel Davidson, 1785; John Peter, 1789,\r\nand Adam Steuart. The last named gave up his American citizenship and\r\nwent to Europe to live, as he was not in sympathy with the Revolution.\r\nHis land was confiscated by the State of Maryland. The Surveyors and\r\nClerks of the Commissioners were:\r\n\r\n    Alexander Beall, 1751-1757; Josiah Beall, 1757-1774; Robert\r\n    Ferguson, 1774, and Daniel Reintzel, 1774-1782.\r\n\r\nMeetings were held in private houses through all the years until 1789,\r\nwhen, at last, George Town was incorporated.\r\n\r\nTo return to the year 1752, when the first survey of ground for the town\r\nwas made, among the tracts surveyed were the following with their names:\r\n\r\n    Conjurer's Disappointment (Deakins)\r\n    Frogland (Thomas Beatty)\r\n    Knave's Disappointment (George Gordon)\r\n    Discovery (Robert Peter)\r\n    Resurvey on Salop (John Threlkeld)\r\n    Pretty Prospect (Benjamin Stoddert)\r\n    Beall's Levels and Rock of Dumbarton (George Beall)\r\n\r\nThe survey was completed on February 28, 1752 and Beall's and Gordon's\r\nland found \"most convenient.\" Each gentleman was offered two town lots\r\nbesides the price of condemnation. George Gordon chose numbers 48 and\r\n52. George Beall had refused to recognize the proceedings of the\r\ncommissioners in any way, so he was notified that \"if he did not make\r\nhis choice of lots within 10 days from February 28th, he could only\r\nblame himself for the consequences.\" After reflecting for a week he sent\r\nthe following answer:\r\n\r\n    If I must part with my property by force, I had better save a\r\n    little than be totally demolished. Rather than none, I accept these\r\n    lots, numbers 72 and 79, said to be Mr. Henderson's and Mr.\r\n    Edmonston's. But I do hereby protest and declare that my acceptance\r\n    of the said lots, which is by force, shall not debar me from\r\n    future redress from the Commissions or others, if I can have the\r\n    rights of a British subject. God save the King.\r\n\r\n    GEORGE BEALL.\r\n\r\n    March 7, 1752.\r\n\r\nCan't you see how difficult it was for the old gentleman (he must then,\r\nby the records, have been about sixty years of age or more) to cooperate\r\nwith the changes that were coming to ruin, as he thought, his\r\ncomfortable and profitable plantation life?\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and eighty pounds were paid for the sixty acres of the\r\noriginal town. The southern boundary was the river, the western about\r\nwhere the college now stands, the eastern a few feet west of the present\r\n30th Street, and the northern boundary was a few feet south of the\r\npresent N Street. The only boundary stone still existing is the one that\r\nwas No. 2 in the survey, the northeastern corner of the town, and is now\r\nin the garden of number 3014 N. Street. There were eighty lots in the\r\noriginal town.\r\n\r\nThe name has been variously attributed to George II, the King then\r\nreigning; to the two Georges from whom the land was taken, and to George\r\nWashington, which last is, of course, absurd, as he was then a young man\r\nof twenty, engaged in surveying the properties of Lord Fairfax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\n_The Original Town and Its People_\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Town flourished and became more and more a busy port. Its\r\npopulation in 1800 was 2,993; by 1810 it was 4,948. Its wharves were\r\nthronged with vessels sailing across the seas laden with the \"precious\r\nweed\" and with wheat brought in from plantations for the \"flouring\r\nmills\" in great Conestoga wagons painted red and blue drawn by six-horse\r\nteams adorned with gay harness and jingling bells. Also, there was a\r\nthriving coastwise trade, up to old Salem and Newburyport where the\r\nclipper ships were built, and down to the West Indies. These ships\r\nbrought back sugar, molasses, and rum, and from the old country came\r\nclothing, and furniture, and all sorts of luxuries, for the thriving\r\nmerchants were building comfortable homes and furnishing them in\r\nelegance and taste.\r\n\r\nGeneral Edward Braddock, after a brilliant military career under Prince\r\nWilliam of Orange, in Holland, had been made a major-general and put in\r\ncharge of troops in Virginia against the French. He landed his troops in\r\nAlexandria, marched them up to where the ferry crossed to George Town,\r\nwhere they divided, part going through Virginia, and he, with the\r\nremainder, crossing the Potomac to George Town from whence he continued\r\non his fateful march to Fort Duquesne, where he met his terrible defeat\r\nand lost his life.\r\n\r\nHe had come from Perthshire in old Scotland, so, of course, had received\r\na warm welcome in this Scottish town. And thus he had written back to\r\nEngland to George Anne Bellamy, the gifted actress, in 1755: \"For never\r\nhave I attended a more complete banquet or met better dressed or better\r\nmannered people than I met on my arrival in George Town, which is named\r\nafter our gracious Majesty.\" If only he had mentioned in whose house the\r\nbanquet was or the names of some of these agreeable people he met!\r\n\r\nJames Truslow Adams, in his fascinating book, _The Epic of America_,\r\nspeaks over and over again of the culture of the pre-Revolutionary towns\r\nalong the Atlantic seaboard, and what a high point it had reached. No\r\nbetter example could be found than this old town with its families who\r\nhad come from well-to-do circumstances, not, as was the case with so\r\nmany settlers of the new country, in order to escape trouble. They came\r\nmostly from Scotland; witness the names as time goes on. Indeed, to such\r\nan extent, that the little settlement had first of all been called New\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nOne of the very first to establish himself in the business of exporting\r\ntobacco, was Robert Peter, who is often spoken of in old records as\r\n\"George Town's pioneer business man,\" and also as \"The merchant prince\r\nand land owner.\" As a young man of about twenty he had come from\r\nCrossbasket near Glasgow, first to Bladensburg and thence to George\r\nTown, and in 1752 established himself in business, and in 1790 became\r\nits first mayor. He represented the firm of John Glassford & Company of\r\nNorth Britain, Glasgow, well known both in England and in Scotland. So\r\nmuch of the tobacco trade flowed into the Scottish city that the wealthy\r\nmerchants there who dealt in it were known as the \"Virginia Dons,\" and\r\nto this day there is in the old port of Glasgow a Virginia Street.\r\n\r\nJames Dunlop, a cousin of Robert Peter, also had come from his home\r\nGarnkirke, near Glasgow, first to New York, then to George Town about\r\n1783 and established himself in this same lucrative exporting business.\r\nHe did a great deal of business in Dumfries, Virginia, near\r\nFredericksburg.\r\n\r\nThese old letters give a picture of the times:\r\n\r\n    George Town, December 15th, 1788.\r\n\r\n    Gentlemen:\r\n\r\n    Your favors of the 11th July duly received by Mr. Dunlop with the\r\n    black cloth, which I am afraid I shall soon have occasion for, my\r\n    old friend Mr. Heugh being now in a very dangerous way indeed, etc.\r\n\r\n    GEORGE WALKER.\r\n\r\nAndrew Heugh had been one of the Commissioners in the laying off of\r\nGeorge Town. He owned one of the very first lots on the water front and\r\nHigh Street.\r\n\r\nHere is another one of these letters:\r\n\r\n    George Town, August 8, 1788.\r\n\r\n    Gentlemen:\r\n\r\n    The quantity of tobacco planted this year in the neighborhood of\r\n    this place is vastly larger than ever was known. John Campbell and\r\n    J. Dunlop are very backward in buying with all cash, but as Colonel\r\n    Deakins is again in cash the price still keeps at a guinea ... from\r\n    these causes I would not be forward in recommending speculation in\r\n    the weed, especially as those of good information are holding off.\r\n\r\n    GEORGE WALKER.\r\n\r\nNo less a person than General Washington himself wrote in 1791 that\r\nGeorge Town ranked as the greatest tobacco market in Maryland, if not in\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nDuc de la Rochefoucault Liancourt, traveling in the United States in\r\n1795-'97, says that in 1791 tobacco exports from George Town were\r\n$314,864.00. They went even higher in 1792 and 1793, but in 1794 and the\r\nfollowing years decreased considerably, which was attributed to two\r\ncauses: a falling off in tobacco growing, and a diversion of the capital\r\nof the merchants to speculation in lots in the Federal City.\r\n\r\nA prominent firm in this same business of exporting tobacco was that of\r\nForrest, Stoddert, and Murdock, formed in 1783. Uriah Forrest was born\r\nin St. Mary's County, Maryland, in 1756. He served with distinction in\r\nthe Revolution, was wounded in the Battle of Germantown and lost a leg\r\nat the Battle of Brandywine.\r\n\r\nHe was a delegate in the Continental Congress and served in the third\r\nCongress from March 4, 1793 to November 8, 1794, when he resigned. He\r\nwas commissioned major-general in the Maryland Militia in 1795.\r\n\r\nAfter the war he went to London on business for the Government at his\r\nown expense, but returned to enter business with his old friend,\r\nBenjamin Stoddert.\r\n\r\nBorn in Charles County, Maryland, in 1751, Stoddert was of Scottish\r\nancestry, the son of Captain Thomas Stoddert who, while with the\r\nMaryland contingent, was killed in Braddock's defeat. Benjamin Stoddert\r\nhad joined the Continental Army as a captain of cavalry and was in\r\nactive service until the Battle of Brandywine where, after holding the\r\nrank of major, he was so severely wounded as to unfit him for active\r\nservice. He had seriously considered settling in either Baltimore or\r\nAlexandria, urged by friends in each of these cities, but decided that\r\nGeorge Town was a better venture.\r\n\r\nColonel John Murdock was already living in George Town where his father,\r\nWilliam Murdock, was in business.\r\n\r\nFrancis Lowndes also had a large warehouse, and John Laird was\r\nprosperous in this business, and as time went on, meant a great deal to\r\nGeorgetown. Colonel Deakins, Jr., was prominent, for on his tomb was\r\ninscribed: \"George Town, by the blow, has lost her most illustrious\r\npatron.\" He was only fifty-six when he died in 1798. In his youth, he\r\nhad done surveying with George Washington.\r\n\r\nHenry Threlkeld was born in Cumberland County, England, in 1716, came to\r\nAmerica and bought an estate of 1,000 acres known as Berleith, bordering\r\non the Potomac. It ran northward, and the present sites of Georgetown\r\nCollege and Convent are on part of this land. He seems to have continued\r\nto farm his estate, and died in 1781. His only child, John, became very\r\nprominent in all of the affairs of the town.\r\n\r\nJoseph Carlton, also in the tobacco business, who died in March, 1812,\r\nwhen only fifty-eight years old, had held the office of postmaster in\r\n1799.\r\n\r\nGeneral James Maccubbin Lingan, a tobacco shipper, who was the first\r\ncollector of the port ... \"1790 and before,\" had had a very remarkable\r\ncareer in the Revolution.\r\n\r\nColonel Charles Beatty owned a ferry which did a thriving business\r\nbetween the Virginia shore and the foot of Frederick Street at Water\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nEbenezer Dodge had come from Salem, Massachusetts, and built up a\r\nsuccessful coastwise trade with the East Indies, his younger brother,\r\nFrancis, coming in 1798, of whom I shall have a great deal to say in\r\nanother chapter.\r\n\r\nPeter Casanave was much in evidence in business deals.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Gannt was a prominent merchant; also, William King, whose name\r\nis still known in business here.\r\n\r\nAmong the lawyers were Philip Barton Key and Joseph Earle.\r\n\r\nDoctor Magruder is spoken of over and over again. He seems to have been\r\n\"the doctor\" at that time. Doctor Weems also had a good practice.\r\n\r\nFrom _The Virginia Gazette_ of January 14, 1775, is taken this note in\r\nregard to a project much in the minds of the business men of George Town\r\nat that time:\r\n\r\n    At a meeting of the Trustees for opening the navigation of the\r\n    Potomack River held in George Town December 1, 1774, Thomas\r\n    Johnson, Jr., Attorney at Law, Wm. Deakins, Adam Steuart, Thomas\r\n    Johns, Thomas Richardson, merchants of George Town, appointed to\r\n    hire slaves for cutting canals around the Falls of the River, etc.\r\n\r\nOf course, George Town, like every other town in the country at that\r\ntime, was peopled largely by negroes. Some owners hired out the ones\r\nthey themselves did not need, either for work of this kind or for\r\ndomestic service. A delightful story is told of how one of the\r\nshipowners sent a \"likely\" young negress back to Scotland on one of his\r\nvessels, as a present to his mother. Many weeks later when the vessel\r\nreturned, on it was Chloe with a note thanking \"my dear son\" for his\r\ngift, but saying, \"I have had her scrubbed and scrubbed, but as it is\r\nimpossible to remove the dirt and stain, I am returning her.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1788 Thomas Corcoran, who that year came to George Town from\r\nBaltimore, intended to go on to Richmond, but instead stayed and\r\nestablished a business in leather, says: \"There were then in harbor ten\r\nsquare-rigged vessels, two of them being ships and a small brig from\r\nAmsterdam taking in tobacco from a warehouse on Rock Creek.\" The mouth\r\nof the creek at that time was a bay, wide and deep, and as late as 1751\r\nthe tide ebbed and flowed as far up as the present P Street bridge.\r\n\r\nNear there stood the paper mill built about 1800 by Gustavus Scott and\r\nNicholas Lingan, and described in an old advertisement as being 120 feet\r\nlong, three stories high, the first story built of stone. Just beyond\r\nwas Parrott's Mill, called the George Town Wool and Cotton Manufactory.\r\nParrott also had a Rope Walk on the northern outskirts of the Town. A\r\nlittle farther north of Parrott's Mill at the bend of Rock Creek was\r\nLyon's Mill, said to have been built in 1780.\r\n\r\nNaturally all through these years during and after the Revolution there\r\nwas a great deal of unrest, and trade was much affected.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of an authentic letter from the celebrated Dr.\r\nFranklin to a friend in England on the subject of the first campaign\r\nmade by the British forces in America and, although not written from\r\nGeorgetown, it shows the state of mind of many people.\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir. I am to set out tomorrow for the camp and having heard of\r\n    this opportunity can only write a line to say that I am well and\r\n    hardy.\r\n\r\n    Tell our good friend--who sometimes has his doubts and despondencies\r\n    about our firmness that America is determined and unanimous, a very\r\n    few tories and place men excepted, who will probably soon export\r\n    themselves.\r\n\r\n    Britain, at the expense of 3 millions has killed 150 yankees this\r\n    campaign which is 20,000 pounds a head, and at Bunker's Hill she\r\n    gained one mile of ground, half of which she lost again by our\r\n    taking post on plowed hill. During the same time 60,000 children had\r\n    been born in America.\r\n\r\nAlso this letter, which James Dunlop received in New York shortly before\r\ncoming to Georgetown, gives, I think, a very vivid picture of both\r\npolitical and economic thinking of the time:\r\n\r\n    Glasgow\r\n\r\n    January 31, 1783\r\n\r\n    Mr. James Dunlop, Merchant, New York, c/o the Pacquet.\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n    This comes by the pacquet which will bring you the Preliminary\r\n    Articles of Peace which were signed at Paris on 20th and we had the\r\n    account here on the 27th at 8 in the morning which was very quick.\r\n    We have not yet seen the Articles, but we have reason to believe\r\n    upon the whole it is as reasonable as could well be expected unless\r\n    we had made another campaign in the West Indies with the Troops from\r\n    America and our present great superiority at sea. We had reason to\r\n    expect everything would have gone to our liking, and considering the\r\n    great quantity of West Indies and American produce now on hand\r\n    perhaps you will think we, as well as our neighbours, would had no\r\n    objections to another Campaign.\r\n\r\n    I have seen all your late letters, am sensible the news of Peace\r\n    after the purchase you have lately made, will give you much\r\n    uneasiness but the company are sensible you did it with a good\r\n    intention and except the idea of peace, your reasons for the\r\n    purchase were very good, however we thought that General Carletons\r\n    declaration to you that Negotiations for Peace were open and that in\r\n    the first place Britain declared the Independence of America, would\r\n    have alarmed you or at least prevented you from exceeding the\r\n    Company's limits so very much especially for so large a quantity. I\r\n    suppose what made you so very sanguine that we should have another\r\n    Campaign was the Rockingham party going out and Lord Shelbourne\r\n    coming and on his first appearance declaring against American\r\n    indenpendence, which speech deceived many here as well as with you. I\r\n    am happy to inform you the Ruby arrived four days ago which brought\r\n    us the 100 Hhds Tobacco without a farthing of Insurance which is\r\n    very luckie and will help to make the loss on the tobacco fall\r\n    season. We have not yet heard any account of the Favorite. We have\r\n    done 16 on the Tobacco on her and don't intend to do any more.\r\n\r\n    If this Tobacco turned out good in quality and no great quantity\r\n    comes home for six months I still flatter myself there will be no\r\n    great loss upon the Sales. There has been no sale of any kind these\r\n    five weeks past nor will not be till some time after we see the\r\n    Articles of Peace which we now expect in three or four days, as they\r\n    were to be laid before Parliment two days ago. I suppose in a short\r\n    time after the receipt of this you will be going to visit our old\r\n    friends in Virginia. It is very probable I may have the pleasure of\r\n    seeing you there in a few months and as America has gotten her\r\n    wishes I hope she will once more be a happy Country and we shall\r\n    enjoy the blessings of Peace with our old Acquaintance and Brethern\r\n    and I hope it will cement the friendship between the Mother and the\r\n    Daughter to the mutual advantage of both Countrys.\r\n\r\n    I had the pleasure of seeing your Sisters all week--several nights\r\n    at Mr. William Dunlop's.\r\n\r\n    Wishing you all the happiness and with compliments to all\r\n    acquaintance I am, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n    Your most humble servant\r\n\r\n    JAMES ANDERSON\r\n\r\nAlso in a letter from a young British Officer (also a Scotsman) who was\r\na military prisoner in a camp at Lancaster, Pennsylvania who was trying\r\nto get to Petersburg, Virginia to see his father who was there on\r\nbusiness from Glasgow, there is this addition.\r\n\r\n    P.S. I have this moment received a letter from Phila. informing me\r\n    of a passport being procured for my going to Virginia. I shall set\r\n    off immediately. Adieu.\r\n\r\nCan't you picture his excitement after many trials to at last get in\r\ntouch with his father!\r\n\r\nOn March 18, 1783 Archibald Govan sends two letters enclosed to a friend\r\nin New York to forward to Virginia \"by the safest, spediest conveyance.\r\nThere is probally now a post direct from New York through the\r\nContinent.\"\r\n\r\nIn these days ships approached George Town by way of the Western\r\nChannel, as it was called, on the far side of Analostan Island, where\r\nthe depth of the water was from twenty-seven to thirty-three feet--deep\r\nenough to admit the passage of an \"Indiaman.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington Parke Custis, the owner of Arlington, was much\r\ndisturbed when a causeway was built across from the island to the\r\nVirginia shore, and prophesied the filling of the channel and the end of\r\nGeorge Town as a port.\r\n\r\nSo up the creek to these mills for their produce, and up the great river\r\nto its wharves, piled high with hogsheads of tobacco came these ships\r\nand many more of which we have not the names:\r\n\r\nThe _Potomack Planter_, Captain James Buchanan, for London.\r\n\r\nThe brig _Brothers_.\r\n\r\nThe schooner _Betsey_, bringing rum, coffee, and chocolate.\r\n\r\nThe ships _Ritson_ and _Felicity_.\r\n\r\nThe sloops, _Lydia_ and _Betsey_, plying between George Town and New\r\nYork. These ships from the North were laden with whale oil to be used\r\nfor the lamps which, in 1810, were placed on the streets to \"enable the\r\ncitizens to go safely to and from evening service.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Columbia_ from Martinique, and the ship _Lydia_, Lemuel Toby,\r\nmaster, for London, which on September 6, 1792 had this advertisement\r\nin _The George Town Weekly Ledger_:\r\n\r\n    Will sail in twelve or fifteen days: such as may be desirous of\r\n    taking passage in said ship may depend on being genteelly\r\n    accommodated. For further particulars apply to Col. Wm. Deakins, or\r\n    the Captain on Board.\r\n\r\nOut beyond the northern limits of the Town, just opposite where Mount\r\nAlto Hospital now stands, high on a hill which has been dug away, stood\r\nin those days a tremendous oak tree which was used by the pilots coming\r\nup the river to guide them on their way. For a hundred years it stood,\r\nknown as Sailors' Oak, but like so many other things, has had to go in\r\nthe interest of Progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\n_The Taverns, Shops, and Schools_\r\n\r\n\r\nWith ships arriving and departing and the land travel passing from North\r\nto South and back again, besides the country gentlemen coming to town to\r\nsell their crops and tend to other business, there was need for many\r\ntaverns, and plenty of them there were in George Town.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. O. W. Holmes of the National Archives who has recently\r\nwritten a fine article on the Colonial Taverns of Georgetown for the\r\nColumbia Historical Society, which he read before the Society on January\r\n16, 1951, the earliest tavern of which there is record was kept by\r\nJoseph Belt who was granted a license by the newly created Frederick\r\nCounty Court in August, 1751 \"to keep a Public House of Entertainment at\r\nthe Mouth of Rock Creek.\"\r\n\r\nPreviously Thomas Odell had petitioned for such a \"Lyssance\" in 1747 to\r\nPrince George's County for one year--but we hear no more of him so are\r\nnot certain that he continued in business. But Joseph Belt did and in\r\nthe _Maryland Gazette_ (Annapolis) for March 19, 1752, is this\r\nannouncement:\r\n\r\n    Notice is hereby given that the Land appointed by Act of Assembly to\r\n    be laid out into a town, by the name of Georgetown, adjacent to the\r\n    warehouse at the Mouth of Rock Creek, in Frederick County, is\r\n    accordingly laid out, and the lots will be sold the 4th Monday in\r\n    March, being the 23 of the month at the House of Joseph Belt, living\r\n    in the said Town in ten of the Clock before noon.\r\n\r\n    Per order of the Commissioner\r\n    Alexander Beall, Cl.\r\n\r\nIn 1760 Mr. Belt bought two of the most desirable lots in town at the\r\nsoutheast corner of Water Street (Wisconsin Ave.) and Bridge (M) and\r\napparently built on the southernmost one of them a tavern where real\r\nestate sales took place frequently--and again in the _Maryland Gazette_\r\nfor September 19, 1771, is this insertion:\r\n\r\n    Frederick County, Sept. 8, 1771\r\n\r\n    The Subscriber continues to keep a House of Entertainment in George\r\n    Town, at the Kings Arms, and as he is provided with Good\r\n    Entertainment, Stabling, and Provender for Horses, would be obliged\r\n    to all Gentlemen travelling and others for their customs and they\r\n    may depend on kind usage, by their Most Humble Servant,\r\n\r\n    JOSEPH BELT\r\n\r\nSo it is quite possible that it was still here and that General\r\nBraddock's soldiers attracted by the name and sign stopped to slake\r\ntheir thirst before continuing their long march to the West.\r\n\r\nThis Joseph Belt appears to have been the nephew of Col. Joseph Belt,\r\nthe original patentee of Chevy Chase. He was a highly respectable man\r\nand well thought of.\r\n\r\nAnother tavern of that period was kept by John Orme who in his petition\r\nfor a license promised as did others of that period \"to keep Tavern in\r\nGeorge Town, to keep good Rules and Orders and not suffer the loose and\r\ndisorderly persons to Tipple, Game, or Commit other disorders or\r\nirregularities within his aforesaid House.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Maryland Gazette_ in September in 1760 is a notice of horse\r\nraces to be held at George Town, the horses \"to be Entered the Day\r\nbefore Running, with Messrs. Joseph Belt and John Orme in George Town.\"\r\n\r\nThe same notice again in 1761. I wonder where the races took place. John\r\nOrme was the son of the Rev. John Orme, a Presbyterian minister who\r\nserved as pastor at Upper Marlboro from 1720 until he died in 1758.\r\n\r\nHis tavern was apparently on the northeast corner of the present M\r\nStreet and Wisconsin Avenue, where the Farmers and Mechanics Branch of\r\nRiggs Bank now stands.\r\n\r\nIn the _Maryland Gazette_ of September 29, 1768, Thomas Belt offers for\r\nsale \"At the house of Mr. John Orme, in George Town ... part of a Tract\r\nof Land, called Chevy Chace, containing 200 and 300 acres about 5 miles\r\nfrom said Town.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the death of John Orme in 1772 his widow inserted a notice in the\r\npaper--and added, \"N. B. The Executrix will continue to keep Tavern for\r\nready money only. Lucy Orme.\"\r\n\r\nBut they were not left in straightened circumstances, and the three Orme\r\ndaughters married very well.\r\n\r\nThere is mention of a Cornelius Davies and also of John Wise keeping\r\ntavern for short periods. This may have been the same John Wise who\r\nlater opened a tavern in Alexandria which became the well-known Gadsby's\r\nTavern.\r\n\r\nAlso there was Christian Boncer, during the Revolution who like John\r\nOrme, before him, was likewise running a ferry over the Potomac.\r\n\r\nAnd then in October, 1779, John Beall is referred to as occupying the\r\nhome where Joseph Belt formerly kept tavern.\r\n\r\nIn November 1782, Mr. Beall announced that he was moving \"into the large\r\nStone House near the Square, the best calculated house in town for\r\nentertaining Gentlemen, Travellers, and Others.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then Mr. Ignatius Simpson moved into the \"House formerly occupied by\r\nMr. John Beall,\" and the next year, 1783, the Commissioners record\r\nmeeting at the \"House of Mr. Ignatius Simpson.\" And in 1784 Mr. Simpson\r\nhad no license issued and the Commissioners met \"at the House of Mr.\r\nJohn Suter.\" It would seem that this same house had been a tavern ever\r\nsince Joseph Belt built a house there.\r\n\r\nFrom then on Suter's Tavern became the best-known meeting place in town\r\nand even the birthplace of the District of Columbia for there was signed\r\nthe agreement with the proprietors of the land for the Federal City.\r\n\r\nChristian Hines says in his little book _Early Recollections of\r\nWashington_ that Suter's Tavern was a one-story frame and stood on High\r\nStreet, between Bridge and Water Streets, a little east of the canal\r\nbridge. Christian Hines as a youth of fifteen was an apprentice living\r\nwith the Green family just across the street from this building, and\r\nalthough he wrote his Recollections when he was an old man, it is a\r\nwell-known fact that old people remember happenings of their youth\r\nbetter than those of last month or last week.\r\n\r\nIt was a rather small building, a story and a half high, according to an\r\nold print, and had a large Inn Yard at the side and back for the\r\naccommodation of the coaches, wagons and steeds of its patrons.\r\n\r\nJohn Suter was a Scotsman who had been living out in Montgomery County\r\nbut apparently from 1784 until his death in 1794 his tavern was a very\r\nbusy place. Here it was that General Washington stayed when he was\r\npassing through.\r\n\r\nThis notice shows John Suter's standing in the community:\r\n\r\n    Georgetown, August 21, 1790\r\n\r\n    All persons having claims against the Estate of John Cornne,\r\n    deceased, are desired to bring them in legally attested. Those\r\n    indebted to make speedy payment to\r\n\r\n    John Suter, Administrator\r\n\r\nFrom the _Times and Potowmack Packet_:\r\n\r\n    Meeting at Mr. Suter's Tavern in George Town, 14 December, 1790, for\r\n    erecting a New Warehouse contiguous to the Old Inspection on Col.\r\n    Normand Bruce's property in George Town.\r\n\r\n    Edward Burgess\r\n    Bernard O'Neill\r\n\r\n    For Sale. On Monday the 3d of January next will be offered for sale\r\n    at the House of Mr. John Suter in George Town that Lot or _Acre of\r\n    Ground_ whereon the _Old_ Warehouse formerly stood.... A good title\r\n    will be given agreeably to the last Will and Testament of Thomas\r\n    Hamilton deceased of Prince Georges County.\r\n\r\n    December 11, 1790              Andrew Hamilton\r\n\r\nThen there is this little item from the same paper:\r\n\r\n    The subscriber has for sale, by the Box, a small supply of fresh\r\n    Lisbon LEMONS, imported in the Potomack Planter.\r\n\r\n    Capt. James Buchanan\r\n    George Town Sept. 7, 1790      John Suter\r\n\r\nFresh fruit was evidently an event.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. John Suter's death, his son John Suter, Jr., took over the\r\ntavern and ran it until he moved to the Union Tavern.\r\n\r\nIt had been built in 1796 at a cost of $16,000, according to a newspaper\r\nof the day advertising it for sale: \"It is a handsome substantial brick\r\nbuilding of three stories, fronting 60 ft. on the most public street in\r\ntown (Bridge Street), and running back 63 ft. on a wide and commodious\r\nstreet (Washington). The house is admirably calculated for a tavern.\"\r\nThe advertisement tells the number and size of the rooms, cellars,\r\npassages and cross passages, and ends thus: \"There are stables\r\nsufficient for the accommodation of 50 horses with commodious sheds for\r\ncarriages ... and not twenty yards from the kitchen is a copious and\r\nnever failing spring of most excellent running water.\" The main building\r\ndiffered but little from others, but north of this and running north\r\nupon Washington Street to the next street, was a wing, one or two\r\nstories high, and one room deep, the doors opening into a covered\r\ncorridor supported by brick arches, beyond which was a large courtyard\r\npaved with stone. The rooms along this corridor were occupied entirely\r\nby gentlemen, many being planters from the lower river counties of\r\nVirginia and Maryland. They came up on the old _Salem_, which made\r\nweekly trips and stopped at all the river landings. On the opposite side\r\nof the courtyard was a large building in which was a fine ballroom known\r\nas Pompean Hall. This room must have been used for the following event:\r\n\r\n    Birthnight Ball. The Ladies and Gentlemen of George Town and its\r\n    vicinity are informed that there will be a Ball at the Union Tavern\r\n    on Friday the 22nd instant (Feb. 22, 1799), in honor of\r\n    Lieutenant-General George Washington. At request of the Managers.\r\n    John Suter, Jr.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this very historic ball, the George Town Assemblies used\r\nto be held here. Mrs. William Thornton has recorded in her diary that on\r\nMonday, January 1st, 1810:\r\n\r\n    A very crowded assembly at the presidents. We staid about two hours.\r\n    President and Lady went to Georgetown Assembly. Chariot broke at\r\n    night.\r\n\r\nThese august guests at the assembly were, of course, James Madison and\r\nthe charming Dolly.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Suter opened the Union Tavern in March, 1799, Francis Kearns\r\nput this notice in the paper:\r\n\r\n    Sign of the Ship. The subscriber begs leave to inform his friends\r\n    and the public that he has rented the tavern formerly occupied by\r\n    Mr. Suter, called The Fountain Inn, where he has all kinds of\r\n    liquors accounted necessary for travellers. Add to this a well of\r\n    water not to be surpassed in Town. I am determined to spare no pains\r\n    to render this situation agreeable and flatter myself from a desire\r\n    to please that I shall meet with encouragement. I also will\r\n    accomodate 6 or 8 gentlemen boarders on reasonable terms. A livery\r\n    stable will be kept for a few horses.\r\n\r\n    June 31, 1800   Francis Kearns\r\n\r\nFrancis Kearns having taken over the Union Tavern from John Suter, Jr.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1802 this building changed hands, for in _The Washington\r\nFederalist_ is the announcement of reopening, and assurance of best\r\nliquors, and begins: \"Anchor Tavern and Oyster House (late the Fountain\r\nInn), George Pitt, Proprietor of former Eagle Tavern.\"\r\n\r\nThen there was the City Tavern, kept by Charles McLaughlin. Benjamin\r\nLacy rented two brick houses from Charles Beatty on Water Street and\r\ncalled his The Sailors' Tavern. John Tennally had a tavern (from him\r\ncame the name of Tennally Town). Joseph Semmes's Tavern at the Sign of\r\nthe Indian King, was very well known. It seems to have moved several\r\ntimes. In advertisements for houses for rent or for sale, they seemed\r\nalways to be next door to or across the street from Semmes's Tavern or\r\nDr. Magruder's.\r\n\r\nFrom _The Museum_, January 1, 1802:\r\n\r\n    The Subscriber begs leave to inform his friends and the public that\r\n    he has removed from his late dwelling in the main street to that\r\n    large and commodious three story new BRICK BUILDING, Sign of the\r\n    Indian King, adjoining the Bank of Columbia, which he has fitted up\r\n    at considerable expense for the accomodation of travellers. He\r\n    embraces this opportunity of returning his grateful thanks to those\r\n    gentlemen who have heretofore favored him with their custom and\r\n    hopes by a faithful discharge of his duty to merit the countenance\r\n    and support of the public.\r\n\r\n    George Town,    Joseph Semmes\r\n\r\n_The Museum_, 28th of January, 1802:\r\n\r\n    To be sold at Union Tavern, The BRICK HOUSE formerly occupied as a\r\n    Tavern by Mr. Semmes.\r\n\r\n    Philip Barton Key\r\n    William Thornton\r\n\r\nDo you suppose that Mr. Semmes had his tavern in this place for only one\r\nmonth?\r\n\r\nJane White advertises that she intends to continue her \"house of\r\nentertainment\" (Mrs. White's Tavern) on a more enlarged plan, asks for\r\nsettlement of debts. Nov. 27, 1790.\r\n\r\nGeorge Stevens announces he has removed to the place lately occupied by\r\nMr. William King, Merchant, of this place (the house where Col. William\r\nDeakins has lived for many years past).\r\n\r\nThere are still, to this day, William Kings in business in Georgetown.\r\n\r\nMr. George Stevens also advertises:\r\n\r\n    Any gentleman wanting to buy Ginseng may by giving a few days notice\r\n    find a supply from said Stevens from One to Five Thousand weight.\r\n\r\nAnd this from the _Times and Potowmack Packet_, April 21, 1790:\r\n\r\n    Charles Fierer & Co.\r\n\r\n    Gentlemen may have their Coats of Arms or other devices cut on Glass\r\n    and fancy pieces executed by sending their orders.\r\n\r\nAlso these items:\r\n\r\n    Doctors Beatty and Martin have just received from Philadelphia and\r\n    Baltimore: Opium, Mercury, Jolap, Ipecacoanha, Nitre, Glanker Salts,\r\n    Gum Kino, Columbo root, assorted vials, carts, etc. Red and other\r\n    Bark.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Magruder has lately received an elegant supply of most\r\n    fashionable paper hangings--and his usual Assortment of Drugs and\r\n    Medicines.\r\n\r\nHe catered to various tastes of his patrons:\r\n\r\n    Dr. Cozens has just opened a general assortment of Drugs and\r\n    Medicines in the house formerly occupied by Mr. Andrew McDonald in\r\n    Water Street, opposite to Mr. James King's Wharf, which he means to\r\n    sell at a moderate price. He likewise offers his services to the\r\n    public as a practitioner of physic, surgery and midwifery. Mrs.\r\n    Cozens also informs the ladies that she practices Midwifery and from\r\n    her experience and universal success she flatters herself she shall\r\n    give satisfaction to all those who favor her with their commands.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gardette, Dentist, respectfully informs the public that he is\r\n    arrived in George Town, where he proposes staying two weeks or\r\n    thereabouts. He has taken lodgings at Mr. Semmes' Tavern.\r\n\r\nAnother poor soul who was in trouble inserted this advertisement:\r\n\r\n    It is terrible to my feelings, but I am compelled to give notice\r\n    that I intend petitioning the next General Assembly for an act of\r\n    Insolvency in my favor.\r\n\r\nA few months later he advertised thus:\r\n\r\n    Having taken the house in this place lately occupied by Mr. James\r\n    Clagett, between the College and the River, a pleasant and healthy\r\n    situation, I will take four or five boys as boarders at the usual\r\n    rates, paid quarterly.\r\n\r\nSo let us hope he got \"on his feet\" again.\r\n\r\nJohn Stevens, merchant, advertised himself thusly:\r\n\r\n   My weights are good, my measures just,\r\n   My friends I am too poor to trust.     July 15, 1780.\r\n\r\nApparently they had plenty of newspapers. In 1789 _The Times and\r\nPotowmack Packet_; in 1790 _The Weekly Ledger_ (an appropriate name for\r\nthis town of counting houses); in 1796 _The Sentinel of Liberty_, a more\r\nhigh-flown name; in 1801, _The Museum_, and a great many more as time\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\nThe first bank was the old Bank of Columbia, organized in 1793. Then,\r\nthere was the Union Bank. I have seen a great many of its checks,\r\nsmaller than the ones of today and very simply printed.\r\n\r\nBusiness notes in those days were written on any scrap of paper,\r\napparently. Many that I have seen had torn edges, but always the writing\r\nwas regular and even, if sometimes hard to read. Very often it looked\r\nlike copperplate engraving. The English pound was used as late as 1796.\r\n\r\nPlenty of schools there seem to have been. One famous man (he was\r\nWilliam Wirt, the author of _The British Spy_ and Attorney-General of\r\nthe United States for twelve years under James Monroe and John Quincy\r\nAdams) was sent to George Town for his early training, and has written\r\nthus: \"In 1779 I was sent to George Town, eight miles from Bladensburg\r\nto school, a classical academy kept by Mr. Rogers. I was placed at\r\nboarding with the family of Mr. Schoofield, a member of the Society of\r\nFriends.... I passed one winter in George Town and remember seeing a\r\nlong line of wagons cross the river on the ice, attached to troops going\r\nSouth.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Kirk, an Irish gentleman, kept a school first on Washington\r\n(30th) Street, later at High (Wisconsin Avenue) and Cherry Streets.\r\nReverend Addison Belt, of Princeton, had a school on Gay (N) Street,\r\nbetween Congress (31st) and Washington (30th) Streets. Christian Hines\r\nsays: \"In 1798 I went to school to a man named Richmond who kept school\r\nin a small brick house attached to the house of Reverend David Wiley,\r\ngraduate of Nassau Hall, who had come in 1802 from Northumberland on the\r\nSusquehanna. He was a better mathematical than classical teacher. He was\r\nmayor, librarian, merchant, teacher, preacher and keeper of the post\r\noffice at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Smith and Mrs. Wiley advertised their \"Boarding School for Young\r\nLadies at George Town in the Vicinity of Washington.\" In the same year\r\nE. Phillips had \"A School for Young Ladies on the north side of Bridge\r\nStreet, nearly opposite the Printing Office.\" There were several\r\nteachers of French who advertised in the paper; Monsieur A. L.\r\nJancerez, Monsieur Caille, \"a French gentleman wishes to teach drawing,\r\netc.\" To supply all these schools was \"John March, Stationer and\r\nBookseller, next door to Mr. Semmes's Tavern.\"\r\n\r\nAnd you see they could buy pretty baubles and delectable foods, for\r\nDinsmore and Francis advertise their \"New Grocery, Wine and Liquor\r\nStore, nearly opposite Burnet and Rigden's, Watchmakers and Jewelers.\"\r\nAnother well-known merchant said his new line of spring clothing had\r\njust arrived. And John Dabney \"had received and had for sale at his\r\ncabinet and chair factory a large quantity of Windsor chairs.\" West\r\nalong Bridge Street, before 1790, William Eaton had \"mahogany ware,\r\nchairs and tables, beds, etc., finished and unfinished.\" Another\r\ncabinet-maker was Mr. Schultz. James Welsh, cabinet-maker from London,\r\nopened a shop in 1790 and advertised for an apprentice. And there was a\r\nwell-known silversmith, for S. Kirk and Sons, of Baltimore, have\r\nidentified a tea service as having been made by Charles C. Burnett, who\r\nworked as early as 1793. Another silversmith who had a shop on Bridge\r\n(M) Street in 1833 was R. H. L. Villard.\r\n\r\n    Glass Store. The subscribers have opened and have for sale at their\r\n    house next door to Captain Richard Johns a complete assortment of\r\n    Window and Hollow Glass Ware, manufactured in this State and equal\r\n    in quality and cheaper than that imported from Europe.\r\n\r\n    Charles Frierer and Co., 1790\r\n\r\nThomas Beatty and Company called their store \"The Sign of the Golden\r\nFan.\"\r\n\r\n    Manufactory of Tobacco. Henry Brand & Co. Respectfully inform the\r\n    Public that they have removed from New York to this Town.\r\n\r\n    George Town Academy. Madame de la Marche has for sale waters for\r\n    sore eyes and various salves.\r\n\r\nThere were public pumps here and there for common use, but many\r\nhouseholders had springs or cisterns.\r\n\r\nIn 1803 the first fire engine was purchased. Every house owner was\r\nobliged to have as many leather fire buckets kept in the house as there\r\nwere stories to his home, to contain not less than two and a half\r\ngallons of water each. The little oval metal placques one sees now and\r\nthen affixed to houses in Georgetown were, in those days, put only on\r\nthe houses of the members of the volunteer companies to denote that\r\n\"here lives a fireman.\" Later, in 1817, _The Vigilant_, a new fire\r\nengine, was bought. Its house is still on High Street, just below\r\nBridge. Set in the wall down near the pavement is a stone with this\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n         BUSH\r\n    THE OLD FIRE DOG\r\n     DIED OF POISON\r\n     JULY 5TH, 1869\r\n        R. I. P.\r\n\r\nSomeone who remembers him tells me that he was a collie, and that he\r\nwent to every fire along with the engine. I think the men whose\r\ncompanion he was, and who evidently loved him when they inscribed the\r\n\"R. I. P.,\" must have believed, as I do, that like the Jim in the poem\r\nof that name by Nancy Byrd Turner, he would meet them joyously \"on the\r\nother side.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the fire engines in those days--1817, I mean--were drawn by\r\nhand, and the old bucket-passing system was in vogue.\r\n\r\nFarther uptown, on the corner of Gay and Market Streets, was the home\r\nof The Potomac Fire Engine Company. There was great jealousy between the\r\ntwo. While the fire was raging, both worked together beautifully, but as\r\nsoon as it was over, there was usually a fight.\r\n\r\nSouth of the canal on High Street stood the Debtors' Prison. This was\r\nthe only prison in the lower part of Montgomery County, although the\r\ncounty court was held at Rockville, and there the cases were tried. At\r\none time the town clerk of George Town got tangled up in his money\r\nmatters and was placed in this prison where he languished until his\r\nfriends made good his debts. A report was made to the Town Council that\r\nhe could not perform his duties because he was in jail! Nothing now\r\nremains but a part of the old stone wall.\r\n\r\nHere is a description of some of the houses offered for sale:\r\n\r\n    Together or separate, 2 handsome dwelling houses, situated in George\r\n    Town on Potomack, they contain 5 rooms with fire place, four bed\r\n    chambers, two closets, and have two handsome piazzas. A kitchen near\r\n    the house, a bake house, two rooms for domestics, a stable, coach\r\n    house, a beautiful (falling) garden, ornamented with terraces, well\r\n    grassed, a large fish pond, a well and a spring of water, 150 young\r\n    fruit trees, the whole finished and done in the neatest manner under\r\n    a handsome and excellent enclosure containing three lots and a half,\r\n    extending 170 ft. on Fayette Street and 192 on Third Street. Apply\r\n    to John Threlkeld.\r\n\r\nHere is one of the business places advertised:\r\n\r\n    The warehouse and wharf on Water Street, lately occupied by the\r\n    Naval Agent (this was in 1802). There are four floors in this house,\r\n    with a room on the second and third with a fire place in each, one\r\n    intended for a compting room and the other for a lodging room.\r\n\r\n    W. S. Chandler.\r\n\r\nEvidently a clerk had to sleep on the premises as guard.\r\n\r\nThere were architects and builders to put up these fine and commodious\r\nhouses, for these advertisements appear:\r\n\r\n    William Lovering, Architect and General Builder--Begs leave to\r\n    inform his friends and the public, that he has removed from the City\r\n    of Washington to Gay Street, the next street above the Union Tavern\r\n    in George Town, where he palns to estimate all manner of buildings,\r\n    either with materials and labor, or labor only. Specimens of\r\n    buildings suitable for the obtuse or acute angles of the streets in\r\n    the City of Washington may be seen at his home. May 1, 1800.\r\n\r\n    Henry Carlile, Architect, Carpenter and Joiner. Respectfully informs\r\n    his friends and the Public in general, that he proposes to undertake\r\n    all kinds of buildings, as formerly he hath done in Europe and this\r\n    country; on the lowest terms, with or without material, as he has\r\n    learned the theory under the first architects in Europe, also\r\n    practice in first buildings there, and hath finished elegant\r\n    buildings in Europe, with and without materials, and in this country\r\n    hath always had the good fortune of having the patronage and\r\n    friendship of his employees, and hopes by attention to please and to\r\n    execute, that he will meet with the encouragement of a generous\r\n    public. He also begs leave to return his sincere thanks to his\r\n    worthy employers in this Town and Country, for the encouragement he\r\n    hath met with since coming to this Town, and assures them nothing\r\n    shall be wanting on his part to merit a continuance of their favors.\r\n\r\n    George Town, September 8, 1790.\r\n\r\n    Wm. Pancost--Architect and Carpenter, can by the asistance of David\r\n    Willers, pump maker, late from Philadelphia, serve the public by\r\n    supplying them with pumps, cove logs or girders, for any purpose on\r\n    the shortest notice.\r\n\r\n    George Town, near the Lower Ware Houses, Jan. 29, 1799.\r\n\r\nThen in 1800, James Hoban, who was the architect and builder of the\r\nPresident's House, put this in a paper:\r\n\r\n    $2.00 per day will be given for good carpenters and joiners, at the\r\n    President's House and in proportion for those less skilful, to be\r\n    paid daily or weekly, as may be required.\r\n\r\nImagine! Now when the White House is being rebuilt hiring \"good\r\ncarpenters and joiners for $2.00 per day!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\n_The Streets of George Town and Some of the Happenings_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe houses had no numbers, but the streets had descriptive names. Along\r\nthe river, Wapping, changing to The Keys and East to West Landing where\r\nall the busy loading and unloading of vessels took place. Just above\r\nthere running west off Water Street for a short distance was Cherry Lane\r\n(now Grace Street). What a pretty name! Once a fashionable neighborhood,\r\nlater on a slum.\r\n\r\nRunning north and south there was first Fishing Lane which became East\r\nLane and finally settled down to Congress Street and is now\r\nTwenty-first.\r\n\r\nThen the Main Street up from the ferry, called Water Street until it got\r\nto Bridge running east and west where was the Square, also called the\r\nCenter of the Town. Then Water Street became High and Bridge continued\r\non its way as the Falls Street--both names typical, as one was climbing\r\na hill and the other was the road to The Little Falls. Duck Lane became\r\nMarket (33rd) Street; Bridge (M) Street; Frederick (34th) Street, for it\r\nwas the road out to Frederick Town, forty miles away; Potomac Street,\r\nfor the river; Fayette Street, certainly named in honor of the Marquis,\r\nbut in that age of young democracy, de la was dropped from de la\r\nFayette. Then there was Montgomery (28th) Street, Greene (29th) Street,\r\nand Washington (30th) Street, all named for Generals of the Revolution.\r\nRunning the other way were Gay, Dunbarton, Beall, West, Stoddert, this,\r\nfor a long time was known as Back Street. West of High Street (Wisconsin\r\nAvenue) the streets became First, Second, Third, etc. Twenty-seventh\r\nStreet, after being New Street for one block and Mill Street for\r\nanother, finally was named for President Monroe. Madison had a street\r\nnamed for him too, but it was so far out, about 9th, in the far western\r\ncorner, that it never amounted to much.\r\n\r\nBut the street that intrigues me most is Gay. There were two of them for\r\na while, the one that is now N, and another, way up near the college,\r\nwhich was renamed in honor of General Lingan, after his tragic death.\r\nWho was Gay Street named for? It wasn't a local celebrity, for Baltimore\r\nalso had a Gay Street, still has, way down in its old section. There was\r\nsomebody the people of that generation admired and wished to\r\ncommemorate.\r\n\r\nCould it possibly have been the English poet, John Gay, (1685-1732)\r\nwhose best known piece \"The Beggar's Opera\" was said to have made \"The\r\nRich gay and Gay rich\"? He was buried in Westminster Abbey. His epitaph\r\nwas by Alexander Pope, followed by Gay's own mocking couplet, \"Life is a\r\njest, and all things show it. I thought so once and now I know it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Beggar's Opera for a time drove Italian Opera off the English stage\r\n(1728) by its caricature of Sir Robert Walpole, Prime Minister of George\r\nII. These people were British subjects, you know, when these streets\r\nwere named.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in these quaint little streets in the early days before 1800,\r\nin one of these little brick houses, two stories with dormer windows,\r\nwhich the architects nowadays call the George Town Type, lived a couple\r\nnamed McDonald who had marital difficulties, for in an old newspaper is\r\nthis advertisement:\r\n\r\n    Whereas my wife, Mary McDonald, has left me without any just cause\r\n    or impediment. She is about fifty years of age, lame in her right\r\n    leg and snivels a little. It is supposed she went off with one\r\n    Robert Joiner, an ill-looking fellow. If she returns to the arms of\r\n    her disconsolate husband, she shall be received and no questions\r\n    asked.\r\n\r\nThere was another advertisement:\r\n\r\n    Alexander McDonald, taylor, removed from Bridge Street to High\r\n    Street, two or three gentlemen can be accomodated with board and\r\n    lodging.\r\n\r\nI wonder if Robert Joiner, with whom Mary eloped, was one of those two\r\nor three gentlemen, and what fascination she had that was strong enough\r\nto overcome all those physical disabilities her \"disconsolate husband\"\r\nenumerated!\r\n\r\nA man in Boston wanted a wife, and had his advertisement copied from\r\n_The Boston Sentinel_ into a George Town newspaper:\r\n\r\n    Wanted--A wife: Enquire of the Printer. April 23, 1801. Be pleased\r\n    to inform applicants, that the advertiser wishes the lady to be\r\n    neither too old nor too young. Taking 25 for a central point, she\r\n    must not be more than 7 years distant either way. If of a sulky or\r\n    fretful disposition; if sluttish, lazy, proud, ostentatious or\r\n    deceitful, or of an ill state of health, she must have a pretty\r\n    large share of property to recommend her. If on the contrary, she be\r\n    of a cheerful, contented temper; of affable manners and benevolent\r\n    to the poor; if in the habit of being attentive to her household\r\n    when business commands attention, and gay and careless when pleasure\r\n    is the pursuit; and of sound health and good constitution (for such\r\n    only can produce strong and vigorous children), she need not\r\n    possess a cent. If well-read, so much the better, provided she is\r\n    not too fond of her book to neglect overseeing her affairs and\r\n    suffering the hole in her stocking to go unmended. She must not be a\r\n    pedant or a scold but must know enough of books to distinguish\r\n    between a volume of history and a novel; and have sufficient spirit\r\n    to prevent being imposed upon. Communication addressed to A. B. and\r\n    left at the composing room, if originating in honorable intentions\r\n    will be attended to with secrecy, honor and punctuality, and should\r\n    the interview succeed, the advertiser will faithfully describe his\r\n    situation and prospects.\r\n\r\nWas this paragon discovered in old George Town and taken to Boston for\r\nkeeps? No one knows.\r\n\r\nBut this might easily have been so, as witness these advertisements of\r\nthe plays being shown in George Town in 1790, for on July 21 this\r\nappears: \"The Theatre of this Town was opened by Mr. McGrath's Company\r\nof Comedians, with the celebrated comedy The Miser. This Company is by\r\nfar the best that ever visited this town.\" Then on August 12 there was\r\n\"The Beggars Opera and A Comedy of two acts, Barnaby Brittle or a Wife\r\nat her Wits End. Also in August Mr. McGrath's Company of Comedians gave\r\nThe Tragedy of Douglas and Garrick's Comedy of Two Acts called The Lying\r\nValet.\"\r\n\r\n    The curtain will rise at 7 o'clock Tickets at three quarters of a\r\n    dollar each to be had at Mr. Suter's and Mrs. White's Taverns and at\r\n    this Printing Office.\r\n\r\nAnother evening will be presented the \"Tragedy of Jane Shore. Between\r\nthe play and the farce a humorous dissertation of Jealousy to be\r\ndelivered by Mr. McGrath to which will be added a farce called Cross\r\nPurposes, or Which is the Man. The doors to be opened at half past five\r\nand the curtain to rise at half past six.\"\r\n\r\nFor attendance at these performances and other social events, the ladies\r\nand gentlemen of George Town were naturally interested in this\r\nadvertisement in the paper:\r\n\r\n    BY FASHIONS WE LIVE\r\n\r\n    JOHN JONES\r\n\r\n    Hair dresser for Ladies and Gentlemen. Begs leave to inform Ladies\r\n    and Gentlemen of George Town and its vicinage that he intends\r\n    carrying on his profession in all its different branches and\r\n    fashions; he also carries on the Cushion, Perriwig, Curls, Braids,\r\n    false curls and Gentlemen's Bandoe making. The highest price given\r\n    for human hair.\r\n\r\nGeorge Town, at this time, was even favored by the presence of one of\r\nthe greatest portrait painters of his time, Gilbert Stuart. About 1803\r\nhe spent two years here. He painted Jefferson and the men who followed\r\nhim in the Presidency up through John Quincy Adams. He had, of course,\r\npreviously been much at Mount Vernon while doing his famous portraits of\r\nGeneral Washington. It is said that Washington was the only person in\r\nwhose presence Stuart was ever embarrassed.\r\n\r\nThere were drawing teachers and dancing masters. \"Mr. Carle, dancing\r\nmaster, may be spoke with on school days at Mrs. White's Tavern.\"\r\n\"Dancing School of J. B. Duclaviacq at his dancing room back of Mr.\r\nTurner's Counting House.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was one of these two which advertised, \"A night\r\nDancing-School for the Reception of Gentlemen who are not at leisure to\r\nattend in the Day-time; will be kept the evenings of the School days;\r\nThe Price to each Scholar will be Four dollars. A subscription is lodged\r\nwith Mr. Peter Casanave.\"\r\n\r\nGaming at cards at private balls and parties and toddy at dinner date\r\nback to the earliest knowledge of society in this vicinity. Card\r\nplaying, horse-racing and other sports were fashionable and popular and\r\nhad not abated in 1800 when the Government came.\r\n\r\nIn chronicles of Sir Augustus Foster, the British Minister in 1805 he\r\nnotes the balls in Georgetown \"Cards for everybody, loo for the\r\ngirls--brag for the men.\"\r\n\r\nBut all was not play, for in the _Times_ and _Potowmack Packet_ is this\r\nnewsnote:\r\n\r\n    On the 13th inst. a daughter of Mr. Aaron Haynes of this town, a\r\n    young miss in the tenth year of her age, spun 50 knots of good linen\r\n    yarn, from sun-rise to sunset. An example of industry, highly\r\n    honorable to herself and well worthy of imitation.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of youth here is an interesting item:\r\n\r\n    This day were baptized three male children (the uncommon gift of\r\n    Providence at one birth) by the names of George Washington, John\r\n    Adams, Benjamin Franklin.\r\n\r\nThen this sad and interesting advertisement:\r\n\r\n    With regret and shame the subscriber finds himself under the\r\n    necessity of advertising his wife. Although it is practised by some\r\n    white people, yet he, though black, blushes at the thought of\r\n    declaring to the world that his wife has run away. But disagreeable\r\n    as it is, he does by these presents make known that Lucy, his wife,\r\n    has eloped from his bed and board and forbids all persons harbouring\r\n    or trusting her, as he will pay no debts of her contracting after\r\n    this date.\r\n\r\n    Prince Hull.\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 1790 there was this announcement in the newspaper:\r\n\r\n    The gentlemen who have subscribed to celebrate the Anniversary of\r\n    American Independency will be pleased to attend at Mrs. White's\r\n    Tavern at Four O' clock tomorrow afternoon to choose Managers to\r\n    regulate the proceedings of that day.\r\n\r\nScheme of a Lottery:\r\n\r\n    To raise the sum of One Thousand Five Hundred and Nine Dollars for\r\n    the purpose of finishing the Church between George Town and\r\n    Bladensburgh, called Rock Creek Church.\r\n\r\n    All prizes not demanded in six months after the drawing, will be\r\n    deemed generous contributions.\r\n\r\n    3000 Tickets at Two dollars each.\r\n\r\n    As the above is laudable it is expected that it will meet with\r\n    approbation and support of the public. As soon as the tickets are\r\n    sold the drawing will commence at Mr. John Suter's at George Town\r\n    and the Prizes paid immediately thereafter on application to Thomas\r\n    Beall Treasurer, in specie.\r\n\r\n    MANAGERS\r\n\r\n    Col.

Mr.\r\n    Semmes' at George Town at 5.\r\n\r\nThere were also stages going out to Rockville and to Frederick.\r\n\r\nIn later years there was a conveyance running to Rockville spoken of as\r\n\"The Hack.\"\r\n\r\nThe license tax list discriminated in license value of one-horse chaise\r\nand two-wheel coach.\r\n\r\nThis thriving town had of course to be regulated and governed, and there\r\nare copies in existence of the ordinances and by-laws for making it safe\r\nand agreeable. One passed on the 20th November 1791, related to \"the\r\ngoing at large of geese and swine\" and makes it \"lawful to kill any such\r\nand give notice to the Mayor or one of the Aldermen, the offender to be\r\nsent to the public market house where the owner may claim within four\r\nhours, or if no claim in four hours, the finder take and apply to proper\r\nuse. All goats running at large shall be forfeited to who ever shall\r\ntake them up.\"\r\n\r\nAlso on August 4, 1795 an ordinance relating to garbage, glass bottles,\r\nor oyster shells in quantity 30 shillings fine. We are still having\r\ntrouble keeping Georgetown neat and clean.\r\n\r\nAnd they had trouble about speeding then as now, for there was passed an\r\nordinance August 4, 1795 \"that any person who shall by galloping, or\r\notherwise force at an improper speed any Horse, Mare, or Gelding, shall\r\nif a free man, forfeit and pay for every such offence the sum of 15\r\nshillings current money; if an apprentice, servant or a slave the\r\nmaster or the mistress shall forfeit and pay the sum of 7 shillings and\r\nsixpence.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in 1807 they passed an ordinance to \"more effectually diminish the\r\nnumber of dogs in Gerogetown as they have become a public nuisance; on\r\nthe first dog of the male kind owned by any one person, $1; on the\r\nsecond, $2; and on all over two, owned by the same person, $5; and on\r\nthe first of the female kind, $2; on the second, $4; and on all dogs of\r\nthe female kind over and above two, owned by the same person, $10.\"\r\n\r\nThen they passed an ordinance, \"that after the first day of May next no\r\nslave shall be permitted to sell any article whatever (other than fruit)\r\non the Sabboth.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1811 the Mayor was ordered to appoint and hire eight men of good\r\ncharacter to keep a night watch at the rate of $150 per annum, one of\r\nthem to act as Captain at the rate of $250.\r\n\r\nThey probably officiated at these events.\r\n\r\n    Ordinance passed 10th October 1796.\r\n\r\n    Whereas many respectable inhabitants of Georgetown have complained\r\n    that they suffer great inconvenience from the vast concourse of idle\r\n    white and black persons that frequently assemble together for the\r\n    purpose of fighting cocks, at which time they drink to access,\r\n    become riotous, and disturb the quiet and repose of the good\r\n    citizens, be it ordained by Mayor, Recorder, Aldermen, and Common\r\n    Council that any white person or persons or free negro or negroes\r\n    who shall presume to fight any game cocks or dunghill fouls within\r\n    the jurisdiction of the corporation for any wagers or for diversion\r\n    shall for every offense pay $5. Also if having assembled in a\r\n    disorderly manner for the purpose of fighting cocks, if they refuse\r\n    to disperse, constables shall take such negro or negroes (being\r\n    slaves) and give him, her, or them, due correction upon the bare\r\n    back in some public part of Georgetown not exceeding 39 strikes.\r\n\r\nAn ordinance for regulating and licensing hackney carriages, billiard\r\ntables, theatrical and other public amusements.\r\n\r\nAnother says,\r\n\r\n    ... any person or persons who shall keep or maintain the common\r\n    gaming house or open or set up any public gaming table shall forfeit\r\n    and pay $20 current money.\r\n\r\n    Provided always, that licensed billiard tables are not intended\r\n    hereby to be prohibited or herein included.\r\n\r\nPassed 4th October 1803.\r\n\r\nThe fire engines and fire buckets heretofore bought by the subscription\r\nof sundry inhabitants of the town have been offered for the use of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 the corporation of Georgetown was concerning itself a good deal\r\nwith the paving of the streets.\r\n\r\nJohn Mason, Jesse Baley and Wm. H. Dorsey were a committee to report\r\npermanent systems for improving the streets and alleys, whether by\r\npaving or otherwise.\r\n\r\nThey determined to commence the work at the intersection of Washington\r\n(30th) and Bridge (M) Streets and carry the pavement up along the north\r\nside of Bridge Street to the intersection of High and Water Streets and\r\nthence, after paving with round stone the Center Square to continue it\r\nafterwards along the south of Fall Street ... to remove the earth and\r\npave 5 ft. wide against the curb stone, where individuals would not\r\npave, from Washington to High Street and to graduate and pave the Center\r\nSquare.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal more work of that kind to be done at that time and\r\nJohn Peter was appointed permanent superintendent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\n_Washington and L'Enfant in George Town_\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the town through which General George Washington passed in\r\nApril 1789, on his way from Mount Vernon to his inauguration in New York\r\nas first President of the government which was trying out an experiment\r\nnew to the world.\r\n\r\nIn the _Times and Potowmack Packet_, on April 23, is this insertion:\r\n\r\n    George Town. Last Thursday passed through this town on his way to\r\n    New York the most illustrious, the President of the United States of\r\n    America, with Charles Thompson, Esq. Secretary, to Congress. His\r\n    Excellency arrived at about 2 O'Clock on the bank of the Patowmack,\r\n    escorted by a respectable corps of gentlemen from Alexandria where\r\n    the George Town ferry boats, properly equipped, received his\r\n    Excellency and suit, safely landed them, under the acclamation of a\r\n    large crowd of their grateful fellow citizens--who beheld his\r\n    Fabius, in the evening of his day, bid adieu to the peaceful retreat\r\n    of Mount Vernon, in order to save his country once more from\r\n    confusion and anarchy. From this place his Excellency was escorted\r\n    by corps of gentlemen commanded by Col. Wm. Deakins, Junr., to Mr.\r\n    Spurrier's Tavern, where the escort from Baltimore take charge of\r\n    him.\r\n\r\nColonel Deakins was Justice of the Peace, a very high office in those\r\ndays, (there was no mayor) besides being a large landowner and\r\nshipowner.\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent men who probably formed this escort were many of\r\nWashington's former officers of the Revolutionary Army, for when he\r\ncame to George Town he was amongst old friends: Colonel Forrest, Major\r\nStoddert, General James Maccubbin Lingan, General Otho Williams, William\r\nBeatty (who had distinguished himself in the army and had attained the\r\nrank of Colonel), Thomas Richardson who, although a Quaker, was Captain\r\nof a company and won high repute; William Murdock, who had been a\r\nColonel of militia raised for the defense of the Province of Maryland in\r\n1776, and Lloyd Beall, who had been adjutant of the Staff of Alexander\r\nHamilton, and General John Mason.\r\n\r\nI quote freely from Dr. H. Paul Caemmerer's very interesting _Biography\r\nof Pierre Charles L'Enfant_. \"Among the numerous problems of the first\r\nCongress in 1789, was the question of establishment of a seat of\r\ngovernment or a National Capital. During the period of the Continental\r\nCongress and the subsequent period of the Congress of the Confederation,\r\nfrom 1774 to 1789, Congress had met in eight different town and\r\ncities--Philadelphia, Baltimore, Lancaster, York, Princeton, Annapolis,\r\nTrenton, and New York City, part of the time pursued by the enemy and\r\npart of the time attacked by disgruntled soldiers. It was found\r\ndifficult for Members of Congress to find adequate quarters, and it was\r\nalways a problem to move records and files. Thus it developed that\r\nCongress wanted a home of its own. The Constitution of the United States\r\nprovided for a Federal District ten miles square (Art. 1, Sec. 8, Par.\r\n17).\"\r\n\r\n\"On September 11, 1789, while yet the idea of locating a Capital City\r\nwas still unsettled, L'Enfant wrote to President Washington asking to be\r\nemployed to design the Capital of 'this vast empire.'\"\r\n\r\n\"It might be inferred from this letter that L'Enfant knew more about the\r\ncontroversy in the Halls of Congress on the subject of location of the\r\nSeat of Government than we know today. It was at its height, that we\r\nknow. The question of size of the Federal District had been settled by\r\nthe Constitution--it was to be ten miles square. Now the question of\r\nlocation predominated--the question of 'exclusive jurisdiction' to be\r\nexercised by Congress had been generally conceded.\r\n\r\nThe discussion was finally limited to two sites: first, a location on\r\nthe banks of the Potomac at least as far South as Georgetown, Maryland,\r\nwhich was favored particularly by the Southern members of Congress as\r\nbeing the geographical center of the United States; second, a site on\r\nthe Delaware River near the falls above Trenton, which Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, and the other States nearby favored. But on the whole it was\r\ndeemed very important during the First Congress to give the National\r\nCapital a central location along the Atlantic coast. Southern members\r\nled by Richard Bland Lee and James Madison, of Virginia, argued for\r\nconsideration for the question by Congress before adjournment, and\r\nrecommended the Potomac River site near Georgetown.\"\r\n\r\n\"The burning question before Congress at the time was a bill for funding\r\nof the public debt and the assumption of debts incurred by the States\r\nduring the Revolutionary War, amounting to about $20,000,000. Alexander\r\nHamilton as the first Secretary of the Treasury had recommended the\r\nfunding of both forms of indebtedness in obligations of the United\r\nStates. His aim was to restore the value of the worthless continental\r\ndollar (a pound of tea sold for $90; a pair of shoes for $100; a barrel\r\nof flour for $1,500 in paper money) but it was pointed out that the\r\nassumption of State debts by the Government would result in most\r\nbenefits to the Northern States where there was most of the trade, while\r\nmostly agriculture was in the South.... Thus we come to the famous\r\ncompromise proposed by Hamilton about the middle of June, 1790, when in\r\nconsideration of locating the capital on the banks of the Potomac he\r\nhoped to secure enough votes to secure the enactment of the funding\r\nbill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus by the Act of July 16, 1790, it was definitely decided that the\r\nseat of government should be on the banks of the Potomac.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thereupon arose the question of design for the Federal City. Pursuant\r\nto the application received, President Washington chose Pierre Charles\r\nL'Enfant, 'the artist of the American Revolution,' for this work. No\r\nbetter choice could have been made. L'Enfant applied his ability to the\r\ntask with enthusiasm; the approbation of 'his General' gave him supreme\r\nsatisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"In accordance with directions from President Washington, Major L'Enfant\r\nproceeded to Georgetown for the purpose of making a sketch of the area\r\nproposed for the Federal City that would enable him to fix locations on\r\nthe spot for public buildings. He arrived on March 9, 1791. L'Enfant\r\ncarried with him a letter of instructions from Secretary of State\r\nJefferson as follows:\r\n\r\n    'Sir: You are desired to proceed to Georgetown where you will find\r\n    Mr. Ellicott employed in making a survey and Map of the Federal\r\n    Territory. The special object of asking your aid is to have a\r\n    drawing of the particular grounds most likely to be approved for the\r\n    site of the Federal town and buildings. You will therefore be\r\n    pleased to begin on the Eastern branch and proceed from thence\r\n    upwards, laying down the hills, valleys, morasses and waters between\r\n    that and the Potomac, The Tyber, and the road leading from\r\n    Georgetown to the Eastern branch and connecting the whole with\r\n    certain fixed points on the map Mr. Ellicott is preparing. Some idea\r\n    of the height of the lands above the base on which they stand would\r\n    be desirable. For necessary assistance and expense be pleased to\r\n    apply to the Mayor of Georgetown who is written to on the subject. I\r\n    will beg the favor of you to mark to me your progress about twice a\r\n    week, say every Wednesday and Saturday evening, that I may be able\r\n    in proper time to draw your attention to some other objects which I\r\n    have not at this moment sufficient information to define.'\"\r\n\r\n\"_The Maryland Journal and Baltimore Advertiser_ of March 18, 1791,\r\nreported Major L'Enfant's arrival in Georgetown as follows:\r\n\r\n    'GEORGETOWN (Patowmac) March 12.\r\n\r\n    Wednesday (March 9) evening arrived in this town Major Longfont, a\r\n    French gentleman employed by the President of the United States to\r\n    survey the lands contiguous to Georgetown, where the Federal City is\r\n    to be put. His skill in matters of this kind is justly extolled by\r\n    all disposed to give merit its proper tribute of praise. He is\r\n    earnest in the business and hopes to be able to lay a plan of that\r\n    parcel of land before the President on his arrival in this town.'\r\n\r\n\"L'Enfant reported to Secretary of State Jefferson, promptly:\r\n\r\n    'Friday March 11, 1791\r\n\r\n    Sir: I have the honor of informing you of my arrival at this place\r\n    where I could not possibly reach before Wednesday last and very late\r\n    in the evening, after having traveled part of the way on foot and\r\n    part on horseback leaving the broken stage behind.\r\n\r\n    'On arriving I made it my first care to wait on the Mayor of the\r\n    town in conformity with the direction which you gave me. He appeared\r\n    to be much surprised and he assured me he had received no previous\r\n    notice of my coming nor any injunction relating to the business I\r\n    was sent upon. However next day--yesterday morning--he made me a\r\n    kind offer of his assistance in procuring for me three or four men\r\n    to attend me in the surveying and this being the only thing I was in\r\n    need of, every matter has been soon arranged. I am only at present\r\n    to regret that a heavy rain and thick mist which has been incessant\r\n    ever since my arrival here, does put an insuperable obstacle to my\r\n    wish of proceeding immediately to the survey. Should the weather\r\n    continue bad, as there is every appearance it will, I shall be much\r\n    at a lost how to make a plan of the ground you have pointed out to\r\n    me and have it ready for the President at the time he is expected at\r\n    this place.'\"\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime President Washington had begun his triumphal tour\r\nthrough the South. In Maryland he was escorted by his Excellency\r\nGovernor Howard and the Honorable Mr. Kilty: Washington's Diary for\r\nMarch 28-30, 1791, reports:\r\n\r\n    'Monday 28th: Left Bladensburgh at half after six, and breakfasted\r\n    at George Town about 8:--where, having appointed the Commissioners\r\n    under the Residence Law to meet me, I found Mr. Johnson one of them\r\n    (and who is Chief Justice of the State) in waiting--and soon after\r\n    came in David Stuart, and Danl. Carroll Esqrs. the other two. A few\r\n    miles out of Town I was met by the principal Citizens of the place\r\n    and escorted in by them; and dined at Suter's tavern (where I also\r\n    lodged) at a public dinner given by the Mayor and\r\n    Corporation--previous to which I examined the Surveys of Mr.\r\n    Ellicott who had been sent on to lay out the district of ten miles\r\n    square for the federal seat; and also works of Majr. L'Enfant who\r\n    had been engaged to examine and make a draught of the grds. in the\r\n    vicinity of George Town and Carrollsburg on the Eastern Branch\r\n    making arrangements for examining the ground myself tomorrow with\r\n    the Commissioners.'\r\n\r\n    'Tuesday, 29th\r\n\r\n    'In thick mist, and under strong appearance of a settled rain (which\r\n    however did not happen) I set out about 7 o'clock, for the purpose\r\n    above mentioned, but from the unfavorableness of the day, I derived\r\n    no great satisfaction from the review.\r\n\r\n    'Finding the interests of the Landholders about George Town and\r\n    those about the Carrollsburgh much at variance and that their fears\r\n    and jealousies of each were counteracting the public purposes and\r\n    might prove injurious to its best interests, whilst if properly\r\n    managed they might be made to subserve it, I requested them to meet\r\n    me at six o'clock this afternoon at my lodgings, which they\r\n    accordingly did....\r\n\r\n    'Dined at Colo. Forrest's today with the Commissioners and others.'\r\n    [Whose residence was at 3348 M Street.]\r\n\r\n    'Wednesday, 30th.\r\n\r\n    'The parties to whom I addressed myself yesterday evening, having\r\n    taken the matter into consideration, saw the propriety of my\r\n    observations; and that whilst they were contending for the shadow\r\n    they might loose the substance; and therefore mutually agreed and\r\n    entered into articles to surrender for public purposes, one half of\r\n    the land they severally possessed within the bounds which were\r\n    designated as necessary for the City to stand with some other\r\n    stipulations, which were inserted in the instrument which they\r\n    respectively subscribed.\r\n\r\n    'This business being thus happily finished and some directions given\r\n    to the Commissioners, the Surveyor and Engineer with respect to the\r\n    mode of laying out the district--Surveying the grounds for the City\r\n    and forming them into lots--I left Georgetown, dined in Alexandria\r\n    and reached Mount Vernon in the evening.'\"\r\n\r\nThe \"others,\" with whom he dined, were evidently the proprietors of the\r\nland, sixteen, who next day signed before witnesses the agreement drawn\r\nup that day. It is too long to quote in its entirety, but in effect\r\nthese were the conditions: \"that in consideration of the good benefits\r\nthey were to derive from having the Federal City laid off upon their\r\nlands the President may retain any number of squares he may think proper\r\nfor public improvements or uses at the rate of L25 ($66.66 in Penn.\r\ncurrency) per acre. For the streets they should receive no compensation.\r\nEach proprietor was to retain full possession of his land till it should\r\nbe sold into lots.\" The men who signed, in order of signing, were:\r\nRobert Peter, David Burnes, James M. Lingan, Uriah Forrest, Benjamin\r\nStoddert, Notley Young, Daniel Carroll, of Duddington; Overton Carr,\r\nThomas Beall, of George; Charles Beatty, Anthony Holmead, William Young,\r\nEdward Peirce, Abraham Young, James Peirce, and William Prout. At a\r\nlater date the following men joined in the agreement and are often\r\ncounted among the original property holders: Robert Morris, Samuel\r\nBlodget, William Bailey, Samuel Davidson, William Deakins, Jr., James\r\nGreenleaf, Thomas Johnson, Robert Lingan, Dominick Lynch, John\r\nNicholson, John H. Stone, Comfort Sands, Benjamin Oden, John P. Van\r\nNess, George Walker, and the legal guardians of Elizabeth Wheeler.\r\n\r\nIt was in this little town that the President issued his proclamation\r\nconcerning the permanent seat of government of the United States. It\r\nreads thus:\r\n\r\n    Done at George Town, aforesaid, the 30th day of March in the year of\r\n    our Lord, 1791 and in the Independence of the United States the\r\n    fifteenth.\r\n\r\n                                  By the President,\r\n                                                   GEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n    THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfactorily accomplished this business, General Washington\r\nproceeded to Mount Vernon, whence he wrote on April 3, 1791, to the\r\nCommissioners to proceed at once with the Attorney-General in regard to\r\ndeeds so that the sale of lots and public buildings might commence as\r\nsoon as possible. He quotes a letter from Mr. Jefferson:\r\n\r\n    ... that on the 27th of March a bill had been introduced in the\r\n    House of Representatives for granting a sum of money for building a\r\n    Federal Hall, a house for the President, etc.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Commissioners on September 9, 1791, in reply to a\r\nletter from Major L'Enfant a letter was written saying:\r\n\r\n    ... that the title of the map he was making was to be, \"A Map of the\r\n    City of Washington in the Territory of Columbia,\" and that the\r\n    streets were to be named alphabetically one way and numerically the\r\n    other, etc.\r\n\r\n    (Signed by)\r\n               THOMAS JOHNSON,\r\n               DAVID STUART,\r\n               DANIEL CARROLL.\r\n\r\nL'Enfant aimed to make an original plan for the Federal City, adapted to\r\nthe topography, but he endeavored to secure ideas from plans of great\r\ncities of Europe that might be found possible of adaptation so he wrote\r\nto Jefferson who sent his notable reply and plans of a number of cities\r\nthat he had secured evidently while our minister to France.\r\n\r\n\"June 30th Washington noted, 'The business which brot. me to Georgetown\r\nbeing finished and the Comrs. instructed with respect to the mode of\r\ncarrying the plan into effect, I set off this morning a littel after 4\r\no'clock, in the prosecution of my journey towards Philadelphia....'\"\r\n\r\n\"Thereupon the building site for the city took on intense activity.\"\r\n\r\nPierre Charles L'Enfant was the son of Pierre L'Enfant, an artist who\r\npainted battle scenes and also designed tapestries for the Gobelin\r\nWorks. L'Enfant himself was an artist and it was his artistic\r\ntemperament which caused him trouble. At the age of 22 he had come to\r\nAmerica to volunteer his services in the war against England. He became\r\nan officer of engineers, and also helped Gen. von Steuben drill the Army\r\nat Valley Forge, and worked on fortifications. After the war he was a\r\npracticing architect in New York City for several years but when he\r\nheard of the Federal City to be created he longed to be the author of\r\nits plan and as I have said wrote to Washington asking for the job.\r\n\r\nBut it was his desire for perfection which eventually was his undoing.\r\nThere was delay in submitting the Plan to President Washington, and also\r\nhe refused to take orders from any one except Washington, whereas he was\r\ntold to take them from the three Commissioners of the District of\r\nColumbia: Thomas Johnson, David Stuart, and Daniel Carroll. Dr. David\r\nStuart had become the second husband of Mrs. John Parke Custis,\r\ndaughter-in-law of Mrs. Washington. Things went from bad to worse when\r\nthe nephew of Daniel Carroll the Commissioner, Daniel Carroll of\r\nDuddington, started to build a house which abutted into a street laid\r\nout on the Plan and Major L'Enfant had it demolished. Also there was\r\ndelay in getting the Map engraved.\r\n\r\nMajor L'Enfant lived at Suter's Tavern during the months he was working\r\nin George Town. But where he actually did his work of drawing his famous\r\nMap, where Andrew Ellicott had his office as surveyor, and where the\r\nthree Commissioners met for their business has never been settled.\r\n\r\nThe tradition is that their office was The Little Old Stone House, now\r\n3049 M Street, and known for many years as \"General Washington's\r\nHeadquarters.\" As General Washington never had need for military\r\nheadquarters here, for there was no fighting nearby, this tradition has\r\npersisted that this was the office of the Commissioners.\r\n\r\nOn December 13th President Washington sent a letter to L'Enfant advising\r\nhim that he must work under orders from the Commissioners.\r\n\r\n\"Then before leaving for Philadelphia to superintend the engraving of\r\nhis \"Plan\" personally, L'Enfant wrote to the Commissioners asking for\r\nsupplies for the winter work, as follows:\r\n\r\n    'Georgetown Dec. 25, 1791.\r\n\r\n    'Gentlemen: Mr. Roberdeau, on whose activity and zeal I rely in the\r\n    execution of what is necessary to accomplish this winter, will\r\n    communicate to you a statement of the business I committed to this\r\n    care and I have to request you will make provision for the supply of\r\n    25 hands in the quarries and 50 in the city which in all will be 75\r\n    men kept in employment besides their respective overseers.\r\n\r\n    'There is an immediate necessity for a number of wheel-barrows and\r\n    above 100 will be wanted early in the spring. Therefore I beg you\r\n    will devise the mode of obtaining that number before the 15th of\r\n    March next--These wheel-barrows ought to be made light and should be\r\n    only roughly finished, though substantial, ...'\r\n\r\nNext we find that L'Enfant addressed a long and comprehensive Report to\r\nPresident Washington 'for renewing the work at the Federal City' in the\r\napproaching season and giving an estimate of expenditures for one year\r\nin the amount of $1,200,000.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have here to do with the idealism of L'Enfant that contemplated\r\nquite a completely built city before it was occupied and operated as a\r\n'Seat of Government.' Unfortunately, L'Enfant did not realize the\r\npoverty of the Treasury; and the state of mind of national legislators,\r\nparticularly of the North, who preferred to stay in Philadelphia to\r\nmoving 'to the Indian Place' on the banks of the Potomac.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is generally thought that the trouble concerning the Daniel Carroll\r\nof Duddington House was the reason for L'Enfant's resignation from the\r\nWashington work in March, 1792, and the reason for the letter from\r\nSecretary of State Jefferson terminating his services that month. But a\r\nclose analysis of L'Enfant's experiences reveals that this was simply a\r\n'serious incident' in a chain of troubles to follow. This brings to\r\nlight the names of L'Enfant's assistants Roberdeau and Baraof. There\r\nwere also Benjamin Banneker; and Alexander Ralston.\"\r\n\r\n\"L'Enfant remained silent so far as arguments with President Washington\r\nand the Plan was concerned, until 1800 after 'his General' had died. In\r\nthe meantime the L'Enfant Plan was engraved, the question of\r\ncompensation to L'Enfant came up and he was reimbursed in part.\" But the\r\nquestion of payment to Major L'Enfant was never settled.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Georgetown he worked on a Plan for the city of Patterson,\r\nNew Jersey, built a magnificent house for Robert Morris in Philadelphia\r\nwhich was never finished, and also Oeller's Hotel where the\r\nPhiladelphia Assemblies were held.\r\n\r\nFrom 1800 to 1810 he spent most of his time and efforts trying to secure\r\npayment for his services in laying out the Plan of the Capital City of\r\nWashington. On July 7, 1812 Secretary of War Eustis appointed him\r\nProfessor of Engineering in the Military Academy at West Point but he\r\ndeclined saying that he had not \"the rigidity of manner, the tongue nor\r\nthe patience, nor indeed any inclination peculiar to instructors.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1814 he was consulted in regard to the fortification of Fort\r\nWashington opposite Mount Vernon and did some work there.\r\n\r\nAfter the war was over he continued to live there at Warburton Manor\r\nwith Thomas A. Digges until 1824 when he went to live with a nephew\r\nWilliam Dudley Digges at Green Hill nearby, where he died, June 14,\r\n1825, and was buried on the estate.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 the U. S. Government at last honored him by burying him in the\r\nNational Cemetery at Arlington, in front of the house, overlooking the\r\ncity of his dream.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock October 12, 1792, the corner-stone of the President's\r\nHouse was laid, but there is no record of any ceremony. There is,\r\nhowever, a long account in the newspapers of the laying of the\r\ncorner-stone of the Capitol, which was personally performed by George\r\nWashington in his capacity as a Mason, on September 18, 1792, \"amid a\r\nbrilliant crowd of spectators of both sexes.\" Right at the head of the\r\nprocession, immediately following \"the Surveying Department of the City\r\nof Washington,\" is noted \"The Mayor and Corporation of George Town.\"\r\nJohn Threlkeld was Mayor that year, and certainly that \"brilliant\r\ncrowd\" must have been largely composed of Georgetonians for the dwellers\r\nin the City of Washington at that time were few and far between. Witness\r\nGeneral Washington's letter on the 17th of May, 1795, to Alexander\r\nWhite, one of the Commissioners: \"I shall intimate that a residence in\r\nthe City if a house is to be had, will be more promotive of its welfare\r\nthan your abode in George Town.\" He was nursing along his namesake in\r\nevery possible way. On February 8, 1798, he notes in his diary: \"Visited\r\nPublic Buildings in the morning.\" The day before, the 7th, he speaks of\r\ngoing to a meeting of the Potomac Company, dining with Colonel\r\nFitzgerald, and lodging with Thomas Peter at Number 2618 K Street. This\r\nwas only natural, as Mrs. Peter was, of course, his step-granddaughter.\r\nOn that same trip he met the Commissioners again, this time at Union\r\nTavern, and dined there. On August 5th his diary says: \"Went to George\r\nTown to a general meeting of the Potomac Company. Dined at the Union\r\nTavern and lodged at Mr. Law's.\" Thomas Law, an Englishman, had married\r\nEliza Custis, Mrs. Washington's eldest grandchild, and had a home on\r\nCapitol Hill.\r\n\r\nOn August 11th he again spent the night at Thomas Peter's home, and that\r\nwas the last night he ever spent in the city named in his honor. He was\r\nnever to live to see the government established in the city over which\r\nhe had worked so hard, and in which he had such absolute implicit faith.\r\n\r\n\"A century hence,\" he wrote, \"if this country keeps united, it will\r\nproduce a city, though not so large as London, yet of a magnitude\r\ninferior to few other in Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\n_Below Bridge Street_\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly all of the business, and most of the social life, up until 1800\r\ntook place below Bridge (M) Street. The island in the river below George\r\nTown, which was called, variously, Analostan, Mason's Island, My Lord's\r\nIsland, and Barbadoes, was almost a part of George Town in those days.\r\nIt belonged to the great plantation of George Mason, of Gunston, the\r\nbrilliant statesman and author of the Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\nHis son, General Mason, had there an estate where he entertained in fine\r\nstyle. Louis Philippe of France, while a visitor in George Town, was\r\nfeted there and said he had never seen a more elegant entertainment.\r\nTwenty-three kinds of fish were caught in the river in those days,\r\nbesides terrapin and snapping turtles, so perhaps they helped to\r\nembellish the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe island was rich in forest trees, foliage, flowering and aromatic\r\nshrubs, orchards of cherry, apple, and peach trees. Cotton was grown\r\nthere which was the color of nankeen; it was spun, woven, and used in\r\nits natural color, without being dyed. Also, there was grown a variety\r\nof maize of deep purple color, used as a dye.\r\n\r\nJohn Mason had also a town house which we shall mention later. He, like\r\nmost of the men in this community, was engaged in the business of\r\nshipping tobacco. The majority of his trade seems to have been with\r\nFrance, from letters of his father to him, in which the great George\r\noffered to help out his son in his shipments by letting him have some of\r\nthe hogsheads he had on hand.\r\n\r\nJohn Mason had been a general in the Revolution, and was at the head of\r\nthe militia here, and also owned a ferry operating to the Virginia shore\r\nfrom the foot of High Street (Wisconsin Avenue). The ferry was worked by\r\na great iron chain.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 Analostan Island was purchased by William A. Bradley, nephew of\r\nthe Abraham Bradley who came to Washington with the Government in 1800\r\nas Assistant Postmaster General. For many years it was a wilderness,\r\nwith only traces showing of its once famous house, but not long ago it\r\nwas purchased by the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Association.\r\n\r\nRobert Peter's house stood on High Street (Wisconsin Avenue), about\r\nwhere Grace Church now stands. He owned the whole block between Congress\r\n(31st) Street and High Street (Wisconsin Avenue), up to Bridge (M)\r\nStreet. It was called Peter's Square. At the age of forty, after he had\r\nlived nearly fifteen years in George Town, he married Elizabeth Scott,\r\nthe daughter of George Scott, High Sheriff of Prince George County. They\r\nhad eight children.\r\n\r\nTheir eldest son, Thomas, was married in 1795 to Martha Parke Custis,\r\nthe second granddaughter of Mrs. Washington. The bride was sixteen, the\r\ngroom twenty-seven. The wedding took place at Hope Park near Fairfax\r\nCourt House, where Martha's mother, the former Eleanor Calvert (Mrs.\r\nJohn Parke Custis), had been living since she became the wife of David\r\nStuart, one of the Commissioners laying out the City of Washington.\r\nSoon after their marriage, Mr. Peter gave to Thomas and his wife one of\r\nthe six houses he had built for his sons on lots across Rock Creek in\r\nthe new city. The one he gave them was 2618 K Street, and is still\r\nstanding. It was there that General Washington stayed with the young\r\ncouple so often. Martha was very lovely in appearance, and very devoted\r\nto her step-grandfather, and he, apparently, to her.\r\n\r\nRobert Peter's eldest daughter, Elizabeth, was married in 1787 to her\r\ncousin, James Dunlop. Mr. Peter's mother had been Jean Dunlop of\r\nGarnkirke. To this couple, the father also gave a house situated not far\r\nfrom his own, a block away, up High Street (Wisconsin Avenue). There\r\nthey reared a large family.\r\n\r\nNo more interesting figure looms out of the mists of early George Town\r\nthan the Reverend Stephen Bloomer Balch, the founder and first pastor of\r\nthe Presbyterian Church. But, far more than that, he seems to have been\r\npastor, \"Parson,\" as he was affectionately called, for the entire\r\ncommunity. It was in his church edifice that each denomination met until\r\nthey procured their own.\r\n\r\nBorn on his parents' place in the Susquehanna region, graduated from\r\nPrinceton in the same class with Aaron Burr, Dr. Balch went to Lower\r\nMarlboro, Calvert County, Maryland, to take charge of a classical\r\nacademy in October, 1775. For two years he taught, drilled the students\r\nin military training, and studied theology on the side. His books were\r\nborrowed from the Reverend Thomas Clagett, who afterwards became the\r\nfirst Episcopal Bishop of Maryland, and now lies buried in the\r\nWashington Cathedral, not very far from his pupil in Oak Hill Cemetery.\r\n\r\nNot very long after Dr. Balch was licensed as a preacher, he came to\r\nGeorge Town, about 1778, the only place of worship at that time being\r\nthe Lutherans' small building, where their new church now stands on the\r\ncorner of the present Q Street and Wisconsin Avenue. The lot was given\r\nin 1769 by Colonel Charles Beatty. Dr. Balch preached there on Thursday\r\nnight and again on Sunday. He did not remain at that time, but, a year\r\nor so later, asked to come back, and at first used a little frame house\r\non the north side of Bridge (M) Street, which was occupied on week days\r\nby a school. Just about this time he was made principal of the Columbian\r\nAcademy, and the next year he married Elizabeth Beall, the daughter of\r\nGeorge Beall. I wonder if he had, by any chance, met her on his first\r\nvisit, and the memory of her bright eyes had followed him on his\r\njourneys down into the Carolines and lured him back.\r\n\r\nAt the wedding of Dr. and Mrs. Balch in 1782, tea was served in cups not\r\nmuch larger than thimbles. The ladies of George Town would not drink tea\r\nat all during the Revolution, and it was still not plentiful.\r\n\r\nHe was of a susceptible nature, for, after his wife's death in 1827, he\r\nwas married the next year, when he was eighty-two, to another Elizabeth,\r\none of the King family. She lived only eighteen days, and a little more\r\nthan a year later, he again embarked on the sea of matrimony, this time\r\nwith a widow, Mrs. Jane Parrott. By his first wife he had eleven\r\nchildren, the usual number in those days.\r\n\r\nIn 1783, one year after his first marriage, he built his home on Duck\r\nLane (33rd Street), which he called \"Mamre,\" from the Old Testament.\r\nAfter Abraham and Lot had separated, Abraham giving Lot the first choice\r\nof location, \"the Lord told Abraham to look over the whole land which He\r\nwould give to him and his seed forever, and Abraham moved his tent and\r\ndwelt by the oaks of Mamre, and built there an altar unto the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1799, when a street was graded through, it completely ruined his\r\nproperty and he was obliged to take refuge with neighbors. One of his\r\nneighbors was James Calder, who was a trustee of his church, and Mr.\r\nCrookshanks lived near by. Dr. Balch had an island on the river called\r\n\"Patmos.\" This time he went to the New Testament and named it for Saint\r\nJohn's abode, where he wrote the Book of Revelations. This island\r\nsupplied wood for his fires. He had, also, a little way out of town, a\r\nfarm of ten acres.\r\n\r\nOne Fourth of July, his son, Thomas, aged eight, as he tells us in his\r\n_Reminiscences_, wanted to deliver an oration which he had prepared--in\r\nScotch Row, near by his home. All of his comrades had gone to see\r\nCaptain Doughty's Company on parade with the fife-and-drum corps. But\r\nthe little boy was not to be deterred. He went up on Bridge (M) Street,\r\nhunting an audience and a distinguished one he brought back with him. If\r\nsmall in number, it made up in quality, for he had General John Mason\r\nand Monsieur Pichon, a \"bland and elegant\" Frenchman sent by Napoleon to\r\nreceive the $15,000,000 for the purchase of the Louisiana Territory. Mr.\r\nPichon was a Huguenot from the city of Lyons and lived, while here, near\r\nthe Bank of Columbia. This son followed in his father's footsteps as a\r\nminister and did not have to go out always for his audience.\r\n\r\nA short while after the death of General Washington, Dr. Balch gave\r\nnotice that he was going to speak on the life and services of the great\r\nstatesman. He preached in the open air to more than a thousand people.\r\n\r\nThe last years of Dr. Balch's life were spent at number 3302 Gay (N)\r\nStreet, where a bad fire destroyed many valuable papers and the records\r\nof his church. He wrote to a friend: \"Only the Parrott (his wife)\r\nremains!\" Apparently, he never lost his sense of humor. Perhaps it was\r\nthat which helped to make him so universally beloved.\r\n\r\nDr. Balch died on the 7th of September, 1833. Every house in town was\r\nhung in black, all the stores and banks were closed and the bells tolled\r\nas his body was carried to the church.\r\n\r\nOne block westward of Dr. Balch's original house lived another man, very\r\ninfluential in the religious life of the town in addition to his large\r\nbusiness activities. Henry Foxall, a native of Monmouthshire, England,\r\nwas born in 1760. He went to Dublin, where he was put in charge of\r\nextensive iron works and where he became a Methodist. On coming to this\r\ncountry, he first settled in Philadelphia, where, in 1794, he was a\r\npartner in the Eagle Iron Works of Robert Morris, the great financier\r\nand signer of the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas Jefferson became President, he thought it advisable to have\r\nat the seat of government an ordnance plant, so Morris recommended\r\nFoxall, who came here in 1799 for that purpose. He built his foundry on\r\nthe western outskirts of George Town, just behind Georgetown College.\r\nHe built also a large brick house, two stories, with dormer windows on\r\nFrederick (34th) Street, between Water (K) and Bridge (M) Streets. It\r\nwas quite a pretentious house for that time, with its high ceilings,\r\nelaborately decorated cornices of minute workmanship, and mantels of\r\ncarved wood. It had ample grounds, and in front stood two tall and\r\ngraceful Lombardy poplars. He had also a summer home, a little farther\r\nout and higher up, called \"Spring Hill,\" from whence he had a fine view\r\nof the Potomac and the Virginia hills.\r\n\r\nA warm friendship sprang up between him and Thomas Jefferson, as they\r\nhad many tastes in common. Both were performers on the violin and used\r\nto accompany each other, and both were fond of tinkering. Jefferson, you\r\nremember, was of a very inventive turn of mind. During this time he\r\nthought of an air-tight stove and got Mr. Foxall to make some according\r\nto his ideas, but they did not work out to please him.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson lived for a while in George Town on the little street\r\nbearing his name, between Washington (30th) and Congress (31st) Streets,\r\nrunning south below Bridge (M) Street, in a house demolished a few years\r\nago. It stood immediately south of the Canal on the east side, and was\r\nin appearance much like the home of Francis Scott Key. It must have been\r\nduring the time he was Secretary of State in John Adams's administration\r\nthat he occupied this house.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson was never happy living in a town. I found this interesting\r\nlittle tidbit about him in the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_: \"For eight\r\nyears he tabulated with painful accuracy the earliest and latest\r\nappearance of 37 vegetables in the Washington market, and after his\r\nreturn from France for 23 years he received from his old friend, the\r\nsuperintendent of the JARDIN DES PLANTES, a box of seeds which he\r\ndistributed to public and private gardens throughout the United States.\"\r\nSo I think we might easily call him the founder of the Garden Clubs of\r\nAmerica, certainly of the Georgetown Garden Club.\r\n\r\nMr. Foxall was a convert to Wesleyanism, and a lay minister. He was in\r\nthe habit of entertaining the members of the Methodist Conference at\r\nthis home, and was once good-humoredly twitted by one of them in regard\r\nto his inconsistent roles of \"proclaimer of the gospel of peace and\r\nforger of weapons of war.\" To this he replied: \"If I do make guns to\r\ndestroy men's bodies, I build churches to save their souls.\"\r\n\r\nAt this foundry (then the only one south of Philadelphia), cannon were\r\ncast for the American troops during the War of 1812. The artillery and\r\nindeed all the military arms of this country were then very imperfect.\r\nFoxall was the only founder in America who understood the proper mode of\r\nmanufacture. Here began the first manufacture of bored cannon in this\r\ncountry, being vastly superior to the old ordnance. The abandonment and\r\nrecasting of the old-style guns speedily followed.\r\n\r\nCommodore Perry would have no others on the little fleet he built at\r\nPut-in-Bay on Lake Erie. The battle of Lake Erie was deferred until\r\nFoxall could fill an order from the government for guns, and transport\r\nthem over the mountains on carts drawn by ten or twelve yoke of oxen to\r\nthe scene of the engagement. From the deck of his flagship _The\r\nLawrence_, manned by these guns from George Town, Perry sent his famous\r\nmessage, \"We have met the enemy and they are ours!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY FOXALL]\r\n\r\nIn 1814, when the British entered Washington and burned the Capitol and\r\nthe White House, this foundry, upon which the country depended so\r\nlargely for its supplies, was in imminent danger, and its owner vowed\r\nthat, if God would spare it, he would build a church to His glory. The\r\nenemy had their face set in its direction when a sudden and violent\r\nstorm turned them from their course. An old letter, written by George\r\nBleig, afterwards Chaplain-General of the British Army, says: \"On the\r\n25th a hurricane fell on the city which unroofed houses and upset our\r\nthree-pound guns. It upset me also. It fairly lifted me out of the\r\nsaddle, and the horse which I had been riding, I never saw again.\"\r\n\r\nTrue to his vow, Henry Foxall built the Foundry Methodist Church at the\r\nnortheast corner of 14th and G Streets. It was sold some years later and\r\nthe Colorado office building erected there. With the proceeds the very\r\nhandsome grey stone church was built on 16th Street above Scott Circle.\r\nThe trustees of the Foundry Church were Isaac Owens, Leonard Mackall,\r\nJohn Eliason, William Doughty, Joel Brown, John Lutz, and Samuel\r\nMcKenney.\r\n\r\nMethodism at that time was in a struggling condition. The first visit by\r\na Methodist preacher had been one by the tireless Francis Asbury. He was\r\nan old friend of Foxall, had visited him often in Philadelphia, and\r\npreached in George Town December 9, 1772. But it was twenty years before\r\nregular services were held, and then only by a preacher who came up from\r\nAlexandria. It was not until after the arrival of Henry Foxall that any\r\nMethodist preacher was stationed in the District. William Watters was so\r\nappointed in 1802.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME OF HENRY FOXALL]\r\n\r\nMr. Foxall was instrumental in the erection of no less than four\r\nchurches, the old church at George Town on Rock Creek, one at the Navy\r\nYard known as Ebenezer, a colored chapel, and later, the Foundry Church.\r\nIn 1814 was organized the first Bible society in the District of\r\nColumbia. Among its founders were Henry Foxall and Francis Scott Key,\r\nnear neighbors.\r\n\r\nMr. Foxall was three times married, his first wife was Ann Harward, whom\r\nhe married in England in 1780; his second was Margaret Smith, married in\r\nPhiladelphia in 1799; his third, Catherine, whom he married in 1816 in\r\nEngland, while on a visit home. He had only two children and they were\r\nby his first marriage--a son who died when twenty-five years old and\r\ndaughter, Mary Ann, who became the wife of Samuel McKenney, and for whom\r\nhe built a lovely home.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1823 he went to England for a visit, and there in\r\nDecember of that same year he died, quite suddenly, in great peace. \"He\r\nserved well his country, his generation, and his God.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Foxall was said by one of his old employees to have been honest and\r\njust in his dealings, and although he did a large business, employing\r\nmany people, he owed no man a dollar. He was prompt in paying off his\r\nworkmen, usually making coin payments. He was a conscientious, earnest\r\nChristian, a real enthusiast in his religion. During his term of office\r\nas mayor in 1819 and 1820, the ordinances for the town which provided\r\nagainst profaning the Sabbath, were strictly enforced.\r\n\r\nThe old Sunday Laws (so-called Blue Laws), which George Town inherited\r\nfrom Maryland, were decidedly severe, and it took a man of Mr. Foxall's\r\nforce of character to enforce them. A few of the offenses against which\r\nhe waged relentless war may be mentioned. Five dollars was the penalty\r\nfor gaming, hunting, and fishing on the Sabbath. No trading was allowed\r\non the Lord's Day, except the selling of \"fresh fish, milk, and other\r\nperishable goods.\" Cock-fighting and drinking, when indulged in by free\r\nmen, were punished by a fine of $5.00, but when a slave was the\r\noffender, he received thirty-nine stripes on the bare back in a public\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman was fond of buying slaves whom he would set free after\r\nteaching them a trade. Long years after, one of his old slaves boasted\r\nof having driven the Marquis de Lafayette to visit his old mistress,\r\nMrs. Catherine Foxall, on his visit in 1824.\r\n\r\nWhen the Potomac Canal was taken over and reorganized as the Chesapeake\r\nand Ohio Canal, a great celebration was made of the event.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, July 4, 1828, President John Quincy Adams, accompanied by\r\nheads of Federal Government Departments, members of the Diplomatic\r\nCorps, the president and directors of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal\r\nCompany and authorities of the three cities of the then District of\r\nColumbia: Washington, Alexandria, and Georgetown, assembled early at the\r\nUnion Hotel. The procession formed and, to the music of the United\r\nStates Marine Band, marched to the High Street (Wisconsin Avenue) wharf,\r\nwhere, on board the steamboat _Surprise_ and other boats, they moved up\r\nthe Potomac, until they reached the termination of the old Potomac\r\nCanal, landed, and marched a few hundred yards to canal boats prepared\r\nto receive them. They glided along until they reached the point of\r\ndestination where the old powder magazine stood. On landing, they formed\r\na large circle. The president of the C. & O. Company addressed President\r\nAdams in a brief speech and handed him a spade. After making the speech,\r\nhe attempted to run the spade into the ground, but struck a root. He\r\ntried it again, when a wag in the crowd cried out he had come across a\r\n\"hickory root,\" (allusion to Andrew Jackson, \"Old Hickory,\" and their\r\npolitical campaign).\r\n\r\nHe then threw down the spade, ripped off his coat, and went to work in\r\nearnest. People on the hills around raised loud cheers until their Chief\r\nExecutive overcame the difficulty.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1831, water was let in the canal from the first feeder to the\r\nColumbia Foundry. The loan of $1,500,000 was obtained in Holland through\r\nRichard Rush on the credit of the citizens of Washington, Alexandria,\r\nand Georgetown.\r\n\r\nIt is said that, with the probable exception of General Washington, he\r\ntook more interest in the affairs of the District of Columbia than any\r\nother president. He was largely identified with its material prosperity;\r\nhe owned and operated a flouring mill on Rock Creek, but the project he\r\nwas most zealously interested in was the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. Of\r\ncourse, Mr. Adams had been here some during his father's presidency,\r\nthough he was a man in his thirties then and was much abroad on\r\ndiplomatic missions. He was also Secretary of State in Monroe's\r\nadministration, and after his own term of office as President, served as\r\na representative in Congress until his death.\r\n\r\nA flouring mill which stood at the point where the canal of the old\r\nPotomac Company entered the river, was owned by the Edes family. The\r\nfish caught there were much larger than those caught elsewhere.\r\n\r\nOn the bank of the canal opposite the mill, lived Bull Frizzle, noted\r\nfor his enormous strength. One time, after there was an accident at the\r\nLittle Falls (Chain) Bridge, he crawled under a large beam and prized it\r\nup by the strength of his back, saving the life of the man pinned\r\nunderneath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\n_Along Bridge (M) Street_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bridge over Rock Creek at Bridge (M) Street, was built in 1788, and\r\none night when a storm of wind and rain was raging, gave way while a\r\nstage-coach was passing over it. The coach was precipitated into the\r\nwater but only the driver and the horses were drowned. Ever afterwards\r\nit was said that on stormy nights the ghost of the driver haunted the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nPeter Casanave had a stone house near the bridge and close by was the\r\nhouse of the French's. Mrs. French had been Arianna Scott, sister of\r\nMrs. Robert Peter. The house, which is still remembered by many old\r\nresidents, was a fine, large brick mansion of the prevailing type at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nIt was surrounded by trees--some of them being cherries--and a garden.\r\nOne large room was hung with very unusual paper representing scenes of\r\nIndian life. It is still remembered by a gentleman who lived there when\r\nhe was quite young, who says he remembers passing when the house was\r\nbeing demolished and again admired the very handsome and remarkable\r\npaper. At that time the place was entered by a gate from the\r\nPennsylvania Avenue side, and then there was a flight of steps to reach\r\nM Street on the other side.\r\n\r\nMrs. French evidently owned several houses nearby, for she advertised:\r\n\r\n    For sale or rent:\r\n\r\n    The house opposite the Bank of Columbia lately occupied by Mrs.\r\n    Suter, and the house lately occupied by John M. Gantt, Esqur.,\r\n    adjoining Dr. Weem's house are for sale or rent. The house opposite\r\n    the bank is very eligibly situated for a commercial character having\r\n    an excellent storeroom and counting room with every convenient\r\n    compartment for a private family. The house adjoining Dr. Weems' can\r\n    accomodate very comfortably a small family and from its situation\r\n    will soon be very valuable. The terms of sale or rent may be known\r\n    on application to Dr. Weems.\r\n\r\n    9th January 1799 A. FRENCH.\r\n\r\nAlso, Mrs. Pick had a millinery store just about here.\r\n\r\nOn the corner of Bridge (M) and Greene (29th) Streets, was where David\r\nReintzel lived, who was mayor several times.\r\n\r\nA block or two further west, on the north side of the street, stood the\r\nvery modest home of Jacob Schoofield, the Quaker with whom William Wirt\r\nwas put to board when he was sent in 1779 to George Town to attend\r\nschool. He speaks of how Mrs. Schoofield comforted him the first night\r\nhe was there, a home-sick little boy, by telling him the story, from the\r\nBible, of Joseph being sold by his brother and carried off into Egypt.\r\nHe said \"I remember, also, to have seen a gentleman, Mr. Peter, I think,\r\ngoing out gunning for canvas-backs, then called white-backs, which I\r\nhave seen whitening the Potomac and which, when they arose, as they\r\nsometimes did for half a mile together, produced a sound like thunder.\"\r\n\r\nJust a few doors from this house was the famous Union Tavern, of which I\r\nhave already said so much. The building was standing until a few years\r\nago when it was replaced by a filling station. When it became\r\nCrawford's Hotel after John Suter, Jr., gave it up, again William Wirt\r\ncomes into the picture:\r\n\r\n    Here I am at Crawford's. I am surrounded by a vast crowd of\r\n    legislators and gentlemen assembled for the races, which are to\r\n    commence tomorrow. The races amidst the ruins and desolation of\r\n    Washington.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen used to ride to and from the capitol in a large\r\nstage-coach with seats on top called the \"Royal George.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the other notable guests of the old hostelry were Louis Philippe,\r\nJerome Bonaparte, Talleyrand, ex-Bishop of Autun when he was driven from\r\nFrance, John Adams, when as President in the early summer of 1800, he\r\ncame down to look over his new field; Anthony Merry, Minister from\r\nEngland to the United States; Washington Irving, Count Volney, Humbolt,\r\nthe geographer; Robert Fulton, the inventor of the steamboat; Lorenzo\r\nDow, the eccentric preacher; several young naval officers from the\r\nTripolitan War; and John Randolph of Roanoke. I wonder if it was from\r\nthis old tavern that that brilliant but erratic statesman went out\r\nacross the Chain Bridge to fight his duel with Henry Clay? It is\r\nrecorded by a marker, just at the end of the bridge on the Virginia\r\nside, and reads thus: \"Near here Henry Clay and John Randolph of Roanoke\r\nfought a duel April 8, 1826. Randolph had called Clay a 'Blackleg' in a\r\nspeech. Both men were unhurt, but Randolph's coat was pierced by a\r\nbullet.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Randolph spent the night before the duel in quoting poetry and\r\nplaying whist while his will was being amended.\r\n\r\nJohn Randolph must have liked George Town, for years afterwards when he\r\nlay very ill in his boarding place on Capitol Hill, he insisted on his\r\nbody servant, Juba, getting him some water from George Town, no other\r\nwould do. He called it \"The water of Chios.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Crawford, the proprietor of this hotel, was the principal manager\r\nin the unloading of the records and furniture belonging to the\r\ngovernment when the ships bringing it from Philadelphia docked at Lear's\r\nWharf. Abraham Bradley, who, as Assistant Postmaster General, had charge\r\nof the removal of that department, and Joseph Nourse, who was Registrar\r\nof the Treasury, may also have stopped at Crawford's until settled in\r\ntheir homes.\r\n\r\nJust opposite on the southeast corner of Bridge (M) and Washington\r\n(30th) Streets stood, until 1878, the Presbyterian Church, whose\r\nfounder, Dr. Stephen Bloomer Balch, was its pastor for fifty-two years.\r\nWhen it was first built in 1782, it was only about thirty feet square.\r\nIn 1793 it was enlarged by extending the north front. In 1801-'02, it\r\nwas further enlarged by extending it on the west side. For this purpose\r\nThomas Jefferson helped by subscribing $75.00. In 1806 the trustees of\r\nthe congregation were incorporated by Congress. They were: Stephen B.\r\nBalch, William Whann, James Melvin, John Maffitt, John Peter, Joshua\r\nDawson, James Calder, George Thompson, Richard Elliott, David Wiley, and\r\nAndrew Ross. The first and only elder for some time was James Orme, son\r\nof Reverend John Orme, of Upper Marlborough. In 1821 a new building was\r\nerected. When Dr. Balch died in 1833, he was buried there, but when the\r\ncongregation moved in 1878 and the church was torn down, his remains\r\nwere taken to Oak Hill, where, with the original gravestone, they lie\r\nnot far from the chapel and just north of the grave of John Howard\r\nPayne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH]\r\n\r\nOn the northwest corner of Bridge (M) and Washington (30th) Streets\r\nlived a Mr. Lee; probably Thomas Sim Lee, whose home was the gathering\r\nplace for the Federalists. Just beyond here, still on the north side\r\nwhere the two lovely old carved doorways remain unchanged, are the\r\nhouses once owned by Henry Addison, who served as mayor of the Town from\r\n1845 to 1857 and again from 1861 to 1867. He was a hardware merchant,\r\nand in 1827 it was for him that the first steam fire engine was named.\r\n\r\nMr. Hill lived in one of these houses and next door on the east lived\r\nMr. Vanderwerken. He owned the line of omnibuses that ran along Bridge\r\n(M) Street and over to the city before there were street cars. The\r\nomnibuses bore the names of prominent people.\r\n\r\nThere was a pump in the back yard on the line between these two houses.\r\nOn each side of the fence was a handle on the pump so that it could be\r\nworked by both families. The water flowed smoothly until something\r\ncaused a fuss between the two men, and one day, when Mr. Hill, who was a\r\nvery large man, protruded over the fence, Mr. Vanderwerken got out his\r\nshotgun and peppered his shoulder!\r\n\r\nAcross the street at number 3012 lived John Abbott, who came from\r\nPhiladelphia with the transfer of the government in 1800.\r\n\r\nAt number 3016 lived John Mountz who was Clerk of the Corporation for\r\nsixty-seven years, from the time of its beginning in 1789 up to 1856.\r\n\r\nAcross the street again is the quaint little Stone House which has\r\ncaused so much discussion. For many years tradition had said it was\r\nthere that Major L'Enfant had his headquarters while he was mapping the\r\nnew capital city. Then, someone said it had never been proved. So now we\r\nare waiting for proof. From its looks it was most certainly standing in\r\nthose early days. If only it could speak and tell its own history!\r\n\r\nWe do know it was bought as lot 3 in June, 1762, by John Boone for one\r\npound, ten shillings. Two years later, as he had not improved it, it was\r\nbought by Christopher Leyhman for the same amount, and presumably, a\r\nhouse was built about that time. Apparently, by inheritance, it came to\r\nRachel Furvey (formerly Rachel Leyhman), and in June, 1767, by deed, it\r\nbecame the property of Cassandra Chew, who made it over to her two\r\ndaughters, Harriot, who married Richard Bruce, and Mary, who first\r\nmarried Richard Smith, and later, Mr. Bromley. Mary's daughter, Barbara\r\nSmith, married John Suter, Jr., and they lived in this house. This is\r\nsupposed to have something to do with the claim that has been made that\r\nthis building on lot 3 was Suter's Tavern.\r\n\r\nAlmost next door on the west Mr. Claggett had a house. Again, across the\r\nstreet, on the southeast corner, is the building which, until recent\r\nyears, housed the Farmers and Mechanics Bank. It was founded in 1814.\r\nWhen the Mexican War came, this bank enabled the government to pay the\r\nwar debt. It has now been absorbed by the Riggs National Bank and moved\r\nfurther up the street. Before the building of the bank, John Peter, a\r\nnephew of Robert Peter, had a house on that corner. His house was a\r\nsimple frame one, and back of it he had rabbit warrens and pigeon\r\nhouses. He used to go often in the evenings the short distance to his\r\nuncle Robert's house for a game of whist, of which the old gentleman was\r\nvery fond.\r\n\r\nJust above Bridge (M) Street on Congress (31st) Street stands the\r\nGeorgetown post office, an imposing granite building. It is also the\r\ncustom house of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nNear the corner of Congress (31st) Street lived W. King, and at number\r\n3119 was the house Thomas Corcoran built. He had come from Limerick,\r\nIreland, to Baltimore in 1783 and entered business with his uncle,\r\nWilliam Wilson, there. Soon after his marriage to Hannah Lemon, of\r\nBaltimore County, he came to George Town, intending to go on to\r\nRichmond, but being so impressed with the thriving little town, he\r\ndecided to settle here. He first rented a house on Congress (31st)\r\nStreet below Bridge (M) from Robert Peter, and started a business in\r\nleather. In 1791 he built this three-story house and there lived for\r\nmany years. He was mayor five different terms from 1805, and also\r\nmagistrate and postmaster for fifteen years until his death in 1830. It\r\nwas in this house that a meeting was held in 1817 to found Christ\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nThe Union Bank was on the north side of this block.\r\n\r\nOn the southwest corner of Bridge (M) and High Street (Wisconsin Avenue)\r\nis the site of Gordon's Inspection House, and just west of here in 1791\r\nwere three large tobacco sheds covering three acres. Here was the\r\n\"Warehouse Lot,\" used by circuses when they came to town.\r\n\r\nClose by was the big warehouse of John Laird. It was after his death in\r\n1833 that the trade in tobacco began to decline.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL JAMES MACCUBBIN LINGAN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BENJAMIN STODDERT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: URIAH FORREST]\r\n\r\nFrom 1792 to 1795, number 3221 was the home of Dr. William Thornton, the\r\narchitect of the Capitol; the Octagon House, built by John Tayloe; of\r\nTudor Place, and also of Woodlawn. He was later the first Superintendent\r\nof Patents from 1802 until 1807.\r\n\r\nThe old market stands where there always has been a market. Its upper\r\nstories used to be where the meetings of the Corporation of George Town\r\nwere held.\r\n\r\nAt number 3300 was the home of Paymaster David Whann.\r\n\r\nMidway between Market (33rd) and Frederick (34th) Streets, on the north\r\nside of Bridge (M) Street, General James Maccubbin Lingan had a large\r\npiece of property. I wonder if this advertisement inserted in a\r\nnewspaper on April 22, 1801, describes this very place:\r\n\r\n    The subscriber offers for sale the houses and lots where he now\r\n    resides. The improvements are a commodious dwelling house, office,\r\n    kitchen, wash house, meat house, carriage house, a stable for five\r\n    horses, likewise a large and well cultivated garden and clover lot.\r\n    He will also sell the upper wharf and warehouses, all of which have\r\n    been lately built and well situated for receiving produce that may\r\n    come down the river.\r\n\r\n    J. M. LINGAN.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lingan was of noted Scotch ancestry, the second child of Dr.\r\nLingan. He was born in 1751, in Frederick County, Maryland. On his\r\nmother's side he was related to the Maccubbins, and to the Carrolls of\r\nMaryland. He came to George Town as quite a young man and went directly\r\ninto the tobacco warehouse of a relative. In 1776 he was commissioned a\r\nlieutenant in the army. After the victory of the Battle of Long Island,\r\nhe was captured at Fort Washington on November 16, 1776, his breast\r\nbeing pierced by a bayonet at that time. He was sent as a prisoner\r\naboard the _Jersey_--the \"Hell,\" as she was called. The conditions on\r\nboard were terrific, and many of the prisoners died. When the coffin was\r\nbrought for the body of one of his friends, it was found to be too\r\nshort--the guards started to decapitate the body to make it fit. Young\r\nLingan stood over the body and said he would kill them with his bare\r\nhands. So they brought a larger coffin.\r\n\r\nWhile he was still a prisoner there, his cousin, Admiral Sir Samuel\r\nHood, of His \"Satanic\" Majesty's Navy, as Lingan called it, visited him\r\nand offered him L2,000 (pounds) and high rank in the British Army if he\r\nwould return to his former allegiance. Lingan's answer was, \"I'll rot\r\nhere first!\" And he almost did! He was cooped up in a space so short\r\nthat he could not lie full length, so low that he could not stand erect.\r\nIt was many months after his release before his cramped and agonized\r\nmuscles allowed him to sleep except in an armchair.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for wishing to obtain his defection were, first, the pride,\r\nand perhaps, affection of his connections in England. Lord North,\r\nhimself, was one of these, and his cousin, Zachariah Hood was _persona\r\ngratia_ at the Court of St. James. Also, the affiliations and\r\nconnections of his family in Maryland made his defection greatly to be\r\ndesired. One of his sisters had married Thomas Plater, the son of\r\nGovernor George Plater of Sotterley, and he was also related to the\r\nprominent Carroll family.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the war, General Lingan returned to George Town and\r\nfarmed two estates he owned, both named after battles in which he had\r\nparticipated--Harlem and Middlebrook. He also was appointed collector\r\nof the port by General Washington himself. He was one of the original\r\nmembers of the Order of the Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nIn later years he moved over to the city, his house then being in the\r\nneighborhood of Nineteenth, M and N Streets. He had a wife and children,\r\nmany friends, and all was going well with him until the election year of\r\n1812. General Lingan was a Federalist in politics. The party organ was\r\n_The Federal Republican_, published in Baltimore and edited by Alexander\r\nContee Hanson, whose wife was a near relative of Nicholas Lingan, the\r\nbrother of James.\r\n\r\nWar with England was declared on Friday, the 19th of June, 1812, and\r\nnext day an editorial appeared in _The Federal Republican_, which was\r\nlike a match set to a powder train. On Sunday, public meetings were held\r\nadvocating the suppression of the paper, and on Monday, three or four\r\nhundred men and boys assembled at the office of the paper at Gay and\r\nSecond Streets, in Baltimore, and destroyed the furniture and the house.\r\n\r\nThe staff then removed to Georgetown where, although it was threatened\r\nfrom both Baltimore and Washington, it continued to publish the paper\r\nuntil July 26th, when Mr. Hanson went back to Baltimore to a small house\r\non South Charles Street, accompanied by General Lingan, John Howard\r\nPayne, General Henry (\"Light Horse Harry\") Lee, and others. On the\r\nfollowing day the paper was issued from that office, though it had been\r\nprinted in Georgetown. It contained an attack on the State authorities\r\nfor the outrage of June 22nd. This time the mob that gathered brought\r\narms and ammunition. The twenty-seven gentlemen assembled in the office\r\nwere also armed, \"to defend the rights of person, and property, and the\r\nliberty of the press.\" At first only stones were used by the assailants,\r\nanswered by volleys of blank cartridges. After scenes almost fantastic\r\nin fury, the gentlemen were finally overcome and marched to gaol for\r\nsafety. But after dark another mob gathered round the gaol, and\r\novercoming the guard, broke in. Mr. Gwynn pushed his way through a group\r\nof fifty men to General Lingan who was being knocked down by clubs, then\r\njerked up to be knocked down again, while the outside ring of men\r\nbellowed, \"Tory! Tory!\" The only word General Lingan spoke to the mob\r\nwas, when tearing open his shirt, he displayed the mark of the Hessian\r\nbayonet, still purple, and exclaimed, \"Does this look as if I was a\r\ntraitor?\" Just then a stone struck the scar and he fell. As the last\r\nbreath left his body, he murmured to a friend near by, \"I am a dying\r\nman--save yourself.\"\r\n\r\nOn this side of Bridge (M) Street, adjoining what was then Bank Street\r\nstood the Bank of Columbia, when it moved from a few blocks east. From\r\nold pictures, it looks much more like a stately home than a bank, and\r\npart of it was used as his home by William Whann, the cashier. Set far\r\nback on the hill, with columns on its facade and a Greek pediment, it\r\nwas very handsome. Its first president was Samuel Blodgett; its second,\r\nGeneral John Mason of Analostan Island. Across the street he had his\r\ntown house.\r\n\r\nTo this bank one day late in 1814, while he was Secretary of State, came\r\nJames Monroe, on horseback, and asking for William Whann, told him that\r\nthe government was entirely out of funds, and wanted a loan with which\r\nto dispatch General Andrew Jackson to New Orleans. Mr. Monroe pledged\r\nhis own private fortune that the debt would be paid, and the money was\r\nturned over to him. The government at that time was not strong enough\r\nto levy heavier taxes for the conduct of the war with England, which was\r\nvery unpopular in the New England States.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of New Orleans was fought on January 8, 1815--two weeks after\r\npeace had come--for a Treaty of Peace had been signed on Christmas Eve,\r\nand the great loss of life on the English side might have been avoided.\r\n\r\nJust beyond here on the corner, Mr. Thompson had a residence, and still\r\na little further lived Mr. Warren. Just opposite, at number 3350, is one\r\nof the oldest houses in Georgetown and one of the most notable, for here\r\nColonel Uriah Forrest was living in 1791 when on March 29th he gave that\r\nmemorable dinner, referred to by General Washington, when the\r\narrangements were made for the purchase of land on which to build the\r\nnew City of Washington.\r\n\r\nWhat a scene that must have been! One can imagine the turtle soup, the\r\nfish and terrapin caught fresh from the river, wild ducks and ham with\r\nshoulders of mutton and all the vegetables and hot breads and other\r\ndelectable foods for which Maryland is famous--for Uriah Forrest,\r\nhimself a Marylander, had a Maryland wife, Rebecca Plater, the daughter\r\nof Governor Plater, whose home was Sotterley, in Saint Mary's County.\r\n\r\nIn 1792 Colonel Forrest was mayor of George Town. Not long after this,\r\nColonel Forrest purchased a large tract of land lying north of the town\r\nand there he built a country home which he called Rosedale, and to which\r\nhe eventually retired for his permanent home. His descendants, the\r\nGreens, lived on at Rosedale until not so very many years ago. One of\r\nthem, Mr. George Green, sold to President Cleveland, in his first\r\nadministration, a stone cottage on the Rosedale estate which the\r\nPresident remodeled and made his summer home. It was called Red Top,\r\nfrom its turreted red roof, but its real name was Oak View. From it, the\r\nsuburb, Cleveland Park, derives its name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM MARBURY]\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland, in his second administration, used Woodley for his summer\r\nhome. It had been a part of the Rosedale tract, and the house was built\r\nby Philip Barton Key, a brother-in-law of Colonel Forrest, for he also\r\nhad married a Miss Plater.\r\n\r\nMr. Key moved out of town and resided at Woodley, where he dispensed\r\nlavish hospitality until his death in 1817. Thomas Plater also had moved\r\nout from George Town and lived near by. He was the executor for Philip\r\nBarton Key. After Mr. Key's death, his widow went back into town and\r\ntook up her residence on the corner of Gay (N) and Congress (31st)\r\nStreets.\r\n\r\nAfter Colonel Forrest left the house on Bridge (M) Street, it was bought\r\nby William Marbury, who had come to Georgetown from Annapolis. He was a\r\njustice of the peace, a very responsible and honorable office in those\r\ndays. It was in connection with his reappointment to the office that the\r\ncontroversy arose which resulted in the famous law case of MARBURY\r\n_versus_ MADISON, as James Madison, in his capacity as Secretary of\r\nState to Thomas Jefferson, was the Madison involved. The prominence of\r\nthe case was because it was the first of those great opinions handed\r\ndown by Chief Justice John Marshall in which he decided that the Supreme\r\nCourt has the power to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHILIP BARTON KEY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. PHILIP BARTON KEY (ELIZABETH PLATER)]\r\n\r\nIn 1814 Mr. Marbury became the first president of the Farmers and\r\nMechanics Bank when it was organized; its cashier being Clement Smith,\r\nwho, after the presidency of Thomas B. Beall, from 1817-1821, became the\r\nthird president, and the only one in the history of that institution to\r\nbe promoted to that office. Not many years ago, Mr. Marbury's picture,\r\nin his old-fashioned costume, was printed on the bank checks to impress\r\nthe public with the antiquity of the institution.\r\n\r\nHe was a very imposing looking gentleman, as was his son, John Marbury,\r\nwho was eight years old when the family moved to Georgetown. Some years\r\nago, one of his great-grandsons heard the family talking about\r\n\"Grandfather's Bourbon nose.\" A little later he was found standing,\r\ngazing intently at the portrait of the old gentleman, and when asked,\r\n\"Why such sudden interest?\" he replied, \"Where is the 'burb' on his\r\nnose?\"\r\n\r\nJohn Marbury married and lived for some years on Gay (N) Street, near\r\nMarket (33rd) Street. After his father's death, he moved to the old\r\nhouse on Bridge (M) Street in order to keep his mother company. He had a\r\nvery large family, seven sons and six daughters. All of the daughters\r\nattended Miss English's Seminary, walking to and from school all winter\r\nwearing low-necked and short-sleeved dresses, covered only by a little\r\ncape. Not a case of poverty, I assure you, but of fashion! I was told\r\nthis not long ago by a descendant, and of how they used to have to melt\r\ntheir gum shoes to get them on in cold weather. I think the names of a\r\ntrio of their friends very amusing--Jerry Berry, Hetty Getty, and Jimmy\r\nFinney.\r\n\r\nThe house had a large garden in the rear and spacious rooms where they\r\nentertained a great deal. Not long ago, I saw a fascinating drawing of\r\na party in Georgetown in the fifties. It represented four musicians\r\nintent upon playing a bass viol, a cello, a violin, and a flute; a few\r\nof the company standing near by with curls and puffed coiffures, and\r\namong them a tiny man, side-whiskered, so short that he barely reached\r\nthe shoulders of the ladies. He must, of course, have been Prince\r\nIturbide. There was never anyone quite like him. He was a Mexican, here\r\nin the diplomatic service, and had married Miss Alice Green, a\r\ngranddaughter of Uriah Forrest.\r\n\r\nAt a party one evening at the Marbury's, a dispute arose between him and\r\nBaron Bodisco, the Russian Minister, who was also a resident of\r\nGeorgetown. It ended in the prince calling the baron a liar, whereby the\r\nbaron immediately knocked Prince Iturbide down. The little prince sprang\r\nonto a sofa and bounced up and down, shouting over and over again, \"He\r\nknocked an Iturbide down; he knocked an Iturbide down!\" as if he\r\nexpected Mr. Marbury to straightway haul the baron off to be beheaded,\r\nat least. It was the last party given at the old house for many a day,\r\nas Mr. Marbury considered that they had been disgraced by their guests.\r\n\r\nYears after, when Madame Iturbide was left a widow in Mexico, the\r\nEmperor Maximilian wished to adopt her son, to which she gave her\r\nconsent, but finding later that it meant complete separation from him,\r\nshe kidnapped him and escaped to America.\r\n\r\nFor two whole days after the Battle of Bull Run, the \"Damn Yankees,\" as\r\nthe Marburys called them, poured over the nearby bridge from Virginia at\r\na dog-trot and dropped from exhaustion on the steps of this house and\r\nthe pavement. Mr. Marbury ordered all of the shutters to be kept tightly\r\nclosed during that dreadful time.\r\n\r\nA little granddaughter of his, living there, went one day with a friend\r\nof hers to place flowers on the grave of a child of Jefferson Davis in\r\nOak Hill Cemetery. They were arrested, and when it was discovered who\r\nshe was, soldiers were sent to search the house. Mrs. Marbury had some\r\nletters from her nephews in the Confederate Army, and she hurriedly\r\nsewed them up in a chair, for she said the boys might be killed and she\r\nhated to destroy their letters. Many, many years after, on a summer day\r\nin the garret of an old house, not far from Leesburg, Virginia, three of\r\nMrs. Marbury's great-grandchildren ripped them out of their long hiding\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nJust a few doors west of this interesting old house stood another,\r\nsomewhat smaller, which, until a few years ago, was in its original\r\nstate of preservation. Now it has gone! It was the home of the author of\r\nour National Anthem. Here Francis Scott Key lived for twenty years. Here\r\nhis eleven children were born, while he served three terms as District\r\nAttorney and engaged in the private practice of law.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows the story of how, hearing of the arrest of a friend, Dr.\r\nWilliam Beanes, by the British, in the War of 1812, Mr. Key made the\r\ntrip to Baltimore to see what he could do to help the old gentleman, who\r\nhad done some very rash talking down in Prince Georges County. Mr. Key\r\nwas a connection of Mrs. Beanes', who was a member of the Plater family.\r\n\r\nMr. Key went on board the British man-of-war, under the command of\r\nAdmiral Cockburn, called _The Red Devil of the Chesapeake_, lying\r\nopposite Fort McHenry, but was told by the captain that he would have to\r\nspend the night on board as a bombardment was about to take place.\r\nImagine his sensations all through the night--no wonder that he burst\r\nforth into such a poem of love for his flag when he came on deck in the\r\nearly morning and saw it \"still there!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME OF FRANCIS SCOTT KEY]\r\n\r\nPoetry was only a side issue with Mr. Key. I have often thought how\r\ninteresting it is that a man may work all the days of his life at his\r\nprofession or vocation, and some avocation, like verse-making, may carry\r\nhis name down to posterity; like Izaak Walton, who had an insurance\r\nbusiness in London, but is remembered now only as a fisherman.\r\n\r\nDon't you imagine Mr. Key would have been amazed if he could have had a\r\nvision of the years to come, when on parade grounds all over this great\r\nland at sunset, every day, troops stand immovable at attention while the\r\nemblem of their country is being lowered for the night, and the strains\r\nof the music of his poem thrill all who hear it? \"The Star-Spangled\r\nBanner\" was first read by Mr. Key at a meeting of the George Town Glee\r\nClub.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANCIS SCOTT KEY]\r\n\r\nFrancis Scott Key was a nephew of Philip Barton Key, and a vestryman,\r\nlike his uncle, of Saint John's Church. He was a fine, humanitarian\r\ngentleman. In a recent book, called _Father Takes Us to Washington_, he\r\nis accused of having treated his dozen slaves in a terrible manner. His\r\ngreat-grandson has just come out with a refutation of such treatment and\r\nsaid that Mr. Key freed all of his slaves before his death in 1843 and\r\nthat he was one of the founders of the American Colonization Society,\r\nwhich had for its purpose the freedom of the Negroes and their\r\ncolonization on the West Coast of Africa. Of course, it was in James\r\nMonroe's administration that Liberia was founded and its capital named\r\nMonrovia.\r\n\r\nIn later life, Francis Scott Key moved to Frederick, Maryland, where he\r\nlies buried. The beautiful new bridge, only a stone's throw from his\r\nhome, bears his name. It replaces the aqueduct bridge which was built\r\nabout 1880, and before that, there was a bridge which carried the canal\r\nacross the river to continue on its way to Alexandria. I cannot remember\r\nit, but I have been told that, looking across from the Virginia side, it\r\nwas a very picturesque sight with its long arches reaching above the\r\nbridge, carrying its dripping load beneath, and standing against the\r\nwestern sky, the towers of Georgetown College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\n_High Street, Prospect Avenue, the College, the Convent, and the\r\nThrelkelds_\r\n\r\n\r\nUp the hill from Bridge (M) Street on the east side of High Street\r\n(Wisconsin Avenue), a door or two above where the Farmers and Mechanics\r\nBranch of Riggs Bank now stands, was a fine old house where the Potomac\r\nFire Insurance Company had its first home. But long before that, it was\r\nthe home of Mrs. Caperton, whose son, Hugh Caperton, became a well-known\r\nlawyer here.\r\n\r\nAt the present 1239 Wisconsin Avenue, where Becker's Paint Store has\r\nbeen for a good many years, was the house which Robert Peter gave to his\r\neldest daughter, Elizabeth, when, at the age of sixteen, she married her\r\ncousin, James Dunlop, in 1787. This old letter gives some news about the\r\nwedding.\r\n\r\nIt is addressed to: John Davidson, Esq., Merchant, Annapolis:\r\n\r\n    George Town August 17th, 1787\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n    Without any ceremony or preamble I have undertaken to enclose you\r\n    the measure for a pair of Stays, not that I suppose that you are to\r\n    make them, but that you may undertake to engage Mrs. Davidson's\r\n    interest to undertake the direction of them.\r\n\r\n    They are for a daughter of mine who is tollerably nice, and she will\r\n    not consent to trust the business entirely to the Staymaker, nor,\r\n    it seems, to any other Lady in Annapolis but Mrs. Davidson, so that\r\n    you see what a deal of trouble I have brought her into, by having\r\n    often observed in my daughter's hearing how that Mrs. Davidson\r\n    seemed to me to be in all things about her Family, in short the Girl\r\n    has taken it into her head that she is old enough to become a wife,\r\n    and does not only beg of Mrs. Davidson to direct as to her Stays,\r\n    but wishes she would take the trouble of procuring some Paterns of\r\n    silks fit and suitable for what they call a Wedding Gown, with the\r\n    prices paid or annexed to the Patterns, and when the choice is made\r\n    I suppose the next favor will be of Mrs. Davidson to direct as to\r\n    the making of it. Mrs. Davidson must take the cause of all this\r\n    trouble to herself, for if she did not merit the charge she would\r\n    not have had the trouble. I am just now interrupted by receiving a\r\n    further commission, to wit for a crepe cushion made by the best and\r\n    most fashionable Barber in Annapolis, and a lock of the color wanted\r\n    is enclosed. I want everything good and fashionable, but you know we\r\n    old Fellows like everything as cheap as they can be got to have them\r\n    good. I leave everything to yours and Mrs. Davidson's good\r\n    management, but, at the same time, it would appear as if there was\r\n    some expedition. The samples and prices of the silk I will be\r\n    obliged by your sending by post, the Stays and Cushion perhaps you\r\n    may be able to forward by Miss Patty Lingan who will be coming down\r\n    in nine or ten days, as I am informed. I am just now tortured with\r\n    black guard consignment business and therefore I conclude by\r\n    remaining Your Very Humble Servant,\r\n\r\n    ROBERT PETER.\r\n\r\nThey were married in October and had eight children, all but one of whom\r\nlived to maturity.\r\n\r\nIn 1792, five years after their marriage, James Dunlop bought an estate\r\nof 700 acres known as \"Hayes,\" seven miles out in Montgomery County;\r\nthis later became their permanent residence. It had been built in 1762\r\nby the Reverend Alexander Williamson, rector of Rock Creek Church (now\r\nSt. Paul's), until he resigned in 1776, being a Tory. In history, he is\r\ncalled the \"Sporting Parson\" because of his love for fox-hunting and\r\ncock-fighting.\r\n\r\nThe back lawn of this house was the bowling green and the old balls are\r\nstill in the attic there. Also, there is still there an old rose bush\r\nbearing small white roses, which was planted by Elizabeth Peter Dunlop.\r\nThis was my summer home when I was a girl and is now in possession of my\r\neldest brother.\r\n\r\nJust above number 1239 is the crook in High Street (Wisconsin Avenue)\r\nand, until a few years ago, I never knew why it was that way: actually,\r\nit follows the line of the grant of the Rock of Dumbarton, which was\r\nsurveyed that way. The reason the streets on the west side of High\r\nStreet (Wisconsin Avenue) don't match those on the east side is because\r\nthey were laid out by different owners.\r\n\r\nJust about here is the Aged Woman's Home, standing high above the\r\nstreet. It was founded in 1868 with a gift of $15,000 from Mr. W. W.\r\nCorcoran. It houses fourteen women. In all these years there have been\r\nonly three Presidents of the Board: Mrs. Beverley Kennon, Miss Emily\r\nNourse, and the present one, Mrs. Louis Freeman. The back part of the\r\nhouse is what is left of the home of John Lutz, who had a good deal of\r\nland around his house when he built it nearly two hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nIn days gone by, the Aged Woman's Home was partly supported by\r\ncontributions collected by women who were members of the Benevolent\r\nSociety, who went from door to door with a book in which amounts to be\r\ngiven were subscribed.\r\n\r\nOn the southeast corner of High Street (Wisconsin Avenue) and Gay (N)\r\nStreet, just above here has been conducted, since 1861, the grocery\r\nbusiness of H. W. Fisher and Son, first was the grandfather, known as\r\nHenry, whom I remember, with a long grey beard; then his son of the same\r\nname, known as Wellen, and now his son, Henry. I am told by an old\r\nresident that the first telephone in Georgetown was in the Fisher's\r\nstore, as it is known, and that when people wanted to phone, they went\r\nthere and used it.\r\n\r\nI was fed from Fisher's all my young life, and I imagine my father was\r\none of their best customers, as he had eleven children and multitudes of\r\nrelatives in Maryland and Virginia, who came to stay whenever they\r\nwished to visit Washington City. So you can rather imagine the\r\nconsternation of the elder Mr. Fisher when, one hot afternoon, as he was\r\nclearing out his crate of tomatoes just before closing time and, as was\r\nthe custom in those long ago days, picked up a large, over-ripe one and\r\nthrew it out, as he supposed into the gutter, that, instead, it landed\r\non the stiff \"boiled shirt\" bosom of Mr. George T. Dunlop! I never knew\r\nof this occurrence until I was told of it many years after by Mr. Wellen\r\nFisher, who said his father always said it never made any difference to\r\nMr. Dunlop.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of High Street (Wisconsin Avenue), coming up from\r\nBridge (M) Street, on the corner was the hardware store of Edward M.\r\nLinthicum; later Henry Addison had a dry goods store there.\r\n\r\nA little farther up, in the nineties, was Joe Schladt's, the saloon of\r\nthe Town. We all knew about it, but, of course, no lady ever entered it.\r\nThere were, however, three or four very well-known gentlemen who entered\r\nit very frequently, and had a good deal of difficulty reaching their\r\nhomes every evening.\r\n\r\nThen we come to 1254 Wisconsin Avenue, Stohlman's, which, ever since\r\n1820, has dispensed a very different form of refreshment--ice cream.\r\nFirst it was Arnold's Bakery, then, in 1845, the business was sold to\r\nMr. and Mrs. May; then, in 1865, to Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Stohlman, she\r\nbeing the niece of Mrs. May; then to J. William Stohlman, father of the\r\npresent owner by the same name, and they are still serving the \"elite of\r\nGeorgetown\" not only with ice cream, but other dainties. Back in my\r\ngirlhood it was \"quite the thing\" to go down to Stohlman's and have a\r\nsaucer of ice cream in the back parlor at one of the little\r\nmarble-topped tables.\r\n\r\nRight next door is Forrest Hall. Here, at one corner of the property,\r\nwas one of the original stones marking the northern border of Georgetown\r\nwhen it was surveyed, No. 46. On this lot stood the Union Bank and then,\r\nin 1855, Bladen Forrest, (not a descendant of Colonel Uriah Forrest),\r\nbuilt this large and very good-looking building.\r\n\r\nThe enlisted men of the battalion of the Second U. S. Infantry were\r\nquartered in Forrest Hall for a time at the beginning of the Civil War.\r\nLater it was used as a hospital for Union soldiers. After that, the\r\nGeorgetown Assemblies were held there for several years, and various\r\nother affairs. I remember a fete called a \"Chocolatere\" when I was a\r\nlittle girl, and going to it with my mother, and seeing three pretty\r\ngirls dressed in Japanese costume singing \"Three Little Girls from\r\nSchool Are We.\" I think that was not so very long after the _Mikado_\r\nmade its debut.\r\n\r\nOn the northwest corner of High Street (Wisconsin Avenue) and Prospect\r\nStreet, the building which has an interesting cornice and roof is where\r\nW. W. Corcoran started his career, in the dry goods business.\r\n\r\nJust beyond was a market; I think it was called a \"Farmers' and\r\nButchers' Market,\" an offshoot of the old Market on Bridge (M) Street. I\r\nremember going there when I was a little girl with my mother, and her\r\nbuying vegetables from a Dutch woman, Mrs. Hight. I have always\r\nremembered her rosy, smiling face, and her stall of gay, vari-colored\r\nvegetables. She had a farm out on the Rockville Pike, and I think of it\r\nsometimes when I pass.\r\n\r\nHigh Street (Wisconsin Avenue) nowadays has become the center of antique\r\nshops, there are many of them, also now there are dress shops and\r\naccessories of all kinds.\r\n\r\nThen we go along Prospect Street, which was named for the tract of land\r\nbelonging to Benjamin Stoddert, called \"Pretty Prospect.\"\r\n\r\nOn the corners of Potomac Street are two quaint, little houses. On the\r\nsoutheast corner of Frederick (34th) and Prospect Streets stands an\r\napartment house, which, before a false front was added a few years ago\r\nwhen it was converted, was the dignified brick house where Benjamin\r\nStoddert lived and entertained in most hospitable style.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BENJAMIN STODDERT'S HOUSE]\r\n\r\nHe named his home \"Halcyon House,\" and what a suitable and lovely name\r\nfor one in his business, and one who had settled here after his service\r\nin the Revolution. For the halcyon was a fabled bird, whose nest floated\r\nupon the sea. It had the power of charming winds and waves, hence,\r\n\"halcyon days\" are days of tranquillity and peace. He had married\r\nRebecca Loundes, the daughter of Christopher Loundes, of Bladensburg.\r\nThey had several children. Mrs. Stoddert writes thusly of them on a\r\nday when they must have been particularly trying:\r\n\r\n    I wonder that you can be so anxious to see my children, for a parcel\r\n    of rude, disagreeable brats as ever was born, except the two\r\n    youngest.\r\n\r\nShe writes another letter on the 15th of December, 1799, in which she is\r\nevidently condoling with someone, and says she \"hopes Nancy was not\r\ndisappointed at having a fine girl;\" she is sure of \"Richard's feelings\r\non the subject, for the men always are, if they would but own it, after\r\nhaving one daughter, all but sons are unwelcome.\" She goes on to say,\r\n\"But they may comfort themselves, but I will be security that the next\r\none will be a son.\"\r\n\r\nWhat marvelous necromancy this lady must have possessed--in her own\r\nopinion--worth a gold mine if it could really be true!\r\n\r\nFrom his southern dormer windows, tradition says, Major Stoddert used to\r\nwatch with his telescope for the coming of some of those ships that he\r\nand Colonel Forrest and Colonel Murdock sent out across the ocean.\r\n\r\nOn May 17, 1798, he was appointed Secretary of the Navy, being the first\r\nto hold that position, and so remained until March 1, 1807.\r\n\r\nOn May 29, 1800, he wrote thusly from Philadelphia (where he was engaged\r\nby his cabinet duties), to his near neighbor, John Templeman, on the\r\ncorner just one block west of him, the old house which stood for so\r\nmany, many years unoccupied:\r\n\r\n    Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n    The Pres. will be at Washington by the time you receive this, or a\r\n    day or two after. He proposes to stay but a little while. I wish he\r\n    would remain longer. This and other good things will depend on the\r\n    manner of employing his time. I request, therefore, that setting\r\n    Bashfulness at defiance, you will urge the Pres. to go to the balls,\r\n    to ride with you in your coach, and to get Mr. Scott at least to go\r\n    with you. Let the Pres. be pleased with the attention and with the\r\n    country.\r\n\r\n    I am resp. yrs.,\r\n\r\n    BEN STODDERT.\r\n\r\n    Barring accidents, I expect to be in Geo. Town the 14th of June.\r\n\r\nAfter Benjamin Stoddert's death, this house was given by William Whann\r\nas a wedding present to his only child, Anna Maria, on her marriage to\r\nBenjamin Mackall, the son of Leonard Mackall. Their son, General William\r\nW. Mackall, was a graduate of West Point in the class with General\r\nGrant. He served with distinction in the Mexican War and later in the\r\nConfederate Army. Shortly after the close of the Civil War, General\r\nGrant gave a reception at the White House to the Aztec Society, composed\r\nof officers who served in the War with Mexico and their descendants.\r\nGeneral Mackall went to it clad in his grey uniform and was most\r\ncordially received by his old comrades.\r\n\r\nStill later than the Mackalls, this house was occupied by Mr. Martineau,\r\nMinister from the Netherlands, and then by the Pairo family.\r\n\r\nTo return to Mr. Templeman's house which he built about 1788. He was\r\npresident of the Bank of Columbia; also an owner of ships, and, as a\r\nside issue, had:\r\n\r\n    For Sale--At John Templeman's Store.\r\n       Whisky, Firkin Butter, Linseed Oil, and Flour.\r\n    George Town June 20, 1800.\r\n\r\nThose ships which carried tobacco across 3,000 miles of ocean didn't\r\nfill their holds with bricks as ballast on the way back, as we used to\r\nbe told; there were too many better things needed here. And there was\r\nplenty of clay right here to burn brick. Even in the early days of\r\nJamestown there were brick factories of which there are records and\r\n\"English Brick\" meant made by specifications of English brick.\r\n\r\nThe Templeman family lived here for three generations until the Civil\r\nWar. Then it belonged to Franklin Steele, whose three daughters were\r\nMrs. Morris, Mrs. Arthur Addison, and Mrs. Edward Macaulay.\r\n\r\n\"Old Mrs. Morris,\" as she was called, lived there many years alone and\r\nwas always complaining to my father that the new building of the Capital\r\nTraction Company was undermining her house and was knocking it down. It\r\nstill stands firm. It was finally \"done over\" a few years ago, and\r\neventually bought by James E. Forrestal, when he became Secretary of the\r\nNavy, and was still his home when he resigned as our first Secretary of\r\nDefense, and then ended his life tragically May 12, 1949, by leaping\r\nfrom a window of the Naval Hospital at Bethesda.\r\n\r\nThe house was leased for two or three years to the Government and called\r\n\"Prospect House.\" It was used by the State Department as a \"guest\r\nhouse,\" where such honored persons as the Shah of Iran, Monsieur Vincent\r\nAuriol, President of France, and several Presidents of Latin American\r\ncountries, and other officials, stayed. The State Department often used\r\nit for dinner parties. Its garden which used to be terraced down to the\r\nriver, and quaint little gazebo are still lovely. It has recently been\r\npurchased by Representative Thurmond Chatham of North Carolina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME OF DR. CHARLES WORTHINGTON]\r\n\r\nJust across from Mr. Templeman's house on the northeast corner is one of\r\nthe loveliest houses left in Georgetown. It stood for many years\r\nunchanged and unoccupied until a few years ago, when it was bought by\r\nSir Wilmott Lewis, the representative in Washington for a long time of\r\nthe _London Times_.\r\n\r\nIt was built by John Thomson Mason, (not General John Mason, whose home\r\nwas on Bridge Street). It was acquired in 1810 by Dr. Charles\r\nWorthington, who came to George Town in 1783 from Sumner Hill in Anne\r\nArundel County. He previously owned a house on the southwest corner of\r\nBridge (M) and Market (33rd) Streets, and, later on, bought this house.\r\nHe called his home \"Quality Hill.\" His family lived there for many years\r\nuntil about 1856, when they moved up to the Heights and bought a house\r\non Road Street. The family of James Kearney lived there then, until\r\nabout twenty years ago. Dr. Worthington was one of the original members\r\nof Saint John's Church and first president of the District of Columbia\r\nMedical Society.\r\n\r\nDr. Charles Worthington was an austere man, very dignified and serious.\r\nTo his latest day, he dressed in the old style; his hair in queue, knee\r\nbreeches, long stockings, and buckles on his shoes. He drove a\r\ncoach-and-four when going to his country place out on the Seventh Street\r\nRoad near Brightwood. He was a man of great ability and zeal. He lived\r\nto be 76 years old, having practiced medicine 55 years. His son,\r\nNicholas, followed in his profession.\r\n\r\nAnother block westward on this street stood Prospect Cottage, a charming\r\nlittle home where Mrs. E. D. E. N. Southworth lived in the sixties and\r\nwrote her many novels--one for every year of her life. This house was\r\nfor a time the home of the League of American Pen Women.\r\n\r\nJust about a block northward stands Holy Trinity Catholic Church,\r\nreferred to sometimes in old newspapers as The Roman Church. The present\r\nlarge edifice, facing on Lingan (36th) Street, was first built in 1849,\r\nbut the original church is the small building at the back of it, high up\r\nfrom First (N) Street. The earliest marriage recorded there is April 6,\r\n1795; the first baptism, May 14, 1795, signed by Reverend Francis Neale,\r\nS. J., who was the first pastor. But the lot had been purchased some\r\nyears before by Bishop Carroll.\r\n\r\nThe building was erected by Alexander Doyle, putting in his own means in\r\naddition to contributions from others. This church was virtually owned\r\nby the college and was used for the college commencements until 1832.\r\n\r\nGeorgetown College, now a university, stands like a fortress at the\r\nwestern boundary of the town. Its lovely chimes float out over the town\r\nat every quarter of the hour. Only one of the original buildings in old,\r\nred brick still stands behind the grey stone modern halls. The north\r\nbuilding was put up first, and by 1797, students began to lodge in it.\r\nThere were 57 boarders at that time. The college was opened in 1789--its\r\nfounder being John Carroll, a member of the famous Maryland family, who\r\nwas consecrated Bishop at Lulworth Castle in England, but returned\r\nimmediately to this country. There is a fine seated statue of him just\r\nin front of the main building. In 1806 it passed under the control of\r\nthe Jesuits, and in 1815, it was raised to the rank of a university. The\r\nobservatory of Georgetown, founded by Reverend James Curley in 1842, is\r\none of the oldest in this country.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 Jonathan Elliot wrote of the college:\r\n\r\n    On entering the College, every pupil shall pay ten dollars. He shall\r\n    bring a mattress, a pillow, two pillow cases, two pairs of sheets,\r\n    four blankets and a counterpane, or pay $6.00 per annum for the use\r\n    of bed and bedding. He must also bring with him one suit of clothes,\r\n    as a uniform--which is in winter a blue cloth coat and pantaloons\r\n    with a black velvet waistcoat; in summer white pantaloons with a\r\n    black silk waistcoat are used. He must likewise bring with him two\r\n    suits for daily wear, for which no particular color is prescribed;\r\n    six shirts, six pairs of stockings, six pocket handkerchiefs, three\r\n    pairs of shoes, a hat and a cloak or great coat, also a silver\r\n    spoon. These articles if not brought by the student will be\r\n    furnished by the College and included in the first bill.\r\n\r\n    The pension for board, washing, mending and mending materials, use\r\n    of books (philosophical and mathematical excepted), pens, ink, and\r\n    writing paper, slates and pencil, is $150. Medical aid and medicine,\r\n    unless parents choose to run the risk of a doctor's bill in case of\r\n    sickness, $3.00 per annum. All charges must be paid half-yearly in\r\n    advance.\r\n\r\n    With regard to pocket money it is desired that all students should\r\n    be placed on an equality and that it should not exceed 12-1/2 cents\r\n    per week; and whatever is allowed must be deposited in the hands of\r\n    the directors of the College. Half-boarders are received on the\r\n    usual terms, viz. $5 entrance and $65 for board per annum.\r\n\r\n    Day scholars $5 for fuel and servants, as no charge is made for\r\n    tuition. The College has been established 45 years and not a single\r\n    death has taken place among the students.\r\n\r\nThis was in spite of the fact that the young men, winter and summer,\r\nwashed at the pump!\r\n\r\nEarly in 1861 several volunteer regiments, including the 69th New York\r\nand the 79th Pennsylvania Regiments, arrived in Georgetown. The 69th\r\nwas mustered into service in the grounds of Georgetown College, where it\r\nwas afterwards quartered. The 79th Pennsylvania Regiment was clad in\r\ntheir distinctive Scottish kilts, plaids, and striped stockings, and had\r\na band of pipers at their head.\r\n\r\nThe Georgetown College students showed where their sympathies were by an\r\nostentatious display of a badge fastened upon the lapel of the\r\ncoat--tri-color for the Union, and blue for disunion.\r\n\r\nJust west of the college used to be a pond which was a very popular\r\nresort for skaters in the winter season.\r\n\r\nNot far away is another well-known Catholic institution, for the\r\neducation of the other sex--the oldest Visitation Convent in the\r\ncountry--having on its list of alumnae many well-known names.\r\n\r\nWhen Father Neale came from Philadelphia to George Town in 1798 to\r\nbecome president of the college, he found living on Fayette (35th)\r\nStreet, near by, three ladies belonging to the Order of Poor Clares.\r\nThis order was founded in Assisi long ago by Sister Clare, a devoted\r\nfriend of Saint Francis of Assisi, and is similar to the Franciscans.\r\nThe three ladies were members of the French nobility who had been driven\r\nfrom their convent in France during the Revolution in 1793 and, coming\r\nto this country, had set up a little convent not far from the college.\r\nThey attempted to keep a school as a means of support, but had a very\r\ndifficult time. Once, it is told, they were reduced to such poverty that\r\nthey had to sell a parrot, which they had as a pet, in order to save\r\nthemselves from starvation. These women, barefooted, according to the\r\nrule of their order, came of noble blood and had been born to luxury.\r\nOne of them was Mary de la Marche, who advertised in the newspaper\r\nsalves and eyewashes for sale.\r\n\r\nIn 1799 Father Neale sent back to Philadelphia for three devoted\r\nreligious friends from Ireland, who wished to found a convent. They were\r\nAlice Tabor, Maria McDermott, and Louise Sharpe. For a few months they\r\nboarded with the Poor Clares, but a little later Father Neale bought a\r\nhouse and lot nearby and installed them in it. They became known as The\r\nPious Ladies. On May 18, 1801, Mary de la Marche advertised the two\r\nhouses of the Poor Clares for sale, but apparently they did not sell\r\nthem at that time, for, in 1804, after the death of the Abbess, Madame\r\nde la Rochefoucault, who succeeded her, sold the convent to Bishop\r\nNeale, and the remaining ladies returned to France.\r\n\r\nThe Pious Ladies slowly increased in numbers, keeping their school and\r\nstruggling against poverty, all the time endeavoring to become\r\nestablished as members of the Visitation Order. At last their hope and\r\nambition came to pass, and, in 1816, they were regularly established as\r\nthe Georgetown Visitation Convent.\r\n\r\nAcross the street from the Convent grounds, a lovely big meadow until it\r\nwas partly taken over in World War II for a housing project, are the\r\nVolta Bureau for the Deaf and two interesting houses.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gilbert Grosvenor, the daughter of Alexander Graham Bell, has very\r\nkindly given me this wonderful letter about them:\r\n\r\n    My grandfather, Alexander Melville Bell, lived on the corner of 35th\r\n    Street and Volta Place in the house since occupied by Mr. Walter\r\n    Lippman, (but not at present).\r\n\r\n    Following my father's removal to Washington in about 1879, his\r\n    father and mother changed their residence from Brantford, Ontario,\r\n    to Georgetown. With them were their three nieces, the Misses\r\n    Symonds, who were my father's double cousins. At the back of the\r\n    35th Street property was an old stable which my father converted\r\n    into a laboratory, and he carried on experiments there almost until\r\n    the time of his death. He would come out nearly every afternoon to\r\n    his laboratory and visit with his parents before returning home in\r\n    the evening.\r\n\r\n    It was also our custom to have dinner with my grandfather and\r\n    grandmother on Sundays. They were very jolly times and my\r\n    grandfather always had a jar of candy for the grandchildren and\r\n    games which we could all play. He was very popular with all the\r\n    young people, being jolly, and looked a little like the usual idea\r\n    of Santa Claus, with his gray beard and hair.\r\n\r\n    Shortly after my grandfather came to live in Georgetown, his\r\n    brother, Mr. David Charles Bell and Mrs. Bell, followed him from\r\n    Brantford to Washington and bought the house next door. With them at\r\n    that time, keeping house for them, was Miss Aileen Bell. She was\r\n    noted in the family as having turned down Bernard Shaw's offer of\r\n    marriage in her young days, Bernard Shaw having been a great friend\r\n    of her brother, Mr. Chichester Bell, and having visited with the\r\n    family when they lived in Dublin, Ireland. Mr. David Bell had in his\r\n    young days moved to Dublin to carry on the career of his father,\r\n    Alexander Bell, as a teacher of elocution. His wife had a school for\r\n    young ladies. Another son of the family was Mr. Charles J. Bell,\r\n    later president of the American Security and Trust Company, who\r\n    later married my mother's sister, Roberta Hubbard, and came to\r\n    reside in Washington.\r\n\r\n    Mr. David Charles Bell was a very handsome man, but very irascible,\r\n    and the young people were quite afraid of him. He and his brother\r\n    had numerous vehement arguments as to whether Shakespeare or Bacon\r\n    wrote Shakespeare's plays. My grandmother was eleven or twelve years\r\n    older than her husband, so my grandfather did most of the marketing,\r\n    and I understand it used to be quite a sight on Saturday morning to\r\n    see the two old gentlemen, Mr. David and Mr. Melville Bell, going to\r\n    market with baskets over their arms. Notwithstanding all their\r\n    arguments, they were very devoted to each other.\r\n\r\n    Miss Aileen Bell was very musical and was one of the founders of the\r\n    Friday Morning Music Club and other musical clubs. She was the\r\n    organist and choir leader in Christ Church, Georgetown. She was\r\n    always very punctilious in her attendance and I remember her talking\r\n    about her church.\r\n\r\n    Mr. and Mrs. Charles Bell and their family also used to come out on\r\n    Sundays to see their parents, but they usually came to supper. The\r\n    family as a whole were very devoted. Mr. Chichester Bell, you may\r\n    recall, was the co-inventor with my father and Mr. Tainter of the\r\n    phonograph. The wax records that are used today are their invention\r\n    and their company, the Columbia Phonograph Company, operated under\r\n    their patents.\r\n\r\n    After my grandfather's death, the house came into my father's\r\n    possession, and he gave it to the American Association to Promote\r\n    the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf, now called the Volta Speech\r\n    Association. It was used for a time as the home of the\r\n    Superintendent. My father still continued to use his laboratory.\r\n    Some years later, when the Association needed money, it was sold and\r\n    the proceeds used to carry on the work of the Association. My father\r\n    was very much interested in the work of the Volta Bureau and one\r\n    winter, when my mother was away, he lived at the Volta Bureau,\r\n    compiling some of his scientific data. He had a way when he became\r\n    absorbed in work of forgetting to eat or sleep, and the person that\r\n    brought his dinner tray would often find his luncheon tray\r\n    untouched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN THRELKELD]\r\n\r\nJust north of the convent grounds is the site of the estate of Berleith,\r\nwhich had been built by Henry Threlkeld. He had, in 1751, married Mrs.\r\nMary Hopkins, a daughter of Dr. Gustavus Brown of Maryland, and widow of\r\nReverend Matthew Hopkins. Henry Threlkeld died in 1781, his widow in\r\n1801. Their one child, John, was married in 1787 to Elizabeth Ridgely,\r\nof Maryland. Two years before his marriage he visited England, one\r\nobject of his trip being to secure a legacy which he converted into gold\r\nand brought back with him. He landed in England at Dover, which he\r\ndescribed as being \"about the size of George Town,\" the voyage having\r\ntaken nearly two months--from October 6th to December 3rd. In his\r\njournal he wrote of having gone to the House of Commons to hear \"Mr.\r\nPitt open the budgett, Mr. Fox followed, and then Mr. Sheridan replied\r\nto Mr. Pitt.\"\r\n\r\nOf John Threlkeld, an old paper states that \"he was well and very widely\r\nknown as a fine scholar and a man of great benevolence.\" He was mayor of\r\nGeorge Town in 1793 and a personal friend of Thomas Jefferson. He was\r\nremembered as a handsome figure on horseback, even in his late years,\r\nand his love of following the hounds is a family tradition. The comments\r\nmade by him in this connection during his stay in England are\r\ninteresting. After describing the journey by coach past fine estates\r\nwith \"one-half the fields as green as spring with grass,\" he added, \"and\r\nbut one horse have I seen in the course of thirty miles at pasture, and\r\nhere I must take notice of their boasting in America of their hunters\r\nleaping the five-bar gates.\" He goes on to explain how the measurements\r\nwere taken, and concludes, \"but still their horses vastly surpass ours.\"\r\n\r\nJohn and Elizabeth Threlkeld had four children, but the only son died in\r\ninfancy, so the name disappeared, and the family is represented only by\r\nthe descendants of their daughter, Jane, who married John Cox.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLONEL JOHN COX]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\n_Along First Street (N) from Cox's Row to High Street (Wisconsin Ave.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the northeast corner of First Street (N) and Frederick (34th) Street\r\nstands the row of houses which John Cox built. Colonel Cox was for many\r\nyears most prominent in all the affairs of Georgetown, serving as its\r\nMayor longer than any other one man from 1823 to 1845--22 years. John\r\nCox was of English descent. He was born in 1775 during the Revolution,\r\nwas the youngest of four children, and being left an orphan as a small\r\nchild, was raised by an uncle who was a banker in Baltimore. He later\r\nlived for a while in Philadelphia, and from there came to Georgetown. He\r\nfirst married Matilda Smith, a sister of Clement Smith, well known as\r\nthe first cashier of the Farmers' & Mechanics Bank, later its president.\r\nThey had three children, one of whom was named Clement. By his second\r\nmarriage to Jane Threlkeld he had seven children.\r\n\r\nIn the War of 1812 he served as a Colonel. He was a large property owner\r\nin Georgetown, besides being a well-to-do merchant. He built the row of\r\nhouses on First (N) Street, called by his name and lived for a while in\r\nthe house on the corner. That must have been during the period of his\r\nfirst marriage, for after Jane Threlkeld became his wife they built a\r\nlovely house on part of the Berleith estate, next door to the old\r\nThrelkeld which had been burned, and called it The Cedars. It stood\r\nwhere the Western High School now stands, and it is difficult to\r\nrealize now that there, in my memory, was a home surrounded by a mass of\r\ntrees and vines and was most delightfully private and charming. It was a\r\nquaint and lovely old cream-colored mansion, a portico on its north\r\nfront, two long piazzas as usual, along the south side of the house. In\r\nlater years I myself went there to the private school kept by the Misses\r\nEarle, whose father, George Earle purchased the place.\r\n\r\nColonel Cox was celebrated as a dandy. \"He would saunter down town in\r\nsilk stockings and pumps, not getting a spot upon himself, while other\r\nmen would be up to their ankles in mud, for in those days there were no\r\npavements.\" Stepping-stones were placed at the corners of the streets\r\nstanding rather high above the roadway to facilitate the pedestrians.\r\n\r\nColonel Cox had moved up to The Cedars when, as mayor in 1824, it fell\r\nto his lot to act as host for Georgetown to the Marquis de Lafayette,\r\nwhen he made his famous visit.\r\n\r\nA new arrival was imminent in the Cox family, so it was not advisable to\r\nhave the party, which he wished to give, at his home. Consequently, he\r\nused one of these houses which was vacant at that time, number 3337; had\r\nit furnished from top to bottom, his eldest daughter, Sally, acting in\r\nher mother's place as hostess for the distinguished party invited to\r\nmeet the hero of the hour.\r\n\r\nIt is said that one young lady in her enthusiasm fell upon her knees\r\nbefore the Marquis and impressed a kiss upon his hands. There was a\r\nfashion in those days of decorating the floor by painting a pattern\r\naround the edges with colored chalks--garlands of roses entwined with\r\nthe flags of the two countries. A marvelous supper was served; it is\r\nsaid it included 600 reed birds. It is to be hoped it also included\r\nother things more substantial than this high-sounding but sparsely\r\ncovered game.\r\n\r\nThe coach of Colonel Cox was at the disposal of the honored guest during\r\nthe period of his stay. When he made his formal entry into the District\r\nof Columbia, having come by way of Baltimore, he was escorted by a troop\r\nof cavalry from Montgomery County commanded by my grandfather, Captain\r\nHenry Dunlop, a Georgetonian, then farming the family plantation, Hayes,\r\nseven miles north of town.\r\n\r\nTradition says that number 3337 had a tunnel leading to the river. Some\r\nsuch large opening was discovered when the owner excavated recently to\r\nmake a pool in the garden. In 1860 this house was the home of William A.\r\nGordon, for many years chief of the quartermaster's department. It was\r\nfrom here that his eldest son of the same name left to enter the\r\nConfederate Army. William A. Gordon, senior, born in Baltimore, had gone\r\nto the Military Academy at West Point, and while there a terrible cry\r\narose about the poor quality of food furnished for the cadets. Mr.\r\nGordon was one of the three young men selected by the corps to go to\r\nWashington to interview the President on the subject. The answer he gave\r\nthem was that he would see that conditions at the Academy were remedied,\r\nbut his advice to them was to send in their resignations immediately, as\r\nthere would be no career there for them after this.\r\n\r\nFrom about 1865 to 1892 Mr. and Mrs. William Laird, Jr., made this\r\nhouse their home. Mr. Laird was for forty years cashier of the Farmers'\r\nand Mechanics' Bank, and was greatly respected. When he resigned he was\r\npresented by the officials with a very handsome silver punch bowl, ladle\r\nand tray and a large silver loving cup. He died suddenly a month or two\r\nafter giving up his business and his widow did not survive him long.\r\nMrs. Laird was Anna Key Ridgely, a charming person. They had no\r\nchildren, nor had his brother, who never married, so this name, long so\r\nhonored here, has disappeared from Georgetown.\r\n\r\nTo return to the corner house. It was for several years the home of\r\nCommodore Charles Morris, one of the eminent officers of the early U. S.\r\nNavy. He made a remarkable record in the War with Tripoli, his earliest\r\nachievement being on the occasion of the recapture and destruction of\r\nthe frigate _Philadelphia_ in the harbor of Tripoli in 1804. Midshipman\r\nMorris, then nineteen years old, volunteered for the service and was the\r\nfirst to stand on the deck of the _Philadelphia_ and commence the work\r\nof destruction. At the beginning of the War of 1812 he held the rank of\r\nlieutenant--and became executive officer of the _Constitution_, Captain\r\nIsaac Hull being in command.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of July, 1812, a very calm day, the frigate met a fleet of\r\nBritish vessels, and the enemy thought they had an easy prize, but by a\r\ncombination of towing and kedging by means of the _Constitution's_ boats\r\nand anchors, an extraordinary escape was made which, as Captain Hull\r\nstated at the time, was conceived by Lieutenant Morris. Its successful\r\nexecution commanded the admiration of his countrymen and won the\r\napplause even of the British officers.\r\n\r\nCommodore Morris was chosen to escort Lafayette back to France on the U.\r\nS. S. _Brandywine_, and while on a visit to the general his portrait was\r\npainted by Amy Shaffer and sent back to Mrs. Morris as a gift from the\r\nMarquis.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 the property was bought by James Keith who was a great friend of\r\nGeneral Washington, Mr. Keith's daughter married Mr. Forrest, and their\r\nson French Forrest was an officer in the United States Navy, but like\r\nmany others in this part of the world, went into the Southern Navy\r\nduring the Civil War. At the time of his funeral W. W. Corcoran, who was\r\na very intimate friend, was a pall-bearer. In those days it was the\r\nstyle for the mourners to wear a long streamer of crepe around their\r\nhats and hanging down a foot or two. Little Douglas Forrest, the son of\r\nthe deceased, began to cry, saying he \"wanted some funeral on his hat.\"\r\nMr. Corcoran took him in hand and insisted that he should have his wish\r\nand be arrayed like the other mourners.\r\n\r\nIn the other houses of that row lived, at number 3335, just before the\r\nCivil War, a family named Semmes from New Orleans who had several\r\ndaughters considered very beautiful. Cora Semmes became the wife of\r\nColonel Joseph Ives, a brilliant young engineer officer of the United\r\nStates Army, who, although of Northern birth, espoused the Southern\r\ncause. He was put on General Lee's staff, and later transferred to be\r\naide-de-camp to Jefferson Davis where, in Richmond he and his wife\r\nbecame prominent and useful in entertaining distinguished foreigners, as\r\nshe was noted for her charm as well as her beauty.\r\n\r\nIn number 3333 Judge Robert Ould resided. His father had been one of\r\nthe founders of the Lancastrian School. Mattie Ould, whose name still is\r\na synonym for grace, beauty and wit, spent her childhood here. After the\r\nOulds went to Richmond this house was for a time the home of Henry\r\nAddison, while he was mayor. Later on the Cropleys lived in it.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hunter lived for a great many years in number 3331, when he was\r\nAssistant Secretary of State. Women of my generation still remember him\r\nfor his love of little children and his gifts to them of toys and\r\ngoodies.\r\n\r\nAcross on the southeast corner of First (N) Street and Frederick (34th)\r\nStreet at 3340 is the house which Harry Hopkins, the great friend of\r\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, bought and moved to with his new wife and his\r\ndaughter Diana, when they left the White House where they had been\r\nliving for a year or more. This was his home at the time of his death.\r\n\r\nOn this street used to live the Marburys before they moved to The\r\nHeights, and also the Wheatleys of whom there were several households in\r\nGeorgetown in the latter part of the last century.\r\n\r\nA block eastward on the same side of the street is another row of\r\ncharming old houses, built about 1800 by Colonel James Smith, \"lately\r\nreturned from the Revolutionary War.\" In the one on the corner of First\r\n(N) and Potomac Streets used to live Mrs. Gannt and her daughter Clare\r\nand Mrs. Gannt's sister Mrs. Smith. I think they were descendants of the\r\nbuilder of the row. Their old home was for a time occupied by Mr. and\r\nMrs. Blair Thaw, the former a poet, the latter an artist.\r\n\r\nThird from the corner at 3259, in the middle of the 19th century lived\r\nDr. Lewis Ritchie who had an extensive practice. I think he was the son\r\nof Dr. Joshua Ritchie. This house was the home of Hon. and Mrs. Lewis A.\r\nDouglas when he was the sole representative in Congress from Arizona.\r\nLater he was Director of the Budget and within recent years Ambassador\r\nto the Court of St. James. This house is now the home of Mrs. McCook\r\nKnox who is very well known in connection with the study of Early\r\nAmerican Portraits and has been connected with the Frick Art Reference\r\nLibrary of New York since its inception. In the front room of the attic\r\nof 3259 were doors of rough hewn wood with old iron bolts leading into\r\nrooms of the two adjoining houses. The story is that in the War of 1812\r\nthis row of houses used to be watched. A soldier would be stationed on\r\nthe corner, but the \"questionable person\" never emerged, he could escape\r\nthrough the attic rooms and come out at the end of the row.\r\n\r\nNo. 3257 is now the home of Hon. and Mrs. Richard B. Wigglesworth of\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe old home of the Shoemaker family was at 3261. While he was Assistant\r\nSecretary of War it was the home of Hon. and Mrs. F. Trubee Davison and\r\nis now the home of Hon. and Mrs. James J. Wadsworth of New York.\r\n\r\nAll of this part of Georgetown west of High Street (Wisconsin Avenue)\r\nused to be called Holy Hill, because of the great number of Irish who\r\ndwelt in the neighborhood. On Saint Patrick's Day there were parades and\r\nfights, and all kinds of excitement.\r\n\r\nThere were also a good many respectable colored Catholics, and near\r\nhere, on Potomac Street, dwelt a family of Coakleys. Magdalen Coakley\r\nthought she was the reincarnation of the Virgin Mary. She got herself\r\nup to look like the Virgin, in sweeping white robes and a sky-blue veil\r\nand cloak. She was not a very dark negress and had a fine countenance\r\nand striking figure. She used to go about the streets blessing little\r\nchildren and wanting to baptize them, followed, of course, by a string\r\nof boys making fun of her. She would go up to Trinity Church and stand\r\nby the door; but once she wanted to help the priest give Communion, so\r\nthey had to forbid her coming. Of course the poor soul thought she was\r\nbeing persecuted, but she took it in a Christian manner and prayed all\r\nthe harder, on the street and everywhere. She lived to be an old woman\r\nstill wearing her picturesque costume.\r\n\r\nHer sister, Frances, was nurse for three generations for the Hein family\r\nwhose home was at number 3249 N Street, now entirely changed by its\r\nmodernized roof and steps.\r\n\r\nSamuel Hein had emigrated from Koenigsberg, Germany, as a young man, and\r\nhad become an American citizen. He was fifty-six years in the Coast and\r\nGeodetic Survey, retiring as its disbursing officer. He was an ardent\r\nUnion man, and during the four years of the Civil War kept the Stars and\r\nStripes flying from one of his windows. All through the two terrible\r\ndays after the Battle of Bull Run, when the Northern troops were\r\nstreaming through Georgetown, Mr. Hein maintained a soup kitchen for the\r\nsoldiers in his back yard. His wife was the daughter of John Simpson who\r\nlived on the corner of High Street (Wisconsin Avenue) and West (P)\r\nStreets. Her brother, James Alexander Simpson, was a rather well-known\r\nportrait painter. They were quite a musical and artistic family.\r\n\r\nOne son Charles Hein was an artist and had his studio in a little frame\r\nhouse still standing on 31st (Congress) behind another house, opposite\r\nthe post office. There he took pupils. He was very picturesque in\r\nappearance, tall and dark, wore a drooping mustache, low collar with\r\nflowing black cravat and wide-brimmed black hat and cape.\r\n\r\nAnother son Col. O. L. Hein in an interesting book called _Memories of\r\nLong Ago_ tells this story:\r\n\r\n    One day in the spring of 1861, as I was passing the residence of the\r\n    pastor of St. John's Church, The Rev. Mr. Tillinghast, quite near\r\n    our house, I was attracted by the sight of a dashing young Cavalry\r\n    officer, who was showing off the paces of his handsome black charger\r\n    to the Minister. I lingered nearby, greatly enjoying the equestrian\r\n    performance, and upon its conclusion I was informed by the\r\n    clergyman, that the name of the young officer was William Orton\r\n    Williams, and that he was the military secretary of Lt. General\r\n    Winfield Scott.\r\n\r\n    In the following year I was shocked to read in a local newspaper the\r\n    account of the trial and conviction of Williams and his cousin, Lt.\r\n    W. G. Peter (resident of Georgetown) as spies under the assumed\r\n    names of General W. C. Auton and Major Dunlop, of the Union Army, by\r\n    a drumhead Court Martial, and their conviction and execution by\r\n    hanging. In recent years I was informed by my wife's mother, Mrs.\r\n    Ross, that she remembered Williams quite well, and that he was\r\n    engaged to Miss Anne Lee, the daughter of General R. E. Lee; but\r\n    that she died, on the outbreak of the Civil War. Mrs. Ross was a\r\n    cousin of General Lee, and a freqeunt visitor at Arlington before\r\n    the secession of Virginia.\r\n\r\n    Williams was of distinguished ancestry, the son of Capt. William G.\r\n    Williams, a graduate of West Point of the class of 1822, who was\r\n    mortally wounded at the Battle of Monterey, Mexico, while serving on\r\n    the staff of General Zachary Taylor, and his mother, America Peter\r\n    was the daughter of Thomas Peter, a prominent citizen of\r\n    Georgetown, whose wife Martha Parke Custis was the granddaughter of\r\n    Mrs. George Washington and an aunt of Mary Custis the wife of\r\n    General R. E. Lee.\r\n\r\nJust next door to this house is the site where, even before 1780, stood\r\nthe Columbian Academy of which Mr. Rogers was the principal and of which\r\nDr. Balch became the head in 1781. It was a large, two-story frame\r\nbuilding, having a high entrance porch, where hung the bell. It stood on\r\na hill which commanded a fine view of the river from the study rooms\r\nupstairs. Adjacent to the schoolroom was a large garden in the middle\r\nof which was a jessamine arbor. Two of General Washington's nephews were\r\nstudents of the school and lived with the principal.\r\n\r\nHere was housed the Columbian Library which was opened in 1803. In later\r\nyears the present building was erected but having a very different\r\nappearance. Here lived Hugh Caperton a well known lawyer.\r\n\r\nI myself lived here as a very small child when I was two or three years\r\nold and one of my very first memories is being dared by my brothers and\r\nsisters to jump off the stone wall fronting the street, about four feet\r\nhigh. I felt as if I had to jump from the Washington Monument, but I did\r\nit, with no ill effects.\r\n\r\nIt was after that the home, for many years, of the Barbers. Old Mrs.\r\nBarber moved there with her grandchildren when she sold her home where\r\nthe United States Naval Observatory now stands. She was the daughter of\r\nMajor Adlum whose home was The Vineyard where the Bureau of Standards is\r\nnow. His place was well named for he was a great horticulturist, the\r\nfirst to domesticate the Catawba grape. It grew wild in North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\n_Gay (N) Street--East to Rock Creek_\r\n\r\n\r\nAcross High Street (Wisconsin Avenue) along Gay (N) Street on the\r\nnorthwest corner of Congress (31st) is the Baptist Church which has just\r\ncelebrated its 75th anniversary. It was originally a small frame\r\nbuilding, up on a bank. The present building was erected in 1890.\r\n\r\nOn the southwest corner of Gay (N) and Congress (31st) Streets stood,\r\nnot so very many years ago, an attractive old white house with long\r\nporches, tiers of them, across the back overlooking a garden. I think\r\nthe present building is what it was converted into in the period that\r\ndid the best to rob Georgetown of all its charm.\r\n\r\nHere, in 1795, Dr. James Heighe Blake built his home. He was a very\r\neminent citizen, a member of the first vestry of Saint John's Church,\r\none of the very first to advocate schools of the Lancastrian system and\r\na reformatory, and the very first person to suggest a health officer for\r\nthe City of Washington. He moved over to the city and became its third\r\nmayor from 1813 to 1817. His daughter, Glorvina, married William A.\r\nGordon, senior, of whom I have already spoken.\r\n\r\nHere, at one time, lived Judge Walter Cox, grandson of Colonel John Cox.\r\nHis wife was a daughter of Judge Dunlop. Still later, the school of Miss\r\nJennie and Miss Lucy Stephenson was here, which was well attended in the\r\nseventies and eighties. In the spring of 1875, a romantic elopement\r\ntook place. A young girl of sixteen, an orphan, who was said to be \"an\r\nheiress,\" went off to Baltimore very early one morning with the son of a\r\nminister who taught Latin in the school.\r\n\r\nWhen the pupils came that morning, they sensed the excitement and\r\ngathered in groups in the gallery. Eventually, the news leaked out and\r\nthe chief topic was that the young lady took no baggage, not even a\r\nnightgown, in her flight.\r\n\r\nJust below here, on Congress (31st) Street, in the latter part of the\r\nlast century lived a lady much beloved by rich and poor. She was the\r\nfirst person to conceive the idea of a diet kitchen for the needy. She\r\nhad not much of this world's goods, so she went daily to the different\r\nbutchers who gave her scraps of meat which she cooked, and had\r\ncontinually on hand jars of \"beef tea.\" All the doctors knew where to\r\napply when they had patients who were in need of it. She was the widow\r\nof Captain Charles Carroll Simms, an officer of the old navy who went\r\nwith the Confederacy, and at the famous battle in Hampton Roads, was\r\nsecond in command of the _Merrimac_, and in command after the chief\r\nofficer was killed. She was Elizabeth Nourse, daughter of Major Charles\r\nJoseph Nourse, of The Highlands.\r\n\r\nNext door, below Mrs. Simms' house, stands the Methodist Protestant\r\nChurch which not long ago celebrated its one hundredth anniversary. The\r\nlot for it was purchased in April, 1829, but the founders for a year or\r\ntwo previous to that had been worshipping in the Presbyterian Church\r\nbuilding, Saint John's or the Lancastrian schoolroom. It is now a\r\nChristian Science Church.\r\n\r\nAcross the street from the church, next door to the Post Office, the\r\ntall brick house is where a family lived which in the nineties was a\r\nmystery to Georgetown--the Oueston family--father, mother, and daughter.\r\nNo one knew what was the father's business, and no one ever saw the\r\nmother out, but it was rumored that she came from South America, was of\r\nroyal blood, and had a throne on which she sat, dressed accordingly. The\r\ndaughter was known then, and for many years afterwards, as \"the girl of\r\na thousand curls.\" She was tall and slender, and her magnificent suit of\r\ndark hair was a mass of curls, making her head look like \"a bushel\r\nbasket.\" She wore ankle-length dresses of a style totally different from\r\nwhat every other girl wore: white stockings, when all of us wore black,\r\nand black slippers, laced up with narrow black ribbons.\r\n\r\nAnd then up to the northeast corner of Gay (N) and Congress (31st)\r\nStreets, to the tall yellow house, now an apartment house. For many\r\nyears it was at the home of the Snyders. Dr. John M. Snyder died at the\r\nage of 36, in the enjoyment of a fine reputation in his profession, of\r\nan unusual accident.\r\n\r\nThe story is told by Dr. Samuel Busey, in his _Personal Reminiscences_:\r\n\r\n    Dr. Snyder had bought a farm called \"Greenwood\" a little way out of\r\n    town toward Tenallytown, and one afternoon at Dr. Busey's home,\r\n    \"Belvoir,\" now the Beauvoir School, was telling Dr. Busey how he was\r\n    enjoying pruning the old oak trees on his place of dead wood. Dr.\r\n    Busey warned him that he was engaging in a dangerous amusement and\r\n    related the story of how a hired man of his, doing such a job, had\r\n    had a bad fall, but, fortunately, without injury.\r\n\r\n    Two or three days later, Dr. Busey was summoned to \"Greenwood,\"\r\n    where he found Dr. Snyder dying from just such an accident. The\r\n    branch of the tree he had been sawing off was hanging by a\r\n    splintered sliver, too weak to support its weight and, in swinging\r\n    to the ground, had knocked away the ladder on which Dr. Snyder was\r\n    standing.\r\n\r\nHis wife was Sophy Tayloe, a member of the well-known family of the\r\nOctagon House in Washington, and beautiful old Mount Airy in Virginia.\r\nAs a widow in her old age, she had a steady admirer, a general, who came\r\nevery afternoon at the same time in his Victoria, and took her to drive.\r\nI can see her now, a small, slight figure in her cape, and little black\r\nbonnet tied under her chin, and holding one of those quaint little\r\nruffled sunshades to keep the sun out of her eyes.\r\n\r\nShe had one daughter, Miss Annie, who had the loveliest rosy cheeks (no\r\nrouge in those days), who never married. One son, Bladen, was an artist,\r\nand he used to be a familiar sight with his camp-stool and easel on the\r\nstreets, painting.\r\n\r\nGeorgetown was not so \"arty\" in Bladen Snyder's day, unfortunately, so\r\nhe was considered very \"odd.\"\r\n\r\nThe other son, Dr. Arthur Snyder, was a fine surgeon, and an ardent\r\nhorseman.\r\n\r\nNot long ago I was being shown photographs of belles and beaux of the\r\neighties and nineties in Georgetown. Among them were several pictures of\r\nthe crews of the Columbia Boat Club, and one of the \"four\" was young Dr.\r\nSnyder, whose home this was.\r\n\r\nThere were two boat clubs in those days which were great rivals. The\r\nColumbia was at the foot of High Street (Wisconsin Avenue) and the\r\nPotomac was at the foot of Congress (31st) Street. I have more\r\nrecollections of the latter, especially the dances held there on\r\nsummer evenings, and the porch overhanging the river, with the moonlight\r\non the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD DR. RILEY'S HOUSE]\r\n\r\nWe used to have tug parties, starting from there, going several miles\r\ndown the Potomac and back, eating our supper on board and singing \"My\r\nBonnie Lies Over the Ocean,\" and \"On the Road to Mandalay,\" which at\r\nthat time was quite new.\r\n\r\nAcross the street, at number 3038, is the house that I have always heard\r\ncalled \"old Dr. Riley's.\" It was sold on the 24th of March, 1812, by\r\nJames S. Marshall to William S. Nicholls and Romulus Riggs. Mr. Riggs\r\nowned the house until 1835. He was born near Brookeville in Montgomery\r\nCounty, Maryland. He was married in 1810. Somewhere between 1812 and\r\n1835 he went to live in Philadelphia where he was a prosperous merchant\r\nand influential citizen. I think it probable he lived in this house\r\nduring some of that time and sold it to Dr. Joshua Riley.\r\n\r\nDr. Riley had several students of medicine whom he taught. Among them\r\nwas Dr. Armistead Peter, Alec Williams, \"the handsomest man in town,\"\r\nand the two nephews of Baron Bodisco, who also spent much time here. His\r\noffice, a quaint little one-story brick building, on part of his lot,\r\nwas torn down a few years ago, to the great sorrow of us old-timers, for\r\nGeorgetown had lost one of its most distinctive antiques.\r\n\r\nDr. Riley practiced medicine for 51 years and died beloved in the\r\ncommunity at large as well as by his patients. He had a good word and\r\npleasant salutation for everybody. He was a man of marked personal\r\nappearance, tall, slim, gaunt, awkward in manner, with a quick emphatic\r\nstyle of speech.\r\n\r\nDr. Riley had married a daughter of Colonel Fowler, who lived on West\r\n(P) Street, and on the 10th of June, 1851, his wife's niece, Juliet\r\nMurray was married in this dear old house to John Marbury, Jr. Dr.\r\nRiley's daughter, Miss Marianna, and her sister-in-law, Mrs. Riley,\r\noccupied this house for many years until her death, when it was sold for\r\nalmost \"a song.\" Since then it has been resold several times.\r\n\r\nAcross the street, at number 3043, now the home of Vice-Admiral Laurence\r\nDu Bose, was the home of another well-known admiral, Theodore Wilkinson,\r\nwhen he returned from the Pacific. He and his wife started off on a\r\nmotor trip. At Norfolk, Virginia, as they were landing from a ferry, his\r\ncar got out of control; he signaled to his wife to jump and her life was\r\nsaved, but he and the car ran off into deep water and he was drowned.\r\n\r\nThe cream-colored brick house with wings out on each side, now number\r\n3033 N Street, is one of the very oldest houses in Georgetown. It was\r\nthe home of Colonel George Beall, son of Ninian Beall, and bequeathed by\r\nhim at his death in 1780 to his daughters, Elizabeth and Ann, the same\r\nElizabeth who became the wife of Dr. Stephen Bloomer Balch shortly after\r\nher father's death.\r\n\r\nAdjoining the house on the east was the garden. All the land between\r\nthis house and the one at 3017, built by George Beall's son, Thomas\r\nBeall of George, as he always styled himself, was made his two\r\n\"Additions to Georgetown,\" was part of this estate. Many years\r\nafterwards, the little summer house and the fruit trees were still\r\nthere. And, as was the custom in those long-ago days, here was the\r\nfamily burying-ground. I know people who remember it. Among the\r\ngravestones removed to the old Presbyterian burying-ground were two\r\nwhich bore these inscriptions: \"Here lieth Colonel George Beall, who\r\ndeparted this life March 15, 1780, aged 85.\" And the other, \"Here lieth\r\nthe body of Elizabeth Beall, who departed this life October 2, 1748,\r\naged about 49 years.\" She was Elizabeth Brooke, daughter of Colonel\r\nThomas Brooke and Barbara Dent.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 these two sisters sold this house to John Peter, and the next\r\nyear he sold it to Mrs. Robert Peter, who was then a widow. She came\r\nhere to live with her younger daughter, Margaret, who had become the\r\nwife of Thomas Dick, of Bladensburg. Here Mrs. Peter lived until her\r\ndeath in 1821, at the age of seventy-eight. Mrs. Dick's husband had died\r\nwhile on a trip to the West Indies and had been buried at sea. She lived\r\non here the rest of her life with her only child, Robert, and he lived\r\nthere many years and died there--an old bachelor. He was buried in Oak\r\nHill on Christmas Eve, 1870. During these years there was a much-beloved\r\nold cook, Aunt Hannah, who was famous for her gingerbread and cookies. I\r\nhave seen her photograph \"all dressed up to have her picture took.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Dick had a big black dog who always came to the gate to greet the\r\nnewsboy and took the paper in his mouth to his master.\r\n\r\nAfter Robert Dick's death, Thomas Cox bought the place and it was the\r\nhome of his family for a good many years. The eastern wing was put on at\r\nthat time and used as a conservatory. Since then the house has changed\r\nhands many, many times, and the western wing been added.\r\n\r\nThe two houses at numbers 3025 and 3027 were built in the seventies by\r\nOscar Stevens for his family and that of his brother-in-law, Dr. John S.\r\nBillings. Their wives were sisters, and very dependent upon each other.\r\nDr. Billings was a pioneer in the introduction of indirect heating in\r\nbuildings, and became an authority on that subject, and on ventilation.\r\nHis textbooks on the subject were used in the Massachusetts Institute of\r\nTechnology, and when Johns Hopkins Hospital was built, he was consulted.\r\nBecause he had made such a fine record in creating the Army Medical\r\nLibrary, he was asked to come to New York and create the new Public\r\nLibrary there from the Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations, which were\r\nconsolidated.\r\n\r\nAcross the street, at number 3032, where now is a large, modern brick\r\nhouse, there used to be, before I can remember, a quaint, frame\r\nstructure. It was supposed to be one of the first houses built on the\r\ngrant of the Rock of Dumbarton, and was intended for the \"overlooker\" of\r\nthat part of the grant. It was a very plain but comfortable house, and\r\nwas the home in the early part of the century of Hezekiah Miller who,\r\nlike many of the gentry in those days, was in charge of government work.\r\nHis department dealt with the Indians, and he had the distribution of\r\nmoney and supplies to certain tribes to whom he went from time to time,\r\nand also looked after them when they came to Washington. They always\r\ncalled him \"Father Miller.\" Mr. Miller's wife was Miss Middleton, from\r\nBrooke Court Manor, in Maryland. Hezekiah Miller was a devout member of\r\nChrist Church. His daughter became the wife of the Reverend George\r\nLeakin, an Episcopal clergyman of Baltimore. She was to have been a\r\nbridesmaid at the wedding of Harriet Williams and Baron Bodisco, but was\r\nprevented by the sudden death of her brother by drowning. He was one of\r\ntwins, born just at the time of General Lafayette's arrival on his visit\r\nin 1824, who were named Washington and Lafayette at the request of the\r\ntownspeople. It was the latter young man who drowned, at the age of\r\ntwenty-five.\r\n\r\nNumber 3028 was the home, for a long, long time of the Reads, three\r\nsisters. One married Dr. Post, who was a missionary to Syria, but Miss\r\nJane and Miss Isabella lived here many years after. The house next door\r\nstill has its old-time doorway, but, unfortunately, one owner in the\r\neighties spoiled its quaintness by adding a corner tower. It was here, I\r\nthink, that Dr. William Barton Rogers, first President of the\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, lived at one time.\r\n\r\nThe two big houses, numbers 3014 and 3017, standing opposite each other\r\non this block are very closely connected in their history. The early\r\npart is all tied up together. Although number 3017 has been somewhat\r\nchanged in appearance, it is still, I imagine, a good deal like it was\r\nwhen Thomas Beall built it in 1794. Of course, the street has been cut\r\ndown and left it higher up than it originally was, and also the old\r\nbricks have been covered with paint, and now a modern addition has\r\nhidden its lovely little wing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3017 N STREET. THE HOUSE THAT THOMAS BEALL BUILT]\r\n\r\nThe building of this house was evidently quite an event in those days,\r\nfor in old advertisements of the sale of houses, many of them are\r\n\"Between the Union Tavern and Thomas Beall's house on Gay Street.\" John\r\nLaird had a frame house on the lot, immediately across the street, now\r\nnumber 3014, but he was becoming exceedingly prosperous and wanted a\r\nhandsome house. He married first, Lucinda Dick, sister of Thomas Dick,\r\nof Bladensburg, and, after her death, her elder sister, Mary. While he\r\nwas building his brick house at number 3014, he rented and occupied\r\nThomas Beall's house. No reason is given as to why Mr. Beall was not\r\noccupying it himself.\r\n\r\nAbout 1800 Mr. Laird moved into his own new mansion. At that time only\r\nthe central part of the large building was there. Several wings have\r\nbeen added and the little portico at the front door. John Laird's eldest\r\ndaughter, Barbara, married James Dunlop, Junior, the eldest son of James\r\nDunlop; and his only son, William Laird, married two of James Dunlop's\r\ndaughters at Hayes, first Helen, by whom he had three children, William\r\nLaird, Jr., James Dunlop Laird, who went to California in 1848 and never\r\nmarried, and Helen Laird, who also never married. After the death of his\r\nfirst wife, William Laird, Sr., married his sister-in-law, Arianna\r\nFrench Dunlop. She was very lame, and the marriage took place only a\r\nshort time before her death.\r\n\r\nThe miniatures reproduced of John Laird and James Dunlop represent them\r\nboth in scarlet coats, with lace ruffles and powdered hair.\r\n\r\nJohn Laird was always very much interested in the Presbyterian Church\r\nand its affairs, and his descendants have remained so.\r\n\r\nHe came to this country at the age of seventeen and was active in\r\nGeorgetown from its early days, and it is a pity that none of his\r\nchildren had a son to carry on his name.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN LAIRD]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES DUNLOP, SENIOR]\r\n\r\nHis son, William Laird, Jr., who had children, but no grandchildren, was\r\nclerk of the town for a great many years, longer than any other man. He\r\nis said to have had no superior as an accountant in this country.\r\n\r\nAfter John Laird's death in 1833, his house became the property of his\r\ndaughter, Margaret. She never married, and lived there for a great many\r\nyears with her aunt, Miss Elizabeth Dick. They were always known as\r\n\"Miss Peggy\" Laird and \"Miss Betsy\" Dick. My mother, as a little girl,\r\nremembered them. They used to sit by the front windows a great deal, and\r\nthe turban which Miss Betsy wore on her head was, of course, very\r\nintriguing to a young girl in 1850. They were both almost always dressed\r\nin Scotch gingham of such fine quality that it seemed like silk. They\r\nwere both ardent supporters of the Presbyterian Church and workers for\r\nthe Orphan Asylum. Miss Betsy Dick died first, of course. Thomas Bloomer\r\nBalch dedicated to her one of the lectures he gave in Georgetown in the\r\nfifties called \"Reminiscences of George Town.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Peggy Laird died, she left the house to her sister, Barbara,\r\nMrs. James Dunlop. They had been living on the southeast corner of Gay\r\n(N) and Greene (29th) Streets. From that time on, number 3014 was always\r\nknown as the Dunlop house.\r\n\r\nJudge Dunlop was always very prominent. As a young man he was secretary\r\nof the Corporation of Georgetown, which fact is recorded on the keystone\r\nof the little bridge on High Street (Wisconsin Avenue) over the canal.\r\nHe was for some time a law partner of Francis Scott Key, and later was\r\nappointed Chief Justice of the Circuit Court of the District of\r\nColumbia. He was holding this office at the outbreak of the Civil War\r\nand, being a Southerner in his sympathies, was, very naturally, removed\r\nfrom office by President Lincoln. An interesting thing is that about\r\n1915 this place was bought from the heirs of Judge Dunlop's son by\r\nRobert Todd Lincoln, son of President Lincoln.\r\n\r\nAn anecdote is told of a dinner party long ago where Judge Dunlop was a\r\nguest, when one of the other guests was making puns on the names of all\r\nthose present. Judge Dunlop said, \"You will not be able to make one on\r\nmy name.\" Quick as a flash came back the rejoinder, \"Just lop off the\r\nlast syllable and it is dun.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Dunlop and all of his brothers, except one, were graduates of\r\nPrinceton College, he being valedictorian of his class. A portrait of\r\nhim hangs in the courthouse in Washington. His son, William Laird\r\nDunlop, lived for many years as a bachelor in the old house before his\r\nmarriage to his cousin, Miss Sallie Peter, in Rockville. An interesting\r\nstory is told of their neighbor, Dr. Tyler, coming home one evening and\r\nsaying to his wife, \"I'll have to go over and see what is the matter at\r\nMr. Dunlop's; the house is lit up from top to bottom.\" When he returned,\r\nhe was laughing heartily. \"It's only that Mr. Dunlop is going to be\r\nmarried and is inspecting the house thoroughly.\" The bride he brought\r\nthere was a very lovely person and very much beloved.\r\n\r\nWilliam Laird Dunlop always kept up his custom of keeping his own cow\r\nand killing his own hogs in the fall. The little square, brick building\r\ncovered with vines between the house and the stable was the meat house.\r\nIt is in the garden of this house that the only remaining stone marker\r\nused in laying off the original George Town stands, protruding about\r\neighteen inches from the ground.\r\n\r\nNow to return to number 3017 across the street. In 1811 this house was\r\nbought from Thomas Beall by Major George Peter. He was the youngest son\r\nof Robert Peter. He was born in George Town on the 28th of September,\r\n1779. When only fifteen years old he joined the Maryland troops against\r\nthe Whisky Insurrectionists (1794), but his parents sent a messenger to\r\ncamp and General Washington, hearing of the matter, ordered him home.\r\nHis youthful ardor was gratified five years later in July, 1799, by his\r\nappointment as second lieutenant of the Ninth Infantry, United States\r\nArmy, by President Adams, and he enjoyed the distinction of receiving\r\nhis commission from the hands of General Washington at Mount Vernon.\r\nWhile in command at Fort McHenry, Baltimore, during the administration\r\nof President Jefferson, he organized the first light-horse battery\r\nformed in the United States service, and he always referred to his\r\n\"Flying Artillery\" with a special pride, in that he was specially\r\nselected by President Jefferson for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1805, Lieutenant Peter accompanied General Wilkinson to the\r\nWest and took part in the organization of the Territorial Government of\r\nMissouri. Arriving at St. Louis on the Fourth of July, he established\r\nthe first cantonment on the banks of the Missouri at Bellefontaine and\r\nfired the first salute on the return of Lewis and Clarke from their\r\nexpedition to the Pacific. He also served under General Wilkinson during\r\nGovernor Claiborne's administration before Louisiana was admitted to the\r\nUnion and he was present as a witness at the trial of Aaron Burr.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the War of 1812, President Madison tendered him a\r\nbrigadier-generalship, which the condition of private affairs compelled\r\nhim to decline, but in 1813 he volunteered his services and commanded a\r\nbattalion of \"Flying Artillery.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the privates in this battalion were George Peabody and Francis\r\nScott Key, besides others who afterwards became distinguished citizens.\r\nIn writing of this battalion, W. W. Corcoran says the list of its\r\nmembership represented the wealth, worth, and talent of the town at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn 1815, he was elected to Congress from the Sixth District of Maryland,\r\nbut his seat was contested on the ground that he was not a resident of\r\nthe Congressional District. At that time he was a resident of Georgetown\r\nand a member of the Town Council, but had large farms in Maryland. The\r\nHouse of Representatives, however, decided in his favor, and admitted\r\nhim to take his seat. He was the first Democrat ever elected to Congress\r\nfrom the Sixth District of Maryland and was re-elected in 1817, and\r\nagain in 1828. He served several terms in the State Legislature and in\r\n1855 was elected by the Democratic Party a Commissioner of Public Works\r\nfor the State of Maryland.\r\n\r\nHe was a man six feet in height, straight as an arrow, and of splendid\r\nphysique.\r\n\r\nHe was married three times. His first wife was Ann Plater, daughter of\r\nGovernor Plater of Maryland; his second, Agnes Freeland, and his third,\r\nSarah Norfleet Freeland of Petersburg, Virginia.\r\n\r\nMajor Peter was one of the largest landowners and farmers in Montgomery\r\nCounty and carried on those farms up to the date of his death, which\r\noccurred at Montanvert, near Darnestown, June 22, 1861. He was nearly\r\neighty-two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAJOR GEORGE PETER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUDGE JAMES DUNLOP]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM REDIN]\r\n\r\nHis three sons by his third marriage were: George, who became an eminent\r\nlawyer in Rockville; Alexander, who lived and farmed near Darnestown;\r\nArmistead, who practised medicine many years in Georgetown; and Walter\r\nGibson Peter, who met the heroic and tragic death I have already spoken\r\nof. Dr. Peter had been sent to Georgetown to live with his aunt, Mrs.\r\nDick, to receive his medical education under Dr. Riley.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 George Peter sold this house, 3017 N Street, to John Laird,\r\nevidently for his son, William, who made it his home until 1834, when it\r\nwas bought by Miss Elizabeth Dick, but she apparently changed her mind\r\nand decided to live with her niece, for she sold it the same year to\r\nWilliam Redin.\r\n\r\nMr. Redin was an Englishman from Lincolnshire, who had come to America\r\nabout 1817. He was an attorney, and I have heard very old people refer\r\nto him as \"Lawyer Redin,\" and speak of the green baize bag which he\r\nalways carried back and forth to his office, the forerunner of the\r\npresent-day brief case, and I know an old lady who can remember him in\r\nhis pew in Christ Church. He had five daughters and one son. The young\r\nman, Richard Wright Redin, soon after his graduation from Princeton,\r\nfell a victim to cholera, that terrible disease brought to George Town\r\nin its ships. It also carried off a young sister, Fanny, who was a\r\nlittle beauty, and only about eighteen.\r\n\r\nMr. Redin was a friend of Henry Foxall, and named his youngest daughter\r\nCatherine Foxall.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War, Mr. Redin was a Union sympathizer, and when\r\nPresident Lincoln removed Judge Dunlop from the bench, he offered the\r\nJusticeship to Mr. Redin, but he refused to take the office of his old\r\nfriend and neighbor across the street. In 1863, he was made the first\r\nAuditor of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nOne of his married daughters was living, during the Civil War, not far\r\nfrom Culpeper, Virginia, almost on the battlefield. She died when only\r\nthirty-seven, from the fact that no medicines could be gotten for her;\r\nnor could a minister be found to bury her, so her eldest daughter,\r\nseventeen, read the burial service over her mother.\r\n\r\nThere were seven of these motherless children left--the eldest three all\r\nvery pretty girls. It was quite impossible for them to remain in their\r\nhome, so their grandfather got permission for them to come to\r\nWashington. They came, wearing sunbonnets, and traveling all day long in\r\na box-car from Culpeper to Alexandria, a distance of only fifty miles.\r\nThere they had to spend the night at a hotel until they could pass\r\nthrough the lines. The Union officer in charge of them slept outside\r\ntheir door that night.\r\n\r\nNot very long after their arrival, Martha Kennon, of Tudor Place, came\r\nto see the eldest girl. They had been at school together a few years\r\nbefore, at Miss Harrover's. She suggested that they should go \"over to\r\nthe city\" together. On the way down to Bridge (M) Street to take the\r\nomnibus, they found they had no small change to pay their fare, so\r\nMartha said: \"Never mind, I have a cousin in a store near here. He will\r\nchange our money or lend us some.\" They went to him and she introduced\r\nmy father to my mother!\r\n\r\nThis was the old Vanderwerken omnibus that ran along Bridge (M) Street\r\nand Pennsylvania Avenue, which became the Capital Traction Company, and\r\nnow the Capital Transit Company.\r\n\r\nI have often heard my mother tell of how the Southern girls would not\r\nwalk under the Stars and Stripes hanging out from the hospital in the\r\nSeminary. They would cross to the other side of the street, and when the\r\nUnion officers passed, they held aside their skirts. She has also\r\ndescribed to me how the city was hung with black when Abraham Lincoln\r\nwas killed.\r\n\r\nMr. Redin bequeathed his house to his only unmarried daughter,\r\nCatherine. She married later, and sold the house in 1873 and regretted\r\nit bitterly, to such an extent that she went into melancholia and\r\ncommitted suicide by taking poison. For a while it was Miss Lipscomb's\r\nSchool for Young Ladies, then it was bought by John D. Smoot, and his\r\nfamily lived there many years.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 Colonel W. E. P. French purchased the property. He leased it\r\nduring the World War I to Honorable Newton D. Baker, then Secretary of\r\nWar. At that time Georgetown had hardly begun to be fashionable again,\r\nand on first coming to Washington and hunting for a house, Mrs. Baker\r\ntold a friend she was discouraged trying to find one with a yard where\r\nher three children could play, and that she thought they would have to\r\ngo to Fort Myer. The friend answered in a tone of deep commiseration,\r\n\"Too bad! You will have to pass through Georgetown!\"\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote of somewhat the same tone was told me by an old lady\r\nwho has lived all her life in one of the loveliest old Georgetown\r\nhouses. Many years ago, while the street cars were still drawn by\r\nhorses, she was in a car sitting opposite two women, one of whom was\r\npointing out the sights to the other. They passed Dupont Circle, where\r\nshe showed the Leiter house, etc., and as they crossed P Street Bridge,\r\nshe said, \"Now we are coming into Georgetown where nobody lives but\r\ncolored people and a few white people who can't get away.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next block east is a little house, entirely changed now, which\r\nused to be very quaint in its appearance when it was covered with white\r\nplaster and approached by a sort of causeway from the sidewalk. It had\r\nbelonged to Henry Foxall, though, of course, he never lived there.\r\n\r\nOn the southwest corner of Gay (N) and Greene (29th) Streets stands the\r\nhouse that was originally the property of John Davidson. Then Mrs.\r\nWilliamson, a daughter of old Dr. Balch made her home here, followed by\r\nher daughter, Mrs. Hasle. Next door, on the west, lived the son, Joseph\r\nWilliamson, whose wife was Marian Woods. Then the Howell family lived\r\nthere, and from them, Colonel Harrison Howell Dodge, who was\r\nsuperintendent of Mount Vernon for over forty years, got his name. Later\r\nthe house was rented to Mr. and Mrs. John Worthington, whose daughter,\r\nLilah, married Mr. Henry Philip in April, 1865. She went to live at 3406\r\nR Street.\r\n\r\nA few years ago a gentleman who was an artist bought the house and\r\nchanged the windows on the first floor front--to give more light for his\r\nstudio, I was told.\r\n\r\nThe picturesque house on the northeast corner is always called \"Admiral\r\nWeaver's house.\" The back portion is very old, and \"they say\" there is a\r\nghost somewhere about. In the spring the hedge of Japanese quince here\r\nis a thing of beauty with its flaming color.\r\n\r\nOn the next block eastward at number 2812 is the house with a very\r\nbeautiful doorway and a very interesting association. It was built in\r\n1779, and was at one time the home of Judge Morsell, but it was called\r\nthe Decatur house. There is the Decatur house on Lafayette Square in\r\nWashington, but we know that Admiral Decatur's widow left it after he\r\nwas killed in the duel with Commodore James Barron, near Bladensburg, on\r\nMarch 22, 1820, and came to live in Georgetown. Tradition has persisted\r\nthat this was the house she lived in. These parts of two letters written\r\nby Mrs. Basil Hall, in 1827, are from a volume called _The Aristocratic\r\nJourney_, being her letters home to her sister in Edinburgh:\r\n\r\n    January 4: ... I had a note to-night from a lady whom I had\r\n    considerable curiosity to see, Mrs. Decatur, the widow of Commodore\r\n    Decatur. I brought a letter to her from Mrs. MacTavish at Baltimore\r\n    and sent it yesterday along with our cards. In this note she\r\n    acknowledged the receipt of it, but excuses herself from calling\r\n    upon me, \"as peculiar circumstances attending a domestic affliction\r\n    she has suffered makes it impossible for her to come to Washington.\"\r\n    She asked us to spend the evening of the tenth with her, or any\r\n    other evening that suits us better, a very kind note, in short, and\r\n    we have promised to go on the eleventh. I knew that she would not\r\n    return my visit before I came. The reason of this peculiarity is\r\n    that her husband was killed in a duel, and she fears if she were to\r\n    go into company either morning or evening she might meet his second,\r\n    who she considers as having been very much to blame, or his\r\n    antagonist. Now all this is very natural, and I only object to it\r\n    because somehow she appears to have made her reasons too much the\r\n    subject of conversation, which is very unlike real feeling. She sees\r\n    a great deal of company at home. Her note smells so detestably of\r\n    musk that it quite perfumes the room and was like to make me sick,\r\n    so we had sealed it up in an envelope, but it shall go along with\r\n    the next of the scraps.\r\n\r\n    January 6: We have had today weather much more like June than\r\n    January, most extraordinary for this climate, where at this season\r\n    there is generally severe frost and snow. I went out with a cloak on\r\n    but speedily returned and exchanged that for a silk handkerchief\r\n    tied round my throat, which was as much as I could bear. Yesterday,\r\n    the fifth, we walked off by eleven o'clock to visit Mrs. Decatur,\r\n    who lives at Georgetown, which is separated from Washington only by\r\n    a little creek, across which there is a shabby enough tumble-down\r\n    looking wooden bridge. There is so thick a fog that we could not see\r\n    three yards before us, \"quite English weather,\" as our friends here\r\n    tell us, but not disagreeable to my mind as it was very mild. At the\r\n    door of Mrs. Decatur's house we met General Van Rensselear, \"the\r\n    Patroon,\" who with his wife and daughter is now here. He went in\r\n    with us and introduced us to the lady of the mansion, who we found\r\n    dressed in very becoming weeds, and she gave us an extremely cordial\r\n    reception. She is a pretty, pleasing-looking person and very\r\n    animated, with no appearance of woe except the outward sign of cap\r\n    and gown. We sat some time with her and walked home....\r\n\r\nIf only Mrs. Hall had been able to say where the house was to which they\r\nwalked from across Rock Creek on that balmy day in January!\r\n\r\nThese other letters which follow are written to a young man then\r\nbeginning to make his way in the world, who certainly was possessed of a\r\nmost attractive personality, and it is not surprising that the widow\r\nmight have been rather \"setting her cap\" for him.\r\n\r\n    My dear Mr. Corcoran:\r\n\r\n    If you should find yourself destitute of amusement this evening,\r\n    while the belles are at church, I beg you to come and listen to some\r\n    of my lamentations.\r\n\r\n    Yours sincerely, S. DECATUR.\r\n\r\n    My dear Mr. Corcoran:\r\n\r\n    I am happy to say that I can take you under my wing today, on the\r\n    way to heaven, and I pray you to call for me at ten o'clock.\r\n\r\n    Yours sincerely, S. DECATUR.\r\n\r\n    Union Hotel, Monday morning.\r\n\r\n    My dear Mr. Corcoran:\r\n\r\n    The Iturbides have deferred their visit until Wednesday evening and\r\n    I hope you will be able to come and meet them, with your sister and\r\n    Colonel Thomas.\r\n\r\n    Yours sincerely, S. DECATUR.\r\n\r\n    If you have a moment to spare this evening I pray you to come and\r\n    tell me how your brother's family are after this dreadful alarm.[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The destruction of Mr. J. Corcoran's dwelling by fire.]\r\n\r\nAs we know, it was of no avail, for he seems to have remained \"fancy\r\nfree\" until he met and married Louise Morris.\r\n\r\nAbout 1828 Mrs. Decatur became a convert to the Roman Catholic Church\r\nthrough her close acquaintance with the Carroll family, it is thought.\r\nThe latter part of her life was spent in a frame house on the brow of a\r\nhill about one hundred yards from Georgetown College, which she rented\r\nfrom Miss Hobbs. Here she died about 1860.\r\n\r\nAmong the souvenirs of the college is the portrait of Commodore Decatur\r\nby Gilbert Stuart, his ivory chess-board and men, and his jeweled\r\ntoothpick box. The grave of Mrs. Decatur was discovered some time ago in\r\nthe cemetery of Georgetown College. It had been overgrown and neglected\r\nand forgotten.\r\n\r\nSo had this part of Georgetown, until Admiral and Mrs. Spencer Wood\r\nbought 2808 and brought it back to its pristine glory. This house was\r\nbuilt by John Stoddert Haw, nephew of Benjamin Stoddert, one of the\r\nfounders of Christ Church, of which many of his descendants are still\r\npillars. When the Woods lived here, there was at the back of the house a\r\nvery lovely, unusual green garden, which gave a feeling of restfulness\r\nnot always produced by a riot of glorious colors, opening off a paved\r\narea under a wide porch, like so many houses used to have.\r\n\r\nThe old house at 2806 is now the home of Mr. and Mrs. John Walker. He is\r\nthe curator of the National Gallery of Art. Thomas Beall of George sold\r\nthe land to John M. Gannt in 1804, who may have built this lovely house.\r\nIt was purchased by Elisha Williams in 1810; also owned by Thomas\r\nRobertson and Thomas Clarke in the first decade of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. In the 1920's it was the home of Mrs. Hare Lippincott.\r\n\r\nAcross the street, at number 2723, a good many years ago, was where\r\nThomas Harrison and his sister lived for a long time. Miss Virginia kept\r\na little school for several years and her brother was a translator at\r\nthe Naval Observatory until he was well up in his eighties. When he was\r\nover ninety he used to go out calling on Sunday afternoons, as spry as\r\ncould be, and with his cheeks as rosy as pippins. They were a couple\r\nmuch beloved and typical of old-time days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\n_The Three Philanthropists_\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Town produced three eminent philanthropists: one whose\r\nbenefactions were solely to Georgetown; a second, who became the\r\ngreatest benefactor the City of Washington has ever had, and inaugurated\r\nthe tremendous gifts to schools and colleges that have since become the\r\nfashion among men of great wealth; the third started his gifts at home,\r\nthen crossed the ocean and made enormous contributions to the largest\r\ncity in the world.\r\n\r\nThe first one, Edward Magruder Linthicum, had a hardware store on the\r\nnorthwest corner of High (Wisconsin) Avenue and Bridge (M) Street, the\r\nbusiness hub then, as now, of Georgetown. He was a trustee of the\r\nMethodist Church and member of the Town Council.\r\n\r\nHe built the home at number 3019 P Street, which has such a beautiful\r\ndoorway, and lived there until in 1846 he moved up on the Heights to The\r\nOaks, for which he paid $11,000. William A. Gordon, in his book _Old\r\nHouses in Georgetown Heights_, says of him:\r\n\r\n    Mr. Linthicum was a prominent and prosperous merchant of the highest\r\n    type, a man of great civic activities, and deeply interested in\r\n    everything which tended to beautify the community. In his will by a\r\n    legacy of $50,000 he provided for the endowment of a school for the\r\n    free education of white boys of Georgetown in useful learning and in\r\n    the spirit and practice of Christian virtue being, as he expressed\r\n    it, convinced that knowledge and piety constitute the only assurance\r\n    of happiness and healthful progress to the human race and devoutly\r\n    recognizing the solemn duty to society which develops in its\r\n    members, and entertaining a serious desire to contribute in some\r\n    manner to the permanent welfare of the community, amongst whom my\r\n    life has been spent.\r\n\r\n    As a commentary on the length to which partisan feeling went in the\r\n    years succeeding the War Between the States, it may be stated that\r\n    efforts to have the Linthicum Institute incorporated by Congress\r\n    were prevented by Charles Sumner, Senator from Massachusetts, for\r\n    the reason that the benefits were confined to white youths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD MAGRUDER LINTHICUM]\r\n\r\nThe Linthicum Institute began its career in the lower floor of one side\r\nof the Curtis school building on P Street, opposite Saint John's Church.\r\nThe name in large gold letters used to be there. The present building\r\nwas erected about 1890 on the south side of O Street near 31st, the\r\nschool occupying the lower floor, and Linthicum Hall, considered by the\r\nbelles of the nineties to have the \"best floor 'par excellence' for\r\ndancing anywhere,\" being the upper portion. I have been told it was the\r\nfirst night school in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nMr. Linthicum was a very imposing looking gentleman, was married, but\r\nhad no children. He and his wife adopted a daughter, Kate, who became\r\nMrs. Dent, and I think it was in honor of her or her son that the little\r\nstreet called Dent Place, just below R and between 30th and 31st Streets\r\nwas named when that part of Georgetown, then nicknamed \"Cooke Park\" was\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM WILSON CORCORAN]\r\n\r\nWilliam Wilson Corcoran, the third son of Thomas Corcoran, was born in\r\nGeorge Town on December 27, 1798, in his father's home on Bridge (M)\r\nStreet. He attended Mr. Kirk's school, later Reverend Addison Belt's,\r\nin between, having been for a while a day scholar at Georgetown College.\r\n\r\nContrary to his father's wishes for him to complete a classical\r\neducation, at the age of seventeen he went into a dry goods store\r\nbelonging to his brothers, James and Thomas. Two years later they\r\nestablished him in a small store of his own on the northwest corner of\r\nHigh (Wisconsin Avenue) and First (N) Streets. Again, two years later\r\nthey all purchased a two-story brick house on the corner of Bridge (M)\r\nand Congress (31st) Streets and commenced a wholesale auction and\r\ncommission business.\r\n\r\nIn the depression of 1823, when very many firms went to the wall, they\r\ntoo had to give up and settled with all their creditors for fifty cents\r\non the dollar.\r\n\r\nI think the aftermath of this story (which is the reason I have given it\r\nin detail) is most encouraging to this generation, struggling in the\r\ngrip of the present depression, for the young man of twenty-five, after\r\ngiving up four or five years to taking care of the business of his\r\nfather, who was growing old, finally became connected with the Bank of\r\nColumbia, and in 1837 began a brokerage business in Washington in a\r\nlittle store 10 x 16 feet on Pennsylvania Avenue near 15th Street. He\r\nwas so successful that he eventually took into partnership George W.\r\nRiggs, also of Georgetown, and changed the name to Corcoran and Riggs.\r\nIn 1845 this firm purchased the old United States Bank on the corner of\r\n15th Street and New York Avenue. And so the Riggs National Bank, today\r\none of the strongest banks in the United States, was born. A little\r\nlater George W. Riggs retired and Elisha, his brother, was made a junior\r\npartner.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 Mr. Corcoran sent to all people to whom he had been able to pay\r\nonly 50% in his failure of 1823, the full amount due them, with\r\ninterest, amounting to about forty-six thousand dollars, to their great\r\nsurprise, as evidenced by letters I have read from them to him. Of all\r\nhis great benefactions, this seems to me to have been the very finest\r\nthing he ever did.\r\n\r\nHe must have been a man of very remarkable personality, witness his\r\ngoing to Europe, the first of the very, very many trips he made in his\r\nlife, on one day's notice, and against much discouragement, persuading\r\nThomas Baring of the great London banking firm of Baring Brothers, to\r\nassist him in a sale of five millions of government bonds. At that time\r\nthe firm of Corcoran and Riggs took, on its own account, nearly all the\r\nloans made by the United States.\r\n\r\nOn his return to New York he was greeted by everyone with enthusiasm, as\r\nthis was the first sale of American securities abroad since 1837--eleven\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1854, Mr. Corcoran withdrew from the firm, thinking he had\r\nmade enough money, and spent the rest of his long life of ninety\r\nyears--forty-five years more--spending his money in a manner unknown\r\nbefore that time.\r\n\r\nApropos of his money-making faculty, I have often been told by my aunt\r\nhow her father, Henry Dunlop, when a boy, was walking along the street\r\nwith young Corcoran, just his own age, when Henry, whose family was\r\nrather well-off in those days, seeing a penny lying on the pavement,\r\nkicked it ahead of him in his stride, as boys will do, but young\r\nCorcoran, stooping down, put it in his pocket saying, \"Henry, you will\r\nnever be a rich man.\" That prophecy came true, for Henry spent his life\r\nin farming, and you know what that means!\r\n\r\nAmong Mr. Corcoran's very first benefactions were gifts to the town of\r\nhis birth. First of all a fund of $10,000 to be spent for firewood,\r\netc., for the poor. It was left to the town authorities, but was\r\nadministered by the Benevolent Society.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 he gave beautiful Oak Hill Cemetery, lying along the northern\r\nlimit of the town. To me no other cemetery that I have ever seen in this\r\ncountry or abroad has the same natural beauty of slopes and trees--in\r\nthe spring bedecked like a bride in flowering white shrubs; in the fall\r\nits towering oak trees aflame with shades of crimson.\r\n\r\nI suppose what impressed on him the need of a cemetery for Georgetown so\r\ndeeply was the death of his beloved wife in 1840. It had been a very\r\nromantic marriage. She was Louise Morris, the daughter of Commodore\r\nCharles Morris. Mr. Corcoran met his wife when she was sixteen and he\r\nwas thirty-six. On the 23rd of December, 1835, they eloped, accompanied\r\nby Mr. Corcoran's sister-in-law, Mrs. James Corcoran, who later became\r\nthe second wife of John Marbury, senior, and to the day of her death was\r\ngreatly beloved by Mr. Corcoran. When she was lying in her coffin on\r\n14th Street, he came there and although somewhat lamed by paralysis and\r\nnearly ninety years of age, he insisted upon climbing the long flight of\r\nstairs to the room where she lay, saying over and over as he toiled up\r\nthe many steps: \"I must see Harriet once more!\" I suppose in his mind he\r\nwas living over the great event in his life when she helped to secure\r\nfor him the only love of his life. And so pitifully short a time he had\r\nher, for only five years afterwards, when she was twenty-one, she died\r\nof tuberculosis. In those short years she had had three children,\r\nHarriet Louise, Louise Morris, and Charles Morris. Of these the middle\r\nchild, Louise, was the only one to grow up.\r\n\r\nAlthough Commodore Morris had greatly disapproved of his daughter's\r\nmarriage, which was very natural as at that time he was one of the most\r\neminent officers of the United States Navy, and Mr. Corcoran had not\r\nthen entered on the career which eventually made him the most\r\ndistinguished private citizen of the capital of the nation, he grew to\r\ngreatly admire and respect his son-in-law. For there are preserved in _A\r\nGrandfather's Legacy_, a collection of letters received by Mr. Corcoran,\r\nand compiled by him before his death, several letters from Charles\r\nMorris, showing the deepest trust and affection.\r\n\r\nI suppose there was never a daughter more beloved and petted than Louise\r\nMorris Corcoran. Her father seemed to expend on her all the affection of\r\nhis great big heart, and she seems to have been a very lovely character.\r\nWhen she was about ten years old she fell overboard from a vessel and\r\nwas only saved from drowning by the quickness and skill of Gurdon B.\r\nSmith. Among these letters are several in regard to this incident, for\r\nMr. Corcoran, in his gratitude for this merciful deliverance, sent\r\nthrough an agent, $1,000 to Mr. Smith, an artisan, who was very grateful\r\nand considered he had received a fortune. But, not satisfied with that,\r\nMr. Corcoran secured an appointment as lighthouse keeper for Mr. Smith\r\nat a point not far from his home, a life position with a good salary,\r\nbut Mr. Smith refused it as he seemed perfectly satisfied with his\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nMr. Corcoran's money doubled and trebled and quadrupled, and the\r\nfollowing letter shows how his judgment was sought on political as well\r\nas financial questions:\r\n\r\n    My dear Sir:\r\n\r\n    I wish you would come to my house about 8 this evening and tell me,\r\n    in five words, what are the best reasons to be given to friends of\r\n    the administration for not passing the sub-treasury bill at present.\r\n\r\n    Yours,\r\n    D. WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nHe had a close friendship with Edward Everett, senator from\r\nMassachusetts, who was frequently his guest. He and ex-President\r\nFillmore traveled abroad together. The letters he received from many of\r\nthe great of the earth make very interesting reading. By the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century this Georgetown boy of rather modest parentage\r\nwas living in a very fine house in Washington, in great elegance,\r\nentertaining everyone of any importance who came to the capital. There\r\nis on record now a letter from a gentleman in England, bringing to his\r\nattention the coming of the new Minister and his wife from Great\r\nBritain, Lord and Lady Napier. Although, as he had said \"he knows he\r\nwill receive a great deal of attention, yet he wishes Mr. Corcoran,\r\nparticularly to honor them.\" He was consulted by presidents for his\r\nopinion on financial matters. Baron Humboldt, the great German\r\ngeographer, kept up a correspondence with him to the day of his death.\r\n\r\nAfter a brilliant girlhood, Louise Corcoran had married the Honorable\r\nGeorge Eustis of New Orleans, representative in Congress. When the Civil\r\nWar came and shattered all existing social ties, Mr. Eustis, of course,\r\ntook the Southern side, as did Mr. Corcoran. Mr. Eustis, who had been\r\nappointed Confederate Secretary of Legation at the same time that the\r\nHonorable John Slidell was appointed Minister to France, after being\r\nheld a prisoner in Maine, went over to France, where he was joined by\r\nhis wife. Neither ever returned to this country. They made their home\r\nthere, their three children were born there, they died there, were\r\nfinally brought back and buried in Oak Hill under the beautiful little\r\nDoric temple Mr. Corcoran had erected for his first Louise.\r\n\r\nThose three grandchildren then became his pride and joy. But more and\r\nmore he absorbed himself in his benefactions. It is impossible to tell\r\nall of them. Beginning with his gift of Oak Hill to Georgetown in 1849,\r\nin 1850 a loan to the Roman Catholic Church there which, like all of his\r\nloans, he eventually turned into gifts; in 1851 he gave an organ to the\r\nLunatic Asylum in Staunton, Virginia, saying he knew of nothing better\r\nthan to give music to those whose souls were so troubled. About this\r\ntime he gave the lot for the Washington City Orphan Asylum, and a little\r\nlater the one for the Y. M. C. A. For many years he had been collecting\r\npainting and sculpture, both on his trips to Europe and from the various\r\npersons who wrote to him soliciting his patronage. These were at first\r\nkept in his own house, but then he decided to build a gallery and give\r\nthem to the City of Washington, so he erected the building on\r\nPennsylvania Avenue at the corner of 17th Street, directly opposite the\r\nState, War and Navy Building. It was just nearing completion when the\r\nCivil War began and was taken over by the United States Government as an\r\nannex to the War Department, so that it was not until 1869 that it was\r\nopened as the Corcoran Gallery of Art. In 1897 the collection was moved\r\nto the beautiful new building lower down on 17th Street and was formally\r\nopened on February 22nd by a brilliant reception at which were President\r\nand Mrs. Cleveland and all of their Cabinet.\r\n\r\nAbove the doorway of the old building, in the stone, is still seen a\r\ncarved medallion with W. W. C. intertwined.\r\n\r\nJust about that time, also, Mr. Corcoran began to build another of his\r\nbeneficent gifts to the city. His beloved daughter had died, and the\r\ncity and the country was filled with ladies who had been made penniless\r\nby the cruel fratricidal war. In 1871 he turned over to the trustees the\r\nLouise Home on Massachusetts Avenue, between 15th and 16th Streets, as a\r\nhome for gentlewomen, the only requirements being enough money to\r\nfurnish their own clothes and their burial expenses, even lots in Oak\r\nHill were reserved for them after the Louise Home failed to suffice. It\r\nwas very natural that for a long time its clientele was largely made up\r\nof Southerners, as there were very, very many more of them impoverished\r\nat that time, and also Mr. Corcoran was himself in sympathy with the\r\nConfederates. It is said he saved his house from confiscation by renting\r\nit to the French Minister.\r\n\r\nMany, very many, were the letters he received thanking him for the help\r\nhe had sent to widows and orphans of soldiers of the South. He founded\r\nhomes of that kind in Charleston, South Carolina, and in other places,\r\nbesides rendering assistance most tactfully in many private cases. Many\r\nof these letters are very touching in their gratitude.\r\n\r\nHis friendship for James Mason, of the Mason and Slidell affair, was\r\nclose, as was his very real association with General Robert E. Lee,\r\nwitnessed by letters from General Lee during his life in Lexington,\r\nVirginia, after the war, and from Dr. William Pendleton, General Lee's\r\nrector there, and from Mrs. Lee in regard to General Lee's death.\r\n\r\nHe and General Lee spent several summers at the \"Old White,\" as the\r\nGreenbriar White Sulphur Springs was then affectionately known. As the\r\nyears rolled on, Anthony Hyde, a Georgetown man, was kept busy\r\nadministering the benefactions of his employer. He has told how during a\r\ntrip through the South after the war, with Mr. Corcoran (he was his\r\nsecretary), he had difficulty in keeping Mr. Corcoran's gifts within\r\nbounds. I was told not long ago by a man in the employ of Oak Hill, how\r\nan old street-car conductor had described to him the sight of Mr.\r\nCorcoran going to his office, and on the sidewalk in front of it each\r\nmorning was a line to which he always dispensed \"green money,\" as the\r\nold man called it.\r\n\r\nThe business of his life then was judiciously giving away his money.\r\nHere are some of the ways he did it: colleges had always appealed to\r\nhim, and he was for many years Rector of Columbian University in\r\nWashington, now renamed George Washington, and gave freely to it. His\r\nname is now borne by one of their largest and best buildings, Corcoran\r\nHall. He gave to the Maryland Agricultural College, to the College of\r\nWilliam and Mary in Virginia, loaned money to the Virginia Military\r\nInstitute and when the bonds came due, tore them up--a little way he\r\nhad. To Washington and Lee University, also in Lexington, he gave\r\n$20,000 besides the library purchased from the widow of Nathaniel\r\nHoward, thus, it helped in the getting as well as in the giving.\r\n\r\nHis portrait hangs in the little chapel in Lexington where lies the body\r\nof his friend, Robert Edward Lee. To the University of Virginia he gave\r\n$100,000 which endowed two chairs, also giving $5,000 to resuscitate the\r\nlibrary which had suffered during the war and the period following, from\r\nbeing unable to procure any new books.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the first people to subscribe to the fund being raised by\r\ncertain ladies to purchase Mount Vernon, after the Washington family\r\nfound themselves unable to keep it up and offered it to the United\r\nStates Government, which refused to buy and preserve it.\r\n\r\nThe Episcopal Church of the Ascension on the corner of 12th Street and\r\nMassachusetts Avenue was built almost entirely with his money. William\r\nPinckney, its rector when it was begun, was very devoted to Mr.\r\nCorcoran. He afterwards became Bishop of Maryland. It worried him\r\nexceedingly that Mr. Corcoran had never become a confirmed member and\r\ncommunicant of the church. Many are the long and eloquent letters he\r\nwrote to him on the subject. Finally, in his old age, the old gentleman\r\ndid come forward and be confirmed. The friendship between these two\r\nseems to have been very sweet. The Bishop was a simple soul, a great\r\nlover of flowers and birds. He was always sending gifts of grapes to his\r\nwealthy friend, from Bladensburg. He now rests not far from his friend\r\nin Oak Hill. The inscription on his stone, which is surmounted by his\r\nstatue reads thus:\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM PINCKNEY, D. D., L L. D.\r\n\r\n    APRIL 17, 1820\r\n    JULY 4, 1883\r\n\r\n    Guileless and fearless.\r\n\r\nAll through his life Mr. Corcoran was a very sociable person. He always\r\nloved to play whist and in the last years of his life his nephews and\r\nnieces and great-nephews and great-nieces used to go often to play with\r\nhim and pass the long evenings. A friend of mine remembers being taken\r\nas a little girl, with her grandmother, to call on him. She was\r\nfascinated by the room where he sat, which had medallions of children's\r\nheads, set at intervals into the paneling of the walls. She said he told\r\nher they were his grandchildren. She loved looking at them and was\r\ndistressed when told to go out in the garden to play.\r\n\r\nThat garden to the house where he lived for many years and where he\r\ndied, stood on H Street at the corner of Connecticut Avenue. Daniel\r\nWebster had lived there before him. The flowering trees in the spring\r\nhung over the high brick wall on the Connecticut Avenue side and\r\ngladdened the hearts of all who saw them. It was a sad day for\r\nWashington, historically, when that whole square was reconstructed. If\r\nonly one could endow old houses!\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 24th of February, 1888, W. W. Corcoran, as he was always\r\nknown, was laid to rest in his own beautiful Oak Hill. I remember as a\r\nlittle girl standing at the window of my home facing 31st Street and\r\nhearing the bell of near-by Christ Church toll ninety strokes as\r\ncarriage after carriage passed slowly up the hill. My brother and I\r\ncounted them, and there were ninety-nine.\r\n\r\nGeorge Peabody, the third of my trio of philanthropists who got their\r\nstart in Georgetown, was born in Danvers, Massachusetts, on February 18,\r\n1795. He was descended from an old yeoman family of Hertfordshire,\r\nEngland, named Pabody or Pebody. At eleven years he was an apprentice in\r\na grocery store, and at fifteen, by his father's death, he was left an\r\norphan and was cheerfully helping to support his mother and sisters. He\r\nsoon after left Danvers and became an assistant to his uncle in his\r\nbusiness in Georgetown. When he was seventeen he served as a volunteer\r\nin the War of 1812 in the artillery company of Major George Peter\r\nagainst the British, which is interesting, as in later life he was\r\noffered a baronetcy by Queen Victoria, which he refused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE PEABODY]\r\n\r\nAfter the war, when he was about nineteen, he became a partner with\r\nElisha Riggs in a dry goods store in Georgetown and through his energy\r\nand skill the business increased tremendously. They moved to Baltimore,\r\nand when his partner retired, about 1830, he found himself, according to\r\n_The Encyclopaedia Britannica_, at the head of one of the largest\r\nmercantile concerns in the world. About seven years afterwards he\r\nestablished himself in London as a merchant and money-broker at Wonford\r\nCourt in the city, and in 1843 he withdrew from the American business.\r\n\r\nHe was never married. He was a very intimate friend of Mr. Corcoran's,\r\nand in several letters to him speaks jokingly of himself as a confirmed\r\nold bachelor, and in one flouts the idea that he is attentive to a\r\ncertain lady, saying that he never but once seriously thought of\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nOf course, he and Mr. Corcoran were near the same age and were both\r\nmaking their way as young men here in Georgetown at the same time, and\r\nit is very interesting to follow, from many letters, how their\r\nfriendship continued through all their lives.\r\n\r\nMr. Peabody made frequent visits to his homeland, and used often to\r\nvisit Mr. Corcoran at his home in Washington, and to spend the summers\r\nwith him at the White Sulphur Springs.\r\n\r\nWhen hearing of the beginning of the great gifts of his friend on this\r\nside of the water, he wrote in October, 1851:\r\n\r\n    However liberal I may be over here, I can not keep pace with your\r\n    noble acts of charity at home; but one of these days I mean to come\r\n    out, and then if my feelings regarding money don't change and I have\r\n    plenty, I shall become a strong competitor of yours in benevolence.\r\n\r\nHe certainly made good his words. In London he entertained in princely\r\nstyle. The following letter is one of the many telling of his parties\r\nthere:\r\n\r\n    London, May 16, 1853.\r\n\r\n    My dear Corcoran:\r\n\r\n    On the 18th I am to give a grand banquet to the American Minister\r\n    and about sixty-five English and eighty-five American ladies and\r\n    gentlemen, and have invited about fifty more for the evening. Mr.\r\n    Van Buren will be of the party and I hope to make it the best dinner\r\n    party I have ever given, as I have the Star and Garter, Richmond,\r\n    and the proprietor has no limit. I enclose you the programme of\r\n    music during and after dinner.\r\n\r\n    I have taken the house--Star and Garter--for a Fourth of July dinner\r\n    to gentlemen only, and expect about 150. I hear from Mr. Ingersoll\r\n    that your friend, Mr. Buchanan, will leave in June. Now, although I\r\n    only know Mr. Buchanan from his high character and what you say of\r\n    him, particularly as he is unmarried, and I would like to invite the\r\n    party for the fourth of July to meet \"the American Minister, Mr.\r\n    Ingersoll, and the new Minister, Mr. Buchanan.\" Will you confer with\r\n    Mr. Buchanan on receipt of this and try to get me permission to give\r\n    the invitations as I propose? If Mr. Buchanan leaves 13th or 16th\r\n    June, he will arrive in ample time.\r\n\r\n    Very truly,\r\n\r\n    GEORGE PEABODY.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 he gave $15,000 to found the Peabody Library in Georgetown. A\r\nlarge donation was given by him to the second Grinnell Arctic\r\nExpedition. The museum in Salem, Massachusetts, called by his name, is a\r\nfascinating collection of historic relics. To his birthplace he gave\r\n50,000 pounds ($250,000) for educational purposes; for the Peabody\r\nInstitute in Baltimore 200,000 pounds ($1,000,000.00); to the trustees\r\nof the Peabody Educational Fund to promote education in the Southern\r\nStates (part went to Washington and Lee University in Lexington). A dear\r\nold cousin of mine has told me of his visit to the White Sulphur to\r\nconfer with Mr. Corcoran and Mr. Peabody on this subject. The thing he\r\nis remembered for in London is the erection of a huge block of model\r\nhouses for working people at a cost of 500,000 pounds ($2,500,000). I\r\nsuppose it was then that Queen Victoria wished to do him honor.\r\n\r\nHis true nature remained untainted by success, and Gladstone said of\r\nhim: \"He taught the world how a man may be master of his fortune, and\r\nnot its slave.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the Congress of the United States awarded him a special vote of\r\nthanks, and two years later, when he died in London on the 4th of\r\nNovember 1869, his body was brought home to America on a British\r\nwarship, to be buried in Danvers, the town of his birth, now renamed\r\nPeabody in his honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\n_The Seminary, Washington (30th) Street and Dumbarton Avenue_\r\n\r\n\r\nNowadays, all to the east of here bordering on Rock Creek has been made\r\ninto a park and playground, and some attractive houses built overlooking\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOn the southeast corner of Montgomery (28th) Street and Dumbarton\r\nAvenue, the large brick building now used as a colored Temple of Islam\r\nwas where Henry Addison, who had been mayor, was living when he died in\r\n1870.\r\n\r\nThis house later was the home of General Christopher Colon Augur. One\r\nnight he came out on his porch to remonstrate with a crowd of negroes\r\ngathered on this corner and making a disturbance. He was promptly shot\r\nby one of them.\r\n\r\nJust east of here on Dumbarton Avenue at number 2720 is the home of the\r\nAlsop brothers, the well-known columnists, and a new Roman Catholic\r\nChurch has been built for the colored people. There are six colored\r\nchurches in the region hereabouts: This Catholic one, three Baptist\r\nchurches, and two Methodists. Mount Zion Methodist on Greene (29th)\r\nStreet is over a hundred years old. In the nineties, there were two men\r\nin the choir there, one an exceptional organist and the other, who had a\r\nvery fine bass voice; he later went to Paris.\r\n\r\nFrom this point to Rock Creek is the district that was known as Herring\r\nHill, a synonym in the minds of old residents for the negro district. It\r\ngot its name from the fact that in the spring great quantities of\r\nherring came up this far into the creek from the river, and were caught\r\nin large numbers.\r\n\r\nI think this account, by Mr. William A. Gordon, of some of the customs\r\nof the negroes in the years gone by is very attractive and interesting:\r\n\r\n    Christmas was the great time for the negroes. Ordinarily, they were\r\n    not allowed in the streets after the town bell rang at nine o'clock\r\n    at night, but at Christmas this restriction was removed, and as\r\n    midnight approached, bands of them would go through the streets\r\n    singing hymns and carols before the houses of their white friends.\r\n    The next morning the leader of the band called at the house and\r\n    received a token of appreciation in the way of small coin.\r\n\r\n    On May Day there was a parade of the negro drivers; many drove\r\n    carts, drays and wagons, for on that day they had holiday, and\r\n    paraded with wagons and horses adorned with ribbons, flowers and\r\n    bright papers, the drivers wearing long white aprons, and headed by\r\n    a band. They would then go to the woods and feast, dance and sing.\r\n\r\nAt the southeast corner of Dumbarton Avenue and Greene (29th) Street,\r\nthe four little yellow houses made into one make the home of Drew\r\nPearson, the widely-known columnist and commentator--co-author with\r\nRobert S. Allen of the original \"Washington Merry-Go-Round.\"\r\n\r\nA block west, on the southeast corner of Washington (30th) Street is a\r\nfine old house where Mrs. James Cassin lived as a wealthy widow during\r\nthe 1850's. She was Tabitha Ann Deakins, of that old family so prominent\r\nin the making of the town.\r\n\r\nJames Cassin had come from Ireland to the City of Baltimore when he was\r\nabout twenty years of age, on account of religious troubles, the motive\r\nwhich sent so many emigrants to the new country. He then moved over to\r\nthis thriving seaport, married and settled, leaving his wife a very\r\nyoung widow with three sons. One of them, John, went far from home to\r\nlive, and his mother's letters to him contain a great deal of\r\ninteresting gossip. In one she tells that Margaret McVean has gone to\r\nBaltimore to buy her wedding dress, and, horror of horrors, has allowed\r\nthe groom, Dr. Louis Mackall, to accompany her. Of course a chaperone\r\nwas in the party, but what an indelicate thing for the groom to know\r\nanything about the wedding clothes! She ends with, \"What are the young\r\npeople coming to?\" How often have we heard those same words in recent\r\nyears. Of course in those days, a bride went into deep retirement for a\r\nweek before the fateful day, not going out into the street at all, and\r\nas for seeing the groom on the day until she met him at the altar, that\r\nwas simply unthinkable!\r\n\r\nMargaret McVean was the daughter of the Reverend James McVean, who was\r\nborn near Johnstown, New York, in 1796. He was a graduate of Union\r\nCollege in 1813, and of Princeton in 1819. It was said that he spoke\r\nseven languages with fluency and that the chair of Greek at Princeton\r\nwas always open to him. He came to Georgetown about 1820 and married\r\nJane Maffitt Whann in 1828. For twenty years he was the principal of a\r\nclassical seminary for boys in Georgetown, the same one founded by Dr.\r\nDavid Wiley. There a large number of young men were prepared for\r\ncollege, who afterwards attained distinction in various professions or\r\ngovernment positions of trust and honor. He was for twenty-five years\r\nsuperintendent of the Presbyterian Sabbath School. He died July 8, 1847,\r\nand as a testimonial of respect, the Board of Common Council and\r\nAldermen, of which he was a member, suspended business for eight days,\r\nand crepe was worn on the arm for thirty days.\r\n\r\nAnother of these letters of Mrs. Cassin's tells that her son, William\r\nDeakins Cassin, has just become engaged to \"that harumscarum Mittie\r\nTyler.\" She fears for their future. Mittie (Mary) Tyler was the daughter\r\nof dear old Dr. Tyler across the street.\r\n\r\nThe mother-in-law's fears certainly did not materialize, for Mrs.\r\nCassin, junior, lived a long and honored life. I remember her faintly\r\nwhen she was about eighty years old, with hair parted in the middle and\r\ncombed down over each ear as \"coal black as a raven's wing,\" as the old\r\nsaying goes.\r\n\r\nThey all seemed to marry their neighbors in those days, for Sue, another\r\ndaughter of Dr. Tyler's married Granville Hyde across the street.\r\n\r\nThe Hyde's house was next door to the Cassin's on the south. One can see\r\nthat it is quite old, and it seems that it was built about 1798 by\r\nCharles Beatty, one of our old friends of the early days of George Town.\r\nHe ran one of the ferries across the river to the Virginia shore. About\r\n1806 he had sold the house to Nicholas Hedges; then it went to James\r\nBelt in 1822, and to Joshua Stuart in 1832. Later, it was bought by Mr.\r\nThomas Hyde, one of the early merchants of Georgetown. His son, Anthony\r\ncontinued to live there and was for many years secretary to Mr. W. W.\r\nCorcoran. Anthony Hyde was very musical and was part of the orchestra\r\nwhich furnished the music in Christ Church before it had an organ. Here\r\ngrew up Mr. Thomas Hyde, who was very prominent in Riggs Bank and an\r\nearly president of the Chevy Chase Club. He was a very distinguished\r\nlooking man to the day of his death.\r\n\r\nOn the northeast corner of Washington (30th) and Gay (N) Streets is\r\nwhere tradition says Ninian Beall built his hunting cabin when he landed\r\nhere. That could be borne out by the fact that a very fine spring of\r\nwater was on that property. Many, many years later the family of Judge\r\nDunlop at 3014 N Street used to send for pitchers of water from that\r\nspring, as they had an inherited right to do so.\r\n\r\nThe long, red building there, now the Colonial Apartments, is still\r\nspoken of as The Seminary. It was there that Miss Lydia English\r\nconducted her fashionable school for young ladies for many years before\r\nthe Civil War. This was the school to which Andrew Johnson, while\r\nsenator from Tennessee, sent his daughter. Years after, when he was\r\nbeing criticized for his defense of Roman Catholics, his enemies brought\r\nagainst him the fact that he had sent his daughter to a \"convent\" in\r\nGeorgetown. They had confused the Visitation Convent with Miss English's\r\nSeminary. It is said that the roster of the patrons of this school in\r\nthose _ante-bellum_ days included the names of the most famous men in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nAmong those names was that of Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri,\r\nnicknamed \"Old Bullion,\" on account of his opposition to paper currency.\r\nHe was one of the supporters of President Andrew Jackson in his war on\r\nthe United States Bank. One of the pupils at the Seminary was his\r\ndaughter, Jessie Benton, who afterwards became the wife of General C.\r\nFremont, known as \"The Pathfinder of the Rocky Mountains.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MISS LYDIA ENGLISH]\r\n\r\nMiss English had large means of her own, which enabled her to keep her\r\nschool going in spite of \"ups and downs.\" But, when in need of advice,\r\nshe would always turn to her near neighbor, James Cassin.\r\n\r\nAt one time she had nine teachers besides herself. In 1835 she had 130\r\npupils. It is said she was a stern headmistress, but she stood for all\r\nthat was fine, and meant a great deal to Georgetown.\r\n\r\nThere is a story told of old \"Aunt Abby,\" whose business it was to sit\r\nbehind the parlor door whenever the young ladies had gentlemen callers,\r\nand how reassuring was the sound of her deep snores. Another story goes\r\nthat the young bloods of Georgetown used to gather on the opposite\r\ncorner where there was a pump and pretend to be getting a drink of\r\nwater, while they were really serenading the hidden charmers, and that\r\nsometimes billet-doux and sweetmeats were drawn up in baskets\r\nunbeknownst to the \"powers that were.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1859, Miss Harrover took over the school. The catalogue for that year\r\ncalls it the Georgetown Female Seminary, and in the front is printed the\r\nfollowing letter from Miss English:\r\n\r\n    To my former Pupils and their Parents, and to other Friends:\r\n\r\n    At the request of Miss Harrover, who, for two years past, has\r\n    satisfactorily conducted the Institution, over which I so long\r\n    presided, and the care of which I relinquished, only because the\r\n    condition of my health and hearing made it imperatively necessary. I\r\n    would state, that my interest in its prosperity is undiminished,\r\n    that I earnestly desire to see it flourish, and that as far as I\r\n    have it in my power, it is my wish to extend its usefulness.\r\n\r\n    In renting the Seminary, I retain my own suite of apartments, and\r\n    have never withdrawn my residence from it. So far as I have\r\n    influence, and opportunities, I endeavor to promote the improvement\r\n    and comfort of the inmates of this establishment. I can not but feel\r\n    a special interest in the children and other relatives of those who\r\n    in former years were under my care and instruction, and it affords\r\n    me much pleasure to see them pursuing their education within the\r\n    same establishment. I shall rejoice to see the number of these, in\r\n    the coming year greatly increased.\r\n\r\n    With kind greetings, and best wishes, I remain,\r\n\r\n    Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n    June 20, 1859.            L. S. ENGLISH.\r\n\r\nAmong the names of the pupils I find that of my mother, and many more\r\nfamiliar to me all of my life.\r\n\r\nWhen the first battle of Bull Run was fought, with such disastrous\r\nresults to the Union Army, this building was immediately taken over by\r\nthe United States government as a hospital, and Dr. Armistead Peter,\r\nalthough a Southern sympathizer, was drafted to be in charge of it. An\r\nold lady has told me how she was brought by her nurse on that Monday in\r\nJuly, the day after the battle, to watch the unloading of the wagons\r\nfull of maimed and bleeding soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe row of frame houses across the street, on N Street, was built at\r\nthat time as barracks for the non-commissioned officers on duty at the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nApparently, after the war, Miss Harrover never resumed her school, as,\r\nin 1870, it was being used as an apartment house. I rather think it must\r\nbe the oldest apartment house in the District.\r\n\r\nThe part of the building on the corner was torn down several years ago\r\nand the Edes Home built. It is a home for Georgetown widows. As the\r\nmoney for it was left by Miss Margaret Edes, who was certainly never a\r\nwidow, and the wording of her will said \"for the indigent widows of\r\nGeorgetown,\" many people think it was a mistake and was meant to read\r\n\"the indigent women of Georgetown.\"\r\n\r\nJust across the street from the Seminary stands the house which was \"Old\r\nDr. Tyler's\" home. First of all, it was the home of George W. Riggs;\r\nafter that, for many, many years, that of Dr. Grafton Tyler, the beloved\r\nphysician. He was a native of southern Maryland, and a cousin of\r\nPresident Tyler.\r\n\r\nDuring his long life Dr. Tyler enjoyed many honors of high professional\r\ndistinction and was the intimate friend and companion of distinguished\r\nstatesmen, jurists, and scholars.\r\n\r\nIn those days doctors took families at \"so much\" a year, including the\r\nslaves. Not long ago I heard this story about the dear old doctor. For\r\nyears and years he had attended a family where there was an addition\r\nalmost annually, and he had never sent a bill. Finally, when they were\r\nall nearly grown, the father inherited a nice little sum of money. Not\r\nlong afterwards Dr. Tyler was called in for a slight illness. When the\r\nfirst of the year came round Dr. Tyler sent a bill. The morning after\r\nits receipt the father burst into the doctor's office in a rage, \"What\r\ndid he mean by sending him a bill? Tut, tut!\" And there the matter\r\nended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. GRAFTON TYLER]\r\n\r\nFor a great many years Dr. Tyler was the physician for Georgetown\r\nCollege. It is still a tradition in the family about the turkeys and\r\nthe very delicious raisin bread that came every Christmas from the\r\npriests.\r\n\r\nHis son, Dr. Walter Bowie Tyler, followed him, but not for long, as he\r\nhad consumption, as tuberculosis was called in those days. He was asked\r\nto be pall-bearer at the funeral of a young lady who, as a dying\r\nrequest, asked to be carried up to Oak Hill because she had a horror of\r\nbeing put in a hearse. Dr. Tyler struggled along for two or three blocks\r\nwhen my father, who was very fond of him, stepped in, pushed him aside\r\nand finished the journey.\r\n\r\nOn the block above, on Washington (30th) Street, in a white, frame house\r\non the west side of the street, lived Captain de la Roche, who was the\r\narchitect of Oak Hill Cemetery and of Saint John's Church where he was a\r\nvestryman when it was remodeled in 1840. Apropos of that, several years\r\nago while I was living away from Georgetown for a short period of years,\r\non one of my return visits, I was standing on the corner of Dumbarton\r\nAvenue and 31st Street waiting for a street-car. The wait was long and I\r\nlooked about me up and down the streets, to the westward, above the tree\r\ntops was an object totally strange to my Georgetown eyes, a church\r\nsteeple of the somewhat Bulfinch type. I reasoned that it could not be\r\nanything but the steeple of Saint John's, but I knew I had never seen it\r\nlook like that--it had always resembled a large pepper pot more than\r\nanything else. Upon inquiry, I found that not long before the vestry of\r\nSaint John's had found that some repairs were necessary on the tower, so\r\none of their number, a civil engineer, ascended with an architect and\r\nwhile hunting around, they discovered part of the original tower still\r\nthere, inclosed in the more modern square building. It was torn away\r\nand the old church now bears part of its original headdress. Only the\r\nlower story of the tower remains as the smaller ones which used to\r\nsurmount it had, of course, been lost.\r\n\r\nCaptain and Mrs. de la Roche had three daughters; two of them had\r\nmarried officers in the United States Army. When the Civil War came\r\ntheir sympathies were with the South. One husband promptly resigned and\r\nwent with the Confederates. The other would not resign but his wife,\r\nbeing a very resourceful person, kept after him, not being able to stand\r\nhaving a husband in the hated Yankee army, until, during a temporary\r\nillness, she got him discharged as not fit for marching.\r\n\r\nCaptain de la Roche having died, his widow was forced to take boarders\r\nat her table, and several of the Union officers availed themselves of\r\nthe bountiful Southern fare. After a while the youngest daughter, who\r\nwas a red-hot rebel, found herself deeply in love with a young Yankee\r\ndoctor. I wonder if he was on duty at the hospital in the Seminary down\r\nthe street? An engagement followed and the marriage was imminent, but\r\nshe could not bring herself to confess to her friends that she was about\r\nto become the wife of one of the despised soldiers. Finally her mother\r\ntold her she must at least tell Mrs. Cassin, their neighbor on the\r\ncorner, who was very devoted to her. So she summoned all her courage and\r\nmarched down the street. After a great deal of humming and hawing, she\r\nfinally got out the news and asked Mrs. Cassin to come to the quiet\r\nwedding at the home next day, but said, \"Please don't tell Mittie until\r\nit is over.\"\r\n\r\nAround the corner from Washington (30th) Street, at 3018 Dumbarton\r\nAvenue, is the house that Mr. George Green built for his large family,\r\nwhen he sold his place, \"Forrest Hill,\" which was part of Rosedale, to\r\nPresident Cleveland for his summer home. This is now the home of Justice\r\nFrankfurter.\r\n\r\nGoing westward along Dumbarton Avenue on the northern side of the\r\nstreet, now high up above it, stands the house where lived Jeremiah\r\nWilliams, a prominent merchant, whose daughter married Paymaster Boggs.\r\nIt is still sometimes called The Old Boggs Place.\r\n\r\nThe great bank of earth there shows what a deep cut had to be made when\r\nthe street was leveled in the days when Alexander Shepherd, as Governor\r\nof the District, performed the office of surgeon on the streets of the\r\ncity. He made of it a wonderful job, but was roundly hated by many of\r\nthe property owners whom he left sitting way up in the air, or\r\ncontrariwise, down in a hole.\r\n\r\nThe house is now divided into two houses--the one on the east, 3035, is\r\nthe home of that fine commentator, Richard Harkness.\r\n\r\nAcross the street at 3040 is where Dr. and Mrs. Louis Mackall, Senior,\r\nlived and their daughter, Miss Sally Somervell Mackall who wrote her\r\nbook about Georgetown called _Early Days of Washington_.\r\n\r\nBefore them the Edes family had lived there. The story is told of Miss\r\nMargaret, she who left the money for the Edes Home, one night, when she\r\nwent up to her chamber, as they were called in those days, that she saw\r\na man's boots protruding from under the bed. Instead of losing her head,\r\nshe began whistling a little tune as she walked about the room, pulled\r\nout the bureau drawers as if looking for something, then went out of the\r\nroom, closed the door and softly locked it, sent for the police and\r\ncaptured the burglar.\r\n\r\nOn the northwest corner of Dumbarton Avenue and Congress (31st) Street\r\nwas the home of Judge Henry Henley Chapman, who came to Georgetown from\r\nAnnapolis in the early twenties. He married Miss Mary Davidson, daughter\r\nof Colonel John Davidson whose brother Samuel was the owner of Evermay.\r\nTwo of Judge Chapman's daughters married Francis Dodge, junior; first\r\nJane, then Frances Isabella. His son, Edward, lived on in the home until\r\nhis death when Mrs. Frances Isabella Dodge took it, had it remodeled\r\nsomewhat, and entertained there a great deal. After her death it was\r\nbought by her stepson, of course also her nephew, Henry Henley Dodge,\r\nand I myself remember going to lovely parties given by his children in\r\nthe big, old rooms.\r\n\r\nThe house was pulled down about 1900 and a row of brick houses built in\r\nits place. It was a handsome house, facing on Dumbarton Avenue, painted\r\na greenish tan, with long porches running along the back building\r\noverlooking the yard which extended back to Christ Church. In this yard\r\nwere two very handsome trees, one a horse chestnut and one a magnolia.\r\nIt was enclosed by an iron fence, one of the kind despised and pulled\r\ndown in the nineties, and now being eagerly sought and replaced in doing\r\nover old houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME OF JUDGE HENRY HENLEY CHAPMAN]\r\n\r\nThere is a delicious story of how, in the long ago, when all five of the\r\ndaughters were still at home, a wandering cow got in at the gate, and at\r\nfour o'clock in the morning (I hope it was the summer time) Aunt Peggy\r\nDavidson roused all the girls to go out and get the beast out of the\r\ngarden. An old colored man was passing, delivering milk, and was heard\r\nto exclaim, \"Good Gawd, Mis' Chapman's yard is full of ghoses!\"\r\n\r\nImmediately across from this house stood, and still stands, the old\r\nBerry house. It, too, shows how it was hoisted above the street when its\r\nlevel was changed. It was built by Philip Taylor Berry in the early\r\n1800's and no other family had ever lived there until his last daughters\r\ndied, ripe in years.\r\n\r\nThere were four of them, all old maids (Georgetown had five or six\r\nhouses of four old maids in my childhood). These were in two sets, but\r\nthe two older ones far outlived the two younger, who were always very\r\nretiring and delicate. When the last two were up in their nineties,\r\nbeing bed-ridden, one on one floor, the other on another, each with a\r\nnurse, they used to send messages to each other and exchange the novels\r\nwhich they read over and over again. At last, one night in the winter,\r\nthe old house caught on fire and when the firemen got there it was so\r\nfar under way that both old ladies had to be carried down ladders to the\r\nstreet, quite a perilous trip, which they both survived, however, and\r\nlived for several years thereafter.\r\n\r\nThe two older sisters were descendants of John Stoddert Haw; the two\r\nyounger, of Samuel McKenney and thereby, of course, of Henry Foxall. One\r\nof them, I heard all of my childhood was very, very pretty, but,\r\nalthough they were both great friends of my mother, I never saw her\r\nface, for she never went out of doors without a heavy, blue barege veil.\r\nIt is said her eyes were weak but there was, too, a romantic story of\r\nher having been \"disappointed in love,\" as they said in those days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD MCKENNEY HOUSE]\r\n\r\nA little farther west on Dumbarton Avenue on the north side of the\r\nstreet, above its stone wall topped with a white picket fence, is the\r\nold McKenney house. This is the house that Henry Foxall gave to his only\r\ndaughter, Mary Ann, when she became the bride of Samuel McKenney in\r\n1800. Until a few years ago, there lived here her granddaughter, Mrs.\r\nMcCartney and her children and grandchildren, the fifth generation to\r\nlive in the old house.\r\n\r\nIt was such a dear, sweet old house and the garden, too. At the marriage\r\nof the daughter of Mrs. McCartney, the lace wedding veil was the same\r\nthat was worn long ago by Mary Ann Foxall, whose namesake she was.\r\n\r\nThe old house was full of treasures and curios, an exquisite little\r\nwhite marble clock which once upon a time ticked off the hours for Marie\r\nAntoinette, that beautiful and tragic queen. It was presented to Henry\r\nFoxall by his friend and partner, Robert Morris, who had gotten it from\r\nGouveneur Morris, he having bought it in Paris. Also there was lots of\r\nlovely old Spode china, and there is a story told of how Aunt Montie was\r\nfound one day feeding the cats from the priceless dishes. When\r\nreprimanded, she explained she didn't want to use any of the \"nice new\r\nchina.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1840 a maiden lady from Philadelphia came one day to have lunch, or\r\nmidday dinner as I imagine it was in those days, and was planning to\r\ntake the stage-coach for her return journey soon after the meal. She had\r\nbeen telling stories to the children and when the time for her departure\r\nneared, little Henrietta McKenney burst into tears; she didn't want such\r\na delightful story-teller to go. Mrs. McKenney urged her to stay, so\r\nshe agreed to stay for a day or two, at the end of that time, for a week\r\nor so. The time passed and she stayed on. Her visit lasted forty years,\r\nand was ended only by her call to another world. She had asked soon\r\nafter her settlement into the home life for some duties so she took over\r\nthe charge of the linen of the household and the making of the desserts.\r\nShe had one fetich, the candles must be extinguished at ten o'clock. She\r\nhad her way, even if guests were present--they were put out. She went to\r\nbed--they were relit. One night after her death, a young son of the\r\nhouse, about thirteen or so, was put to sleep in her room; at ten\r\no'clock the candle just went out. Every night it happened; they hunted\r\nfor drafts. No drafts could be located; the candles just always ceased\r\nto burn when the clocks reached the hour of ten.\r\n\r\nIn this block about 1820 Mrs. Mary Billings, an Englishwoman, opened a\r\nschool where she started to teach both colored and white children\r\ntogether, but a great deal of prejudice arising on the subject, she\r\ndevoted herself entirely to the colored race and continued to do so for\r\na number of years until she moved over to the city. Later, Mr. Street's\r\nschool for boys stood here. It was just opposite the old McKenney house\r\nwith a yard running down almost to High Street.\r\n\r\nThe Methodist Episcopal Church on this block was formerly located on\r\nMontgomery (28th) Street. It had its beginning there in 1800. The church\r\non the present site, which has a modern facade, was used as a Federal\r\nhospital during the Civil War, Dr. Peter being in charge of it as well\r\nas the Seminary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. JOHN'S CHURCH]\r\n\r\nOn the other side of High Street stands St. John's Episcopal Church, the\r\nlot for which was given in 1796 by the Deakins' family. Reverend Walter\r\nAddison of Prince Georges County, Maryland, had visited George Town in\r\n1794 and 1795 and held occasional services, so a movement was started to\r\nbuild a church. Among the subscribers were Thomas Jefferson and Dr.\r\nBalch. The first rector was Reverend Mr. Sayrs of Port Tobacco in 1804.\r\nFive years later he died and was immortalized in an epitaph in the\r\nchurch, written by Francis Scott Key:\r\n\r\n    JOB: J. SAYRS\r\n\r\n    HU: EEL\r\n\r\n    RECTOR PRIMUS\r\n\r\n    HIC\r\n\r\n    (QUO CHRISTI SERVUS FIDELITES MINUS TRAVIT)\r\n\r\n    SEP: JAO\r\n\r\n    OB: 6 JAN. A. D.

'TIS DIVINE--\r\n    AND IT SHALL GUIDE THEE TO A LIFE OF JOY,\r\n    A DEATH OF HOPE AND ENDLESS BLISS THEREAFTER.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 the vestry included Charles Worthington, Washington Bowie,\r\nThomas Corcoran, John Mason, Thomas Plater, Benjamin Mackall, Philip\r\nBarton Key, and William Stewart. A little later, in 1811, an old writer\r\nsays: \"At that time the church was thronged to an over flow with all who\r\nwere most elevated in station and in wealth from the Capital; the pews\r\nin the gallery were rented at high rates and to persons of great\r\nrespectability. The street before the church was filled with glittering\r\nvehicles and liveried servants.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1831 the vestry failed to elect a rector as successor to Reverend Mr.\r\nJames. For seven years, the church was closed, worse than closed, for it\r\nfell into disrepair to such an extent that the birds and the bats made\r\ntheir nests in it, so that it was called \"The Swallow Barn.\" A sculptor\r\nrented it for his studio, which scandalized many of its old-time\r\nworshippers who hated to think of the statues of heathen gods and\r\ngoddesses in the temple of the Lord. At last, in 1838, a vestry was\r\nelected, and from that time, St. John's has always flourished.\r\n\r\nIn its chancel are paintings of the four evangelists done by the\r\nReverend Mr. Oertel. He was also a wood-carver and a musician, and was\r\nfrom Nuremberg in Germany which, I suppose, explains why he was always\r\ncalled Master by his wife. They lived for a good while on Gay (N)\r\nStreet. Mr. Corcoran bought several of his pictures for his gallery. His\r\nbest known work was called \"Rock of Ages,\" and represented a female\r\nfigure with long hair and floating white garments clinging to an\r\nenormous cross. This picture was often used on Easter cards.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago a large boulder was placed on the bank of the\r\nchurchyard, bearing this inscription:\r\n\r\n                COLONEL NINIAN BEALL\r\n\r\n    BORN SCOTLAND  1625      DIED MARYLAND  1717\r\n\r\n            PATENTEE OF ROCK OF DUMBARTON\r\n\r\n           MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF BURGESSES\r\n\r\n        COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF PROVINCIAL FORCES\r\n                    OF MARYLAND\r\n        IN GRATEFUL RECOGNITION OF HIS SERVICES\r\n         \"UPON ALL INCURSIONS AND DISTURBANCES\r\n                OF NEIGHBORING INDIANS\"\r\n          THE MARYLAND ASSEMBLY OF 1699 PASSED\r\n                  \"AN ACT OF GRATUITY\"\r\n        THIS MEMORIAL ERECTED BY THE SOCIETY OF\r\n              COLONIAL WARS IN THE DISTRICT\r\n                   OF COLUMBIA, 1910\r\n\r\nJust behind the church and adjoining it on little Potomac Street, is a\r\nhouse where, fifty years ago, used to live two old maid sisters who were\r\nabsolute hermits. Their food was drawn up in a basket which they let\r\ndown to an old family retainer containing the money with which to do\r\ntheir purchasing. Whenever the organ was played in St. John's, they used\r\nto take a hammer and beat upon the wall as long as the music continued.\r\n\r\nThe large yellow house at the southwest corner of Market (33rd) and\r\nSecond (O) Streets is where Thomas E. Waggaman lived in the nineties. He\r\nbuilt an addition on the west as an art gallery for his collection of\r\npictures. It is now a separate house. Here, some years ago, lived Jouett\r\nShouse at the time he formed his Liberty League. Recently, Colonel and\r\nMrs. Alf Heiberg made it their home. They placed an eagle over the door\r\nand called it \"Federal House.\"\r\n\r\nRight across the street stood a dear old house some years ago. It was\r\nwhite, with double piazzas all the way across the front. The yard was\r\nenclosed by a paling fence and from the gate a double border of box led\r\nto the door. It was the home of Dr. Hezekiah Magruder.\r\n\r\nAbout 1833 the family of Admiral James Hogan Sands lived there. William\r\nFranklin Sands, author of _Undiplomatic Memories_ was one of his sons.\r\nThe old house was torn down about 1890.\r\n\r\nAcross the street, at number 3318, is the home of Mr. and Mrs. David E.\r\nFinley. He is the Director of the National Gallery of Art.\r\n\r\nNumber 3322 is the interesting old house where, in the forties and\r\nfifties lived Baron Bodisco, Minister from Russia to the United States.\r\nHe had a very romantic marriage of which I shall tell later. Just before\r\nthe marriage he purchased this house from Sally Van Devanter, who had\r\ninherited it in 1840 from her husband, Christopher Van Devanter,\r\napparently, the builder of the house. Baron Bodisco, the same day he\r\nbought it, gave it to his fiancee, Harriet Beall Williams. Whether it\r\nwas a wedding gift or whether, as a foreign envoy, he could not hold\r\nproperty, I do not know. She kept the property for twenty years until\r\nher remarriage to Captain Douglas Scott, when it was bought by Abraham\r\nH. Herr. During the Civil War, it was headquarters for the officers of\r\nthe Second U. S. Regiment, whose enlisted men were quartered in Forrest\r\nHall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BODISCO HOUSE]\r\n\r\nBut to return to the period when it was owned and occupied by the Van\r\nDevanter family. During these years, they apparently had a most\r\ninteresting guest, Mrs. Henry Lee, the widow of \"Light Horse Harry,\" and\r\nthe mother of Robert E. Lee. In Dr. Douglas Freeman's book _R. E. Lee_,\r\nhe quotes two letters from Mrs. Lee written not long before her death\r\nfrom \"Georgetown.\" She did not specify where she was, but Mrs. Beverley\r\nKennon, many years afterwards, said that this was the house in which she\r\nresided.\r\n\r\nAlso, the Van Devanter family, a few years ago, found among old books\r\ntwo books with inscriptions of names of the Lee family, evidently left\r\nthere during this time.\r\n\r\nHere, at a ball one night, a young man who was making his entrance into\r\nWashington society under the care of a senator had the following\r\nexperience. (The account is taken from _Harper's Magazine_):\r\n\r\n    This was my first entrance into fashionable life at one of Madame\r\n    Bodisco's birthnight balls. I was under the care of Senator ----. As\r\n    we entered the house, two tall specimens of humanity, dressed very\r\n    much like militia generals, in scarlet coats trimmed with gold lace\r\n    and white trousers, met us at the door. Thinking them distinguished\r\n    people, I bowed low and solemnly. They stared and bowed. \"Go on,\"\r\n    said the Senator, \"don't be so polite to those fellows, they are\r\n    servants; give them your cloak.\" I hurried in pulling off my cloak\r\n    as I went. Just within the first door of the drawing room stood a\r\n    fat, oily little gentleman, bowing also, but not so magnificently\r\n    gotten up as my first acquaintances. Certain of my game now, I, in\r\n    superb style, threw over him my cloak and hurried on. Senator ----\r\n    pulled me back, and to the astonished little fellow now struggling\r\n    from under my broadcloth, I was presented. I had nearly smothered\r\n    the Russian Minister who, however, laughed merrily at the mistake.\r\n    He hardly knew what I would accomplish next, and left me as soon as\r\n    he possibly could, to my fate. I wandered about rather disconsolate.\r\n    The lights, music, dancing, fun and laughter, were all novelties and\r\n    charming for a while, but I knew no one after an hour's looking on,\r\n    hunted up the Senator and begged him to introduce me to some of the\r\n    young ladies. He hesitated a moment, and then consented, and I was\r\n    led up to and presented to a magnificent creature I had long looked\r\n    upon with silent admiration. Miss Gennie Williams, who was seated in\r\n    an easy, nonchalant manner, conversing with a circle of gentlemen,\r\n    and favored me with a gracious nod. As I stood wondering whether\r\n    this was the end of my introduction, a mustached dandy came between\r\n    us and said, \"Miss Williams, permit me to relate the joke of the\r\n    season.\" To my horror he began the story of the cloak. My first\r\n    impulse was to knock him down, my second to run away; on my third I\r\n    acted. Interrupting the recital I said: \"Begging your pardon, sir,\r\n    but Miss Williams, I am the only person who can do justice to that\r\n    joke,\" and continuing, I related it without in any way sparing\r\n    myself. She laughed heartily, as did the circle, and rising from her\r\n    chair, took my arm, saying kindly that I must be cared for or I\r\n    would murder some one. With a grace and kindness I shall never\r\n    forget, she placed me at my ease.\r\n\r\nNext door to this house, at one time, lived Hamilton Bronaugh.\r\n\r\nJust across the street, the big red brick Victorian house is where James\r\nRoosevelt and his family were living in his father's first\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nAround the corner on Frederick (34th) Street, the house which has a\r\nwalled garden on the corner was the home of John G. Winant, when he was\r\nhere before going as Ambassador to the Court of St. James.\r\n\r\nA block or two north of here, at 1524 Market (33rd) Street, was the old\r\nYellow Tavern, much used by those going to and fro to Rockville and\r\nFrederick Town.\r\n\r\nOn Fourth Street (Volta Place), where the playground is now, was where\r\nthe old Presbyterian burying-ground used to be, which was the principal\r\ngraveyard until Oak Hill was given to the town in 1849. Among the\r\ntombstones moved from there, when it was given up, were those of James\r\nGillespie, member of Congress from North Carolina, who was the first\r\nmember of that body to die after the removal of the seat of government,\r\nand John Barnes, who had been collector of the port, and who, in his\r\nwill, left money for a poorhouse for Georgetown. He died in 1826 at the\r\nage of ninety-six.\r\n\r\nOn Sixth Street (Dent Place), between Market (33rd) and Frederick (34th)\r\nStreets, was the house which Francis Deakins sold on February 8, 1800 to\r\nOld Yarrow, as he was called, one of the most mysterious and interesting\r\ncharacters of the early days. It is not known whether he was an East\r\nIndian or a Guinea negro, but he was a Mohammedan. He conducted a trade\r\nin hacking with a small cart, and his ambition in life was to own a\r\nhundred dollars. Twice he saved it and each time ill fortune overtook\r\nhim. The first time he gave it to an old groceryman he knew to keep for\r\nhim. The old man died suddenly and Yarrow had nothing to prove that he\r\nhad had his money. So the next time he picked a young man to keep it for\r\nhim. Then this one absconded. Some of the gentlemen of the town became\r\nso interested that they took up a collection and started an account for\r\nhim in the Bank of Columbia. He must have been quite a figure in his\r\nday, for his portrait was painted by James Alexander Simpson, and is now\r\nowned by Mr. E. M. Talcott, who inherited it from Normanstone.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of attractive houses have been built in this neighborhood\r\nin the last few years and a good many \"done over,\" all of them,\r\nfortunately, in the style suitable for Georgetown.\r\n\r\nThey are very largely owned and occupied by people connected with the\r\nGovernment, many of them in the State Department. In one of these\r\nhouses, a few years ago, lived the writer, Michael Strange, who had been\r\nthe wife of John Barrymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\n_Third Street, Beall (O) Street, West (P) Street_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the southeast corner of Third (P) Street and Frederick (34th) Street,\r\nthe attractive, low, white frame house is where Doris Fleeson lives, who\r\nwrites such interesting articles for _The Evening Star_.\r\n\r\nAt 3327 is a fine tall old brick house painted yellow, which has for\r\nmany years, until very recently, been the home of Hon. and Mrs.\r\nBalthasar Meyer. On the second story it has a lovely long music room\r\nused for dancing and by Sylvia Meyer, their daughter, the talented\r\nharpist of the National Symphony Orchestra.\r\n\r\nSome of the Key family lived here years ago, I suppose, of course,\r\nrelatives or descendants of those two famous lawyers here, Philip Barton\r\nKey and his nephew, Francis Scott Key. And nearby lived another _real_\r\nMarylander named Mary Ritchie.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of names, the strangest woman's name turned up in the title\r\nof 3321, which in 1818 was owned by Harry McCleery. He had five\r\ndaughters and in his will left $3,000.00 to each of four of them; among\r\nthese, one named Zerniah. To Clarissa, the fifth, he left the house he\r\nlived in (this house) and the stone houses on the corner adjoining, with\r\nall thereto belonging to be held in trust for her by her two brothers. I\r\nwonder if Clarissa was an invalid or if it was the law that, at that\r\ntime, a woman could not hold property!\r\n\r\nThis house later on in the eighties and for twenty years or more was the\r\nhome of the Humes. Mr. Thomas L. Hume and his wife, Annie Graham\r\nPickrell left a large family of children when they died early.\r\n\r\nMr. Hume also owned a place a little way out of town. One day when\r\nGeneral Grant, who was a friend of his, was there Mr. Hume said he\r\ncouldn't think of a name for the place. General Grant looked around and\r\nnoticing the walnut trees said, \"Why not turn walnut around and call it\r\n\"Tunlaw\"?\" And so Tunlaw Road came into being, back behind Mt. Alto\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\nJust to the east of 3321 P Street was the old Lutheran burying-ground.\r\nAbout the time of the Civil War it seems to have been abandoned and the\r\nrecords lost. And near here stands the Lutheran Church, the fourth\r\nbuilding on this site, for this church dates back to 1769, when it was a\r\nlittle log building. According to tradition, Dr. Stephen Bloomer Balch\r\npreached his first sermon here when he came to be Pastor of the\r\nPresbyterians. A prized possession of this church is a very old German\r\nBible printed in Tuebingen in 1730. Another treasured possession is the\r\nbell, over a hundred years old, which, at one time, was purchased by a\r\ncongregation in West Virginia, but after twenty-five years, was\r\nreclaimed and brought back by a faithful church Councilman and housed\r\nunder a small stone structure of its own. It is believed to have been\r\ncast in Europe.\r\n\r\nCrossing High Street (Wisconsin Avenue) and cutting down to Beall (O)\r\nStreet, one comes to what used to be Hazel's stable--his initials, \"W.\r\nC. H.\" are in the bricks up in the peak at the top of the building. Here\r\nthe doctors kept their carriages, here \"hacks\" were hired when needed\r\nfor parties or funerals, and here was kept for a month or so every fall\r\nand spring my little bay mare, _Lady Leeton_, and the red-wheeled\r\nrunabout which was brought in from Hayes for my use.\r\n\r\nI can see Mr. Hazel now in his buggy, he weighed about three hundred\r\npounds and his side of the buggy almost touched the ground as he drove\r\nabout town.\r\n\r\nAt 3131, at the home of his daughter, is where General Adolphus Greeley\r\nwas living several years ago when a very interesting event took place\r\none spring afternoon, in 1935. I was walking down 31st Street when I\r\nheard the strains of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" I wondered if I was\r\nhearing a radio but when I reached the corner of O Street I noticed a\r\npoliceman and an Army sergeant chatting in the middle of the street and\r\ncoming up O Street was Justice of the Supreme Court, Owen J. Roberts,\r\nbareheaded, with a lady, to whom he said, \"They are probably saying,\r\n'Some old geezer named Greeley'!\" So I glanced west down O Street and\r\nthere, drawn up along the southern sidewalk, was a company of U. S.\r\nCavalry, red and white guidon of Company F from Fort Myer. Then I\r\nrealized that it was the day of days for General Greeley. At last, on\r\nhis ninety-first birthday, he was being decorated with the Congressional\r\nMedal of Honor. It had been many a year since his fateful expedition to\r\nthe Arctic in search for the North Pole.\r\n\r\nJust across the street from here now lives Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and\r\na little farther on, the old house up on a low terrace is where the\r\nLancastrian School was opened in November 1811 under Robert Ould. In a\r\nfew weeks there were 340 boys and girls under tuition, and in 1812 an\r\nappropriation was asked for an addition to accommodate 250 more\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRIST CHURCH]\r\n\r\nThe Lancastrian School was sustained by private contributions and\r\nmunicipal aid for thirty-two years. The name came from Joseph Lancaster,\r\na Quaker, who started this system in England of coeducational schools,\r\nfree to those who could not pay. Lancaster had a school of one thousand\r\npupils in Southwark, but disagreements arising with some of the\r\nauthorities, he emigrated to America in 1818. He died in New York in\r\n1838.\r\n\r\nAbout 1840, Samuel McKenney, whose house adjoined this property on the\r\nsouth, bought it and gave it to his daughter who had gone to southern\r\nMaryland to live, and so she came back to Georgetown. Her descendants,\r\nthe Osbournes, lived there until just a few years ago when the \"cult\"\r\nfor old houses in Georgetown began. When a garden was made there\r\nrecently, some of the old foundations of the schoolroom were uncovered.\r\n\r\nAlmost next door is the Linthicum Institute, which still conducts its\r\nnight school for white boys, and above it is the hall where the old\r\nGeorgetown Assemblies are still held. Here also Mrs. Shippen has her\r\nDancing Classes, and here now my grandchildren are learning where I had\r\nmy first lessons in the same art. The old hall looks just as it did in\r\nmy day.\r\n\r\nThen at 3018 is Christ Church Rectory, where I happened to be born; it\r\nwas not the rectory then.\r\n\r\nChrist Church, as you recall, was founded in 1817 in Thomas Corcoran's\r\nhouse. The illustration shows the first church building of the three\r\nwhich have stood on this spot. It was begun May 6, 1818, and the first\r\nservice held at sunrise on Christmas Day that same year, the rector\r\nbeing the Reverend Ruel Keith, who was Professor of Theology at the\r\nCollege of William and Mary, and later, in 1823, with Dr. Wilmer,\r\nfounder of the Theological Seminary, near Alexandria.\r\n\r\nAmong the founders of Christ Church were Thomas Corcoran, William\r\nMorton, Clement Smith, Francis Scott Key, John Stoddert Haw, John Myers,\r\nUlysses Ward, James A. Magruder, Thomas Henderson, and John Pickrell.\r\nThe present building of Christ Church was erected about 1885. The\r\nwindows which were made especially for it in Munich, Germany, are very\r\nbeautiful. The big one in the north end was put there by W. W. Corcoran\r\nin memory of his father, Thomas Corcoran.\r\n\r\nI have heard from the daughter of one of the belles of the fifties,\r\nwhose family were Christ Church people, that in those days the beaux\r\nmight join a lady after church and escort her home, but under no\r\ncircumstances did they entertain callers on Sunday. All of the food for\r\nSunday use was prepared on Saturday.\r\n\r\nIt was during the fifties that Dr. William Norwood was the rector of\r\nChrist Church. He was a Virginian and very outspoken in the expression\r\nof his political views in that day of heated opinions. So violent was\r\nthe feeling that, although he had a brilliant mind and a saintly\r\ncharacter, he was obliged to resign. He returned to his native State and\r\nwas for many years the revered rector of St. Paul's, Richmond. I\r\nremember hearing that as a young man he had a classmate at college,\r\nClement Moore, who one night came into his room, saying, \"Norwood, I'd\r\nlike to read you something I've written to see what you think of it.\" He\r\nsat down and read to him \"The Night Before Christmas,\" that beloved old\r\npoem without which Christmas hardly seems like Christmas to me, even\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nDr. Norwood was followed several years later by Reverend Albert Rhett\r\nStuart, under whose leadership the present church was built. I remember\r\nthe big basket which was carried around by a fine-looking, tall colored\r\nwoman with articles for sale for the benefit of the Ladies' Aid Society\r\nof Christ Church.\r\n\r\nThe interesting white house over on the northeast corner was at one time\r\nthe home of the Godeys, then of the Curtis family. When they lived\r\nthere, \"music filled the air,\" for a son and a chum of his used to sit\r\nout on the long, side gallery and play for hours on the violin and\r\n'cello. It was for several years the home of Justice and Mrs. Owen J.\r\nRoberts.\r\n\r\nOnly two houses on this block are of any age. The little white cottage\r\nnear the corner of Washington (30th) Street was the home of three Miss\r\nTenneys and their sister, Mrs. Brown, who had a school for small boys\r\nand girls. Then the garden ran to the corner. The father of these ladies\r\nand of William H. Tenney had come to Georgetown from Newburyport,\r\nMassachusetts, in the early part of 1800.\r\n\r\nJust across from it, the large yellow mansion was the home of Commodore\r\nCassin, built by him, I think, in the early 1800's. In 1893 Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBeverley Randolph Mason, of Virginia, opened here their school, Gunston\r\nHall, named, of course, for Mr. Mason's ancestral home, which continued\r\nin Washington as a flourishing boarding school for girls for fifty\r\nyears. After that, this building housed the Epiphany School, an\r\nEpiscopal institution.\r\n\r\nThe property along 30th Street here was all owned at one time by the\r\nMatthews family. Henry Cooksey Matthews came to Georgetown some years\r\nbefore 1820. He had been born in 1797 on the farm near Dentsville, in\r\nCharles County, Maryland, where his forbears had lived for four\r\ngenerations. He married his cousin, Lucinda Stoddert Haw, whose home,\r\nyou remember, was on Gay (N) Street, and they built the large house on\r\nthe southeast corner of Washington (30th) and West (P) Streets.\r\n\r\nMr. Matthews and his wife were devoted members of Christ Church and\r\nnamed their son for one of its rectors, the Reverend Charles McIlvaine,\r\nwho later became Bishop of Ohio. Mr. Matthews used to play the flute in\r\nthe orchestra in Christ Church.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles M. Matthews also married his cousin, who was a daughter of\r\nThomas Corcoran, junior, and niece of W. W. Corcoran. Mr. Matthews,\r\nuntil his death, managed the estate of Mr. Corcoran. He built his home\r\non the southern part of his father's lot at the northeast corner of\r\nWashington (30th) and Beall (O) Streets.\r\n\r\nBack in the eighties Miss Charlotte and Miss Margaret Lee came from\r\nVirginia and opened The West Washington School for Girls, sponsored by\r\nseveral of the gentlemen of Georgetown, in the old home of Henry C.\r\nMatthews. There, in the last year of its existence, I learned the\r\nbeginnings of the three R's.\r\n\r\nNearby, at number 3014 P Street, in the fifties and sixties, William R.\r\nAbbott conducted a well-known school for boys. At that time it was only\r\na one-story building. Mr. Abbott was the son of John Abbott, whose home\r\nwas on Bridge (M) Street. The Abbotts lived in the house on the west\r\nnext door to the school. In later years it was occupied by the Lyons,\r\nHartleys, and Parris families.\r\n\r\nIn one of these houses was the school for boys founded by Dr. David\r\nWiley and continued for twenty more years by Dr. James McVean.\r\n\r\nThere is a fine row of houses just beyond here where have lived, at\r\nvarious times, the Magruders, the Kenyons, the Yarnalls, and, long ago,\r\nin the early 1800's, Colonel Fowler, who came from Baltimore and whose\r\nwife was a sister of Dr. Riley's wife, made his home at number 3030 West\r\n(P) Street.\r\n\r\nFor many years this house was used as the rectory of Christ Church.\r\nThere lived Dr. Norwood and his large family of daughters, all of whom\r\nleft their impression on the City of Richmond in after years. Also, Dr.\r\nWalter Williams, and Dr. Albert Rhett Stuart, of South Carolina, who was\r\nfor twenty-five years rector of Christ Church.\r\n\r\nThe end house was the Morton's home for a great many years. Four\r\nunmarried sisters lived there long, long after their parents had gone.\r\nBut parental influence was strong in those days, for one of them in her\r\nlate seventies was still \"engaged\" to the love of her youth, disapproved\r\nof by her father. Once a week she met him and had lunch with him down\r\ntown. He came sometimes to Sunday dinners, swathed in his long, black\r\ncape.\r\n\r\nDuring the fall great droves of cattle and flocks of sheep from western\r\nVirginia were driven through the streets and gathered at Drovers' Rest,\r\ntwo miles west of town. Some days many thousands filled West (P) Street\r\nfrom morn to eve, and, occasionally, a wild steer ran amuck and then\r\nthere was great excitement. Also, large flocks of turkeys, hundreds of\r\nthem, were driven up from lower Maryland and passed through the streets\r\nto pens on the outskirts of town, where one could go and pick out his\r\nown bird.\r\n\r\nAcross the street at number 3019 is the house Mr. Linthicum built in\r\n1826. Thomas Corcoran, junior, made it his home from then until 1856,\r\nwhen it was bought by John T. Cochrane for his sister, Mrs. James A.\r\nMagruder, who brought up there her three nieces and one nephew. Two of\r\nthe nieces, Miss Mary Zeller and Mrs. Whelan, lived on there all their\r\nlives. Miss Mary used to tell me many tales of old-time days and ways.\r\nThe old house remained entirely unchanged until about twelve years ago,\r\nwhen it was bought and done over inside. It had a lovely stairway and\r\ndignified, square rooms.\r\n\r\nThe row of three quaint little brick houses here seem to be an unknown\r\nquantity to even some of the oldest inhabitants and nearest neighbors.\r\nIn number 3021, long ago, lived Horatio Berry, the brother of Philip\r\nTaylor Berry. In number 3025, the quaint locks on the doors all have on\r\nthem a small, round brass seal, bearing the coat-of-arms of Great\r\nBritain, the lion and the unicorn rampant, also the name \"Carpenter &\r\nCo.\", and in the cellar are crossbeams hewn by hand.\r\n\r\nNext we come to a pair of cottages, changed from their pristine\r\nloveliness--now the \"Mary Margaret Home,\" for old ladies. The one at\r\n3033 P Street in my girlhood was the home of Mrs. James D. Patton, the\r\nformer Jennie Coyle. She gave me piano lessons for four years, but she\r\ngave me much more! She formed a group of girls into a King's Daughters'\r\nCircle, \"The Patient Workers,\" which met at her house on Saturday\r\nmornings when we sewed and made articles which we sold at a Fair in the\r\nSpring. The proceeds were divided between the Children's Country Home\r\nand the Children's Hospital. There is still a brass plate in the\r\nhospital bearing the name, \"The Patient Workers\" for a bed we named.\r\n\r\nThe two big houses on the northeast corner of West (P) Street and\r\nCongress (31st) Street were built by Joseph H. Libbey, a well-to-do\r\nlumber merchant. They continued to be in his family for a long time. The\r\none on the east now is the Catholic Home for Aged Ladies. In front of it\r\nis the largest and most beautiful elm tree in Georgetown. The two houses\r\nat 1516 and 1518 Congress (31st) Street, Mr. Libbey built about 1850 as\r\nwedding gifts for his two daughters, Martha, Mrs. Benjamin Miller,\r\nbecoming the owner of number 1516. It is still owned by her descendants.\r\nNumber 1518 has changed hands several times. It was where Richard V.\r\nOulahan, the well-known newspaper correspondent, lived until his death\r\nseveral years ago. At that time it was said of him: \"He gathered news\r\nlike a gentleman and wrote it like a scholar.\"\r\n\r\nBack in the eighties, a party was given at number 1518 one night for the\r\nyoung niece of two maiden ladies whose home it then was. The guests were\r\nabout sixteen and seventeen years old, and the boys had all just arrived\r\nat the age where their most treasured possessions were their brand new\r\nderby hats. When the party broke up and the guests trooped upstairs to\r\nget their wraps, the young gentlemen found, on entering their dressing\r\nroom, that on one of the beds reposed the crowns of all their derbies,\r\nwhile on the other, neatly laid out, were all the brims. The culprit was\r\nnever caught. Only the other day one of the long-ago guests was told by\r\nthe offender that he had been the originator of the diabolic idea.\r\n\r\nIf you look west along the next block of West (P) Street, you notice how\r\ndifferent are the north and south sides. Along the south side are houses\r\nof an absolutely different period. All those on the north side were\r\nbuilt in the seventies or later, including the Presbyterian Church,\r\nexcept the one on the corner of Congress (31st) Street, which was the\r\nresidence of General Otho Holland Williams, a Revolutionary officer, who\r\nwas in the same company with General Lingan. His house has, of course,\r\nbeen completely changed and made into two houses. It was never\r\nbeautiful, but it was a dignified old mansion, with high steps leading\r\nup to a quaint doorway.\r\n\r\nAcross Congress (31st) Street, at number 3108 West (P) Street, the house\r\nwith the high steps going up sideways was built by Judge Morsell about\r\n1800. For a while, the Barnards lived there. Then the Marquis de\r\nPodestad, Minister from Spain to this country, made it his residence.\r\nAfter the Civil War, General George C. Thomas resided there. Next door\r\nis where the Shoemakers have lived for many years.\r\n\r\nThe house with the nice, old hipped roof was at one time owned by a\r\nCaptain Brown. In the eighties and nineties the Misses Dorsey of\r\nVirginia had here a school for girls called \"Olney Institute.\"\r\nAfterwards, Reverend Parke P. Flournoy, once a chaplain in the\r\nConfederate Army, lived here up into his nineties with his family.\r\n\r\nStill a little farther on, and incorporated with the old Tenney house,\r\nnow owned by Mrs. Stephen Bonsal, is where Miss Jennie Gardiner had a\r\nschool for little children about the same time as the Dorseys' school.\r\nFor some time before the Civil War it was the home of the Reverend Mr.\r\nSimpson, whose wife was Miss Stephenson from near Winchester. Her\r\nfather, whose home was Kenilworth, near there, made her a present of the\r\nhouse. Following the Civil War, it was for a long time the home of\r\nWilliam H. Tenney, who had a prosperous flour mill.\r\n\r\nJust across the street from it, the imposing looking yellow house with\r\nthe mansard roof is the one that Elinor Glyn bought and \"did over,\" and\r\nthen never lived in, as she decided to go back to England to her mother,\r\nwho was in delicate health. Later it was the residence of Mrs. Isabella\r\nGreenway, Representative in Congress from Arizona.\r\n\r\nA block from here just above Q Street on what is now dignified by the\r\nname of 32nd, but will always remain to old Georgetonians, Valley\r\nStreet, lived a very interesting character, still remembered by some\r\npeople in Georgetown as \"The crazy man of Valley Street.\"\r\n\r\nAmong other shabby houses, one which was quite different in appearance\r\nand stood a little back from the street, with a tree in its tiny patch\r\nof a yard, was where he lived. It looked as if it had a story--and it\r\nhad. It was told me not long ago by an old friend. I call him a friend,\r\nfor whenever I went to the institution where he was a doorkeeper, I went\r\nback in memory to the years when he was our postman. In those days your\r\npostman was your friend. You thought over what your Christmas gift to\r\nhim would be as much as a member of your family. Not like it is\r\nnowadays, when he drops your letters through a slit in the door. You\r\ndon't know his name, you don't know what he looks like, you don't even\r\nknow whether he is white or colored.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of \"the crazy man of Valley Street.\" During the Civil\r\nWar, Captain Chandler was in command of a United States vessel cruising\r\nin the Chesapeake Bay searching ships carrying contraband. He was\r\naccused of making a traitorous remark and dismissed from the service.\r\nHis family was living at the Union Hotel, but they left and went to New\r\nYork to live. He took his savings and built for himself the little house\r\non Valley Street. Its interior was made to resemble exactly the cabin of\r\na ship.\r\n\r\nMy friend told me that his first encounter with the old gentleman was\r\none Monday morning about nine-thirty when, having been changed to this\r\nnew route, he stopped to open the gate to deliver a letter. It was\r\nlocked. He knocked. At last a window was thrown up and the old man's\r\nhead emerged. He said the captain looked very much like the pictures of\r\nGeneral Robert E. Lee.\r\n\r\nSeeing it was the postman with a letter, he said he would open the gate,\r\nso he pulled a rope--and presto! open it flew. He said he never opened\r\nit until ten o'clock in the morning and wanted to know if his mail could\r\nbe delivered after that, which the carrier obligingly offered to do, by\r\nchanging his route somewhat.\r\n\r\nAfter that, for years, Mr. Postman was a friend to the old man, though\r\nhe never really entered the house. Each month a check for twenty dollars\r\nwould come from a nephew in Chicago, which the postman would take to Mr.\r\nBerry with a note from the captain, asking to have it cashed, and\r\nspecifying the number of dollar bills, fifty-cent pieces, quarters,\r\ndimes, nickels, and pennies. A little colored boy who lived nearby was\r\ncommissioned occasionally to purchase necessary food, but the old man\r\nhimself never went out except after dark.\r\n\r\nFinally, one day when the little boy came to do the errands, he could\r\nget no answer to his knock, so he got a man to lift him up where he\r\ncould peer over the high board fence at the side and look into an open\r\nwindow. Through it he saw the old gentleman, sprawled out in a big\r\nchair, immovable. They broke into the house and found that he was\r\nparalyzed. He could not speak, but shook his head when they said they\r\nwanted to call help from the police. He was laid on a mattress on the\r\nfloor, and before long, all his troubles were over.\r\n\r\nHis nephew came from Chicago, bought a lot in Rock Creek Cemetery and\r\nhad the old gentleman decently buried. But not long after, his son in\r\nNew York, reading of it in the paper, came down and had his father\r\nreinterred in the family lot in Oak Hill. So, in death, the old\r\ngentleman was accorded the honor of two funerals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Courtesy Frick Art Reference Library_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON BOWIE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\n_Stoddert (Q) Street_\r\n\r\n\r\nComing east from Valley (32nd) Street is the lovely old house which the\r\nSeviers bought in 1890. It has never had a name. It was built by\r\nWashington Bowie, another of the shipping barons. His wife was Margaret\r\nJohns before becoming Mrs. Bowie. This whole block was his estate and\r\nwas entered in his day through the double iron gates on West (P) Street.\r\nThe carriages passed up and around a circle of box to the path, bordered\r\nwith box leading to the porch with its lovely doorway. The doors opening\r\ninto the hall that runs right through are of solid mahogany with big old\r\nbrass locks. In the dining room is an especially beautiful white wood\r\nmantel, carved with a scene of sheep and shepherds. The tradition is\r\nthat L'Enfant planned the garden, and also left his spectacles lying on\r\nthe piano.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 the place was bought by William Nicolls of Maryland, whose wife\r\nwas Margaret Smith, a descendant of Captain John Smith. They had two\r\ndaughters, Roberta, who married William Frederick Hanewinckel of\r\nRichmond, and Jennie, who married Colonel Hollingsworth. The\r\nHanewinckels used to come back to the old home sometimes in the summer,\r\neven to the grandchildren, and the descendants still love the old place\r\nand consider it their ancestral home, for they had it longer than any\r\nother family. Colonel Hollingsworth was the superintendent of Mount\r\nVernon before Colonel Dodge. I remember Colonel Hollingsworth well, a\r\ntall, fine-looking old gentleman, with a long, white beard. Of course,\r\nin those days we went to Mount Vernon by way of the river, on the\r\nsteamer _W. W. Corcoran_. It is still, I think, by far the most pleasant\r\nway to approach the dignified old mansion, and Captain Hollingsworth\r\nwould often be on the boat and talk with us. I've never forgotten the\r\ndear old-fashioned nosegay he picked and gave me from Mrs. Washington's\r\ngarden. Mrs. Hollingsworth was a tiny little old lady. I can see her now\r\nwith her snow-white hair and her big, black bonnet. Poor soul, it was a\r\nterrible trial to her when the place had to be sold after her husband's\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SEVIER HOUSE (BUILT BY WASHINGTON BOWIE)]\r\n\r\nIt was put up for auction in 1890, and Mr. and Mrs. John Sevier, who\r\nhappened to be visiting Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dodge in Georgetown at that\r\ntime, though they spent a great deal of their time in Paris, heard of\r\nthe sale and bought the house on the spot. Mr. Sevier was a descendant\r\nof the famous Tennesseean of that same name. Later they added the wings\r\nextending far out on each side, which are really two charming little\r\nhouses. The old garden is still full of wonderful box, and besides,\r\nthere are lots and lots of lovely roses, the pride of their stately\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sevier told me of being at a spa in Germany one summer when she was\r\nyoung, with Mr. Sevier. When they asked for the first floor apartment\r\ninstead of theirs on the second, they were told by the proprietor that\r\nit was engaged for \"some Englishman; he did not know whom.\" It turned\r\nout to be the then Prince of Wales, Edward VII. The prince, on seeing\r\nher, asked to be presented. She was very beautiful then, tall and fair.\r\nShe met him three times, in the garden or at the spring. When he was\r\nleaving, he asked to say good-bye. She, unthinkingly, stood on the step\r\nabove him, (a terrible _faux pas_, she learned afterwards), gave him\r\nsome roses, and he presented her with a bouquet surrounded by lace\r\npaper; it was the custom, always, on leaving a place.\r\n\r\nWhen my father built his house in 1884 on the southwest corner of\r\nStoddert (Q) Street and Congress (31st) Street, it was in part of the\r\norchard of the old Bowie place. Some of the pear trees were still there.\r\nToday there are six houses on the lot where his house stood with its big\r\ngables and its many porches, surrounded by a fine lawn in which he took\r\ngreat pride. This house caused a good deal of comment at the time of its\r\nbuilding from the fact that it had a bathroom on every floor, one being,\r\nof course, a \"powder room.\" But to have a bathroom in the basement for\r\nthe servants in those days was unheard of. It was just as good as the\r\nothers, a tin-lined tub, of course, would be horrible to the present\r\ngeneration!\r\n\r\nThe house was always brimming over with people, young and old, for\r\noccasions both grave and gay. One very grave one happened about two\r\nyears after we moved there, and another \"first\" in Georgetown was\r\nthere--the first trained nurse in Georgetown. Early in the month of May\r\ndiphtheria seized the eldest daughter, then about fifteen. Two days\r\nlater, another succumbed, a beautiful little girl of five. There was no\r\nanti-toxin in those days. In four days little Eleanor Hope was dead. Two\r\ndays later a little cousin visiting there, was taken, and two days later\r\nstill, the three remaining well children were sent out one afternoon for\r\na drive with Grandpa in the Dayton-wagon, an old-time version of the\r\npresent-day station wagon. We thought it was kind of strange to go to\r\ndrive in the rain, but it wasn't really raining hard, so we stopped\r\nwhere the Cathedral Close is now and picked bluets and violets. When we\r\ngot home we were told we had a new little brother! Wildly excited, we\r\nrushed upstairs and assaulted the door of mother's room. It was opened\r\nby old Aunt Catherine, the colored mid-wife, who had been told not to\r\nadmit anyone, but mother called us and in we went. An hour or so later I\r\nwas the fourth victim of diphtheria! I still have vivid memories of it\r\nall, and of Miss Freese, the trained nurse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Courtesy Bolling-Fowler_.\r\n\r\nTHE GEORGE T. DUNLOP HOUSE]\r\n\r\nShe wore a uniform of blue and white striped cotton, long to the floor,\r\nbut, strange to say, her hair was short, unusual for those days. I can\r\nstill see the animals she cut out of paper--elephants, horses, and cows.\r\nDear Aunt Ellen and Auntie helped with the nursing, and father even\r\nstayed home some days to help!\r\n\r\nThese were some of the grave days, now to come to the gay. I remember\r\nthe big reception for father's and mother's silver wedding anniversary,\r\nwhen I and my two chums, I in red, one in white, and one in a blue\r\ndress, stood back behind this fine couple, thinking we were so\r\nwonderful! My best friend lived right across the street, and we rigged\r\nup a line from my window to hers on which we sent little notes by\r\npulling the line around.\r\n\r\nMy two elder sisters had many beaux, and I mean, \"many.\" I can remember\r\nwhen some times twenty young gentlemen came to call on Sunday evening.\r\nOf course, there were not many \"dates\" in those days, unless to go to\r\nthe theatre or a party of some kind, dancing or euchre.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday night when the butler was off duty, my brother, home from\r\nPrinceton, answered the door bell. A gentleman entered, asking if the\r\nladies were at home; he handed his silk hat to John, then his cane, then\r\nhis coat, and then, he said \"Now, announce me!\" He was announced! As he\r\nsat on the sofa by my cousin, a visitor from Kentucky, a real Kentucky\r\nbelle, a horrified expression came over his face. She, thinking he had\r\nbeen attacked by the new disease, appendicitis, which she had heard was\r\nvery painful, asked what was the matter, to which he replied, \"I have\r\njust discovered I have on blue trousers instead of black!\" He was in his\r\nfull-dress suit.\r\n\r\nOn our side of Congress (31st) Street was one of the houses holding four\r\nold maids, the daughters of John Davidson, one of the oldest names in\r\nGeorgetown: Miss Adeline, Miss Nannie, Miss Kate, and Miss Martha. Their\r\nmother had died on her knees in Christ Church from a stroke.\r\n\r\nAcross the street lived four maiden ladies by the name of Mix--one of\r\ntheir brothers married a Miss Pickle!\r\n\r\nOf course, before Stoddert (Q) Street was cut through, the Bowie house\r\nadjoined the property of Tudor Place, and they were on a level. I can\r\nremember when the street was paved, and now that it is one of the\r\nbusiest boulevards of the city, it seems almost impossible to believe\r\nthat back in the nineties a houseful of charming-girls, real\r\nold-fashioned belles, used often to \"erupt\" with their many beaux from\r\ntheir home on the neighboring corner, at eleven o'clock some evenings,\r\nand have a dance right in the middle of the street--two-steps and\r\nwaltzes galore!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME OF FRANCIS DODGE]\r\n\r\nOn the southeast corner of Congress (31st) Street and Stoddert (Q)\r\nStreet stood, until 1893 or 1894, the very interesting old house where\r\nFrancis Dodge and his large family lived for many, many years. The\r\nillustration does not do justice to the dear old house, but I wanted to\r\ngive some idea of it as a whole, so selected this one. The long,\r\nsouthern side overlooking the garden had tiers of white wooden galleries\r\nand the face of the house under them was plastered white. In the center\r\nof the long stretch of wall was a lovely, big doorway with a fanlight,\r\nof course, and at the end of the porch, a smaller door which entered a\r\nprojecting wing of the house.\r\n\r\nThe place was enclosed by a low, brick wall topped with a white picket\r\nfence, and standing near the corner was a gorgeous horse-chestnut tree.\r\nWhenever I see one now, I recall this particular tree with its lovely\r\nblossoms in the spring and their delicious fragrance. A flight of wooden\r\nsteps led from a brick walk at the gate to the gallery, and another\r\nflight from the same walk down into the garden. Under the porch was a\r\nbrick pavement where was the pump, and then there was the garden--a\r\nwonderful old garden adorned with a maze of box which, of course,\r\nenclosed flower-beds.\r\n\r\nThe whole square, bounded by Congress (31st), West (P), Washington\r\n(30th), and Stoddert (Q) Streets, belonged to this estate. It was\r\noriginally the property of Nicholas Lingan who owned the mill on Rock\r\nCreek, and who was a brother of General Lingan. At that time, these big\r\nplaces really were farms, with stables for horses, cows, pigs, and\r\nchickens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANCIS DODGE, SENIOR]\r\n\r\nIn 1810 the property was bought by Francis Dodge, who, as I have said\r\nbefore, had come from Salem as a lad of sixteen to join his brother,\r\nEbenezer, who was established in a prosperous coastwise shipping trade,\r\ndealing largely with the West Indies.\r\n\r\nOne of the first experiences young Francis had, after his arrival in\r\n1798, was one afternoon when he returned from a row up the river, and as\r\nhe was mooring his boat, he noticed an elderly gentleman hurrying down\r\nthe street and out onto the wharf. The gentleman asked if the ferry was\r\nin yet, and when the boy turned to answer him and looked into his face,\r\nhe saw that it was General Washington. Francis replied that the ferry\r\nhad gone and, noting the terrible disappointment of the great man,\r\noffered to row him across the river in his own little boat. The General\r\ngladly accepted, and during the crossing asked the young man his name.\r\n\"Francis Dodge, sir,\" the boy replied, at which the General exclaimed,\r\n\"By any chance related to Colonel Robert Dodge, who served so gallantly\r\nwith me during the War?\" \"Yes, General, he was my father.\" \"Oh, indeed!\"\r\nsaid he, \"I am greatly pleased to know you, young man. You must come to\r\nMount Vernon some time to see me.\"\r\n\r\nWhether or not Francis Dodge got to Mount Vernon before the General's\r\ndeath the following year, I do not know, but for over forty years his\r\ngrandson, Colonel Harrison H. Dodge, was the honored superintendent\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nYoung Francis was taken into his brother's counting house, and a few\r\nyears later, in 1804, was sent to Portugal to investigate trade\r\nconditions in Europe. In 1807 he married Elizabeth Thomson, a daughter\r\nof William Thomson, of Scotland. They first resided below Bridge (M)\r\nStreet, west of High (Wisconsin Avenue), probably in Cherry Lane, where\r\nlived also, according to tradition, Philip Barton Key, the Maffits, and\r\nother families of distinction.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Dodge had the usual large family of those days, six sons\r\nand five daughters, and all grew to maturity. While they were still\r\nsmall children, however, the British came to Washington, causing great\r\nalarm to the citizens of George Town also. Mr. Dodge apparently sent his\r\nfamily out somewhere near Rockville, for this is a letter he wrote to\r\nhis wife at that time. It gives an interesting picture of those exciting\r\ndays:\r\n\r\n    Georgetown, Aug. 26, 1814, 12 o'clock A. M.\r\n\r\n    Dear Wife:\r\n\r\n    We have positive information that the British have left the City on\r\n    the Baltimore road, and passed the toll-gate last night. Some of\r\n    their pickets are still around the city.\r\n\r\n    We believe they are either going to their shipping on Patuxent or\r\n    direct to Baltimore; or that they received information of an\r\n    intention to attempt to cut them off. At all events I am satisfied\r\n    you would be perfectly safe here, and much more comfortable than\r\n    where you are. I wish yourself, the child, Emily, Frank, and\r\n    Isabella, to come home and bring, if you can, one bed. Peggy and\r\n    Betty can come if they please.\r\n\r\n    Not one Englishman has been in this town or within sight of Ft.\r\n    Warburton below. They have burnt all public property in the city. It\r\n    was a dreadful sight. The rope-walks in the city are destroyed. The\r\n    General Post Office and Jail stand. I hope they will not return here\r\n    again and can't think they will, they behaved well.\r\n\r\n    The town was very quiet last night and I got a good sleep for the\r\n    first time. I hope you are well.\r\n\r\n    Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n    F. DODGE.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 27, 7 o'clock A. M.\r\n\r\n    After preparing yesterday to send this, William came and advised to\r\n    postpone till today. You can all come now in the stage, bringing all\r\n    the books and what else you can.\r\n\r\n    We have no news today but expect the British are near their\r\n    shipping. We have escaped wonderfully.\r\n\r\nThe stage ran daily from George Town to Rockville. I think it was also\r\ncalled \"the hack,\" for, in old letters from my own ancestors at Hayes,\r\nout in that direction, they write of \"sending the seamstress out by the\r\nhack.\"\r\n\r\nAs the boys approached years of discretion, not having been spoiled by\r\nsparing the rod, their father gave to each an identical circular,\r\nsetting forth what should be their \"guide through life.\" His admonition\r\nto \"read the Bible daily and regularly,\" was based upon his own\r\nremarkable habit in that respect. That he managed to read five chapters\r\nconsecutively every morning and thus encompass the whole in seven\r\nmonths, is borne out by the periodic notations in his Holy Book. The\r\ncirculars read as follows:\r\n\r\n    My practice (and my advice to all) is: if you wish to appear decent\r\n    shave every morning below ears and nose, cut your hair short all\r\n    over the head, wear white cravats, no boot-straps or pantaloon\r\n    straps.\r\n\r\n    If you expect or desire to live in old age with few pains, and in\r\n    the meantime be clear headed and well, and thriving in your\r\n    business, rise before the sun, retire early, taking seven to nine\r\n    hours in bed. Eat regularly and moderately of plain food, plainly\r\n    cooked; no desserts except green fruit, drink no kind of liquor\r\n    except water and the like; use no tobacco in any way.\r\n\r\n    Read five chapters in the Bible regularly through, before breakfast,\r\n    support religious societies and go to church twice every Sabbath\r\n    Day. Take moderate exercise, attend to your business and keep it\r\n    always in order and under your Government, never over-trade, hold\r\n    your word as binding as your bond, be security for no one, seldom\r\n    any good comes of it, but often miserable distress.\r\n\r\n    Be as liberal as you can, consistently, to your kin, if in need and\r\n    worthy, perform all your duties to your family and neighbors.\r\n\r\n    The above I practice almost to the letter.\r\n\r\n    F. DODGE.\r\n\r\n    P. S.--Again, say little or nothing about yourself, your family, or\r\n    your business. Talk but little--listen.\r\n\r\n    Speak as well as you can of all, expose faults only when you believe\r\n    it well to do more good than harm, all have foibles and few are free\r\n    from faults, most, some good traits of character.\r\n\r\n    This post script I am endeavoring to practice.\r\n\r\n    F. DODGE, 1847.\r\n\r\n    Act well your part, there all the honor lies, Read, heed!\r\n\r\n    The above attended to with strict economy, industry and like, will\r\n    carry you through this life with honor and credit.\r\n\r\nThe education of the two oldest sons, Francis, junior, and Alexander\r\nHamilton, seems to have been planned to fit them specially for\r\ncommercial life, to succeed their father in his well-established\r\nbusiness. Francis was sent to Georgetown College and Alexander to\r\nPrinceton--he graduated in 1835. Robert Perley Dodge graduated from\r\nPrinceton in two years, standing fifth in a class of seventy-six. He\r\nthen entered a school of engineering in Kentucky. In six months he\r\ncompleted a major course. He rated so high that he was offered a\r\nprofessorship in mathematics, but declined, and became a civil engineer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SONS OF FRANCIS DODGE, 1878]\r\n\r\nWilliam and Allen Dodge received special practical training in\r\nagriculture and animal industry at the Maryland Agricultural College.\r\nMr. Dodge bought William a farm near Hagerstown, and for Allen one\r\nnear Bladensburg, but, due to the Civil War and the abolition of slaves,\r\nboth of these highly developed ventures failed, and the farms were sold.\r\nCharles, the youngest, attended Georgetown College, and took up\r\ncommercial and export business. In 1862 he was offered command of a\r\nConfederate regiment but declined, being a Unionist. He accepted,\r\ninstead, the rank of major and paymaster in the Federal Army and served\r\nthroughout the war. For a time he was interested in gold mining in\r\nMaryland, and in 1889 succeeded his brother Frank (then deceased) as\r\ncollector of customs of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth of June, 1849, a remarkable event took place in this old\r\nhouse--a wedding ceremony at four o'clock in the morning of four of the\r\nchildren of Mr. and Mrs. Dodge. Adeline was married to Charles Lanman;\r\nVirginia to Ben Perley Poore, a well-known correspondent of _Harper's\r\nWeekly_ in those days; Allen Dodge to Miss Mary Ellen Berry, and Charles\r\nDodge to Miss Eliza G. Davidson of Evermay. The weddings were celebrated\r\nat this unusual hour so that the bridal couples could take the regular\r\nstage leaving Georgetown for Baltimore at five o'clock. At least it was\r\na cool time of day for the celebration, and how beautiful it must have\r\nbeen with the dew lying on the box and the roses, and the birds\r\ntwittering their sunrise notes. What a jolly time these four couples\r\nmust have had, starting off together. Let us hope their spirits were not\r\ntoo much dampened by the fact that their father would not witness the\r\nceremony, as it was at variance with his religious scruples that it was\r\nnot conducted in a church. Reverend N. P. Tillinghast, then the rector\r\nof St. John's Church, must have officiated, as the Dodges were always\r\nardent supporters of St. John's.\r\n\r\nThe only two members of the family who did not marry were Miss Emily and\r\nMiss Elizabeth Dodge. They were the eldest of the girls, and I imagine\r\nthat practically no one could get up the nerve to ask the old gentleman\r\nfor their hands. Major Ben Perley Poore used to say that the most\r\nmomentous hour he could remember was the one spent in Mr. Dodge's office\r\nwaiting to see him to ask for the hand of Virginia, and he had faced\r\nguns when he said that.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Francis Dodge died at the age of sixty-nine. He was a very good\r\ncitizen; his judgment was sought on all matters of public interest\r\nconnected with the town, besides exercising a controlling influence over\r\ncommercial transactions. At that time tropical fruits such as oranges\r\nand bananas were luxuries, and it is remembered that Mr. Dodge used to\r\nsend baskets of them around to his friends whenever one of his vessels\r\nwould arrive from the West Indies.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a little girl, living across the street on the opposite\r\ncorner from this house, it was always spoken of as \"Miss Emily Dodge's.\"\r\nI can remember her well when she would come out on the gallery and walk\r\nup and down. She seemed never to go away from the house. She was rather\r\nsmall, had snow-white hair in long curls about her face, and was usually\r\nwrapped in a white shawl. I have been told that she was terribly afraid\r\nof fire and burglars, so slept fully dressed. Each morning she bathed\r\nand re-clothed herself. At night she lay down and slept as she was. At\r\nthe time I remember, Miss Emily occupied part of the big wing of the\r\nenormous house and Allen Dodge and his wife were living in the lower\r\nfloors of the wing. His wife was quite an invalid, and I do not\r\nrecollect ever seeing her.\r\n\r\nThe main part of the house was occupied for one winter by Dr. Stuart,\r\nthe rector of Christ Church, and his family while the new rectory at\r\nnumber 1515 31st Street was being built.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Miss Emily Dodge, the place was sold to close the\r\nestate, and pulled down, thereby deleting from Georgetown one of its\r\nmost distinctive and charming features which today would have been\r\ninvaluable. I remember weeping bitterly when I heard it was to be torn\r\ndown; even then, a half-grown girl, I loved old houses.\r\n\r\nThe two cottages on West (P) Street at numbers 3033 and 3035, were built\r\nby Mr. Dodge. In the latter, until her death, lived Mrs. Charles Lanman\r\n(Adeline Dodge). Mr. Lanman was a native of Newburyport, Massachusetts.\r\nHe was a very scholarly man, wrote _A Life of Daniel Webster_, who was\r\nhis friend, and other books, and for a long time was connected with the\r\nJapanese Legation.\r\n\r\nFor many years they had a young Japanese girl, Ume Tschuda, making her\r\nhome with them while she was being educated in this country. The Lanmans\r\nhad no children of their own, and looked upon her almost as an adopted\r\ndaughter. She has had a very remarkable career as head of an important\r\nschool in Japan.\r\n\r\nAnother house built by the Dodges on their farm is the one on 30th\r\nStreet, now doubled in size and occupied by Dr. Gwynn. Here Henry H.\r\nDodge lived until he moved into his mother's former home, the Chapman\r\nhouse, on Congress (31st) Street and Dumbarton Avenue.\r\n\r\nOn the southeast corner of Stoddert (Q) and Washington (30th) Streets,\r\nwhat is now Hammond Court, an apartment, was the house built by Francis\r\nDodge, junior. In the group picture shown, he and Alexander Hamilton\r\nDodge are the two seated in the middle of the front row. A. H. Dodge is\r\nthe only brother not adorned with a beard. Was there ever a more\r\nwonderful display of six stalwart handsome brothers? In fact, good looks\r\nare to this day inherent in the Dodge family.\r\n\r\nI have already told a good deal of the history of Francis Dodge, junior,\r\nof his marriage to the two daughters of Judge Chapman. He had a son and\r\na daughter by each wife.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, at the death of Francis Dodge, senior, his splendidly\r\nestablished West Indies business continued under the management of the\r\neldest sons, the name being changed to F. & A. H. Dodge. On the basis of\r\ntheir business alone, Georgetown was made a port of entry and a custom\r\nhouse was established here.\r\n\r\nEach year there was a sale for buyers from large cities in the North on\r\nthe Dodges' wharf. It was quite an occasion. The counting house was\r\ncapacious, and decorated with all sorts of curios from the tropics:\r\nsharks' jaws, flying fish, swordfish and sawfish; elaborate lunches were\r\nserved to the patrons, with cigars and drinkables; chairs and benches\r\nwere placed out on the platform overlooking the river. On summer\r\nafternoons, this was a great meeting place for the friends of the two\r\nDodges.\r\n\r\nMany bidders assembled on these advertised dates, hauling commodities\r\naway as purchased, some to the rail depot, some to storage, which kept\r\nthe firm officials and stewards busy. One of the faithful employees was\r\nRichard McCraith, a newly arrived Irishman from Cork. He had that noted\r\npropensity of his race for getting orders twisted, but his endeavors to\r\ndo right were so earnest and conscientious that his unintentional errors\r\nof judgment were condoned. One urgent order from a patron asked for\r\ndelivery to bearer of two sacks of coarse salt. For its hauling the\r\nbearer had a cart. \"Here, Richard, go with this man to the warehouse on\r\nHigh Street and see that his cart is backed up close to the door. The\r\nsalt is stored in the third floor. Load it carefully on the hand truck,\r\nwheel it to the window and let it down 'by the fall'--do you get that\r\nstraight?\" \"Yis sir, yis sir!\" Presently a man burst into the office,\r\nexclaiming excitedly, \"That wild Irishman of yours has raised hell up\r\nthe street. He dumped a sack of salt weighing 200 pounds from the third\r\nstory to the cart underneath, broke both wheels, and the horse has run\r\naway with the wreck.\" (Enter Richard!) Said the angry boss, \"Now, what\r\nthe devil have you done?\" Richard: \"Yis sir. Didn't you tell me to let\r\nit down 'by the fall'? I did, sir.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1867 Francis Dodge, junior, sold this fine house to Henry D. Cooke.\r\nIn 1877 he was appointed collector of customs. He was quite an old\r\ngentleman by that time, and the glories of Georgetown's maritime trade\r\nwere beginning to be a thing of the past. In fact, with the coming of\r\nthe railroads, the huge business of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal was\r\ninjured, and from then on the commercial importance of the town began to\r\ndwindle.\r\n\r\nHenry D. Cooke, who purchased this house, was the brother of Jay Cooke,\r\nand came to Washington to manage a branch of his brother's large banking\r\nenterprise. He was an intimate friend of General Grant, and I have read\r\nthat the general was so fond of his company that he would sit in his\r\ncarriage for an hour outside Mr. Cooke's place of business, waiting for\r\nhim to go driving.\r\n\r\nClaude Bowers, in his most interesting book _The Tragic Era_, speaks of\r\na brilliant ball given the night before the \"breaking of the bubble of\r\nthe Credit Mobilier\" in 1873, by Henry D. Cooke. It was in this house\r\nthat the ball took place. Can't you picture the coaches as they rolled\r\nup to the door, discharging the ladies in their crinolines, laces,\r\nsatins, and flowers, attended by the gentlemen wrapped in the long\r\ncloaks of that period? Kate Chase Sprague was in the height of her\r\nbeauty and power at that time and was, of course, among the guests on\r\nthat fateful night.\r\n\r\nMr. Cooke was the first governor of the District of Columbia when that\r\nnew form of municipal government was begun, to last through only three\r\nterms. There were twelve children in the Cooke family then living in\r\nthis house. They were ardent members of St. John's Church--the font\r\nthere being in memory of one little son. Mr. Cooke built Grace Church,\r\nthe little gray stone church down below the canal near High Street\r\n(Wisconsin Avenue). It was intended for the canal people of whom there\r\nwere many at that time.\r\n\r\nGovernor Cooke bought a great deal of property and built four sets of\r\ntwin houses along the north side of Stoddert (Q) Street, which were\r\ncalled, until a few years ago, Cooke Row. In Number One, near Washington\r\n(30th) Street, lived one family of his descendants, one of whom, a young\r\nman, played the piano very well. In Number Three, lived Mrs. Shepherd\r\nfrom Philadelphia, a widow, who had one son. He was the first person I\r\never knew to commit suicide. It was a terrible shock to the town when we\r\nheard one morning that he had shot himself the night before. It was not\r\nsuch a common event in the nineties as nowadays.\r\n\r\nIn one of these houses lived Commodore Nicholson, and in another lived\r\nAdmiral Radford, whose lovely daughter, Sophy, became the bride of\r\nValdemar de Meisner, secretary of the Russian Legation. In Number Four,\r\nlived Mrs. Zola Green with her daughter and her two sisters, named\r\nPyle--one of them was called Miss \"Chit-Chat.\" Mr. Green, who was a\r\ndescendant of Uriah Forrest, had been given the name of Oceola after the\r\nIndian Chief who had saved the life of his father years ago out West.\r\n\r\nAt Number Five Cooke Row, now 3021 Q Street, lived during the nineties,\r\nDr. Walter Reed, of the United States Army, whose name is honored by\r\nbeing given to the huge General Hospital in Washington because of his\r\nassociation with the discovery of the cause of yellow fever. I recall a\r\nmost delightful party at the Reeds on St. Valentine night in 1899, given\r\nfor friends of their son. When the invitations were sent out, we were\r\ntold the name of the young man or girl to whom our valentine was to be\r\nwritten. It was at the time of the tremendous blizzard of that year, and\r\nwe walked to the party between drifts of snow piled higher than our\r\nheads. But it was anything but cold when we got inside--open fires and\r\njollity! Dr. Reed read aloud the poems, one by one, and we had to guess\r\nthe authors and to whom they were addressed. In the library, ensconced\r\nin mysterious gloom, seated in a corner on the floor was a\r\nfortune-teller. It was a perfect party!\r\n\r\nNext door, at Number Six Cooke Row, for a great many years, lived\r\nWilliam A. Gordon, junior, and his family. Mr. Gordon wrote some very\r\nvaluable brochures of historical interest about Georgetown and his\r\nmemories of it from his childhood. This house is now the home of Mrs.\r\nHenry Latrobe Roosevelt. During World War II, this was the home of Sir\r\nJohn and Lady Dill, when he was here representing Great Britain on the\r\nJoint Chiefs of Staff.\r\n\r\nAt Number Seven lived the Misses Trapier--four old maids again!\r\n\r\nJ. Holdsworth Gordon, brother of William A. Gordon, built a house across\r\nthe street. For him the Gordon Junior High School has been named, he\r\nhaving been for a long time on the board of education.\r\n\r\nNext door to him on the east, at number 3020, is an attractive old\r\nhouse, and in the nineties it was filled with a family of four charming\r\ndaughters. They were related to the Carters of Virginia, and so had\r\ngiven two of the most imposing names of that great family to two small\r\nfox-terriers that they adored, \"King Carter,\" and \"Shirley Carter.\" The\r\nlatter had met with an accident and had to have one of his hind legs\r\namputated, but he got about very nimbly on his other three. They always\r\naccompanied Colonel B. Lewis Blackford, the head of the house, on his\r\ntrips about town. One day as he was nearing home, an old lady who walked\r\nwith a cane was just about to pass him when \"Shirley Carter\" hopped\r\nimmediately across his path; \"Get out of my way, you damn tripod!\" he\r\nsaid, in his exasperation, just escaping being tripped up. The old lady,\r\nthinking the \"tripod\" referred to her adjunct of a cane, was quite\r\ninfuriated, even to summoning across the street a gentleman who was\r\npassing, and to wishing him to \"call the Colonel out!\"\r\n\r\nA little further eastward along Stoddert (Q) Street, on the northeast\r\ncorner is the house Mr. Joseph Nourse built in 1868, and where his\r\ndaughter, Miss Emily Nourse, lived all her life. After her death, it was\r\nsold and somebody put two old lamp-posts at the foot of the entrance\r\nsteps with gas flickering in them continuously--and now there is a story\r\naround that they were \"always\" there, and some foolishness about the\r\nlights \"never had gone out\" or \"must never go out.\"\r\n\r\nAcross the street, where the Stoddert Apartment now is, used to be an\r\nold house, in appearance quite like the one of Judge Chapman's on\r\nDumbarton Avenue and Congress (31st) Street, except for the long, side\r\nporches. Here lived in the seventies and eighties General Henry Hayes\r\nLockwood and his family. His son, James Lockwood, accompanied General\r\nGreeley on his trip to the North Pole, and was lost there in the Arctic,\r\nholding the record at that time of having reached farthest North.\r\n\r\nA block south, on the northeast corner of Greene (29th) and West (P)\r\nStreets, is where Alexander Hamilton Dodge lived, who was a partner with\r\nhis brother, Francis, in the shipping business. He was the father of\r\nColonel Harrison H. Dodge.\r\n\r\nIn the days when his children were young, he had a big Newfoundland dog\r\nwhich he had raised from a puppy. One rarely sees one now, as tall and\r\nas big as a half-grown calf, with a coat of wonderful black, curly hair.\r\nSuch pets used to be quite popular, but only once in forty years have I\r\nrun across another. The Dodge's dog was named Argus. So strong and\r\ndocile was he that two children could ride him at the same time. He\r\nloved the children, took them to school, and gave them \"lifts\" over wet\r\nor muddy ground. Do you remember \"Nana,\" in _Peter Pan_? She was a\r\nNewfoundland dog--just so she nursed her master's children. Returning\r\nfrom escort duty in the morning, a locked container was fastened to his\r\ncollar and he would be given the word \"office,\" which was enough. Off\r\nhe'd go, proudly bearing luncheon to his master, who, in return, would\r\nsend back to the family the daily mail (no postmen to deliver in those\r\ndays), perfectly confident of its reaching its destination safely, as\r\neverybody knew the big dog, and also that he would resent any attempt to\r\nstop him or take things from him.\r\n\r\nOne day the cook complained to Mr. Dodge that somebody had evidently\r\nbeen robbing the hen's nests, as she was getting fewer eggs than usual.\r\nMr. Dodge, going to investigate, met Argus coming down the path from the\r\nbarn wagging his tail majestically, as was his wont when approaching his\r\nmaster. Mr. Dodge stopped and held out his hand, saying, \"Argus, give me\r\nthat egg,\" whereupon the obedient dog opened his mouth and out rolled an\r\negg, to the great surprise of Mr. Dodge. Did he punish Argus for that?\r\nNot at all, but he told him he was sorry he was a robber and hoped he'd\r\nnever have cause to scold him again. And he never did!\r\n\r\nThe interesting-looking house to the east of Hamilton Dodge's, 2811 P\r\nStreet, was built in 1840. That is where the Gordon family were living\r\nwhen William A. Gordon, junior, came back from the Civil War. Certainly,\r\nthat must have been a joyous occasion, and there were happy hearts\r\nwithin the old walls that night. His sister Josephine (Mrs. Sowers),\r\nMargaret Robinson (Mrs. Thomas Cox), and Elizabeth Dodge (Mrs. John\r\nBeall), all exceedingly handsome women, were belles in their youth,\r\nand a trio of great friends to the end of their lives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM A. GORDON]\r\n\r\nThe family of Admiral Sigsbee were living here when the U. S. battleship\r\n_Maine_, of which he was the captain, was blown up in the harbor of\r\nHavana in 1898. His wife was a daughter of Admiral Lockwood. It is now\r\nthe home of Mr. and Mrs. John Ihlder.\r\n\r\nAt 2805 P Street lives Honorable Dean G. Acheson, now Secretary of\r\nState. For a while, in the latter part of the last century, a quaint and\r\nvery well-known lady made this house her home--Miss Emily V. Mason, of\r\nVirginia, from whom Mr. Corcoran received friendly and grateful letters,\r\nthanking him for contributions to her work for \"her children,\" as she\r\ncalled them. The letters were written from Europe. She evidently had\r\ngroups of Southern children in various cities for whom she provided,\r\nusing for that purpose money made by her writings, to which she refers.\r\nI remember how picturesque she was in appearance: a lovely face,\r\nsurrounded by long, white curls, crowned by a wide-brimmed, black bonnet\r\ntied with a wide ribbon. She seemed to have quite a salon during her\r\nresidence here, serving tea and substantial refreshments to all her\r\nfriends who called in the afternoons.\r\n\r\nThe iron fence around these houses is made of old musket barrels, used\r\nduring the Mexican War, and was put there by Reuben Daw, who owned a\r\nlarge part of this block.\r\n\r\nJust across the street from Mr. Acheson used to live a lady, the widow\r\nof Mr. Hein, the artist, who like \"Anna\" in the Bible spent all her days\r\nin the \"courts of the Lord,\" the Catholic Church. She always wore a long\r\nblack coat and a crepe veil to her heels, rode a bicycle back and forth\r\nto church, the long veil floating out behind. One evening she was struck\r\nby an automobile and killed instantly. The niece to whom she had left\r\nher little house had made an arrangement with a middle-aged woman living\r\nthere that if she took care of \"Aunt Martha\" she could have the house\r\ntax free all her days. Her days are still continuing--and with all the\r\nadvance in prices of houses, the niece can't do a thing about the house!\r\n\r\nThe dear little white frame cottage just above here on Montgomery (28th)\r\nStreet, was built about 1840, and occupied by Benjamin F. Miller, who\r\ncame from Saugerties, New York, as an engineer, to construct the\r\nAqueduct Bridge which carried the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal across the\r\nriver to Virginia. And, on the corner of Montgomery (28th) and Stoddert\r\n(Q) Streets is the last of the big Dodge houses on the corners of\r\nGeorgetown. It is the one built by Robert Perley Dodge in 1850. He and\r\nhis brother, Francis Dodge, junior, used practically the same plans for\r\ntheir houses. Robert Dodge was a civil engineer, and, I think, had\r\nsomething to do with the planning of the Aqueduct Bridge.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War, Robert Dodge became a paymaster in the\r\nUnion Army. After the war, he became identified with the government of\r\nthe District of Columbia, serving as treasurer and auditor for several\r\nyears until he died. It is said he planted the enormous maple trees that\r\nadorn this block of 28th Street.\r\n\r\nDuring the first World War, when this house had stood a long time\r\nuntenanted and sad, it was opened up as a night club called \"The\r\nCarcassonne,\" and postals were sent out advertising \"Coffee in the Coal\r\nBin.\" These were the days of prohibition. Somebody who lived there\r\nplayed the piano, incessantly. The Ballengers had lived here; the\r\nPowells, and Major Gilliss; and then Mrs. Ruth Hanna McCormick (now Mrs.\r\nAlbert Simms), lived here until she bought three houses down on 30th\r\nStreet below N Street, and made them into one very attractive house with\r\nan unusual and lovely garden.\r\n\r\nLater Honorable Warren Delano Robbins, a first cousin of Franklin D.\r\nRoosevelt and one of the ushers at his wedding, and at one time Minister\r\nto Canada, bought this house, changed it somewhat and made it very\r\nlovely in its new dress of yellow paint on the old plaster.\r\n\r\nWhen he went to Ottawa he leased it to Honorable Dwight F. Davis, former\r\nSecretary of War, once Governor-General of the Philippine Islands, and\r\nalso donor of the Davis Tennis Cup.\r\n\r\nIt has now for several years been the home of Mrs. William Corcoran\r\nEustis. She is the daughter of one-time Vice-President Paul Morton.\r\n\r\nJust across the street from here is the house that Honorable and Mrs.\r\nRobert Woods Bliss bought when they gave their fine estate, \"Dumbarton\r\nOaks,\" to Harvard University. This house was built by Mr. Thomas Hyde\r\nand was where he and Mrs. Hyde lived till the end of their days. She was\r\nFannie Rittenhouse and had grown up in the old house close by, known for\r\na hundred years as \"Bellevue,\" but renamed \"Dumbarton House,\" when the\r\nNational Society of Colonial Dames of America bought it for their\r\nHeadquarters in 1928. It is one of the finest, most beautiful, and most\r\ninteresting of the old places of Georgetown. It has always been somewhat\r\nshrouded in mystery, as to its builder and owner. We do know, of\r\ncourse, that this was part of the grant of the Rock of Dumbarton to\r\nNinian Beall and, through his son, George, descended to Thomas, who, in\r\n1783 made his first Addition to George Town. Thomas may have built a\r\nsmall house here, but this was not the house where his father, George,\r\nwas living when his wife died and was \"buried nearby\"--that was on Gay\r\n(N) Street at the house now 3033 N Street.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 Thomas Beall of George sold this property to Peter Casanave,\r\nwho, two months later, sold it to Uriah Forrest. He kept it for a\r\nyear--never lived there--and sold it to Isaac Pollock. There was wild\r\nspeculation in real estate at that time on account of the new Federal\r\nCity being located here. After one year Pollock sold the property to\r\nSamuel Jackson.\r\n\r\nIt seems that it was then that Samuel Jackson started to build this\r\nmansion, but got into financial difficulties and it was mortgaged to two\r\nor three people and finally foreclosed. In 1804 the place was bought by\r\nGabriel Duval, then Comptroller of the Currency of the United States,\r\nafterwards a Justice of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 Joseph Nourse, Registrar of the United States Treasury, who had\r\nbeen until that time living on Congress (31st) Street in George Town,\r\nbought it and lived there until 1813. He had this position from 1789 to\r\n1829 and was in charge of moving all the records of the Treasury\r\nDepartment when the Government moved from Philadelphia to the new\r\ncapital in Washington.\r\n\r\nMr. Nourse had been born in London in 1754; came to Virginia and fought\r\nin the Revolution. He was secretary to General Charles Lee and Auditor\r\nof the Board of War. His wife was Maria Louisa Bull of Philadelphia,\r\nand they had two children, Charles Joseph Nourse, who became a Major in\r\nthe Army, and Anna Maria Josepha, who was a lovely girl and took part in\r\nthe prominent social affairs of the new city. She is spoken of in the\r\ndiary of Sir Augustus Foster, British Minister of that period.\r\n\r\nWhen the National Society of Colonial Dames had this house restored, a\r\npenny bearing the date 1800 was found in one of the front walls where\r\nsuch an identification was often placed, and architects think that\r\nSamuel Jackson began to build this house, using perhaps the little house\r\nthat was on the property as a wing, and that then Joseph Nourse took it\r\nover and was really the builder of this fine mansion. It was probably\r\nintended for entertaining for his beloved daughter, for, after her\r\ndeath, which occurred at one of the Virginia springs one summer, he sold\r\nthe place and moved out to a small frame house on a high hill\r\noverlooking the Federal City. He called his new home \"Mount Alban,\"\r\nbecause it reminded him of the place of the same name in England. It was\r\nthere that the first British martyr, Saint Alban, was killed. Mr. Nourse\r\nwas a very religious man and used to walk about in the grove of oak\r\ntrees surrounding his house and pray that some day a House of God might\r\nstand upon that spot; that is exactly where the Washington Cathedral is\r\nnow being erected.\r\n\r\nMr. Nourse had many famous guests visit him in his modest home\r\nthere--among them: Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, and\r\nJohn Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\nMr. Nourse's son, Major Charles Joseph Nourse, married Rebecca Morris\r\nwhose father, Anthony Morris, of Philadelphia, was an intimate and\r\nlife-long friend of Dolly Madison. Major Nourse built the old stone\r\nhouse out on the road to Rockville and called it \"The Highlands.\"\r\nTradition says that a large box bush at \"The Highlands\" has grown from a\r\ntiny sprig of box which Mrs. Madison plucked from her bouquet at the\r\ninauguration of her husband and gave to Mr. Morris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUMBARTON HOUSE]\r\n\r\n\"The Highlands\" was a large household, for Major and Mrs. Nourse had\r\neleven children, and Mr. Morris resided there also. They have been a\r\nvery remarkable family, noted for their longevity, their steadfast,\r\nnoble character, and their loyalty to the Episcopal Church. It was from\r\nthe prayers and savings of Phoebe Nourse, who died as a young girl, that\r\nSt. Alban's Church has risen on that ground which she wished to dedicate\r\nto the glory of God.\r\n\r\n\"The Highlands\" many years later became the home of Admiral and Mrs.\r\nGary T. Grayson.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the old house which blocked Stoddert (Q) Street or Back\r\nStreet, as it was sometimes called. Mr. Nourse sold this house, his\r\nGeorgetown home, in 1813 to Charles Carroll, who gave it the name of\r\nBellevue, and thereafter always styled himself \"of Bellevue.\" He was a\r\nnephew of Daniel Carroll, of Duddington. He also was a great friend of\r\nMrs. Madison's, and helped her in her dramatic escape from the White\r\nHouse when the British were on their way to burn and plunder it. There\r\nhas always been a story that Daniel Carroll brought her over the road to\r\nGeorgetown, crossing at the P Street bridge, and that she stopped by\r\nBellevue. There she is supposed to have met Mr. Madison whom she had not\r\nseen since early morning. This was the day of the Battle of Bladensburg\r\nwhen confusion reigned supreme. At the meeting Mr. and Mrs. Madison\r\nagreed on the routes and rendezvous of retreat.\r\n\r\nFrom old letters it seems that she continued on out of town to \"Weston,\"\r\nthe estate of Walter S. Chandler, which was situated near the present\r\njunction of Massachusetts and Wisconsin Avenues. I can dimly remember\r\nthe quaint white, frame house and the legend of Dolly Madison being\r\nthere. She then went on to the encampment at Tenally Town, where she\r\nslept in a tent that night under guard, and the next day crossed into\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nMr. Carroll and his brother had not long before become owners of the\r\npaper mill on Rock Creek just south of Bellevue, so that must have been\r\nhis reason for making it his home.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 he leased the place to Samuel Whitall, of Philadelphia, whose\r\nwife was Lydia Newbold. Mr. Whitall was a distinguished-looking old\r\ngentleman, and used to drive around in a high, two-wheeled gig, the last\r\nof its kind in the town.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles Carroll died in 1841, the place was bought by the son of\r\nMr. and Mrs. Whitall. A daughter, Sarah Whitall, was born at Bellevue in\r\n1822 and lived there for over seventy years. She married Mr. Rittenhouse\r\nof Philadelphia. The place remained in the Rittenhouse family until\r\n1896, when they sold it to Howard Hinckley. In the intervening years,\r\nits appearance had been greatly changed by a coat of plaster over the\r\nold bricks, which Mr. Hinckley removed. It was very lovely, both inside\r\nand out, during the years that Mr. and Mrs. Hinckley made it their home.\r\nSome very delightful parties were given there. Then candlelight was the\r\nonly illumination, and even the flowers used were redolent of colonial\r\ndays. The rooms were filled with furniture of the right type; and I\r\nremember that the bedrooms even had the old washstands with holes in the\r\ntops for bowls and pitchers which also were exactly \"right\" in their\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAfter that, Colonel Langfitt leased the house, and a very lovely wedding\r\ntook place out of doors under an enormous tree, when his daughter\r\nmarried an officer of the United States Army.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 it was bought by John L. Newbold, a relative of the Lydia\r\nNewbold of long ago. After a great deal of agitation on the subject of\r\ncutting Q Street through, and putting a bridge across Rock Creek to\r\nconnect with the city, the District government in 1915 moved the old\r\nhouse to its present location, for it had been sitting exactly in the\r\npath of progress all these years, there being a George Town Ordinance\r\nthat a street could not be cut through without consent of the owner. I\r\nonly wish progress could have made a circle around the old mansion and\r\nleft it in its setting of stately, primeval trees.\r\n\r\nMiss Loulie Rittenhouse, who had been born and reared there, worked\r\nuntiringly for the opening of the street, the bridge, and also for\r\nMontrose Park, with the salvation of the glorious old oak trees it\r\ncontains.\r\n\r\nSlowly, very, very slowly, old Bellevue was placed on huge rollers,\r\nhorses were attached to a windlass, and it almost took a microscope to\r\nsee the progress made day by day, but at last it reached its present\r\nsite, safe and sound. It was necessary to pull down and rebuild the\r\nwings, as they had no cellars. Of course, the wall is also new.\r\n\r\nIt was leased during World War I to various people of importance in\r\nWashington for war work, and finally, in 1928, bought by the National\r\nSociety of Colonial Dames of America. It has been handsomely and\r\nsuitably furnished as a house of the Federal period, and is open to the\r\npublic as a museum house. A beautiful house it is; the usual wide hall\r\nthrough the middle, with vistas through the two big doors, four rooms\r\nopening off it, the two back ones being rounded out at the northern\r\nends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TUDOR PLACE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\n_Tudor Place and Congress (31st) Street_\r\n\r\n\r\nLike the brightest jewel in its crown of old houses, Tudor Place, now\r\nthe home of Armistead Peter, junior, sits high and aloof on the heights\r\nof Georgetown. Its southern front, shown here, is the one most familiar\r\nto everyone, and it is the view that I looked out on every day of my\r\nlife for more than a score of years from my father's house on Stoddert\r\n(Q) Street.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Beverley Kennon, its owner during my youth, was my cousin and\r\nhad her motherless grandchildren living with her, some of my earliest\r\nrecollections are of running round and round the old circle of box in\r\nfront of the north entrance, playing \"colors.\" I never, to this day,\r\nsmell box that I am not back at Tudor Place and see the cobwebs in the\r\nold bushes bright with raindrops, as box, of course, is really fragrant\r\nonly after rain. Also there were lovely times in the fall when the\r\nleaves were being raked up by old John, the colored gardener, who would\r\nlet us climb on top of the brilliant load in a wheelbarrow with a crate\r\non top of it. Such rides! Old John was a character (and one we loved\r\ndearly), not much over five feet tall, with grizzled hair and goatee,\r\nand always wearing an apron tied around his waist and a derby hat on his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nTudor Place was purchased by Francis Lowndes, one of the prominent\r\ntobacco merchants and shippers, in 1794, from Thomas Beall of George\r\nwho made a large addition to George Town in 1783, called by his name.\r\nMr. Lowndes started to build a mansion, but in 1805 he sold the property\r\nto Thomas Peter and his wife, the former Martha Parke Custis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS PETER]\r\n\r\nWhen the Peters moved to their new home in George Town they used the\r\nwestern wing, already built, with its addition on the east, as their\r\nhome, and the eastern wing was their carriage house and stable. This\r\nfact has been proved by finding below the floors the signs of the old\r\nstalls, and up in the rafters the corncobs of long ago. I have known\r\npeople who remembered the old yellow coach which often stood out in the\r\nstable yard, and I've been told that if one dug deep enough its\r\ncobblestones would still be found.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Peter decided to use the fortune left her by her\r\ngrandmother, Mrs. Washington, to build a stately mansion. They certainly\r\nsucceeded. They engaged as architect Dr. William Thornton, whose plans\r\nfor the Capitol had been accepted in the second competition, as the\r\nfirst yielded none sufficiently good.\r\n\r\nDr. Thornton and his wife were intimate friends of the Peters, and a\r\nbeautiful miniature of him, done by her, is now in the possession of one\r\nof the family. Mrs. Thornton was with Mrs. Peter when the British\r\nsoldiers set fire to the Capitol in 1814, and the two ladies sat at the\r\nwindow of what is now the dining room of Tudor Place--the low part\r\nbetween the main building and the western wing--and watched the\r\nconflagration. You can imagine their grief as one saw the work of her\r\nhusband destroyed, and the other, the building which had been so much in\r\nthe mind and heart of her revered grandfather.\r\n\r\nThere is in existence a very lovely painting of Mrs. Peter at about the\r\ntime of her marriage; a sweet, young girl with light curls, and the\r\nembodiment of daintiness. Suspended about her neck is, I think, the\r\nminiature which General Washington had painted for her as a wedding\r\ngift. When he asked her what she wanted she replied \"a replica of\r\nhimself.\" He was much pleased that a young girl would want a portrait of\r\nan old man! The photograph reproduced of Thomas Peter is from a portrait\r\ndone by him by his son-in-law, Captain William G. Williams.\r\n\r\nWhile on a visit to Tudor Place occurred the death of Mrs. Peter's\r\nmother, the former Eleanor Calvert. She was fifty-three years old, and\r\nhad borne twenty children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. THOMAS PETER (MARTHA PARKE CUSTIS)]\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Peter had a family of eight children. Three of the\r\ndaughters had striking names: America, Columbia, and Britannia.\r\n\r\nWhen General Lafayette paid his visit to Georgetown in 1824 it was, of\r\ncourse, most natural that he should be entertained at Tudor Place, as\r\nMrs. Peter had known him in her childhood at Mount Vernon. At that time\r\nAmerica met her husband, Captain Williams, who was acting as an aide for\r\nthe Marquis. In later years, as chief of engineers on the staff of\r\nGeneral Zachary Taylor, Captain Williams was killed at the Battle of\r\nMonterey. On that same visit Lafayette presented the youngest child,\r\nBritannia, a little girl of nine, with a lovely little desk, now in the\r\nNational Museum in the loan collection of her grandson, Walter G. Peter.\r\nOn its under side it has an inscription in the handwriting of Martha\r\nCustis Peter, telling her daughter its history.\r\n\r\nBritannia Wellington Peter was born on January 27, 1815. She died the\r\nday before her ninety-sixth birthday, and this editorial, from _The\r\nBaltimore Sun_, gives a fine picture of the changes in the world in the\r\nyears covered by the span of her life:\r\n\r\n    A LONG AND INTERESTING LIFE\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Britannia Wellington Kennon, who died at Tudor Place, her\r\n    historic home in Georgetown, on the 26th instant, and who will be\r\n    buried today, was for many years a most interesting figure in the\r\n    social life of Washington. She was the last in her generation of the\r\n    descendants of Mrs. Martha Washington. John Parke Custis, Mrs.\r\n    Washington's son, left four children. One of his daughters, Martha,\r\n    married Thomas Peter, and Mrs. Kennon was their daughter. She\r\n    married Commodore Beverley Kennon, of the United States Navy, whose\r\n    father was General Richard Kennon, of Washington's staff, a charter\r\n    member of the Society of the Cincinnati, and a grandson of Sir\r\n    William Skipwith. Commodore Kennon was killed in 1844 by the\r\n    explosion on the U. S. S. _Princeton_, so Mrs. Kennon was a widow\r\n    for more than sixty-six years.\r\n\r\n    Tudor Place, Mrs. Kennon's home, was famous for the distinguished\r\n    guests that were entertained there, among them being General\r\n    Lafayette, who visited there in 1824. She was the center of an\r\n    intellectual and cultivated society, and was always in touch with\r\n    the progress of events in the world.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Kennon was born three weeks after the Battle of New Orleans,\r\n    and several months before the Battle of Waterloo. Her life spanned\r\n    the period of the great advance in the appliances of civilization in\r\n    this and the last century. It was very important that the news of\r\n    the battle of Waterloo should reach London without delay, and yet\r\n    with every appliance and speed then known, it took three days for\r\n    the news to reach England. Indeed, when Mrs. Kennon was thirty-two\r\n    years of age, it required eight months to travel from New England to\r\n    Oregon. At the age of fifteen she could have been a passenger on the\r\n    first passenger railroad train that was ever run; until she was five\r\n    years old, there was no such thing as an iron plow in all the world,\r\n    and until she was grown up, the people were dependent on tinder\r\n    boxes and sun glasses to light their fires. She had reached the age\r\n    of twenty-three years when steam communication between Europe and\r\n    America was established, and when the first telegram ever sent\r\n    passed between Baltimore and Washington she was still a young woman.\r\n    If all the advances in civilization which took place during the\r\n    lifetime of this remarkable lady were catalogued, they would make a\r\n    singularly interesting list.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kennon was left a widow when less than thirty years of age, with\r\nher one child, Martha Custis Kennon. To Mrs. Kennon and her daughter\r\nMrs. Thomas Peter bequeathed Tudor Place, having long survived her\r\nhusband, and her other children having received their inheritance.\r\nMartha Custis Kennon married her cousin, Dr. Armistead Peter, the son of\r\nMajor George Peter, and so the original surname came back to the place,\r\nwhich has never been out of the one family.\r\n\r\nUntil the death of Mrs. Kennon when they were, of course, divided, there\r\nwas at Tudor Place a very large and valuable collection of Washington\r\nrelics, fascinating things, among them Mrs. Washington's seed-pearl\r\nwedding jewelry and dress, a set of china made for and presented to\r\nGeneral Washington by the French government, the bowl given him by the\r\nOrder of the Cincinnati, and numberless other interesting things. In a\r\ncorner of the central room, the saloon, as it is called, was the small\r\ncamp trunk always used by the General. The room on the east, off of\r\nwhich opens the conservatory, is the drawing room; that to the west, the\r\nparlor. The saloon opens out onto the temple, the round porch on the\r\nsouth. The two large rooms at each side have lovely cornices, beautiful\r\nmarble mantels and handsome crystal chandeliers; long group windows to\r\nthe floor and very unusual doors of curly maple. At the debut tea of\r\nMrs. Kennon's granddaughter, I was helping to serve, when, seeing two\r\ndear old ladies, one very short, the other very tall, both dressed in\r\nsimple black with big bonnets and long veils, looking about in the crowd\r\nas if they were trying to see something particular, I went up and asked\r\nthem if I could bring them some refreshments. They said, \"No, thank you,\r\nwe really don't want anything, we are just trying to see if there are\r\nthe same ornaments on the table as when Britannia was married.\" I found\r\nout afterward that the ornaments were three beautiful alabaster groups\r\nof classic figures. The two old ladies were Miss Mary and Miss Rosa\r\nNourse, of The Highlands.\r\n\r\nBritannia Peter was a first cousin of Mary Custis, of Arlington, and was\r\none of the bridesmaids at the wedding there which united the daughter of\r\nGeorge Washington Parke Custis to the handsome United States army\r\nofficer, Robert Edward Lee. The friendship was an enduring one, and\r\nGeneral Lee visited Tudor Place when he paid his last visit to\r\nWashington City in 1869.\r\n\r\nBritannia Peter was bridesmaid for another first cousin, Helen Dunlop,\r\nwhen she was married at Hayes to William Laird.\r\n\r\nFrom the descendant of another one of those bridesmaids at that famous\r\nwedding at Arlington who, as a young girl, paid long visits to Mary\r\nCustis, I heard this delicious story: \"There being no telephones, when\r\nthe girls at Arlington and at Tudor Place wanted to get together they\r\nhad a series of signals. Hanging a red flannel petticoat out of the\r\nwindow meant 'come on over'. A white one had another meaning. This\r\nmethod was not popular with the owners of the two mansions, but\r\npersisted, nevertheless.\" To prove this, not long ago I went to\r\nArlington with the person who told me the story. The room there used by\r\nthe girls of those days does look toward Georgetown. There is a forest\r\nof tall trees there now but trees can grow very tall in a hundred years.\r\n\r\nWhen my father built his house at the foot of Mrs. Kennon's place, she\r\ntold him she was so glad to have him near by, but chided him for cutting\r\noff her view of the river.\r\n\r\nUntil only a few years before her death, Mrs. Kennon sat perfectly erect\r\nin her chair, never touching the back, and I can remember her as quite\r\nan old lady, almost flying up the hill of Congress (31st) Street,\r\nalways, of course, in bonnet and long, crepe veil. She was a member of\r\nChrist Church, and once many, many years ago when a parish meeting was\r\nannounced to decide some important question, the rector and gentlemen\r\nwere very much surprised on entering the vestry to find Mrs. Kennon\r\nthere waiting for the meeting. She said she wished to have a say in the\r\nmatter, and having no man to represent her, had come herself. So she was\r\nthe original suffragette! Mrs. Kennon was one of the early presidents\r\nof the Louise Home, and was the first president of the National Society\r\nof Colonial Dames of America in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nBefore the day of country clubs there used to be a very fine tennis\r\ncourt at Tudor Place, on the flat part to the north of the house not far\r\nfrom Congress (31st) Street, and it was much used. The Peter boys were\r\nchampions of the District several times. In the first administration of\r\nPresident Cleveland, Mrs. Cleveland, a bride, used to drive her husband\r\nin from Oak View or, as it was popularly called, Red Top, to his office\r\nat the White House nearly every morning in a low, one-horse phaeton. No\r\nsecret-service entourage in those days! In the evenings she came again\r\nin style in a Victoria, and frequently they would stop opposite Tudor\r\nPlace and watch the game in progress. There was a good deal of intimacy\r\nbetween Tudor Place and \"Red Top\" in those days.\r\n\r\nThe only football I ever heard of being played at Tudor Place was by a\r\nteam of which my youngest brother was a member. They had nowhere to\r\nplay, so he walked up there one day, and being a very engaging young man\r\nof about ten years, with big, blue eyes and a charming smile, he asked\r\nthe old lady for permission, which she gave. She used to sit by the long\r\nwindow in the parlor and watch them with great interest and pleasure.\r\nSome other boys thought they would like the same privilege and asked for\r\nit, but she told me she always asked, \"Are you a friend of my little\r\ncousin?\" Only his friends could play there.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kennon lived all her long and active life at Tudor Place, with the\r\nexception of two brief periods. The first was the year and a half when\r\nshe was living at the Washington Navy Yard with her husband while he was\r\nstationed there. And the second was when her daughter was at boarding\r\nschool in Philadelphia, just before the Civil War, and she leased the\r\nplace to Mr. Pendleton, a Representative in Congress from Virginia. Of\r\ncourse, after the secession of that State, Mr. Pendleton left Washington\r\nCity--but very hurriedly. Mrs. Kennon heard that her home was to be\r\ntaken over by the United States government to be used as a hospital so\r\nshe hastened back and occupied it herself. She took as boarders several\r\nFederal officers on the one condition that the affairs of the war should\r\nnot be discussed.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw her was not many months before her death, sitting in\r\na chair in her bedroom and very, very feeble. When I told her good-bye,\r\nshe kept saying something to me over and over, which I couldn't\r\nunderstand. Finally I leaned down very close, and heard, \"Be a good\r\ngirl.\" I was then the mother of two children, but to her, just a little\r\ngirl and the daughter of my father and mother, of whom she was very\r\nfond.\r\n\r\nOpposite Tudor Place, where now is a twin apartment house, was until the\r\nnineteen-twenties a simple old brick house somewhat like the old Mackall\r\nhouse on Greene (29th) Street, only minus a portico. When I knew it it\r\nwas the home of the Philip Darneilles--and I remember hearing my mother\r\nsay, \"But Mrs. Darneille was a Harry!\" Which meant nothing to me until I\r\nlooked up the title to this place, and there I found that all this land\r\nwent right back to Harriot Beall, Mrs. Elisha O. Williams, one of the\r\nthree daughters of Brooke Beall, who was among those wealthy shipping\r\nmerchants who were responsible for Georgetown's early prosperity.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harriot Beall Williams left this property, all the way down to\r\nBack (Q) Street, to her daughter Harriot Eliza Harry. Through her it\r\npassed to Harriot Beall Chesley, and then to her daughter, Emily\r\nMcIlvain Darneille. The old house stood untenanted for several years\r\nuntil bought for the erection of the apartments.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Darneille had three daughters, the eldest really a beauty\r\n(the youngest inherited the old name of Harriot), and they had a great\r\ndeal of gaiety there in the nineties. I remember especially the New\r\nYear's Day receptions they used to have, the many \"hacks\" overflowing\r\nwith young men, that used to climb the hill. It was the custom in those\r\ndays for the ladies of each household to receive on the afternoon of\r\nthat day. Only gentleman callers came, all dressed in their very best,\r\nand left their cards for all the ladies of their acquaintance. If you\r\nweren't receiving (attired in your best, sometimes to the extent of real\r\nlow-necked evening dresses, the dining room table loaded with salads,\r\nold hams, biscuits, ices, candies, tea and coffee--and always a punch\r\nbowl on the side) you hung a basket on your front door bell, and the\r\ncallers just deposited their cards and went on to the next place.\r\n\r\nWhat fun the children had, watching the front doors and counting the\r\ncards; and there was a real thrill when the caller happened to be an\r\nArmy or Navy officer, attired in full-dress uniform with gold braid and\r\nfeathers, having earlier in the day paid his respects at the White\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nOn part of the Darneille property stands an intriguing frame house. It\r\nis quite an old house and stood originally several hundred feet to the\r\neastward in Mackall Square, the property owned by Christiana Beall\r\nMackall, who was the sister of Harriot Beall Williams. So you see one\r\nsister sold it to the other and it took a trip across Washington (30th)\r\nStreet to reside on Congress (31st) Street. I wonder how they moved it\r\nin those days, for it was a long, long time ago.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Charles Dodge lived there after they left Evermay.\r\n\r\nIn the 1880's this house, 1633 31st Street, was the home of a very\r\ninteresting and eminent person, John Wesley Powell, American geologist\r\nand ethnologist. I now quote from the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_: \"He was\r\nborn at Mount Morris, N. Y., March 24, 1834. His parents were of English\r\nbirth, but had moved to America in 1830, and he was educated at Illinois\r\nand Oberlin colleges. He began his geological work with a series of\r\nfield trips including a trip throughout the length of the Mississippi in\r\na rowboat, the length of the Ohio, and of the Illinois. When the Civil\r\nWar broke out he entered the Union Army as a private, and at the battle\r\nof Shiloh he lost his right arm but continued in active service,\r\nreaching the rank of major of volunteers. In 1865 he was appointed\r\nprofessor of geology and curator of the museum in the Illinois Wesleyan\r\nuniversity at Bloomington, and afterwards at the Normal university.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 he commenced a series of expeditions to the Rocky Mountains and\r\nthe canyons of the Green and Colorado rivers, during the course of which\r\n(1869) he made a daring boat-journey of three months through the Grand\r\nCanyon; he also made a special study of the Indians and their languages\r\nfor the Smithsonian Institution, in which he founded and directed a\r\nbureau of ethnology. His able work led to the establishment under the U.\r\nS. Government of the geographical and geological survey of the Rocky\r\nMountain region with which he was occupied from 1870 to 1879. This\r\nsurvey was incorporated with the United States geological and\r\ngeographical survey in 1879, when Powell became director of the bureau\r\nof ethnology. In 1881, Powell was appointed director also of the\r\ngeological survey, a post which he occupied until 1894. He died in\r\nHaven, Me., on Sept. 23, 1902.\"\r\n\r\nOn two panes of glass in the front windows of this old house are names\r\netched by a diamond--on one is \"Genevieve Powell,\" under it \"Louis Hill\"\r\nand under that \"1884.\" She probably was the daughter of Mr. Powell.\r\n\r\nOn the other pane of glass is etched \"Moses and Mary.\" To the owners of\r\nthe house that means nothing, but to me it means \"Moses Moore,\" who was\r\nnot a man but a woman (whose real name was \"Frank\"), and Mary Compton,\r\nboth of whom I knew and still know.\r\n\r\nIn the nineties it was for awhile the home of Mrs. Donna Otie Compton,\r\nwho was the daughter of Bishop James Hervey Otie, first Episcopal Bishop\r\nof Tennessee. She was a picturesque figure, attired in her widow's cap\r\nand long crepe veil. Mrs. Compton had four daughters who were great\r\nbelles.\r\n\r\nThen for a good many years it stood there looking quite deserted, for\r\nold Mr. Arnold, its owner, was almost a cripple and one rarely saw him\r\nmaking his way up the street with great difficulty. Now General and Mrs.\r\nFrank R. McCoy have bought it and made it a charming house with a lovely\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nThrough the alley just north of here, described in the title as \"a\r\nprivate road,\" we can reach another house built on that same property of\r\nthe Harry's, but just who built it I do not know. It also was vacant\r\nwhen I was a girl, for I remember going to a Fair there one night in the\r\nspring when it had been loaned for some charity. In 1930 the house was\r\nbought by Miss Harriet and Miss Mary Winslow, who have added a lovely\r\nmusic room at the rear, but have kept the old-time appearance of the\r\nhouse. A mammoth oak tree, the pride of the owners, stands near the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe next house on Congress (31st) Street has another fine oak tree in\r\nfront of it, and used to have a companion even larger on the other side\r\nof the walk. This property also came through Mrs. Harriot Beall Williams\r\nto Mrs. Brooke Williams, senior, and her daughter, Mrs. Johns, who lived\r\nthere with her family.\r\n\r\nA romantic story is told of how Captain William Brooke Johns, of the\r\nUnited States Army, one day saw at a picnic the beautiful Miss Leonora\r\nde la Roche, and fell in love with her immediately. But, since it was\r\nnot considered good form in those days to be presented to a lady at a\r\npicnic, he watched her from a distance all day. The next afternoon he\r\nwent to call. It was a case of love at first sight for both, and the\r\nwedding soon followed, with all the military splendor. As was told\r\nbefore, when the Civil War came he left the Union Army. Captain Johns\r\nhad quite a talent for carving, and did a very good medallion of General\r\nGrant, who continued always to be a true friend to him. He also invented\r\na tent which was used during the Civil War by the Northern Army.\r\n\r\nThis house was, for more than a generation, the home of Colonel and Mrs.\r\nJohn Addison.\r\n\r\nAt that time it was a two-story house, with quite a different roof. It\r\nwas a big, merry household with four sons and four daughters. The\r\ndaughters were reigning belles in those days, and the old custom of\r\nserenading was much in vogue. One lovely moonlight night four swains\r\nwith their guitars stationed themselves under the windows of the\r\nhandsome old house and sang plaintive love songs for an hour or more.\r\nFinally a shutter was pushed open very gently, and the four hearts went\r\npitter-patter, anticipating the sight of a lovely young girl's face.\r\nInstead, appeared an old, black one, capped by a snowy turban, and these\r\nwords floated down: \"I'se sorrie, gen'le-men, but de young ladies is all\r\ngone out--but I sure is pleased wid you-all's music!\" The quartet was\r\ncomposed of Summerfield McKenney, Frank Steele, and a young Noyes, of\r\nthe family now for many years identified with _The Evening Star_, and\r\nanother whose name I do not know.\r\n\r\nIt was while the Addisons were living here that Commodore Kennon was so\r\ntragically killed on the _Princeton_.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon the youngest member of the Addison family, a little girl,\r\nwas swinging in the yard when a carriage came up the street and turned\r\nin at the gate of Tudor Place, across the street. In it she saw her\r\nolder brother, John. Much mystified, she ran to her mother, telling her\r\nhow strange it seemed for \"brother John\" to be coming up the hill in a\r\ncarriage, and not coming home. It turned out that he had been sent to\r\nnotify Mrs. Thomas Peter of the sudden death of her son-in-law.\r\n\r\nIn later years Brooke Williams, junior, lived here and, still later,\r\nGeorge W. Cissel. The chapel of the Presbyterian Church on West (P)\r\nStreet is named for this family. The house is now the home of Mr.\r\nAlfred Friendly, the well-known newspaper man.\r\n\r\nNext door, where there is now a big apartment house, used to be a large,\r\ndouble brick house, which was for many years the home of Abraham Herr,\r\nwho with the Cissels conducted an important flour-milling business in\r\nGeorgetown. His son, Austin Herr, was a fine figure of a man, and was, I\r\nthink, a promoter. I distinctly remember as a little girl his return\r\nfrom a trip to China and the tales of all the treasures he had brought\r\nback with him--not so common then as now.\r\n\r\nAt No. 1669, in the eighties lived one of the oddest characters--Mrs.\r\nDall. She had come from Massachusetts many years before to teach at Miss\r\nEnglish's Seminary. While there she received frequent visits from young\r\nMr. Dall who was an assistant at Christ Church while finishing his\r\ncourse at the Episcopal Seminary near Alexandria. The gentleman stayed\r\nso late sometimes--probably until eleven o'clock--that Miss English had\r\nto ask him to mend his ways. The courtship resulted in a marriage, but\r\nbefore long the bridegroom went off to India as a missionary to convert\r\nthe heathen. After some years the news came that, instead, he had been\r\nconverted to Hinduism. At last he was coming home. It was in the spring\r\nand, of course, there had to be a spring cleaning, which took several\r\ndays. One night about twelve o'clock, when the peace of the old-time\r\nworld, minus the automobile and blaring radio, lay over old Georgetown,\r\nthe clop-clop of horses' hoofs was heard coming up Congress Street,\r\nstopping in front of Mrs. Dall's. Then there was a great knocking on the\r\ndoor--a window was raised and a voice called: \"Who is that?\" \"It's\r\nHenry.\" Came back from the wife: \"Well, I'm in the midst of\r\nhouse-cleaning. Go on down to the Willard and stay until I send for\r\nyou.\" A warm welcome, and one not approved of by the neighbors who had\r\nheard the conversation through their windows.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dall was not very popular in Georgetown, it being overwhelmingly\r\nSouthern in its sympathies and she being an abolitionist. I can dimly\r\nremember her padding down 31st Street, for so her progress might be\r\ncalled from the form of footwear she wore, it had no form--the queerest,\r\nhigh, shapeless boots. She wore a little close-fitting bonnet and a\r\nlong, loose, grayish cape. She was a most particular person in some\r\nways. A lady who lived there as a housekeeper said she was never allowed\r\nto leave her thimble on the window sill for a few moments; and it was\r\nwell known that when a caller rang the front door bell the maid who\r\nanswered had orders to scan the costume closely. If there was \"bugle\r\ntrimming\" among its adornments the caller was shown into the parlor on\r\nthe right side, where the furniture was all stuffed and no harm could be\r\ndone, but if the clothes were devoid of the shiny, scratchy gear, she\r\nmight safely be allowed to enter and sit upon the polished mahogany of\r\nthe room on the left of the hall. She used to have a sort of salon for\r\nlong-haired scientists and exponents of all sorts of \"isms.\"\r\n\r\nAnother story I've heard was about her going out to Normanstone to stay\r\nfor a rest. One morning after breakfast, having had a plentiful helping\r\nof oatmeal with lots of cream, her hostess remarked to Mrs. Dall how\r\nwell she looked. \"Yes,\" she said, she \"felt well,\" and ended up with \"a\r\nlittle starvation is always good for one.\" Is it a wonder she wasn't\r\ngreatly beloved?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LLOYD BEALL]\r\n\r\nA very handsome and imposing old gentleman, Mr. Joe Davis, who was a\r\nbachelor, lived here in the nineties. I remember him always, in his\r\nfrock coat and high silk hat. This was where Mr. and Mrs. Fulton Lewis\r\nlived for many years and where their son, Fulton Lewis, junior, the\r\nnoted radio commentator, grew up.\r\n\r\nThe house has been for several years the home of the Honorable and Mrs.\r\nFrancis E. Biddle. He was the Attorney-General under President Franklin\r\nD. Roosevelt. Mrs. Biddle, whose pen name is Katharine Garrison Chapin,\r\nis an eminent poet.\r\n\r\nAdjoining Tudor Place on the north live the Bealls, descendants of Lloyd\r\nBeall, who sold his patrimony in southern Maryland and converted the\r\nproceeds to equipping and sustaining his company during the\r\nRevolutionary War. He was adjutant on the staff of General Alexander\r\nHamilton and was wounded at Germantown. Later he was captured by the\r\nBritish, but escaped by swimming the Santee River. The effect of this\r\nperformance is shown by the water-logging on his commission which he\r\ncarried in his pocket.\r\n\r\nAfter being mustered out of the army he came to live in Georgetown, but\r\njust where his home was I cannot discover. He served as mayor of the\r\ntown three times--in 1797, 1798 and 1799.\r\n\r\nUpon the reorganization of the army he was reinstated, and died in\r\ncommand of the arsenal at Harper's Ferry. The Bealls who live here are\r\nalso descended from Francis Dodge and from William Marbury.\r\n\r\nIn the seventies Frederick L. Moore came in to Georgetown from the\r\ncountry and built his home next door, so as to be between his two\r\nfriends, John Beall and Joseph H. Bradley. The Bradleys no longer own\r\nthis house nor their ancestral estate which was Chevy Chase, where the\r\nclub of that name now is. Abraham Bradley came with the government from\r\nPhiladelphia, as Assistant Postmaster-General. He made his home in\r\nWashington City and then bought Chevy Chase as his country estate. He\r\nwas living there in August, 1814, when the British came to Washington.\r\nIt is said that several members of the cabinet took refuge with him\r\nthere during those two or three dreadful days and brought with them\r\nvaluable records. His old house was mostly destroyed by fire several\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nHis grandson, Joseph Henry Bradley, built the house at number 1688 31st\r\nStreet. At the time of Lincoln's assassination he was living out in the\r\ncountry near Georgetown. He bore a remarkable resemblance to John Wilkes\r\nBooth and on April 15, 1865, the night after the tragic event in Ford's\r\nTheater, he was driving home in his buggy along a lonely road when he\r\nwas held up by policemen and arrested. When he protested, he was told\r\nthat he was John Wilkes Booth and was taken to jail. He insisted he was\r\nnot, but to no avail. After a good while he got in touch with friends\r\nwho identified him and he was released and went home. His wife had\r\nthought that her colored servants had been behaving strangely all day,\r\nbut though living not more than five miles from the scene of the great\r\ntragedy, she herself had no knowledge of it.\r\n\r\nIn later years Mr. Bradley and his father, Joseph Habersham Bradley, who\r\npracticed law together, served as counsel in the famous John Surratt\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nThis house is now the home of Robert A. Taft, Senator from Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\n_Evermay, the Heights, and Oak Hill_\r\n\r\n\r\nEvermay, on Montgomery (28th) Street, is one of the show-places of\r\nGeorgetown. Its fascinating garden is shown every spring for the benefit\r\nof Georgetown Children's House by its owner, the Honorable F. Lamot\r\nBelin, at one time Ambassador to Poland. He removed the cream-colored\r\npaint from the old house, revealing the lovely old-rose brick, and built\r\nthe wall and the lodge at the gate when he bought the place in 1924.\r\nEvermay used to extend all the way down to Stoddert (Q) Street. The\r\noriginal boundary is the little old stone in the corner of the property\r\nof Mrs. Thomas Bradley on Q and 28th Streets.\r\n\r\nEvermay was built by Samuel Davidson with proceeds from the sale of\r\nproperty to the United States government. This included land for the\r\nnorthern part of the \"President's Square,\" (the David Burns-Davidson\r\nproperty line passing directly through the White House) and adjacent\r\nFederal property including Lafayette Park. He willed his estate to Lewis\r\nGrant, a nephew in Scotland, upon condition of his assuming the Davidson\r\nsurname.\r\n\r\nSamuel Davidson is buried in the portion of Oak Hill Cemetery which was\r\nformerly part of the estate. Mr. Davidson must have been rather a\r\nstrange person; certainly he was determined not to be bothered by\r\npeople, for this is the advertisement he published:\r\n\r\n    Evermay proclaims,\r\n    Take care, enter not here,\r\n    For punishment is ever near.\r\n\r\n    Whereas, the height called Evermay, adjoining this town, is now\r\n    completely enclosed with a good stone wall in part and a good post\r\n    and rail fence thereto, this is to forewarn at their peril, all\r\n    persons, of whatever age, color, or standing in society, from\r\n    trespassing on the premises, in any manner, by day or by night;\r\n    particularly all thieving knaves and idle vagabonds; all rambling\r\n    parties; all assignation parties; all amorous bucks with their\r\n    dorfies, and all sporting bucks with their dogs and guns.\r\n\r\n    My man, Edward, who resides on the premises, has my positive orders\r\n    to protect the same from all trespassers as far as in his power,\r\n    with the aid of the following implements, placed in his hands for\r\n    that purpose, if necessary, viz:--Law, when the party is worthy of\r\n    that attention and proper testimony can be had, a good cudgel,\r\n    tomahawk, cutlass, gun and blunderbuss, with powder, shot and\r\n    bullets, steel traps and grass snakes.\r\n\r\n    It is Edward's duty to obey my lawful commands. In so doing, on this\r\n    occasion, I will defend him at all risques and hazards. For the\r\n    information of those persons who may have real business on the\r\n    premises, there is a good and convenient gate. But Mark! I do not\r\n    admit mere curisoity an errand of business. Therefore, I beg and\r\n    pray of all my neighbors to avoid Evermay as they would a den of\r\n    devils, or rattle snakes, and thereby save themselves and me much\r\n    vexation and trouble.\r\n\r\n    June 2, 1810           SAMUEL DAVIDSON.\r\n\r\nLewis Grant's daughter married Charles Dodge, they being one of the four\r\ncouples who had the very early morning wedding at Francis Dodge's home\r\non the corner of Stoddert (Q) Street and Congress (31st) Street. Apropos\r\nof this there is a prized letter of four closely written pages from\r\nCharles Dodge to his father, announcing that he had reached the age of\r\ntwenty-one and asking the parental gift of what might be \"his due.\" He\r\nended by saying he \"hoped he approved of his engaging in the estate of\r\nHoly Matrimony, for without that blissful comsummation his life would be\r\nvoid of happiness forevermore.\" His father's concise reply was in four\r\nlines: \"Attend carefully whatever business you engage in, put off your\r\nmarriage as long as possible, and get religion!\"\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Charles Dodge did not live always at Evermay. It was sold\r\nto Mr. John D. McPherson, and the Dodges went to live in the old frame\r\nhouse opposite the gate of Tudor Place.\r\n\r\nFor many years the McPhersons leased Evermay to Mr. William B. Orme and,\r\ncertainly, during those years the spectre of the inhospitality of its\r\nfirst owner was laid, for the Ormes were noted for their delightful\r\nparties and there, too, were June weddings with charming brides.\r\n\r\nOne morning in 1905 a group of Georgetown ladies met at Evermay and\r\nformed a little literary club (which is still in existence) composed of\r\nthirty-five members. It still bears the name of The Evermay Club. It met\r\nthere regularly once a month as long as it was the home of Mrs. Orme,\r\nbut nowadays the club moves from house to house. One summer the Ormes\r\nrented Evermay to a Hawaiian princess, who enjoyed it with her family.\r\n\r\nJust across the street from Evermay is what is known as Mackall Square.\r\nThe old mansion sits so far back in the middle of the square and is so\r\nembowered in trees that it is not easily seen from either Montgomery\r\n(28th) or Greene (29th) Street. It is a simple and lovely colonial brick\r\nwith old wooden additions on the back, and has been there a long, long\r\ntime. But it is not the first house that was on that spot, for the one\r\nthat was there was the frame house which was moved over opposite the\r\ngate of Tudor Place.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Mackall married a daughter of Brooke Beall, and with the money\r\ninherited from her father's estate they bought this property and built\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 a trust was placed on the property, and in the title is recorded\r\n\"no encumbrance except a small wooden house in which Mrs. Margaret Beall\r\nnow lives, in which she has her life interest.\"\r\n\r\nBenjamin Mackall was a brother of Leonard Mackall. Their father owned\r\nlarge estates in Calvert and Prince Georges Counties in Maryland, and\r\nhis products were sent to the Georgetown market; so it happened that his\r\nsons met the daughters of Brooke Beall, one of the important merchants\r\nshipping grain and tobacco to England.\r\n\r\nThis land was part of the Rock of Dumbarton, and Benjamin's wife was\r\nnamed Christiana. I wonder if by any chance they could have given her\r\nthat name in commemoration of another Christiana who is spoken of in an\r\nold, old surveyor's book thus:\r\n\r\n    Surveyed for George Beall 18 January, 1720. Beginning at the bounded\r\n    Red Oak standing at the end of N. N. W. tract of land called Rock of\r\n    Dunbarton on the south side of a hill near the place where\r\n    Christiana Gun was killed by the Indians.\r\n\r\nLouis Mackall, their son, was born in this house and inherited the place\r\nin 1839. He was a well-known physician, but a large part of his life was\r\nspent at the old country home of the Mackalls, Mattaponi, in Prince\r\nGeorges County, and there his son, Louis, was born in 1831. His father\r\nbrought him to Georgetown when he was under ten years of age, and\r\nentered him in Mr. Abbott's school, from whence he went to Georgetown\r\nCollege and Maryland Medical University. He established a large practice\r\nin Georgetown and married Margaret McVean. Their home was not here but\r\non Dumbarton Avenue and Congress (31st) Street, and they had a son,\r\nagain Louis, who also went into the medical profession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD MACKALL HOUSE]\r\n\r\nThis house was vacant when I was a girl and I remember very distinctly\r\ngoing to a dance there one heavenly moonlight night in June when it was\r\nloaned to the O. T. That was a little club of boys about my own\r\nage--\"Only Ten\"--but the meaning of the name was a secret then. During\r\nthe next two years they followed the example of the I. K. T. by giving\r\ndances in Linthicum Hall during the Christmas holidays.\r\n\r\nThe I. K. T. was a group of boys two or three years older than the O. T.\r\nMy brother was one of them, and when I asked him a year or two ago what\r\nthe letters meant he said he couldn't tell; it was still a secret, like\r\na fraternity. They had a pin somewhat like a fraternity pin. I still\r\nhave the engraved invitations that both clubs sent out for their dances,\r\nwith the names of the members underneath.\r\n\r\nAfter having been vacant for years this place was bought by Mr. Hermann\r\nHollerith in the early 1900's. He did not make his home here but built a\r\nhouse farther down on Greene (29th) Street, where his family still live.\r\nThey continue to rent the old house. Hermann Hollerith was the inventor\r\nof the tabulating machine which is used by the International Business\r\nMachine Corporation, and his work was done in a little house down on\r\nThomas Jefferson Street. His wife was Miss Lucia Talcott.\r\n\r\nImmediately opposite the steps on Greene (29th) Street which lead up to\r\nthis dear old place are other high steps which lead to a place called\r\nTerrace Top. Here it was that in the winter of 1920-'21 two very\r\ncharming people came to rest in what they considered the most attractive\r\nof American cities. They were Julia Marlowe and E. H. Sothern.\r\n\r\nWhile they were here Miss Marlowe was honored by George Washington\r\nUniversity at its one hundredth anniversary, on February twenty-second,\r\nby receiving the degree of D. D. L., a most unusual honor for a woman.\r\nThis house is now the home of Mr. Herbert Elliston, editor of the\r\n_Washington Post_.\r\n\r\nAll of this land was still, of course, Beall property, and somehow it\r\nall seemed to pass down through the women, for the next place to the\r\nwest originally belonged to Miss Eliza Beall, a daughter of Thomas Beall\r\nof George, who married George Corbin Washington, great-nephew of General\r\nWashington. He was a grandson of John Augustine Washington and Hannah\r\nBushrod. He was president of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company,\r\nmember of Congress from Maryland, and a prominent candidate for the\r\nVice-Presidency at the time Winfield Scott was nominated for President.\r\n\r\nTheir son was the Lewis Washington who was living near Harper's Ferry at\r\nthe time of John Brown's raid, and was taken prisoner by him and held as\r\na hostage until released by Colonel Robert E. Lee and his United States\r\ntroops when they arrived on the scene.\r\n\r\nMiss Eleanor Ann Washington, the daughter of the house, was skilled in\r\npainting and did miniatures of her mother and of other members of her\r\nfamily. She also used to sketch in the beautiful woods north of her\r\nfather's home, which soon after became Oak Hill Cemetery, and she was\r\nthe first person to be buried in its grounds.\r\n\r\nGeorge Corbin Washington married a second time, a girl who had been\r\nalmost like a daughter in his house, Ann Thomas Beall Peter, of whom his\r\nwife had been very fond. Both of the wives of George Corbin Washington\r\nwere descended from the Reverend John Orme, a distinguished clergyman of\r\nMaryland in colonial days.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Mr. Washington the place was sold and became the home\r\nof Senator Jesse D. Bright, of Indiana, who was deprived of his seat in\r\nthe Senate during the Civil War because of his sympathy with the South.\r\n\r\nFor a long time this place belonged to Columbus Alexander, but in recent\r\nyears it has changed hands several times. It had been leased by the\r\nHonorable Dwight Morrow to be his home while Senator from New Jersey,\r\nbut his sudden death the summer before of course changed that\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nDuring World War II it was the home of General William (Wild Bill)\r\nDonovan, head of OSS, and is now the home of Mr. Philip Graham,\r\npublisher of the _Washington Post_.\r\n\r\nAll of this property of The Heights belonged, as I have said, to Thomas\r\nBeall, and after 1783 it was rapidly being \"developed,\" as they say\r\nnowadays. It is interesting to follow out how it all happened and how\r\nrelatives wished to live one another.\r\n\r\nDirectly across Washington (30th) Street, a large piece of land was sold\r\nby Thomas Beall in 1798 to William Craik, who was the son of that Dr.\r\nCraik who attended General Washington in his last illness. He evidently\r\nintended to build a home here, but Mrs. Craik died and he soon followed\r\nher. She was Miss Fitzhugh, a sister of Mrs. George Washington Parke\r\nCustis, of Arlington.\r\n\r\nHow I wish there were in existence a picture of the house which David\r\nPeter built in 1808 when he bought this piece of land. The house must\r\nhave stood among handsome trees, for it was called Peter's Grove, and we\r\ncan look at the oaks still standing in near-by places and visualize\r\nthose which surrounded this house.\r\n\r\nDavid Peter was a son of Robert Peter. He married Sarah Johns, and had\r\ntwo daughters and one son, Hamilton. After his death Mrs. David Peter\r\nmarried John Leonard, and the place was sold, in the thirties, to\r\nColonel John Carter, Representative in Congress from South Carolina. His\r\nwife was Eleanor Marbury, one of that large family of girls in the old\r\nhouse on Bridge (M) Street. The house was then renamed Carolina Place.\r\n\r\nFor a while it was occupied by the Honorable John F. Crampton, Minister\r\nfrom England. It was during this time that a treaty was settled by him\r\nwith Daniel Webster concerning the Newfoundland fisheries. A little\r\nlater Count de Sartiges, the French Minister, lived here.\r\n\r\nAbout that time the house was destroyed by fire and the land was sold by\r\nJohn Carter O'Neal, of the Inniskillen Dragoons, son of Anne Carter who\r\nhad married an Englishman, to Henry D. Cooke.\r\n\r\nThe western part of this square was bought in 1805 by Mrs. Elisha O.\r\nWilliams. She was Harriot Beall, daughter of Brooke Beall, the third of\r\nthese sisters to settle on The Heights, and she also bought her home\r\nwith money inherited from her father's estate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME OF BROOKE WILLIAMS]\r\n\r\nSix months after buying the property Mrs. Williams was left a widow. She\r\nbuilt a home and lived there with her small children, and thirty years\r\nlater gave the northern part of her land to her son, Brooke Williams and\r\nhis wife, Rebecca. It was on the spot where the Home for the Blind now\r\nstands.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rebecca Williams was a very beautiful woman and all her children\r\ninherited her beauty. The daughter who was named Harriot Beall for her\r\ngrandmother became the most famous girl who ever grew up in Georgetown.\r\nThe romantic story of her marriage to Baron Bodisco, the Russian\r\nMinister, runs thus:\r\n\r\n     It all started with a Christmas party which the baron gave for his\r\n     nephews, Waldemar and Boris Bodisco. To this party all of the boys\r\n     and girls were invited, and great bonfires lighted the way, for\r\n     there was little gas in those days.\r\n\r\nAmong those who came was Harriot Beall Williams, the beautiful\r\nsixteen-year-old daughter of Brooke Williams, senior. Baron Bodisco, a\r\nbachelor of sixty-three, became completely enamored of Miss Williams\r\nthat evening, and it is said that the next morning he walked up the hill\r\nto meet and escort her to school--the school, of course, being the same\r\nSeminary of Miss English.\r\n\r\nMy story is copied almost entirely from Miss Sally Somervell Mackall's\r\n_Early Days of Washington_, for nothing could improve on that:\r\n\r\n    Miss Williams' family were much opposed to the marriage, and at one\r\n    time the engagement came near being broken. She told Mr. Bodisco\r\n    that \"her grandmother and everybody else thought he was entirely too\r\n    old and ugly.\" His reply was that she might find someone younger and\r\n    better looking, but no one who would love her better than he did.\r\n\r\n    They were married in June, 1849, at four o'clock in the afternoon,\r\n    at her mother's home on Georgetown Heights. Only the immediate\r\n    relatives and the bridal party witnessed the ceremony, after which\r\n    there was a brilliant reception. The wedding party formed a circle\r\n    and just back of them on a sofa sat a row of aged ladies in\r\n    lace-trimmed caps, among them her grandmother, Harriot Williams and\r\n    her three sisters, Mrs. Benjamin Mackall, Mrs. William Stewart,\r\n    senior, and their cousin, Mrs. Leonard Hollyday Johns, senior, all\r\n    of whom were between seventy and eighty years of age.\r\n\r\n    The mariage ceremony was performed by her cousin, Reverend Hollyday\r\n    Johns, the second. Her trousseau came from abroad, and her bridal\r\n    robe was a marvel of rich white satin and costly lace which fell in\r\n    graceful folds around her; the low-cut dress showed to perfection\r\n    her lovely white shoulders and neck. On her fair brow and golden\r\n    hair was worn a coronet of rarest pearls, the gift of the groom. The\r\n    effect was wonderfully brilliant. As her father was not living, her\r\n    hand was given in marriage by Henry Clay.\r\n\r\n    The groom wore his court dress of velvet and lace. All the\r\n    bridesmaids, seven in number, were beautiful girls about her own\r\n    age. Their gowns were figured white satin, cut low in the neck with\r\n    short sleeves and trimmed with blond lace; their hair was simply\r\n    dressed without ornaments. The bridesmaids were: her sister Gennie\r\n    Williams, Sarah Johns, Jessie Benton, Ellen Carter, Eliza Jane\r\n    Wilson, Emily Nichols, Mary Harry, and Helen Morris, daughter of\r\n    Commodore Morris. Each bridesmaid was presented with a ring set with\r\n    her favorite stone. The groomsmen were Henry Fox, the British\r\n    Minister in scarlet court dress; Mr. Dunlop, Minister from Texas;\r\n    Mr. Martineau, Minister from the Netherlands; Mr. Buchanan, who had\r\n    been Minister to Russia, and was then Senator, and afterwards\r\n    President of the United States; Baron Saruyse, the Austrian\r\n    Minister; Martin Van Buren; Mr. Kemble Paulding, whose father was\r\n    Secretary of the Navy at that time; Mr. Forsythe, whose father was\r\n    Secretary of State. Each minister had his own carriage and\r\n    attendants dressed in livery. The house and grounds were thronged\r\n    with noted guests, strolling amid sweet-scented flowers and lemon\r\n    trees hanging with rich golden fruit.\r\n\r\n    Among the distinguished guests were President Van Buren; Daniel\r\n    Webster; all the Diplomatic Corps and a host of other notables,\r\n    including James Gordon Bennett of _The New York Herald_.\r\n\r\n    The bride was taken to her new home in Mr. Bodisco's gilded coach\r\n    with driver and footman in bright uniform, drawn by four horses. The\r\n    same afternoon, Mr. Bodisco gave a dinner to just the bridal party.\r\n    At nine o'clock the same day he gave a general reception for the\r\n    families of the attendants. The morning after the wedding the\r\n    bridesmaids took breakfast with the bride and, girl-like, as soon as\r\n    breakfast was over, went on an investigating tour. In her boudoir\r\n    they found many beautiful things, among them an old-fashioned\r\n    secretary, with numerous drawers, one was filled with ten dollar\r\n    gold pieces, another with silver dollars, another with ten-cent\r\n    pieces, another with the costliest of jewels, and still another with\r\n    French candy.\r\n\r\n    The next week Mr. Bodisco gave a grand ball, on which occasion\r\n    Madame Bodisco wore her bridal robe. Shortly after the wedding,\r\n    President Van Buren gave a handsome dinner at the White House in\r\n    honor of Madame Bodisco and Mrs. Decantzo, another bride. To this\r\n    dinner all the bridal party were invited. Madame Bodisco wore a\r\n    black watered silk, trimmed with black thread lace and pearl\r\n    ornaments. President Van Buren sent his private carriage and his\r\n    son, Martin, to escort Ellen Carter (an adopted daughter of Jeremiah\r\n    Williams who was an important shipping merchant of the town) to the\r\n    dinner. The President thought Miss Carter like her Aunt Marion\r\n    Stewart of New York, to whom he was engaged while Governor of that\r\n    State. At the dinner table he drank wine with her, and again in the\r\n    reception room. Miss Carter afterwards married Paymaster Brenton\r\n    Boggs of the United States Navy.\r\n\r\n    On another occasion at one of the diplomatic dinners given at the\r\n    White House, Madame Bodisco wore a rich, white watered silk, the\r\n    sleeves, waist and skirt embroidered with pale rosebuds with\r\n    tender green leaves. Her jewels were diamonds and emeralds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MADAME BODISCO]\r\n\r\nAlexander de Bodisco was born in Moscow on the 30th of October, 1786,\r\nand died at his residence in Georgetown on the 23rd of January, 1854,\r\nhaving filled the post of Russian Envoy to the United States for about\r\nseventeen years. He was in Vienna in 1814 during the famous Congress\r\nwhich settled the affairs of the continent, and was afterward charge\r\nd'affaires at Stockholm. At his funeral his two nephews, Boris and\r\nWaldemar, both very handsome and dressed in white uniforms, marched on\r\neither side of the hearse, accompanied by attaches of the legation and\r\nmembers of the household in uniform.\r\n\r\nAll during my childhood the Williams house stood gaunt and untenanted,\r\nthe personification of a haunted house. If only a place with such a\r\nhistory could have been renovated and kept, instead of disappearing\r\nentirely from Georgetown.\r\n\r\nOn the next block at 3238 R Street is the house, now somewhat changed,\r\nwhere lived General H. W. Halleck, chief-of-staff of the army during the\r\nCivil War. After the war General U. S. Grant made it his home until he\r\nbecame president. Later, until about 1900, it was the home of Colonel\r\nJohn J. Joyce, a picturesque figure with his leonine head and long white\r\nhair and mustache and black sombrero. It was said he had been the Goat\r\nof the Whiskey Ring. In the last years of his life a lively dispute\r\narose between him and Ella Wheeler Wilcox as to which was the author of\r\nthe lines\r\n\r\n    Laugh, and world laughs with you,\r\n    Weep, and you weep alone!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNT HOPE. THE WILLIAM ROBINSON HOUSE]\r\n\r\nIt was much discussed in the newspapers at the time. Colonel Joyce's\r\ntombstone in Oak Hill bears a likeness of him carved upon its face.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the New Deal this house was rented by a group of\r\nyoung men, among them Tommy Corcoran and Ben Cohen, who were responsible\r\nfor helping to frame much of the legislation of that eventful time. It\r\nwas known then as the \"Big Red House on R Street.\"\r\n\r\nThe southwest corner of Road (R) Street and High (Wisconsin Avenue) was\r\nthe land owned by Thomas Sim Lee, who had been Governor of Maryland.\r\nEvery winter he came from his estate, Needwood, to spend several months\r\nin Georgetown, in his house on the northwest corner of Bridge (M) Street\r\nand Washington (30th) Street, which was for a long time the headquarters\r\nof the Federal Party. He died in 1819 before he could build here the\r\nmansion he contemplated.\r\n\r\nUntil about 1935 the old reservoir sat here, high up like a crown, until\r\nthe Georgetown Branch of the Public Library was built.\r\n\r\nThe little street below here which runs west from Valley (32nd) Street,\r\nnow called Reservoir Road, was originally named the New Cut Road, due to\r\nthe fact that it was cut through to connect with the Conduit Road, now\r\nrenamed MacArthur Boulevard which covers the conduit bringing the water\r\nfrom Great Falls to Washington.\r\n\r\nOn the southwest corner of Road (R) Street and High (Wisconsin Avenue)\r\nstood the imposing mansion of Mr. William Robinson, who was a very fine\r\nlawyer in the middle of the nineteenth century. He was a Virginian who\r\nhad settled in Georgetown. He called his home Mount Hope and a\r\nwonderful situation it had, commanding a view of the entire city and the\r\nriver. At that time the western wing was the ballroom, with domed\r\nceiling circled by cupids and roses.\r\n\r\nMr. Robinson's beautiful daughter, Margaret, married Thomas Campbell\r\nCox, son of Colonel John Cox, and they lived at Mount Hope until they\r\nmoved to Gay Street. I remember Mrs. Cox as an old lady, still\r\nbeautiful, and regal in bearing. The Weaver family lived there after\r\nthat until the early 1900's, when this place was used as the Dumbarton\r\nClub. It had very good tennis courts, and for a while a nine-hole golf\r\ncourse where the suburb of Berleith is now.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Alexander Kirk, Ambassador to Egypt, bought the place and made\r\na good many changes, including the addition of a swimming-pool.\r\n\r\nAfterward Mrs. Evalyn Walsh McLean purchased it and renamed it\r\nFriendship, after the former estate of the same name out on Wisconsin\r\nAvenue, where many famous parties had been given. Here she continued her\r\nlavish entertainments and during World War II contributed generously to\r\nthe pleasure of members of the armed services.\r\n\r\nThe large house, number 3406, in the middle of the next square, was\r\nbuilt in the early 1800's by Leonard Mackall, one of the two sons of\r\nBenjamin Mackall of Prince Georges County, Maryland, who came to\r\nGeorgetown. He married Catherine Beall, another daughter of Brooke\r\nBeall. Mr. Beall, as seems to have been the custom in those days, had\r\ngiven this square to his daughter and her husband. The place was bought\r\nby Dr. Charles Worthington's family when they left their home on\r\nProspect Street and was held by his descendants, the Philips, for many\r\nyears, although the latter part of the time none of them lived there,\r\nbut rented the place.\r\n\r\nIt has been for a good many years now the home of Mrs. Frank West, who\r\nhas made a beautiful rose garden and christened it Century House. The\r\nhouse itself has charming rooms, all opening to the south, as so many\r\nold-fashioned houses had, and several porches.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of Colonel Cox and the row of houses he built on First (N)\r\nStreet and Frederick (34th) Street, where he lived for a while in the\r\nhouse on the corner. That must have been in the period of his first\r\nmarriage to Matilda Smith, who was a sister of Clement Smith, well-known\r\nas the first cashier of the Farmer's and Mechanic's Bank, later its\r\npresident. Colonel and Mrs. Cox had three children, one of whom was\r\nnamed Clement.\r\n\r\nAfter his marriage to Jane Threlkeld they built a lovely house on part\r\nof the old Berleith estate next door to the old Threlkeld home, which\r\nhad been burned. They called their home The Cedars. It stood where the\r\nWestern High School now stands, and it is difficult to realize that\r\nthere, in my memory, was a home most delightfully private and charming.\r\n\r\nTurning back eastward along Road (R) Street just opposite Mount Hope,\r\nthe pretty old light brick house is where the Marburys lived after they\r\nmoved up on The Heights. He called himself Mr. John Marbury, junior, to\r\nthe day of his death, in spite of having a long, white beard. Although\r\nhis family never moved from this house, in the course of a few years\r\nthey had three different addresses. At first they were living on the\r\ncorner of Road and High Streets, then on the corner of U and 32nd\r\nStreets, and finally on the corner of R Street and Wisconsin Avenue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OAKS (NOW DUMBARTON OAKS)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTROSE]\r\n\r\nAcross High Street (Wisconsin Avenue), the house sitting high on the\r\nbank was for many years the home of Mr. William Dougal and his family of\r\none son and four lovely daughters. His wife was Miss Adler, and this\r\nhouse was built on part of her father's property. The old brick house,\r\nwhich was back of it some distance north, was the home of Morris Adler.\r\nA small frame house nearer Road (R) Street was where his son, Morris J.\r\nAdler, lived, until he built a house on West (P) Street.\r\n\r\nA little way eastward on the same side of Road (R) Street is the famous\r\nDumbarton Oaks. The land was first bought from Thomas Beall in 1800 by\r\nWilliam H. Dorsey, first judge of our Orphan's Court, who was appointed\r\nby President Jefferson. Mr. Dorsey had previously been living in the old\r\npart of the town, for I find an advertisement of the sale of his\r\nproperty before he came up here, and from the minutes of a meeting of\r\nthe Corporation of Georgetown on October 24th, 1801, we find the\r\nfollowing: \"William H. Dorsey writes to ask if his removal to his\r\npresent place of residence will disqualify him from serving on the\r\nCorporation. They are of opinion it does not disqualify him as a member\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\nHe built this house, named it The Oaks, and lived in it for four years.\r\nHis first wife was Ann Brooke, the daughter of Colonel Richard Brooke,\r\nof Oak Hill, Sandy Spring, whose wife was Jane Lynn, the daughter of\r\nDavid Lynn. In 1802 Mr. Dorsey married Rosetta Lynn, who was the aunt of\r\nhis first wife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM HAMMOND DORSEY]\r\n\r\nWilliam Hammond Dorsey was born at Oakland, in Howard County, and died\r\nat Oakley, near Brookeville, in 1818. He was a very handsome man and was\r\nnicknamed \"Pretty Billy\" by his Quaker neighbors of Sandy Spring.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 the place was bought by Robert Beverley of Essex County,\r\nVirginia. His wife was Jane Tayloe, a sister of Colonel John Tayloe, who\r\nbuilt the famous Octagon House. Mr. and Mrs. Beverley owned the place\r\nuntil 1822. During that time their son James was married to Jane Peter,\r\nthe daughter of David Peter of nearby \"Peter's Grove,\" and this place\r\nbecame their home. They did not remain here long, but went back to\r\nVirginia and established themselves near The Plains.\r\n\r\nThe next owner was James E. Calhoun, of South Carolina. He loaned it to\r\nhis distinguished brother, John C. Calhoun, who made it his home for\r\nsome of the time he spent at the capital in the various offices he held.\r\nHe was Secretary of War in the cabinet of President Monroe;\r\nVice-President with John Quincy Adams, and Andrew Jackson, and Senator\r\nfrom South Carolina. From here he wrote that the leisure of the office\r\nof Vice-President gave him a good opportunity to study the fundamental\r\nquestions of the day called \"The American System.\" At this time the\r\nplace was known as _Acrolophos_ (Grove on the Hill), a most descriptive\r\nname. Later it became Monterey, after the war with Mexico made that\r\nbattle so famous.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1846 that the estate was bought by Edward M. Linthicum, and I\r\nthink it must have been during the time he owned it that the mansard\r\nroof was added which, fortunately, has been removed by the present\r\nowners. In Mr. Linthicum's day it is described thus:\r\n\r\n    The house which has been changed, but not improved in appearance, by\r\n    the addition of a mansard roof and other alterations, was a large,\r\n    two-story brick, with hall from front to rear \"wide enough for a hay\r\n    wagon to pass through,\" on either side of which were great parlors\r\n    beautifully proportioned. The east parlor opened into a bright,\r\n    sunny dining room, which in turn looked out upon a well-filled\r\n    greenhouse, with flower gardens on the east, wooded lawn in front,\r\n    grove of forest trees on the west, and gently sloping well-sodded\r\n    hills in the rear, all of which were kept in perfect order. During\r\n    the life of Mr. Linthicum, \"The Oaks\" was the show place of the\r\n    District.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Linthicum had no children so they adopted a daughter, Miss\r\nKate Mitchell, of Lower Maryland, who became the wife of Mr. Josiah\r\nDent. Their son, Edward Linthicum Dent, inherited the place. In those\r\ndays it was known as \"The Oaks,\" the name I always heard it called by in\r\nmy girlhood.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 it was bought by Mr. Henry F. Blount, who had made a fortune and\r\ncame to Washington. In 1920 it was purchased by the Honorable Robert\r\nWoods Bliss, Ambassador to the Argentine. He and Mrs. Bliss remodeled\r\nthe house and created the gardens, which comprise over thirty acres and\r\nare marvels of beauty. Many more acres at the back were allowed to\r\nremain in a delightfully wild condition.\r\n\r\nThe place was renamed Dumbarton Oaks, a museum was built as a wing on\r\nthe west to house a library and a collection of Byzantine and\r\npre-Christian material, and in 1940 the estate was given by Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBliss to Harvard University, with the exception of the part along the\r\nstream at the back, which was donated to the District of Columbia as a\r\npark. The Dumbarton Oaks Conference which led to the formation of the\r\nUnited Nations was held here, beginning August 21, 1944.\r\n\r\nPart of the land at the back is where the Home for Incurables was until\r\nit was moved farther out of town. I used to go there to visit some of\r\nthe patients who were my friends, and for the simple Sunday evening\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nLover's Lane, at the east of Dumbarton Oaks, separates it from Montrose\r\nPark. It is still, as it has always been, I am glad to say, completely\r\nunimproved, unspoiled, sweet and rambling and quiet, wending its way\r\nalong the brook that empties into Rock Creek at the beginning of Oak\r\nHill. I suppose there is hardly a soul of middle-age living in\r\nGeorgetown who has not fond memories of Lover's Lane, for in the days of\r\nour youth we did walk with our lovers; no automobiles or movies filled\r\nour Saturday or Sunday afternoons, and very little golf.\r\n\r\nThrough Lover's Lane we went to Normanstone, the home of the two Misses\r\nBarnards and their sister, Mrs. Talcott. It was a quaint little house,\r\nwhich stood just about where the British Embassy now is. The name is\r\ncommemorated by Normanstone Drive. Mr. Robert Barnard built Normanstone\r\nin 1830. It was a Devonshire cottage of clay, straw, and pebbles, with\r\nwalls four feet thick.\r\n\r\nThe turreted stone mansion nearby was built by Mr. Elverson of\r\nPhiladelphia. His daughter, Nelly, became the wife of Monsieur\r\nPatrenotre, the French Minister. This was in the days before our foreign\r\nenvoys became Ambassadors.\r\n\r\nOur first knowledge of the present Montrose Park was as Parrott's Woods.\r\nRichard Parrott conducted there a \"rope walk.\" It seems that when they\r\nmade rope it was necessary to have a long, even stretch where the\r\nrope-makers walked up and down manufacturing the hemp into rope. And,\r\nof course, in this town with all its ships, the making of rope was a\r\nlucrative business.\r\n\r\nMr. Parrott evidently was kind in loaning his property for picnics too,\r\nfor again Mr. Gordon gives us vivid pictures of the Fourth of July\r\nannual picnic of all the Protestant Sunday schools. It seems to have\r\nbeen a huge affair, with flags and banners and rosettes of various\r\ncolors adorning the scholars of the different schools.\r\n\r\nIn 1822 the property was bought by Clement Smith, of whom I have spoken\r\nbefore as being the first cashier of the Farmers and Mechanics Bank,\r\nafterwards becoming its president. He called the place Elderslie. In\r\n1837 he sold it to Mrs. Mary McEwen Boyce, whose daughter, Jane, married\r\nGeorge Washington Peter, son of Thomas Peter of Tudor Place. In a\r\nrailroad accident, both Captain Boyce and another daughter were killed.\r\nMrs. Boyce continued to live here the rest of her life.\r\n\r\nIt was a very sweet, homelike house, but not a particularly handsome\r\none. There was a conservatory opening off of one of the rooms, for Mrs.\r\nBoyce seems to have been especially fond of flowers. A sweet little\r\nstory was told me the other day about her. A friend paused one day to\r\nadmire the roses blooming in front of the house, saying, \"How lovely\r\nyour roses are, Mrs. Boyce!\" \"They are not my roses,\" said she. At the\r\nsurprised look on her friend's face she continued, \"I plant them there\r\nfor the public.\" And still, today, there are lovely roses blooming at\r\nMontrose for \"the public,\" for after many, many years a movement was set\r\non foot to buy this place with its marvelous old trees of numerous\r\nvarieties for a park for the people of Georgetown.\r\n\r\nTwo historic events have taken place in Montrose Park. The first was\r\nlong ago, on September 1, 1812, when the funeral services were held here\r\nfor General James Maccubbin Lingan, after his tragic death in Baltimore.\r\nNo church could be found large enough to accommodate the crowds which\r\nwished to attend. There were representatives from three cities and five\r\ncounties, in those days of travel by foot, by saddle, by rowboat and by\r\ncoach. General Washington's tent was spread over the stand on which were\r\nfour clergymen, other dignitaries, and George Washington Parke Custis\r\nof Arlington, who delivered the oration.\r\n\r\nThe funeral cortege was escorted by Major George Peter's company. The\r\nGeneral's horse was led behind the hearse, where his son walked as chief\r\nmourner, followed by two heroes of the Revolution, Major Benjamin\r\nStoddert and Colonel Philip Stuart. Light Horse Harry Lee, who had been\r\nwounded at the time General Lingan was killed, was still too ill to be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lingan's widow was not able to be present because of a very\r\nunfortunate occurrence. While she was sitting by her window waiting for\r\nher carriage, a rough man, carrying a pike, stopped under her window\r\nand, thrusting up the weapon covered either with blood or rust, which\r\nhad the same appearance, he let forth a torrent of brutal words. She was\r\nso overcome with an agony of shock and grief that she was obliged to\r\nremain at home.\r\n\r\nThe other historic event took place on the fifth of June, 1918, the day\r\non which was inaugurated the draft for the soldiers of the World War I.\r\nAll over this land that evening speeches were delivered on the subject,\r\nbut I think none could have been more effective or impressive than the\r\none staged in Montrose Park at sunset. Then Newton D. Baker, as\r\nSecretary of War, in charge of the whole operation, \"elected to speak to\r\nhis neighbors.\" A wonderful speech it was, and I shall never forget the\r\nsight as he stood outlined against the glow of the western sky.\r\n\r\nOf Oak Hill Cemetery I have spoken again and again. It is almost like a\r\nrefrain. It seems to be the natural resting place for Georgetonians when\r\ntheir work is done.\r\n\r\nIts terraces leading steeply down the hill to Rock Creek are shaded by\r\nmany stately oak trees and numerous gorgeous copper beeches, and are\r\nadorned in the spring by flowering shrubs.\r\n\r\nThere is the little ivy-covered chapel which can be seen from the\r\nstreet, and farther back is the little white Greek temple where Oak\r\nHill's donor, Mr. Corcoran, rests. Also the larger circular mausoleum\r\nwhere Marcia Burns Van Ness is interred.\r\n\r\nMany besides Georgetonians have been laid to rest within its borders,\r\nfor there are Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War for President Lincoln;\r\nJames G. Blaine, and many more, all prominent in their days. There, too,\r\nlies Peggy O'Neale, who, as the wife of Andrew Jackson's Secretary of\r\nWar, Eaton, kept the social life of the Capital in an uproar for many a\r\nyear and, it is said, also greatly influenced political matters.\r\n\r\nHer very first triumph took place in Georgetown, when, at a school\r\nexhibition at the Union Hotel, the little girl with dark brown curly\r\nhair and pert red lips was crowned the \"Queen of Beauty\" by Mrs. Dolly\r\nMadison. Peggy was the daughter of the Irish landlord of a hotel on\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, and was married at sixteen to Mr. Timberlake, an\r\nofficer in the United States Navy. He committed suicide in 1828.\r\n\r\nAfter that began her career, when she was defended and supported in all\r\nthat she did by Andrew Jackson, who had suffered bitterly from criticism\r\nof his own wife.\r\n\r\nBut the most famous person who lies buried in Oak Hill is the man whose\r\nsong is known in every hamlet of this broad land: John Howard Payne, the\r\nauthor of \"Home, Sweet Home.\" He had been in Georgetown in his youth,\r\nyou remember, for he accompanied General Lingan on that trip to\r\nBaltimore from which the General never returned but to his funeral. Mr.\r\nPayne was then a young man of twenty-one and excited over the adventure,\r\nI suppose, like any one of that age. He was sent in later life as a\r\nconsul to one of those little states on the northern coast of Africa\r\nwhich in those days made so much trouble for the United States. There he\r\ndied and was buried. Years later his body was brought back by Mr.\r\nCorcoran, and there was quite a ceremony for his re-interment.\r\n\r\nThe stone placed over him in that distant land and brought back with his\r\nbody has the seal of the United States carved at the top and reads:\r\n\r\n    IN MEMORY\r\n    OF\r\n    COL. JOHN HOWARD PAYNE\r\n    TWICE CONSUL OF\r\n    THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\r\n    FOR\r\n    THE CITY AND KINGDOM OF TUNIS\r\n    THIS STONE IS PLACED\r\n    BY A GRATEFUL COUNTRY\r\n    HE DIED AT THE AMERICAN CONSULATE\r\n    IN THIS CITY AFTER A TEDIOUS ILLNESS\r\n    APRIL 1, 1852\r\n    HE WAS BORN AT THE CITY OF BOSTON\r\n    STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n    JUNE 8, 1792\r\n    HIS FAME AS A POET AND DRAMATIST\r\n    IS WELL KNOWN WHEREVER THE ENGLISH\r\n    LANGUAGE IS SPOKEN THROUGH\r\n    HIS CELEBRATED BALLAD OF\r\n    HOME, SWEET HOME\r\n    AND HIS POPULAR TRAGEDY\r\n    OF BRUTUS AND OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTIONS\r\n\r\nThis slab lies flat upon the ground. Adjoining it is a circle in the\r\ncenter of which is a monument bearing a bust of Colonel Payne, and on it\r\nis the following inscription:\r\n\r\n    IN\r\n    MEMORY OF\r\n    JOHN HOWARD PAYNE\r\n    AUTHOR\r\n    OF\r\n    HOME, SWEET HOME\r\n    BORN JUNE 9, 1791\r\n    DIED APRIL 9, 1852\r\n    ERECTED ANNO DOMINI 1883\r\n\r\n    \"Sure when thy gentle spirit fled\r\n    To realms beyond the azure dome\r\n    With arms outstretched, God's angel said\r\n    'Welcome to Heaven's Home, Sweet Home.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n    BALCH, THOMAS BLOOMER: _Reminiscences of Georgetown_.\r\n\r\n    BRYAN, W.
