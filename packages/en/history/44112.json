It was taken for granted that the\r\nstudent would be familiar with the underlying principles of Spanish\r\ngrammar before taking up this book; and yet, grammatical explanations\r\nhave been given wherever they were deemed necessary, and translations of\r\ndifficult passages have been suggested. The Introduction gives a brief\r\nhistorical sketch of Argentina, which will furnish a background on which\r\nto locate the specific events related in the book. Considerable detailed\r\ninformation concerning the authors represented and the institutions and\r\ncustoms of Argentina and her people will be found in the Biographical\r\nNotes and in the annotations to the selections.\r\n\r\nIf the book succeeds in arousing a sympathetic interest in the struggles\r\nfor Argentine independence and her subsequent progress, the editors will\r\nfeel more than repaid. Upon that sympathetic interest must rest the ever\r\ngrowing Pan-American ideal to bring both Americas closer to each other.\r\n\r\nThe editors gratefully acknowledge their obligation to the Pan-American\r\nUnion, Washington, D.C., to The Hispanic Society of America, New York,\r\nand to Doubleday, Page & Co., New York, for their courtesy in permitting\r\nthe reprinting of the article on the _Congreso de Tucumán_, taken from\r\nthe July, 1916, number of _La Revista del Mundo_. To their colleague,\r\nMr. Julian Moreno-Lacalle, the editors are sincerely grateful for\r\nvaluable suggestions and for many kindnesses, which have made the work\r\neasier to accomplish. Thanks also are due to Professor F. B. Luquiens\r\n(of Yale), Messrs. H. K. Stone (of Grinnell College, Iowa), O. d'Amato\r\n(of the University of Illinois), and J.

Argentina, as the most prosperous of the\r\nSouth American republics, has claimed no small share of this newly\r\nawakened interest. It is hoped that this book will aid in promoting and\r\nstrengthening this interest, and that this introduction, in its turn,\r\nwill be of aid in elucidating and furnishing a proper background for the\r\nmaterial herein presented.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to understand Argentina, we must begin first of all by\r\nfamiliarizing ourselves with one pivotal sentiment that has permeated\r\nand controlled every aspect of Argentine life and development since\r\ncolonial days. This sentiment is an exalted and haughty patriotism, so\r\nintense, indeed, that the tone with which an Argentine says \"_Soy\r\nargentino_\", is no whit less assertive and proud than that in which\r\ncitizens of ancient Rome were wont to say \"_Civis Romanus sum_\".\r\n\r\nWhatever the origin of this sentiment, the evidences of it are\r\nirrefutable. Argentina has to-day about nine million inhabitants: of\r\nthese, fully two thirds are of recent foreign origin, mainly Italian and\r\nSpanish, and to a much smaller extent, English, French, and German.\r\nArgentina, in other words, has relatively a much larger population of\r\nrecent foreign extraction than the United States. Nevertheless, the\r\nhyphen does not exist in Argentina; and the terms Italo-Argentine,\r\nHispano-Argentine, Franco-Argentine, etc., are entirely unknown. The\r\njealous and uncompromising patriotism of the Argentine makes hyphenated\r\nnational designations impossible. If we turn from the evidence of purely\r\npopular sentiment to the more sober and more controlled evidence of\r\nliterature, we find the same thing. Take away from the literature of\r\nArgentina the theme of patriotism, and you have taken away its most\r\ndistinctive and its greatest life-giving element. It has been said, and\r\njustly, that the Italian literature of the nineteenth century centered\r\nentirely about the theme of Italian unification, voicing during the\r\nfirst half of the century the aspirations of her great men for a united\r\nItaly, and during the second half intoning the pæan of joy at the\r\naccomplishment of those aspirations. The same may be said of Argentine\r\nliterature. The names of the great leaders of her immortal Revolution,\r\nboth against the mother country and later against the internal\r\n_caudillo_ tyrants--the most important of whom was Rosas--and the deeds\r\nthat they performed, recur again and again through the pages of her men\r\nof letters, whatever be the form of literature they engage in,\r\nnarrative, dramatic, or poetic.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that for the proper understanding of the Argentine\r\ntemperament, as evidenced by her literature as well as by her popular\r\nideals, the knowledge of her political history, beginning with the time\r\nof the English invasions in 1806 (when the latent nationalism of the\r\nthen Viceroyalty of the Plata first manifested itself in action), is a\r\nrequisite of prime importance.\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1776, Argentina had been but a negligible part of the\r\nSpanish possessions in South America, being a dependency of the\r\nViceroyalty of Peru. Despite, however, the short-sighted commercial\r\npolicy of Spain, which forbade the colonies from trading with any\r\nEuropean country, save the mother country, and then by restricted routes\r\nand through specific Spanish ports, Buenos Aires, towards the end of the\r\neighteenth century, had far outstripped all other colonial cities with\r\nthe exception of Lima. By royal decree, therefore, on the 8th of August,\r\n1776, the Viceroyalty of the Plata River was established with Buenos\r\nAires as its capital. It included what is to-day Argentina, Uruguay,\r\nParaguay, Bolivia, and the province of Rio Grande, belonging now to\r\nBrazil.\r\n\r\nThe first Viceroy was Don Pedro de Ceballos, a soldier of ability and an\r\nadministrator of unusual talent. As a result of the war he waged against\r\nthe Portuguese, who had taken possession of northern Uruguay and the\r\nharbor of La Colonia, this port was won back to the Viceroyalty of the\r\nPlata. It may be said that the driving out of the Portuguese from La\r\nColonia marks the first of a series of events that finally led to the\r\nindependence of Argentina; for, if Buenos Aires had been able to grow\r\ncommercially, it had been due, in no small measure, to the clandestine\r\ntrade that was carried on through the port of La Colonia. Its capture\r\nforced the Viceroy to assume a very grave responsibility; namely, to\r\nchange on his own authority the trade regulations then in force. His\r\npermission to allow certain foreign merchandise to come into Buenos\r\nAires, an act which was later approved by the Crown, was the first\r\nrecognition of the needs of the new Viceroyalty, as well as of the\r\npressure that the colonists could bring to bear upon the mother country.\r\n\r\nOf the Viceroys that followed Ceballos till the period of the English\r\ninvasions, there is but one that deserves to be recalled here. He was\r\nDon Juan José de Vértiz, under whose administration still greater\r\ncommercial freedom was granted to Buenos Aires. To take the place of the\r\nschools of the Jesuits, who were at this time expelled from Spain and\r\nthe colonies, Vértiz founded in Buenos Aires the Colegio de San Carlos.\r\nIt was also during his administration that the famous brothers Biedma\r\nexplored Patagonia, and that the settlement of this immense region was\r\nbegun, forestalling thus the plans contemplated by the English as a\r\nresult of the voyages of Thomas Falkner.\r\n\r\nThe decay into which Spain had fallen towards the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century, and the rule of the seas that England gained as a\r\nresult of the battle of Trafalgar (1805), led the English to attempt the\r\nconquest of the Viceroyalty of the Plata, of whose great possibilities\r\nFalkner, upon his return to England, had given a glowing account. Sir\r\nHome Popham, therefore, who had coöperated with Sir David Baird in the\r\noccupation of the Cape, put 1635 men under the orders of General W.\r\nBeresford for the purpose of capturing Buenos Aires. The English\r\nexpedition landed at Quilmes, not far from Buenos Aires, the 25th of\r\nJune, 1806. The Viceroy at that time was Don Rafael de Sobremonte, one\r\nof the weakest men who had occupied that important office since the\r\nestablishment of the Viceroyalty of the Plata. Instead of leading the\r\ncolonies against the invader, he fled to the interior with whatever\r\nmoneys he was able to gather from the treasury. Under these\r\ncircumstances the English force, small as it was, easily took possession\r\nof Buenos Aires. Meanwhile, the people under the leadership of Don\r\nSantiago de Liniers and Don Juan Martín Pueyrredón, prepared to drive\r\nout the invader, and it was not long before Liniers, with the aid of\r\nforces from Montevideo, and Pueyrredón, with forces hastily raised in\r\nthe province, forced Beresford to surrender unconditionally. In\r\nrecognition of the valor and ability displayed by Liniers, the people\r\nchose him as their leader, forcing Sobremonte to surrender his power.\r\nThis was the second time that the colonists imposed their will; the time\r\nwas not distant when they should do so forever.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1807, another British expedition, composed of 12,000 soldiers,\r\nunder General Whitelock, attempted to reconquer Buenos Aires. But\r\nLiniers was fully prepared to meet the new and increased forces sent to\r\ntake possession of the colony. In less than a year he had been able to\r\nreorganize the scanty and demoralized forces that protected the capital.\r\nWhitelock, having effected a landing, marched upon Buenos Aires; but\r\nafter much fierce street fighting, in which women and children took\r\npart, he was forced to capitulate with the loss of over 3000 of his\r\neffectives. The heroism of the people of Buenos Aires on this occasion\r\nis well attested by the testimony of Whitelock himself, who said: \"Each\r\nhome was a castle, and each soldier a hero.\"\r\n\r\nThese signal victories, which the colonists were able to obtain without\r\nany aid from the home government, coupled with their ancient\r\ndissatisfaction over the trade restrictions forced upon Buenos Aires,\r\nhad a double effect: first, they inspired the colonists with a new sense\r\nof self-reliance and confidence; secondly, they heightened the old\r\ndiscontent, and gave rise to thoughts of independence. When, therefore,\r\nNapoleon, in 1810, dethroned Ferdinand VII, and crowned his own brother\r\nJoseph King of Spain, the occasion presented itself for the colonists to\r\ntranslate those sentiments of dissatisfaction into actual revolt.\r\n\r\nLiniers was at this time Viceroy, the choice of the people having\r\nreceived the official sanction of the royal government. As a Frenchman,\r\nhowever, he was distrusted, and in his place Don Baltasar Cisneros was\r\nappointed in July, 1809. One of his first acts, the throwing open of the\r\ncommerce of the Viceroyalty to all nations, quieted for a while the\r\ngeneral discontent, and gained for the new Viceroy a certain measure of\r\npopularity. But his harshness in repressing an outbreak that took place\r\nin La Paz (Bolivia), in February of 1810, lost him at once the prestige\r\nhe had at first won.\r\n\r\nThe minds of the multitude were irrevocably bent on separation; men like\r\nBelgrano, Castelli, Chiclana, Paso, Rodríguez Peña, were secretly\r\nworking for the independence of the provinces. On the 25th of May,\r\n1810, after news had been received of the complete subjugation of Spain,\r\nthe people _en masse_ demanded the deposition of Cisneros, and a\r\ncommittee presided over by Cornelio Saavedra was appointed to take the\r\nreins of government. Castelli, Belgrano, Azcuénaga, Alberti, Matheu y\r\nLarra, were the other members of this Junta, and Paso and Moreno were\r\nits secretaries. Thus the change in government was carried out, in form\r\nat least, by a mass meeting of the population of Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EL 25 DE MAYO DE 1810\r\n\r\n_Navarro y Lamarca_ _Fortuny_\r\n\r\n_Historia general de América_]\r\n\r\nThe task of the newly established government was indeed an arduous one;\r\nfor, not only did it have to defend its authority against Spain, but\r\nalso to make its power felt and obeyed by the provinces of the interior.\r\nThe first task was accomplished when the Spaniards were finally driven\r\nfrom South America; the carrying out of the second task brought on a\r\nsecond revolution, a fratricidal strife, which came very near\r\nestablishing in Argentina a number of petty and insignificant states\r\ninstead of a united, strong nation. In this second struggle, though in\r\nprinciple the battle was lost for Buenos Aires (since the federal form\r\nof government is the one that obtains to-day in Argentina), the\r\nleadership of the capital remained unquestionably established so far as\r\ninitiative and spiritual ascendancy are concerned.\r\n\r\nBuenos Aires set out, as Rome had done, to expand politically from a\r\ncity-state into a vast republican state. She partly failed in this, as\r\nis evidenced by the withdrawal of Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia from\r\nthe old Viceroyalty of the Plata, but, as we have said, she succeeded in\r\nestablishing, if not the political hegemony of the Plata, the undisputed\r\nspiritual leadership, and the proud claim of being the second largest\r\nand wealthiest Latin city in the world, and the greatest in all the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nWe shall attempt to trace briefly: first, the steps by which the\r\nSpaniards were expelled from the South American countries; second, the\r\nsteps by which the provinces of the Plata emerged from the chaos of\r\ncivil strife, and came, after the battle of Pavón, to enjoy the sweet\r\nfruits of peace.\r\n\r\nAfter the deposition of Cisneros, the provisional Junta sent out\r\ncirculars to the provinces, asking for their recognition of its\r\nauthority. The provinces, save Uruguay and Paraguay, signified their\r\nsupport of the new government. From the very beginning, then, these two\r\nprovinces showed a tendency not to accept the leadership of Buenos\r\nAires. Furthermore, not long thereafter, when it became known that the\r\nJunta aimed at separation, the province of Córdoba and those of Alto\r\nPerú (Bolivia) joined with Uruguay and Paraguay in their opposition to\r\nthe provisional government. The \"Tory\" reaction was thus not long in\r\nmanifesting itself.\r\n\r\nMontevideo, led by the newly appointed Viceroy, Javier de Elío, made\r\nready a fleet to attack Buenos Aires; Gutiérrez de la Concha, Governor\r\nof Córdoba, appointed Liniers to lead its forces against the Junta; and\r\nin Alto Perú, General Goyeneche, appointed president of Cuzco by the\r\nViceroy of Peru, took charge of the resistance to the Revolution. The\r\ngravity of the reaction that set in, the increasing number of forces\r\nthat were being arrayed against the new government, demanded firm and\r\ninstant action. Happily for the independence of Argentina, there was in\r\nthe Junta a leader of force and vision. He was Mariano Moreno, the\r\nsecretary of the Junta; he was the soul of the revolutionary movement in\r\nits early stages; he was the pilot that steered it safely through the\r\nperilous shoals of the dawn of independence. It is in recognition of\r\nthese great services that Argentina acclaims him to-day as one of her\r\ngreatest champions, ranking with San Martín, Belgrano, and Rivadavia.\r\n\r\nTo meet these dangers, two expeditions were sent out: one against\r\nCórdoba and Alto Perú, under the orders of Ortiz de Ocampo; and another\r\nagainst Paraguay, under the orders of General Belgrano.\r\n\r\nLiniers and Concha were taken prisoners, and by order of the Junta were\r\nput to death. Thus died Santiago de Liniers, defender of Buenos Aires\r\nduring the English invasions. Many historians and writers have denounced\r\nthis act of the Junta as ruthless and unnecessarily severe; practically\r\nas many others have defended it in view of the inexorable need for\r\nsternness demanded by the conditions of the times. We mention it as the\r\nfirst instance of internecine struggle, and as typical of the\r\nunrelenting character of the Revolution that came later. The expedition\r\ncontinued its northward march, under the orders of Balcarce, and\r\ndefeating the Royalists at Suipacha, soon had control of the north as\r\nfar as the Desaguadero, the boundary between the Viceroyalties of Peru\r\nand of the Plata. Here we shall leave it for a while in order to follow\r\nthe campaign against Paraguay.\r\n\r\nHeartened by the successes of Balcarce, the Junta decided to hasten the\r\nexpedition against Paraguay under the orders of Belgrano. But, whereas\r\nthe expeditionary force of Alto Perú had met until then with remarkable\r\nsuccess, Belgrano, after having his communications impeded by the\r\ncontrol of the Paraná, which the Royalists held, and taking part in two\r\nunsuccessful engagements, was glad to sign an agreement whereby he was\r\nallowed to withdraw unmolested from Paraguay with all his forces. Though\r\nthis expedition failed of its purpose to bring Paraguay under the\r\ncontrol of the Junta, it helped in no small degree to create a\r\nseparatist movement in Paraguay which led in a few years to the defeat\r\nof the Spaniards and the establishment of an independent government.\r\n\r\nBy this time also the situation in Uruguay called for the attention of\r\nthe Junta. The people of the country, despite the pro-Spanish sentiment\r\nprevalent in Montevideo, were manifesting signs of revolt against the\r\nSpaniards, and when Artigas, the Uruguayan leader, came to Buenos Aires\r\nto enlist the aid of the provisional government, the forces of Belgrano\r\nthat had returned from Paraguay were intrusted to Rondeau to coöperate\r\nwith Artigas in Uruguay. With the aid of these troops from Buenos Aires,\r\nArtigas obtained a signal victory against the Spaniards at Las Piedras,\r\nwhich enabled him to lay siege to Montevideo.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Belgrano's expedition to Paraguay, which, though\r\nunsuccessful in its attempt to bring that province under the control of\r\nthe Junta, had nevertheless caused no serious military loss, the forces\r\nof the Revolution were everywhere successful. Unfortunately, the\r\nstinging defeat of Huaquí that the army of Alto Perú met at the hands of\r\nGoyeneche in 1811, on the boundary between Bolivia and Peru, threatened\r\nfor a moment to reëstablish the power of Spain. Had the Argentine forces\r\nbeen successful, Bolivia and Uruguay would never have become separate\r\nrepublics. The complete independence of South America would have been\r\nattained ten years before the battle of Ayacucho (1824), and, very\r\nlikely, with its victorious armies, Buenos Aires would have been able to\r\navoid the terrible civil struggle that, through the lack of a wise and\r\nstrong central government, lasted till the downfall of Rosas. As it was,\r\nthe siege of Montevideo had to be abandoned at a time when its garrison\r\nwas on the point of surrendering; and it was only through the energetic\r\nand skillful leadership of Pueyrredón, who was put in command after\r\nHuaquí, that of the 23,000 men who composed the original Army of the\r\nNorth, one thousand succeeded in reaching Tucumán. From a purely\r\nmilitary point of view, the disaster of Huaquí meant the passing of the\r\ninitiative from the revolutionary Army to the forces of Spain. In fact,\r\nnot until 1817, when San Martín crossed the Andes and defeated the\r\nRoyalists in Chile, were the provinces once more on the offensive. It\r\nmeant also that the way for a _decisive_ blow at the Spaniards through\r\nthe north was forever barred; that the attack had to be carried through\r\nthe west to Chile, first, and then by sea to the heart of Spanish power\r\nin Lima; that while troops were being prepared slowly and patiently for\r\nthis purpose, the constant pressure of the victorious Spanish armies\r\nfrom the north had to be withstood; and last, but by no means least, it\r\nemphasized the need for the presence of a strong man to bolster up the\r\nprovisional government in Buenos Aires itself, which, after the death of\r\nMariano Moreno, was left without a leader of ability and strength\r\ncommensurate with the magnitude of the task to be accomplished.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the independence of the provinces of the Plata, there\r\narose, at this critical juncture, men like Belgrano, who by his\r\nvictories of Tucumán and Salta, stemmed the flood of Spanish invasion\r\nafter Huaquí; San Martín, who by his conquest of Chile and Lima, was to\r\nforce the Spaniards into the fastnesses of the mountains of Peru, where\r\nhis veteran troops, delivered by one of the greatest acts of self-denial\r\nin the record of history into the hands of Bolívar, sounded the knell of\r\nSpanish dominion on the battlefields of Junín and Ayacucho; Güemes, who\r\nafter the battle of Sipe-Sipe, a disaster comparable only to Huaquí,\r\nwas able, with the aid of his intrepid _gauchos_, to protect the\r\ncommunications of the army that was being prepared by San Martín in\r\nMendoza; Rivadavia and Pueyrredón, without the stimulus of whose\r\nleadership the provisional government would have succumbed under the\r\nweight of the responsibilities it had assumed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BELGRANO EN TUCUMÁN\r\n\r\n_Navarro y Lamarca, Historia general de América_\r\n\r\n_Fortuny_]\r\n\r\nImmediately after the victory of Tucumán, obtained by Belgrano against\r\nthe Spanish forces that invaded northern Argentina after the defeat of\r\nHuaquí, the siege of Montevideo was begun once more, both as a result of\r\nthat victory and of negotiations with Brazil, whereby the troops of that\r\nempire, which had come to the aid of the Spaniards, were to withdraw\r\nfrom Uruguay. The patriots were soon able, in spite of the friction\r\nthat arose between Artigas and the Argentine troops, to pin the Spanish\r\nforces within the inner circle of the defenses of Montevideo. It was in\r\nconnection with this campaign against Montevideo that San Martín in 1813\r\nwon his first victory against the Spaniards, at San Lorenzo, on the\r\nshores of the Paraná. By this victory an end was put to the foraging\r\nexpeditions that the beleaguered garrison of Montevideo sent to the\r\nprovince of Entre Ríos. Thus the only immediate avenue for the supplying\r\nof provisions was closed. The desertion, however, of Artigas, and the\r\nharassing by his Uruguayan bands of the besieging forces, threatened\r\nonce more to bring about the abandonment of the siege. The defeat of the\r\nnaval forces of Spain in the Plata River by Admiral Brown, an Irish\r\nsailor in the service of the government of Buenos Aires, came at this\r\ntime most opportunely to close _all_ avenues of replenishing, and the\r\ngarrison was forced to capitulate. The taking of Montevideo was an event\r\nof the utmost importance for the Revolution, since it made possible the\r\nconcentrating of all forces for an attack upon Peru, the heart of\r\nSpanish power in South America.\r\n\r\nUndeterred by the disastrous results of the first Army of the North at\r\nHuaquí, the provisional government decided upon a second expedition to\r\nAlto Perú. In addition to the strategic difficulties of this plan, new\r\nobstacles arose from the jealousies and ill-feeling caused by the\r\nambition of General Alvear. He has truly been called the Alcibiades of\r\nArgentina. Handsome, young, accomplished, and erratically brilliant in\r\nthe conception of his military plans, he was consumed by a\r\ndisproportionate ambition to be the leading military hero of the\r\nRevolution. It was in order to satisfy this inordinate craving for glory\r\nthat he had himself appointed general-in-chief of the besieging forces\r\nof Montevideo, at a moment when that city was doomed to fall, thus\r\ndepriving Rondeau of a victory which in reality was his. As in the case\r\nof the campaign of Montevideo, Rondeau was first selected to command the\r\nsecond Army of the North, but Alvear intended to keep him in command\r\nonly until the time should come for decisive action, when he himself,\r\naided by the ascendancy he had gained with the provisional government,\r\nwould assume command and reap the fruits of victory. In accordance with\r\nthis plan, he attempted to supplant Rondeau towards the end of the year\r\n1814. This time, however, Rondeau refused to deliver his command to\r\nAlvear, and, as his troops supported him, Alvear was forced to return to\r\nBuenos Aires. The great popularity that he enjoyed in the capital raised\r\nhim to the supreme honor of Director of the United Provinces, but his\r\nharshness in dealing with opposing political parties, and his weakness\r\nin meeting the rebellion of Artigas, combined with the opposition of\r\nboth the Army of the North and the army that San Martín was quietly\r\ngetting together in Mendoza for the invasion of Chile, made his tenure\r\nof office very short-lived, and he was forced to surrender the reins of\r\ngovernment and flee to Río Janeiro. This was the first serious defection\r\namong the makers of the Revolution, if we except the work of the\r\nUruguayan leader, Artigas, who by his constant opposition to the\r\nprovisional government of Buenos Aires delayed and prevented the\r\nunification of forces necessary to bring about the fall of Spanish\r\npower, but who at least worked for the independence of Uruguay, whereas\r\nAlvear sought primarily to aggrandize himself. It was not surprising\r\ntherefore that the Army of the North, its discipline shaken by the\r\nrecent rebellion caused by Alvear's ambition, and confronted, as it was,\r\nby the naturally difficult task of attacking Peru by a road which had\r\nbeen marked by the previous defeat of Huaquí, met a second disastrous\r\ndefeat at Sipe-Sipe. So complete was this defeat that the Army of the\r\nNorth ceased to exist entirely, never to be reorganized again as it had\r\nbeen after Huaquí. What Belgrano did for the defense of the provinces\r\nafter the defeat of the first Army of the North, the _caudillo_ Güemes\r\naccomplished after Sipe-Sipe. With his swift band of _gauchos_ he\r\nconducted such an effective guerrilla warfare against the victorious\r\nSpanish army, that they were unable to derive the full benefit of their\r\ngreat victory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA BAHÍA DE MONTEVIDEO EN 1825\r\n\r\n_Navarro y Lamarca, Historia general de America_]\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of the Revolution had never sunk so low as after the battle\r\nof Sipe-Sipe. Yet, it was immediately after this disaster that the\r\nCongress of Tucumán, on the 9th of July, 1816, proclaimed officially the\r\nindependence of the United Provinces of the Plata. This was an\r\nartificial way of reviving the hopes of the Revolution, for what was\r\nwanted then was action, not words. Withal it did serve to rouse the\r\nfailing enthusiasm of the people. Moreover, to substantiate the\r\nrhetorical enthusiasm of the Declaration of Independence, there soon\r\ncame from an unexpected quarter deeds of such magnitude as to destroy\r\nfor all time the power of Spain in America.\r\n\r\nA few months after the meeting of the Congress of Tucumán, San Martín\r\nstarted on his great liberating campaign of Chile, after more than two\r\nyears of patient preparation. Left to his own resources in the province\r\nof Cuyo (to-day, Mendoza, San Luis, and San Juan), unaided for a long\r\ntime by the central government, who saw in him only a mediocre soldier\r\n(mistaking his modesty, his stoic disregard for the glamour of\r\npopularity, and above all his stanch insistence on systematic and\r\ncareful preparation, for lack of military genius and dash), San Martín\r\nnever lost heart, but bided his time till the rise to power in Buenos\r\nAires of Pueyrredón assured him of support. On the 17th of January,\r\n1817, the Army of the Andes set out by the now historic passes of Los\r\nPatos and Uspallata on the expedition which was to win for democracy\r\nhalf a continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EL PASO DE LOS ANDES\r\n\r\n_Navarro y Lamarca, Historia general de América Fortuny_]\r\n\r\nThe crossing of the snow-capped Andes was rapidly and successfully\r\naccomplished, and on the 12th of February, 1817, the Spanish Army,\r\ncommanded by General Maroto, was completely defeated on the slopes of\r\nChacabuco, not far from Santiago. Maroto himself was captured, and San\r\nMartín entered Santiago de Chile with his army on the 14th of February.\r\nMeantime, the remaining Spanish forces fled to Talcahuano, where,\r\nhaving been reënforced by 3000 fresh troops from Peru, they attacked the\r\ndetachment under Las Heras that San Martín had sent in their pursuit.\r\nThe siege of Talcahuano had to be raised, and Las Heras withdrew in 1818\r\nto join the corps of the main army. On the 19th of March, San Martín was\r\nagain closely pressing the enemy, and after a cavalry skirmish the\r\nSpaniards sought the protection of the city of Talca. The Argentine\r\nforces encamped outside of the city, and the Spaniards, surprising the\r\npatriots at night, charged their bivouac, dispersing and killing many of\r\nthe patriot troops. This night attack is known as the battle of Cancha\r\nRayada. It came very close to wrecking the long-prepared and carefully\r\nthought-out plans of San Martín. His coolness and the indomitable\r\ncourage of his generals, particularly Las Heras, saved the day, and\r\nhardly two weeks later, on the 5th of April, he was able to meet the\r\nSpaniards on the shores of the River Maipú or Maipo, defeating them\r\ndecisively, and sealing forever the independence of Chile.\r\n\r\nNow, San Martín was able to carry out his long-cherished plan of\r\nattacking Peru from the Chilean side, transporting his army by water to\r\nPisco. With the aid of Lord Thomas Cochrane, an English sailor in the\r\nservice of Chile, he was able to clear the seas of Spanish ships, and on\r\nthe 7th of September, 1820, he landed his forces in the Bay of Paracas.\r\nSan Martín drove the Spaniards before him, and Lima and Callao were\r\ncaptured in quick succession. The former was evacuated by La Serna,\r\nSpanish viceroy of Peru, the 19th of July, 1821, and Callao was\r\nsurrendered on the 21st of September of the same year. Once in Lima, the\r\nfirst thing that San Martín did was to call together an assembly to find\r\nout the wishes of the people of Peru. The Junta met and notified the\r\nProtector, the title given to San Martín by the Peruvians, that the\r\nunanimous wish of all was the independence of Peru. At a great\r\ndemonstration, held in the Plaza Mayor of Lima, San Martín rose before\r\nthe assembled multitude and unfolding for the first time the national\r\nflag of Peru, created by San Martín himself, he exclaimed amid the\r\nthunderous applause of the people: \"Peru is from this moment free and\r\nindependent, by the will of its people and the justness of its cause,\r\nwhich God defends.\"\r\n\r\nSan Martín had insured the independence of Argentina, which then\r\nincluded Bolivia, had driven the Spaniards from Chile, and now declared\r\nthe independence of Peru. But the last remnants of the Spanish forces\r\nthat had fled to the mountains of northern Peru had still to be\r\nvanquished before his task could be said to be fully accomplished. As\r\nthe Argentine historian Mitre says, San Martín might have attempted this\r\ntask with the forces at his command, unaided by either Chile or\r\nArgentina, which were then in the throes of civil discord, but he had\r\ntoo much at heart the independence of those lands in whose cause he had\r\nbeen fighting for over ten years. He preferred to take no chances. He\r\ninvoked the coöperation of Simón Bolívar, who had done for Colombia and\r\nVenezuela what he himself had done for Argentina, Chile, and Peru. On\r\nthe 26th of July, 1822, therefore, there took place at Guayaquil,\r\nEcuador, a famous interview between the two greatest generals of South\r\nAmerica. What took place at that meeting has been wrapped in mystery,\r\nthough the results are known full well. San Martín delivered his armies\r\ninto Bolívar's hands, so that he might strike the last blow in behalf of\r\nthe independence of South America. The combined forces of Colombia and\r\nArgentina under the command of General Sucre, Bolívar's lieutenant, won\r\na brilliant victory at Ayacucho in 1824, which crowned once for all the\r\nefforts of the peoples of South America to obtain their independence.\r\n\r\nThus, first by the military prowess of her greatest son, San Martín, and\r\nlater by his greatness of soul and self-denial, worthy of the best\r\ntraditions of Rome, Argentina insured the independence of South America.\r\nThough the words exchanged between Bolívar and San Martín at Guayaquil\r\nare not known, acquainted as we are with the natures of both, we can\r\neasily surmise what took place. Bolívar was a brilliant military genius,\r\nbut like Alvear, was consumed by an unquenchable thirst for power, save\r\nthat he surpassed Alvear in ambition in the same ratio that his military\r\nability was superior to that of the Argentine Alcibiades. San Martín was\r\na thorough military leader, leaving nothing to chance, a great\r\ndisciplinarian, and once his plans were completed, as powerful in their\r\nexecution as he had been patient in their preparation; but above all,\r\nSan Martín was preëminently a man of lofty ideals and high moral worth.\r\nHe may not have been endowed with the keen intuitive military genius of\r\nBolívar; he was averse to all dramatic appeal and display, and hence\r\nnever became popular in the sense that Bolívar and Alvear were popular;\r\nbut in the unselfish qualities of devotion to a cause, even to the point\r\nof self-effacement, he stands the equal of the greatest men in history,\r\na worthy peer of Cincinnatus and Regulus.\r\n\r\nAfter the conference with Bolívar in Guayaquil, San Martín returned to\r\nPeru to find that the people whose independence he had declared were\r\nhostile to him. He immediately called a meeting of the constitutional\r\ncongress, and, on the 20th of September, 1822, resigned his title of\r\nProtector.\r\n\r\nComing to Chile, he met with equal, if not greater, hostility. He\r\nretired to the province of Mendoza in Argentina, where for a while he\r\ndevoted himself to farming, and then made a voyage to Buenos Aires, then\r\ntorn by contending factions, to meet there, in his own country, with\r\nindifference and disregard. San Martín clearly saw that despite his\r\ndevotion to the cause of independence, despite his mighty\r\naccomplishments in behalf of his country, his presence, if anything,\r\nwould only lead to greater strife. Stoically, therefore, and without a\r\nmurmur, he betook himself to voluntary exile in France, where he died in\r\npoverty, in 1850, forgotten by his countrymen, attended only by his\r\ndaughter, who faithfully remained by his side throughout the long years\r\nof his exile. Once only, in 1829, he returned to Buenos Aires; but the\r\nnewspapers of the times published this insulting paragraph:\r\n\"Ambiguities--General San Martín has returned to his country after an\r\nabsence of five years, but only after knowing that peace has been\r\nsigned with the Emperor of Brazil.\" Even after this crowning insult San\r\nMartín uttered no plaint, but quietly returned to France to devote his\r\ntime to the cultivation of flowers of his native land. His was not the\r\nMarian temperament; no messenger was ever sent by him to his\r\nfellow-countrymen to tell them that their liberator had been seen in\r\nFrance eating the bitter bread of exile.\r\n\r\n\"A truly great man...\", Shakespeare has said of Cæsar. Much more aptly\r\ncould that apply to San Martín in point of pure manhood. Argentina,\r\nto-day, has made reparation for the oblivion with which she requited her\r\ngreatest man during his lifetime, by erecting imposing monuments to his\r\nmemory; but, above all, by enshrining his name in the heart of every one\r\nof her sons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut to return to Argentina herself: thanks to San Martín, the Revolution\r\nwas successful, both at home and abroad. Even as early as 1820, however,\r\nthe discordant elements that were to delay her progress almost half a\r\ncentury were clearly patent, not only in thought, but also in action.\r\nEach province had its _caudillo_, who was fiercely jealous of any\r\nlimitations upon his power. Thus, Ramírez in Entre Ríos, Güemes in\r\nSalta, Facundo Quiroga (known for his cruelty as \"El Tigre de los\r\nLlanos\") in La Rioja, López in Santa Fé, Ibarra in Santiago, were\r\npractically overlords of independent provinces, ready to make common\r\ncause against Spain, but just as ready to quarrel with each other. The\r\nsituation was similar to that of the colonies in North America, which,\r\nthough willing to unite against England, resented any attempt at\r\ninterference in their internal affairs by a central government. Buenos\r\nAires, the city, as the center of Argentine wealth, culture, and\r\ncivilization, was the exponent of a unitarian form of government, that\r\nis, a strong, centralized government with Buenos Aires at the head.\r\nNaturally, the _caudillos_ resented any interference on the part of\r\nBuenos Aires. In 1820, the first important battle between these two\r\nantagonistic elements took place at Cepeda, on the borders of Santa Fé\r\nand Buenos Aires. Here Rondeau, representing Buenos Aires and the\r\nunitarian principle, suffered defeat at the hands of Ramírez, known as\r\n\"El Supremo Entrerriano.\"\r\n\r\nVarying fortunes attended the civil strife which went on between these\r\ntwo factions. In 1822, a pact was entered upon by Buenos Aires and the\r\n_caudillos_ of Entre Ríos, Santa Fé, and Corrientes, by the terms of\r\nwhich common cause was to be made against an expected Spanish invasion,\r\nwhich never materialized, and the other provinces were to be urged to\r\njoin the Confederation.\r\n\r\nRivadavia now appears on the scene in Buenos Aires as Minister of\r\nEducation, and later, as President of the Confederation in 1826. He\r\nintroduced many noteworthy reforms, founded libraries and universities,\r\nand attempted to establish the government on a firm unitarian basis with\r\nBuenos Aires as the capital. He resigned in 1827, following the treaty\r\nwhich his envoy signed with Brazil in the same year, after the battle of\r\nItuzaingó. Despite the victory of Argentine arms, Uruguay had been ceded\r\nto Brazil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOS TREINTA Y TRES ORIENTALES\r\n\r\n_Navarro y Lamarca, Historia general de América Fortuny_]\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1680, Uruguay had been a bone of contention between\r\nPortugal and Spain, but at the outbreak of the Revolution in 1810, the\r\ncountry was Spanish and was an integral part of the Viceroyalty of the\r\nPlata. Montevideo became, as we have seen, the center of Spanish\r\nresistance to the movement of independence, and following Artigas'\r\nvictory at Las Piedras, was besieged by his troops and the Argentine\r\nforces under Rondeau. The city would have fallen, but news of the defeat\r\nat Huaquí reached Buenos Aires, and the besiegers were recalled to\r\nprotect the Argentine soil. Civil strife between Buenos Aires and\r\nArtigas ensued because the latter stood for a federal republic, while\r\nBuenos Aires, of course, was unitarian, and wished to retain her\r\nsupremacy over the provinces. In 1817, Artigas became embroiled with the\r\nPortuguese, who routed him and captured Montevideo. Rivera, Oribe, and\r\nLavalleja, lieutenants of Artigas, and later famous in the history of\r\nUruguay, had to take refuge in the interior. Artigas himself retired to\r\nParaguay and died there of old age in 1850. By 1821 all resistance to\r\nBrazil was at an end. Rivera and many of the other _caudillos_ had\r\naccepted commissions in the Brazilian army of occupation. Uruguay itself\r\nhad become the cisplatine province of Brazil, and so matters stood until\r\nthe 19th of April, 1825, when Lavalleja gathered the famous \"Treinta y\r\nTres\", a band of thirty-three Uruguayan patriots, and landed in Uruguay\r\nfrom the Argentine province of Entre Ríos. So great was their success\r\nthat by May of that year, the whole country was in revolt against the\r\nBrazilians, and the forces of the Empire were confined within\r\nMontevideo and La Colonia. The patriot victory at Sarandí under\r\nLavalleja and Rivera caused Argentina to declare formally that Uruguay\r\nwas again a part of the Argentine Confederation. War between Argentina\r\nand Brazil was declared and at Ituzaingó, far within the Brazilian\r\nterritory, the Brazilians suffered a terrible defeat in 1827. This, as\r\nwe saw above, happened during Rivadavia's presidency, and led to his\r\nresignation because of the peace signed by his envoy. The upshot of the\r\nwhole matter was that both Brazil and Argentina gave up all claims to\r\nUruguay and guaranteed its independence as a separate republic for five\r\nyears. Argentina was being torn by federalist and unitarian dissensions,\r\nand could not press her claim. In Uruguay itself there were rival\r\nfactions led by Rivera and Lavalleja, who held the presidency in turn,\r\nRivera becoming the first official head of the nation in 1830.\r\n\r\nIn Argentina, after Rivadavia's resignation, Dorrego, leader of the\r\nfederalists in Buenos Aires, became Director. The chief names until\r\n1829, date of the advent of Rosas, are La Paz and Lavalle, as\r\nunitarians; Dorrego and the _caudillos_ from the various provinces, as\r\nfederalists. Lavalle, who had been the hero of Ituzaingó, put himself at\r\nthe head of the unitarians and forced Dorrego to flee, capturing him\r\nlater and putting him to death. It is now that Rosas comes to the fore,\r\nalthough Quiroga and the other _caudillos_ all joined forces to help\r\ndefeat Lavalle, who retired to Uruguay. La Paz, however, more than\r\nmanaged to hold his own in the provinces of the interior, defeating\r\nQuiroga twice with terrific slaughter. But he, too, was finally defeated\r\nand taken prisoner in 1831. Since 1829, Rosas had become the provisional\r\ngovernor of Buenos Aires, that is, the head, in so far as there was any\r\nhead, of the Argentine government. One of his first acts as governor of\r\nBuenos Aires was to carry on an expedition against the Indians to the\r\nsouth of Buenos Aires, and extend the frontiers of the whites down to\r\nthe Río Negro.\r\n\r\nAnd now for a few words on Rosas himself. He is referred to as the\r\nArgentine tyrant and has been compared to Nero for his wanton cruelty.\r\nTrue it is that he committed many deeds of cruelty, yet the times and\r\nconditions in which he lived were such that stern measures were\r\nnecessary. He was of noble family and one of the wealthiest men in\r\nArgentina. From his own _estancias_ he could raise a cavalry corps of\r\n_gauchos_ and keep it in the field. He made it a point to afford shelter\r\nto outlaw _gauchos_, and gathered about him a band of adventurous\r\nspirits ready to dare anything. His victories against the Indians\r\nincreased his prestige, and in 1835 he was given supreme power by the\r\nLegislature in Buenos Aires. His control of the supreme power lasted\r\nuntil 1852. Immediately upon his assuming command, federalists were put\r\nin office everywhere instead of unitarians, who were forced to flee into\r\nexile. In the course of his long career, Rosas waged war for the\r\nre-annexation of Uruguay, which had become independent in 1827, after\r\nthe battle of Ituzaingó. He incurred the enmity of France and England,\r\nand had to put down many revolts against his power. Lavalle played an\r\nimportant part in one of these and met his death at the hands of Oribe,\r\nwho had aligned himself with Rosas. Throughout Rosas' reign, for such\r\nwas his administration, Argentine exiles kept alive the hope of\r\noverthrowing the tyrant. Sarmiento founded a newspaper, _El Progreso_,\r\nin Copiapó, Chile, which had for its object a campaign against Rosas. In\r\nit Sarmiento published for the first time in serial form his _Facundo_,\r\nselections from which are given in this book.\r\n\r\nRosas' attempt to re-annex Uruguay deserves special mention. The\r\nfive-year period of Uruguayan independence agreed upon by Argentina and\r\nBrazil had come to an end when Rosas came into power. Argentina was free\r\nto solicit the incorporation of Uruguay into the Argentine\r\nConfederation. Oribe, whom we remember as one of Artigas' lieutenants,\r\nhad become president of Uruguay after Rivera, and allied himself to\r\nRosas against the Rivera faction, which had the support of the Argentine\r\nunitarian exiles. Oribe had to abandon Montevideo, which fell into\r\nRivera's hands only to be besieged by Rosas and Oribe. The war that\r\nensued has been called the Great War. It lasted for eight years, from\r\n1843 to 1851, and the entire burden of the struggle centered around the\r\nsiege of Montevideo, one of the longest in history. During this long\r\neight-year siege, Montevideo received the help of many adventurers and\r\nlovers of liberty, as Rosas and Oribe were regarded as oppressors who\r\nsought to dominate a weaker country. Garibaldi, famous in Italian\r\nhistory, played a prominent part in the defense of the beleaguered city\r\nas leader of a famous foreign legion composed of Italians and Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nEventually Rosas brought about his own downfall. Although a federalist,\r\nhe slowly centralized all power in himself, thereby gaining the distrust\r\nof the other _caudillos_. Urquiza, the _caudillo_ from Entre Ríos, led\r\nthe revolt against Rosas, and at the battle of Caseros, in 1851,\r\ncompletely routed the forces of the tyrant. Flight was Rosas' only\r\nresource, and he took refuge, with his daughter Manuela, on board the\r\nEnglish frigate _Centaur_. He ended his days in England.\r\n\r\nBut not yet were discords at an end. The victor of Caseros convened a\r\nconstituent congress at Santa Fé, to which Buenos Aires failed to send\r\ndelegates, remaining a sovereign state in the same manner that Rhode\r\nIsland did when she refused to become a party to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States. Naturally, Urquiza became president, and the\r\nprovinces prospered under his administration. Such a situation, however,\r\ncould not endure for long.\r\n\r\nBuenos Aires chafed under certain customs restrictions on her exports to\r\nthe rest of the nation, and in 1859, under the leadership of Mitre,\r\nBuenos Aires attacked the confederation of provinces established by the\r\ncongress at Santa Fé. As in 1820, Cepeda again marked the defeat of\r\nBuenos Aires at the hands of the federalists, although Mitre managed to\r\nsave the army of Buenos Aires. With the mediation of Paraguay, a peace\r\nwas patched up between the warring elements. Buenos Aires became a\r\nmember of the Confederation, and her customs houses were put in the\r\ncontrol of the federal government, and in 1860, Derqui succeeded Urquiza\r\nas president. In the meanwhile, troubles in the province of San Luis led\r\nto friction once more between Buenos Aires and the federalists. The\r\nrupture became open when Buenos Aires sent deputies elected according to\r\nlocal law and not according to the Constitution, and sent them to the\r\ncongress convened by Derqui. Buenos Aires was declared in state of\r\nsiege, and at Pavón, in 1861, Mitre led the forces of the capital to\r\nvictory. The many wars had tired the nation, and all the provinces\r\nwillingly gave Mitre the power to convoke a congress to settle all\r\ndifferences. This congress met on the 2d of May, 1862, and it was agreed\r\nthat the city of Buenos Aires should be the seat of the federal\r\ngovernment, as well as of the province of Buenos Aires itself. The\r\nelection of Mitre to the presidency marked the beginning of a period of\r\nprosperity and solidarity for the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n=López y Planes= (=Vicente=), an Argentine poet, was born in Buenos Aires in\r\n1784. He served as a volunteer during the English invasions and wrote a\r\nrhymed chronicle of the events of that stirring period. In 1810 he was\r\nattached to the Army of the North as secretary to its general, Ortiz de\r\nOcampo, and took an active part in all the great movements of the\r\nRevolutionary Era. At the foundation of the University of Buenos Aires,\r\nhe became the organizer and director of classical studies. He was the\r\nfounder of the Bureau of Statistics and President of the Republic in\r\n1827. Until 1852 he was the president of the Supreme Court. After the\r\nbattle of Caseros, General Urquiza intrusted to him the organization of\r\na provisional government, and he became governor of the province of\r\nBuenos Aires. Though he is best known as the author of the Argentine\r\nNational Hymn, he is hardly less to be remembered for the many services\r\nhe rendered his country in various official capacities from the time of\r\nthe founding of the Republic to his death in 1856.\r\n\r\n=López= (=Vicente Fidel=), Argentine jurisconsult, writer, and orator, was\r\nborn in Buenos Aires in 1814. He was the son of the famous author of the\r\nArgentine National Hymn, López y Planes. Like many other Argentineans,\r\nhe left his country during Rosas' reign, returning in 1852 to devote\r\nhimself untiringly to the work of regeneration. Among his works are to\r\nbe found both purely literary and historical writings, such as: _La\r\nNovia del Hereje o la Inquisición_, his monumental work on the\r\n_Conquista_, an erudite and scientific work, and his _Tratado del\r\nDerecho Romano_. He also wrote a series of articles on the Argentine\r\nRevolution for the _Revista del Río de la Plata_. In 1874 he succeeded\r\nGutiérrez as president of the University of Buenos Aires. He died in\r\n1903 after a life devoted to the service of his country.\r\n\r\n=Sarmiento= (=Domingo F.=) was born in San Juan in 1811 of humble parents.\r\nHis father fought under San Martín in Chile. From early childhood he was\r\nleft to his own resources, and has very often been called the Lincoln of\r\nArgentina. His love of books, his keen habits of observation, and a\r\nbrilliant mind raised him from the humble position of clerk in a country\r\nstore to the presidency of the Republic. During Rosas' rule, he joined\r\nthe great army of Argentine refugees in Chile, founding schools there\r\nand taking an active part in the political life of the country as the\r\neditor of _El Mercurio_ and _El Nacional_, two important organs of the\r\npress. His first book was a primer, and his _El Monitor de las Escuelas_\r\nwas the first educational periodical in South America. In 1842 he\r\nfounded the first normal school on the Pacific coast, directing it for\r\nthree years. Through the pages of _El Progreso_ and _El Heraldo\r\nArgentino_ he carried on a tireless campaign against the tyrant Rosas.\r\nHis impetuous character and the violence of his attacks made him many\r\nenemies, and, on the advice of President Montt of Chile, he undertook a\r\nseries of travels through Europe, northern Africa, and the United\r\nStates. He became a great admirer of the institutions and government of\r\nthe United States, and particularly of the educational ideas of Horace\r\nMann, with whom he came into close contact. Together with Mitre he\r\nreturned to Argentina on the eve of the battle of Caseros, in which he\r\nfought under the orders of Urquiza. During the years that Buenos Aires\r\nwas separated from the rest of the Confederation, he was director of\r\npublic instruction. After the battle of Pavón, he was ambassador to\r\nChile and Peru, and later to the United States, where he wrote _Las\r\nEscuelas, base de la prosperidad de los Estados Unidos_, and published\r\nan educational review entitled _Ambas Américas_. Upon the completion of\r\nMitre's term of office in 1868, and while still an ambassador to the\r\nUnited States, he was elected to the presidency of Argentina. His\r\nadministration was free from civil discord, and he carried out great\r\nreforms that made for the prosperity and progress of Argentina. He is\r\nespecially remembered for the great impetus he gave to public education\r\nin Argentina. It can be said of him that he is one of Argentina's\r\ngreatest writers, and South America's greatest educator. Among his most\r\nimportant works are: _Facundo o Civilización y Barbarie_, _Recuerdos de\r\nProvincia_, _Ambas Américas_, and _Viajes en Europa, África y América_.\r\nHis death in 1888 was mourned all over South America, and was felt as a\r\ndistinct loss among intellectual circles the world over.\r\n\r\n=Bunge= (=Carlos Octavio=) is a very modern Argentine writer. Among his\r\nworks may be mentioned: _Nuestra América_, _Ensayo de Psicología\r\nIndividual y Social_, _La Novela de la Sangre_, _La Poesía Popular\r\nArgentina_, and _Nuestra Patria_, an anthology for use in the Argentine\r\nschools, containing, besides extracts from other Argentine authors,\r\nmany episodes written by Bunge himself. Of him, Blasco Ibáñez, in his\r\n_La Argentina y sus grandezas_, says: \"_Carlos Octavio Bunge es el más\r\nfecundo de los escritores jóvenes. Tiene un talento proteico que se\r\nejercita con facilidad en todos los géneros.... Ha escrito un cuento, =La\r\nSirena=, de una originalidad sólo comparable a la de Poë, y que basta\r\npara la reputación de un autor_.\" Bunge died May 22, 1918.\r\n\r\n=Gorriti= (=Manuela=), an Argentine writer of note, was born in Salta in\r\n1819. She was married to General Manuel Isidro Belzú, one time president\r\nof Bolivia. Her life was full of misfortunes, but she never ceased to\r\nwrite. She displays in her writings unusual power of imagination. In\r\n1865 her complete works appeared in Buenos Aires in two volumes,\r\nentitled _Sueños y Realidades_. In the later years of her life until\r\n1874, the date of her death, she devoted herself to education, being\r\ndirectress of a college in Lima.\r\n\r\n=Sastre= (=Marcos=), an Argentine educator and didactic author, was born in\r\nMontevideo in 1809. Among his more important works are _Anagnosia_,\r\n_Guía del Preceptor_, and specially, _El Temple Argentino_, a vivid and\r\ngraphic description of the enchanting islands of the Paraná, their\r\nscenery, flora, and fauna.\r\n\r\n=Gutiérrez= (=Juan María=) was born in Buenos Aires. He was a lawyer by\r\nprofession, but is best known for his writings. Like Sarmiento, he fled\r\nto Chile to escape the tyranny of Rosas, and devoted himself to\r\njournalism, public education, and the publication of didactic works. In\r\n1846 he was appointed director of the Naval Academy of Valparaíso,\r\nintroducing during his term very important reforms. From 1845 to 1849 he\r\nedited a collection of poems by José Joaquín Olmedo, another\r\ncollection, entitled _América Poética, El Arauco Domado_ by Pedro de\r\nOna, and textbooks such as _El Lector Americano_, _La Vida de Franklin_,\r\n_Elementos de Geometría_. He returned to Argentina in 1852, after Rosas'\r\ndefeat at the battle of Caseros, lending his efforts to the advancement\r\nof education, as he had done in Chile. He was appointed president of the\r\nUniversity of Buenos Aires, and entirely revised its obsolete curriculum\r\nand faculty. In addition to being one of Argentina's foremost educators,\r\nhe has the distinction of being her first literary critic of note. Among\r\nhis works on literary criticism may be mentioned the following:\r\n_Artículos Críticos y Literarios_ (1860); _Estudios Biográficos y\r\nCríticos sobre Algunos Poetas Sur Americanos Anteriores al Siglo XIX_\r\n(1865); _Apuntes Biográficos de Escritores, Oradores, y Hombres de\r\nEstado de la República Argentina_. His style is characterized by\r\ncorrectness and precision. In 1873 he was made president emeritus of the\r\nUniversity of Buenos Aires. He died the following year.\r\n\r\n=Lacasa= (=Pedro=) was born in Buenos Aires in 1810. Early in life he gave\r\nup his studies to devote himself to agriculture. When the revolution of\r\n1839 broke out, he took part in it, and rose to the rank of colonel. In\r\n1865 he took part in the war against Paraguay. He died in Jujuy in 1869.\r\nHis son, Pedro Lacasa, published in 1870 a volume containing his poems,\r\na biography of General Lavalle, and one of General Miguel Soler.\r\n\r\n=Mitre= (=Bartolomé=) was born in Buenos Aires in 1821. In 1838, when hardly\r\nseventeen years old, he became known as a soldier and poet by taking\r\npart in the siege of Montevideo as a captain, and by publishing a\r\ncollection of poems. In the second siege of Montevideo he rose to the\r\nrank of lieutenant-colonel. When the campaign in Uruguay was ended, he\r\nwent first to Bolivia and then to Chile, where he was editor of _El\r\nMercurio_. This was not his first experience in journalism, for he had\r\nalready been the director of _La Nueva Era_ and _El Nacional_ in\r\nMontevideo, and _La Época_ in Bolivia. His articles in _El Mercurio_\r\nwere a bitter attack against the government, and he was forced to leave\r\nthe country, living in Peru for a time. In 1852 he returned to Chile,\r\nbut, hearing of the revolt against the tyrant Rosas, he hastened back to\r\nhis native country, and took an active part in the battle of Caseros,\r\nbeing in command of the Uruguayan artillery. From that time dates the\r\nrise of his political power in Argentina. As we have seen, he was\r\ndefeated at Cepeda (1859) in his fight against Urquiza, but in 1861, at\r\nPavón, he led the force of Buenos Aire to victory, becoming president of\r\nArgentina from 1862 to 1868. The rapid strides Argentina has made in the\r\nlast fifty years date from Mitre's presidency. He encouraged the\r\nconstruction of railroads, the establishment of telegraphic\r\ncommunication throughout the republic, and the founding of schools.\r\nDuring the war against Paraguay (1865-1870), which rendered difficult\r\nthe carrying out of Mitre's beneficial plans to the fullest measure, he\r\ndistinguished himself as the commander-in-chief of the allied armies,\r\nthat is, those of Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. He was editor of _La\r\nNación_, which shares with the famous _La Prensa_ the distinction of\r\nbeing the leading newspaper of South America.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the political and military events in Mitre's life, the\r\nquantity and quality of his literary work are really astonishing. We\r\nwonder where he found time to write his remarkable histories of San\r\nMartín and Belgrano (in nine octavo volumes), his various volumes of\r\npoems, his translations from Longfellow and Dante, and his extensive\r\ncorrespondence. As a poet and orator, he ranks among the first in\r\nArgentina; and, as an historian, he remains to this day the great\r\nfountain source to which all those who desire to know the history of\r\nArgentina must turn. He is perhaps the greatest man of letters Argentina\r\nhas produced. As versatile as Sarmiento, though not so voluminous, he\r\ndisplays in general a juster appreciation of facts and a greater\r\nequipoise and a more even excellence in literary form.\r\n\r\n=Goyena= (=Pedro=), an Argentine lawyer and publicist, was born in Buenos\r\nAires in 1841. He was the editor of _La Revista Argentina_ and professor\r\nof Roman law at the University of Buenos Aires. His style, both as\r\nwriter and orator, is known for its purity and brilliancy.\r\n\r\n=Nelson= (=Ernesto=) is a man well known in Argentina in educational\r\ncircles. He was born in Buenos Aires in 1875 and was educated there. He\r\nhas spent ten years in this country studying educational movements. He\r\nwas recently _Director General de Enseñanza Secundaria y Especial_ in\r\nArgentina. Among his publications are _Recopilaciones de Correspondencia\r\nde la Nación_, _Hacia la Universidad Futura_, and numerous articles. He\r\nrepresented his country at the St. Louis Exposition in 1904; took his\r\ndoctor's degree at Columbia University, after four years of residence;\r\nand was a member of the Argentine Commission at the Panama-Pacific\r\nExposition, San Francisco, in 1915, and a delegate to the Second\r\nPan-American Scientific Congress in Washington in 1915-16. He has\r\nedited for use in this country a _Spanish-American Reader_, the first\r\nbook of its kind, dealing, as it does, with all phases of South American\r\nlife and customs.\r\n\r\n=López= (=Lucio V.=), the son of Vicente Fidel López, is a contemporary\r\nArgentine political writer and critic. He was born in 1857, and was\r\nprofessor of political law in the University of Buenos Aires in 1890,\r\nwhen President Juárez Celmán was turned out of office. He was among the\r\nleaders of that movement. He enjoys a great reputation as a keen\r\nobserver and writer on political events in Argentina.\r\n\r\n=Blasco Ibáñez= (=Vicente=) was born in Valencia in 1867. He is one of the\r\nleaders among contemporary Spanish novelists. Prior to the recent war,\r\nhe resided in Argentina, where he received a tract of land from the\r\nArgentine government as a compensation, in part, for his book, written\r\nat the request of the Argentine government, _La Argentina y sus\r\ngrandezas_. At present (1919), he is in France, occupied in writing a\r\nhistory of the war. His book _Los Cuatro Jinetes del Apocalipsis_,\r\npublished during the recent war, deals in the first part with life on\r\nthe Pampas, in the last with the war. It is considered one of the best\r\nbooks brought out by the war in any language. Among his works, these are\r\nbest known: _La Barraca_, _Cañas y Barro_, _La Horda_, _Sangre y Arena_,\r\n_Los Muertos Mandan_, and _El Intruso_. His works have been translated\r\ninto practically every European language.\r\n\r\n=Drago= (=Luis María=) is a contemporary Argentine jurist and writer on\r\ninternational affairs. He has given his name to the _Drago_ doctrine, a\r\ncorollary to the Monroe doctrine. One of his earliest works, _Hombres de\r\nPresa_, a study on criminology, was translated into Italian by\r\nLombroso, the famous Italian criminologist. In 1902 he was elected to\r\nthe Argentine Congress, and shortly after he was appointed minister of\r\nforeign affairs by the then President of the Republic, Julio Roca. In\r\nDecember of that year he sent his famous note to the government of the\r\nUnited States, protesting against the use of force on the part of\r\nEngland, Germany, and Italy for the collection of debts the Venezuelan\r\ngovernment had incurred with private subjects of those nations. He was\r\nthe Argentine delegate to the Second Peace Conference, and is a member\r\nof the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague. In 1912, Columbia\r\nUniversity conferred upon him the degree of Doctor of Laws, _honoris\r\ncausa_. That he is interested not only in legal matters is shown by his\r\npublication _La Literatura del =Slang=_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARGENTINA\r\n\r\nLEGEND AND HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARGENTINA\r\n\r\nLEGEND AND HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nHIMNO NACIONAL ARGENTINO\r\n\r\nVICENTE LÓPEZ Y PLANES\r\n\r\n         _Coro_\r\n\r\n\r\n      Sean eternos los laureles\r\n    que supimos conseguir:\r\n    coronados de gloria vivamos\r\n    o juremos con gloria morir.\r\n\r\n    I.

Esas campañas estaban incultas en manos de la España.\r\nArroyos innumerables y muchos ríos caudalosos, acompañados en una y otra\r\nribera de selvas tupidísimas, distribuían por todas partes una masa\r\nenorme de aguas puras y saludables, que alimentaban pastizales inmensos,\r\ndonde los ganados y el hombre crecían y se multiplicaban libres y\r\nsalvajes. El hombre tenía allí la carne, el fuego y el agua, sin ningún\r\ntrabajo, con un cielo espléndido de luz y de transparencia. El atraso\r\nmoral de la metrópoli, la incuria de su gobierno, su absoluta falta de\r\nindustria, su impotencia caduca para educar y para llevar la vida civil\r\nal seno de los desiertos americanos, habían extenuado todas las\r\nfacultades de la España, rindiéndola en una indolente holgazanería a\r\nmediados del Siglo XVII. Era imposible, pues, que el aliento creador de\r\nlos intereses económicos, que sólo se levantan en la vida urbana,\r\nhubiese podido penetrar en nuestros campos. Así es que la población\r\nerrante que se había apoderado de ellos, había crecido desparramada,\r\ninculta y vagabunda. La extensión indefinida que ocupaba, hacía que el\r\nderecho de la propiedad raíz fuese inútil para sus habitantes, y hasta\r\nse puede decir que era desconocido. Donde cada hombre podía obtener el\r\nderecho nominal de llamarse dueño de cincuenta o más leguas de terreno,\r\nsin otro trabajo que denunciarlo, abonando veinte o cincuenta pesos a la\r\ntesorería del Rey, era imposible que la posesión fuese verdadera delante\r\nde la ley, para[25] responder al título de la propiedad. De modo que el\r\ngaucho argentino no necesitaba de semejante título para tener tierras y\r\npara satisfacer sus necesidades; y en un estado semejante, era natural\r\nque no le fuese fácil concebir que los demás hombres tuviesen razón y\r\njusticia para privarle de la facultad de ocupar el desierto, como cosa\r\nsuya, y de poner su rancho donde mejor le conviniera. Sin peligro del\r\nhombre, sin miedo del aislamiento, porque la rápida carrera de su\r\ncaballo lo trasportaba en un momento a las aldeas de la costa, y dueño\r\nde los ganados que pacían por los campos, era claro que no tenía\r\nnecesidad ninguna de pedir a la tierra ese fruto sabroso de la\r\nagricultura, que civiliza por el trabajo y por la influencia de las\r\nleyes que rigen las producciones del suelo. El hombre civilizado de\r\nnuestros campos había retrogradado verdaderamente, a un estado\r\nsemibárbaro, por causa de su aislamiento relativo. Pero estaba muy lejos\r\nde haber perdido las tradiciones de la civilización de que había tomado\r\norigen, como algunos observadores poco discretos lo han dicho; y sus\r\ncondiciones no eran las de un estado pastoril, análogo al de los\r\npatriarcas del Asia. Éstos necesitaban, por lo menos, de la propiedad de\r\nlos rebaños, gobernaban como patricios la tribu numerosa de sus\r\nparientes, y vagaban por las áridas sequedades del África,[26] buscando\r\nun pozo de agua y un poco de hierba para ellos y para sus bestias.\r\n\r\nEl gaucho argentino vivía absoluto e independiente,[27] con un\r\nindividualismo propio y libre. Se empancipaba de sus padres apenas\r\nempezaba a sentir las primeras fuerzas de la juventud; y vivía\r\nabundantemente de las _volteadas_[28] de los animales que Dios creaba\r\nen el desierto. Armado del lazo, podía echar mano del primer potro que\r\nle ofrecía mejores condiciones para su servicio; escogía, por su propio\r\nderecho, la vaca más gorda para mantenerse; y si necesitaba algún\r\ndinero, para procurarse alguno de los objetos commerciales que apetecía,\r\nderribaba cuantos toros quería, les sacaba los cueros, e iba a venderlos\r\nen las aldeas de las costas, a los mercaderes que traficaban con ellos,\r\npara surtir el escasísimo comercio que teníamos con la Europa. La ley\r\ncivil o política no pesaba sobre él; y aunque no había dejado de ser\r\nmiembro de una sociedad civilizada, vivía sin sujeción a las leyes\r\npositivas del conjunto.[29] Tomaba a una mujer de su clase, libre como\r\nél, sumisa y buena, sin cuidarse mucho de las formas con que se unía a\r\nella. Plantaba una choza en la rinconada de un arroyo, bien cerca del\r\nagua para evitarse el trabajo de acarrearla; y como los prebostes de la\r\nhermandad solían tener la ocurrencia de atravesar los campos, con\r\ncincuenta o sesenta blandengues, ahorcando expeditivamente bandoleros,\r\nel gaucho tenía buen cuidado de levantar esa choza cubierta por el\r\nbosque, y con sendas o vados que le eran conocidos, para[30] evitar\r\nque le encontrasen desprevenido; porque la justicia del Rey no era muy\r\nsolícita en distinguir a los inocentes de los vagos; ni él mismo sabía\r\nbien entre cuáles se había de clasificar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHOZA DE GAUCHO EN LA PAMPA\r\n\r\n_Fraser, The Amazing Argentine_ _Photograph by A. W. Boote & Co., Buenos\r\nAires_]\r\n\r\nA todos estos rasgos, propios del género de vida[31] que hacían, los\r\nguachos agregaban las dotes de un temperamento fuerte, nervioso e\r\ninquieto. El clima en que vivían les permitía viajar a la intemperie,\r\nbajo las influencias, templadas algunas veces, rígidas otras veces, de\r\nla naturaleza y del espacio. Acostumbrados al peligro, y ariscos, por\r\ndecirlo de una vez, estaban siempre prontos a _pelear_ a la justicia del\r\nRey, cuando los sorprendía; y como ella no usaba de procedimientos muy\r\ncuidadosos para determinar sus fallos y sus castigos, los gauchos la\r\nevitaban, siempre que podían, como se evita un peligro grave, o como se\r\nhuye de un yugo incómodo.\r\n\r\nSu cuerpo era por consiguiente muy ágil. Sus miembros mostraban, por su\r\nesbeltez y delicadeza, que, de una generación en otra, se habían críado\r\nsueltos de las tareas abrumadoras y serviles de la agricultura o de la\r\nindustria. Esa constante gimnasia del caballo les daba una destreza\r\nadmirable para sorprender con la velocidad de un gato las furias del\r\npotro salvaje, y sentarse gallardamente en sus lomos, con un equilibrio\r\nque la fiera nunca descomponía, aunque brincase y se revolviese con\r\ndemencia para deshacerse del jinete que la domaba. Su porte era elegante\r\ny cauto; sus maneras serias; y aunque parecían mansas, lo hacían\r\nimpenetrable y digno al mismo[32] tiempo. Algunas veces, fiero e\r\nimpetuoso, daba rienda suelta a sus pasiones; otras, era hidalgo y\r\ngeneroso. Pero siempre era difícil y desigual, como los seres bravíos\r\nque se crían en las soledades de la tierra. Era bello como ellos, por el\r\ntemple y por los rasgos pronunciados de su tipo.\r\n\r\nEn general, el guacho tenía a pecho ser amigable y hospitalario en su\r\ncabaña. Recto en el cumplimiento de su palabra, no se excusaba jamás de\r\nproteger con nobleza a los que reclamaban su amparo, aunque hubiesen\r\nsido sus enemigos. Hablaba tranquilo, y con una voz cubierta que[33]\r\npodría parecer dulce, si no fuese que sus palabras eran siempre escasas,\r\nambiguas o taimadas. Cuando encontraba algo de que burlarse, su ironía\r\nera profunda, pero siempre disimulada con la doblez del sentido, con el\r\nmonosílabo o con un[34] acento particular que daba a sus expresiones. El\r\nenojo no le arrancaba gritos ni gestos; y ya en las dificultades del\r\npeligro, o dominado por la ira, era siempre concentrado, guardando las\r\napariencias de una moderación que era amenazante por su propio\r\nlaconismo.\r\n\r\nDestituído de toda creencia en la fatalidad de los sucesos, ponía su\r\npersonalismo sobre todos los intereses de la vida y sobre todas las\r\ninfluencias religiosas; así es que siempre estaba pronto para reaccionar\r\nen defensa de su persona o de su libertad, y aun reducido al último\r\ntrance, marchando, por ejemplo, al suplicio entre filas de enemigos,\r\nocultaba bajo un aire resignado la atención más vigilante al menor azar,\r\nal menor descuido de sus verdugos, para tirarse al fondo de un río,\r\nsalvar un precipicio, o saltar sobre un caballo y desaparecer como una\r\nsombra entre los arcabuces y sablazos de sus perseguidores. Verdad es,\r\nque nunca le faltaba entre estos mismos un cómplice, o un aparcero que\r\nse interesase por su suerte, y que prepararse el lance dejándole los\r\nriesgos de la ejecución.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VISTA DE UN PAGO DE GAUCHOS\r\n\r\n_Fraser, The Amazing Argentine_ _Photograph by A. W. Boote & Co., Buenos\r\nAires_]\r\n\r\nTodos estos contrastes hacían del gaucho argentino un hombre libre y\r\ncivilizado en medio de la semibarbarie en que vivía, o más bien, en que\r\nvagaba. Porque aunque distante de la vida urbana de los europeos, no era\r\najeno, sin embargo, a la vida política; y ya sea por la raza, ya por las\r\nideas, o por los móviles morales, estaba unido al orden fundamental de\r\nla asociación colonial; puede decirse que era un europeo que había caído\r\nen la vida errante de los desiertos americanos; y que habiendo\r\nconservado su personalismo absoluto e independiente, había venido a\r\nconstituir un tipo especial, que reunía todos estos contrastes, con un\r\nsello indefinido de identidad y de originalidad a la vez; y si fuese\r\nposible dar claridad a cosas que parecerán tan contradictorias, yo diría\r\nque los gauchos de las campañas argentinas, tomados en masa, fueron el\r\ngermen preparado para producir las evoluciones constitucionales de\r\nnuestro organismo, y que a pesar de que, cuando arrojaron su influencia\r\ndecisiva en las vicisitudes de nuestra historia, se hallaban hundidos en\r\nun estado cercano al de la barbarie, eran, con todo, un pueblo libre,\r\nque lleno de la conciencia de sus intereses y de sus derechos políticos,\r\nintrodujo una revolución[35] social en el seno de la revolución política\r\nde mayo, moviéndola en un sentido verdaderamente democrático y en busca\r\nde una civilización liberal sin las trabas del pasado.\r\n\r\nLa vida de los gauchos no tuvo jamás ninguno de los accidentes de la\r\nvida de las tribus. Ellos constituían una población homogénea, señalada\r\ncon un mismo tipo, con unos mismos hábitos, con unas mismas pasiones; y\r\nque poseía todas las aptitudes y las formas de una nacionalidad\r\npolítica, distinta y peculiar. Aunque los gauchos nunca vivían\r\naglomerados, estaban sin embargo espontáneamente distribuidos en\r\n_pagos_, de acuerdo con la configuración que el curso de los ríos, los\r\nmontes y los accidentes limítrofes, le daban a cada porción de la\r\ncampaña. Reconocían entre sí, por esto, una cierta cohesión geográfica\r\nanáloga[36] a la que tienen los diversos vecindarios,[37] si es[38] que\r\nla idea de vecindad puede aplicarse a las partes incultas de un vasto\r\nterritorio. Tenían por lo mismo una especie de patriotismo local\r\nsumamente apasionado, con entidades dominantes o caudillejos que surgían\r\npor el coraje, por el acierto, por la audacia de sus empresas y por los\r\ncrímenes que cometían o por otros mil de esos accidentes, que en todas\r\npartes concurren para formar personajes populares a la altura del\r\nmedio[39] social en que nacen y en que se nutren.\r\n\r\nEl gaucho argentino no reconocía por jefe, ni prestaba servicio militar,\r\nsino al caudillo que él mismo elegía por su propia inclinación; porque\r\nante todo se tenía por hombre libre, y como tal usaba de su criterio y\r\nde su gusto individual con absoluta independencia de todo otro influjo.\r\nEso[40] sí, cuando se había decidido por una bandera, su adhesión no\r\ntenía límites y podía contarse con ella para toda la vida; no\r\neconomizaba sacrificio alguno, y su constancia, sobre todo en las luchas\r\npolíticas, llegaba hasta el heroísmo. Tomaba[41] partido por sentimiento\r\npropio y por pasión, jamás por interés, ni con la mira de obtener el\r\nmenor provecho directo como premio de sus esfuerzos. Lo único que le\r\nmovía eran las afinidades de los hábitos y de las tendencias entre su\r\npersona y la de los jefes a quienes servía; es decir, un patriotismo a\r\nsu modo, pero que en resumidas[42] cuentas era un sentimiento político y\r\nmoral que tenía causas puras y libres en su misma voluntad.\r\n\r\nCuando el acaso terrible de la _leva_ lo había apresado para el servicio\r\nde los ejércitos veteranos de la patria, se debatía, como un animal\r\nbravío por[43] escapar a la presión y a la esclavitud de la disciplina\r\nrigurosísima de San Martín o de Belgrano.[44] Desertaba apenas podía, y\r\nse escondía en las entrañas de la tierra. Pero si le volvían a cazar, se\r\ndaba más o menos pronto según su carácter más o menos indómito; y cuando\r\nuna campaña feliz, una batalla ganada o perdida, venían a darle la\r\npasión del cuerpo en que servía, se convertía en un soldado ejemplar,\r\ncomo no creo que tuviese mejor ninguna otra nación civilizada. Era\r\nsobrio, sufrido, bravo y experto: ni el hambre, ni la desnudez lo\r\nindignaban o lo abatían.\r\n\r\nEntregado siempre a la voluntad de sus jefes, con una alegría templada\r\nque jamás desmentía, servía animado del amor de la patria y con el\r\norgullo militar del ciudadano libre que tiene fe en su causa, y que se\r\nconsidera con la obligación personal de vencer. Toda su filosofía se\r\nreducía a saber que servía a la patria, y que _la patria esperaba ser\r\nsalvada por sus soldados_: la doctrina era lacónica, pero tan cierta,\r\nque apelo al testimonio de cuantos hayan conocido al gaucho argentino,\r\nconvertido en _granadero de a caballo_, o en _voltigero_ del ejército de\r\nlos Andes, para que digan si esto era verdad.\r\n\r\nEn cuanto al sentimiento religioso, el gaucho estaba tan lejos del\r\nárabe, que es imposible hallar entre ellos punto alguno de contacto. En\r\nlas cosas de su persona, de su casa, de sus relaciones, o de sus\r\nnegocios, la religión y sus ministros no valían ni pesaban un ápice para\r\nél. El árabe es ante todo tétrico, _fatalista_ y _creyente_. Vive\r\ndominado por un panteísmo religioso que dirige todas sus ideas: habla\r\ndirectamente con Dios, en la nube que pasa, en las estrellas que brillan\r\nen los cielos, en todos los fenómenos del desierto y en cada uno de los\r\nacontecimientos que tejen el hilo fatídico de su vida. Su ferocidad, sus\r\ncrímenes y hasta sus virtudes, son hijos de su fanatismo. Al gaucho\r\nargentino no se le ocurrió jamás nada de esto. Su alma había florecido\r\nlibre de todo cuerpo de doctrina y batida sólo por los intereses[45] de\r\nla vida material: era alegre de espíritu y vivía independiente en un\r\npaís bellísimo, lleno de recursos, bien regado, fértil, abundante, y que\r\nno tenía ningún punto de contacto con la adusta e imponente severidad\r\ndel clima abrasador del África, en donde sólo la noche y las sombras dan\r\nexpansión al alma de los mortales y de las fieras. El gaucho era en el\r\nfondo un ser completamente descreído: su religión era un deísmo _sui\r\ngeneris_[46] que se reducía a figurar una cruz con los dedos, o a besar\r\nel escapulario que llevaba al pecho, en los momentos difíciles de la\r\nvida. Una vez que lo hacía, se tenía por salvado en el cielo, si moría;\r\no por amparado del poder y del favor de Dios, si se salvaba. Después, ya\r\nno volvía a acordarse de sus deberes religiosos, sino para saludar los\r\nsímbolos del catolicismo, si los encontraba a su paso: una cruz de un\r\nsepulcro, un fraile, o la puerta de una iglesia. Con esto, se tenía por\r\ncatólico romano y papal, sin entender palabra de la cosa, y sin procurar\r\nentenderla tampoco; porque todo lo demás era para él asunto puro de\r\ntradición, de[47] que no se daba otra cuenta sino como de un hecho\r\nsuperior, que le venía impuesto por el[48] asentimiento vago del pueblo,\r\npor una tradición que, aunque desprovista de doctrina, dominaba en[49]\r\nlas campañas y en las chozas donde criaba a su familia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINALIDAD Y CARACTERES ARGENTINOS\r\n\r\nEl Rastreador--El Baquiano--El Gaucho Malo--El Cantor\r\n\r\nDOMINGO F. SARMIENTO\r\n\r\n   Ainsi que l'océan les steppes remplissent l'esprit du sentiment de\r\n                              l'infini[50]\r\n\r\n\r\nSi de las condiciones de la vida pastoril, tal como la han constituído\r\nla colonización y la incuria, nacen graves dificultades para una\r\norganización política cualquiera, y muchas más para el triunfo de la\r\ncivilización europea, de sus instituciones, y de la riqueza y de la\r\nlibertad, que son sus consecuencias, no puede, por otra parte,\r\nnegarse[51] que esta situación tiene su costado poético, fases dignas de\r\nla pluma del romancista. Si un destello de la literatura nacional puede\r\nbrillar momentáneamente en las nuevas sociedades americanas, es el que\r\nresultará de la descripción de las grandiosas escenas naturales, y sobre\r\ntodo de la lucha entre la civilización europea y la barbarie indígena,\r\nentre la inteligencia y la materia; lucha imponente en América, y que\r\nda[52] lugar a escenas tan peculiares, tan características y tan fuera\r\ndel círculo de ideas en que se ha educado el espíritu europeo....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOMINGO F. SARMIENTO\r\n\r\n_Blasco Ibáñez, Argentina y sus grandezas_]\r\n\r\nEl único romancista norteamericano que haya logrado hacerse un nombre\r\neuropeo, es Fenimore Cooper, y eso, porque transportó la escena de sus\r\ndescripciones fuera del círculo ocupado por los plantadores, al limite\r\nentre la vida bárbara y la civilizada, al teatro de la guerra que las\r\nrazas indígenas y la raza sajona están combatiendo por[53] la posesión\r\ndel terreno.\r\n\r\nNo de otro modo nuestro joven poeta Echeverría[54] ha logrado llamar la\r\natención del mundo literario español con su poema titulado _La Cautiva_.\r\nEste[55] bardo argentino dejó a un lado a Dido y Argía,[56] que sus\r\npredecesores los Varelas trataron con maestría clásica y estro poético,\r\npero sin suceso y sin consecuencia, porque nada agregaban al caudal de\r\nnociones europeas, y volvió sus miradas al desierto, y allá en la\r\ninmensidad sin límites, en las soledades en que vaga el salvaje, en la\r\nlejana zona de fuego que el viajero ve acercarse cuando los, campos se\r\nincendian, halló las inspiraciones que proporciona a la imaginación el\r\nespectáculo de una[57] naturaleza solemne, grandiosa, inconmensurable,\r\ncallada; y entonces el eco de sus versos pudo hacerse oír con aprobación\r\naun por la península, española.\r\n\r\nHay que notar de paso un hecho que es muy explicativo de los fenómenos\r\nsociales de los pueblos. Los accidentes de la naturaleza producen\r\ncostumbres y usos peculiares a estos accidentes, haciendo que donde\r\nestos accidentes se repiten, vuelvan a encontrarse los mismos medios de\r\nparar a[58] ellos, inventados por pueblos distintos. Esto me explica por\r\nqué la flecha y el arco se encuentran en todos los pueblos salvajes,\r\ncualesquiera que sean su raza, su origen y su colocación geográfica.\r\nCuando leía en _El Último de los Mohicanos_ de Cooper, que Ojo de Halcón\r\ny Uncas habían perdido[59] el rastro de los Mingos en un arroyo, dije\r\npara mí:[60] \"van a tapar el arroyo.\"[61] Cuando en _La Pradera_[62] el\r\nTrampero[63] mantiene la incertidumbre y la agonía mientras el fuego los\r\namenaza, un argentino habría aconsejado lo mismo que el Trampero[64]\r\nsugiere al fin, que es, limpiar un lugar para guarecerse, e incendiar a\r\nsu vez, para poderse retirar del fuego que invade sobre las cenizas del\r\nque se ha encendido. Tal es la práctica de los que atraviesan la pampa\r\npara salvarse de los incendios[65] del pasto. Cuando los fugitivos de\r\n_La Pradera_ encuentran un río, y Cooper describe la misteriosa[66]\r\noperación del Pawnie con el cuero de búfalo que recoge,--va a hacer la\r\n_pelota_, me dije a mí[67] mismo: lástima es que no haya una mujer que\r\nla conduzca, que entre nosotros son las mujeres las que cruzan los ríos\r\ncon la _pelota_ tomada con los[68] dientes por un lazo. El procedimiento\r\npara asar[69] una cabeza de búfalo en el desierto, es el mismo que\r\nnosotros usamos para _batear_ una cabeza de vaca o un lomo de ternera.\r\nEn fin, mil otros accidentes[70] que omito, prueban la verdad de que\r\nmodificaciones análogas del suelo traen análogas costumbres, recursos y\r\nexpedientes. No es otra la razón de hallar en Fenimore Cooper\r\ndescripciones de usos y costumbres que parecen plagiadas de la pampa;\r\nasí, hallamos en los hábitos pastoriles de la América, reproducidos\r\nhasta los trajes, el semblante grave y hospitalidad árabes.\r\n\r\nExiste, pues, un fondo de poesía que nace de los accidentes naturales\r\ndel país y de las costumbres excepcionales que engendra. La poesía,\r\npara despertarse, porque la poesía es, como el sentimiento religioso,\r\nuna facultad del espíritu humano, necesita el espectáculo de lo bello,\r\ndel poder terrible, de la inmensidad de la extensión, de lo vago, de lo\r\nincomprensible; porque sólo donde acaba lo palpable y vulgar, empiezan\r\nlas mentiras[71] de la imaginación, del mundo ideal. Ahora, yo pregunto:\r\n¿qué impresiones ha de dejar en el habitante de la República Argentina\r\nel simple acto de clavar los ojos en el horizonte, y ver... no ver nada?\r\nPorque cuanto más hunde los ojos en aquel horizonte incierto, vaporoso,\r\nindefinido, más se aleja, más lo fascina, lo confunde y lo[72] sume en\r\nla contemplación y la duda. ¿Dónde termina aquel mundo que quiere en\r\nvano penetrar? ¡No lo sabe! ¿Qué hay más allá de lo que ve? La soledad,\r\nel peligro, el salvaje, la muerte. He aquí ya la poesía. El hombre que\r\nse mueve en estas escenas, se siente asaltado de temores e\r\nincertidumbres fantásticas, de sueños que lo preocupan despierto.[73]\r\n\r\nDe aquí resulta que el pueblo argentino es poeta[74] por carácter, por\r\nnaturaleza. ¿Y cómo ha de[75] dejar de serlo, cuando en medio de una\r\ntarde serena y apacible, una nube torva y negra se levanta sin saber de\r\ndónde, se extiende sobre el cielo mientras se cruzan dos palabras, y de\r\nrepente[76] el estampido del trueno anuncia la tormenta que deja frío al\r\nviajero, y reteniendo el aliento por temor de atraerse un rayo de los\r\nmil que caen en[77] torno suyo? La obscuridad sucede después a la luz;\r\nla muerte está por todas partes; un poder terrible, incontrastable, le\r\nha hecho en un momento reconcentrarse en sí mismo, y sentir su nada en\r\nmedio de aquella naturaleza irritada: sentir a Dios, por decirlo de una\r\nvez, en la aterrante magnificencia de sus obras. ¿Qué más colores para\r\nla paleta de la fantasía?--Masas de tinieblas[78] que anublan el día,\r\nmasas de luz lívida, temblorosa, que ilumina un instante las tinieblas y\r\nmuestra la[79] pampa a distancias infinitas, cruzándolas vivamente el\r\nrayo, en fin, símbolo del poder.--Estas imágenes han sido hechas para\r\nquedarse hondamente grabadas. Así cuando la tormenta pasa, el gaucho se\r\nqueda triste, pensativo, serio, y la sucesión de luz y tinieblas se\r\ncontinúa en su imaginación, del mismo modo que, cuando miramos fijamente\r\nel sol, nos queda por largo tiempo su disco en la retina.\r\n\r\nPreguntadle al gaucho a quién matan con preferencia los rayos, y os\r\nintroducirá en un mundo de idealizaciones morales y religiosas,\r\nmezcladas de hechos naturales, pero mal comprendidos, de tradiciones\r\nsupersticiosas y groseras. Añádase que si es cierto que el flúido\r\neléctrico entra[80] en la economía de la vida humana, y es el mismo que\r\nllaman flúido nervioso, el cual excitado subleva las pasiones y enciende\r\nel entusiasmo, muchas disposiciones debe tener para los trabajos de la\r\nimaginación el pueblo que habita bajo una atmósfera[81] cargada de\r\nelectricidad hasta el punto que la ropa frotada chisporrotea come el\r\npelo[82] contrariad del gato.\r\n\r\n¿Cómo no ha de ser poeta el que presencia esas escenas imponentes?\r\n\r\n   --\"Gira en vano, reconcentra\r\n    Su inmensidad y no encuentra\r\n    La vista en su vivo anhelo[83]\r\n    Do fijar su fugaz vuelo,\r\n    Como el pájaro en el mar.\r\n    Doquier campo y heredades\r\n    Del ave y bruto guaridas;\r\n    Doquier cielo y soledades\r\n    De Dios sólo conocidas,\r\n    Que Él sólo puede sondar.\"\r\n\r\n¿O el que tiene a la vista esta naturaleza engalanada?\r\n\r\n   --\"De las entrañas de América\r\n    Dos raudales se desatan:\r\n    El Paraná, faz de perlas,[84]\r\n    Y el Uruguay, faz de nácar.\r\n    Los dos entre bosques corren\r\n    O entre floridas barrancas,\r\n    Como dos grandes espejos\r\n    Entre marcos de esmeraldas.\r\n    Salúdanlos en su paso\r\n    La melancólica pava,\r\n    El picaflor y el jilguero,\r\n    El zorzal y la torcaza.\r\n    Como ante reyes se inclinan\r\n    Ante ellos ceibos y palmas,\r\n    Y les arrojan[85] flor del aire,[86]\r\n    Aroma y flor de naranja;\r\n    Luego en el Guazú se encuentran.[87]\r\n    Y reuniendo sus aguas,\r\n    Mezclando nácar y perlas\r\n    Se derraman en el Plata.\"\r\n\r\nPero ésta es la poesía culta, la poesía de la ciudad; hay otra que hace\r\noír sus ecos por los campos solitarios: la poesía popular, candorosa y\r\ndesaliñada del gaucho.\r\n\r\nTambién nuestro pueblo es músico. Ésta es una predisposición nacional\r\nque todos los vecinos le reconocen. Cuando en Chile se anuncia por la\r\nprimera vez un argentino en una casa, lo invitan al piano en el acto, o\r\nle pasan una vihuela, y si se excusa diciendo que no sabe pulsarla, lo\r\nextrañan, y no le creen, \"porque siendo argentino\", dicen, \"debe ser\r\nmúsico\". Esta es una preocupación popular que acusa nuestros hábitos\r\nnacionales. En efecto, el joven culto de las ciudades toca el piano o la\r\nflauta, el violín o la guitarra; los mestizos se dedican casi\r\nexclusivamente a la música, y son muchos los hábiles compositores e\r\ninstrumentistas que salen de entre ellos. En las noches de verano se oye\r\nsin cesar la guitarra en la puerta de las tiendas, y tarde de la noche,\r\nel sueño es dulcemente interrumpido por las serenatas y los conciertos\r\nambulantes.\r\n\r\nEl pueblo campesino tiene sus cantares propios: el _triste_, que\r\npredomina en los pueblos del Norte, es un canto frigio, plañidero,\r\nnatural al[88] hombre en el estado primitivo de barbarie, según\r\nRousseau; la _vidalita_, canto popular con coros,[89] acompañado de la\r\nguitarra y un tamboril, a cuyos redobles se reune la muchedumbre y va\r\nengrosando el cortejo y el estrépito de las voces. Este canto me parece\r\nheredado de los indígenas, porque lo he oído en una fiesta de indios en\r\nCopiapó[90] en celebración de la Candelaria, y como canto religioso debe\r\nser antiguo, y los indios chilenos no lo han de haber adoptado de los\r\nespañoles[91] argentinos. La _vidalita_ es el metro popular en que se\r\ncantan los asuntos del día, las canciones guerreras; el gaucho compone\r\nel verso que canta, y lo populariza por las asociaciones que su\r\ncanto[92] exige.\r\n\r\nAsí, pues, en medio de la rudeza de las costumbres nacionales, estas dos\r\nartes que embellecen la vida civilizada y dan desahogo a tantas pasiones\r\ngenerosas, están honradas y favorecidas por las masas mismas que ensayan\r\nsu áspera musa en composiciones líricas y poéticas. El joven Echeverría\r\nresidió algunos meses en la campaña en 1840, y la fama de sus versos\r\nsobre la pampa le había precedido ya; los gauchos lo rodeaban con\r\nrespeto y afición, y cuando un recién venido mostraba señales de desdén\r\nhacia el _cajetilla_, alguno le insinuaba al oído: \"es poeta,\" y toda\r\nprevención hostil cesaba al oír este título privilegiado.\r\n\r\nSabido es, por otra parte, que la guitarra es el instrumento popular de\r\nlos españoles, y que es común en América. En Buenos Aires, sobre todo,\r\nestá todavía muy vivo el tipo popular español, el _majo_. Descúbresele\r\nen el compadrito de la ciudad y en el gaucho de la campaña. El _jaleo_\r\nespañol vive en el _cielito_; los dedos sirven de castañuelas. Todos los\r\nmovimientos de los hombros, los ademanes, la colocación del sombrero,\r\nhasta la manera de escupir por entre los colmillos, todo es un andaluz\r\ngenuino.[93]\r\n\r\nDel centro de estas costumbres y gustos generales se levantan\r\nespecialidades notables, que un día embellecerán y darán un tinte\r\noriginal al drama y al romance nacional. Yo quiero sólo notar aquí\r\nalgunos que servirán para completar la idea de[94] las costumbres, para\r\ntrazar en seguida el carácter, causas y efectos de la guerra civil.[95]\r\n\r\n\r\nEl Rastreador\r\n\r\nEl más conspicuo de todos, el más extraordinario, es el _rastreador_.\r\nTodos los gauchos del interior son rastreadores. En llanuras tan\r\ndilatadas en donde las sendas y caminos se cruzan en todas direcciones,\r\ny los campos en que pacen o transitan las bestias son abiertos, es\r\npreciso saber seguir las huellas de un animal, y distinguirlas de entre\r\nmil; conocer si va despacio o ligero, suelto o tirado, cargado o vacío.\r\nÉsta es una ciencia casera y popular. Una vez caía yo de un camino de\r\nencrucijada al de Buenos Aires, y el peón que me conducía echó, como de\r\ncostumbre, la vista al suelo. \"Aquí va, dijo luego, una mulita mora, muy\r\nbuena... ésta es la tropa de don Zapata... es de muy buena silla... va\r\nensillada...[96] ha pasado ayer...\" Este hombre venía de la[97] sierra\r\nde San Luis, la tropa volvía de Buenos[98] Aires, y hacía un año que él\r\nhabía visto por última vez la mulita mora cuyo rastro estaba confundido\r\ncon el de toda una tropa en un sendero de dos pies de ancho. Pues esto\r\nque parece increíble, es con todo, la ciencia vulgar; éste era un peón\r\nde arria, y no un rastreador de profesión.\r\n\r\nEl rastreador es un personaje grave, circunspecto, cuyas aseveraciones\r\nhacen fe en los tribunales inferiores. La conciencia del saber que\r\nposee, le da cierta dignidad reservada y misteriosa. Todos lo tratan con\r\nconsideración: el pobre, porque puede hacerle mal, calumniándolo o\r\ndenunciándolo; el propietario, porque su testimonio puede fallarle. Un\r\nrobo se ha ejecutado[99] durante la noche; no bien se nota, corren a\r\nbuscar una pisada del ladrón, y encontrada, se cubre con algo para que\r\nel viento no la disipe. Se llama en seguida al rastreador, que ve el\r\nrastro y lo sigue sin mirar sino de tarde en tarde el suelo, como si sus\r\nojos vieran de relieve esa pisada que para otro es imperceptible. Sigue\r\nel curso de las calles, atraviesa los huertos, entra en una casa, y\r\nseñalando un hombre que encuentra, dice fríamente: \"¡Éste es!\" El delito\r\nestá probado, y raro es el delincuente que resiste a esta acusación.\r\nPara él, más que para el juez, la deposición del rastreador es la\r\nevidencia misma; negarla sería ridículo, absurdo. Se somete, pues, a\r\neste testigo que[100] considera como el dedo de Dios que lo señala. Yo\r\nmismo he conocido a Calíbar, que ha ejercido en una provincia su oficio\r\ndurante cuarenta años consecutivos. Tiene ahora cerca de ochenta años;\r\nencorvado por la edad, conserva, sin embargo, un aspecto venerable y\r\nlleno de dignidad. Cuando le hablan de su reputación fabulosa, contesta:\r\n\"ya no valgo nada; ahí están los niños;\" los niños son sus hijos, que\r\nhan aprendido en la escuela de tan famoso maestro. Se cuenta de él que\r\ndurante un viaje a Buenos Aires le robaron una vez su montura de gala.\r\nSu mujer tapó el rastro con una artesa. Dos meses después Calíbar\r\nregresó, vió el rastro ya borrado e imperceptible para otros ojos, y no\r\nse habló más del caso. Año y medio después Calíbar marchaba cabizbajo\r\npor una calle de los suburbios, entra en una casa, y encuentra su\r\nmontura ennegrecida ya, y casi inutilizada por el uso. ¡Había encontrado\r\nel rastro de su raptor después de casi dos años! El año 1830, un reo\r\ncondenado a muerte se había escapado de la cárcel. Calíbar fue encargado\r\nde buscarlo. El infeliz, previendo que sería rastreado, había tomado\r\ntodas las precauciones que la imagen del cadalso le sugirió.\r\n¡Precauciones inútiles! Acaso sólo sirvieron para perderle; porque,\r\ncomprometido Calíbar en su reputación, el amor propio ofendido le hizo\r\ndesempeñar con calor una tarea que perdía a un hombre, pero que probaba\r\nsu maravillosa vista. El prófugo aprovechaba todas las desigualdades del\r\nsuelo para no dejar huellas; cuadras enteras había marchado pisando con\r\nla punta del pie; trepábase en seguida a las murallas bajas, cruzaba un\r\nsitio, y volvía para atrás. Calíbar lo seguía sin perder la pista; si le\r\nsucedía momentáneamente extraviarse,[101] al hallarla de nuevo\r\nexclamaba: \"¡Dónde[102] te _mi-as-dir_!\" Al fin llegó a una acequia de\r\nagua en los suburbios, cuya corriente había seguido aquél para burlar al\r\nrastreador.... ¡Inútil! Calíbar iba por las orillas, sin inquietud, sin\r\nvacilar. Al fin se detiene, examina unas hierbas,[103] y dice: \"Por aquí\r\nha salido; no hay rastros, pero estas gotas de agua en los pastos lo\r\nindican.\" Entra en una viña; Calíbar reconoció las tapias que la\r\nrodeaban, y dijo: \"Adentro está.\" La partida de soldados se cansó de\r\nbuscar, y volvió a dar cuenta de la inutilidad de las pesquisas. \"No ha\r\nsalido\", fué la breve respuesta que sin moverse, sin proceder a nuevo\r\nexamen, dió el rastreador. No había salido en efecto, y al día\r\nsiguiente fué ejecutado. En 1830 algunos reos políticos intentaban una\r\nevasión: todo estaba preparado, los auxiliares de afuera prevenidos; en\r\nel momento de efectuarla, uno dijo: \"¿Y Calíbar?--¡Cierto!--contestaron\r\nlos otros anonadados, aterrados,--¡Calíbar!\"\r\n\r\nSus familias pudieron conseguir de Calíbar que estuviese enfermo cuatro\r\ndías contados desde la evasión, y así pudo efectuarse sin inconveniente.\r\n\r\n¿Qué misterio es éste del rastreador? ¿Qué poder microscópico se\r\ndesenvuelve en el órgano de la vista de estos hombres? ¡Cuán sublime\r\ncriatura es la que Dios hizo a su imagen y semejanza!\r\n\r\n\r\nEl Baquiano\r\n\r\nDespués del rastreador, viene el _baquiano_, personaje[104] eminente y\r\nque tiene en sus manos la suerte de los particulares y la de las\r\nprovincias. El baquiano es un gaucho grave y reservado, que conoce a\r\npalmo veinte mil leguas cuadradas de llanuras, bosques y montañas. Es el\r\ntopógrafo más completo; es el único mapa que lleva un general para\r\ndirigir los movimientos de su campaña. El baquiano va siempre a su lado.\r\nModesto y reservado como una tapia, está en todos los secretos de la\r\ncampaña; la suerte del ejército, el éxito de una batalla, la conquista\r\nde una provincia, todo depende de él.\r\n\r\nEl baquiano es casi siempre fiel a su deber; pero no siempre el general\r\ntiene en él plena confianza. Imaginaos la posición de un jefe\r\ncondenado[105] a llevar un traidor a su lado, y a pedirle los\r\nconocimientos indispensables para triunfar. Un baquiano encuentra una\r\nsendita que hace cruz con el camino que lleva: él sabe a qué aguada[106]\r\nremota conduce; si encuentra mil, y esto sucede en un espacio de cien\r\nleguas, él las conoce todas, sabe de donde vienen y adonde van. Él sabe\r\nel vado oculto que tiene un río, más arriba o más abajo del paso\r\nordinario, y esto en cien ríos o arroyos; él conoce en los ciénagos\r\nextensos un sendero por donde pueden ser atravesados sin inconveniente,\r\ny esto en cien ciénagos distintos.\r\n\r\nEn lo más obscuro de la noche, en medio de los bosques o en las llanuras\r\nsin límites, perdidos sus compañeros, extraviados, da una vuelta en\r\ncírculo de ellos, observa los árboles; si no los hay, se[107] desmonta,\r\nse inclina a tierra, examina algunos matorrales y se orienta de la\r\naltura en que se halla; monta en seguida, y les dice para asegurarlos:\r\n\"Estamos en dereceras de tal lugar, a tantas leguas de las habitaciones;\r\nel camino ha de ir al[108] Sur\"--y se dirige hacia el rumbo que señala,\r\ntranquilo, sin prisa de encontrarlo, y sin responder a las objeciones\r\nque el temor o la fascinación sugiere a los otros.\r\n\r\nSi aun esto no basta, o si se encuentra en la pampa y la obscuridad es\r\nimpenetrable, entonces arranca pastos de varios puntos, huele la raíz y\r\nla tierra, los masca, y después de repetir este procedimiento varias\r\nveces, se cerciora de la proximidad de algún lago, o arroyo de agua\r\nsalada, o[109] dulce, y sale en su busca para orientarse fijamente. El\r\ngeneral Rosas, dicen, conoce por el gusto el[110] pasto de cada estancia\r\ndel sur de Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\nSi el baquiano lo es de la pampa, donde no hay[111] caminos para\r\natravesarla, y un pasajero le pide que lo lleve directamente a un\r\nparaje distante cincuenta leguas, el baquiano se para un momento,\r\nreconoce el horizonte, examina el suelo, clava la vista en un punto y se\r\necha a galopar con la rectitude de una flecha, hasta que cambia de rumbo\r\npor motivos que sólo él sabe, y galopando día y noche, llega al lugar\r\ndesignado.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESTANCIA EN LAS PAMPAS\r\n\r\n_Fraser, The Amazing Argentine_ _Photograph by A. W. Boote & Co., Buenos\r\nAires_]\r\n\r\nEl baquiano anuncia también la proximidad del enemigo; esto es, diez\r\nleguas, y el rumbo por donde se acerca, por medio del movimiento de los\r\navestruces, de los gamos y guanacos que huyen en cierta dirección.\r\nCuando se aproxima,[112] observa los polvos[113], y por su espesor\r\ncuenta la fuerza: \"son dos mil hombres\", dice--\"quinientos\",\r\n\"doscientos\", y el jefe obra bajo este dato, que[114] casi siempre es\r\ninfalible. Si los cóndores y cuervos revolotean en un círculo del cielo,\r\nél sabrá decir si hay gente escondida, o es un campamento recién\r\nabandonado, o un simple animal muerto. El baquiano conoce la distancia\r\nque hay de un lugar a otro; los días y las horas necesarias para llegar\r\na él, y además una senda extraviada e ignorada por donde se puede llegar\r\nde sorpresa en la mitad del tiempo; así es que las partidas de\r\nmontoneras emprenden sorpresas sobre pueblos que están a cincuenta\r\nleguas de distancia, y que casi siempre las aciertan.[115] ¿Creeráse\r\nexagerado[116]? ¡No! El general Rivera,[117] de la Banda Oriental,[118]\r\nes un simple baquiano que conoce cada árbol que hay en toda la extensión\r\nde la República del Uruguay. No la hubieran ocupado los brasileños sin\r\nsu auxilio, y no la hubieran libertado sin él los argentinos.\r\nOribe,[119] apoyado por Rosas, sucumbió después de tres años de lucha\r\ncon el general baquiano, y todo el poder de Buenos Aires, hoy con sus\r\nnumerosos ejércitos que cubren toda la campaña del Uruguay, puede\r\ndesaparecer destruído a pedazos, por una sorpresa, por una fuerza\r\ncortada mañana, por una victoria que él sabrá convertir en su provecho,\r\npor el conocimiento de algún caminito que cae a retaguardia del enemigo,\r\no por otro accidente inadvertido o insignificante.\r\n\r\nEl general Rivera principió sus estudios del terreno el año 1804, y\r\nhaciendo la guerra a las autoridades, entonces como contrabandista, a\r\nlos contrabandistas después como empleado, al rey en seguida como\r\npatriota, a los patriotas más tarde como montonero, a los argentinos\r\ncomo jefe brasileño, a éstos como general argentino, a Lavalleja como\r\npresidente, al presidente Oribe[120] como jefe proscrito, a Rosas, en\r\nfin, aliado de Oribe, como general oriental, ha tenido sobrado tiempo\r\npara aprender un poco de la ciencia del baquiano.\r\n\r\n\r\nEl Gaucho Malo\r\n\r\nÉste es un tipo de ciertas localidades, un _outlaw_, un _squatter_, un\r\nmisántropo particular. Es el Ojo del Halcón, el Trampero de Cooper, con\r\ntoda[121] su ciencia del desierto, con toda su aversión a las\r\npoblaciones de los blancos; pero sin su moral natural y sin sus\r\nconexiones con los salvajes. Llámanle el Gaucho Malo, sin que este\r\nepíteto le desfavorezca del todo. La justicia lo persigue[122] desde\r\nmuchos años; su nombre es temido, pronunciado en voz baja, pero sin odio\r\ny casi con respeto. Es un personaje misterioso; mora en la pampa, son su\r\nalbergue los cardales; vive de perdices y de _mulitas_; si alguna vez\r\nquiere regalarse con una lengua, enlaza una vaca, la voltea[123] solo,\r\nla mata, saca su bocado predilecto, y abandona lo demás a las aves\r\nmontesinas. De repente se presenta el Gaucho Malo en un pago de donde la\r\npartida acaba de salir; conversa pacíficamente con los buenos gauchos,\r\nque lo rodean y lo admiran; se provee _de los vicios_, y si divisa la\r\npartida, monta[124] tranquilamente en su caballo, y lo apunta hacia el\r\ndesierto, sin prisa, sin aparato, desdeñando volver la cabeza. La\r\npartida rara vez lo sigue; mataría inútilmente sus caballos, porque el\r\nque monta el Gaucho Malo es un parejero _pangaré_, tan célebre como su\r\namo. Si el acaso lo echa alguna vez de improviso entre las garras de la\r\njusticia, acomete lo más espeso de la partida, y a merced de cuatro\r\ntajadas que con su cuchillo ha abierto en la cara o en el cuerpo de los\r\nsoldados, se hace paso por entre ellos, y tendiéndose sobre el lomo del\r\ncaballo para sustraerse a la acción de balas que lo persiguen, endilga\r\nhacia el desierto, hasta que, poniendo espacio conveniente entre él y\r\nsus perseguidores, refrena su trotón y marcha tranquilamente. Los poetas\r\nde los alrededores agregan esta nueva hazaña a la biografía del héroe\r\ndel desierto, y su nombradía vuela por toda la vasta campaña. A veces se\r\npresenta a la puerta de un baile campestre con una muchacha que ha\r\nrobado; entra en baile con su pareja, confúndese[125] en las mudanzas\r\ndel _cielito_, y desaparece sin que nadie lo advierta. Otro día se\r\npresenta en la casa de la familia ofendida, hace descender de la grupa a\r\nla niña que ha seducido, y desdeñando las maldiciones de los padres que\r\nlo siguen, se encamina tranquilo a su morada sin límites.[126]\r\n\r\nEste hombre divorciado con la sociedad, proscrito por las leyes; este\r\nsalvaje de color blanco, no es en el fondo un ser más depravado que los\r\nque habitan las poblaciones. El osado prófugo que acomete una partida\r\nentera, es inofensivo para con los viajeros. El Gaucho Malo no es un\r\nbandido, no es un salteador; el ataque a la vida no entra en su idea,\r\ncomo el robo no entraba en la idea del _Churriador_; roba, es cierto,\r\npero ésta es su profesión, su tráfico, su ciencia: roba caballos. Una\r\nvez viene al real de una tropa del interior; el patrón propone comprarle\r\nun caballo de tal pelo extraordinario, de tal figura, de tales prendas,\r\ncon una estrella blanca en la paleta. El gaucho se recoge, medita un\r\nmomento, y después de un rato de silencio, contesta: \"No hay actualmente\r\ncaballo así.\" ¿Qué ha estado pensando el gaucho? En aquel momento ha\r\nrecorrido en su mente mil estancias de la pampa, ha visto y examinado\r\ntodos los caballos que hay en la provincia, con sus marcas, color, señas\r\nparticulares,[127] y se ha convencido de que no hay ninguno que tenga\r\nuna estrella en la paleta: unos la tienen en la frente, otros una mancha\r\nblanca en el anca.\r\n\r\n¿Es sorprendente esta memoria? ¡No! Napoleón conocía por sus nombres a\r\ndoscientos mil soldados, y recordaba, al verlos, todos los hechos que a\r\ncada uno de ellos se referían. Si[128] no se le pide, pues, lo\r\nimposible, en día señalado, en un punto dado del camino, entregará un\r\ncaballo tal como se le pide, sin que el anticiparle el dinero sea un\r\nmotivo de faltar a la cita. Tiene sobré este punto el honor de los\r\ntahures sobre la deuda. Viaja a veces a la campaña de Córdoba, a Santa\r\nFé. Entonces se le ve cruzar la pampa con una tropilla de caballos por\r\ndelante; si alguno lo encuentra, sigue su camino sin acercársele, a\r\nmenos[129] que él lo solicite.\r\n\r\n\r\nEl Cantor\r\n\r\nAquí tenéis la idealización de aquella vida de revueltas, de\r\ncivilización, de barbarie, y de peligros. El _Gaucho Cantor_ es el\r\nmismo bardo, el vate, el trovador de la Edad Media, que se mueve en la\r\nmisma escena, entre las luchas de las ciudades y del feudalismo de los\r\ncampos, entre la vida que se va y la vida que se acerca. El cantor anda\r\nde pago en pago, de \"tapera en galpón\", cantando sus héroes de la pampa,\r\nperseguidos por la justicia, los llantos de la viuda a quien los indios\r\nhan robado sus hijos en un _malón_ reciente, la derrota y la muerte del\r\nvaliente Rauch,[130] la catástrofe de Facundo Quiroga,[131] y la suerte\r\nque cupo a Santos Pérez. El cantor está haciendo candorosamente el mismo\r\ntrabajo de crónica, costumbres, historia, biografía, que el bardo de la\r\nEdad Media; y sus versos serían recogidos más tarde como los documentos\r\ny datos en que habría de apoyarse el historiador futuro, si a su lado no\r\nestuviese otra sociedad culta, con superior inteligencia de los\r\nacontecimientos que el infeliz[132] despliega en sus rapsodias ingenuas.\r\nEn la República Argentina se ven a un tiempo dos civilizaciones\r\ndistintas en un mismo suelo: una naciente, que sin conocimiento de lo\r\nque tiene sobre su cabeza, está[1][133] remedando los esfuerzos ingenuos\r\ny populares de la Edad Media; otra que, sin cuidarse de lo que tiene a\r\nlos pies,[134] intenta realizar los últimos resultados de la\r\ncivilización europea: el siglo XIX y el siglo XII viven juntos; el uno\r\ndentro de las ciudades, el otro en las campañas.\r\n\r\nEl cantor no tiene residencia fija: su morada está donde la noche le\r\nsorprende: su fortuna en sus versos y en su voz. Dondequiera[135] que el\r\n_cielito_ enreda sus parejas sin tasa, dondequiera que se apura una copa\r\nde vino, el cantor tiene su lugar preferente, su parte escogida en el\r\nfestín. El gaucho argentino no bebe, si la música y los versos no lo\r\nexcitan,[136] y cada _pulpería_ tiene su guitarra para poner en manos\r\ndel cantor, a quien el grupo de caballos estacionados a la puerta\r\nanuncia a lo lejos donde se necesita el concurso de su gaya ciencia.\r\n\r\nEl cantor mezcla entre sus cantos heroicos la relación de sus propias\r\nhazañas. Desgraciadamente, el cantor, con ser[137] el bardo argentino,\r\nno está libre de tener[138] que habérselas con la justicia. También\r\ntiene que dar cuenta de sendas puñaladas que ha distribuído, una o dos\r\n_desgracias_ (¡muertes!) que tuvo, y algún caballo o muchacha que robó.\r\nEl año 1840, entre un grupo de gauchos y a orillas del majestuoso\r\nParaná, estaba sentado en el suelo y con las piernas cruzadas un cantor\r\nque tenía azorado y divertido a un auditorio con la larga y animada\r\nhistoria de sus trabajos y aventuras. Había ya contado lo del rapto[139]\r\nde la querida, con los trabajos que sufrió; lo de la _desgracia_, y la\r\ndisputa que la motivó; estaba refiriendo su encuentro con la partida y\r\nlas puñaladas que en su defensa dió, cuando el tropel y los gritos de\r\nlos soldados le avisaron que esta vez estaba cercado. La partida, en\r\nefecto, se había cerrado en forma de herradura; la abertura quedaba\r\nhacia el Paraná, que corría veinte varas más abajo, tal era la altura de\r\nla barranca. El cantor oyó la grita sin turbarse: viósele de improviso\r\nsobre el caballo, y echando una mirada escudriñadora sobre el círculo de\r\nsoldados con las tercerolas preparadas, vuelve el caballo hacia la\r\nbarranca, le pone el poncho en[140] los ojos y clávale las espuelas.\r\nAlgunos instantes después se veía salir de las profundidades del[141]\r\nParaná, el caballo sin freno, a fin de que nadase con más libertad, y el\r\ncantor tomado de la cola,[142] volviendo la cara quietamente, cual si\r\nfuera en un bote de ocho remos, hacia la escena que dejaba en la\r\nbarranca. Algunos balazos de la partida no estorbaron que llegase sano y\r\nsalvo al primer islote que sus ojos divisaron.\r\n\r\nPor lo demás, la poesía original del cantor es pesada, monótona,\r\nirregular, cuando se abandona a la inspiración del momento: más\r\nnarrativa que sentimental, llena de imágenes tomadas de la vida\r\ncampestre, del caballo, y de las escenas del desierto, que la hacen\r\nmetafórica y pomposa. Cuando refiere sus proezas o las de algún afamado\r\nmalévolo, parécese al improvisador napolitano, desarreglado, prosaico de\r\nordinario, elevándose a la altura poética por momentos, para caer de\r\nnuevo al recitado insípido y casi sin versificación. Fuera de esto, el\r\ncantor posee su repertorio de poesías populares, quintillas, décimas y\r\noctavas, diversos géneros de versos octosilábicos. Entre éstas hay\r\nmuchas composiciones de mérito, y que descubren inspiración y\r\nsentimiento.\r\n\r\nAun podría añadir a estos tipos originales muchos otros igualmente\r\ncuriosos, igualmente locales, si tuviesen, como los anteriores, la\r\npeculiaridad de revelar las costumbres nacionales, sin lo cual es\r\nimposible comprender nuestros personajes políticos, ni el carácter\r\nprimordial y americano de la sangrienta lucha[143] que despedaza a la\r\nRepública Argentina. Andando esta historia,[144] el lector va a\r\ndescubrir por sí solo dónde se encuentra el rastreador, el baquiano, el\r\ngaucho malo y el cantor. Verá en los caudillos cuyos nombres han\r\ntraspasado las fronteras argentinas, y aun en aquellos que llenan el\r\nmundo con el horror de su nombre, el reflejo vivo de la situación\r\ninterior del país, sus costumbres y su organización.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASOCIACIÓN\r\n\r\nDOMINGO F. SARMIENTO\r\n\r\n     Le gaucho vit de privations, mais son luxe est la liberté. Fier\r\n     d'une indépendence sans bornes, ses sentiments, sauvages comme sa\r\n     vie, sont pourtant nobles et bons.--HEAD\r\n\r\n(MOTTO. _The gaucho lives amid privations, but his luxury is freedom.\r\nProud of the boundless independence he enjoys, his sentiments, as wild\r\nas his life, are nevertheless noble and good._ Taken from _Croquis des\r\nPampas_, written in 1826 by Sir Francis Bond Head, after his return to\r\nEngland from his mission as director of a mining company in the\r\nprovinces of the Plata.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Pulpería\r\n\r\nEn el capítulo primero[145] hemos dejado al campesino argentino en el\r\nmomento en que ha llegado a la edad viril, tal cual lo ha formado la\r\nnaturaleza y la falta de verdadera sociedad en que vive. Le hemos visto\r\nhombre independiente de toda necesidad, libre de toda sujeción, sin\r\nideas de gobierno, porque todo orden regular y sistemado se hace de todo\r\npunto imposible. Con estos hábitos de incuria, de independencia, va a\r\nentrar en otra escala de la vida campestre, que, aunque vulgar, es el\r\npunto de partida de todos los grandes acontecimientos que vamos a ver\r\ndesenvolverse muy luego.\r\n\r\nNo se olvide que hablo de los pueblos esencialmente[146] pastores; que\r\nen éstos tomo la fisonomía fundamental,[147] dejando las modificaciones\r\naccidentales que experimentan, para indicar a su tiempo los efectos[148]\r\nparciales. Hablo de la asociación de estancias que, distribuídas de\r\ncuatro en cuatro leguas, más o menos, cubren la superficie de una\r\nprovincia.\r\n\r\nLas campañas agrícolas subdividen y diseminan también la sociedad, pero\r\nen una escala muy reducida; un labrador colinda con otro: y los aperos\r\nde labranza y la multitud de instrumentos, aparejos, bestias, que\r\nocupa,[149] lo variado[150] de sus productos y las diversas artes que la\r\nagricultura llama en su auxilio, establecen relaciones necesarias entre\r\nlos habitantes de un valle y hacen indispensable un rudimento de villa\r\nque les sirva de centro. Por otra parte, los cuidados y faenas que la\r\nlabranza exige, requieren tal número de brazos, que la ociosidad se hace\r\nimposible, y los varones se ven forzados a permanecer en el recinto de\r\nla heredad. Todo lo contrario sucede en esta[151] singular asociación.\r\nLos límites de la propiedad[152] no están marcados; los ganados, cuanto\r\nmás numerosos son, menos brazos ocupan; la mujer se encarga de todas las\r\nfaenas domésticas y fabriles; el hombre queda desocupado, sin goces, sin\r\nideas, sin atenciones forzosas; el hogar doméstico lo fastidia, lo\r\nexpele, digámoslo así. Hay necesidad, pues, de una sociedad facticia\r\npara remediar esta desasociación normal. El hábito contraído desde la\r\ninfancia de andar a caballo, es un nuevo estímulo para dejar la casa.\r\n\r\nLos niños tienen el deber de echar caballos al corral apenas sale el\r\nsol; y todos los varones, hasta los pequeñuelos, ensillan su caballo,\r\naunque[153] no sepan qué hacerse. El caballo es una integrante del\r\nargentino de los campos; es para él lo que la corbata para los que viven\r\nen el seno de[154] las ciudades. El año 41, el Chacho, caudillo de[155]\r\nlos Llanos, emigró a Chile.--¿Cómo le va amigo?,--le preguntaba\r\nuno.--¡Cómo me ha de ir!--,[156] contestó con el acento del dolor y de\r\nla melancolía.--¡En Chile... y a pie! Sólo un gaucho argentino sabe\r\napreciar todas las desgracias y todas las angustias que estas dos frases\r\nexpresan.[157]\r\n\r\nAquí vuelve a aparecer la vida árabe, tártara. Las siguientes palabras\r\nde Victor Hugo parecen escritas en la pampa:\r\n\r\n\"¡No podría combatir a pie! no hace sino una sola persona con su\r\ncaballo.\"--(_Le Rhin_)\r\n\r\nSalen, pues, los varones sin saber fijamente adónde. Una vuelta a los\r\nganados, una visita a una cría o a la querencia de un caballo\r\npredilecto, invierte una pequeña parte del día; el resto lo absorbe una\r\nreunión en una venta o _pulpería_. Allí concurren cierto número de\r\nparroquianos de los alrededores; allí se dan y adquieren noticias[158]\r\nsobre los animales extraviados; trázanse en el suelo las marcas del\r\nganado, sábese dónde se caza el tigre, dónde se le han visto rastros al\r\nleón: allí[159] en fin, está el cantor; allí se fraterniza por el[160]\r\ncircular de la copa y las prodigalidades de los que poseen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNA PULPERÍA EN EL CAMPO\r\n\r\n_Blasco Ibáñez, Argentina y sus grandezas_]\r\n\r\nEn esta vida tan sin emociones, el juego sacude los espíritus enervados,\r\nel licor enciende las imaginaciones adormecidas. Esta asociación\r\naccidental de todos los días viene, por su repetición, a formar una\r\nsociedad más estrecha que la de donde partió cada individuo; y en esta\r\nasamblea, sin objeto público, sin interés social, empiezan a[161]\r\necharse los rudimentos de las reputaciones que más tarde, y andando los\r\naños, van a aparecer en la escena política. Ved cómo.\r\n\r\nEl gaucho estima, sobre todas las cosas, las fuerzas físicas, la\r\ndestreza en el manejo del caballo y, además, el valor. Esta reunión,\r\neste _club_ diario, es un verdadero circo olímpico en que se ensayan y\r\ncomprueban los quilates del mérito de cada uno.\r\n\r\nEl gaucho anda armado del cuchillo, que ha heredado de los españoles;\r\nesta peculiaridad de la Península, este grito característico de\r\nZaragoza,[162] _¡guerra a cuchillo!_, es aquí más real que en\r\nEspaña.[163] El cuchillo, a más de un arma, es un instrumento[164] que\r\nle sirve para todas sus ocupaciones; no puede vivir sin él; es como la\r\ntrompa del elefante, su brazo, su mano, su dedo, su todo. El gaucho, a\r\nla par de jinete, hace alarde de valiente y el[165] cuchillo brilla a\r\ncada momento, describiendo círculos en el aire a la menor provocación,\r\nsin provocación alguna, sin otro interés que medirse con un desconocido;\r\njuega a las puñaladas como jugaría a los dados. Tan profundamente entran\r\nestos hábitos pendencieros en la vida íntima del gaucho argentino, que\r\nlas costumbres han creado sentimientos de honor y una esgrima que\r\ngarantiza[166] la vida. El hombre de la plebe de los demás países toma\r\nel cuchillo para matar, y mata; el gaucho argentino lo desenvaina para\r\npelear, y hiere solamente. Es preciso que esté muy borracho, es preciso\r\nque tenga instintos verdaderamente malos o rencores muy profundos, para\r\nque atente contra la vida de su adversario. Su objeto es sólo\r\n_marcarlo_, darle una tajada en la cara, dejarle una señal indeleble.\r\nAsí se ve a estos gauchos[167] llenos de cicatrices, que rara vez son\r\nprofundas. La riña, pues, se traba por brillar, por la gloria[168] del\r\nvencimiento, por amor a la reputación. Ancho círculo se forma en torno\r\nde los combatientes, y los ojos siguen con pasión y avidez el centelleo\r\nde puñales, que no cesan de agitarse un momento. Cuando la sangre corre\r\na torrentes, los espectadores se creen obligados en conciencia a\r\nsepararlos. Si sucede una _desgracia_, las simpatías están por el que se\r\ndesgració; el mejor caballo le sirve para alejarse a parajes lejanos, y\r\nallí lo acoge el respeto o la compasión. Si la justicia le da alcance,\r\nno es raro que haga frente, y si _corre a la partida_,[169] adquiere un\r\nrenombre desde entonces que se dilata sobre una ancha circunferencia.\r\nTranscurre el tiempo, el juez ha sido mudado, y ya puede presentarse de\r\nnuevo en su pago sin que se proceda a ulteriores persecuciones; está\r\nabsuelto. Matar es una desgracia, a menos que el hecho se repita tantas\r\nveces que inspire horror el contacto del asesino. El estanciero Don Juan\r\nManuel de Rosas, antes de ser hombre público, había hecho de su\r\nresidencia una especie de asilo para los homicidas, sin que jamás\r\nconsintiese en su servicio a los ladrones; preferencias que se\r\nexplicarían fácilmente por su carácter de gaucho propietario, si su\r\nconducta posterior no hubiese revelado afinidades[170] que han llenado\r\nde espanto al mundo.\r\n\r\nEn cuanto a los juegos de equitación, bastaría[171] indicar uno de los\r\nmuchos en que se ejercitan, para juzgar del arrojo que para entregarse a\r\nellos se requiere. Un gaucho pasa a todo escape por enfrente de sus\r\ncompañeros. Uno le arroja un[172] tiro de bolas, que en medio de la\r\ncarrera maniata el caballo. Del torbellino de polvo que levanta éste al\r\ncaer vese salir al jinete corriendo seguido del caballo,[173] a quien\r\nel impulso de la carrera interrumpida hace avanzar obedeciendo a las\r\nleyes de la física. En este pasatiempo se juega la vida, y a veces se\r\npierde.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GAUCHO EN EL ACTO DE ARROJAR UN TIRO DE BOLAS\r\n\r\n_Hutchinson, Buenos Aires and Argentine Gleanings_]\r\n\r\n¿Creeráse que estas proezas y la destreza y la audacia en el manejo del\r\ncaballo son la base de las grandes ilustraciones que han llenado con su\r\nnombre la República Argentina y cambiado la faz del país? Nada es más\r\ncierto, sin embargo. No es mi ánimo persuadir a que el asesinato y el\r\ncrimen hayan sido siempre una escala de ascensos. Millares son los\r\nvalientes que han parado en bandidos[174] oscuros; pero pasan de\r\ncentenares los que a esos hechos han debido su posición. En todas las\r\nsociedades despotizadas, las grandes dotes naturales van a perderse en\r\nel crimen; el =genio=[175] romano que conquistara el mundo, es hoy el[176]\r\nterror de los Lagos Pontinos,[177] y los Zumalacárregui,[178] los Mina\r\nespañoles, se encuentran a centenares en Sierra Leona. Hay una necesidad\r\npara el hombre[179] de desenvolver sus fuerzas, su capacidad y su\r\nambición, que cuando faltan los medios legítimos,[180] él se forja un\r\nmundo con su moral y sus leyes aparte, y en él se complace en mostrar\r\nque había nacido Napoleón o César.\r\n\r\nCon esta sociedad, pues, en que la cultura del espíritu es inútil o\r\nimposible, donde los negocios municipales no existen, donde el bien\r\npúblico es una palabra sin sentido, porque no hay público, el hombre\r\ndotado eminentemente se esfuerza por producirse, y adopta para ello los\r\nmedios y caminos que encuentra. El gaucho será un malhechor o un\r\ncaudillo, según el rumbo que las cosas tomen en el momento en que ha\r\nllegado a hacerse notable.\r\n\r\nCostumbres de este género requieren medios vigorosos de represión, y\r\npara reprimir desalmados se necesitan jueces más desalmados aún. Lo que\r\nal principio dije del capataz de carretas,[181] se aplica exactamente al\r\njuez de campaña. Ante toda otra cosa, necesita valor: el terror de su\r\nnombre es más poderoso que los castigos que aplica. El juez es\r\nnaturalmente algún famoso de tiempo[182] atrás, a quien la edad y la\r\nfamilia han llamado a la vida ordenada. Por supuesto, que la\r\njusticia[183] que administra es de todo punto arbitraria; su conciencia\r\no sus pasiones lo guían, y sus sentencias son inapelables. A veces suele\r\nhaber jueces de[184] éstos, que lo son de por vida, y que dejan una[185]\r\nmemoria respetada. Pero la conciencia de estos medios ejecutivos, y lo\r\narbitrario de las penas,[186] forman ideas en el pueblo sobre el poder\r\nde la _autoridad_, que más tarde vienen a producir sus efectos. El juez\r\nse hace obedecer por su reputación de audacia temible, su autoridad, su\r\njuicio sin formas, su sentencia, un _yo lo mando_, y sus castigos\r\ninventados por él mismo. De este desorden, quizá por mucho tiempo\r\ninevitable, resulta que el caudillo que en las revueltas llega a\r\nelevarse, posee sin contradicción, y sin que sus secuaces[187] duden de\r\nello, el poder amplio y terrible que sólo se encuentra hoy en los\r\npueblos asiáticos. El caudillo argentino es un Mahoma que pudiera a su\r\nantojo cambiar la religión dominante y forjar una nueva. Tiene todos\r\nlos poderes: su injusticia es una desgracia para su víctima, pero no un\r\nabuso de su parte; porque él puede ser injusto; más todavía, él ha de\r\nser injusto necesariamente; siempre lo ha sido.\r\n\r\nLo que digo del juez es aplicable al comandante[188] de campaña. Éste es\r\nun personaje de más alta categoría que el primero, y en quien han de\r\nreunirse en más alto grado las cualidades de reputación y antecedentes\r\nde aquél. Todavía una circunstancia[189] nueva agrava, lejos de\r\ndisminuir, el mal. El gobierno de las ciudades es el que da el título de\r\ncomandante de campaña; pero como la ciudad es débil en el campo, sin\r\ninfluencias y sin adictos, el gobierno echa mano de los hombres que más\r\ntemor le inspiran para encomendarles este empleo, a fin de tenerlos en\r\nsu obediencia; manera muy[190] conocida de proceder de todos los\r\ngobiernos débiles, y que alejan el mal del momento presente, para que se\r\nproduzca más tarde en dimensiones colosales. Así el gobierno papal hace\r\ntransacciones[191] con los bandidos, a quienes da empleos en Roma,\r\nestimulando con esto el vandalaje y creándole un porvenir seguro: así el\r\nsultán concedía[192] a Mehemet Alí la investidura de Bajá de Egipto,\r\npara tener que reconocerlo más tarde rey hereditario a trueque de que no\r\nlo destronase.[193] Es singular que todos los caudillos de la\r\nrevolución[194] argentina han sido comandantes de campaña: López e\r\nIbarra, Artigas y Güemes, Facundo y[195] Rosas. Es el punto de partida\r\npara todas las ambiciones. Rosas, cuando hubo apoderádose de la ciudad,\r\nexterminó a todos los comandantes que[196] lo habían elevado, entregando\r\neste influyente cargo a hombres vulgares, que no pudiesen seguir el\r\ncamino que él había traído: Pajarito, Celarrayán,[197] Arbolito, Pancho\r\nel Ñato, Molina, eran otros tantos comandantes de que Rosas purgó\r\nal[198] país.\r\n\r\nDoy tanta importancia a estos pormenores, porque ellos servirán a\r\nexplicar todos nuestros fenómenos sociales, y la revolución que se ha\r\nestado obrando en la República Argentina: revolución que está\r\ndesfigurada por palabras del diccionario civil, que la disfrazan y\r\nocultan creando ideas erróneas: de la misma manera que los españoles, al\r\ndesembarcar en América, daban un nombre europeo conocido a un animal\r\nnuevo que encontraban, saludando con el terrible de león, que trae al\r\nespíritu la magnanimidad y fuerza del rey de las bestias, al miserable\r\ngato llamado puma, que huye a la vista de los perros, y tigre al jaguar\r\nde nuestros bosques. Por deleznables e innobles que parezcan estos\r\nfundamentos que quiero dar a la guerra civil, la evidencia vendrá luego\r\na mostrar cuán sólidos e indestructibles son. La vida de los campos\r\nargentinos, tal como la he mostrado, no es un accidente vulgar; es un\r\norden de cosas, un sistema de asociación, característico, normal, único,\r\na mi juicio, en el mundo, y él solo basta para explicar toda nuestra\r\nrevolución. Había antes de 1810 en la República Argentina dos sociedades\r\ndistintas, rivales e incompatibles; dos civilizaciones diversas: la una\r\nespañola, europea, culta; y la otra bárbara, americana, casi indígena;\r\ny la revolución de las ciudades sólo iba a servir[199] de causa, de\r\nmóvil, para que estas dos maneras distintas de ser de un pueblo se\r\npusiesen en presencia una de otra, se acometiesen, y después de largos\r\naños de lucha, la una absorbiese a la otra. He indicado la asociación\r\nnormal de la campaña, la desasociación, peor mil veces que la[200] tribu\r\nnómada; he mostrado la asociación ficticia en la desocupación, la\r\nformación de las reputaciones[201] gauchas--valor, arrojo, destreza,\r\nviolencia y oposición a la justicia regular, a la justicia civil de la\r\nciudad. Este fenómeno de organización social existía en 1810, existe aún\r\nmodificado en muchos puntos, modificándose lentamente en otros, e\r\nintacto en muchos aún. Estos focos de[202] reunión del gauchaje\r\nvaliente, ignorante, libre y desocupado, estaban diseminados a millares\r\nen la campaña. La revolución de 1810 llevó a todas partes el movimiento\r\ny el rumor de las armas. La vida pública que hasta entonces había\r\nfaltado a esta asociación árabe-romana, entró en todas las ventas, y el\r\nmovimiento revolucionario trajo al fin la asociación bélica en la\r\n_montonera_ provincial, hija legítima de la venta y de la estancia,\r\nenemiga de la ciudad y del ejército patriota revolucionario.\r\nDesenvolviéndose los acontecimientos, veremos las _montoneras_\r\nprovinciales con sus caudillos a la cabeza; en Facundo Quiroga,[203]\r\núltimamente triunfante en todas partes, la campaña sobre las ciudades, y\r\ndominadas éstas en su espíritu, gobierno, civilización, formarse al fin\r\nel gobierno central, unitario, despótico, del estanciero Don Juan Manuel\r\nde Rosas que clava en la culta Buenos Aires el cuchillo del gaucho y\r\ndestruye la obra de los siglos, la civilización, las leyes y libertad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEYENDAS DEL PAÍS DE LA SELVA\r\n\r\nC. O. BUNGE (Según Ricardo Rojas)\r\n\r\n\r\nI. El País de la Selva, Sus Leyendas y Trovadores\r\n\r\nLlamo _País de la Selva_ a la región argentina que se extiende, en el\r\ninterior de la república, desde la cuenca de los grandes ríos hasta las\r\nprimeras ondulaciones de la montaña, es decir,[204] entre las llanuras\r\nbañadas por el Paraná y sus afluentes y los contrafuertes iniciales de\r\nla cordillera de los Andes. A esa región central correspondíale en los\r\ntiempos del coloniaje el nombre de Tucumán, y abarcaba, más o menos, las\r\nactuales provincias de Tucumán, Santiago del[205] Estero y Córdoba. En\r\nlos tiempos anteriores a la conquista estuvo ella poblada por varias\r\nrazas y pueblos indígenas, entre los cuales descollaran[206] los Lules,\r\npor haber recibido y adoptado del Cuzco la cultura quichua o\r\nincásica.[207]\r\n\r\nNo hay en toda la República Argentina territorio alguno donde existan\r\nmás tradiciones y leyendas locales que en el País de la Selva. Los mitos\r\ny argumentos legendarios de la antigua cultura indígena han persistido\r\nhasta los tiempos actuales, mezclándose y amalgamándose a veces, curiosa\r\ny originalmente, a las ideas y sentimientos aportados por la conquista\r\nespañola. Es sobre todo en la provincia de Santiago del Estero, que se\r\ndiría el corazón del País de la Selva, donde mayormente se conservan las\r\nantiguas leyendas indiocoloniales, siendo las más populares la de\r\n_Zupay_ y la del _Kacuy_.\r\n\r\nTransmítense las leyendas verbalmente en quichua, de padres a hijos.\r\nPero la Selva tiene también sus trovadores que saben cantar su poesía.\r\nLa poesía y la música se hallan unidas en las costumbres de la Selva,\r\ncual lo estuvieron en la Grecia clásica. Siendo éstas las\r\nmanifestaciones estéticas más genuinas del país, los trovadores,\r\ngeneralmente, cultivan las dos. La melodía acompaña y sostiene la copla,\r\ny ambas se integran en la danza por un ritmo común.\r\n\r\nNinguna de las fiestas del país se realiza sin la presencia del\r\ntrovador, especie de sacerdote de la alegría y de la muerte. Es su\r\nescenario la selva[208] toda, recorrida por él en vida vagabunda. Hoy\r\nle llevan a velorios, mañana a una trinchera de carnestolendas, después\r\na pesebres, luego a holgorios de boda, más tarde a bailes\r\ntradicionales.... Él es el órgano expresivo de todos los sentimientos\r\ndel pueblo. Él agasaja al viajero, al caudillo, al magistrado, o\r\nsimplemente al patrón. Él anima las reuniones carnavalescas o nupciales;\r\nél plañe en torno al féretro de los difuntos monótonas alabanzas, y\r\njunto al cadáver de los párvulos musita las letanías de los\r\nángeles,--pues allí donde no llega la acción sacramental de la iglesia,\r\nno sólo realiza su misión profana de la alegría báquica, sino las\r\nceremonias de un verdadero culto religioso....\r\n\r\nNinguna particular indumentaria singulariza la indumentaria del cantor;\r\npero el instrumento del cual se acompaña, completa su figura. Cultiva\r\nante todo el amor de su vihuela. Protégela de la humedad y del sol;\r\nquiérela como si fuera una mujer.... Y la vihuela corresponde tanto a\r\nsus amores, que la trova dice:\r\n\r\n      Las cuerdas de mi guitarra\r\n    gimen conmigo a la par\r\n    y me ayudan a llorar\r\n    el dolor que me lastima...\r\n    ¡Si parece que la prima[209]\r\n    hubiese aprendido a hablar!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICARDO ROJAS, JOVEN ESCRITOR ARGENTINO\r\n\r\n_Blasco Ibáñez, Argentina y sus grandezas_]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Zupay\r\n\r\nEntre los mitos del país _Zupay_[210] es, sin duda, la encarnación más\r\npotente del misterio selvático. Zupay es el Diablo de la Selva; y, como\r\ntal, no es producto genuino del espíritu quichua, ni la tradición\r\nincontaminada del demonio español. Más bien es una resultante del uno y\r\ndel otro. En su estado primordial es un genio latente y maligno; es el\r\ngenio de todo lo adverso que aflige a los hombres y el enemigo de\r\nNuestro Señor. Puede estar en el agua, en el fuego, en la atmósfera; y\r\nsabe, al par, dirigir estos elementos para sembrar en la Selva pestes,\r\ninundaciones, sequías, catástrofes....\r\n\r\nEl mito de Zupay se relaciona tanto con los de la hechicera y la\r\nSalamanca,[211] que constituyen inseparable unidad. Los poderes de la\r\nbruja provienen de un pacto con Zupay, y la Salamanca no es sino la\r\nacademia subterránea, oculta en el bosque, donde el neófito aprende su\r\nciencia junto a las cátedras diabólicas. Zupay, maestro, da sus\r\nlecciones a la bruja, su discípula, en su escuela tenebrosa, la\r\nSalamanca....\r\n\r\nZupay, universal y ubicuo en su estado latente, es multiforme en sus\r\npersonificaciones y manifestaciones. Prefiere en sus metamorfosis\r\nfiguras humanas. Ha encarnado alguna vez en cuerpo de hermoso mancebo,\r\napareciéndose en un rancho a cierta mujer ingenua. Se ha mostrado otra\r\nocasión como un gaucho rico y joven que visita la Selva en su caballo\r\nenjaezado de mágicos arreos. Otra sazón, un paisano, cantor de la\r\ncomarca, atravesando el bosque, rumbo a la fiesta, vióse de pronto\r\nacompañado por alguien que le desafiaba a \"payar\", guitarra en mano: era\r\ntambién Zupay,[212] el Malo, como en la leyenda de Santos Vega. Los\r\nnativos hablan asimismo de un diminuto duende, que es como la\r\nencarnación humorística y bromista de Zupay. Es el travieso enano de la\r\nsiesta, con[213] su corta estatura, su rostro magro y barbirrucio, el\r\ningenio maligno bullendo bajo el ancho sombrerote de copa en embudo....\r\n\r\nLos hijos de la Selva refieren otras revelaciones de Zupay. Cierto día\r\nlos montes saladinos oyeron[214] el baladro de un fabuloso toro, bestia\r\nchúcara de olímpica frente sobre cuello crinado, y ¡era también Zupay!\r\nOtro día le vieron, entre las penumbras del ramaje, con rostro de\r\nsátiro, peludas piernas y hendidas patas de chivo....\r\n\r\nHe ahí cómo este dios o demonio numeroso parece mezclarse a la diaria\r\nexistencia de esas campañas. Sus dominios se extienden a la espesura\r\ntoda; y hasta un árbol de la flora local señala con nombre equívoco la\r\npresencia del mito. En la descriptiva nomenclatura de las plantas\r\nsilvestres figura la _malop'taco_, \"algarroba del diablo\"....\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. El Kacuy\r\n\r\nVive en la Selva un pájaro nocturno que, al romper el silencio de las\r\nsombras, estremece el alma con su lúgubre canto. Esa ave tiene su\r\nhistoria. Y es la tragedia de su origen lo que evoca con su grito\r\nlastimero, ayeando entre las[215] arboledas tenebrosas: ¡Turay!...\r\n¡Turay!...[216] ¡Turay!...\r\n\r\nEn la época muy remota, dicen las tradiciones indígenas, una pareja de\r\nhermanos (un hermano y una niña) habitaba un rancho en las selvas. Él\r\nera bueno; ella era cruel. Amábala él como pidiéndole ventura para sus\r\nhoras huérfanas; pero ella acibaraba sus días con recalcitrante\r\nperversidad. Desesperado, abandonaba él en ocasiones la choza,\r\ninternándose en las marañas; y ella amainaba en el aislamiento sus iras,\r\nhilando alguna vedija en la rueca o tramando una colcha en sus telares.\r\nMientras vagaba por la Selva el buen hermano pensaba en la hermana, y,\r\nperdonándola siempre, llevábale al rancho las algarrobas más gordas, los\r\nmístoles más dulces, las más sazonadas tunas. Vivían ambos de los frutos\r\nnaturales en aquel siglo de Dios. Proveyendo a su subsistencia, él traía\r\nhoy para la casa un mikilo atrapado a garrote[217] por el estero\r\ncercano; o bien un sábalo pescado[218] en fisga en el remanso del río;\r\nsi no un quirquincho[219] de la barranca próxima, o algún panal de\r\nlachiguana, manando rubio néctar por los simétricos alvéolos. Palmo a\r\npalmo conocía su monte, y, siendo cazador de tigres además, protegía la\r\nmorada. Insigne buscador de mieles, nadie tenía más despiertos ojos para\r\nseguir a la abeja voladora que lo llevaba a su colmena: la de la\r\n_ashpa-mishqui_[220] escondida en el suelo, en un cardón enjambrada; la\r\ndel _tiu-simi_ y la de _cayanes_ o de _queyas_ fabricada en el tronco de\r\nlos más duros árboles.... Todo esto le costaba trabajo y pequeños\r\ndolores; pero ella en cambio mostrábase indiferente, como gozándose en\r\nsus penas.\r\n\r\nVolvió él una tarde sediento, fatigado, tras un día de infructuosa\r\npesquisa; pues, como reinaba la sequía, estaban yermos y en escasez[221]\r\nlos campos. Sangrábale la mano, porque al pretender agarrar una perdiz\r\nboleada a lives y caída[222] entre unas matas, pinchóle el\r\n_uturuncu-huakachina_, el cactus espinoso \"que hace llorar al tigre\".\r\nPidió entonces a su hermana un poco de hidromiel para beberla y otro de\r\nagua para restañarse los arañazos. Trajo ella ambas cosas; mas, en lugar\r\nde servírselas, derramó en su presencia en el suelo la botijilla de agua\r\ny el tupo de miel. El hombre,[223] una vez más, ahogó su desventura.\r\nPero, como al día siguiente le volcara también la ollita donde se\r\ncocinaba el locro de su refrigerio habitual, desesperado,[224] resolvió\r\nvengarse. Encubriendo en su invitación sus deseos de venganza, invitóla\r\npara que le acompañase a un sitio no lejano, donde había descubierto\r\nmiel abundante de _moro-moros_. No vistió su zamarra profesional, ni sus\r\nguanteletes, ni el sachasombrero, ni llevó la bocina de las meleadas\r\nporque juzgaba fácil la ventura. El árbol, un abuelo del bosque, era sin\r\nembargo de gigantesca talla. Cuando llegaron allí, el muchacho persuadió\r\na su perversa hermana a que debían operar con cuidado, buscando\r\nbeneficiarse del néctar sin destruir las abejas pequeñitas, pues se\r\nreferían historias de cazadores meleros desaparecidos bruscamente a\r\nmanos de un dios invisible que protege las colmenas.... Sobre la\r\nhorqueta más alta[225] hizo pasar un lazo; y lo preparó en un extremo, a\r\nguisa de columpio, para que subiese su hermana, bien cubierta por el\r\nponcho, en defensa del enjambre, ya alborotado por la maniobra. Tirando\r\nal otro extremo, a manera de corrediza palanca, la solivió en el aire,\r\nhasta llegar a la copa; y, cuando ella se hubo instalado allí, sin\r\ndescubrirse, él empezó a simular que ascendía por el tronco,\r\ndesgajándolo a hachazos, mientras bajaba en realidad. Zafó después el\r\nlazo, y huyó sigilosamente.... Presa quedaba en lo alto la infeliz.\r\n\r\nTranscurrieron instantes de silencio. Ella habló.... Nadie respondía....\r\nComo empezaba a temer, soliviantó la manta que la tapaba, dejando apenas\r\nuna rendija para espiar. El zumbido de los insectos la aturdió, pues el\r\narmado enjambre revolaba furioso en derredor, vibrante de alas y\r\ntrompas. Ese rumor confuso revelaba la profundidad del silencio. ¿Qué\r\npodría ser? No sospechaba la hora ni el lugar. Ciega de horror y de\r\ncoraje se desembozó de súbito; al descubrir el espacio, el vacío del\r\nvértigo la dominó.... ¡Sola, sola para siempre!\r\n\r\nAbandonada a semejante altura, sobre un tronco liso y largo, sin otras\r\nramas que ésas a las cuales se aferraban sus prietas manos, espiaba para\r\nver si el hermano reaparecía por ahí. La acometían deseos de arrojarse,\r\npero la brusquedad del golpe amilanábala. No obstante, si perecía allá,\r\nquien sabe si los caranchos no vendrían a saciarse en ella, como en las\r\nosamentas de los animales que morían ignorados en el monte.\r\n\r\nMientras tanto la noche iba descendiendo en[226] progresiva nitidez de\r\nsombra. Desde su atalaya, la pobre huérfana había podido, por primera\r\nvez, contemplar sobre el panorama de la Selva la inmensidad de los\r\nhorizontes, y la sucesión de las copas verdes que se unían formando\r\nobscuro océano encrespado de gigantescas olas. El sol hundiéndose tras\r\nlos árboles, la impresionó más soberbio qué nunca, iluminado el enorme\r\nlomo del bosque con su claridad apacible y decorado el cielo de\r\nOccidente por cosmogónicos resplandores. Luego vió aquella gran luz\r\naguarse hasta disolverse toda en la noche,--noche sin astros para mayor\r\ndesventura.... Nunca se le mostró más pavoroso el cielo, ni más callada\r\nla breña. Viniéronle ansias locas de perderse en lo ignoto, de hender\r\nesa inmensidad de árboles y tinieblas, o llenar el silencio de un solo\r\ngrito. Mas, ahora, se le añusgaba la garganta muda y la lengua se le\r\npegaba en la boca con sequedad de arcilla. Tiritaba como si el ábrego la\r\nazotase con su punzante frío y sentía el alma toda mordida por\r\nimplacables remordimientos. Los pies, en esfuerzo anómalo con que ceñían\r\nsu rama de apoyo, fueron desfigurándose en garras de buho; la nariz y\r\nlas uñas se encorvaban; y los dos brazos, abiertos en agónica\r\ndistensión, emplumecían desde los hombros a las manos. Disnea asfixiante\r\nla estranguló, y, al verse de pronto convertida en ave nocturna, un\r\nímpetu de volar arrancóla del árbol y la empujó a las sombras....\r\n\r\nAsí nació el kacuy. La pena rompió en su garganta llamando a aquel\r\nhermano justiciero. Y el grito de contrición de esa mujer convertida en\r\nave, resuena aún y resonará siempre sobre la noche de los bosques\r\nnatales: ¡Turay!... ¡Turay!... ¡Turay!...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA LEYENDA DE SANTOS VEGA\r\n\r\nC. O. BUNGE\r\n\r\n\r\nEntre las leyendas pampeanas, y puede decirse que entre todas las\r\nleyendas argentinas, ninguna[227] tan expresiva y popular como la de\r\nSantos Vega. Santos Vega es la más pura y elevada personificación del\r\ngaucho. Es el hijo, es el señor, es el dios de la Pampa. Su historia,\r\nque puede reducirse al episodio de su justa poética con el diablo,\r\nrepresenta el destino de una raza y es la síntesis de su epopeya. Aunque\r\nfuera acaso alguna vez persona de carne y hueso, transformóse Santos\r\nVega en verdadero mito, hasta constituir un símbolo nacional.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNA PAYADA DE CONTRAPUNTO\r\n\r\n_Blasco Ibáñez, Argentina y sus grandezas_]\r\n\r\nEn tiempos distantes y nebulosos, allí donde se pierde el recuerdo de\r\nlos orígenes de la nacionalidad argentina, Santos Vega fué el más\r\npotente payador. Su numen era inagotable en la improvisación[228] de\r\nendechas, ya tiernas, ya humorísticas; su voz de timbre cristalino y\r\ntrágico inundaba el alma de sorpresa y arrobamiento; sus manos\r\narrancaban a la guitarra acordes que eran sollozos, burlas,\r\nimprecaciones. Su fama llenaba el desierto. Ávida de escucharlo acudía\r\nla muchedumbre de los cuatro rumbos del horizonte. En las \"payadas[229]\r\nde contrapunto\", esto es, en las justas o torneos de canto y verso,\r\nsalía siempre triunfante. No había en las pampas trovador que lo\r\nigualara, ni recuerdo de que alguna vez lo hubiese habido. Dondequiera\r\nque se presentase rendíale el homenaje de su poética soberanía aquella\r\nturba gauchesca tan amante de la libertad y rebelde a la imposición.\r\nPara el alma sencilla del paisano, dominada por el canto exquisito,\r\nSantos Vega era el rey de la Pampa.\r\n\r\nA la sombra de un ombú, ante el entusiasta auditorio que atraía siempre\r\nsu arte, inspirado por el amor de su \"prenda\", una morocha de ojos\r\nnegros y labios rojos, cantaba una tarde Santos Vega, el payador, sus\r\nmejores canciones. En religioso silencio escuchábanle hombres y mujeres,\r\nconmovidos hasta dejar correr ingenuamente las lágrimas.... En esto se\r\npresenta a galope tendido un forastero, tírase del caballo, interrumpe\r\nel canto y desafía al cantor. Es tan extraño su aspecto, que todos temen\r\nvaga y punzantemente una desgracia. Pálido de coraje, Santos Vega acepta\r\nel desafío, templa la guitarra y canta sus _cielos_ y _vidalitas_. Y\r\ncuando termina, creyendo imposible que un ser humano le pueda vencer,\r\nlos circunstantes lo aplauden en ruidosa ovación. Hácese otra vez\r\nsilencio. Tócale su turno al forastero....[230] Su canto divino es una\r\nmúsica nunca oída, caliente de pasiones infernales, rebosante de ritmos\r\ny armonías enloquecedoras.... ¡Ha vencido a Santos Vega! Nadie puede\r\nnegarlo, todos lo reconocen condolidos y espantados, y el mismo payador\r\nantes que todos.... ¡Adiós fama, adiós gloria, adiós vida! Santos Vega\r\nno puede sobrevivir a su derrota.... Acaso el vencedor, en quien se\r\nreconoce ahora al propio diablo, al temido Juan sin Ropa, habiendo\r\nganado, y como trofeo[231] de su victoria, pretenda el alma del\r\nvencido.... Desde entonces, en efecto, desapareciendo del mundo de los\r\nmortales, Santos Vega es una sombra doliente, que, al atardecer y en las\r\nnoches de luna, cruza a lo lejos las pampas, la guitarra terciada en la\r\nespalda, en su caballo veloz como el viento.\r\n\r\nPoetas populares y poetas cultos han cantado hermosamente la leyenda de\r\nSantos Vega. La crítica le ha encontrado hoy un sentido épico. El[232]\r\ndiablo es la moderna civilización, que, con las máquinas y fábricas de\r\nsu portentosa técnica, vence al gaucho y lo desaloja de sus vastos\r\ndominios. Como los primitivos cantores no podían prever este destino\r\ndel gaucho, el símbolo viene a ser posterior, y, en realidad, no\r\nencuadra sino vagamente y por coincidencia en los verdaderos términos de\r\nla leyenda. Su origen está más bien, a mi juicio, en la doctrina bíblica\r\ndel _Génesis_. Como los metafísicos[233] la adaptaron a la filosofía con\r\nsu concepto de la \"edad de oro\", los gauchos la traducen en su leyenda\r\nde Santos Vega. Santos Vega en la Pampa fue Adán en el Paraíso\r\nTerrestre, antes de incurrir en el pecado original. Su \"prenda\" ocupa el\r\nmismo lugar secundario de Eva. El demonio tienta su orgullo de dueño y\r\nseñor de la[234] llanura. Él, estimulado por la presencia de la morocha,\r\nacepta el reto, y es vencido. El demonio lo desaloja de sus dominios. El\r\nombú hace, aunque imperfectamente, el papel del árbol de la ciencia y\r\ndel bien y del mal. Lo cierto es que la ciencia vencedora, el arte del\r\ndemonio, se identifica al mal, contraponiéndola al bien, al arte\r\nespontáneo, a la inspiración del payador que viene de Dios. Así, aunque\r\ntraidoramente vencido por sobrehumanas fuerzas, y quizá por su misma\r\nderrota tan trágicamente humana, Santos Vega queda triunfante en el alma\r\ndel pueblo, y su sombra ha de verse pasar a la distancia mientras exista\r\nun palmo de tierra argentina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA TRADICIÓN DE LUCÍA MIRANDA\r\n\r\nC. O. BUNGE\r\n\r\n\r\nApenas descubierto el estuario que se llamaría más tarde río de La\r\nPlata, sin dejarse intimidar por la trágica muerte de su glorioso\r\ndescubridor, don Juan Díaz de Solís, remontó en 1526 sus\r\nmajestuosas[235] aguas don Sebastián Gaboto, marino veneciano[236] al\r\nservicio de España. Penetrando por primera vez en el río Paraná, fundó,\r\nen la desembocadura del río Carcarañá, sobre su margen izquierda, el\r\nfuerte del Espíritu Santo. Clavada allí la bandera de Castilla, dejó el\r\nfuerte a cargo de su guarnición, subió hasta las cataratas del Iguazú, y\r\nluego, por diversas circunstancias regresó a España.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARLOS OCTAVIO BUNGE]\r\n\r\nDos años habían pasado desde la partida de Gaboto, y el fuerte del\r\nEspíritu Santo conservaba su paz inalterable. Gobernábalo un hombre de\r\ndistinguido mérito, don Nuño de Lara, en quien delegó Gaboto el mando.\r\nUna severa disciplina, sostenida por el ejemplo, quitaba a los suyos\r\ntoda[237] ocasión de desmandarse. Por su propia seguridad, los españoles\r\nmantenían pacífico trato con una vecina tribu de indios, los timbúes. La\r\nbuena inteligencia y los oficios de la cordialidad más expresiva\r\napretaban de día en día los nudos de esa útil alianza.\r\n\r\nHabía entre los españoles una dama, Lucía Miranda, mujer del soldado\r\nSebastián Hurtado. El cacique de los timbúes, Mangoré, prendado de su\r\nbelleza, olvidó que era casada y resolvió hacerla su esposa. Decidido a\r\nrobarla, preparó una horrible traición. Aprovechando una oportunidad en\r\nque salieron del fuerte, para procurarse víveres, buena parte de sus\r\npobladores, al mando de uno de los capitanes, presentóse como amigo,\r\nseguido de treinta indios cargados de subsistencias. Esperaba afuera sus\r\nórdenes, escondido en la maleza y bien adoctrinado, su hermano Siripo,\r\nal mando de numerosa horda.\r\n\r\nSin sospechar los ocultos designios del cacique, recibió el donativo muy\r\natento y agradecido don Nuño de Lara. Con su castellana generosidad,\r\nacogió a Mangoré y a su séquito bajo su mismo techo. Obsequióles con un\r\nespléndido festín, brindando confundidos españoles e indios al dios[238]\r\nde la amistad. Cuando terminó el festín recogiéronse a dormir unos y\r\notros. El sueño rindió a los españoles. Y, entrada ya la noche, en el\r\nsilencio[239] y las sombras, Mangoré cambió sigilosamente sus señas y\r\ncontraseñas con su hermano Siripo; hizo prender fuego a la sala de armas\r\ny abrió las puertas del fuerte. De común acuerdo, los indios de Mangoré\r\ny de Siripo cayeron sobre los españoles dormidos. Algunos de éstos\r\nlograron sus armas, trabándose en combate siniestro. Con increíble\r\nvalor, Lara repartía en cada golpe muchas muertes. En medio de la\r\nrefriega buscó y encontró al fin a Mangoré. Aunque con una flecha en el\r\ncostado, abrióse paso entre la confusa multitud hasta que pudo herir al\r\ntraidor. La flecha, entretanto, con el movimiento y la lucha, habíale\r\npenetrado hondamente. Ambos, el cacique indio y el denodado capitán\r\ncastellano, cayeron muertos. Sólo escaparon con vida del desastre\r\nalgunos niños y mujeres, entre ellas Lucía Miranda, su inocente causa.\r\nTodos fueron llevados a presencia de Siripo, sucesor del detestable\r\nMangoré, quien los guardó cautivos.\r\n\r\nAl siguiente día volvió al fuerte Sebastián Hurtado. Su dolor fué igual\r\na su sorpresa, cuando, después de encontrarse con ruinas en vez del\r\nbaluarte, buscaba a su consorte y sólo hallaba despojos de la muerte.\r\nLuego que supo su cautividad, no[240] dudó un punto entre los extremos\r\nde morir o rescatarla. Precipitadamente se escapó de los suyos y llegó\r\nhasta la presencia de Siripo. Pero este bárbaro, habiendo muerto\r\nMangoré, cacique él ahora de los timbúes, olvidóse como su finado\r\nhermano que Lucía era casada, y aspiraba a su vez a tomarla por esposa.\r\nYa que se le presentaba tan inopinadamente el legítimo marido, ardiendo\r\nen celos infernales, decidió matarlo. Comprendió la heroica mujer la\r\nsuerte que esperaba a Hurtado, y, estimando más la vida de su marido que\r\nla propia, renunció al tono altivo con que antes contestaba los avances\r\nde Siripo, y tomó a sus pies el tono de la súplica y el llanto. De tal\r\nmodo consiguió que el cacique revocara su sentencia de muerte y salvó la\r\nvida a Hurtado; mas con la dura condición de que el soldado castellano\r\nse divorciase para siempre de Lucía y eligiera otra esposa entre las\r\ndoncellas timbúes. Acaso por ganar partido en el corazón de la bella\r\nmujer blanca, que se mantenía firme en su resistencia a aceptarlo por\r\nesposo, el cacique llegó a permitirles[241] que se vieran de vez en\r\ncuando. No por eso consiguió el consentimiento de Lucía, que, como\r\nespañola y como cristiana, estaba resuelta a perder antes la existencia\r\nque la honra. Al contrario, en algunas de las breves entrevistas de los\r\nesposos, pudo notar que ambos renovaban sus juramentos de conyugal\r\nfidelidad. Entonces su furia no tuvo límites. Hizo atar a Sebastián\r\nHurtado a un árbol, donde se le mató a saetazos, y mandó arrojar[242] a\r\nLucía Miranda a una hoguera. Así, después de largo martirio y\r\ncautiverio, murieron ambos esposos, para eterno ejemplo de amor y de\r\nvirtud.\r\n\r\nVerdadera o fantástica, esta tradición ha perdurado en la mente de los\r\nhabitantes del río de la Plata. Dos siglos y medio después de que\r\nocurrió o pudo ocurrir el épico y luctuoso suceso, servía[243] él de\r\nargumento a una hermosa tragedia de corte clásico, en verso y tres\r\nactos, titulada _Siripo_. Su autor, el doctor Manuel José de Labardén,\r\nque nació en Buenos Aires en 1754 y murió probablemente poco antes de la\r\ngloriosa revolución de 1810, puede considerarse el más antiguo de los\r\npoetas cultos de la literatura argentina. Su obra, en sonoros\r\nhendecasílabos castellanos, representóse en el llamado _Corral_.\r\nComponíase este sitio, que[244] hacía las veces de teatro, de un terreno\r\nrodeado de un cerco o muralla baja y algún rancho en el fondo, para\r\nguardar sus vituallas o adminículos. Una chispa de un cohete disparado\r\nen la iglesia[245] de San Juan con motivo de celebrarse una fiesta\r\nreligiosa, ocasionó un incendio que redujo a cenizas el rancho. En el\r\nincendio se quemó el precioso manuscrito de la tragedia, conservándose\r\nsólo algunos largos fragmentos. Perdida la obra de Labardén, las sombras\r\nfamiliares y heroicas de Lucía Miranda, Sebastián Hurtado, Mangoré y\r\nSiripo esperan, pues, el poeta que las cante en las nuevas generaciones\r\nde argentinos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEL LUCERO DEL MANANTIAL\r\n\r\nEPISODIO DE LA DICTADURA DE DON JUAN MANUEL ROSAS\r\n\r\nMANUELA GORRITI\r\n\r\n\r\nI. María\r\n\r\nEra la hora en que calla el áspero relincho del potro salvaje; en que el\r\n\"cucuyo\" se adormece sobre el sinuoso tronco de los algarrobos, y en que\r\nel misterioso \"pacui\" comienza su lamentable[246] canto. La luna alzaba\r\nsu disco brillante tras los cardos de la inmensa llanura; y su argentado\r\nrayo, deslizándose entre el frondoso ramaje de los \"ombús\" y las góticas\r\nojivas de la ventana, bañaba con ardor el dulce rostro de María.\r\n\r\n¡Viajeros del Plata! En vuestras lejanas excursiones en las campañas,\r\n¿oísteis hablar de María?[247] Su recuerdo vive todavía en las\r\ntradiciones del Sur. María era la flor más bella que acarició la brisa\r\ntibia de la Pampa. Alta y esbelta como el junco azul de los arroyos,\r\nsemejábale también en su elegante flexibilidad. Sombreaba su hermosa\r\nfrente una espléndida cabellera que se extendía en negros espirales\r\nhasta la orla de su vestido. Sus ojos, en frecuente contemplación del\r\ncielo, habían robado a las estrellas su mágico fulgor; y su voz dulce y\r\nmelancólica como el postrer sonido del arpa, tenía inflecciones de\r\nentrañable ternura que conmovían el corazón como una caricia. Y cuando\r\nen el silencio de la noche se elevaba cantando las alabanzas del Señor,\r\nlos pastores de los vecinos campos se prosternaban creyendo escuchar la\r\nvoz de algún ángel extraviado en el espacio. El viajero que la divisaba\r\na lo lejos pasar envuelta en su blanco velo de virgen a la luz del\r\ncrepúsculo, bajo la sombra de los sauces, exclamaba: \"¡Es una hada!\"\r\nPero los habitantes del \"pago\" respondían: \"Es la hija del comandante,\r\nel _Lucero del Manantial_.\"\r\n\r\nEn los últimos confines de la frontera del Sur, cerca de la línea que\r\nsepara a los salvajes de las poblaciones cristianas, en el Pago del\r\nManantial y entre los muros de un fuerte medio arruinado, habitaba María\r\nal lado de su padre, entre los soldados de la guarnición. El adusto\r\nveterano, antiguo compañero de Artigas, sólo desarrugaba el ceño de su\r\nfrente surcada de cicatrices para sonreír a su hija. Para aquellos\r\nhombres hostigados por frecuentes invasiones y cuyos rostros tostados\r\npor el sol de la Pampa expresaban las inquietudes de una perpetua\r\nalarma, era María una blanca estrella que alegraba su vida derramando\r\nsobre ellos su luz consoladora.\r\n\r\nPero ella, que era la alegría de los otros, ¿por qué estaba triste? ¿Qué\r\nsombra había empañado el cristal purísimo de su alma? La hora del dolor\r\nhabía sonado para ella, y María pensaba,... pensaba en su amor.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Un Sueño\r\n\r\nUna noche vino a turbar una visión el plácido sueño de la virgen. Vió un\r\nvasto campo cubierto de tumbas medio abiertas y sembrado de cadáveres\r\ndegollados. De todos aquellos cuellos divididos manaban arroyos de\r\nsangre que, uniéndose en un profundo cauce, formaban un río cuyas rojas\r\nondas murmuraban lúgubres gemidos y se ensanchaban y subían como una\r\ninmensa marea. Entre el vapor mefítico de sus orillas y hollando con\r\nplanta segura el sangriento rostro de los muertos, paseábase un hombre\r\ncuyo brazo desnudo blandía un puñal.\r\n\r\nAquel hombre era bello; pero con una belleza sombría como la del\r\narcángel maldito; y en sus ojos azules como el cielo, brillaban\r\nrelámpagos siniestros que helaban de miedo. Y, sin embargo, una\r\natracción irresistible arrastró a María hacia aquel hombre y la hizo\r\ncaer en sus brazos. Y él, envolviéndola en su sombría mirada, abrasó sus\r\nlabios con un beso de fuego, y sonriendo diabólicamente rasgóla el pecho\r\ny la arrancó el corazón, que arrojó palpitante en tierra para partirlo\r\ncon su puñal. Pero ella, presa de un dolor sin nombre, se echó a sus\r\npies y abrazó sus rodillas con angustia. En ese momento se oyó una\r\ndetonación, y María, dando un grito se despertó.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. El Encuentro\r\n\r\n--¡Era un sueño!--exclamó palpando su pecho virginal, agitado todavía\r\npor los tumultuosos latidos de su corazón.--¡Era un sueño!\r\n\r\nY pasando la mano por su frente para alejar las últimas sombras del\r\nterrible sueño, María saltó del lecho, vistió sus ropas de fiesta,\r\ntrenzó con flores su larga cabellera, y sentada gallardamente sobre el\r\nlustroso lomo de un brioso alazán, dióse gozosa a correr por los frescos\r\noasis, sembrados como una vía láctea en las inmensas llanuras del Sur.\r\n\r\nDe repente el fogoso potro robado a las numerosas manadas de los\r\nsalvajes, aspirando con rabioso deleite las magnéticas emanaciones que\r\nel viento traía de su agreste patria, sacudió su larga crin, mordió el\r\nfreno, y burlando la débil mano que lo regía, partió veloz como una\r\nflecha, saltando zanjas y bebiendo el espacio. María, pálida de espanto,\r\nvióse arrebatar lejos del límite cristiano al través de las complicadas\r\nsendas que trillan los bárbaros con el afilado casco de sus corceles; y\r\nsu terror crecía a la vista de un bosque negro que terminaba el\r\nhorizonte, y entre cuyo ramaje el miedo dibujaba sombras confusas que se\r\nagitaban.\r\n\r\nDe improviso vibró en el aire un silbido extraño, semejante al chillido\r\nde un águila, y el caballo embolado por una mano invisible se abatió\r\nsobre sí mismo a tiempo que la joven se deslizaba al suelo sin sentido.\r\nAl volver en sí, se encontró reclinada en los brazos de un hombre y con\r\nla mejilla apoyada en su pecho. Ese hombre era sin duda quien la había\r\nsalvado; y María, separándose de sus brazos, alzó hacia él una mirada de\r\ngratitud. El joven era bello; pero al verlo María dió un grito y volvió\r\na caer exánime a los pies del incógnito.\r\n\r\nAquel hermoso joven era el fantasma de su sangriento sueño.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Amor y Agravio\r\n\r\nOcho días más tarde María, velando inquieta, con el oído atento y la\r\nmirada fija, medio desnuda y oculta tras las vetustas ojivas, esperaba\r\ntodas las noches a un hombre que, llegando cautelosamente al pie del\r\nombú, asíase a sus ramas, escalaba la ventana y caía en sus brazos. Y la\r\njoven lo estrechaba en ellos con pasión; y apartándolo luego de sí,\r\ncontemplábalo con delicia y volvía a arrojarse en sus brazos,\r\nexclamando: ¡Manuel! ¡Manuel! por qué te amo tanto, a ti que no sé quién\r\neres, a ti el terrible fantasma de mi sueño? Y, sin embargo, quien\r\nquiera que seas, vengas del cielo o del abismo, y, aunque despedaces mi\r\npecho y me arranques el corazón, ¡te amo! ¡te amo!\r\n\r\nY María deliraba de amor, hasta que la luz del alba le arrebataba a su\r\namante que, deslizándose furtivamente entre el obscuro ramaje, se\r\ndesvanecía con las sombras.\r\n\r\nPero una vez María lo esperó en vano. Y desde entonces, cada noche, sola\r\ny con el corazón palpitante de dolorosa ansiedad, vió pasar sobre su\r\ncabeza y perderse en el horizonte todos los astros del cielo, sin que\r\naquél que alumbraba su alma volviera a aparecer jamás.\r\n\r\nPor ese tiempo, la antorcha de la guerra civil abrasó aquellas comarcas,\r\ny el fragor del cañón homicida ahogó las risas y los gemidos.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Dieciséis Años Después\r\n\r\nEn las últimas horas de un día de verano, una silla de posta atravesó\r\nrápidamente las calles de Buenos Aires, y entró en el patio de una\r\nhermosa casa en la calle de la Victoria. Un hombre de porte distinguido\r\nque, asomado al balcón, parecía[248] esperar con impaciencia, bajó\r\npresuroso, y adelantándose al cochero, corrió a abrir la portezuela del\r\ncarruaje, tendiendo los brazos a una bellísima mujer que se arrojó a su\r\ncuello: ¡Mi amada María!--¡Amigo mío!--exclamaron ambos a la vez\r\nestrechándose con ternura.\r\n\r\n--¿Y mi hijo?... ¿Mi Enrique?--dijo de pronto la dama arrancándose de\r\nlos brazos de su marido y tendiendo en torno una codiciosa mirada.\r\n\r\n--Nuestro hijo, respondió él haciéndola entrar en un magnífico\r\nsalón,--nuestro hijo,--amada mía, se halla en esta hora en el momento\r\nmás solemne de su vida escolar: da un brillante examen. Acabo de dejarlo\r\ntriplemente coronado; pero el premio más grato será el beso de su madre.\r\n\r\n--¡Querido niño! ¿Es tan bello como a los doce años? ¡Oh!...\r\n¡Alberto!... ¡Perdón!\r\n\r\n--¿Perdón? ¿Y de qué?, amada María. ¿De ser una buena madre como eres\r\nuna buena esposa? ¡Al contrario!, gracias por el amor que guardas para\r\nese hijo cuya ternura ha alumbrado los tristes días de tu ausencia en\r\nlos cinco años que me has dejado aquí sólo. ¡Ah! ¿Qué placer encontrabas\r\nen habitar Córdoba, lejos de tu hijo... lejos de tu esposo?\r\n\r\n--¡Oh! ¡Alberto, noble y generoso corazón!--exclamó ella doblando una\r\nrodilla ante su marido.\r\n\r\nAlberto la alzó en sus brazos: ¡Todavía esa injusta timidez! ¡Todavía\r\nesos importunos recuerdos! Me habéis prometido desecharlos y[249] ser\r\nfeliz.\r\n\r\n--Y soy dichosa, amigo mío. ¿Quién no lo sería cerca de ti? Pero, a\r\nmedida que el tiempo pasa, la audaz confianza de la juventud desaparece,\r\nreemplazándola medrosos recelos. ¿Será falta de[250] fe? No, pues yo\r\ncreo en ti como en el Dios del cielo; pero mientras más grande, mientras\r\nmás[251] sublime me aparecías, menos digna me encontraba de acercarme a\r\nti, y lo que tú llamas obstinación era un doloroso ostracismo.\r\n\r\n--¡Pobre María! ¡Que nunca te oiga hablar así! ¡nunca! Te lo pido en\r\nnombre de tu hijo. Toca este corazón; es tu más firme apoyo. Reposa\r\nconfiada sobre él, pues sólo alienta para ti.[252]\r\n\r\n--¡Oh! ¡Dios mío!--dijo ella reclinándose en el seno de su marido, y\r\nelevando al cielo una mirada de gratitud.--¡Dios mío!, bendito seas\r\nporque has enviado al mundo degenerado que te reniega, estos seres de\r\npaz, de indulgencia y de amor para redimir su iniquidad y hacernos creer\r\nque en verdad formaste al hombre a tu divina imagen. Dieciséis años han\r\npasado, dieciséis años... y en cada uno de esos días, en cada una de\r\nesas horas ví brotar en ese corazón, elevarse y resplandecer, alguna\r\nnueva virtud. Dieciséis años hace encontréme un día abandonada, sola\r\nentre mi dolor y un secreto terrible. La muerte era mi único recurso;\r\npero yo no podía morir. Junto a mi corazón desgarrado palpitaba otro\r\ncorazón que me pedía la vida y me encadenaba a una existencia de\r\noprobio. Tú me apareciste entonces, Alberto.--Te amo, me dijiste, y mi\r\namor ha penetrado el secreto de tu dolor. ¿Quieres confiarte en mí? Yo\r\nseré tu esposo, tu amigo, y..., me dijiste al oído, el padre de tu hijo.\r\n\r\n--¡Y bien! ¡Y bien!--la interrumpió Alberto, con esa brusca genialidad\r\nde las almas generosas, para velar su grandeza.--¡Vaya un gran\r\nmérito![253] ¡Cumplir con una misión que nos haga feliz!\r\nDesgraciadamente, amada mía, no siempre es tan fácil conciliar el deber\r\ncon la felicidad. Hoy, por ejemplo, colocado entre el amor y la\r\nconciencia, voy a sacrificar al deber la dulce costumbre de una antigua\r\namistad. Yo que hasta ahora he sostenido a mi amigo con todos los\r\nrecursos de mi influencia, voy a enarbolar contra él el estandarte de la\r\noposición; y el cuerpo legislativo, que actualmente presido, me verá con\r\nasombro alzarme contra el voto que pretende dar a Rosas la facultad de\r\nreunir todos los poderes del Estado.\r\n\r\nA estas palabras de su esposo, María palideció.\r\n\r\n--¡Oh! ¡Alberto!--dijo, estrechando su mano con terror,--en nombre del\r\ncielo no toques la garra del tigre porque te despedazará!... Te\r\ndespedazará y hará de tu cadáver una grada más para escalar la cima del\r\npoder.\r\n\r\n--Y bien, amiga mía, moriría con la muerte de los buenos en el\r\ncumplimiento del deber. Pero tranquilízate, amada María; Rosas tiene un\r\nalma capaz de comprender mi sacrificio y me conservará su estimación,\r\naunque me haya quitado su amistad.\r\n\r\nEn ese momento un ujier anunció a Alberto que la cámara reunida esperaba\r\na su presidente para[254] discutir la importante cuestión del día.\r\nAlberto despidió al ujier y volvió hacia su mujer una mirada de ternura.\r\n\r\n--¿Lo veis, querida mía?--le dijo,--mi sacrificio comienza desde ahora.\r\nApenas he tenido tiempo de posar mis ojos en tu semblante, la voz del\r\ndeber me llama lejos de tí; y aunque sea por muy pocas horas, toda\r\nseparación en este momento me parece eterna....\r\n\r\nAlberto se interrumpió. Habríase dicho que sus palabras encontraron\r\nalgún eco misterioso en el fondo de su alma. Pero reponiéndose luego\r\ndijo a su esposa sonriendo:--Te dejo, amiga mía; pero voy a enviarte a\r\nEnrique y él desvanecerá para siempre esos importunos recuerdos que\r\nturban todavía la paz de tu alma.\r\n\r\nY besando tiernamente la mano que ella le tendía, salió no sin volverse\r\nmuchas veces para contemplarla.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Madre e Hijo\r\n\r\nCuando la dama quedó sola alzó los ojos al cielo con dolorosa\r\nexpresión.--¡Jamás!--exclamó, ¡Jamás!... ¡Nunca se borrará esa imagen\r\nque encuentro siempre en el horizonte de mis recuerdos, en el semblante\r\nde mi hijo y en mi propio corazón! ¡He ahí esa frente altiva y\r\nmeditabunda! ¡He ahí esos rasgados ojos azules de tan sombría y sin\r\nembargo tan hermosa mirada!... ¡Manuel! ¡Manuel!\r\n\r\nLa puerta se abrió con estrépito, y un hermoso mancebo de dieciséis\r\naños, de porte arrogante y risueña expresión, se precipitó en la sala y\r\ncorrió a arrojarse en los brazos de la dama que lo estrechó en ellos\r\nsollozando y besó mil veces sus mejillas y su frente.\r\n\r\n--¡Qué hermosa eres, mamá!--decía el joven, contemplando extasiado el\r\nradioso semblante de su madre.--Aunque tenía muy presentes las facciones\r\nde tu rostro, no creía que fueras tan bella. ¡Bendición del cielo![255]\r\n¡Dejar la fría[256] atmósfera del colegio para venir a contemplar los\r\nrayos de este bello sol que da vida a mi vida y calor a mi alma!\r\n\r\n--¡Poeta! ¡Poeta!--decía ella, sonriendo tiernamente a su hijo y\r\nmeciéndolo como un niño en sus rodillas.--Me está recitando un madrigal.\r\n\r\n--A propósito,--dijo el joven dejando su actitud de abandono y\r\nsentándose al lado de su madre.--Manuela Rosas me envió su álbum\r\npidiéndome[257] un soneto. ¡Y lo había olvidado! ¡Ya! la veo tan pocas\r\nveces. Y no porque ella no sea una criatura amabilísima; pero me aleja\r\nde su lado el extraño sentimiento que me inspira su padre. Llamaríalo\r\nodio si su amistad con la mía no hicieran[258] el odio imposible.\r\n\r\n--Todavía no conozco a ese hombre, y sin embargo me estremezco cuando\r\noigo pronunciar su nombre; y no comprendo como el noble y bondadoso\r\ncorazón de Alberto ha podido unirse a ese corazón feroz y sanguinario.\r\n\r\n--Esta misma adhesión, madre mía, realza más la magnanimidad de ese\r\ncorazón generoso, porque está exento de debilidad. Severa con el amigo,\r\njamás transigirá con el tirano.\r\n\r\n--¡Ay! sí, es verdad... pero heme aquí estremecida de espanto a la idea\r\nde esa austera integridad[259] que en este momento subleva quizá contra\r\nél en la[260] cámara legislativa el bando entero del despotismo.\r\n\r\n--¡Qué!--exclamó el joven con los ojos centelleantes de entusiasmo, es\r\nhoy el día de su triunfo, y aun no estoy en la barra para aplaudirlo con\r\nla voz y con el alma.\r\n\r\nY besando rápidamente a su madre, desasióse de su convulsivo brazo y\r\npartió.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. En la Sala de Representantes\r\n\r\nEn ese día la sala de representantes de Buenos Aires presenció una\r\nescena digna de los mejores tiempos de la Roma heroica. Rosas, armado\r\ncon la clave del terror, habiendo impuesto silencio al pueblo, y hecho\r\ntambién callar al cuerpo legislativo, quiso dar el último golpe a la\r\ndignidad nacional, y aspiró a la dictadura. Aspirar en él era mandar; y\r\nun día oyóse la sacrílega proposición en el santuario de las leyes.\r\nNinguna voz se alzó para combatirla. Cada representante veía en el\r\nsemblante de su vecino el triunfo del miedo sobre la conciencia, y si\r\nllevaba su mirada a lo[261] alto de la sala encontraba bajo el dosel que\r\nla dominaba al amigo, al confidente de Rosas... y callaba.\r\n\r\nEl presidente invitó a sus colegas a dar sus votos, ordenando que los\r\nque estuvieran por la proposición, se pusieran en pie; y con rostro\r\napacible dió la señal. Dos hombres únicamente votaron en contra. El uno\r\nera Escalada, el inmaculado obispo de la metrópoli. El otro era... el\r\npresidente de la sala, el amigo de Rosas.\r\n\r\nHubo un momento de asombro y silencio: pero cuando la barra arrebatada\r\nde entusiasmo prorrumpió en una tempestad de aplausos, cuatro hombres\r\nenmascarados precipitáronse en la sala, y mientras tres de ellos\r\nrodearon la mesa del presidente, el cuarto hundió un puñal en el corazón\r\nde Alberto y huyó dejándolo clavado en el seno de su víctima.\r\n\r\nEntonces en medio del silencio de horror que reinó en aquel recinto,\r\noyóse la voz del anciano obispo, que, de pie aún, dijo alzando sobre el\r\nmoribundo su mano venerable:--¡Sube al cielo, mártir de la libertad\r\nargentina! Yo te absuelvo en nombre de Dios y de la patria.--Y como si\r\nla noble alma de Alberto hubiera esperado aquella sublime bendición,\r\nexhalóse dulcemente en una triste sonrisa.\r\n\r\nEn aquel momento Enrique, que entraba en el peristilo de la sala de\r\nsesiones, fué atropellado por cuatro hombres que huían desolados\r\nentre[262] las sombras. El intrépido niño, conociendo por sus máscaras\r\nque acababan de cometer un crimen, asió al que iba delante; pero éste\r\npor medio de un violento esfuerzo logró escaparse, aunque dejando en las\r\nmanos de su adversario la máscara que lo cubría. Al ver el rostro de\r\naquel hombre el joven dió un grito, y se precipitó en la sala. A la\r\nvista del cadáver de su padre, Enrique se detuvo un momento, inmóvil,\r\nmudo, con los puños cerrados y la mirada fija. Luego, cayendo de\r\nrodillas, arrancó de su pecho el puñal homicida, y besando la herida con\r\nsiniestra serenidad,--¡Adiós, padre mío!--dijo estrechando la mano\r\nhelada del muerto,--muy luego me reuniré contigo; pero entonces te habré\r\nvengado.\r\n\r\nGuardó en su seno el arma ensangrentada y se alejó con firmes pasos.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. El Terrible Drama\r\n\r\nLa luz del siguiente día encontró en las calles de Buenos Aires\r\nnumerosas huellas de escenas semejantes a la que tuvo lugar en la noche\r\nanterior en la sala de representantes. Un puñal había amenazado la vida\r\nde Rosas; aunque se había arrestado al delincuente, no habiendo podido\r\narrancarle confesión alguna, había sacrificado indistintamente a todas\r\npersonas sospechosas de complicidad en aquel atentado.\r\n\r\nA dos leguas de distancia, al frente del palacio dictatorial de Palermo,\r\nun destacamento de infantería[263] acababa de hacer alto. Sonó el tambor\r\ny aquella fuerza se formó en cuadro. Vióse entonces en el centro del\r\nsiniestro vacío un joven como Isaac, y maniatado como él, y en frente\r\ncuatro[264] soldados que a la voz de un oficial preparaban sus armas.\r\n\r\nPero, cuando los fatales fusiles se inclinaron sobre él, cuando con la\r\nfrente erguida y la mirada serena el noble mancebo esperaba la muerte,\r\noyóse un grito de suprema angustia y una mujer pálida, anhelante,\r\ndesmelenada, rompiendo con esfuerzo febril la línea de bayonetas que le\r\ncerraba el paso, se arrojó de repente sobre el joven y estrechándolo en\r\nun abrazo desesperado lo cubrió con todo su cuerpo. Los soldados,\r\nvivamente conmovidos, volviéronse hacia el oficial que los mandaba. Pero\r\néste que sentía pesar sobre sí una terrible responsabilidad, ahogando su\r\nprofunda emoción, mandó apartar a la madre y conducirla fuera del\r\ncuadro.\r\n\r\n--¡Ah!--exclamó ella arrancándose de los brazos de su hijo y cayendo a\r\nlos pies del oficial.--Dadme al menos por lo que más améis en este\r\nmundo, dadme un cuarto de hora que necesito para obtener la gracia de mi\r\nhijo, o morir.\r\n\r\nEl veterano sonrió tristemente:--Id, pobre madre, id--dijo siguiéndola\r\ncon una mirada de compasión.\r\n\r\n--En nombre de esta hora suprema,--gritó el niño,--yo os lo prohibo,\r\nmadre mía. No pidáis gracia al asesino de vuestro esposo, o vuestro hijo\r\nos maldecirá desde la eternidad.\r\n\r\nMas ella sin escucharlo corrió desolada hacia el[265] palacio. Atravesó,\r\nsin que nadie pudiera detenerla, los patios, los vestíbulos, las\r\ngalerías y los salones, preguntando a su paso por aquél de quien\r\nesperaba la muerte o la vida. Un edecán entreabrió un gabinete y la\r\nmostró un hombre que apoyado en[266] una mesa ocultaba su rostro entre\r\nlas manos. La desventurada, precipitándose en el cuarto, fué a caer a\r\nsus pies. Pero al mirar a aquel hombre el ruego se le heló en su labio\r\npálido que se movió sin articular sonido alguno.\r\n\r\nEn ese momento sonó una detonación. La infeliz madre cayó sin sentido\r\ngritando:--¡Manuel! ¡Manuel! ¿Qué has hecho de tu hijo?...\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. Conclusión\r\n\r\nMucho tiempo hacía que el antiguo fuerte de la Pampa era ya sólo un\r\nmontón de escombros ennegrecidos por el humo del incendio. Los indios en\r\nuna salida lo habían quemado, asesinando al viejo comandante con toda la\r\nguarnición. Desde entonces el doble silencio de la muerte y del abandono\r\nreinó en torno de aquellos muros, y el terror supersticioso que\r\ninspiraban las ruinas apartó de allí los pasos del viajero.\r\n\r\nSin embargo, una noche, al alzarse la luna sobre el horizonte, los\r\nhabitantes del \"pago\" vieron una mujer pálida, enflaquecida y\r\narrastrando negros cendales, que atravesó gimiendo las avenidas de\r\nsauces y se perdió entre las desmoronadas murallas del fuerte.\r\n\r\nAlgunos la tuvieron por una aparición; pero otros creyeron conocer en\r\nella a María, la hija del viejo comandante, el bello _Lucero del\r\nManantial_.\r\n\r\nLIMA, agosto de 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOS 3000 PESOS DE DORREGO\r\n\r\nC. O. BUNGE\r\n\r\n\r\nEra en el año nefasto de 1820, el año de agudísima crisis,\r\nrevolucionaria más bien que política. En la provincia de Buenos Aires\r\ncambiábase cada día, puede decirse, de gobernador. Siendo gobernador el\r\nseñor Ramos Mejía, partidario del directorio, el general Soler, enemigo\r\ndel sistema, habíale depuesto, asumiendo el mando. Retiróse luego el\r\nnuevo gobernador al campamento de Luján, donde estableció su sede.\r\nDejaba en Buenos[267] Aires, como su lugarteniente, en el cargo de\r\ncomandante general de armas, al coronel Dorrego. Y para concluir con los\r\nunitarios, puso a precio las cabezas de los principales representantes\r\ndel régimen directorial.\r\n\r\nEntre ellos se contaba el doctor Tagle, cuya persona se tasó en 3000\r\npesos. Espíritu inquieto y combatiente, habíase arriesgado a venir de su\r\nvoluntario ostracismo en el Uruguay a la misma ciudad de Buenos Aires.\r\nOcultábase en la casa de un amigo, el señor Marín. Su situación era\r\nharto peligrosa, pudiendo ser reconocido y denunciado[268] en cualquier\r\nmomento, hasta por la servidumbre. Además, agravábase esa situación por\r\nsu personal y mortal enemistad con el coronel Dorrego, a quien había\r\ninsultado con la virulencia de las pasiones políticas de aquel tiempo\r\nsemibárbaro.\r\n\r\nTemiendo una sorpresa trágica y fatal para su huésped, el señor Marín\r\nresolvió salvarle dando un paso audaz y decisivo. Conocía a Dorrego y\r\nconfiaba en su caballerosidad. Sin comunicar su proyecto al doctor\r\nTagle, fué a ver al comandante general en el piso bajo del Cabildo,\r\ndonde se hallaba. Amigo también de Dorrego, díjole, medio[269] en serio\r\ny medio en broma: \"Sé que estás en apurada situación financiera y vengo\r\na ofrecerte la oportunidad de ganar 3000 pesos.\" Como en efecto, por las\r\ncontinuas revoluciones y violencias, escaseaba el dinero, Dorrego\r\ncontestó agradecido[270] por el ofrecimiento. No disponía en ese\r\ninstante de un peso, ni propio ni del Estado, para pagar a las tropas.\r\nEl señor Marín anuncióle entonces que tenía al doctor Tagle en su casa.\r\nDorrego se limitó a responder: \"Muy bien. Esta noche iré a buscarlo.\"\r\n\r\nSin cambiar más razones, el señor Marín se retiró. Aunque tuviera plena\r\nconfianza en la lealtad de Dorrego, una duda vaga se apoderó de su\r\nespíritu. ¿Y si el comandante general, llevado al mismo tiempo por el\r\nantagonismo político y la necesidad de dinero, entregaba al general\r\nSoler la cabeza del doctor Tagle? Los hombres más rectos tienen momentos\r\nde ofuscación; y entonces todos parecían ofuscados por la sangrienta\r\nlucha política....\r\n\r\nDe vuelta en su casa, el señor Marín se sentó[271] a conversar y tomar\r\nmate con el doctor Tagle. Estaba distraído y preocupado. Notándolo su\r\nhuésped, le preguntó la causa de sus cavilaciones. No pudo callar por\r\nmás tiempo el señor Marín, y le enteró de su diligencia. Pálido como un\r\nmuerto, el doctor Tagle exclamó: \"Estoy perdido.\" Quiso huir en ese\r\nmomento; pero como era su proyecto harto imprudente, el señor Marín le\r\ndetuvo en su casa. Librado a la hidalguía de Dorrego, corría alguna\r\nprobabilidad de salvarse; de otro modo, su pérdida era segura....\r\n\r\nNo tuvieron tiempo para deliberar largamente, porque apenas anocheciera\r\npresentóse el coronel Dorrego en la casa del señor Marín. \"Aquí está el\r\ndoctor Tagle\", dijo, y entró seguido de su ordenanza. Más muerto que\r\nvivo, presentóse el doctor Tagle. Dorrego tomó un capote de manos de su\r\nordenanza, y le dijo: \"Póngaselo.\" El doctor se lo puso. En la puerta\r\nhabía dos caballos ensillados, el del coronel y el del ordenanza.\r\nMontando en el suyo, Dorrego dijo al doctor Tagle: \"Monte a caballo y\r\nvéngase conmigo.\" Y el doctor Tagle montó en el caballo del ordenanza,\r\nconvencido ya de que sólo le esperaban cuatro tiros.\r\n\r\nA galope tendido cruzaron la ciudad de Sur a Norte. Llegaron, en la\r\nnoche cerrada, al bajo de Palermo. En la orilla del río les esperaba una\r\nembarcación a vela, aparejada para partir. \"Embárquese y póngase en\r\nsalvo[272] en la Colonia\",[273] ordenó Dorrego a su acompañante.\r\nConmovido por su grandeza de alma, el doctor Tagle le observó: \"Yo he\r\nsido y soy su enemigo, coronel.\"--\"En el campo de batalla\", contestó\r\nDorrego, \"no hubiera vacilado en matarle; aquí, sólo un mal caballero\r\npodría aprovecharse de haberle hallado huído e indefenso.\" El doctor\r\nTagle insistió: \"Pierde usted, coronel, 3000 pesos que necesita.\" Y el\r\ncoronel Dorrego, montando de nuevo a caballo y despidiéndose, repuso con\r\nsencillez: \"Todo el oro del mundo no bastaría para comprar la lealtad de\r\nun militar argentino.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUMPLIR LA CONSIGNA\r\n\r\nC. O. BUNGE (Según Juan M. Espora)\r\n\r\n\r\nInspeccionando una mañana el campamento de Mendoza, San Martín se detuvo\r\nante una puerta[274] cerrada y revestida de pieles de carnero con la\r\nlana para afuera.... Custodiábala un centinela. \"¿Qué es esto?,\"\r\npreguntó a los sargentos que le acompañaban.--\"El laboratorio de los\r\nmixtos\", le respondieron.--\"¿Se trabaja[275] ahora?\"--\"Sí, señor. Se\r\nestán haciendo cartuchos, lanzafuegos, estopines, espoletas para\r\ngranadas y otras municiones.\"--Sin averiguar más, dirigióse allí el\r\ngeneral en actitud de entrar. \"¡Alto ahí!\", exclamó el centinela,\r\nponiéndosele delante. \"No se puede entrar.\" A esta observación, San\r\nMartín le preguntó con vehemencia: \"¿Cómo es eso? ¿No me conoces?\"--\"Sí,\r\nseñor, lo conozco; pero así no se puede entrar\", repitió el soldado,\r\nrefiriéndose al traje militar que vestía el general, con botas herradas\r\ny pesadas espuelas. Volvió a insinuar San Martín su ademán de abrir la\r\npuerta. El centinela caló entonces la bayoneta, y repitió de nuevo: \"Ya\r\nhe dicho, mi general, que así no se puede entrar.\" Y gritó con fuerza:\r\n\"¡Cabo de guardia! ¡El general en jefe quiere forzar el puesto!\" Al ver\r\nesto, uno de los sargentos corrió al cuerpo de guardia a llamar al cabo.\r\nLlegó el cabo, y dijo al general: \"Señor, el centinela tiene la consigna\r\nde no dejar pasar a nadie al laboratorio vestido de uniforme, para no\r\nocasionar un incendio. Si mi general quiere visitarlo, para hacerlo en\r\nla forma permitida, sírvase pasar antes a ese otro cuarto y mudarse la\r\nropa.\" Nada respondió el general, entró en el cuarto indicado, quitóse\r\nel uniforme, y se puso un par de alpargatas y saco y gorro de brin.\r\nLuego visitó el laboratorio e inspeccionó sus trabajos. Cuando se\r\nretiraba, habiéndose vestido de nuevo el uniforme, pasó por el\r\ncuerpo[276] de guardia y ordenó que, después de relevarse, se le mandara\r\na su despacho al soldado que hacía de centinela. Cumplió el soldado la\r\norden y se presentó, temeroso de haber merecido una admonición. Pero al\r\nverle entrar, el general en jefe se puso de pie y le tendió la mano para\r\nfelicitarle calurosamente. Al obedecer a su consigna había cumplido su\r\ndeber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA LEALTAD DE SAN MARTÍN\r\n\r\nC. O. BUNGE (Según Juan M. Espora)\r\n\r\n\r\nHallábase el general San Martín en el campamento de Mendoza. El edecán\r\nde servicio en la[277] antesala de su tienda de campaña, entró un día en\r\nsu escritorio, anunciándole:--\"Un oficial pregunta por el ciudadano don\r\nJosé de San Martín.\"--\"Hágale usted entrar.\"--Entró el oficial,\r\nratificándose en que venía a ver al ciudadano, y[278] no al general en\r\njefe.--\"Puede usted hablar\", le dijo San Martín.--\"Vengo a confiarme a\r\nusted como un hijo a su padre\", balbuceó el oficial. \"Soy habilitado de\r\nmi cuerpo. Ayer recibí de la comisaría de guerra, para socorro de los\r\noficiales y soldados, una suma de dinero. Llevábala a su destino, cuando\r\nentré por mi desgracia a saludar a un oficial amigo mío que se halla\r\nenfermo. Varios compañeros estaban jugando a los naipes en su aposento.\r\nMe invitaron a acompañarles. Al principio rehusé. Luego quise tentar la\r\nsuerte. Resolví jugar la pequeña suma que me correspondía como oficial\r\nde la cantidad total que me fuera entregada. Como debo al sastre, a la\r\nlavandera y a varios proveedores, no pudiendo pagar mis deudas con esa\r\npequeña suma, ocurrióseme que, si lograba duplicarla o triplicarla,\r\nsaldría de apuros. El caso es que la perdí. Ofuscado por el golpe,\r\nquiero reponer la pérdida, juego de nuevo, y vuelvo a perder.... En fin,\r\narriesgué todo lo que llevaba, y ¡lo perdí todo!... He pasado la noche\r\nvagando por los alrededores del campamento como un loco. Estoy\r\ndeshonrado. ¡Ruégole, señor, que se apiade de mi situación y salve mi\r\nhonor! Yo le pagaré después como pueda, aunque sea sirviéndole de\r\ncriado. ¡Lo que no quiero es que no se me ajusticie[279] como ladrón, y\r\nllegue luego la noticia a mi pobre madre!... \"El general San Martín le\r\ncontestó, después de una pausa: \"Como general estaría obligado a hacerle\r\nenjuiciar ante el consejo de guerra.... Pero usted se ha confiado a mi\r\nlealtad y me promete enmendarse....\" Y tiró una gaveta de su escritorio,\r\nsacó en onzas de oro de su propio peculio la suma que el oficial le\r\npedía, y, al entregársela, le dijo: \"Vaya usted y en el acto entregue\r\nese dinero en la caja de su cuerpo. ¡Que en su vida se vuelva a repetir\r\nun[280] pasaje semejante!... Y, sobre todo, guarde usted en el más\r\nprofundo secreto el asunto de esta entrevista, porque si alguna vez el\r\ngeneral San Martín llega a saber que usted ha revelado algo de lo\r\nocurrido, en el acto le manda fusilar.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAVALLE EN RÍO BAMBA\r\n\r\nPEDRO LACASA\r\n\r\n\r\nEl combate de Río Bamba es el choque de[281] caballería más lucido que\r\nhaya tenido lugar en la guerra de nuestra emancipación, y el que ha\r\nrevelado también a más alto grado el renombre de bravo que llevaba el\r\nejército de los Andes, en los gloriosos tiempos que dejamos a la\r\nespalda. En él se vió al intrépido Lavalle con 96 granaderos[282]\r\narrollar cuatro escuadrones, fuertes cada uno de 120 hombres, de las\r\nmejores tropas del Rey, hasta meterlos a sablazos bajo los fuegos de\r\nla[283] infantería, habiendo pasado antes por la villa de[284] Río\r\nBamba, que estaba interpuesta entre los dos ejércitos, para desafiar a\r\nla caballería enemiga. Ésta con la intención de alejarlo de toda\r\nprotección, no salía de la pequeña planicie que está al pie de las\r\nalturas que coronan aquel pueblo, y a las cuales quería atraer al\r\ngeneral Sucre el jefe[285] español, para batirlo con ventaja.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUAN LAVALLE\r\n\r\n_Navarro y Lamarca, Historia general de América_]\r\n\r\nLa posición de Lavalle, en ese día, era tanto más conspicua, cuanto que\r\nestaba peleando por primera vez con una fuerza cuatro veces mayor que la\r\nsuya, en presencia de los orgullosos soldados de Colombia, y contra la\r\nvoluntad del general en jefe, que en esos momentos lo acusaba de\r\nimprudente, por haber comprometido un choque en que tenía que combatir\r\nuno contra cinco, y del cual, según él, no podía salir victorioso. En\r\nprueba de lo que dejamos dicho, citaremos las[286] palabras que el\r\ncoronel Ibarra, sobrino del libertador Bolívar, dirigió al general Sucre\r\nen aquellos momentos supremos, y sus contestaciones, sacadas de los\r\napuntes del coronel del ejército de los Andes, don Juan Espinosa,\r\npublicadas en el _Correo Peruano_ del 23 de mayo de 1846. Después de la\r\nprimera carga que Lavalle dió a los españoles, y en la cual llegó hasta\r\ntiro y medio de fusil, los granaderos se retiraron al tranco. Entonces\r\nel general enemigo organizó los cuatro escuadrones que habían sido\r\nacuchillados momentos antes, y los hizo cargar poniéndose él mismo a la\r\ncabeza. Lavalle, cuando estaban a cien pasos a su retaguardia, volvió\r\ncaras por pelotones, y cargó al centro de los cuatro escuadrones. En\r\neste momento el general Sucre creyó perdidos a los granaderos por la\r\nimprudencia de su jefe, \"_y no quiso protegerlos_\", dice Espinosa, \"_por\r\nno comprometer una acción general para la cual no estaba preparado, y\r\npor ser muy avanzada la hora_\". A[287] las repetidas instancias que le\r\nhicieron de proteger al escuadrón con alguna infantería, contestó: \"El\r\ncomandante Lavalle ha querido perderse, que se pierda solo.\" El coronel\r\nIbarra, sobrino del Libertador y un valiente de primera clase, le dijo:\r\n\"Mi general, déjeme V. S. ir con mis guías en protección de los\r\ngranaderos, y yo le respondo del triunfo\"; y saltándosele las\r\nlágrimas,[288] añadió: \"¡Cómo se pierde un escuadrón tan[289] valiente!\r\nmi general, permítamelo V. S.\" El[290] general Sucre, con una calma\r\ninalterable, le contestó: \"Coronel Ibarra, aquí el único responsable soy\r\nyo; pero vaya V. y haga su deber.\"\r\n\r\nPoníanse recién al galope los denodados guías[291] de Colombia, cuando\r\nlos bizarros granaderos decidían la victoria, sin que les cupiese más\r\nque a[292] cincuenta de esos bravos ayudar a recoger los laureles, que\r\nlos inmortales granaderos habían alcanzado, segando cabezas españolas\r\ncon el corvo de los Andes, en aquel anfiteatro de la Edad Media.[293]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEL OMBÚ\r\n\r\nMARCOS SASTRE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNA VISTA DE LA PAMPA\r\n\r\n_Fraser, The Amazing Argentine_]\r\n\r\nEl ombú es el único objeto que se eleva sobre la dilatada pampa,\r\ndestruyendo la monotonía de ese océano de verdura. Sus abultadas raíces\r\nque se levantan en una enorme masa cónica, base de un tronco, imitan\r\nlas rocas, simulando en los huecos de su seno sombrías cavernas que\r\npueden servir de cómoda habitación en el desierto. Casi siempre su\r\npresencia indica desde muy lejos la morada humana al caminante\r\nextraviado, que apresura hacia él sus pasos para gozar el seguro reposo\r\ndel rancho hospitalario de nuestros campos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UN OMBÚ\r\n\r\n_Karsten und Schenck, Vegetationsbilder_]\r\n\r\nEn las dilatadas llanuras sin camino, el ombú es el norte del viajero, y\r\nlevantándose sobre la planicie de las costas del Plata, en forma de\r\ncolinas invariables como las montañas, es el guía seguro del navegante\r\npara tomar el puerto, evitando los bajíos peligrosos.\r\n\r\nUno de los caracteres distintivos del ombú es su longevidad dilatada,\r\ncondición requerida en un ser que con dificultad se reproduce. No se\r\nconoce el término de su vida, nadie ha visto hasta ahora un ombú seco de\r\nvejez, no hay tradición que recuerde la edad juvenil de algunos. Por\r\nlas[294] enormes dimensiones de muchos de ellos con treinta varas de\r\ncircunferencia en su monstruosa raíz, y diez en su tronco, puede\r\njuzgarse que tienen miles de años de existencia....\r\n\r\nAdemás de su extraordinaria longevidad, tiene el ombú tal fortaleza, que\r\nno hay huracán que lo derribe, y es su vitalidad tan prodigiosa que ni\r\nla sequedad ni el fuego tienen poder para destruirlo. Si por acaso algún\r\nviolento torbellino llega a destrozar su copa, muy pronto se rehace con\r\nasombroso vigor y lozanía....\r\n\r\nÉl ha resistido las sequías destructoras que, de tiempo en tiempo, han\r\nasolado las campiñas....\r\n\r\nEl ombú prospera en los lugares más áridos y en toda clase de terrenos,\r\ncon tal que no tenga una humedad excesiva. Sólo se multiplica por la\r\nsemilla, y es preciso, mientras es pequeño, ponerlo a cubierto de las\r\nheladas. Trasplantándolo joven, no requiere ya ningún otro cuidado, ni\r\nel de riego, y a los cuatro o cinco años es un árbol frondoso.\r\n\r\nNo hay árbol como el ombú para formar umbrosas alamedas y avenidas\r\narboladas. La naturaleza de nuestro clima, madrastra de los[295] árboles\r\nexóticos, parece que les niega el sustento; exigen la solicitud y\r\nconstante atención del hombre. El ombú, su hijo predilecto, prospera\r\nadmirablemente sin necesidad de sus cuidados. Y, ¿cuál es el árbol de\r\notros climas, que aventaja a nuestro ombú en frondosidad, majestad,\r\nhermosura? Bien puede herir su copa un sol abrasador, bien puede\r\nfaltarle el refrigerio de los rocíos y el alimento de las lluvias, no\r\npor eso dará paso a un solo rayo del astro, ni soltará a una sola de sus\r\nhojas; mientras que los demás árboles languidecen, se agosta su follaje\r\ny ralea su sombra[296] en la estación de los calores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEN LA CORDILLERA\r\n\r\nJUAN MARÍA GUTIÉRREZ\r\n\r\n\r\nEn mi calidad _inalienable_ de porteño, ayuno de granito y de basalto,\r\nhuérfano de mesetas, de morros y promontorios, sin conocer otros\r\n_montes_[297] que los de durazno, ¡cuánto no ansiaba por[298] acercarme\r\na ese lindero del occidente argentino divinizado en los cantos guerreros\r\ncon que me había arrullado en la cama! ¡Qué ansia tenía por poner pie\r\ndonde lo estamparon los valientes[299] de San Martín y los leones de\r\nNecochea![300]\r\n\r\nUn día 6 de mayo, de un año que no quiero[301] acordarme, esos Andes\r\ntan deseados se presentaron a mi vista. Sus cumbres, celestes como\r\nnuestra[302] bandera, en la mañana, y rosadas como la inocencia y la\r\njuventud al ponerse el sol, fueron para mí verdaderos iris de bonanza\r\ndespués de cuarenta días de _capa_[303] y tempestades en ese\r\n_cabo_,[304] acabador de toda paciencia, que se llama de Hornos...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEn todo esto cavilaba, mi querido amigo, en tanto que la luna del 31 de\r\nmarzo brillaba sobre mi cabeza peregrinando por el cielo transparente de\r\nla provincia de Aconcagua.[305]\r\n\r\nUna mula con el equipaje y provisiones, dos de remuda, el guía tras de\r\nellas, y yo cabalgando en silla inglesa a retaguardia, íbamos en\r\nprocesión por una senda angosta a las cuatro de la mañana siguiente. La\r\nluna no alumbraba; las estrellas, tímidas todavía ante la reina\r\neclipsada, no alumbraban tampoco; y yo sólo contaba para mi salvación\r\ncon el instinto de mi cuadrúpedo y del bípedo delantero. No sabía si\r\ncaminaba[306] para adelante o para atrás; y por salir de una\r\nofuscación[307] muy frecuente en semejantes situaciones, llevaba la mano\r\na la cabeza del caballo porque me[308] parecía que el animal estaba al\r\nrevés. \"Las tinieblas estaban sobre la haz del abismo\", como en el\r\nprimer capítulo del Génesis. Poco a poco comenzó a fosforescer la\r\ncolumna del vapor tibio de la respiración de las bestias; el aire tomó\r\nel oriente de las perlas; la inevitable compañera de todo cuerpo comenzó\r\na marcarse en el suelo; hasta que al fin, el dedo de Dios \"separó la luz\r\nde las tinieblas\" que huyeron. ¡Qué sitios tan bellos había robado la\r\nnoche a mi contemplación! La montaña estaba a mi derecha; el torrente a\r\nmi izquierda. Unas _tunas_ del género _cirio_, más corpulentas y\r\ncilíndricas que las que conocemos aquí, reunidas en familia de cinco y\r\nseis individuos de todas edades y estaturas, se levantaban verdes y\r\nairosas, con envidia del aficionado a jardines.[309] Con este instinto\r\ndel mal que distingue al hombre, las hacía _emigrar_ con la imaginación,\r\ny las colocaba dentro del círculo artificial de un parque a la inglesa.\r\nNo sólo por sus formas y color que eran bellos, la naturaleza les había\r\ndado aduladores para realzar sus méritos: una planta parásita llamada\r\n_quiltre_, que a merced de sus tenaces púas se injerta en los árboles\r\nhasta connaturalizarse con ellos, formaba de rojo y amarillo\r\nguirnaldas[310] preciosas sobre la cabeza de los cactus; en otros,\r\nceñidos más abajo por las mismas flores,[311] remedaban sartas de\r\ncorales en la garganta de una[312] mujer de Arauco. Piedras enormes,\r\nárboles pequeños,[313] obligaban al sendero a arrastrarse por aquellas\r\nfaldas como una serpiente; que tal[314] parece en realidad, cuando la\r\nvista puede descubrir la serie sin interrupción de sus anillos\r\nblanquizcos.\r\n\r\nVoy a hacer una advertencia. Cuando le diga a Vd.: \"Me paré, almorcé\r\naquí, comí allá, dormí en tal parte\", no era yo el que tenía cansancio,\r\nhambre ni sueño, sino las mulas o el conductor, porque mi voluntad no\r\nentraba para nada en la formación de las leyes de aquella república\r\nambulante. Por otra parte, las jornadas están señaladas por la\r\nnaturaleza, por decirlo así, combinada por la necesidad del transeunte\r\nen las Cordilleras. Es preciso parar a comer donde haya agua y sombra:\r\ndormir en paraje abrigado y en la cercanía de algunas hierbas para que\r\npasten las bestias.\r\n\r\nA las once y media de la mañana mi caballo no quiso obedecer a las\r\nespuelas; lo atribuí a la mala calidad del pingüelo o a la peor\r\ncolocación de estos instrumentos pedestres que se me habían[315] subido\r\na las pantorrillas. Pero esto era un mal juicio en toda la extensión de\r\nla palabra. El[316] pobre cedía a una costumbre inveterada: habíamos\r\nllegado al lugar de almorzar, y a fe que el sitio era a propósito para\r\nel efecto. Un hilo de nieve derretida caía transparente de la montaña\r\npor entre sombra de árboles, y un peñón plano y extenso prestaba mesa\r\npara una orgía de 25 cubiertos. Esta piedra rodeada en círculo de otras\r\nen forma de pirámides, altas y truncadas, realizaba con perfección la\r\nidea que tengo de las aras druídicas de los antiguos galos; y por un\r\nrapto vagabundo de la imaginación, me transporté al teatro de Carlos\r\nAlberto, en donde había[317] oído por primera vez aquella sublime elegía\r\nque inspiró a Bellini el presentimiento de una muerte[318] prematura.\r\nEl poco respeto que me infundía el criterio músico del muletero, me dió\r\nánimo para echar al aire algunas notas, y entoné la famosa cavatina de\r\nla sacerdotisa sacrílega: _¡Casta Diva!_[319]\r\n\r\nUn pollo fiambre y un trago de jerez _bien rubio_ me habían infundido\r\ntan buen humor, que me puse a reír a vista de un espectáculo\r\nartísticamente interesante y patético también, que aquel momento se\r\nofreció a los ojos de _Norma_.--Un anciano,[320] vestido pobremente,\r\ndescendía, en sentido opuesto al nuestro, la ladera del camino, colgadas\r\ndos _arganitas_ de cuero a los ijares de su mula _cuyana_, ética y\r\ntropezadora. La fruta que traía en ellas no la producen ni los árboles\r\nni las plantas. Eran dos chiquillos de 5 a 6 años que, hincaditos,\r\nparecían esas _ánimas_ de bulto que con las manos juntas al pecho,\r\ncoloca la piedad pedigüeña sobre las alcancías de las iglesias\r\ncatólicas.--Murillo, que[321] ha llenado los conventos de España con\r\nesos lienzos inmortales que representan la huída a Egipto de la Santa\r\nFamilia, habría tomado de aquí asunto para un cuadro original como[322]\r\npocos.\r\n\r\nSiguiendo nuestro camino, nos encontramos[323] hasta tener literalmente\r\na nuestros pies el torrente, compañero fiel del sendero.--El _Salto_\r\nse[324] presentaba en el fondo de la cima dando salida por un corte\r\ngigantesco de la montaña al agua anhelante por esparcirse en un lecho\r\nmenos limitado que el que la trae emparedada por un trecho considerable.\r\nEl cauce por donde corre allí, está sembrado de piedras de colores\r\nvariados y de formas redondas dadas contra la voluntad del[325] granito\r\npor esa pertinacia del agua, que eternamente se desliza y que se ha\r\npresentado como imagen del triunfo de la constancia: \"la gota[326]\r\nhorada la piedra, _non vi sed saepe cadendo_.\" Fuera imposible\r\ncontemplar aquel espectáculo sin atribuir inteligencia a la lucha que\r\nlevantaba espumas de plata y de jazmines en torno de los guijarros\r\ndesnudos. Allí había sin duda Náyades que lavaban sus encajes y sus\r\ntúnicas de Cambray[327] con pasta perfumada de almendras de la\r\nfábrica[328] de Monpelas; Ninfas de la fuente que contaban sus amores\r\ndesconocidos y desgraciados a los escasos viajeros; y de ella[329] (no\r\npuede por menos) es[330] esa cadencia monótona que llena el oído y\r\nconvida a \"soñar e imaginar con desaliño\", frases castizas[331] que\r\nguardo en la memoria porque me parece la traducción más genuina del\r\nverbo francés _rêver_, que tanto da qué hacer a los traductores\r\nnoveles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUD-AMÉRICA (Map of South America)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA NATURALEZA SUDAMERICANA\r\n\r\nDE VALPARAÍSO A BUENOS AIRES\r\n\r\nJUAN MARÍA GUTIÉRREZ\r\n\r\n\r\nEl camino a vapor[332] es el Valdivia,[333] el Hernán Cortés, el\r\nPizarro, de nuestros días, para completar la conquista de América en\r\nservicio de la civilización y la paz. La espada comenzó esa conquista:\r\nla ayudó y continuó la cruz, en manos de los misioneros;[334] la ciencia\r\nde la mecánica que da la dirección asombrosa a la fuerza expansiva de\r\nuno de los elementos antiguos[335] encerrado en una caldera de hierro,\r\nacortando en tiempo las distancias, dando al andar del hombre la rapidez\r\ndel vuelo de las aves, satisfaciendo una necesidad apenas sentida,\r\nacercando los pueblos apartados para que conversen, por decirlo así,\r\nmano a mano, está[336] llamada en este siglo a completar la obra\r\ncomenzada en América por el guerrero y el sacerdote. El silbo de la\r\nlocomotiva es hoy la voz del verdadero apóstol, el sonido de la lira de\r\nlos Anfiones[337] modernos, eco de los taumaturgos del siglo, que\r\npredica la unión y la paz entre los hombres, hablándoles de sus\r\nintereses, que levanta centros sociales por encanto y aconseja el amor\r\nal prójimo y el respeto a Dios, tiñendo con dulces colores de rosa los\r\nhorizontes de esta existencia de un día para las criaturas y eterna para\r\nlas sociedades.\r\n\r\n¿No piensa Vd., mi amigo, como yo? ¿Cree Vd. que una ley escrita y nada\r\nmás sea tan poderosa como el _fiat_ de Dios para dar condiciones de\r\nnación[338] y formas regulares de cuerpo social a una familia de\r\ndesiertos como son los miembros de todas las repúblicas sudamericanas?\r\nEl aislamiento natural ahoga la eficacia del pacto, como agosta la\r\nmaleza robusta e indómita a la planta delicada acostumbrada a sentir\r\ncerca de sí la mano inteligente del hombre. La América es el campo\r\nde[339] aplicación de todos los descubrimientos de la ciencia europea,\r\nno porque yo lo digo, sino porque así lo dispuso el Artífice que fraguó\r\nuna vez para siempre los destinos de la cadena del mundo. El poder de la\r\ndilatación de esa ciencia es como el de la mente de Colón--no puede\r\nreconocer por meta las columnas de ningún Hércules. La América es[340]\r\nel jardín del mundo para la aclimatación de todo lo grande y de todo lo\r\nbueno. Si alguien lo duda, que ponga la vista en el mapa de su\r\ngeografía, y diga después si el hombre podrá encontrar en ninguna otra\r\nparte del mundo mejor cielo que admirar, mejores sombras a que asilarse,\r\nmejores frutas para su paladar, aguas más frescas y salubres para su\r\nsed, ríos más capaces de ser surcados, montañas más preñadas de plata y\r\nde oro, tierras más fértiles que en América. En poco tiempo el habla y\r\nla religión cristiana se aclimataron en nuestro continente desde la\r\ntierra magallánica hasta la alta[341] California; el hijo del\r\nconquistador y de las Indias cautivas fué superior en fuerza muscular y\r\nen inteligencia a sus padres. El inca Garcilaso,[342] criado al seno de\r\nuna _Palla_ cuzqueña, escribió con veracidad y talento las proezas de\r\nPizarro, que no sabía escribir su nombre. Esta facultad absortiva de\r\nasimilación y de mejora que distingue al nuevo mundo, se manifiesta\r\ndesde luego en el hombre americano por su facilidad para imitar, por su\r\nnotable aptitud para las artes y los idiomas; en segundo lugar, se\r\nmanifiesta en las condiciones del suelo, algunas de las cuales podemos\r\nseñalar sin salir de casa. Los españoles, por ejemplo,[343] traen al Río\r\nde la Plata unos cuantos potros andaluces, y _esos céfiros del Betis_,\r\ncomo los llama[344] Góngora, encuentran su verdadera patria en las[345]\r\nllanuras argentinas: se reproducen al infinito; la libertad los mejora,\r\ny aquí en su centro, es donde aconseja Bufón que se contemple y se[346]\r\nestudie ese bruto generoso, \"la mejor conquista entre cuantas hizo el\r\nhombre\". El pico de un ave[347] o el movimiento de una ola depone a las\r\norillas del Paraná la simiente de un durazno, y de ahí el origen de esa\r\nabundancia de \"fruta del[348] monte\", que nos deleita entre los meses de\r\nfebrero y marzo. Dos carozos de damasco traídos por casualidad de\r\nItalia, poco más ha de medio siglo, bastaron para reproducirse en Buenos\r\nAires en los términos que conocemos. El morueco de las colonias\r\nespañolas tan mimado en Sajonia, crece y se reproduce sin desmejorar en\r\nnuestros campos, sin más techo ni cobertizo que la benignidad del\r\ntemperamento. Para estos animales, pues, y para aquellas semillas,\r\nestaba preparada _ab initio_[349] la tierra que tanta y tan agradecida\r\nhospitalidad les brinda.\r\n\r\nY ahora, dígame Vd., mi amigo, ¿para qué puede haber nivelado la mano de\r\nla naturaleza el espacio que media entre el Plata y el Paraná (\"caminos\r\nque caminan\") y las faldas de las[350] Cordilleras, límites de nuestro\r\npaís con Chile y Bolivia? ¿Será para que se arrastre sobre esa\r\nsuperficie plana la tarda rueda de la carreta al paso lerdo del robusto\r\nbuey tucumano, cuya piel y cuya carne se pagan a peso de oro al\r\noccidente de los Andes? ¿Será para que se espacie en ella el avestruz\r\n\"privado por Dios de inteligencia\", como quiere la Escritura, y para\r\nque, \"cuando[351] llegue la ocasión, levante las alas y se burle del\r\ncaballo y del cabalgador\"? ¿Será para que pueble sus soledades el\r\nalarido de los ranqueles y el relincho de los potros _orejanos_; o para\r\nque se[352] convierta, en fin, en Calvario, demostrando a[353] cada paso\r\ncon sus cruces que la vida del hombre no es allí de Dios, ni de la ley\r\nhumana, sino de la barbarie codiciosa?\r\n\r\n¡No! El ingeniero invisible sujetó _a regla_ ese mar de verdura, como\r\nsujetó la superficie del océano a un nivel permanente, y con iguales\r\ndesignios. Divorció con el agua salobre los continentes, porque había\r\npuesto en la mente humana el germen de la navegación y en la atmósfera\r\nlos vientos constantes. Tendió el desierto, que es en apariencia el\r\nsudario de la vida social, porque en el siglo XIX el hombre había de\r\ninventar un monstruo corpulento como los megaterios, veloz más que el\r\ngamo, sobre cuya espalda había de erguirse en realidad como Rey de la\r\nCreación, mostrándose invencible en las luchas con las resistencias de\r\nla naturaleza y del espacio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLINIERS Y LA RECONQUISTA DE BUENOS AIRES\r\n\r\nC. O. BUNGE (Según P. Groussac)\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Los Preparativos y la Marcha hacia Buenos Aires\r\n\r\nConquistada por los ingleses en 1806 la ciudad de Buenos Aires, Santiago\r\nde Liniers tomó su partido: se dirigió a Las Conchas[354] y se embarcó\r\nen una lancha para la Colonia. Se dice que había pasado parte de la\r\nnoche anterior en oración en el santuario de la Recoleta[355]:\r\nsería[356] la vela de las armas[357] de los antiguos caballeros, y a\r\nfe[358] que no sentaba mal en quien descendía de Guy de Liniers, muerto\r\nen la batalla de Poitiers.[359] Desde la Colonia escribió a Ruiz\r\nHuidobro, gobernador de Montevideo, reseñando el estado de la capital y\r\nproponiéndole reconquistarla \"con 500 hombres de tropas escogidas que se\r\nle confiasen\". La Junta de Guerra allí establecida para preparar la\r\nresistencia a la anunciada invasión de Popham, opinó[360] que se debía\r\noír a Liniers. Y se le confió el mando[361] que solicitaba.\r\n\r\nEl 22 de julio la división salió de Montevideo entre las aclamaciones\r\ndel vecindario. Al frente iba Liniers, vistiendo el brillante uniforme\r\nazul y rojo, flordelisado de oro, de capitán de navío, y, en el pecho,\r\nla cruz de Caballero de Malta. Era[362] de alta estatura, de robusta\r\npresencia, y poseía una belleza risueña y varonil que formó parte de su\r\nprestigio entre la muchedumbre. Galante por raza y temperamento,\r\nsaludaba a las mujeres apiñadas en los balcones y azoteas, anunciando la\r\nvictoria que le tenía prometida aquella voz secreta, misterioso\r\nconfidente de todo conquistador.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SANTIAGO ANTONIO DE LINIERS\r\n\r\n_Navarro y Lamarca, Historia general de América_]\r\n\r\n¡Al fin tenía su hora histórica! Y, radiante de entusiasmo, blandía al\r\nclaro sol de invierno, dulce como una caricia, la espada tanto tiempo\r\nherrumbrada, que había flameado en Gibraltar y Menorca[363] contra esos\r\nmismos ingleses que ahora iba a vencer.\r\n\r\nEmbarcadas las tropas el día 3 de agosto, la travesía de la Colonia a la\r\notra costa se efectuó sin inconveniente grave, aunque con bastante labor\r\npor la suestada y los chubascos. Parte de la flotilla extravió el rumbo\r\nen la obscuridad, teniendo que fondear, sin saberlo, a inmediaciones de\r\nuna fragata enemiga. Al salir la luna, zarparon las naves y rectificaron\r\nsu rumbo, amaneciendo a la[364] vista de Buenos Aires y de la escuadra\r\ninglesa. Arreciando la suestada, Liniers resolvió desembarcar en Las\r\nConchas, y no ya en Olivos, como[365] se había determinado. Allí fondeó\r\nel 4 por la mañana, realizándose inmediatamente el desembarco de las\r\ntropas y artillería e incorporándose además los marineros disponibles de\r\nla flotilla. El día 5 las fuerzas entraron en San Isidro, donde[366]\r\nencontraron provisiones frescas y abrigo; el temporal se había\r\ndesencadenado, dispersando a las naves enemigas y echando a pique cinco\r\nlanchas cañoneras. Las tropas emplearon el día en limpiar el armamento y\r\napercibirse para el combate.\r\n\r\nAl día siguiente, domingo, el capellán celebró misa al aire libre, en el\r\ncentro de las tropas formadas. Concluído el oficio, se dió orden de\r\nmarcha para los Corrales de Miserere, donde se[367] llegó a las diez de\r\nla mañana. Desde este punto, el jefe de la división española dirigió a\r\nlas once,[368] con su primer ayudante Quintana, una enérgica intimación\r\nal general inglés. No habiendo sido admitido por Beresford en los quince\r\nminutos[369] fijados, el enviado se retiró sin entregar la misiva; pero\r\nLiniers no aprobó este exceso de celo y despachó nuevamente a su\r\nayudante, que fué recibido en el acto. La respuesta de Beresford fué muy\r\nsignificativa, viniendo de un jefe tan circunspecto como valiente. Al\r\ncontestar que se defendería \"hasta el caso que la prudencia le\r\nindicara\", confesaba implícitamente lo que dejaban entrever[370] sus\r\npedidos de conferencias con las autoridades bonaerenses y, un poco más\r\ntarde, con Pueyrredón.[371] La situación del invasor se presentaba cada\r\ndía más difícil e insostenible en la atmósfera hostil de la ciudad; y,\r\nsi bien estaba resuelto a cumplir con su deber, no se le ocultaba la\r\ndesigualdad de condiciones con que se empeñaba el combate. Vencedor, su\r\nvictoria sería estéril; vencido, su[372] pérdida era irreparable. Puede\r\ndecirse, pues, que[373] la acción se inició, en esa misma tarde, contra\r\nun adversario moralmente derrotado. A las cinco, la división rompió\r\nmarcha hacia el Retiro, yendo[374] de vanguardia el cuerpo de\r\nvoluntarios catalanes con dos obuses.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. La Reconquista\r\n\r\nEl grueso de la división no salvó sin gran trabajo,[375] y sólo merced\r\nal auxilio del vecindario y gauchos a caballo, las dos millas de\r\nmalísimo camino, sembrado de baches y pantanos, que mediaba entre el\r\nMiserere (hoy Once de Septiembre), y el Retiro. Entretanto, los miñones\r\no migueletes, apoyados por la compañía de infantería de Buenos Aires,\r\nllegaban a dicha plaza del Retiro \"a paso de carrera\" y atacaban el\r\nParque, defendido por 200 soldados ingleses, a quienes desalojaron con\r\nuna carga a la bayoneta. La fuerza enemiga se replegaba hacia la\r\nFortaleza, dejando varios muertos y prisioneros en el sitio, cuando\r\nencontró a Beresford, que acudía en su auxilio por la calle del Correo\r\n(Florida), con una columna[376] de 400 a 500 hombres. En este mismo\r\nmomento, desembocaban en la plaza a marcha redoblada, vivamente\r\nestimulados por Liniers en persona, los voluntarios de Montevideo con\r\nuna parte de la artillería de Agustini. Tan decisivo fué, al enfilar la\r\ncalle, el fuego del obús cargado de metralla, que el enemigo se detuvo\r\nbruscamente y emprendió retirada hacia la Plaza Mayor, dejando[377] unos\r\n30 muertos o heridos y abandonando un cañón.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAUL GROUSSAC\r\n\r\n_Blasco Ibáñez, Argentina y sus grandezas_]\r\n\r\nEra muy tarde para seguir las operaciones, y, además, las tropas estaban\r\nrendidas de cansancio. Liniers se contentó con ocupar fuertemente el\r\nRetiro y sus bocacalles, tomando todas las precauciones del caso contra\r\ncualquier sorpresa. Las tropas pasaron la noche sobre las armas y sin\r\ncomer. El día 11 fué ocupado en montar los cañones de 18 desembarcados\r\nde la goleta _Dolores_, y otros de igual calibre que se encontraron en\r\nel Parque: había que prevenirse[378] contra un posible bombardeo de la\r\nescuadra, y también separarse para batir en brecha a Beresford, que\r\nparecía dispuesto a encerrar su defensa en la Plaza Mayor. El efecto\r\nmoral de este primer triunfo se hizo visible el mismo día; acudieron a\r\nengrosar las fuerzas regulares o tomar órdenes muchos jóvenes patricios\r\ny hombres del pueblo, algunos de los cuales se preparaban antes a una\r\nlucha de guerrilleros. A mediodía, para probar los cañones recientemente\r\nmontados, Liniers en persona apuntó sucesivamente a una lancha cañonera\r\ny a una fragata enemigas, con tan raro acierto que, después de dar en el\r\ncasco de la primera, cortó con el segundo tiro la pena de su mesana,\r\ndonde tremolaba la bandera británica, que cayó al agua. Túvose el hecho\r\npor un pronóstico feliz.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUENOS AIRES Y SUS CONTORNOS (Map)]\r\n\r\nAl amanecer frío y brumoso del día 14 se tocó generala, y, después de\r\nrevistar las tropas, Liniers tomó sus últimas disposiciones para el\r\nataque de la plaza. Dividió en tres columnas su ejército, reducido en\r\nnúmero, pero exuberante de entusiasmo y de confianza en la victoria. La\r\ncolumna de la izquierda, al mando de Liniers, entraría por la calle de\r\nla Merced; la del centro enfilaría por la calle de la Catedral, en tanto\r\nque la de la derecha seguiría la calle del Correo hasta el centro, para\r\nallí dividirse y ocupar las cuadras del Oeste y del Sur inmediatas a la\r\nPlaza Mayor. La artillería debía preparar el avance, barriendo el camino\r\ny haciendo replegar al enemigo. El ataque general se había fijado para\r\nlas doce del día; pero un incidente lo precipitó. Destacados en\r\navanzada, un cuerpo de marineros y otro de miñones se habían deslizado\r\npor las aceras, rasando las casas a favor de la neblina, hasta llegar a\r\ndos cuadras de la plaza y encantonarse en algunos edificios, desde donde\r\nrompieron el fuego sobre las partidas enemigas. Habiendo salido a\r\ncontenerlos y desalojarlos una columna inglesa, nuestros impetuosos\r\nexploradores se replegaron en guerrilla y avanzaron resueltamente. Eran\r\nlas nueve de la mañana; los imprudentes voluntarios pedían refuerzos y\r\nmuniciones, no[379] resolviéndose a abandonar el terreno conquistado.\r\nLas tropas enardecidas por la fusilería, querían marchar al fuego....\r\nEntonces Liniers modificó rápidamente su plan anterior: lanzó la\r\ncaballería de milicias de la Colonia y los dragones de Buenos Aires con\r\nartillería volante por la calle del Santo Cristo, en tanto que se movía\r\npenosamente la reserva con sus cañones de batir, y él mismo se\r\nadelantaba por la de la Merced, situándose en la plazoleta de la\r\niglesia. La refriega se hizo general.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AVANCE DE LOS INGLESES SOBRE BUENOS AIRES\r\n\r\n_Navarro y Lamarca, Historia general de América_]\r\n\r\nEl brío de las tropas suplió la desbaratada estrategia; el vecindario\r\narrastró los cañones sin caballos: todo el plan se reducía ahora, para\r\ncada jefe de cuerpo, compañía o pelotón, a desalojar al enemigo que\r\ntuviera al frente, hasta desembocar en la Plaza Mayor.\r\n\r\nLos ingleses, acantonados en los altos del Cabildo, la azotea de la\r\nRecova, el pórtico de la Catedral, tenían que hacer frente a los\r\ncombinados ataques de seis columnas convergentes. Cedieron primero los\r\nde la Catedral; los del Cabildo, acometidos por el Sur y por el Norte,\r\nse replegaron sobre la Recova, ya batida por la metralla de Liniers, y\r\ndesde cuyo arco Beresford dirigía la defensa. Aquí se concentró el\r\ncombate y comenzó a diseñarse el triunfo.\r\n\r\nAtacada por todos lados, la posición inglesa hacíase insostenible. Casi\r\nal mismo tiempo los dos generales enemigos, Beresford y Liniers, vieron\r\ncaer a su lado sus respectivos ayudantes. Liniers, atravesado el\r\nuniforme por tres balazos, se dirigía hacia la plaza. En el momento en\r\nque Beresford, convencido de que era imposible la resistencia, daba la\r\nseñal de retirada cruzando su espada sobre el brazo izquierdo, la\r\ndiezmada división inglesa se replegó hacia la Fortaleza, siendo su\r\ngeneral el último que ocupó el puente levadizo. El pueblo, victorioso,\r\nhizo irrupción en la plazoleta del Fuerte, dominando con sus clamores el\r\nruido de la fusilería y batiendo sus murallones con sus oleadas\r\nenfurecidas. Trajéronse escalas para emprender el asalto como si fuera\r\nun abordaje; pero entonces apareció Beresford, espada en mano, por el\r\nángulo Nordeste del parapeto, y se izó bandera parlamentaria. Con todo,\r\nel humo y la distancia impedían divisarla y no cesó el fuego de los\r\nasaltantes. Al pie de la muralla, el comandante Mordeille, que contenía\r\ndifícilmente a sus hombres, cruzaba un diálogo en francés con Beresford.\r\nPreguntando éste \"si su vida corría peligro\", el otro contestó que\r\nestaba salvada con[380] rendirse a discreción. El general arrojó su\r\nespada al pie de la muralla, pero Mordeille se la devolvió por medio de\r\npañuelos atados; al mismo tiempo se izó en el bastión una bandera\r\nespañola suministrada por un marinero; y de repente cesó el fuego,\r\nalzando el pueblo una inmensa aclamación.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEL NEGRO FALUCHO\r\n\r\nBARTOLOMÉ MITRE\r\n\r\n\r\nEn la noche del 3 de febrero, subsiguiente a la sublevación, hallábase\r\nde centinela en el torreón del Real Felipe un soldado negro del\r\nregimiento del Río de la Plata, conocido con el nombre de guerra de\r\n_Falucho_.\r\n\r\nEra Falucho un soldado valiente, muy conocido por la exaltación de su\r\npatriotismo y, sobre todo, por su entusiasmo por cuanto pertenecía a\r\nBuenos Aires. Como uno de tantos que se hallaban en igual caso, había\r\nsido envuelto en la sublevación, que hasta aquel momento no tenía más\r\ncarácter que el de un motín de cuartel.\r\n\r\nMientras que aquel oscuro centinela velaba en el alto torreón del\r\ncastillo, donde se elevaba el asta en que hacía pocas horas flameaba el\r\npabellón argentino, Casariego decidía a los sublevados a enarbolar el\r\nestandarte español en la oscuridad de la noche, antes que se\r\narrepintiesen de su resolución.\r\n\r\nSacada la bandera española de la sala de armas donde se hallaba rendida\r\ny prisionera, fué llevada en triunfo hasta el baluarte de Casas-Matas,\r\ndonde debía ser enarbolada primeramente, afirmándola[381] con una salva\r\ngeneral de todos los castillos.\r\n\r\nFaltaba poco para amanecer, y los primeros resplandores de la aurora\r\niluminaban el horizonte.\r\n\r\nEn aquel momento se presentaron ante el negro Falucho los que debían\r\nenarbolar el estandarte, contra el que combatían desde catorce años.\r\n\r\nA su vista, el noble soldado, comprendiendo su humillación, se arrojó al\r\nsuelo y se puso a llorar amargamente, prorrumpiendo en sollozos.\r\n\r\nLos encargados de cumplir lo ordenado por Moyano, admirados de aquella\r\nmanifestación de dolor, que acaso interpretaron como un movimiento de\r\nentusiasmo, ordenaron a Falucho que presentase el arma al pabellón del\r\nrey que se iba a enarbolar.\r\n\r\n--Yo no puedo hacer honores a la bandera contra la que he peleado\r\nsiempre,--contestó Falucho con melancólica energía, apoderándose\r\nnuevamente del fusil que había dejado caer.\r\n\r\n--¡Revolucionario! ¡Revolucionario!--gritaron varios a un mismo tiempo.\r\n\r\n--¡Malo es ser revolucionario, pero peor es ser traidor!--exclamó\r\nFalucho con el laconismo de un héroe de la antigüedad; y tomando su\r\nfusil por el cañón, lo hizo pedazos contra el asta, entregándose\r\nnuevamente al más acerbo dolor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESTATUA AL NEGRO FALUCHO EN BUENOS AIRES\r\n\r\n_Blasco Ibáñez, Argentina y sus grandezas_]\r\n\r\nLos ejecutores de la traición, apoderándose inmediatamente de Falucho,\r\nle intimaron que iba a morir, y haciéndole arrodillar en la muralla\r\nque daba frente al mar, cuatro tiradores le abocaron sus armas al pecho\r\ny a la cabeza. Todo era silencio, y las sombras flotantes de la noche\r\naun no se habían disipado. En aquel momento brilló el fuego de cuatro\r\nfusiles; se oyó una sorda detonación; resonó un grito de _¡Viva Buenos\r\nAires!_ y luego, entre una nube de humo, se sintió el ruido sordo de un\r\ncuerpo que caía al suelo. Era el cuerpo ensangrentado de Falucho, que\r\ncaía gritando _¡Viva Buenos Aires!_ ¡Feliz el pueblo que tales\r\nsentimientos puede inspirar al corazón de un soldado tosco y oscuro!\r\n\r\nAsí murió Falucho, como un guerrero digno de la República de Esparta,\r\nenseñando cómo se muere por sus principios y cómo se protesta bajo el\r\nimperio de la fuerza. Para enarbolar la bandera española en los muros\r\ndel Callao, fué necesario[382] pasar por encima de su cadáver; se\r\nenarboló al fin, pero salpicada con su sangre generosa; y aun tremolando\r\norgullosamente en lo alto del baluarte, el valiente grito de _¡Viva\r\nBuenos Aires!_ fué la noble protesta del mártir contra la traición de\r\nsus compañeros. Esa protesta fué sofocada por el estruendo de la\r\nartillería en todos los baluartes del Callao.\r\n\r\nFalucho era nacido en Buenos Aires, y su nombre[383] verdadero era\r\nAntonio Ruiz. ¡Pocos generales han hecho tanto por la gloria como ese\r\nhumilde y oscuro soldado, que no tuvo sepulcro, que no ha tenido una\r\ncorona de laurel, y que recién hoy tiene un recuerdo en la historia de\r\nsu patria![384]\r\n\r\nEl martirio de Falucho no fué estéril. Pocos días después se sublevaron\r\nen la Tablada de Lurín[385] dos escuadrones del regimiento de granaderos\r\na caballo, y deponiendo a sus jefes y oficiales, marcharon a\r\nincorporarse a los sublevados del Callao. A la distancia vieron flotar\r\nel pabellón español en las murallas. A su vista, una parte de los\r\ngranaderos, que ignoraban que los sublevados hubiesen proclamado al Rey,\r\nvolvieron avergonzados sobre sus pasos, como si la terrible sombra de\r\nFalucho les enseñase el camino del honor. Sólo los más comprometidos\r\npersistieron en su primera resolución, y volvieron sus armas contra sus\r\nantiguos compañeros, quedando así disuelto por el motín y la traición el\r\nmemorable ejército de los Andes, libertador del Chile y del Perú.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA ABDICACIÓN DE SAN MARTÍN\r\n\r\nBARTOLOMÉ MITRE\r\n\r\n\r\nSe ha dicho con verdad que sólo dos grandes figuras de los tiempos\r\nmodernos bajaron tranquilas de la cima de la grandeza, Wáshington y San\r\nMartín, porque ellos no fueron ni poder, ni ambición, ni partidos, ni\r\nodios, ni gloria egoísta, sino una misión que debía concluir en un día\r\nirrevocable, en medio de la propia existencia.\r\n\r\nWáshington no abdicó. Al colgar su espada después del triunfo, y\r\nentregar el poder público en manos de un pueblo libre, afirmó la corona\r\ncívica sobre sus sienes, siguió sin violencia el ancho camino que le\r\nestaba trazado, y alumbrado por astros propicios, se extinguió en el\r\nreposo con la angélica serenidad de los ángeles tutelares.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARTOLOMÉ MITRE\r\n\r\n_Blasco Ibáñez, Argentina y sus grandezas_]\r\n\r\nSan Martín abdicó en medio de la lucha, antes de completar su obra, no\r\npor su voluntad, como él lo dijo en su despedida y como se ha creído por\r\nmucho tiempo, sino forzado por la lógica de su destino y obedeciendo a\r\nlas inspiraciones del bien; y en haberlo reconocido en tiempo bajo los\r\nauspicios de la razón serena, consiste la grande moral de su\r\nsacrificio. Buscó su camino en medio de la tempestad en que su alma se\r\nagitaba, y lo encontró; y tuvo previsión, abnegación, y fortaleza para\r\nseguirla, y por eso el sacrificio no fué estéril.\r\n\r\nEl Perú había sido libertado por un puñado de cuatro mil hombres (dos\r\nmil argentinos y dos mil chilenos) contra veintitrés mil soldados, que\r\nmantenían en alto los pendones del rey de España en toda la extensión\r\ndel continente americano. San Martín, sosteniendo en sus brazos\r\nrobustos, como muy bien se ha dicho, el cadáver de su pequeño ejército\r\ndiezmado por la peste y los combates, había declarado la independencia\r\ndel[386] Perú.\r\n\r\nEsta grande empresa, realizada con tan pobres medios, con tanta economía\r\nde fuerzas y de sangre, y tan fecundos resultados, se caracteriza\r\ncomo[387] profunda combinación política y militar, en que circunscribió\r\nla lucha de la independencia americana a un punto estratégico; en que\r\nforzó el último baluarte de la dominación española en Sud-América; en\r\nque hirió el poder colonial en el corazón, con la espada de Chacabuco y\r\nMaipo; en que[388] encerró en un palenque sin salida a los últimos\r\nejércitos españoles y realistas, dentro del cual debía decidirse por un\r\nsupremo y definitivo combate a muerte, la causa de la emancipación de un\r\nmundo.[389]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESTATUA ECUESTRE DEL GENERAL SAN MARTÍN, PLAZA SAN\r\nMARTÍN, BUENOS AIRES]\r\n\r\nDesde ese momento, el triunfo de la causa de la independencia americana\r\ndejó de ser un problema militar y político: fué simplemente cuestión de\r\nmás esfuerzos y de más tiempo.\r\n\r\nDesde ese día, el sol al levantarse sobre el hemisferio de Colón, no\r\nalumbró más esclavos que los que aún continuaban aherrojados bajo las\r\nplantas de los últimos ejércitos realistas, atrincherados en las\r\nmontañas del Perú.\r\n\r\nPero, para alcanzar la victoria definitiva, era necesario que el mismo\r\nPerú, hondamente revolucionado, pusiese sobre las armas diez mil\r\nsoldados más, y el Perú no podía ponerlos. Chile no podía repetir el\r\nsupremo esfuerzo que había hecho, para remontar sus tropas\r\nexpedicionarias. La República Argentina, política y socialmente\r\ndisuelta, al mismo tiempo que sus hijos ausentes emancipaban lejanos\r\npueblos, no podía enviar nuevos contingentes a su ejército libertador de\r\nlos Andes.\r\n\r\nMientras tanto, las legiones triunfantes de Bolívar,[390] que desde las\r\nbocas del Orinoco habían cruzado de mar a mar el continente, se\r\nencontraban con las de San Martín, que desde el Plata habían cruzado al\r\nPacífico, dominándolo; y bajo la línea ardiente del ecuador y al pie del\r\nChimborazo, se[391] saludaban las banderas independientes de las\r\nProvincias Unidas del Río de la Plata, de Chile, del Perú, y de\r\nColombia, sellando la alianza continental con una nueva victoria\r\nalumbrada por los fuegos volcánicos del Pichincha.[392]\r\n\r\nEn tal situación, Colombia era el árbitro de los destinos del Nuevo\r\nMundo, y en manos del Libertador Bolívar estaba la masa hercúlea que\r\ndebía dar el golpe final, en el supremo y definitivo combate que iba a\r\nlibrarse en el Perú.\r\n\r\nPara concentrar este supremo esfuerzo, los dos grandes libertadores se\r\nencontraron en aquel punto céntrico del mundo en que sus soldados habían\r\nfraternizado. Sus miradas se cruzaron como dos relámpagos en la región\r\ntempestuosa de las nubes, sus brazos se unieron, pero sus almas no se\r\nconfundieron, porque comprendieron, que aunque profesaban una misma\r\nreligión, no pertenecían a la misma raza moral.\r\n\r\nBolívar era el genio de la ambición delirante, con el temple férreo de\r\nlos varones fuertes, con el corazón lleno de pasiones sin freno, con la\r\ncabeza poblada de flotantes sueños políticos, sediento de gloria, de\r\npoder, de esplendor, de estrépito, que[393] acaudillando heroicamente\r\nuna gran causa, todo[394] lo refería a su personalidad invasora y\r\nabsorbente. El mismo se ha retratado así, prorrumpiendo en uno de sus\r\nteatrales simulacros de renuncia del mando supremo: \"Salvadme de mí\r\nmismo, porque la espada que libertó a Colombia no es la balanza de\r\nAstrea.\"[395]\r\n\r\nSan Martín era el vaso opaco de la Escritura,[396] que escondía la luz\r\nen el interior del alma: el héroe impersonal que tenía la ambición\r\nhonrada del bien común, por todos los medios, por todos los caminos, y\r\ncon todos los hombres de buena voluntad, según él mismo se ha definido\r\ncon estas sencillas palabras: \"Un americano, republicano por principios,\r\nque sacrifica sus propias inclinaciones por el bien de su suelo.\"\r\n\r\nPor eso los dos murieron en el ostracismo. El uno en su edad viril,\r\nprecipitado de lo alto, con las entrañas devoradas por el buitre de su\r\ninextinguible ambición personal, llorando hasta sus últimos momentos el\r\npoder perdido.[397] El otro descendió sereno y resignado la pendiente\r\ndel valle de la vida, con la estoica satisfacción del deber cumplido,\r\nguardando en su ancianidad el secreto roedor de sus tristezas, como en\r\nlos heroicos días de su épica carrera había guardado el sigilo pavoroso\r\nde sus concepciones militares.\r\n\r\nEstas dos naturalezas opuestas y compactas, fuerte la una[398] por sus\r\ndefectos en el choque, y la otra por[399] sus calidades en la\r\nresistencia, se midieron como dos gigantes al abrazarse, y se penetraron\r\nmutuamente. San Martín fué vencido por el egoísmo de Bolívar; pero San\r\nMartín venció a su rival en gloria, mostrándose moralmente más grande\r\nque él.\r\n\r\nEl Libertador de Colombia alcanzará más triunfos, cosechará más laureles\r\ny merecerá más la admiración de la historia por su gloriosa epopeya\r\nterminada.\r\n\r\nEl Libertador argentino, venciendo las más arduas dificultades,\r\npreparando el camino y venciéndose a sí mismo, merecerá en los tiempos\r\nla simpatía etérea de las almas bien equilibradas.\r\n\r\nSan Martín, con su alto buen sentido, dándose cuenta clara de la\r\nsituación y de sus deberes para con ella, se inmoló en aras de una\r\nambición implacable, que era una fuerza eficiente, y cuya dilatación\r\nfatal era indispensable al triunfo de su causa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAN MARTÍN Y BOLÍVAR EN GUAYAQUIL\r\n\r\n_Navarro y Lamarca, Historia general de América_]\r\n\r\nLos realistas conservaban aún diez y nueve mil hombres en las montañas\r\ndel Perú. San Martín apenas contaba con ocho mil quinientos, y\r\nnecesitaba forjar nuevos rayos para continuar la lucha. Bolívar, al\r\nfrente del victorioso ejército de Colombia, tenía en sus manos el rayo,\r\nque a uno de sus gestos podía fulminar las últimas reliquias del poder\r\nespañol en América; pero a condición de compartir con nadie su gloria\r\nolímpica.\r\n\r\nAnte esta solemne espectativa, San Martín reconoció el temple de sus\r\narmas de combate, y vió: que el Perú flaqueaba, que su opinión[400]\r\npública estaba sublevada, que su ejército no tenía[401] ya el acerado\r\ntemple de Chacabuco y Maipo, y que no podría dominar estos elementos\r\nrebeldes sino haciéndose tirano.--Interrogó al porvenir, y previendo que\r\nen un término fatal su gran personalidad se chocaría con la de Bolívar,\r\ndando quizás un escándalo al mundo, y retardando de todos modos el\r\ntriunfo de la América con mayores sacrificios para ella, prefirió\r\neliminarse como obstáculo.--Sondeó su conciencia, comprendió que no era\r\ncomo Macabeo el caudillo de su propia patria,[402] y reconociéndose sin\r\nvoluntad para ser tirano y sin poder moral y material para continuar la\r\nlucha con fuerzas eficientes, abdicó a Bolívar la espada de Chacabuco y\r\nMaipo, después que se convenció de que su ofrecimiento de servir no\r\nsería aceptado.\r\n\r\nTal es el significado histórico y el sentido moral de la abdicación de\r\nSan Martín.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEL GENERAL BELGRANO\r\n\r\nBARTOLOMÉ MITRE\r\n\r\n\r\nBelgrano es una de las más simpáticas ilustraciones argentinas, y una de\r\nlas glorias más puras de la América, no sólo por sus memorables\r\nservicios a la causa de la independencia y de la libertad, sino también,\r\ny muy principalmente, por la elevación moral de su carácter y por la\r\nausteridad de sus principios democráticos.\r\n\r\nSu gloria es un patrimonio nacional, y pretender arrancar a su corona\r\ncívica una sola de sus hojas, sin justificar el derecho con que tal\r\ndespojo se haga, sería defraudar al pueblo de su propiedad legítima.\r\n\r\nBelgrano no ha sido un genio político del vuelo de Moreno, ni un genio\r\nmilitar de la altura de San[403] Martín, con quienes comparte la gloria\r\nde haber sido, a la par del primero, uno de los fundadores de la\r\ndemocracia argentina, y con el segundo, el héroe y el fundador de la\r\nindependencia.\r\n\r\nFué un gran ciudadano y un verdadero héroe republicano, y ésa es su\r\ngloria.\r\n\r\nEl general Belgrano ha ejercido dos clases de autoridad en el mundo:\r\nexigía de sus subordinados una obediencia religiosa al cumplimiento del\r\ndeber, y una exactitud casi igual a la que se exige a una orden\r\nmonástica, siendo inflexible en el castigo de los delincuentes.\r\n\r\nEstas cualidades de mando han formado escuela. El general La Paz, que lo\r\ncriticó por ellas, mandaba sin embargo sus ejércitos a la manera de\r\nBelgrano, y no por eso ha sido calificado de déspota.\r\n\r\nEl mando militar tiene en sí mismo algo de despótico, porque es\r\npersonal, sólo tiene por límite la responsabilidad moral del que lo\r\nejerce y el sentimiento de la justicia y de la dignidad humana. Si el\r\ncarácter de Belgrano hubiera sido despótico, se habría manifestado en el\r\nejercicio de ese mando casi absoluto, que las exigencias de la\r\nrevolución y el peligro común hacían que fuese más tirante que en las\r\ncondiciones de la vida ordinaria; y sin embargo, es sabido que Belgrano\r\nfué siempre justo a la vez que severo en el ejercicio tranquilo de su\r\nautoridad; que jamás abusó de ella, ni fué cruel ni voluntarioso, y\r\ntodos cuantos militaron[404] bajo sus órdenes, le guardaron por toda la\r\nvida, estimación, respeto y amor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANUEL BELGRANO\r\n\r\n_Blasco Ibáñez, Argentina y sus grandezas_]\r\n\r\nComo autoridad política en los territorios donde hizo la guerra,\r\nresponde en su favor el amor, el respeto, la confianza que supo inspirar\r\na los pueblos, y que se conserva hasta hoy aún en los hijos de los\r\nindios a quienes trató justiciera y paternalmente en Misiones[405] y en\r\nlas montañas del Alto Perú.[406]\r\n\r\nBelgrano no era un demócrata a la manera de Artigas[407] y de\r\nGüemes,[408] expresiones exageradas de la democracia en una época de\r\nrevolución: era un demócrata de la escuela de Wáshington y de Franklin,\r\ncuyos principios profesó toda su vida.\r\n\r\nLo prueba su anhelo por la instrucción de las masas, atestiguado por los\r\nestablecimientos de educación que fundó antes y después de la\r\nrevolución; su respeto a la igualdad humana, manifestado hasta en su\r\nconducta con los indios de Misiones y del Alto Perú; su amor a la\r\nlibertad del pueblo a que consagró su vida y sus afanes; su empeño\r\nconstante por que la revolución se constituyera sobre la base de un\r\npoder deliberante emanado directamente del pueblo, como lo demuestra su\r\ncorrespondencia con Rivadavia; su respeto[409] a la ley y a las\r\nautoridades constituídas, y más que todo, su abnegación, su desinterés y\r\nsu modestia en presencia de los altos intereses públicos.\r\n\r\nPor eso el general Belgrano es el ideal del demócrata. Ningún argentino\r\nha merecido mejor que él este nombre, y negárselo, sería querer privar a\r\nsu patria de uno de los más hermosos y acabados modelos que en tal\r\nsentido se pueden presentar[410] como ejemplo digno de admirarse y de\r\nimitarse.\r\n\r\nBelgrano y San Martín, los dos verdaderos grandes hombres de la historia\r\nrevolucionaria argentina, pueden llamarse padres y autores de la\r\nindependencia de su país, teniendo de común, que los dos fueron hombres\r\nde orden, ajenos a los partidos secundarios de la revolución, que nunca\r\npertenecieron sino al gran partido de la patria, ni tuvieron más pasión\r\nque la de la independencia, la de la libertad americana, cuyo\r\nsentimiento[411] inocularon profundamente en el corazón de los pueblos y\r\nejércitos que dirigieron.\r\n\r\nSan Martín en las provincias de Cuyo, y Belgrano[412] en las del Norte,\r\nlevantando el espíritu[413] público en ellas, conquistando el amor y la\r\nconfianza de las poblaciones, consiguiendo que los ciudadanos acudiesen\r\nvoluntariamente y con entusiasmo a sus banderas, dispuestos a la lucha y\r\nal sacrificio, haciendo concurrir hasta las mujeres a la defensa de la\r\ncausa común, prueban que tanto el uno como el otro eran verdaderos\r\nhombres de revolución, que si bien no se cuidaban de _encabezar_[414]\r\n_partidos_, sabían como se mueve a las democracias _encabezando una\r\ncausa popular_.\r\n\r\nEl general Belgrano, recibiendo el mando del ejército desorganizado de\r\ndos derrotas, haciendo[415] la guerra en medio de pueblos decaídos o\r\ndescontentos en parte como lo hemos probado ya, obteniendo una victoria\r\nen una retirada desigual, haciendo por último pie firme[416] en Tucumán,\r\nllevando a su población al campo de batalla, y predisponiendo a la\r\nprovincia de Salta a hacer los sacrificios más sublimes de que es capaz\r\nel patriotismo, nos enseña cómo los verdaderos demócratas encabezan, no\r\nlos partidos, sino los grandes movimientos de la opinión que deciden del\r\ndestino de los pueblos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEL GENERAL LAS HERAS\r\n\r\nBARTOLOMÉ MITRE\r\n\r\n(TITLE: =Las Heras= (Juan Gregorio de, 1780-1866), Argentine patriot and\r\ngeneral who distinguished himself in the Chilean campaign under San\r\nMartín. At Cancha Rayada (1818) where the troops of San Martín suffered\r\na reverse, it was Las Heras who saved the day by his masterly retreat\r\nand coolness in the general confusion.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHay héroes de circunstancias que ocupan y abandonan bulliciosamente la\r\nescena de la historia; héroes que a veces aparecen grandes a los ojos de\r\nsus contemporáneos más bien por el medio en que viven y los accesorios\r\nque los rodean, que por sus propias cualidades y por sus propias\r\nacciones.\r\n\r\nÉstos son los héroes teatrales de la historia.\r\n\r\nEllos necesitan para brillar de las luces artificiales de la popularidad\r\npasajera. Sólo se estimulan con los aplausos de la calle y de la plaza\r\npública. Para ellos no hay elocuencia posible sino en lo alto de la\r\ntribuna y en medio de una pomposa decoración, ni heroísmo sino en\r\npresencia de millares de testigos. Esclavos de ajenas pasiones y de su\r\npropia vanidad, sólo conciben la gloria de un carro triunfal arrastrado\r\npor adoradores, y prefieren una corona de cartón dorado con tal que\r\ntodos la tomen por oro de buena ley, a la inmortal corona de laurel\r\nsagrado que sólo resplandece en la obscuridad de la tumba. Hambrientos\r\nde vanagloria, ebrios de aplausos, enfermos de celos y de vanidad\r\npueril, el aplauso de la propia conciencia no llega a sus oídos; la\r\nverdadera gloria no les satisface, el silencio los anonada, la soledad\r\nlos hace creerse muertos, y el retiro es para ellos como el vacío de la\r\nmáquina[417] neumática que apaga los oídos.\r\n\r\nSobre la tumba de éstos no se escribió nunca el sublime epitafio de\r\nEsparta: \"Murieron en la creencia de que la felicidad no consiste ni en\r\nvivir ni en morir, sino en saber hacer gloriosamente lo uno y lo otro.\"\r\n\r\nLos hombres grandes por sí mismos, que no trafican con la gloria, para\r\nquienes el mando es un deber, la lucha una noble tarea, y el sacrificio\r\nuna verdadera religión; los que al abandonar el teatro de la vida\r\npública no tienen que despojarse a su puerta de las alas prestadas de un\r\ndía, y queman aceite de su propia vida en la lámpara de sus vigilias,\r\nésos viven en paz y conversan familiarmente con el genio de la soledad,\r\nel silencio serena su alma agitada por las tempestades populares. A esos\r\nhombres sienta bien el modesto retiro en que pueden ser estudiados y\r\nestimados por lo que en sí valen, despertando la admiración o la\r\nsimpatía por cualidades superiores a los ingeniosos prestigios de la\r\nprosperidad.\r\n\r\nTales o semejantes reflexiones a éstas hacía en una hermosa y apacible\r\ntarde de verano del año 1848, atravesando la magnífica alameda de\r\nSantiago de Chile, y dirigiéndome a uno de los barrios más apartados de\r\nla ciudad, donde vivía y vive aún el general D. Juan Gregorio de Las\r\nHeras, capitán ilustre y libertador de tres Repúblicas,[418] republicano\r\nsencillo y desinteresado, que siendo uno de los héroes más notables de\r\nla epopeya de la independencia americana, vivía tranquilo en el retiro,\r\nsin espada, sin poder y sin fortuna.\r\n\r\nIba a pagarle la visita que infaliblemente hace este soldado lleno de\r\ncortesía a todo argentino que llega a aquel país: y al hacerlo era\r\narrastrado por algo más que un deber social, pues admirador de sus\r\nservicios y virtudes, había encontrado en él un héroe según mi ideal, y\r\nun hombre según mi evangelio.\r\n\r\nAl dirigirme a su casa, podía contemplar a la distancia las nevadas\r\ncordilleras de los Andes, a cuyo pie está el memorable campo de\r\nChacabuco; y mi vista se perdía en la vasta llanura del valle de Maipú y\r\nlos caminos que desde él conducen al Sur de Chile, donde Las Heras,\r\nsiguiendo las huellas de San Martín, se había ilustrado en grandes\r\nbatallas y combates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUAN GREGORIO DE LAS HERAS\r\n\r\n_Navarro y Lamarca, Historia general de América_]\r\n\r\nLleno de estas ideas, de esos recuerdos y de este espectáculo grandioso,\r\nllegué a su antigua casa de familia, cuya arquitectura pertenece a la\r\népoca colonial. Era singular que quien más había contribuído a destruir\r\naquel régimen con su espada, hubiese encontrado en medio de tantas\r\nruinas como hizo en ella, un viejo techo con el sello de la[419]\r\ndominación española, donde abrigar su cabeza en el invierno de la\r\nvida....\r\n\r\nEs el Bayardo de la República Argentina, el[420] militar sin miedo y sin\r\nreproche, decano del ejército argentino por su edad, por sus servicios y\r\npor sus elevadas cualidades morales.\r\n\r\nEn su avanzada edad y a pesar de las dolencias que le aquejaban,\r\nconservaba aún cuando le vi por la última vez en Chile, en 1850, toda la\r\narrogancia del soldado, y el reflejo de la belleza varonil de sus\r\nheroicos años. Su talla es alta y erguida, su ojo negro, profundo y\r\nchispeante, respira la firmeza y la bondad, y en sus maneras se nota\r\nalgo de la habitud del mando, unido a la exquisita cortesanía de los\r\nhombres de su tiempo. En aquella época le vi una vez de grande uniforme\r\nen medio del Estado Mayor de Chile, y su imponente figura militar\r\neclipsaba a todos, llamando sobre él la atención del pueblo, que veía en\r\nél al representante de sus más queridas glorias.\r\n\r\nEl general Las Heras no necesita apelar a la posteridad para esperar\r\njusticia y afirmar la corona sobre sus sienes. El juicio que el pueblo\r\nsólo pronuncia en los funerales de sus héroes, ha sido pronunciado ya,\r\npara honor y gloria de él y de su patria, por los hijos de la heroica\r\ngeneración a que perteneció, que es la posteridad a que apelaba San\r\nMartín, su ilustre maestro y compañero de gloria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDON JUAN MARTÍN DE PUEYRREDÓN\r\n\r\nV. F. LÓPEZ\r\n\r\n\r\nPueyrredón era hombre, de dotes distinguidísimas y sólidas; tenía\r\ndignidad personal y un imperio particular sobre sí mismo que no se\r\ndesmintió en el resto de su vida ni aun en medio de los descalabros que\r\nle esperaban. Sabía guardar con una firmeza imponente el decoro de su\r\npersona y de su poder. No mostraba ambición codiciosa ni urgente de\r\nmando. No se le vió nunca entrar en[421] intrigas ni en tentativas,\r\nencubiertas o manifestadas, para apoderarse de la autoridad. Pero cuando\r\nera llamado a tomar parte en la dirección de los negocios, ocurría sin\r\nvacilar; mostraba una paciencia pertinaz en perseguir los propósitos que\r\nlo movían; y su energía, pero sin ninguna ostentación, se hacía sentir\r\nen la netedad de sus ideas y en la firmeza de sus actos, no sólo para\r\nservir sin descanso a la causa de la independencia, sino para castigar\r\ntambién con una severidad extrema y extraña a los hombres que se\r\natrevían a ponerle estorbos en su camino. Sus pasiones eran tranquilas\r\nen la superficie, y no se dejaban sentir sino[422] por la fuerza latente\r\ny bien seguida de sus frías manifestaciones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUAN MARTÍN DE PUEYRREDÓN\r\n\r\n_Navarro y Lamarca, Historia general de América_]\r\n\r\nSiempre que las circunstancias lo habían exigido, Pueyrredón se había\r\npresentado al peligro con decisión. Sin blasonar de ser guerrero había\r\nadquirido grados militares con una justicia que nadie podía negarle, sin\r\nque él reclamase jamás su[423] competencia. Había figurado con honor y\r\ncon notoria fama de arrojado en la primera tentativa que los ingleses\r\nhicieron para apoderarse de Buenos Aires. Después de la revolución de\r\nMayo había desempeñado una parte principal en las provincias limítrofes\r\ndel Perú como Gobernador Intendente de Chuquisaca; y cuando el\r\ndesgraciado encuentro de Huaquí obligó nuestras fuerzas a evacuar\r\nla[424] línea del Desaguadero, Pueyrredón mostró un tino consumado para\r\natravesar un país enteramente insurreccionado en contra nuestra; y con\r\nuna serenidad ejemplar, salvó del contraste recursos importantísimos en\r\ndinero, materiales y tropa, privando al enemigo de todas esas ventajas\r\nque habrían sido precisas para él en aquellos momentos.\r\n\r\nEn todas las cuestiones graves de guerra o de política, Pueyrredón\r\npensaba con madurez; pesaba el valor de los hechos y las probabilidades\r\nde todas las consecuencias, poniendo al servicio de sus combinaciones\r\nuna razón fría para meditar y para resolver, con una vigorosa precisión\r\npara ejecutar. Escribía sin brillo, pero con una corrección en la\r\nfrase, con tal trabazón en la lógica de sus ideas, con tal claridad\r\n_clásica_ y consumada, que hoy mismo podría ser envidiado por el más\r\nhábil literato; y la proligidad con que sabía dividir su tiempo para\r\nencontrar el momento oportuno que correspondía al despacho de cada\r\nasunto de interés público, rivalizaba con la atención esmerada que daba\r\na sus negocios particulares, con la moderación y con la equidad con que\r\narreglaba los negocios que estaban ligados con los suyos; de ello\r\ntenemos pruebas numerosísimas y ejemplos bien testificados en los\r\npapeles que ha dejado.\r\n\r\nLa reserva de su carácter, la prudente parquedad de sus palabras, algo\r\nde interno y de poderoso que[425] se percibía en él, sin poder decir\r\ncómo ni dónde, le hacían impenetrable y le daban un influjo eficaz\r\naunque latente. Su astucia era tanto más fina y previsora cuanto que\r\ntodo parecía en él natural y elevado, modesto e imparcial. Con la misma\r\nnaturalidad con que tomaba el poder, lo manejaba[426] hasta en los\r\nextremos de la firmeza y de la severidad, apareciendo casi indiferente a\r\nsus encantos, y dispuesto siempre a abandonarlo: y como sus modales eran\r\ncumplidos y atentos, sin ser abiertos ni obsequiosos, imponía a los\r\ndemás aquella distancia respetuosa que hace tan peligrosos a los\r\nhombres serios cuando juegan en el terreno falaz de la política o de la\r\ndiplomacia, y que les da ese poder mágico a que jamás llegan los\r\ncharlatanes de atraer y de alejar al mismo tiempo a los que los tratan.\r\nPuestos en el poder imponen un cierto temor misterioso al vulgo, que no\r\nlo puede definir, y una sumisión religiosa a los agentes que los tienen\r\nque obedecer. Esto es lo que distingue el buen género del género\r\nfalsificado.\r\n\r\nEstas cualidades que Pueyrredón tenía en alto grado, eran las que hacían\r\nde él un _hombre de gabinete_ consumado, y un compañero de Logia[427]\r\nincomparable para San Martín, con quien tenía[428] rasgos comunes de\r\nfisonomía política y de carácter personal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIANO MORENO\r\n\r\nJUAN MARÍA GUTIÉRREZ\r\n\r\n(TITLE: Mariano Moreno was born in Buenos Aires in 1778. He was a man\r\nwhose early death was a sad loss to the cause of the Revolution. He was\r\na lawyer renowned for his integrity and love of country. As secretary of\r\nthe Junta Gobernativa in 1810, he championed the republican form of\r\ngovernment. _La Gaceta de Buenos Aires_, of which he was editor, marks\r\nthe beginning of the Argentine press. He died on the high seas in 1811,\r\nbound for England as the delegate of the newly established Argentine\r\ngovernment.)\r\n\r\n\r\nEl nombre de don Mariano Moreno estará para siempre ligado a los\r\norígenes de nuestra independencia, como lo está en las concepciones\r\nhumanas, la idea a la forma, el hecho a las intenciones. Y cuando en las\r\nsolemnidades patrias miramos brillar[429] la imagen del sol en una de\r\nlas faces de nuestra[430] bandera, colocamos con el pensamiento en la\r\nopuesta, la imagen de aquel ciudadano, porque él fué la luz de la\r\nrevolución.\r\n\r\nÉl concentró los instintos del pueblo en su cabeza y depurándolos en tan\r\nvasto crisol, presentólos ante el mismo pueblo y ante el mundo, como su\r\npropósito grande y generoso.\r\n\r\nNuestra revolución nació serena como la aurora de un día hermoso, y dió\r\nsus primeros pasos conducida por la razón y el desprendimiento. Nuestros\r\npadres discutieron antes de obrar, y no admitieron el sacrificio de la\r\nsangre en el altar de la libertad que fundaban. En mayo de 1810, el[431]\r\nresentimiento y la venganza se transformaron en heroísmo, en acción\r\nvigorosa la apatía colonial, en patriotismo la antigua fidelidad, los\r\nvasallos en señores de su destino, y brotaron como por encanto,\r\nejércitos, instituciones liberales, sentimientos de nacionalidad y todos\r\nlos elementos que constituyen la Patria.\r\n\r\nSi un pueblo sacude su yugo antiguo con tanta dignidad, es porque se\r\nsiente fuerte en la justicia de su resolución, porque la virtud que es\r\nla fuerza por excelencia, le preside en sus actos.\r\n\r\nEsa fuerza y esa virtud tuvieron por fortuna su representante en don\r\nMariano Moreno, miembro del primer gobierno revolucionario.\r\n\r\nComenzó a desempeñar sus delicadas funciones a la edad de treinta años\r\ncon toda la precoz madurez de sus aventajadas facultades. Brioso de\r\ncarácter, elocuente, avezado a las luchas de la lógica y del derecho en\r\nlas discusiones forenses, reunía en su persona otras cualidades que le\r\nhacían simpático y popular. Brillaba en su abierta fisonomía la\r\niluminación del genio, y la rica sangre de la juventud circulaba en su\r\nrostro, bajo una tez blanca y transparente, como la savia de una planta\r\nlozana.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARIANO MORENO\r\n\r\n_Navarro y Lamarca, Historia general de América_]\r\n\r\nEste atleta bajó a la arena en toda la plenitud de sus fuerzas,\r\nacendradas en la austeridad del hogar y de los estudios serios. Hijo\r\nexcelente, padre afectuoso, agradecido discípulo, unía a una virginidad\r\nde sentimientos a la antigua, el atrevimiento y la audacia que inspiran\r\nlas ideas que son la gloria de los tiempos modernos.\r\n\r\nSu personalidad se eclipsa dentro de su idea, como el núcleo de un\r\ncometa en su atmósfera luminosa. La posteridad y la historia, no él,\r\nle[432] colocan entre los primeros hombres de la independencia, y le\r\nconceden su papel principal de revelación y de iniciativa en el drama de\r\nla revolución. No aspira a mandar sino a dirigir. Piensa recta y\r\ngenerosamente para que el pueblo pueda gobernarse a sí propio con\r\nacierto. Quiere como[433] borrar hasta los nombres propios de los\r\nmandatarios, para que la autoridad que preside los nuevos destinos de la\r\npatria, se sienta como influencia benéfica, y no se palpe como cosa\r\nnatural, aspirando a dotarla, en su noble exaltación democrática, con\r\nlos atributos de una entidad sobrehumana.\r\n\r\nMoreno no tenía confianza sino en las fuerzas morales y quiso traerlas\r\nal gobierno y darlas al pueblo como palanca para remover los obstáculos\r\nque la marcha de la Revolución iba a encontrar en su camino.\r\n\r\nY como entre aquellas fuerzas, la más poderosa es la\r\nprensa,--instrumento hasta entonces vedado a los hijos de la Colonia\r\npara ventilar las cuestiones[434] políticas y los intereses\r\nsociales,--el secretario de la Junta se constituyó voluntariamente en\r\nredactor de _La Gaceta_, colocando al frente de sus escritos uno de\r\naquellos magníficos arranques de amor a la libertad que son tan\r\nfrecuentes en las inmortales páginas de Tácito. Este periódico[435]\r\nnació con el nuevo régimen, proclamando los tiempos \"en que era dado\r\npensar y manifestar sin trabas el pensamiento\".\r\n\r\nLa prensa se hizo desde entonces militante y popular. Los anteriores\r\nensayos periodísticos se arrastraban tímidos por la senda de la\r\nerudición, y[436] apenas si una que otra chispa se derramaba a favor de\r\nlos intereses públicos. Los talentos y el patriotismo de Vieytes y de\r\nBelgrano no habían[437] conseguido interesar al pueblo en la\r\ncontemplación de su propio destino, y los tipos de nuestra única\r\nimprenta aparecían yertos sobre el papel como el metal de que estaban\r\nfundidos.\r\n\r\n_La Gaceta_ demolía y creaba al mismo tiempo. Fué el ariete asestado\r\ncontra las murallas de la tiranía retrógrada del Virreinato, y la fuerza\r\nque[438] levanta sobre el cimiento de la libertad al pueblo que surgía\r\ndel seno de los Cabildos abiertos. ¡Qué hermosa era la patria que\r\npintaba la pluma del ilustre redactor! ¡Cuán orgulloso se sentía todo\r\nargentino al reconocerse hijo de esa Patria y árbitro[439] de fraguarse\r\nsu propia felicidad, ejerciendo[440] derechos que antes no había\r\ncomprendido!\r\n\r\nLa ciencia de la política amaneció entre nosotros y se popularizaron sus\r\naplicaciones. Súpose entonces lo que era una sociedad entregada a sí\r\nmisma y libre del freno pesado y de las riendas mezquinas manejadas por\r\nun elegido de la casualidad desde las remotas orillas del\r\nManzanares.[441] Discutiéronse las diversas formas de gobierno a que\r\npueden someterse los hombres en sociedad; y las Provincias, convocadas\r\npor primera vez a un Congreso,[442] vieron con sorpresa que los\r\nhabitantes podían dignificarse hasta el punto de dar fuerza de ley a\r\naquellas aspiraciones más en consonancia con sus intereses y bienestar.\r\n\r\nBajo el influjo de tan hábil piloto, la Revolución no podía naufragar.\r\nEl rumbo estaba dado a la[443] mejor estrella, y por muchos desvíos que\r\nhubiera de experimentar la nave de la República, tenía forzosamente que\r\nllegar a la democracia.\r\n\r\nÉsta fué la obra de don Mariano Moreno. El pueblo había conseguido su\r\nindependencia; pero aquel gran patriota le preparó el porvenir americano\r\nque es hoy su modo de ser definitivo.[444]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGÜEMES\r\n\r\nBARTOLOMÉ MITRE\r\n\r\n\r\nGüemes, perteneciente a una notable familia de Salta, se presenta él\r\nmismo en sus actos, en[445] sus documentos políticos, en su\r\ncorrespondencia confidencial, como lo que es, como un caudillo político\r\ny militar. Éste es el rasgo prominente y verdaderamente original de su\r\nfisonomía: y es el único digno de llamar la atención, sea que[446] se le\r\nadmire, sea que se le condene, porque como caudillo, fué grande,\r\ncombatiendo por la causa común, y como caudillo fué funesto,\r\ncontribuyendo a la desorganización política y social.\r\n\r\nQuítese a Güemes el carácter de caudillo, y Güemes no es nada, o es\r\ncuando más una pálida fisonomía militar, que nada de extraordinario\r\ntendría en sí misma, si los hechos que ejecuta o promueve no fuesen la\r\nconsecuencia de la táctica, del prestigio, de los medios de acción de\r\ncaudillo representante de las masas populares, fanatizadas por la doble\r\npasión de la independencia y de la ciega adhesión a su persona,\r\ndispuestas igualmente, a un gesto suyo, a esgrimir sus armas ya contra\r\nel enemigo común, ya contra la sociedad.\r\n\r\nBórrese del retrato histórico de Güemes el nombre de caudillo, y Güemes,\r\no no será nada como militar, o será cuando más, el activo jefe de una\r\nvanguardia, hostilizando a un enemigo que, invadiendo un país\r\naccidentado y cuya[447] opinión le es contraria, viendo cortados los\r\nrecursos por la resistencia de la población en masa, se ve[448] al fin\r\nobligado a retirarse después de una serie de guerrillas y combates, lo\r\nque si bien es meritorio, no sería por sí solo una cosa extraordinaria,\r\ncuando a la retirada de ese enemigo concurrieron poderosas causas más o\r\nmenos inmediatas.\r\n\r\nQuitarle ese título como el de _gaucho_ que él hizo glorioso y que fué\r\nsu nombre de guerra, es despojarle de la agreste corona que sus heroicos\r\ncompañeros, aquellos hijos de la naturaleza a quienes él llamaba mis\r\n_gauchos_, colocaron sobre sus sienes en los bosques y valles de Salta,\r\ncuando le apellidaron el _Padre de los Pobres_; sería borrar uno de los\r\nrasgos característicos y propios de la resistencia popular que hizo el\r\ncaudillo desde 1817 a 1821.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARTÍN GÜEMES\r\n\r\n_Navarro y Lamarca, Historia general de América_]\r\n\r\nGüemes era, pues, un verdadero caudillo, bajo cualquiera faz que se le\r\nconsidere; así lo califican los contemporáneos que lo conocieron, así lo\r\npintan sus admiradores; así lo aclamaron sus partidarios y así se\r\nretrata él mismo.\r\n\r\nGüemes encontró el campo preparado. No inició la revolución ni libertó\r\npueblos, ni imprimió dirección a los acontecimientos, ni fundó nada.\r\n\r\nLa fuerza de Güemes no residía tanto en su propia individualidad, cuanto\r\nen la fuerza de las multitudes que acaudillaba y representaba, y cuya\r\nsubstancia, diremos así, se asimilaba: y aun cuando sin injusticia no\r\npueden negarse cualidades superiores al que así dominaba y dirigía esas\r\nmasas fanatizadas por su palabra, conduciéndolas a la lucha y al\r\nsacrificio, no era de cierto un genio superior ni en política, ni en\r\nmilicia; ni sus hechos fueron precisamente los que decidieron de los\r\ndestinos de la revolución, que se decidían de otros campos, con medios\r\nmás poderosos de acción, y bajo una dirección más inteligente, más[449]\r\nmetódica y con miras más trascendentales.\r\n\r\nSu gloria no es ésa. Su gloria consiste en que, como caudillo, si bien\r\ncooperó, directamente algunas veces e indirectamente otras, a la\r\ndesorganización general que ha prolongado una revolución social, fué\r\nsiempre fiel a la idea de la unidad nacional, y salvo un corto\r\nparéntesis, reconoció siempre la autoridad general, aunque a condición\r\nde hacer lo que mejor le convenía, pues era dueño y señor absoluto\r\ndentro de las fronteras de _su provincia_, como él la llamaba.\r\n\r\nSu gloria consiste en que jamás desesperó de la suerte de la\r\nrevolución; que en los más tristes días, cuando ella era vencida en el\r\nexterior y se veía[450] desgarrada en sus propias entrañas por las\r\nfurias de la guerra intestina, él combatió solo al frente de sus\r\nvalientes gauchos en las fronteras, paralizando las operaciones de\r\nejércitos poderosos y dando tiempo para que se desenvolviesen otras\r\ncombinaciones positivas que fueron en definitiva las que salvaron la\r\nrevolución. A esas operaciones concurrieron eficazmente los\r\nextraordinarios esfuerzos de Güemes, dignos sin duda de ocupar un lugar\r\ndistinguido en la historia argentina, porque así como la primera\r\nconmoción revolucionaria, en 1810, determinó las actuales fronteras de\r\nla República, así también, en esa época aciaga, la espada de Güemes\r\ntrazó con una línea imborrable la frontera definitiva de la Nación\r\nArgentina por el norte.\r\n\r\nCuando Güemes se puso al frente de la provincia de su nacimiento, ya\r\nrobustecida por la fuerza moral de sus triunfos en Tucumán y Salta, por\r\nel desarrollo de las fuerzas populares que ocho años de revolución\r\nhabían puesto en acción, contó además en las cuatro primeras campañas\r\ncon el apoyo de un ejército que cubría su retaguardia[451] y su flanco;\r\ny en la de 1817 con el de otro que[452] iba a atravesar los Andes para\r\ndar libertad a la América, que ya para los argentinos era un hecho\r\nirrevocable.\r\n\r\nDe ahí la energía de la resistencia de Güemes, de ahí su buen éxito.\r\n¡Honor a las Provincias del Norte, que en la época más calamitosa de la\r\nrevolución, cuando el congreso de Tucumán, producto del cansancio más\r\nbien que de la fe, trazaba con colores sombríos el cuadro de una\r\nsituación desesperada, apoyaron la declaratoria de la independencia que\r\ninspiraron San Martín y Belgrano! A ellas que desde entonces fueron el\r\nbaluarte de la Nación, cuando ardía ésta en guerra[453] civil y cuando\r\nesa guerra devoraba hambrienta sus ejércitos regulares. ¡Honor a Güemes\r\nque dirigió esa heroica resistencia, en la cual rindió noblemente su\r\nvida! Pero ¡honor también a aquél que[454] fué el primero que les reveló\r\nsu fuerza, que les dió dos días de gloria inmortal, y encendió en sus\r\ncorazones el fuego sagrado de la revolución, que no había prendido en\r\ntodos o se había amortiguado en algunos, cuando los llamó a empuñar las\r\narmas, y a defender a la vez su credo y sus hogares en los campos de\r\nTucumán y Salta!\r\n\r\nDice de él el general La Paz en sus _Memorias_[455] _Póstumas_, que,\r\nsegún el Dr. Vélez Sársfield,[456] _deben ser un texto bíblico para el\r\nhistoriador_: \"Si Güemes mandaba con un despotismo sostenido de la plebe\r\nque acaudillaba, se veía constituído en circunstancias[457] especiales,\r\ny por grandes que fuesen sus defectos, era el único dique que se oponía\r\nal retorno de la tiranía peninsular. Si cometió grandes errores, sus\r\nenemigos domésticos nos fuerzan a correr un velo sobre ellos, para no\r\nver en él sino al campeón de nuestra libertad política, al fiel soldado\r\nde la independencia y al mártir de la patria.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACUNDO QUIROGA\r\n\r\nDOMINGO F. SARMIENTO\r\n\r\n\r\nLe llamaron _Tigre de los Llanos_, y no le sentaba mal esta\r\ndenominación. La frenología y la anatomía comparada han demostrado, en\r\nefecto, las relaciones que existen entre las formas exteriores y las\r\ndisposiciones morales, entre la fisonomía del hombre y la de algunos\r\nanimales a quienes se asemeja en su carácter. Facundo, porque así lo\r\nllamaron largo tiempo los pueblos del interior--el general D. Facundo\r\nQuiroga, el Exmo. brigadier general D. Juan Facundo Quiroga, todo esto\r\nvino después, cuando la sociedad lo recibió en su seno y la victoria lo\r\nhubo coronado de laureles,--Facundo, pues, era de estatura baja y\r\nfornida; sus anchas espaldas sostenían sobre un cuello corto una cabeza\r\nbien formada, cubierta de pelo espesísimo, negro y ensortijado. Su cara\r\nun poco ovalada estaba hundida en medio de un bosque de pelo, a que\r\ncorrespondía una barba igualmente espesa, igualmente crespa y negra, que\r\nsubía hasta los juanetes, bastante pronunciados para descubrir una\r\nvoluntad firme y tenaz. Sus ojos negros, llenos de fuego y sombreados\r\npor pobladas cejas, causaban una sensación involuntaria de terror en\r\naquellos en quienes alguna vez llegaban a fijarse; porque Facundo no\r\nmiraba casi nunca de frente; por hábito, por arte, por deseo de hacerse\r\nsiempre temible, tenía de ordinario la cabeza inclinada, y miraba por\r\nentre las cejas, como el Alí-Bajá de Monvoisin. El Caín que[458]\r\nrepresentaba la famosa compañía Ravel me despierta[459] la imagen de\r\nQuiroga, quitando las posiciones artísticas de la estatuaria que no le\r\nconvienen. Por lo demás, su fisonomía es regular, y el pálido moreno de\r\nsu tez sentaba bien a las sombras espesas en que quedaba encerrada.\r\n\r\nLa estrechura de su cabeza revelaba, sin embargo, bajo esta cubierta\r\nselvática, la organización privilegiada de los hombres nacidos para\r\nmandar. Quiroga poseía esas cualidades necesarias que hicieron del\r\nestudiante de Brienne el genio de la[460] Francia, y del Mameluco oscuro\r\nque se batía[461] con los franceses en las pirámides, el virrey de\r\nEgipto. La sociedad en que nacen da a estos caracteres la manera\r\nespecial de manifestarse: sublimes, clásicos, por decirlo así, van al\r\nfrente de la humanidad civilizada en algunas partes; terribles,\r\nsanguinarios y malvados, son en otras su mancha, su oprobio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUAN FACUNDO QUIROGA\r\n\r\n_Civilización y barbarie_ _Lithograph by P. Cadot_]\r\n\r\nQuiroga es el hombre de la naturaleza que no ha aprendido aún a contener\r\no a disfrazar sus pasiones, que las muestra en toda su energía,\r\nentregándose a toda su impetuosidad. Éste es el carácter original del\r\ngénero humano; y así se muestra en las campañas pastoras de la República\r\nArgentina.\r\n\r\nFacundo es un tipo de la barbarie primitiva; no conoció sujeción de\r\nningún género; su cólera era de las fieras; la melena de renegridos y\r\nensortijados cabellos caía sobre su frente y sus ojos en guedejas como\r\nlas serpientes de la cabeza de Medusa; su voz se enronquecía, sus\r\nmiradas se[462] convertían en puñaladas; dominado por la cólera, mataba\r\na patadas estrellándole los sesos a N. por una disputa de juego;\r\narrancaba ambas orejas a una querida porque le pedía 30 pesos para\r\ncelebrar un matrimonio consentido por él; y abría a su hijo Juan la\r\ncabeza de un hachazo, porque no[463] había cómo hacerlo callar; daba de\r\nbofetadas a una linda señorita en Tucumán a quien ni seducir, ni forzar\r\npodía; en todos sus actos mostrábase el hombre bestia aún, sin ser\r\nestúpido, y sin carecer de elevación de miras. Incapaz de hacerse\r\nadmirar o estimar, gustaba de ser temido: pero este gusto era exclusivo,\r\ndominante hasta el punto de arreglar todas las acciones de su vida a\r\nproducir el terror como expediente para suplir al patriotismo y a la\r\nabnegación; ignorante, rodeábase de misterios y se hacía impenetrable;\r\nvaliéndose de su sagacidad natural, de una capacidad de observación no\r\ncomún, y de la credulidad del vulgo, fingía una presciencia de los\r\nacontecimientos, que le daba prestigio y reputación entre las gentes\r\nvulgares.\r\n\r\nEs inagotable el repertorio de anécdotas de que está llena la memoria de\r\nlos pueblos con respecto a Quiroga; sus dichos, sus expedientes, tienen\r\nun sello de originalidad que le daban ciertos visos orientales, cierta\r\ntintura de sabiduría salomónica en el concepto de la plebe. ¿Qué\r\ndiferencia hay, en efecto, entre aquel famoso expediente de mandar[464]\r\npartir en dos el niño disputado, a fin de descubrir la verdadera madre,\r\ny este otro para encontrar un ladrón?\r\n\r\nEntre los individuos que formaban su compañía, habíase robado un objeto,\r\ny todas las diligencias practicadas para descubrir el ladrón habían sido\r\ninfructuosas. Quiroga forma la tropa, hace cortar tantas varitas de\r\nigual tamaño cuantos soldados había; hace en seguida que se distribuyan\r\na cada uno; y luego con voz segura, dice: \"Aquél cuya varita amanezca\r\nmañana más grande que las[465] demás, ése es el ladrón.\" Al día\r\nsiguiente formóse de nuevo la tropa, y Quiroga procede a la verificación\r\ny comparación de varitas; un soldado hay, empero, cuya vara aparece más\r\ncorta que las otras. \"¡Miserable!\" le grita Facundo con voz aterrante,\r\n\"¡tú eres...!\" y en efecto él era;[466] su turbación lo dejaba conocer\r\ndemasiado. El expediente es sencillo; el crédulo gaucho, temiendo que\r\nefectivamente creciese su varita, le había cortado un pedazo. Pero se\r\nnecesita superioridad y cierto conocimiento de la naturaleza humana,\r\npara valerse de estos medios.\r\n\r\nHabíanse robado algunas prendas de la montura de un soldado, y todas las\r\npesquisas habían sido inútiles para descubrir al ladrón. Facundo hace\r\nformar la tropa y que desfile por delante de él, que está con los brazos\r\ncruzados, la mirada fija,[467] escudriñadora, terrible. Antes ha dicho:\r\n\"Yo sé quien es\", con una seguridad que nada desmiente.[468] Empiezan a\r\ndesfilar; desfilan muchos, y Quiroga permanece inmóvil: es la estatua de\r\nJúpiter Tonante, es la imagen del Dios del juicio[469] final. De repente\r\nse avanza sobre uno, le agarra del brazo y le dice con voz breve y seca:\r\n\"¿Dónde está la montura?...\" \"Allí, señor\", contesta señalando un\r\nbosquecillo.--\"Cuatro tiradores\", grita entonces Quiroga.\r\n\r\n¿Qué revelación era esta? La del terror y la del crimen hecha ante un\r\nhombre sagaz. Estaba otra vez un gaucho respondiendo a los cargos que se\r\nle hacían por un robo. Facundo le interrumpe diciendo: \"Ya este pícaro\r\nestá mintiendo; ¡a ver! cien azotes....\" Cuando el reo hubo salido,\r\nQuiroga dijo a alguno que se hallaba presente: \"Vea, patrón, cuando un\r\ngaucho al hablar está haciendo marcas con el pie, es señal que está\r\nmintiendo.\" Con los azotes el gaucho contó la historia como debía de\r\nser, esto es, que había robado una yunta de bueyes.\r\n\r\nNecesitaba otra vez y había pedido un hombre resuelto, audaz para\r\nconfiarle una misión peligrosa. Escribía Quiroga cuando le trajeron el\r\nhombre: levanta la cara después de habérselo anunciado[470] varias\r\nveces, lo mira, y dice continuando de escribir:[471] \"¡Eh!!!... ¡Ése, es\r\nun miserable! ¡Pido un hombre valiente y arrojado!\" Averiguóse en efecto\r\nque era un patán.\r\n\r\nDe estos hechos hay a centenares en la vida de Facundo, y que al paso\r\nque descubren un hombre superior, han servido eficazmente para labrarle\r\nuna reputación misteriosa entre los hombres groseros, que llegaban a\r\natribuirle poderes sobrenaturales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESTEBAN ECHEVERRÍA\r\n\r\nPEDRO GOYENA\r\n\r\n\r\nEcheverría es uno de nuestros literatos más afamados. Sus composiciones\r\nlíricas, sus poemas, sus escritos en prosa fueron leídos con avidez en\r\nlos tiempos ya lejanos en que inició lo que puede llamarse el movimiento\r\nrevolucionario de[472] nuestra literatura. Conviene que la joven\r\ngeneración se familiarice con aquel noble y vigoroso espíritu que\r\ncondensaba, por decirlo así, todas las nociones de la ciencia social en\r\nla época en que vivió, y que supo abrir al arte anchos y nuevos caminos,\r\npor los cuales hallaron nuestros poetas un mundo entero de bellezas\r\ndesconocidas. Echeverría era un hombre reflexivo, estudioso, inspirado,\r\ny amante de su patria. Podría presentársele[473] como el tipo del\r\ningenio sud-americano, sagaz, delicado, flexible, apto para comprender\r\nlas verdades que obtiene como premio la paciente investigación, y para\r\nsentir con viveza las emociones que los bellos espectáculos de la\r\nnaturaleza despiertan en las almas noblemente apasionadas.\r\n\r\nLos jóvenes que cultivan la literatura hallarán sin duda en la lectura\r\nde las obras de Echeverría,[474] placeres delicados y puros, enseñanzas\r\nfecundas y severas. Cuando se trata de evitar que los[475] hombres de\r\nletras se puerilicen en busca de una popularidad fácil y pervertidora,\r\ncuando se trata de hacerles adquirir esos hábitos meditativos\r\nindispensables para el progreso intelectual, Esteban Echeverría,\r\ndesdeñoso como Horacio de la insipiencia[476] del vulgo, investigador\r\nconcienzudo en las cuestiones de la ciencia y del arte, es todavía,\r\ndespués de la muerte, el bienvenido para los[477] pueblos del Plata.\r\n\r\nSus escritos políticos no son, no pueden ser ya, por la marcha natural e\r\nincesante de las ideas, una revelación sorprendente para sus\r\nconciudadanos, como lo fueron tal vez cuando el malogrado[478]\r\nargentino volvió al seno de su patria, después de beber a largos sorbos\r\nla ilustración europea; pero son y serán siempre un alto ejemplo para\r\nenseñarnos a disciplinar y dirigir las fuerzas intelectuales en orden a\r\nhallar la solución de los problemas que se refieren al bien de la\r\nsociedad.[479]\r\n\r\nNada tan eficaz para inspirar aversión hacia el hueco charlatanismo de\r\nlos que hablan y escriben sin reflexionar, como la lectura de las obras\r\nde Echeverría. Él conocía los serios deberes del literato y sabía\r\npracticarlos con escrupulosa austeridad. No escribía para halagar las\r\npreocupaciones vulgares y alcanzar las victorias estruendosas, pero\r\nefímeras, obtenidas por los que dicen a gritos las necedades que el\r\nvulgo ama como a sus hijos; y sacrificaba siempre el efecto inmediato a\r\nlas reglas del criterio artístico, inaccesible para la gran mayoría de\r\npersonas que no tienen un gusto refinado. Escribió _La Cautiva_ en\r\nhumildes octosílabos como para hacer contraste con los ampulosos\r\nalejandrinos a cuya sonoridad deben algunos versificadores su fama poco\r\nenvidiable, probando que la poesía reside en las ideas y en el\r\nsentimiento, que las modestas formas de un metro sencillo pueden\r\nalbergar dignamente la sublime inspiración del poeta.\r\n\r\nSupo reconcentrarse en los senos de la conciencia y sondar pacientemente\r\nlas profundidades del mundo interior, así como había estudiado las\r\nmaravillas de la naturaleza. Esperó los favores de la musa en las horas\r\nsilenciosas de austeras vigilias, y la invisible confidente bajó a su\r\nalma[480] con una frecuencia y una amabilidad de que pocos pueden\r\njactarse a pesar de haberla invocado muchas veces. Rompió la tradición\r\nclásica a que[481] habían estado sujetas las generaciones poéticas de la\r\nRepública Argentina, quitó a nuestra literatura el carácter de\r\n\"cosmopolitismo incoloro\" que había tenido hasta entonces, inspirándose\r\nen las peculiaridades de nuestra naturaleza y de nuestra sociedad, e\r\nintrodujo en la poesía las audaces franquezas de la expresión, que\r\nmuestran con verdaderos matices y en todo su vigor los fenómenos del\r\nalma humana. Sus cuerdas favoritas eran las que se armonizan con la\r\nsolemne majestad de la meditación y con los tiernos suspiros de la\r\nelegía.\r\n\r\nEn su alma se albergaba ese indefinible sentimiento en que se condensan,\r\nperdiendo mucho de[482] su amargura, _los males de la vida_, sin llegar\r\na confundirse jamás con la horrible desesperación o la sarcástica\r\nindiferencia de los que han dado a la esperanza un eterno adiós. Su\r\nespíritu se oscurecía con las nubes de la tristeza como el mundo con las\r\nsombras del crepúsculo, pero brillaba también con los fulgores de\r\nhalagüeñas visiones. Echeverría ha contemplado el ideal, ha sentido los\r\ndolores y los placeres de esa contemplación, y ha reflejado en bellas\r\nestrofas las variadas escenas de su drama interior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEL CONGRESO DE TUCUMÁN\r\n\r\n1816-1916\r\n\r\nERNESTO NELSON\r\n\r\n\r\nDesde una humilde casa de adobe de la ciudad de Tucumán,[483] las\r\nProvincias Unidas de la Plata[484] lanzaron al mundo, el 9 de julio de\r\n1816, la declaración solemne de su independencia. Fué ése un acto que,\r\naunque más modesto que el celebrado cuarenta años antes por las trece\r\ncolonias inglesas, tuvo igual si no mayor significación relativa en los\r\ndestinos del pueblo que la realizaba. Esa declaración[485] audaz que se\r\nhacía seis años después[486] de iniciada la guerra separatista, en\r\nmomentos en que las armas patriotas eran dominadas desde Méjico hasta\r\nChile, tuvo la virtud de retemplar los espíritus abatidos, salvando\r\nacaso la suerte de las armas.[487] Proclamada[488] esa declaración en\r\nmedio de una horrorosa anarquía, que habría de retardar por otro medio\r\nsiglo[489] la unidad nacional, logró sin embargo polarizar los espíritus\r\nen el sentido de la democracia. Clausurado ese Congreso sin que sus\r\ntareas se viesen cumplidas, su papel en la historia fué el de un\r\nmonumento inconcluso que recordará a los pueblos el deber sagrado de\r\ncompletar sus grandes líneas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASA DONDE SE REUNIÓ EL CONGRESO DE TUCUMÁN\r\n\r\n_Blasco Ibáñez, Argentina y sus grandezas_]\r\n\r\nLos lineamentos de las dos grandes revoluciones[490] de la independencia\r\nen el norte y en el sur del continente son demasiado diversos para que\r\nse los pueda superponer. No debe olvidarse que el grito revolucionario\r\nresonó en la América del Sur en 1810, cuando ya la Europa había olvidado\r\nla aventura a que se lanzara Francia en 1789; cuando[491] las acciones\r\nde la democracia habían sido despreciadas en el mercado político\r\neuropeo, dominado como estaba por un escepticismo contra el cual tenía\r\nescasa acción el éxito relativo con que la América sajona había\r\ncomenzado a poner en práctica sus instituciones democráticas. En el\r\nnorte el deseo de instituir un gobierno propio[492] primaba sobre el\r\nanhelo de independencia, según lo comprueba el ofrecimiento de\r\nobediencia y de voluntaria contribución que hicieron las colonias\r\ninglesas al soberano; en el sur el deseo de independencia era lo primero\r\ny la forma de gobierno lo segundo. Fracasada la libertad de Francia en\r\nel imperio militar y desacreditada la república[493] por los crímenes\r\ndel Año Terrible, la democracia[494] no tenía atractivos especiales para\r\nlos promotores de la revolución, por lo menos para los espíritus más\r\nprácticos; antes bien esa forma de gobierno[495] concitaba peligros,\r\nentre los cuales el más grave era sin duda el de no alcanzar de la\r\nEuropa el anhelado reconocimiento de la independencia.\r\n\r\nSi éstas son razones históricas y por lo tanto ocasionales, otras más\r\nprofundas y de un orden social hicieron el proceso diferente en ambos\r\nextremos de América; y por lo que toca a la del[496] Sur, más dramático\r\ny doloroso que en el Norte. El gobierno español había establecido un\r\nrégimen colonial fundado en la opresión y el egoísmo, dentro de cuyo\r\nprograma absoluto no cabía el ejercicio de la más débil iniciativa\r\nlocal. Tan profundo fué el sello impreso por el ejercicio de este\r\npaternalismo estrecho, que sus resabios son visibles todavía en la vida\r\npolítica de casi todas las naciones que estuvieron un tiempo sometidas a\r\nEspaña. En muchas de ellas la evolución político-democrática ha sido\r\nentendida, a lo sumo, como el paso de la autocracia despótica al\r\npaternalismo benévolo. Aun hoy día el estudioso podría descubrir en la\r\nlegislación de algunos países de la América española, una como\r\npresunción[497] de que el pueblo es el sujeto pasivo de la actividad\r\nsocial ejercida por el Estado, de quien se aguardan todas las\r\niniciativas. El Estado,[498] por su parte, no hace mucho por modificar\r\neste concepto, antes bien se apresura a confirmarlo tomando[499] así\r\ntoda carga que conduzca al progreso social. Hay la tendencia a mirar\r\neste progreso, este resultado, como el fin mismo de la actividad del\r\nEstado y de aquí que esas sociedades casi carezcan[500] de legislación y\r\nde órganos para instaurar procesos sociales que tengan en vista aquellos\r\nresultados, pero en los que intervenga la actividad general, con cuyo\r\nejercicio se perfecciona la verdadera educación democrática.\r\n\r\nSi esto ocurre en la hora presente, no es extraño que en los obscuros\r\ndías de 1810, cuando la institución de la república había caído en\r\ndescrédito, los fundadores de las nacionalidades hispanoamericanas no\r\ntuvieran una idea clara de la función social del gobierno democrático.\r\nAsí se explica la creencia de que la perfección del estado político\r\ndependiera más de cierta virtud intrínseca de las leyes que de la virtud\r\nde los hombres. ¿No deseaban esos próceres \"leyes tan perfectas que[501]\r\nfuera imposible al pueblo contravenirlas\"? Se admitirá pues, que en la\r\nAmérica española la fórmula lincolniana del gobierno _del_ pueblo,\r\n_para_ el pueblo y _por_ el pueblo, habría pecado por exceso,[502] al\r\njuicio de los legisladores que a lo sumo deseaban fundar un gobierno\r\n_para_ el pueblo, pero no veían la posibilidad, ni acaso tampoco la\r\nventaja, de instituir gobiernos del pueblo y por el pueblo, excepto en\r\ncuanto reconocían la necesidad de que[503] los gobernantes estuvieran\r\nidentificados con el pueblo por razón de su origen.[504] Como lo hace\r\nnotar[505] nuestro Sarmiento: \"el cabildo abierto sólo[506] admitía los\r\nnotables de la ciudad, apartando al pueblo del lugar de la reunión, como\r\nlo repiten las actas de la época. En el pueblo vendrían indios, negros,\r\nmestizos, mulatos, y no querían abandonar a números tan heterogéneos la\r\nelección de magistrados, si estos habían de ser blancos, y de la clase\r\nburguesa y municipal.\"\r\n\r\nEn definitiva, todos los caracteres de nuestra revolución proceden de\r\nuna modalidad social de las colonias hispanoamericanas, modalidad sobre\r\ncuyas consecuencias históricas nunca se insistirá[507] demasiado, pues\r\nproporcionan la clave para comprender la evolución política y el estado\r\nactual de esos pueblos. Durante el coloniaje existían allí la más\r\nbrillante cultura y la ignorancia más densa. Por una parte esos países\r\nhabían instituído la educación superior en sus universidades muchos años\r\nantes de que los primeros peregrinos arribasen a Plymouth; por otra, las\r\nclases inferiores de la sociedad unían a su falta de luces, la barbarie\r\ntransmitida en las luchas con los elementos indígenas.\r\n\r\nEstratificada así la sociedad, el historiador puede seguir una línea\r\ncorrespondiente de separación durante todo el proceso histórico. Dos\r\nfactores, diferentes cuando no antagónicos, se desarrollaron[508] en\r\nesas sociedades al sonar la hora de la revolución. El uno el factor\r\nidealista, que pudiéramos decir, se inspiraba en un pensamiento\r\naristocrático, siquiera sea dicho en su estricto sentido etimológico,\r\npuesto que respondía a la convicción de que[509] las clases superiores y\r\ncultas tienen la responsabilidad de tutela social. Para estas clases el\r\nproblema político era un problema filosófico, dependiente en gran parte\r\nde una legislación apropiada. Aunque para los prohombres el gobierno más\r\nperfecto era el que garantizaba el mayor bien al mayor número, ése era\r\nel límite extremo de sus teorías democráticas. Dado el medio en que\r\nactuaban, ninguno de ellos hubiera ido tan lejos como para proclamar el\r\nderecho de todos y de cada uno a contribuir con su expresión individual\r\na formar el ideal colectivo; a constituir, en suma, una nación que fuera\r\nexpresión fiel de la cultura moral y social existente entonces en el\r\npueblo. Ninguno se habría resignado a dejar en manos de las ciegas\r\nmayorías el futuro de la nación. Nadie habría llevado tan lejos su fe en\r\nlos instintos de la colectividad. Creían, pues, en el gobierno de los\r\nmejores, es decir, de los que ellos creían tales, pues para medir los\r\nméritos de los hombres aplicaban el cartabón de la cultura y de la\r\nsabiduría y no el simple magnetismo personal ni otras cualidades\r\nelementales y primitivas, que en los estratos inferiores de la sociedad\r\ndespiertan admiración y deciden la superioridad.\r\n\r\nDe acuerdo con este criterio, las naciones sudamericanas han dado a sus\r\ninstituciones políticas un sello a veces diferente del que imprimieron a\r\nlas suyas las colonias anglo-sajonas, diferencia, por otra parte, que\r\nnadie sería osado a condenar pues son variantes del problema que con su\r\nexistencia plantea desde hace siglo y medio la democracia.[510] Para no\r\ndetenernos sino en uno de esos contrastes, véase el diferente alcance\r\nque las naciones de la América hispánica han dado al concepto\r\n\"representativo\", respecto del sentido que ese término recibe en las\r\nprácticas políticas de la América inglesa. Según éstas, el gobierno\r\nrepresentativo debe reflejar fielmente la fisonomía de la sociedad que\r\nrepresenta; y para asegurar ese carácter, los representantes son\r\nemanación directa de las circunscripciones locales. El gobierno, pues,\r\nno puede nunca ser superior al pueblo, ni acaso para el espíritu de esas\r\nsociedades es deseable que lo fuese. Los países latinoamericanos han\r\ndado a la representación un significado menos estricto, haciendo que los\r\nrepresentantes lo sean[511] en común de las grandes divisiones\r\npolíticas, con lo cual se cumple el propósito de que la representación\r\nrecaiga sobre las personas de mayor prestigio y sabiduría, residentes\r\npor lo general en las capitales y centros importantes.\r\n\r\nEl otro componente de la revolución argentina lo suministra el pueblo\r\nignorante e ineducado, aunque celoso como pocos de su independencia\r\npersonal. A despecho del papel pasivo que con la mejor intención se\r\npretendía hacerle desempeñar[512] en el drama, ese pueblo fué el\r\nverdadero protagonista. Adivinó que llegaba el momento histórico de\r\nactuar y actuó, obrando según sus fieros y primitivos impulsos,\r\nexteriorizando los cuales[513] comenzaba en realidad su larga\r\nauto-educación política. La repugnante arena de las luchas fratricidas\r\nen que se debaten sus crudos intereses, ha sido en realidad la escuela\r\nde la democracia en Sud-América. Los caudillos locales que las turbas\r\nexaltaron, son el exponente y la expresión de las sordas voluntades\r\ncolectivas. Aunque figuras menores[514] de la historia, siniestras a\r\nveces, no por eso son indignas del estudio del sociólogo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ERNESTO NELSON]\r\n\r\nEl factor idealista de la revolución y de la organización nacional tiene\r\nsu campo privativo de acción en la obra legislativa y de pensamiento; el\r\notro en la acción concreta y visible de la negra anarquía y la\r\nsangrienta dictadura. Del choque de ambas corrientes, de su\r\ncompenetración gradual, resulta la fisonomía política actual de la\r\nRepública Argentina, país donde el conflicto entre ambas formas de\r\nacción ha durado menos que en los otros, muchos de los cuales son\r\ntodavía mundos políticos en formación, habiendo algunos[515] en los que\r\nel orden y el equilibrio aun no han aparecido. No sólo ha salvado la\r\nArgentina la época ígnea de las revoluciones, sino que su ambiente\r\nsocial permite ya que prospere en él la forma más delicada de la\r\ndemocracia, o sea el voto[516] secreto, cuyo advenimiento en las\r\nprácticas políticas de la gran república del sur tiene un significativo\r\nvalor filosófico, como prenda de concordia y de colaboración entre las\r\nluces de la cultura y los instintos populares a cuyas inspiraciones esa\r\nley entregó con plena confianza sus[517] destinos futuros. En la\r\nfisonomía actual del país los dos elementos de la evolución social han\r\ndejado impresa su huella. El espíritu democrático, ya madurado,\r\ncoexiste con un pronunciado idealismo, un respeto casi religioso por la\r\ncultura, que ha llevado a las legislaturas y a las mansiones\r\npresidenciales hombres de pensamiento más bien que obreros de acción\r\npráctica, con decidida ventaja a veces para la exaltación del ideal\r\npolítico, si bien con alguna desventaja para la acción concreta\r\ninmediata. La constante calificación de cultura que ha servido de\r\nprincipal requisito al ejercicio del poder, ha impedido que éste caiga\r\nen manos mercenarias o bajo el dominio de inteligencias sin cultura que\r\ndegradasen su función[518] social. Por eso ha sido motivo de sorpresa\r\npara los observadores inadvertidos el encontrar en las repúblicas\r\nlatinas gobiernos no tan representativos como pudiera esperarse de la\r\ngeneral falta de cultura de las masas. Los prestigios del mando, con su\r\nescuela de méritos y de honores para los servidores del país, las\r\nprácticas apenas atemperadas del paternalismo ancestral, han creado el\r\nanhelo del bien público llevado con extrema frecuencia hasta el\r\nsacrificio personal. Y si esta excesiva actividad central acaso obra,\r\nsegún se ha dicho ya, inhibiendo las actividades locales, no hay[519]\r\nduda que ha contribuído a revestir la función política de mayor dignidad\r\ny a darle el carácter de una defensa contra los avances del\r\ncapitalismo. Un tipo tal de democracia traerá tal vez cierto exceso de\r\nintervención oficial que no se advierte en las democracias más\r\nhomogéneas, en las que el estado recibe toda la savia de los estratos\r\ninferiores de la sociedad; pero sin duda evita la maléfica influencia de\r\nlos poderosos intereses privados, de cuya presión son a veces\r\nresultado[520] legislaciones que disimuladamente los sirven.\r\n\r\nSi la legislación constructiva y la demagogia destructiva constituyen\r\nrespectivamente el anverso y el reverso de la vida nacional, en pocos\r\nmomentos de la historia argentina se exhiben con mayor evidencia ni en\r\nforma más irreconciliable que en[521] el acto de celebrarse el Congreso\r\nde Tucumán. Se iniciaba esta asamblea después de seis años[522] de rotas\r\nlas hostilidades con la madre Patria y sucedía a una serie de esfuerzos\r\npor dar forma política definitiva a la nueva nación. El Congreso era un\r\nincidente en el proceso idealista y llevaba[523] involucrados todos los\r\ncaracteres de este último.[524] Así, no fué, ni podía ser, una emanación\r\nnormal de las voluntades populares. Sus organizadores \"poco se cuidaron\r\nde dar a la asamblea un origen democrático\" y apenas representaba ésta\r\nuna parte de las \"provincias unidas\" en cuyo nombre hablaba. Los\r\ncaudillos habían aparecido. Uno[525] de ellos atraía hacia sí a Córdoba,\r\nUruguay, Entre Ríos, Corrientes, y poco después a Santa Fé, mientras el\r\nParaguay se mantenía en su aislamiento. El Congreso procuró pacificar a\r\nlos rebeldes decretando indultos generales, envió delegados para calmar\r\ndesavenencias entre aquellos y hasta empleó la fuerza para sofocar\r\nsediciones que estallaban a su alrededor. Las actividades[526] del\r\nCongreso eran, pues, denegatorias de todo carácter representativo y\r\nsignificaban el ejercicio de una actividad que se invocaba en nombre de\r\nlos principios absolutos más bien que en los de la representación, por\r\nmucho que se estirara el significado de ese concepto. Dada la\r\ndescomposición a que en los seis años de guerra habían conducido los\r\nexcesos del individualismo desenfrenado, el Congreso se abrogó la misión\r\ntutelar a que se sentía llamado, ejerciendo una acción realmente\r\nejecutiva que lo distrajo de los propósitos cardinales para que había\r\nsido convocado, es decir, la declaración de la independencia y para\r\nredactar la constitución que habría de regir la nueva nación.[527]\r\n\r\nEl anverso y el reverso de ese momento histórico están representados,\r\nrespectivamente, en la composición del Congreso por una parte, y la\r\ncomposición de los partidos en lucha, por la otra. El Congreso era la\r\nexpresión más acabada de la cultura del virreinato; sus miembros,\r\nproductos de las universidades de Córdoba,[528] de Charcas,[529] de\r\nSantiago de Chile,[530] del Colegio de San Carlos,[531] todos ellos\r\ncompetentes, poseídos del patriotismo más acendrado. Como sombrío\r\ncontraste, véase el estado general del país,[532] según lo pintó uno de\r\nlos más ilustres miembros del Congreso:[533] \"Divididas las provincias,\r\ndesunidos los pueblos y aun los mismos ciudadanos, rotos los lazos de la\r\nUnión social, inutilizados los resortes todos para mover la máquina,\r\nerigidos los gobiernos sobre bases débiles y viciosas, chocados entre\r\nsí los intereses[534] comunes y particulares de los pueblos,\r\nnegándose[535] algunos al reconocimiento de una autoridad común,\r\nenervadas las fuerzas del estado, agotadas las fuentes de la pública\r\nprosperidad, paralizados los arbitrios para darles un curso conveniente,\r\npujante en gran parte el vicio y extinguidas las virtudes sociales (o\r\npor no conocidas o por inconciliables con el sistema de una libertad mal\r\nentendida), conducidos, en fin, los pueblos por senderos extraños--pero\r\nanálogos a tan funestos principios--a una espantosa anarquía (mal el más\r\ndigno de temerse en el curso de una revolución iniciada por meditados\r\nplanes, sin cálculo en sus progresos y sin una prudente previsión en sus\r\nfines), ¿qué dique más poderoso podía oponerse a este torrente de males\r\npolíticos que amenazaban absorber la patria y sepultarla en sus ríos que\r\nla instalación de un gobierno que salvase la unidad de las provincias,\r\nconciliase su voluntad y reuniera los votos, concentrando en sí el\r\npoder?\"\r\n\r\nA la anterior pintura habría que agregar que la[536] revolución estaba\r\nen una situación desesperada, cercadas como se hallaban las provincias\r\npor fuerzas españolas en Chile y en el Alto Perú. El[537] Congreso\r\nmismo debió trasladarse a Buenos Aires ante la aproximación del enemigo,\r\nque bajaba del[538] Norte.\r\n\r\nEn tales condiciones la valiente declaración de la Independencia, el 9\r\nde julio de 1816, salvó la suerte de las armas galvanizando los\r\nentusiasmos del ejército y convirtiendo la revolución en invasora: pocos\r\nmeses después, en efecto, San Martín cruzará los Andes para batir a\r\nEspaña en Chile, desde donde, unidos los argentinos y los chilenos,\r\niniciarían la expedición libertadora que heriría al enemigo en su\r\ncorazón, Lima, para luego[539] engrosar el ejército de Bolívar a quien\r\ntocaría[540] dar el golpe definitivo al poder español en América.[541]\r\n\r\nDados los caracteres sociológicos de la revolución; dadas, además, las\r\ncircunstancias en que se hallaba el país, según las describiera[542]\r\nFray Cayetano Rodríguez,[543] no es de extrañar[544] que el Congresoc de\r\n1816 fuese monarquista. En su seno, en efecto, se deslizaron los más\r\nextraños proyectos para alzar en el país un trono...: un trono cuya\r\nfuerza fuera capaz de asegurar el orden interior y cuyo prestigio diera\r\nal país las garantías morales y materiales que sin duda reclamaría\r\nEuropa antes de reconocer la independencia de la nueva nación y de\r\nprestarle su poderosa alianza. Se pensó en traer[545] algún miembro de\r\nuna casa real europea, y hasta se propuso restaurar con tal objeto la\r\nantigua monarquía incásica.\r\n\r\nNos parecen absurdos tales proyectos hoy que vemos lozano el árbol de la\r\ndemocracia que a todos los pueblos de América nos cobija; pero no se\r\nolvide que para entonces el Congreso de Viena había arrancado esa planta\r\ndel suelo de Europa como cizaña peligrosa, sin que el débil retoño sajón\r\nhubiera dado todavía los ricos frutos que los tiempos le reservaban.\r\nPara los americanos de hoy, a uno y otro lado del ecuador, el\r\npatriotismo del suelo está reforzado por un patriotismo de principios,\r\nun noble orgullo de haber nacido bajo la estrella de la igualdad de\r\nventajas; pero entonces la libertad no tenía el sentido noble que le han\r\ndado después los triunfos del individualismo. Felizmente, aun cuando el\r\nbando monarquista contaba con opiniones de tanto peso como las de San\r\nMartín y de Belgrano--al segundo de los[546] cuales el Congreso hizo el\r\nhonor de oír en sesión secreta especial--y aun cuando la causa de la\r\ndemocracia tuvo una pobre defensa de parte de uno de los detractores de\r\nla monarquía, la buena[547] doctrina triunfó en esa hora crítica para la\r\nrepública y para la América toda. Como se ve, aquel instante de la\r\nhistoria es un punto de empalme en el cual los destinos del continente\r\nestuvieron en peligro de tomar otro carril que hubiera llevado las ideas\r\ny los hombres por otros campos de la acción política y social,\r\ntransformando la vida de medio hemisferio y afectando tal vez seriamente\r\nla suerte de las instituciones democráticas en los Estados Unidos.\r\nAfortunadamente, en ese minuto supremo, una mano firme[548] se apoderó\r\nde la palanca que podía haber cambiado la marcha y antes de que los\r\ndemás actores se percataran, un gran convoy de pueblos había entrado en\r\nla vía que conduce a los destinos[549] superiores de la humanidad.\r\n\r\nAunque el Congreso no dió al país la constitución que de aquél se\r\nesperaba, salvó, como se ha visto,[550] la suerte de la democracia. Por\r\neste solo hecho la posteridad le ha perdonado su ofuscación, sus\r\nvacilaciones entre el régimen republicano federal por el cual se\r\npronunció primero y el centralista que luego adoptó, y hasta las\r\nveleidades monárquicas en que más tarde reincidió. En cambio, la luz que\r\nencendió en aquella hora vespertina señaló constantemente el puerto\r\nseguro a los pueblos que estuvieron a punto de extraviarse para siempre\r\ncuando cerró la larga noche de la[551] anarquía.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUENOS AIRES EN 1815\r\n\r\nVICENTE FIDEL LÓPEZ\r\n\r\n(TITLE: =Buenos Aires=. The name Buenos Aires goes back to two legends.\r\nThe one says that on landing the settlers exclaimed, \"=¡Qué buenos\r\naires!=\", whence the name. The other, and more likely one, says that the\r\nsailors, hard pressed by bad weather, made vows to \"=la Virgen de Buenos\r\nAires=\", their patron saint, and upon landing safely named the place\r\nBuenos Aires, in gratitude to her.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSe necesita hacer un esfuerzo de imaginación para comprender hoy lo que\r\nera Buenos Aires ahora setenta años. La porción urbana que servía de\r\nasiento a la iniciativa política y gubernamental de la comuna, ocupaba\r\nun radio bastante modesto. Tomando por texto el plano de la ciudad, que,\r\npor orden del virrey Avilés, levantó en el año de 1800 el señor don\r\nPedro Cerviño, agrimensor y piloto muy competente, se ve que los\r\n_suburbios_, es decir, la parte en que no había paredes sino cercos de\r\n_tunales_, comenzaban, por el sur, en las manzanas limitadas hoy por las\r\ncalles de Méjico y de Chile. A ese lado, la ciudad quedaba separada de\r\nsus orillas por esa _avenida_ caudalosa de las lluvias que llaman el\r\n_tercero_ del[552] sur, cuyo nombre antiguo era el _Puente de los\r\nGranados_, porque atravesaba terrenos de la propiedad de la familia de\r\neste nombre, a la que pertenecía la virtuosísima madre de nuestro amigo\r\ny co-redactor D. Juan María Gutiérrez.[553] Allí comenzaban ya los\r\ncercos que encerraban una infinidad de huecos o eriales atravesados por\r\nsendas, y en cuya extensión vivían, en casas muy modestas, no sólo las\r\nfamilias pobres, sino también un extenso número de las de mediana\r\ncondición, sin necesidad y sin idea ninguna de la riqueza. El amueblado\r\nde una familia común podía calcularse, cuando más, entre cien y ciento\r\ncincuenta pesos de plata. Duraba de una generación a la otra, y no se\r\nrenovaba jamás sino por piezas insignificantes. La mesa y el\r\nmantenimiento se reducía, en general, al gasto de dos a[554] cuatro\r\nreales por día, sin dejar de ser abundante y suculenta, porque todos\r\ntenían aves y verduras en sus corrales, y lo único que se compraba era\r\nla carne y el pan.\r\n\r\nEstos suburbios, muy bien caracterizados por Cerviño con el nombre de\r\n_tunales_, se corrían desde el _Puente de los Granados_ (en la calle del\r\nPerú), siguiendo una línea oblicua hacia el noroeste, hasta la plaza de\r\nMonserrat, que quedaba lindera, diremos así, con el despoblado; y que\r\nera por lo mismo un _suburbio_ popular de los más poblados, y muy\r\nturbulento por cierto. La iglesia y la parroquia de la Concepción\r\nquedaban naturalmente entre las quintas y entre los cercos agrestes de\r\nlas _orillas_. Entre Monserrat y la _Plaza Nueva_ (hoy _Mercado del\r\nPlata_) había unas cuantas manzanas de población algo compacta aunque de\r\npura clase pobre; y lo que es hoy calle de _Salta_ quedaba entonces\r\nentre los eriales y los huecos, que eran verdaderos matorrales de\r\nhinojos y de cardos, erizados de arbustos de sauco, y de montes de\r\ndurazneros que servían para abastecer de leña a la población. En toda la\r\nlínea del norte, que es[555] hoy la calle de _Corrientes_, comenzaban de\r\nnuevo los tunales, los huertos, los cercos agrestes, los eriales con\r\nsendas, hasta el _Retiro_, donde estaba la Plaza de Toros, y cuyas\r\ncercanías estaban rústicas y muy pobladas de _orilleros_. Había también\r\npor allí algunas quintas, que eran verdaderas soledades bastante\r\ndifíciles de cuidar: campo de la justicia de los prebostes de la\r\nHermandad.[556]\r\n\r\nEn un país tan pluvioso como el nuestro, formado por terrenos de\r\naluvión, es evidente que entonces no podía haber caminos públicos en un\r\nestado de mediano servicio. Los pantanos rodeaban la ciudad haciendo un\r\nverdadero laberinto de _sendas_ y de _portillos_, que requerían una\r\nespecial vaquía de parte de los que tenían que practicarlos. Más atrás\r\nde la zona solitaria de las quintas, había algunas chacras extensas\r\nerizadas de montes, de espinillos y de durazneros, entre los cuales eran\r\ncélebres, como abrigos de bandidos, el monte de campana cerca de lo que\r\nes hoy la _Floresta_, el monte de Castro, entre Flores y Morón, el\r\ncallejón de Ibáñez; a los que no les iban en zaga otros lugares, que\r\naunque más cercanos, tenían también malísima fama; como el hueco _de los\r\nSauces_, los cercos de los _Ejercicios_, la quinta de _Rivadavia_, el\r\npaso de Burgos, el hueco de _Cabecitas_ y el de _doña Ingracia_; y sobre\r\ntodo, los _zanjones_ del _tercero del norte_, que eran hasta 1830 uno de\r\nlos puntos más selváticos y agrestes que pudiera tener a su costado una\r\nciudad civilizada y revolucionaria[557] como era la de Buenos Aires en\r\n1815.\r\n\r\nEra natural que el centro más urbano y más noble de la Comuna\r\nparticipase en algo de las malas condiciones de sus _suburbios_. La\r\ncarestía de la piedra, la dificultad de sacarla de la Banda Oriental,\r\npor falta de brazos aptos y por falta de buques[558] en que conducirla,\r\nhacían que apenas hubiese[559] una que otra calle, malísimamente\r\nempedrada. Se conocía por calle _del Empedrado_ la que hoy es[560] de la\r\n_Florida_; y no es poca lástima que se le haya quitado este título\r\noriginal de _nobleza_, que le corresponde en la tradición de la cultura\r\nde nuestra ciudad. Las lluvias copiosísimas de aquellos tiempos han\r\ndejado fama en el recuerdo de nuestros padres. Al correr como torrentes,\r\npara salir al río, o para empozarse en los pantanos, se llevaban gran\r\nparte del piso, abriendo curvas de zanjas profundas y de precipicios\r\nentre una y otra acera, y hacían imposible atravesar las calles (fuera\r\nde ocho o diez cuadras en el centro) por otra parte que por las\r\nesquinas, donde había apoyos de grandes piedras puestas a distancia para\r\nafirmar el pie. Era tal este estado, que en la parte que es hoy calle de\r\n_Cangallo_ (entre Florida y Maipú) había lagunas donde se ahogaron\r\nalgunos lecheros en tiempos del virrey Vértiz, como consta de documentos\r\noficiales.\r\n\r\nPor la noche, esta espléndida ciudad de Buenos Aires, que hoy enrojece\r\nsu atmósfera con los reflejos del gas, presentaba un aspecto desolado,\r\nsi es que las tinieblas pueden tener aspecto. A lo largo de la calle del\r\n_Correo_ (hoy _Perú_) se divisaban de un extremo a otro, cuatro\r\nlinternillas diminutas que señalaban las cuatro mesitas en que los\r\nloteros privilegiados por el Cabildo expedían cedulillas, arrimados a la\r\npared y con un pequeño farol que era la única luz de esa calle central.\r\nLas veredas eran de mal ladrillo, húmedas, estrechas, desiguales, y\r\ntemblorosas encima del barrial en que tenían su asiento; y en muy pocas\r\ncalles las había.[561]\r\n\r\nBuenos Aires era una ciudad baja, aplastada y cubierta con las capuchas\r\nde los tejados de feísimo aspecto; que tenía, sin embargo, la reputación\r\nde[562] la belleza entre las otras ciudades españolas. Pero esa fama le\r\nvenía de sus habitantes, más bien que de su suelo. En ambos sexos, ellos\r\neran de espíritu alegre y suelto; de alma impresionable y simpática;\r\nadmiradores entusiastas y copistas ardientes de las grandes novedades de\r\nla civilización. Naturalmente inclinados a lo liberal; con algo de\r\naturdido y de liviano, pero siempre bien inspirados, inclinados a la\r\npompa y halagados por la vanagloria que viene de hacer el bien y de\r\nrealizar hazañas. La sociedad era por esto expansiva y hospitalaria. Su\r\narrogancia era abierta, porque consistía siempre en el anhelo de que su\r\nrevolución y sus progresos sirviesen a todos,[563] e hiciesen de nuestro\r\nsuelo y de nuestras leyes, el abrigo de todas las razas del mundo que no\r\nestuvieran bien avenidas en el suyo.\r\n\r\nTal era entonces la capital, en cuya frente el[564] poeta de la\r\nrevolución había escrito estos versos tan arrogantes como adecuados,\r\nentonces, al genio de la Comuna:\r\n\r\n    Calle Esparta su virtud:\r\n    Su virtud calle Roma;\r\n    ¡Silencio! que al mundo asoma\r\n    La gran capital del Sud.\r\n\r\nPero, ésta era la ciudad que había hecho la Revolución de Mayo, que la\r\nhabía defendido y salvado contra todo el poder de la España, proclamando\r\nlos principios más elevados, más generosos y más humanitarios de la\r\ncivilización moderna. Ésta misma era la ciudad que había vencido y\r\nrendido dos ejércitos ingleses; que había deshecho y apresado tres\r\nescuadras españolas; que había plantado la bandera argentina en las\r\nmurallas de Montevideo; que iba con un paso seguro a reconquistar a\r\nChile, a libertar al Perú, y a llevarle soldados a Bolívar para ganar\r\nla batalla famosa de Junín y libertar a Quito. Para motejar, entonces,\r\nla arrogancia de la cuarteta, sería preciso ver cómo podrían borrarse de\r\nla historia, o como podrían motejarse los hechos gloriosos que la\r\ninspiraron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUENOS AIRES\r\n\r\nLAS TIENDAS ANTIGUAS\r\n\r\nLUCIO V. LÓPEZ\r\n\r\n\r\nNo era entonces Buenos Aires lo que es ahora. La fisonomía de la calle\r\ndel Perú y de la Victoria ha cambiado en los veintidós años\r\ntranscurridos: el _centro_ comenzaba en la calle de la Piedad y[565]\r\nterminaba en la de Potosí, donde la vanguardia de las tiendas estaba\r\nrepresentada por el establecimiento del señor Bolar, local de esquina,\r\nmostrador[566] democrático al alba, cuando cocineras y patronas\r\nmadrugadoras acudían al mercado, y burgués, si no aristocrático, entre\r\nlas siete de la noche y el toque de las ánimas. El barrio de las tiendas\r\nde tono se prolongaba por la calle de la Victoria hasta la de Esmeralda,\r\ny aquellas cinco cuadras constituían en esa época el _boulevard_ de la\r\n_fashion_ de la gran capital.\r\n\r\nLas tiendas europeas de hoy, híbridas y raquíticas, sin carácter local,\r\nhan desterrado la tienda porteña de aquella época, de mostrador[567]\r\ncorrido y gato blanco formal sentado sobre él a guisa de esfinge.\r\n\r\n¡Oh, qué tiendas aquéllas! Me parece que veo sus puertas sin vidrieras,\r\ntapizadas con los últimos percales recibidos, cuyas piezas avanzaban dos\r\no tres metros al exterior sobre la pared de la calle; y entre las piezas\r\nde percal, la pieza de pekín lustroso de medio ancho, clavada también en\r\nel muro, inflándose con el viento y lista para que la mano de la\r\nmarchanta conocedora apreciase la calidad del género entre el índice y\r\nel pulgar, sin obligación de penetrar a la tienda.[568]\r\n\r\nAquélla era buena fé comercial y no la de hoy, en que la enorme vidriera\r\nengolosina sin satisfacer las exigencias del tacto que reclamaban\r\nnuestras madres con un derecho indiscutible. ¡Y qué mozos! ¡Qué\r\nvendedores los de las tiendas de entonces! ¡Cuán lejos están los\r\ntenderos franceses y españoles de hoy de tener la alcurnia y los méritos\r\nsociales de aquella juventud dorada, hija de la tierra, último vástago\r\ndel aristocrático comercio al menudeo de la colonia! No pasaba una\r\nseñora ni una niña sin tributar los más afectuosos saludos a la rueda de\r\ncontertulianos sentados cómodamente en sillas colocadas en la calle y\r\npresididos por el dueño del establecimiento. Y cuando las lindas\r\ntranseuntes penetraban a la tienda, el dueño dejaba a sus amigos,\r\nsaludaba a sus clientas con un efusivo apretón de manos, preguntaba a la\r\nmamá por \"_ese caballero_\",[569] echaba algunos requiebros de buen tono\r\na las[570] señoritas, tomaba el mate de manos del _cadete_ y lo ofrecía\r\na las señoras con la más exquisita amabilidad; y sólo después de haber\r\ncumplido con todas las reglas de este prefacio de la galantería,\r\nentraban clientas y tenderos a tratar de la ardua cuestión de los\r\nnegocios.\r\n\r\nHabía siempre en las tiendas de antaño un olor inextinguible a tripe,\r\nporque nunca faltaban cuatro o seis grandes cilindros de tripe inglés\r\nformados a la entrada de la casa, que, a su calidad de mercadería de\r\nfondo, reunían la ventaja accesoria de servir de poyos para sentarse los\r\ntertulianos[571] habituales del establecimiento. Y después los\r\nmostradores estaban alfombrados con tripes representando todo un jardín\r\nzoológico de fieras estampadas, tigres, panteras, gatos monteses y\r\nleones rubicundos, reposados majestuosamente sobre paisajes historiados\r\nde selvas de lana, con que las fábricas de Manchester reemplazaban en\r\nnuestras mansiones aristocráticas de entonces la carencia de Aubusson y\r\nde Gobelinos[572].\r\n\r\n¡Qué agilidad aquélla con la que el patrón, apoyándose sobre la mano\r\nizquierda, saltaba el mostrador! ¡Qué gracia con la que desplegaba ante\r\nlos ojos de las clientas, de un golpe, y como un prestidigitador, la\r\npieza de percal, de muselina o de _barège_ envuelta alrededor de la\r\ntablilla, que quedaba, desnuda de su preciosa mercancía, abandonada\r\nindiferentemente sobre el mostrador! ¡Qué elasticidad de movimientos,\r\nqué vertiginosa rapidez, la que el tendero de aquel tiempo desplegaba\r\npara medir sobre la vara el lote vendido, dejándolo[573] amontonarse\r\nampulosamente sobre el mostrador con elegante negligencia, acariciando\r\nel género con los dedos, llevándolo a los ojos de la compradora,\r\nponiéndoselo en la mano, restregándolo para justificar la falta absoluta\r\nde goma y otras añagazas de fábrica, y hasta trayendo el único vaso de\r\nla trastienda lleno de agua, para ensopar en él el extremo de la pieza\r\nde muselina y justificar la tinta indeleble de la tela!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCON RUMBO A LA ESPERANZA\r\n\r\nVICENTE BLASCO IBÁÑEZ[574]\r\n\r\n\r\nEuropa pierde anualmente una parte de su población, insignificante por\r\nel número si se la compara con la gran masa humana que habita su suelo,\r\nvaliosa por las iniciativas enérgicas y el coraje que demuestra al\r\nabandonar la tierra patria con rumbo a lo desconocido.\r\n\r\nTodas las semanas apártanse de sus costas enormes buques, que vomitando\r\nhumo se lanzan a través de las infinitas y azules soledades, repleto el\r\ncóncavo vientre de carne humana, que sufre, se agita, sueña o se\r\nestremece con los internos espejismos de la esperanza. Salen de los\r\nmuelles escarchados y brumosos del Báltico; de los puertos ingleses,\r\nnegros de polvo de hulla, en cuyo ambiente grasoso parece esparcirse un\r\nvago perfume de té y tabaco con opio; de las costas de la Francia\r\noceánica, que opone sus bancos vivos de[575] mariscos y los obscuros\r\npinares de sus landas a los rabiosos asaltos del fiero golfo de\r\nGascuña; de las bahías españolas, inmensas copas de tranquilo azul,\r\nsobre las cuales trenzan y destrenzan las gaviotas el blanco aleteo,\r\ncomo asustadas por el intempestivo chirrido de una grúa o el mugido de\r\nuna sirena; de las escalas del Mediterráneo, sonrientes y adormecidas\r\nbajo la ardiente lluvia del sol; ciudades blancas, con la alba crudeza\r\nde la cal o la suave y aristocrática del mármol; ciudades en cuyos\r\nembarcaderos flota un ambiente de hortalizas marchitas y frutos\r\nsazonados, y en las que el viento de tierra lleva hasta los buques,\r\njunto con el nupcial aliento del naranjo y el varonil incienso del\r\nalmendro, briosos rasgueos de la guitarra ibera, los repiqueteos del\r\ntamboril[576] provenzal y lánguidos arpegios de las mandolinas\r\nitalianas.\r\n\r\nLos gigantes marinos mueven las invisibles uñas de sus hélices y se\r\ndespegan de la tierra. Su proa, como un hocico inteligente, parece\r\nhusmear el horizonte para adivinar la senda a traves del infinito, y en\r\ntorno de su grupa rebullen convertidas[577] en jabonosa espuma las aguas\r\ngrises o negruscas de los mares septentrionales, las azules ondulaciones\r\natlánticas o las verdes linfas mediterráneas, pobladas de chisporroteos\r\nde sol y escamas de oro, que pasan y se renuevan como estrellas fugaces\r\nen las glaucas profundidades.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDesapareció la tierra: agua por todas partes. El azul blanquecino del\r\ncielo sobre el azul negrusco[578] de las olas. La proa que se alza hasta\r\nocultar la faja del horizonte o se hunde elevando sobre su ángulo la\r\nlejana línea del mar, como una muralla oscura; la popa, que parece\r\ndesplomarse en el abismo a cada ondulación, o al remontarse acaricia\r\nalgunas veces el espacio con infructuosas paletadas de sus hélices; el\r\nmugir lejano de las máquinas en lo más profundo de las entrañas del\r\nleviatán de acero, revelan únicamente el movimiento,[579] la marcha. Sin\r\nesto el buque parecería inmóvil encantado en medio de la inmensidad[580]\r\ncircular y monótona. Avanza y avanza, y siempre parece estar en el mismo\r\nsitio, en el centro exacto del circo infinito.\r\n\r\n¿Adónde va el buque a través del misterio azul? ¿A qué lejana tierra de\r\nensueño conduce su cargamento de miseria y esperanza?...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHace años, estos férreos transportadores de hombres seguían todos el\r\nmismo rumbo, con la tenacidad rutinaria del rebaño que, una vez\r\naprendido un camino, no sabe salirse de él.[581]\r\n\r\nAl abandonar las costas europeas ponían la proa al Oeste, siguiendo los\r\nmares septentrionales agitados o brumosos. Todos se daban cita en las\r\ncostas de una inmensa nación, tragaderos insaciables[582] de hombres,\r\nolla hirviente de todas las razas, tierra de prodigios monstruosos, de\r\niniciativas desconcertantes en fuerza de ser grandiosas; país rodeado de\r\nuna leyenda de maravillas, con minas de oro más opulentas que las del\r\ntiempo de Salomón,[583] edificios de mayor altura que la torre de\r\nBabel[584] o los pensiles de Semíramis, e invenciones[585] como no las\r\nsoñaron los antiguos magos.\r\n\r\nAhora ya no navegan todos los gigantes del mar con rumbo a los Estados\r\nUnidos de la América del Norte. El camino se ha bifurcado. El colosal\r\nrebaño de humo y acero se reparte, y mientras unos marchan todavía hacia\r\nel Oeste para llevar las últimas provisiones de energía humana al\r\npueblo más progresivo de los tiempos modernos, otros ponen la proa al\r\nSur en busca de un nuevo país abierto a la ilusión y al noble espíritu\r\naventurero de los que desean cambiar de medio.\r\n\r\nEn todas las épocas de la Historia han existido ciudades de renombre\r\nmundial, ciudades-esperanza[586] hacia las cuales se han vuelto con\r\nanhelante deseo los ojos de los hombres. Lo que la gloriosa Atenas fué\r\npara los artistas de remotos siglos, lo que representó Roma para los\r\nvarones del mundo antiguo, que veían en ella un escenario sonoro de[587]\r\nsu actividad intelectual, lo han sido otras poblaciones[588] para los\r\nhombres ansiosos de conquistar rápidamente una posición económica sin\r\ntropezarse con las trabas y obstáculos que oponen las sociedades viejas\r\ny exuberantes de población.\r\n\r\nEl nombre de estas ciudades de prodigios evoca imágenes de suntuosidad y\r\namontonamiento de riquezas; sugiere la visión de fortunas amasadas\r\nvertiginosamente; suena en los oídos con el sugestivo retintín del oro,\r\ny todos los valerosos en el eterno combate de la vida corrieron a ellas\r\ncon la desesperación heroica del que ansía morir o abrirse paso.\r\n\r\nBagdad, la mágica Bagdad de _Las mil y una_[589] _noches_, ha hecho\r\nsoñar durante mil años a los pueblos orientales, que veían en la lejana\r\nmetrópoli del Tigris inmensos tesoros guardados por los genios y las\r\nperis para premios de los buenos.\r\n\r\nLa medioeval Toledo, patria de mágicos prodigiosos,[590] brujos\r\nomnipotentes y alquimistas fabricantes de oro, ocupó la imaginación de\r\nlos europeos siglos y siglos, evocando en su sencilla fantasía montones\r\ninmensos de monedas rutilantes, cuevas rellenas de barras del precioso\r\nmetal, palacios carcomidos, próximos a hundirse bajo el[591] peso de\r\ninauditas riquezas. ¡Ser brujo de Toledo! ¡Poseer la receta misteriosa\r\npara la fabricación del oro!... Esta ilusión estaba tan arraigada en el\r\nalma medioeval, que ha perdurado a través de los siglos, y aun hoy las\r\nviejas judías de Salónica[592] y Constantinopla que guardan las\r\ntradiciones de España, patria de sus mayores, cantan viejos romances a\r\nla gloria de la ciudad del Tajo y sus fantásticas riquezas.\r\n\r\nDurante la colonización hispanoamericana, el renombre de una ciudad casi\r\ndesconocida ahora, conmovió el mundo. ¡Potosí!... Al pronunciar[593]\r\neste nombre veíase con la imaginación un monte inmenso de engañosa\r\ncorteza terrena, en la que bastaba arañar un poco para que quedasen al\r\ndescubierto las entrañas de metal deslumbrador. Semejantes al rey Midas\r\nde la[594] leyenda, que convertía en oro todo cuanto tocaba, los hombres\r\nde este país de maravillas vivían rodeados de una abrumadora y forzosa\r\nsuntuosidad. La plata valía menos que el hierro y la loza grosera. De\r\nplata eran las herramientas del trabajo, los objetos de usos más viles,\r\nlas vajillas ordinarias, y hasta los guijarros con que se apedreaban\r\nlos muchachos.\r\n\r\n¡Potosí! ¡Mágico nombre!... En Europa los labriegos se hacían soldados\r\npara poder llegar en son de conquista al famoso país: los estudiantes y\r\nlos clérigos cambiaban las negras bayetas escolásticas por el coleto de\r\nante y la espada del aventurero: hasta los nobles abandonaban el regalo\r\ny las intrigas de la corte y partían a la conquista del Vellocino,\r\ndespreciando la renta[595] vulgarísima y reposada de sus cortijos,\r\ntoradas y tierras de pan llevar, ante la esperanza de una[596] fortuna\r\ninmensa, rápida, fulminante, en un país donde acababa de realizarse el\r\nsecular ensueño de El Dorado.[597]\r\n\r\nLuego, durante una mitad del siglo XIX, otro nombre de América hizo\r\npalidecer el de la famosa[598] ciudad del Alto Perú. ¡California! ¡Los\r\n_placeres_ de oro inmediatos al Pacífico!... Y los soñadores de Europa\r\nque habían dedicado de antemano su vida a la aventura y al peligro,\r\ncorrieron al encuentro de esta nueva resurrección de la Quimera que\r\nagitaba sus escamas de oro al otro lado[599] de los mares: y las gentes\r\nde simple entendimiento y férrea voluntad les siguieron en esta\r\nperegrinación hacia la riqueza, descuajándose de la existencia\r\nsedentaria, arracándose de las raíces que les unían a la aldea natal, al\r\ncampo alimentador de su estirpe, para afrontar los peligros de una\r\ncorrería errante e incierta.\r\n\r\nHoy todos estos nombres no son más que recuerdos históricos, rótulos\r\nsonoros de ilusiones muertas, de esperanzas hechas polvo. El metal\r\nprecioso, que era su alma, desapareció arrastrado por la circulación\r\nmundial, y sólo queda la mísera[600] máscara que lo contuvo, ruinas que\r\nhablan con su triste aspecto de una esplendidez desaparecida para\r\nsiempre.\r\n\r\nPero la humanidad necesita una ilusión, una esperanza de riqueza que la\r\nacaricie en sus horas de desengaño y penuria, y otro nombre ha venido a\r\nsustituir a los mágicos nombres antiguos:... ¡Buenos Aires!\r\n\r\nEs necesario ser europeo para comprender lo que estas palabras\r\nsignifican en el Viejo Mundo. ¡Buenos Aires!... Al pronunciar este\r\nnombre, la imaginación no ve minas de oro, tesoros resplandecientes que\r\nse ofrecen a la codicia del recién llegado sin más trabajo que agacharse\r\npara poseerlos. Hoy hasta los más ilusos saben que la conquista de la\r\nriqueza supone esfuerzo, y Buenos Aires, a través de las más optimistas\r\nfantasías, aparece siempre como un El Dorado del trabajo. Lo que este\r\nnombre evoca en la mente de los peregrinos mundiales que marchan hacia\r\nla tierra argentina no es una visión de oro, sino de rebaños infinitos,\r\nal lado de los cuales parecen míseras tropillas los ganados bíblicos de\r\nlos profetas y la fortuna pastoril de los pueblos nómadas de la\r\nantigüedad; campos inmensos como un océano terrestre sobre los cuales\r\ntiene el cielo los mismos espejismos y rutilantes atardeceres que sobre\r\nel mar; suelos de maravillosa fecundidad, que sólo hay que abrirlos con\r\nel surco para que surja al momento, en forma de espléndidas cosechas,\r\nuna energía fecundante, resto sin duda de las primeras fuerzas que\r\npresidieron la formación planetaria y que han estado dormidas durante\r\nmiles de siglos en las entrañas del globo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VISTA DEL PUERTO DE BUENOS AIRES\r\n\r\n_Copyright by Underwood & Underwood, N. Y._]\r\n\r\nBuenos Aires, cuyo nombre se confunde con el de todo el país argentino\r\nen la simple imaginación de muchas gentes, significa la fortuna por el\r\ntrabajo. Pero hasta este trabajo tiene algo de maravilloso, de inaudito,\r\nde nunca visto. El trabajo europeo es para el emigrante una esclavitud\r\npenosa, ingrata, degradadora, de la que quiere librarse para siempre:\r\nescasos jornales, que apenas si bastan[601] para la satisfacción de las\r\nnecesidades más primarias; imposibilidad del ahorro como medio de\r\ncambiar algún día de posición; falta absoluta de esperanza de\r\nmejoramiento; largas temporadas de famélico descanso por abundancia\r\nexcesiva de brazos, y por encima de todo esto el fatalismo social del\r\nmundo viejo, que marca al pobre desde que nace, condenándolo a\r\npermanecer eternamente abajo, sin una ilusión, sin un resquicio en su\r\nmísera obscuridad, por donde pase la mano de la Fortuna y le busque a\r\ntientas tirando de él hacia lo alto.\r\n\r\n¡Buenos Aires!... Este nombre hace soñar al desesperado. Al repetirlo\r\nmentalmente se siente fortalecido, con energías centuplicadas para la\r\nlucha. ¡Trabajará! el trabajo no le da miedo. Desarrollará una actividad\r\ntriple o cuádruple que en Europa sin sentir cansancio, porque verá\r\ninmediatamente en sus manos el resultado de sus esfuerzos y conocerá la\r\nremuneración amplia y generosa. Sus brazos van a ser algo solicitado y\r\nrespetado, con un valor positivo, sin el desprecio de la infinita\r\nconcurrencia. Al fin va a entrar en relación con el dinero, antes\r\ninvisible, y el trabajo le buscará, en vez de marchar tras él\r\nimplorándolo como una limosna.\r\n\r\nHay además en todo emigrante algo de esperanza novelesca; la quimera que\r\nacompaña siempre a los hombres, aun a los de pensamiento más\r\nrudimentario, en todas las empresas de su vida. ¡Buenos Aires!... Al\r\nconjuro de este nombre surgen en la memoria historias maravillosas de\r\nrápidas y enormes fortunas; cuentos reales de lo que pudieran llamarse\r\n_Las mil y una noches_ de la riqueza moderna: historias de españoles que\r\nllegaron al suelo argentino sin otro haber que un hato de ropa al\r\nhombro, para juntar en los años de su existencia veinte millones de\r\npesos y extensiones de tierras grandes como provincias: historias de\r\nitalianos que emprendieron el viaje para ser músicos en cualquier\r\nteatrillo de extramuros y acabaron poseyendo centenares de leguas en la\r\nfecunda Pampa. ¿Por qué han de ser ellos los únicos? Lo que ocurre a un\r\nhombre, ¿no puede ocurrirle a otro?\r\n\r\n--¡Quién sabe!... ¡Quién sabe!...\r\n\r\nY murmurando mentalmente palabras de esperanza, se duermen sobre las\r\ncubiertas en la noches templadas de la travesía, unos contra otros,\r\nconfundiendo miserias e ilusiones, como dormían en sus campamentos,\r\nmuchas veces sin comer y transidos de frío, los soldados de Napoleón,\r\npensando en el majestuoso Murat,[602] antiguo mozo de mulas; en el rey\r\nBernadotte[603], nacido en una panadería; en todos los príncipes,\r\nmariscales y monarcas venidos de abajo, lo mismo que el último\r\ngranadero; recuerdos que inflamaban su entusiasmo, borrando con el\r\ncálido esponjazo de la ilusión penalidades y desalientos.\r\n\r\n¡Buenos Aires!... ¿Qué misterioso poder hace circular este nombre por\r\ntoda Europa? ¿A impulsos de qué ley surge siempre con caracteres de\r\nfuego en la negra pesadilla del desesperado que recuerda con terror los\r\ncompromisos y miserias del día siguiente? ¿Quién lo murmura, como un\r\ntenue susurro de esperanza, al oído de todos los que desean cambiar de\r\nsuelo y de existencia?\r\n\r\nAños atrás el Gobierno argentino fomentaba directamente la inmigración,\r\ntenía agentes reclutadores en todas las naciones, pagaba los pasajes;\r\npero ahora hace mucho tiempo que ha abandonado este sistema. Ya no se\r\ncuida de atraer gente, pues tiene confianza en las excelentes\r\ncondiciones del país y sabe que aquélla no ha de faltarle. Deja que el\r\nemigrante llegue a impulsos de su propia voluntad, costeándose el viaje\r\n(con lo que evita en parte el contingente de mendigos profesionales), y\r\nsólo se encarga de auxiliarle y dirigirle desde que pisa el suelo\r\nargentino. ¿Quién, pues, aconseja al emigrante europeo este viaje?\r\n¿Quién ha lanzado el nombre mágico, evocador de esperanzas, en el\r\nescondido valle del centro de Europa, en la casa de madera perdida bajo\r\nlas nieves de la estepa rusa o los fiords noruegos, en la exigua aldea\r\nde pescadores a orillas del Atlántico y del Mediterráneo, o en los\r\nbarrios policromos de las tortuosas y dormidas ciudades de Oriente?...\r\n\r\nSe dirá que los más[604] de los que emigran tienen parientes o amigos\r\nestablecidos desde muchos años antes en la tierra argentina. Cerca de\r\ndos millones de extranjeros viven en ella, y éstos, satisfechos de su\r\nnueva existencia y gozando de una prosperidad--por escasa que\r\nsea--siempre superior a la que disfrutaban en el viejo continente,\r\nejercen una atracción poderosa sobre su lejana patria.\r\n\r\nMuchos de los que se embarcan sienten acallada su zozobra por la\r\nseguridad de que alguien les espera en la orilla americana. El\r\nmuchachuelo español de boina azul que entona canciones en los bailoteos\r\nde a bordo, lleva oculta en el pecho una carta para el paisano y\r\npariente que salió hace años de la aldea asturiana o la casería vasca\r\npara no volver más, sobreviviendo en la memoria de la familia y el\r\nvecindario con el prestigio de lejanas y fabulosas riquezas. El\r\npersonaje omnipotente es almacenero en el campo, tiene un boliche en las\r\ninmensidades de la Pampa o Río Negro, y[605] el muchachuelo, apenas\r\ndesembarque, pasará por Buenos Aires velozmente, yendo a caer en línea\r\nrecta tras un mostrador, centenares de leguas tierra adentro, donde con\r\nuna adaptación sonriente, como si hubiera salido de la casa paterna un\r\ndía antes, comenzará a servir copas a los parroquianos de poncho,\r\nchiripá, bota de potro y sonoras[606] espuelas, que tal vez saluden a un\r\nfuturo millonario en el listo _galleguito_. Los hebreos del lejano\r\nOriente llevan recomendaciones fraternales para sus correligionarios de\r\nBuenos Aires dedicados a industrias urbanas, o para los que cultivan las\r\ncolonias de Entre Ríos. Los italianos cuentan[607] siempre en Argentina\r\nlos parientes a centenares. Algunos de los que van en el buque han hecho\r\nel viaje varias veces. Son _golondrinas_ que llegan[608] en la época de\r\nla recolección de las cosechas, cuando se pagan los jornales a precios\r\nexorbitantes, y luego, con los ahorros bajo el ala, emprenden el viaje\r\nde retorno, tomando el transatlántico como quien toma el tranvía. Muchos\r\nque llegan por primera vez serán colonos, peones del campo, al lado de\r\nlos amigos que les precedieron, o se dedicarán bajo su dirección y\r\nconsejo a todas las faenas urbanas.\r\n\r\nEs cierto que una parte de emigración actual va a la Argentina atraída\r\npor los compatriotas que hicieron antes el viaje, o recomendada a éstos.\r\nPero, ¿quién atrajo y aconsejó a los que llegaron primeramente por su\r\npropia iniciativa? ¿Quién impulsa ahora a los que se presentan solos,\r\nsin apoyos ni conocimientos, fiados al buen gesto del destino? ¿Quién ha\r\nhecho que el recuerdo de Buenos Aires surja como una suprema solución en\r\nel ánimo de todo europeo que atraviesa uno de esos conflictos que\r\ncambian una vida?\r\n\r\nCada grupo cosmopolita que llega a los muelles de Buenos Aires es una\r\nnueva prueba de la fama mundial de la ciudad-esperanza, moderna Sión\r\npara todos los que ansían paz, trabajo y bienestar.\r\n\r\nSu nombre circula por el mundo viejo como una brisa dulce que despierta\r\nlas almas adormecidas. Las razas sin patria y los pueblos que empiezan a\r\ndudar de la que tienen por no encontrar en su seno más que pobrezas y\r\nopresiones, sienten como un rejuvenecimiento al pensar en este país\r\nmaravilloso donde se realizan los más asombrosos _avatares_. Es la\r\ntierra donde el holgazán se siente activo, el apático se mueve con los\r\nentusiasmos del optimismo, y el que era en el viejo continente torpe e\r\ninútil, deformado por la estrechez del ambiente natal, surge del duro\r\nquiste rutinario con originales iniciativas, como si le inspirase el\r\nnuevo medio.\r\n\r\n\"¡Buenos Aires!\", murmura el viento en las noches invernales, al colarse\r\npor el cañon de la chimenea en la cocina campestre, española o\r\nitaliana, donde la familia pasa las horas triste y silenciosa, rumiando\r\ncómo podrá evitar al día siguiente el embargo de los cuatro terrones\r\nque[609] constituyen su fortuna, o cómo adquirirá el pan necesario:\r\n\"¡Buenos Aires!\", muge el vendaval cargado de copos de nieve al\r\nfiltrarse por entre los maderos de la isba rusa: \"¡Buenos Aires!\",\r\nparece escribir el sol en arabescos temblones de[610] luces y sombras en\r\nlos muros calizos de la callejuela oriental, ante los ojos del pobre\r\notomano, encorvado por la servidumbre y el miedo: \"¡Buenos Aires!\",\r\nrepiten las alas de oro de la Ilusión cuando vuela de reverbero en\r\nreverbero, a altas horas de la noche, por los desiertos bulevares[611]\r\nde las grandes metrópolis europeas, precediendo los pasos del pobre\r\ndesesperado, sin hogar, sin pan, que estudió para morirse de hambre, que\r\nha visto fracasadas por falta de ambiente todas sus iniciativas, y tal\r\nvez piensa en el suicidio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VICENTE BLASCO IBÁÑEZ\r\n\r\n_Blasco Ibáñez, Argentina y sus grandezas_]\r\n\r\nY todos, sin distinción de razas y clases, ignorantes e intelectuales,\r\nfuertes o humildes, al conjuro de este nombre ven alzarse en el último\r\ntérmino del paisaje de su fantasía, bañada por la luz verde de la\r\nesperanza, una mujer majestuosa, pero de esbeltez juvenil, sin la\r\npesadez imponente de la matrona; una mujer blanca y azul como las[612]\r\nvírgenes soñadas por Murillo, con el purpúreo[613] tocado, signo de\r\nlibertad, sobre la suelta cabellera; una mujer que sonríe abriendo en\r\ncruz los brazos amorosos y deja caer desde su altura de montaña palabras\r\nque revolotean como pétalos de rosa y mariposas de oro.\r\n\r\n--Venid a mí, los que tenéis hambre de pan y sed de libertad. Venid a\r\nmí, los que llegasteis tarde a un mundo demasiado repleto. Mi hogar es\r\ngrande; mi casa no la construyó el egoísmo. Está abierta a todas las\r\nrazas de la tierra, a todos los hombres de buena voluntad.--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEl buque sigue avanzando. Cambia el cielo y cambia el mar. Hay días en\r\nque el férreo vaso cabecea con mayor violencia sobre las olas y la\r\nmuchedumbre aparece menos espesa, con grandes claros. Los que se sienten\r\nheridos por el mareo, ocúltanse en las profundidades del buque. Otros\r\npermanecen tendidos al aire libre, pálidos, inmóviles como cadáveres\r\ndespués de una catástrofe. Ya no suenan músicas: una tristeza gris\r\nparece gravitar sobre la cubierta, rociada de vez en cuando por el\r\npolvo acuoso de las olas, que chocan contra los flancos de la nave,\r\nlevantando una cortina de espumas. Los habituados al viaje, que llevan a\r\nprevención como supremo lujo[614] un asiento de tijera o una silla de\r\nlona, permanecen sentados, fuman y miran al mar con aire de conocedores,\r\ninsensibles a la general molestia que parece enseñorearse del buque.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCuando las muchedumbres europeas de la primera Cruzada, armadas al azar,\r\ny sin otra disciplina que el entusiasmo religioso, caminaban hacia\r\nOriente, su fe y su ignorancia les hacían sufrir tremendas decepciones.\r\n\r\nSiempre que en el horizonte aparecían las torres y cúpulas de una\r\nciudad, la piadosa e inocente turba estremecíase de gozo.\r\n\r\n--¿No es Jerusalén?... Sí: es Jerusalén; la ciudad santa. ¡Hosanna!\r\n¡Hosanna!\r\n\r\nLos viejos gemían enternecidos; los monjes lanzaban su inflamada\r\npredicación; los hombres requerían las armas, creyendo llegado el\r\nmomento de pelear contra los infieles; los niños entonaban cánticos y\r\nlas hembras gritaban de entusiasmo, incorporándose en los carretones, a\r\nla cola del inmenso éxodo.\r\n\r\nEstos infelices cruzados, cuando imaginaban hallarse próximos a\r\nJerusalén, estaban aún en las llanuras de la Baja Alemania o de Austria,\r\ny el espejismo del entusiasmo repetíase todos los días al avanzar por\r\nel centro de Europa, creyendo haber llegado al término de la jornada\r\ncada vez que columbraban a lo lejos una ciudad o un castillo.\r\n\r\nLa misma ilusión del deseo acompaña a los pobres emigrantes, entusiastas\r\ncruzados de los tiempos modernos. La ansiada Jerusalén surge ante sus\r\nojos en toda ribera que costea el buque, en todo puerto donde echa el\r\nancla.\r\n\r\n¡Buenos Aires! ¿Dónde está Buenos Aires?... Un estremecimiento de\r\nesperanza corre por la muchedumbre cuando aparece frente a la proa una\r\nfaja de tierra. Hasta los más ignorantes conocen la cantidad de días que\r\ndebe durar la navegación; pero la ansiedad les hace creer en un milagro,\r\nen una marcha extraordinaria del buque, y al ver la tierra, se gritan\r\nunos a otros:\r\n\r\n--¡Buenos Aires!... ¿Será esto Buenos Aires?\r\n\r\nNo: no es la ciudad-ilusión. Es Pernambuco, es Bahía, es Río Janeiro; y\r\ncuando el transatlántico queda fondeado a la vista de la tierra, los\r\nperegrinos se agolpan en la borda, mirando la ciudad lejana, pero sin\r\ndeseos de bajar a ella, faltos de curiosidad. Para ellos no hay nada que\r\nles interese en este país: su esperanza vuela más lejos.\r\n\r\nLos que hacen el viaje por primera vez, admiran el color negro y la\r\ncrespa y lanuda pelambrera de los lancheros; compran las frutas raras\r\namontonadas en las barcas que circulan como insectos en torno del\r\ngigante marino; admiran su sabor exótico, y al fin acaban por volver la\r\nespalda a la costa, tendiéndose en sus mantas y colchonetas, aburridos\r\nde esta inercia, deseando reanudar antes el viaje. Buenos Aires es lo\r\nque les importa. ¿Cuándo llegarán a Buenos Aires?...\r\n\r\nEn la espléndida bahía de Río Janeiro, la hermosura del panorama los\r\nconmueve unos instantes. Luego reaparece la indiferencia. Ellos no han\r\nde vivir en esta tierra; ¿para qué interesarse por sus montañas rosadas\r\nde bizarras formas, y sus calles blancas, con dobles filas de altos\r\ncocoteros?\r\n\r\nCuando el transatlántico emprende otra vez la marcha, la gente canta y\r\nríe, creyéndose próxima al término del viaje. Ya no aguardarán más: casi\r\nse hallan a la vista de la ciudad de la esperanza: la próxima escala es\r\nBuenos Aires. Y transcurren varios días sin ver otra cosa que cielo y\r\nmar. Algunas veces se marcan en la línea del horizonte manchas obscuras\r\nque parecen nubes bajas y son montañas.\r\n\r\nEl aislamiento de la navegación, la vida común con gentes tan diversas\r\nen medio de la soledad de los elementos, la marcha hacia otro mundo\r\nmisterioso, parece haber transformado la moral de los emigrantes,\r\ncreando en ellos una nueva personalidad. ¡Adiós, timideces del terruño,\r\nhumildades de familia, miedos rutinarios a todo lo que se sale de la\r\nestrecha norma de lo vulgar!\r\n\r\nEl pobre campesino, acostumbrado en su país al expolio y la miseria\r\nresignada, se siente ahora altivo, con nuevas fuerzas para hacer frente\r\na todos los obstáculos. El viento del océano, al ensanchar sus pulmones,\r\nparece echarle atrás los hombros, dando a la cabeza una erguida altivez.\r\nOyendo a los aventureros, a todas estas gentes de extraños países,\r\nempieza a considerar con cierto orgullo su condición de emigrante y de\r\npobre. La soledad atlántica, las largas horas de recogimiento, lejos de\r\ntoda organización social, le hacen apreciar la pequeñez de los hombres y\r\nde sus leyes, y se contempla a sí mismo más grande, más poderoso. Las\r\npreocupaciones que en tierra firme fueron muchas veces su tormento, las\r\ndesprecia ahora por insignificantes, viéndose lejos de ellas.\r\n\r\nEl hombre del viejo mundo desaparece. Cada singladura se lleva algo de\r\nsu antiguo sér. Van[615] desapareciéndose de su ánimo las timideces y\r\nresignaciones de la educación tradicional. Son a modo de escamas del\r\nprimitivo organismo que se despegan de la piel y caen al agua. Cada día\r\npierde una. Cuando llegue al término de su viaje será otro.\r\n\r\nSiéntese capaz de las grandes iniciativas. El pobre de Europa, sometido,\r\ny a la huelga, sin esperanzas, sin afanes de actividad, que al fin tuvo\r\nque embarcarse y emigrar, le parece ahora un hombre distinto. ¡Lo que\r\ntrabajará él en el[616] Nuevo Mundo! Hará fortuna a las buenas o las\r\nmalas. Siente en su ánimo la fría audacia, el egoísmo homicida de los\r\naventureros que todo lo justifican con las necesidades imperiosas de la\r\nlucha por la existencia. Su alma es la de los héroes de Balzac que\r\ncontemplaban París desde una[617] altura, con ojos de invasor implacable\r\ny desdeñoso, murmurando: \"¡Tú serás mío!\"[618]\r\n\r\n¡Buenos Aires!... Él conquistará la gran ciudad; se batirá con ella a\r\nbrazo partido para poseerla, para dominarla. Aislado en el mar, lejos de\r\nla realidad, en plena fantasmagoría de la ilusión, se considera capaz de\r\nlos más estupendos esfuerzos. En sus conquistas imaginativas entra[619]\r\npor mucho el desconocimiento del país adonde se dirige, esa ignorancia\r\nde América que es en el viejo mundo algo secular e inconmovible. Sabe\r\nque Buenos Aires es una gran ciudad, se la imagina semejante a una buena\r\ncapital de provincia pero al mismo tiempo, con bizarra confusión\r\nimaginativa, ve tigres que saltan y juguetean como gatos en los\r\nalrededores de la urbe; serpientes colosales que ondulan o se arrollan a\r\nlos árboles de los paseos; negros indolentes a los que hay que dar con\r\nel látigo para que trabajen; indios pintarrajeados y emplumados que\r\nasaltan los tranvías de los arrabales y se llevan cautivas a las\r\nseñoras; una mezcla de civilización avanzadísima y de tremenda barbarie.\r\n¡Desdichado país si no vinieran de afuera los hombres blancos para\r\nsalvarlo!... El alma de un paladín de romances de caballería late en él,\r\nquitando todo valor a la palabra \"imposible\". Matará, si es preciso,\r\ntigres y pitones; hará prisiones a los feroces indios y, pasándoles una\r\nanilla por la nariz, los llevará a trabajar ricas tierras, escogidas a\r\nsu gusto. ¡Él lo hará todo!...\r\n\r\nLas olas violentas que chocan contra el buque han cambiado de color.\r\nAhora son rojizas, como una melena leonada, y sucias por el barro que\r\nllevan en suspensión. Se ve el lejano perfil de una costa por estribor,\r\ny los emigrantes abren los ojos asombrados al oír que ya no están en el\r\nmar, que este espacio infinito de agua, con su oleaje tempestuoso, es un\r\nrío, el famoso río de la Plata.\r\n\r\nEmpieza a anochecer, y en la costa, cada vez más cercana, se marcan\r\ncentenares de luces. Al principio, forman líneas, como si indicasen la\r\nhorizontalidad de caminos y bulevares exteriores; luego se hacen más\r\ndensas, se agrupan, se remontan por invisibles cuestas, se diferencian\r\nen rojas y blancas, destacándose las eléctricas como gotas caídas de la\r\nluna, entre las temblonas pinceladas del gas.[620]\r\n\r\n--¡Buenos Aires! ¡Viva Buenos Aires!--gritan a proa, con entusiasmo de\r\nperegrinos.\r\n\r\nNo, tampoco es Buenos Aires. Es Montevideo.\r\n\r\nEl buque tras una detención de algunas horas, sigue su rumbo. Ahora\r\nparece que navega sobre algodones. Los pasajeros, acostumbrados al\r\nmovimiento de todo cuanto les rodea, a sentir ondular el piso bajo sus\r\nplantas, a la oscilación general de los objetos, experimentan una\r\nextrañeza casi molesta, al ver que el buque avanza, y, sin embargo,\r\nparece inmóvil. El río, obscuro, toma[621] blancuras de leche bajo la\r\nluz de las farolas de los buques. Una línea de boyas encendidas marca el\r\npaso a las embarcaciones en esta inmensidad.\r\n\r\nLa placidez de la navegación, el momentáneo silencio, el descansar de\r\nmaderas y hierros que han venido frotándose y cantando un monótono\r\n_ric-ric_ durante medio mes, todo invita al sueño; y sin embargo, pocos\r\nduermen.\r\n\r\nLa gente, tendida en la cubierta y en los sollados, sueña con los ojos\r\nabiertos. Percibe la proximidad de algo extraordinario, algo que la\r\nestremece con la emoción de lo desconocido. Cree oír la respiración de\r\nun organismo enorme. Buenos Aires está cerca. Y los que ansiaban tanto\r\nllegar a ella, vacilan ahora y tiemblan. ¡Adiós, fantasías de la\r\nsoledad! Ya se hallan vecinos a la gran Esfinge. ¿Cómo irá a\r\nrecibirles?...\r\n\r\nLos bravos exterminadores de serpientes y de indios empiezan a dudar de\r\nsus fuerzas. Hay algo en el ambiente que repele estas fantasmagorías,\r\nque ríe de ellas, como los buenos vecinos de la[622] Mancha reían de los\r\nheroicos e irreales propósitos del esforzado hidalgo. El emigrante\r\nempieza a sentirse igual a como era antes de poner el pie en el\r\ntransatlántico. ¡Acabaron los ensueños del mar! Reaparecen sus\r\nindecisiones, sus timideces, su falta de confianza en la suerte.\r\n\r\nEl animal humano está próximo, la sociedad sale a su encuentro, y esto\r\nbasta para que se desvanezca[623] el superhombre de vida fugaz\r\nengendrado en las soledades de la navegación; el héroe de todos los\r\narrojos, que no reconocía obstáculos.\r\n\r\nApenas apunta el día, la cubierta se llena de gente. Las boyas luminosas\r\ndestacan sus luces cabeceantes en la penumbra del crepúsculo. Todos se\r\nagolpan en la proa deseosos de ser los primeros en contemplar la\r\nesperada visión.\r\n\r\n--¡Buenos Aires!... ¿Dónde está Buenos Aires?\r\n\r\nUna cortina de niebla oculta el horizonte. La sirena del buque ruge a\r\nciegas en este ambiente blanco y denso, semejante al de los mares\r\nseptentrionales. El agua, de un color lácteo, a impulsos de la marea\r\nascendente, choca con manso susurro contra los costados de la nave. A\r\ntravés de los espesos telones de la atmósfera pasan otras sombras,\r\nlentas, enormes y negras: vapores que avanzan con la grave calma del\r\npeligro; veleros de arboladura escueta que se deslizan siguiendo sumisos\r\nel tirón del remolcador.\r\n\r\nDe pronto, el transatlántico modera su leve marcha; apenas se mueve ya.\r\nAl mismo tiempo desgárranse los velos del horizonte y la luz pálida de\r\nla mañana saca de la bruma todo un mundo. Aparece a ambos lados del\r\nbuque el río inmenso, sin orillas, como un mar de dilatados horizontes,\r\ny frente a la proa una ciudad, más bien dicho, una extensión cubierta de\r\nedificios, ilimitada, sin términos visibles, infinita como la superficie\r\nacuática.\r\n\r\n--¡Buenos Aires! ¡Al fin!... Esto es Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\nLa retina no puede abarcar los muelles, que se[624] pierden de vista;\r\nlas dársenas llenas de buques, que se esfuman en el horizonte; los\r\nalmacenes y elevadores de trigo, altos y majestuosos como catedrales;\r\nlas arboledas que siguen la ribera; las calzadas polvorientas por donde\r\npasan trenes y rosarios interminables de carretas. Detrás, altos\r\nedificios y suaves rampas marcan una altura, una cuchilla de tierra, el\r\nperfil de una meseta de contornos pulidos por el secular arrastre del\r\nrío; y sobre esta meseta se extiende la urbe, uniforme, baja, monótona,\r\npero de una grandiosidad inabarcable; una ondulación de tejados grises,\r\nque se pierde en el horizonte, que avanza tierra adentro, borrando toda\r\nidea de límites, desorientando a las imaginaciones, que en vano pugnan\r\npor abrazarla; un caparazón gigantesco, en el cual cada escama es la\r\ncubierta de una vivienda; un escudo inmenso e igual, del que sobresalen\r\ntorres y cúpulas como un adorno de clavos, y borlones de seda verde, que\r\nson frondosos jardines.\r\n\r\nLos que llegan se sienten intimidados por esta enormidad. La capital\r\ngigantesca parece caer sobre ellos con mortal gravitación.\r\n\r\n--¡Qué grande!... ¡Qué grande!...\r\n\r\n¡Adiós arrogantes propósitos de conquista, gallardías audaces de\r\ndominación y rápido encumbramiento! Es la ciudad la que conquista a los\r\nrecién venidos, la que los hace sus esclavos, tímidos y sumisos, con\r\nsólo mostrarse un momento, fría y casi dormida entre las brumas del\r\namanecer.\r\n\r\nMuchos de los que llegan nacieron en una aldea o en el campo; no han\r\nvisto otras ciudades que las de los puertos de embarque, y quedan\r\nespantados, enmudecidos por el respeto y el pavor a la vista de esta\r\ngran metrópoli de rápidas transformaciones, que todo lo encuentra\r\nestrecho, que rompe cada cinco años el traje de albañilería que le\r\nfabrican los hombres, y crece y crece, no reconociendo fronteras en su\r\ndesarrollo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUENOS AIRES: LOS ELEVADORES\r\n\r\n_Copyright by Newman Traveltalks and Brown & Dawson, N. Y._]\r\n\r\nLisboa es más escenográfica, con su caserío en cuesta que permite\r\napreciar las grandezas de[625] la edificación: Río Janeiro realza su\r\nbelleza arquitectónica dentro de un estuche de verdura, entre montañas\r\nque forman un marco rosado a la copa de su bahía; pero los emigrantes\r\nexperimentan una impresión más profunda, de asombro y anonadamiento, a\r\nla vista de Buenos Aires. Sus frentes se contraen; sus ojos miran con\r\nincertidumbre.\r\n\r\n--¡Qué grande!... ¡Qué grande!...\r\n\r\nY todos piensan con una emoción parecida al miedo, en lo que les aguarda\r\ndentro de este caserío achatado, monótono, infinito, igual a la concha\r\nprotectora de una gran bestia prehistórica.\r\n\r\nAvanza lentamente el transatlántico, con ligeras pausas de inmovilidad,\r\ncomo si fuese tanteando el camino para evitarse un encontrón. Navega\r\nentre diques, y va a atracar dulcemente en un amplio muelle defendido\r\npor una cubierta de acero y cristales, como una estación de ferrocarril.\r\n\r\nEn el desembarcadero se reúnen grupos de curiosos. Los marineros de la\r\nvigilancia marítima, con el machete al cinto, forman fila para contener\r\nal gentío que pretende avanzar y llama a gritos a los amigos que llegan\r\nen el buque. La policía huronea y mira con ojos inquietos, temiendo el\r\ndesembarco de gentes peligrosas, de elementos de desorden barridos por\r\nlas aventuras del viejo mundo.\r\n\r\n¡Cuán pequeño es ahora el transatlántico! Pegado a tierra puede\r\napreciarse mejor su grandeza, y, sin embargo, parece más mezquino, más\r\ninsignificante que en medio de los amplios puertos donde echó sus anclas\r\nantes de llegar aquí. La comparación con centenares y centenares de\r\notros buques, que alineados en las tranquilas aguas del río, entre\r\nmuelles, diques y puentes se esfuman en el horizonte, borra la\r\napreciación de su tamaño. La cantidad desvanece el valor de la\r\ndimensión. ¡Son tantos y están tan agrupados los gigantes marinos!...\r\nCada uno de estos buques, destacándose aislado en medio del azul de una\r\nbahía, puede admirar por la grandeza y arrogancia de sus proporciones.\r\nAquí no es nada; se pierde entre sus compañeros en una extensión\r\nacuática de catorce kilómetros: es una chimenea más entre centenares de\r\nchimeneas; dos mástiles que vienen a confundirse en la inmensa selva de\r\npalos y cordajes sobre la que revolotean las banderas como mariposas de\r\ncolores.\r\n\r\nLas dársenas, enormes plazas de agua, no son dársenas: son corrales de\r\nbuques donde se aglomeran los monstruos flotantes como doméstico rebaño.\r\n\r\nLos mercenarios de _Salambó_,[626] al marchar de Cartago, veían con\r\ncierta inquietud, clavadas a los árboles por los cuatro remos, bestias\r\nmoribundas que agitaban su roja melena entre estertores agónicos.\r\n\r\n--¿Qué nación es ésta que crucifica a los leones?...--murmuraban\r\nasombrados los personajes de Flaubert.\r\n\r\nAlgo semejante piensa el viajero al llegar al puerto de Buenos Aires, en\r\nuna mañana fría y brumosa.\r\n\r\n--¿Qué pueblo es éste que trata a los gigantes del mar como si fueran\r\nreses?...\r\n\r\nTodos los días se presentan en sus muelles enormes transatlánticos,\r\nmansos, lentos, como vacas rojas o negras que vinieran a pastar en las\r\npraderas azules del océano. Detiénense junto a sus almacenes para ser\r\nordeñados por la poderosa ciudad, a la que dan generoso alimento; y\r\ncuando sus entrañas están exhaustas, cuando han soltado el chorro de\r\nhombres y hasta la última gota sólida del cargamento, Buenos Aires les\r\nda con un pie en[627] la amplia grupa, enviándolos a descansar en sus\r\ninmensos corrales de agua. Entran en una dársena, y si en ella no hay\r\nlugar, se trasladan a otra, y luego a otra, pasando entre murallas,\r\napartando[628] puentes, seguidos de remolcadores que silban, corren y\r\nrodean el pesado rebaño de leviatanes como si fuesen sus zagales. Y en\r\nlos inmensos apriscos acuáticos descansan los monstruos varios días,\r\nrecibiendo la alimentación de tierra adentro, que les sirven grúas y\r\nelevadores, hasta que repletas sus entrañas de vigorosas riquezas y con\r\nnueva sangre negra en las carboneras, vuelven a emprender la marcha, río\r\nabajo, hacia los azules[629] campos.\r\n\r\nYa atracó la nave. Se arrancan los emigrantes de la contemplación de la\r\nciudad, para arrollar y enfardar sus ropas. El puente ha quedado tendido\r\ndesde el muelle a un costado del buque. ¡Gente a tierra!... Las mujeres\r\ntoman de la mano sus ristras de pequeñuelos y se colocan sobre la\r\ncabeza, como enorme turbante, el atado de ropas. Los hombres se\r\nconcorvan bajo los fardos de mantas y colchones. Algunos, pobremente\r\nvestidos de señoritos, desembarcan con las manos en los bolsillos,\r\nsilbando para distraer su emoción. Otros llevan por todo equipaje una\r\nguitarra y saludan con gritos y risotadas a los amigos que les esperan\r\nen el muelle.\r\n\r\nEl rebaño de miseria y esperanza desfila y desfila hacia lo desconocido.\r\n¿Qué les aguardará en el interior de este monstruo gris y achatado que\r\ntodos los días devora su ración humana?...\r\n\r\nLos peregrinos pasan y pasan por el puente de madera, bajo la mirada\r\nescrutadora de la policía. ¡Ni una palabra! El ambiente es de libertad.\r\nEl Hotel de Emigrantes ofrece asilo a los que se presentan sin amigos y\r\nrecomendaciones. Las oficinas están abiertas para los que llegan\r\ndesvalidos, sin un propósito determinado. La nueva tierra les ofrece\r\ncama, alimento y el ferrocarril o los vapores fluviales necesarios para\r\nque se trasladen al interior, donde hay demanda de brazos.\r\n\r\nLos que llegan no encuentran obstáculos, y, sin embargo, parecen\r\ncohibidos, atemorizados.\r\n\r\n\"¡Ay, Buenos Aires!... ¡Tan grande!... ¡Tan grande!...\"\r\n\r\nLa inmensa metrópoli sudamericana pesa sobre ellos con toda su\r\nenormidad.\r\n\r\nNadie echa ya la cabeza atrás con arrogancia belicosa, ni saca el pecho\r\nfanfarronamente. Las frentes se bajan a impulsos de la inquietud; las\r\nespaldas parecen encorvarse como si sintieran por adelantado el peso de\r\nuna vida de laboriosidad que va a empezar.\r\n\r\nY los soñadores del océano, que fantasearon las más absurdas grandezas\r\ncomo final de su viaje, entran a la nueva vida por un camino fácil,\r\nencontrando inmediatamente el trabajo y el pan; pero entran\r\ncabizbajos... como animales domados... como ilusos que despiertan para\r\ncaer en la realidad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUENOS AIRES: LA AVENIDA DE MAYO\r\n\r\n_Copyright by Newman Traveltalks and Brown & Dawson, N.

Towards the end of the year 1902 the internal dissensions\r\nof the republic of Venezuela and the mismanagement of Dictator Castro's\r\nadministration caused the destruction of much foreign capital, and\r\nfinally led to the repudiation of loans contracted by Venezuela in\r\nEurope. The situation became acute when in 1903 England, Germany, and\r\nItaly sent a combined fleet to blockade the ports of Venezuela. Castro\r\nappealed to the United States, claiming that the Monroe Doctrine was\r\nbeing violated. The matter, at the instance of the United States, was\r\nfinally settled by the Hague Court of Arbitration, which decided that\r\nVenezuela should meet the British, German, and Italian claims. Previous\r\nto the blockade Argentina, through her secretary of state, Drago, sent\r\nthe following note to the United States, protesting against the use of\r\nforce on the part of any foreign nation to collect indemnities due to\r\ntheir subjects, or installments on loans. This further extension of the\r\nMonroe Doctrine is called by the Argentineans the Drago Doctrine.)\r\n\r\nBuenos Aires, 29 de Diciembre de 1902\r\n\r\nSeñor ministro:\r\n\r\nHe recibido telegrama de V. E., fecha 20 del corriente, relativo a los\r\nsucesos últimamente ocurridos entre el gobierno de la República de\r\nVenezuela y los de la Gran Bretaña y la Alemania. Según los informes de\r\nV. E., el origen del conflicto debe atribuirse en parte a perjuicios\r\nsufridos por súbditos de las naciones reclamantes, durante las\r\nrevoluciones y guerras que recientemente han tenido lugar en el\r\nterritorio de aquella república y en parte también a que ciertos\r\nservicios de la deuda externa del Estado no han sido satisfechos en la\r\noportunidad debida.[630]\r\n\r\nPrescindiendo del primer género de reclamaciones, para cuya adecuada\r\napreciación habría[631] que atender siempre las leyes de los respectivos\r\npaíses, este gobierno ha estimado de oportunidad transmitir a V. E.\r\nalgunas consideraciones relativas al cobro compulsivo de la deuda\r\npública, tales como las han sugerido los hechos ocurridos.\r\n\r\nDesde luego se advierte, a este respecto, que[632] el capitalista que\r\nsuministra su dinero a un Estado extranjero, tiene siempre en cuenta\r\ncuales son los recursos del país en que va a actuar, y la mayor o menor\r\nprobabilidad de que los compromisos contraídos se cumplan sin\r\ntropiezo.[633]\r\n\r\nTodos los gobiernos gozan por ello de diferente crédito, según su grado\r\nde civilización y cultura y su conducta en los negocios, y estas\r\ncircunstancias se miden y se pesan antes de contraer ningún empréstito,\r\nhaciendo más o menos onerosas sus condiciones, con arreglo a los datos\r\nprecisos que en este sentido tienen perfectamente registrados[634] los\r\nbanqueros.\r\n\r\nLuego, el acreedor sabe que contrata con una entidad soberana y es\r\ncondición inherente de toda soberanía que no pueda iniciarse ni\r\ncumplirse procedimientos ejecutivos contra ella, y que ese modo de cobro\r\ncomprometería su existencia misma, haciendo desaparecer la independencia\r\ny la acción[635] del respectivo gobierno.\r\n\r\nEntre los principios fundamentales del derecho público internacional que\r\nla humanidad ha consagrado, es uno de los más preciosos el que determina\r\nque todos los Estados, cualquiera que sea la fuerza de que dispongan,\r\nson entidades de derecho, perfectamente iguales entre sí y\r\nrecíprocamente acreedoras por ello a las mismas consideraciones y\r\nrespeto.\r\n\r\nEl reconocimiento de la deuda, la liquidación de su importe, puede y\r\ndebe ser hecha por la nación, sin menoscabo de sus derechos primordiales\r\ncomo entidad soberana; pero el cobro compulsivo e inmediato en un\r\nmomento dado, por medio de la fuerza, no traería otra cosa que la ruina\r\nde las naciones más débiles y la absorción de su gobierno con todas las\r\nfacultades que le son inherentes por los fuertes de la tierra. Otros son\r\nlos principios[636] proclamados en este continente de América. \"Los\r\ncontratos entre una nación y los individuos particulares son\r\nobligatorios según la conciencia del soberano, y no pueden ser objeto de\r\nfuerza compulsiva\", decía el ilustre Hamilton. \"No confieren\r\nderecho[637] alguno de acción fuera de la voluntad soberana.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUIS M. DRAGO\r\n\r\n_Blasco Ibáñez, Argentina y sus grandezas_]\r\n\r\nLos Estados Unidos han ido muy lejos en ese sentido. La enmienda\r\nundécima de su constitución estableció, en efecto, con el asentimiento\r\nunánime del pueblo, que el poder judicial de la nación no se extiende a\r\nningún pleito de ley o de equidad seguido contra uno de los Estados\r\nUnidos por ciudadanos de otro Estado, o por ciudadanos o súbditos de un\r\nEstado extranjero. La República Argentina ha hecho demandables a sus\r\nprovincias y aun ha consagrado el principio de que la nación misma pueda\r\nser llevada a juicio ante la Suprema[638] Corte por los contratos que\r\ncelebra con los particulares.\r\n\r\nLo que no ha establecido, lo que no podría de ninguna manera admitir, es\r\nque, una vez determinado por sentencia el monto de lo que pudiera\r\nadeudar, se le prive[639] de la de elegir[640] el modo y la oportunidad\r\ndel pago, en el que tiene tanto o más interés que el acreedor mismo,\r\nporque en ello están comprometidos el crédito y el honor colectivos.\r\n\r\nNo es ésta de ninguna manera la defensa de la mala fe, del desorden y de\r\nla insolvencia deliberada y voluntaria. Es simplemente amparar el decoro\r\nde la entidad pública internacional que no puede ser arrastrada así a la\r\nguerra, con perjuicio de los altos fines que determinan la existencia y\r\nla libertad de las naciones.\r\n\r\nEl reconocimiento de la deuda pública, la obligación definida de pagarla\r\nno es, por otra parte, una declaración sin valor porque el cobro[641] no\r\npueda llevarse a la práctica por el medio de la violencia.\r\n\r\nEl Estado persiste en su capacidad de tal, y[642] más tarde o más\r\ntemprano las situaciones obscuras se resuelven, crecen los recursos, las\r\naspiraciones comunes de equidad y de justicia prevalecen y se satisfacen\r\nlos más retardados compromisos.\r\n\r\nEl fallo, entonces, que declara la obligación de pagar la deuda, ya sea\r\ndictado por los tribunales del país o por los de arbitraje\r\ninternacional, los cuales expresan el anhelo permanente de la justicia\r\ncomo fundamento de las relaciones políticas de los pueblos, constituye\r\nun título indiscutible que no puede compararse al derecho incierto\r\nde[643] aquél cuyos créditos no son reconocidos y se ve impulsado a\r\napelar a la acción para que ellos le sean satisfechos.\r\n\r\nSiendo estos sentimientos de justicia, de lealtad y de honor, los que\r\naniman al pueblo argentino, y han inspirado en todo tiempo su política,\r\nV. E. comprenderá que se haya sentido alarmado al saber que la falta de\r\npago de los servicios de la deuda pública de Venezuela se indica como\r\nuna de las causas determinantes del apresamiento de su flota, del\r\nbombardeo de uno de sus puertos y del bloqueo de guerra rigurosamente\r\nestablecido para sus costas. Si estos procedimientos fueran\r\ndefinitivamente adoptados, establecerían un precedente peligroso para la\r\nseguridad y la paz de las naciones de esta parte de América.\r\n\r\nEl cobro militar de los empréstitos supone ocupación territorial para\r\nhacerlo efectivo, y la ocupación territorial significa la supresión o\r\nsubordinación de los gobiernos locales en los países a que se extiende.\r\n\r\nTal situación aparece contrariando visiblemente[644] los principios\r\nmuchas veces proclamados por las naciones de América y muy\r\nparticularmente la doctrina Monroe, con tanto celo sostenida y defendida\r\nen todo tiempo por los Estados Unidos, doctrina a que la República\r\nArgentina ha adherido antes de ahora.[645]\r\n\r\nDentro de los principios que enuncia el memorable[646] mensaje de 2 de\r\ndiciembre de 1823, se contienen dos grandes declaraciones que\r\nparticularmente se refieren a estas repúblicas, a saber: \"Los\r\ncontinentes americanos no podrán en adelante servir de campo para la\r\ncolonización futura de las naciones europeas, y reconocida como lo ha\r\nsido la independencia de los gobiernos de América, no podrá mirarse la\r\ninterposición de parte de ningún poder europeo, con el propósito de\r\noprimirlos o controlarlos de cualquier manera, sino como la\r\nmanifestación de sentimientos poco amigables para los Estados Unidos.\"\r\n\r\nLa abstención de nuevos dominios coloniales en los territorios de este\r\ncontinente, ha sido muchas veces aceptado por los hombres políticos de\r\nInglaterra. A su simpatía puede decirse que se debió el gran éxito que\r\nla doctrina de Monroe alcanzó apenas promulgada. Pero en los últimos\r\ntiempos se ha observado una tendencia marcada en los publicistas y en\r\nlas manifestaciones diversas de la opinión europea, que señalan estos\r\npaíses como campo adecuado para las futuras expansiones territoriales.\r\nPensadores de la más alta jerarquía han indicado la conveniencia de\r\norientar en esta dirección los grandes esfuerzos que las principales\r\npotencias de Europa han aplicado a la conquista de regiones estériles,\r\ncon un clima inclemente, en las más apartadas latitudes del mundo. Son\r\nmuchos ya los escritores europeos que designan los territorios de Sud\r\nAmérica con sus grandes riquezas, con su cielo feliz y su clima propicio\r\npara todas las producciones, como el teatro obligado donde las grandes\r\npotencias, que tienen ya preparadas las armas y los instrumentos de la\r\nconquista, han de disputarse el predominio en el curso de este siglo.\r\n\r\nLa tendencia humana expansiva, caldeada así por las sugestiones de la\r\nopinión y de la prensa, puede, en cualquier momento, tomar una dirección\r\nagresiva, aun contra la voluntad de las actuales clases gobernantes. Y\r\nno se negará que el camino más sencillo para las apropiaciones y la\r\nfácil suplantación de las autoridades locales por los gobiernos\r\neuropeos, es precisamente el de las intervenciones financieras, como con\r\nmuchos ejemplos pudiera demostrarse. No pretendemos de ninguna manera\r\nque las naciones sudamericanas queden, por ningún concepto, exentas de\r\nlas responsabilidades de todo orden que las violaciones del derecho\r\ninternacional comportan para los pueblos civilizados. No pretendemos, ni\r\npodemos pretender que estos países ocupen una situación excepcional en\r\nsus relaciones con las potencias europeas, que tienen el derecho\r\nindudable de proteger a sus súbditos tan ampliamente como en cualquier\r\notra parte del globo, contra las persecuciones o las injusticias de que\r\npudieran ser víctimas. Lo único que la República Argentina sostiene y lo\r\nque vería con gran satisfacción consagrado con motivo de los sucesos de\r\nVenezuela, por una nación que, como los Estados Unidos, goza de tan\r\ngrande autoridad y poderío, es el principio ya aceptado de que no puede\r\nhaber expansión territorial europea en América, ni opresión de los\r\npueblos de este continente, porque una desgraciada condición financiera\r\npudiese llevar a alguno de ellos a diferir el cumplimiento de sus\r\ncompromisos. En una palabra, el principio que quisiera ver reconocido,\r\nes el de que la deuda pública no puede dar lugar a la intervención\r\narmada, ni menos a la ocupación material del suelo de las naciones\r\namericanas por una potencia europea.\r\n\r\nEl prestigio y el descrédito de los Estados que dejan de satisfacer los\r\nderechos de sus legítimos acreedores, trae consigo dificultades de tal\r\nmagnitud que no hay necesidad de que la intervención extranjera agrave\r\ncon la opresión las calamidades transitorias de la insolvencia.\r\n\r\nLa República Argentina podría citar su propio ejemplo, para demostrar lo\r\ninnecesario de las intervenciones armadas en estos casos.\r\n\r\nEl servicio de la deuda inglesa de 1824 fué reasumido espontáneamente\r\npor ella, después de una interrupción de treinta años, ocasionada por la\r\nanarquía y las convulsiones que conmovieron[647] profundamente el país\r\nen ese período de tiempo, y se pagaron escrupulosamente todos los\r\natrasos y todos los intereses, sin que los acreedores hicieran gestión\r\nalguna para ello.\r\n\r\nMás tarde una serie de acontecimientos y contrastes[648] financieros,\r\ncompletamente fuera de todo control de sus hombres gobernantes, la\r\npusieron, por un momento, en situación de suspender de nuevo\r\ntemporalmente el servicio de la deuda externa. Tuvo, empero, el\r\npropósito firme y. decidido de reasumir los pagos inmediatamente que las\r\ncircunstancias se lo permitieran y así lo hizo, en efecto, algún tiempo\r\ndespués, a costa de grandes sacrificios, por su propia y espontánea\r\nvoluntad y sin intervención ni conminaciones de ninguna potencia\r\nextranjera. Y ha sido por sus procedimientos perfectamente escrupulosos,\r\nregulares y honestos, por su alto sentimiento de equidad y de justicia\r\nplenamente evidenciado, que las dificultades sufridas en vez de\r\ndisminuir han acrecentado su crédito en los mercados europeos. Puede\r\nafirmarse con entera certidumbre que tan halagador resultado no se\r\nhabría obtenido, si los acreedores hubieran creído conveniente\r\nintervenir de un modo violento en el período de crisis de las finanzas,\r\nque así se ha repuesto por su sola virtud.\r\n\r\nNo tememos ni podemos temer que se repitan circunstancias semejantes.\r\n\r\nEn el momento presente no nos mueve, pues, ningún sentimiento egoísta ni\r\nbuscamos el propio provecho al manifestar nuestro deseo de que la deuda\r\nde los Estados no sirva de motivo para una agresión militar de estos\r\npaíses.\r\n\r\nNo abrigamos, tampoco, respecto de las naciones europeas ningún\r\nsentimiento de hostilidad. Antes por el contrario, mantenemos con todas\r\nellas las más cordiales relaciones desde nuestra emancipación, muy\r\nparticularmente con Inglaterra, a la cual hemos dado recientemente la\r\nmayor prueba de la confianza que nos inspiran su justicia y su\r\necuanimidad, entregando a su fallo la más importante[649] de nuestras\r\ncuestiones internacionales que ella acaba de resolver fijando nuestros\r\nlímites con Chile después de una controversia de más de sesenta años.\r\n\r\nSabemos que donde la Inglaterra va, la acompaña la civilización y se\r\nextienden los beneficios de la libertad política y civil. Por eso la\r\nestimamos, lo que no quiere decir que adhiriéramos con igual simpatía a\r\nsu política en el caso improbable de que ella tendiera a oprimir las\r\nnacionalidades de este continente, que luchan por su progreso, que ya\r\nhan vencido las dificultades mayores y triunfarán en definitiva para\r\nhonor de las instituciones democráticas.\r\n\r\nLargo es, quizás, el camino que todavía deberán recorrer las naciones\r\nsudamericanas. Pero tienen fe bastante y la suficiente energía y virtud\r\npara llegar a su desenvolvimiento pleno, apoyándose las unas en las\r\notras.\r\n\r\nY es por ese sentimiento de confraternidad continental y por la fuerza\r\nque siempre deriva del apoyo moral de todo un pueblo, que me dirijo al\r\nseñor ministro, cumpliendo instrucciones del[650] excelentísimo señor\r\npresidente de la República, para que transmita al gobierno de los\r\nEstados[651] Unidos nuestra manera de considerar los sucesos en cuyo\r\ndesenvolvimiento ulterior va a tomar una parte tan importante, a fin de\r\nque se sirva tenerla[652] como la expresión sincera de los sentimientos\r\nde una nación que tiene fe en su destino y la tiene en los de todo este\r\ncontinente, a cuya cabeza marchan los Estados Unidos, actualizando\r\nideales y suministrando ejemplos.\r\n\r\nQuiera el señor ministro aceptar[653] las seguridades de mi\r\nconsideración distinguida.\r\n\r\nLUIS M.

The subject is =Marte= in line 2.\r\n\r\n[4] =Inca=. When the Spanish _Conquistadores_ came to America, all of\r\nPeru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and north-western Argentina were inhabited by\r\nthe Quichua Indians. These Indians were divided into seven tribes, from\r\none of which came the Incas who became the rulers of the vast territory\r\noccupied by the Quichuas. The Inca was the head of the ruling class\r\nand consequently the emperor of all the Quichuas. The reference here\r\nis to Atahualpa, the last Inca, who was strangled in 1533 by order of\r\nPizarro, conqueror of Peru.\r\n\r\n[5] =sus=, _i.e._, _del Inca_.\r\n\r\n[6] =lo que=, trans., _as: As he sees his sons renewing the old\r\nsplendor of the Fatherland_. Vide Bello-Cuervo, _Gramática_, §§ 976,\r\n977; and Cuervo, _Apuntaciones críticas_, § 337.\r\n\r\n[7] =se sienten=, _are heard_. The student should exercise special\r\ncare in noting the difference between the use of the reflexive as a\r\nsubstitute for the passive voice and the true use of the reflexive; the\r\nfirst use is confined almost entirely to the third person, singular and\r\nplural.\r\n\r\n[8] =Méjico=. From 1810 to 1820 the Mexicans fought bravely, but with\r\nscant success, to free themselves from the Spanish yoke. During that\r\nperiod three great leaders of Mexican independence were captured\r\nand shot by the Spaniards: the priest Miguel Hidalgo, in 1811; the\r\npriest Morelos, in 1815; and Francisco Xavier Mina, in 1817. Under the\r\nleadership of Santa Ana, in 1823, the Mexicans were finally successful\r\nin driving out the Spaniards and establishing a republican form of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n[9] =Quito=. Until the beginning of the sixteenth century the present\r\nrepublic of Ecuador was the kingdom of Quito, ruled over by the Incas.\r\nAfter Pizarro's conquest in 1533 it became the _Audiencia_ of Quito,\r\nsubject to the rule of the Viceroy of Peru. Ecuador was the last South\r\nAmerican country to obtain its independence from Spain. From 1810 to\r\n1822, when the Spaniards were defeated at the battle of Pichincha, it\r\nwas the scene of much ruthless and fierce fighting.\r\n\r\n[10] =cuál=, trans., _how_.\r\n\r\n[11] =Potosí=, =Cochabama=, =la Paz=, cities in Bolivia. Most of the\r\nfighting against the Spaniards in Bolivia took place in the triangle\r\nformed by those three cities. V. map.\r\n\r\n[12] =Caracas=, capital of Venezuela, the first South American country\r\nto declare its independence from Spain, in 1811. About that time the\r\nterrors of an earthquake, which destroyed the greater part of the city,\r\nwere added to those of war.\r\n\r\n[13] =cual=, trans., _like_.\r\n\r\n[14] =a=, trans., _against_.\r\n\r\n[15] =vencedor=, trans., _as a conqueror_; note absolute construction.\r\n\r\n[16] =San José=, =Piedras=, =La Colonia=, battles fought by the\r\nUruguayans in coöperation with the Argentineans. At Las Piedras there\r\nwere two engagements, hence =ambas Piedras=.\r\n\r\n=San Lorenzo=, name of the first battle fought by San Martín against\r\nthe Spaniards.\r\n\r\n=Suipacha=, =Salta=, =Tucumán=. General Balcarce defeated the Spaniards\r\nat Suipacha, as did General Belgrano at the battles of Salta and\r\nTucumán.\r\n\r\n[17] =la Banda Oriental=, popular name for the republic of Uruguay.\r\nUntil the period of the Revolution, Uruguay was one of the Provinces\r\nof the Plata, and from its location on the eastern bank of the Uruguay\r\nRiver it received the name of \"Eastern District.\"\r\n\r\n[18] =su=, _i.e._, =del guerrero argentino=.\r\n\r\n[19] =sus=, _i.e._, =del tirano=.\r\n\r\n[20] =por=, trans., _as_.\r\n\r\n[21] =su=, _i.e._, =de la libertad=.\r\n\r\n[22] =les=, _i.e._, =a los hombres=.\r\n\r\n[23] =trono dignísimo=, _i.e._, independence from Spain.\r\n\r\n[24] =¡..., salud!= _hail!_\r\n\r\n[25] =para responder al título de la propiedad=, _to insure claim to\r\nthe property_.\r\n\r\n[26] =sequedades=, abstract noun used as a concrete noun; trans.,\r\n_sterile lands_.\r\n\r\n[27] =absoluto=, taken in its literal sense here, _apart_, _by himself_.\r\n\r\n[28] =_volteadas_=, Argentinism; separation and selection of cattle\r\nwithout previously rounding them up; hasty selection of cattle. Cf.\r\nDarwin's _The Voyage of the Beagle_: \"About two leagues beyond this\r\ncurious tree we halted for the night; at this instant an unfortunate\r\ncow was spied by the lynx-eyed gauchos, who set off in full chase, and\r\nin a few minutes dragged her in with their lazos, and slaughtered her.\"\r\n\r\n[29] =leyes positivas=, _established laws_.\r\n\r\n[30] =con sendas o vados=, etc., _i.e._, =cerca de su choza=, _nearby_.\r\n\r\n[31] =género de vida que hacían=, _kind of life they led_.\r\n\r\n[32] =lo hacían... tiempo=, _gave him an air of mystery and dignity at\r\nthe same time_.\r\n\r\n[33] =voz cubierta=, _soft voice_.\r\n\r\n[34] =con el monosílabo=, _by a monosyllabic remark_.\r\n\r\n[35] =introdujo una revolución social=, _i.e._, the internal revolution\r\nthat followed immediately upon the heels of the struggle for\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n[36] =por esto=, _on this account_.\r\n\r\n[37] =vecindarios=. This word means both _district_ or _ward of a\r\ntown_, and _vicinity_; hence the statement that follows.\r\n\r\n[38] =si es que=, _i.e._, =si es verdad que=.\r\n\r\n[39] =a la altura... se nutren=, _on a par with the social milieu in\r\nwhich they are born and grow_.\r\n\r\n[40] =Eso sí=, _Of course_, _Most assuredly_.\r\n\r\n[41] =Tomaba partido... y por pasión=, _He took sides, guided by his\r\npersonal sentiments and emotions_.\r\n\r\n[42] =a su modo=, _peculiar to himself_.\r\n\r\n[43] =por escapar=, lit., _for the sake of escaping_; translate as\r\nif it were =para escapar=. There is very little difference between\r\n=por= and =para= when followed by an infinitive: =para= is by far the\r\ncommoner preposition used.\r\n\r\n[44] =San Martín=, =Belgrano=, the two greatest military leaders of\r\nArgentina during the period of the struggle for independence.\r\n\r\n[45] =cuerpo de doctrina=, _system of dogmas_.\r\n\r\n[46] _=sui generis=_, Latin for =a su modo=. V. note 18, 10.\r\n\r\n[47] =de que no se daba otra cuenta... superior=, lit., _of which he\r\ngave himself no other account save as of a superior fact_, i.e., _of\r\nwhich he knew nothing save that it was a divine fact_.\r\n\r\n[48] =le venía impuesto=, _was imposed upon him_. =Venir= is here used\r\nas an auxiliary for the passive voice instead of =ser=.\r\n\r\n[49] =doctrina=. Notice the use of a general term for a concrete term.\r\nWhat is meant here by =doctrina= is not _teaching_ but _teachers_.\r\n\r\n[50] MOTTO. _The steppes, like the ocean, fill the soul with the\r\nfeeling of the infinite._ Taken from Humboldt's _Voyages aux régions\r\néquinoxiales du nouveau continent._\r\n\r\n[51] =no puede... negarse=, _it cannot be denied_. Cf. 2, 9.\r\n\r\n[52] =lucha imponente=. The indefinite article is regularly omitted in\r\nSpanish with nouns in apposition.\r\n\r\n[53] =están combatiendo=. The first edition of Sarmiento's _Facundo_,\r\nthe work from which this extract is taken, appeared in 1845; hence the\r\nuse of the present.\r\n\r\n[54] =Echeverría=, one of Argentina's foremost poets.\r\n\r\n[55] _=La Cautiva=_, name of the poem for which Echeverría is best\r\nknown. It marks a departure from Spanish classical traditions,\r\ndepicting a struggle typical of the pampas, its scenery, its\r\ninhabitants, and its poetry.\r\n\r\n[56] =Dido= and =Argía=, the titular heroines of dramas by Juan Cruz\r\nVarela, the foremost Argentine poet of the classical school; the\r\nfirst is based on the fourth book of Virgil's _Æneid_; the second on\r\nAlfieri's _Antigone_.\r\n\r\n[57] =proporciona=. The subject is =el espectáculo=.\r\n\r\n[58] =a ellos=. The use of the prepositional object pronoun adds\r\nemphasis to the sentence.\r\n\r\n[59] =Ojo de Halcón=, _Hawkeye_, character in Cooper's _The Last of the\r\nMohicans_.\r\n\r\n[60] =Mingos=, epithet applied to the Huron Indians in Cooper's\r\n_Leatherstocking Tales_.\r\n\r\n[61] \"=van a tapar el arroyo=,\" \"_they are going to dam the brook_.\"\r\nCf. Chapter XXI of _The Last of the Mohicans_.\r\n\r\n[62] _=La Pradera=_, Cooper's novel, _The Prairie_.\r\n\r\n[63] =el Trampero=, _the Trapper_; known also in the other works of\r\nCooper's _Leatherstocking Tales_ as Deerslayer, Hawkeye, Pathfinder,\r\nSettler.\r\n\r\n[64] =lo mismo que el Trampero sugiere=. Cf. _The Prairie_, Chapter\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\n[65] =los incendios del pasto=. The dangers from such fires will be\r\nevident when it is known that not infrequently grass grows so tall in\r\nthe pampas as to cover a man on horseback.\r\n\r\n[66] =la misteriosa operación del Pawnie=. Cf. _The Prairie_, Chapter\r\nXXIV. The Pawnie is an Indian character in _The Prairie_, friend of the\r\nTrapper.\r\n\r\n[67] A cowhide, fashioned so as to give it buoyancy, is often used in\r\nthe pampas to cross streams. An improvised craft of this type is called\r\na =pelota=, _i.e._, _ball_. Though the =pelota= is often mentioned and\r\ndescribed by Argentine travelers and explorers, nowhere other than in\r\nthis passage of Sarmiento have the editors read that they were towed by\r\nwomen. Cf. _The Prairie_, Chapter XXIV.\r\n\r\n[68] =con la pelota... lazo=, _with the pelota towed by means of a rope\r\nseized between the teeth_.\r\n\r\n[69] =El procedimiento para asar una cabeza de búfalo=. For reference\r\nV. _The Prairie_, Chapter IX. Sarmiento has evidently made a mistake\r\nhere, meaning not the head but the hump of a buffalo.\r\n\r\n[70] =En fin,...= In his _Voyage of the Beagle_, Chapter III, Darwin,\r\nwriting almost contemporaneously of conditions on the pampas, says: \"It\r\nis curious how similar circumstances produce such similar results in\r\nmanners. At the Cape of Good Hope the same hospitality, and very nearly\r\nthe same points of etiquette, are universally observed.\"\r\n\r\n[71] =acaba=. The verb is in the singular because =lo palpable y\r\nvulgar= are taken to be one and the same thing.\r\n\r\n[72] =se aleja=. The subject of this verb and the following verbs of\r\nthe sentence is =horizonte=.\r\n\r\n[73] =despierto=, with concessive force, _though awake_.\r\n\r\n[74] =es poeta=, _is poetical_. Notice the use of a noun with the force\r\nof an adjective.\r\n\r\n[75] =y cómo ha de dejar de serlo=, _and how can it help being so_.\r\n=Lo= refers to the previous statement, =es poeta=.\r\n\r\n[76] =mientras se cruzan dos palabras=, _in the twinkling of an eye_.\r\n\r\n[77] =atraerse=. The reflexive is here the indirect object of the verb.\r\n\r\n[78] =Masas de tinieblas..., masas de luz lívida=, in loose apposition\r\nwith colores of the preceding sentence.\r\n\r\n[79] =y muestra... poder=, _and shows the limitless stretches of the\r\npampa as they are vividly pierced by the lightning, the symbol of\r\npower_.\r\n\r\n[80] =Añádase=, _Let it be added_.\r\n\r\n[81] =una atmósfera cargada de electricidad=. \"On a second night we\r\nwitnessed a splendid scene of natural fireworks; the masthead and yard\r\narm ends shone with St. Elmo's light; and the form of the vane could\r\nalmost be traced, as if it had been rubbed with phosphorus. The sea\r\nwas so highly luminous that the tracks of the penguins were marked by\r\na fiery wake, and the darkness of the sky was momentarily illuminated\r\nby the most vivid lightning.\"--DARWIN, _The Voyage of the Beagle_,\r\ndescribing the entrance to the estuary of the Plata.\r\n\r\n[82] =como el pelo contrariado del gato=, _like a cat's hair when\r\nstroked the wrong way_.\r\n\r\n[83] =la vista=, subject of the verbs =gira=, =reconcentra=,\r\n=encuentra=, in the preceding lines.\r\n\r\n[84] =Paraná= and =Uruguay= (next line). Two rivers. V. map.\r\n\r\n[85] =arrojan=. Strictly speaking, the subject is =ceibos y palmas=,\r\nthough the meaning is clearly that _all_ the trees overhanging the\r\nbanks, _i.e._, the aromo and the orange tree, shower their flowers.\r\n\r\n[86] =flor del aire=, _flower of the air_; popular name for a\r\nplant of the genus Tillandsia, very common in Argentina. There are\r\nmany varieties, with flowers of different colors. The striking\r\ncharacteristic of this plant is that it will grow without having its\r\nroots in the ground, getting its sustenance from the air when tied to\r\nor suspended from anything.\r\n\r\n[87] =Guazú=, one of the rivers of the Paraná delta.\r\n\r\n[88] =es un canto frigio=. The well-known archeologist, Sir William\r\nMitchell Ramsay, in his article on Phrygia in the _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_ says: \"The scenery is generally monotonous; even the\r\nmountainous districts rarely show striking features or boldness of\r\ncharacter; where the landscape has beauty it is of a subdued melancholy\r\ncharacter. The circumstances of the country are well calculated to\r\nimpress the inhabitants with a sense of the overwhelming power of\r\nnature and of their complete dependence on it. Their mythology, so far\r\nas we know it, has a melancholy and mystic tone, and their religion\r\npartakes of the same character.\"\r\n\r\n[89] =Rousseau= (Jean Jacques), the celebrated French philosopher of\r\nthe eighteenth century (1712-1778), in his youth wrote a _Dissertation\r\non Modern Music_, in which he attempted to introduce a new system of\r\nmusical notation.\r\n\r\n[90] =Copiapó=, city in Chile. V. map.\r\n\r\n[91] =no lo han de haber adoptado=, _cannot have adopted it_.\r\n\r\n[92] =y lo populariza... exige=, _and popularizes it by the audiences\r\nwhich his song gathers_.\r\n\r\n[93] =andaluz genuino=. Most of the Spanish colonizers of Argentina\r\nwere Andalusians. To this day their influence is noticeable in the\r\npronunciation of Spanish throughout South America. The most striking\r\ndifference in the pronunciation of the Castilians and that of the\r\nAndalusians is that the latter pronounce the =z=, and the =c= when\r\nfollowed by =e= or =i=, like an =s=. The Andalusians do not make the\r\n=s= as sibilant as the Castilians; with them it is very often a light\r\naspirate sound.\r\n\r\n[94] =algunos= refers to =especialidades= in the preceding sentence. It\r\nis made masculine because the word is used to denote males, _i.e._, the\r\n=tipos= and =caracteres= which are described in detail later on.\r\n\r\n[95] =guerra civil=. The revolutionary struggle between Buenos Aires\r\nand the provinces of the interior, which broke out close upon the heels\r\nof Argentine independence, is referred to here. V. Introduction.\r\n\r\n[96] =es de muy buena silla=, _she is a very good mount_.\r\n\r\n[97] =ha pasado ayer=. A Spaniard would say here =pasó ayer=. This use\r\nof the perfect instead of the preterite is a common Gallicism in South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n[98] =sierra de San Luis=, in the province of San Luis. V. map.\r\n\r\n[99] =fallarle=, _pass sentence against him_. =Le= is dative of\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\n[100] =que=, object of =considera=.\r\n\r\n[101] =si le sucedía momentáneamente extraviarse=, _if he happened to\r\nlose the track for a moment_.\r\n\r\n[102] \"=¡Dónde te _mi-as-dir_!=\" stands for \"=¡Dónde te me has de ir!=\"\r\n_Where do you think you will get away from me?_\r\n\r\n[103] =unas hierbas=, _some blades of grass_.\r\n\r\n[104] =_baquiano_=, also spelled =baqueano=. This adjective is derived\r\nfrom the verb =vaquear=, which in Argentina means to round up cattle.\r\nIn the course of their work, the =baquianos=, or cattlemen, acquired an\r\nintimate knowledge of the country, and it was only natural, therefore,\r\nthat the pathfinders, the sense in which the word is used here, should\r\ncome from their midst. To-day it is also used to denote a person who is\r\nan expert in anything.\r\n\r\n[105] =Imaginaos=. The final =d= of the second person plural imperative\r\nis dropped in reflexive verbs.\r\n\r\n[106] =el camino que lleva=, _the road he is following_.\r\n\r\n[107] =si no los hay=, _if there aren't any_.\r\n\r\n[108] =el camino ha de ir al Sur=, _the road must be to the south_.\r\n\r\n[109] =lago o arroyo de agua salada o dulce=. Salt streams and lakes\r\nare common in Argentina, particularly in the central provinces. \"One\r\nday I rode to a large salt lake, or salina, which is distant fifteen\r\nmiles from the town. During the winter it consists of a shallow lake of\r\nbrine, which in summer is converted into a field of snow-white salt....\r\nOne of these brilliantly white and level expanses, in the midst of the\r\nbrown and desolate plain, offers an extraordinary spectacle.\"--DARWIN,\r\n_The Voyage of the Beagle_.\r\n\r\n[110] =El general Rosas=. V. Introduction.\r\n\r\n[111] =lo=. Cf. 29, 2.\r\n\r\n[112] =Cuando se aproxima=. The subject is =el enemigo=.\r\n\r\n[113] =observa los polvos=, _observes the clouds of dust_.\r\n\r\n[114] =el jefe obra bajo este dato=, _the chief makes his plans in\r\naccordance with this information_.\r\n\r\n[115] =las aciertan=, _succeed in them_.\r\n\r\n[116] =Creeráse=. The object pronoun is placed after the verb for\r\nstylistic effect. The student should avoid this use.\r\n\r\n[117] =El general Rivera=. José Fructuoso Rivera (1790-1854), famous\r\ngaucho leader of the revolutionary movement in Uruguay. He was twice\r\nelected to the presidency of his country.

Introduction.\r\n\r\n[120] =Lavalleja= (Juan Antonio), leader of the liberating expedition\r\nof the \"Thirty-three\".\r\n\r\n[121] =con toda su ciencia=. The possessive adjective =su= refers to\r\n=Ojo de Halcón= and =el Trampero=, which are different names for the\r\nhero in Cooper's _Leatherstocking Tales_.\r\n\r\n[122] =La justicia=, _i.e._, its emissaries, the police.\r\n\r\n[123] =enlaza una vaca=.... This is hardly so to-day, save perhaps\r\noccasionally in the depths of the pampas. But in the days of Sarmiento\r\nit was far from being an uncommon event. Cf. 9, 22.\r\n\r\n[124] =se provee _de los vicios_=. He supplies himself with tobacco\r\nand _mate_. In the simple life of the gaucho, tobacco and _mate_ are\r\nluxuries, vices (!).\r\n\r\n[125] =entra en baile con su pareja, confúndese en las mudanzas del\r\n_cielito_=, _joins in the dance with his partner, mingles with the\r\nothers in the steps of the =cielito=_.\r\n\r\n[126] =su morada sin limites=, _i.e._, =los cardales=, the thistle\r\nfields of the pampa.\r\n\r\n[127] =en la provincia=, _i.e._, in whichever province the =gaucho\r\nmalo= may be living, or better, roving.\r\n\r\n[128] =Si no se le pide=, _If he is not asked_.\r\n\r\n[129] =a menos que él lo solicite=. =Él= refers to =alguno=; =lo=,\r\nto =acercársele=; trans., _unless the traveler wishes the gaucho to\r\napproach him_.\r\n\r\n[130] =valiente Rauch=, popular hero and gaucho leader; comparable to\r\nCuster in American history.\r\n\r\n[131] =catástrofe de Facundo=. Reference to the assassination of this\r\nrival of Rosas. He was murdered by the outlaw gaucho Santos Pérez\r\nat the instigation of Rosas. His death was a favorite theme of the\r\n=cantores=.\r\n\r\n[132] =el infeliz=, a term of mild contempt, _the poor fellow_.\r\n\r\n[133] =de lo que tiene sobre su cabeza=, _i.e._, the cultured city\r\nelement.\r\n\r\n[134] =de lo que tiene a los pies=, _i.e._, the semicivilized gaucho\r\nelement of the country.\r\n\r\n[135] =Dondequiera que=, _Wherever_.\r\n\r\n[136] No es fuera de propósito recordar aquí las semejanzas notables\r\nque presentan los argentinos con los árabes. En Argel, en Orán, en\r\nMáscara y en los aduares del desierto, ví siempre a los árabes reunidos\r\nen cafés, por estarles prohibido el uso de los licores, apiñados en\r\nderredor del cantor, generalmente dos que se acompañan de la vihuela a\r\nduo, recitando canciones nacionales plañideras como nuestros tristes.\r\nLa rienda de los árabes es tejida de cuero y con azotera, como las\r\nnuestras; el freno de que usamos es el freno árabe, y muchas de\r\nnuestras costumbres revelan el contacto de nuestros padres con los\r\nmoros de la Andalucía. De las fisonomías no se hable: algunos árabes he\r\nconocido que jurara haberlos visto en mi país.--EL AUTOR.\r\n\r\n(=Orán=, port in Algeria.\r\n\r\n=Máscara=, town in Algeria, to the southeast of Orán.\r\n\r\n=azotera=. In Argentina reins are often made long enough so that the\r\nends may be used as a whip; these constitute the =azotera=.\r\n\r\n=no se hable=, _let us not speak_.)\r\n\r\n[137] =con ser=, _though being_.\r\n\r\n[138] =no está libre de=..., _is not free from having some accounts to\r\nsettle with the police_.\r\n\r\n[139] =lo del rapto=, _the story of the abduction_.\r\n\r\n[140] =el poncho=. The poncho used by the gauchos is a thick woolen\r\nblanket of oblong shape, with a slit in the center so that it may fall\r\nover the wearer's shoulders. It is an inseparable accouterment of the\r\ngaucho. It is his winter coat, his raincoat, and his shield to boot,\r\nfor in his dueling, to which he is much given, the gaucho fights with\r\nthe knife in one hand and the poncho wrapped around the other hand and\r\narm.\r\n\r\n[141] =se veía salir=, _there was seen emerging_.\r\n\r\n[142] =tomado de la cola=, _clinging to the tail_.\r\n\r\n[143] =la sangrienta lucha=, _i.e._, the struggle between the\r\nunitarians and federalists.

Translate as if it were =y que en éstos=.\r\n\r\n[148] =a su tiempo=, _at the proper time_.\r\n\r\n[149] =ocupa=. The subject is =labrador=.\r\n\r\n[150] =lo variado=, _the variety_.\r\n\r\n[151] =Todo lo contrario=, _Just the opposite_.\r\n\r\n[152] =Los límites de la propiedad no están marcados=. Later on, when\r\nSarmiento became president, he introduced wire fences to indicate the\r\nboundary lines of the _estancias_.\r\n\r\n[153] =aunque no sepan qué hacerse=, _though they may not know what to\r\ndo with themselves_.\r\n\r\n[154] =la corbata=. To a gaucho the cravat is the mark of the city man.\r\n\r\n[155] =El año 41=, _i.e._, 1841.\r\n\r\n[156] =¡Cómo me ha de ir!= _How do you suppose!_\r\n\r\n[157] =estas dos frases=, _i.e._, =¡En Chile! ¡y a pie!= _In a foreign\r\nland! and on foot!_ Chile, moreover, being a mountainous country, ill\r\nsuits the gaucho accustomed as he is to the plains of Argentina. Being\r\nhorseless is of course always a calamity for a gaucho, whether in the\r\npampa or far from it.\r\n\r\n[158] =se dan=. V. 2, 9.\r\n\r\n[159] =dónde se le han visto rastros al león=, _where the tracks of the\r\nlion_ (_puma_) _have been seen_.\r\n\r\n[160] =se fraterniza=, lit., _it is fraternized_; trans., _there\r\ndrinking and the prodigality of those with means induce comradeship_.\r\n\r\n[161] =empiezan a echarse=, _begin to be laid_.\r\n\r\n[162] =la Península=, _i.e._, Spain.\r\n\r\n[163] =¡guerra a cuchillo!= _war to the knife!_ The Spanish general,\r\nJosé Palafox Melfi, defender of the city of Zaragoza against the\r\nbesieging troops of Napoleon (1808-1809), being asked by the French\r\ngeneral to surrender, answered with the famous words above mentioned.\r\nFor this heroic defense of Zaragoza he was made Duke of Zaragoza.\r\n\r\n[164] =a más de un arma=, _besides being a weapon_.\r\n\r\n[165] =a la par de jinete=. After the words =a la par= the words =de\r\nhacer alarde= are understood and =ser= is understood before =jinete=\r\nand =valiente=.\r\n\r\n[166] =una esgrima=, _a form of dueling_.\r\n\r\n[167] =Así se ve a estos gauchos=, _thus these gauchos are seen_.\r\n\r\n[168] =por brillar=.

Darwin, speaking of the\r\nhorsemanship of the gaucho, says: \"General Rosas is also a perfect\r\nhorseman--an accomplishment of no small consequence in a country where\r\nan assembled army elected its general by the following trial: a troop\r\nof unbroken horses, being driven into a corral, were let out through a\r\ngateway, above which was a crossbar; it was agreed that whoever should\r\ndrop from the bar on one of these wild animals, as it rushed out, and\r\nshould be able, without saddle or bridle, not only to ride it, but also\r\nto bring it back to the door of the corral, should be their general.\r\nThe person who succeeded was accordingly elected; and doubtless made\r\na fit general for such an army. This extraordinary feat has also been\r\nperformed by Rosas.\"\r\n\r\n[172] =Uno le arroja un tiro de bolas=, _Some one takes a shot at him\r\nwith the bolas_. The _bolas_ used by the gauchos to catch cattle and\r\ngame are of two kinds; they may consist of two round stones covered\r\nwith leather and united by a leather thong about seven or eight feet\r\nlong; or they may consist of three balls united to a common center.\r\nThe balls differ in size and weight, depending on the kind of game the\r\ngauchos wish to catch. They are twirled around the head and hurled\r\nat the feet of the fleeing animal. Light bolas of the first kind are\r\ncalled =lives=. Cf. 82, 12.\r\n\r\n[173] =vese salir al jinete corriendo=, _the rider is seen to emerge\r\nrunning_.\r\n\r\n[174] =que han parado en bandidos=, _who have ended by becoming\r\nbandits_.\r\n\r\n[175] =van a perderse en el crimen=, _are lost in crime_.\r\n\r\n[176] =que conquistara=, trans., _that once conquered_.\r\n\r\n[177] =Lagos Pontinos=, _the Pontine Marshes_, the low country\r\nsurrounding Rome.\r\n\r\n[178] =los Zumalacárregui, los Mina=.

For\r\nboldness and ruggedness these foremen may well be compared with the\r\nAmerican pioneers who crossed the prairies in the forties.\r\n\r\n[182] =algún famoso de tiempo atrás=, _some one famous in former days_.\r\n\r\n[183] =Por supuesto, que=. The =que= is redundant.\r\n\r\n[184] =suele haber=, _there are wont to be_.\r\n\r\n[185] =lo=. Cf. 29, 2.\r\n\r\n[186] =lo arbitrario=, _the arbitrariness_.\r\n\r\n[187] =sin que sus secuaces duden de ello=, _without his followers\r\ndoubting it_. The student must bear in mind that, whereas _without_\r\nin English is used only as a preposition, in Spanish its equivalent\r\n=sin= is used as a conjunction when, as in this case, it is followed\r\nby =que=. Spanish clauses introduced by =sin que=, therefore, must be\r\ntranslated by the preposition _without_ plus the _gerund_ of the verb.\r\n\r\n[188] =comandante de campaña=, an officer exercising both civil and\r\nmilitary authority in the country; trans., _country prefect_.\r\n\r\n[189] =Todavía una circunstancia nueva=, _Still another circumstance_.\r\n\r\n[190] =en su obediencia=. =Su= refers to =el gobierno=.\r\n\r\n[191] =Así el gobierno papal=.

Mustafa IV in 1806, by imperial firman, ratified\r\nthe election of Mehemet Ali by the sheiks to the pashalik of Egypt.\r\nMehemet Ali (1769-1849), pasha and afterwards viceroy of Egypt, though\r\nan illiterate of humble birth, was an extraordinarily clever and astute\r\nman. It was only through the intervention of the powers that in 1849,\r\nafter the rout of the Ottoman forces at the battle of Nezib, he was\r\nforced to be satisfied with only the hereditary Viceroyalty of Egypt.\r\n\r\n[193] =destronase=. The subject is =Mehemet Ali=.\r\n\r\n[194] =revolución=, _i.e._, the social revolution after the war of\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n[195] =López e Ibarra, Artigas y Güemes, Facundo y Rosas=.

The naming of such worthless men\r\nas those mentioned to the post of prefect was the equivalent of\r\neliminating that number of prefects.\r\n\r\n[199] =la revolución de las ciudades=, _i.e._, against the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n[200] =la desasociación=, _i.e._, =de la campaña=.\r\n\r\n[201] =en la desocupación=, _originating in idleness_.\r\n\r\n[202] =Estos focos=, _i.e._, =la pulpería=, =la estancia=, =la venta=.\r\n\r\n[203] =en Facundo Quiroga=,... For translation rearrange the sentence\r\nthus: =últimamente en Facundo Quiroga veremos= (understood) =la campaña\r\ntriunfante en todas partes sobre las ciudades, y éstas, siendo=\r\n(understood) =dominadas en su espíritu, gobierno, civilización,\r\nveremos= (understood) =formarse, al fin, el gobierno=, etc. In the\r\nseries =espíritu, gobierno, civilización= the conjunction =y= is\r\nomitted by asyndeton.\r\n\r\n[204] =montaña=, _i.e._, the Andes.\r\n\r\n[205] =Santiago del Estero=. V. map.\r\n\r\n[206] =descollaran=, _had excelled_.\r\n\r\n[207] =Cuzco=, city in Peru, capital of the ancient empire of the\r\nIncas.

It is of interest to note in this connection that the\r\ngaucho of the pampa calls this spirit =Mandinga=, who, although evilly\r\ninclined toward men, does at times do them favors.\r\n\r\n[211] =Salamanca=. The University of Salamanca was famous in the Middle\r\nAges as a great center of learning. Its motto was _Salamanca, maestra\r\nde todas las ciencias_. In the thirteenth century Pope Alexander IV,\r\nby a bull, made it one of the four great academies of the world. In\r\nArgentina, the word =Salamanca= has become synonymous with learning\r\nused for evil purposes, and means both witchcraft and the school where\r\nwitchcraft is taught.\r\n\r\n[212] \"=payar=\". Music plays an important part in all the gatherings\r\namong Argentine countrymen. Two =payadores=, or bards, engage in a\r\nmusical contest: each man sings in turn, accompanying himself on the\r\nguitar on any improvised subject, and at the end the audience expresses\r\nits approval of the winner by its applause.\r\n\r\n[213] =enano de la siesta=, _the dwarf of the noonday nap_. Tradition\r\nhas it that ghosts walk about in the quiet hours of the noonday nap.\r\nThis is not surprising if one bears in mind the deep stillness that\r\npervades small Spanish-American towns, particularly those in the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\n[214] =montes saladinos=, _saline mountains_. Cf. 42, 14.\r\n\r\n[215] =evoca=.

From this point, when his sister had reached\r\nthe =horqueta más alta=, he could pretend he was going up, although in\r\nreality he was going down.\r\n\r\n[226] =En progresiva nitidez de sombra=, _With gradual and clear-cut\r\nshadows_.\r\n\r\n[227] Note omission of =es= after =ninguna=.\r\n\r\n[228] =payador=. Cf. 79, 16.\r\n\r\n[229] \"=payadas de contrapunto=\". A contest such as the one described\r\nin the note to page 79, line 16, is called a =payada de contrapunto=.\r\n\r\n[230] =Hácese... silencio=, _Silence falls again_.\r\n\r\n[231] =Juan sin Ropa=, picturesque name given to the devil by the\r\ngauchos.\r\n\r\n[232] =le ha encontrado=, _i.e._, =a la leyenda=; trans., _has found in\r\nit_.\r\n\r\n[233] =la doctrina bíblica del _Génesis_=, _i.e._, the downfall of man.\r\n\r\n[234] =su orgullo=, _i.e._, _the pride of_ =Santos Vega=.\r\n\r\n[235] =Juan Díaz de Solís=, a famous Spanish explorer of the sixteenth\r\ncentury who discovered the Río de la Plata, in 1516, and called it\r\nMar Dulce, thinking he had discovered a sea. Landing on the island of\r\nMartín García, he was killed by the Charrúa Indians, a very warlike\r\ntribe that occupied the Plata basin.\r\n\r\n[236] =Sebastián Gaboto=. The name Cabot is usually connected with\r\nNewfoundland, but it has historical importance for Argentina also.\r\nSebastian was the son of the well-known North American explorer, John\r\nCabot.
